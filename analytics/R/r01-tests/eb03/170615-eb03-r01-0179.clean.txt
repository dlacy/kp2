miscdemeanours , are not to be allowed of course, but on 
sufficient probable cause shown to the attorney-general; and then they are understood to be grantable of common right, and 
ex debito justitix. 
But writs of error to reverse attainders in capital cases are only allowed 
ex gratia; 
and not without express warrant under the king’s sign manual, or at least by the consent of the attorney-general. These therefore can rarely be brought by the party himself, especially where he is attainted for an offence against the state : but they may be brought by his heir or executor after his death, in more favourable times; which may be some consolation to his family. But the easier and more effectual way is, 
Lastly, to reverse the attainder by act of parliament. This may be and hath been frequently done upon motives of compassion, or perhaps the zeal of the times, after a sudden revolution in the government, without examining too closely into the truth or validity of the errors assigned. And sometimes, though the crime be universally acknowledged and confessed, yet the merits of the criminal’s family shall after his death obtain a restitution in blood, honours, and estate, or some or one of them, by act of parliament; which (so far as it extends) has all the effect of reversing the attainder, without casting any reflections upon the justice of the preceding sentence. see Attainder. 
The effect of falsifying or reversing an outlawry is that the party shall be in the same plight as if he had appeared upon the 
capias : 
and, if it be before plea pleaded, he shali be put to plead to the indictment; if, after conviction, he shall receive the sentence of the law; for all the other proceedings, except only the process of outlawry for his nonappearance, remain good and effectual as before. But when judgement, pronounced upon conviction, is falsisied or reversed, all former pro ceedings are absolutely set aside, and the party stands as if he had never been at all accused; restored in his credit, his capacity, his blood, and his estates : with regard to which last, though they be granted away by the crown, yet the owner may enter upon the grantee, with ■ as little ceremony as he might enter upon a disseisor. — But he still remains liable to another prosecution for the same offence : for, the first being erroneous, he never was in jeopardy thereby.

Law, Nc 
CLXIX ι<~3·. 
Reversion, m the law of England, has two signi sications; the one of which is an estate left, which con tinues during a particular estate in being; and the other is the returning of the land, cafter the parii ticular estate is ended; and it is further said to be an interest in lands, when the possession of it fails, or where the estate which was for a time parted with, returns to the granters, or their heirs. But, according to the usual definition of a reversion, it is the residue of an estate left in the granter, after a particular estate granted away ceases, continuing in the granter of such an estate. 
The difference between a remainder and a reversion consists in this, that the remainder may belong to any man except the granter; whereas the 
reversion returns ta him who convey ed the lands, c. 
In 
order 
to 
render the doctrine of reversions easy, we shall give the following table; which shows the present value of one pound, to be received at the end of any number of years not exceeding 40; discounting at thc rate of 5, 4, and 3 
percent,

The use of the preceding table. — To find the present value of any sum to be received at the end of a given term of years, discounting at the rate of 3, 4, or 5 
percent, 
compound interest. Find by the above table the present value of 11. to be received at the end of the given term; which, multiply by the number of pounds proposed, (cutting off four figures from the product on account of the decimals), then the result will be the value sought: For example, the present value of
