<p><span class="font0">right ventricle and run through the lung substance pari passu with the bronchial tubes to the lobules. Here they branch into a dense&nbsp;network of capillaries which spread over the outside of the alveoli,&nbsp;enmeshing them so tightly ns to indent their walls. From the&nbsp;capillaries the blood flows into pulmonary venules which run&nbsp;together to form the large pulmonary veins, which open into the&nbsp;left auricle. The pulmonary venules may anastomose freely, but&nbsp;the arteries never do so. The veins possess no valves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The lymphatic vessels of the lung abound in all parts, but are usually described as having a threefold distribution,—(a) in the&nbsp;layer of tissue beneath the membrane investing the whole lung, (fi)&nbsp;in the perivascular tissue, and (c) in the peribronchial tissue.&nbsp;When fine carbon particles are introduced into the alveoli of the&nbsp;lung they find their way with the greatest ease into the interalveolar tissues, and finally come to lie in the three positions just&nbsp;referred to, as may be demonstrated in the lung of any coal miner.&nbsp;The lymphatics of the membrane investing the lung communicate&nbsp;with the free surface of that membrane by means of openings not&nbsp;unlike the stomata of leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The lungs, with the heart and great vessels, are the chief organs contained in the thorax, or that division of the great body cavity&nbsp;which lies above the diaphragm. Each lung is invested with a&nbsp;membrane called pleura, which plays a most important part in the&nbsp;mechanism of respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Pleural Membrane.—Let us imagine a bag shaped like an hour glass, and let us suppose one half of this bag to be packed up&nbsp;small and pushed through the constricted portion of the hour glass&nbsp;into the interior of the other half. We should then have a bag&nbsp;shaped like one half of an hour glass but provided with double walls&nbsp;—a more or less globular double-walled bag with a narrow opening&nbsp;into it. If further we imagine the interior of this double-walled bag&nbsp;(no&lt; the interior of the hour glass) to be entirely filled with one lung,&nbsp;we shall have an exact conception of the relationship of the lung to&nbsp;the pleura. The lung so covered is placed in its proper half of the&nbsp;thorax, which in circumstances of health it accurately fills. The&nbsp;outer layer of the double-walled bag is closely glued to the inner&nbsp;wall of the thorax. The inner layer is as firmly adherent to the&nbsp;surface of the lung. The space between the double walls, i.e., the&nbsp;interior of the original hour glass, is called the pleural cavity ; it&nbsp;is vacuous in health, being moistened by a mere trace of fluid. The&nbsp;substance of the pleural membrane is mainly connective tissue ;&nbsp;and the interior of the pleural cavity is lined with a single layer of&nbsp;flat epithelial cells exhibiting the stomata already referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Thorax.—The chest or thorax is formed by the dorsal section of the spinal column behind, with the ribs that spring from it on&nbsp;each side, and the sternum, which lies between the ends of the ribs,&nbsp;in front. The dorsal spine is bowed, so that its concavity looks&nbsp;forward. The ribs, speaking generally, are bowed with their concavity turned towards the interior of the chest ; and if we consider&nbsp;the plane of each rib, f.e., that plane in which the arched rib would&nbsp;(approximately) lie flat, we shall find that it declines from the horizontal in a twofold manner—first the rib-plane slopes from behind&nbsp;downwards and forwards, and secondly it slopes on each side from&nbsp;the mesial plane of the body downwards and outwards. The ribs&nbsp;1-7 are connected with the sternum by means of pieces of cartilage&nbsp;which really form the anterior portion of each rib arch ; these ribs&nbsp;are called “ true ” ; the eighth, ninth, and tenth ribs are united by&nbsp;cartilage, not to the sternum, but to the cartilages of the seventh,&nbsp;eighth, and ninth ribs respectively ; these ribs are called ‘ ‘ false ” ;&nbsp;the eleventh and twelfth ribs are called ‘ ‘ floating ” because they are&nbsp;unattached anteriorly. Each rib has a head, by which it is joined to&nbsp;the vertebral bodies constituting the spinal column ; a tubercle or&nbsp;shoulder at a little distance away from the head, by which in all&nbsp;cases, except those of the tenth and eleventh ribs, it is joined to the&nbsp;transverse process of a vertebra ; an angle or rough line a little&nbsp;beyond the tubercle, where the rib, rather suddenly, begins to sweep&nbsp;forwards ; and a neck, the part intervening between the head and&nbsp;tubercle. The space between the ribs is filled up by two layers of&nbsp;muscles called intercostal—an outer or superficial layer, whose fibres&nbsp;run from above downwards and forwards, and a deeper or internal&nbsp;layer, whose fibres cross those of the former. The outer layer is not&nbsp;found between the costal cartilages in front, nor the inner layer&nbsp;between the costal necks behind. The upper opening of the thorax&nbsp;is filled by the windpipe blood-vessels and other structures passing into or out of the thorax. The floor of the thorax is formed&nbsp;by</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Diaphragm.—This consists of a thin arched muscular partition, whose fibres spring from the edge of the lower opening of the thorax&nbsp;and converge towards a sheet of tendon in the. centre, which is shaped&nbsp;somewhat like a trefoil leaf. We may group the muscular fibres of&nbsp;the diaphragm according to the quadrant from which they spring :—&nbsp;(1) a vertebral portion, whose fibres stretch down to be attached in&nbsp;two well-marked columns or pillars to the bodies of some of the&nbsp;lumber vertebræ and by tendinous arches to the transverse processes&nbsp;of the first lumbar vertebra and the twelfth rib ; (2) a sternal portion,&nbsp;which springsïrom the back of the tip of the sternum, and from the&nbsp;sheath of the rectus abdominis muscles below it ; (3) and (4) two&nbsp;lateral or costal portions, which spring from the lower edge of the&nbsp;thorax all round from the tip of the twelfth rib to the junction&nbsp;between the sixth and seventh costal cartilage where the sternal&nbsp;portion begins. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">whole diaphragm</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">forms a dome or cu</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">pola projecting so far</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">the lateral vertical</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">portions of the dome</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lie in close apposition</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">thorax, as is shown</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Other Muscles of Respiration.—The ribs are movable in the&nbsp;sense that each rib&nbsp;plane, which has been&nbsp;described as declining&nbsp;in two ways from the&nbsp;horizontal plane, may&nbsp;be made to approach&nbsp;the horizontal, and&nbsp;may afterwards return to its original&nbsp;position. To accomplish these movements various muscles are&nbsp;provided, the exact position of which need not be very fully described. Suffice it to say that in general they arise from the vertebral axis, or from some extra-thoracic fixed point, and take hold&nbsp;of the movable parts of the thorax in such a manner that they can&nbsp;pull them up or pull them down. Such muscles are the following&nbsp;(enumerated without reference to their function as inspiratory or&nbsp;expiratory muscles ; particular descriptions of them must be sought&nbsp;in the article Anatomy) :—levatores costarum ; the three scalene&nbsp;muscles ; the sterno-cleidomastoid ; serratus posticus superior ;&nbsp;parts of the great erector spinæ muscle ; possibly serratus magnus ;&nbsp;pectoralis minor and major in certain positions of the arm ; obli-quus externus ; obliquus internus ; transversalis abdominis ; triangularis sterni ; serratus posticus inferior ; quadratus lumborum.&nbsp;In addition to these muscles many others may lend occasional aid&nbsp;in respiration by fixing points, such as the scapula, otherwise too&nbsp;freely movable to act as a point cl'appui ; such are trapezius, latis-simus dorsi, rhomboidei, and levator anguli scapuli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dimensions of the Thorax.—The circumference of the chest just below the level of the arms is about 34∣ inches in men, and 32&nbsp;inches in women. At the level of the tip of the sternum it is 32&nbsp;and 30⅛ inches respectively. The measurement from clavicle to&nbsp;lower edge of thorax varies very much in different cases. The&nbsp;transverse diameter above the nipple is about 10 to 10∣ inches in&nbsp;men, and about 9⅛ to 9f inches in women. The antero-posterior&nbsp;diameter, measured from the spines of the vertebræ behind to the&nbsp;surface of the chest in front is in the upper part of the chest about&nbsp;6⅜ inches, and in the lower 7⅜ inches. The right half of the chest&nbsp;is generally somewhat larger than the left, because its muscles are&nbsp;usually better developed. Instruments .for measuring the exact&nbsp;circumference of the chest at a given level are called cyrtometers ;&nbsp;the best of these is a strip of lead which can be laid along the side of&nbsp;the chest from the spine round to the sternum, and which is pliable&nbsp;enough to follow the inequalities of the chest wall, yet resistent&nbsp;enough to keep the shape imparted to it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Physiological Actions of the Respiratory Organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The organs above described perform during the whole of life certain movements. The commonest are the movements of ordinary quiet respiration, but we must include&nbsp;under the head of physiological actions, as distinguished&nbsp;from those provoked by disease, other movements, viz.,&nbsp;forced respiration, such as accompanies strenuous muscular&nbsp;exertion, and those modifications of the respiratory act&nbsp;called coughing, hawking, sneezing, snoring, crying, sighing, laughing, yawning, and hiccoughing.</span></p>
