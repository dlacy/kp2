<p><span class="font1">heart of the gospel with all his heart, and while a certain controversial<sup>@@1</sup> element inevitably enters into his exposition— since he is writing with his eye on the Roman Church—any&nbsp;such considerations are quite subordinate to his dominating&nbsp;aim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The epistle dates itself. Paul is on his way to Jerusalem with the moneys collected from the Macedonian and Achaian&nbsp;churches (xv. 19-32), and, after his visit to the Jewish capital,&nbsp;he proposes to visit the church of Rome </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">en route</span><span class="font1"> for a mission&nbsp;in Spain. The situation corresponds to that outlined in&nbsp;Acts xx. 2-3. Paul probably despatched the epistle from&nbsp;Corinth. This conclusion would be put almost beyond doubt&nbsp;were Rom. xvi. regarded as an integral part of the original&nbsp;epistle, since in that case Timothy and Sosipater (xvi. 21)&nbsp;would be with Paul as in Acts xx. 4, like Gaius (xvi. 23)&nbsp;and Erastus, both of whom were Corinthians (1 Cor. i. 14;&nbsp;2 Tim. iv. 20). Phoebe of Cenchreae, the seaport of Corinth,&nbsp;would also be the bearer of the epistle (xvi. 1). But even&nbsp;apart from the evidence of ch. xvi., the tone of the epistle&nbsp;(especially of xv. 19 f.) indicates that Paul regards his jvork&nbsp;in the eastern provinces as done, and now turns to the West.&nbsp;It is just possible, of course, that the epistle was written from&nbsp;some other town, perhaps in Illyricum (so H. E. G. Paulus),&nbsp;but the facilities of communication point to Corinth.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1 </sup>Not, however, in the sections bearing on the Law. ** It has been customary to explain this feature of the epistle by the fact of&nbsp;its having been written to a church with which Paul had no personal&nbsp;relations, and this may count for something. But there is a deeper&nbsp;and a worthier reason for the contrast in tone between this epistle&nbsp;and those written to the Galatian and Corinthian churches. The&nbsp;whole situation is changed.

In 1856 the railway from Romanshorn to Zürich&nbsp;was opened, and this vastly increased the commercial importance of Romanshorn. Nowadays it is the centre of a great&nbsp;transit trade, as it communicates, by means of the lake, with&nbsp;the principal towns on its shores. Tbe corn trade and that&nbsp;in timber are among the most important, while there are&nbsp;many industrial establishments. It is essentially a modem&nbsp;commercial centre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROMANUS, the name of four East Roman emperors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Romanus I. (Lecapenus), who shared the imperial throne with Constantine VII. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> and exercised all the real power&nbsp;from 919 to 944, was admiral of the Byzantine fleet on the&nbsp;Danube when, hearing of the defeat of the army at Achelous&nbsp;(917), he resolved to sail for Constantinople. After the marriage&nbsp;of his daughter Helena to Constantine he was first proclaimed&nbsp;“ basileopater ” in 919 and soon after crowned colleague of&nbsp;his son-in-law. His reign, which was uneventful, except for&nbsp;an attempt to check the accumulation of landed property,&nbsp;was terminated by his own sons, Stephen and Constantine, who&nbsp;in 944 carried him off to the island of Prote and compelled&nbsp;him to become a monk. He died in 948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Romanus II. succeeded his father Constantine VII. in 959 at the age of twenty-one, and died—poisoned, it was believed,&nbsp;by his wife, Theophano—in 963. He was a pleasure-loving&nbsp;sovereign, but showed judgment in the selection of bis ministers.&nbsp;The great event of his reign was tbe conquest of Crete by&nbsp;Nicephorus Phocas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Romanus III. (Argyrus), emperor 1028-1034, was an undistinguished Byzantine patrician, who was compelled by the dying emperor Constantine IX. to marry his daughter Zoe&nbsp;and to become his successor. He showed great eagerness to&nbsp;make his mark as a ruler, but was mostly unfortunate in his&nbsp;enterprises. He spent large sums upon new buildings and in&nbsp;endowing the monks, and in his endeavour to relieve the pressure&nbsp;of taxation disorganized the finances of the state. In 1030 he&nbsp;resolved to retaliate upon the incursions of tbe Moslems on&nbsp;the eastern frontier by leading a large army in person against&nbsp;Aleppo, but by allowing himself to be surprised on the march&nbsp;sustained a serious defeat at Azaz near Antioch. Though this&nbsp;disaster was retrieved by the successful defence of Edessa by&nbsp;George Maniakes and by the defeat of a Saracen fleet in the&nbsp;Adriatic, Romanus never recovered his popularity. His early&nbsp;death was supposed to have been due to poison administered&nbsp;by his wife.</span></p>
