<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sceleratus,</span><span class="font1"> between the forum and the Esquiline, was the scene of his daughter’s horrible impiety, when she caused&nbsp;her chariot wheel to pass over the body of her father.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before the Augustan age, the Esquiline mount was inhabited by the meanest of the Roman people ; and in that part of it which was without the wall their unburied bodies&nbsp;were promiscuously deposited.@@<sup>2</sup> Maecenas having received a present of the ground from Augustus, covered it with&nbsp;gardens and groves, and erected on its summit a palace.@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>On this mount Julius Cæsar was bom. Here also was the&nbsp;house of the younger Pliny, part of Nero’s golden house,&nbsp;and the palace and baths of the emperor Titus. Here Virgil also is said to have had a house, near the palace of his&nbsp;patron Mæcenas. It is stated by Suetonius, that Horace&nbsp;was buried near the tomb of Mæcenas, at the extremity of&nbsp;the hill.@@<sup>4</sup> The Esquiline mount has two summits, the Cis-pius, on which stands the basilica of Santa Mari Maggiore, and&nbsp;which was supposed to have been anciently occupied with the&nbsp;temple of Juno Lucina ; and the Oppius, crowned with the&nbsp;church of St. Pietro in Vincula, built upon a part of the&nbsp;extensive baths of Titus. Toward the extremity of the Esquiline, and not far from the Porta Maggiore, in a vineyard,&nbsp;stands a ruined edifice called the temple of Minerva Medica.&nbsp;Nothing now remains but the walls and part of the vaulted roof. Many beautiful statues have been found in the&nbsp;grounds that border it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Viminal hill, which probably derived its name from the osiers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(vimines)</span><span class="font1"> that grew upon it,@@<sup>5</sup> lies between the&nbsp;Esquiline and the Quirinal, but the fall of the ruins from&nbsp;these hills has rendered it almost impossible to recognize&nbsp;it. The only conspicuous object upon it is the church of&nbsp;S. Lorenzo in Pane Perna, with its adjoining buildings and&nbsp;vineyards. Near the Viminal hill stood the celebrated&nbsp;prætorian camp, which forms such a distinguished object in&nbsp;the decline of the Roman empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Quirinal hill was adorned in ancient times with the famous temple of Romulus Quirinus. On the opposite side,&nbsp;the magnificent temple of the Sun, built by Aurelian, is&nbsp;supposed to have stood. The Quirinal is the only one of&nbsp;the seven hills that is populous. It is covered with palaces,&nbsp;churches, streets, and fountains. But the only remains of&nbsp;antiquity that it can now boast, are the vestiges of the baths&nbsp;of Constantine, in that part of the Colonna gardens which&nbsp;overlooks the Piazza Pilotta, and a considerable part of the&nbsp;baths of Diocletian, one of the grandest remains of ancient&nbsp;splendour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The site of the Roman Forum is between the Palatine and Capitoline hills. Its present surface is from fifteen to twenty&nbsp;feet above its ancient level, and various excavations are now&nbsp;making in it in the hope of discovering some relics of antiquity. “ Here were held the comitia, or assemblies of the&nbsp;people ; here stood the rostra from which the orators harangued them; the curia, or senate-house; the basilica, or&nbsp;courts of justice; the public tribunals, the statues and memorials of great men, and some of the most sacred temples&nbsp;of religion.” After the destruction of the republic, another&nbsp;forum was built by Julius Cæsar; and his example was followed by Augustus, Nerva, Domitian, Trajan, Vespasian,&nbsp;and Antoninus Pius. The only remains of antiquity that&nbsp;now stand within the limits of the Roman forum are those&nbsp;commonly designated as the triumphal arch of Septimius&nbsp;Severus, the temple of Jupiter Tonans, the temple of Fortune, and the temple of Concord, and the solitary column&nbsp;dedicated by the Greek Exarch, Smaragdus, Ito the emperor Phocas, the ruined wall of the curia, and the three</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">beautiful columns near the base of the Palatine hill, generally called “ the disputed columns.” Of the immense number of other buildings of all kinds, temples, basilicas,&nbsp;columns, statues, which once stood here, not a vestige&nbsp;now remains, and their very situations are a matter of&nbsp;bitter dispute. At the north-east corner of the Forum&nbsp;is the church of Santa Martina and St. Luke, which is supposed, with some probability, to occupy the site of the beautiful temple of Mars the Avenger, erected by Augustus.&nbsp;Near it is the church of St. Adrian, called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in tribus foris,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">from the Roman forum, and the forums of Julius Cæsar&nbsp;and Augustus, of which it forms thc connecting point. Behind these are three fluted Corinthian columns, and one pilaster of Parian marble, of the grandest and most perfect&nbsp;style of architecture, supposed to be the remains of thc&nbsp;forum of Nerva. To the eastward, and at the base of the&nbsp;Quirinal hill, is the forum of Trajan, the centre of which&nbsp;has been excavated, down to the level of the ancient pavement, by the F rench. Here stood the famous equestrian statue&nbsp;of Trajan, which excited the admiration and envy of Constantine,@@<sup>6</sup> and many other honorary statues of distinguished&nbsp;individuals ; and here still stands the triumphal column of&nbsp;Trajan, the finest in the world. This superh pillar is of the&nbsp;finest white marble, about 128 feet in height, and is covered&nbsp;with sculptured figures representing the wars and triumphs&nbsp;of the emperor Trajan. The ascent to the summit is by a&nbsp;winding staircase of 185 steps of solid Parian marble. A&nbsp;little to the north is the triumphal column of Marcus Aurelius, formed of the same materials and workmanship, though&nbsp;inferior in the beauty and perfection of its sculpture to that&nbsp;of Trajan. These columns formerly supported each a colossal&nbsp;statue of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius, but they have long&nbsp;since disappeared, while bronze statues of the apostles Peter&nbsp;and Paul have been substituted in their stead. In a deserted spot, which was once the forum boarium, or cattle-market of Rome, there is a magnificent four-fronted arch,&nbsp;commonly called Janus quadrifrons, which is the only one&nbsp;now remaining of the many ancient Jani of ancient Rome.&nbsp;It is built of immense blocks of Grecian marble, now so&nbsp;darkened and discoloured by time, and covered with bushes&nbsp;and ivy, that it has a peculiarly picturesque and venerable&nbsp;appearance. Near this arch, by passing under some low&nbsp;brick vaults opposite the church of S. Giorgio in Velabro, the&nbsp;best view is obtained of the celebrated “ Cloaca Maxima,&quot;&nbsp;unquestionably the most ancient of all the ruins of Rome,&nbsp;and the only remains of the work of her kings. This stupendous and useful work was executed by Tarquinius Superbus.@@<sup>7</sup> In ancient times the arches were so large, that it&nbsp;is stated by Strabo and Pliny, that a waggon load of hay&nbsp;might pass through them.@@<sup>8</sup> Though greatly choked up by&nbsp;the elevation of the soil of modern Rome, it still, after a&nbsp;lapse of 3000 years, serves as the common sewer of the city.&nbsp;Almost close to the cloaca maxima is the far-famed fountain of Juturna.@@<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Proceeding along the Via Sacra, we come to some ruins which are supposed to be the remains of Vespasian’s temple&nbsp;of Peace, built at the close of the Jewish war. It was one&nbsp;of the most magnificent temples of antiquity, and within it&nbsp;were deposited the spoils taken from the temple of Jerusalem. Others maintain, however, that these ruins belonged&nbsp;to the basilica of Constantine. Crossing to the opposite&nbsp;side, and passing under the broken and defaced triumphal arch of Titus, we behold the majestic ruins of the&nbsp;mighty Coliseum. This stupendous building was erected&nbsp;by Vespasian and Titus, on the spot which had previously</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
