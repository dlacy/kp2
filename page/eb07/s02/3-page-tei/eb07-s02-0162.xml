Within the stations were lodgings for the officers and soldiers in garrison ; the smallest of them being sufficient to contain a cohort, or six hundred men. Without the walls of each station was a town, inhabited by labourers, artificers, and others, both Romans and Britons, who chose to dwell under the protection of these fortresses. The number of the stations upon the wall was eighteen ; and if they had been placed at equal distances, the interval between every two of them would have been four miles and a few paces. But the intervention of rivers, marshes, and mountains, the conveniency of situations for strength, prospect, and water, and many other circumstances to us unknown, determined them to place these stations at unequal distances. The situation which was always chosen by the Romans, both here and everywhere else in Britain where they could obtain it, was the gentle declivity of a hill, near a river, and facing the meridian sun. Such was the situation of the far greatest part of the stations on this wall. In general, we may observe, that the stations stood thickest near the two ends and in the middle, probably because the danger of invasion was greatest in these places. But the reader will form a clearer idea of the number of these stations, their Latin and English names, their situation and distance from one another, by inspecting the following table, than we can give with equal brevity in any other way. The first column contains the number of the station, reckoning from east to west ; the second contains its Latin, and the third its English name ; and the three last its distance from the next station to the west of it, in miles, furlongs, and chains.</p><table><row><cell>No.</cell><cell>Latin Name.</cell><cell>English Name.</cell><cell>M.</cell><cell>F.</cell><cell>C.</cell></row><row><cell>1</cell><cell>Segedunum...</cell><cell>Cousin’s House....</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>1½</cell></row><row><cell>2</cell><cell>Pons Ælii	</cell><cell>Newcastle	</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>9</cell></row><row><cell>3</cell><cell>Condercum...</cell><cell>Benwell Hill	</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>5</cell></row><row><cell>4</cell><cell>Vindobala.....</cell><cell>Hutch ester	</cell><cell>7</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>3½</cell></row><row><cell>5</cell><cell>Ηιιnnnm	</cell><cell>Hal ton-chesters....</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>7</cell></row><row><cell>6</cell><cell>Cilurnum	</cell><cell>Walwick-chesters.</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>7</cell><cell>Procolitia	</cell><cell>Carrawbrugh	</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>3½</cell></row><row><cell>8</cell><cell>Borcovicus...</cell><cell>Housesteeds			</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>9</cell><cell>Vindolana	</cell><cell>Little Chesters	</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>4</cell></row><row><cell>10</cell><cell>Æsica	</cell><cell>Great Chesters	</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>f∙i</cell></row><row><cell>11</cell><cell>Magna	</cell><cell>Carrvoran	</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>0</cell></row><row><cell>12</cell><cell>Amboglana...</cell><cell>Burdoswald	</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>13</cell><cell>Petriana	</cell><cell>C limbeck	</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>6</cell></row><row><cell>14</cell><cell>Aballaba	</cell><cell>Watch cross	</cell><cell><hi rend="italic">5</hi></cell><cell>1</cell><cell>9</cell></row><row><cell>15</cell><cell>Congavata.....</cell><cell>Stanwix	</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>4</cell></row><row><cell>16</cell><cell>Axelodunum..</cell><cell>Brugh	</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>9</cell></row><row><cell>17</cell><cell>Gabrosentum.</cell><cell>Brumbrugh	</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>1</cell></row><row><cell>18</cell><cell>Tunnocelum..</cell><cell>Boulness	</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>0</cell></row><row><cell/><cell/><cell>Length of the wall</cell><cell>68</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>3</cell></row></table><p>The <hi rend="italic">castella,</hi> or castles, were the second kind of fortifications which were built along the line of this wall for its defence. These castles were neither so large nor so strong as the stations, but much more numerous, being no fewer than eighty-one. The shape and dimensions of the castles, as appears from the foundations of many of them which are stiil visible, were exact squares of sixty-six feet every way. They were fortified on every side with thick and lofty walls, but without any ditch, except on the north side, on which the wall itself, raised much above its usual height, with the ditch attending it, formed the fortification. The castles were situated in the intervals between the stations, at the distance of about seven furlongs from each other, though particular circumstances sometimes occasioned a little variation. In these castles guards were constantly kept, by a competent number of men detached from the nearest stations.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">turres,</hi> or turrets, were the third and last kind of for</p><p>tifications on the wall. These were still much smaller than the castles, and formed only a square of about twelve feet, standing out of the wall, on its south side. Being so small, they are more entirely ruined than the stations and castles, which makes it difficult to discover their exact number. They stood in the intervals between the castles ; and from the faint vestiges of a few of them, it is conjectured that there were four of them between every two castles, at the distance of about three hundred yards from one another. According to this conjecture, the number of the turrets amounted to three hundred and twenty-four. They were designed for watch-towers and places for sentinels, who, being within hearing of one another, could convey an alarm or piece of intelligence to all parts of the wall in a very little time.</p><p>Such were the stations, castles, and turrets, on the wall of Severus ; and a very considerable body of troops was constantly quartered in them for its defence. The usual complement allowed for this service was as follows :</p><p>1.	Twelve cohorts of foot, consisting of 600 men each..7,200</p><p>2.	One cohort of mariners in the station at Boulness... 600</p><p>3.	One detachment of Moors, probably equal to a co</p><p>hort 	 600</p><p>4.	Four alæ or wings of horse, consisting, at the lowest</p><p>computation, of 400 each	1,600</p><p>10,000</p><p>For the conveniency of marching these troops from one part of the wall to another, with the greater ease and expedition, on any service, it was attended with two military ways, paved with square stones, in the most solid and beautiful manner. One of these ways was smaller, and the other larger. The smaller military way run close along the south side of the wall, from turret to turret, and castle to castle, for the use of the soldiers in relieving their guards and sentinels, and such services. The larger way did not keep so near the wall, nor touch at the turrets or castles, but pursued the most direct course from one station to another, and was designed for the convenience of marching larger bodies of troops.</p><p>It is to be regretted that we cannot gratify the reader’s curiosity, by informing him by what particular bodies of Roman troops the several parts of this great work were executed, as we were enabled to do from inscriptions with regard to the wall of Antoninus Pius. For though it is probable that there were stones with inscriptions of the same kind, mentioning the several bodies of troops, and the quantity of work performed by each of them, originally inserted in the face of this wall, yet none of them are now to be found. There have indeed been discovered, in or near the ruins of this wall, a great number of small square stones, with very short, and generally imperfect, inscriptions upon them, mentioning particular legions, cohorts, and centuries, but without directly asserting that they had built any part of the wall, or naming any number of paces. Of these inscriptions the reader may sec no fewer than twenty-nine among the Northumberland and Cumberland inscriptions in Horsley’s <hi rend="italic">Britannia Romanα.</hi> As the stones on which these inscriptions are cut are of the same shape and size with the other facing-stones of this wall, it is almost certain that they have been originally placed in the face of it. It is equally certain, from the uniformity of these inscriptions, that they were all intended to intimate some one thing, and nothing so probable as that the adjacent wall was built by the troops mentioned in them. This was perhaps so well understood, that it was not thought necessary to be expressed ; and the distance of these inscriptions from one another showed the quantity of work performed. If this was really the case, we know in general that this great work was executed by the second and sixth legions, these being the only legions mentioned in these inscriptions.</p></body></text></TEI>
