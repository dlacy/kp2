The crown had of late years attempted to break through this privilege. To avoid the danger, the clergy prefented to the court a free gift of a ſum of money ſomewhat ſhort ol a mil-lion Sterling every five years.</p><p>The nobility was nominally the ſecond order of the ſtatc, but it was in reality the firſt. The nobles amounted to no lefs than 200,oco in number. The title and rank defcended to all the children of the family, but the property to the eldeſt alone : hence vaſt multitudes of them were depcndent upon the bounty of the court. They regarded the ufeful and commercial arts as diſho-nourable, and even the liberal profeſſions of the law and phyfic as in a great meaſure beneath their dignity, diſ-daining to intermarry with the families of their profef-ſors. °The feudal ſyſtem in its purity was extremely favourable to the production of refpectable qualities in the minds of thoſe who belonged to the order of the nobles ; but the introduction of commerce has rendered its decline equally unfavourable to that claſs of men. Inſtead of the ancient patriarchal attachment between the feudal chieftain and his vaffals, the nobility had be-come greedy landlords in the provinces, that they mιg∩t appear in ſplendor at court and in the capital. There, loſt in intrigue, ſenſuality, and vanity, their characters became frivolous and contemptible. Such of the French nobleſſe, however, as remained in the provinces, regard-ed with indignation this degradation oſ their order, and ſtill retained a proud ſenſe of honour and of courage, •which has always rendered them reſpectable. The order of the nobles was exempted from the pay ment of taxes, although the property of fome of them was immenſe. The eſtates of the prince of Conde, for example, were worth L. 200,000 a year, and thoſe of the duke of orleans nearly twice as much. The crown had indeed impoſed ſome trifling taxes upon the nobleſſe, which, however, they in a great meaſure contrived to elude.</p><p>Next to the nobles, and as a privileged order poſſeſ-fing a ſecondary kind of nobility of their own, we may mention the parliaments. Theſe were large bodies of men, in different provinces, appointed as courts of law for the adminiſtration of juſtice. In conſequence of the corruption of the officers of ſtate, the members purcha-ſed their places, which they held for life ; but the ſhn was ufually preferred when he offered to purchaſe his father’s place. In conſequence of this laſt circumſtance, the practifing lawyers had little chance of ever beco-ming judges. Courts thus conſtituted conſiſted of a motley mixture of old and young, learned and ignorant, men. Juſtice was ill adminiſtered. 'Γhe judges allowed their votes in depending cauſes to be openly ſolici-ted by the parties or their friends. No wife man ever entered into a litigation againſt a member of one of theſe parliaments 5 no lawyer would undertake to plead ■his cauſe.; it never came to a ſucceſsful iffue, and uſu-ally never came to any iſſue at all. After the ſtates-general had fallen into difiιfe, the parliaments acquired a certain degree of political confequence, and formed the only check upon the abſolute power of the crown. The laws, or royal edicts, before being put in force, were always ſent to be regiſtered in the books oi the parliaments. Taking advantage of this, in favourable times and circumſtances, they often delayed or refuſed io regiſter .the royal edicts, and preſented remonſtrances</p><p>againſt them. This was done under a kind of legal fiction : for they pretended that the obnoxious edict being injurious to the public happinefs, could not be the will of the king, but muſt either be a forgery or an impoſition by the miniſters. Theſe objections were got the better of, either by a pofitive order from the king, or by his coming in perfon and ordering the edict to be regiſtered. The parliaments, however, often carried their oppoſition very far, even to the ruin of them-felves and their families as individuals. This rendered them extremely popular with the nation, and enabled them to embarrafs a weak adminiſtration. After all, however, the oppoſiticn of the parliaments was fo feeble, that it was never thought worth while to aboliſh them entirely till towards the end of the reign of Louis XV. but they were reſtored as a popular meafure at the beginning of thc reign of Louis XVI.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">tiers etat,</hi>  or commons, formed the loweſt order of the ſtate in France, and they were depreſſed and mi-ferable in the extreme. To form a conception of their ſituation, it is neceſſary to obſerve that they bore the whole pecuniary burdens of the ſtate : They alone were liable to taxation. An expenſive and ambitious court ; an army of 200,000 men in time of peace, and of twice that number in war ; a conſiderable marine eſtabliſhment, public roads and works, were all ſupported excluſively by the loweſt of the people. To add to the evil, the revenues were ill collected. They were let out to farmers-general at a certain ſum, over and above which they not only acquired immenſe fortunes to them-ſelves, but were enabled to advance enormous preſents to thoſe favourites or miſtreſſes of the king or the mi-niſter, by means of whom they procured their places. To raiſe all this money from the people, they were guilty of the cruelleſt oppreſſion, having it in their power to obtain whatever revenue laws they pleaſed, and executing them in the fevereſt manner. For this laſt purpoſe they kept in pay an army of clerks, ſubalterns, ſcouts, and ſpies, amounting to 80,000 men. Theſe men were indeed deteſted by the king, whom they de* ceived and kept in poverty ; by the people, whom they oppreſſed ; and by the ancient nobility, as purſe-proud upſtarts. But the court of France could never contrive</p><p>to manage without them. The peaſants could be call-ed out by the intendants of the provinces in what they called <hi rend="italic">corvées</hi>  to work upon the high roads for a certain number of days in the year, which was a ſource of ſe-vere oppreffion, as the intendant had the choice of the time and place of their employment, and was not bound to accept of any commutation in money. They were moreover ſubject to the nobles in a thouſand ways. The nobles retained all their ancient manerial or patri-monial juriſdictions. The common people being an-ciently ſlaves, had obtained their freedom upon different conditions. In many places they and their poſterity remained bound to pay a perpetual tribute to their feudal lords. Such tributes formed a conſiderable part of the revenue of many of the provincial nobles. No man could be an officer of the army, by a late regulation, who did not produce proofs of nobility for four genera-tions. The parliaments, although originally of the <hi rend="italic">tiers etat,</hi>  attempted alſo to introduce a rule that none but the nobleſſe ſhould be admitted into their order. In ſuch a ſituation, it will not be accounted ſurpriſing that the common people of Fiance were extremely ſuperſti-</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
