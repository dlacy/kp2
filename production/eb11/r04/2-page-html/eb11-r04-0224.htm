<p><span class="font0">In June 1885 the Liberal administration broke up, but Lord Salisbury’s ministry, which succeeded, was beaten early in&nbsp;February 1886, and when Mr Gladstone adopted Home Rule,&nbsp;Lord Rosebery threw in his lot with the old leader, and was&nbsp;made secretary of state for foreign affairs during the brief&nbsp;Liberal ministry which followed. He rather distinguished&nbsp;himself in the Lucia Bay negotiations then being carried on&nbsp;with Germany. If Busch is to be believed, Prince Bismarck’s&nbsp;view was that Lord Rosebery had “ quite mesmerized ” Count&nbsp;Herbert Bismarck; and the latter, from his father’s standpoint,&nbsp;conceded too much to Lord Rosebery, who proved himself to&nbsp;be, in Bismarck’s language, “ very sharp.” His views on foreign&nbsp;policy differed materially from those of Granville and Gladstone.&nbsp;His mind was dwelling constantly upon the political legacy of&nbsp;the two Pitts; he was a reader of Sir John Seeley; he had himself visited the colonies; had predicted that a war would not,&nbsp;as was commonly said, disintegrate the empire, but rather&nbsp;the reverse; had magnified the importance of taking colonial&nbsp;opinion; and had always been a convinced advocate of some&nbsp;form of Imperial Federation. He was already taunted with&nbsp;being an Imperialist, but his independent attitude won public&nbsp;approval. Cambridge gave him the degree of LL.D. in 1888;&nbsp;in January 1889 he was elected a member of the first county&nbsp;council of London, and on the 12th of February he was elected&nbsp;chairman of that body by 104 votes to 17. The tact, assiduity&nbsp;and dignity with which he guided the deliberations of the&nbsp;council made him exceedingly popular with its members. In&nbsp;the spring of 1890 he presided over the Co-operative Congress,&nbsp;but with a view to the impending political campaign he found it&nbsp;necessary to resign the chairmanship of the county council in&nbsp;June. In November of this year, however, Lady -Rosebery died,&nbsp;and he withdrew for a period from public business. In 1891&nbsp;he made some brief continental visits, one to Madrid, and in&nbsp;October he saw through the press his little monograph upon&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">William Pitt,</span><span class="font0"> in the Twelve English Statesmen Series, of&nbsp;which it may be said that it competes in interest with Viscount&nbsp;Morley’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Walpole.</span><span class="font0"> In January 1892, upon a new election, he&nbsp;again for a few months became chairman of the county council.&nbsp;It was already recognized that in him the country possessed&nbsp;not only a public man of exceptionally attractive personality,&nbsp;but one whose literary tastes were combined with a gift for&nbsp;expression which was at once original and fluent. In October&nbsp;the Garter was conferred upon him by Queen Victoria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile, in August, upon the return of Gladstone to power, he was induced with some difficulty (for he was suffering at the&nbsp;time from insomnia) to resume his position as foreign minister.&nbsp;His acceptance was construed as a security against the suspicion&nbsp;of weakness abroad which the Liberal party had incurred by&nbsp;their foreign policy during the ’eighties. He strongly opposed&nbsp;the evacuation of Egypt; he insisted upon the exclusive control&nbsp;by Great Britain of the Upper Nile Valley, and also upon the&nbsp;retention of Uganda. In 1893 the question of Siam came near&nbsp;to causing serious trouble with France, but by the exercise of&nbsp;a combination of firmness and forbearance on Lord Rosebery’s&nbsp;part the crisis was averted, and the lines were laitl down for preserving Siam, if possible, as a buffer state between the English&nbsp;and French frontiers in Indo-China. In the spring of 1895 he&nbsp;was clear-sighted enough to refuse to join the anti-Japanese&nbsp;League of Russia, France and Germany at the end of the China-Japan War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lord Rosebery’s personal popularity had been increased at home by his successful intervention in the coal strike of December&nbsp;1893, and when in March 1894 the resignation of Gladstone was&nbsp;announced, his selection by Queen Victoria for the premiership&nbsp;was welcomed by the public at large and by the majority of his&nbsp;own party. On all hands he was then considered </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dignus im-perio</span><span class="font0">—it was only as the new administration went to pieces&nbsp;that people began to add </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nisi imperasset.</span><span class="font0"> The conditions he&nbsp;had to face were by no means hopeful. The Liberal majority&nbsp;of 44 was already dwindling away, and the malcontents, who&nbsp;considered that Sir William Harcourt should have been the&nbsp;prime minister, or who were perpetually intriguing against a&nbsp;leader who did not satisfy their idea of Radicalism, made Lord&nbsp;Rosebery’s personal position no easy one. A systematic policy&nbsp;of detraction was pursued by the small section of the Radical&nbsp;party who objected to a peer premier as such, and a great deal&nbsp;of adverse criticism was also aroused by a speech in which the&nbsp;prime minister, taunted for not again bringing forward a Home&nbsp;Rule measure, insisted upon the truism that the conversion&nbsp;of England, the “ predominant partner,”, was a necessary&nbsp;condition of success. The support of the Irish Nationalists&nbsp;was by no means secure. Lord Rosebery’s foreign policy,&nbsp;moreover, was too Tory for his Radical followers; he insisted&nbsp;upon “ continuity of policy in foreign affairs,” which meant&nbsp;carrying on the Conservative policy and not upsetting it. The&nbsp;premier was thought to have shown a restlessness and a rawness&nbsp;at the touch of censure which did not increase his reputation&nbsp;for reserve power or strength, but this was undoubtedly due in&nbsp;large measure to the recrudescence of the insomnia from which&nbsp;he had suffered in 1891. The government effected little. In&nbsp;Mr Asquith’s phrase, it was “ ploughing the sands.” The&nbsp;Parish Councils Act was only passed by compromising with the&nbsp;Opposition. Local Veto and Disestablishment of the Welsh&nbsp;Church were put in the forefront of the party programme, but&nbsp;the government was already to all appearances riding for a&nbsp;fall, when on the 24th of June 1895 it <sup>was</sup> beaten upon an&nbsp;adverse vote in the Commons in regard to a question of the&nbsp;supply and reserve of small arms ammunition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The general election which followed after Lord Salisbury had formed his new ministry was remarkable for the undisciplined state of the Liberal party. At the Eighty Club and the&nbsp;Albert Hall Lord Rosebery advised them to concentrate upon&nbsp;the reform of the House of Lords, that assembly being, as he&nbsp;said, a foremost obstacle to the passing of legislation on the lines&nbsp;of the Newcastle programme; but he was unable to suggest in&nbsp;what direction it should be reformed. Sir William Harcourt&nbsp;and Mr John Morley, on the other hand, concentrated respectively upon Local Option and Home Rule. The Liberals were&nbsp;quarrelling among themselves, and the result was an overwhelming defeat. In Opposition Lord Rosebery was now at a&nbsp;serious disadvantage as head of a parliamentary party; for in&nbsp;any case he could not rally them as a loyally followed leader in&nbsp;the House of Commons might have done. But his followers&nbsp;were not all loyal, and his rivals in leadership were themselves&nbsp;in the House of Commons. Added to this there was still in tbe&nbsp;background the veteran statesman to whom Liberalism owed&nbsp;an unequalled obligation. When the <sup>u</sup> Armenian atrocities ”&nbsp;became a burning question in the country in 1896, and Mr&nbsp;Gladstone himself emerged from his retirement to advocate&nbsp;intervention, Lord Rosebery’s difficulties had taken their final&nbsp;form. He declined to support this demand at the risk of a&nbsp;European war, and on the 8th of October 1896 he announced&nbsp;to the Liberal whip, Mr Thomas Ellis, his resignation of the&nbsp;Liberal leadership. On the following day he made a farewell&nbsp;speech at the Empire Theatre, Edinburgh, to over four thousand&nbsp;people, and for some time he held aloof from party politics,&nbsp;“ ploughing his furrow alone,” as he afterwards phrased it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1898, on the death of Mr Gladstone, he paid a noble and eloquent tribute in the House of Lords to the life and public&nbsp;services of his old leader. He was a pall-bearer at his funeral&nbsp;on the 28th of May, as he had previously been at the burials of&nbsp;Tennyson and Millais. His influence in the country was still a&nbsp;strong one on personal grounds, and he came forward now and&nbsp;again to give expression independently to popular feeling. In&nbsp;the autumn of 1898 he gave valuable support to the attitude&nbsp;taken up by Lord Salisbury upon the Fashoda question. He&nbsp;was indeed bound by consistency to withstand what his own&nbsp;government, by the words of Sir Edward Grey, had declared&nbsp;would be an unfriendly act on the part of France. Again, after&nbsp;Mr Kruger’s ultimatum in October 1899, Lord Rosebery spoke&nbsp;upon the necessity of the nation closing its ranks and supporting&nbsp;the government in the prosecution of war in South Africa.&nbsp;After Nicholson’s Nek he reiterated the resolution of tbe country&nbsp;“ to see this thing through.” Nevertheless, in a letter to Captain</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
