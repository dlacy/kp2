<p><label>RELICS</label>
in the Romiſh church, the remains of the bodies or clothes of ſaints or martyrs, and the in-ſtruments by which they were put to death, devoutly preſerved, in honour to their memory ; kiſſed, revered, and carried in proceſſion.</p><p>The reſpect which was juſtly due to the martyrs and teachers of the Chriſtian faith, in a few ages increaſed almoſt to adoration ; and at length adoration was really paid both to departed ſaints and to relics of holy men or holy things.. The abuſes of the church of Rome, with reſpect to relics, are very flagrant and notorious. For ſuch was the rage for them at one time, that, as F. Mabillon a Benedictine juſtly complains, the altars were loaded with ſuſpected relics ; numerous ſpurious ones being everywhere offered to the piety and devotion of the faithful. He adds, too, that bones are often conſecrated, which, ſo far from belonging to ſaints, probably do not belong to Chriſtians. From the catacombs numerous relics have been taken,, and yet it is</p><p>not known who were the perſons interred therein. In the nth century, relics were tried by fire, and thofe which did not conſume were reckoned genuine, and the reſt not. Relics were, and ſtill are, preſerved on the altars whereon maſs is celebrated ; a ſquare hole being made in the middle of the altar, big enough to re-ceive the hand, and herein is the relic depoſited, be-ing firſt wrapped in red ſilk, and incloſed in a leaden box.</p><p>The Romaniſts plead antiquity in behalf of relics : For the Manichees, out of hatred to the fleſh, which they conſidered as an evil principle, refuſed to,honour the relics of ſaints ; which is reckoned a kind of proof that the Catholics did it in the firſt ages.</p><p>we know, indeed, that the touching of linen cloths on relics, from an opinion of ſome extraordinary virtue derived therefrom, was as ancient as th¢ firſt ages, there being a hole made in the coffins of the 40 martyrs at Conſtantinople expreſsly for this purpoſe. The honouring the relics of ſaints, on which the church of Rome afterwards founded her ſuperſtitious and lucrative uſe of them, as objects of devotion, as a kind of charms or amulets, and as inſtruments of pretended miracles, appears to have originated in a very ancient cuſtom, that prevailed among Chriſtians, of affembling at the cemeteries or burying-places of the martyrs, for the purpoſe of commemorating them, and of performing divine worſhip. when the profeffion of Chriſtianity obtained the protection of the civil government, under Conſtantine the Great, ſtately churches were erected over their ſepulchres, and their names and memories were treated with every poffible token of affection and reſpect. This reverence, however, gradually exceeded all reaſonable bounds ; and thoſe prayers and religious ſervices were thought to have a peculiar ſanctity and virtue, which were performed over their tombs. Hence the practice which afterwards obtained, of depofiting relics of ſaints and martyrs under the altars in all churches. This practice was then thought of ſuch importance, that St Ambroſe would not conſecrate a-church becauſe it had no relics ; and the council of Conſtantinople in Trullo ordained, that thoſe altars· ſhonld be demoliſhed under which there were found no relics. The rage of procuring relics for this and other purpoſes of a ſimilar nature, became ſo exceffive, that in 386 the emperor Theodofius the Great was obliged to paſs a law, forbidding the pcople to dig up the bo-dies of the martyrs, and to traffic in their relics.</p><p>Such was the origin of that reſpect for ſacred relics», which afterwards was perverted into a formal worſhip of them, and became the occafion of innumerable pro-ceffions, pilgrimages, and miracles, from which the church of Rome hath derived incredible advantage.— In the end of the ninth century, it was not ſufficient to reverence departed ſaints, and to confide in their inter-ceffions and ſuccours, to clothe them with an imaginary power of healing diſeaſes, working miracles, and delivering from all forts of calamities and dangers ; their bones, their clothes, the apparel and furniture they had poffeffed during their lives, the very ground which they had touched, or in which their putrified carcaſes were laid, were treated with a ſtupid veneration, and ſuppoſed to retain the marvellous virtue of healing all diſorders both of body and mind, and of defending ſuch as pof-ſeffed them againſt all the aſſaults and devices of the de-</p>

<p>vil. The confequence of all this was, that every one was eager to provide himſelf with theſe ſalutary reme-dies ; conſequently, great numbers undertook fatiguing and perilous voyages, and ſubjected themſelves to all ſorts of hardſhips ; while others made uſe of this delu-fion to accumulate their riches, and to impofe upon the miſerable multitude by the moſt impious and ſhocking inventions. As the demand for relics was prodigious and univerſal, the clergy employed the utmoſt dex-terity to ſatisfy all demands, and were far from being nice in the methods they uſed for that end. The bo-dies of the ſaints were fought by faſting and prayer, in-ſtituted by the prieſt in order to obtain a divine anſwer and an infallible direction, and this pretended direction never failed to accompliſh their deſires ; the holy car-cafe was always found, and that always in conſequence, as they impiouſly gave out, of the ſuggeſtion and infpi-ration of God himſelf. Each difcovery of this kind was attended with exceffive demonſtrations of joy, and animated the zeal of thefe devout feekers to enrich the church ſtill more and more with this new kind of trea-ſure. Many travelled with this view into the Eaſtern provinces, and frequented the places which Chriſt and his diſciples had honoured with their preſence, that, with the bones and other ſacred remains of the firſt he-ralds of the goſpel, they might comfort dejected minds, ■calm trembling confciences, fave finking ſtates, and de-fend their inhabitants from all forts of calamities. Nor did thefe pious travellers return home empty ; the craft, dexterity, and knavery of the Greeks, found a rich prey in the ſtupid credulity of the Latin relic-hunters, and made a profitable commerce of this new devotion. The latter paid conſiderable ſums for legs and arms, ikulls and jaw-bones (ſeveral of which were Pagan, and ſome not human), and other things that were ſuppoſed to have belonged to the primitive worthies of the Chriſtian church ; and thus the Latin churches came to the poſſeſſion of thoſe celebrated relics of St Mark, St James, St Bartholomew, Cyprian, Pan-taleon, and other?, which they ſhow at this day with fo much oſtentation. But there were many who, un-able to procure for themſelves theſe ſpiritual treaſures by voyages and prayers, had recourſe to violence and theft ; for all ſorts of means, and all forts of attempts in a cauſe of this nature, were conſidered, when fucceſs-ful, as pious and acceptable to the Supreme Being.— Beſides the arguments from antiquity to which the Pa-piſts refer, in vindication of their worſhip of relics, of which the reader may form ſome judgment from this article, Bellarmine appeals to Scripture in ſupport of it, and cites the following paſſages, viz. Exod. xiii. 19. ; Deut. xxxiv. 6. ; 2 Kings xiii. 21. ; 2 Kings xxiii. 16, 17, 18.; Iſaiah xi. 10. ; Matthewxi. 20, 21, 22. ; Acts v. 12- 15. ; Acts xix. ii, 12. See Popery.</p><p>The Roman Catholics in Great Britain do not ac-knowledge any worſhip to be due to relics, but merely a high veneration and reſpe i, by which means they think they honour God, who, they ſay, has often wrought very extraordinary miracles by them. But, however proper this veneration and reſpect may be, its abuſe has been ſo great and ſo general, as fully to war-rant the rejection of them altogether.</p><p>Relics are forbidden to be uſed or brought into England by ſeveral ſtatutes ; and juſtices oſ peace are empowered to ſearch houles for popiſh books and relics,</p><p>which, when found, are to be defaced and burnt, &amp;c, 3 Jac. I. cap. 26.</p>
