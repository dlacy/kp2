<p><span class="font0">ROTHBURY, a small market-town in the county of Northumberland, pleasantly situated on the northern side of&nbsp;the river Coquet, over which there is a handsome stone&nbsp;bridge. The town consists of three wide and airy streets;&nbsp;and as the situation, from being screened by lofty hills from&nbsp;the north and east winds, is favourable to invalids, and the&nbsp;Coquet is well adapted for trout-fishing, many persons resort&nbsp;thither during the summer months, for health and amusement. The rectory is one of the richest livings in the&nbsp;county. The church is an ancient structure. The population in 1831 amounted to 1014.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTHENBURG, a city of the kingdom of Bavaria, and the capital of the bailiwick of the same name, in the circle&nbsp;of the Rezat. It is situated on the river Tauber, and is&nbsp;surrounded by ancient walls and thirty-three towers. It is&nbsp;built in the antique German style, comprehends a fine&nbsp;council-house, with eight churches, and contains 1160&nbsp;houses, with 6400 inhabitants. Its chief trade is in the productions of its vicinity. Long. 11. 43. E. Lat. 49. 30. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rothenburg, a city of the kingdom of Wirtemburg, in the circle of the Black Forest, and the capital of a bailiwick of its own name. It is situated on the river Neckar,&nbsp;which divides it into two parts, of which that on the left&nbsp;bank was formerly a distinct city called Ehingen. It is the&nbsp;seat of the Catholic hierarchy of the whole kingdom, with six&nbsp;churches of that sect, and contains 620 houses, with 5450&nbsp;inhabitants. It has some trade in paper, leather, and breweries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTHENFELS, a town of the kingdom of Bavaria, in the circle of the Lower Maine, and in a patrimonial bailiwick of the mediatized prince Lowenstein. It extends&nbsp;over eighty-four square miles, inhabited by 8500 persons.&nbsp;The town is situated on the river Maine, and contains 240&nbsp;houses, with 1520 inhabitants, who are chiefly occupied in&nbsp;the cultivation of vines, and in making wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTHERHAM, a market-town of the west riding of the county of York, in the wapentake of Stratforth and&nbsp;Tickhill, 158 miles from London, and six from Sheffield.&nbsp;It is situated at the conflux of the rivers Rother and Don,&nbsp;which are navigable to Hull. There is a good market, which&nbsp;is held on Thursday. It is a considerable place for iron manufactures of the heavier kind. The population of the town&nbsp;amounted in 1801 to 3070, in 1811 to 2950, in 1821 to&nbsp;3548, and in 1831 to 4083; but the parish contains eight&nbsp;other townships or hamlets, and the whole inhabitants,&nbsp;amounted in 1831 to 10,417.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTHSAY, a town in the island and county of Bute, in Scotland. See Bute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTHWELL, or sometimes called Rowell, a town of the county of Northampton, in the hundred of the same&nbsp;name, seventy-nine miles from London. It has lost its market. The population amounted in 1801 to 1409, in 1811&nbsp;to 1451, in 1821 to 1742, and in 1831 to 1875.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTONDO, or Rotundo, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Architecture,</span><span class="font0"> an appellation given to any building that is round both within and without, whether it be a church, a saloon, or the like. The&nbsp;most celebrated rotundo of the ancients is the Pantheon at&nbsp;Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTTERDAM, a city of the kingdom of Holland, and the capital of the circle of its own name. It is situated on&nbsp;the right bank of the river Maese, which here receives the&nbsp;waters of the river Rotte. It is a well-built city, in an antique style, with abundance of fine and large houses, many&nbsp;of them five or six stories in height. The Boomjee, a row of&nbsp;houses facing the river, with a broad quay between, planted&nbsp;with trees, is perhaps one of the finest promenades in Europe. The city is intersected with canals, and by means&nbsp;of them the goods from ships are brought to the warehouses of the merchants, which are at the backs of their&nbsp;houses ; and by the same means the productions intended&nbsp;for exportation are brought to the several places of deposit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The markets also are supplied from the country by means of these canals; and on the market-days, instead of the&nbsp;roads being filled with carts and waggons, the canals are&nbsp;crowded with country barges. These barges are drawn .&nbsp;more by men than horses, and indeed horses are rarely&nbsp;seen in the streets. Many of the public buildings are of a&nbsp;magnificent appearance. Amongst these, that of the defunct East India Company, now added to the customhouse,&nbsp;may be viewed with admiration. The house of the assembly of the ancient states of Zealand was built at an early&nbsp;period of the establishment of the independence of the&nbsp;United States. It is spacious, being in the most sumptuous&nbsp;style of the architecture of that age ; and when Bonaparte&nbsp;assumed the sovereignty of the country, it was decorated&nbsp;and furnished for his residence at the expense of the city.&nbsp;The ancient stadthouse has been appropriated to other than&nbsp;its original purpose ; atad a new modern building has been&nbsp;erected, whose portico, although massive, is elegant, as far&nbsp;as regards the pillars that support it. The ecclesiastical&nbsp;buildings belonging to the Calvinists are the most ancient&nbsp;and the largest, particularly the church of St Lawrence.&nbsp;It has an organ, lately erected, of the greatest power of&nbsp;any in existence, and said to contain eight hundred pipes&nbsp;more than the celebrated organ of Harlem. The Lutheran church is a large and fine building. There are three&nbsp;churches where the service is in English ; one for the Episcopalian, one for the Kirk of Scotland, and one for Independents, in the latter of which the celebrated Hugh Peters once officiated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The trade of Rotterdam is very extensive. That to the West Indies, has declined of late years, but that to the East&nbsp;Indies, chiefly to Batavia, has been recently very beneficial ; and its commerce for the last fifteen years has increased more rapidly than that of any town in the kingdom.&nbsp;The fishery is an extensive source of employment and&nbsp;wealth. The trade with the Baltic employs much shipping,&nbsp;and affords moderate-priced corn for the distillers of gin.&nbsp;The business of ship-building employs many persons, both&nbsp;in the government arsenal and in the private docks; and&nbsp;the vessels now built are admirably constructed and equipped. The supply of colonial produce to the interior of&nbsp;Germany by the Rhine is very beneficial. The population&nbsp;of the city amounted in 1832 to 72,294. Long. 4. 29.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">14.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">E. Lat. 51. 55. 9. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTTINGDEAN, a village of the county of Sussex, in the hundred of Youngsmere, and rape of Lewes, fifty-six&nbsp;miles from London, and four from Brighton. It is situated&nbsp;on the sea-shore, between two cliffs, and is much resorted&nbsp;to in the summer season by bathing visitors who wish for&nbsp;retirement. The population amounted in 1801 to 543, in&nbsp;1811 to 559, in 1821 to 772, and in 1831 to 880.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUBAIX, a large market-town of France, in the department of the North, and the arrondissement of Lisle. It is a place of extensive manufactories, formerly of woollens,&nbsp;but of late years almost exclusively of cottons. There are&nbsp;several mills for spinning; and a great quantity of quiltings,&nbsp;dimities, nankeens, and other cotton articles, are made, and&nbsp;of good quality. The town, in 1836, contained 18,187 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUEN, an arrondissement of the department of the Lower Seine, in France. It extends over 506 square miles,&nbsp;and comprehends fifteen cantons, divided into 155 communes, which, in 1836, contained 238,805 inhabitants. The&nbsp;capital is the city of the same name, situated in a valley on&nbsp;the banks of the Seine, over which there is a bridge of boats&nbsp;leading to the suburb St Sever. The river Robec passes&nbsp;through a part of the city, and falls into the Seine, and in&nbsp;its progress gives power to several mills and other machinery. It is not a well-built town, having many large but antique houses, and others of wood, with narrow and crooked&nbsp;streets. It is the see of an archbishop, whose cathedral, as</span></p>
