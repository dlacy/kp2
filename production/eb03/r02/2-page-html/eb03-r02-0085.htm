<p><span class="font0">ROBBERY, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rapina</span><span class="font0"> of the civilians, is the felonious and forcible taking, ſrom the perſon of another, of goods or money to any value, by violence or putting&nbsp;him in fear. 1. There muſt be a taking, otherwiſe it&nbsp;is no robbery. A mere attempt to rob was indeed&nbsp;held to be felony ſo late as Henry IVth’s time ; but&nbsp;afterwards it was taken to be only a miſdemeanour,&nbsp;and puniſhabie with fine and impriſonment ; till the&nbsp;ſtatute 7 Geo. II. c. 21. which makes it a felony&nbsp;(tranſportable for {'even years) unlawfully and malici-ouſly to aſſault another, with any offenſive weapon or&nbsp;inſtrument ;—or by menaces, or by other forcible or&nbsp;violent manner, to demand any money or goods ; — with&nbsp;a felonious intent to rob. If the thief, having once&nbsp;taken a purſe, returns it, ſtill it is a robbery : and ſo</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">it is whether the taking be ſtrictly from the perſon of another, or in his preſence only ; as where a robber&nbsp;by menaces and violence puts a man in fear, and drives&nbsp;away his lheep or his cattle before his face. 2. It is&nbsp;immaterial of what value the thing taken is: ä penny,&nbsp;as well as a pound thus forcibly extorted, makes a&nbsp;robbery. 3. Laſtly, the taking muſt be by force, or&nbsp;a previous putting in fear ; which makes the violation&nbsp;of the perſon more atrocious than privately ſtealing.&nbsp;For, according to the maxim of the civil law, “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">qui vi&nbsp;rapuit, fur improbior ejſe videtur.<sup>f,</sup></span><span class="font0"> This previous violence, or putting in fear, is the criterion that diſtinguiſh-cs robbery ſrom other larcenies. For if one privately&nbsp;ſteals ſixpence from the perſon of another, and afterwards keeps it by putting him in fear, this is no robbery, for the fear is ſubſequent : «either is it capital&nbsp;as privately ſtealing, being under the value of twelve-pence. Not that it is indeed neceſſary, though uſual,&nbsp;to lay in the indictment that the robbery was committed by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">putting in feα<sup>r</sup> :</span><span class="font0"> it is ſufficient, if laid to be done&nbsp;by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">violence.</span><span class="font0"> And when it is laid to be done by putting&nbsp;in ſear, this does not imply any great degree of terror&nbsp;<sup>f</sup>∙or affright in the party robbed : it is enough that ſo&nbsp;much force or threatening, by word or geſture, be uſed,&nbsp;&quot;as might create an apprehenſion of danger, or induce a&nbsp;man to part with his property without or againſt his&nbsp;confient. Thus, if a man be knocked down without&nbsp;previous warning, and ſtripped of his property while&nbsp;ſenſeleſs, though ſtrictly he cannot be ſaid to be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">put in&nbsp;jeαr<sub>y</sub>-</span><span class="font0"> yet this is undoubtedly a robbery. Or, if a per</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">ſon with a ſword drawn begs an alms, and I give it him through miſtruſt and apprehenſion of violence, this is a&nbsp;felonious robbery. So if, under a pretence of ſale, a&nbsp;man forcibly extorts money ſrom another, neither ſhall&nbsp;this ſubterfuge avail him. But it is doubted, whether&nbsp;the forcing a higler, or other chapman, to ſell his wares,&nbsp;and giving him the full value of them, amounts to ſo&nbsp;heinous a crime as robbery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This ſpecies of larceny is debarred of the benefit of clergy by ſtatute 23 Hen. VIII. c. 1. and other&nbsp;ſubſequent ſtatutes ; not indeed in general, but only&nbsp;when committed in a dwelling-houſe, or in or near the&nbsp;king’s highway. A robbery therefore in a diſtant&nbsp;field, or footpath, was not puniſhed with death ; but&nbsp;was open to the benefit of clergy, till the ſtatute 3&nbsp;&amp; 4 W. and M. c. 9. which takes away clergy from&nbsp;both principals and acceſſories before the fact, in robbery, whereſoever committed.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robert, king of France, ſurnamed the Wiſe and the Pious, came to the crown in 996, aſtet the death&nbsp;of Hugh Capet his father. He was crowned at Orleans,&nbsp;the place of his nativity, and afterwards at Rheims, after the impriſonment of Charles of Lorraine. He married Bertha his couſin, daughter of Conrad king of&nbsp;Burgundy ; but the marriage was declared null by Gregory V. ; and the king, if we can give credit to cardinal Peter Damien, was excommunicated. This anathema made ſuch a noiſe in France, that all the king’s&nbsp;courteſans, and even his very domeſtics, went away&nbsp;from him. Only two continued with him ; who were ſo&nbsp;deeply impreſſed with a ſenſe of horror at whatever the&nbsp;king touched, that they purified it with fire : this ſcruple&nbsp;they carried ſo ſar, as to the very plates on which he&nbsp;was ſerved with his meat, and the veſſels out of which&nbsp;he drank. The ſame cardinal reports, that as a puniſh-ment for this pretended inceſt, the queen was delivered&nbsp;of a monſter, which had the head and neck of a duck&nbsp;He adds, that Robert was ſo ſtruck with aſtoniſhment&nbsp;at this ſpecies of prodigy, that he lived apart from the&nbsp;queen. He contracted a ſecond marriage with Confiance, daughter of λVilliam count of Arles and Provence ; but the arrogant diſpoſition of this princeſs&nbsp;would have totally overturned the kingdom, and thrown&nbsp;it into confuſion, had not the wiſdom of the king prevented her from intermeddling with the affairs of the&nbsp;ſtate. He carefully concealed from her whatever acts&nbsp;of liberality he ſhowed to any of his domeſtics. “ Take&nbsp;care (ſaid he to them) that the queen don’t perceive&nbsp;it.”— Henry duke of Burgundy, brother of Hugh Capet, dying in 1002, without lawful iſſue, leſt his dukedom to his nephew the king of France. Robert in-veiled his ſecond ſon Henry with this dukedom, who&nbsp;afterwards coming to the crown, reſigned it in favour&nbsp;of Robert his cadet. This duke Robert was chief ot&nbsp;the firſt royal branch of the dukes of Burgundy, who&nbsp;fiouriſhed till 1361. This dukedom was then re united&nbsp;to the crown by king John, who gave it to his fourth&nbsp;ſon Philip the Bold, chief of the ſecond houſe of Burgundy, wl√dι was terminated in the perſon of Charles&nbsp;the Raih, who was ſlain in ∣477.
