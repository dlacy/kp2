<p><label>RICHTER, ADRIAN LUDWIG</label>
(1803-1884), German painter and etcher, was born at Dresden in 1803, the son of the engraver Karl August Richter, from whom he received his training; but he was strongly influenced by Erhard and Chodowiecki. He was the most popular, and in many ways the most typicaI German illustrator of the middle of the 19th century. His work is as typically German and homely as are the fairy-tales of Grimm. Richter visited Italy from 1823-26, and his “ Thunderstorm in the Sabine Mountains ” at the Staedel Institute in Frankfort is one of the rare Italian subjects from his brush. In 1828 he worked as designer for the Meissen factory, and in 1841 he became professor and head of the landscape atelier at the Dresden Academy. The Dresden Gallery owns one of his best and most characteristic paintings in the “ Bridal Procession in a Spring Landscape.” He died at Loschwitz near Dresden in 1884.</p>
