A space of about half an inch is left between them and the balk timber placed beneath them, as it is not intended that the ship should bear on these balk timbers in launching, but merely be supported by them in the event of her heeling over. The ship, therefore, is launched wholly on the sliding-plank<hi rend="italic"> c</hi>, fitted under the keel.</p><p>If a ship is coppered before launching, so that putting her into a dry-dock for that purpose becomes unnecessary, it is then desirable that she should be launched without any cleats attached to her bottom. The two sides of the cradle are prevented from being forced apart when the weight of the ship is brought upon them by chains passing under the keel. Each portion of frame-work composing the launch has two of these chains attached to it, and brought under the keel to a bolt which passes slackly through one of the poppets, and is secured by a long forelock, with an iron handle, reaching above the water-line, so that when the ship is afloat it may be drawn out of the bolt. The chain then draws the bolt, and in falling trips the cradle from under the bottom. There should be at least two chains on each side secured to the fore-poppets, two on each side secured to the after-poppets, and two on each side to the stopping-up, and this only for the launch of a small ship ; in larger ships the number will necessarily be increased according to the weight of the vessel and the tendency that she may have, according to her form, to separate the bilgeways. This tendency on the part of a sharp ship by a rising floor, or by her wedge- shaped form in the fore and after bodies, is great, but there is not much probability of a ship heeling over to one side or the other.</p><p>The importance of the work of the designer cannot be too highly estimated. Unfortunately there is, as has been said, “slop work ” in designing as well as in putting the structure together. There is often an absence of any attempt at precautions where multiplied accidents have shown them to be necessary, as well as inconceivable carelessness in the details rendering provisions for security, where they exist in principle, useless in practice.</p><p>In the <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> of the Royal Commission on Unseaworthy Ships, dated September 22, 1873, we read as follows :—“Competent witnesses state that many merchant ships are built with bad iron, that they are ill put together, and sent to sea in a defective condition. It is also said that they are frequently lengthened without additional strength, and are consequently weak ships. The number of iron steamers which have been lost in the last few years, many of them having been surveyed and classed under the London or Liverpool registers, raises a question whether the regulations of these registers are sufficiently stringent to insure good shipbuilding. The directors of the Bureau Veritas have deemed it necessary to revise the rules of their register, and to increase the scantling. In the race of competition among shipbuilders it is probable that inferior materials and bad workmanship are admitted into ships.”</p><p>The Commissioners on Unseaworthy Ships, referring to the proposal that the Board of Trade should superintend the construction, the periodical inspection, the repair, and the loading of all British merchant ships, said: “We consider it to be a question worthy of serious consideration, whether, in the case of passenger ships, the certificate of the Board of Trade, so far as regards specific approval, should not be expressly confined to the number of passengers to be allowed and to the accommodation for their health, comfort, and general security,—all questions of unseaworthiness of hull, machinery, and equipment being left to the owners, subject only to a general power of interference</p><p>in case of danger sufficiently apparent to justify special intervention.”</p><p>Where ships have to meet the stress of battle as well as that of the sea faithfulness of work is even more imperative. It is not only necessary to have perfect work, but there must also be multiplied safeguards and provisions against damage by shot, shell, ram, and torpedo as well as against the enemies which are common to all ships. In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Navy</hi> the peculiarities of the ship of war are described. Regarding them here simply as ships, they may be said to be distinguished neither by size nor speed. They have been far outstripped in size, the longest English ship of war built within the last twenty years being only 325 feet in length, while there are Atlantic passenger ships 200 feet longer. They have also been outstripped in speed. The highest speed ever attained in a vessel of war is that of the “ Iris ” and “ Mercury”; and as they are only 300 feet long it is easier in vessels of greater length to get higher speeds with less engine power, and easy also to maintain it in a seaway both as a question of form and power, and also as a matter of coal endurance.

It must, however, be premised that the war ship has the weight of hull kept down to a very low standard to enable her to carry her offensive and defensive equipment,—far lower than is usual in the merchant ship. The first-class merchant ship costs £28 per ton weight of hull and about £13 per indicated horse-power for the engines. The ship of war built by the same builders under contract with the Government costs from £60 to £65 per ton weight of hull for unarmoured ships, and from £70 to £75 or more for armoured ships. In the case of an unarmoured vessel, having a protecting deck over machinery and magazines, recently ordered, the prices were as follows :—</p><p>General average	£60 10 0 per ton weight of hull.</p><p>Average of three London firms.	66	0	0	,,	,,</p><p>Accepted tender	 57	6	0	,,	,,</p><p>The engines for the same vessel were :—</p><p>General average	£15	8	0	per I.H.
