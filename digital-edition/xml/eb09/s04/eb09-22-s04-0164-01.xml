The discovery that Smart was anything more than an unfortunate Bohemian of letters who wrote much uninteresting verse of second-rate 18th-century quality is quite recent. After one or another of his superseded translations or ineffective exercises in heroics had in turn been assigned the place of honour as his representative literary work, his real masterpiece was discerned in a poem which, except for a reprint issued in 1819, had been singularly overlooked, and even omitted from the collected editions of his poetry. The history of this poem, <hi rend="italic">A Song to David,</hi> is somewhat remarkable. It was written in the saner moments of confinement for a fit of insanity, and was, it is said, on not unimpeachable authority perhaps, indented with an iron nail or a key on the wall of the cell in default of other means of writing. The real facts of the case would seem to be that the unfortunate poet inscribed one or two stanzas in the manner asserted, and that he either dictated or was given the materials wherewith to write the rest of the poem.</p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s04-0165" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0181.jp2"/><p>There is no internal evidence of any morbid origin, however, for the poem is full of a healthy and virile energy. As a boy he was delicate and precocious, with a facile gift of verse, which already won him a certain notoriety, of not the best effect haply, at Durham school, whither he had been sent on leaving a preparatory school at Maidstone. During a holiday visit to Raby castle his boyish gifts attracted the interest of the duchess of Cleveland, who made him an allowance of £40 a year, which was continued until her death, and which possibly served further to weaken his self-reliance. At Cambridge, where he was entered at Pembroke Hall in 1739, he led a rather dissipated life, getting heavily into debt, and, while he easily excelled in certain congenial branches of study, he paid little attention to the usual college routine. In spite of his irregularities, he was made a fellow of his college in 1745, and at a later date won the newly instituted Seaton prize for an English poem,—the subject each year being one of “the attributes of the Supreme Being.” Smart gained this prize five times in all. Resorting then to London and marrying there a daughter-in-law of Newbery, the publisher, the poet attempted to make a living by literary hack-work and journalism, but sank gradually into difficulties through his improvident and dissipated habits, so that his wife and children were at last obliged to leave him. His misfortunes seem to have culminated in the fit of insanity associated with <hi rend="italic">A Song to David,</hi> which was published in 1763, and in 1771 Smart died from the effects of poverty and disease.</p><p>Amid all his miseries Smart must have been fairly industrious if his journalistic work was at all proportionate to his more substantial literary productions. Of all that he wrote, however, <hi rend="italic">A Song to David</hi> will alone bear the test of time. Unlike in its simple forceful treatment and impressive directness of expression, as has been said, to anything else in 18th-century poetry, the poem on analysis is found to depend for its unique effect also upon a certain ingenuity of construction, and the novel way in which David’s ideal qualities are enlarged upon. This will be more readily understood on reference to the following verse, the first twelve words of which become in turn the key-notes, so to speak, of the twelve succeeding verses :—</p><p>“ Great, valiant, pious, good, and clean,</p><p>Sublime, contemplative, serene,</p><p>Strong, constant, pleasant, wise!</p><p>Bright effluence of exceeding grace ;</p><p>Best man !—the swiftness, and the race,</p><p>The peril, and the prize.”</p><p>The last line is characteristic of another peculiarity in <hi rend="italic">A Song to David,</hi> the effective use of alliteration to complete the initial energy of the stanza in many instances. But in the poem throughout is revealed a poetic quality which eludes critical analysis and gives its writer an exceptional interest hardly maintained by his other works.</p><p><hi rend="italic">A Song to David</hi> is found in somewhat shortened form in Ward's <hi rend="italic">English Poets,</hi> vol. iii., and Smart’s other poems are given in Anderson’s <hi rend="italic">British Poets (1794),</hi> vol. xi., which contains also a full account of his life.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
