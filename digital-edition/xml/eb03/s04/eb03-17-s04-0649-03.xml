(Ezekiel), a learned writer in the 17th century, was born at Geneva in 1629; and in 1642 went to Leyden to ſtudy. Here he diſtinguiſhed himſelf to great advantage ; and his reputation ſpreading, Charles Louis elector palatine ſent for him to be tutor to his only ſon. This taſk our author diſcharged to the entire ſatisfaction of the elector ; by whom he was alſo employed in divers negotiations at foreign courts. He afterwards entered into the ſervice of the elector of Brandenburg, who in 1680 ſent him envoy-extraordinary to the court of France, and ſoon after made him a miniſter of ſtate. After the peace of Ryswic, he was again ſent on an embaſſy to France, where he continued from the year 1697 to 1702. The elector of Brandenburg having during that interval aſſumed the title of <hi rend="italic">King of Pruſſia,</hi> conferred on him the title and dignity of a baron. In 1702 he left France ; and went ambaſſador to England, where he had been ſeveral times. Here he died in 1710, aged 81 years. It is ſurpriſing, that in diſcharging the duties of a public miniſter with ſo much exactneſs, and amidſt ſo many different journeys, he could find time enough to write the ſeveral books publiſhed by him. It may be said of him, that he acquitted himſelf in his negotiations like a perſon who had nothing elſe in his thoughts ; and that he wrote like a man who had ſpent his whole time in his ſtudy. The principal of his works are,</p><p>I. <hi rend="italic">De praestantia et uſu numismatum anti quorum ;</hi> the beſt edition of which is in two volumes folio. 2. Several letters or dissertations on ſcarce and curious medals. 3. A preface and notes to the edition of the emperor Julian’s works, printed at Leipſic in 1696, folio.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
