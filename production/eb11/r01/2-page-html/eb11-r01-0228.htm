<p><span class="font1">dissolute and lazy monks. Scholars, like Colet, read the New Testament in Greek and lectured on justification by faith before&nbsp;they knew of Luther, and More included among the institutions&nbsp;of Utopia a rather more liberal and enlightened religion than&nbsp;that which he observed around him. Erasmus was read and&nbsp;approved, and his notion of reform by culture no doubt attracted&nbsp;many adherents among English scholars. Luther’s works found&nbsp;their way into England, and were read and studied at both&nbsp;Oxford and Cambridge. In May 1521 Wolsey attended a pompous burning of Lutheran tracts in St Paul’s churchyard, where&nbsp;Bishop Fisher preached ardently against the new German heresy.&nbsp;Henry VIII. himself stoutly maintained the headship of the pope,&nbsp;and, as is well known, after examining the arguments of Luther,&nbsp;published his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Defence of the Seven Sacraments</span><span class="font1"> in 1521, which won&nbsp;for him from the pope the glorious title of “ Defender of the Faith.”&nbsp;The government and the leading men of letters and prelates&nbsp;appear therefore to have harboured no notions of revolt before&nbsp;the matter of the king’s divorce became prominent in 1527.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Henry’s elder brother Arthur, a notoriously sickly youth of scarce fifteen, had been married to Catherine, daughter of&nbsp;Ferdinand and Isabella, but had died less than five&nbsp;months after the marriage (April 1502), leaving&nbsp;doubts as to whether the union had ever been physically&nbsp; consummated. Political reasons dictated an&nbsp;affiance between the young widow and her brother-in-law Henry, prince of Wales, nearly five years her junior; Julius II.&nbsp;was induced reluctantly to grant the dispensation necessary on&nbsp;account of the relationship, which, according to the canon law&nbsp;and the current interpretation of Leviticus xviii. 16, stood in&nbsp;the way of the union. The wedding took place some years&nbsp;later (1509), and several children were born, none of whom&nbsp;survived except the princess Mary. By 1527 the king had&nbsp;become hopeless of having a male heir by Catherine. He was&nbsp;tired of her, and in love with the black-eyed Anne Boleyn, who&nbsp;refused to be his mistress. He alleged that he was beginning&nbsp;to have a horrible misgiving that his marriage with Catherine&nbsp;had been invalid, perhaps downright “ incestuous. ” The&nbsp;negotiations with Clement VII. with the hope of obtaining a&nbsp;divorce from Catherine, the reluctance of the pope to impeach&nbsp;the dispensation of his predecessor Julius II., and at the same&nbsp;time to alienate the English queen’s nephew Charles V., the&nbsp;futile policy of Wolsey and his final ruin in 1529 are described&nbsp;elsewhere (see English History; Henry VIII.; Catherine&nbsp;of Aragon). The king’s agents secured the opinion of a number&nbsp;of prominent universities that his marriage was void, and an&nbsp;assembly of notables, which he summoned in June 1530, warned&nbsp;the pope of the dangers involved in leaving the royal succession&nbsp;in uncertainty, since the heir was not only a woman, but, as it</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">seemed to many, of illegitimate birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Henry’s next move was to bring a monstrous charge against the clergy, accusing them of having violated the ancient laws&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praemunire</span><span class="font1"> in submitting to the authority of papal&nbsp;legates (although he himself had ratified the appointment of Wolsey as legate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a latere).</span><span class="font1"> The clergy of the&nbsp;province of Canterbury were fined £100,000 and compelled to declare the king “ their singular protector and&nbsp;only supreme lord, and, as far as that is permitted by the law&nbsp;of Christ, the supreme head of the Church and of the clergy.”&nbsp;This the king claimed, perhaps with truth, was only a clearer&nbsp;statement of the provisions of earlier English laws. The&nbsp;following year, 1532, parliament presented a petition to the king&nbsp;(which had been most carefully elaborated by the monarch’s&nbsp;own advisers) containing twelve charges against the bishops,&nbsp;relating to their courts, fees, injudicious appointments and&nbsp;abusive treatment of heretics, which combined to cause an&nbsp;unprecedented and “ marvellous disorder of the godly quiet,&nbsp;peace and tranquillity” of the realm. For the remedy of&nbsp;these abuses parliament turned to the king, “ in whom and by&nbsp;whom the only and sole redress, reformation and remedy herein&nbsp;absolutely rests and remains.” The ordinaries met these&nbsp;accusations with a lengthy and dignified answer; but this did&nbsp;not satisfy the king, and convocation was compelled on the&nbsp;15th of May 1532, further to clarify the ancient laws of the&nbsp;land, as understood by the king, in the very brief, very humble&nbsp;and very pertinent document known as the “ Submission of&nbsp;the Clergy.” Herein the king’s “ most humble subjects daily&nbsp;orators, and bedesmen ” of the clergy of England, in view of&nbsp;his goodness and fervent Christian zeal and his learning far&nbsp;exceeding that of all other kings that they have read of, agree&nbsp;never to assemble in convocation except at the king’s summons,&nbsp;and to enact and promulgate no constitution or ordinances&nbsp;except they receive the royal assent and authority. Moreover,&nbsp;the existing canons are to be subjected to the examination&nbsp;of a commission appointed by the king, half its members from&nbsp;parliament, half from the clergy, to abrogate with the king’s&nbsp;assent such provisions as the majority find do not stand with&nbsp;God’s laws and the laws of the realm. This appeared to place&nbsp;the legislation of the clergy, whether old or new, entirely under&nbsp;the monarch’s control. A few months later Thomas Cranmer,&nbsp;who had been one of those to discuss sympathetically Luther’s&nbsp;works in the little circle at Cambridge, and who believed the&nbsp;royal supremacy would tend to the remedying of grave abuses&nbsp;and that the pope had acted </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ultra vires</span><span class="font1"> in issuing a dispensation&nbsp;for the king’s marriage with Catherine, was induced by Henry&nbsp;to succeed Warham as archbishop of Canterbury. About the&nbsp;same time parliament passed an interesting and important&nbsp;statute, forbidding, unless the king should wish to suspend the&nbsp;operation of the law, the payment to the pope of the annates.&nbsp;This item alone amounted during the previous forty-six years,&nbsp;the parliament declared, “ at the least to eight score thousand&nbsp;pounds, besides other great and intolerable sums which have&nbsp;yearly been conveyed to the said court of Rome by many other&nbsp;ways and means to the great impoverishment of this realm.”&nbsp;The annates were thereafter to accrue to the king; and bishops&nbsp;and archbishops were thenceforth, in case the pope refused&nbsp;to confirm them,@@<sup>1</sup> to be consecrated and invested within the&nbsp;realm, “ in like manner as divers other archbishops and bishops&nbsp;have been heretofore in ancient times by sundry the king’s&nbsp;most noble progenitors.” No censures, excommunications or&nbsp;interdicts with which the Holy Father might vex or grieve&nbsp;the sovereign lord or his subjects, should be published or in&nbsp;any way impede the usual performance of the sacraments and&nbsp;the holding of the divine services. In February parliament&nbsp;discovered that “ by divers sundry old authentic histories&nbsp;and chronicles ” it was manifest that the realm of England&nbsp;was an empire governed by one supreme head, the king, to&nbsp;whom all sorts and degrees of people—both clergy and laity—&nbsp;ought to bear next to God a natural and humble obedience,&nbsp;and that to him God had given the authority finally to determine all causes and contentions in the realm, “ without&nbsp;restraint, or provocation to any foreign princes or potentates&nbsp;of the world.” The ancient statutes of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praemunire</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;provisors are recalled and the penalties attached to their&nbsp;violation re-enacted. All appeals were to be tried within the&nbsp;realm, and suits begun before an archbishop were to be determined&nbsp; by him without further appeal. Acting on this, Cranmer&nbsp;tried the divorce case before his court, which declared the&nbsp;marriage 'with Catherine void and that with Anne Boleyn,&nbsp;which had been solemnized privately in January, valid.&nbsp;The pope replied by ordering Henry under pain of excommunication to put away Anne and restore Catherine, his legal wife,&nbsp;within ten days. This sentence the emperor, all the Christian&nbsp;princes and the king’s own subjects were summoned to carry&nbsp;out by force of arms if necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As might have been anticipated, this caused no break in the policy of the English king and his parliament, and a series of&nbsp;famous acts passed in the year 1534 completed and&nbsp;confirmed the independence of the Church of England,&nbsp;which, except during five years under Queen Mary,&nbsp;was thereafter as completely severed from the papal&nbsp;monarchy as the electorate of Saxony or the duchy&nbsp;of Hesse. The payment of annates and of Peter’s pence</span></p>
