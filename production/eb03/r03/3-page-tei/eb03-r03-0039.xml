Attention to this theorem will point 'out what may be done ; and it is at all times proper, nay neceſſary, to know what are the preſſures in the points of ſupport. If we are ignorant of this, we ſhall run the riſk of our machine failing in thoſe parts; and our anxiety to prevent this will make υs load it with needleſs and ill-diſpoſed ſtrength. In the ordinary theories of machines, deduced entirely from the principles of equilibrium, the preſſure on the points of ſupport (exclufive of what proceeds from the weight of the machine itſelf) is ſtated as the ſanae as if the moving and refitting forces were applied immediately to theſe points in their own directions. But this is in all caſes erroneous; and, in caſes of ſwift motions, it is greatly ſo. We may be convinced of this by a very fimple inſtance.</p><p>Suppoſe a line laid over a pulley, and a pound weight at one end of it, and ten pounds at the 0ther5 the preſſure of the axis 011 its ſupport is eleven pounds, ac-ct rding to the uſual rule ; whereas we ſhall find it only 3<hi rend="sub">τ</hi><hi rend="sup">7</hi>y. For, if we call the radius of the pulley 1, the momentum of the moving force i⅞ιo×ι — 1χ1, " 9 ; and the momentum of inertia isιo×ι<hi rend="sup">2</hi>ff-f×ι<hi rend="sup">,</hi>. (n<hi rend="sup">c</hi> 18.) — 11. Therefore the angular velocity is -,-<hi rend="sup">y</hi><hi rend="sub">1</hi>. But the diſtance ÇG of the centre oſ gravity from the axis of motion ⅛&gt; alſo <hi rend="sub">1</hi><hi rend="sup">9</hi>,-, becauſe we may ſuppoſe the two weights in contact with the circumference of the pulley. Therefore the velocity of the centre oſ gravity is <hi rend="sub">τ</hi>-'∙<hi rend="sup">,</hi><hi rend="sub">1</hi> X ∙<hi rend="sub">1</hi><hi rend="sup">y</hi>,∙,    -<hi rend="sub">r</hi><hi rend="sup">8</hi><hi rend="sub">1</hi>∖ of its natural velocity.

This renders it proper to give ſome general propofitions, which enable us to compute this with eaſe.</p><p>It would be very convenient, for inſtance, to know ſome point in which we might ſuppoſe the whole rota tory part of the machine concentrated ; becauſe then we could at once tell what the momentum of its inertia is, and what force we muſt apply to the impelled point of the machine, in order to move it with the defiled velocity.</p><p>Let S, fig. 3. be this point of a body turning round the ſupported axis paſſing through C ; that is, let S be ſuch a point, that if all the matter of the body were collected there, a force applied at P will produce the ſame angular velocity as it would if applied at the fame-point of the body having its natural form.</p><p>The whole matter being collected at S, the expreſſion·.</p><p><hi rend="italic">rn.</hi>  G I.
