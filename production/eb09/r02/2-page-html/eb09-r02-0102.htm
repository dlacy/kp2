<p><span class="font1">RICHARD II. (1366-1400), king of England, the only son of Edward the Black Prince and Joan of Kent,&nbsp;was born at Bordeaux, April 13, 1366. He succeeded to&nbsp;the throne on the death of his grandfather Edward III., on&nbsp;June 21, 1377. He was crowned on July 16. During the&nbsp;first eleven years of his reign, Richard was in a position of&nbsp;tutelage. His uncles, John of Gaunt, duke of Lancaster,&nbsp;and Thomas, duke of Gloucester, were the most influential&nbsp;persons in the kingdom. The evils naturally inherent in&nbsp;a minority were intensified by war abroad, religious and&nbsp;social troubles at home, the existence of a turbulent&nbsp;nobility, and the intrigues and rivalries which broke up&nbsp;the royal house. Under the incapable rule of Lancaster,&nbsp;the southern coasts were ravaged by French fleets, the&nbsp;northern frontier was harried by the Scots, and the taxes&nbsp;collected for national purposes were wasted or embezzled.&nbsp;The weakness and unpopularity of the Government produced a ferment among the lower classes, which, aggravated&nbsp;by the heavy taxation of 1379 and 1380, culminated in&nbsp;the Peasants’ Revolt of June 1381. This revolt gave&nbsp;Richard, then a lad of fifteen, his first opportunity of distinguishing himself. On June 14 he met the rebels at&nbsp;Mile End, and, by promising the abolition of villenage,&nbsp;induced the Essex contingent to return home. Next day&nbsp;he met the Kentish men at Smithfield. In the parley&nbsp;which followed, their leader, Wat Tyler, was killed. The&nbsp;mob were about to avenge his death when the young king,&nbsp;riding forward alone, calmed their irritation and induced&nbsp;them to follθλv him to Islington. Here a body of troops&nbsp;came to the king’s aid, but Richard prevented a conflict,&nbsp;and persuaded the rioters to disperse. His presence of&nbsp;mind, extraordinary in one so young, not only saved his&nbsp;own life but averted a general disaster. In January 1382&nbsp;he married Anne of Bohemia, daughter of the emperor&nbsp;Charles IV. Meanwhile the influence exerted by John of&nbsp;Gaunt was becoming more and more irksome to him.&nbsp;Charges of conspiracy brought against his uncle in 1384,&nbsp;though denied by Lancaster, so worked upon Richard that&nbsp;he attempted to seize him, but a reconciliation was soon&nbsp;afterwards effected. In 1385 the king led an expedition&nbsp;to Scotland. His refusal to allow the army to penetrate&nbsp;beyond Edinburgh is said to have caused another quarrel&nbsp;with the duke of Lancaster. The efforts made by Richard&nbsp;to form a party of personal adherents, in opposition to his&nbsp;uncles, are to be seen in the elevation of De Vere to the&nbsp;marquisate of Dublin and of De la Pole, the chancellor, to&nbsp;the earldom of Suffolk. After John of Gaunt’s departure&nbsp;to Portugal (July 1386) the quarrel between the king’s&nbsp;party and the opposition headed by Gloucester came to a&nbsp;head. Gloucester, supported by a strong majority in&nbsp;parliament, demanded the dismissal of the chancellor and&nbsp;the treasurer, to which Richard was obliged reluctantly to&nbsp;consent. The blow was followed up by the appointment&nbsp;of a committee of government which, like the baronial&nbsp;committee of 1258, practically superseded the monarchy.&nbsp;Richard submitted, but immediately set about making plans&nbsp;for the recovery of his authority. In November 1387 he&nbsp;came to London in order to overthrow the committee, but&nbsp;was anticipated by Gloucester, who, with Henry of Derby&nbsp;and three others, “appealed,” or impeached the king’s&nbsp;chief adherents of high treason. The party in power&nbsp;always found it easy to manipulate the elections, and the&nbsp;parliament which met in February 1388 was altogether on&nbsp;the side of the “ appellants.” The leaders of the king’s&nbsp;party were executed, banished, or imprisoned, and Gloucester won a complete triumph. He failed, however, to&nbsp;establish his power on a firm basis, and in May 1389&nbsp;Richard threw off the yoke. On the ground that he was&nbsp;now of full age, he suddenly informed his council that he&nbsp;intended to rule alone. Gloucester made no resistance;&nbsp;the nation acquiesced; and Richard was at last really king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Richard did not for some time abuse his power. The “appellants” were not punished, and even remained&nbsp;members of the council. William of Wykeham, however,&nbsp;became chancellor, and it was apparently by his advice&nbsp;and that of John of Gaunt, who returned to England in&nbsp;1389, that Richard regulated his conduct. For eight&nbsp;years he ruled constitutionally. The country was at&nbsp;peace at home and abroad. In June 1394 the queen&nbsp;died. In October of the same year Richard went to&nbsp;Ireland and received the submission of some of the chiefs.&nbsp;He remained in Ireland till May 1395. Next year he&nbsp;concluded a twenty-five years’ truce with France, and&nbsp;engaged to marry Isabella, the French king’s daughter.&nbsp;In September 1396 he w<sup>r</sup>ent to Calais and returned with&nbsp;his bride, a child of eight years old. This alliance seems&nbsp;to have encouraged Richard to carry out a stroke of policy&nbsp;which he had probably long contemplated. In July 1397&nbsp;he suddenly seized the “ appellants,” Warwick, Arundel,&nbsp;and Gloucester. The parliament, which met in September,&nbsp;repealed the acts of 1386, and declared the “appellants”&nbsp;guilty of high treason. Arundel was executed, Warwick&nbsp;imprisoned Gloucester died, probably by violence, in&nbsp;prison. Next year the parliament conferred on Richard&nbsp;tonnage and poundage for life, and delegated their authority&nbsp;to a committee of eighteen, practically chosen by the king,&nbsp;thus making him an absolute monarch. A treasonable&nbsp;conversation between Hereford and Norfolk, reported by&nbsp;the former, gave a pretext for the banishment of both.&nbsp;In February 1399 John of Gaunt died, and Richard&nbsp;seized the Lancaster estates, thus reducing Hereford&nbsp;to desperation. The latter at once began to prepare to&nbsp;recover his inheritance, and Richard, apparently ignorant of the danger, went over to Ireland (May 29), thus&nbsp;leaving the kingdom open to his rival. Henry landed in&nbsp;Yorkshire early in July, and rapidly collected an overpowering force. Richard returned to find Henry in&nbsp;possession of power and himself deserted by the nation.&nbsp;He surrendered to Henry at Flint (August 19) and was&nbsp;conveyed to London. On September 29 he executed a&nbsp;deed by which he resigned the crown. Next day the deed&nbsp;was read in parliament. Formal sentence of deposition&nbsp;was pronounced, and Henry claimed and received the&nbsp;crown. A month afterwards the date king was sentenced&nbsp;to perpetual imprisonment, and was removed to Pontefract.&nbsp;The conspiracy against Henry IV., which was discovered&nbsp;in January 1400, sealed Richard’s fate. The manner of&nbsp;his death is unknown, but there can be little doubt that&nbsp;he died by violence. He is said to have been buried at&nbsp;Langley, February 14, 1400.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In person Richard was slight, fair-haired, beardless, with rounded face and elegant but rather feminine features. His&nbsp;character, a strange mixture of strength and weakness,&nbsp;courage and irresolution, indolence and energy, remains an&nbsp;enigma to the historian. He protected Wickliffe, encouraged&nbsp;Chaucer, and made a serious attempt to establish an absolute monarchy. His reign, w<sup>τ</sup>hether we regard it from</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
