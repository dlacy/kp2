A governor’s house, a State penitentiary, a custom-house and post office, a city-hall and almshouse, and two market-houses are among the principal public buildings. Libby prison, in which thousands of Federal prisoners were confined during the Civil War, was originally a disused tobacco factory, and is now scarcely distinguishable from the other dilapidated brick warehouses in its vicinity. St John’s Episcopal church on Church Hill was, in 1775, the meeting-place of the Virginia convention to which Patrick Henry addressed his famous “ Give me liberty or give me death,” and in 1788 of another convention summoned to discuss the ratification of the Federal Constitution. Monumental Church (Episcopal) commemorates the disastrous burning in 1811 of the theatre which then occupied the site. The State Library, the Virginia Historical Society, Southern Historical Society, Richmond College, and the Medical College (1838) are institutions of note. Holywood Cemetery, occupying a district of great natural beauty to the west of the city, contains the graves of thousands of Confederate soldiers and the monuments of President Monroe and General J. E. B. Stuart, and the Confederate soldiers’ monument. Previous to the Civil War Richmond was the commercial capital of the South and a great entrepot for the produce of the Southern States, Cuba, South America, and Great Britain. Its clipper ships made fast voyages to the Pacific for tea, silk, and other Eastern wares. Its auction sales (monthly or even fortnightly) drew buyers from every part of the Union, even from the northern cities which now supply it with the very commodities they then visited it to purchase. When the war was over Richmond was without ships, merchants, or capital. The tea trade had gone to London, the South-American to New York and Boston, In recent years, however, a new period of commercial prosperity appears to have set in, and, while several of the old sources of wealth have disappeared, the city still remains the natural centre of some of the principal trades of the South. Before the war more tobacco was sold in Richmond than perhaps in any city of the Union (fifty-six manufacturers were numbered in 1857), and this still remains an important staple. The flour trade is also of great extent. There are a large number of iron works, including those of the Tredegar Company ; and granite quarries are worked in the vicinity of the city. In 1857 the real estate of Richmond was assessed at $18,259,816, and the personal property at $10,287,278. By 1885 the corresponding figures were $34,502,903 and $15,000,000. The city is the owner of both gas and water works. The population, which was only 5737 in the beginning of the century, has increased as follows:—9785 in 1810; 12,067 in 1820; 16,060 in 1830; 20,153 in 1840; 27,570 in 1850; 37,910 in 1860; 51,038 in 1870; 63,600 in 1880 (27,832 coloured).</p><p>The first settlement on part of the site of Richmond is said to date from 1609 ; and Fort Charles was erected as a defence against the Indians in 1644-45. But the real origin of the town, which was incorporated in 1745, was Byrd’s warehouse, erected by Colonel William Byrd in the close of the 17th century. It was still a small village when in 1779 it was made the capital of the State of Virginia. From May 1861 till April 1865, when it was occupied by the Federal army, Richmond was the seat of government of the</p><p>Confederate States. On the capture of Petersburg by General Grant the Confederate leaders thought it impossible to hold the city, in spite of the strength of its fortifications ; and Ewell, who commanded the rear-guard of the retreating army, set the great tobacco factories and Hour-mills and the arsenal on fire ; the conflagration lasted till the evening of the following day. In September 1870 part of the city was laid under water by the floods of the James river.</p><p>RICHMOND, Legh (1772-1827), writer of tracts, was born 29th January 1772 at Liverpool, where his father was a physician. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1794 and M.A. in 1797. In 1798 he was appointed to the joint curacies of Brading and Yaverland in the Isle of Wight. Through the perusal of Wilberforce’s <hi rend="italic">Practical View</hi>  an evangelical bias was given to his mind, which led him to devote himself with great earnestness to the reclamation of the masses. He took a prominent interest in the British and Foreign Bible Society, the Church Missionary Society, and various other institutions of a similar kind. In 1805 he became chaplain to the Lock Hospital, London, and in the same year was presented to the rectory of Turvey, Bedfordshire, where he remained till his death, 8th May 1827. He was also appointed chaplain to the duke of Kent. The best known of the tracts of Legh Richmond is the <hi rend="italic">Dairymanhs Daughter,</hi>  of which as many as four millions in nineteen languages were circulated before 1849. A collected edition of his tracts was first published in 1814 under the title of <hi rend="italic">Annals of the Poor.</hi>  He was also the author of <hi rend="italic">Domestic Portraiture,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of his Three Children·,</hi>  and he edited a series of the <hi rend="italic">Fathers of the English Church.</hi></p><p>See Memoirs by Grimshawe, 1828 ; Life by Bedell, 1829.</p><p>RICHTER, Ernst Friedrich Eduard (1808-1879), writer on musical theory and composition, was born at Grosschönau in Saxony, on October 24, 1808. He first studied music at Zittau, and afterwards at Leipsic, where he attained so high a reputation that in 1843 he was appointed professor of harmony and counterpoint at the conservatorium of music, then newly founded by Mendelssohn. On the death of Hauptmann, January 3, 1868, he was elected cantor of the Thomasschule, which office he retained until his death, April 9, 1879. He is best known by three theoretical works — <hi rend="italic">Lehrbτwh der Harmonie, Lehre vom Contrapunct,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Lehre von der Fuge—</hi>originally written for the use of his pupils at the Conservatorium, but now everywhere accepted as valuable text-books, and well known to English students through the excellent translation by Mr Franklin Taylor.</p><p>RICHTER, Johann Paul Friedrich (1763-1825), usually called Jean Paul, the greatest German humorist, was born at Wunsiedel, in Bavaria, on the 21st March 1763. His father was a schoolmaster and organist at Wunsiedel, but in 1765 he became a pastor at Joditz, and in 1776 at Schwarzenbach, where he died in 1779. Having attended the gymnasium at Hof for two years, Richter went in 1780 to the university of Leipsic. His original intention was to enter his father’s profession, but theology did not interest him, and he soon devoted himself wholly to the study of literature. Unable to maintain himself at Leipsic, he secretly left it in 1784 and lived with his mother at Hof. From 1787 to 1789 he served as a tutor at Töpen, a village near Hof ; and afterwards he taught the children of several families at Schwarzenbach. During all these years he had to struggle with extreme poverty, but he never lost the buoyancy of his temper, nor did he doubt for a moment that his genius would in the end be generally recognized. His hardships left no trace of bitterness on his frank and manly spirit.</p><p>Richter began his career as a man of letters by writing the <hi rend="italic">Gronldndisehe Processe</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Auswahl aus des Teufels</hi></p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
