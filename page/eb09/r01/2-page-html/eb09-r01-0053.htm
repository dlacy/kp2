<p><span class="font3">temperatures, to allow for expansion in hot weather. The joints of the rails are united or fished with parallel steel plates lodged&nbsp;within the side channels of the rails and fastened with four bolts&nbsp;and nuts passed through the web of the rails, and, in order that&nbsp;the fish-plates may take a solid and steady bearing, the entering&nbsp;faces of the upper and lower members of the rails are in most instances formed straight and steep,—at an angle of about 2 to 1.&nbsp;For the same purpose the fish-plates are hollow at their inner faces,&nbsp;so as not to be in contact with the vertical members or web of the&nbsp;rails, and are slightly elastic in consequence. Vertical stiffness,&nbsp;also, is of prime importance in fish-plates, which act as beams fixed&nbsp;at the ends and uniformly loaded, being required to sustain the&nbsp;loads of trains passing over the joints. On some lines, accordingly,&nbsp;the fish-plates are made of greater depth, extending downwards&nbsp;along the lower table of the rail, and are even turned under it,&nbsp;whence they are called clip fish-plates. The chairs are laid on&nbsp;transverse timber sleepers, ordinarily cut from Baltic redwood to&nbsp;a scantling of 10 inches wide and 5 deep, and 9 feet in length,—&nbsp;speaking precisely, only 8 feet 11 inches in length, to secure the&nbsp;timber from import duty. They are most commonly submitted&nbsp;to a preserving process by the injection of about 2⅜ gallons of&nbsp;creasote into each sleeper. The chairs are fixed to the sleepers&nbsp;by iron spikes or oak trenails, or both, varying in number from&nbsp;two on the lines of lighter traffic to three or four on lines of&nbsp;heavier traffic. On the London and South-Western Railway and&nbsp;on the South-Eastern Railway a compound fastener is used,—a&nbsp;spike driven into a hollow trenail, after the latter is driven into&nbsp;the sleeper. There are usually eleven cross sleepers to each length&nbsp;of rails of 30 feet, making the average distance between the&nbsp;sleepers about 2 feet 9 inches from centre to centre. It is usual&nbsp;to space them apart more widely in the middle portion of the&nbsp;rail-bars (up to 3 feet) and more closely about the joints, with a&nbsp;view to equalizing the vertical resistance of the rails to rolling&nbsp;loads, by supplying a greater degree of support from the sleepers&nbsp;near the joints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The standard models of permanent way on the double-headed rail and chair system adopted by Mr John Fowler for the New&nbsp;South Wales railways have been already noticed. The rails are&nbsp;shown in section in figs. 29 and 35. The sleepers are of colonial hard&nbsp;woods, chiefly iron-bark timber. They are laid 2 feet 6 inches&nbsp;apart between centres at the joints of the rails, and 3 feet 1 inch&nbsp;apart elsewhere. The upper and lower tables of the rails are curved&nbsp;or rounded in section to a radius of 5</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font3"> inches, the height of the&nbsp;rail. The entering or overhanging faces of the rail are inclined at</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a slope of about 1 in 2, forming straight and equally inclined bearings to receive the fish-plates. The rails, while in course of&nbsp;manufacture, are tested by selecting a few rails of each day’s&nbsp;make, from which a portion 4⅜ feet in length is cut off and&nbsp;placed on iron supports 3⅜ feet apart, and is subjected to three&nbsp;blows from a weight of 1 ton falling 12 feet each time. The rails&nbsp;are to deflect not less than 6⅛ inches and not more than 7⅜ under&nbsp;this test without showing any signs of fracture. The fish-bolts,&nbsp;as well as the spikes for fastening the chairs to the sleepers, are&nbsp;made of the finest quality of close fibrous iron. Fifty per cent, of&nbsp;the rails were ordered 24 feet in length, 40 per cent. 21, and 10&nbsp;per cent. 18. The chairs (fig. 30) are 13⅛ inches long at the sole,&nbsp;41 wide, and 1⅜ thick at the seat of the rail. Test bars of the&nbsp;metal used for the chairs are cast to a scantling of 2 inches by 1&nbsp;inch and 3⅜ feet long. They are placed on edge, on supports 3&nbsp;feet apart, and are required to sustain a dead load of 30 cwt.&nbsp;suspended from the centre of the bar without fracture. The spikes&nbsp;are seven-eighths of an inch in diameter, tapered at the head to&nbsp;fifteen-sixteenths, with hemispherical or cup-heads forged from&nbsp;the solid bar. The above-described way, as&nbsp;laid in New South Wales, is bedded in ballast consisting of broken stone 12 inches in&nbsp;depth below the sleepers, broken to a gauge&nbsp;of 3 inches, boxed up with broken stone of a&nbsp;smaller size to a gauge of 2 inches for a depth&nbsp;of 8 inches. The total depth of the ballast&nbsp;from the crown of the formation is 22 inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The surface of the formation below the ballast is rounded in cross-section, in order to drain&nbsp;off such water as penetrates through the ballast. Grips or furrows are cut and drains laid&nbsp;in where necessary, so that no water is allowed&nbsp;to remain on the line or under the ballast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The South-Eastern double-headed rail (fig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">31) is keyed into chairs 4⅜ inches wide and 13g long at the sole. They are fixed to the&nbsp;sleeper by two spikes driven into two hollow&nbsp;oak trenails. The sleepers at the joints are&nbsp;laid 2 feet 4 inches apart between centres.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">These quantities are considerably less than those of the Midland Railway (which are stated below), as may naturally be the case for&nbsp;a line chiefly of passenger traffic in comparison with one of heavy&nbsp;goods and mineral traffic. The double-headed rails of the North-Eastern Railway, 82 ft&gt; per yard, are bedded on blocks or cushions&nbsp;of oak placed in the bottom of the chairs, the advantages of which&nbsp;have already been noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The type section of way of the Midland Railway is shown in fig. 32. The formation is inclined each way from the centre, making&nbsp;two straight slopes for drainage. The ballast is of strong gravel&nbsp;broken stone, and ashes or clinker,—chiefly gravel. It covers a&nbsp;width of 26⅜ feet for two lines of way. It is laid to a depth of 16&nbsp;inches at the middle of the six-foot, and is formed level with the&nbsp;upper sides of the sleepers between the rails in the four-foot, with&nbsp;a medium depth of 16 inches, or 11 inches beneath the sleepers.&nbsp;At the outer sides of the rails the ballast</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">is heaped level with the tops of the chairs,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">or, more precisely, the tops of the keys,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and is sloped down to the formation at</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">each outer side. The upper and lower</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">surfaces of the rail (see fig. 33) are curved</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">to a radius equal to the height of it, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the planks are flat,—adapted for taking</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">up lateral blows and mitigating wear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The chairs are remarkable for large</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">dimensions, being 7½ inches wide and</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">15½ long at the sole, which is 1⅞ inches</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">thick under the rail, and for their weight,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">50 lb each. The cost of relaying 1 mile</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">of single way on the Midland system just</span></p>
