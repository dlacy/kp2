<p><hi rend="smallcaps">Volterra, was born in 1509, and studied painting under Razzi and Peruzzi. The young artist, settling in Rome, strove most unweariedly to attain eminence in his profession. No efforts were spared on his pictures, lie proceeded with a careful slowness, attempting to reach his ideal by a close imitation of Michelangelo. It is even said that he sometimes in a difficulty had recourse to the more direct aid of that great master’s own hand. The result of this earnest labour was that Ricciarelli obtained abundant encouragement. His constant friend, Michelangelo, recommended him on all possible occasions. He had the honour to beautify with works of art a chapel in the church of the Trinità, to paint in the Farnese Palace, to execute certain decorations in the Palazzo de’ Medici at Navona, and to begin the stucco work and the pictures in the Hall of the Kings. Nor was he less highly patronized when, towards the close of his life, he turned his attention to statuary. His last work was a bronze horse intended for an equestrian statue of Henry II. of France. He died in 1566. The principal extant works of Ricciarelli are at Rome. These are a St John the Baptist in the picture gallery of the Capitol, a Saviour bearing the Cross in the Palazzo Rosρigliosi, and a Descent from the Cross, his masterpiece, in the church of Trinità de Monti. There is also an Elijah at Volterra.</hi></p>
