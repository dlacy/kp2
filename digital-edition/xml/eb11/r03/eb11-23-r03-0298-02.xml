<p><label>RICHARD OF HEXHAM</label>
(fl. 1141), English chronicler, became prior of Hexham about 1141, and died between 1163 and 1178. He wrote <hi rend="italic">Brevis Annotatio</hi> a short history of the church of Hexham from 674 to 1138, for which he borrowed from Bede, Eddius and Simeon of Durham. This is published by J. Raine in <hi rend="italic">The Priory of Hexham its Chroniclers, Endowments and Annals</hi> (Durham, 1864-65). More important is his <hi rend="italic">Hisloria de gestis regis Slephani et de bello Standardii,</hi> very valuable for the history of the north of England during the earlier part of the reign of Stephen, and especially for the battle of the Standard. This history, which is a contemporary one, covers the period from the death of Henry I. in 1135 to early in 1139. It lias been edited for the Rolls Series by R. Howlett in the <hi rend="italic">Chroniclers of the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II. and Richard I.,</hi> vol. iii. (1886); and has been translated by J. Stevenson in the <hi rend="italic">Church Historians of England,</hi> vol. iv. (1856).</p>
