<p><span class="font0">dress worn when trying criminal cases, attending church officially, and on “ red letter days ” in the courts, consists of a&nbsp;scarlet gown, with a broad black belt, a tippet trimmed with&nbsp;white fur, known by courtesy as “ ermine ” (this is worn only&nbsp;on state occasions), and a scarlet casting-hood, always worn&nbsp;with the scarlet gown, the end of which is passed under the&nbsp;belt. For summer the robes are of thinner stuff, faced with&nbsp;slate-coloured silk instead of ermine. The full-bottomed wig&nbsp;is worn on state occasions; at other times a wig is worn&nbsp;similar to that of barristers, except that it has one vertical&nbsp;curl just above the tail of the wig instead of the three rows&nbsp;of horizontal curls going all the way round.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The judges of the King’s Bench Division have also a black gown, trimmed with ermine, which may be worn with the&nbsp;scarlet casting-hood when they sit two or more together. The&nbsp;summer equivalent of the black robes is in thin blue stuff,&nbsp;faced with silk. A costume like that of King’s Counsel, namely,&nbsp;a black silk gown, with black cloth court suit, is the dress of&nbsp;judges when sitting alone to try civil actions, and of vice-chancellors and judges of the Chancery Division, but Sir&nbsp;Herbert Stephen remarks that of late years certain of the judges&nbsp;have preferred on grounds of comfort the black or blue gown&nbsp;with scarlet casting-hood. The court dress of the judges of&nbsp;the High Court and of Indian and colonial judges consists of a&nbsp;black damask tufted gown, without train, worn over a black&nbsp;velvet court suit, with full-bottomed wig, lace bands and&nbsp;three-cornered silk hat.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Lord Chancellor, when in the House of Lords, and sitting on Appeals, wears a black silk trained gown, over a black&nbsp;cloth court suit, with full-bottomed wig; he has also his&nbsp;peer’s robe (see above), and his state robe of black damask&nbsp;with gold lace, worn over a velvet court suit, with full-bottomed&nbsp;wig, lace bands, &amp;c.; the purse is carried on state occasions&nbsp;when in the royal presence. The state robe of the Master of&nbsp;the Rolls, the Lords Justices of the Court of Appeal, and the&nbsp;President of the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Divisions&nbsp;is the same, except that they have not the purse, and similar&nbsp;to it is the full-dress gown of the Speaker of the House of&nbsp;Commons, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, &amp;c. The Lords&nbsp;Justices of the Court of Appeal sit in court in a costume similar&nbsp;to that of King’s Counsel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Lords of Appeal have no official robes, but sit in ordinary civilian dress. On state occasions they wear their&nbsp;peers’ robes. The robes of state of the Lord Chief Justice of&nbsp;England are the same as those of the judges of the High&nbsp;Court, except that his are trained, and he wears the gold chain&nbsp;of office, the “ collar of SS.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Scottish judges have two sets of robes, one for Justiciary (f.e. the criminal court), which is also their full dress, and one&nbsp;for civil causes (Court of Session). The dress for the President&nbsp;and Ordinary Lords of Session was fixed in 1610 by an order&nbsp;of James I., and was of purple cloth, faced with crimson satin,&nbsp;with hood to match, the President’s gown having crimson&nbsp;velvet instead of satin. The four “ extraordinary Sessionarics ”&nbsp;were to wear black velvet, satin, or silk gowns, lined with black.&nbsp;The Lord Justice General wore a scarlet gown lined with ermine&nbsp;and an ermine hood, the Lord Justice Deputy and Lord Justice&nbsp;Clerk black gowns with crimson satin facings and hoods (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Register of the Privy Council of Scotland,</span><span class="font0"> vol. viii. p. 612). At&nbsp;the foundation of the High Court of Justiciary (1672) it was&nbsp;enacted “ that for the splendour of that court, all the judges sit&nbsp;in red robes, faced with white, that of the Justice Generalls&nbsp;being lined with ermine for distinction from the rest ” (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acts of Parliament of Scotland,</span><span class="font0"> vol. viii. p. 88). The present&nbsp;full dress of the Lord Justice General is a scarlet silk robe with&nbsp;tippet and hood, the hood falling down the back; the collar&nbsp;is of ermine, with which the tippet, sleeves and gown are edged&nbsp;and the hood lined. The Lord Justice Clerk wears a scarlet&nbsp;cloth robe and hood, and a white silk tippet lined with scarlet,&nbsp;the silk being perforated with small holes to imitate ermine,&nbsp;as also on the sleeves and edges of the gown. In front of the&nbsp;tippet on each side are two crosses in scarlet silk, and on each&nbsp;side of the gown six crosses. The ordinary Lords Commissioners of Justiciary have robes the same as those of the Lord&nbsp;Justice Clerk, except that the satin is not perforated. Instead&nbsp;of the bands worn by English judges, the Scottish judges wear&nbsp;a long fall in front.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Bar.—</span><span class="font0">There appears to have been no official costume for the bar until the end of the 17th century. Druitt </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Costume&nbsp;in Brasses,</span><span class="font0"> pp. 232-33) gives a Ust of several brasses of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in lege&nbsp;periti,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Qpprenticii ad legem,</span><span class="font0"> most of whom wear ordinary&nbsp;civilian costume, occasionally with the addition of a high cap.&nbsp;In the 16th and 17th centuries they wear the false-sleeved gown&nbsp;worn by civilians. Before the 17th century the costume worn&nbsp;by students at the Inns of Court and by “ Utter Barristers ”&nbsp;consisted of a stuff gown, and sometimes, in term-time, a round&nbsp;cap, which was worn in hall and in church (see Herbert, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History&nbsp;of the Inns of Court</span><span class="font0"> (1804), p. 230). In Westminster Hall&nbsp;(see Pulling, p. 223) the same costume was worn, Benchers and&nbsp;Readers having a more elaborate gown with facings of black&nbsp;velvet and tufts of silk. Frequent laws were passed in the&nbsp;16th century and later, forbidding the wearing of swords,&nbsp;cloaks, boots and spurs, &amp;c., in hall, and insisting on the wearing&nbsp;of gowns by students of the Inns of Court when walking in the&nbsp;city. In the 17th century, barristers, like the judges, adopted&nbsp;wigs, the full-bottomed wigs being confined to judges, “ King’s&nbsp;Counsellors,” &amp;c., and ordinary counsellors wearing small wigs.&nbsp;In Hollar’s engraving of the coronation of Charles H. the King’s&nbsp;Counsel, the King’s Attorney and SoUcitor, and the Master of&nbsp;the Rolls wear a lacêd gown with hanging sleeves. The silk gown,&nbsp;fuU-bottomed wig and black court dress now worn by King’s&nbsp;Counsel is generaUy held to date from the funeral of Queen&nbsp;Mary II., being the mourning dress worn by the wish of King&nbsp;William for a considerable period after the queen’s death, and&nbsp;adopted as a convenient costume ever since. There is a well-known jest of Chief Baron Pollock to the effect that “ the Bar&nbsp;went into mourning at the death of Queen Anne, and never&nbsp;came out again,” which bears out this theory as to the origin&nbsp;of the costume. At the present time barristers wear black&nbsp;stuff gowns, with small wigs having three rows of curls round&nbsp;the head. King’s Counsel wear black silk gowns over a cloth&nbsp;court suit (cp. the expression “ to take silk,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> to become a&nbsp;K.C.); on fuU-dress occasions they wear a full-bottomed wig,&nbsp;and at court a black damask tufted gown over a velvet court&nbsp;suit. This is also the dress for state occasions of the Attorney-General, Solicitor-General, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Municipal and Civic Robes.—</span><span class="font0">The word “ livery,” the use of which is now practically confined to the costume of the&nbsp;“ livery companies,” the dress of men-servants, &amp;c., originally&nbsp;meant an allowance of food or clothing granted to certain&nbsp;persons </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(LaXJiberata,</span><span class="font0"> Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">livrée).</span><span class="font0"> It is still used of the aUowances&nbsp;of food made to the feUows of certain colleges. As early as&nbsp;the 13th century, according to Matt. Paris </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Chron. Maj.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Rolls Series, III. 337), we find the citizens of London assuming&nbsp;a uniform dress to do honour to some great occasion, as, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">when in 1236 a body of them rode out to meet Henry III. and&nbsp;Queen Eleanor, “ sericis Vestimentis ornati, cicladibus auro&nbsp;textis circumdati, excogitatis mutatoriis amicti,” or when 600&nbsp;citizens rode out to meet Queen Marghrct, wife of Edward I.,&nbsp;“ in one livery of red and white, with the cognizances of their&nbsp;misteries embroidered upon their sleeves ” (see Stow’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Survey,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ed. Morley, p. 444). By the 14th century there is evidence&nbsp;of the adoption of liveries by the trades and fraternities. At&nbsp;the celebrations of the birth of Edward III. (see Riley’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memorials,</span><span class="font0"> p. 105) the mayor and aldermen were “ richly arrayed&nbsp;in suits of robes,” while the drapers, mercers and vintners&nbsp;were also “ in costume.” This need not, howcver, refer to&nbsp;Uvcries. G. Unwin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(The Gilds of London,</span><span class="font0"> 1908) quotes a chronicler who records that by the year 1319 “ many of the people</span></p>
