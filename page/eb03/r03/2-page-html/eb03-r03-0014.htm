<p><span class="font0">it is neceſſary then to twiſt the fibres of hemp together, in order to make a rope ; but we ſhould make a very bad rope if &quot;we contented ourſelves with twilling&nbsp;together a bunch of hemp ſuſſicſently large to with-•ſtand the ſtrains to which the rope is to be expoſed»&nbsp;As ſoon as we let it go out of our hands, it would un-twiſt itſelf, and be again a looſe bundle of hemp ; for&nbsp;the fibres are ſtrained, and they are in a conſiderable&nbsp;degree elaſtic ; they contract again, and thus untwiſt&nbsp;the rope or ſkain. it is neceſſary to contrive the twiſt&nbsp;in ſuch a manner, that the tendency to untwiſt in one&nbsp;part may actragainſt the fame tendency in another and&nbsp;balance it. The proceſs, therefore, of rope-making is&nbsp;more complicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The firſt part of this proceſs is spinning of rope» yarns. This is done in various ways, and with different machinery, according to the nature of the intended cordage. We- ſhall confine our dcſcription to the&nbsp;manufacture of the larger kinds, ſuch as are uſed for&nbsp;the ſtanding and running rigging of ſhips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1 An alley or walk is incloſed for the purpoſe, about <sub>ι</sub> 200 fathoms long, and of a breadth ſuited to the extent&nbsp;of the manufacture. It is ſometimes covered above. At&nbsp;the upper end of this rope-walk is ſet up the ſpm-ning-whεel, of a fprm' reſembling that in ſig- i. The&nbsp;’band of this wheel goes over ſeveral rollers called&nbsp;whirls, turning on pivots in braſs holes. The pivots at one end come through the frame, and terminate in little hooks. The wheel being turned by a&nbsp;winch, gives motion in one direction to all thoſe whirls.&nbsp;The ſpinner has a bundle of dreſſed hemp round his&nbsp;waiſt, with the two ends meeting before - him. The&nbsp;hemp is laid in this bundle in the ſame way that women ſpread the flax on the diſtaff. There is great variety in this ; but the general aim is to lay the fibres in&nbsp;ſuch a manner, that as long as .the bundle laſts there&nbsp;may be an equal number of the ends at the extremity, and that a fibre may never offer itſelf double or in&nbsp;a bight. The ſpinner draws out a proper number of&nbsp;fibres, twiſts them with his fingers, and having got a&nbsp;ſuſſicient length detached, he fixes it to the hook of a&nbsp;whirl. The wheel is now turned, and the ſkain is&nbsp;twilled, becoming what is called a rope-yarn, and the&nbsp;ſpinner walks backwards down the rope-walk. The&nbsp;part already twiſted draws along with it more fibres&nbsp;out of the bundle. The ſpinner aids this with his fingers, ſupplying hemp in due proportion as he walks&nbsp;away from the wheel, and taking care that the fibres&nbsp;come in equally from both ſides -of his bundle, and that&nbsp;they enter always with their ends, and not by the&nbsp;middle, which would double them. He ſhould alſo&nbsp;endeavour to enter every fibre at the heart of the yam.&nbsp;Ί his will cauſe all the fibres to mix equally in making&nbsp;it up, and will make the work ſmootli, becauſe one end&nbsp;of each fibre is by this means buried among the reft, and&nbsp;the other end only lies outward ; and this, in paſſing&nbsp;through the graſp of the ſpinner, who preſſes it tight&nbsp;with his thumb and palm, is alſo made to lie ſmootli.&nbsp;The greateſt fault that can be committed in ſpinning is&nbsp;to allow a ſmall thread to be twiſted off from one ſide&nbsp;of the hemp, and then to cover this with hemp ſupplied&nbsp;from the other ſide : for it is evident that the fibres of&nbsp;the central thread make very long ſpirals, and the ſkin&nbsp;of fibres which covers them muſt be much more oblique.&nbsp;This covering has but little connection with what is&nbsp;below it, and will eafily be detached. But even while&nbsp;it remains, the yarn cannot be ſtrong ; for on pulling&nbsp;it, the middle part, which lies the ſtraighteſt, muſt bear&nbsp;all the ſtrain, while the outer fibres, that are lying obliquely, are only drawn a little more parallel to the&nbsp;axis. This defect will always happen if the hemp be&nbsp;ſupplied hi.a conſiderable body to a yarn that is then&nbsp;ſpinning ſmall. Into whatever part of the yarn it is&nbsp;made to enter, it becomes a fort </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">looſely connected&nbsp;wrapper. Such a yarn, when untwiſted a little, will&nbsp;have the appearance of ſig. 2. while a good yarn looks&nbsp;like ſig. 3. A good ſpinner therefore endeavours always to ſupply the hemp in the form of a thin fiat ſkain&nbsp;with his left hand, while his right is employed in graſp-ing firmly the yarn that is twining off, and in holding&nbsp;it tight from the whirl, that it may not run into loops&nbsp;or kinks..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is evident, that both the arrangement of the fibres and the degree of twiſting depend on the ſkill and dexterity of the ſpinner, and that he muſt be inſtructed,&nbsp;not by a book, but by a matter. The degree of twiſt&nbsp;depends on the rate of the wheel’s motion, combined&nbsp;with the retrograde walk of the ſpinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We may ſuppoſe lιim arrived at the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lower</span><span class="font0"> end of the walk, or as far as is neceſſary for the intended length of&nbsp;his yarn·. He calls out, and another ſpinner immediately detaches the yarn from the hook of the whirl,&nbsp;gives it to another, who carries it aſide to the reel, and&nbsp;this ſecond ſpinner attaches his own hemp to the whiιl&nbsp;hook. In the mean time, the firſt ſpinner keeps faſt&nbsp;hold of the end of his yarn ; for the hemp, being dry,&nbsp;is very elaſtic, and if he were to let it go out of his hand&nbsp;it would inſtantly untwiſt, and become little better than&nbsp;looſe hemp. He waits, therefore, till he fees the reeler&nbsp;begin to turn the reel, and he. goes flowly up the walk,&nbsp;keeping the yam of an equal tightneſs all the way, till&nbsp;he arrives at the wheel, where he waits with his yarn in&nbsp;hand till another ſpinner has ſiniſhed his yarn. 1 he&nbsp;firſt ſpinner takes it off the whirl hook, joins it to his&nbsp;own, that it may follow it on the reel, and begins </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">new yam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rope-yarns, for the greateſt part of the large rigging, are from a quarter of an inch to ſomewhat more than a third of an inch in circumference, or of ſuch a&nbsp;ſize that 160 fathoms weigh from 3 '<sub>τ</sub> to 4 pounds when&nbsp;white. The different ſizes of-yarns are named from&nbsp;the numbe&gt; of them contained in a ſtrand of a rope of&nbsp;three inches in circumference. Few are ſo coarſe that&nbsp;16 will make a ſtrand of Britiſh ccrd3ge ; 18 is not unfrequent for cable yarns, or yams ſpun from harſh and&nbsp;coarſe hemp ; 25 is, we believe, the fineſt ſize which is&nbsp;worked up for the rigging of a ſhip, Much finer are&nbsp;indeed ſpun for founding lines, liſhing lines, and many&nbsp;other marine uſes. and for the other demands ot ſociety.&nbsp;Ten good ſpinners will work up above 600 weight of hemp&nbsp;in a day; but this depends on the weather. In very dry&nbsp;weather the hemp is very elaſtic, and requires great attention to make ſmootli work. In the warmer climates,&nbsp;the ſpinner is permitted to moillen the rag with which&nbsp;he graſps the yarn in his right hand-for each yarn. No&nbsp;work can be done in an open ſpinning walk in rainy weather, becauſe the yarns would not take on the tar, if&nbsp;immediately tarred, and would rot if kept on the reel&nbsp;for a long. time.</span></p>
