Their materials were the blood-stained period of Faustrecht and Vehm-Gerichte, feudal tyrants, suffering damsels, devoted knights, with abundance of single combats and splintering of lances, raising of trap-doors, escapes by sliding pannels, imprisonments in bottomless dungeons, murders, witchcraft, and apparitions ; in short, all that apparatus of the terrible, which, even in such hands, has a certain fascination for the boy, but awakens only a feeling of the ridiculous in the man.</p><p>Another department of German fictions likewise dealing with the marvellous, but fortunately cultivated by writers of a very different order of talent, was the Mahrchen, or legendary tale. Three different modes may be pointed out in which this class of subjects has been treated.</p><p>The first is exemplified in the <hi rend="italic">Volhsmarchen,</hi>  or popular tales of Musæus, in which the groundwork of marvellous tradition which the writer has selected is treated, not in the spirit of belief, but of a laughing scepticism, and where the writer relies for effect, not so much upon thc interest of his materials, as upon the wit, the satirical allusions, and the quaintdescription or broad drollery which he is able to infuse into the original legend. Whatever in such traditions bordered upon awe or terror, Musæus rejected ; he viewed even these creations of the fancy in a prosaic light, and selected only such features as could be wrought into his ingenious mosaic of fanciful marvel, picturesque description, and sly and somewhat irreligious pleasantry, in the style of Voltaire. What he attempted, however, he accomplished with success. Some of his tales, such as <hi rend="italic">Sturnme Liebe,</hi>  (Dumb Love), and <hi rend="italic">Melechsαla,</hi>  might be cited as models of the art of combining the childish interest of a nursery tale with that shew of irony or philosophy which affords even to grave personages an apology for the perusal of popular tales.</p><p>In this semi-derisive style of treating the traditionary legends of his country, Musæus remains the solitary writer of talent. This natural tendency of the German mind towards earnestness and belief, even in the case of the marvellous, led to a very decided preference of the serious manner in the treatment of such themes. And undoubtedly at the head of this second mode of treating the legend stands Ludwick Tieck, (born 1773). Questionable as we think his claims areto the highest distinction, either as a poet or a novelist, in the proper sense of the term, his success in the management of traditional marvels in a poetical spirit is undeniable. He seems without an effort to throw himself back into the spirit of primitive and superstitious periods, when the agency of an invisible world formed an article of belief, and exercised the strongest influence over the conduct of life ; a time of supposed prodigies, and omens, and secret charms, whose agency pervaded and controlled the course of nature. In reading the best of these legends of Tieck, such as <hi rend="italic">The Fair Eckbeτt, The Love Charm,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Peter ofAbano,</hi>  we feel that he has the power of carrying us back in advanced age into the very realm of Fairyland, and subjecting us anew to the influences of childhood. “ These legends have a freshness about them like that of the earliest morning, a sweetness as of wild flowers, and a calm beauty, caught as it were from a radiant sunset or a rising morn. The reader ofthe <hi rend="italic">Runenberg</hi>  is brought face to face with the presiding spirits of the animal and vegetable kingdoms ; now he feels as if he were embosomed in luxurious vegetation, bathed in fertilizing dew, and fanned by balmy zephyrs, and now as if he were transported to cavern depths or darkest mines, where mountain spirits exercise an unholy influence. All the other legends, <hi rend="italic">The Fair Eckbert, The Fairies,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">The Trusty Eekhαrt,</hi>  have the same beauty and significance ; but it is impossible by mere description to give any idea of their peculiar nature. They must be studied and felt to be at all understood.”@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p><p>We are here speaking of Tieck merely as the writer who has treated the traditional tale in the most poetical spirit. Within the domain of the novel, taking the term even in a very extensive sense, our estimate of his powers will be very different.</p><p>The mode of treating the legendary lore of Germany, of which the tales of Tieck had furnished the first example, as the most agreeable to the national character, soon found numerous, or, it might rather be said, numberless imitators. For the last thirty years, the example of Tieck has been implicitly followed ; and all the legendary novelists of Germany have been melancholy and gentlemanlike, after the pattern of the Phantasus. Of these the writers best known to English readers, through translation, are the Baron de la Motte Fouque, the author of <hi rend="italic">Undine,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Magic Ring,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Sintram ;</hi>  Chamisso, the author of <hi rend="italic">Peter Schlemihl;</hi>  and Apel, the author of the <hi rend="italic">Freyschu,tz.</hi>  It may be doubted whether better specimens of the German tale might not be selected from writers with which the English public is not familiar,—some of Henrich Steffens’ short legendary stories in particular,—such as, the <hi rend="italic">Sleeping Bride,</hi>  (Die Sclilafende Braut) and the <hi rend="italic">Nightly Betrothal in the Church ofRorwig, </hi>(Die Nachtliche trauung im Kirche Rδrwig), which have not yet found a translator, appear not undeserving of the attention of the lovers of the marvellous. In the wild productions of Achim von Arnim, such as the <hi rend="italic">Countess Dolores,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Isabella of Egypt,</hi>  traits of talent sparkle in the midst of absurdity. And from the works of Clemens Bren-tano, and of Zhokke, the author of <hi rend="italic">Abeliηo,</hi>  several interesting legends might be selected. In particular, we are surprised that the simple and beautiful legendary tale by the former, “ The History of the Brave Kasperl and the Fair Annerl,” is yet untranslated.</p><p>The third form in which the Mahrchen was employed, but, at the same time, perverted from its proper purpose, and subjected to a more Mezentian union than it had submitted to even under the satirical despotism of Musæus, w as in the fantastic or grotesquely terrible manner introduced by Hoffmann, and, since his death, so injudiciously and unsuccessfully imitated both in Germany and in France. Hoffmann’s manner cannot be considered as entirely original, since an approach to it may be pointed out in the <hi rend="italic">Diable Amoureux </hi>of Cazotte. It is singular, however, that his productions, such as the <hi rend="italic">Sandman,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Magnetizer,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Devil's Elixir, </hi>and others of that class, deriving their whole interest and effect from their connexion with the peculiar nature and idiosyncrasy of the writer’s mind, and so incapable of being imitated with the least success by any one not possessing the same anomalous mental conformation and physical irritability with the Prussian judge, should have exercised a very decided though temporary influence over the literature, not merely of Germany, but of Europe ; and it proves that, notwithstanding the extravagances, there does reside in them some charm,—something which appeals successfully, not, indeed, to the mind in its calmer mood, but to the imagination when in a state of temporary excitement. Only in such a mind as Hoffmann’s, moulded into its existing shape by an ill-omened union of influences, mental and bodily, habitually haunted with gorgons and presentiments, seeing traces, as it were, of the devil’s hoof in the commonest paths of life, and start</p><p>@@@<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="sup">1</hi>  Germany,</hi>  by Bisset Hawkins, p. 126.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
