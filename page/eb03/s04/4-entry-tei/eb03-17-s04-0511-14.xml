in fabulous hiſtory, certain celebrated ſongſtreſſes who were ranked among the demigods of antiquity. Hyginus places their birth among the conſequences of the rape of Proſerpine. Others make them daughters oſ the river Achelous and one of the muſes<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Ovid Men. lib. iv.</p></note> *. The number of the Sirens was three ; and their names were <hi rend="italic">Parthenope, Lygea,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Leucosia.</hi> Some make them half women and half fiſh ; others, half women and half birds. There are antique repreſentations of them ſtill ſubſiſting under both theſe forms. Pauſanias tells us, that the Sirens, by the persuaſion of Juno, challenged the Muſes to a trial of ſkill in ſinging ; and theſe having vanquiſhed them, plucked the golden feathers from the wings of the Sirens, and formed them into crowns, with which they adorned their own heads.

præa in Italy, and chiefly inhabited the promontory of Minerva, upon the top of which that goddeſs had a temple, as ſome affirm, built by Ulyſſes. Here there was a renowned academy, in the reign of the Sirens, famous for eloquence and the liberal ſciences, which gave occaſion to the invention of this fable of the ſweetneſs of the voice and attracting ſongs of the Sirens. But why then are they fabled to be deſtroyers, and painted in ſuch dreadful colours ? We are told, that at laſt the ſtudents abuſed their knowledge, to the colouring of wrong, the corruption of manners, and the ſubversion of government; that is, in the language of poetry, they were feigned to be transformed into monſters, and with their muſic to have enticed paſſengers to their ruin, who there conſumed their patrimonies, and poiſoned their virtues with riot and effeminacy. The place is now called <hi rend="italic">Maſſa.</hi> Some writers tell us of a certain bay, contracted within winding ſtraits and broken cliffs, which, by the ſinging of the winds and beating of the waters, returns a delightful harmony, that allures the paſſenger to approach, who is immediately thrown againſt the rocks, and ſwallowed up by the violent eddies. Thus Horace, moraliling, calls idleneſs a <hi rend="italic">Siren.</hi></p><p>But the fable may be applied to all pleaſures in general, which, if too eagerly purſued, betray the incautious into ruin ; while wise men, like Ulyſſes, making uſe of their reason, ſtop their ears againſt their inſinuations.</p><p>The learned Mr Bryant ſays, that the Sirens were Cuthite and Canaanitiſh prieſts, who had founded temples in Sicily, which were rendered infamous on account of the women who officiated. They were much addicted to cruel rites, ſo that the ſhores upon which they reſided are deſcribed as covered with the bones of men deſtroyed by their artifice. <hi rend="italic">Virgil. Æneid.</hi> lib. v. v. 864.</p><p>All ancient authors agree in telling us, that Sirens inhabited the coaſt of Sicily. The name, according to Bochart, who derives it from the Phoenician language, implies a ſongſtress. Hence it is probable, ſays Dr Burney, that in ancient times there may have been excellent fingers, but of corrupt morals, on the coaſt of Sicily, who, by ſeducing voyagers, gave rise to this fable. And if this conjecture be well founded, he obſerves, the Muſes are not the only pagan divinities who preſerved their influence over mankind in modern times ; for every age has its Sirens, and every Siren her votaries ; when beauty and talents, both powerful in themſelves, are united, they become ſtill more attractive.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Siren,</hi> in zoology, a genus of animals belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">amphibia</hi> and the order of <hi rend="italic">meantes.</hi> It is a biped, naked, and furniſhed with a tail ; the feet are brachiated with claws.<note anchored="false" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Phil.
