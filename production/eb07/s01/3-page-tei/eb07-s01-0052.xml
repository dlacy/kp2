Much of the iron is converted near the mines into the heavier hardware articles. There are some manufactures produced, but the establishments are upon a small scale, furnishing tiles, glass, paper, and liqueurs. There is also some trade in timber, and in pot and pearl ashes, from the more wooded divisions of the department.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saone</hi> AND <hi rend="smallcaps">Loire,</hi> a department of France, formed out of some portions of the ancient duchy of Burgundy, then distinguished as the Autunois, the Charollais, and the Cha- lonnais. It is bounded on the north by the departments of the Nievre and the Cote d’Or ; on the east by that of Jura ; on the south by those of the Aine, the Rhone, and the Loire ; and on the west by the Allier and the Nievre. It extends over 856,472 hectares, which are cqual to 3009 square miles, is divided into five arrondissements, forty- eight cantons, and 592 communes, and in 1836 it contained a population of 538,507 persons. Its inhabitants have increased since the peace at a far greater rate than the other parts of France, having been in 1818 only 470,085. The chief rivers arc the two which confer their names on the department, but there are others of great value, such as the Doubs, the Arroux, the Seille, and the Garonne. It is favoured, too, by the Canal of Digoin, and the Central Canal, which commences at Digoin, and terminates in the Saone at Chalons. The surface is covered with hills, some of which are 2400 feet in height, with rich valleys between them. The soil, upon the whole, is highly fruitful, though in parts chalky, stony, or sandy. The strip from Chalons to Maçon, along the Loire, is one of the finest in France, consisting, on one side of the river, of extensive rich natural meadows, and on the other of gentle acclivities covered with corn and vines. The agriculture has been much increased by bringing into cultivation large portions of land before covered with woods. There are some mines of iron and coal, but their product is not large. There are some manufactures, chiefly for home consumption. The trade consists chiefly in exporting the fruits of the soil, especially corn, wine, hay, wool, and some timber and coal. The capital of the department is the city of Maçon, which in 1836 contained 11,944 inhabitants.</p><p>SAP, the juice found in vegetables. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Vegetable Physiology.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sap,</hi> in sieges, is a trench, or an approach made under cover, of ten or twelve feet in breadth, when the besiegers come near the place, and the fire from the garrison grows so dangerous that they are not able to approach uncovered. There are several sorts of saps ; the single, which has only a single parapet ; the double, having one on each side ; and the flying, made with gabions. In all saps traverses are left to cover the men.</p><p>SAPAROUA, one of the Amboyna Isles, about twenty miles in circumference.

A brigade of sappers generally consists of eight men, divided equally into parties ; and whilst one of these is advancing the sap, the other is furnishing the gabions, fascines, and other necessary implements. They relieve each other alternately.</p><p>SAPPHIRA was the wife of a rich merchant in Gueldres, and equally distinguished for her beauty and her virtue. Rhinsauld, a German officer, and governor of the town of Gueldres, fell in love with her ; and not being able, either</p><p>by promises or presents, to seduce her, he imprisoned her husband, pretending that he kept up a traitorous correspondence with the enemies of the state. Sapphira yielded to the passion of the governor in order to relieve her husband from chains ; but private orders had already been given to put him to death. His unhappy widow, overwhelmed with grief, complained to Charles duke of Burgundy. He ordered Rhinsauld to marry her, after having made over to her all his possessions ; and as soon as the deed was signed, and the marriage over, Charles commanded him to be put to death. Thus the children of a wife whom he had seduced, and of a husband whom he had murdered, became lawful heirs to all his wealth.</p><p>SAPPHO, a celebrated poetess of antiquity, who for her excellence in the art has been called the <hi rend="italic">Tenth Muse,</hi> was born at Mitylene, in the isle of Lesbos, about 610 years before Christ. She was contemporary with Stesichorus and Alcæus.</p><p>Of her numerous poems there is nothing remaining but some small fragments, which the ancient scholiasts have cited ; a hymn to Venus, preserved by Dionysius of Halicarnassus ; and an ode.</p><p>Ovid introduces her as making a sacrifice to Phaon, one of her paramours. She fell desperately in love with Phaon, and did all she could to win him, but in vain ; upon which she threw herself headlong from a rock, and died. The Mitylenians held her in such high esteem that they paid her sovereign honours after her death, and stamped their money with her image. The Romans erected a noble statue of porphyry to her; and the ancients as well as moderns have done honour to her memory. Vossius says that none of the Greek poets excelled Sappho for sweetness of verse ; and that she made Archilochus the model of her style, but at the same time took care to soften the severity of his expression. It must be granted, from what is left us of Sappho, that Longinus had great reason to extol the admirable genius of this woman ; for there is in what remains something delicate, harmonious, and impassioned to the last degree.</p><p>SAPY <hi rend="smallcaps">Straits.</hi> These are between the east end of the island Sumbawa, and the west side of Commodo or Rotten Island. The southern entrance is in long. 119. 20. E. and lat. 8. 40. S. Numerous small islands are found in this strait, which by contracting, increase the rapidity of the current, and render navigation dangerous.</p><p>SARABAND, in Spanish <hi rend="italic">zarabanda,</hi> a Spanish dance</p><p>3</p><p>in - time, formerly danced with castanets.
