a town of Hindustan, in the district of Khyra- bad, belonging to the nabob of Oude, situated in a bleak and desolate country, without a tree or a shrub to shade the arid soil. In the vicinity is an extensive lake. Sandy is twenty-five miles south-east from Furruckabad. Long. 70. 58. E. Lat. 27. 18. N.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sandy Desert,</hi> an extensive tract in Hindustan, so named in the maps, bounded on the south by the province of Cutch, on the east by that of Gujerat, on the west by Sinde, and on the north by Ajmecr. This region is but little known to Europeans ; but, from the accounts of those by whom it has been traversed, it does not appear to be such a uniform and barren wilderness as it has been represented, being interspersed with many fertile spots, the seats of petty chiefships or stationary tribes. The most powerful of these chiefs are the Beloochee Kosahs, who settled in the country a good many years ago, and are a race of sanguinary thieves, who infest the district of Parkur, and extend their ravages to the Joudpour territories. They amount to about 12,000. They disown all allegiance to any superior, subsisting by their horses and their swords, and hiring out their services to the different predatory chieftains. The only produce of this tract is a coarse species of grain, which only grows where the sandy soil is a little mixed with clay. Wa</p><p>termelons grow abundantly and in great perfection throughout the whole of this parched region, and furnish a most grateful refreshment. The river Loonee, which comes from Marwar, runs through the Gurrah district, and is said to fall into the Run, which bounds Cutch to the north. The route across this tract of country from Rahdunpore is fifty coss, and is said to be good the whole way. Thirty coss west from Pareenuggur is situated Islamnaggur. The intervening country consists of sand-hills, in traversing which the traveller is exposed to great hardship from the heat, the glare, and the want of water. All over this sandy tract are to be found scattered jungle, and coarse vegetation of different sorts, which supply the cattle with food. Islamnaggur is described as a strong fort, situated in the desert, and destitute of water without the walls. The country north from Parkur, towards Amercote, is called Dhat, and the distance is eighty coss. The country is of the same character as that already described, being composed of sand-hills and jungle, with occasional wells. In many parts there is no cultivation, and the inhabitants subsist on the produce of their numerous flocks of cattle, and camels. The natives are described as pacifically inclined, possessing few horses, and armed with swords only. It was in this tract that the array of the celebrated Mahmoud of Ghizni was nearly lost.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sandy Island,</hi> a small island near the west coast of Sumatra. Long. 100. 18. E. Lat. 1. 50. S. It is another in the Eastern Seas. Long. 112. 48. E. Lat. 10. 40. N. Also a small island in the Chinese Sea, near the coast of Cochin China. Long. 109. 12. E. Lat. 12. 28.
