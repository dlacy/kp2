<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font0">depoſits : but as ſoon as it overflows its banks, the ' very enlargement of its ſection diminiſhes the velocity&nbsp;of the water ; and it may be obſerved ſtill running in&nbsp;the track of its bed with great velocity, while the waters on each ſide are ſtagnant at a very ſmall diſtance :&nbsp;Therefore the water, on getting over the banks, muſt&nbsp;depoſit the heavieſt, the firmeſt, and even the greateſt&nbsp;part of its burden, and muſt become gradually clearer&nbsp;to it approaches the hills. Thus a gentle ſlope is given&nbsp;as the valley in a direction which is the reverſe of what&nbsp;one would expect. It is, however, almoſt always the&nbsp;caſe in wide valleys, eſpecially if the great river comes&nbsp;through a ſoft country. The banks of the brooks and&nbsp;ditches are obſerved to be deeper as they approach the&nbsp;river, and the merely ſuperſicial drains run backwards</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">from it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have already obſerved, that the enlargement of-the bed of a river, in its approach to the ſea, is not in proportion to the increaſe of its waters. This would&nbsp;be the caſe even if the velocity continued the ſame :&nbsp;and therefore, ſince the velocity even increaſes, in con-ſequence of the greater energy of a large body of ∖ya-ter, which we now underſtand diſtinctly, a ſtill ſmaller&nbsp;bed is ſufficient for conveying all the water to the&nbsp;ſea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This general law is broken, however, in the immediate neighbourhood of the ſea ; becauſe in this ſituation the velocity of the water is checked by the paſſing flood-tides of the ocean. As the whole waters muſt&nbsp;ſtill be diſeharged, they require a larger bed, and the&nbsp;enlargement will be chiefly in width. The fand and&nbsp;mud are depoſited when the motion is retarded. The&nbsp;depth of the mouth of the channel is therefore dimi-niihed. It muſt therefore become wider. If this be&nbsp;done on a coaſt expoſed to the force of a regular tide,&nbsp;which carries the waters of the ocean acroſs the mouth&nbsp;of the river, this regular enlargement of the mouth will '&nbsp;be the only conſequence, and it will generally widen&nbsp;till it waſhes the foot of the adjoining hills ; but if</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">- there be no tide in the ſea, or a tide which does not </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſet</span><span class="font0"> acroſs the mouth of the river, the ſands muſt be depoſited at the ſides of the opening, and become additions to the ſliore, lengthening the mouth of the chan-.nel. In this ſheltered ſituation, every trivial circumſtance will cauſe the river' to work more on particular&nbsp;parts of the bottom, and deepen the channel there.&nbsp;This keeps the mud ſuſpended in ſuch parts of the&nbsp;channel, and it is not depoſited till the ſtream has ſhot&nbsp;farther out into the ſea. It is depoſited on the ſides&nbsp;of thoſe deeper parts of the channel, and increaſes the&nbsp;velocity in them, and thus ſtill farther protracts the de-poſition. Rivers ſo ſituated will not only lengthen their&nbsp;channels, but will divide them, and produce iſlands at&nbsp;their mouths. A buſh, a tree, torn up by the roots&nbsp;by a mountain torrent, and floated down the ſtream,&nbsp;will thus inevitably produce an iſland; and rivers in&nbsp;which this is common will be continually ſhifting their&nbsp;mouths. The Miſſiflippi is a moſt remarkable inſtance&nbsp;of this. It has a long courſe through a rich- ſoil, and&nbsp;diſembogucs itſelf into the bay of Mexico, in a place&nbsp;where there is no </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paſſing tide,</span><span class="font0"> as may be ſeen by comparing the hours of high water in different places. No&nbsp;river that we know carries down its ſtream ſuch numbers of rooted-up trees : they frequently interrupt the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">navigation, and render it always </span><span class="font0">dangerous </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in the </span><span class="font0">nighU-</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">time. This river is ſo beſet with flats and ſhifting ſands at its mouth, that the moſt experienced pilots are puzzled ; and it has protruded its channel above 50 miles&nbsp;in the ſhort period that we have known it. The diſcharge of the Danube is very ſimilar : ſo is that of the&nbsp;Nile ; for it is diſeharged into a ſtill corner of the Mediterranean. It may now be ſaid to have acquired&nbsp;conſiderable permanency; but much of this is owing to&nbsp;human induſtry, which ſtrips it as much as poſſible </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">its ſubſideable matter. The Ganges too is in a ſituation pretty ſimilar, and exhibits ſimilar phenomena.&nbsp;The Maragnon might be noticed as an exception ; but.&nbsp;it is not an exception. It has flowed very ſar in a&nbsp;level bed, and its waters come pretty clear to Para ;&nbsp;but beſides, there is a ſtrong tranſverle tide, or rather&nbsp;current, at its mouth, ſetting to the ſouth-eaſt both&nbsp;during flood and ebb. The mouth of the Po is perhaps the moſt remarkable of any on the ſurface of this&nbsp;globe, and exhibits appearances extremely Angular. Its&nbsp;diſcharge is into a ſequeſtered corner of the Adriatic.&nbsp;Though there be a more remarkable tide in this gulf&nbsp;than in any part of the Mediterranean, it is ſtill but&nbsp;trifling, and it either ſets directly in upon the mouth&nbsp;of the river, or retires ſtraight away from it. The&nbsp;river has many mouths, and they ſhift prodigiouſly.&nbsp;There has been a general increaſe of the land&nbsp;very remarkable. The marſhes where Venice now&nbsp;ſtands were, in the Auguſtan age, everywhere penetrable by the ſiſhing boats, and in the yth century&nbsp;could only bear a few miſerable huts ; now<sup>r</sup> they are&nbsp;covered with crowds of ſtately buildings. Ravenna, ſi-tuated on the ſouthernmoſt mouth of the Po, was, in&nbsp;the Auguſtan age, at the extremity of a ſwamp, and&nbsp;the road to it was along the top of an artificial mound,&nbsp;made by Auguſtus at immenſe expence. It was, however, a fine city, containing extenſive docks, arſenals,&nbsp;and other maſſy buildings, being the great military port&nbsp;of the empire, where Auguſtus laid up his great ſhips&nbsp;,of war. In the Gothic times it became almoſt the capital of the Weſtern empire, and was the ſeat of government and of luxury. It muſt, therefore, be ſuppo-ſed to have every accommodation of opulence, and we&nbsp;cannot doubt of its having paved ſtreets, wharfs, &amp;c. ;&nbsp;ſo that its wealthy inhabitants were at leaſt walking&nbsp;dryfooted from houſe to houſc. But now it is an Italian mile from the ſea, and ſurrounded with vineyards&nbsp;and cultivated fields, and is acceſſible in every direction.&nbsp;All this muſt have been formed by depoiitions from the-Po, flowing through Lombardy loaded with the ſpoils&nbsp;of the Alp», which were here arreſted by the reeds and&nbsp;bulruſhes of the marſh. Theſe things are in common&nbsp;courſe ; but when wells are dug, we come to the pavements of the ancient city, and theſe. pavements are all&nbsp;on one exact level, and they </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">are eigh t ſeet below the ſurface of the ſea at low water.</span><span class="font0"> This cannot be aſeribed&nbsp;to the fubſiding. of the ancient city. This would be&nbsp;irregular, and greateſt among the heavy buildings. The&nbsp;tomb of Theodoric remains, and the pavement round it&nbsp;is on a level with all the others. The lower ſtory is always full of water ; ſo is the lower ſtory of the cathedral to the depth of three feet. The ornaments of both&nbsp;theſe buildings leave no room to doubt that they were&nbsp;formerly dry ; and ſuch a building as the cathedral&nbsp;could not fink without crumbling into pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It is by no means eaſy to account for all this. The.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
