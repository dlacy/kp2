This is generally much softer and better accommodated to economical purposes than spring water. For though rivers proceed originally from springs, yet, by their rapid motion, and by being exposed during a long course to the influence of the sun and air, the earthy and metallic salts which they contain are decomposed, the acid flies off, and the terrestrial parts precipitate to the bottom. Rivers are also rendered softer by the vast quantity of rain water, which, passing along the surface of the earth, is conveyed into their channels. But all rivers carry with them a great deal of mud and other impurities ; and when they flow near large and populous towns, they become impregnated with a number of heterogeneous substances, in which state the water is certainly unfit for many purposes ; yet, by remaining for some time at rest, all the feculencies subside, and the water becomes sufficiently pure for most of the common purposes of life. River-water may be rendered still purer by filtration through sand and gravel.</hi></p><p>RIVERHEAD, a town of the county of Kent, in the lathe of Sutton and hundred of Codsheath, twenty-two miles from London. The river Darent, which rises within the parish, has given its name to it. In this parish is the elegant seat of Lord Amherst, called Montreal. A new church in the Gothic style has been lately erected and consecrated. It is situated within the parish of Seven Oaks. The population was in 1801, 750; in 1811, 1012; in 1821, 1216; andin 1831, 1420.</p><p>RIVOLI, a city of the kingdom of Sardinia, in Italy, in the province of Piedmont. It is situated at the south foot of the Alps, on the great road over those mountains by way of Mount Cenis. A remarkable castle near it was long the place of residence of King Victor Amadeus, after his abdication of the throne, and he died there in 1732. The prospect from tllis castle, comprehending a view of the city of Turin, and the beautiful country surrounding it, is peculiarly exciting. The population consists of 6100 inhabitants, who are occupied in the manufactures of silk, linen, and woollen goods, of various kinds.</p><p>ROAD, in <hi rend="italic">Navigation,</hi>  a bay or place of anchorage, at some distance from the shore, whither vessels occasionally repair to receive intelligence, orders, or necessary supplies, or to wait for a fair wind. The excellence of a road consists chiefly in its being protected from the reigning winds and the swell of the sea, in having a good anchoring ground, and being at a competent distance from the shore. Those which are not sufficiently protected are termed <hi rend="italic">open roads.</hi></p><p>ROAD-MAKING. There are few departments of practical mechanics in which every individual, at some period or other of his life, is more immediately interested than in the management of roads and pavements. The mechanical theory of the motions of wheel-carriages, and of the nature of the frictions and resistances that they have to</p><lb/><p>overcome, as relating to the ultimate objects for which roads are constructed, may naturally constitute the first section of an essay on this subject ; the second will naturally comprehend the best arrangement of the means for attaining those objects, by the form and construction of such roads and pavements as appear to be the most eligible under various circumstances ; and the third may be devoted to some historical illustrations of the principal roads which exist, or which have existed, in various parts of the world.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect. I__</hi><hi rend="italic">Of the Objects of Roads.</hi></p><p>The grand object of all modem roads is the accommodation of wheel-carriages. The construction of footpaths and of bridle-roads is so simple as to require very little separate consideration ; except that, in cities and towns, the convenience of the inhabitants requires that some pains should be taken to avoid dust, and has generally been a reason for employing pavements in preference to gravel roads, which might in some other respects be more eligible.</p><p>For facilitating the motion of carriages, the most essential requisite is to have the road as smooth, and as hard, and as level as possible. The wheels of carriages are principally useful in diminishing the friction of the materials; a dray sliding without wheels, even on a railroad of greased and polished iron, would have to overcome a friction as much greater than that of the wheel on its axle, as the diameter of the wheel is greater than that of the axle. The wheels assist us also in drawing a carriage over an obstacle ; for the path which the axis of the wheel describes is always smoother and less abrupt than the surface of a rough road, on which the wheel rolls, and so much the smoother as the wheel is larger, since the portions of larger circles, which constitute the path in question, are less curved than those of smaller ones.</p><p>But in all common cases of roads not extremely hard, by far the greater part of the resistance actually exhibited by a road to the motion of a carriage, is that which depends on the continual displacement of a portion of the materials from their inelasticity, which causes them to exert a continual pressure on the fore part of the wheel, without rising behind it to propel it forwards by its re-action, as an elastic substance would do. Hence, in a soft sand, although the axles of the wheels may move in a direction perfectly horizontal,· the draught becomes extremely heavy. The more the wheel sinks, the greater is the resistance ; and if we suppose the degree of elasticity of the materials, and their immediate resistance at difterent depths, to be known, we may calculate the whole effect of their action on the wheel, and the force that is required to displace them, in the progressive motion of the carriage. Thus, if the materials were perfectly inelastic, acting only on the preceding half of the immersed portion of the wheel, and their immediate pressure or resistance were simply proportional to the depth,</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
