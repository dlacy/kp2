Writers on musical instruments are not agreed as to&nbsp;which mouthpiece was in use on the aulos; the probability is&nbsp;that both were in use at one time or another, and that the double&nbsp;reed, being the most primitive and also the more adaptable, was&nbsp;the older contrivance. There is no sign of any suitable attachment&nbsp;for a beating reed on any of the pipes of ancient Greece extant,&nbsp;whereas among the ivory pipes recovered from the ruins of&nbsp;Pompeii there is a fragment which may have been a beak mouthpiece with beating reed similar to that of the modern clarinet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ancient Egyptians used the primitive beating reed familiarly known as “ squeaker,&quot; obtained by making a slight lateral slit&nbsp;across a reed pipe or stem of straw, and with the knife splitting&nbsp;back longitudinally until a tongue was raised; the shorter the&nbsp;tongue the quicker the vibration and the higher the pitch. This&nbsp;small beating reed was then sunk some 3 or 4 in. within the main&nbsp;tube of the instrument; some of these reeds have been discovered&nbsp;in tombs by Professor Flinders Petrie.@@<sup>1</sup> It is certain that the&nbsp;ancient Greeks did not use the reed in this form in the aulos, for&nbsp;classical writers distinctly describe the effect produced on a reed&nbsp;by taking it into the mouth, but it is equally certain that they&nbsp;were acquainted with the principle of the drone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The history of the keyboard instruments furnishes instances of the early use oí reeds, In the modern English church organ&nbsp;the reed work is provided with beating reeds only, but in Germany,&nbsp;for the sake of obtaining the power of expression, a set of free-reed&nbsp;stops is nearly always added.@@<sup>2</sup> It is probable that some of the&nbsp;early pneumatic and hydraulic organs (see Organ) at the beginning&nbsp;of our era were provided with beating reeds in imitation of the&nbsp;bagpipe chaunter and drones. In the middle ages the regal&nbsp;(</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font0">), a small, portative reed-organ fitted with beating reeds, was&nbsp;extremely popular in England and all over the continent </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">Europe,&nbsp;but more especially in Germany and Italy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(K.

<p><span class="font1">REES, THOMAS (1777-1864), Welsh Nonconformist divine, was born at Gelligron, Glamorgan, and educated at the Presbyterian College, Carmarthen. He entered the Unitarian&nbsp;ministry in 1807 at Newington Green Chapel, London, removing&nbsp;to Southwark 1813 and to Stamford Street, Blackfriars, in 1823.&nbsp;He had the degree of LL.D. of Glasgow (1819). He had a&nbsp;great knowledge of the history of anti-trinitarian opinion,&nbsp;especially during the 16th century. His scattered papers,&nbsp;chiefly in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monthly Repository</span><span class="font1"> (1818-22), on such subjects as&nbsp;“ Faustus Socinus and Francis David,” “ The Italian Reformation,” “ Memoirs of the Socini,” are important.

<p><span class="font1">REEVE, CLARA (1729-1807), English novelist, daughter of William Reeve, a Suffolk clergyman, was born at Ipswich in 1729.&nbsp;She was an industrious writer, and produced many works in&nbsp;prose and verse, including a history of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Progress of Romance&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1785); but her only eminent success was the novel of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Old&nbsp;English Baron</span><span class="font1"> (1777), originally published under the title of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Champion of Virtue.</span><span class="font1"> In the history of the English novel&nbsp;she stands midway between Walpole and Mrs. Radcliffe.

<p><span class="font1">REEVE, HENRY (1813-1895), English publicist, younger son of Henry Reeve, a well-known Whig physician and writer&nbsp;of Norwich, and nephew of Mrs. Sarah Austin, was born at&nbsp;Norwich on the 9th of September 1813. He was educated at&nbsp;the Norwich grammar school under Edward Valpy. During his&nbsp;holidays he saw a good deal of the young John Stuart Mill. In&nbsp;1829 he studied at Geneva and mixed in Genevese society, then&nbsp;very brilliant, and including the Sismondis, Huber, Bonstetten,&nbsp;De Candolle, Rossil, Krasinski (his most intimate friend), and&nbsp;Mickiewicz, whose </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Faris</span><span class="font1"> he translated. During a visit to&nbsp;London in 1831 he was introduced to Thackeray and Carlyle,&nbsp;while through the Austins he made the acquaintance of other&nbsp;men of letters. Next year, in Paris, he met Victor Hugo,&nbsp;Cousin, and Scott. He travelled in Italy, sat under Schelling&nbsp;at Munich and under Tieck at Dresden, became in 1835-36 a&nbsp;frequenter of Madame de Circourt*s salon, and numbered among&nbsp;his friends Lamartine, Lacordaire, De Vigny, Thiers, Guizot,&nbsp;Montalembert, and De Tocqueville, of whose books, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Démocratie&nbsp;en Amérique</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ancien régime,</span><span class="font1"> he made standard translations into English. In 1837 he was made clerk of appeal&nbsp;and then registrar to the judicial committee of the Privy Council.&nbsp;From 1840 to 1855 he wrote for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Times,</span><span class="font1"> his close touch with&nbsp;men like Guizot, Bunsen, Lord Clarendon, and his own chief&nbsp;at the Privy Council Office, Charles Greville, enabling him to&nbsp;write with authority on foreign policy during the critical period&nbsp;from 1848 to the end of the Crimean War. Upon the promotion&nbsp;of Sir George Cornewall Lewis to the Cabinet early in 1855&nbsp;Reeve was asked by Longman to edit the April number of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh Review,</span><span class="font1"> to which his father had been one of the&nbsp;earliest contributors, and in the following July he became the&nbsp;editor. His friendship with the Orleanist leaders in France&nbsp;survived all vicissitudes, but he was appealed to for guidance&nbsp;by successive French ambassadors, and was more than once&nbsp;the medium of private negotiations between the English and&nbsp;French governments. In April 1863 he published what was&nbsp;perhaps the most important of his contributions to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh—</span><span class="font1">a searching review of Kinglake’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crimea',</span><span class="font1"> and in 1872&nbsp;he brought out a selection of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quarterly</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">articles on eminent Frenchmen, entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Royal and Republican&nbsp;France.</span><span class="font1"> Three years later appeared the first of three instalments (1875, 1885 and 1887) of his edition of the famous&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font1"> which Charles Greville had placed in his hands a few&nbsp;hours before his death in 1865. A purist in point of form and&nbsp;style, of the school of Macaulay and Milman, Reeve outlived&nbsp;his literary generation, and became eventually one of the most&nbsp;reactionary of old Whigs. Yet he continued to edit and upon&nbsp;the whole to maintain the reputation of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh</span><span class="font1"> until&nbsp;his death at his seat of Foxholes, in Hants, on the 21st of&nbsp;October 1895.

A striking panegyric was pronounced upon him by his lifelong friend, the duc d’Aumale, before the&nbsp;Académie des Sciences in November 1895.</span></p>
