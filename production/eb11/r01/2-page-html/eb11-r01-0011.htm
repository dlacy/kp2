In 1855 she made a tour in the United States with comparatively small success,&nbsp;but this was after her powers, through continued ill-health, bad&nbsp;begun to deteriorate. She died of consumption at Cannet, near&nbsp;Nice, on the 4th of January 1858, and was buried in the Jewish&nbsp;part of the cemetery of Père Lachaise in Paris. Rachel’s third&nbsp;sister was Lia Felix (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q. υ. ).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RACINE, JEAN (1639-1699), French tragic dramatist, was born at La Ferté Milon in the old duchy of Valois on an uncertain&nbsp;date in December 1639. He was certainly christened on the&nbsp;22nd, and the ceremony was at that time often, though not&nbsp;invariably, performed on the day of birth. Racine belonged to a&nbsp;family of the upper bourgeoisie, which had indeed been technically ennobled some generations earlier, and bore the punning&nbsp;arms of a rat and a swan (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rat</span><span class="font1">, cygne). The poet himself subsequently dropped the rat. His family were connected with&nbsp;others of the same or a slightly higher station in La Ferté and&nbsp;its neighbourhood—the Desmoulins, the Sconins, the Vitarts,&nbsp;all of whom appear in Racine’s life. His mother was Jeanne&nbsp;Sconin. His father, of the same name as himself, was only&nbsp;four-and-twenty at the time of the poet’s birth. He seems to&nbsp;have been a solicitor </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(procureur)</span><span class="font1"> by profession, and held, as his&nbsp;father, the grandfather of the dramatist, had done, the office of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">controleur au grenier à sel.</span><span class="font1"> Racine was the eldest child. Little&nbsp;more than a year afterwards his sister Marie was born and his&nbsp;mother died. Jean Racine the elder married again, but three&nbsp;months later he himself died, and the stepmother is never heard&nbsp;of in connexion with the poet or his sister. They were left&nbsp;without any provision, but their grandparents, Jean Racine&nbsp;the eldest and Marie Desmoulins, were still living, and took&nbsp;charge of them. These grandparents had a daughter, Agnes,&nbsp;who figures in Racine’s history. She was a nun and later abbess&nbsp;of Port Royal under the style of Mère de Sainte Thècle, and&nbsp;the whole family had strong Jansenist leanings. Jean Racine&nbsp;the eldest died in 1649, and the poet was sent to the College de&nbsp;Beauvais. This (which was the grammar-school of the town&nbsp;of that name, and not the famous College de Beauvais at Paris)&nbsp;was intimately connected with Port Royal, and to this place&nbsp;Racine was transferred in November 1655. His special masters&nbsp;there were Nicole and Le Maître. The latter, in an extant&nbsp;letter written to his pupil, speaks of himself as “ votre papa. ”&nbsp;It is evident from documents that he was a very diligent student&nbsp;both at Beauvais and Port Royal. He wrote verse both in&nbsp;Latin and French, and his Port Royal odes, which it has been the&nbsp;fashion with the more fanatical admirers of his later poetry to&nbsp;ridicule, are far from despicable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Racine stayed at Port Royal for three years, and left it, when nearly nineteen, in October 1658. He was then entered at the&nbsp;College d’Harcourt and boarded with his second cousin, Nicolas&nbsp;Vitart, steward of the duke of Luynes. Later, if not at first,&nbsp;he lived in the Hôtel de Luynes itself. It is to be observed that&nbsp;his Jansenist surroundings continued with him here, for the&nbsp;duke of Luynes was a severe Port Royalist. It is, however,&nbsp;clear from Racine’s correspondence, which, as we have it, begins&nbsp;in 1660 and is for some years very abundant and interesting,&nbsp;that he was not at all of an austere disposition at this&nbsp;time. Occasionally the liveliness of the letters passes the&nbsp;bounds of strict decency, though there is nothing very shocking&nbsp;in them, and those to Madame (or, as the habit of the time called&nbsp;her, Mademoiselle) Vitart are free from anything of this kind.&nbsp;It does not appear that Racine read much philosophy, as he&nbsp;should have done, but he occasionally did some business in&nbsp;superintending building operations at Chcvreuse, the duke’s&nbsp;country house. He would seem, however, to have been already&nbsp;given up irrevocably to literature. This by no means suited&nbsp;the views of his devout relations at Port Royal, and he complains&nbsp;in one of his letters that an unlucky sonnet on Mazarin had&nbsp;brought down on him “excommunications sur excommunications. ” The marriage of Louis XIV. was the occasion of an&nbsp;ambitious ode, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La nymphe de la Seine</span><span class="font1">, which was submitted&nbsp;before publication to Jean Chapelain, the too famous author of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pucelle.</span><span class="font1"> Chapelain made many suggestions which Racine&nbsp;duly adopted. Nor did the ode bound his ambitions, for in&nbsp;1660 he finished one piece, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amasie,</span><span class="font1"> and undertook another,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Amours d'Ovide,</span><span class="font1"> for the theatre. The first, however, was&nbsp;rejected by the actors of the Marais, and it is not certain that the&nbsp;other was ever finished or offered to those of the Hôtel de&nbsp;Bourgogne. Racine’s letters show that he was intimate with&nbsp;more than one actress at this time; he also made acquaintance&nbsp;with La Fontaine, and the foundations at any rate of the&nbsp;legendary “ society of four ” (Boileau, La Fontaine, Molière&nbsp;and Racine) were thus laid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His relations were pretty certainly alarmed by this very pardonable worldliness, though a severe expostulation with&nbsp;him for keeping company with the abominable actors is perhaps&nbsp;later in date. Racine was accordingly disturbed in his easygoing life at Paris. In November 1661 he went to Uzès in&nbsp;Languedoc to live with his uncle the Père Sconin, vicar-general&nbsp;of that diocese, whose attempts to secure 'a benefice for his&nbsp;nephew were, however, in vain. Racine was back in Paris&nbsp;before the end of 1663. His letters from Uzès to La Fontaine,&nbsp;to Le Vasseur, and others are in much the same strain as&nbsp;before, but there is here and there a marked tone of cynicism&nbsp;in them. He also attempted a little courtiership. An ode&nbsp;on the recovery of Louis XIV. from a slight illness probably&nbsp;secured him the promise of a pension, of which he speaks to his&nbsp;sister in the summer of 1664. It is uncertain whether this&nbsp;pension is identical with “ gratifications ” which we know that&nbsp;Racine for some years received, and which were sometimes&nbsp;eight and sometimes six hundred livres. It would seem not,&nbsp;as one of these gratifications had been allotted to him the year&nbsp;before he so wrote to his sister. The ode in which he thanked&nbsp;the king for his presents, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Renommée,</span><span class="font1"> is said to have introduced him to Boileau, to whose censorship there is no doubt&nbsp;that he owed much, if not everything; and from this date,&nbsp;November 1663, the familiarity of “ the four ” seems to have&nbsp;existed in full force. Unfortunately it is precisely at this date&nbsp;that his correspondence ceases, and it is not renewed till after&nbsp;the close of his brief but brilliant career as a dramatist </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Esther&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie</span><span class="font1"> excepted). From this time forward the gossip of&nbsp;the period, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> by his son Louis, are the chief sources of&nbsp;information. Unfortunately Louis Racine, though a man of&nbsp;some ability and of unimpeached character, was only six years&nbsp;old when his father died, and had no direct knowledge. Still&nbsp;his account represents family papers and traditions; and seems&nbsp;to have been carefully, as it is certainly in the main impartially,&nbsp;written. From other sources—notably Boileau, Claude&nbsp;Brossette and Jean Baptiste de Valincourt—a good deal of&nbsp;pretty certainly authentic information is obtainable, and there&nbsp;exists a considerable body of correspondence between Boileau&nbsp;and the poet during the last ten years of Racine’s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first but the least characteristic of the dramas by which Racine is known, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Thébaide,</span><span class="font1"> was finished by the end of 1663,&nbsp;and on Friday 20th June 1664 it was played by Molière’s company at the Palais Royal theatre. Some editors assert that&nbsp;Molière himself acted in it, but the earliest account of the&nbsp;cast we have, and that is sixty years after date, omits his name,&nbsp;though those of Madeleine Béjard and Mademoiselle de Brie&nbsp;occur. There is also a tradition that Molière suggested the&nbsp;subject; but Louis Racine distinctly says that his father&nbsp;wrote most of the play at Uzès before he knew Molière. From&nbsp;Racine’s own earlier letters it appears that the play was designed for the rival theatre, and that “ La Déhanchée, ” Racine’s&nbsp;familiar name for Mademoiselle de Beauchâteau, with whom&nbsp;he was intimate, was to play Antigone. The play itself is by&nbsp;far the weakest of Racine’s works. He has borrowed much&nbsp;from Euripides and not a little from Jean de Rotrou; and in&nbsp;his general style and plan he has as yet struck out no great&nbsp;variation from Corneille. It was acted twelve times during&nbsp;the first month, and was occasionally revived during the year&nbsp;following. This is apparently the date of the pleasant picture</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
