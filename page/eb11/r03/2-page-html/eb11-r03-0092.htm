When the flow falls&nbsp;very low in dry weather, the outlet of a river is sometimes&nbsp;completely closed by a continuous line of beach, any inland&nbsp;or tidal waters merely trickling through the obstruction;&nbsp;and it is only on the descent of floods that the outlet is opened&nbsp;out. In rivers which always have a fair fresh-water discharge,&nbsp;or a small fresh-water flow combined with a tidal flow and ebb,&nbsp;the channel sometimes has its direct outlet closed, and is&nbsp;deflected parallel to the shore till it reaches a weak place in&nbsp;the line of beach, through which a new outlet is formed; or,&nbsp;where the current is strong enough to keep the outlet open,&nbsp;a bar is formed across the entrance by the littoral drift, reducing&nbsp;the navigable depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jetties at River Outlets.</span><span class="font1">—The bar formed by littoral drift across the outlet of a river not charged with sediment and flowing into a&nbsp;tideless sea can be lowered by carrying out solid jetties </span><span class="font0">on </span><span class="font1">each side&nbsp;of the outlet across the foreshore, so as to scour the bar by concentrating the issuing current&nbsp;over it. . Thus by means of&nbsp;jetties, aided by dredging, the&nbsp;depth at the entrance to the&nbsp;Swine mouth of the Oder has&nbsp;been increased from 7 ft. to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">22%</span><span class="font1"> ft.; the approach channels&nbsp;to the river Pernau (fig. 9) and&nbsp;other Russian rivers flowing&nbsp;into the Baltic . have been&nbsp;deepened by jetties, and the&nbsp;outlet channels of some of the&nbsp;rivers flowing into the Great&nbsp;Lakes of North America have&nbsp;been improved by crib-work</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">jetties and dredging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where the littoral drift is</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">powerful enough to divert the outlet of a river, as in the case&nbsp;of the river Yare, which at one&nbsp;time was driven to an outlet&nbsp;4 m. south of. its direct course&nbsp;into the sea at Yarmouth, and&nbsp;the river Adour in France,&nbsp;whose outlet, owing to the&nbsp;violent storms of the Bay of Biscay, was liable to be shifted 18 m.&nbsp;from its proper position, it has proved practicable to fix as well as&nbsp;to deepen the outlet by means of jetties (fig. 10). In such cases,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">however, where the rivers flow into tidal seas, it is important to place the jetties sufficiently apart to avoid any loss of tidal influx,&nbsp;since the tidal flow assists the fresh-water discharge in keeping the&nbsp;outlet open; whereas, with rivers flowing into tideless seas, a&nbsp;moderate restriction of the width between the jetties increases the&nbsp;scour. The tortuous and somewhat shifting outlet channel of the&nbsp;Scheur branch of the river Maas, emerging on to a sandy coast&nbsp;where the rise of tide is small, and obstructed at its mouth by a&nbsp;bar, has been replaced by a straight cut across the Hook of Holland,&nbsp;and by an outlet guided across the foreshore and fixed in position&nbsp;by fascine mattress jetties (see Jetty), the maintenance of the&nbsp;depth at the mouth by the tidal and fresh waters being aided by&nbsp;frequent dredging (figs. 11 and 12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dellaic Outlets of Tideless Rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Large rivers heavily charged with sand and silt, when their</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">current is gradually arrested on entering a tideless sea, deposit these materials as a constantly advancing fan-shaped&nbsp;shoal in front of their mouths, through which comparatively&nbsp;shallow divcrging channels, almost devoid of fall, have to&nbsp;force their way in order to convey the fresh-water discharge</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">into the sea (fig. 13). These deltaic channels deposit their burden of sediment in front of their outlets, forming bars which</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">advance with the delta and whose rate of progress seawards and distance in front of each outlet are proportionate to the&nbsp;discharge of the several channels. A channel simply dredged&nbsp;on the bar in front of one of the outlets of a deltaic river is&nbsp;only maintained for a moderate period on account of the large&nbsp;volume of deposit continually accumulating at the outlet.&nbsp;Thus the channel in front of the outlet of the south-west pass&nbsp;of the Mississippi delta, when deepened from 13 ft. to 18 ft.&nbsp;over its bar by dredging many years ago, was soon silted up&nbsp;again on the discontinuance of the dredging; whilst the depth&nbsp;of the outlet channel of one of the branches of the Volga delta,&nbsp;which was increased from 4 ft. to 8 ft., could only be maintained&nbsp;by regular yearly dredging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parallel Jetties at Delta Outlets.—</span><span class="font1">In order to procure and maintain for some time an adequate deepening across the bar in front of the&nbsp;outlets of delta channels, recourse has been had to the scour of the&nbsp;issuing current concentrated and extended out to the bar by parallel&nbsp;jetties, forming prolongations seawards of the banks of the channel.&nbsp;The requisite conditions for the success of this system of improvement are a good depth in the sea beyond the bar, allowing of a&nbsp;considerable deposit of alluvium before the increased depth is&nbsp;interfered with, and a littoral current carrying a portion of the&nbsp;alluvium away from the outlet, both of which retard the progression&nbsp;of the delta in front of the outlet and the inevitable eventual formation of a new bar farther out. The rate of advance, of a. delta&nbsp;depends also on the proportion of solid matter contained in the&nbsp;river water and on fhe specific gravity and size of the particles of&nbsp;alluvium discharged into the sea ; for the heavier and coarser materials,&nbsp;and especially those which are rolled along the bed of the channels,&nbsp;come first to rest. Moreover, as the larger channels of a delta&nbsp;bring down a larger volume of alluvium on account of their larger&nbsp;discharge, and as their bars form farther seawards from their&nbsp;outlets owing to the issuing current being less rapidly arrested in&nbsp;proportion to the volume discharged, the rate of advance of the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
