The structure of this net is very simple, and is represented in fig. 11. The thread should be very fine, as also that used for the <hi rend="italic">trammels;</hi>  the meshes three quarters of an inch from knot to knot ; two pieces of <hi rend="italic">oblong</hi>  netting, measuring three fathoms by one, are extended to their full width, by being lashed to light staves of the required length, one at each end (see fig. 11, A, A). These two leaves are to be laid on the ground exactly opposite each other, so accurately, that when they are drawn over, the two margins <hi rend="italic">m, m</hi>  shall touch each other. Each leaf is to be staked down with pegs at the lower corners, at G, G, G, G. A line By and By is to be stretched from the top of the stakes B, B, and fastened firmly to the ground by the pegs <hi rend="italic">g, g.</hi>  Another line is to be stretched from the head of the stakes <hi rend="italic">b</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>  in the direction of <hi rend="italic">bC, bC,</hi>  and fixed to the ground by a peg C and C. Another line F and F is to proceed from the head of each stake <hi rend="italic">b, b,</hi>  and is to be joined at H to the <hi rend="italic">main line,</hi>  which draws the leaves over ; F, F should each be at least a fathom long. In the centre D is to be placed the doring-glass, whence proceeds a line E. The fowler retires to his ambuscade, and with his left hand he plays the doring-glass with the line E, and holds the <hi rend="italic">main line</hi>  H in his right ; when the birds are seen playing around the glass, and within reach of the net, he pulls the leaves over with a quick jerk, and thus secures them. The <hi rend="italic">doring-glass</hi>  is thus made : Take a piece of wood (AC, fig. 12) nine inches long and one and a half thick, cut out in the shape of an arch, and the edges at the top bevelled off so as to make it a six-sided figure. This bow is to be painted red, and covered with pieces of looking-glass along the sides and at each end ; a wooden peg B, six inches long and three fourths of an inch in circumference, a little pointed at the end, with a hole at I, through which the line E (fig. 11) is threaded, must be fixed to the under surface of the arch, at the centre. Take another piece of wood six inches thick and one foot long (fig. 13), sharpened at the end in order to fix it in the ground ; cut out a mortise</p><p>in it two inches high, and one inch and three fourths deep ; bore a hole at N and O, large enough to receive the peg B (fig. 12). This device is made to act by winding up the string round the peg several turns, and then pulling it ; then letting it wind itself up again, and then jerking it again ; thus making the glass revolve briskly, as children do their toy windmills.</p><p>The object we have had in view is that of embodying, in plain and simple language, a few practical hints on the subject of net-making, so that they may be conveniently consulted by all classes requiring that kind of information. The various engines described may be modified, altered, and combined, as occasion requires. It would be endless to enter into these minutiæ, or to give a catalogue of the different nets used, with the technical name for each in different parts of the kingdom. We shall therefore conclude with a few <hi rend="italic">general observations.</hi>  1. In all cases use twine as fine as circumstances will permit, and make your meshes as large as is consistent with the object in view ; for the nets will be thereby more easily dried, lighter, and more efficient. 2. In filling your needle <hi rend="italic">double,</hi>  draw the twine from separate balls. 3. Take greatcare to dry your nets thoroughly, and hang them up away from walls, where rats and mice cannot get at them. 4. Mend them immediately. 5. Keep them well tanned, or immersed in Kyan’s Patent as often as may be necessary ; but never use tar and oil. This mixture has been proved to be inefficient as a preservative, and to be so offensive to the fish as to drive many away from the nets thus prepared, and to impart an unpleasant flavour to those that are caught in them. 6. If you wish to <hi rend="italic">dye</hi>  your nets green, russet, yellow, &amp;c. for fowling or other purposes, send them to the nearest dyer or tanner, as the cheapest and best mode of treatment.    (b. k.)</p><lb/><p>RETICULUM is a Latin word, signifying a <hi rend="italic">little net </hi>or <hi rend="italic">casting net.</hi>  It was applied by the Romans to a particular mode of constructing their buildings. In the city of Salino may still be seen remains of some walls, evidently of Roman origin, from the <hi rend="italic">reticulum.</hi>  This structure consists of small pieces of baked earth, cut lozenge-wis e, and disposed with great regularity on the angles, so as to exhibit to the eye the appearance of cut diamonds; and it was called <hi rend="italic">reticular,</hi>  from its resemblance to fishing-nets. The Romans always concealed it under a regular coating of other matter ; and Mr Houel informs us, that this was the only specimen of it which he saw in his travels through Sicily, Malta, and the Lapari Islands. It appears to be the remains of some baths, which had been built for the convenience of sea-bathing.</p><p>RETIRADE, in <hi rend="italic">Fortification,</hi>  a kind of retrenchment made in the body of a bastion or other work, which is to be disputed, inch by inch, after the defences are dismantled. It usually consists of two faces, which form a re-entering angle. When a breach is made in a bastion, the enemy may also make retirade or new fortification behind it.</p><p>RETIREMENT means a private way of life, or a secret habitation. “ Few,” says an elegant writer, “ are able to bear solitude ; and though retirement is the ostensible object of the greater part, yet, when they are enabled by success to retire, they feel themselves unhappy. Peculiar powers and elegance of mind are necessary to enable us to draw all our resources from ourselves. In a remote and solitary village the mind must be internally active in a great degree, or it will be miserable for want of employment. But in great and populous cities, even while it is passive, it will be constantly amused. It is impossible to walk the streets without finding the attention powerfully solicited on every side. No exertion is necessary. Objects pour themselves into the senses, and it would be difficult to prevent their admittance. But, in retirement, there must be a spirit of philosophy and a store of learning, or else the fancied scenes of bliss will vanish like the colours of the rainbow. Poor Cowley might be said to be melancholy mad. He languished for solitude, and wished to hide himself in the wilds of America. But he was not able to support the solitude of a country village within a few miles of the metropolis. With a virtuous and cheerful family, with a few faithful and good-humoured friends, with a well-selected collection of elegant books, and with a competency, one may enjoy comforts even in the deserted village, which the city, with all its diversions, cannot supply.”</p><p>RETORT, in <hi rend="italic">Chemistry,</hi>  an oblong or globular vessel of glass or pbrcelain, with its neck bent, proper for distillation.</p><p>RETPOORAH, a town of Hindustan, in the nizam’s territories, province of Berar.
