<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">nematoblasts group themselves round the extremity of certain long projecting epithelial cells, the supporting cells (or “ cellules de&nbsp;soutien,” obviously the spermatoblasts of Yon Ebner), and actually&nbsp;sink into their protoplasm to complete their development. When&nbsp;fully developed, the heads of the young spermatozoa have attained&nbsp;the base of the supporting cell, but this now elongates and bears&nbsp;them anew to the lumen of the duct, where new nematoblasts are&nbsp;by this time waiting to take their place (fig. 5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The researches of Hermann (1882) in Elasmobranchs are broadly confirmatory of those of Semper, while those of Jensen and of&nbsp;Swaen and Masquelin (1883) are especially corroborative of the views&nbsp;of La Valette. The latter are, however, of importance as tending towards reconciliation. The primitive ampullae being formed,&nbsp;the “ male ovules ” and the follicular cells are henceforth distinct:&nbsp;the former segment into spermatogemmae ; the latter (at first forming incomplete envelopes to the male ovule) mostly disappear,&nbsp;save one which travels downwards until it lies between the wall&nbsp;of the ampulla and the spermatogemma, thus constituting its&nbsp;“basilar cell.” The spermatogemma meanwhile is developing a&nbsp;central cavity (“loge caudale”), from which the tails of the&nbsp;incipient spermatozoa or “nematoblasts” project into the lumen of&nbsp;the duct. The basilar cell has also been enlarging, and fusing&nbsp;with the intercellular substance of the spermatogemma; the&nbsp;nematoblasts thus come to be plunged into the basilar cell, and&nbsp;sink downwards towards its nucleus ; but this again elongates to&nbsp;expel them. In the Salamander these follicular cells form a&nbsp;complete envelope to the male ovules during their whole segmentation and subsequent evolution. In Mammals the male ovule&nbsp;divides into an active and a temporarily inert portion (follicular&nbsp;cell of La Yalette, germinative cell of Sertoli and Renson) ; the&nbsp;former segments into the spermatogemma, of which the resultant&nbsp;nematoblasts plunge into the basilar cells, much as described by&nbsp;Renson. They compare the intercellular substance of the spermatogemma to the blastophor described by Blomfield in Worms,&nbsp;and regard the follicular cells as a secondary addition peculiar&nbsp;to Vertebrates, and homologous with the follicular »cells of&nbsp;their ova.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The first step towards any understanding of the process of spermatogenesis amid this maze of controversy is to collate the&nbsp;various observations ; hence the present attempt to summarize the&nbsp;main observations on the subject, and afford a key to the nomenclature. Brat how shall we reconcile the different theories ? Each author&nbsp;formulates his own view of spermatogenesis, and sometimes even&nbsp;admits only a single method </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(e.g.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Von Ebner, Blomfield, &amp;c.); yet,&nbsp;unless we attach considerably greater weight to the observations of&nbsp;at least a majority of all these workers than they sometimes incline&nbsp;to grant to those of each other, the literature and iconography&nbsp;of histology become of little worth. Since La Valette, however,&nbsp;most observers have admitted the existence of several methods ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the homology—indeed the primordial identity of the primitive germinal cells—of male ovule with female ovule has been&nbsp;often pointed out, and the general resemblance of the process&nbsp;of spermatogenesis to that of segmentation has been noted, and&nbsp;even accented by the use of terms like sperm-morula, sperm-blastula,&nbsp;&amp;c. But it is not enough to make such a comparison in general&nbsp;terms ; it must be either susceptible of definite refutation or confirmation by appeal to details ; and the present writer has hence&nbsp;elsewhere attempted to compare the various modes of spermatogenesis with the corresponding modes of segmentation of the ovum,&nbsp;and so reconcile the conflict of testimony and opinion upon the&nbsp;subject.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ontogeny of the Spermatozoon.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> —The origin of the spermatozoon from the spermatocyte is, as we have seen above, a phenomenon of&nbsp;considerable complexity. It has long been known to arise from the&nbsp;nucleus and the tail from the protoplasm, and Flemming in 1880&nbsp;gave further precision to our knowledge by tracing the head of the&nbsp;spermatozoon of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Salamandra</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> from the chromatin of the nucleus.&nbsp;Various observers had also noted, besides the nucleus, the appearance of a small denser mass of protoplasm within the spermatocyte,&nbsp;the “ accessory corpuscle” (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Nebenkcrn</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">corpuscle <sup>,</sup>précurseur</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">), but its&nbsp;origin and fate have scarcely yet been settled with complete clearness. It appears, however, to arise from the nucleus, the remaining&nbsp;portion of the nucleus going to form the main portion of the head,&nbsp;while a film of superjacent protoplasm stretches over it, thickens&nbsp;somewhat to form the middle piece, and becomes drawn out into&nbsp;the filamentous tail, which frees itself from the remains of its spermatocyte and swims away (3 to 8 in fig. 5). Von Brunn has recently&nbsp;described in Birds the origin of this accessory corpuscle with especial&nbsp;clearness by the division of the nucleus of the developing spermatozoon. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mammalia</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the “ cap ” of the young spermatozoon is described by Renson as nucleus, and by others as protoplasm, and it&nbsp;has been compared by many authors to the polar vesicle of the&nbsp;ovum. In Plagiostome Fishes Semper describes, and others confirm, the existence of an additional nucleus, or “problematic&nbsp;body,” which appears to correspond to the sum of the accessory&nbsp;corpuscles of all the spermatozoa, and this, after their escape,&nbsp;has been shown by Swaen and Masquelin to fuse with the nucleus&nbsp;of the basilar cell. The resemblance of this embryonic and transitory structure to the permanent post-nuclear segment of the&nbsp;curious almost amoeboid spermatozoon of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ascaris</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> is closely suggestive of their homology, and it is also interesting to note, in figures&nbsp;of the developing spermatozoa of Selachians, their considerable&nbsp;resemblance to the fringed adult spermatozoa of many </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Platyhel-minthes.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (8)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Ovum,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—From the earliest times naturalists have of course been familiar with the form and function of the ova&nbsp;of a great number of animals ; the only seriously disputable question (excepting that of spontaneous generation)&nbsp;has been that of the like origin of the embryo in Mammals.&nbsp;The history of the discovery is a curious one. Galen had&nbsp;described the human ovaries as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">testes muliebres,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> but the&nbsp;term ovary is due to Steno (1664), who like our most&nbsp;modern investigators started in his comparisons from the&nbsp;corresponding organs in Sharks and Rays. In 1672 Regner&nbsp;de Graaf, in a remarkable work upon the structure of the&nbsp;ovary and its accessory organs, not only described in the&nbsp;ovary in Birds and Mammals the follicles which now bear&nbsp;his name, and which he regarded as the ova, but made the&nbsp;generalization of the universal occurrence of ova throughout the animal kingdom, and even observed the ovum in&nbsp;the oviduct of the Rabbit. His opinion, however, was&nbsp;overborne by the authority of his more famous countryman&nbsp;Leeuwenhoek, who regarded not the oviduct but the ovary,&nbsp;and more precisely the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">corpus luteum</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, as the seat of development of the embryo. The observation of De Graaf&nbsp;was repeated at the end of last century by Cruikshank, and&nbsp;again by Prévost and Dumas. The definite establishment&nbsp;of our present knowledge of the Mammalian ovum dates&nbsp;only from 1827, when Von Baer clearly traced the ovum&nbsp;from the uterus back to its earliest appearance in the oviduct, and thence to its origin within the Graafian follicle.&nbsp;Piirkinje had meanwhile (1825) described the “germinal&nbsp;vesicle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the Chick, Coste showed its occurrence in the&nbsp;Mammalian ovum, and Wagner discovered (1836) the&nbsp;“germinal spot” in Mammalian and other ova. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(9)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mass and Chemical Composition of the Ovum.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—The absence of any extensive measurements of the ovum in&nbsp;the various groups, either absolutely or in comparison&nbsp;with the bulk of the parent, renders it impossible to&nbsp;generalize with any great degree of definiteness. While&nbsp;from some comparisons it is at once apparent that the&nbsp;higher the organization the larger the ovum, many independently variable factors affect this, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the size, organization, or maturity of the parent, the duration of stay in&nbsp;the oviduct, and the climate and other surroundings.&nbsp;Examples of such variation are readily seen ; it is natural&nbsp;that self-supporting larval forms should start with smaller&nbsp;food-yolk than those which develop before leaving the&nbsp;egg, and among placental Mammals that the continuous&nbsp;supply of nutriment from the parental resources should.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
