One wonders that he could comment their works ſo well, and imitate them ſo little.</p><p>He quitted buſineſs himſelf ſome years before his death ; but his temperance and virtue contributed to protract his life to a great length in the full enjoyment of his underſtanding, and in the felicity of domeſtic friendſhip. He had had a paralytic ſtroke that affected his arm, yet never diſabled him from his cuſtomary walks and exerciſe. He had been in St James’s Park, and died ſuddenly at his houſe in Queen’s-ſquare on his return home, May 28. 1745, when he had paſſed the 80th year of his age. He left a ſon and four daughters, one of whom was married to his diſciple Mr Hud-ſon, and another to Mr Grigſon an attorney. The tafle and learning of the ſon, and the harmony in which he lived with his father, are viſible in the joint works they compoſed. The father in 1719 publiſhed two diſcourſes : 1. An Eſſay on the whole Art of Criticiſm as it relates to Painting ; 2. An Argument in behalf of the Science of a Connoiſſeur ; bound in one volume octavo. In 1722 came forth An Account of ſome of the ſtatues, bas-reliefs, drawings, and pictures, in Italy, &amp;c. with Remarks by Mr Richardfon, ſenior and junior. The ſon made the journey; and from his notes, letters, and obſervations, they both at his return compiled this valuable work. As the father was a formal man, with a flow, but loud and ſonorous voice, and, in truth, with ſome affectation in his manner ; and as there is much Angularity in his ſtyle and expreſſion, theſe peculiarities (for they were ſcarcely foibles) ſtruck ſuper-ſicial readers, and between the laughers and the envious the book was much ridiculed. Yet both this and the former are full of matter, good ſenſe, and inſtruction : and the very quaintneſs of ſome expreſſions, and their laboured novelty, ſhow the difficulty the author had to convey mere viſible ideas through the medium of language. Thoſe works remind one of Cibber’s inimitable treatiſe on the ſtage : when an author writes on his own profeſſion, feels it profoundly, and is ſenſible</p><p>his readers do not, he is not only excuſable, but meritorious, for illuminating the ſubject by new metaphors or bolder figures than ordinary. He is the coxcomb that ſneers, not he that inſtructs, in appropriated diction.</p><p>If theſe authors were cenſured when converſant within their own circle, it was not to be expected that they would be treated with milder indulgence when they ventured into a ſiſter region. In 1734, they publiſhed a very thick octavo, containing explanatory notes and remarks on Milton’s Paradiſe Loft, with the life of the author, and a diſcourſe on the poem. Again were the good ſenſe, the judicious criticiſms, and the ſentiments that broke forth in this work, forgotten in the Angularities that diſtinguiſh it. The father having laid in apology for being little converſant in claſſic literature, that he had looked into them through his ſon, Hogarth, whom a quibble could furniſh with wit, drew the father peeping through the nether end of a teleſcope, with which his ſon was perforated at a Virgil aloft on a ſhelf. Yet how forcibly Richardſon entered into the ſpirit of his author, appears from his com-prεhenflve expreſſion, that <hi rend="italic">Milton was an ancient, born</hi></p><lb/><p><hi rend="italic">two thouſand years after his time.</hi>  Richardſcn, however, was as incapable of reaching the ſublime or harmonious in poetry, as he was in painting, though ſo capable of illuſtrating both. Some ſpecimens of verſe that he has given us here and there in his works, excite no curioſi-ty for more, though he informs us in his Milton, that if painting was his wife, poetry had been his ſecret concubine. It is remarkable, that another commentator of Milton has made the ſame confeſſion,</p><p><hi rend="italic">-Sunt ⅛<hi rend="sup">5</hi> mihi carmina, me quoque dicunt</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">V</hi><hi rend="italic">atem paſtorei—--</hi></p><p>ſays Dr Bentley. Neither the doctor nor the painter add <hi rend="italic">fed non ego credulus illis,</hi>  though all their readers are ready to ſupply it for both. Beſides his pictures and commentaries, we have a few etchings by his hand, particularly two or three of Milton, and his own head. The ſale of his collection of drawings, in February 1747, laſted 18 days, and produced about 20601. his pictures about 7001. Hudſon his ſon-in-law bought many of the drawings.</p><p>RICHELET (Cæſar Peter), a French writer, born in 1631 at Chemin in Champagne. He was the friend of Patru and Ablancourt ; and like them applied him-ſelf to the ſtudy of the French language with ſucceſs. He compiled a dictionary of that language, full of new and uſeful remarks ; but exceptionable, as containing many ſatirical reflections and obſcenities. The belt edition is that of Lyons, 3 vols folio, 1728. He alſo collected a ſmall dictionary of rhymes, and compoſed ſome other pieces in the grammatical and critical way. He died in 1698.</p><p>RICHES, a word uſed always in the plural number, means wealth, money, poſſeſſion, or a ſplendid ſump-tuous appearance. When uſed to expreſs the fortune of private perſons, whether patrimonial or acquired, it lignifies <hi rend="italic">opulencea ;</hi>  term which expreſſes not the enjoyment, but the poſſeſſion, of numerous ſuperfluities.— The riches of a ſtate or kingdom expreſſes the produce of induſtry, of commerce, of different incorporated bodies, of the internal and external adminiſtration of the principal members of which the ſociety is compoſed, &amp;c.</p><p>Our Saviour ſays, that it is more eaſy ſor a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven ; and we find, in fact, that riches frequently bring along with them a degree of inattention, lukewarmneſs, and irréligion, ſuch as ſuffici-ently confirms the divine aſſertion ; which is merely a general truth, and which by no means aſſerts the abſo-lute impoſſibility of being virtuous and rich at the ſame time. For as the ancient philoſophers wiſely taught, riches, conſidered in themſelves, and abſtractedly from the bad purpoſes to which they may be applied, are not neceſſarily incompatible with virtue and wiſdom. They are indeed abſolutely indifferent ; in good hands they will be uſeful, and promote the cauſe of truth, virtue, and humanity; and in bad hands they are the ſource of much miſchief ; on the one band they confer the power of doing much good, and on the other they are equally powerful in doing ill.</p><p>To men, however, whoſe principles of virtue are not ſufficiently founded, riches are unqueſtionably a dangerous and ſeducing bait ; and as the ancients rightly taught, they are to the greateſt number of men, in an</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
