<p><span class="font1">RÉCAMIER, JEANNE FRANÇOISE JULIE ADÉLAÏDE (1777-1849), a famous Frenchwoman in the literary and political circles of the early 19th century, was born on the 4th of&nbsp;December 1777 at Lyons. Her maiden name was Bernard.&nbsp;She was married at fifteen to the banker Jacques Récamier&nbsp;(d. 1830), who was more than old enough to be her father.&nbsp;Beautiful, accomplished, with a real love for literature, she&nbsp;possessed at the same time a temperament which protected&nbsp;her from scandal, and from the early days of the consulate to&nbsp;almost the end of the July monarchy her salon in Paris was one&nbsp;of the chief resorts of literary and political society that pretended&nbsp;to fashion. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">habitués</span><span class="font1"> of her house included many former&nbsp;royalists, with others, such as Bemadotte and General Moreau,&nbsp;more or less disaffected to the government. This circumstance,&nbsp;together with her refusal to act as lady-in-waiting to the&nbsp;Empress Josephine and her friendship for Madame de Staël,&nbsp;brought her under suspicion. It was through Madame de Staël&nbsp;that Madame Récamier became acquainted with Benjamin&nbsp;Constant, whose singular political tergiversations during the&nbsp;last days of the empire and the first of the restoration have been&nbsp;attributed to her persuasions. Madame Récamier was eventu-ally exiled from Paris by Napoleon’s orders. After a short stay&nbsp;at Lyons she proceeded to Rome, and finally to Naples, where&nbsp;she was on exceedingly good terms with Murat and his wife, who&nbsp;were then intriguing with the Bourbons. She persuaded&nbsp;Constant to plead the claims of Murat in a memorandum addressed&nbsp;to the congress of Vienna, and also induced him to take up a&nbsp;decided attitude in opposition to Napoleon during the Hundred&nbsp;Days. Her husband had sustained heavy losses in 1805, and she&nbsp;visited Madame de Staël at Coppet in Switzerland. There was a&nbsp;project for her divorce, in order that she might marry Prince&nbsp;Augustus of Prussia, but though her husband was willing it was&nbsp;not arranged. In her later days she lost most of the rest of her&nbsp;fortune; but she continued to receive visitors at the Abbaye-aux-Bois, the old Paris convent to which she retired in 1814.&nbsp;Here Chateaubriand was a constant visitor, and in a manner&nbsp;master of the house; but even in old age, ill-health and reduced&nbsp;circumstances Madame Récamier never lost her attraction.&nbsp;She seems to have been incapable of any serious attachment,&nbsp;and although she numbered among her admirers Mathieu de Montmorency, Lucien Bonaparte, Prince Augustus of Prussia,&nbsp;Ballanche, J. J. Ampère and Constant, none of them obtained&nbsp;over her so great an influence as did Chateaubriand, though she&nbsp;suffered much from his imperious temper. If she had any&nbsp;genuine affection, it seems to have been for Prosper de Barante,&nbsp;whom she met at Coppet. She died in Paris on the 11th of&nbsp;May 1849.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are well-known portraits of her by Louis David in the galleries of the Louvre, and by François Gérard in the possession of&nbsp;the préfecture of the Seine.

<p><span class="font1">RECANATI, a city of the Marches, Italy, in the province of Macerata, 8 m. direct N.N.E. of the city of that name. Pop.&nbsp;(1901) 14,590 (town), 16,389 (commune). It has a station on&nbsp;the railway 17½ m. S. of Ancona, and distant 4½ m. from the town, which is built on a hill, 931 ft. above the sea, and retains&nbsp;portions of its 15th-century walls and gateways. It was the&nbsp;birthplace of the poet Leopardi (1798-1837), whose monument&nbsp;adorns the principal piazza and whose family has collected&nbsp;in the town a very interesting museum of Leopardiana; it also&nbsp;contains fine old mansions of the Leopardi, Mazzagalli, Massucci&nbsp;and Carradori in the main street, and a Gothic cathedral, built&nbsp;towards the close of the 14th century and dedicated to&nbsp;S Flavianus, patriarch of Constantinople. The churches of&nbsp;S Maria sopra Mercanti and San Domenico contain characteristic&nbsp;examples of the work of Lorenzo Lotto, as also does the new&nbsp;municipal palace, with a fine old battlemented tower, while the&nbsp;palace of Cardinal Venicr has a fine Renaissance loggia by&nbsp;Giuliano da Maiano, who was probably responsible for the&nbsp;designs for the portals of S Agostino and S Domenico. The&nbsp;older buildings of the town are noteworthy for the curious&nbsp;terra-cotta work which adorns the majority of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recanati appears as a strong castle in the 10th century or earlier. Round this gathered a community whose petty wars&nbsp;with Osimo </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Auximum)</span><span class="font1"> called for the interference of Innocent&nbsp;III. in 1198. From Frederick II. it obtained the right of having&nbsp;a port on the Adriatic; and by Gregory IX. it was made a city&nbsp;and the seat of the bishopric transferred from Osimo. This&nbsp;oscillation between Guelf and Ghibelline continued characteristic of Recanati. Urban IV. abolished the “ city ” and&nbsp;bishopric; Nicholas IV. restored them. John XXII. again, in&nbsp;1320, removed the bishopric and placed the city under interdict.&nbsp;The interdict was withdrawn in 1328 on payment of a heavy&nbsp;fine, but the bishopric remained in abeyance till 1357. Gregory&nbsp;XII., who on his deposition by the council of Constance was&nbsp;made papal legate of the sees of Macerata and Recanati, died in&nbsp;this city in 1417. The assistance rendered by Recanati to the&nbsp;popes in their struggles with the Sforza seems to have exhausted&nbsp;its resources, and it began to dcch'ne. Considerable damage&nbsp;was done by the earthquake of 1741; and the French, who were&nbsp;twice in possession of the city in 1797, pillaged it in 1799.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECEIPT (M.E. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">receite,</span><span class="font1"> derived through Fr. from Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recepta, </span><span class="font1">participle of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recipere,</span><span class="font1"> to receive), in law, an acknowledgment in&nbsp;writing that a sum of money or other valuable considered has&nbsp;been received by the person signing the acknowledgment in&nbsp;discharge of a debt or other obligation. Such a receipt is prima&nbsp;facie evidence only of payment, and it may be shown, for&nbsp;example, that it was signed by mistake, or obtained by fraud or&nbsp;misrepresentation. By the Stamp Act of 1891, which repealed&nbsp;and re-enacted other acts, a duty of 1d. is imposed on every&nbsp;receipt or form of writing discharging a debt of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">£2</span><span class="font1"> or upwards;&nbsp;the payment of the duty is denoted by affixing a penny stamp to&nbsp;the document, and the cancelling of the same by the person&nbsp;giving the receipt. By § 103 if a person gives a receipt, liable to&nbsp;duty, not duly stamped, or refuses to give a receipt, liable to&nbsp;duty, duly stamped or, on payment to the amount of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">£2</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;upward, gives a receipt for a less sum than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">£2</span><span class="font1"> or divides the&nbsp;amount paid with intent to evade the duty, he is liable to a fine&nbsp;of £10. A receipt not duly stamped may be stamped at the&nbsp;Inland Revenue Office within fourteen days on payment of a&nbsp;fine of £5 or within one month on payment of £10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECEIVER, in English law, an officer or manager appointed by a court to administer property for its protection, to receive&nbsp;rent or other income and to pay authorized outgoings. Receivers&nbsp;may be either appointed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pendente lite</span><span class="font1"> or by way of equitable&nbsp;execution, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> for the purpose of enabling a judgment creditor&nbsp;to obtain payment of his debt, when the position of the real&nbsp;estate is such that ordinary execution will not reach it. Formerly&nbsp;receivers were appointed only by the court of chancery, but by&nbsp;the Judicature Act 1873 it is now within the power of all</span></p>
