<p><span class="font2">animals among flocks and herds. A sentiment of veneration or superstition has from remote ages and among many races&nbsp;attached to it. The raven is associated with various characters&nbsp;of history, sacred or profane—Noah and Elijah, Odin and&nbsp;Flokki, the last of whom by its means discovered Iceland.&nbsp;It is said to have played its part in the mythology of the Red&nbsp;Indian; and it has often figured in prose and verse, from the&nbsp;time of Shakespeare to that of Poe and Dickens. Superstition&nbsp;has been generally succeeded by persecution, which in many&nbsp;districts has produced extirpation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The raven breeds very early in the year, in England resorting to its nest, which is usually an ancient if not an ancestral&nbsp;structure, about the middle or towards the end of January.&nbsp;Therein are laid from five to seven eggs of the common Corvine&nbsp;coloration (see Crow), and the young are hatched before the&nbsp;end of February. In more northern countries the breeding&nbsp;season is naturally delayed, but everywhere this species is&nbsp;almost, if not quite, the earliest breeder. The raven measures&nbsp;about 26 in. in length, and has an expanse of wing considerably exceeding a yard. Its bill and feet are black, and the same&nbsp;may be said of its whole plumage, but the feathers of the upper&nbsp;parts as well as of the breast are glossy, reflecting a bright&nbsp;purple or steel-blue. The species </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Corvus corax</span><span class="font2">) inhabits the&nbsp;whole of Europe, and the northern if not the central parts&nbsp;of Asia; but in the latter continent its southern range is not&nbsp;well determined. In America it is, or used to be, found from&nbsp;the shores of the Polar Sea to Guatemala if not to Honduras,&nbsp;but is said hardly to be found of late years in the eastern part of&nbsp;the United States. In Africa its place is taken by three allied&nbsp;but well-differentiated species, two of which </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Corvus umbrinus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">readily distinguished by its brown neck, and C. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">affinis</span><span class="font2">, having&nbsp;its superior nasal bristles upturned vertically) also occur in&nbsp;south-western Asia, while the third (C. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">leptouyx</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C. tingitanus, </span><span class="font2">a smaller species characterized by several slight differences)&nbsp;inhabits Barbary and the Atlantic Islands. Farther to the&nbsp;southward in the Ethiopian region three more species appear&nbsp;whose plumage is varied with white—C. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">scapulatus, C. albicollis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C. crassirostris</span><span class="font2">—the first two of small size, but the last&nbsp;rivalling the real raven in that respect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A.

<p><span class="font2">RAVEN-HILL, LEONARD (1867- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), English artist and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">illustrator, was born on the 10th of March 1867. He was educated at Bristol grammar school and the Devon county&nbsp;school, and studied art at Lambeth and then in Paris under&nbsp;MM. Bougereau and Aimé Morot. He began to exhibit at the&nbsp;Salon in 1887, and in the Royal Academy in 1889. In 1893 he&nbsp;founded, with Arnold Golsworthy, the humorous and artistic&nbsp;monthly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Butterfly</span><span class="font2"> (1893-94, revived in 1899-1900). He&nbsp;contributed to many illustrated magazines, and began to work&nbsp;for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Punch,</span><span class="font2"> with which he was afterwards prominently associated, in 1896. He illustrated Sir Walter Besant’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">East London&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1901) and J. H. Harris’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cornish Saints and Sinners;</span><span class="font2"> he&nbsp;published the impressions of his visit to India on the occasion&nbsp;of the tour of the prince and princess of Wales as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">An Indian&nbsp;Sketch-Book</span><span class="font2"> (1903); and his other published sketch-books&nbsp;include </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Our Battalion</span><span class="font2"> (1902) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Promenaders</span><span class="font2"> (1894).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAVENNA, a city and archiepiscopal see of Emilia, Italy, capital of the province of Ravenna, standing in a marshy plain&nbsp;13 ft. above sea-level, 6 m. from the sea and 45 m. by rail east&nbsp;of Bologna. Pop. (1906) 35,543 (town), 67,379 (commune)—a&nbsp;considerable increase, as the population of 1881 was only 34,270&nbsp;(commune). The industries are few, the growing of wine,&nbsp;breeding of silkworms, making of agricultural instruments,&nbsp;printing and the manufacture of laces being the chief. The&nbsp;town is connected with the sea by the Corsi ni Canal, the two&nbsp;small rivers Ronco and Montone no longer serving as means&nbsp;of communication. Ravenna has railway communication with&nbsp;Bologna (via Castel Bolognese), Ferrara and Rimini, and by&nbsp;steam tram with Forli. At the mouth of the canal is a small&nbsp;harbour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">No other city in the world offers so many and such striking examples of the ecclesiastical architecture of the centuries from&nbsp;the 5th to the 8th. The style is commonly called Byzantine;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">but some of the most striking features of the churches of Ravenna—the colonnades, the mosaics, perhaps the cupolas—&nbsp;are not so much Byzantine as representative of early Christian&nbsp;art generally. The following are the most important churches&nbsp;of Ravenna, arranged in the order of the dates generally attri-buted to them:—</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Almost the only sacred building previous to the 5th century of which we have any record is unfortunately lost. The&nbsp;cathedral of Ravenna, built by S. Ursus in 370-390, which had&nbsp;a nave and four aisles, was destroyed in 1734-44, only the&nbsp;(inaccessible) crypt and the round campanile remaining from&nbsp;the earlier structure; there are fragments of reliefs from&nbsp;a pulpit erected by Archbishop Agnellus (556-569) in the&nbsp;interior. A rare work on the earlier church (Buonamici, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La&nbsp;Metropolitana di Ravenna)</span><span class="font2"> gives details of its construction.&nbsp;The present cathedral contains several early Christian marble&nbsp;sarcophagi, a silver cross of the 6th century (that of Agnellus),&nbsp;and the so-called throne of the Archbishop Maximian (546-552), adorned with reliefs in ivory, which, however, was really&nbsp;brought to Ravenna in 1001 by John the Deacon, who recorded&nbsp;the fact in his Venetian chronicle, as a present from the Doge&nbsp;Pietro Orseolo to the Emperor Otho III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The period from the transference of the imperial residence to Ravenna to the death of Valentinian III. (404-455) was&nbsp;the first period of great building activity in Ravenna, when the&nbsp;archiepiscopal see of Ravenna attained great importance. It&nbsp;was to it that we owe the erection of the Basilica Petriana&nbsp;at Classe (396-425), which has entirely disappeared, of the&nbsp;churches of S. Giovanni Evangelista (425), of S. Agata (425-432), of the chapel of S. Pier Crisologo (433-449), of the tomb&nbsp;of Galla Placidia (440), the church of S. Pier Maggiore (now&nbsp;S. Francesco) (433-458), the baptistery of Neon (449-458),&nbsp;S. Giovanni Battista and S. Croce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rivoira, in the book cited below, shows that many of the characteristic architectural details can be traced back to a&nbsp;classical and in particular a Roman origin, and were not derived&nbsp;from the East, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> the use of blind arches as an external&nbsp;decoration, and of brick cornices with the points of the bricks&nbsp;projecting like the teeth of a saw, the use of pulvini (cushions)&nbsp;above the capitals of columns and under the spring of an arch,&nbsp;&amp;c. &amp;c., the use of round arches springing direct from these&nbsp;cushions, spherical pendentives, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of this group of churches, S. Giovanni Evangelista, erected by Galla Placidia in fulfilment of a vow made on her voyage&nbsp;from Constantinople, has been entirely rebuilt, though the&nbsp;columns are ancient (the Corinthian capitals are probably&nbsp;from a classical building), and the crypt may be original. The&nbsp;Gothic portal is fine, and the church contains a mosaic pavement of 1213 with curious representations and some frescoes&nbsp;by Giotto, painted during a visit to Dante between 1317 and&nbsp;1320. S. Agata was almost entirely rebuilt in 1476-94. The</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
