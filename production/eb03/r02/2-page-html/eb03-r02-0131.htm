<p><span class="font1">the vanquiſhed were to march, Theſe captains and generals he made priſoners of war, being reſerved to adorn his triumph. As ſor the plunder of the enemy’s camp,&nbsp;that he gave entirely up to hi$ own ſoldiers, without&nbsp;reſerving any part for himſelf, or permitting thoſe of&nbsp;the delivered army to have a ſhare. Thus, having re-ſe ued a Roman army from inevitable deſtruction, having&nbsp;defeated a powerful enemy, having taken and fortified&nbsp;their city, and, ſtill more, having refuſed any part oſ&nbsp;the ſpoil, he reſigned his dictatorſhip, after having enjoyed it but % days. The ſenate would have enriched&nbsp;him ; but he declined their proffers, chooſing to retire&nbsp;oκce more to his farm and his cottage, content with&nbsp;temperance and ſame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But this repoſe from foreign invaſion did not leſſen the tumults of the city within. The clamours ſor the&nbsp;Agrarian law ſtill continued, and ſtill more fiercely,&nbsp;when Sicinius Dentatus, a plebeian, advanced in years,&nbsp;but of an admirable perſon and military deportment,&nbsp;came forward, to enumerate his hardſhips and his merits. This old ſoldier made no ſcruple of extolling the&nbsp;various merits of his youth ; but indeed his atchieve-ments ſupported oſtentation. He had ſerved his country in the wars 40 years; he had been an officer 30,&nbsp;firſt a centurion, and then a tribune : he had ſought&nbsp;120 battles, in which, by the force of his ſingle arm,&nbsp;he had ſaved a multitude of lives : he had gained 14 civic, three mural, and eight golden crowns, btſides 83&nbsp;chains, 60 bracelets, 18 gilt ſpears, and 23 horſe-trap-pings, whereof nine were for killing the enemy in ſingle&nbsp;combat : moreover, he had received 47 wounds, all before, and none behind. Theſe were his honours : yet,&nbsp;notwithſtanding all this, he had never received any&nbsp;ſhare of thoſe lands which were won from the enemy,&nbsp;but continued to drag on a life of poverty and contempt ; while others were poſſeſſed of thoſe very territories which his valour had won, without any merit to&nbsp;deſerve them, or ever having contributed to the conqueſt. A eaſe of ſo much hardſhip had a ſtrong effect&nbsp;upon the multitude ; they uuanimouſly demanded that&nbsp;the law might be paſſed, and that ſuch merit ſhould not&nbsp;go unrewarded. It was in vain that ſome of the ſenators roſe up to ſpeak againſt it ; their voices were&nbsp;drowned by the cries of the people. When rea</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">on,&nbsp;therefore, could no longer be heard, paſſion, as uſual,&nbsp;ſucceeded ; and the young patricians, running furiouſly&nbsp;into the throng, broke the balloting runs, and diſperſed the multitude that offered to oppoſe them. For&nbsp;this they were ſome time after fined by the tribunes ;&nbsp;but their reſolution, nevertheleſs, for the preſent, put&nbsp;off the Agrarian law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The commonwealth of Rome had now for near 60 years been fluctuating between the contending orders&nbsp;that compoſed it, till at length, each ſide, as if weary,&nbsp;were willing to reſpire a while from the mutual exertions of their claims. The citizens, now, therefore,&nbsp;ef every rank, began to complain of the arbitrary de-eiſions of their magiſtrates, and wiſhed to be guided&nbsp;by a written body of laws, which being known might&nbsp;prevent wrongs as well as puniſh them. In this both&nbsp;the ſenate and the people concurred’, as hoping that&nbsp;ſuch laws would put an end to the commotions that fo&nbsp;long had haraſſed the ſtate. It was thereupon agreed,,&nbsp;that ambaſſadors ſhould be ſent to the Greek cities in&nbsp;Italy, and to Athens, to bring home ſuch laws ſrom</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">thence a3 by experience had </span><span class="font1">been found moſt equî-table and uſeful. For thia purpoſe, three ſenators, Poſthumius, Sulpicius, and Manlius, were fixed upon,&nbsp;and galleys aſſigned to convoy them, agreeable to the&nbsp;majeſty of the Roman people. While they were upon&nbsp;this commiſſion abroad, a dreadful plague depopulated&nbsp;the city at home, and ſupplied the interval of their abſence with other anxiety than that of wiſhe-s </span><span class="font0">for </span><span class="font1">their&nbsp;return. In about a year the plague ceaſed, and the&nbsp;ambaſſadors returned, bringing home a body of law&gt;.,&nbsp;collected ſrom the moſt civilized ſtates of Greece and&nbsp;Italy, which being afterwards formed into tçn tables,&nbsp;and two more being added, made that celebrated code&nbsp;called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Laws of the Twelve Tables,</span><span class="font1"> many fragments&nbsp;of which remain to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ambaſſadors were no </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ooner returned, than the tribunes required that a body of men ſhould be choſen to digeſt their new laws into proper form, and to&nbsp;give weight to the execution of them. After long debates whether this choice ſhould not be partly made&nbsp;fiom the people as well as the patricians, it was at laſt&nbsp;agreed that 10 of the principal ſenators ſhould be elected, whoſe power, continuing for a year, ſhould be&nbsp;equal to that of kings and conſiſts, and that without&nbsp;any appeal. The peιfons choſen were Appius and&nbsp;Genutiu3, who had been elected conſuls for the en-ſuing year ; Poſthumius, Sulpicius, and M¾nlius, the&nbsp;three ambaſſadors ; Sextus and Romulus, former conſuls ; with Julius Veturius, and Horatius, ſenators of the&nbsp;firſt con</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The decemviri beingnow inveſted with abſolute powgι&gt; agreed to take the reins of government by turns, and&nbsp;that each ſhould diſpenſe juſtice for a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theſe magiſtrates, ſor the firſt year, wrought with extreme application : and their work being finiſhed, it&nbsp;was expected that they would be contented to give&nbsp;up their offices ; but having known the charms of&nbsp;power, they were now unwilling to reſign it : they&nbsp;therefore pretended that ſome laws were yet wanting&nbsp;to complete their deſign, and intreated the ſenate for&nbsp;a continuance of their offices ; to which that body aſ-ſented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But they ſoon threw off the maſk of moderation ; and, regardleſs either ol the approbation of the ſenate&nbsp;or the people, reſolved to continue themſelves, againſt&nbsp;all order, in the decern virat∣e. A conduct ſo notorious&nbsp;produced di</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">contents ; and theſe were as ſure to produce freſh acts of tyranny. The city wa3 become al*&nbsp;moſt a deſert, with reſpect to all who had any thing to·&nbsp;loſe ; and the decemvirs rapacity was then only diſcon-tinued, when they wanted freſh objects to ex-ereiſe it&nbsp;upon. In this ſtate of ſlavery, proſcription, and mutual diſtruſt, not one citizen was found to ſtrike for&nbsp;his country’s freedom ; theſe tyrants continued to rule&nbsp;without controul, being conſtantly guarded, not with-their lictors alone, but a numerous crowd of dependents, clients, and even patricians, whom their vices had&nbsp;confederated: round them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this gloomy ſituation of the ſtate, the Æqui and Volſei, thoſe conſtant enemies of the Romans, undertook their incurſions, reſolved to profit by the inteſtine&nbsp;diviſions of the people, and advanced within about io&nbsp;miles of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But the decemviri, being put in poſſeſſion of all the. military as weſt as of the civil power, divided their ar-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
