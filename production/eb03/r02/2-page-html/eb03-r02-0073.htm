<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Of ſtraighting or changing the courſe of rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">We have ſeen, that every bending of a river requires an additional ſlope in order to continue its train, or enable it to convey the ſame quantity of water without&nbsp;ſwelling in its bed. Therefore the effect of taking&nbsp;away any </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">theſe bends muſt be to link the waters of&nbsp;the river. It is proper, therefore, to have it in our&nbsp;power to eſtimate theſe effects. It may be deſirable to&nbsp;gain property, by taking away the ſweeps of a very&nbsp;winding ſtream. But this may be prejudicial, by deſtroying the navigation on ſuch a river. It may alſo&nbsp;hurt the proprietors below, by increaſing the velocity&nbsp;of the ſtream, which will expoſe them to the riſlc of its&nbsp;overflowing, or of its deſtroying its bed, and taking a&nbsp;new courſe. Or this increaſe of velocity may be inconſiſtent with the regimen of the new channel, or at leaſt&nbsp;require larger dimenſions than we ſhould have given it&nbsp;if ignorant of this effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our principles of uniform motion enable us to answer every queſtion of this kind which can occur ; and Mr de Buat propυfes ſeveral problems to this effect. The&nbsp;regular ſolutions of them are complicated and difficult;&nbsp;and we do not think them neceſſary in this place, becauſe they may all be ſolved in a manner not indeed&nbsp;ſo elegant, becauſe indirect, but abundantly accurate,&nbsp;and eaſy to any perſon familiar with thoſe which we&nbsp;have already conſidered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We can take the exact level acroſs all theſe ſweeps, and thus obtain the whole ſlope. We can meaſure&nbsp;with accuracy the velocity in ſome part of the channel&nbsp;which is moſt remote from any bend, and where the&nbsp;channel itſelf has the greateſt regularity of form. This&nbsp;will give us the expence or diſcharge of the river, and&nbsp;the mean depth connected with it. We can then examine whether this velocity is preciſely ſuch as is compatible with ſtability in the ſtraight courſe. If it is, it&nbsp;is evident that if we cut off the bends, the greater ſlope&nbsp;which this will produce will communicate to the waters a velocity incompatible with the regimen ſuited to&nbsp;this ſoil, unleſs we enlarge the width of the ſtream, thai&gt;&nbsp;is? unleſs we make the new channel more capacious than&nbsp;the old one. We muſt now calculate the dimenſions of the&nbsp;channel which, with this increaſed ſlope, will conduct the&nbsp;waters with the velocity that is neceſſary.. All this∙may&nbsp;be done by the foregoing problems ; and we may eaſieſt.&nbsp;accompliſh this by ſteps, Firſt, ſuppoſe the bed the.&nbsp;ſame with the old one, and calculate the velocity for&nbsp;the increaſed ſlope by the general formula.. Then-change one of the dimenſions of the channel, ſo as to&nbsp;produce the velocity we want, which is a very ſimple&nbsp;proceſs. And in doing this, the object: to be kept,&nbsp;chiefly in view is not to make the new velocity ſuch&nbsp;as will be incompatible with the ſtability of tire new,&nbsp;bed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having accompliſhed this firſt purpoſe, we learn (in. the very ſolution) how much ſhallower this channel&nbsp;with its greater ſlope will be than the former, while it diſcharges all the waters. This diminution of depth muſt&nbsp;increaſe the ſlope and the velocity, and.muſt diminiſh&nbsp;the depth of the river, above the place where the alteration is to be made. How far it produces theſe effects&nbsp;may be calculated by the general formula. We then&nbsp;fee whether the navigation will be hurt, either in </span><span class="font1">the&nbsp;aid river </span><span class="font0">up the ſtream, or in the new channel. It is</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">plain that all theſe points -cannot be reconciled. We may make the new channel ſuch, that it lhall leave a&nbsp;velocity compatible with ſtability, and that it ſhall not&nbsp;diminiſh the depth of the river up the ſtream. But,&nbsp;having a greater ſlope, it muſt have a ſmaller mean&nbsp;depth, and alſo a ſmaller real depth, unleſs </span><span class="font1">we </span><span class="font0">make it&nbsp;of a very inconvenient form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſame things viewed in a different light, will ſhow us what depreſſion of waters may be produced by rectifying the courſe of a river in order to prevent its overflowing. And the proceſs which we would recommend is the ſame with the foregoing. We apprehend&nbsp;it to be quite needleſs to meaſure the angles of rebound,&nbsp;in order to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">compute</span><span class="font0"> the ſlope which is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">employed</span><span class="font0"> for ſend-ing the river through the bend, with a view to ſuper-ſede this by ſtraighting the river. It is infinitely eaſier&nbsp;and more exact to meaſure the levels themſelves, and'&nbsp;then we know the effect of removing them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nor need we follow Mr de Buat in ſolving problems' for diminiſhing the ſlope and velocity, and deepening&nbsp;the channel of a river by bending its courſe. The expence of this would be in every caſe enormous; and the&nbsp;practices which we are juſt going to enter upon afford*&nbsp;infinitely eaſier methods of accompliſhing all the purpoſes which are to be gained by theſe changes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Of Bars, Weirs, and fetteys, for raiſing the Surface of Rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">We propoſe, under the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">IPΛTER-Works,,</span><span class="font0"> to conſider in ſufficient practical detail all that relates to&nbsp;the conſtruction and mechaniſm of theſe and other erections in water ; and we confine ourſelves, in,this place,&nbsp;to the mere effect which they will produce on the current of the river..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We gave the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">weir</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bar</span><span class="font0"> to - a dam erected acroſs a river for the purpoſe of raiſing its waters, whether in order to take off a draft for a mill or to deepen&nbsp;the channel. Before we can tell the effect which they&nbsp;will produce,,we muſt have a general· rule for aſcertain-ing the relation between the height of the water above&nbsp;the lip of the weir or har, and the quantity of water&nbsp;which will flow. over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Firſt, then, with reſpect to a weir,<sub>f</sub> repreſented </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">fig, 18. and fig. 18. n<sup>o</sup> 2.. The latter figure more re-ſembles their uſual, form, conſiſting of a dam of ſolid.&nbsp;maſonry, or built of timber, properly fortified with&nbsp;ſhoars and banks. On . the top is ſet up a ſtrong plank&nbsp;FR, called the waſteboard, or waſter, over which the&nbsp;water flows.. This is brought </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">an accurate level, of&nbsp;the proper height. Such voiders are frequently made&nbsp;in the ſide of a mill-caurſe, for letting the ſuperfluous&nbsp;water run off. This is properly the waster, voider. : it is alſo called an opfset. The ſame obſervations will explain all theſe different pieces of practice.&nbsp;The following queſtions occur in courſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prob. I. Given the length of an offset or waſteboard, made in the face of a reſervoir of ſtagnant water, and the depth of its lip under the horizontal ſurface of the water, to determine the diſcharge, or the quantity of water which will run over in a ſecond ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let AB be the horizontal ſurface of the ſtill water*, and F the lip of the waſteboard.
