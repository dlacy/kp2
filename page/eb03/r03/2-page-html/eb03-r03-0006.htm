<p><span class="font0">But although this roof may be made abundantly ſtrong, it is not quite ſo ſtrong as the plain roof AGD&nbsp;of the ſame ſcantling. The compreffion which BC&nbsp;muſt ſuſtain in order to give the ſame ſupport to the&nbsp;rafters at B and C that was given by braces properly&nbsp;placed, is conſiderably greater than the compreſſion&nbsp;of the braces. And this ſtrain is an addition to the&nbsp;tranſverſe ſtrain which BC gets from its own load.&nbsp;Alſo this form neceſſarily expoſes the tie-beam to croſs&nbsp;ftrains. If BE is mortiſed into the tie-beam, then the&nbsp;ſtrain which tends to depreſs the angle ABC preſſes&nbsp;on the tie-beam at E tranſverſely, while a contrary&nbsp;ſtrain acts on F, pulling it upwards. Theſe ftrains&nbsp;however are ſmall ; and this conſtruction is frequently&nbsp;uſed, being ſuſceptible of ſufficient ſtrength, without&nbsp;much increaſe of the dimenſibns of the timbers ; and&nbsp;it has the great advantage of giving free room in the&nbsp;garrets. Were it not for this, there is a much more perfect form repreſented in fig. 19. Here the two poſts&nbsp;BE, CF are united below. All tranſverſe action on&nbsp;the tie-beam is now entirely removed. We are almoſt&nbsp;diſpoſed to ſay that this is the ſtrongeſt roof of the&nbsp;ſame width and ilope : for if the iron ſtrap which&nbsp;connects the pieces BE, CF with the tie-beam have&nbsp;a large bolt G through it, confining it to one point of&nbsp;the beam, there are five points A, B, C, D, G, which&nbsp;cannot change their places, and there is no tranſverſe&nbsp;ſtrain in any of the connections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the dimenſions of the building are very great, ſo that the pieces AB, BC, CD, would be thought&nbsp;too weak for withſtanding the croſs ftrains, braces may&nbsp;be added as is expreſſed in fig. 18. by the dotted lines.&nbsp;The reader will obſerve that it is not meant to leave&nbsp;the top flat externally : it muſt be raiſed a little in the&nbsp;middle to ſhoot off the rain. But this muſt not be&nbsp;done by incurvating the beam BC. This would ſoon&nbsp;be cruſhed, and ſpring upwards. The ſlopes muſt be&nbsp;given by pieces of timber added above the ſtrutting&nbsp;beam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And thus we have completed a frame of a roof. It conſiſts of theſe principal members : The rafters, which&nbsp;are immediately loaded with the covering; the tie-beam,&nbsp;which withſtands the horizontal thruſt by wſhich the&nbsp;roof tends to fly out below and puſh out the walls ;&nbsp;the king-pofts, which hang from fixed points and ferve&nbsp;to uphold the tie-beam, and alſo to afford other fixed&nbsp;points on wſhich we may reft the braces which ſupport&nbsp;the middle of the rafters ; and laſtly the truſs or ſtrut-ting-beam, which ſerves to give mutual abutment to&nbsp;the different parts which are at a diſtance from each&nbsp;either. The rafters, braces, and truſſes are expoſed to&nbsp;compreffion, and muſt therefore have not only coheſion&nbsp;but ſtiſſneſs. For if they bend, the prodigious compreſſions to which they are ſubjected would quickly&nbsp;cruſh them in this bended ſtate. The tie-beams and&nbsp;king-pofts, if performing no other office but ſupport-ing the roof, do not require ſtiſſneſs, and their places&nbsp;might be ſupplied by ropes, or by rods of iron of&nbsp;one-tenth part of the lection that even the ſmalleſt&nbsp;oak ſtretcher requires. Theſe members require no&nbsp;greater dimenſions than what is neceſſary for giving&nbsp;ſufficient joints, and any more is a needleſs expence and&nbsp;k&gt;ad. All roofs, however complicated, conſiſt of theſe&nbsp;eſſential parts, and if pieces of timber are to be ſeea&nbsp;which perform none of theſe offices, they muſt be pro·&nbsp;nounced uſeleſs, and they are frequently hurtful, by&nbsp;producing croſs ftrains in i’ome other piece. In a rool&nbsp;properly conſtructed there ſhould be no ſuch ſtrains.&nbsp;All the timbers, except thoſe which immediately carry&nbsp;the covering, ſhould be either puſhed or drawn in the&nbsp;direction of their length. And this is the rule by&nbsp;which a roof ſhould alw<sup>r</sup>ays be examined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe eſſential parts are ſuſceptible of numberleſs combinations and varieties. But it is a prudent maxim to make the conſtruction as ſimple, and conſiſtſhg of as few&nbsp;parts, as poſſible. We areleſs expoſed to the imperfections of workmanſhip, ſuch as looſe joints, &amp;c. Another&nbsp;eſſential harm ariſes from many pieces, by the compreſſion and the ſhrinking of the timber in the croſs direction of the libres. The effect of this is equivalent&nbsp;to the ſhortening of the piece which butts on the joint.&nbsp;This alters the proportions of the lides of the triangle&nbsp;on which the lhape of the whole depends. Now in a&nbsp;roof ſuch as fig. 18. there is twice as much of this as&nbsp;in the plain pent roof, becauſe there are tw<sup>τ</sup>o poſts.&nbsp;And when the direction of the butting pieces is very&nbsp;oblique to the action of the load, a ſmall ſhrinking permits a great change of ſhape. Thus in a roof of what&nbsp;is called pediment pitch, where the rafters make an&nbsp;angle of 30 degrees with the horizon, half an inch&nbsp;compreſſion of the king-poſt will produce a fagging of&nbsp;an inch, and occaſion a great ſtrain on the tie-beam if&nbsp;the poſts are mortiſed into it. In fig. 2. of the roofs&nbsp;in the article Architecture, half an inch ſhrinking&nbsp;of each of the two poſts will allow the middle to ſagg&nbsp;above five inches. Fig. ι. of the ſame plate is faulty&nbsp;in this reſpect, by cutting the ſtrutting-beam in the&nbsp;middle. <sup>r</sup>Γhe ſtrutting-beam is thus ſhortened by three&nbsp;ſhrinkings, while there is but one to ſhorten the rafters.&nbsp;The conſequence is, that the truſs which is included&nbsp;within the rafters will ſagg away from them, and then&nbsp;they muſt bend in the middle till they again reft on this&nbsp;included truſs. This roof is, however, conſtructed on&nbsp;the whole on good principles, and we adduce it only tα&nbsp;ſhow the advantages of ſimplicity. This cutting of&nbsp;the truſſing-beam is unavoidable, if we would preſerve the&nbsp;king-poſt. But we are in doubt whether the ſervice&nbsp;performed by it in this caſe will balance the inconvenience. It is employed only to ſupport the middle of&nbsp;the upper half of each rafter, which it does but imperfectly, becauſe the braces and ſtrut muſt be cut hall&nbsp;through at their croſſing : if theſe joints are made tight,&nbsp;as a workman would wiſh to do, the ſettling of the roof&nbsp;will cauſe them to work on each other croſſwiſe with&nbsp;inſuperable force, and will undoubtedly ſtrain them exceedingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This method of including a truſs within the rafters of a pent roof is a very conſiderable addition to the ai t&nbsp;of carpentry. But to inſure its full effect, it ſhould always be executed in the manner repreſented in fig. 1.&nbsp;Plate XLVIII. with butting rafters under the principal ones, butting on joggles in the heads of the poſts.&nbsp;Without this the ſtrut-Seam is hardly of any ſervice.&nbsp;We would therefore recommend fig. 20. as a proper&nbsp;conſtruction of a truſſed roof, and the king-poſt which&nbsp;is placed in it may be employed to ſupport the upper&nbsp;part of the rafters, and alſo for preventing the ſtrut-beam from bending in either-direction in conſequence&nbsp;of its great compreſſion. It will alſo give a ſuſpenlion&nbsp;for the great burdens which are ſometimes neceſſary in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
