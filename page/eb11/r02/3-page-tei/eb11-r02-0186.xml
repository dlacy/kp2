Attempts have been made to trace such performances to an early origin. In their modern form, however, they date from the reign of Louis Philippe. <hi rend="italic">UAn </hi><hi rend="italic">1841 elVan 1941,</hi>  by the brothers Cogniard, was one of the earliest.</p><p>REVILLAGIGEDO, an isolated, uninhabited group of rocky islands in the N. Pacific, lat. <hi rend="smallcaps">t8°</hi>  N., long. 112° W., belonging to Mexico, and forming part of the state of Colima. They are about 420 m. from the Mexican coast and comprise the large island of Socorro (San Tomâs), 24 m. long by an average of 9 m. wide, and the three widely separated islets of San Benedicto, Roca Partida and Clarion, with a total area of 320 sq. m. The island of Socorro has an extinct volcano 3660 ft. high. The islands have certain remarkable zoological features, comprising several birds and reptiles allied to those of the Mexican mainland but differing from them in species. The archipelago derives its name from the Spanish viceroy who governed Mexico from 1746 to 1755.</p><p>RÉVILLE, ALBERT (18267    ), French Protestant theo</p><p>logian, was born at Dieppe on the 4th of November 1826. After studying at Geneva and Strassburg, he became in 1849 pastor at Lunerai near Dieppe, and in 1851 of the Walloon Church at Rotterdam, where he remained until 1872. In 1880 he was made professor of the history of religions in the College de France at Paris. Six years later he was appointed president of the section of religious studies in the École des hautes études at the Sorbonne. He is one of the leaders of the French school of advanced critical theology.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Works.—</hi>Besides contributing to the <hi rend="italic">Revue de théologie</hi>  (Paris), the <hi rend="italic">Revue de l’histoire des religions</hi>  (Paris), the <hi rend="italic">Revue des deux mondes,</hi>  the following works are important: <hi rend="italic">Manuel Phistoire comparée de la philosophie et de la religion</hi>  (1859; Eng. trans., 1864); <hi rend="italic">Histoire au dogme de la divinité de Jésus Christ</hi>  (1869, 3rd ed., 1904; Eng. trans., I905); <hi rend="italic">Prolegombnes de l’histoire aes religions</hi>  (1881, 4th ed., 1886; Eng. trans., 1884); <hi rend="italic">Théodore Parker, sa vie et ses œuvres</hi>  (1865;’ Eng. trans., 1865, 2nd ed., 1877); <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Origin and Growth of Religion as illustrated by the native religions of Mexico and Peru</hi>  (the “ Hibbert Lectures " for 1884); <hi rend="italic">Jésus de Nazareth</hi>  (1897, 12th ed., 1906).</p><p>His son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean Reville,</hi>  was born on the 6th of November 1854, studied at Geneva, Paris, Berlin and Heidelberg, and became professor of patristic literature and secretary of the section of religious studies in the École des hautes etudes at the Sorbonne.

The news of the failure of the French arms in Belgium gave rise in Paris to popular movements on the 9th and ioth of March 1793, and on the ioth of March, on the proposal of Danton, the Convention decreed that there should be established in Paris an extraordinary criminal tribunal, which received the official name of the Revolutionary Tribunal by a decree of the 29th of October 1793. It was composed of a jury, a public prosecutor, and two substitutes, all nominated by the Convention; and from its judgments there was no appeal. With M. J. A. Hermann as president and Fouquier-Tinville as public prosecutor, the tribunal terrorized the royalists, the refractory priests and all the actors in the counter-revolution. Soon, too, it came to be used for personal ends, particularly by Robespierre, who employed it for the condemnation of his adversaries. The excesses of the Revolutionary Tribunal increased with the growth of Robespierre’s ascendancy in the Committee of Public Safety; and on the ioth of June 1794 was promulgated, at his instigation, the infamous Law of 22 Prairial, which forbade prisoners to employ counsel for their defence, suppressed the hearing of witnesses and made death the sole penalty. Before 22 Prairial the Revolutionary Tribunal had pronounced 1220 death-sentences in thirteen months; during the forty-nine days between the passing of the law and the fall of Robespierre 1376 persons were condemned, including many innocent victims. The lists of prisoners to be sent before the tribunal were prepared by a popular commission sitting at the museum, and signed, after revision, by" the Committee of General Security and the Committee of Puhlic Safety jointly. Although Robespierre was the principal purveyor of the tribunal, we possess only one of these lists bearing his signature. The Revolutionary Tribunal was suppressed on the 31st of May 1795. Among its most celebrated victims may be mentioned Marie Antoinette, the Hebertists, the Dantonists and several of the Girondists. Similar tribunals were also in operation in the provinces.</p><p>See H. A. Wallon, <hi rend="italic">Histoire du tribunal révolutionnaire de Paris </hi>(Paris, 6 vols., 1880-82); E.

It is the only large state in Bagelkhand, and the second largest in Central India, having an area of about 13,000 sq. m. It is bounded N. by the United Provinces, E. by Bengal and S. by the Central Provinces. On the W. it meets other petty states of Bagclkhand. Rewa is divided into two well-defined portions. The northern and smaller division is the plateau lying between the Kaimur range of hills and that portion of the Vindhyas known as Binjh, which overlook the valley of the Ganges. This plateau is for the most part cultivated and well peopled; rich harvests both of <hi rend="italic">kharif</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">rabi </hi>crops are generally obtained. Water is plentiful, and the country is full of large tanks and reservoirs, which, however, are not used for irrigation purposes; the only system of wet cultivation which has any favour with the villagers is that of <hi rend="italic">bunds,</hi>  or mounds of earth raised at the lower ends of sloping fields to retain the rain water for some time after the monsoon rains cease. The country to the S. of the Kaimur hills comprises by far the largest portion of the state; but here cultivation is restricted to the valley between the hills and the Sone river, and to a few isolated patches in scattered parts of the forest wastes. The principal river is the Sone, which flows through the state in a N.E. direction into Mirzapur district. Another important river is the Tons, but neither is navigable. The annual rainfall averages about 41 in. The population in 1901 was 1,327,385, showing a decrease of 12% in the decade. Many of the inhabitants of the hilly tracts are Gonds and Kols. Estimated revenue, £200,000. The staple crops are rice, millets and wheat; but more than one-third of the area is covered with forests, yielding timber and lac.</p><p>The S. of the state is crossed by the branch of the Bengal-Nagpur railway from Bilaspur to Katni, which taps the Umaria coal-field. The state suffered from famine in 1896-97, and again to a less</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
