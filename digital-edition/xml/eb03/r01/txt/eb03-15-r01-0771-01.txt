RABAC
a small port on the Arabian coast of the Red Sea, in N. Lat. 22 0 35' 40'' by Mr Bruce’s ac-¢ount. The entry to the harbour is from the E. N. E. and is about a quarter of a mile broad. The port extends about two miles in length to the eastward. The mountains are about three leagues to the north, and the town about four miles north by east from the entrance to the harbour. The water is gcod, and all ships may be supplied here from the wells which are in the neigh-bourhood of the town. The country is bare and un-¢ultivated ; but from the appearance of it, and the freshness of the water, Mr Bruce supposes that it fome-times rains among the mountains here, which is the more probable as it is considerably within the tropic.
