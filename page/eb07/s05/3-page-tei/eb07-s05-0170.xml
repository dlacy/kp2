Another point in regard to operations on tumours ought never to be forgotten, namely, that the most simple and best dispositioned formations may, in the course of time, degenerate into the most malignant and intractable, and therefore should not be exposed to this contingency ; they should be early removed, for the merest steatom has, by circumstances, been transformed into the most frightful and deadly fungus.</p><p>Vascular tumours, of erectile tissue, are now safely and efficiently removed by ligature. Formerly they were usually left undisturbed. Sometimes attempts at excision were made, but the results were truly discouraging, the hæmorrbage proving most alarming, and not unfrequently fatal. In a mere nævus, obliteration of the vessels may be safely effected by vaccination, pressure, acupuncture, seton, or the application of escharotics. But such treatment is totally inapplicable to the erectile tumours. These, when very small, may be removed by excision ; but it is not a safe proceeding, particularly in young patients, to whom loss of blood is of serious consequence. But by ligature, vascular tumours of almost any size and extent are safely removed, by arresting their circulation, and so producing sphacelus of the adventitious structure. When the formation is of a broad base, several ligatures are required, passed beneath the tumour by needles ; and when the integument is free, or but slightly involved, it should be reflected by preliminary incision, so that these ligatures may be the more effectually applied. By such procedure, even enlargement of the thyroid gland may be removed. Of course no one would think of attacking the whole tumour on account of the mere deformity ; but it sometimes happens that enlargement of the isthmus occasions difficult respiration, congestion of the cerebral vessels, and other alarming symptoms ; and in such cases the offending part has been successfully removed by a combination of incision with ligature, using the knife as deeply as the haemorrhage will permit, and then completing the isolation of the lobe by strong ligatures applied by transfixion.</p><p>In the treatment of venereal affections, mercurial supremacy has gradually given way to the influence of common sense, and the disease has consequently become more mild and tractable, particularly in its secondary forms. The primary symptoms are treated as simply local affections, until circumstances prove the contrary, which will be comparatively seldom. When the exhibition of mercury seems advisable, little usually suffices ; it is used, not abused as formerly.</p><p>Hydrocele, which was at one time the apology for very severe surgical proceedings, by knife, setons, and escharotics, is now under very simple treatment ; the palliative, is mere tapping of the cavity ; the permanent, injection of it, after tapping, by some gently stimulating fluid, port wine, for example. But great care must be taken during injection, that none of the fluid enter the cellular tissue of the scrotum, otherwise most violent inflammatory action must ensue in the infiltrated parts.</p><p>Restorative surgery, in former years scarcely attempted, is now making rapid progress towards perfection. Noses are made and repaired most adroitly, not according to the old inconvenient system of the European father of rhinoplastics, but by a modification of the plan practised by the Koomas, a caste of Hindoos, and first introduced into this country by Mr Carpue. This decorative operation has been very successfully practised by Mr Liston, who is the author of an important change in the procedure—not bringing the columna from the forehead, but waiting till the new apex and alæ so obtained are consolidated, and then fashioning</p><p>a column out of the upper lip.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> By this little operation a more vigorous and substantial support is obtained for the new parts ; and, besides, the lip, which formerly hung tumid and pendulous, is at the same time very much improved in appearance. His nasal constructions, he tells us, are scarcely to be distinguished from the natural feature at a little distance, are quite sufficient for the ordinary uses of that organ, and sometimes have been brought to desiderate and enjoy the questionable accomplishment of snuff-taking. He has likewise been very successful in relieving the nose from inconvenient and unseemly encumbrances, produced by lipomatous enlargement of the integument. The excrescence is simply pared off, care being taken not to interfere with the subjacent cartilages. The raw surface usually cicatrizes rapidly, leaving the feature of its natural form and size. By an operation conducted on similar principles as the rhinoplastic, the lower lip is renewed from beneath thc chin ; the ear, or rather portions of it, from the integument behind ; and deficiencies in the urethra can be closed by adaptation of a portion of either tire prepuce or loose neighbouring integument. Such proceedings some may affect to disregard as trivial ; but they are not looked upon as such by the unfortunate individuals to whom they are applicable, and really constitute a most interesting and useful department of operative surgery.</p><p>Harelip, one of the most disagreeable of the congenital deficiencies, can be very perfectly remedied, by paring thc edges of the fissure, and securing them in close and accurate apposition by two or more points of twisted suture. According to the principles already detailed, no further dressing is applied ; and if the patient be otherwise in good health, and the parts protected from external injury, adhesion will seldom or never fail to occur. The most important part of the operation, as regards restoration of the lip’s natural appearance, is complete removal, by the paring of the rounded margins where the membrane that covers the edge of the fissure joins the true prolabium. If this be not attended to, the operation is imperfect, for a most unseemly notch remains in the lip ; in fact, the fissure is merely diminished, not obliterated. But when these rounded portions are completely removed, and the operation is in other respects well conducted, a mere line of cicatrization is all that remains of the deformity.</p><p>Club-foot, a most inconvenient as well as unseemly malformation, is remedied in children by simple means ; merely applying the necessary retentive apparatus, until the parts become fixed in the normal position in which that apparatus places them. Now, the cure is extended even to the adult ; and very many varous feet, formerly regarded as irremediable, are restored to usefulness and symmetry, at thc cost of but slight pain and inconvenience. The first part of the treatment is to sever the tendo Achillis ; an operation simple in performance, and seldom if ever followed by any untoward results. Λ narrow knife or lancet-shaped needle is introduced obliquely through the integument, beneath the tendon, and at a little distance from it on one side ; “ by directing the edge against the resisting fibres, the foot being kept powerfully extended by au assistant, the object can he effected with scarcely a perceptible external wound, and with the escape of only a drop or two of blood.” The foot is then placed in the desired position, and retained so by the suitable apparatus, for the necessary period; the foot becomes both “ useful and ornamental and the space between the separated ends of the divided tendon is, after no long time, firmly and completely occupied by <hi rend="italic">a</hi> new formation, of tendinous structure and capabilities, by means of which the functions of the muscles are ultimately restored.</p><p>@@@* The columnar slip include, the whole thickness of the lip, and in its application is not twisted. The mucous membrane, after exposure in its new situation, soon becomes cuticular in both appearance and function.</p></body></text></TEI>
