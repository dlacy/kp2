            <p>For a fowling-piece of a common caliber, which is from 24 to 30 balls to the pound
                weight, a dram and a quarter, or at moſt a dram and a half, of good powder ; and an
                ounce, or an ounce and a quarter of ſhot, is ſufficient. But when ſhot of a larger
                ſize is uſed, ſuch as N⁰ 5. the charge of ſhot may be increaſed one- fourth, for the
                purpoſe of counterbalancing in ſome degree what the ſize of the ſhot loses in the
                number of pellets, and alſo to enable it to garniſh the more. For this purpoſe the
                ſportſman will find a meaſure marked with the proper gauges very convenient to him.
                An inſtrument of this nature has been made by an ingenious artiſt of London, Egg, of
                the Haymarket.</p>
            <p>A conſequence of overloading with ſhot, is the powder has not ſufficient ſtrength to
                throw it to its proper diſtance ; for if the object fired at be diſtant, one-half of
                the pellets compoſing the charge, by their too great quantity and weight, will
                ſtrike againſt each other, and fall by the way ; and thoſe which reach the mark will
                have ſmall force, and will produce but little or no effect.</p>
            <p>The uſe of the <hi rend="italic">wadding</hi> is to carry the ſhot in a body to a
                certain diſtance from the muzzle of the piece. It ought to be of ſoft and pliable
                materials. The beſt kind of wadding, in the opinion of an experienced fowler, is a
                piece of an old hat ; but this cannot be obtained in ſufficient quantity. Next to it
                nothing is better than ſoft brown paper, which combines ſuppleneſs with conſiſtence,
                moulds itſelf to the barrel, and never falls to the ground within 12 or 15 paces
                from the muzzle of the piece. Tow anſwers very well, and cork has been extolled for
                poſſeſſing the peculiar virtue of increaſing the range and cloſeneſs of the
                ſhot.</p>
            <p>The wadding ought to be quite cloſe in the barrel, but not rammed too hard ; for if
                it be rammed too cloſe, or be of a rigid ſubſtance, the piece will recoil, and the
                ſhot will ſpread too much. On the other hand, if the wadding be very looſe, or is
                compoſed of too ſoft materials, ſuch as wool or cotton, the diſcharge will not
                poſſeſs proper force.</p>
            <p>In loading a piece, the powder ought to be ſlightly rammed down by only preſſing the
                ramrod two or three times on the wadding, and not by drawing up the ramrod and then
                returning it into the barrel with a jerk of</p>
            <p>the arm ſeveral times. For when the powder is violently compreſſed, ſome of the
                grains muſt be bruiſed, which will prevent the exploſion from being quick, and will
                ſpread the ſhot too wide. In pourin the powder into the barrel, the meaſure ought to
                be held ſo as that the powder may fall moſt readily to the bottom. That no grains
                may adhere to the ſides of the barrel, the butt-end of the piece may be ſtruck
                against the ground. The ſhot ought never to be rammed down with force : it is
                ſufficient to ſtrike the butt-end of the gun againſt the ground as before. Then the
                wadding is to be put down gently. A ſportſman ought never to carry his gun under his
                arm with the muzzle inclined downwards, for this practice looſens the wadding and
                charge too much.</p>
            <p>Immediately after the piece is fired it ought to be reloaded ; for while the barrel
                is ſtill warm, there is no danger of any moiſture lodging in it to hinder the powder
                from falling to the bottom. As it is found that the coldneſs of the barrel, and
                perhaps the moiſture condenſed in it, diminishes the force of the powder in the
                firſt ſhot ; it is proper to fire off a little powder before the piece is loaded.
                Some prime before loading, but this is not proper unleſs the touch-hole be very
                large. After every diſcharge the touch-hole ought to be pricked, or a ſmall feather
                may be inſerted to clear away any humidity or foulneſs that has been contracted.</p>
            <p>The ſportſman having loaded his piece, muſt next prepare to fire. For this purpoſe he
                ought to place his hand near the entrance of the ramrod, and at the ſame time graſp
                the barrel firmly. The muzzle ſhould be a little elevated, for it is more uſual to
                ſhoot low than high. This direction ought particularly to be attended to when the
                object is a little diſtant ; becauſe ſhot as well as ball only moves a certain
                diſtance point blank, when it begins to deſcribe the curve of the parabola.</p>
            <p>Practice ſoon teaches the ſportſman the proper distance at which he ſhould ſhoot. The
                diſtance at which he ought infallibly to kill any kind of game with patent ſhot,
                    N<hi rend="superscript">o</hi> 3. provided the aim be well taken, is from 25 to
                35 paces for the footed, and from 40 to 45 paces for the winged, game. Beyond this
                diſtance even to 50 or 55 paces, both partridges and hares are ſometimes killed ;
                but in general the hares are only ſlightly wounded, and carry away the ſhot ; and
                the partridges at that diſtance preſent ſo ſmall a ſurface, that they frequently
                eſcape untouched between the ſpaces of the circle. Yet it does not follow that a
                partridge may not be killed with N⁰ 3 patent ſhot at 60 and even 70 paces diſtance,
                but then theſe ſhots are very rare.</p>
            <p>In ſhooting at a bird flying, or a hare running acroſs, it is neceſſary to take aim
                before the object in proportion to its diſtance at the time of firing. If a
                partridge flies acroſs at the diſtance of 30 or 35 paces, it will be ſufficient to
                aim at the head, or at moſt but a ſmall ſpace before it. If it be 50, 60, or 70
                paces distant, it is then requiſite to aim at leaſt half a foot before the head. The
                ſame practice ought to be obſerved in ſhooting at a hare, rabbit, or fox, when
                running in a croſs direction ; at the ſame time making due allowance</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(b)</hi> The reader will obſerve, that the patent ſhot has no

                numbers do not follow each other in the order of progreſſion : the reaſon of this we
