<p><span class="font0">will greatly 'aſſiſt our conception o'f the manner in which motion is thus produced in </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">diſtant particle, if we conſider the particles as ſo many little balls, connected with&nbsp;each other by ſlender ſpiral ſprings like cork-ſcrews.&nbsp;This would compoſe a maſs which would be compreſ-ſible, or which could be ſtretched, &amp;c. And if we give&nbsp;an impulſe to one of theſe balls, we ſhall ſet the whole&nbsp;aſſemblage in motion round any axis which we may&nbsp;ſuppoſe to ſupport it. Now any one of theſe balls is&nbsp;really and immediately moved by the elaſticity of the&nbsp;ſpiral wares which join it to its neighbours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are but little acquainted with the nature of theſe connecting forces. It can be learned only by the phenomena which arc their effects. Theſe are various, almoſt beyond defoliation ; but the mechanical philoſo-pher has little to do wfith this variety. '1 he diſtinctionS&nbsp;which are the immediate cauſes of fluidity, of hardneſs,&nbsp;ſoftneſs, elaſticity, ductility, are not of very difficult&nbsp;conception. There is one general fact which is ſuſſicient for our preſent purpoſe - the forces by which the&nbsp;particles of bodies act on each other are equal. This&nbsp;is a matter of unexcepted experience ; and no other foundation can be given to it as a law of mechanical nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An immediate conſequence </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">this law is, that wſhen two external forces A and B are in equilibrium by the&nbsp;intervention of a folid body (or rather w<sup>r</sup>hen a ſolidbody&nbsp;fis in equilibrium betw<sup>r</sup>een tw<sup>r</sup>o external forces), theſe&nbsp;forces are equal and oppoſite ; for the force A is in&nbsp;fact </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">immediate equilibrium wfith the oppoſite forces&nbsp;exerted by the particle to which it is applied, and is&nbsp;therefore equal and oppoſite to the force reſulting from&nbsp;the combination of all the forces which connect that&nbsp;particle with the ſeries of particles immediately adjoining. This reſulting force may with propriety be called&nbsp;tfie equivalent of the forces from the combination of&nbsp;which it reſults. The uſe of this term will greatly abbreviate language. This firſt ſet of connecting forces&nbsp;conſiſts of a number of diſtinct forces correſponding to&nbsp;each particle of the ſeries, and each force has an equal&nbsp;and oppoſite force correſponding to it : therefore the&nbsp;compound force by wſhich the firſt ſeries of particles&nbsp;acts on that to which the external force A is applied, is&nbsp;equal and oppoſite to the compound force which connects this ſirſt ſeries with the next ſeries. And the&nbsp;ſame thing muſt be ſaid of each ſucceeding ſeries of&nbsp;particles, till w<sup>r</sup>e come at laſt to the particle to which&nbsp;the external force B is immediately applied. The force&nbsp;exerted by this particle is equal and oppoſite to that external force ; and it is equal to the compound force&nbsp;exerted by the ſecond ſeries of particles on that fide ;&nbsp;therefore the forces A and B are equal and oppoſite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It reſults ſrom this propoſition, that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">when any number of external forces are applied to a folid body, and it is in&nbsp;equilibrio between them, they are ſuch as would be in equilibrio iſ they were all applied to one point.</span><span class="font0"> Let the forces «A, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> B, cC (ſig. 2.), be applied to three particles&nbsp;of the folid body. Therefore </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> A is immediately in&nbsp;■equilibrium with an equal and oppoſite force A a, reſulting from the compoſition of the force AD, wſhich&nbsp;connects the particles A and </span><span class="font1">B, </span><span class="font0">and the force AE&nbsp;■which connects A wfith C. In like manner </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> B is immediately in equilibrio wfith </span><span class="font1">B </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß,</span><span class="font0"> the equivalent of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">forces BF and BG j and c C is in immediate equilibrio</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">with the equivalent C χ of the forces CH and CI. </span><span class="font1">We </span><span class="font0">ſhall conceive it very clearly if we ſuppoſe the three&nbsp;forces A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font1"> B </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font0"> C </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c,</span><span class="font0"> to be exerted by means of threads&nbsp;pulling at the folid body. The connecting parts be*&nbsp;tween A and B, as alſo between A and C, are ſtretched. The lines AB and AC may be conſidered as elaſtic threads. Each thread is equally ſtretched through&nbsp;its wfiιole length ; and therefore if we take AD to repreſent the force wfith which the particle A is held&nbsp;back by the particle B, and if we would alſo repreſent&nbsp;the force with wſhich B is held back by A, we muſt&nbsp;make BF equal to AD. Now (n<sup>0</sup> 9.) the forces AD&nbsp;and BF are equal and oppoſite ; ſo are the forces AE&nbsp;and CI ; ſo are the forces CH and BG. Now it is&nbsp;evident, that if the ſix forces AD, BF, BG, CH, CI,&nbsp;AE, were applied to one particle, the particle would&nbsp;be iri equilibrio; for each force is accompanied by an&nbsp;equal and oppoſite force : and iſ the force A «■ were&nbsp;applied in place of AD, AE, the equilibrium w<sup>r</sup>ould&nbsp;remain, becauſe A≈ is equivalent to AD and AE.&nbsp;The ſame is true of B </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font0"> and C χ. Therefore if the&nbsp;three forces A «, B </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß,</span><span class="font0"> C <sup>,</sup>, were applied to one point,&nbsp;they would be in equilibrio. Conſequently if the three&nbsp;forces a A, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> B, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> C, which are reſpectively equal and&nbsp;oppoſite to A ≈, B </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ß, C</span><span class="font0"> <sup>x</sup>-, are ſo applied, they will be&nbsp;in equilibrio. It is plain that this demonſtration may&nbsp;be extended to any number of forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We may juſt remark by the bye, that if three forces are thus in equilibrio, they are acting in one plane ;&nbsp;and, if they are not parallel, they are really directed&nbsp;to one point : for any one of them muſt be equal and&nbsp;oppoſite to the equivalent of the other two ; and this&nbsp;equivalent is the diagonal of a parallelogram, of which&nbsp;the other two are the ſides, and the diagonal and ſides&nbsp;of any parallelogram are in one plane -; and ſince they&nbsp;are in one plane, anti any one of them is in equilibrio&nbsp;wfith the equivalent of the other two, it muſt paſs thro’&nbsp;the ſame point wfith that equivalent, that is, through&nbsp;the point of concourſe of the other </span><span class="font1">two. -</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe very limple propoſitions are the foundation of the whole theory of ſtatics, and render it a very ſimple&nbsp;branch of mechanical ſcience. It has been made ab-ſtruſe by our very attempts to Amplify it. Many elaborate treatiſes have been written on the fundamental&nbsp;property of the lever, and in them all it has been&nbsp;thought next to an inſuperable difficulty to clemonſtrate&nbsp;the equilibrium of a ſtraight lever when the parallel&nbsp;forces are inverſely as their diſtances from the fulcrum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We think the demonſtrations of Archimedes, Fonſe-nex, D’Alembert, and Hamilton, extremely ingenious; but they only bring the mind into ſuch a ſtate of conception that it cannot refuſe the truth of the propoſition ; and, except Mr Hamilton’s, they labour under&nbsp;the diſadvantage of being applicable only to commen-ſurable tliſtances anti forces. Mr Vince’s, in the Philoſophical Tranſactions for 1794, is the moſt ingenious&nbsp;of them all ; and it is wmnderful that it has not occurred&nbsp;long ago. The difficulty in them all has ariſen from&nbsp;the attempt to ſimplify the matter by conſidering ∙a lever as an inflexible ſtraight line. Had it been taken&nbsp;out of this abſtract form, and conſidered as what it&nbsp;really is, a natural body, of ſome ſize, having its particles connected by equal and oppoſite forces, all «diſſi-culty would have vaniſhed.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
