<p><span class="font0">the ambitious boyars, nor the pillaging Cossacks, nor the German mercenaries were satisfied with the change, and soon&nbsp;a new impostor, likewise calling himself Dimitri, son of Tsar&nbsp;Ivan, came forward as the rightful heir. Like his predecessor,&nbsp;he enjoyed the protection and support of the Polish&nbsp;king, Sigismund III., and was strong enough to&nbsp;compel Shuiski to abdicate; but as soon as the&nbsp;throne was vacant Sigismund put forward as a&nbsp;candidate his own son, Wladislaus. To this latter the people&nbsp;of Moscow swore allegiance on condition of his maintaining</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Orthodoxy and granting certain rights, and on this understanding the Polish troops were allowed to occupy the city and the Kremlin. Then Sigismund unveiled his real plan,&nbsp;which was to obtain the throne not for his son but for&nbsp;himself. This scheme did not please any ‘of the contending&nbsp;factions and it roused the anti-Catholic fanaticism of the&nbsp;masses. At the same time it was displeasing to the Swedes,&nbsp;who had become rivals of the Poles on the Baltic coast,&nbsp;and they started a false Dimitri of their own in Novgorod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russia was thus in a very critical condition. The throne was vacant, the great nobles quarrelling among themselves,&nbsp;the Cathoh'c Poles in the Kremlin of Moscow, the&nbsp;Protestant Swedes in Novgorod, and enormous bands&nbsp;of brigands everywhere. The severity of the crisis&nbsp;produced a remedy, in the form of a patriotic rising&nbsp;of the masses under the leadership of a butcher called Minin&nbsp;and a Prince Pozharski. In a short time the invaders were&nbsp;expelled, and a Grand National Assembly elected as tsar&nbsp;Michael Romfinov, the young son of the metropolitan Philaret,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">who was connected by marriage with the late dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the reign of Michael (1613-45) the new dynasty came to be accepted by all classes, and the country recovered&nbsp;to some extent from the disorders and exhaustion&nbsp;from which it had suffered so severely; but it was not&nbsp;strong enough to pursue at once an aggressive foreign&nbsp;policy, and the tsar prudently determined to make peace with&nbsp;Sweden and conclude an armistice of fourteen years with&nbsp;Poland. At the conclusion of the armistice in 1632, during&nbsp;a short interregnum in Poland, he attempted to avenge past&nbsp;injuries and recover lost territory; but the campaign was not&nbsp;successful, and in 1634 he signed a definitive treaty by no means&nbsp;favourable to Russia. That lesson was laid to heart, and he&nbsp;subsequently maintained a purely defensive attitude. As a&nbsp;precaution against Tatar invasions he founded fortified towns&nbsp;on his southern frontiers—Tambov, Kozlov, Penza and&nbsp;Simbirsk; but when the Don Cossacks offered him Azov, which&nbsp;they had captured from the Turks, and a National Assembly,&nbsp;convoked for the purpose of considering the question, were in&nbsp;favour of accepting it as a means of increasing Russian influence on the Black Sea, he decided that the town should be&nbsp;restored to the sultan, much to the disappointment of its captors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the reign of Michael's successor, Alexius (1645-76), the country recovered its strength so rapidly that the tsar was&nbsp;tempted to revive the energetic aggressive policy&nbsp;and put forward claims to Livonia, Lithuania and&nbsp;Little Russia, but he was obliged to moderate his&nbsp;pretensions. Livonia continued to be under Swedish rule, and&nbsp;Lithuania remained united with Poland. Some advantages,&nbsp;however, were obtained. Smolensk and Chernigov were&nbsp;definitely incorporated in the tsardom of Muscovy, and great</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">progress was made towards the absorption of Little Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roughly speaking, Little Russia, otherwise called the Ukraine, may be described as the basin of the Dnieper southward of the 51st parallel of latitude. In the 16th century it was a thinly populated region inhabited&nbsp;chiefly by Cossacks, speaking the so-called Little</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russian dialect, and until 1569 it formed nominally part of Lithuania, but was practically independent. In that year,&nbsp;when Lithuania and Poland were permanently united, it fell&nbsp;under Polish rule, and the Polish government considered it&nbsp;necessary to tame the wild inhabitants and bring them under&nbsp;regular administration. For this decision there were good&nbsp;reasons, for those turbulent sons of the steppe paid no taxes&nbsp;and were much given to brigandage, and their raiding propensities occasionally created international difficulties with the&nbsp;khan of the Crimea and the sultan of Turkey. It was proposed,&nbsp;therefore, in 1576, that 6000 families should be registered as a&nbsp;militia under a Polish Hetman for the protection of the country&nbsp;against Tatar raids, and that the remainder of the inhabitants&nbsp;should be assimilated to the ordinary peasants of Poland. This&nbsp;arrangement was very distasteful to all classes. The registered&nbsp;Cossacks objected to being placed under a Hetman not freely&nbsp;chosen by themselves, and those who were not included in the&nbsp;militia objected still more strongly to the prospect of being&nbsp;reduced to the miserable condition of Polish serfs. To escape&nbsp;this danger many of them moved down the river and settled&nbsp;on the waste lands beyond the rapids. Here, about 1590, was&nbsp;founded an independent military colony called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Setch,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;members of which, recognizing no authority but that of their&nbsp;own elected officers, lived by fishing, hunting and making raids&nbsp;on the Tatars, and were always ready to assist their less fortunate countrymen in resisting Polish aggression. For half a&nbsp;century the struggle between the two races went on with varying&nbsp;success, but on the whole the Polish government proved stronger&nbsp;than its insubordinate subjects, and about 1638 it seemed to&nbsp;have attained its object. Polish proprietors settled in large&nbsp;numbers on the Cossack territory, and great efforts were made,&nbsp;with the assistance of the Jesuits, to bring the Orthodox population under papal authority. But for both proprietors and&nbsp;Jesuits a surprise was in store. Threatened seriously in their&nbsp;liberty and their faith, the people rose with greater enthusiasm&nbsp;than before, and a general insurrection, in which the peasants&nbsp;joined, spread over the whole country under the leadership of&nbsp;Bogdan Chmielnicki or Khmelnitski (g.v.), whose name is still&nbsp;remembered in the Ukraine. As in all previous insurrections&nbsp;the Poles proved stronger in the field, and Khmelnitski in&nbsp;desperation sought foreign assistance, first in Constantinople&nbsp;and then in Moscow. For some time Tsar Alexius hesitated,&nbsp;because he knew that intervention could entail a war with&nbsp;Poland, but after consulting a National Assembly on the subject, he decided to take Little Russia under his protection, and&nbsp;in January 1654 a great Cossack assembly ratified the arrangement, on the understanding that a large part of the old local&nbsp;autonomy should be preserved. In the expected war with&nbsp;Poland, which followed quickly, the Russians were so successful&nbsp;that the arrangement was upheld; but it was soon found that&nbsp;the Cossacks, though they professed unbounded devotion to&nbsp;the Orthodox tsar, disliked Muscovite, quite as much as Polish,&nbsp;interference in their internal affairs, and some of their leaders&nbsp;were in favour of substituting federation with Poland for&nbsp;annexation by Russia. In these circumstances the tsar was&nbsp;induced to accept a compromise, and signed in 1667 the treaty&nbsp;of Andrussovo, by which the territory in dispute was partitioned&nbsp;and the middle course of the Dnieper became the frontier between Russia and Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the reign of Alexius a conflict took place between the tsar and the patriarch, which is often described as a conflict&nbsp;between Church and State, and which illustrates the&nbsp;relations between the temporal and the spiritual power&nbsp;in Russian state-organization. Until the beginning of&nbsp;the 17th century the Byzantine tradition that in&nbsp;all matters outside the sphere of dogma the ecclesiastical is&nbsp;subordinate to the civil power had been observed in Russia;&nbsp;but the traditional conceptions had been to some extent undermined during the reign of Michael, when the metropolitan&nbsp;Philaret, who was the tsar’s father </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(vide supra),</span><span class="font0"> became patriarch&nbsp;and was associated with his son in the government on a footing&nbsp;of equality. Like the tsar, he had the official title of “ Great&nbsp;Lord ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(veliki gosud&amp;r),</span><span class="font0"> and he had his palace, his court-dignitaries, his retinue, his boyars and his officials all organized&nbsp;on the model of those of the sovereign. Without his assent&nbsp;and blessing no important decisions were taken, all state documents emanating from the highest authority bore his signature, and he was regarded, both in the official world and by the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
