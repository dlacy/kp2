<p><span class="font1">to important posts, wrote on Rome’s policy and wars in the East. Appian (v. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">supra)</span><span class="font1"> dealt with the wars waged under the early empire&nbsp;in the closing books of his work, which have not been preserved.&nbsp;Dio Cassius, a Bithynian who attained to the dignity of a second&nbsp;consulship as the colleague of Severus Alexander, wrote a history&nbsp;of Rome to the death of Elagabalus in 80 books. We possess&nbsp;only epitomes and excerpts of the portion dealing with events from&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">A.d.</span><span class="font1"> 46 onwards, except for parts of the 78th and 79th books, in&nbsp;which Dio’s narrative of contemporary events is especially valuable.&nbsp;Herodian, a Syrian employed in the imperial service, wrote a history&nbsp;of the emperors from Commodus to Gordian HI., which as the work&nbsp;of a contemporary is not without value, although the author had no&nbsp;historical insight. L. Marius Maximus compiled biographies of the&nbsp;emperors from Nerva to Elagabalus which, like those of Suetonius,&nbsp;contained much worthless gossip. His work was amongst the&nbsp;sources used in the compilation 01 the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia Augusta</span><span class="font1"> (see further&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Augustan History),</span><span class="font1"> upon which we are obliged to rely for the&nbsp;history of the 3rd century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> This work consists in a series of&nbsp;lives of the emperors (including most of the pretenders to that title)&nbsp;from Hadrian to Carinus, professedly written by six authors,&nbsp;Spartianus, Vulcacius Gallicanus, Capitolinus, Lampridius,Trebellius&nbsp;Pollio, and Vopiscus, under Diocletian and Constantine. Modern&nbsp;criticism has shown that (at least in its present form) it is a compilation made towards the close of the ^th century; it is not even&nbsp;certain that any of the above-named writers really existed, and the&nbsp;documents inserted in the text are palpable forgeries. The earlier&nbsp;biographies, however, contain much authentic information, which&nbsp;seems to have been derived from a good contemporary source. The&nbsp;fragments of Dexippus, an Athenian who successfully defended his&nbsp;native town against the Goths, throw much light on the barbaric&nbsp;invasions of the 3rd century. Under Diocletian and his successors&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 289-321) were delivered twelve </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Panegyrics</span><span class="font1"> by Eumenius and&nbsp;other court rhetoricians which possess slight historical value. The&nbsp;history of the final struggle between church and empire is told from&nbsp;the Christian point of view by the author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De mortibus per-secutorum—</span><span class="font1">perhaps Lactantius, the tutor of Crispus. Eusebius’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ecclesiastical History</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Constantine</span><span class="font1"> give an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex parte&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">version of the events which they relate; the first of two tracts&nbsp;published under the name of. the Anonymus Valesianus furnishes&nbsp;a brief contemporary narrative of the period 305-37, without&nbsp;Christian prepossessions; while the lost work of Praxagoras treated&nbsp;the history of Constantine from the pagan standpoint. The most&nbsp;important historian of the 4th century was Ammianus Marcellinus,&nbsp;a native of Antioch and an officer in the imperial guard, who continued the work of Tacitus (in Latin) to the death of Valens. We&nbsp;possess the last eighteen books of his history which cover the years&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 353-78. Two compendia of imperial history pass under the&nbsp;name of Aurelius Victor, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caesares,</span><span class="font1"> or lives of the emperors from&nbsp;Augustus to Julian, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epitome de. Caesaribus</span><span class="font1"> (not by the same&nbsp;author,) which goes down to Theodosius I. Similar works are the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Breviarum</span><span class="font1"> of Eutropius (secretary of state under Valens) and the&nbsp;still more brief epitome of Festus.. The writings of the Emperor&nbsp;Julian and of the rhetoricians Libanius, Themistius and Eunapius—&nbsp;the last-named continued the history of Dexippus to </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 404—are&nbsp;of great value for the latter part of the 4th century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> They wrote&nbsp;as pagans, while the. Christian version of events is given by the&nbsp;three orthodox historians Socrates, Sozomen and Theodoret, and&nbsp;the Arian Philostorgius, all of whom wrote in the 5th century. An&nbsp;imperial official, Zosimus, writing in the latter half of that century,&nbsp;gave a sketch of imperial history to </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 410; the latter part is&nbsp;zaluable, being based on contemporary writings, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> those of the&nbsp;Egyptian Olympiodorus, of whose work some fragments arc preserved. The bishops Synesius and Palladius, who lived under&nbsp;Arcadius and Theodosius IL, furnish valuable information as to&nbsp;their own times; while the fragments of Priscus tell us much of&nbsp;Attila and the Hunnish invasions. Mention must also be made of&nbsp;the poets and letter-writers of the 4th and 5th centuries—Ausonius,&nbsp;Claudian, Symmachus, Paulinus of Nola, Sidonius Apollinaris,&nbsp;Prudentius, Merobaudes and others—from whose writings much&nbsp;historical information is derived. Cassiodorus, the minister of&nbsp;Theodoric, wrote a history of the Goths, transmitted to us in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia Gothorum</span><span class="font1"> of Jordanes (c. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 550), which gives an account&nbsp;of the earlier barbaric invasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Several chronological works were compiled in the 4th and 5th centuries. It will suffice to name the Chronology of Eusebius&nbsp;(to </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 324), translated by Jerome and carried down to </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 378;&nbsp;the Chronicle of Prosper Tiro, based on Jerome and continued&nbsp;to A.D. .455; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronography of A.D. 354&gt;</span><span class="font1"> an illustrated calendar&nbsp;containing miscellaneous information; and the works based on the&nbsp;so-called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronica Constantinopolitana</span><span class="font1"> (not preserved), such as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fasti</span><span class="font1"> of Hydatius (containing valuable notices of the period </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">379-468). Some minor chronological works such as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicon&nbsp;Ravennae</span><span class="font1"> are published in Mommsen’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronica Minora.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicon Paschale,</span><span class="font1"> primarily a table giving the cyle of Easter&nbsp;celebrations, was compiled in the 7th century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Codes of Law, especially the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Codex Theodosianus </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 438) and the Code of Justinian, as well as the Army List of the early 5th&nbsp;century, known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia Dignitatum,</span><span class="font1"> possess great historical&nbsp;value. For the inscriptions of the empire, which are of incalculable&nbsp;importance as showing the working of the imperial system in its&nbsp;details, see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Inscriptions;</span><span class="font1"> the coins (ç.v.)also throw much light on&nbsp;the dark places of history in the lack of other authorities. Egyptian&nbsp;papyri are not only instructive as to legal, economic and administrative history, but also (by the formulae employed in their dating)&nbsp;contribute to our general knowledge of events. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zeitschrift für&nbsp;Papyrusforschung,</span><span class="font1"> edited by U.

B. Bury s edition (1897-1900).&nbsp;The history of the empire has yet to be written in the light of recent&nbsp;discoveries. Mommsen’s fifth volume (Eng. tr., as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Provinces of the&nbsp;Roman Empire,</span><span class="font1"> 1886) is not a narrative, but an account of Roman&nbsp;culture in the various provinces. C.

H. Schiller’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der römischen&nbsp;Kaiserzeit</span><span class="font1"> (1883-88) is a useful handbook.

<p><span class="font1">A general history of. Rome to the barbarian invasions, popular in character and richly illustrated, was written in French by Victor&nbsp;Duruy (Eng. tr. in 6 vols., 1883-86).

<p><span class="font1">IV. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Roman Republic in the Middle Ages</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The history of the Roman commune as distinguished from the papacy during the middle ages has yet to be written, and&nbsp;only by the discovery of new documents can the difficulties of&nbsp;the task be completely overcome. Although very different in&nbsp;its origin, the Roman Republic gradually assumed the same&nbsp;form as the other Italian communes, and with almost identical&nbsp;institutions. But, owing to the special local conditions amid&nbsp;which it arose, it maintained a distinct physiognomy and&nbsp;character. The deserted Campagna surrounding the city&nbsp;checked any notable increase of trade or industry, and prevented&nbsp;the establishment of the gilds on the solid footing that elsewhere&nbsp;made them the basis and support of the commune. There was&nbsp;also the continual and oppressive influence of the empire, and,&nbsp;above all, the presence of the papacy, which often appeared to&nbsp;absorb the political vitality of the city. At such moments the&nbsp;commune seemed annihilated, but it speedily revived and&nbsp;reasserted itself. Consequently there are many apparent gaps&nbsp;in its history, and we have often extreme difficulty in discovering&nbsp;the invisible links connecting the visible fragments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even the aristocracy of Rome had a special stamp. In the other republics, with the exception of Venice, it was feudal,&nbsp;of German origin, and in perpetual conflict with the popular&nbsp;and commercial elements which sought its destruction. The&nbsp;history of municipal freedom in Italy lay in this struggle. But&nbsp;the infiltration of Teutonic and feudal elements broke up the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
