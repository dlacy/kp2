At the reſtoration he came to London to join the general jubilee; and commenced wit, courtier, poet, and gallant. He was ſo much admired, that he became a kind of oracle among the poets; which made king Charles tell him, that Nature had given him a patent to be Apollo’s viceroy. The productions of his pen were some plays, and ſeveral delicately tender amorous poems, in which the ſoftneſs of the verses was ſo exquiſite, as to be called by the duke of Buckingham <hi rend="italic">Sedley’s witchcraft.</hi> “There were no marks of genius or true poetry to be deſcried, (ſay the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Biographia Britannica);</hi> the art wholly conſiſted in raiſing looſe thoughts and lewd deſires, without giving any alarm; and ſo the poiſon worked gently and irreſiſtibly. Our author, we may be ſure, did not eſcape the infection of his own art, or rather was firſt tainted himſelf before he ſpread the infection to others.’’—A very ingenious writer of the preſent day, however, ſpeaks much more favourably of Sir Charles Sedley’s writings. “He ſtudied human nature; and was diſtinguiſhed for the art of making himſelf agreeable, particularly to the ladies; for the verſes of Lord Rocheſter, beginning with, <hi rend="italic">Sedley has that prevailing gentle art,</hi> &amp;c. ſo often quoted, allude not to his <hi rend="italic">writings,</hi> but to his <hi rend="italic">personal addreſs." [Langhorn's Effusions,</hi> &amp;c.]—But while he thus grew in reputation for wit and in favour with the king, he grew poor and debauched: his eſtate was impaired, and his morals were corrupted. One of his frolics, however, being followed by an indictment and a heavy fine, Sir Charles took a more ſerious turn, applied himſelf to buſineſs, and became a member of parliament, in which he was a frequent ſpeaker. We find him in the Houſe of Commons in the reign of James II. whoſe attempts upon the conſtitution he vigorouſly withſtood; and he was very active in bringing on the revolution. This was thought more extraordinary, as he had received favours from James. But that prince had taken a fancy to Sir Charles’s daughter (though it ſeems ſhe was not very handſome), and, in conſequence of his intrigues with</p><p>her, he created Miſs Sedley counteſs of Dorcheſter, This honour, ſo far from pleaſing, greatly ſhocked Sir Charles. However libertine he himſelf had been, yet he could not bear the thoughts of his daughter’s diſhonour; and with regard to her exaltation, he only considered it as rendering her more conſpicuouſly infamous. He therefore conceived a hatred for the king; and from this, as well as other motives, readily joined to diſpoſſeſs him of the throne. A witty ſaying of Sedley’s, on this occaſion, is recorded. “I hate ingratitude, (ſaid Sir Charles); and therefore, as the king has made my daughter a counteſs, ‘I will endeavour to make his daughter a queen;” meaning the princeſs Mary, married to the prince of Orange, who diſpoſſeſſed James of the throne at the revolution. He lived to the beginning of queen Anne’s reign; and his works were printed in 2 vols 8vo, 1719.</p><p>SEDR, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sedre,</hi> the high-prieſt of the ſect of Ali among the Perſians. The ſedre is appointed by the emperor of Perſia, who uſually confers the dignity on his neareſt relation. The juriſdiction of the ſedre extends over all effects deſtined for pious purpoſes, over all moſques, hoſpitals, colleges, ſepulchres, and monaſteries. He diſpoſes of all eccleſiaſtical employments, and nominates all the ſuperiors of religious houſes. His deciſions in matters of religion are received as ſo many infallible oracles; he judges of all criminal matters in his own houſe without appeal. His authority is balanced by that of the mudſitehid, or firſt theologue of the empire.</p><p>SEDUCTION, is the act of tempting and drawing aſide ſrom the right path, and comprehends every endeavour to corrupt any individual of the human race. This is the import of the word in its largeſt and moſt general ſenſe; but it is commonly employed to expreſs the act of tempting a virtuous woman to part with her chaſtity.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">ſeducer</hi> of female innocence practiſes the fame ſtratagems of fraud to get poſſeſſion of a woman’s perſon, that the <hi rend="italic">ſiuindler</hi> employs to get poſſeſſion of his neighbour’s goods or money; yet the law of honour, which pretends to abhor <hi rend="italic">deceit,</hi> and which impels its votaries to <hi rend="italic">murder</hi> every man who preſumes, however juſtly, to ſuſpect them of fraud, or to queſtion their veracity, applauds the addreſs of a ſucceſsful intrigue, tho' it be well known that the ſeducer could not have obtained his end without ſwearing to the truth of a thouſand falſehoods, and calling upon God to witneſs promiſes which he never meant to fulfil.</p><p>The law of honour is indeed a very capricious rule, which accommodates itſelf to the pleaſures and conveniences of higher life; but the law of the land, which is enacted for the equal protection of high and low, may be ſuppoſed to view the guilt of ſeduction with a more impartial eye. Yet for this offence, even the laws of this kingdom have provided no other puniſhment than a pecuniary ſatisfaction to the injured family 5 which, in England, can be obtained only by one ol the quainteſt fictions in the world, by the father’s bringing his action againſt the ſeducer for the loſs of his daughter’s ſervice during her pregnancy and nurturing. See Paley’s <hi rend="italic">Moral Philoſophy,</hi> Book III. Part iii. Chap. 3.</p><p>The moraliſt, however, who eſtimates the merit or demerit of actions, not by laws of human appointment, but by their general conſequences as eſtablrſhed by the laws of nature, muſt conſider the ſeducer as a criminal</p></body></text></TEI>
