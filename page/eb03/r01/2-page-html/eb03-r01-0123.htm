<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">peheve that eur </span><span class="font2">naval architects are </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">not </span><span class="font2">diflpoſed to grant that they have profited much by all the labours&nbsp;of the mathematicians. But the ancients had not made&nbsp;any great progreſs in the phyſicomathematical ſciences,&nbsp;which conſiſt chiefly in thc application of calculus to&nbsp;the phenomena of nature. In this branch they could&nbsp;make none, becaufe they had not the means of inveſtigation. A knowledge of the motions and actions of&nbsp;fluids is acceſſible only to thoſe who are familiarly&nbsp;acquainted with the fluχionary mathematics; and with-out this key there is no admittance. Even when pof</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">feffed </span><span class="font2">of this guide, our progreſs has been very flow,&nbsp;heſitating, and devious ; and we have not yet been able&nbsp;to eſtabliſti any ſet of doctrines which are ſuſceptible&nbsp;of an eafy and confident application to the arts of life.&nbsp;If we have advanced farther than the ancients, it is becauſe we have come after them, and have proſited by&nbsp;their labours, and even by their miſtakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Sir Ifaac Newton was the firſt (as far as we can recollect) who attempted to make the motions and ac-tions of fluids the ſubject of mathematical diſcuſſion. Ηe had invented the method of fluxions long before&nbsp;he engaged in his phyfical reſearches ; and he proceeded&nbsp;in theſe </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſua mαthfi facem pr¢ſerente.</span><span class="font2"> Yet even with this&nbsp;guide he was often obliged to grope his way, and&nbsp;to try various bye-paths, in the hopes of obtaining&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">legitimate theory. Having exerted all his powers&nbsp;in eſtabliſhing a theory of the lunar motions, he was&nbsp;obliged to reſt contented with an approximation inſtead oſ a perfect folution of the problem which aſcer-tains the motions of three bodies mutually acting on&nbsp;each other. This convinced him that it was in vain&nbsp;to expect an accurate inveſtigation of the motions and&nbsp;actions of fluids, where millions of unfeen particles&nbsp;combine their influence. He therefore caſt about to&nbsp;ſind ſome particular caſe of the problem which would&nbsp;admit of an accurate determination, and at the ſame&nbsp;time furniſh circumftances of analogy or reſemblance&nbsp;ſuſſiciently numerous for giving limiting caſes, which&nbsp;ſhould include between them thoſe other caſes that did&nbsp;not admit of this accurate inveſtigation. And thus,&nbsp;by knowing the limit to which the cafe propoſed did&nbsp;approximate, and the circumſtance which regulated the&nbsp;approximation, many uſeful propoſitions might be deduced for directing us in the application of theſe doc-trines to the arts of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He therefore figured to himſelf a hypothetical collection of matter which poffeffed the characteriſtic pro-perty of fluidity, viz. the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">quaqudverfum</span><span class="font2"> propagation of preffure, and the moſt perfect intermobility (pardon&nbsp;the uncouth term) of parts, and which formed a phy.&nbsp;ſical whole or aggregate, whoſe parts were connected&nbsp;by mechanical forces, determined both in degree and&nbsp;in direction, and ſuch as rendered the determination of&nbsp;certain important circumſtances of their motion ſuſceptible of preciſe inveſtigation. And he conςluded, that&nbsp;the laws which he ſhould difcover in theſe motions muſt&nbsp;have a great analogy with the laws of the motions of&nbsp;real fluids : And from this hypotheſis he deduced a ſe-rιes of propoiitions, which form the baſis of almoſt all&nbsp;the theories of the impulfe and reſiftance of fluids which&nbsp;have been offered to the public ſince his time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It muſt be acknowledged, that the reſults of this theory agree but ill with experiment, and that, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in the&nbsp;way in which it has been zealouſly proj'ecuted by ſubſequent&nbsp;mathematicians,</span><span class="font2"> it proceeds on principles or aſſumptions&nbsp;which are not only gratuitous, but even falſe. But it&nbsp;affords ſuch a beautiful appl ication of geometry and&nbsp;calculus, that mathematicians have been as it were faf-cinated by it, and have publiſhed ſyſtems ſo elegant&nbsp;and ſo extenſively applicable, that one cannot help lamenting that the foundation is ſo flimſy. John Bernoulli’s theory, in his differtation on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">communica-</span><span class="font2">' tion of motion, and Bouguer’s in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Traité du Navire,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theoriedu Manœuvre et delà Mâture des k<sup>r</sup>aif-feau ∖,</span><span class="font2"> muſt ever be conſidered as among the fineſt ſpecimens of phyſicomathematical ſcience which the world&nbsp;has ſeen. And, with all its imperfections, this theory&nbsp;ſtill furniſhes (as w’as expected by its illuſtrious author)&nbsp;many propoſitions of immenfe practical uſe, they being the limits to which the real phenomena of the impulſe and refiſtance of fluids really approximate. So&nbsp;that when the law by which th'e phenomena deviate&nbsp;from the theory is once determined by a well choſen&nbsp;ſeries of experiments, this hypothetical theory becomes&nbsp;almoſt as valuable as a true one. And we may add,&nbsp;that although Mr d’Alembert, by treading warily in&nbsp;the ſteps oi Sir lſaac Newton in another route, has&nbsp;diſcovered a genuine and unexceptionable theory, the&nbsp;proceſs of inveſtigation is ſo intricate, requiring every&nbsp;fineffe of the moſt abſtruſe analyfis, and the final equations aie ſo complicated, that even their moſt expert&nbsp;author has not been able to deduce more than one-fimple propofition (which too was diſcovered by Daniel Bernoulli by a more fimple proceſs) which can be&nbsp;applied to any uſe. The hypothetical theory of Newton, therefore, continues to be the groundwork of all&nbsp;our practical knowledge of the ſubject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">we ſhall therefore lay before our readers a very ſhort view of the theory, and the manner of applying it. we&nbsp;ihall then ſhow its defects (all of which were pointed&nbsp;out by its great author), and give an hiſtorical account&nbsp;of the many attempts which have been made to amend&nbsp;it or to ſubſtitute another: in all which we think it our&nbsp;duty to ſhow, that Sir Iſaac Newton took the lead, and&nbsp;pointed out every path which others have taken, if we&nbsp;except Daniel Bernoulli and d’Alembert ; and we ſhall&nbsp;give an account of the chief ſets of experiments which’&nbsp;have been made on this important ſubject, in the hopes&nbsp;of eſtabliſhing an empirical theory, which may be employed with confidence in the arts of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">we know by experience that force muſt be applied to a body in order that it may move through a fluid,&nbsp;ſuch as air or water ; and that a body projected with&nbsp;any velocity is gradually retarded in its motion, and&nbsp;generally brought to reſt. The analogy of nature&nbsp;makes us imagine that there is a force acting in the&nbsp;oppofite direction, or oppofing the motion, and that&nbsp;this force relides in, or is exerted by, the fluid. And&nbsp;the phenomena referable thoſe which accompany the&nbsp;known refiſtance of active beings, ſuch as animals. Therefore we give to this ſuppoſed force the metaphorical&nbsp;name of Resistance, <sup>,</sup>we alſh know that a fluid in-motion will hurry a ſolid body along with the ſtream,&nbsp;and that it requires force to maintain it in its place.&nbsp;A fimilar analogy makes us ſuppoſe that the fluid exerts&nbsp;force, in the ſame manner as when an active being impels the body before him ; therefore we call this the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">IMPULSION of a Fluid.</span><span class="font2"> And as our knowledge of nature&nbsp;inlorms∙ us that the mutual actions of bodies are in-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
