To their other charges they added that of his having concealed a part of the plunder of Veii, particularly two brazen gates, for his own uſe ; and appointed him a day on which to appear before the people. Camillus, finding the multitude ex-aſperated againſt him upon many accounts, deteſting their ingratitude, reſolved not to wait the ignominy of a trial ; but, embracing his wiſe and children, prepared to depart from Rome. He had already paſſed as far as one of the gates, unattended on his way, and unlamented. There he could ſuppreſs his indignation no longer ; but, turning his face to the capitol, and lifting up his hands to heaven, intreated all the gods that his country might one day be ſenſible of their injuſtice and ingratitude ; and ſo ſaying, he paſſed forward to take refuge at Ardea, where he afterwards learned that he had been fined 1500 aſes by the tribunes at home.</p><p>The Romans indeed ſoon had reaſon to repent their uſage of Camillus ; for now a more formidable enemy than ever they had met with threatened the republic i an inundation of Gauls, leaving their native woods, under the command of one Brennus, waſted every thing with fire and ſword. It is ſaid that one Cceditius, a man of the loweſt rank, pretended to have heard a miraculous voice, which pronounced diſtinctly theſe words: “ Go to the magiſtrates, and tell them that the Gauls draw near.” The meanneſs of the man made his warning deſpiſed ; though, when the event ſhowed the truth of his prediction, Camillus erected a temple to the unknown Deity, and the Romans invented ſor him the name of <hi rend="italic">Aius Locutius.</hi>  Meſſeriger after meſſenger arrived with the news of the progreſs and devaſtations of the Gauls ; but the Romans behaved with as much ſecurity as if it had been impoſſible for them to have felt the effects of their depredations. At laſt envoys arrived at Rome, imploring the aſſiſtance of the republic againſt an army of Gauls, which had made an irruption into Italy, and now beſieged their city. The occaſion of the irruption and ſiege was this: Arunx, one of the chief men of Cluſium in Hetruria, had been guardian to a young lucumo, or lord of a lucumony, and had educated him in his houſe from his infancy. The lu-cumo, as ſoon as he was of an age to feel the force of paſſion, fell in love with his guardian’s wife ; and, upon the firſt diſeovery of their intrigffe, conveyed het away. Arunx endeavoured to obtain reparation for the injury he had received ; but the lucumo, by his intereſt and money, gained over the magiſtrates: ſo that the injured guardian, finding no protectors in Hetruria, reſolved to make his application to the Gauls. The people among all the Celtic nations, to whom he choſe to addreſs himſelf, were the Senones ; and, in order to engage them in his quarrel, he aquaînted them with the great plenty of Italy, and made them taſte of ſome Italian wines. Upon this the Senones reſolved to follow him ; and a numerous army was immediately formed, which paſſing the Alps, under the conduct of their Hetrurian guide, and leaving theCeltæ in Italy unmoleſted, fell upon Umbria, and poſſeſſed themſelves of a’J the country from Ravenna to Pſeenum. They were about ſix years in fettling themſelves in their new acquiſitions, while the Romans were carrying on the ſiege of Veii. At length Arunx brought the Senones before Cluſium, in order to beſiege that place, his wife and her lover having ſhut themſelves up there.</p><p>The ſenate, being, unwilling to engage in an open war with a nation which had never offended them, ſent an embaſſy of three young patricians, all brothers, and of the Fabian family, to bring about an accommodation between the two nations. Theſe ambaſſadors, being arrived at the camp of the Gauls, and conducted into the council, offered the mediation of Rome; and demanded of Brennus, the leader of the Gauls, What injury the Cluſini had done him ; or what pretenſions any people from a remote country could have upon Hetruria ? Brennus anſwered proudly, that his right lay in his ſword, and that all things belonged to the bräve ; but that, without having recourſe to this primitive law of natnre, he had a juſt complaint againſt the Cluſians, who, having more lands than they could cultivate, had refuſed to yield to him thoſe they left untilled : And what other motives had you yourſelves, Romans (ſaid he), to conquer ſo many neighbouring nations ? You have deprived the Sabines, the Albans, the Fidenates, the Æqui, and the Volſei, of the beſt part of their territories. Not that we accuſe you of injuſtice ; but it is evident, that you thought this to be the prime and rrioſt ancient of all laws, to make the weak give way to the ſtrong. Forbear therefore to intereſt yourſelves for the Cluſini, or allow us to take the part of the people you have ſubdued.”</p><p>The Fabii were highly provoked at ſo haughty an anſwer; but, diſſembling their reſentment, deſired leave to gb into the town, under pretence of conferring with the magiſtrates. But they were no ſooner there, than they began to ſtir up the inhabitants to à vigorous defence ; nay, forgetting their character, they put themſelves at the head of the beſieged in a ſally, in which Q. Fabius, the chief of the ambaſſadors, flew with his own hand one of the principal officers of the Gauls. Hereupon Brennus, calling the gods to witneſs the per-fidiouſneſs of the Romans, and their violating the law of nations, immediately broke up the ſiege of Cluſium, and marched leiſurely to Rome, having ſent an herald before him to demand that thoſe ambaſſadors, who had ſo manifeſtly violated the law of nations, ſhould be delivered up to him. The Roman ſenate was. greatly perplexed between their regard for the law of nations and their affection for the Fabii. The wiſeſt of the ſenate thought the demand of the Gauls to be but juſt and reaſonable : however, as it concerned perſons of great conſequence and credit, the conſcript fathers re∙ ferred the affair to the people aſſembled by curiæ. As the Fabian family was very popular, the curiæ were ſo far from coûdemning the three brothers, that, at the next election of military tribunes, they were choſen the</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
