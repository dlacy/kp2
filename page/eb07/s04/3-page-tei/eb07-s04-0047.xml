The kings of France, Portugal, and Gra na&lt;la, were not ashamed to sanction this unhallowed corn pact. The king of Portugal invaded Castille, the king of Granada spread his ravages into Andalusia, and the fate of Ferdinand seemed on the point of being sealed, and his kingdom partitioned among the combined robbers. But dissensions among the confederates, and the want of money, dissolved the league, and saved Spain. The greatest battle which had been fought between the Moors and Chris tians since the mighty African host was destroyed on the plains of Tolosa, took place in October 1340, on the banks of the small river Salado. The Christians under Alfonso of Castille were a very small band compared with the enormous host led by the king of Granada ; but the former gained a brilliant victory, the loss of the Moors having been immense. The consequence was the surrender of several fortresses ; and in the following year the destruction of the Mahommedan fleet was effected by the Christians.</p><p>It is now necessary to mention some circumstances in the history of Navarre, relative to the intimate connection which so long subsisted between that kingdom and France, and which had a material influence on the destinies of Spain. The male line of the house of Sancho Inigo, founder of the sovereignty, having ended in Sancho VI., who died in 1234, leaving no issue, the Navarrese elected as their future king, Thibault, a French prince, and nephew to the de ceased Sancho. Of this monarch we know little beyond an expedition to Palestine, which he undertook along with several princes of France. His two sons, who successively occupied the throne of Navarre, espoused French princesses, and thus an intimate connection with France was establish ed. The relationship between the two kingdoms became still more close when Queen Jeanne gave her hand to Philip the Fair of France. In short, Navarre became a province of France, and for four reigns has no distinct history. In 1328, however, the kingdoms were again separated, though the sovereigns of Navarre were closely related to those of France. Charles II. surnamed the Wicked, ascended the Navarrese throne in 1349, and shortly afterwards married Jeanne, daughter of King John of France. His reign is one of perfidy, intrigue, and dishonourable alliances. Events which belong more immediately to the history of France, led to the arrest of Charles by the French monarch, and his detention in prison for several years. He effected his escape, and again resumed his old practice of intriguing, particularly against the king of France. In 1366 he entered into a league with the celebrated Black Prince of England, for the restoration of Pe dro, surnamed the Cruel, who had been driven from the throne of Castille on account of his many enormities. The expulsion of this detestable monster was the act of an indignant nation, which immediately elevated his bastard brother Enrique, or Henry, count of Trastamara, to the throne of Castille. The exiled king himself appealed in per son to the generosity of the English hero, and the consequence was that the Black Prince led a powerful force across the Pyrenees. In his combined army of English and Normans were some of the flower of English chivalry. Henry made every disposition in his power, resolving to hazard all in a battle. The recollection of the cruelties and oppressions of Pedro’s government were a strong stimulus to his followers, and might have insured success had he only been opposed by Pedro the Cruel and Charles the Wicked; but he had to contend with the victor of Cressy and Poictiers. The battle which decided the fate of the two kings was fought near Logrofio, a few miles south of the Ebro, on the 3d of April 1367. Henry nobly contested the day, as also did his antagonist, who was as brave as he was cruel. The conflict was for a short time desperate, but it terminated in the complete discomfiture of Henry, an event followed by the immediate restoration</p><p>of Pedro to the Castillian throne. His gallant ally had soon reason to regret his connection with a prince equally perfidious, debauched, and bloody. Edward quitted him in disgust, without receiving payment of the sum promised to the English troops. Pedro, no longer overawed by the Black Prince, who was as humane as he was valiant, immediately set about punishing those whom he either knew or suspected of having been zealous in the cause of Henry. His late disgrace had sharpened his naturally keen appetite for blood ; but we pass over the revolting details of the enormities which he committed. They produced their usual effects, the complete alienation of the minds of his subjects from him, and then a conspiracy to put an end to such barbarous tyranny. Henry, who had fled to France, entered Spain with a small force, which, however, soon became augmented to an army. Tyrants have few friends in the hour of adversity, and those who have been bribed by gold or overawed by authority to become their pliant tools, are too easily seduced from their allegiance to be trusted when the day of trial comes. Mohammed V., king of Granada, was induced to take the field in behalf of Pedro ; but it was less to aid his ally than to take advantage of the confusion of the times. Pedro’s army gradually melted away, and he himself, compelled to flee for shelter to a fortress, and nearly deserted by his followers, was there shortly afterwards slain by the hand of Henry. Although, as we have already noticed, this prince was a bastard, yet he quietly ascended the Castillian throne, which he bequeath ed to his posterity.</p><p>For nearly a century after these events took place, the history of Spain presents little or nothing that is remark able. The continued and petty hostilities between the native princes, or between any or all of them and the Moors, merit but slight attention. Henry IV. surnamed the Impotent, ascended the throne of Castille in 1454. The mis conduct of this prince, a frivolous and contemptible de bauchee, produced a conspiracy amongst his turbulent nobles, to resist his weak and flagitious administration. He was formally deposed at Avila, in a very extraordinary manner ; an effigy which represented him being solemnly de graded from the royal dignities, while at the same time his brother Alfonso was proclaimed king of Castille and Leon. Henry was naturally anxious to punish the rebels, but they assumed an attitude too formidable for him. Civil war produced a total relaxation of the laws, and let loose bands of robbers, who pillaged the open country, and not unfrequently attacked and plundered the towns. In the midst of these troubles the Infante Alfonso died, an event for the present highly favourable to the king. Some attempts to raise the lnfanta Isabella, his sister, to the throne, proved at first abortive ; but she was the person upon whom the nobles had set their eyes as the only legitimate successor to Henry. In 1469 was laid the foundation of a union which was to prove of such unbounded advantage to Spain. Juan II. of Aragon solicited the hand of Isabella of Castille for his son and heir Don Ferdinand, king of Sicily. By distributing largesses amongst the Castillian nobles, and firmly attaching the archbishop of Toledo to his interest, Juan succeeded in his object. On the 25th of October 1469, the royal pair received the nuptial benediction in the cathedral of Valladolid. The negociations had been secretly conducted, and the whole affair was brought to a conclusion without the knowledge of Henry or his queen, a princess as licentious as himself. She had borne a daughter, the Infanta Juana, whom the whole kingdom supposed, on pretty good grounds, to be the fruit of her intrigue with Don Beltran de la Cueva, count of Ledesma, one of Henry’s favourites. No sooner was Henry made acquainted with this precipitate marriage, than he resolved to leave no measure untried for securing the crown to Juana. He caused her to be proclaimed heir ess of his dominions, and in his last will declared her his suc</p></body></text></TEI>
