the celebrated Greek tragic poet, the ſon of Sophilus an Athenian, was born at Colonn, and educated with great attention. Superior vigour and addreſs in the exerciſes of the paleſtra, and ſkill in muſic, were the great accompliſhments of young men in the ſtates of Greece. In theſe, Sophocles excelled ; nor was he leſs diſtinguiſhed by the beauty of his perſon. He was alſo inſtructed in the nobleſt of all ſciences, civil, polity and religion ; from the firſt of theſe he derived an unſhaken love of his country, which he ſerved in ſome embaſſies, and in high military command with Pericles ; from the latter he was impreſſed with a pious reverence for the gods, manifeſted by the inviolable integrity of his life. But his ſtudies were early devoted to the tragic muſe ; the ſpirit of Eſchylus lent a fire to his genius, and excited that noble emulation which led him to contend with, and ſometimes to bear away the prize from, his great maſter. He wrote 43 tragedies, of which 7 only have eſcaped the ravages of time : and having teſtified his love of his country by refuſing to leave it, though invited by many kings ; and having enjoyed the uninterrupted eſteem and affection of his fellow-citizens, which neither the gallant actions and ſublime genius of Eſchylus, nor the tender ſpirit and philoſophic virtue of Euripides, could ſecure to them, he died in the 91st year of his age, about 406 years before Christ. The burial-place of his anceſtors was at Decelia, which the Lacedemonians had at that time ſeized and fortified ; but Lyſander, the Spartan chief, permitted the Athenians to inter their deceaſed poet ; and they paid him all the honours due to his love ol his country, integrity of life, and high poetic excellence. Eſchylus had at once ſeized the higheſt poſt of honour in the field of poetry, the true ſublime ; to that eminence his claim could not be diſputed. Sophocles had a noble elevation of mind, but tempered with ſo fine a taſte, and ſo chaſtened a judgment, that he never paſſed the bounds of propriety. Under his conduct the tragic muſe appeared with the chaſte dignity of ſome noble matron at a religious ſolemnſty ; harmony is ira her voice, and grace in all her motions. From him the theatre received ſome additional embelliſhments ; and the drama the introduction of a third ſpeaker, which made it more active and more intereſting: but his diſtinguiſhed excellence is in the judicious dispoſition of the fable, and ſo nice a connection and dependence of the parts on each other, that they all agree to make the event not only probable, but even neceſſary. This is peculiarly admirable in his “ Œdipus King of Thebes ;” and in this important point he is far ſuperior to every other dramatic writer.</p><p>The ingratitude of the children of Sophocles is well known. They wiſhed to become immediate maſters of their father’s poſſeſſions; and. therefore tired of his long life, they accuſed him before the Areopagus of inſanity. The only defence the poet made was to read his tragedy of Œdipus at Colonos, which he had lately finiſhed ; and then he aſked his judges, whether the au-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0614.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0608"/>
thor of ſuch a performance could be taxed with inſanity ? The father upon this was acquitted, and the children returned home covered with ſhame and confuſion. The ſeven tragedies of Sophocles which ſtill remain, together with the Greek Scholia which accompany them, have been tranſlated into Latin by Johnſon, and into Engliſh by Dr Franklin and Mr Potter.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
