a genus of precious ſtones, of a blue colour, and the hardeſt of all except the ruby and diamond. They are found in the ſame countries with the ruby; alſo in Bohemia, Alſace, Siberia, and Auvergne. M. Rome de l’Iſle mentions one found at Auvergne, which appeared quite green or blue according to the poſition in which it was viewed. Cronſtedt, however, informs us, that the blue fluor ſpars are frequently met with in collections under the name of <hi rend="italic">ſapphires;</hi> and it is certain from Pliny, B. 37. chap. 9. that the ſapphire of the ancients was our lapis lazuli. They are ſeldom found of a deep blue colour throughout, or free from parallel veins; and when they are but ſlightly tinged, they are named <hi rend="italic">white ſapphires.</hi> The late unfortunate king of France had one with a ſtripe of fine yellow topaz in the middle. Some are found half green and half red, and are foliated like the ruby. The fine hard ſapphires, called by the jewellers <hi rend="italic">oriental,</hi> are of the ſame nature with the ruby and topaz, excepting the mere circumſtance of colour. They are commonly in two oblong hexagon pyramids, joined at their baſe, and pointed at top; ſometimes alſo in hexagonal columns.</p><p>The fineſt ſapphires, like moſt of the gems, come from the Eaſt Indies. Ruſſia does not produce the ſapphire. In Scotland they are found of a hardneſs and luſtre equal to the oriental, both light and deep coloured, at Benachie, and Invercauld, Aberdeenſhire; Portſoy in Banffſhire, and many other places. Mr Deuchar, ſeal-engraver in Edinburgh, has in his poſſeſſion a beautiful ſapphire, which was found in a double cryſtal. On one of theſe is cut a head, which was effected with the greateſt difficulty, on account of its hardneſs; the other is cut into facets, and has a fine water, and great brilliancy.</p><p>The ſpecific gravity of theſe precious ſtones, according to Bergman, is from 3, 650 to 3, 940. According to others the ſpecific gravity of the oriental ſapphires is 3, 994; that of the Braſilian 3, 1307; and of thoſe from Puy in Auvergne, 4, 0769. When powdered, they are fuſible with borax, or microcoſmic ſalt, into a tranſparent glaſs; and the ſame thing happens on treating them with magneſia alba. They are ſaid to loſe their colour by fire, and to become ſo hard and tranſparent as ſometimes to paſs for diamonds; but Mr Achard found this to be a miſtake, and that the true ſapphires are not in the leaſt altered either in colour, hardneſs, or weight, by the moſt intenſe fire. Thoſe of Puy in Auvergne, however, though by their colour and hardneſs they ſeem to approach the oriental ſapphires, loſe both their colour and tranſparency in the fire, becoming black, and even vitrifying, which plainly ſhows them to be of a different kind. Engeſtroom informs us, that the ſapphires, in their rough or native ſtate, generally cryſtallize in two oblong hexagonal pyramids pointed at top,</p><p>and joined at their baſes, but are ſometimes found of an hexagonal or columnar form. —A good ſapphire of ten carats is valued at 50 guineas; if it weighs 20 carats, it is valued at 200 guineas; and, if under ten carats, its value may be found by multiplying the carat at 10s. 6d. by the ſquare of its weight. —Sapphires are preferable to common rubies for jewelling watches, on account of the homogeneous hardneſs of their ſubſtance; ſome red ſtones reſembling rubies being met with, which are not uniformly hard.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
