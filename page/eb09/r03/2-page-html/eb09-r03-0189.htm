<p><span class="font2">present the flaps found on the tail of other forms. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pedalion </span><span class="font2">also has a small ciliated muscular process (fig. 3, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">g)</span><span class="font2"> placed&nbsp;immediately below the mouth, and termed a “ chin,” which&nbsp;appears to be merely a greater development of a sort of&nbsp;lower lip which occurs in many Rotifers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Muscular System.—</span><span class="font1"> All the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font1"> present a muscular system which is generally very well developed. Transverse striation occurs&nbsp;among the fibres to a varying extent, being well marked in cases&nbsp;where the muscle is much used. The muscles which move the&nbsp;body as a whole are arranged as circular and longitudinal series,&nbsp;but they are arranged in special groups and do not form a complete layer of the body-wall as in the various worms. Some of the&nbsp;longitudinal muscles are specially developed in connexion with the&nbsp;tail or pedicle. Other muscles are developed in connexion with&nbsp;special systems of organs,—the trochal disks, the jaw apparatus,&nbsp;and the reproductive system. The muscles in connexion with the&nbsp;trochal disκ serve to protrude or withdraw it, and to move it about,&nbsp;when extruded, in various directions. The protrusion is probably,&nbsp;however, generally effected by the elasticity of the integument&nbsp;coming into play during the relaxation of the retractor muscles, and&nbsp;by a general contraction of the body wall. The tentaculiferous&nbsp;apparatus of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Polyzoa</span><span class="font1"> aud </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gephyrca</span><span class="font1"> is protruded in the same manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trochal Disk.—</span><span class="font1">This structure is the peculiar characteristic of the class. It is homologous with the ciliated bands of the larvæ&nbsp;of Echinoderms, Chietopods, Molluscs, &amp;c., and with the tentaculiferous apparatus of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Polyzoa</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gcphyrea,</span><span class="font1"> and has been termed&nbsp;in common with these a “velum.” This velum presents itself in&nbsp;various stages of complexity. It is found as a single circum-oral&nbsp;ring </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(pilulium),</span><span class="font1"> as a single præ-oral ring (Chætopod larvæ), or as&nbsp;a single præ-oral ring coexisting with one or more post-oral rings&nbsp;(Chætopod larvæ, Holothurian larvæ). We may here assume that&nbsp;the ancestral condition was a single circum-oral ring associated&nbsp;with a terminal mouth and the absence of an anus, and that the existence of other rings posterior to this is an expression of metameric&nbsp;segmentation, Ce., a repetition of similar parts. With the development of a prostomiate condition a certain change necessarily takes&nbsp;place in the position of this baud: a portion of it comes to lie&nbsp;longitudinally; but it may still remain a single band, as in the&nbsp;larva of many Echinodenns. Howhave the other above-mentioned&nbsp;conditions of the velum come about ? How has the præ-oral band&nbsp;been developed ? Two views have been held with regard to this&nbsp;question. According to the one view, the fact whether the single&nbsp;band is a præ-oral or a post-oral one depends upon the position in&nbsp;which the anus is about to develop. H' the anus develops in such&nbsp;a position that mouth and anus lie on one and the same side of the&nbsp;band, the latter becomes præ-oral ; if, however, the anus develops&nbsp;so that the mouth and anus lie upon opposite sides of the band,&nbsp;the band becomes post-oral. If we hold this view we must consider&nbsp;any second band, whether præ- or post-oral, to arise as a new&nbsp;development. The other view premises that the anus always forms&nbsp;so as to leave the primitive ring or “architroch” post-oral, i.e.,&nbsp;between mouth and anus. Concurrently with the development of&nbsp;a prostomium this architroch somewhat changes its position and&nbsp;the two lateral portions come to lie longitudinally ; these may be&nbsp;supposed to have met in the median dorsal line and to have&nbsp;coalesced so as to leave two rings—the one præ-oral (a “ cephalo-troch”), the other post-oral (a “branchiotroch”); this latter may&nbsp;atrophy, leaving the single præ-oral ring, or it may become further&nbsp;developed and thrown into more or less elaborate folds. The existing condition of the trochal disk or velum in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font1"> seems to&nbsp;the writer of this article to bear out the latter view as to the way&nbsp;in which modifications of the velum ιfiay have come about.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In its simplest condition it forms a single circum-oral ring, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Microcodon</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 1, d). The structures at the sides of the mouth&nbsp;in this form are stated to be bristles, and have therefore nothing&nbsp;to do with the velum (fig. 4, a, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ρ).</span><span class="font1"> This simple ring may become&nbsp;thrown into folds, so forming a series of processes standing up&nbsp;around the mouth; this is the condition in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stephanoeeros</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 4, b,fi).&nbsp;There are, however, but few forms presenting this simple condition ; and it must be remembered that the evidence for the assumption here made, that this is a persistent architroch and not a branchiotroch persisting where a Cephalotroch has vanished, is not at&nbsp;present conclusive. This band, may, while remaining single and&nbsp;perfectly continuous, become prolonged around a lobe overhanging&nbsp;the mouth—a prostomium. This condition occurs in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philodina&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(fig. </span><span class="font0">4, E, F, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">p);</span><span class="font1"> the two sides of the post-oral ring do not meet&nbsp;dorsally, but are carried up and are continuous with the row of&nbsp;cilia lining the “wheels.” There is thus one continuous ciliated&nbsp;band, a portion of which runs up in front of the mouth. This&nbsp;condition corresponds to that of the Auricularian larva. The folding of the band has become already somewhat complicated ; <sup>F</sup>a&nbsp;hypothetical intermediate condition is shown in fig. 4, </span><span class="font2">c, </span><span class="font1">D. The&nbsp;next stage in the advancing complexity is that the prostomial portion of the band (fig. 4, </span><span class="font0">G, H, </span><span class="font1">p) becomes separated as a distinct&nbsp;ring, a Cephalotroch ; we find such a stage in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Laeinularia</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 4,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">G, H), where both Cephalotroch and branchiotroch remain fairly simple in shape. In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mclieerta</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 4, ι, j) both Cephalotroch and&nbsp;branchiotroch are thrown into folds. Lastly, we find that in such&nbsp;forms as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Braxhionus</span><span class="font1"> the Cephalotroch becomes first convoluted and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">then discontinuous (fig. 4, κ, L, c), and further it may become so reduced as to be represented only by a few isolated tufts, as in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Asplanchna</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 1, l, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font1"> and x'); in such a form as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lindia</span><span class="font1"> (fig. </span><span class="font2">6, c)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the branchiotroch has vanished and the Cephalotroch has become&nbsp;reduced to the two small patches at the sides of the head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The trochal apparatus serves the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font1"> as a locomotive organ and to bring the food particles to the mouth ; the cilia work so as&nbsp;to produce currents towards the mouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digestive System.—</span><span class="font1">This consists of the following regions:—(1) the oral cavity ; (2) the pharynx ; (3) the oesophagus ; (4) the&nbsp;stomach ; (5) the intestine, which terminates in an anus. The&nbsp;anus is absent in one group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pharynx contains the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mastax</span><span class="font1"> with its teeth ; these are calcareous structures, and are known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trop&gt;hi.</span><span class="font1"> In a typical&nbsp;mastax (8, 9) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Bra-</span></p>
