<p><span class="font1">been charged by Sigismondo to watch over Isotta, and therefore not only acted as her amanuensis, but also wrote&nbsp;privately to explain or confirm that which she had&nbsp;already written to him by Isotta’s wish. For the tyrant&nbsp;of Rimini was of a brutally jealous nature. At any rate&nbsp;the second letter solves the doubts suggested by the first.&nbsp;Nor is it at all surprising that Isotta should have her&nbsp;letters written and signed by another hand, when such was&nbsp;by no means an uncommon practice among the princes&nbsp;and nobilities of her day. Lucrezia Borgia, for instance,&nbsp;frequently did the same. It is besides simply incredible&nbsp;that a woman of the Italian Renaissance, of Isotta’s&nbsp;birth, standing, and reputation, should have been unable to&nbsp;write.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Her marriage with Malatesta did not take place until 1456 ; but of the ardent affection that had long bound&nbsp;them together there are stronger proofs than the lover’s&nbsp;juvenile verses, or than even the children Isotta had borne&nbsp;to him. For, more than all else, the temple of St Francis&nbsp;has served to transmit to posterity the history of their&nbsp;loves. Malatesta decided on building this remarkable&nbsp;church as a thankoffering for his safety during a dangerous campaign undertaken for Pope Eugenius IV. about&nbsp;the year 1445.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first stone was laid in 1446, and the work was carried on with so much alacrity that mass was performed in it by the close of 1450.&nbsp;Sigismondo entrusted the execution of his plans to L. B. Alberti,&nbsp;who had to encase in a shell of classic architecture a 13th-century&nbsp;Franciscan church. The original edifice being left intact, it was&nbsp;a difficult question how to deal with the windows and the Gothic&nbsp;arches of the interior. Alberti solved the problem with marvellous skill, blending the old architecture with the new style of the&nbsp;Renaissance, and giving it variety without destroying its unity of&nbsp;effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Being eager to adorn his temple with the most precious marbles, Sigismondo’s veneration for antiquity did not prevent him from&nbsp;pillaging many valuable classical remains in Rimini, Ravenna, and&nbsp;even in Greece. Such was the zeal with which Alberti pursued&nbsp;his task that the exterior of the little Rimini church is one of the&nbsp;finest and purest achievements of the Renaissance, and surpasses&nbsp;in beauty and elegance all the rest of his works. But it is much&nbsp;to be deplored that he should have left the upper part of the&nbsp;façade unfinished. Alberti came to Rimini, made his design, saw&nbsp;the work begun, and then left it to be carried out by very skilful&nbsp;artists, on whom he impressed the necessity of faithfully preserving its general character so as “not to spoil that music.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The internal decorations, especially the enormous quantity of wall ornaments, consisting chiefly of scrolls and bas-reliefs, were&nbsp;executed by different sculptors under the personal direction of&nbsp;Malatesta, who, even when engaged in war, sent continual instructions about their work. It is difficult to give an exact idea of&nbsp;this extraordinary church to those who have no personal acquaintance with it. The vault was never finished, and still shows its&nbsp;rough beams and rafters. The eight side chapels alone are complete, and their pointed arches spring from Renaissance pilasters&nbsp;planted on black marble elephants, the Malatesta emblems, or on&nbsp;baskets of fruit held by children. The surface of the pilasters is&nbsp;divided into compartments encrusted with bas-reliefs of various&nbsp;subjects and styles. Everywhere—on the balustrades closing the&nbsp;chapels, round the base of the pilasters, along the walls, beneath&nbsp;the cornice of both the exterior and the interior of the church—there&nbsp;is one ornament that is perpetually repeated, the interwoven initials&nbsp;of Sigismondo and Isotta. This monogram is alternated with&nbsp;the portrait and arms of Malatesta ; and these designs are&nbsp;enwreathed. by festoons linked together by the tyrant’s second&nbsp;emblem, the rose. The most singular and characteristic feature&nbsp;of this edifice is the almost total absence of every sacred emblem.&nbsp;Rather than to St Francis and the God of the Christians it was&nbsp;dedicated—and that while Sigismondo’s second wife still lived—&nbsp;to the glorification of an unhallowed attachment. Nature, science,&nbsp;and antiquity were summoned to celebrate the tyrant’s love for&nbsp;Isotta. The bas-reliefs of one of the chapels represent Jupiter,&nbsp;Venus, Saturn, Mars, and Diana, together with the signs of the&nbsp;zodiac. And these subjects are derived, it appears, from a poem&nbsp;in which Sigismondo had invoked the gods and the signs of the&nbsp;zodiac to soften Isotta’s heart and win her to his arms. The&nbsp;pageants of Mars and Diana seem to have been suggested by the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trionfi</span><span class="font0"> of Petrarch. Elsewhere we see prophets and sibyls, personifications of tho theological virtues and of the sciences. The&nbsp;delicate bas-reliefs of botany and medicine, history and astronomy,&nbsp;have been judged by some writers to be Grecian, on account of the&nbsp;ancient appearance of their marble, their inscriptions in Greek and&nbsp;Latin, ami others that have never been deciphered. But a moment’s&nbsp;examination of the sculptures is enough to destroy this hypothesis.&nbsp;Besides, some of tho inscriptions are very easily read and record&nbsp;“Apollo Ariminæus” and “Jupiter Ariminæus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the first chapel on the left is the family tomb of the Malatesta, with sculptured records of their triumphs and of their alleged&nbsp;descent from Scipio Africanus. Better worthy of notice is the third&nbsp;chapel to the right, known as that of the Angels, on account of the&nbsp;angels and children carved on its pillars. It is nominally dedicated&nbsp;to the archangel Michael, whose statue is enshrined in it ; but the&nbsp;figure has the face of Isotta, the ruling deity of this portion of the&nbsp;church. For here is the splendid and fantastic tomb erected to&nbsp;this lady, during her life and previous to the death of Sigismondo’s&nbsp;second wife. No monument, be it remarked, is raised over tho&nbsp;burial-place of Ginevra and Polissena. The urn of Isotta’s sarcophagus is supported by two elephants, and bears the inscription,&nbsp;“D. Isottæ Arimincnsi B. M. Sacrum, MCCCCL.” The “D.”&nbsp;has been generally interpreted as “Divæ” and the “ B. M.” as&nbsp;“ Beatæ Memoriæ. ” But some, unwilling to credit such profanity,&nbsp;allege that the letters stand for “ Bonæ Memoriæ.” Nevertheless&nbsp;all who have seen the church must admit the improbability of similar scruples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The numerous artists employed on the interior of tho church were under the direction of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proto-maestro</span><span class="font0"> Matteo de Pasti, tho&nbsp;celebrated medallist. And indeed the peculiar and fantastic&nbsp;character of the sculptures in this chapel frequently recalls the&nbsp;designs of his famous λvorks. All this decoration is in strange contrast with the grandly austere simplicity of the façade and outer&nbsp;walls of tho church. There no ornament disturbs the harmony of&nbsp;the lines. The frieze beneath the cornice, reproducing the lovers’&nbsp;initials and the Malatestian ensigns, is in such very low relief that&nbsp;it only enhances the perfection of “ that music ” produced by the&nbsp;marvellous skill of Leo Battista Alberti. Also the colour of the&nbsp;stone, a soft creamy white, adds to the general beauty of effect.&nbsp;And everything both within and without contributes to the profane&nbsp;and pagan character which it was Sigismondo’s purpose to impress&nbsp;on the Christian church. On each of its outer walls are seven&nbsp;arched recesses, intended to contain the ashes of the first literati&nbsp;and scientists of his court. In the first, to the right, is the urn of&nbsp;the poet Basinio, one of his pensioners, in the second that of Giusto&nbsp;de’ Conti, author of some rhymes on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bella Mano,</span><span class="font0"> while the&nbsp;third bore the more famous name of Gemisthus Pletho. This well-known Byzantine philosopher was the diffuser of Platonism in&nbsp;Florence during the time of Cosimo de’ Medici, and had faith in&nbsp;the revival of paganism. Returning to his own people, he had&nbsp;died in tho Morea. Sigismondo, having gone there in command&nbsp;of the Venetian expedition against the Turks, exhumed the philosopher’s bones as holy relics, and brought them to Rimini for&nbsp;worthy sepulture in his Christian pantheon. All this is solemnly&nbsp;recorded in tho inscription, which is dated 1465. The fourth&nbsp;sarcophagus was that of Roberto Valturio, the engineer, author of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dc Re Militari,</span><span class="font0"> who had been Sigismondo’s minister and had aided&nbsp;him in the construction of the castle of Rimini. The other urns on&nbsp;this side were placed by Malatesta’s successors, and the arches on&nbsp;the left wall remained untenanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sigismondo understood the science of fortification. He w<sup>τ</sup>as also the first to discard the use of wooden bomb&nbsp;shells, and substitute others cast in bronze. As a soldier&nbsp;his numerous campaigns had shown him to be possessed of&nbsp;all the best qualities and worst defects of the free captains&nbsp;of his time. He began his military career in 1432 in the&nbsp;service of Eugenius IV. ; but, when this pope doubted his&nbsp;good faith and transferred the command to another, he&nbsp;sided with the Venetians against him, though at a later date&nbsp;he again served under him. On the decease of Filippo&nbsp;Maria Visconti in 1447, he joined the Aragonese against&nbsp;Venice and Florence, but, presently changing his flag,&nbsp;fought valiantly against Alphonso of Aragon and forced&nbsp;him to raise the siege of Piombino. In 1454 he accepted&nbsp;a command from the Sienese, but suddenly, after his&nbsp;usual fashion, he made peace with the enemies of the&nbsp;republic, and had to save himself by flight from arrest&nbsp;for his perfidy. It was then that the letters from Isotta&nbsp;were confiscated. After this he began scheming to hasten&nbsp;the coming of the Angevins, and took part in new and&nbsp;more hazardous campaigns against adversaries such as the&nbsp;duke of Urbino, Sforza of Milan, Piccinino, and, worst&nbsp;of all, the Sienese pope, Pius IL, his declared and&nbsp;mortal foe. This time Sigismondo had blundered ; for&nbsp;the cause of Anjou was hopelessly ruined in Italy. Ho</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
