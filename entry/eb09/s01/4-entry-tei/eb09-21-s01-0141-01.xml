 (1613-1681), a figure of some prominence in the literary annals of PoRT <hi rend="smallcaps">Royal</hi> (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>), and after the death of St Cyran (1643) and Singlin (1664) the leading confessor and “director” of the Jansenists in France, was born in Paris on 29th March 1613. He was closely connected with the Arnauld family, his true surname being Le Maître and that of Saci or Sacy which he afterwards assumed a mere anagram of Isaac, his Christian name. He studied philosophy and belles lettres at the Collége de Calvi-Sorbonne, and afterwards, under the influence of St Cyran (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Duvergier de Hauranne),</hi> his spiritual director, joined his eldest brother Antoine Le Maître at Port Royal des Champs. Here he threw himself heartily into the life of the place, devoting himself specially to teaching and the preparation of school-books, his chief productions in this class being expurgated editions of Martial and Terence and a translation of Phædrus. In 1650 he was ordained to the priesthood, and in 1654 he entered the field of theological controversy with a brochure entitled <hi rend="italic">Enluminures de l’Almanach des Jésuites intitulé la Déroute et la Confusion des Jansénistes,</hi> of which it is enough to say that, if the Jesuit attack was in execrable taste, neither was the reply in keeping with the finer ethical tone of Port Royal. From 1661, after the breaking up of the Petites Écoles, he lived more or less in concealment in Paris until May 1666, when he was thrown into the Bastille, where he remained till November 1668. During his imprisonment he occupied himself with the completion of a new version of the New Testament, known as the <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Testament de Mons</hi> (1667), and the remainder of his life was largely devoted to a similar translation of the Old Testament, based chiefly on the Vulgate, with <hi rend="italic">Éclaircissements.</hi> These began to appear in 1672 and were continued down to the end of the minor prophets. As De Sacy knew nothing of Hebrew, this version is of no value as a contribution to scholarship, and in style it is more artificial and laboured than those which had preceded it. From 1668 till his death on 4th January 1684 he lived partly in Paris, partly at Port Royal des Champs, and partly at Pomponne, the seat of his cousin, the marquis de Pomponne. He was buried at Port Royal des Champs.</p><p>In addition to the works already mentioned, he published, under</p></div> In 1815 he became rector of the university of Paris, and after the second restoration he was active on the commission of public instruction. Of the <hi rend="italic">Société Asiatique</hi> he was one of the founders, and when he was inspector of Oriental types at the royal printing press he thought it his duty to read a proof of every book printed in Arabic and Persian. With this he maintained a vast correspondence and was accessible not only to every one who sought his advice on matters of learning and business but to all the poor of his quarter, who came to him as a member of the <hi rend="italic">bureau</hi> of charity. Yet he was neither monk nor hermit: he enjoyed society and was happy in forty-eight years of married life and in the care of a large family. Though small and to appearance of delicate frame, De Sacy enjoyed unbroken health and worked on without sign of failing powers till two days before his death (21st February 1838), when he suddenly fell down in the street and never rallied.<pb facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0160.jp2" xml:id="eb09-21-s01-0142"/>
