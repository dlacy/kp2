<p><span class="font2">not unaptly denominate both the kinds of energies in queſtion, by the terms </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">emphafis of fenſe,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tmphafis of&nbsp;forte(c}.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now from the above account of tbeſe two ſpecies of emphaſis it will appear, &quot; that in reading, as in ſpeak-ing, tlie ſirſt of them muſt be determined entirely by&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſenſe</span><span class="font2"> of the paffage, and always made </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">alike :</span><span class="font2"> But as&nbsp;to the other, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tafle</span><span class="font2"> alone ſeems to have a right of fixing&nbsp;its ſituation and quantity.”—Farther : Since the more&nbsp;effential of theſe two energies is ſolely the work of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">na-tore</span><span class="font2"> (as appears by its being </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coηfiaηtly</span><span class="font2"> found in the&nbsp;common converſation of people of all kinds ot capacities and degrees of knowledge), and the moft ignorant&nbsp;perfon never fails of ufing it </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rightly</span><span class="font2"> in the effuſions of&nbsp;his own heart, it happens very luckily, and ought always to be remembered, that provided we underſtand&nbsp;what we read, and give way io the dictates of our own&nbsp;feeling, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">emphafis of ſenfe</span><span class="font2"> can fearce ever avoid falling ſpontaneouſly upon its proper place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Here it will be neceffary to ſay ſomething by way of reply to a queſtion which will naturally occur to the&nbsp;mind of every one. As the rule for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">emphafis</span><span class="font2"> of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſenſe&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">requires we ſhould underſtand what we read before it&nbsp;can be properly uſed, it is incumbent upon us never to&nbsp;attempt to read what we have not previouſly ſtudied&nbsp;for that purpoſe ? In anfwer to this, it muſt be obſer-ved, that though ſuch a ſtep will not be without its&nbsp;advantages ; yet, as ſrom the fairnefs of printed types,&nbsp;the well-known pauſes of punctuation, and a long ac-quaintance with the phraſeology and conſtruction of our&nbsp;language, &amp;c. experience tells us it is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pojfible</span><span class="font2"> to comprehend the fenſe at the firſt reading, a previous peruſal&nbsp;of what is to be read does not ſeem </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">neceffary</span><span class="font2"> to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">all,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">though, if they would wiſſi to appear to advantage, it&nbsp;may be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">expedient</span><span class="font2"> to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">many ;</span><span class="font2"> and it is this circumſtance</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">which makes us venture upon extemporary reading, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2">give it a place among our arouſements.—Similar re-marks might be made with regard to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">modulation, expreſfion,</span><span class="font2"> &amp;c. did not what is here obſerved naturally anticipate them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">III. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Modulation </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(d). Every perſon muſt have obſerved, that, in ſpeaking,. the voice is ſnbject to an alteration of found, which in ſome meafure reſembles the&nbsp;movement of a tune. Theſe founds, however, are evidently nothing like ſo much varied as thoſe that are&nbsp;ſtrictly mufical ; and we have attempted to ſliow in the&nbsp;preceding chapter, that, befides this, they have an effential difference in themfelves. Nevertheleſs, from the&nbsp;general fimilitude of theſe two articles, they poſiels feveral terms in common; and the particular we have&nbsp;now to examine is in both of them called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">modulation.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">This affection of the voice, being totally </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">arbitrary,</span><span class="font2"> is&nbsp;differently characterized in different parts of the world;&nbsp;and, through the power of cuſtom,,every place is in-cliπed to think their own the only one natural and&nbsp;agreeable, and the reſt affected with ſome barbarous&nbsp;twang or ungainly variation ( e ). It maybe obſerved,&nbsp;however, that though there is a general uniform caſt or&nbsp;faſlrion of modulation peculiar to every country, yet&nbsp;it by no means follows, that there is or can be any&nbsp;thing fixed in its application to particular paffages ; and&nbsp;therefore we find different people will, in any given inſtance, ufe modulations fomething different, and nevertheleſs be each of them equally agreeable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But, quitting thefe general remarks, we ſhall (as our purpoſe requires it) confider the properties of modula -tion a little more minutely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Firſt, then, we may obſerve, that, in ſpeaking, there is a particular found (or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">key-note,</span><span class="font2"> as it is often called)&nbsp;in which the modulation for the moſt part runs, and to</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">(c) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The firſt of thefe terms anſwers to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fimple emphafis</span><span class="font2"> deſcribed in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on Elocution,</span><span class="font2"> and the ſecond&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nearly</span><span class="font2"> to what is there called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">complex.</span><span class="font2"> The difference lies in this. Under </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">complex emphafis</span><span class="font2"> the author ſeems (for&nbsp;he is far from being clear in this article) to include the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tones</span><span class="font2"> fimply confidered of all the eft&gt;otions of the mind ;&nbsp;as well the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tender</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">languid,</span><span class="font2"> as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">forcible</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">exulting,</span><span class="font2"> our term is intended to be confined to ſuch modes </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">expreſſion alone as are marked with an apparent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">firefis</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">increaſe</span><span class="font2"> of the voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(d)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Introduction to the Art oſ Reading,</span><span class="font2"> not allowing that there is any variation of tone, as&nbsp;to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">high</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">low,</span><span class="font2"> in the delivery of a complete period or ſentence, places modulation ſolely in the diverfification of&nbsp;the key-note and the variety of ſyllables, as to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">long</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſhorl, ſwiſt</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">flow, Jtivng</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">weak,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">loud</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Joft.</span><span class="font2"> As&nbsp;we are of a different opinion, our idea of modulation is confined purely to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">harmonious inflexions oſ voice.</span><span class="font2"> Thefe&nbsp;qualities of words, it is true, add greatly both to the force and beauty of delivery ; yet, ſince ſome of them are&nbsp;fixed and not arbitrary (as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">long</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſhort),</span><span class="font2"> and the others (of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſwiſt</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fiοw,firong</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">weak, loud</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſſt),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">may be conſidered as modes of expreſſion which do not affect the modulation as to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tone,</span><span class="font2"> it will agree belt with&nbsp;our plan to eſteem theſe properties as refpectively belonging to the eſtabliſlied laws of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pronunciation</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">imitative</span><span class="font2"> branch of expreſſion mentioned in the end of the enſuing head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(e)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what accounts we have remaining of the modulation of the ancients, it appears to have been highly&nbsp;ornamented, and apparently ſomething not unlike our modern </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">recitative ;</span><span class="font2"> particularly that of their theatric declamation was muſic in its ſtricteſt ſenſe, and accompanied with inſtruments. In the courſe of time and the progreſs of refinement, this modulation became gradually more and more ſimple, till it has now loſt the genius of&nbsp;muſic, and is entirely regulated by taſte. At home here, every one has heard the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fing-fong</span><span class="font2"> cant, as it is&nbsp;called, of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ti ti dum dum, ti ti dum ti dum de,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ti dum ti dum, ti dum ti dum dum de ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">which, though difguſtful now to all but mere rqſtics on account of its being out of ſaſhion, was very probably the favourite modulation in which heroic verſes were recited by our anceſtors. So fluctuating are the taſte and&nbsp;practices of mankind ! But whether the power of language over the paſſions has received any advantage from the&nbsp;change juſt mentioned, will appear at leaſt very </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">doubtful, </span><span class="font2">when w<sup>,</sup>e recollect the ſtories of its former triumphs-,&nbsp;and the inherent charms of muſical founds.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
