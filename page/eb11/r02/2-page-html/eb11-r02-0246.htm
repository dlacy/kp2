<p><span class="font2">RIBEIRA<sub>9</sub> a town of north-western Spain, in the province of Corunna, on the extreme south-west of the peninsula formed&nbsp;between the river of Muros y Noya and Arosa Bay. Pop.&nbsp;(1900) 12,218. Ribeira is in a hilly country, abounding in&nbsp;wheat, wine, fruit, fish and game. Its port is Santa Eugenia&nbsp;de Ribeira, on Arosa Bay. The population is chiefly occupied&nbsp;in agriculture, cattle-breeding and fisheries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIBEIRO<sub>9</sub> BERNARDIM (1482-1552), the father of bucolic prose and verse in Portugal, was a native of Torräo in the&nbsp;Alemtejo. His father, Damiao Ribeiro, was implicated in the&nbsp;conspiracy against King John II. in 1484, and had to flee to&nbsp;Castile, whereupon young Bemardim and his mother took refuge&nbsp;with their relations Antonio Zagalo and D. Ignez Zagalo at&nbsp;the Quinta dos Lobos, near Cintra. When King Manoel came&nbsp;to the throne in 1495, he rehabilitated the families persecuted&nbsp;by his predecessor, and Ribeiro was able to leave his retreat and&nbsp;return to Torrao. Meanwhile D. Ignez had married a rich&nbsp;landowner of Estremoz, and in 1503 she was summoned to&nbsp;court and appointed one of the attendants to the Infanta D.&nbsp;Beatriz. Ribeiro accompanied her, and through her influence&nbsp;the king took him under his protection and sent him to the&nbsp;university of Lisbon, where he studied from 1506 to 1512. When&nbsp;he obtained his degree in law, the king showed him further favour&nbsp;by appointing him to the post of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Escrivao da Camara,</span><span class="font2"> or secretary,&nbsp;and later by bestowing on him the habit of the military order&nbsp;by Sao Thiago. Ribeiro’s poetic career commenced with his&nbsp;coming to court, and his early verses are to be found in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">CaKcioneiro Geral</span><span class="font2"> of Garcia de Resende </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font2"> He took part in&nbsp;the historic </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Seroes do Paqo,</span><span class="font2"> or palace evening 'entertainments,&nbsp;which largely consisted of poetical improvisations; there he met&nbsp;and earned the friendship of the poets Sa de Miranda </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and Christovao Falcao (ç.v.), who became his literary comrades&nbsp;and the confidants of his romance, in which hope deferred and&nbsp;bitter disappointment ended in tragedy. Ribeiro had early&nbsp;conceived a violent passion for his cousin, D. Joanna Zagalo,&nbsp;the daughter of his protectress, D. Ignez; but, though she seems&nbsp;to have returned it, her family opposed her marriage to a singer&nbsp;and dreamer with small means and prospects, and finally&nbsp;compeHed her to wed a rich man, one Pero Gato. When the&nbsp;latter met a violent death shortly afterwards, D. Joanna retired&nbsp;to a house in the country, and it is alleged that Ribeiro visited&nbsp;her, and that their amour resulted in the birth of a child. All we&nbsp;know positively, however, is that in 1521 the lady went into&nbsp;seclusion in the convent of St Clare at Estremoz, where she fell&nbsp;a victim to a violent form of insanity, and that she died there&nbsp;some years later. It is further alleged that Ribeiro’s conduct&nbsp;had caused a scandal which led the king to deprive him of his&nbsp;office and exile him. But the loss of position and income can&nbsp;have added very little to the poignant grief of such a true lover&nbsp;and profound idealist as Bernardim Ribeiro. He had poured&nbsp;out his heart in five beautiful eclogues, the earliest in Portuguese,&nbsp;written in the popular octosyllabic verse; and now, hopeless of&nbsp;the future and broken in spirit, he decided to go to Italy, for a&nbsp;poet the land of promise. He started early in 1522, and travelled&nbsp;widely in the peninsula, and during his stay he wrote his moving&nbsp;knightly and pastoral romance </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menina e Moqa,</span><span class="font2"> · in which he&nbsp;related the story of his unfortunate passion, personifying himself&nbsp;under the anagram of “ Bimnarder,” and D. Ignez under that&nbsp;of “ Aonia.” When he returned home in 1524, the new king,&nbsp;John III., restored him to his former post, and it is said that he&nbsp;paid a last visit to his love at St Clare’s convent and found her&nbsp;in a fit of raving madness. This no doubt preyed on a mind&nbsp;already unhinged by trouble, and hastened the decline of his&nbsp;mental powers, which had already commenced. About 1534 a&nbsp;long illness supervened, and the years that elapsed between that&nbsp;year and his death may be described as the night of his soul.&nbsp;He was quite unable to fulfil the duties of his office, and in 1549&nbsp;the king bestowed upon him a pension for his support; but he&nbsp;did not live long to enjoy it, for in 1552 he died insane in All&nbsp;Saints Hospital in Lisbon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Menina e Moqa</span><span class="font2"> was not printed until after Ribeiro’p death, and then first in Ferrara in 1554. On its appearance&nbsp;the book made such a sensation that its reading was forbidden,&nbsp;because, though it contained nothing heterodox, it disclosed&nbsp;a family tragedy which the allegory could not hide. It is&nbsp;divided into two parts, the first of which is certainly the work&nbsp;of Ribeiro, while as to the second opinion is divided, though&nbsp;Dr Theophilo Braga considers it genuine and explains its&nbsp;progressive lack of lucidity and order by the mental illness&nbsp;of the author. The first part has been ably edited by Dr José&nbsp;Pessanha (Oporto, 1891). Ribeiro’s verses, including his five&nbsp;eclogues, which for their sincerity of feeling, simple diction&nbsp;and chaste form are unsurpassed in Portuguese literature,&nbsp;were reprinted in a limited édition de luxe by Dr Xavier da&nbsp;Cunha (Lisbon, 1886).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RIBERA, GIUSEPPE (1588-1656), commonly called Lo </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Spagnoletto,</span><span class="font2"> or the Little Spaniard, a leading painter of the&nbsp;Neapolitan or partly of the Spanish school, was bom near&nbsp;Valencia in Spain, at Xativa, now&quot; named S. Felipe, on 12th&nbsp;January 1588. His parents intended him for a Hterary or&nbsp;learned career; but he neglected the regular studies, and&nbsp;entered the school of the Spanish painter Francisco Ribalta.&nbsp;Fired with a longing to study art in Italy, he somehow made&nbsp;his way to Rome. Early in the 17th century a cardinal noticed&nbsp;him in the streets of Rome drawing from the frescoes on a&nbsp;palace façade; he took up the ragged StripHng and housed&nbsp;him in his mansion. 'Artists had then already bestowed upon&nbsp;the alien student, who was perpetuaHy copying aU sorts of&nbsp;objects in art and in nature, the nickname of Lo Spagnoletto.&nbsp;In the cardinal’s household Ribera was comfortable but dissatisfied, and one day he decamped. He then betook himself&nbsp;to the famous painter Michelangelo da Caravaggio, the head of&nbsp;the naturaHst school, caUed also·the school of the Tenebrosi,&nbsp;or shadow-painters, owing to the excessive contrasts of light&nbsp;and shade which marked their style. The ItaHan master gave&nbsp;every encouragement to the Spaniard, but not for long, as he&nbsp;died in 1609. Ribera, who had in the first instance studied&nbsp;chiefly from Raphael and the Caracci, had by this time acquired&nbsp;so much mastery over the tenebroso style that his performances&nbsp;were barely distinguishable from Caravaggio’s own. He now&nbsp;went to Parma, and worked after the frescoes of Correggio&nbsp;with great zeal and efficiency: in the museum of Madrid is his&nbsp;“ Jacob’s Ladder,” which is regarded as his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chef-d'œuvre</span><span class="font2"> in&nbsp;this manner. From Parma Spagnoletto returned to Rome,&nbsp;where he resumed the style of Caravaggio, and shortly afterwards he migrated to Naples, which became his permanent 'home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ribera was as yet still poor and inconspicuous, but a rich picture-dealer in Naples soon discerned in him all the stuff of&nbsp;a successful painter, and gave him his daughter in marriage.&nbsp;This was the turning-point in the Spaniard’s fortunes. He&nbsp;painted a “ Martyrdom of St Bartholomew,” which the father-in-law exhibited from his balcony to a rapidly increasing and&nbsp;admiring crowd. The popular excitement grew to so noisy a&nbsp;height as to attract the attention of the Spanish viceroy, the&nbsp;Count de Monterey. From this nobleman and from the king&nbsp;of Spain, Philip IV., commissions now* flowed in upon Ribera.&nbsp;With prosperity came grasping and jealous selfishness. Spagno-Ietto, chief in a triumvirate of greed, the “ Cabal of Naples,”&nbsp;his abettors being a Greek painter, BeHsario Corenzio, and a&nbsp;NeapoHtan, Giambattista Caracciolo, determined that Naples&nbsp;should be an artistic monopoly; by intrigue, terrorizing and&nbsp;personal violence on occasion they kept aloof all competitors.&nbsp;Annibale Caracci, tlie CavaHer d’Arpino, Guido, Domenichino,&nbsp;aU of them successively invited to work in Naples, found the&nbsp;place too hot to hold them. The cabal ended at the time of&nbsp;Caracciolo’s death in 1641.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The close of Ribera’s triumphant career has been variously related. If we are to believe Dominici, the historian of Neapolitan art, he totally disappeared from Naples in 1648 and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
