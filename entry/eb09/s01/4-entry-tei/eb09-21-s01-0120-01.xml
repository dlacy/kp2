                <p><label>S</label> represents the hard open (or fricative) sound produced by
                    bringing the blade of the tongue close to the front palate, immediately behind
                    the gums, or rather, this is the normal position for S, as slight varieties can
                    be produced by bringing the tongue farther back. By the “ blade ” is meant the
                    pointed end of the tongue, not the mere point, which at the same part of the
                    palate produces R. This position differs little from that for TH, into which S
                    passes in a lisping pronunciation ; a larger part of the surface of the tongue
                    is brought near to the palate for TH than for S. The symbol which represents the
                    soft open sound corresponding to S is Z, though in practice S often stands for
                    both.</p>
                <p>The history of our symbol S is easy up to a certain point. It is the rounded form
                    of 5, rounded at a very early period for convenience of writing, for the change
                    is apparent in the old Italian alphabet of Cære, and still more on the recently
                    discovered vase of Formello; and even in the scribbling of the Greeks at Abu
                    Simbel—the oldest, or nearly the oldest, bit of Greek epigraphy—perfectly
                    rounded forms stand side by side with the angular ones. The common Greek form Σ
                    was obtained by adding a fourth stroke, and gradually making the top and bottom
                    ones horizontal. When, however, we wish to identify the Greek symbol of three
                    strokes with its Phoenician counterpart, the difficulty begins. The Phoenicians
                    had four symbols for sibilants, known in Hebrew as Zayin, Samekh, Ṣade, and Shin
                    ; the last of these at a very early date represented two sounds, the English <hi
                        rend="italic">sh,</hi> and another sound which resembled that of Samekh and
                    ultimately became indistinguishable from it, both being pronounced as the
                    English s. The Greeks did not want all these symbols, consequently in different
                    parts of Greece one or other— not the same—Phoenician symbol fell into disuse.
                    One of these, M or N, called San, though lost in Ionic, appears in old Doric
                    inscriptions, as those of Thera, Melos, and Crete, Argos, Corinth, and Corcyra ;
                    but the later Doric form is the usual Sigma ; probably San was too like the
                    nasal M. There is no doubt that in form Zeta represents Zayin, and that Xi
                    represents Samekh. Moreover, Zeta and Zayin stand seventh in the Greek and
                    Phoenician alphabets respectively, and Xi and Samekh each fifteenth. Again, the
                    form of San with three strokes corresponds fairly with Ṣade, and Sigma is
                    moderately like Shin ; but here the evidence of position comes in again to
                    strengthen a somewhat weak case, for in the old Italian alphabets San has the
                    place of Ṣade, the simpler form occurring in the Cære alphabet, the fuller in
                    that of the Formello vase ; in both Sigma (rounded in form) has the place of
                    Shin. These identifications would be certain if the names corresponded as well
                    as the forms ; but they clearly do not : Zeta and Ṣade (not Zayin) seem to hold
                    together in sound, and Sigma (as has often been suggested) looks like a “
                    popular etymology” for Samekh. But the objection from difference of names is not
                    fatal. All names which are thought of habitually in rows or sets tend to be
                    modified under the influence of analogy ; and analogy has certainly been at work
                    here, for Xi, which is a purely Greek name, is, like Psi, and like Chi and Phi,
                    due to the older Pi. Similarly Eta and Theta have probably made Zeta ; but it
                    must be allowed that the metamorphosis of Ṣade is more intelligible (as a matter
                    of sound-change) than that of Zayin. Probably we must have recourse to a
                    different principle to explain at least some part of our difficulty. We may
                    suppose that in some part of Greece the sounds</p>
                <p>denoted originally by Ṣade and Zayin became indistinguishable ; there would then
                    exist for a time one sound but two names. It would be a matter of little moment
                    which name should survive; thus Ṣade (or Zeta) might supersede Zayin, or one
                    name might survive in one district—as San in the Doric, but Sigma in the rest of
                    Greece. This suggestion is made by Dr Taylor <hi rend="italic">(The
                        Alphabet,</hi> ii. 100). The history of the sounds, as well as of the forms,
                    of the Greek sibilants is difficult. Probably Sigma was generally hard—our <hi
                        rend="italic">s</hi> in <hi rend="italic">sign.</hi> But Zeta did not
                    originally denote the corresponding <hi rend="italic">z</hi>: rather it was <hi
                        rend="italic">dz;</hi> some say <hi rend="italic">dj,</hi> as in “John,” but
                    this is not likely. Xi was probably a strong sibilant with a weak guttural, as X
                    was in Latin. If the sound <hi rend="italic">z</hi> existed in Greek, as is
                    probable, it was denoted by Sigma. In Italy, also, we must infer that the soft
                    sibilant was heard too little to need a special symbol, because <hi
                        rend="italic">z</hi>, which exists in the old alphabets of Cære and
                    Formello, was lost early enough to leave a place for the newly-made Italian
                    symbol G. When Z was restored, it was placed at the end of the alphabet and
                    doubtless with the value of Greek Z in the Greek words in which alone it was
                    used. One Latin <hi rend="italic">s—</hi> probably <hi rend="italic">z—</hi>
                    became the trilled <hi rend="italic">r</hi> between two vowels,— <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in "Papirius ” for “ Papisius,” “arboris” for
                    “arbosis.”</p>
                <p>In English the symbol <hi rend="italic">s</hi> alone existed till z was
                    introduced from France with words of French origin, as “zeal,” “ zone.” An
                    attempt was made to employ it at the end of plural nouns, where the sound is
                    regularly heard except when the last sound of the noun is hard, <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g., “</hi> bedz ” (beds), but “hops”; but this was not
                    maintained, nor even consistently done, for the symbol was used even when the
                    sound must have been <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> We regularly write <hi
                        rend="italic">s</hi> for both sounds,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in
                    “lose” and “loose,” “curs” and “curse,” “hers” and “hearse.” When there is a
                    distinction in spelling the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> commonly has the value of
                        <hi rend="italic">z</hi>,— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> “ vies ” and “
                    vice,” “ pays ” and “ pace,” “ his ” and “ hiss.” S has the sound of <hi
                        rend="italic">sh</hi> in “sure,” “sugar,” and some other words ; this is due
                    to the palatal sound heard before the <hi rend="italic">u. Sh,</hi> in spite of
                    its spelling, is a single sound, the position of which differs from that for s
                    only in a slight retraction of the point of the tongue; it is commonly found in
                    English words which originally had <hi rend="italic">sk,—e.g.,</hi> “shall,”
                    O.E. <hi rend="italic">seeal</hi>; “ shabby,” a doublet of “ scabby ” ; “ fish,”
                    O.E. <hi rend="italic">fisk.</hi> The sound is the same as that of French <hi
                        rend="italic">ch</hi> in “ chateau,” “chef,” “sécher,” where it is due to
                    assibilation of original <hi rend="italic">k.</hi></p>
