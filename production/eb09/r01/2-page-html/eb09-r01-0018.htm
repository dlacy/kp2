<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“ Marion pleure, Marion crie,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Marion veut qu’on la marie ”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">is said to have annoyed Racine very much, and it has a most malicious appropriateness. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bajazet,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which was first&nbsp;played on 4th January 1672 (for Racine punctually produced his piece a year), is perhaps better. As a play,&nbsp;technically speaking, it has great merit, but the reproach&nbsp;commonly brought against its author was urged specially&nbsp;and with great force against this by Corneille. It is impossible to imagine anything less Oriental than the atmosphere of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bajazet</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">; the whole thing is not only French but&nbsp;ephemerally French—French of the day and hour; and its&nbsp;ingenious scenario and admirable style scarcely save it.&nbsp;This charge is equally applicable with the same reservations&nbsp;to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mithridate,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which appears to have been produced on&nbsp;13th January 1673, the day after the author’s reception&nbsp;at the Academy. It was extremely popular and, as far&nbsp;as style and perfection in a disputable kind go, Racine&nbsp;could hardly have lodged a more triumphant diploma&nbsp;piece. His next attempt, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iphig'enie,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> was a long step backwards and upwards in the direction of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> It&nbsp;is not that the characters are eminently Greek, but that&nbsp;Greek tragedy gave Racine examples which prevented him&nbsp;from flying in the face of the propriety of character as he&nbsp;had done in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Berenice, Bajazet,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mithridate,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and that he&nbsp;here called in, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> other passions to the aid&nbsp;of the mere sighing and crying which form the sole appeal&nbsp;of these three tragedies. Achilles is a rather pitiful personage, and the grand story of the sacrifice is softened&nbsp;very tamely to suit French tastes; but the parental agonies&nbsp;of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon are truly drawn, and&nbsp;the whole play is full of pathos. It succeeded brilliantly&nbsp;and deservedly, but, oddly enough, the date of its appearance is very uncertain. It was assuredly acted at court&nbsp;in the late summer of 1674, but it does not seem to&nbsp;have been given to the public till the early spring of&nbsp;1675, the usual time at which Racine produced his&nbsp;work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The last and finest of the series of tragedies proper was the most unlucky. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pliedre</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> was represented for the first&nbsp;time on New-Year’s Day 1677 at the Hotel de Bourgogne.&nbsp;Within a week the opposition company or “troupe du roi”&nbsp;launched an opposition </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phédre</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> by Pradon. This singular&nbsp;competition, which had momentous results for Racine, and&nbsp;in which he to some extent paid the penalty of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex&nbsp;talionis</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> for his own rivalry with Corneille, had long been&nbsp;foreseen. It has been hinted that Racine had from the&nbsp;first been bitterly opposed by a clique, whom his great&nbsp;success irritated, while his personal character did nothing to&nbsp;conciliate them. His enemies at this time had the powerful&nbsp;support of the duchess of Bouillon, one of Mazarin’s nieces,&nbsp;a woman of considerable talents and imperious temper, together with her brother the duke of Nevers and divers other&nbsp;personages of high position. These persons of quality,&nbsp;guided, it is said, by Madame Deshouliéres, a poetess of&nbsp;merit whom Boileau unjustly depreciated, selected Pradon,&nbsp;a dramatist of little talent but of much facility, to compose&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phédre</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> in competition with that which it was known&nbsp;that Racine had been elaborating with unusual care.&nbsp;Pradon, perhaps assisted, was equal to the occasion, and it&nbsp;is said that the partisans on both sides did not neglect&nbsp;means for correcting fortune. On her side the duchess&nbsp;of Bouillon is accused of having bought up the front places&nbsp;in both theatres for the first six nights; on his part Racine&nbsp;is said to have repeated an old trick of his and prevailed&nbsp;on the best actresses of the company that played Pradon’s&nbsp;piece to refuse the title part. There is even some ground&nbsp;for believing that Racine endeavoured to prevent the opposition play from being played at all, and that an express&nbsp;order from the king had to be obtained for it. It was of&nbsp;no value, but the measures of the cabal had been so well&nbsp;taken that the finest tragedy of the French classical school&nbsp;was all but driven from the stage, while Pradon’s was a&nbsp;positive success. A war of sonnets and epigrams followed,&nbsp;during which it is said that the duke of Nevers menaced&nbsp;Racine and Boileau with the same treatment which Dryden&nbsp;and Voltaire actually received, and was only deterred by&nbsp;the protection which Conde extended to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The unjust cabal against his piece and the various annoyances to which it gave rise no doubt made a deep&nbsp;impression on Racine. But in the absence of accurate&nbsp;contemporary information it is impossible to decide exactly&nbsp;how much influence they had on the subsequent change in&nbsp;his life. For thirteen years he had been constantly employed on a series of brilliant dramas. He now broke off&nbsp;his dramatic work entirely and in the remaining twenty&nbsp;years of his life wrote but two more plays, and those under&nbsp;special circumstances and of quite a different kind. He&nbsp;had been during his early manhood a libertine in morals&nbsp;and religion; he now married, became irreproachably&nbsp;domestic, and almost ostentatiously devout. No authentic&nbsp;account of this change exists; for that of Louis Racine,&nbsp;which attributes the whole to a sudden religious impulse,&nbsp;is manifestly little more than the theory of a son pious in&nbsp;both senses of the word. Probably all the motives which&nbsp;friends and foes have attributed—weariness of dissipated&nbsp;life, jealousy of his numerous rivals in Mademoiselle de&nbsp;Champmesle’s favour, pique at Pradon’s success, fear of losing still further the position of greatest tragic poet which&nbsp;after Corneille’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Surena</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> was indisputably his, religious sentiment, and so forth—entered more or less into his action.&nbsp;At any rate what is certain is that he reconciled himself&nbsp;with Arnauld and Port Royal generally, and on 1st&nbsp;June married Catherine de Romanet and definitely settled&nbsp;down to a quiet domestic life, alternated with the duties&nbsp;of a courtier. For his repentance was by no means a&nbsp;repentance in sackcloth and ashes. The drama was not&nbsp;then very profitable to dramatists, but Louis Racine tells&nbsp;us that his father had been able to furnish a house, collect&nbsp;a library of some value, and save 6000 livres. His wife&nbsp;had money, and he had possessed for some time (it is not&nbsp;certain how long) the honourable and valuable post of&nbsp;treasurer of France at Moulins. His annual “gratification”&nbsp;had been increased from 800 to 1500 livres, then to 2000,&nbsp;and in the October of the year of his marriage he and&nbsp;Boileau were made historiographers-royal with a salary of&nbsp;2000 crowns. Besides all this he had, though a layman,&nbsp;one or two benefices. It would have been pleasanter if&nbsp;Louis Racine had not told us that his father regarded His&nbsp;Majesty’s choice as “an act of the grace of God to detach&nbsp;him entirely from poetry.” Even after allowing for Louis&nbsp;Racine’s religiosity and the conventional language of all&nbsp;times, there is a flavour of hypocrisy about this which is&nbsp;disagreeable, and has shocked even Racine’s most uncompromising admirers. For the historiographer of Louis&nbsp;XIV. was simply his chief flatterer. Before going further&nbsp;it may be observed that very little came of this historiography. The joint incumbents of the office made some&nbsp;campaigns with the king, sketched plans of histories, and&nbsp;left a certain number of materials and memoirs; but they&nbsp;executed no substantive work. Racine, whether this be&nbsp;set down to his credit or not, was certainly a fortunate&nbsp;and apparently an adroit courtier. His very relapse into&nbsp;Jansenism coincided with his rise at court, where Jansenism was in no favour, and the fact that he had been in the&nbsp;good graces of Madame de Montespan did not deprive him&nbsp;of those of Madame de Maintenon. Neither in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Esther</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> did&nbsp;he hesitate to reflect upon his former patroness. But a&nbsp;reported sneer of the king, who was sharp-eyed enough,&nbsp;“Cavoie avec Racine se croit bel esprit; Racine avec Cavoie</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
