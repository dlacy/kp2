<p><span class="font0">Voigt, founding on a few words in Festus, concludes it must have been by something like pignoris eapio. This recuperatory procedure in time came to be resorted to in some cases even where&nbsp;both parties were citizens. There are numerous instances of it in&nbsp;Cicero ; and it is remarkable that in most of the prætorian actions&nbsp;ex delicto the remit was not to a judex but to recuperators. The&nbsp;explanation may be in the comparative summariness of the remedy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">III. Development of the Substantive Institutions of the Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Citizen and his “ Cαput&quot;—</span><span class="font1">The early law of Rome was essentially personal, not territorial. A man enjoyed&nbsp;the benefit of its institutions and of its protection, not&nbsp;because he happened to be within Roman territory, but&nbsp;because he was a citizen,—one of those by whom and for&nbsp;whom its law was established. The theory of the early&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span class="font1"> was that a man sojourning within the bounds&nbsp;of a foreign state was at the mercy of the latter and its&nbsp;citizens, that he himself might be dealt with as a slave,&nbsp;and all that belonged to him appropriated by the first&nbsp;comer ; for he was outside the pale of the law. Without&nbsp;some sort of alliance with Rome a stranger had no right&nbsp;to claim protection against maltreatment of his person or&nbsp;attempt to deprive him of his property; and even then,&nbsp;unless he belonged to a state entitled by treaty to the international judicial remedy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recuperatio,</span><span class="font1"> it was by an&nbsp;appeal to the good offices of the supreme magistrate, or&nbsp;through the intervention of a citizen to whom he was&nbsp;allied by the (frequently hereditary) bond of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hospitium,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and not by means of any action of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> set in&nbsp;motion by himself. A non-oitizen—originally </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hostis,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;afterwards usually called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">peregrinus</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup>—in time came to be&nbsp;regarded as entitled to all the rights the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span class="font1"> recognized as belonging to a freeman, and to take part as&nbsp;freely as a Roman in any transaction of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">but that was not until Rome, through contact with other&nbsp;nations and the growth of trade and commerce, had found&nbsp;it necessary to modify her jurisprudence by the adoption&nbsp;of many new institutions of a more liberal and less exclusive character than those of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A citizen’s civil personality was technically his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">caput. </span><span class="font1">The extent of it depended on his family status. It was&nbsp;only among citizens that the supremacy of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and the subjection of those </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in manu, potestate,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mαnwpio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">were recognized,—only among them therefore that the position of an individual in the family was of moment. While&nbsp;in public life a man’s supremacy or subjection in the&nbsp;family was immaterial, in private life it was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> alone who enjoyed full jural capacity. Those&nbsp;subject to him had a more limited personality; and, so&nbsp;far as capacity to take part in transactions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was concerned, it was not inherent in them but derived&nbsp;from their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> : they were the agents of his&nbsp;will, representatives of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">persona</span><span class="font1"> in every act whereby&nbsp;a right was acquired by them for the family to which&nbsp;they belonged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Whenever a citizen either ceased altogether to be a member of a Roman family or passed from one family into another, there was technically </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis minutio</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">deminutio,</span><span class="font1"> except in the cases of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiifamilias</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiaefamilias</span><span class="font1"> becoming flamens or vestals ; for, though they changed their family,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">yet it was by passing from a human into a divine one. When a citizen forfeited his freedom, his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was said to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">maxima</span><span class="font1"> ; he lost all capacity, whether under&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> or the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium.</span><span class="font1"> When, retaining freedom,&nbsp;he went into exile or joined a Latin colony, or otherwise&nbsp;became a peregrin, the diminution of his capacity was only&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">media</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minor·,</span><span class="font1"> it was his rights and privileges under&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> that alone were affected. When both freedom and citizenship remained, and no more occurred than&nbsp;the severance of his connexion with a particular family&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(familiae mutatio),</span><span class="font1"> the diminution was said to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minima.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Very simple illustrations present themselves in the case of&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterf amilias</span><span class="font1"> becoming </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> by adrogation, or a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">materfamilias</span><span class="font1"> passing into the hand of a husband by con-far reation or coemption ; in both cases he or she who had&nbsp;been </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris</span><span class="font1"> thereby became </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">alieni juris.</span><span class="font1"> This was descent&nbsp;in the family scale. It almost appears as if some of the&nbsp;later Roman jurists assumed, as do many moderns, that&nbsp;such descent or degradation was essential to the idea of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minutio capitis</span><span class="font1"> ; for Paul accounts for its presence in the&nbsp;case of emancipation—which converted a</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> into&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias,</span><span class="font1"> and thus manifestly improved his status—&nbsp;by the observation that in the process of release from his&nbsp;father’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> a child had to pass, for however brief a&nbsp;period, through a condition of quasi-slavery </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(mancvpium).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">But in reality degradation had nothing to do with it. It&nbsp;was immaterial whether the change was from a higher&nbsp;family position to a lower, or from a lower to a higher,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2&nbsp;</sup>or to the same position in the new family that had been&nbsp;held in the old,—as when a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> was transferred&nbsp;by his father into the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> of an adopter, or when the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiifamilias</span><span class="font1"> of a person giving himself in adrogation passed&nbsp;with him into the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> of the adrogator : in every case&nbsp;there was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis minutio.</span><span class="font1"> It was not the change of family&nbsp;position that caused it, but the change of family itself,—&nbsp;the change from one family to another. The civil personality of Titius while a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jiliusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;Sempronius,—the expectancy of succession, the agnatic&nbsp;relationships, the derivative capacity for being a party&nbsp;to a mancipation or a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sponsio</span><span class="font1"> that resulted from the relationship,—all came to an end through the severance of&nbsp;the family tie. He might acquire a new and independent&nbsp;capacity on becoming </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris</span><span class="font1"> by emancipation, or a new&nbsp;derivative capacity on passing into the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> of Mævius&nbsp;by adoption ; but his old personality </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quoad civilia</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;extinguished. This is what some of the jurists mean when&nbsp;they say that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio</span><span class="font1"> was civil death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most important consequence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minima capitis deminutio</span><span class="font1"> was that it not only extinguished </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas </span><span class="font1">where it existed, but severed the bond of agnation between&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capite minutus</span><span class="font1"> and all those who had previously been&nbsp;related to him as agnates. There was no longer any right&nbsp;of succession between them on intestacy ; their reciprocal&nbsp;prospective rights of tutory were defeated, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minutio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of either tutor or ward put an end to a subsisting guardianship, assuming always that it was a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tutela légitima</span><span class="font1"> or agnatic&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cura furiosi.</span><span class="font1"> Very remarkable, yet quite logical, was the&nbsp;doctrine that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minutio</span><span class="font1"> extinguished the claims of creditors of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minutus</span><span class="font1"> ; their debtor, the person with whom&nbsp;they had contracted, was civilly dead, and dead without&nbsp;an heir, and therefore there was no one against whom an&nbsp;action of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> could be directed in order to enforce&nbsp;payment. But equity eventually provided a remedy, by&nbsp;giving the creditors a prætorian action in which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minutio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was held as rescinded, and which the new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;bound to defend on pain of having to give up all the estate</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> Neither “alien” nor “foreigner” is an adequate rendering of peregrirnιs. For peregrini included not only citizens of other states&nbsp;or colonies, independent or dependent, but also α7r0λtδes,—men who&nbsp;could not call themselves citizens (cives) at all, as, for example, the&nbsp;dediticii whom Rome had vanquished and whose civic organization&nbsp;she had destroyed, offenders sent into banishment, &amp;c. ; and until&nbsp;Caracalla’s general grant of the franchise the greater proportion of her&nbsp;provincial subjects were also spoken of as peregrins. This, though&nbsp;linguistically objectionable, is a safer word than “non-citizen”; for&nbsp;the latter would include the Junian Latins of the early empire, who,&nbsp;though not citizens, yet were not reckoned as peregrini.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> Children who became sui juris by their parent’s death did not change their family ; the change was not in them, but in the disappearance of the family head ; therefore they were not regarded as capite&nbsp;minuti.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
