every case equal and opposite, and that the observed change of motion is the only indication, characteristic, and measure, of the changing force, the forces are the same (whether we call them impulsions or resistances) when the relative motions are the same, and therefore ■depend entirely on these relative motions. The force, therefore, which is necessary for keeping a body immoveable in a stream of water, flowing with a certain velocity, is the same with what is required for moving this body with this velocity through stagnant water. To any one who admits the motion of the earth round the fun, it is evident that we can neither observe nor reason from a case of a body moving through still water, nor of a stream of water pressing upon or impelling a quiescent body. 
A body in motion appears to be resisted by a stag nant fluid, because it is a law of mechanical nature that force must be employed in order to put anybody in motion. Now the body cannot move forward without putting the contiguous fluid in motion, and force must be employed for producing this motion. In like manner, a quiescent body is impelled by a stream of fluid, because the motion of the contiguous fluid is diminished by this solid obstacle; the resistance, therefore, or impulse, no way differs from the ordinary communica tions of motion among solid bodies. 
sir Isaac Newton, therefore, begins his theory of the resistance and impulse of fluids, by selecting 
a 
case where, although lie cannot pretend to ascertain the motions themselves which are produced in the particles of a contiguous fluid, he can tell precisely their mutual ra tios. 
He supposes two systems of bodies such, that each body of the first is similar to a corresponding body of the second, and that each is to each in a constant ratio. He also supposes them to be similarly situated, that is, at the angles of similar figures, and that the homologous lines of these figures are in the same ratio with the dia metres of the bodies. He farther supposes, that they attract or repel each other in similar directions, and that the accelerating connecting forces are alsu proportional;; is, the forces in the one system are to the corresponding forces in tne other system in a eonstant ratio, and that, in each system taken apart, the forces are as the squares of the velocities directly, and as the dia metres of the corresponding bodies, or their distances, inversely. 
this"being the, case, it legitimately follows, that if similar parts of the two systems are put into similar mo tions, in any given instant, they will 
continue 
to move similarly, each correspondent body describing similar curves, with proportional velocities : For the bodies be ingsimilaiiy situated, the forces which act on a body in one system, arising from the combination of any number of adjoining particles, will have the same direction with the force acting on the corresponding body in the other system, arising from the combined action of the similar and similarly directed forces of the adjoining correspondent bodies of the other system; and these compound forces will have the same ratio with the simple forces which constitute them, and will be as rhe squares of the velocities directly, and as the distances, or any homologous lines inversely; and therefore the chords of curvature, having the direction of the centripetal or centrifugal forces, and similarly inclined 
to 
the tangents 
of the curves described by the corresponding boches, will have the same ratio with the distances of the pan tides. The curves described by the corresponding bodies will therefore be simisar, the velocities will be proportional, and the bodies will be similarly situated at the end of the sirst moment, and exposed to the action of similar and similarly situated centripetal or centrifugal forces; and this will again produce similar motions during the next moment, and so on for ever. All this is evident to any person acquainted with the elementary doctrines of curvilineal motions, as delivered in the theory of physical astronomy. 
From this fundamental proposition, it clearly follows, that if two similar bodies, having their homologous lines proportional to those of the two systems, be 
similarly 
projected among the bodies of those two fysteshs with any velocities, they will produce similar.motions in the two systems, and will themselves continue to move similarly; and therefore will, in every subsequent moment, suffer similar diminutions or retardations. It the initial velocities of projection be the same, but the densities of the two systems, that is, the quantities of matter contained in an equal bulk or extent, be different, it is evi dent that the quantities of motion produced in the two systems in the same time will be proportional to the densities; and if the densities are the same, and uniform in each system, the quantities of motion produced will be as the squares of the velocities, because the motion communicated to each corresponding body will be pro portional to the velocity communicated, that is, to the velocity of the impelling body; and the number of similarly situated particles which will be agitated will also be proportional to. this velocity. Therefore, the whole quantities of motion produced in the same moment of time will be proportlonal to the squares of the velocities. And lastly, if the densities of the two sys tems are uniform, or the same through the whole extent of the systems, the number of particles impelled by similar bodies will be as the surfaces of these bodies. 
Now the diminutions of the motions of the projected bodies are (by newton’s third law of motion) equal to the motions produced in the systems; and these diminu tions are the measures of what are called the resistances opposed to the motions of the projected bodies. Therefore, combining all these circumstances, the resistances are proportional to the similar surfaces of the moving bodies, to the densities of the systems through which the motions are performed, and to the squares of the velocities, jointly. 
we cannot form to ourselves any distinct notion of a fluid, otherwise than as a system of small bodies, or a collection of particles, similarly or symmetrically arranged, the centres of each being situated in the angles of regular solids. We rnust form this notion of it, whether we suppose, with the vulgar, that the particles are little globules in mutual contact, or, with the partisans of corpuscular attractions and repulsions, 
we 
snppose the particles kept at a distance from each other by means of these attractions and repulsions mutually balancing each other. In this last cafe, no other arrangement is consistent with a quiescent equilibrium : and in this case, it is evident, from the theory of curvilineal motions, that the agitations of the particles will always be such, that the connecting forces, in actual exertion,
