<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to within 200 fathoms of the surface in a channel that has a much smaller average depth and is only 13^ miles wide. As no rivers&nbsp;discharge into it and little rain falls, it must be viewed as a purely&nbsp;evaporational area, and as such it is of extreme scientific interest.&nbsp;It reproduces and exaggerates all the special physical conditions of&nbsp;the Mediterranean ; but on account of the extremely trying nature&nbsp;of the climate it has not been so thoroughly investigated. The&nbsp;average amount of evaporation at Aden is variously estimated at&nbsp;from 025־ to 075־ inch per day, or from 8 to 23 feet per year ; in&nbsp;the Red Sea generally it must be at least equal to the smaller figure,&nbsp;and probably exceeds it. As the level of the Red Sea is not subject to any permanent change it is evident that water must flow&nbsp;in through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandcb—the slight current through&nbsp;the Suez Canal need not be considered—to replace loss by evaporation. If there were no return current it is estimated that the Red&nbsp;Sea would become a mass of solid salt in one or two thousand&nbsp;years. Although the salinity of the water is higher than that of&nbsp;the water of the oceau it does not appear to be on the increase.&nbsp;The density of Red Sea water at 60° Fahr. is about 1030־, corresponding to 4 0־ per cent, of total salts, while that of average ocean&nbsp;water is 1026־, which corresponds to 35־ per cent, of salts. In&nbsp;order to account for the constancy of salinity in the Red Sea it is&nbsp;necessary to assume the existence of strong undercurrents of salt&nbsp;water passing out of the sea, beneath the opposite entering current&nbsp;of fresher water. These undercurrents have not yet been observed, but there are indirect proofs of their existence. During&nbsp;the hottest months (July to September), when there is most evaporation, the prevalence of northerly winds drives the water out of&nbsp;the Red Sea as a rapid surface-drift; the south-west monsoon is&nbsp;blowing in the Indian Ocean at the same time, and the general&nbsp;level in the Red Sea is from 2 to 3 feet higher than during the&nbsp;cooler months, when evaporation is less, and when the north-east&nbsp;monsoon forces water into the funnel-shaped Gulf of Aden, and&nbsp;thence through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb. This is held by Dr&nbsp;W. B. Carpenter to be a proof of the existence of an undercurrent,&nbsp;for the north-east wind forms a head of water at the strait, which&nbsp;to equalize pressure over the area produces an under-return-current,&nbsp;and this greatly accelerates the flow of the regular undercurrent&nbsp;of the Red Sea, and so lowers the general level. In summer the&nbsp;outflow of dense salt water is slower, and this more than neutralizes&nbsp;the effect of the outward surface-drift, which to some extent reduces&nbsp;the volume of the entering fresher water at that season. In the&nbsp;Red Sea there is a constant and regular sub-surface circulation of&nbsp;water due solely to evaporation ; the surface-drifts caused by wind,&nbsp;although they form rapid currents and render navigation dangerous&nbsp;at times, are minor agents in the system and modify it only to a&nbsp;slight extent. The Red Sea and the Persian Gulf serve as concentration areas for maintaining the salinity of the deep water in the&nbsp;Indian Ocean, in opposition to the currents of comparatively fresh&nbsp;water flowing northwards from the Antarctic Ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Deposits</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.—In a sea so nearly landlocked and so narrow the deposits which cover the bottom are naturally of the order classed&nbsp;as terrigenous. The large quantity of sand blown into the sea,&nbsp;the immense abundance of corals and other calcareous organisms&nbsp;in the water, and the entire absence of rivers with their suspended&nbsp;sediments produce deposits more nearly resembling in some of&nbsp;their characteristics those of the open ocean than those of inland&nbsp;seas. But the sand and ooze from the bottom of the Red Sea have&nbsp;not yet been thoroughly examined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fauna</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.—Animal life in all its forms is extremely abundant in the Red Sea, which, however, cannot be said to have been any&nbsp;more completely surveyed from a biological than from a physical&nbsp;point of view, although several eminent zoologists have studied&nbsp;special types. Great numbers of new species have been discovered&nbsp;by each investigator, and it has been ascertained that the Red Sea&nbsp;fauna differs considerably from that of the Mediterranean, not&nbsp;more than twenty species being common, it is stated, to both,&nbsp;thus indicating that the separation of the two seas must have&nbsp;taken place at a remote epoch, which appears from geological evidence to be the Eocene period. It exhibits affinities with the fauna&nbsp;of the Pacific, particularly with that of the coast of Japan. Corals&nbsp;are more plentiful and more active in the Red Sea than in almost&nbsp;any other piece of water of its size, a result probably due equally&nbsp;to the high temperature, the great salinity of the water, and the&nbsp;abundance of food.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H. R. M.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REDSHANK, the usual name of a bird—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scolopax calidris</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Linnaeus and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Totanus calidris</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of modern authors&nbsp;—so called in English from the colour of the bare part of&nbsp;its legs, which, being also long, are conspicuous as it flies&nbsp;over its marshy haunts or runs nimbly beside the waters&nbsp;it affects. In suitable localities it is abundant throughout&nbsp;the greater part of Europe and Asia, from Iceland to&nbsp;China, mostly retiring to the southward for the winter,&nbsp;though a considerable number remain during that season</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">along the coasts and estuaries of some of the more northern countries. Before the great changes effected by drainage&nbsp;in England it was a common species in many districts, but&nbsp;at the present day there are very few to which it can resort&nbsp;for the purpose of reproduction. In such of them as&nbsp;remain, its lively actions, both on the ground and in the&nbsp;air, as well as its loud notes render the Redshank, during&nbsp;the breeding-season, one of the most observable inhabitants&nbsp;of what without its presence would often be a desolate&nbsp;spot, and invest it with a charm for the lover of wild nature.&nbsp;At other times the cries of this bird may be thought too&nbsp;shrill, but in spring the love-notes of the male form what&nbsp;may fairly be called a song, the constantly repeated refrain&nbsp;of which—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leero, leero</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leero</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (for so it may be syllabled)—&nbsp;rings musically around, as with many gesticulations he&nbsp;hovers in attendance on the flight of his mate; or, with a&nbsp;slight change to a different key, engages with a rival; or&nbsp;again, half angrily and half piteously complains of a&nbsp;human intruder on his chosen ground. The body of the&nbsp;Redshank is almost as big as a Snipe’s, but its longer neck,&nbsp;wings, and legs make it appear a much larger bird. Above,&nbsp;the general colour is greyish-drab, freckled with black,&nbsp;except the lower part of the back and a conspicuous band&nbsp;on each wing, which are white, while the flight-quills are&nbsp;black, thus producing a very harmonious effect. In the&nbsp;breeding-season the back and breast are mottled with dark&nbsp;brown, but in winter the latter is white. The nest is&nbsp;generally concealed in a tuft of rushes or grass, a little&nbsp;removed from the wettest parts of the swamp whence the&nbsp;bird gets its sustenance, and contains four eggs, usually of a&nbsp;rather warmly tinted brown with blackish spots or blotches;&nbsp;but no brief description can be given that would point out&nbsp;their differences from the eggs of other birds, more or less&nbsp;akin, among which, those of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Lapwing </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(vol. xiv. p. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">308)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">especially, they are taken and find a ready sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The name Redshank, prefixed by some epithet as Black, Dusky, or Spotted, has also been applied to a larger but allied species—&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Totanus fuscus</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> of ornithologists. This is a much less common&nbsp;bird, and in Great Britain as well as the greater part of Europe it&nbsp;only occurs on its passage to or from its breeding-grounds, which&nbsp;are usually found south of the Arctic Circle, and differ much from&nbsp;those of its congeners—the spot ־ chosen for the nest being nearly&nbsp;always in the midst of forests and, though not in the thickest part&nbsp;of them, often with trees on all sides, generally where a fire has&nbsp;cleared the undergrowth, and mostly at some distance from water.&nbsp;This peculiar habit was first ascertained by Wolley in Lapland in&nbsp;1853 and the following year. The breeding-dress this bird assumes&nbsp;is also very remarkable, and seems (as is suggested) to have some&nbsp;correlation with the burnt and blackened surface interspersed with&nbsp;white stones or tufts of lichen on which its nest is made—for the&nbsp;head, neck, shoulders, and lower parts are of a deep black, contrasting vividly with the pure white of the back and rump, while&nbsp;the legs become of an intense crimson. At other times of the year&nbsp;the plumage is very similar to that of the common Redshank, and&nbsp;the legs are of the same light orange-red.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A. N.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REDSTART, a bird well known in Great Britain, in many parts of which it is called Firetail—a name of almost the same meaning, since “ start ” is from the Anglo-Saxon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">steort,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> a tail.@@<sup>1</sup> This beautiful bird, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Huticilla&nbsp;phoenicurus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of most ornithologists, returns to England&nbsp;about the middle or towards the end of April, and at once&nbsp;takes up its abode in gardens, orchards, and about old&nbsp;buildings, when its curious habit of flirting at nearly every&nbsp;change of position its brightly-coloured tail, together with&nbsp;the pure white forehead, the black throat, and bright bay&nbsp;breast of the cock, renders him conspicuous, even if attention&nbsp;be not drawn by his lively and pleasing though short and&nbsp;intermittent song. The hen is much more plainly attired ;&nbsp;but the characteristic colouring and action of the tail per-</span></p>
