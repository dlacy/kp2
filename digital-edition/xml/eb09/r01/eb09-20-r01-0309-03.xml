<p><label>RECHABITES</label>
or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sons of Rechab,</hi> in ancient Israel formed a sort of religious order in some respects analogous to the Nazarites, with whom they shared the rule of abstinence from wine. They went farther than the latter, however, in eschewing the luxuries and pursuits of settled life, living in tents and refusing to sow grain as well as to plant vineyards. Their origin must have been in northern Israel, for their “ father ” or founder, to whom they referred their rule of life, was that Jehonadab or Jonadab, son of Rechab, who lent his countenance to Jehu in the abolition of Tyrian Baal-worship (2 Kings x.). The order founded by Jehonadab must from its constitution have soon become a sort of hereditary clan, and as such the “house of Rechab” appears in Jer. xxxv., from which we learn that they had survived in Judah after the fall of the northern kingdom and continued to observe the ordinance of Jehonadab till the approach of Nebuchadnezzar drove them for protection into Jerusalem. Jeremiah promised them as a reward of their obedience that they should never lack a man to represent them (as a priest) before Jehovah. This perhaps is the origin of the later Jewish tradition that the Rechabites intermarried with the Levites and so entered the temple service. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> From the obscure passage 1 Chron. ii. 55 it would seem that in later times the Rechabites were regarded as Kenites. </note> Hegesippus in his account of the death of James the Just even speaks of Rechabite priests and makes one of them protest against the crime (Eus., <hi rend="italic">II.fi.,</hi> ii. 23).</p>
