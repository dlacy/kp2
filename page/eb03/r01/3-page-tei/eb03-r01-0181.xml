(Signed) Stanislaus Augustus, King.”</p><p>This ſhows, at leaſt, the fate of the king ; and leaving that of the kingdom to be afcertained by time, we proceed to fulfil a promiſe which we made reſpe'ting another revolution, to which all the nations of Europe are ſtill looking with anxiety and alarm.</p><p>when treating of France under a former article, we ſtated a few of the more ſtriking hiſtorical facts which led to the commencement of the revolution ; and we now come to trace the feries of tranſactions which have marked its terrible career. In doing this, we ſhall comprefs our ideas as much as poſſible ; and out of the endleſs variety of materials of which the public are in poffeffion, we ſhall endeavour to extract a ſhort and, if poſſible, a tolerably clear detail. For this purpoſe, however, it will be neceſſary that we begin, by ſtating the internal ſituation of France at the period immediately preceding the revolution, along with the more obvious political circumſtances which contributed to the production of that event. The moral hiſtory of man is always more important than the mere recital of any phyfical occurrences that may take place in his lot. It is not the fall of a mighty monarch and the diſperſion of his family ; it is not the convulſion of empires, and the oceans of human blood which have been ſhed, that render the French revolution peculiarly intereſting. Such events, however deplorable, are far from being without example in the hiſtory of mankind. In the populous regions of the eaſt, where ſuperſtition and ſlavery have always prevailed, they are regarded as form-jng a part of the ordinary courſe of human affairs ; be-caufe an intrepid and ſkilful uſurper finds it eaſy to intimidate or enſnare millions of weak and credulous men. In Europe the cafe is very different ; no adventurer can advance far without encountering thoufands as artful and as daring as himſelf. Events are not the refult either of blind hazard or of individual ſkill ; confpira-cies or plots produce little effect. Like other arts, the art of government has been brought to much perfection ; and an eſtabliſhed conſtitution can only be ſhaken by the ſtrong convulſion produced by national paſſions and efforts. The wonderful fpectacle which we are now to contemplate, is that of a mild and poliſhed people be-coming in an inſtant fa∙nguinary and fierce ; a well eſta-bliſhed government, celebrated for its dexterity and ſkill, overturned almqſt without a ſtruggle ; a whole nation apparently uniting to deſtroy every inſtitution which antiquity had hallo&gt;vcd or education taught them to reſpect ; a ſuperſtitious people treating the religion of their fathers with contempt ; a long enſlaved people, whoſe very chains had become dear to them, occupied in their public counſels in the diſcuffion of refined, and even viſionary fchemes of freedom : in ſhort, 25,000,000 of perſons ſuddenly treading under foot every ſentiment and every prejudice that they themſelves had once regarded as ſacred and venerable.</p><p>Like the other nations of Europe, France was anciently governed by a barbarous ariſtocracy, whoſe different members were feebly united by the authority of a ſucceſſion of kings deſtitute of power or influence. The nobles, within their own territories, enjoyed privileges entirely royal : they made peace and war ; they coined money; they were judges i∏ the laſt reſort; their vaſſals were their ſlaves, whom they bought and fold along with the lands ; the inhabitants of cities, although freemen, were depreſſed and poor, depending for protection upon ſome tyrannical baron in their neighbourhood. At length, however, by the progreſs of the arts, the cities role into conſiderable importance, and their inhabitants, along with ſuch freemen of low rank as reſided in the conntry, were conſidered as enti-tled to a repreſentation in the ſtates-general of the kingdom, under the appellation of <hi rend="italic">tiers etat,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">third efiaιe ; </hi>the clergy and the nobles forming the two firſt eſtates. But the fovereign, having ſpeedily become deſpotic, the meetings of the ſtates general were laid aſide. Thia, abiolute authority, on the part of the crown, was not acquired, as it was in England by the houfe of Tudor, by abolifhing the pernicious privileges of the nobles and elevating the commons ; but by ſkilful encroachments, by daring exertions of prerogative, and the uſe of a powerful military force. In France, therefore, the mo-narch was abſolute, yet the nobles retained all their feudal privileges, and. the eccleſiaſtical hierarchy did the ſame. The following was, in a few words, the ſtate of that country during thefe two laſt centuries.</p><p>Ί he kingdom of France, previous to the. revolution, was never reduced to one homogenous mafs. It con-ſiſted of a variety of feparate provinces acquired by different means ; ſome by marriage, ſome by legacy", and others by conqueſt. Each province retained its ancient laws and privileges, whether political or civil, as expreſſed in their capitularies or conditions by which they were originally acquired. In one part oſ his do-minions the French monarch was a count, in another he was a duke, and in others he was a king ; the only bond which united his vaſt empire being the ſtrong military force by which it was overawed. Each province had its barriers ; and the intercourfe betwixt one province and another was often more reſtrained by local ufages than the intercourfe of either with a foreign country. Some ot the provinces, ſuch as Bretagne and Dauphiné, even retained the right of aſſembling periodically their provincial ſtates; but theſe formed no barrier againſt the power of the court.</p><p>The clergy formed the ſirſt eſtate of the kingdom in point of precedence. They amounted to 130,000, The higher orders of them enjoyed immenſe revenues ; but the rιzrct or great body of acting clergy ſeldom poffeffed more than about L. 28 Sterling a-year, and them <hi rend="italic">vicaires</hi>  about half that ſum. A few of their dignified clergy were men of great piety, who reſided coa-ſtantly in their diocefes, and attended to the duties of their office ; but by far the greater number of them paſſed their lives at Paris and Verfailles, immerfed in all the intrigues and diſſipation of a gav and corrupted court and capital. They were almoſt excluſively ſe-lected from among the younger branches of the families of the moſt powerful nobility, and accounted it a kind of diſhonour to the order of biſhops for any perſon of low rank to be admitted into it. The lower clergy, on the contrary, were perſons of mean birth, and had little chance of preferment. At the ſame time, we find ſeveral refpectable exceptions to this laſt rule. The clergy, as a body, independent of the tithes, poſſeſſed a revenue ariiing from their property in land, amounting ∙</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
