<p><span class="font1">idea of gaining what advantages he could in a partial action. The plan was to march the Allied army by Zeuchfeld, round&nbsp;Frederick’s left (which was covered by no serious natural&nbsp;obstacle), and to deploy in battle array, facing north, between&nbsp;Reichardtswerben (right) and Pettstädt (left). The duke’s&nbsp;proposed battle and the more limited aim of Soubise were&nbsp;equally likely to be attained by taking this position, which&nbsp;threatened to cut off Frederick from the towns on the Saale.&nbsp;This position, equally, could only be gained by marching round&nbsp;the Prussian flank, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> by a flank march before the enemy.&nbsp;The obvious risk of interference on the exposed flank was provided against by a considerable flank guard, and in fact it was&nbsp;not in the execution of their original design but in hastily&nbsp;modifying it to suit unfounded assumptions that the Allies&nbsp;met with disaster.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Frederick spent the morning watching them from a house-top in Rossbach. The initial stages of their movement convinced him&nbsp;that the Allies were retreating southward towards their magazines,&nbsp;and about noon he went to dinner, leaving Captain von Gaudi on&nbsp;the watch. This officer formed a different impression of the Allies'&nbsp;intentions, for the columns which from time to time became visible&nbsp;in the undulations of the ground were seen to turn eastwards from&nbsp;Zeuchfeld. Gaudi's excited report at first served only to confirm&nbsp;Frederick in his error. But when the king saw for himself that&nbsp;hostile cavalry and infantry were already near Pettstädt, he realized&nbsp;the enemy's intentions. The battle for which he had manoeuvred&nbsp;in vain was offered to him, and he took it without hesitation.&nbsp;Leaving a handful of light troops to oppose the French advanced&nbsp;post (or flank guard) on the Schortau hill, the Prussian army broke&nbsp;camp and moved—half an hour after the king, gave the order—to&nbsp;attack the enemy. The latter were marching in the normal order&nbsp;in two main columns, the first line on the left, the second line on the&nbsp;right; farther to the right was a column consisting of the reserve&nbsp;of foot, and between the first and second lines was the reserve&nbsp;artillery on the road. The right-wing cavalry was of course at&nbsp;the head, the left-wing cavalry at the tail of the two main columns.&nbsp;At first the regulation distances were preserved, but when wheeling&nbsp;eastward at Zeuchfeld there was much confusion, part of the reserve&nbsp;infantry getting in between the two main columns and hampering&nbsp;the movements of the reserve artillery, and the rest, on the outer&nbsp;flank of the wheel, being unable to keep up with the over-rapid&nbsp;movement of the wheeling pivot. A weak flank guard was thrown&nbsp;out towards Rossbach. When it was seen that the Prussians were&nbsp;moving, as far as could be judged, eastward, it was presumed that&nbsp;they were about to retreat in order to avoid being taken in flank and&nbsp;rear; and the Allied generals thereupon hurried the march, sending&nbsp;on the leading (right-wing) cavalry towards Reichardtswerben, and&nbsp;calling up part of the left-wing cavalry from the tail of the column,&nbsp;and even the flank-guard cavalry, to take part in the general chase.&nbsp;That Frederick's move meant an attack upon them before they could&nbsp;form up, Soubise and the duke failed to realize. They had taken&nbsp;more than three hours to break camp, and found it difficult to&nbsp;suppose that Frederick’s army could move off in one-sixth that time.&nbsp;It was obvious, moreover, that the Prussians were not deploying for&nbsp;battle on the plain in front of Rossbach and Nahlendorf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Frederick had no intention either of forming up parallel to the enemy or of retreating. As his army could move as a unit twice as&nbsp;fast as the enemy’s, he intended to make a détour, screened by the&nbsp;Janus Hügel anti the Pölzen Hügel, and to fall upon them suddenly&nbsp;from the east. If at the moment of contact the Allies had already&nbsp;formed their line of battle facing north, the attack would strike their&nbsp;right flank; if they were still on the move in column eastwards&nbsp;or north-eastwards, the heads of their columns would be crushed&nbsp;before the rest could deploy in the new direction—deployment in&nbsp;those days being a lengthy affair. To this end General von Seydlitz,&nbsp;with every available squadron, hurried eastward from Rossbach,&nbsp;behind the Janus Hügel, to the Pölzen Hügel; Colonel von Möller,&nbsp;with eighteen heavy guns, came into action on the Janus Hügel&nbsp;at 3.15 against the advancing columns of the Allied cavalry; and&nbsp;the infantry followed as fast as possible. When they came under&nbsp;the fire of Moller's guns, the Allied squadrons, which were now north&nbsp;of Reichardtswerben and well ahead of their own infantry, suffered&nbsp;somewhat heavily; but it was usual to employ heavy guns to protect&nbsp;a retreat, and they contented themselves with bringing some field-guns into action. They were, however, amazed when Seydlitz's&nbsp;thirty-eight squadrons suddenly rode down upon the head and right&nbsp;flank of their columns from the Pölzen Hügel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">avec une incroyable&nbsp;vitesse.</span><span class="font1">. Gallantly as the leading German regiments deployed to&nbsp;meet him, the result was scarcely in doubt for a moment. Seydlitz&nbsp;threw.in his last squadron, and then himself fought like a trooper,&nbsp;receiving a severe wound. The mêlée drifted rapidly southward,&nbsp;past the Allied infantry, and Seydlitz finally rallied his horsemen in&nbsp;a hollow near Tagewerben, ready for fresh service. This first&nbsp;episode was over in half an hour, and by that time the Prussian&nbsp;infantry, in échelon from the left, was descending the Janus Hügel&nbsp;to meet the already confused and disheartened infantry of the&nbsp;Allies. The latter, as their cavalry had done, managed to deploy&nbsp;some regiments on the head </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the column, and the French in particular formed one or two columns of attack—then peculiar to the&nbsp;French army—and rushed forward with the bayonet. But Moller's&nbsp;guns, which had advanced with the infantiy, tore gaps in the close&nbsp;masses, and, when it arrived within effective musketry range, the&nbsp;attack died out before, the rapid, and methodical volleys of the&nbsp;Prussian line. Meanwhile the Allies were trying in vain to form a&nbsp;line of battle. The two main columns had got too close together&nbsp;in the advance from Pettstädt, part of the reserve which had become&nbsp;entangled between the main columns was extricating itself by&nbsp;degrees and endeavouring to catch up with the rest of the reserve&nbsp;column away to the. right, and the reserve artillery was useless in&nbsp;the middle of the infantry. The Prussian infantry was still in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">échelon from the left, and the leftmost battalions that had repulsed the French columns were quickly within musket-shot of this helpless&nbsp;mass. A few volleys directed against the head and left flank of the&nbsp;column sufficed to create disorder, and then from the Tagewerben&nbsp;hollow Seydlitz's rallied squadrons charged, wholly unexpectedly,&nbsp;upon.its right flank. The Allied infantry thereupon broke and fled.&nbsp;Soubise and the duke, who was wounded, succeeded in keeping one&nbsp;or two regiments together, but the rest scattered over the countryside. The battle had lasted less than an hour and a half, and the last&nbsp;episode of the infantry fight no more than fifteen minutes. Seven&nbsp;Prussian battalions only were engaged, and these expended five&nbsp;to fifteen rounds per man. Seydlitz and Prince Henry of Prussia,&nbsp;the cavalry and the infantry leaders engaged, were both wounded,&nbsp;but the total loss of the king's army was under 550 officers and men&nbsp;as compared with 7700@@<sup>1</sup> on the part of the Allies.

<p><span class="font1">ROSSE, EARL OF, a title borne by the Irish family of Parsons. James Parsons, a native of Leicestershire, who flourished in&nbsp;the x6th century, was the father of Sir William Parsons (r.&nbsp;1570-1650), one of the lords justices of Ireland. Having&nbsp;crossed to Ireland in early life, William Parsons became surveyor-general in 1602 and obtained land in various parts of the country.&nbsp;In 1620 he was made a baronet; in 1643 he was deprived of his&nbsp;office as lord justice, and he died early in 1650. His great-grandson, Sir Richard Parsons, bart. (c. 1657-1703), was created&nbsp;Baron Oxmantown and Viscount Rosse in 1681, and Richard’s&nbsp;son and successor, Richard (d. 1741), was made earl of Rosse in&nbsp;1718. The titles became extinct when Richard, the 2nd earl,&nbsp;died in August 1764,</span></p>
