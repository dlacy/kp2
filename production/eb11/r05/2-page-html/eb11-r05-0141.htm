Transcaucasia supplies, chiefly from the government of Erivan,&nbsp;some<sub>t</sub> 12,000 tons of raw cotton annually. The tea plant thrives&nbsp;and is being planted fairly rapidly on the Black Sea littoral in&nbsp;Transcaucasia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Live-stock are diminishing in numbers all round: in the case of horses, from 21 per 100 inhabitants in 1882 to 11 per 100 inhabitants in 1904: of cattle, from 31 in 1851 to 23 in 1882 and 27&nbsp;in 1904.; sheep, from 56 to 46 and 41 in the years named respectively;&nbsp;and pigs, from 13 to 9 and 10 respectively. Recent investigations&nbsp;in the government of Moscow have revealed that 40% of the&nbsp;peasant households possessed no horses, and similar inquiries in&nbsp;41 governments elicited the fact that 28% of the peasant households were without horses, although of the total number of horses&nbsp;in the country ,82% belong to the peasantry. The animal&nbsp;commonly met with is small and possessed of very little strength;&nbsp;the best are those of Poland, the W. governments and the S.&nbsp;steppe country. Both the horses of the Cossacks and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bityug&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">race of S. Russia are fine animals, and those of the Kirghiz, though&nbsp;not big, are famous for their endurance. Finland ponies are&nbsp;exported in large numbers. The best bred races of cattle are&nbsp;those of Poland, the W. provinces, Little Russia and the far N.&nbsp;(Kholmogory). Of the 55 million sheep kept in Russia only about&nbsp;15 <sub>t</sub>millions belong to the fine merino breed, and, these are pastured&nbsp;chiefly on the Black Sea steppes. Modern dairy-farming is only&nbsp;just beginning in Russia, but butter is being exported in increasing quantities to W. Europe, including Great Britain. Poultryfarming is being more extensively engaged in, and vast numbers&nbsp;of eggs are exported.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Agriculture stands at a low level in Russia. The landowners are often poor, and suffer from want of capital and lack of enterprise. The peasantry are impoverished, and in many parts live&nbsp;on the verge of starvation for the greater part of the year. , While&nbsp;the methods of agriculture, have generally shown little, if any,&nbsp;advance, the population is increasing rapidly; and although since&nbsp;the emancipation of the peasants the average annual export of&nbsp;cereals has increased from less than 1 1/2 million tons in i860 to&nbsp;over 6 million tons in 1900, this result has been attained largely&nbsp;by the repeated cropping to exhaustion of the soil. Thus the&nbsp;cultivators, whether noble or peasant, have not profited much&nbsp;from the change in their economic circumstances brought about&nbsp;by the social emancipation of 1861. Agriculture suffers from the&nbsp;widespread poverty of the agricultural classes, from the taxation&nbsp;which weighs unjustly upon the peasantry,, from, their lack of&nbsp;education, their technical ignorance and national indoIence, and&nbsp;from the absence of those progressive institutions (e.g. co-operative&nbsp;buying) by means of which the peasantry, of Denmark have so&nbsp;wonderfully improved their position. As illustrating the general&nbsp;impoverishment of the Russian peasantry, it may be stated that&nbsp;the arrears of taxation owed by them have increased enormously&nbsp;since 1882, when they amounted to £2,854,000, until in 1900 the&nbsp;total amount was put at £15,222,000. And, strange to say, the&nbsp;heaviest arrears are due from the fertile black earth region of&nbsp;S. Russia, namely, 80% of their total indebtedness. Within&nbsp;recent years, however, some efforts have been made both by the&nbsp;Ministry of Agriculture and by the more enlightened of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">to improve the education of the peasantry, but the progress achieved&nbsp;has been small. The methods adopted by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> for improving the condition of agriculture have included the formation of&nbsp;agricultural councils, the appointment of inspectors, and the&nbsp;founding of museums, meteorological stations and depots for the&nbsp;sale of agricultural machinery. Measures are, being taken by&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> to increase the very low productivity of the forests.&nbsp;These cover a considerable area, as may be seen by the following&nbsp;table for 1904:—</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The distribution of forests is very unequal, the area covered by them in the various governments varying from 70% of the total&nbsp;area in the Ural governments of Perm and Ufa, and 68% in Olonets&nbsp;and Archangel, down to 2% in the S.E. The state is the chief&nbsp;owner of forests (almost exclusive owner in Archangel), and owns&nbsp;no less than 289,226,000 acres in European Russia and Poland&nbsp;(235,000,000 acres of good forests), while private persons own&nbsp;171,800,000 acres, the peasant communities 67,250,000 and the&nbsp;imperial family 22,400,000 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sericulture, which was in a flourishing condition in the ’sixties both in Caucasia and in S. Russia, was reduced to a very low ebb,&nbsp;in consequence of the silkworm disease, and was only renewed with&nbsp;any vigour towards the end of the ’eighties. At the beginning of</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font0">the 20th century it was most developed in Transcaucasia (Kutais, Elisavetpol), and extended into N. Caucasia. Sericulture is taught&nbsp;in a number of special schools and in a great number of village&nbsp;schools. Attempts are being made to re-establish the silkworm&nbsp;industry in S. Russia and in Poland. Altogether raw silk and silk&nbsp;yarn to an annual value exceeding 1 1/2 millions sterling are exported&nbsp;from Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Notwithstanding the wealth of the country in minerals and metals of all kinds, and, the endeavours made by government to&nbsp;encourage mining, including the imposition of protective&nbsp;tariffs even against Finland (in 1885), this and the related&nbsp;industries are still at a low stage of development. The&nbsp;remoteness of the mining from the industrial centres, the&nbsp;want of technical instruction and of capital, and the&nbsp;existence of vexatious regulations, aggravated by the disturbed&nbsp;condition of the country, which hinder credit, confidence and&nbsp;enterprise, are amongst the chief reasons for this. The imports of&nbsp;foreign metals in the rough, and of coal are steadily increasing, while&nbsp;the exports, never otherwise than insignificant, show no advance.&nbsp;As a producer of iron Russia nevertheless runs France neck and neck&nbsp;for the fourth place amongst the iron producing countries of the&nbsp;world, her annual output having increased from 1,004,800 metric&nbsp;tons in 1891 to 2,808,000 in 1901 and to 2,900,000 in 1904. The two&nbsp;principal mining centres of European Russia are the Urals, Ekater-lnoslav, Kharkov and the Don Cossacks territory. The Ural&nbsp;industry is the older, and is still conducted on primitive methods,&nbsp;wood being largely used for fuel, and the ore and metals being&nbsp;transported by water down the Kama and other rivers. , The&nbsp;minerals chiefly produced in the Urals are iron, coal, gold, platinum,&nbsp;copper, salt and precious stones. The production of pig-iron nearly&nbsp;doubled between 1890 and, 1900, increasing from 446,800 tons in&nbsp;the former year to 801,600 in the latter; but since 1900 the output&nbsp;has declined, the total for 1904 (inclusive of Siberia) being 644,000&nbsp;tons. The amount of iron and steel produced in the Urals is not&nbsp;quite 20% of the total in all European Russia and Poland. The&nbsp;output of coal in the Urals is, altogether, less than 3 % of the total&nbsp;for all the empire and 4% of the output of European Russia (exclusive of Poland) alone. The annual increase is but small, 261,300&nbsp;tons having been the total in 1891, and 517,000 tons the total in&nbsp;1904. Gold has been mined in the Urals since 1820; but since 1892&nbsp;the output has fallen off very considerably. Whereas in the latter&nbsp;year the yield amounted to 395.500 oz., in 1900 it was only&nbsp;291,250 oz. No less than 96% of the world’s supply of platinum&nbsp;comes from the Urals; but the total output only ranges between&nbsp;10,000 and 16,000 lb annually. The copper industry has greatly&nbsp;declined since the 18th century; whereas then it kept 20 smelting&nbsp;works employed, now one-tenth of that number can hardly be kept&nbsp;going. The output for the year is less than 4000 tons. At one time&nbsp;all Russia was supplied with salt from the Urals, but at the present&nbsp;time the output is extremely small, less than 350 tons annually.&nbsp;Salt has been mined there since the 16th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mining region of S. Russia is much more important. It is of comparatively recent foundation (i860), and is carried on largely&nbsp;with French and Belgian capital, with modern appliances and with&nbsp;modern scientific knowledge. Out of an average of some 2,700,000&nbsp;tons, of pig-iron produced annually in the whole of the Russian&nbsp;empire, 61*5 % is produced in the basin of the Donets, and out of an&nbsp;average of 2,160,500 tons of worked iron and steel 48*7 % are&nbsp;prepared in the same region. The principal consumer of this iron&nbsp;and steel is the government, for its railways, locomotives, w'agons,&nbsp;arsenals, artillery, &amp;c. The output of coal in the Russian empire&nbsp;has increased from a total of less than 300,000 tons in i860 to&nbsp;3,280,000 in 1880, 15,878,200 in 1900, and 18,620,000 tons in 1904.&nbsp;Of these totals something like 70% is produced in the S. coal-nela.&nbsp;Coal takes, however, an altogether secondary’ place as a fuel in&nbsp;Russia ; wood is much more extensively used, not only for domestic,&nbsp;but also for industrial purposes. It is estimated that for domestic&nbsp;purposes nearly 150,000,000 tons of w’ood are consumed every year,&nbsp;while the steamships, railways and factories consume another 20 or 25&nbsp;million tons. At the same time large quantities of petroleum refuse&nbsp;are used as fuel in the railways of S.E. Russia and Caucasia, and on&nbsp;the steamboats of the Volga system. For the petroleum industry&nbsp;and the mining of the Caucasus region, see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Caucasia.</span><span class="font0"> Mining in&nbsp;Poland and Siberia are more fully discussed under those headings.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the time of Peter the Great, the Russian government has been unceasing in its efforts for the creation and development of&nbsp;home manufactures., Important monopolies in the 18th&nbsp;century, and prohibitive import duties, as well as large&nbsp;money bounties, in the 19th contributed towards the&nbsp;accumulation of immense private fortunes, but manufactures have on the whole developed but slowly. A&nbsp;great upward movement has, however, been observable since 1863.&nbsp;About that time a thorough reform of the machinery in use was&nbsp;effected whereby the number of hands employed was reduced, but&nbsp;the yearly production doubled or trebled. Manufacturing industry&nbsp;in the modern sense can hardly be said to have existed in Russia</span></p>
