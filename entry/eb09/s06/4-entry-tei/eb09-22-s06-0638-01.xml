in Malay called <hi rend="italic">Pulu Partcha</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Indalas,</hi> is one of the largest and most important islands of the East Indian Archipelago. It stretches from north-west to south-east for a distance of 1047 miles,—Tandjong Batu, the northmost point, being situated in 5° 40' N. lat. and the southmost in 5° 59' S. lat. The greatest breadth is about 230 miles. In area it is estimated that Sumatra, with its 170,744 square miles,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> The triangulation of Sumatra was commenced in June 1883 by the measurement of a base line 4857 metres (nearly 3/miles) long in the neighbourhood of Padang. </note> is thirteen times the size of Holland, of which country the island is in large measure a dependency. The northern half runs obliquely parallel to the Malay Peninsula, from which it is separated by the Strait of Malacca, and the southern end is separated by the narrow Sunda Strait from Java. Unlike Java, Sumatra has a series of considerable islands (Nias Islands, Mentawei Islands, &amp;amp;c.) arranged like outworks in front of the coast that faces the open Indian Ocean. The general physical features of the island are simple and striking : a range of lofty mountains extends throughout its whole length, their western slopes descending rapidly towards the ocean and their eastern looking out over a vast alluvial tract of unusual uniformity. This mountain range is known as Bukit Barisan or Chain Mountain. It varies in average height from 1500 to 6000 feet, and consists of three or four ridges separated by plateau-like valleys. Among its more remarkable summits are Ya Mura or Gold Mountain, near the north end (6879 feet); Seret Berapi or Merapi (5857 feet), in 0° 44' N. lat. ; Pasaman or Mount Ophir (10,866); Merapi (9563); Indrapura, in 1° 36' S. lat. (11,800), which has the reputation of being the culminating point of the whole island ; Dempo (10,000) ; and Abong Abong (10,000). The summit of Indrapura was reached by the Central Sumatran Expedition of 1877-79. Towards the north end of the island the spurs •of the main chain sometimes extend towards the neighbourhood of the east coast. Owing to this configuration of the island, the water-courses of the western side are comparatively short : only very few of them are large enough to be navigable. Those of the eastern slope, on the other hand—such as the Tamiang, the Simpang, the Asahan, the Kubu, the Siak, the Indragiri, the Jambi, the Kampas, the Palembang—are longer, and can not unfrequently carry vessels of considerable burden. In their lower courses they form enormous inosculating deltas. The mountainous regions contain numerous lakes, many of them evidently the craters of extinct volcanoes. When, as sometimes happens, two or three of these craters have merged into one, the lake attains a great size. Amongst the larger lakes may be mentioned the Tao Silalahi, with its offshoots Tao Muara and Tao Balige ; Manindji, to the west of Fort de Kock; Sinkarah, south-east of Fort de Kock ; Korintji, inland from Indrapura ; Ranau, inland from Tampah ; and the lake of the X. Kotas, in the Padang Highlands.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Volcanoes.—</hi> Sumatra still possesses several centres of volcanic eruption, and in 1883 its southern extremity shared with Java in the disasters of the Krakatoa outbreak. Indrapura sends up from time to time heavy columns of smoke. Merapi,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> For an account of changes in the principal crater see Verbeek’s paper in <hi rend="italic">Natuurk. Tidschr. van Ned. Indië,</hi> 1885. </note> the most active of the volcanoes in the island, was in full eruption in the years 1807, 1822, 1834, 1845, 1863-64, and 1872. Mt Talang in the Padang Highlands, also has three craters, one of which is filled with molten sulphur. Junghuhn registered sixteen Sumatran volcanoes, and others have since been discovered.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Geology.—</hi> A large part of the Sumatran highlands consists of very old (probably Silurian or Devonian) slates and</p><p>clay schists, combined with hornblende talc and other schists, and traversed by veins of quartz. Granite also plays a considerable part, though it does not come so much to the surface. Carboniferous rocks (marls, sandstones, limestones, Ac.) are in some places well developed. Between the Carboniferous period and the Tertiary there is a great blank all through the island. Augite-andesite of late Eocene origin has greatly modified the surface of the country, and constitutes, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> the main part of the Barisan range.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> For the geology see R. D. M. Verbeek, <hi rend="italic">Die Tertiärformation von Sumatra und ihren Thierresten ;</hi> ‘ ‘ Topographische en Geologische Beschrijving van Zuid-Sumatra ” in <hi rend="italic">Jaarboek van het Μijnwesen in Ned.

Veth, 1882. </note> The Tertiary formation is strongly developed in four different divisions. They are usually considered to be Eocene ; but this determination rests on badly preserved fossils. The oldest or breccia division consists of débris of carboniferous limestone, syenites, and granites, sometimes in the form of breccia proper, sometimes in that of sandstones or marl clays. The fish remains found in the marls have led some palæontologists to assign a greater antiquity than that of Eocene to these strata, while others, again, consider them to be Miocene. Above this division (apparently absent in south Sumatra) comes the second of sandstones, clay rocks, coal-beds, and coal. The coal appears to be the result of a vegetation which grew <hi rend="italic">in situ.</hi> Above the coal is sandstone, sometimes 1000 feet thick. The third division consists of marly sandstones of evidently marine origin ; it is well developed in west Sumatra, but is absent from the south of the island. The fourth division is a limestone, rich in remains of corals, molluscs, echinids, and especially in <hi rend="italic">Orbitoides</hi>; it is well developed both in the west and in the south. Miocene deposits are more abundant in the south than in the west. At Lubu Lintang in the Benkulen residency the Ebuma fossils are characteristic.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="4"> Full details and a geological bibliography will be found in H. van Cappelle, <hi rend="italic">Het Karakter van de Nederlandsch-Indische Tertiaire Fauna,</hi> Sneek, 1885. </note></p><p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Sumatra possesses various kinds of mineral wealth. Gold occurs in the central regions ; gold mines have long been worked in Menangkabau and the interior of Padang, and gold-washing is carried on in several of the streams. Tin, which forms the staple of the neighbouring island of Bangka or <hi rend="smallcaps">Banca</hi> <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> is found more especially in Siak and the “ division ” of the L. Kotas. Copper mines are worked in the Padang Highlands (most largely in the district of Lake Sinkarah) and at Muki in Achin. Iron is not unfrequent, and magnetic iron is obtained at the “Iron Mountain” near Fort van der Capellen (Tanah Datar). Coal seams exist in the Malabuh valley (Achin),<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="5"> See <hi rend="italic">Indische Gids,</hi> 1880, paper and map. </note> in the Sinamu valley, and on both sides of the Ombilin (Umbilin) river; the Ombilin field was brought into notice more especially by Mr D. D. Veth of the 1877- 79 expedition. Lignite of good quality is found in several localities. Oil wells are worked at Langkat and other places ; and arsenic, saltpetre, alum, naphtha, and sulphur may be collected in the volcanic districts.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Administrative Divisions.—</hi> The process by which the Dutch have advanced to their present position in Sumatra has been a very gradual one, and even yet, though their supremacy is effective all round the coast, much of the interior remains practically unpossessed. The following are the more important political subdivisions of the country.</p><p>A. The Dutch government of the West Coast (area 46,212 square miles), extending along the shore of the Indian Ocean from Trumon, 2° 53' N. lat., to the Mandjuta, 2° 25' S. lat., comprises the residencies Padang, Tapanuli, and the Padang Highlands <hi rend="italic">(Padangsche Bovenlanden).</hi></p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s06-0639" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0667.jp2"/><p><label><?xml version="I.O" encoding="utf-8"?> unknown title unknown author <editionStmt> <edition> <date> unknown date <,date> <,edition> <,editionStmt>  unknown <,p>  Converted from a Word document with eb-docx2tei. <,p> <encodingDesc> <appInfo> <application ident="TEI_fromDOCX" version="2.I5.O" xml:id="docxtotei">  Knowledge Project: DOCX to TEI  <,application> <,appInfo> <,encodingDesc> <revisionDesc> <listChange> <change> <date> 2OI9-OI-2OT22:45:5IZ <,date> <name> unknown author <,name> <,change> <,listChange> <,revisionDesc>  The governor of the whole government has his residence at Padang. The residency of Padang is bounded south by Benkulen and north by Tapanuli. It contains a large number of separate districts, mostly corresponding to natural divisions formed by mountain-spurs or river valleys. Among the rest are Indrapura, Tapan, Lunang, and Silaut, which form the regency of Indrapura, and are the remains of the ancient kingdom of that name. Administratively Padang is divided into Ayer Bangis and Rau, Priaman, Padang, Painan. The headquarters of Ayer Bangis and Rau is Talu, to the north of Mt Ophir. Ayer Bangis itself is on the coast, and has a good roadstead on one of the islands that protect its bay. At Rau is the Dutch fort of Amerongen, and to the north-west the old fort of Balong or Sevenhoven. Padang is a town of some 2OOO houses and I5,OOO inhabitants, with a Chinese settlement and a European quarter. It is the chief market in Sumatra for gold. Indrapura lies about 8 miles up the river of its own name, and is now only an unimportant village of bamboo huts. The residency of Tapanuli is divided into Siboga (which includes the Nias Islands), Natal, Mandeling and Angkola, Padang Lawas. The town of Siboga has considerable commercial importance, the bay on which it stands being one of the finest in all Sumatra. Tapanuli, the ancient capital, and Sinkil, a commercial town, also deserve to be mentioned. In Natal (properly Natar) the leading places are Jambur, Sinkuang, and Natar. Padang Sidem- puan, the chief town of Mandeling and Angkola, lies to the south of Mt Lubu Raya. Fort Elout was formerly the military centre in Great Mandeling. The residency of the Padang Highlands lies east of Padang proper. The whole surface is mountainous, and the natural districts are very numerous. Again, Batipu and the X. Kotas,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="6"> “ Kota ” means settlement or township, and a great many of the districts are named from the number of kotas they contain ; thus in Agam we have the VII. Kotas, the VIII. Kotas, &amp;c. <,note> the L. Kotas, Tanah Datar, and the XIII. and IX. Kotas form the five administrative divisions. Bukit Tinggi, or, as it is usually called, Fort de Kock, is the capital of the residency ; other places of note are Bondjol, Padang Pandjang Payakombo, Fort van der Capellen, Pagar Rujung (the residence of the last prince of Menangkabau), Priyangan (the remains of another capital of Menangkabau), Sinkarah, and Solok. To the government of the West Coast belong the following islands :—Banyak Islands, a small limestone group, well wooded and sparsely peopled ; Nias Islands, with an area of 2523 square miles; Batu Islands (Pulu Pingi, Pulu Baai, Tanah Masa, Tanah Balla, &amp;amp;c. ; area 63O square miles) ; Mentawei and Pageh or Nassau Islands (area 42OO square miles) ; Engano (area 36O square miles), annexed by Holland in I863 and seldom visited. The Nias Islands are a very interesting group (see Dr Schreiber in <hi rend="italic">Petermann’s Mittheil., <,hi> I88I). There are no volcanoes, but earthquakes are very frequent. In the north the villages are mainly perched on steep hills reached by ladders ; in the south they are larger and occupy low-lying sites. <,p>  B. The residency of Benkulen or Bencoolen <hi rend="italic">(i.e., <,hi> Bang Kulon, “ west coast ”) lies along the west coast from the Mandjuta to the south end of Sumatra. It is divided into eight districts :—Mokko-Mokko ; Lais or Sungei Lama ; the district <hi rend="italic">(ommelanden) <,hi> of Benkulen ; the capital Benkulen ; Seluma ; Mana and Pasumah Ulu Mana ; Kauer ; and lastly Kru. Among the noteworthy places are Mokko- Mokko, with the old English fort Anna ; Bantal ; Lais (Laye), the former seat of the English resident ; and Benkulen, the capital, with I2,OOO inhabitants, Fort Marlborough, and a Chinese kampong (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Bencoolen). <,hi> <,p>  C. The residency of the Lampong districts, separated from Palembang by the Masudji river, is partly mountainous (Lampong Peak 68OO feet), partly so flat as to be under <,p>  water in the rainy season. It is divided into the districts of Telok Betong, Tulang Bawang, Seputih, Sekampong, Katimbang, and Semangka. The more important places are Telok Betong, chief town of the residency, Menggala (with a good trade), Gunung Sugi, Sukadana, Tandjong Karang, Beniawang. <,p>  D. The residency of Palembang consists of the former kingdom of this name, various districts more or less dependent on that monarchy, and (since I839) the kingdom of Jambi. With the exclusion of this last it is divided into the administrative districts of Palembang; Tebing Tinggi; Lematang I lu, Lematang Ilir, and the Pasumah country; Komering Ulu, Ogan Ulu, Inim, and the Ranau districts ; Musi Ilir; Ogan Ilir, Komering Ilir, and Blidah; and Iliran and Banyu Asin. In the kingdom of Jambi the government is left in the hands of the native chief. The town of Palembang is a large place of 5O,OOO inhabitants (25OO Chinese), with extensive barracks, hospitals, &amp;amp;c., a mosque (I74O), considered the finest in the Dutch Indies, and a traditional tomb of Alexander the Great. A good description of the town and its river approaches is given by Mr Forbes. <,p>  E. The kingdom of Indragiri (along with Kwanten and the districts of Retell and Mandah) is administratively subject to the residency of Riouw. <,p>  F. The residency of the East Coast was formed in I873 of the territory of Siak and its dependencies and the state of Kampar. It consists of five divisions,—the island Bengkalis, Siak proper, Labuan Batu, Asahan, Deli. The island has an area of 529 square miles and a population of 5OOO. Deli is the most important part of the residency, —having been since I87O the seat of the Amsterdam Deli Company, engaged in growing tobacco, coffee, &amp;amp;c. <,p>  G. In I878 the Achin (Atjeh) kingdom was turned into a Dutch government, but the greater part of the territory is still but little known. Compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Achin, <,hi> vol. i. p. 95 <hi rend="italic">sq. <,hi> <,p>  <hi rend="italic">Flora.— <,hi> Though Sumatra is separated from Java by so narrow a strait, the botanist at once finds that he has broken new ground when he crosses to the northern island, and the farther he advances inward the more striking becomes the originality of the flora. The alang fields, which play a great part in Java, have even a wider range in Sumatra, descending to within 7OO or 8OO feet of sea-level ; where- ever a space in the forest is clearea this aggressive grass begins to take possession of the soil, and if once it be fully rooted the woodland has great difficulty in re-establishing itself. Among the orders more strongly represented in Sumatra than in Java are the <hi rend="italic">Dip- terocarpaceæ, Ghrysobalanaceæ, <,hi> sclerocarp <hi rend="italic">Myrtaccæ, Melastomaccæ, <,hi> Begonias, <hi rend="italic">Nepenthes, Oxalidaceæ, Myristicaceæ, Ternströmiaccæ, Connaraceæ, Amyridaccæ, Cyrtandraceæ, Epacridaceæ, <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eriocaulaceæ. <,hi> Many of the Sumatran forms which do not occur in Java are found in the Malay Peninsula. In the north the pine tree <hi rend="italic">(Pinus Merkusiî) <,hi> has advanced almost to the equator, and in the south are a variety of species characteristic of the Australian region. The distribution of species does not depend on elevation to the same extent as in Java, where the horizontal zones are clearly marked ; and there appears to be a tendency of all forms to grow at lower altitudes than in that island. A remarkable feature of the Sumatran flora is the great variety of trees that vie with each other in stature and beauty, and as a timber-producing country the island ranks high even among the richly wooded lands of the archipelago.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="6"> The Central Sumatra Expedition alone collected specimens of about 4OO kinds of timber. <,note> The process of reckless deforestation is, however, beginning to tell on certain districts,—the natives often destroying a whole tree for a plank or rafter. The principal cultivated plants, apart from sugar cane aud coffee, are rice (in great variety of kinds), the cocoa-nut palm, the areng palm, the areca and the sago palms, maize (jagung), yams, and sweet potatoes ; and among the fruit trees are the Indian tamarind, the blimbing, pomegranate, jambosa, guava, papaw, orange, and lemon. Even before the arrival of Europeans Sumatra was known for its pepper plantations ; and these still form the most conspicuous feature of the south of the island. For the foreign market coffee is the most important of all the crops,—the Padang districts being the chief seat of its cultivation. The average value of the coffee brought to market in Padang in the three years I88O-82 was £52I,OOO. Benzoin was formerly obtained almost exclusively from Sumatra from the <hi rend="italic">Styrax Benzoin. <,hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="6"> See Miquel, <hi rend="italic">Flora I nd.

The <hi rend="italic">Galeo- pithecus volans <,hi> (“kubin,” “flying cat,” or “flying lemur”) is fairly common.

The <hi rend="italic">Pteropus edulis <,hi> (“ kalong,” “ flying fox ”) is to be met with almost everywhere, especially in the durian trees.

The Kubus, a race or tribe still found in an emphatically savage state in the interior, have been by some regarded as the remains of an aboriginal stock ; but Mr J. G. Garson, reporting on Kubu skulls and skeletons submitted to him by Mr Forbes, comes to the conclusion that they are decidedly Malay, though the frizzle in the hair might indicate a certain mixture of Negrito blood <hi rend="italic">(Journ. Anthrop. Inst., <,hi> I884). They speak the Malay dialect of the district to which they belong. <,p>  One of the most interesting of all the savage or semi-savage peoples is the Battaks or Batahs. About these a great deal has been written since Junghuhn published his <hi rend="italic">Die Battaländer <,hi> in I847. It is not known whether they were settled in Sumatra before the Hindu period. Their language contains words of Sanskrit origin and others most readily referred to Javanese, Malay, Menangkabau, Macassar, Sundanese, Niasese, and Tagai influence. At the present time they occupy the country to the south-east of Achin, in the centre of which lies the great Toba Lake ; but it is evident that they formerly possessed, or at least were present in, various other districts both north and south. The process of absorption into the Achin and Malay population which is now rapidly going on seems to have been long at work. In many points the Battaks are quite different from the Malay type. The average stature of the men is about 5 feet 4 inches, of the women 4 feet 8 inches. In general build they are rather thickset, with broad shoulders and fairly muscular limbs. The colour of the skin ranges from dark brown to a yellowish tint, the darkness apparently quite independent of climatic influences or distinction of race. The skull is rather oval than round. In marked contrast to the Malay type are the large black long-shaped eyes, beneath heavy black or dark brown eyebrows. The cheek bones are somewhat prominent, but less so than among the Malays. J. B. Neumann<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="7"> “ Het Pane en Bila Stroomgebied,” in <hi rend="italic">Tijdsch. Ned. Aardrijksk.

The same character is employed by the Pasumahs, who bear traces of Javanese elements or influence. Full details as to the various forms are given by Van Hasselt, <hi rend="italic">Volksbc- <,hi> <,p>  <hi rend="italic">schr. en Taal van Mid.·Sumatra <,hi> (I877-79 expedition). The original stock of the Achinese appears, according to K. H. F. van Langen <hi rend="italic">(Tijdschr. voor Ind. Taal-, Land-, en Volkcn∙Kunde, <,hi> Batavia, xxviii.), to have consisted of the Mantirs, who seem to have been driven inland by the Battaks and the Cheties (Tjeties) or Hindus. The Achinese language is at present spoken in four main dialects, of which the purest or most cultured is that of the XXV. and XXVI. Mukims. It shows, besides the Mantir element, Malay, Battak, Hindu, and Arabic influence. The inhabitants of the Nias Islands have a special tongue, which has been studied by Herr Sundermann. <,p>  The physical conditions of large tracts render it certain that as a whole the island cannot be thickly peopled. In I88I the Government <hi rend="italic">Almanac <,hi> gave the population of the Dutch possessions as 2,I42,873 (2894 Europeans, 2,O98,984 natives, II,289 Chinese, I929 “Arabs,” and 27,777 Orientals of other stock). To this considerable additions must be made, as the kingdom of Achin (356,OOO at least), as well as Indragiri and Kwanten (about 3O,OOO). Perhaps a fair estimate for the whole is somewhat under 3,5OO,OOO. The Nias Islands would add 23O,OOO to the total. The most populous region is the government of the West Coast. <,p>  <hi rend="italic">History.— <,hi> As far as is known, Sumatran civilization and culture are of Hindu origin ; and it is not improbable that the island was the first of all the archipelago to receive the Indian immigrants who played so important a part in the history of the region. Certain inscriptions discovered in the Padang Highlands seem to certify the existence in the 7th century of a powerful Hindu kingdom in Tanah Datar, not far from the site of the later capital of Menangkabau. In these inscriptions Sumatra is called the “ first Java.” The traces of Hindu influence still to be found in the island are extremely numerous, though far from being so important as those of Java. There are ruins of Hindu temples at Butar in Deli, near Pertibi, on the Panbi river at Jambi, in the interior of Palembang above Lahat, and in numerous other localities. One of the principal Hindu ruins is at Muara Takus on the Kampar river.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="7"> See descriptions of it in <hi rend="italic">Tijdschr. van Ind. Taal-, Land-, en Kolken-Kunde, <,hi> I86O and I879, and <hi rend="italic">Verhandel. Bataυ. Gen. van Kunst en Wetensch., <,hi> I88I. <,note> The buildings (including a stupa 4O feet high) may possil&amp;gt;ly date from the IIth century. At Pagar Rujung are several stones with inscriptions in Sanskrit and Menangkabau Malay. Sanskrit words occur in the various languages spoken in the island ; and the <hi rend="italic">Ficus religiosa, <,hi> the sacred tree of the Hindu, is also the sacred tree of the Battaks. At a later period the Hindu influence in Sumatra was strengthened by an influx of Hindus from Java, who settled in Palembang, Jambi, and Indragiri, but their attachment to Sivaism prevented them from coalescing with their Buddhist brethren in the north. In the I3th century Mohammedanism began to make itself felt, and in course of time took a firm hold upon some of the most important states. In Menangkabau, for instance, the Arabic alphabet displaced the Kawi (ancient Javanese) character previously employed. Native chronicles derive the Menangkabau princes from Alexander the Great; and the Achinese dynasty boasts its origin from a missionary of Islam.
