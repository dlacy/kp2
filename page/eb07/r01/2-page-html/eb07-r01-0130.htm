<p><span class="font0">“ The loggerhead and the trunk turtles are the least cautious in choosing the places in which to deposit their eggs, whereas the two other species select the wildest and most secluded spots. The green turtle resorts either to the shores of&nbsp;the Maine, between Cape Sable and Cape Florida, or enters&nbsp;Indian, Halifax, and other large rivers or inlets, from which&nbsp;it makes its retreat as speedily as possible, and betakes itself to the open sea. Great numbers, however, are killed&nbsp;by the turtlers and Indians, as well as by various species of&nbsp;carnivorous animals, as cougars, lynxes, bears, and wolves.&nbsp;The hawk-bill, which is still more wary, and is always the&nbsp;most difficult to surprise, keeps to the sea-islands. All the&nbsp;species employ nearly the same method in depositing their&nbsp;eggs in the sand ; and as I have several times observed&nbsp;them in the act, I am enabled to present you with a circumstantial account of it. On first nearing the shores, and&nbsp;mostly on fine calm moonlight nights, the turtle raises her&nbsp;head above the water, being still distant thirty or forty&nbsp;yards from the beach, looks around her, and attentively examines the objects on shore. Should she observe nothing&nbsp;likely to disturb her intended operations, she emits a loud&nbsp;hissing sound, by which such of her many enemies as are&nbsp;unaccustomed to it are startled, and so are apt to remove&nbsp;to another place, although unseen by her. Should she&nbsp;hear any noise, or perceive indications of danger, she instantly sinks and goes off to a considerable distance ; but&nbsp;should everything be quiet, she advances slowly towards&nbsp;the beach, crawls over it, her head raised to the full stretch&nbsp;of her neck, and when she has reached a place fitted for&nbsp;her purpose, she gazes all around in silence. Finding ‘all&nbsp;well,’ she proceeds to form a hole in the sand, which she&nbsp;effects by removing it from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">under</span><span class="font0"> her body with her </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hind&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">flappers, scooping out with so much dexterity that the&nbsp;sides seldom if ever fall in. The sand is raised alternately&nbsp;with each flapper, as with a large ladle, until it has accumulated behind her, when, supporting herself with her head&nbsp;and fore part on the ground fronting her body, she with a&nbsp;spring from each flapper sends the sand around her, scattering it to the distance of several feet. In this manner&nbsp;the hole is dug to the depth of eighteen inches, or sometimes more than two feet. This labour I have seen performed in the short period of nine minutes. The eggs are&nbsp;then dropped one by one, and disposed in regular layers to&nbsp;the number of a hundred and fifty, or sometimes nearly two&nbsp;hundred. The whole time spent in this part of the operation may be about twenty minutes. She now scrapes the&nbsp;loose sand back over the eggs, and so levels and smooths&nbsp;the surface, that few persons, on seeing the spot, could imagine anything had been done to it. This accomplished to&nbsp;her mind, she retreats to the water with all possible despatch, leaving the hatching of the eggs to the heat of the&nbsp;sand. When a turtle, a loggerhead, for example, is in the&nbsp;act of dropping her eggs, she will not move although one&nbsp;should go up to her, or even seat himself on her back, for&nbsp;it seems that at this moment she finds it necessary to proceed at all events, as she is unable to intermit her labour.&nbsp;The moment it is finished, however, off she starts ; nor&nbsp;would it then be possible for one, unless he were as strong&nbsp;as a Hercules, to turn her over and secure her.” “ Persons&nbsp;who search for turtles’ eggs are provided with a light stiff&nbsp;cane, or a gun-rod, with which they go along the shores,&nbsp;probing the sand near the tracks of these animals, which,&nbsp;however, cannot always be seen, on account of the winds&nbsp;and heavy rains that often obliterate them. The nests are&nbsp;discovered not only by men, but also by beasts of prey, and&nbsp;the eggs are collected or destroyed on the spot in great&nbsp;numbers, as on certain parts of the shores hundreds of turtles are known to deposit their eggs within the space of a&nbsp;mile. They form a new hole each time they lay, and the&nbsp;second is generally dug near the first, as if the animal were&nbsp;quite unconscious of what had befallen it. It will readily&nbsp;be understood, that the numerous eggs seen in a turtle on&nbsp;cutting it up could not be all laid the same season. The&nbsp;whole number deposited by an individual in one summer&nbsp;may amount to four hundred, whereas, if the animal is&nbsp;caught on or near her nest, as I have witnessed, the remaining eggs, all small, without shells, and as it were threaded like so many large beads, exceed three thousand. In&nbsp;an instance where I found that number, the turtle weighed&nbsp;nearly four hundred pounds. The young, soon after being&nbsp;hatched, and when yet scarcely larger than a dollar, scratch&nbsp;their way through their sandy covering, and immediately&nbsp;betake themselves to the water.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The food of the green turtle consists chiefly of marine plants, more especially the grass-wrack </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Zostera marina),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which they cut near the roots, to procure the most tender&nbsp;and succulent parts. Their feeding grounds, as I have elsewhere said, are easily discovered by floating masses of these&nbsp;plants on the flats, or along the shores to which they resort.&nbsp;The hawk-billed species feeds on sea-weeds, crabs, various&nbsp;kinds of shell-fish and fishes ; the loggerhead mostly on the&nbsp;fish of conch-shells of large size, which they are enabled,&nbsp;by means of their powerful beak, to crush to pieces with&nbsp;apparently as much ease as a man cracks a walnut. One&nbsp;which was brought on board the Marion, and placed near&nbsp;the fluke of one of her anchors, made a deep indentation in&nbsp;that hammered piece of iron that quite surprised me. The&nbsp;trunk-turtle feeds on mollusca, fish, crustacea, sea-urchins,&nbsp;and various marine plants. All the species move through&nbsp;the water with surprising speed ; but the green, and hawkbilled in particular, remind you, by the celerity and ease of&nbsp;their motions, of the progress of birds through the air.” @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We shall add a few brief notices, chiefly to connect the preceding observations, and such as follow, with the systematic names bestowed by naturalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our first species is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia mydas,</span><span class="font0"> commonly called the green turtle, not so much by reason of its external colour,&nbsp;as because its fat, beloved by aldermen, assumes, when the&nbsp;creature is in high condition, a decidedly greenish hue.&nbsp;This tint is by some regarded as derived from its marine pastures, particularly </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zostera marina,</span><span class="font0"> or turtle-grass, of which&nbsp;it is particularly fond. The shield of this species consists&nbsp;of thirteen plates, which do not lie over each other after&nbsp;the manner of tiles. Those of the central or upper line are&nbsp;almost in the form of regular hexagons. The green turtle&nbsp;is a reptile of gigantic proportions, sometimes measuring&nbsp;six or seven feet in length, and weighing seven or eight&nbsp;hundred pounds. Its flesh forms an agreeable and healthy&nbsp;aliment to sea-faring men in most of the seas of the torrid&nbsp;zone, and is still more highly prized by epicurean landsmen.&nbsp;Its eggs are also most excellent as articles of diet. The&nbsp;introduction of turtle into Britain, as an article of luxury,&nbsp;is believed to be of no very distant date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Of the sea-turtles,” says Catesby, “ the most in request is the green turtle, which is esteemed a most wholesome and&nbsp;delicious food. It receives its name from the fat, which is&nbsp;of a green colour. Sir Hans Sloane informs us, in his History of Jamaica, that forty sloops are employed by the </span><span class="font1">in</span><span class="font0">habitants of Port Royal, in Jamaica, for the catching them.&nbsp;The markets are there supplied with turtle as ours are with&nbsp;butchers’ meat. The Bahamians carry many of them to&nbsp;Carolina, where they turn to good account ; not because&nbsp;that plentiful country w ants provisions, but they are esteemed there as a rarity, and for the delicacy of their flesh. They&nbsp;feed on a kind of grass growing at the bottom of the sea&nbsp;commonly called turtle-grass. The inhabitants of the Ba-</span></p>
