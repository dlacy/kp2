<p><span class="font0">DipsaAiilæ are more numerous (eighteen species) than in the other equatorial regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Elachistod&lt;rn and Hologcrrhιιm may be mentioned as remarkable types not found elsewhere, but with a very local distribution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The development of Lycodonts India has in common with Africa ; but the genera, six in number, are distinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Also the presence of gigantic Snakes of the genus Python is a feature which India shares with Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Erycidæ three species are Indian, Gongylophis and Cursoria being peculiar to the region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Poisonous Snakes are numerous, the proportion to innocuous Snakes being as 1 :10. Out of forty-six species, only two belong&nbsp;to the family of true Vipers, and they are restricted to the Indian&nbsp;peninsula with Ceylon, one {Echis} being even specifically identical&nbsp;with the African species, and the other {Dabοia) having its only&nbsp;congener in the Mediterranean district. The remainder of the&nbsp;poisonous Snakes belong to the Elapidæ and Crotalidæ or Pit&nbsp;Vipers. The former are represented by six genera, of which no less&nbsp;than five are highly characteristic of the region, whilst the Cobras&nbsp;{Naja) are equally distributed over Africa. Of Pit Vipers five&nbsp;genera have been distinguished, the most characteristic being an&nbsp;arboreal form, Trimeresurus, with seventeen species. Also the&nbsp;other five genera are peculiar to India, with the exception of the&nbsp;genus Halys which is Central-Asiatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The relations of the Indian region to the others will be considered as we proceed with the accounts of those faunas. Japan, with&nbsp;regard to its Reptilian fauna as a whole, must be referred to this&nbsp;region. This is clearly shown by the presence of species of Ophites,&nbsp;Calloρhis, Trimeresurns, Tachydromus,—characteristically Indian&nbsp;forms, with which species of Clemmys, Trionyx, Gecko, Halys, and&nbsp;some Colubrines closely allied to Chinese or Central-Asiatic species&nbsp;are associated. The few Reptiles inhabiting the northern part of&nbsp;Japan are probably Palæarctic species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The African Region.—</span><span class="font1">Owing to its strictly continental&nbsp;character and diminished variety of physical features, this&nbsp;region is inhabited by a much smaller number of Reptiles&nbsp;than one might be led to expect from the large extent of&nbsp;its geographical area. There are but few small outlying&nbsp;islands, furnishing a small number of interesting additions&nbsp;to this fauna. Madagascar, indeed, would supply a considerable contingent of distinct forms, but it is questionable&nbsp;whether this large island should be united with the African&nbsp;region, as we shall see hereafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The African region is characterized by the development of three of the four principal divisions of terrestrial&nbsp;Chelonians, viz., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testudinidæ, Chelydidæ,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tmonycidæ ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emydidæ</span><span class="font1"> are absent, being represented by one species&nbsp;only, in the north-western corner of the region </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Emys&nbsp;platyceps).</span><span class="font1"> The thirty-seven species are distributed&nbsp;thus :—</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The majority of the genera are peculiar, viz., Chersine, Pyxis, Cinyxis, Dumerilia, Sternothcnιs, Pelomedusa, and Cyeloderma ;&nbsp;and no other region shows a similar development of Land Tortoises.&nbsp;This last type has not only diverged into four genera, but is also&nbsp;represented by several of those gigantic forms which survived into&nbsp;geologically recent times. In the African region they inhabited&nbsp;only the neighbouring oceanic islands, viz., the Aldabra group,&nbsp;Mauritius, and Rodriguez ; out of the eight species, which have&nbsp;been recognized chiefly from their osseous remains, one only survives at the present day. Also in Madagascar fossil remains of&nbsp;gigantic species, which must have been contemporaries of Æpyornis,&nbsp;have been discovered by Grandidier ; but on the continent no trace&nbsp;of these large creatures has been found hitherto. The Chelonians&nbsp;of the eastern and western halves of the continent do not essentially differ from each other, but Trionyx does not extend southwards&nbsp;beyond the tropic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Croeodilidæ, Crocodilus</span><span class="font1"> is represented by three or four species. Alligators are absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the families of Lizards inhabiting Africa the majority occur in the southern portion. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Λgamidχ</span><span class="font1"> are numerous,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and represented chiefly by terrestrial forms. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gecko-nidæ, Scincidæ, Laeertidæ,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Varanidæ</span><span class="font1"> are likewise well represented ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eublepharidæ</span><span class="font1"> by a single genus and species&nbsp;in West Africa. The presence of several genera of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbænidæ,</span><span class="font1"> some of which are even identical with&nbsp;South-American, is highly suggestive. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gerrhosaumdæ,&nbsp;Zonuridæ,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anelytropidæ</span><span class="font1"> are peculiar to tropical&nbsp;Africa ; but the most important feature of this Lacertilian&nbsp;fauna is the almost universal distribution of Chamæleons&nbsp;in numerous and highly specialized species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Leaving aside, for the present, the island of Madagascar, we estimate that the number of species of African Snakes&nbsp;does not exceed two hundred, which are referable to about&nbsp;seventy genera, of which no less than fifty do not range&nbsp;beyond the limits of the region. On the whole the east&nbsp;coast genera are different from those of the west coast, but&nbsp;in the southern parts no such differentiation can be shown.&nbsp;Very little is known as regards the range of the species&nbsp;and genera towards the central districts. As regards&nbsp;higher groups only two families, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dasypeltidæ</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dinophidæ,</span><span class="font1"> are peculiar to Africa; and, although they&nbsp;have a wide range over the region, they consist of very&nbsp;few species only. Other families show a greater variety&nbsp;of genera and species here than in any other part of the&nbsp;globe. The almost entire absence of the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tropi-(lonotus</span><span class="font1"> and the scanty representation of Colubers are very&nbsp;noticeable features. Poisonous Snakes are numerous, all&nbsp;the various families being well represented, with the&nbsp;exception of the Pit Vipers ; singularly enough innocuous&nbsp;Colubrine Snakes with facial pits occur </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Bothrophthalmus,&nbsp;Bothrolycus).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Typhlopidæ nearly forty species have been described, and, besides, the Stenostomatidæ are represented by seven species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Eight out of ten Calamaroid genera are peculiar to this fauna, and remarkable is the frequency with which among them the&nbsp;sub-caudal shields coalesce into a single series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Caronellidæ are represented by some twenty species, but no true Coluber occurs, the four species which approach this type&nbsp;most closely belonging to distinct genera {Seaphiophis, Xenurophis,&nbsp;Herpetæthiops).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Almost entire absence of Tropidonotics is a characteristic feature of this fauna. Also of other Freshwater Snakes only six genera&nbsp;with seven species are known.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The small family of Psammophidæ is well represented by three genera and nine species, of which six belong to Psammophis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Tree-Snakes there are six genera, of which Ahætulla (Philo-thamnus) is most generally distributed, in twelve species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Dipsadidæ there are five genera and ten species, four of which belong to Diρsas proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Lycodonts are as well developed as in India, by seven genera and fourteen species ; all the genera are peculiar to Africa,&nbsp;and some of them are modified for an arboreal mode of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Pythons three species are distinguishable ; but, besides, a member of the Booid family (Pelophilus fordii) occurs on the west coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two species of Eryx occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Poisonous Snakes are extremely numerous, the proportion to innocuous Snakes being as 1 : 5. Of Elapidæ four genera occur,&nbsp;among which Naja figures with at least two species ; besides this&nbsp;family the Dinophidæ are a remarkable and characteristic type,&nbsp;having assumed entirely the appearance and mode of life of Tree&nbsp;Snakes. The Atraetaspididæ, with three genera and thirteen&nbsp;species, are likewise almost entirely African, only one other type&nbsp;CDinodipsas) having been recently discovered in Venezuela.&nbsp;Pit Vipers are absent, but the largest forms of Viperidæ are&nbsp;developed in this region, this family being represented by four&nbsp;genera and twelve species. The singular genus Atheris is a real&nbsp;Tree Viper with prehensile tail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Reptilian fauna of Madagascar is a most remarkable mixture of types belonging to different regions, which cannot be accounted&nbsp;for in the present state of our knowledge of the geological changes&nbsp;that have taken place whilst the present fauna was already in&nbsp;existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Chelonians@@<sup>1</sup> offer a marked point of distinction from those of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> The Chelonians of Madagascar require a thorough critical examination ; some of the species which are recorded as having been brought from that island have been evidently introduced from the African&nbsp;continent. Others, as also certain species of Snakes, are certainly not&nbsp;natives of Madagascar.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
