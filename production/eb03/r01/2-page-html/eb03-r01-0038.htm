<p><span class="font2">preſumed by law incapable to commit a rape, and therefore it ſeems cannot be found guilty of it. For&nbsp;though in other felonies &quot; malitia ſupplet ætatem&nbsp;yet, as to this particular fpecies of felony, the law ſup-poſes an imbecillity of body as well as mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The civil law ſeems to ſuppoſe a proſtitute or common harlot incapable of any injuries of this kind: not allowing any puniſhment for violating the chaſtity of&nbsp;her, who hath indeed no chaſtity at all, or at leaſt&nbsp;hath no regard to it. But the law of England does&nbsp;not judge ſo hardly of offenders, as to cut off all op-portunity of retreat even from common ſtrumpets, and&nbsp;to treat them as never capable of amendment. It&nbsp;therefore holds it to be felony to force even a concubine or harlot ; becauſe the woman may have forſaken that unlawful courſe of life : for, as Bracton&nbsp;well obſerves, &quot; licet merctriχ fuerit antea, certe tunc&nbsp;temporis non fuit, cum reclaιnando nequitiæ ejus con-ſentire noluit.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As to the material facts requiſite to be given in evi-dencε and proved upon an indictment of rape, they are of ſuch a nature, that, though neceſſary to be known&nbsp;and ſettled, for the conviction of the guiky and preſervation of the innocent, and therefore are to be found in&nbsp;ſuch criminal treatiſes as diſcourſe of theſe matters in&nbsp;detail, yet they are highly improper to be publicly dif-cuſſed, except only in a court of juſtice. we ſhall&nbsp;therefore merely add upon this head a few remarks&nbsp;from Sir Matthew Hale, with regard to the competen-ey and credibility of witneffes ; which may, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſalvo pudore,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">be conſidered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And, firſt, the party raviſhed may give evidence upon oath, aud is in law a competent witneſs ; but the credi-bility of her teſtimony, and how far forth ſhe is to be&nbsp;believed, muſt be left to the jury upon the circumſtances&nbsp;of fact that concur in that teſtimony. For inſtance :&nbsp;if the witneſs be of good fame; if ſhe preſently diſcovered the offence, and made ſearch for the offender; if the&nbsp;party accuſed fled for it ; thele and the like are concurring circumſtances, which give greater probability&nbsp;to her evidence. But, on the other ſide, if ſhe be of&nbsp;evil fame, and ſtand unſupported by others ; if ſhe con-cealed£the injury for any conſiderable time after ſhe had&nbsp;opportunity to complain ; if the place, where the fact&nbsp;was alleged to be committed, was where it was poſſible&nbsp;ſhe might have been heard, and ſhe made no outcry :&nbsp;theſe and the like circumſtances carry a ſtrong, but not&nbsp;concluſive, preſumption that her teſtimony is falſe or&nbsp;feigned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Moreover, if the rape be charged to be committed on an infant under 12 years of age, ſhe may ſtill be&nbsp;a competent witneſs, if ſhe hath ſenfe and underſtanding to know the nature and obligations of an oath ;&nbsp;and, even if ſhe hath not, it is thought by Sir Matthew Hale, that ſhe ought to bc heard without oath,&nbsp;to give the court information ; though that alone will&nbsp;not be ſufficient to convict the offender. And he is of&nbsp;this opinion, ſirſt, Becauſe the nature of the offence&nbsp;being ſecret, there may be no other poſſiblc proof of&nbsp;the actual fact ; though afterwards there may be con-current circumſtances to corroborate it, proved by&nbsp;other witneffes : and, fccondly, Becauſe the law allows what the child told her mother, or other relations, to be given in evidence, ſince thc nature of the&nbsp;cafe admits frequently of </span><span class="font0">no better proof ; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">there&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">is much more reafon for the court to hear the narration of the child herfelf, than to receive it at ſecond-hand from thoſe who ſwear they heard her fay ſo.&nbsp;And indeed it feems now to be fettled, that in theſij&nbsp;caſes infants of any age are to be heard ; and, if they&nbsp;have any idea of an oath, to be alſo fworn ; it being&nbsp;found by experience, that infants of very tender years&nbsp;often give the cleareſt and trueſt teſtimony. But in&nbsp;any of theſe caſes, whether the child be fworn or not,&nbsp;it is to be wiſhed, in order to render her evidence credible, that there ſhould be ſome concurrent teſtimony&nbsp;of time, place, and circumſtances, in order to make&nbsp;out the fact ; and that the conviction ſhould not be&nbsp;grounded ſingly on the unfupported accuſation of </span><span class="font0">an&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">infant under years of diſcretion. There may be therefore, in many caſes of this nature, witneffes who are&nbsp;competent, that is, who may be admitted to be heard ;&nbsp;and yet, after being heard, may prove not to be credible, or ſuch as the jury is bound to believe. For&nbsp;one excellence of the trial by jury is, that the jury are&nbsp;triers of the credit of the witneffes, as well as of thc&nbsp;truth of the fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; It is true (fays this learned judge), that rape is a moſt deteſtable crime, and therefore ought ſeverely&nbsp;and impartially to be puniſhed with death ; but it muſt&nbsp;be remembered, that it is an accuſation eaſy to be made,&nbsp;hard to be proved, but harder to be defended by the&nbsp;party accufed, though innocent.” He then relates&nbsp;two very extraordinary cafes of malicious proſecution&nbsp;for this crime, that had happened within his own ob- -ſervation ; and concludes thus : &quot; I mention thefe inſtances, that we may be the more cautious upon trials&nbsp;of offences of this nature, wherein the court and jury&nbsp;may with ſo much eafe be impoſed upon, without&nbsp;great care and vigilance ; the heinoufneſs of the offence&nbsp;many times tranſporting the judge and jury with fo&nbsp;much indignation, that they are over-haſtily carried&nbsp;to the conviction of the perſons accnſed thereof, by&nbsp;the confident teſtimony of ſometimes falſe and malicious witneffes.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAPHAEL (D’Urbino), the greateſt, moſt ſublime, and moſt excellent painter that has appeared, ſince the revival of the fine arts, was the ſon of an indifferent painter named </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sαnzio,</span><span class="font2"> and was born at Urbi-no on Good Friday 1482. The popes Julius II. and&nbsp;Leo X. who employed him, loaded him with wealth&nbsp;and honour ; and it is ſaid that cardinal De St Bibiana&nbsp;had ſuch a value for him, that he offered him his niece&nbsp;in marriage. His genius is admired in all his pictures ;&nbsp;his contours are free, his ordonnances magnificent, his&nbsp;deſigns correct, his figures elegant, his expreffiυns lively, his attitudes natural, his heads graceful ; in fine,&nbsp;every thing is beautiful, grand, ſublime, juſt, and adorn-ed with graces. Theſe various perfections he derived,&nbsp;not only from his excellent abilities, but from his ſtudy&nbsp;of antiquity and anatomy ; and from the friendſhip he&nbsp;contracted with Arioſto, who contributed not a little to&nbsp;the improvement of his taſte. His pictures are principally to be found in Italy and Paris. That of the&nbsp;Transfiguration, preſerved at Rome in the church of&nbsp;St Peter Monterio, paſſes for his mailer-piece.'
