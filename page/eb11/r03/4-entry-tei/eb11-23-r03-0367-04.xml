                <p><label>RITSCHL, ALBRECHT</label> (1822-1889), German theologian, was born at
                    Berlin on the 25th of March 1822. His father, Georg Karl Benjamin Ritschl
                    (1783-1858), became in 1810 pastor at the church of St Mary in Berlin, and from
                    1827 to 1854 was general superintendent and evangelical bishop of Pomerania.
                    Albrecht Ritschl studied at Bonn, Halle, Heidelberg and Tübingen. At Halle he
                    came under Hegelian influences through the teaching of Julius Schaller
                    (1810-1868) and J. H. Erdmann (b. 1805). In 1845 he was entirely captivated by
                    the Tübingen school, and in his work <hi rend="italic">Das Evangelium Marcions
                        und das kanonische Evangelium des Lukas,</hi> published in 1846, he appears
                    as a disciple of F. C. Baur. This did not last long with him, however, for the
                    second edition (1857) of his most important work, on the origin of the old
                    Catholic Church <hi rend="italic">(Die Entstehung der alt-kathol. Kirche),</hi>
                    shows considerable divergence from the first edition (1850), and reveals an
                    entire emancipation from F. C. Baur’s method. Ritschl was professor of theology
                    at Bonn (extraordinarius 1852; Ordinarius 1859) and Göttingen (1864; <hi
                        rend="italic">Consistorialrath</hi> also in 1874), his addresses on religion
                    delivered at the latter university showing the impression made upon his mind by
                    his enthusiastic studies of Kant and Schleiermacher. Finally, in 1864, came the
                    influence of Rudolf Lotze. He wrote a large work on the Christian doctrine of
                    justification and atonement, <hi rend="italic">Die Christliche Lehre von der
                        Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung,</hi> published during the years 1870-74, and
                    in 1880-86 a history of pietism <hi rend="italic">(Die Geschichte des
                        Pietismus).</hi> His system of theology is contained in the former. He died
                    at Gottingen on the 20th of March 1889.</p>
               <p>His son, <hi rend="smallcaps">Otto Ritschl</hi> (b. i860), after studying at
                    Gottingen, Bonn and Giessèn, became professor at Kiel (extraordinarius) in 1889
                    and afterwards at Bonn (extraordinarius 1894; Ordinarius 1897). He has
                    published, amongst other works, <hi rend="italic">Schleiermachers Stellung zum
                        Christentum in seinen Reden über die Religion</hi> (1888), and a <hi
                        rend="italic">Life</hi> of his father (2 vols., 1829-96).</p>
               <p>Ritschl claims to carry on the work of Luther and Schleiermacher, especially in
                    ridding faith of the tyranny of scholastic philosophy. His system shows the
                    influence of Kant’s destructive criticism of the claims of Pure Reason,
                    recognition of the value of morally conditioned knowledge, and doctrine of the
                    kingdom of ends; of Schleiermacher's historical treatment of Christianity,
                    regulative use of the idea of religious fellowship, emphasis on the importance
                    of religious feeling; and of Lotze’s theory of knowledge and treatment of
                    personality. Ritschl's work made a profound impression on German thought and
                    gave a new confidence to German theology, while at the same time it provoked a
                    storm of hostile criticism: his school has grown with remarkable rapidity. This
                    is perhaps mainly due to the bold religious positivism with which he assumes
                    that spiritual experience is real and that faith has not only a legitimate but
                    even a paramount claim to provide the highest interpretation of the world. The
                    life of trust in God is a fact, not so much to be explained as to explain
                    everything else. Ritschl's standpoint is not that of the individual subject. The
                    objective ground on which he bases his system is the religious experience of the
                    Christian community. The “ immediate object of theological knowledge is the
                    faith of the community,” and from this positive religious datum theology
                    constructs a “ total view of the world and human life.” Thus the essence of
                    Ritschl's work is systematic theology. Nor does he painfully work up to his
                    master-category, for it is given in the knowledge</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0368" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0391.jp2"/>
               <p>of Jesus Christ revealed to the community. That God is love and that the purpose
                    of His love is the moral organization of humanity in the “ Kingdom of God ”—this
                    idea, with its immense range of application—is applied in Ritschl's initial
                    datum.</p>
               <p>From this vantage-ground Ritschl criticizes the use of Aristotelianism and
                    speculative philosophy in scholastic and Protestant theology. He holds that such
                    philosophy is too shallow for theology. Hegelianism attempts to squeeze all life
                    into the categories of logic: Aristotelianism deals with “ things in general ”
                    and ignores the radical distinction between nature and spirit. Neither
                    Hegelianism nor Aristotelianism is “ vital ” enough to sound the depths of
                    religious life. Neither conceives “ God ” as correlative to human “ trust " (cf.
                        <hi rend="italic">Theologie und Metaphysik,</hi> esp. p. 8 seq.). But
                    Ritschl's recoil carries him so far that he is left alone with merely “
                    practical ” experience. “ Faith ” knows God in His active relation to the “
                    kingdom,” but not at all as “ self-existent.”</p>
               <p>His limitation of theological knowledge to the bounds of human need might, if
                    logically pressed, run perilously near phenomenalism ; and his epistemology (“
                    we only know things <hi rend="italic">in</hi> their activities ”) does not cover
                    this weakness. In seeking ultimate reality in the circle of “ active conscious
                    sensation,” he rules out all “ metaphysic.” Indeed, much that is part of normal
                    Christian faith— <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> the Eternity of the Son—is passed
                    over as beyond the range of his method. Ritschl's theory of ‘‘ value-judgments ”
                        <hi rend="italic">(Werthur-theile)</hi> illustrates this form of
                    agnosticism. Religious judgments of value determine objects according to their
                    bearing on our moral and spiritual welfare. They imply a lively sense of radical
                    human need. This sort of knowledge stands quite apart from that produced by “
                    theoretic ” and “ disinterested ” judgments. The former moves in a world of “
                    values,” and judges things as they are related to our “ fundamental
                    self-feeling. The latter moves in a world of cause and effect. <hi rend="italic"
                        >(N.B.</hi> Ritschl appears to confine Metaphysic to the category of
                    Causality.) The theory as formulated has such grave ambiguities, that his
                    theology, which, as we have seen, is wholly based on uncompromising religious
                    realism, has actually been charged with individualistic subjectivism. If Ritschl
                    had clearly shown that judgments of value enfold and transform other types of
                    knowledge, just as the “ spiritual man ” includes and transfigures but does not
                    annihilate the “ natural man,” then within the compass of this spiritually
                    conditioned knowledge all other knowledge would be seen to have a function and a
                    home. The theory of value-judgments is part too of his ultra-practical tendency:
                    both “ metaphysic ” and “ mysticism ” are ruthlessly condemned. Faith-knowledge
                    appears to be wrenched from its bearings and suspended in mid-ocean. Perhaps if
                    he had lived to see the progress of will-psychology he might have welcomed the
                    hope of a more spiritual philosophy.</p>
               <p>A few instances will illustrate Ritschl's positive systematic theology. The
                    conception of God as Father is given to the community in Revelation. He must be
                    regarded in His active relationship to the “kingdom” as spiritual personality
                    revealed in spiritual purposiveness. His “ Love ” is His will as directed
                    towards the realization of His purpose in the kingdom. His “ Righteousness ” is
                    His fidelity to this purpose. With God as “ First Cause ” or “ Moral
                    Legislator” theology has no. concern ; nor is it interested in the “
                    speculative ” problems indicated by the traditional doctrine of the Trinity. “
                    Natural theology ” has no value save where it leans on faith. Again, Christ has
                    for the religious life of the community the unique value of Founder and
                    Redeemer. . He is the perfect Revelation of God and the Exemplar of true
                    religion. His work in founding the kingdom was a personal vocation, the spirit
                    of which He communicates to believers, “ thus, as exalted king,” sustaining the
                    life of His Kingdom. His Resurrection is. a. necessary part of Christian belief
                    (G. Ecke, pp. 198-99). “Divinity” is a predicate applied by faith to Jesus in
                    His founding and redeeming activity. We note here that, though Ritschl gives
                    Jesus a unique and unapproachable position in His active relation to the
                    kingdom, he declines to rise above this relative teaching. The “ Two Nature ”
                    problem and the eternal relation of the Son to the Father have no bearing on
                    experience, and therefore stand outside the range of theology.</p>
               <p>Once more, in the doctrine of sin and redemption, the governing idea is God’s
                    fatherly purpose for His family. Sin is the contradiction of that purpose, and
                    guilt is alienation from the family. Redemption, justification, regeneration,
                    adoption, forgiveness, reconciliation all mean the same thing—the restoration of
                    the broken family relationship. All depends on the Mediation of Christ, who
                    maintained the filial relationship even to His death, and communicates it to the
                    brotherhood of Delievers. Everything is defined by the idea of the family. The
                    whole apparatus of “ forensic ” ideas (law, punishment, satisfaction,
                    &amp;c.) is summarily rejected as foreign to God’s purpose of love. Ritschl
                    is so faithful to the standpoint of the religious community, that he has nothing
                    definite to say on many inevitable questions, such as the relation of God to
                    pagan races. His school, in which J. G. W. Herrmann, Julius Kaftan and Adolf
                    Harnack are the chief names, diverges from his teaching in many directions; <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Kaftan appreciates the mystical side, of religion,
                    Harnack’s criticism is very different from Ritschl's arbitrary exegesis. They
                    are united on the value of faith-knowledge as opposed to “ metaphysic.”</p>
