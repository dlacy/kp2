<p><span class="font0">the 2-2-2. It is adapted for light, high-speed service, and noted for its simplicity, excellent riding qualities, low cost of maintenance,&nbsp;and high mechanical efficiency; but having limited adhesive weight&nbsp;it is unsuitable for starting and accelerating heavy trains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Four-coupled ” type, 4-4-0, with leading bogie truck.&nbsp;For many years this was practically the only one used in America&nbsp;for all traffic, and it is often spoken of as the “ American ” type.&nbsp;In America it is still the standard engine for passenger traffic, but&nbsp;for goods service it is now employed only on branch lines. It has&nbsp;been extensively introduced, both in Great Britain and the continent&nbsp;of Europe, for passenger traffic, and is now the most numerous and&nbsp;popular class. lt is a safe, steady-running and trustworthy engine,&nbsp;with excellent distribution of weight, and it is susceptible of a wide&nbsp;range of adaptability in power requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Four-coupled ” three-axle type, 2-4-0. Used to some extent&nbsp;in France and Germany and considerably in England for passenger&nbsp;traffic of moderate weight. Engines of this class, with 78-înch&nbsp;driving wheels and the leading axle fitted with Webb’s radial axle-box,&nbsp;for many years did excellent work on the London &amp; North-Western&nbsp;railway. The famous engine “ Charles Dickens ” was one of this&nbsp;class. Built in 1882, it had by the 12th of September 1891&nbsp;performed the feat of running a million miles in 9 years 219 days,&nbsp;and it completed two million miles on the 5th of August 1902,&nbsp;having by that date run 5312 trips with express trains between&nbsp;London and Manchester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Four-coupled ” three-axle type, with trailing axle, 0-4-2.&nbsp;Used on several English lines for fast passenger traffic, and also&nbsp;on many European railways. The advantages claimed for it arc:&nbsp;short coupling-rods, large and unlimited fire-box carried by a&nbsp;trailing axle, compactness, and great power for a given weight.&nbsp;Its critics, however, accuse it of lack of stability, and assert that&nbsp;the use of large leading wheels as drivers results in rigidity and&nbsp;produces destructive strains on the machinery and permanent way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Four-coupled ” type, with a leading bogie truck and a&nbsp;trailing axle, 4-4-2. It is used to a limited extent both in England&nbsp;and on the continent of Europe, and is rapidly increasing in favour&nbsp;in the United States, where it originated and is known as the&nbsp;“ Atlantic ” type. It has many advantages for heavy high-speed&nbsp;service, namely, large and well-proportioned boiler, practically&nbsp;unlimited grate area, fire-box of favourable proportions for firing,&nbsp;fairly, low centre of gravity, short coupling-rods, and, finally, a&nbsp;combination of the safe and smooth riding qualities of the four-coupled bogie type, with great steaming capacity and moderate&nbsp;axle loads. Occasionally a somewhat similar type is designed with&nbsp;the bogie under the fire-box and a single leading axle forward under&nbsp;the smoke-box—an arrangement in favour for suburban tank&nbsp;engines. In still rarer cases both a leading and a trailing bogie&nbsp;have been fitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Six-coupled ” with bogie, or “ Ten-wheel ” type, 4-6-0. A&nbsp;powerful engine for heavy passenger and fast goods service. It is&nbsp;used to a limited extent both in Great Britain and on the continent&nbsp;of Europe, but is much more common in America. The design&nbsp;combines ample boiler capacity with large adhesive weight and&nbsp;moderate axle loads, but except on heavy gradients or for unusually&nbsp;large trains requiring engines of great adhesion, passenger traffic&nbsp;can be more efficiently and economically handled by four-coupled&nbsp;locomotives of the eight-wheel or Atlantic types.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Six-coupled ” total-adhesion type (all the weight carried&nbsp;on the drivers), 0-6-0. This is the standard goods engine of Great&nbsp;Britain and the continent of Europe. In America the type is used&nbsp;only for shunting. It is a simple design of moderate boiler power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(8) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Six-coupled ” type, with a leading axle, 2-6-0. This is&nbsp;of American origin, and is there known as the “ Mogul. ” It is&nbsp;used largely in America for goods traffic. In Europe it is in considerable favour for goods and passenger traffic on heavy gradients.&nbsp;The type is, however, less in favour than either the ten-wheel or&nbsp;the eight-coupled “ Consolidation ” for freight traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(9) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Eight-coupled &quot; total-adhesion type, 0-8-0; now found&nbsp;on a good many English railways, and common on the continent&nbsp;of Europe for heavy slow goods traffic. In America it is comparatively&nbsp;infrequent, as total-adhesion types are not in favour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(10) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Eight-coupled ” type, with a leading axle, 2-8-0. This&nbsp;originated in America, where it is termed the “Consolidation. ”&nbsp;In the United States it is the standard heavy slow-speed freight&nbsp;engine, and has been built of enormous size and weight. The type&nbsp;has been introduced in Europe, especially in Germany, where the&nbsp;advantages of a partial-adhesion type in increased stability and a&nbsp;larger boiler are becoming appreciated. Occasionally the American&nbsp;eight-coupled type has a bogie instead of a single leading axle&nbsp;(4-8-0), and is then termed a “ Twelve-wheeler, ” or “ Mastodon. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(11) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Ten-coupled” type, with a leading axle, 2-10-0. This&nbsp;originated in America, where it is known as the “ Decapod. ” It&nbsp;is used to a limited extent for mountain-grade goods traffic, and has&nbsp;the advantage over the “ Consolidation” or eight-coupled type of&nbsp;lighter axle loads for a given tractive capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the foregoing list, various special locomotive types have been developed for suburban service, where high rates&nbsp;of acceleration and frequent stops are required. These are generally&nbsp;tank engines, carrying their fuel and water on the engine proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Their boilers are of relatively large proportions for the train weight and average speed, and the driving wheels of small diameter, a&nbsp;large proportion of their total weight being “ adhesive. ” Other&nbsp;special types are in limited use for “ rack-railways, ” and operate&nbsp;either by engagement of gearing on the locomotive into a rack&nbsp;between the track rails, or by a combination of this and rail adhesion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">§ 20. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Current Developments. —</span><span class="font1">The demand of the present day is for engines of larger power both for passenger and goods&nbsp;service, and the problem is to design such engines within the&nbsp;limitations fixed by the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge and the dimensions&nbsp;of the existing tunnels, arches, and other permanent works.&nbsp;The American engineer is more fortunately situated than his&nbsp;English brother with regard to the possibility of a solution,&nbsp;as will be seen from the comparative diagrams of construction&nbsp;gauges, figs. 23, 24, 25, 26. Fig. 23 shows the construction&nbsp;gauge for the London &amp; North-Western railway, fig. 24 that&nbsp;for the Great Western@@<sup>1</sup> railway, fig. 25 that for the Great Eastern&nbsp;railway, whilst fig. 26 gives a general idea of the American&nbsp;gauge in a particular case, generally typical, however, of the&nbsp;American limits. In consequence of this increasing demand&nbsp;for power, higher boiler pressures are being used, in some cases&nbsp;225 ℔ per sq. in, for a simple two-cylinder engine, and cylinder&nbsp;volume is slightly increased with the necessary accompaniment of heavier loads on the coupled wheels to give the&nbsp;necessary adhesion. Both load and speed have increased&nbsp;so much in connexion with passenger  trains that it is&nbsp;necessary to divide the weight required for adhesion between&nbsp;three-coupled axles, and the type of engine gradually coming&nbsp;into use in England for heavy express traffic is a six-coupled&nbsp;engine with a leading bogie, with wheels which would have&nbsp;been considered small a few years ago for the speed at which&nbsp;the engine runs. The same remarks apply to goods engines.&nbsp;There is a general increase in cylinder power, boiler pressure&nbsp;and weight, and in consequence in the number of coupled axles.&nbsp;Not only are the load and speed increasing, but the distances&nbsp;run without a stop are increasing also, and to avoid increasing&nbsp;the size of the tenders, water-troughs, first instituted by&nbsp;J. Ramsbottom on the London &amp; North-Western railway&nbsp;in 1859, have been laid in the tracks of the leading main&nbsp;lines of Great Britain. For local services where stoppages&nbsp;are frequent the demand is for engines capable of quickly</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup>At the beginning of 1908 the Great Western’s loading gauge on its main lines was widened to 9 ft. 8'in. from a height of 5 ft. above&nbsp;rail level.</span></p>
