The radial tubes may branch, <hi rend="italic">Heteropegma</hi> (fig. 4). If the branches are given off regularly, as the radial tubes were in the first plan, and if at the same time the original radial tube exchanges its flagellated for a pavement epithelium, a structure as shown in fig. 6 <hi rend="italic">(Polejna</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">connexiva,</hi> Pol.) will result. This form might also be brought about by unequal growth of the gastral endoderm leading to a folding of the inner part of the sponge-wall. Very little direct evidence exists as to which of these two plans has actually been followed. Phylogenetically the transition from a simple Ascon to the most complicated Sycon can be traced step by step ; and ontogeny shows that such a Sycon form as <hi rend="italic">Grantia raphanus</hi> passes through an Ascon phase in the course of its larval development.</p><p>Returning to the ancestral form of sponge, <hi rend="italic">Olynthus, </hi>let us conceive the endoderm growing out into a number of approximately spherical chambers, each of which communicates with the exterior by a prosopyle and with the paragastric cavity by a comparatively large aperture, which we may term for distinction an <hi rend="italic">apopyle</hi>; at the same time let the endoderm lose its flagellated character and become</p><p>converted into a pavement epithelium, except in the spherical chambers. Such a form, called by Haeckel “ dyssycus,” may be more briefly named a <hi rend="italic">Rhagon</hi> from the grape-like form of its flagellated chambers, which differ from those of a Sycon both by their form and their smaller dimensions. The Rhagon occurs as a stage in the early development of <hi rend="italic">Plakina monolopha</hi> (Schulze) and <hi rend="italic">Reniera fertilis</hi> (<hi rend="italic">9</hi>) (fig. 7) ; a calcareous sponge which appears to</p><p>approach it somewhat is <hi rend="italic">Leucopsis pedunculata,</hi> Lfd. By the folding of the wall of a Rhagon, or by its outgrowth into lobes, a complicated structure such as that of <hi rend="italic">Plakina monolopha (20)</hi> (see fig. 26 <hi rend="italic">f</hi>) results. This is characterized by the chambers retaining their immediate communication with the incurrent and excurrent canals, opening into the latter by the widely open apopyle and receiving the former by one or</p><p>several prosopyles. This</p><p>may be termed the <hi rend="italic">eury-</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">pylous</hi> type of Rhagon</p><p>canal system. The fold</p><p>ing of the sponge-wall</p><p>may be simple, as in the</p><p>example given, or too</p><p>complex to unravel. In</p><p>higher forms of sponges</p><p><hi rend="italic">(Geodinidæ, Stellettidge)</hi></p><p>the chambers cease to</p><p>open abruptly into the</p><p>excurrent canals : each is</p><p>prolonged into a narrow</p><p>canal, <hi rend="italic">aphodus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">abitus,</hi></p><p>which usually directly,</p><p>sometimes after uniting</p><p>with one or more of its</p><p>fellows, opens into an</p><p>excurrent canal. The</p><p>prosopyles, now restrict</p><p>ed to one for each chamber, may remain unchanged in character, or at the most be prolonged into very short</p></body></text></TEI>
