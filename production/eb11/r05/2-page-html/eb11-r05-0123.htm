<p><span class="font1">The effects of emigration and immigration cannot be estimated with accuracy, because only those who cross the frontier with passports are taken account of. The statistics of these show that there&nbsp;was during the thirty-two years, 1856-88, an excess of emigration&nbsp;over immigration of 1,146,052 in the case of Russians, and a surplus&nbsp;of immigration of 2,304,717 foreigners. On the other hand, in the&nbsp;six years, 1892-97, the excess of Russian emigration over immigration was 207,353, as compared with an excess of foreign immigration&nbsp;over emigration of only 136,740.. During the years 1900-4 inclusive&nbsp;the total emigrants from Russia numbered 2,358,539, of whom&nbsp;1,144,246 were Russians; while the immigrants numbered 2,333,053,&nbsp;of whom 1,432,057 were foreigners. It is also known that the&nbsp;number of Russian immigrants into the United States in 1891-1902&nbsp;was 742,869, as compared with 313,469 in 1873-90, or a grand total&nbsp;since 1873 of 1,056,338. By far the greater part of these were</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">J</span><span class="font1">ews. The emigration to Siberia varies much from year to year, It was 26,129 in 1888, and 60,000 in 1898. During the two following&nbsp;years it amounted to an average of over 160,000, but in the years&nbsp;1901-3 to an average of 84,638 per annum. Altogether some&nbsp;800,000 peasants are estimated to have settled in Siberia during&nbsp;the period 1886-96, but during the years 1893-1905 no less than&nbsp;four millions in all. There is also some emigration from central&nbsp;Russia to the S. Urals, as well as to some of the steppe governments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Within the empire a very great diversity of nationalities is comprised, due to the amalgamation or absorption by the Slav race of a variety of Ural-Altaic stocks, of Turko-Tatars, Turko-Mongols and&nbsp;various Caucasian races. In some cases their ethnical relations have&nbsp;not yet been completely determined. According to the results&nbsp;obtained by the census committee of 1897, working on a linguistic&nbsp;basis, the distribution of races was as given in the table opposite : @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Taken as a whole, only 13% of the population of Russia lived in towns in 1897, but in the years 1857-60 less than 10% was urban.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Russia proper less than 2% emigrated from the</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">There were in European Russia and Poland only twelve cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants in 1884; in 1900 there were sixteen,&nbsp;namely, St Petersburg, Moscow, Warsaw, Odessa, Lodz, Riga, Kiev,&nbsp;Kharkov, Vilna, Saratov, Kazan, Ekaterinoslav, Rostov-on-the Don,&nbsp;Astrakhan, Tula and Kishinev. In other parts of the empire there&nbsp;were four cities each having over 100,000 inhabitants in that year,&nbsp;namely, Baku, Tiflis, Tashkent and Helsingfors. While only three&nbsp;of these are in middle Russia (Moscow, Tula and Kazan), eight are&nbsp;in S. Russia. There are thirty-four cities in European Russia and&nbsp;Poland, and forty in the entire empire, with from 50,000 to 100,000&nbsp;inhabitants each. The rural population live for the most part in&nbsp;villages, not as a rule scattered about the country. In the inclement&nbsp;regions of the N. and in the N. parts of the forest zone the villages&nbsp;are very small. They are larger, but still small, in White Russia,&nbsp;Lithuania and the region </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the lakes; but in the steppe governments&nbsp;they are very appreciably bigger, some of the Cossack </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stanitsas</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;settlements exceeding 20,000, and many of them numbering more&nbsp;than 10,000 inhabitants each. The houses are generally built of wood&nbsp;and wear a poverty-stricken aspect. Owing to the great risks from&nbsp;fire the villages usually cover a large area of ground, and the houses&nbsp;are scattered and straggling. The mortality in most towns is so&nbsp;great that during the last ten years of the 19th century, in a very&nbsp;great number of cities, the deaths exceeded the births by 1 to 4 in&nbsp;the thousand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(P.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Government and Administration.—</span><span class="font1">Russia was described in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Almanach de Gotha</span><span class="font1"> for 1910 as “ a constitutional monarchy&nbsp;under an autocratic tsar.” This obvious contradiction in&nbsp;terms well illustrates the difficulty of defining in a single formula&nbsp;the system, essentially transitional and meanwhile </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui generis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">established in the Russian empire since October 1905. Before&nbsp;this date the fundamental laws of Russia described the power&nbsp;of the emperor as “ autocratic and unlimited.” The imperial&nbsp;style is still “Emperor and Autocrat of AU the Russias ”;&nbsp;but in the fundamental laws as remodeUed between the imperial&nbsp;manifesto of 17/30 October and the opening of the first </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Duma</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">on the 27th of April 1906, while the name and principle of autocracy was jealously preserved, the word “ unlimited ”&nbsp;vanished. Not that the régime in Russia had become in any&nbsp;true sense constitutionaI, far less parliamentary; but the&nbsp;“ unlimited autocracy ” had given place to a “ self-limited&nbsp;autocracy,” whether permanently so limited, or only at the&nbsp;discretion of the autocrat, remaining a subject of heated controversy between conflicting parties in the state. @@<sup>2</sup> Provisionally,&nbsp;then, the Russian governmental system may perhaps be best&nbsp;defined—as M. Chasles suggests @@<sup>3</sup>—as “ a limited monarchy&nbsp;under an autocratic emperor.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the head of the government is the emperor, @@<sup>4</sup> whose power is limited only by the provisions of the fundamental laws of&nbsp;the empire. Of these some are ancient and undisputed: the empire may not be partitioned, but&nbsp;descends entire in order of primogeniture, and by&nbsp;preference to the male heir; the emperor and his consort must&nbsp;belong to the Eastern Orthodox Church; the emperor can&nbsp;wear no crown that entails residence abroad. By the manifesto of the 17/3oth of October 1905 the emperor voluntarily&nbsp;limited his legislative power by decreeing that no measure&nbsp;was to become law without the consent of the Imperial Duma,&nbsp;a freely elected national assembly. By the law of the 20th&nbsp;of February 1906 the Council of the Empire was associated&nbsp;with the Duma as a legislative Upper House; and from this&nbsp;time the legislative power has been exercised normally by the&nbsp;emperor only in concert with the two chambers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Council of the Empire, or Imperial Council </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Gosudar-slvenniy Sovyet)</span><span class="font1">, as reconstituted for this purpose, consists of 196 members, of whom 98 are nominated by the emperor,&nbsp;while 98 are elective. The ministers, also nominated,&nbsp;are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex officio</span><span class="font1"> members. Of the elected members&nbsp;3 are returned by the “ black ” clergy (the monks),</span></p>

As a legislative body the powers&nbsp;of the Council are co-ordinate with those of the Duma; in&nbsp;practice, however, it has seldom if ever initiated legislation. @@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Duma of the Empire or Imperial Duma </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Gosudarstvennaya Duma),</span><span class="font1"> which forms the Lower House of the Russian parliament, consists (since the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ukaz</span><span class="font1"> of the 2nd of June 1907)&nbsp;of 442 members, elected by an exceedingly complicated&nbsp;process, so manipulated as to secure an overwhelming&nbsp;preponderance for the wealthy, and especially the landed classes,&nbsp;and also for the representatives of the Russian as opposed to&nbsp;the subject peoples. Each province of the empire, except the&nbsp;now disfranchised steppes of Central Asia, @@<sup>7</sup> returns a&nbsp;certain proportion of members (fixed in each case by&nbsp;law in such a way as to give a preponderance to the&nbsp;Russian element), in addition to those returned bv certain of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

The members of the Opposition, on the other&nbsp;hand, quoting Art. 84 of the fundamental, laws (“The. empire is&nbsp;governed on the immutable basis of laws issued according to the&nbsp;established order argued that the emperor himself could only&nbsp;act within the limits of the order established by those laws. It&nbsp;is noteworthy that even the third Duma in its.address to the throne,&nbsp;if it avoided the tabooed word “ Constitution,” avoided also all&nbsp;mention of autocracy.</span></p>
