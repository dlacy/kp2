<p><span class="font0">in 1722. Voltaire’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Pour et le contre</span><span class="font0"> is said to have shocked Rousseau, who expressed his sentiments freely. At any rate the&nbsp;latter had thenceforward no fiercer enemy than Voltaire. His&nbsp;death elicited from Lefranc de Pompignan an ode of real excellence&nbsp;and perhaps better than anything of Rousseau’s own work. . That&nbsp;work is divided, roughly speaking, into two contrasted divisions.&nbsp;One consists of formal and partly sacred odes and cantatas of the&nbsp;stiffest character, of which perhaps the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oâe à la fortune</span><span class="font0"> is the most&nbsp;famous; the other of brief epigrams, sometimes licentious and&nbsp;always, or almost always, ill-natured. As an epigrammatist Rousseau is only inferior to his friend Alexis Piron. In the former he&nbsp;stands almost alone. The frigidity of conventional diction and the&nbsp;disuse of all really lyrical rhythm which characterize his period do&nbsp;not prevent his odes and cantatas from showing at times true&nbsp;poetical faculty, though cramped, and inadequate to explain his&nbsp;extraordinary vogue. Few writers were so frequently reprinted&nbsp;during the 18th century, but even in his own century La Harpe had&nbsp;arrived at a truer estimate of his real value when he said of. his&nbsp;poetry: “ Le fond n’est qu’un lieu commun chargé de déclamations&nbsp;et même d’idées fausses.*<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides the Soleure edition mentioned above Rousseau, published another issue of his work in London in 1723. The chief edition&nbsp;since is that of j. A. Amar (5 vols., 1820), preceded by a notice of his&nbsp;life. M. A. de Latour published (1869) a useful though not complete&nbsp;edition, with notes and a biographical introduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUSSEAU, JEAN JACQUES (1712-1778), French philosopher, was born at Geneva on the 28th June 1712. His family had established themselves in that city at the time of the&nbsp;religious wars, but they were of pure French origin. Rousseau’s father Isaac was a watchmaker; his mother, Suzanne&nbsp;Bernard, was the daughter of a minister; she died in childbirth, and Rousseau, who was the second son, was brought up&nbsp;in a haphazard fashion, his father being dissipated, violent-tempered and foolish. But he early taught his son to read,&nbsp;and seems to have laid the foundation of the flighty sentimentalism in morals and politics which Rousseau afterwards illustrated&nbsp;with his genius. When the boy was ten years old his father&nbsp;got entangled in a dispute with a fellow-citizen, and being&nbsp;condemned to a short term of imprisonment abandoned Geneva&nbsp;and took refuge at Lyons. The father and son henceforth&nbsp;rarely met. Rousseau was taken charge of by his mother’s&nbsp;relations and was committed to the tutorship of M. Lambercier,&nbsp;pastor at Boissy. In 1724 he was removed from this school&nbsp;and taken into the house of his uncle Bernard, by whom he was&nbsp;shortly afterwards apprenticed to a notary. His master, however, found or thought him incapable and sent him back.&nbsp;After a short time (April 25, 1725) he was apprenticed afresh,&nbsp;this time to an engraver. He did not dislike the work, but was&nbsp;or thought himself cruelly treated. In 1728 he ran away, the&nbsp;truancy being by his own account unintentional in the first&nbsp;instance, and due to the fact of the city gates being shut earlier&nbsp;than usual. Then began an extraordinary series of wanderings and adventures, for much of which there is no authority&nbsp;but his cwn </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions.</span><span class="font0"> He first fell in with some proselytizers&nbsp;of the Roman faith at Confignon in Savoy, and by them he was&nbsp;sent to Madame de Warens at Annecy, a young and pretty&nbsp;widow who was herself a convert. Her influence, however,&nbsp;which was to be so great, was not immediately exercised, and&nbsp;he was passed on to Turin, where there was an institution&nbsp;specially devoted to the reception of neophytes. His experiences here were unsatisfactory, but he abjured duly and was&nbsp;rewarded by being presented with twenty francs and senj&nbsp;about his business. He wandered about in Turin for some&nbsp;time, and at last established himself as footman to a Madame&nbsp;de Vercellis. Here occurred the famous incident of the theft&nbsp;of a ribbon, of which he accused a girl fellow-servant. But,&nbsp;though he kept his place by this piece of cowardice,&nbsp;Madame de Vercellis died not long afterwards and he was&nbsp;turned off. He found another place with the Comte de Gouvon,&nbsp;but lost this also through coxcombry. Then he resolved to&nbsp;return to Madame de Warens at Annecy. The chronology of&nbsp;all these events, as narrated by himself, is somewhat obscure,&nbsp;but they seem to have occupied about three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even then Rousseau did not settle at once in the anomalous but to him charming position of domestic lover to this lady,&nbsp;who, nominally a converted Protestant, was in reality, as many&nbsp;women of her time were, a kind of deist, with a theory of noble&nbsp;sentiment and a practice of libertinism tempered by good nature.&nbsp;It used to be held that in her conjugal relations she was more&nbsp;sinned against than sinning. But modern investigations seem&nbsp;to show that M. de Vuarrens (which is said to be the correct&nbsp;spelling of the name) was an unfortunate husband, and was&nbsp;deserted and robbed by his wife. However, she welcomed&nbsp;Rousseau kindly, thought it necessary to complete his education,&nbsp;and he was sent to the seminarists of St Lazare to be improved&nbsp;in classics, and also to a music master. In one of his incomprehensible freaks he set off for Lyons, and, after abandoning&nbsp;his companion in an epileptic fit, returned to Annecy to find&nbsp;Madame de Warens gone. Then for some months he relapsed&nbsp;into the life of vagabondage, varied by improbable adventures,&nbsp;which (according to his own statement) he so often pursued.&nbsp;Hardly knowing anything of music, he attempted to give&nbsp;lessons and a concert at Lausanne; and he actually taught&nbsp;at Neuchâtel. 'Then he became, or says he became, secretary&nbsp;to a Greek archimandrite who was travelling in Switzerland&nbsp;to collect subscriptions for the rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre; then he went to Paris, and, with recommendations from&nbsp;the French ambassador at Soleure, saw something of good&nbsp;society; then he returned on foot through Lyons to Savoy,&nbsp;hearing that Madame dc Warens was at Chambéry. This was&nbsp;in 1732, and Rousseau, who for a time had unimportant employments in the service of the Sardinian crown, was shortly installed by Madame de Warens, whom he still called Maman, as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">amant en titre</span><span class="font0"> in her singular household, wherein she diverted&nbsp;herself with him, -with music and with chemistry. In 1736&nbsp;Madame de Warens, partly for Rousseau’s health, took a country&nbsp;house, Les Charmettes, a short distance from Chambéry. Here&nbsp;in summer, and in the town during winter, Rousseau led a delightful life, which he has delightfully described. In a desultory&nbsp;way he did a good deal of reading, but in 1738 his health again&nbsp;became bad, and he was recommended to go to Montpellier.&nbsp;By his own account this journey to Montpellier was in reality a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">voyage à Cythère</span><span class="font0"> in company with a certain Madame de Lar-nage. This being so, he could hardly complain when on returning he found that his official position in Madame de Warens’s&nbsp;household had been taken by a person named Vintzenried.&nbsp;He was, however, less likely than most men to endure the&nbsp;position of second in command, and in 1740 he became tutor&nbsp;at Lyons to the children of M. de Mably, not the well-known&nbsp;writer of that name, but his and Condillac’s elder brother. But&nbsp;Rousseau did not like teaching and was a bad teacher, and after&nbsp;a visit to Les Charmettes, finding .that his place there was finally&nbsp;occupied, he once more went to Paris in 1741. He was not&nbsp;without recommendations. But a new system of musical&nbsp;notation which he thought he had discovered was unfavourably&nbsp;received by the Académie des sciences, where it was read in&nbsp;August 1742, and he was unable to obtain pupils. Madame&nbsp;Dupin, however, to whose house he had obtained the entry, procured him the honourable if not very lucrative post of secretary&nbsp;to M. de Montaigu, ambassador at Venice. With him he stayed&nbsp;for about eighteen months, and has as usual infinite complaints&nbsp;to make of his employer and some strange stories to tell. At&nbsp;length he threw up his situation and returned to Paris (1745).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Up to this time—that is to say, till his thirty-third year-— Rousseau’s life, though continuously described by himself, was&nbsp;of the kind called subterranean, and the account of it must&nbsp;be taken with considerable allowances. From this time, however, he is more or less in view; and, though at least two events&nbsp;of his life—his quarrel with Diderot and his death—aresubjects&nbsp;of dispute, its general history can be checked and followed with&nbsp;reasonable confidence. On his return to Paris he renewed his&nbsp;relations with the Dupin family and with the literary group of&nbsp;Diderot, to which he had already been introduced by M. de&nbsp;Mably’s letters. He had an opera, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Muses galantes</span><span class="font0">, privately&nbsp;represented; he copied music for money, and received from&nbsp;Madame Dupin and her son-in-law M. de Francueil a small but&nbsp;regular salary as secretary. He lived at the Hotel St Quentin&nbsp;for a time, and once more arranged for himself an equivocal</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
