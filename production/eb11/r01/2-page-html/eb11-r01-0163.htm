<p><span class="font2">RAVENNA, EXARCHATE OF, the official name of that part of Italy which remained in the allegiance of the Roman&nbsp;emperors at Constantinople from the closing years of the 6th&nbsp;to the middle of the 8th century. The civil and military head&nbsp;of these possessions, the exarch (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.υ</span><span class="font2">.), was stationed at Ravenna.&nbsp;The territory round the town, from the southern border of&nbsp;the modern Venetia to the beginning of the Pentapolis at&nbsp;Rimini, was under his direct administration and formed in&nbsp;a limited sense the exarchate. The other provinces were&nbsp;governed by dukes and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">magistri militum,</span><span class="font2"> titles which were&nbsp;generally, but not always, borne by the same person. But as&nbsp;all were subject to his authority, they were included in the&nbsp;exarchate of Ravenna, which was therefore another name for&nbsp;the province of Italy. The borders of these dominions varied&nbsp;according to the fortunes of the imperial authority in its long&nbsp;struggle with the Lombards. Sicily formed a separate government. Corsica and Sardinia belonged to the exarchate of&nbsp;Africa. The reorganization of the province of Italy into&nbsp;the exarchate was forced on the emperors by tbe Lombard&nbsp;invasion, which began in 568, and their permanent settlement.&nbsp;The Lombards thrust a wedge into Italy. Its base was in&nbsp;Venetia, and its point was advanced to the Tiber. From the&nbsp;early days of the conquest they spread to the south, and established the duchies of Spoletum and Beneventum in the modern&nbsp;kingdom of Naples. They may thus be said to have hollowed&nbsp;out the imperial, or Byzantine, possessions in Italy, the interior&nbsp;being under their power, and the coast remaining to the imperial&nbsp;officers. This illustration, however, is subject to two serious&nbsp;exceptions. As the Lombards spread they came into pos-session of many parts of the coast. Then a belt of imperial&nbsp;territory stretching from Rimini on the Adriatic, S.W. to the&nbsp;mouth of the Tiber, and including the duchies of Perugia and&nbsp;Rome, served to unite the immediate territory of Ravenna&nbsp;with the duchy of Naples, and to separate the two bodies&nbsp;under Lombard dominion, the kingdom in the north, and&nbsp;the southern duchies Spoletum and Beneventum. The&nbsp;organization of the exarchate is placed by modern investigators under the reign of the emperor Maurice (582-602), when&nbsp;the imperial government began to recognize the necessity of&nbsp;providing for a new and a long struggle. At the end of the&nbsp;6th century the exarchate included Istria; the maritime&nbsp;part of Venetia as distinct from the interior which was in the&nbsp;hands of the Lombard kings at Pavia; the exarchate proper,&nbsp;or territory around Ravenna on the eastern side of the&nbsp;Apennines, to which was added Calabria, which at that period&nbsp;meant the heel and not the toe of the boot; the Pentapolis,&nbsp;or coast from Rimini to Ancona with the interior as far as the&nbsp;mountains; the duchy of Rome, or belt of territory connecting&nbsp;the Pentapolis with the western coast, the coast of Naples,&nbsp;with Bruttium the toe of the boot, the modern Calabria, and&nbsp;Liguria, or the Riviera of Genoa. The Piedmont, Lombardy,&nbsp;mainland of Venetia, Tuscany and the interior of Naples belonged to the Lombards. The advance of these barbarians&nbsp;was for a time checked during the anarchy which followed&nbsp;the death of Alboin, and was subject to other suspensions.&nbsp;The superior organization of the imperial government enabled&nbsp;it to regain lost territory and delay complete ruin. In 590&nbsp;the empire regained much of Venetia. But these revivals were&nbsp;not permanent. The superiority of the empire was a mechanical&nbsp;one, and during the two centuries or so that the exarchate&nbsp;lasted it lost ground. In 640 the Ligurian seacoast fell under&nbsp;the power of the Lombards, and ceased to be an imperial pro-vince. About a century later the exarchate had been greatly&nbsp;reduced, though the imperial officials endeavoured to conceal&nbsp;the fact by retaining and transferring names when the reality&nbsp;of possession was lost. About 740 it consisted of Istria,&nbsp;Venetia (the maritime portion of which was ceasing to be a&nbsp;province and was becoming a protected state, the forerunner&nbsp;of the future republic of Venice), Ferrara, Ravenna (the&nbsp;exarchate in the limited sense), Pentapolis, Perusia, Rome,&nbsp;the coast of Naples and Calabria (in the sense of the toe and&nbsp;not the heel of the boot) which was being overrun by the Lombards of the duchy of Beneventum, which with Spoletum held&nbsp;the interior. In Rome the pope was the real master. These&nbsp;fragments of the “ province of Italy,&quot; as it was when reconquered by Justinian, were almost all lost either to the Lombards, who finally conquered Ravenna itself about 750, or by&nbsp;the revolt of the pope, who separated from the empire on&nbsp;account of the iconoclastic reforms. The intervention of Pippin&nbsp;the Carolingian, who was called in by the popes to protect them&nbsp;against the Lombards and the Eastern emperors alike, made a&nbsp;revival of the exarchate impossible. It disappeared, and the&nbsp;small remnants of the imperial possessions on the mainland,&nbsp;Naples and Calabria, passed under the authority of the “ patricius ” of Sicily, and when Sicily was conquered by the Arabs&nbsp;in the 10th century were erected into the themes of Calabria&nbsp;and Langobardia. Istria was attached to Dalmatia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In its internal history the exarchate was subject to the influences which were everywhere, in central and western&nbsp;Europe at least, leading to the subdivision of sovereignty&nbsp;and the establishment of feudalism. Step by step, and in&nbsp;spite of the efforts of the emperors at Constantinople, the&nbsp;great imperial officials became landowners, the owners of land&nbsp;—kinsmen or at least associates of these officials—intruded on&nbsp;the imperial administration, while the necessity for providing&nbsp;for the defence of the imperial territories against the Lombards&nbsp;led to the formation of local militias, who at first were attached&nbsp;to the imperial regiments, but gradually became independent.&nbsp;These armed men formed the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">exercitus romance militiae,</span><span class="font2"> who&nbsp;were the forerunners of the free armed burghers of the Italian&nbsp;cities of the middle ages. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">exercitus</span><span class="font2"> of Rome was divided&nbsp;into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">scholae,</span><span class="font2"> and had a chief or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patronus,</span><span class="font2"> and its banner. Other&nbsp;cities of the exarchate were organized on the same model.&nbsp;Diehl is of opinion that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">exercitus</span><span class="font2"> was formed of the ancient&nbsp;“ possessores,” or landowners and free townsmen, who were&nbsp;of a less rank than the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ordo senatorius.</span><span class="font2"> The great landowners&nbsp;who were developing into feudal lords, and the smaller freemen&nbsp;who were becoming independent burghers, broke the imperial&nbsp;administration to pieces, and prepared the way for the final&nbsp;ruin of the exarchate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RAVENSBURG, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Württemberg, pleasantly situated amid vine-clad hills on the&nbsp;river Schussen, 12 m. N. of Friedrichshafen on the lake of&nbsp;Constance, by the railway of Ulm. Pop. (1905) 14,614, the&nbsp;great majority of whom are Roman Catholics. Its aspect is&nbsp;medieval; it still retains its walls and nine picturesque towers,&nbsp;the most prominent of which, dating from the 15th century,&nbsp;is known as the “ Mehlsack,” or sack of flour. The town hall&nbsp;is a handsome 15th-century building. The manufactures&nbsp;include linen, cotton, embroidered muslins, pottery, glass and&nbsp;playing-cards. The fruit market is important, and there is&nbsp;trade in cattle, grain and timber. Ravensburg was founded&nbsp;in the nth century by the Guelphs, and in their ancestral&nbsp;castle on the Veitsburg, which was partially restored in 1892,&nbsp;the Saxon duke, Henry the Lion, was born. In 1180 the town&nbsp;passed to the Hohenstaufens, and a century later it became&nbsp;a free town of the Empire. In the 15th century it was a&nbsp;flourishing commercial place, its chief industry being the&nbsp;manufacture of paper. Annexed to Bavaria from 1803 to 1810,&nbsp;it was ceded to Württemberg in the latter year.</span></p>
