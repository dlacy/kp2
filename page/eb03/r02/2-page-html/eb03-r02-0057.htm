<p><span class="font0">it decreaſes in the different filaments, from the axis or moſt rapid filament to the border ; and the connection&nbsp;of this with the mean velocity, which is expreſſed by&nbsp;our formula. 3√, Having acquired ſome diſtinct notions of this, we ſhall be able to ſee the manner in which&nbsp;undiſturbed nature works in forming the beds of our rivers, the ſorms which ſhe affects, and which we&nbsp;muſt imitate in all their local modifications, if we would&nbsp;ſecure that permanency which is the evident aim of all&nbsp;her operations. We ſhall here learn the mutual action&nbsp;of the current and its bed, and the circumſtances which&nbsp;enſure the ſtability of both. Theſe we may call the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regimen</span><span class="font0"> or the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">confirmation</span><span class="font0"> of the ſtream, and may ſay&nbsp;that it is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in regimen,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in confirmation.</span><span class="font0"> This has a relation, not to the dimenſioris and the ſtope alone, or to&nbsp;the accelerating force and the reſiſtance ariſing from&nbsp;mere inertia ; it reſpects immediately the tenacity of the&nbsp;bed, and is different from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">th,</span><span class="font0"> Theſe pieces of information will explain the deviation of rivers from the rectilineal courſe ; the reſiſtance occaſioned by theſe deviations ; and the circumſtan-ees on which the regimen of a winding ſtream depends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ÿ I. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Of the Forms of the Channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The numerator of the fraction which expreſſes the velocity of a river in train has √7 for one of its factors. 'Γhat form, thereſore, is moſt favourable to the&nbsp;motion which gives the greateſt value to what we have&nbsp;called the hydraulic mean depth </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font0"> This is the prerogative of the ſemicircle, and here </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> is equal to half the&nbsp;radius ; and all other figures of the ſame area are the&nbsp;more favourable, as they approach nearer to a ſemicircle.- This is the form, therefore, of all conduit pipes,&nbsp;and ſhould be taken for aqueducts which are built of&nbsp;maſonry. Eaſe and accuracy of execution, however,&nbsp;have made engineers prefer a rectangular form ; but&nbsp;neither of theſe will do for a channel formed out of the&nbsp;ground. W e ſhall ſoon ſee that the ſemicircle is incompatible with a regimen ; and, if we proceed through the&nbsp;regular polygons, we ſhall find that the half hexagon is&nbsp;the only one which has any pretentions to a regimen ;&nbsp;yet experience ſhows us, that even its banks are too&nbsp;ſteep for almoſt any foil. A dry earthen bank, not&nbsp;bound together by graſs roots, will hardly ſtand with a&nbsp;ſlope of 45 degrees; and a canal which conveys running&nbsp;waters will not ſtand with this ſlope. Banks whoſe&nbsp;baſe is to their height as 4 to 3 will ſtand very well in&nbsp;moiſt foils, and this is a ſlope very uſually given. This&nbsp;form is even affected in the ſpontaneous operations of&nbsp;nature, in the channels which ſhe digs for the rills and&nbsp;rivulets in the higher and ſteeper grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This form has ſome mathematical and mechanical properties which intitle it to ſome further notice. Let&nbsp;ABEC (fig. ιι.) be ſuch a trapezium, and AHGC&nbsp;the rectangle of equal width and depth. Biſect HB&nbsp;and EG by the verticals FD and KI, and draw the&nbsp;verticals </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> B, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> E. Becauſe AH : HB= 3 :4, we have&nbsp;AB = 5, andBD=2, and FD 3, and BDſt-DF=&nbsp;BA. From theſe premiſſes it follows, that the trapezium ABEC has the ſame area with the rectangle; for&nbsp;HB being biſected in D, the triangles ACF, BCD&nbsp;are equal. Alſo the border ABEC, which is touched&nbsp;by the paſſing ſtream, is equal to FDIK. Therefore&nbsp;the mean depth, which is the quotient of the area divided by the border, </span><span class="font1">is the ſame in both j and this 14the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">caſe, whatever is the width BE at the bottom, or even though there be no rectangle ſuch as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> BEe interpoſed&nbsp;between the ſlant ſides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of all rectangles, that whoſe breadth is twice the height, or which is half of a ſquare, gives the greateſt&nbsp;mean depth. If, therefore, FK be double of&lt;FD, the&nbsp;trapezium ABEC, which has the ſame area, will have&nbsp;the largeſt mean depth of any ſuch trapezium, and will&nbsp;be the belt form of a channel for conveying running waters. In this caſe, we have AC = 10, AH=</span></p>
    <p><span class="font0">3, and BE~2. Or we may ſay that the bell form is a trapezium, whoſe bottom width is -∣- of the depth,&nbsp;and whoſe extreme width is ∙<sup>i</sup><sub>j</sub>-. This form approaches&nbsp;very near to that which the torrents in the hills naturally dig for themſelves in uniform ground, where their&nbsp;action is not checked by ſtones which they lay bare, or&nbsp;which they depoſit in their courſe. This ſhows us, and&nbsp;it will be fully confirmed by and by, that the channel&nbsp;of a river is not a fortuitous thing, but has a relation&nbsp;to the conſiſtency of the foil and velocity of the&nbsp;ſtream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A rectangle, whoſe breadth is y of the depth of water, will therefore have the ſame mean depth with </span><span class="font1">a. </span><span class="font0">triangle whoſe ſurſace width is ∣ of its vertical depth ;&nbsp;for this is the dimenſions when the rectangle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> BEe is&nbsp;taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let A be the area of the ſection of any channel, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">τυ </span><span class="font0">its width (when rectangular), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font0"> its depth of water»&nbsp;Then what we have called its mean depth, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font0"> will ſhe</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:line-through;">———~l<sup>iυ</sup>A</span><span class="font0">, Or if </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font0"> expreſſes the ratio of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">W+2Ä w+2i &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>r</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">width to the depth of a rectangular bed ; that is, if</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">w</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q~~r,</span><span class="font0"> we have <sup>a ver</sup>y ſimple and ready expreſſion for</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the mean depth, either from the width or depth. For</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">, <sup>r</sup>zυ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, qh</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">7+2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q+2</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Therefore, if the depth were infinite, and the width</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">finite, we ſhould have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d-~∙,</span><span class="font0"> or if the width be infi-2</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">nite, and the depth finite, we have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d ~h.</span><span class="font0"> And theſe are the limits of the values of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> ; and therefore, in rivers whoſe width is always great in compariſon of the&nbsp;depth, we may without much error take their real&nbsp;depth for their hydraulic mean depth. Hence we derive a rule of eaſy recollection, and which will at ail&nbsp;times give us a very near eſtimate of the velocity and&nbsp;expence of a running ſtream, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font0"> that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the velocities are&nbsp;nearly as the ſqaare roots of the depths.</span><span class="font0"> We find this&nbsp;confirmed by many experiments of Michelotti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alſo, when we are allowed to ſuppoſe this ratio of the velocities and depths, that is, in a rectangular canal of&nbsp;great breadth and ſmall depth, we ſhall have the quantities&nbsp;diſcharged nearly in the proportion of the cubes of the&nbsp;velocities. For the quantity diſcharged </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> is as., the velocity and area jointly, that is, as the height and velocity jointly, becauſe when the width is the ſame the&nbsp;area is as the height. Therefore, we have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d == h v.-</span><span class="font0">But, by the above remark, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h = v<sup>i</sup>.</span><span class="font0"> Therefore, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d ==&nbsp;v<sup>i</sup></span><span class="font0"> ; and this is confirmed by the experiments of Boſſut,&nbsp;vol. ii. 236.
