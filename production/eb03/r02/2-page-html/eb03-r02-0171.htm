<p><span class="font1">cluded the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">war in a few months, he returned in triumph </span><span class="font1">to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Antony, who, during this interval, was revelling in all the ſtudied luxuries procured him by his inſidious&nbsp;miſtreſs, having heard of his brother’s overthrow, and&nbsp;his wife’s being compelled to leave Italy, was reſolved&nbsp;to oppoſe Octavianus without delay. He accordingly&nbsp;ſailed at the head of a conſiderable fleet from Alexandria to Tyre, from thence to Cyprus and Rhodes,&nbsp;and had an interview with Fulvia his wife at Athens. He much blamed her for occaſioning the late diſorders,&nbsp;teſtified the utmoſt contempt for her perſon, and, leaving her upon her death-bed at Sycion, haſtened into&nbsp;Italy to fight Octavianus. They both met at Brunduſium; and it was now thought that the flames of a&nbsp;civil war were going to blaze out once more. The&nbsp;forces of Antony were numerous, but moſtly newly&nbsp;raiſed; however, he was aſſiſted by Sextus Pompeius,&nbsp;who in theſe oppoſitions of intereſts was daily coming&nbsp;into power. Octavianus was at the head of thoſe veterans who had always been irreſiſtible, but who ſeemed no way diſpoſed to fight againſt Antony their former general. A negociation was therefore propoſed;&nbsp;and a reconciliation was effected. All offences and affronts were mutually forgiven; and to cement the&nbsp;union, a marriage was concluded between Antony and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Octavia, the ſiſter of Octavianus. A new diviſion of the Roman empire was made between them; Octavianus was to have the command of the weſt, Antony&nbsp;of the eaſt, while Lepidus was obliged to content himſelf with the provinces in Africa. As for Sextus Pompeius, he was permitted to retain all the iſlands he had&nbsp;already poſſeſſed, together with Peloponneſus: he was&nbsp;alſo granted the privilege of demanding the conſulſhip&nbsp;in his abſence, and of diſcharging that office by any of&nbsp;his friends. It was likewiſe ſtipulated to leave the ſea&nbsp;open, and pay the people what corn was due out of&nbsp;Sicily. Thus a general peace was concluded, to the&nbsp;great ſatisfaction of the people, who now expected a&nbsp;ceſſation from all their calamities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This calm ſeemed to continue for ſome time: Antony led his forces againſt the Parthians, over whom his lieutenant, Ventidius, had gained great advantages.&nbsp;Octavianus drew the greateſt part of his army into&nbsp;Gaul, where there were ſome diſturbances; and Pom-pcy went to ſecure his newly ceded province to his intereſt. It was on this quarter that freſh motives were&nbsp;given for renewing the war. Antony, who was obliged by treaty to quit Peloponneſus, refuſed to evacuate&nbsp;it till Pompey had ſatisfied him for ſuch debts as were&nbsp;due to him from the inhabitants. This Pompey would&nbsp;by no means comply with; but immediately fitted out&nbsp;a new fleet, and renewed his former enterpriſes, by cutting off ſuch corn and proviſions as were conſigned to&nbsp;Italy. Thus the grievances of the poor were again renewed; and the people began to complain, that inſtead&nbsp;of three tyrants they were now oppreſſed by four.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this exigence, Octavianus, who had long meditated the beſt means of diminiſhing the number, reſolved to begin by getting rid </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">Pompey, who kept the ſtate in continual alarms. He was maſter of two fleets;&nbsp;one of which he had cauſed to be built at Ravenna;&nbsp;and another which Menodorus, who revolted from Pompey, brought to his aid. His firſt attempt was to invade</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font1">Sicily; but being overpowered in his paſſage by</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pompey, and afterwards ſhattered in a ſtorm, he was obliged to defer his deſigns to the enſuing year. During this interval he was reinforced by a fleet of 120&nbsp;ſhips, given him by Antony, with which he reſolved&nbsp;once more to invade Sicily on three ſeveral quarters.&nbsp;But fortune ſeemed ſtill determined to oppoſe him. He&nbsp;was a ſecond time diſabled and ſhattered by a ſtorm:&nbsp;which ſo raiſed the vanity of Pompey, that he began&nbsp;to ſtyle himſelf the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ſon of Neptune.</span><span class="font1"> However, Octavianus was not to be intimidated by any diſgraces; for&nbsp;having ſhortly refitted his navy, and recruited his forces,&nbsp;he gave the command ef both to Agrippa, his faithful friend and aſſociate in war. Agrippa proved himſelf worthy of the truſt repoſed in him: he began his&nbsp;operations by a victory over Pompey; and, though he&nbsp;was ſhortly after worſted himſelf, he ſoon after gave&nbsp;his adverſary a complete and final overthrow. Thus&nbsp;undone, Pompey reſolved to fly to Antony, ſrom whom&nbsp;he expected refuge, as he had formerly obliged that&nbsp;triumvir by giving protection to his mother. However, he tried once more, at the head of a ſmall body of&nbsp;men, to make himſelf independent, and even ſurpriſed&nbsp;Antony’s officers who had been ſent to accept of his&nbsp;ſubmiſſions. Nevertheleſs, he was at laſt abandoned by&nbsp;his ſoldiers, and delivered up to Titus, Antony’s lieutenant, who ſhortly after cauſed him to be ſlain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The death of this general removed one very powerful obſtacle to the ambition of Octavianus, and he reſolved to take the earlieſt opportunity to get rid of the reſt of his aſſociates. An offence was ſoon furniſhed by Lepidus, that ſerved as a ſufficient pretext for depriving him of his ſhare in the triumvirate. Being now&nbsp;at the head of 22 legions, with a ſtrong body of cavalry, he idly ſuppoſed that his preſent power was more&nbsp;than an equivalent to the popularity of Octavianus.&nbsp;He therefore reſolved upon adding Sicily, where he&nbsp;then was, to his province; pretending a right, as having&nbsp;firſt invaded it. His colleague ſent to expoſtulate upon&nbsp;theſe proceedings; but Lepidus fiercely replied, ‘ that&nbsp;he was determined to have his ſhare in the adminiſtration, and would no longer ſubmit to let one alone poſ-ſeſs all the authority. ’ Octavianus was previouſly informed of the diſpoſition of Lepidus’s ſoldiers; for he&nbsp;had, by his ſecret intrigues and largeſſes, entirely attached them to himſelf. Wherefore, without further&nbsp;delay, he with great boldneſs went alone to the camp&nbsp;ef Lepidus, and with no other aſſiſtance than his private bounties, and the authority he had gained by his&nbsp;former victories, he reſolved to depoſe his rival. The&nbsp;ſoldiers thronged round him with the moſt dutiful alacrity, while Lepidus haſtened to prevent their defection.&nbsp;But Octavianus, though he received a wound from one&nbsp;of the centurions, went with great preſence of mind to&nbsp;the place where the military enſigns were planted, and,&nbsp;flouriſhing one of them in the air, all the legionary ſoldiers ran in crowds and ſaluted him as their general.&nbsp;Lepidus being thus abandoned by his men, diveſted&nbsp;himſelf of all the marks of his authority, which he&nbsp;could no longer keep, and ſuhmiſſively threw himſelf&nbsp;at the feet of Octavianus. This general ſpared his&nbsp;life, notwithſtanding the remonſtrances of his army;&nbsp;but deprived him of all his former authority, and&nbsp;baniſhed him to Circæum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Octavianus was received upon his return to Rome with univerſal joy; the ſenators met him at the gates,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
