<p><span class="font0">National Gallery. There is no reason to doubt, with Smith, that “ His Majesty sat to him for his portrait, yet it is not a&nbsp;little remarkable that no notice occurs in any of the royal&nbsp;catalogues, or the writers of the period, of the existence of such&nbsp;a portrait.” While in England, Rubens very narrowly escaped&nbsp;drowning while going to Greenwich in a boat. The fact is&nbsp;reported by Lord Dorchester in a letter to Sir Isaac Wake&nbsp;(Sainsbury, cxvi.). At the beginning of March the painter’s&nbsp;mission came to a close.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens was now fifty-three years of age; he had been four years a widower, and before the end of the year (December&nbsp;1630) he entered into a second marriage with a beautiful girl&nbsp;of sixteen, named Helena Fourment. She was an admirable&nbsp;model, and none of her husband’s works may be more justly&nbsp;termed masterpieces than those in which she is represented&nbsp;(Munich, St Petersburg, Blenheim, Liechtenstein, the Louvre,&nbsp;&amp;c.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although the long months of absence could not be termed blanks in Rubens’s artistic career, his return was followed by&nbsp;an almost incredible activity. Inspired more than ever by&nbsp;the glorious works of Titian, he now produced some of his&nbsp;best paintings. BrightiicssJn colouring, breadth of touch and&nbsp;pictorial conception, are specially striking in those works we&nbsp;know to have been painted in the latter part of his lifetime.&nbsp;Could anything give a higher idea of Rubens’s genius than,&nbsp;for example, the “ Feast of Venus,” the portrait of “ Helena&nbsp;Fourment ready to enter the Bath,” or the “ St Ildefonso ”?&nbsp;This last picture—now, as well as the two others just alluded&nbsp;to, in the Vienna Gallery—was painted for the church of the&nbsp;convent of St Jacques, in Brussels. On the wings are represented the archdukes in royal attire, under the protection pf&nbsp;their patron saints. The presence of these figures has led to&nbsp;some mistake regarding the date of the production, but it has&nbsp;been proved beyond doubt, through a document published&nbsp;by Mr Castan (1884), that the “ St Ildefonso ” (at Vienna—&nbsp;there is another resembling it at St Petersburg) belongs to the&nbsp;series of works executed after the journeys to Spain and England.&nbsp;Archduke Albrecht had been dead ten years. The picture was&nbsp;engraved by Witdoeck in 1638.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Isabella died in 1633, and we know that to the end Rubens remained in high favour with her, alike as an artist and as a&nbsp;political agent. The painter was even one of the gentlemen&nbsp;she deputed to meet Marie de Medicis at the frontier in 1631,&nbsp;after her escape from France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Spain and the Netherlands went to war again, the king never ceasing to look upon the Dutch as rebels, and much trouble and&nbsp;suspicion came upon the great artist. As to the real nature of&nbsp;his communings with Frederick Henry of Orange, whom he is&nbsp;known to have interviewed, nothing as yet has been discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ferdinand of Austria, the cardinal-infant of Spain, was called to the government of the Netherlands on the death of&nbsp;his aunt. He was the king’s younger brother, and arrived at&nbsp;Antwerp in May 1635. The streets had been decorated with&nbsp;triumphal arches and “ spectacula,” arranged by Rubens, and&nbsp;certainly never equalled by any other works of the kind.@@<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;Several of the paintings detached from the arches were offered&nbsp;as presents to the new governor-general, a scarcely known fact,&nbsp;which accounts for the presence of many of these works in&nbsp;public galleries (Vienna, Dresden, Brussels, &amp;c.). Rubens was&nbsp;at the time laid up with gout, but Prince Ferdinand was desirous&nbsp;of expressing his satisfaction, and called upon the painter, remaining a long time at his house. Rubens and Ferdinand&nbsp;had met at Madrid, and only a short time elapsed before the&nbsp;painter was confirmed in his official standing—a matter of&nbsp;small importance; if we consider that the last years of his life&nbsp;were almost exclusively employed in working much more for&nbsp;the king than for his brother. About a hundred and twenty</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">paintings of considerable size left Antwerp for Madrid in 1637, 1638 and 1639; they were intended to decorate the pavilion&nbsp;erected at the Pardo, and known under the name of Torre de&nbsp;la Parada. Another series had been begun, when Ferdinand&nbsp;wrote to Madrid that the painter was no more, and Jordaens&nbsp;would finish the work. Rubens breathed his last on the 30th&nbsp;of May 1640.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">More fortunate than many artists, Rubens left the world in the midst of his glory.. Not the remotest trace of approaching old age,&nbsp;not the slightest failing of mind or skill, can tie detected even in&nbsp;his latest works, such as the “ Martyrdom of St Peter ” at Cologne,&nbsp;the “ Martyrdom of St Thomas ” at Prague, or the “ Judgment of&nbsp;Paris ” at Madrid, where his young wife appears for the last time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens has little of the Italian grace and refinement; he was a Fleming throughout, notwithstanding his frequent recollections of&nbsp;those Italian masters whom he most admired, and who themselves&nbsp;have little, if anything, in common with Raphael. But it must&nbsp;be borne in mind how completely his predecessors were frozen into&nbsp;stiffness through italianization, and how necessary it was to bring&nbsp;back the Flemish school to life and nature. Critics have spoken of&nbsp;Rubens’s historical improprieties. Of course nobody could suppose&nbsp;that his classical learning did not go far enough to know that the&nbsp;heroines of the Old Testament or of Roman history were not dressed&nbsp;out as ladies of his time; but in this respect he only follows the&nbsp;example of Titian, Paolo Veronese, and many others. In no other&nbsp;school do we find these animated hunts of lions, tigers, and even&nbsp;the hippopotamus and the crocodile, which may be reckoned among&nbsp;the finest, specimens of art, and here again are life and nature displayed with the utmost power. “ His horses are perfect in their&nbsp;kind,” says Reynolds; his dogs are of the strong Flemish breed,&nbsp;and his landscapes the most charming pictures of Brabantine scenery,&nbsp;in the midst of which lay his seat of Steen. As a portrait painter,&nbsp;although less refined than Van Dyck, he shows that eminent master&nbsp;the way; and his pure fancy subjects, as the “ Garden of Love ”&nbsp;(Madrid and Dresden) and the <sup>4</sup> Village Feast ” (Louvre), have&nbsp;never been equalled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For nearly one hundred years the Flemish school may be said to have been but a reflection of the Rubenesque principles. Although&nbsp;Jordaens and Erasmus Quellin lived till 1678, the school might be&nbsp;termed a body without soul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some etchings have been ascribed to Rubens, but except a head of Seneca, the only copy of .which is in the Print Room at the&nbsp;British Museum, and a beautiful figure of St Catherine, we can&nbsp;admit none of the other plates said to proceed from Rubens as&nbsp;authentic. Rubens nevertheless exercised an immense influence&nbsp;on the art of engraving. Under his direct guidance Soutman,&nbsp;Vorsterman, Pontius, Witdoeck, the two Bolswerts, Peter de Jode,&nbsp;N. Lauwers, and many others of less note, left an immense number&nbsp;of beautiful plates, reproducing the most celebrated of his paintings.&nbsp;To give an idea of what his influence was capable of accomplishing,&nbsp;pictorially speaking, it might be sufficient to notice the transformation undergone by the Antwerp school of engraving under Rubens;&nbsp;even the modern school of engraving, in more than one respect, is&nbsp;a continuation of the style first practised in Antwerp (see Line&nbsp;Engraving). His influence is scarcely less apparent in sculpture,&nbsp;and the celebrated Luke Fayd’herbe was his pupil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Never did the Flemish school find a second Rubens. None of his four sons became a painter, nor did any of his three daughters&nbsp;marry an artist. According to Rubens’s will, his drawings were to&nbsp;belong to that one of hi$ sons who might become a painter, or in&nbsp;the event of one of his daughters marrying a celebrated artist, they&nbsp;were to be her portion. The valuable collection was dispersed only&nbsp;in 1659, and of the pictures sold in 1640 thirty-two became the&nbsp;property of the king of Spain. The Madrid Gallery alone possesses&nbsp;over sixty of his works. Four years after her husband<sup>f</sup>s death,&nbsp;Helena Fourment married J. B. Van .Brouckhoven de Bergheyck,&nbsp;knight of St James, member of the privy council, &amp;c. She died in&nbsp;1673. 1 n 1746 the male line of Rubens’s descendants was completely&nbsp;extinct. In the female line more than a hundred families oi name&nbsp;in Europe trace their descent from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The paintings of Rubens are found in all the principal galleries in Europe: Antwerp and Brussels, Madrid, Pans, Lille, Dresden,&nbsp;Berlin, Munich, Vienna, St Petersburg, London, Florence, Milan,&nbsp;Turin exhibit several hundreds of.his works.
