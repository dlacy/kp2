<p><label>RANGOON TOWN</label>
a district in the Pegu division of the province of British Burmah, situated in 16° 47' N. lat. and 96° 13' E. long., on the left bank of the Hlaing or Rangoon river at its junction ■with the Pegu and Pu-zwon-doung streams, 21 miles from the sea. In 1880 the town was detached from the surrounding area of the old district of Rangoon and constituted a separate district, the remainder of the country being formed into a distinct jurisdiction under the title of Hanthawady. The soil of Rangoon in the mountains and elevated tracts is grey sandy clay, and in the plains it is mostly alluvial mixed with earth of reddish colour, well suited for the growth of rice, vegetables, and fruit trees. The Rangoon river flows from the junction of the Panlaing and Hlaing rivers to the sea; from the sea to Rangoon it is navigable during the monsoons by vessels of the largest draught, and in the dry season by vessels of 1000 tons. Pu-zwon-doung creek empties itself into the Rangoon river at Battery Point. It is navigable during the spring tides of the southwest monsoon for cargo boats of 100 tons; near its junction with the Rangoon river is a small rock, dangerous to large vessels. The only lake of any importance is the Kandaugyi or Royal Lake within the Dalhousie Park. The chief products of the district are grains and pulses (principally rice), cotton, timber, and cutch (catechu) and gambier. Rangoon comprises an area of 22 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 134,176 (males 91,504, females 42,672); Hindus numbered 35,871, Mohammedans 21,169, Christians 9741, and Buddhists 67,131.</p>

<p>The town was first built in 1753 by Aloung-blioora, the founder of the Burmese monarchy. On the outbreak of the first Burmese War, in 1824, it was taken by the British, but subsequently restored to the native power. It was captured a second time in 1852 and passed along with the province of Pegu into the hands of the British. The town was destroyed by fire in 1850, and serious conflagrations occurred again in 1853 and 1855. Since the last devastation Rangoon has undergone considerable improvements; among the latest may be mentioned the construction of steam tramways in the principal thoroughfares and the establishment of a volunteer fire brigade.</p>
