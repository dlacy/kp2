The principle on which it acts (see Hydromechanics) may be understood from the accompanying diagram. ABC is a tube filled with liquid, the shorter limb dipping under the</p><p>surface of the liquid in jar <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the</p><p>longer in jar <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The pressure in the</p><p>tube at A is atmospheric pressure</p><p>minus that of the vertical column</p><p>AB', while that at C is atmospheric</p><p>pressure minus that of the column</p><p>CB". When CB'' is longer than AB'</p><p>the pressure at C is of course less</p><p>than that at A, and a current flows</p><p>in the direction ABC through the siphon. When AB' = B"C, that is, when the liquid stands at the same level, pressure is equal in the two limbs, and the current ceases. The siphon has practically a certain minimum diameter for each liquid, as capillarity prevents a fluid from flowing out of tubes of very small bore unless under the influence of electricity, heat, or great pressure. The instrument is largely employed for chemical work, both in the laboratory and in manufacturing processes ; it is formed of glass, india-rubber, lead, or other substance, according to the purpose for which it is intended. The simple siphon (see fig.) is used by filling it with the liquid to be decanted, closing the longer limb with the finger and plunging the shorter into the liquid, and it must be filled for each time of using. Innumerable forms have been devised adapted for all purposes, and provided with arrangements for filling the tube, or for keeping it full and starting it into action automatically when required. The former purpose is usually effected by blowing into the vessel through a second opening in the stopper through which the siphon passes, or by means of a sucking or blowing tube attached to the longer limb, or by pouring in liquid through a flexible tube attached at the bend. The second plan is frequently realized by having a stopcock on the longer limb and a valve opening upwards on the shorter, or by having both limbs of equal length and each standing in a cup, in which case when the level changes in either cup the siphon tends to equalize it by conveying liquid from the higher to the lower. Many other forms are in constant use in the arts, and the siphon is also employed in some of its modifications in surgery, in engineering, and in other sciences.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
