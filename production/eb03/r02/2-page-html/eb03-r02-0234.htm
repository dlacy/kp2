<p><span class="font0">Conſtans ruled in Italy. Dalmatius, the emperor’s brother, was ſent to defend thoſe parts that bordered upon the Goths ; and Annibalianus, his nephew, had the charge of Cappadocia and Armenia Minor. This dι-vilion of the empire ſtiſl farther contributed to its downfall: for the united ſtrength of the ſtate being no longer&nbsp;brought to repreſs invaſions, the barbarians fought&nbsp;with ſuperior numbers ; and conquered at laſt, though&nbsp;often defeated. Conſtantine, however, did not live to&nbsp;feel theſe calamities. The latter part of hie reign was&nbsp;peaceful and ſplendid ; ambaſſadors from the remoteſt&nbsp;Indies came to acknowledge his authority ; the Perſians, who were ready for freſh inroads, upon finding&nbsp;him prepared to oppoſe, ſent humbly to deſire his&nbsp;friendſhip and forgivenneſs. He was above 60 years&nbsp;old, and had reigned above 30 years, when he found&nbsp;bis health began to -decline. To obviate the effects of&nbsp;bis diſorder, which was an intermitting fever, he made&nbsp;uſe of the warm baths of the city ; but receiving no&nbsp;benefit from thence, he removed for change of air to&nbsp;Helenopolis, a city which he had built to the memory&nbsp;of his mother. His diſorder increaſing, he changed&nbsp;again to Nicomedia ; where finding himſelf without&nbsp;hopes of recovery, he cauſed himſelf to be Baptized ;&nbsp;and having ſoon after received the fâcrament, he expired, after a memorable and active reign of 32 years.&nbsp;This monarch’s character is repreſented to us in very&nbsp;different lights : the Chriſtian writers of that time&nbsp;adorning it with every ſtrain of panegyric ; the heathens, on the contrary, loading it with all the virulence of invective. He eſtabliſhed a religion that continues the bleſſing of mankind ; but purſued a ſeheme&nbsp;of politics that deſtroyed the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the time of Conſtantine to the diviſion of the empire between Valentiniaa and his brother Valens, the&nbsp;hiſtory of Rome is related under the article Constantinople, where alſo that of the eaſtern part is carried&nbsp;down to the final deſtruction of that city by the Turks.&nbsp;In the beginning of the reign of Valentinian, the province&nbsp;of Libya Tripolitana was grievouſly oppreſſed by the&nbsp;barbarians of the deſert, and almoſt equally ſo by Ro-manus its own governor. His conduct was ſo exceedingly&nbsp;oppreſſive, that the inhabitants ſent a deputation to Valentinian, complaining of their unhappy ſituation, and&nbsp;deſiring redreſs. Palladius was accordingly ſent to inquire into the ſtate of the province ; but being gained&nbsp;over by Romanus, he made a falſe report to the emperor ; and thus the unhappy province was leſt a prey&nbsp;to the mercileſs invaders and rapacious governor. During the reſt of this reign the barbarians continued&nbsp;their inroads into the empire ; and among others, we&nbsp;find the Saxons now putting in for a ſhare of the ſpoils&nbsp;of the ruined empire : however, their army was at this&nbsp;time entirely cut off. At laſt Valentinian himſelf took&nbsp;the field againſt theſe northern barbarians ; and entering the country of the Quadi, deſtroyed all with fire&nbsp;and ſword. The barbarians on this were fain to ſue&nbsp;for peace in a very humble manner ; but Valentinian,&nbsp;falling into a great paſſion while ſpeaking to them,&nbsp;threatened to extirpate the whole nation at once. His&nbsp;fury on this occaſion produced an apoplexy, or ſome&nbsp;ocher mortal diſorder ; for he ſuddenly ſell down, and&nbsp;being conveyed by his attendants into his chamber, he&nbsp;was ſeized with violent convulſive fits and contortions&nbsp;of all his limbs, in the agonies of which he expired,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">in the year 375, the 55‘th of his age, and 12th of his reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the death of Valentinian, his ſon Gratian took upon him the imperial dignity ; ſoon after becoming&nbsp;maſter of the whole empire by the death of Valens.&nbsp;The tranſactions of his reign, and thoſe of his partner&nbsp;Ttieodoſius, are related under the article Constantinople, n<sup>0</sup> 77—89. The death of Theodoſius gave&nbsp;the finiſhing ſtroke to the Roman affairs ; his ſon Ho-norius, to whom he left the weſtern empire, being poſſeſſed of no abilities whatever, and indeed ſeeming to&nbsp;have been but very little removed from an idiot. The&nbsp;barbarians appear to have been abundantly ſenſible of&nbsp;the advantages offered them by the death of Theodofius.&nbsp;He expired in the month of January ; and before the&nbsp;acceſſion of ſpring, the Goths were in arms. The barbarian auxiliaries alſo now declared their independency ;&nbsp;and along with their countrymen, furiouſly aſſailed the&nbsp;declining empire. The Goths were now headed by an&nbsp;experienced commander, their celebrated king Alaric ;&nbsp;who would have proved formidable even in better times&nbsp;of the empire. He firſt over-ran Greece, which he accompliſhed without oppoſition, through the treachery&nbsp;of the governor, who commanded the troops that defended the paſs at Thermopylæ to retire at the approach of the enemy. Athens, Corinth, Argos, Sparta, yielded without reſiſtance ; and the whole country&nbsp;was ravaged and deſtroyed by the blood-thirſty barbarians. At laſt, in the year 397, he was oppoſed by&nbsp;Stilicho, the general of Honorius, a man of great valour and experience in war. The Goths were defeated&nbsp;with great loſs, and afterwards beſieged in their camp ;&nbsp;but through miſtake or negligence in the Roman commander, they were ſuffered to eſcape, and make themſelves maſters of the province of Epirus. Alaric then,&nbsp;having found means to conclude a treaty with the miniſters of Conſtantinople, Stilicho was obliged to retire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not long after this, Alaric invaded Italy itſelf. The emperor, ſtruck with terror, would have abandoned&nbsp;the country and fled into Gaul : but this diſgracefui&nbsp;and pernicious meaſure was oppoſed by Stilicho ; who&nbsp;propoſed to the court of Honorius, at that time at Milan, that if they would maintain their ground during&nbsp;his abſence, he would ſoon return with an army capable of oppoſing the barbarians. This being agreed&nbsp;to, Stilicho immediately ſet out for Rhætia, where the&nbsp;•moſt conſiderable body of the Roman forces at that&nbsp;time was, and collected his troops with the utmoſt diligence. But in the mean time Honorius was in the&nbsp;greateſt danger ; having been obliged to take refuge&nbsp;in the town of Aſta in Piedmont. To this place the&nbsp;Goths inſtantly laid ſiege, and a capitulation had been&nbsp;propoſed, when the drooping ſpirits of Honorius were&nbsp;at once revived by the arrival of Stilicho, whom he&nbsp;had ſo long expected. The Goths were now beſieged&nbsp;in their turn, and obliged to come to a deciſive battle&nbsp;at Pollentia. The engagement laſted the whole day ;&nbsp;but at laſt the Goths were compelled to retreat. Their&nbsp;camp was inſtantly inveſted ; their entrenchments forced with great ſlaughter; the wife of Alaric was taken,&nbsp;with all the wealth which had been amaſſed in plundering Greece ; while many thouſands of Roman priſoners were releaſed from the moſt deplorable ſlavery.&nbsp;The victory, however, was not ſo deciſive but that A ;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
