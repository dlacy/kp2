Ten years of bitter conflict&nbsp;followed, but at last, in 367 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C., </span><span class="font1">the Licinian rogations&nbsp;became law, and one of their authors, L. Sextius, was&nbsp;created the first plebeian consul. For the moment it was some&nbsp;consolation to the patricians that they not only succeeded in&nbsp;detaching from the consulship the administration of civil law,&nbsp;which was entrusted to a separate officer, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praetor urbanus,</span><span class="font1"> to&nbsp;be elected by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> of the centuries, with an understanding apparently that he should be a patrician, but also obtained&nbsp;the institution of two additional aediles </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(aediles curules),</span><span class="font1"> who&nbsp;were in like manner to be members of their own order.<sup>@@1</sup> With&nbsp;the opening of the consulship, however, the issue of the long contest was virtually decided, and the next eighty years witnessed&nbsp;a rapid succession of plebeian victories. Now that a plebeian&nbsp;consul might preside at the elections, the main difficulty&nbsp;in the way of the nomination and election of plebeian&nbsp;candidates was removed. The proposed patrician&nbsp;monopoly of the new curulc aedileship was almost&nbsp;instantly abandoned. In 356 the first plebeian&nbsp;was made dictator; in 350 the censorship, and in&nbsp;337 the praetorship were filled for the first time by&nbsp;plebeians; and lastly, in 300, by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Ogulnia,</span><span class="font1"> even&nbsp;the sacred colleges of the pontiffs and augurs, the old&nbsp;strongholds of patrician supremacy, were thrown open to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs.<sup>@@2</sup> </span><span class="font1">The patricians lost also the control they had exercised&nbsp;so long over the action of the people in assembly. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patrum&nbsp;auctoritas,</span><span class="font1"> the sanction given or refused by the patrician&nbsp;senators to laws and to elections, had hitherto been a powerful&nbsp;weapon in their hands. But in 339 a law of Q. Publilius&nbsp;Philo, a plebeian dictator, enacted that this sanction&nbsp;should be given beforehand to laws enacted in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia centuriata<sup>@@3 </sup></span><span class="font1">and a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Maenia</span><span class="font1"> of uncertain date extended&nbsp;the rule to elections in the same assembly. Livy ascribes&nbsp;to the same Publilius a law emancipating the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium plebis&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">from the control of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patres</span><span class="font1">; but this seems in reality&nbsp;to have been effected by the famous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Hortensia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">carried by another plebeian dictator.<sup>@@4</sup> Henceforward&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patrum auctoritas</span><span class="font1"> sank into a meaningless form, though as&nbsp;such it still survived in the time of Livy. From 287 onwards&nbsp;it is certain that measures passed by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs,</span><span class="font1"> voting by their&nbsp;tribes, had the full force of laws without any further conditions&nbsp;whatsoever. The legislative independence of the plebeian&nbsp;assembly was secured, and with this crowning victory ended</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the long struggle between the orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(&amp;) Conquest of Italy.—</span><span class="font1">Twelve years after the passing of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Hortensia,</span><span class="font1"> King Pyrrhus, beaten at Beneventum, withdrew&nbsp;from Italy, and Rome was left mistress of the peninsula. The&nbsp;steps by which this supremacy had been won have now to be&nbsp;traced.<sup>@@5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The expulsion of the Tarquins from Rome, followed as it seems to have been by the emancipation from Etruscan supremacy of all the country between the Tiber and the Liris, entirely&nbsp;altered the aspect of affairs. North of the Tiber the powerful&nbsp;Etruscan city of Veii, after a vain attempt to restore the Tarquins, relapsed into an attitude of sullen hostility towards Rome,&nbsp;which, down to the outbreak of the final struggle in&nbsp;407, found vent in constant and harassing border&nbsp;forays. The Sabines recommenced their raids across the Anio;&nbsp;from their hills to the south-east the Aequi pressed forward as&nbsp;far as the eastern spurs of the Alban range, and ravaged the low&nbsp;country between that range and the Sabine mountains; the&nbsp;Volsci overran the coast-lands as far as Antium, established them</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">selves at Velitrac and even wasted the fields within a few miles of Rome. But the good fortune of Rome did not leave her to&nbsp;face these foes single-handed, and it is a significant&nbsp;fact that the history of the Roman advance begins,&nbsp;not with a brilliant victory, but with a timely alliance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to Livy, it was in 493, only a few years after the defeat of the prince of Tusculum at Lake Regillus,&nbsp;that a treaty was concluded between Rome and the Latin communities of the Campagna.<sup>@@6</sup> The alliance was in every respect&nbsp;natural. The Latins were the near neighbours and kinsmen of&nbsp;the Romans, and both Romans and Latins were just freed from&nbsp;Etruscan rule to find themselves as lowlanders and dwellers in&nbsp;towns face to face with a common foe in the ruder hill tribes on&nbsp;their borders. The exact terms of the treaty cannot, any more&nbsp;than the precise circumstances under which it was concluded,&nbsp;be stated with certainty (see Latium), but two points seem&nbsp;clear. There was at first a genuine equality in the relations&nbsp;between the allies; Romans and Latins, though combining for&nbsp;defence and offence, did so without sacrificing their separate&nbsp;freedom of action, even in the matter of waging wars independently of each other.<sup>@@7</sup> But, secondly, Rome enjoyed from the&nbsp;first one inestimable advantage. The Latins lay between her&nbsp;and the most active of her foes, the Aequi and Volsci, and served&nbsp;to protect her territories at the expense of their own. Behind&nbsp;this barrier Rome grew strong, and the close of the Aequian and&nbsp;Volscian wars left the Latins her dependents rather than her&nbsp;allies. Beyond the limits of the Campagna Rome found a&nbsp;second ally, hardly less useful than the Latins, in the tribe of&nbsp;the Hernici (“ the men of the rocks ”), in the valley of the&nbsp;Trcrus, who had equal reason with the Romans and Latins to&nbsp;dread the Volsci and Aequi, while their position midway between&nbsp;the two latter peoples made them valuable auxiliaries to the&nbsp;lowlanders of the Campagna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The treaty with the Hernici is said to have been concluded in 486,<sup>@@8</sup> and the confederacy of the three peoples—&nbsp;Romans, Latins and Hemicans—lasted down to the&nbsp;great Latin war in 340. Confused and untrustworthy&nbsp;as are the chronicles of the early wars of Rome, it is&nbsp;clear that, notwithstanding the acquisition of these allies, Rome&nbsp;made but little way against her foes during the first fifty year&amp;&nbsp;of the existence of the Republic. In 474, it is true, an&nbsp;end was put for a time to the harassing border feud&nbsp;with Veii by a forty years’ peace, an advantage due not so much&nbsp;to Roman valour as to the increasing dangers from other&nbsp;quarters which were threatening the Etruscan states.<sup>@@9</sup> But&nbsp;this partial success stands alone, and down to 449 the&nbsp;raids of Sabines, Aequi and Volsci continue without&nbsp;intermission, and are occasionally carried up to the very walls&nbsp;of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Very different is the impression left by the annals of the next sixty years (449-390). During this period there is an&nbsp;unmistakable development of Roman power on all&nbsp;sides. In southern Etruria the capture of Veii (396)&nbsp;virtually gave Rome the mastery as far as the Ciminian&nbsp;forest. Sutrium and Nepete, “ the gates of Etruria,”&nbsp;became her allies and guarded her interests against&nbsp;any attack from the Etruscan communities to the north, while&nbsp;along the Tiber valley her suzerainty was acknowledged as&nbsp;far as Capena and Falerii. On the Anio frontier we hear of no&nbsp;disturbances from 449 until some ten years after the sack of&nbsp;Rome by the Gauls. In 446 the Aequi appear for&nbsp;the last time before the gates of Rome. After 418&nbsp;they disappear from Mount Algidus, and in the same&nbsp;year the communications of Rome and Latium with&nbsp;the Hernici in the Trerus valley were secured by the capture and&nbsp;colonization of Labicum. Successive invasions, too, broke the&nbsp;strength of the Volsci, and in 393 a Latin colony was&nbsp;founded as far south as Circeii. In part, no doubt,&nbsp;these Roman successes were due to the improved condition of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
