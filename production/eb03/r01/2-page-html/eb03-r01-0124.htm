<p><span class="font0">every caſe equal and oppoſite, and that the obſerved change of motion is the only indication, characteriſtic,&nbsp;and meaſure, of the changing force, the forces are the&nbsp;ſame (whether we call them impulſions or reſiſtances)&nbsp;when the relative motions are the ſame, and therefore&nbsp;depend entirely on theſe relative motions. The force,&nbsp;therefore, which is neceffary for keeping a body immoveable in a ſtream of water, flowing with a certain&nbsp;velocity, is the ſame with what is required for moving&nbsp;this body with this velocity through ſtagnant water.&nbsp;To auy one who admits the motion of the earth round&nbsp;the fun, it is evident that we can neither obſerve nor&nbsp;reaſon from a caſe of a body moving through ſtill water, nor of a ſtream of water preſſing upon or impelling&nbsp;a quieſcent body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A body in motion appears to be reſiſted by a ſtagnant fluid, becauſe it is a law of mechanical nature that force muſt be employed in order to put any body in&nbsp;motion. Now the body cannot move forward without&nbsp;putting the contiguous fluid in motion, and force muſt&nbsp;be employed for producing this motion. In like manner, a quieſcent body is impelled by a ſtream of fluid,&nbsp;becauſe the motion oſ the contiguous fluid is diminiſhed by this ſolid obſtacle ; the reſiſtance, therefore, or&nbsp;impnlſe, no way differs from the ordinary communica-tions of motion among ſolid bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sir Iſaac Newton, therefore, begins his theory of the reſiſtance and impulſe of fluids, by ſelecting </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">cale&nbsp;where, although he cannot pretend to aſcertain the motions themſelves which are produced iu the particles of&nbsp;a contiguous ſtuid, he can tell preciſely their mutual ra-tios.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He ſuppoſes two ſyſtems oſ bodies ſuch, that each body oſ the firſt is fimilar to a correſponding body of&nbsp;the ſecond, and that each is to each in a conſtant ratio.&nbsp;He alſo ſuppoſes them to be limilarly iituated, that is,&nbsp;at the angles oſ fimilar figures, and that the homologous&nbsp;lines of theſe figures are in the ſame ratio with the dia-meters of the bodies. He farther ſuppoſes, that they&nbsp;attract or repel each other in fimilar directions, and&nbsp;that the accelerating connecting forces are aſſo propor-tional ; that is, the forces in the one ſyſtem are to the&nbsp;correſponding forces in tne other ſyſtem in a eonſtant ra^&nbsp;tio, and that, in each ſyſtem taken apart, the forces are&nbsp;as the ſquares of the velocities directly, and as the dia-meters of the correfponding bodies, or their diſtances,&nbsp;inverſely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This being the, caſe, it legitimately follows, that if fimilar parts-of the two ſyſtems are put into fimilar mo-tions, in any given inſtant, they will </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">continue</span><span class="font0"> to move&nbsp;fimilarly, each correſpondent body deſcribing fimilar&nbsp;curves, with proportional velocities : For the bodies be-ing fimilarly fituated,the forces which act on a body in&nbsp;one fyſtem, arifing from the combination of any number&nbsp;of adjoining particles, will have the ſame direction with&nbsp;the force acting on the coι reſponding body in the other&nbsp;ſyſtem, arifing from the combined action of the ſimilar&nbsp;and fimilarly directed forces of the adjoining correſpon-. dent bodies of the other ſyſtem ; and theſe compound&nbsp;forces will have the ſame ratio with the ſimple forces&nbsp;which conſtitute them, and will be as the fquares of&nbsp;the velocities directly, and as the diſtances, or any homologous lines inverſely ; and therefore the chords of&nbsp;curvature, having the direction of the centripetal or&nbsp;centrifugal forces, and fimilarly inclined </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font0">the tangents</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">the curves defcribed by the correfponding </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">bodies, </span><span class="font0">will have the ſame ratio with the diſtances of the pan&nbsp;tides. The curves deſcribed by the correſponding bodies&nbsp;will therefore be ſimilar, the velocities will be propor-tional, and the bodies will be ſimilarly ſttuated at the&nbsp;end of the firſt moment, and expofed to the action of&nbsp;ſimilar and fimilarly fituated centripetal or centrifugal&nbsp;forces; and this will again produce fimilar motions during the next moment, and fo on for ever. All this is&nbsp;evident to any perſon acquainted with the elementary&nbsp;doctrines of curvilineal motions, as delivered in the&nbsp;theory of phyfical aſtronomy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this fundamental propofition, it clearly follows, that if two ſimilar bodies, having their homologous&nbsp;lines proportional to thoſe of the two ſyſtems, be fimi-larly projected among the bodies of thoſe two ſyſterirs&nbsp;with any velocities, they will produce fimilar.motions in&nbsp;the two ſyſtems, and will themſelves continue to move&nbsp;fimilarly ; and therefore will, in every ſubſequent moment,&nbsp;ſuffer fimilar diminutions or retardations. If the initial&nbsp;velocities of projection be the ſame, but the denfities of&nbsp;the two ſyſtems, that is, the quantities of matter con-tained in an equal bulk or extent, be different, it is evi-dent that the quantities of motion produced in the two&nbsp;ſyſtems in the ſame time will be proportional to the denſities ; and if the denſities are the ſame, and uniform in&nbsp;each ſyſtem, the quantities of motion produced will be&nbsp;as the ſquares of the velocities, becaufe the motion&nbsp;communicated to each correfponding body will be pro-portional to the velocity communicated, that is, to the&nbsp;velocity of the impelling body ; and the number of&nbsp;ſimilarly fituated particles which will be agitated will&nbsp;aſſo be proportional to. this velocity. Therefore, the&nbsp;whole quantities of motion produced in the fame moment of time will be proportional to the ſquares of the&nbsp;velocities. And laſtly, if the denſtties of the two ſyſtems are uniform, or the ſame through the whole extent of the ſyſtems, the number of particles impelled&nbsp;by fimilar bodies will be as the ſurfaces of theſe&nbsp;bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Now the diminutions of the motions of the projected bodies are (by Newton’s third law of motion) equal to&nbsp;the motions produced in the ſyſtems; and theſe diminu-tions are the meaſures of what are called the reſtſtances&nbsp;oppofed to the motions of the projected bodies. Therefore, combining all theſe circumſtances, the refiſtances&nbsp;are proportional to the fimilar ſurfaces of the moving&nbsp;bodies, to the denſities of the ſyſtems through which the&nbsp;motions are performed, and to the fquares of the velocities, jointly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">we cannot form to ourſelves auy diſtinct notion of a fluid, otherwiſe than as a ſyſtem of ſmall bodies, or a&nbsp;collection of particles, ſimilarly or ſymmetrically arranged, the centres of each being fituated in the angles of&nbsp;regular folids. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">W</span><span class="font0">e muſt form this notion of it, whether we ſuppoſc, with the vulgar, that the particles are&nbsp;little globules in mutual contact, or, with the partiſans&nbsp;of corpufcular attractions and repulfιons, we ſuppoſe&nbsp;the particles kept at a diſtance from each other by&nbsp;means of theſe attractions and repιdfions mutually balancing each other. In this laſt caſe, no other arrangement is confiſtent with a quielcent equilibrium : and in&nbsp;this caſe, it is evident, from the theory of curvilineal&nbsp;motions, that the agitations of the particles will always&nbsp;be ſuch, that the connecting forces, in actual exertion,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
