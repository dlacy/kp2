<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">self to the laborious literary elucidation of geography, and to that enjoyment of the society of his friends to which he often refers in&nbsp;his correspondence as the chief happiness to which he looked forward in his retirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">His first publication after his return was </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Chart of the Banks and Currents at the Lagullas in South Africa</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1778), accompanied&nbsp;by </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">memoir. In the same year appeared </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Description of the&nbsp;Roads in Bengal and Bahar,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> &lt;t</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">·c., printed by order of the Court of&nbsp;Directors.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> This is a small 12mo, and only a book of routes. In&nbsp;1781 came out his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bengal Atlas, containing Maps of the Theatre of&nbsp;War and Commerce on that side of Hindustan, compiled from the&nbsp;original Surveys, icith Tables of Routes and Distances from Calcutta,&nbsp;through the principal Internal Navigations.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> This is in folio, and&nbsp;contains twenty-one maps, a work leaving far behind everything in&nbsp;Indian cartography published up to that date. In the same year&nbsp;Rennell read before the Royal Society, to which he had been elected&nbsp;March 8, “ An Account of the Ganges and Burrampootur Rivers.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">These were preliminary flights. His great work on Indian geography was the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Memoir of a Map of Hindustan ;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and even this&nbsp;was of gradual growth. In its first form, as published in 1783, it&nbsp;contained only pp. xiv and 132. A second edition in 1785 had considerable additions. In 1788 a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Memoir</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> was issued altogether enlarged in scope, and of this again a second edition appeared in 1792,&nbsp;and a third, still enlarged, in 1793, which contains pp. cxli + 428&nbsp;+ 51, pp. 820 in all. The work, which thus went through five developments in all, was that which especially established Rennell’s&nbsp;reputation,—though his knowledge and ability were appreciated in&nbsp;London from an early date after his return to Europe, and the continued scries of works which he issued from time to time during&nbsp;some five and thirty years spread and augmented his fame as a geographer. After a brief interval of extreme old age, the series was&nbsp;resumed in the publication of valuable posthumous works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">But, to return to earlier days, Rennell speedily found a place in the most intelligent circles of society, counting among his friends,&nbsp;as years passed on, not only men of science and literature like Sir&nbsp;Joseph Banks, Sir Everard Home, Bishop Horsley, Sir George&nbsp;Staunton, Dr Robertson the historian, Dean Vincent, Mr Alexander&nbsp;Dalrymple, Mr William Marsden, &amp;c., but also such men as Lord&nbsp;Momington (afterwards the famous Marquis Wellesley), Lord&nbsp;Spencer (first lord of the Admiralty 1794-1801), and Lord Holland.&nbsp;His closest friends appear to have been Sir Joseph Banks, Lord&nbsp;Spencer, and Dr Gillies the historian, and in later years Captain&nbsp;(afterwards Sir Francis) Beaufort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1791 he received from the Royal Society, at the hands of the president Sir Joseph Banks, the Copley medal, assigned him for&nbsp;his geographical labours, and especially for his paper </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“ On</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> the&nbsp;Camel’s Rate, as applied to Geographical Purposes.” The following passage, perhaps not quite free from exaggeration, occurs in&nbsp;the president’s address on this occasion : —</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ 1 should, rejoice could I say that Britons . . . could boast a general map of their island as well executed as the Major's delineation of Bengal and Bahar,&nbsp;a tract of countries considerably larger in extent than the whole of Great Britain&nbsp;and Ireland ; but it would be injustice to the Major’s industry, were I not here to&nbsp;state that the districts he has perambulated and planned exceed probably in&nbsp;extent the whole tract of surveyed country to be found in the maps of the&nbsp;Eurojiean kingdoms put together; while the accuracy of his particular surveys&nbsp;stands yet unrivalled by the most laborious performance of the best county maps&nbsp;this nation has hitherto been able to produce.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1792 Rennell published </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Marches of the British Army in the Peninsula of India during the Campaign of 1790-91, illustrated&nbsp;and explained by a map and other plates</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">; and in 1794 an 8vo&nbsp;pamphlet entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">War with France the only security of Britain,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">by an “ Old Englishman. ” Some years before this time Rennell had&nbsp;also turned his attention to African geography, in connexion with&nbsp;the African Association, of which he was one of the earliest members.&nbsp;Of this body, which was the progenitor, though not the immediate&nbsp;parent, of the Royal Geographical Society,@@<sup>1</sup> an account may be read&nbsp;in Air Clements Markham’s most interesting record of the fifty years’&nbsp;work of that society. The association was established in 1788,&nbsp;and sent out several travellers of note. Maps and geographical&nbsp;memoirs from Rennell’s pen were issued on various occasions ; and&nbsp;especially were his African labours associated with the name and&nbsp;first journey of Mungo Park. Rennell published in all some five&nbsp;or six dissertations on African geography. And this branch of his&nbsp;work may account, after a fashion, for an odd confusion made in&nbsp;a public report of Livingstone’s burial in Westminster Abbey.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> whose atmosphere in those days was not confined to the same rarefied altitudes as at present, contain occasional papers from Rennell’s hand. We have mentioned the&nbsp;paper on “Camel’s Rate ” in 1791 ; in 1793 we have “ Observations&nbsp;on a Current that often prevails to the westward of Seilly, and&nbsp;endangers the safety of ships” (the current in question has since&nbsp;been known by Rennell’s name), in 1809 “ On the Effect of Westerly&nbsp;Winds in raising the Level of the British Channel.” In the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Archscologia</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> we find the following:—in vol. xvii. p. 242, “Observations on the Topography of Ancient Babylon,” and in vol.&nbsp;xxi. three dissertations:—(1) p. 92, “On the Voyage and Place of&nbsp;Shipwreck of St Paul”; (2) p. 138, “Concerning the Identity of the&nbsp;Remains at Jerasli, whether they are those of Gerasa or Pella ” ; (3)&nbsp;p. 501, read May 1S26, when the venerable author was in his&nbsp;<sup>!</sup> eighty-fourth year, “Concerning the place where Julius Caesar&nbsp;landed in Britain. ” This does not, we believe, exhaust the list of&nbsp;his occasional writings, and he gave much incidental help to other&nbsp;writers who touched liis own subjects, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">c.g.,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> to Dean Vincent in his&nbsp;well-known work on the Commerce and Navigation of the Ancients.&nbsp;The detail of these minor works has carried us away from the&nbsp;chronological order of his productions. That which added most&nbsp;largely to the reputation acquired as the geographer of India was&nbsp;his book on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Geographical System of Herodotus,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 4to, with eleven&nbsp;maps (1800). Another great task undertaken by him was a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Treatise&nbsp;on the Comparative Geography of Western Asia.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> On this field he&nbsp;had formed a most comprehensive project, too vast indeed for the&nbsp;time of life at which he undertook it, when probably he had already&nbsp;reached threescore. Of this project his Herodotus was indeed&nbsp;itself a portion, and others were his separate publications of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dissertation on the Topography of the Plain of Troy</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (4to, 1811), and&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Illustrations of the Expeditions of</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> , </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cxjrus and the Retreat of&nbsp;the Ten Thousand,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and an additional mass of matter, prepared with&nbsp;many years’ labour, and left behind him in a very perfect state of&nbsp;transcription, was published after his death by his daughter, in 2&nbsp;vols. 8vo, with an atlas (1831).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Another posthumous work was </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">An Investigation of the Currents of the Atlantic Ocean, and of those which prevail between the Indian&nbsp;Ocean and the Atlantic.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> For this work Rennell had examined and&nbsp;collated the logs of a vast number of the ships of war and Indiamen&nbsp;which had traversed those seas during thirty or forty years, re-computing observations, and reducing them to one general system. The&nbsp;results of this toil were left ready for the press, and were published&nbsp;in large charts, with a thin volume of text, under the editorship of&nbsp;Mr John Purdy, in 1832. The first contributions to the scientific&nbsp;knowledge of currents had been Rennell’s papers on the Lagullas,&nbsp;and on the Seilly Currents, and the present work contained nearly&nbsp;all that existed in the generalization of such data till more than&nbsp;twenty years after his death.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“Major Rennell,” says an account of him, in a work privately printed by a member of his wife’s family,@@<sup>4</sup> “was of middle size,&nbsp;well proportioned, with a grave yet sweet expression on his countenance, which is said to have conciliated the regard of all he&nbsp;spoke with.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The existence of this happy faculty we have already noticed as deducible from his earlier history in India. The sweet gravity of&nbsp;which the writer speaks is very recognizable in liis portraits, alike&nbsp;in middle life and in extreme old age.@@<sup>5</sup> A contemporary, quoted in&nbsp;the work just referred to, said of him :—“ In his intercourse with&nbsp;his friends he possesses a remarkable flow of spirits, and abounds&nbsp;with interesting subjects of conversation ; at the same time, as to&nbsp;what relates to himself, he is one of the most diffident, unassuming&nbsp;men in the world.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">One of the obituary notices at the time of his death says that Rennell’s “political and religious feelings are said to have operated&nbsp;in causing him to decline the acceptance of an invitation to become&nbsp;a member of the French National Institute.” This can hardly have&nbsp;had any basis of fact. Rennell, in politics, was always attached to&nbsp;what would be called, in present language, the Liberal party; though&nbsp;his Liberalism, as we may gather from the title of his pamphlet of&nbsp;1794, and from expressions used in the dedication to Earl Spencer&nbsp;of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herodotus,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> had nothing of that character which loves to disparage those who are jealous for the greatness of England. As a&nbsp;matter of fact lie was elected a foreign associate of the Institute&nbsp;during the peace of Amiens, in 1802, and accepted the honour with&nbsp;unmistakable cordiality and satisfaction, as his reply, which we&nbsp;have seen, testifies. In his eighty-third year a gold medal was&nbsp;awarded to Rennell by the Royal Society of Literature ; and, as&nbsp;his infirmities prevented his attendance at their place of meeting, a&nbsp;deputation, headed by the president, visited him for the purpose of&nbsp;presenting it at his own house in Nassau Street.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">When more than eighty-seven years of age Major Rennell slipped from a chair, and broke his thigh. He hardly ever left his bed&nbsp;afterwards, and died 29tli March 1830. He was buried in the nave&nbsp;of Westminster Abbey on the 6th April. A tablet to his memory,&nbsp;with a bust, stands in the north-west angle of the nave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Mrs Rennell had died in 1810. Three children of the marriage</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup></span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was an intermediate body called the Raleigh Club, founded in 1826-27,&nbsp;which actually developed into the R. G. S. Renncll’s great age doubtless prevented his joining the club. The society was founded the month after liis death.</span></p>
