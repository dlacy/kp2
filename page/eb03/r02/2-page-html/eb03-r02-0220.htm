<p><span class="font0">was viewing the tomb of Achilles, he took it into his head to reſemble that hero; and one of his ſreedmen&nbsp;happening to die at that time, he uſed the ſame ceremonies that were performed at the tomb of Patroclus.&nbsp;Paſſing thence into Egypt, he maſſacred in the moſt&nbsp;terrible manner the inhabitants of Alexandria, on account of the ſatires they compoſed on him, as is related&nbsp;under the article Alexandria</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Going from thence into Syria, he invited Artabanus king of Parthia to a conference; deſiring his daughter in marriage, and promiſing him the moſt honourable protection. In conſequence of this, that king&nbsp;met him on a ſpacious plain, unarmed, and only attended with a vaſt concourſe of his nobles. This was what&nbsp;Caracalla deſired. Regardleſs of his promiſe, or the&nbsp;law of nations, he inſtantly ſurrounded him with armed&nbsp;troops, let in wild beaſts among his attendants, and&nbsp;made a moſt terrible ſlaughter among them; Artabanus himſelſ eſcaping with the utmoſt difficulty. For&nbsp;this vile treachery he obtained ſrom the ſenate the ſurname of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Parthicus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon his return towards Rome, it would ſeem as if his vices were inexhauſtible; ſor having been guilty of&nbsp;parricide, he now reſolved to marry the mother of Geta&nbsp;whom he had ſlain. It happened that one day ſeeing&nbsp;her drop her veil, which diſcloſed her naked boſom,&nbsp;which was extremely beautiful, he told her, that he&nbsp;would poſſeſs thoſe charms he beheld, if it were lawful.&nbsp;To this unnatural requeſt ſhe heſitated not to anſwer,&nbsp;that he might enjoy all things who poſſeſſed all. Whereupon, ſetting aſide all duty and reſpect for his deceaſed&nbsp;ſather, he celebrated his nuptials with her in public, to&nbsp;tally diſregarding the cenſures and the ſarcaſms of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However, though he diſregarded ſhame, he was not inſenſible to fear. He was ever uneaſy in the conſci-ouſneſs of being univerſally hated; and was continually&nbsp;conſulting aſtrologers concerning what death he ſhould&nbsp;die. Among others, he ſent one of his confidants, named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Maternianus,</span><span class="font0"> with orders to conſult all the aſtrolo-gers in the city concerning his end. Maternianus conſidered this as a proper time to get rid of Macrinus,&nbsp;the emperor’s principal commander in Meſopotamia;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">man who was daily ſupplanting him in his maſter’s&nbsp;favour. He therefore informed him by letter, as if&nbsp;from the aſtrologers, that Macrinus had a deſign againſt&nbsp;his liſe; and they conſequently adviſed him to put the&nbsp;conſpirator to death. This letter was ſent ſealed, and&nbsp;made up, amongſt many others, to be conveyed with&nbsp;the greater ſecrecy, and delivered to the emperor as he&nbsp;was preparing for a chariot race. However, as it never&nbsp;was his cuſtom to interrupt his pleaſures for his buſineſs, he gave the packet to Macrinus to read over, and&nbsp;to inform him of the contents when more at leiſure.&nbsp;In peruſing theſe letters, when Macrinus came to that&nbsp;which regarded himſelf, he was unable to contain his&nbsp;ſurpriſe and terror. His firſt care was, to reſerve the&nbsp;fetter in queſtion to himſelf, and to acquaint the emperor only with the ſubſtance of the reſt. He then&nbsp;ſet about the moſt probable means of compaſſing his&nbsp;death, by which alone he could expect any ſafety. At&nbsp;length he determined to apply to one Martialis, a man&nbsp;of</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font0">great ſtrength, and a centurion of the guards, who&nbsp;hated the emperor from various motives; particularly&nbsp;for the death of </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">brother, whom Caracalla had ordered&nbsp;to be ſlain. Him therefore Macrinus exhorted to revenge his brother’s death, by killing the tyrant, which&nbsp;he might eaſily effect, as being always ſo near his perſon Martialis readily undertook the dangerous taſk;&nbsp;being willing to meet death himſelf, ſo he might obtain his deſire of ſeeing the tyrant expire before him.&nbsp;Accordingly, as the emperor was riding out one day&nbsp;near a little city called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Carra,</span><span class="font0"> he happened to withdraw himſelf privately, upon a natural occaſion, with&nbsp;only one page to hold his horſe. This was the opportunity Martialis had ſo long and ardently deſired;&nbsp;wherefore running to him as if he had been called, he&nbsp;ſtabbed the emperor in the back, ſo that he died immediately. Martialis unconcernedly returned to his&nbsp;troop; but retiring by inſenſible degrees, he endeavoured to ſecure himſelf by flight. But his companions&nbsp;ſoon miſſing him, and the page giving information of&nbsp;what had been done, he was purſued by the German&nbsp;horſe and cut in pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the reign of this execrable tyrant, which continued ſix years, the empire was every day declining;&nbsp;the ſoldiers were entirely maſters of every election; and&nbsp;as there were various armies in different parts, ſo there&nbsp;were as many intereſts all oppoſite to each other. Caracalla, by ſatisfying their moſt unreaſonable appetites,&nbsp;deſtroyed all diſcipline among them, and all ſubordination in the ſtate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſoldiers, now without an emperor, after a ſuſpenſe of two days, fixed upon Macrinus, who took all poſſible methods to conceal his being privy to Caracalla’s murder. The ſenate confirmed their choice ſhortly after; and likewiſe that of his ſon Diadumenus,&nbsp;whom he took as a partner in the empire. Macrinus&nbsp;was 53 years old when he entered upon the government&nbsp;of the empire. He was of obſcure parentage; ſome&nbsp;ſay by birth a Moor, who by the mere rotation of office, being firſt made prefect of the prætorian bands,&nbsp;was now, by treaſon and accident, called to fill the&nbsp;throne. We are told but little of this emperor, except&nbsp;his engaging in a bloody though undecided battle with&nbsp;Artabanus king of Parthia, who came to take vengeance&nbsp;for the injury he had ſuſtained in the late reign: however, this monarch finding his real enemy dead, was&nbsp;content to make peace, and returned into Parthia.&nbsp;Something is alſo ſaid of the ſeverity of this emperor’s&nbsp;diſcipline; ſor to ſuch a pitch of licentiouſneſs was the&nbsp;Roman army now arrived, that the moſt ſevere puniſhments were unable to reſtrain the ſoldiers; and yet the&nbsp;moſt gentle inflictions were looked upon as ſeverity. It&nbsp;was this rigorous diſcipline, together with the artifices&nbsp;of Mæſa, grandmother to Heliogabalus the natural ſon&nbsp;of Caracalla, that cauſed the emperor’s ruin. Heliogabalus was prieſt of a temple dedicated to the Sun, in&nbsp;Emeſa, a city of Phoenicia; and though but 14 years&nbsp;old was greatly loved by the army for the beauty of&nbsp;his perſon, and the memory of his father, whom they&nbsp;ſtill conſidered as their greateſt benefactor. This was&nbsp;ſoon perceived by the grandmother </span><span class="font1">5 </span><span class="font0">who being very&nbsp;rich in gold and jewels, gave liberal preſents among&nbsp;them, while they frequently repaired to the temple,&nbsp;both from the garriſon in the city and the camp of Macrinus. This intercourſe growing every day more frequent, the ſoldiers, being diſguſted with the ſeverities&nbsp;of their preſent emperor, began to think of placing Heliogabalus in his ſtead. Accordingly, ſending for him</span></p>
