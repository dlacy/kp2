                southward he met and utterly defeated the forces&nbsp;which the Etruscans had
                hastily raised in the hopes of&nbsp;intercepting him at the Vadimonian
                    Lake.@@<sup>1</sup> This decisive&nbsp;victory ended the war. The Etruscan
                cities, disunited&nbsp;among themselves, and enervated by long years of
                peace,&nbsp;abandoned the struggle for the time, paid a heavy indemnity, and
                concluded a truce with Rome (309-308). In&nbsp;the same year the promptitude of
                Fabius easily averted a&nbsp;threatened attack by the Umbrians, but Rome
                proceeded&nbsp;nevertheless to fortify herself in her invariable
                fashion&nbsp;against future dangers on this side, by an alliance
                with&nbsp;Ocriculum, which was followed ten years later by a colony&nbsp;at
                    Nequinum,@@<sup>2</sup> and an alliance with the Picentes, whose&nbsp;position
                in the rear of Umbria rendered them as valuable&nbsp;to Rome as the Apulians had
                proved farther south.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Fourteen years had passed since the battle on the Vadimonian Lake,
                when the Samnites appeared on the&nbsp;borders of Etruria and called on the peoples
                of northern&nbsp;Italy to rise against the common enemy. Their appeal,&nbsp;backed
                by the presence of their troops, was successful.&nbsp;The Etruscans found courage to
                face the Roman legions&nbsp;once more; a few of the Umbrians joined them; but
                the&nbsp;most valuable allies to the Samnites were the Celts, who&nbsp;had for some
                time threatened a raid across the Apennines,&nbsp;and who now marched eagerly into
                Umbria and joined&nbsp;the coalition. The news that the Celts were in
                motion&nbsp;produced a startling effect at Rome, and every nerve was&nbsp;strained
                to meet this new danger. While two armies were&nbsp;left in southern Etruria as
                reserves, the two consuls, Fabius&nbsp;and Decius, both tried soldiers, marched
                northwards up&nbsp;the valley of the Tiber and into Umbria at the head of&nbsp;four
                Roman legions and a still larger force of Italian&nbsp;allies. At Sentinum, on the
                further side of the Apennines,&nbsp;they encountered the united forces of the Celts
                and&nbsp;Samnites, the Etruscans and Umbrians having, it is&nbsp;said, been
                withdrawn for the defence of their own homes.&nbsp;The battle that followed was
                desperate, and the Romans&nbsp;lost one of their consuls, Decius, and more than
                    8000&nbsp;men.@@<sup>3</sup> But the Roman victory was decisive. The
                Celts&nbsp;were annihilated, and the fear of a second Celtic attack&nbsp;on Rome
                removed. All danger from the coalition was&nbsp;over. The Etruscan communities
                gladly purchased peace&nbsp;by the payment of indemnities. The rising in
                Umbria,&nbsp;never formidable, died away, and the Samnites were&nbsp;left
                single-handed to bear the whole weight of the&nbsp;wrath of Rome. During four years
                more, however, they&nbsp;desperately defended their highland homes, and
                twice&nbsp;at least, in 293 and 292, they managed to place in the field&nbsp;a force
                sufficient to meet the Roman legions on equal&nbsp;terms. At last, in 290, the
                consul M. Curius Dentatus&nbsp;finally exhausted their power of resistance. Peace
                was&nbsp;concluded, and it is significant of the respect inspired at&nbsp;Rome by
                their indomitable courage that they were&nbsp;allowed to become the allies of Rome,
                on equal terms and&nbsp;without any sacrifice of
            independence.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>

                engaged, as&nbsp;her wont was, in quietly extending and consolidating
                her&nbsp;power. In southern Italy she strengthened her hold on&nbsp;Apulia by
                planting on the borders of Apulia and Lucania&nbsp;the strong colony of
                    Venusia.@@<sup>5</sup> In central Italy the&nbsp;annexation of the Sabine
                country (290) carried her&nbsp;frontiers eastward to the borders of her Picentine
                allies&nbsp;on the Adriatic.@@<sup>6</sup> Farther east, in the territory of
                the</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Picentes themselves, she established colonies on the Adriatic coast
                at IIatria and Castrum (285-283).@@<sup>7</sup> By&nbsp;these measures her control
                of central Italy from sea to sea&nbsp;was secured, and an effectual barrier
                interposed between&nbsp;her possible enemies in the north and those in the
                south.&nbsp;North of the Picentes lay the territories of the Celtic&nbsp;Senones,
                stretching inland to the north-east borders of&nbsp;Etruria, and these too now fell
                into her hands. Ten&nbsp;years after their defeat at Sentinum (285-284) a
                Celtic&nbsp;force descended into Etruria, besieged Arretium, and&nbsp;defeated the
                relieving force despatched by Rome. In&nbsp;283 the consul L. Cornelius Dolabella
                was sent to avenge&nbsp;the insult. He completely routed the Senones.
                Their&nbsp;lands were annexed by Rome, and a colony established at&nbsp;Sena on the
                coast. This success, followed as it was by the&nbsp;decisive defeat of the
                neighbouring tribe of the Boii,&nbsp;who had invaded Etruria and penetrated as far
                south as&nbsp;the Vadimonian Lake, awed the Celts into quiet, and for&nbsp;more than
                forty years there was comparative tranquillity&nbsp;in northern
                Italy.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">In the south, however, the claims of Rome to supremacy were now to be
                disputed by a new and formidable foe. At the close of the Third Samnite War the
                Greek&nbsp;cities on the southern coast of Italy found themselves&nbsp;once more
                harassed by the Sabellian tribes on their borders,&nbsp;whose energies, no longer
                absorbed by the long struggles&nbsp;in central Italy, now found an attractive
                opening southward. Naturally enough the Greeks, like the Capuans&nbsp;sixty years
                before, appealed for aid to Rome (283-282),&nbsp;and like the Capuans they offered
                in return to recognize&nbsp;the suzerainty of the great Latin republic. In reply
                a&nbsp;Roman force under C. Fabricius marched into South Italy,&nbsp;easily routed
                the marauding bands of Lucanians, Bruttians,&nbsp;and Samnites, and established
                Roman garrisons in Locri.&nbsp;Croton, Rhegium, and Thurii. At Tarentum, the
                most&nbsp;powerful and flourishing of the Greek seaports, this&nbsp;sudden and rapid
                advance of Rome excited the greatest&nbsp;anxiety. . Tarentum was already allied by
                treaty (301)&nbsp;with Rome, and she had now to decide whether this
                treaty&nbsp;should be exchanged for one which would place her, like&nbsp;the other
                Greek communities, under the protectorate of&nbsp;Rome, or whether she should find
                some ally able and&nbsp;willing to assist in making a last stand for
                independence.&nbsp;The former course, in Tarentum, as before at Capua, was&nbsp;the
                one favoured by the aristocratic party ; the latter was&nbsp;eagerly supported by
                the mass of the people and their&nbsp;leaders. While matters were still in suspense,
                the appearance, contrary to . the treaty, of a Roman squadron off the&nbsp;harbour
                decided the controversy. The Tarentines, indignant at the insult, attacked the
                hostile fleet, killed the&nbsp;admiral, and sunk most of the ships. Still Rome,
                relying&nbsp;probably on her partisans in the city, tried negotiation,&nbsp;and an
                alliance appeared likely after all, when suddenly&nbsp;the help for which the
                Tarentine democrats had been&nbsp;looking appeared, and war with Rome was resolved
                    upon&nbsp;(281-280).@@<sup>9</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">King Pyrrhus, whose timely appearance seemed for the moment to have
                saved the independence of Tarentum,&nbsp;was the most brilliant of the military
                adventurers whom&nbsp;the disturbed times following the death of Alexander&nbsp;the
                Great had brought into prominence. High-spirited,&nbsp;generous, and ambitious, he
                had formed the scheme of&nbsp;rivalling Alexander’s achievements in the East, by
                winning&nbsp;for himself an empire in the West. He aspired not only&nbsp;to unite
                under his rule the Greek communities of Italy&nbsp;and Sicily, but to overthrow the
                great Phoenician state of&nbsp;Carthage—the natural enemy of Greeks in the West,
                as&nbsp;Persia had been in the East. Of Rome it is clear that he</span></p>
