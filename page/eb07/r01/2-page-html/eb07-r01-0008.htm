<p><span class="font0">more correctly, he taught them to speak and not to declaim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Asto his works, his countrymen have reason to be proud of them. He is the poet of theheart and the affections, and yields&nbsp;to none in the truth, the beauty, and the force of his delineations. If Corneillesurpassed him in heroic sentiments, and the&nbsp;grand character of his personages, he was inferior to Racine&nbsp;in moving the passions, and in purity of diction. Such is&nbsp;the perfection of Racine in this last respect, that in all his&nbsp;pieces, there is not perhaps, we do not say a scene, but even&nbsp;a single verse, which could be replaced by another. All is&nbsp;just and true ; all is full of that poetry of images and sentiments, and that continued elegance which, since the time&nbsp;of the Greeks, Virgil and Racine have alone possessed.&nbsp;But above all, it is in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther</span><span class="font0"> and in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie,</span><span class="font0"> particularly&nbsp;in the choruses of these two tragedies, that, sustained by the&nbsp;most sublime models, he is himself almost always sublime.&nbsp;It is there that Racine has all the elevation of a Hebrew&nbsp;prophet, who had come to announce divine truths in strains&nbsp;almost divine. But that which chiefly characterises Racine&nbsp;is the complete union, perhaps unique, of two qualities&nbsp;which appear to be incompatible ; of imagination the most&nbsp;brilliant, and reason the most perfect, of sensibility the&nbsp;most exquisite, with good sense the most invariable. Reason, in fact, as much and even more perhaps than imagination, predominates in the conception of his most touching&nbsp;productions, in the execution of his most dramatic scenes,&nbsp;in the choice of his richest expressions, and in his boldest&nbsp;combinations, as well as most elliptical turns. Boileau, who&nbsp;has been surnamed the poet of reason, is not, even in this&nbsp;view, superior to Racine ; and, besides, the quality here&nbsp;mentioned is the less astonishing in him, because it is accompanied with an imagination much less lively. Racine&nbsp;has often been pronounced the greatest of the French poets.&nbsp;He should also be set down as the most rational ; or rather,&nbsp;it is precisely because he really is the most rational, that he&nbsp;is likewise the greatest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are some smaller pieces of Racine which hate not been mentioned in the course of this article, particularly&nbsp;Idylle sur la Paix, 1685 ; Discours prononcé à l’Académie&nbsp;Française, en 1685 ; Cantiques Spirituelles, 1689 ; and&nbsp;Epigrammes Diverses. The most complete edition of the&nbsp;Works of Racine is that which M. Aimé Martin published at&nbsp;Paris in six vols. 8vo. in 1820, reprinted by Lefèvre in 1822.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RACING, the riding heats for a plate, Or other premium. The amusement of horse-racing, which is now so common,&nbsp;was not unknown amongst the great nations of antiquity,&nbsp;nor wholly unpractised even by our ancestors in Britain. In&nbsp;1599, private matches between gentlemen, who rode their&nbsp;own horses, were very common; and in the reignof James I.&nbsp;public races were established at various places, when the&nbsp;discipline, and mode of preparing the horses for running,&nbsp;were much the same as they are now. The most celebrated races of that time were called bell-courses, the prize of&nbsp;the conqueror being a bell ; and hence, perhaps, is derived&nbsp;the phrase “ bearing the bell,” when applied to excellence.&nbsp;For a full account of the race-horse, see Hokse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RACK, Edmund, a person well known in the literary world by his attachment to, and promotion of, agricultural&nbsp;knowledge. He was a native of Norfolk, and a Quaker.&nbsp;His education was common, and he was originally apprenticed to a shopkeeper. In this situation his society was select, and by improving himself in learning, his conversation&nbsp;was enjoyed by some respectable acquaintance. He wrote&nbsp;many essays, poems, and letters, and some few controversial tracts. His last engagement was the History of Somersetshire, where the parochial surveys were his. This&nbsp;work, in three volumes 4to. was published in 1791, by his&nbsp;colleague, Mr. Collinson. Mr. Rack died of an asthma in&nbsp;February 1787, aged fifty-two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rack, an engine of torture, furnished with pulleys, cords, and other means, for extorting confession from criminals.&nbsp;The trial by rack is unknown to the law of England ; though&nbsp;once, when the Dukes of Exeter and Suffolk, and other mi-nisters of Henry VI. had formed a design to introduce the civil&nbsp;law into this kingdom as the rule of government, they erected a rack for torture, which was called in derision the Duke&nbsp;of Exeter's Daughter, and still remains in the Tower of London, where it was occasionally used as an engine of state,&nbsp;not of law, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. But when,&nbsp;upon the assassination of Villiers duke of Buckingham, by&nbsp;Felton, it was proposed in the privy council to put the assassin&nbsp;to the rack in order to discover his accomplices, the judges,&nbsp;being consulted, declared unanimously, that no such proceeding was allowable by the laws of England. It seems&nbsp;astonishing that the usage of administering the torture&nbsp;should be said to arise from tenderness to the lives of men ;&nbsp;and yet this is the reason assigned for its introduction&nbsp;in the civil law, and its subsequent adoption by the French&nbsp;and other foreign nations, namely, because the laws cannot&nbsp;endure that any man should die upon the evidence of a&nbsp;false or even a single witness, and therefore contrived this&nbsp;method that innocence should manifest itself by a stout denial, or guilt by a plain confession ; thus rating a man’s virtue by the hardiness of his constitution, and his guilt by&nbsp;the sensibility of his nerves. The Marquis of Beccaria, in&nbsp;an exquisite piece of raillery, has proposed this problem,&nbsp;with a gravity and precision that are truly mathematical :&nbsp;“ The force of the muscles and the sensibility of the nerves&nbsp;of an innocent person being given ; it is required to find&nbsp;the degree of pain necessary to make him confess himself&nbsp;guilty of a given crime.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">RaCONIGHI, a city of the province of Saluzzo</span><span class="font0"><sub>1</sub> in the kingdom of Sardinia in Italy. It is situated on the river&nbsp;Maira, where there is a magnificent palace of the Prince Car-ignan. It contains four monastic and two parish churches,&nbsp;and 1300 houses, with 11,200 inhabitants, who produce silk,&nbsp;and make it into various articles, and have also a considerable trade in corn, as well as in raw and organzined silk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RADCLIFFE, Mbs. Ann, the celebrated author of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romance of the Forest,</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mysteries of Udolpho,</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;born in London on the 9th of July 1764. She was the&nbsp;daughter of William and Ann Ward, who, though in trade,&nbsp;were respectably connected, and nearly the only persons of&nbsp;their two families not living in handsome, or at least easy&nbsp;independence. Her paternal grandmother was a Chesel-den, the sister of the celebrated surgeon, of whose kind regard her father had a grateful recollection ; and her maternal grandmother was Anne Oates, sister of Dr. Samuel&nbsp;Jebb of Stratford, the father of Sir Richard, on which side&nbsp;she was also related to Dr. Halifax, bishop of Gloucester,&nbsp;and to a gentleman of the same name, who was physician&nbsp;to the king. Of the history of her early years, during which&nbsp;the mind usually gives indications of its prevailing tendencies, no record whatever has been preserved. About the&nbsp;time of her twentieth year, however, she is described as possessing a figure exquisitely proportioned, a fine complexion,&nbsp;a beautiful and expressive countenance, and tastes which&nbsp;led her to take delight in contemplating the glories of creation, particularly the grander features they display, listening to music skilfully performed, hearing passages from the&nbsp;Greek and Latin classics recited and translated, and preferring the pleasures of meditation to those of society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus respectably born and connected, Miss Ward, at the age of twenty-three, acquired the name which she subsequently rendered so celebrated, by marrying Mr. William&nbsp;Radcliffe, a graduate of Oxford, and then a student of law.&nbsp;This gentleman, however, renounced the prosecution of his&nbsp;legal studies, and afterwards became proprietor and editor&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">English Chronicle.</span><span class="font0"> Mrs. Radcliffe having thus a</span></p>
