Inſtead of attempting to gain the hearts of his ſubjects, he gave himſelf up to eaſe and inactivity, utterly regardleſs oſ the duties of his ſtation. He was mild and gentle indeed ; neither injuring any nor expecting to be injured. But that avarice, by which he became opulent, ſtill followed him in his exaltation ; ſo that the very ſoldiers who elected him, ſoon began to deteſt him ſor thoſe qualities, ſo very oppoſite to a military character. The people alſo, againſt whoſe conſent he was choſen, were no leſs inimical. Whenever he iſſued from his palace, they openly poured forth their imprecations againſt him ; crying out, that he was a thief, and had ſtolen the empire. Didius, however, in the true ſpirit of a trader, patiently bore it all ; ſometimes beckoning them with ſmiles to approach him, and teſtifying his regard by every kind oi ſubmiflion.</p><p>While Didius was thus contemptuouſly treated at home, two valiant generals, in different parts of the empire, diſclaimed his authority, and boldly reſolved to attempt the throne for themſelves. Theſe were, Peſe cenniιιs Niger, governor of Syria ; and Septimius Severus, commander of the German legions. Niger was beloved by the people for his clemency and valour; and the report of his propoſing Pertinax for his model, and reſolving to revenge his death, gained him univerſal eſteem among the people. Being thus appriſed of their inclinations, he eaſily induced his army in Syria to proclaim him emperor ; and his title was, ſhortly after, acknowledged by all the kings and potentates in Aſia, who ſent their ambaſſadors to him as their lawful prince. The pleaſure of being thus treated as a monarch, in ſome meaſure retarded his endeavours to ſecure his title. Entirely ſatisfied with the homage of thoſe about him, he neglected the opportunities of ſuppreffing his rivals ; and gave himſelf up to luxury and feaſting at Antioch. The conduct of Severus, an African by birth, was very different. Being proclaimed by his army, he began by promiſing to revenge the death of Pertinax, and took upon him his name. He next ſecured the fidelity of all the ſtrong places in his province ; and then reſolved, with the utmoſt expedition, to march with his whole force directly to Rome.</p><p>In the mean time, Didius, who diſregarded the attempts of Niger, was greatly alarmed at thoſe of Severus. He firſt, with many ſolicitations, procured the ſenate to proclaim him a traitor. He then applied himſelf to make the neceſſary proviſions to oppoſe him, in which lie found nothing but diſappointment. The cohorts that elected him were enervated by vice and luxury; the people deteſted his cauſe; and the citie3 of Italy had long been difofed to the arts of war. Some adviſed him to march forward, and meet Severus as he was croſſing the Alps ; others were for ſending the generals upon that expedition. The unfortunate Didius, unequal to the talk of empire, and quite confouneled with the multiplicity of counſels, could take no other ιefolutio∙n but that of awaiting his rival’s coming at Rome. Accordingly, ſoon after being informed of his approach, he obtained the conſent of the ſenate to fend Ids, ambaſſadors, offering to make him a partner of the empire. But Severus rejected this offer, conſcious of his own ſtrength, and of the weakneſs of the propoſer. The ſenate ſoon appeared of the ſarae ſentiments ; and</p><lb/><p>perceiving the timidity and weakneſs of their preſent maſter, began to abandon him, alleging, that he who could not defend the empire was not worthy to govern it. Didins vainly endeavoured to reduce them to their duty, firſt by intreaties, and then by threats; but theſe only ſerved to halfen his deſtruction. The ſenate being called together, as was formerly practiſed in the times of the commonwealth by the conſuls, they unanimouſly decreed, That Didius ſhould be deprived of the empire, and that Severus ſhould be proclaimed in his ſtead. They then commanded Didius to be ſlain ; and ſent meſſengers for this purpoſe to the palace,· where they found him diſarmed, and weeping among a lew friends that ſtill adhered to his intereſt. When· the executioners began to prepare for their fatal errand, he expoſtulated with them, demanding what crime he had committed ? He could not be perſuaded to think, that paying his money, and receiving an empire in exchange, deſerved ſo ſevere a puniſhment. Ί he executioners, however, were neither able nor willing to enter into the merits of the cauſe; they preſently led him into the ſecret baths of the palace, and obliging him to ſtretch his neck forwards, after the manner of condemned criminals, ſtruck off his head, and placed it up in thoſe courts where he had formerly pleaded with great ſucceſs.</p><p>The ſenate having thus diſpatched Didius, ſent ambaſſadors to Severus, yielding him obedience, granting him the enſigns and the uſual titles of empire, and informing him of the death of Didius. Severus, who was now about 47 years of age, received them with all proper reſpect ; and entertaining them honourably continued his march towards Rome. As he came near the city, his firſt exertion of power was, to have all the ρrastorian ſoldiers who had lately fold the empire come forth unarmed to meet him. Tlieſe, though ſenſible of their danger, had no other reſource left but compliance ; and accordingly came forward with branches of « laurel, as if to welcome his approach. Severus, however, ſoon ſhowed how little capable their preſent ſubmiſſion was to atone for their paſt offences : after upbraiding them, in a ſhort ſpeech, with all their crimes, he commanded them to be inſtantly ſtripped of their military habits, deprived of the name and honour of ſoldiers, and baniſhed 100 miles from Rome. He then entered the city in a military manner, took poſſeſſion of the palace, and promiſed the ſenate to conduct himſelf with clemency and juſtice. However, though he united great vigour with the moſt refined policy, yet his African cunning was conſidered as a particular defect in him. He is celebrated for his wit, learning, and prudence ; but equally blamed for infidelity and cruelty. In ſhort, he ſeemed alike diſpoſed to the. peιformance of the gieateſt acts of virtue and the moſt bloody ſeverities. He began his command, by ſeizing ail the children of ſuch as had employments or authority in the eaſt, and detained them as pledges for their fathers loy<hi rend="sup">r</hi>aky. He next ſupplied the city with corn j and then with all poſſible expedition marched againſt. Niger, who was ſtill conſidered and honoured as emperor of the eaſt.</p><p>One of the chief obſtacles to his march was, the leaving behind him Clodius Albinus, commander of the legions in Britain, whom he by all means wiſhed to ſecure in his intereſts, Tor this end, he endeavoured to</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
