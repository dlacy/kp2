            <p>SIGNATURE, a ſign or mark impreſſed upon any thing, whether by nature or art. Such is
                the general ſignification of the word ; but in the plural number it has been uſed,
                in a particular ſenſe, to denote thoſe external marks by which phyſiognomiſts and
                other dabblers in the occult ſciences pretend to diſcover the nature and internal
                qualities of every thing on which they are found. According to Lavater, every
                corporeal object is characterized by ſignatures peculiar to itſelf.</p>
            <p>The doctrine of ſignatures, like alchemy and aſtrology, was very prevalent during the
                15th and 16th centuries ; and was conſidered as one of the occult ſciences which
                conferred no ſmall degree of honour on their respective profeſſors. Some of theſe
                philosophers, as they thought fit to ſtyle themselves, maintained that plants,
                minerals, and animals, but particularly plants, had ſignatures impreſſed on them by
                the hand of nature, indicating to the adept the <hi rend="italic">therapeutic</hi>
                uſes to which they might be applied. Others, ſuch as the myſtic theoſophiſts and
                chemiſts of that day, proceeded much farther in abſurdity, maintaining that every
                ſubſtance in nature lad either <hi rend="italic">external</hi> ſignatures
                immediately diſcernible, or <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> ſignatures, which, when
                brought into view by fire or menſtrua, denoted its connection with ſome fiderial or
                celestial archetype. Of the doctrine of signatures, as it relates merely to the
                therapeutic uſes of plants and minerals, traces are to be found in the works of ſome
                of the greateſt authors of antiquity ; but the celeſtial ſignatures, we believe,
                were diſcovered only by the moonlight of the moukiſh ages, Pliny informs us@@*, that
                the marble called <hi rend="italic">aphites,</hi> from its being ſpotted ike a
                ſerpent, was diſcovered by thoſe ſpots to be a sovereign remedy for the bite of that
                animal ; and that he colour of the <hi rend="italic">haematites</hi> or blood-ſtone
                intimated that it was fit to be employed to ſtop an hemorrhagy ; but we do not
                recollect his attributing the virtues of theſe minerals to a ſiderial or celeſtial
                influence.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Signature,</hi> a ſigning of a perſon’s name at the botom of an
                act or deed written by his own hand.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Signature,</hi> in printing, is a letter put at the bottom of
                the firſt page at leaſt, in each ſheet, as a direction to the binder in folding,
                gathering, and. collating, hem. The ſignatures conſiſt of the capital, letters of
                the alphabet, which change in every ſheet : if there be tore ſheets than letters in
                the alphabet, to the capital letter is added a ſmall one of the ſame sort, as A a, B
                b ; which are repeated as often as neceſſary. In large volumes it is eaſy to
                diſtinguiſh the number of alphabets, after the firſt three or four, by placing a
                figure before he literature, as 5 B, 6 B, &amp;c.</p>
