in natural hiſtory, a genus of foſſils, the characters of which are, that they are found in minute concretions; forming together a kind of powder, the genuine particles of which are all of a tendency to one determinate ſhape, and appear regular though more or leſs complete concretions; not to be diſſolved or diſunited by water, or formed into a coherent maſs by means of it, but retaining their figure in it; tranſparent, vitrifiable by extreme heat, and not diſſoluble in nor efferveſcing with acids. Sands are ſubject to be variouſly blended, both with homogene and heterogene ſubſtances, as that of talks, &amp;c. and hence, as well as from their various colours, are ſubdivided into, 1. White ſands, whether pure or mixed with other arenaceous or heterogeneous particles; of all which there are ſeveral ſpecies, differing no leſs in the fineneſs of their particles than in the different degrees of colour, from a bright and ſhining<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0651.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0645"/>
white, to a browniſh, yellowiſh, greeniſh, &amp;c. white. 2 The red and reddiſh ſands, both pure and impure. <hi rend="italic">3.</hi> The yellow ſands, whether pure or mixed, are alſo very numerous. 4. The brown ſands, diſtinguiſhed in the ſame manner. 5. The black ſands, whereof there are only two ſpecies, viz. a fine ſhining greyiſh-black fand, and another of a fine ſhining reddiſh-black colour. 6. The green kind; of which there is only one known ſpecies, viz. a coarſe variegated duſky green fand, common in Virginia.</p><p>Sand is of great uſe in the glaſs-manufacture; a white kind of fand being employed for making of the white glaſs, and a coarſe greeniſh-looking fand for the green glaſs.</p><p>In agriculture, it ſeems to be the office of ſand to make unctuous earths fertile, and fit to ſupport vegetables, &amp;c. For earth alone, we find, is liable to co- aleſce, and gather into a hard coherent maſs, as appears in clay; and being thus embodied, and as it were glued together, is no way diſpoſed to nouriſh vegetables. But if ſuch earth be mixed with fand, its pores are thereby kept open, and the earth itſelf looſe, ſo as thus to give room for the juices to aſcend, and for plants to be nouriſhed thereby. A vegetable planted only in fand, or in a fat glebe, or in earth, receives little growth or increaſe; but a mixture of both renders the maſs fertile. In effect, earth is in ſome meaſure made organical by means of fand; pores and ſpaces, ſomething analogous to veſſels, being thereby maintained, by which the juices may be conveyed, prepared, digeſted, circulated, and at length diſcharged. Common fand is, therefore, a very good addition, by way of manure, to all forts of clay-lands; it warms them, and makes them more open and looſe.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SAND-Bags,</hi> in the art of war.

Mr Bruce gives the following accurate deſcription of ſome that he ſaw in travelling thro’ that long and dreary deſert. “At one o’clock (ſays he) we alighted among ſome acacia-trees at Waadi el Halboub, having gone twenty-one miles. We were here at once ſurpriſed and terrified by a ſight furely one of the moſt magnificent in the world. In that vaſt expanſe of deſert from weft and to north-weſt of us, we ſaw a number of prodigious pillars of fand at different diſtances, at times moving with great celerity, at others ſtalking on with a majeſtic ſlowneſs: at intervals we thought they were coming in a few minutes to overwhelm us; and ſmall quantities of ſand did actually more than once reach us. Again they would retreat ſo as to be almoſt out of ſight, their tops reaching to the very clouds. There the tops often ſeparated from the bodies; and theſe, once disjoined, diſperſed in the air, and did not appear more. Sometimes they were broken near the middle, as if ſtruck with a large cannon ſhot. About noon they began to advance with conſiderable ſwiftneſs upon us, the wind being very ſtrong at north. Eleven of them ranged alongſide of us about the diſtance of three miles. The greateſt diameter of the largeſt appeared to me at that diſtance as if it would meaſure ten feet. They retired from us with a wind at ſouth-eaſt, leaving an impreſſion upon my mind to which I can give no name, though ſurely one ingredient in it was fear, with a conſiderable deal</p><p>of wonder and aſtoniſhment. It was in vain to think of flying, the ſwifteſt horſe or faſteſt ſailing ſhip could be of no uſe to carry us out of this danger; and the full perſuaſion of this rivetted me as if to the ſpot where I flood, and let the camels gain on me ſo much in my ſtate of lameneſs, that it was with ſome difficulty I could overtake them.</p><p>“The ſame appearance of moving pillars of ſand preſented themſelves to us this day in form and diſpoſition like thoſe we had ſeen at Waadi Halboub, only they ſeemed to be more in number and leſs in ſize. They came ſeveral times in a direction cloſe upon us, that is, I believe, within leſs than two miles. They began immediately after ſun-riſe, like a thick wood, and almoſt darkened the ſun: his rays ſhining through them for near an hour, gave them an appearance of pillars of fire, Our people now became deſperate: the Greek ſhrieked out, and ſaid it was the day of judgment. Iſmael pronounced it to be hell, and the Tucorories, that the world was on fire. I aſked Idris if ever he had before ſeen ſuch a ſight? He ſaid he had often ſeen them as terrible, though never worſe; but what he feared moſt was that extreme redneſs in the air, which was a ſure preſage of the coming of the ſimoom.” See <hi rend="smallcaps">Simoom.</hi></p><p>The flowing of ſand, though far from being ſo tremendous and hurtful as in Arabia, is of very bad conſequences in this country, as many valuable pieces of land have thus been entirely loſt; of which we give the following inſtances from Mr Pennant, together with a probable means of preventing them in future. “I have more; than once (ſays he), on the eaſtern coaſts of Scotland, obſerved the calamitous ſtate of ſeveral extenſive tracts, formerly in a moſt flouriſhing condition, at preſent covered with ſands, unſtable as thoſe of the deſerts of Arabia. The pariſh of Furvie, in the county of Aberdeen, is now reduced to two farms, and above L. 500 a-year loſt to the Errol family, as appears by the oath of the factor in 1600, made before the court of ſeſſion, to aſcertain the miniſter’s ſalary. Not a veſtige is to be ſeen of any buildings, unleſs a fragment of the church.</p><p>"The eſtate of Coubin, near Forres, is another melancholy inſtance. This tract was once worth L. 300 a-year, at this time overwhelmed with ſand. This ſtrange inundation was ſtill in motion in 1769, chiefly when a ſtrong wind prevailed. Its motion is ſo rapid, that I have been aſſured, that an apple-tree has been ſo covered with it in one ſeaſon, that only the very ſummit appeared. This diſtreſs was brought on about ninety years ago, and was occaſioned by the cutting down ſome trees, and pulling up the bent or ſtar which grew on the ſand-hills; which at laſt gave riſe to the act of 15 George II. c. 33. to prohibit the deſtruction of this uſeful plant.</p><p>“I beg leave to ſuggeſt to the public a poſſible means of putting a ſtop to theſe deſtructive ravages. Providence hath kindly formed this plant to grow only in pure fand. Mankind was left to make, in after-times, an application of it ſuitable to their wants. The ſand- hills, on a portion of the Flintſhire ſhores, in the pariſh of Llanaſa, are covered with it naturally, and kept firm in their place. The Dutch perhaps owe the exiſtence of part at leaſt of their country to the ſowing of it on the <hi rend="italic">mobile ſolum,</hi> their ſand-banks.</p><p>"My humane and amiable friend, the late Benjamin<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0652.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0646"/>
Stillingfleet, Eſq; recommended the ſowing of this plant on the ſandy wilds of Norfolk, that its matted roots might prevent the deluges of fand which that country experiences. It has been already remarked, that whereſoever this plant grows the ſalutary effects are ſoon obſerved to follow. A ſingle plant will fix the fand, and gather it into a hillock; theſe hillocks, by the increaſe of vegetation, are formed into larger, till by degrees a barrier is made often againſt the encroachments of the ſea; and might as often prove preventative of the calamity in queſtion. I cannot, therefore, but recommend the trial to the inhabitants of many parts of North Britain. The plant grows in moſt places near the ſea, and is known to the Highlanders by the name of <hi rend="italic">murah;</hi> to the Engliſh by that of <hi rend="italic">bent- ſtar, mat-gra</hi> ſ <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">marram.</hi> Linnaeus calls it <hi rend="italic">arundo arenaria.</hi> The Dutch call it <hi rend="italic">helm.</hi> This plant hath ſtiff and ſharp-pointed leaves, growing like a ruſh, a foot and a half long: the roots both creep and penetrate deeply into their ſandy beds: the ſtalk bears an ear five or six inches long, not unlike rye; the ſeeds are ſmall, brown, and roundiſh. By good fortune, as old Gerard obſerves, no cattle will eat or touch this vegetable, allotted for other purpoſes, ſubſervient to the uſe of mankind.”</p><p><hi rend="italic">SAND-Piper,</hi> in ornithology. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Tringa.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">SAND-Stοne,</hi> a genus of ſtones belonging to the order of ſaxa; and including all thoſe which conſiſt of ſuch minute particles that they cannot eaſily be diſcerned by the eye. The ſpecies enumerated by Cronſtedt are,</p><p>1. Thoſe cemented by a clay, of which there are two varieties; one with porcelain clay, the other with common clay. The former is met with in Sweden under the ſtratum of coal in a coal-mine in the province of Shone, and is very hard and refractory in the fire; the other is found in the iſland of Gothland.</p><p>2. With lime, reſembling mortar made with coarſe ſand. There are two varieties, one conſiſting of tranſparent grey-coloured grains of quartz and white lime- ſtone, the other of a looſe texture, hardening in the air; but having the particles too fine to be viſible. The former of theſe is found in Sweden, the latter in France and Livonia.</p><p>3. Sand-ſtone having its particles bound together by an unknown cement. Of this there are four varieties; 1. Looſe; 2. Somewhat hard; 3. Compact; 4. Very hard; all of them found in different parts of Sweden.</p><p>4. Cemented by ruſt of iron, found in the form of looſe ſtones in ſeveral places.</p><p>Cronſtedt informs us that the greateſt part of ſand- ſtones conſiſt of quartz and mica, being thoſe ſubſtances which moſt readily admit of granulation without being reduced to powder. Some years ago the Baron de Dietrich ſhowed a ſingular variety of ſand-ſtone at Paris. It conſiſts of ſmall grains of hard quartz which ſtrike fire with ſteel united with ſome micaceous particles. It is flexible and elaſtic, the flexibility depending on the micaceous part and ſoftneſs of the gluten with which the particles are cemented. This elaſtic ſtone is ſaid to have been found at Brazil, and brought to Germany by his excellency the marquis de Lavradio. There are alſo two tables of white marble, kept in the palace of Borgheſe at Rome, which have the ſame property But the ſparry particles of their ſubſtance, though tranſparent, are rather ſoft, and may be eaſily ſeparated by the nail. They efferveſce with aquafortis, and there is alſo a ſmall mixture of minute particles of talk or mica.</p><p>Sand-ſtones are of great uſe in buildings which are required to reſiſt air, water, and fire Some of them are ſoft in the quarry, but become hard when expoſed to the air. The looſe ones are moſt uſeful, but the ſolid and hard ones crack in the fire, and take a poliſh when uſed as grindſtones. Stones of this kind ought therefore to be nicely examined before they are employed for the uſual purpoſes. Our author obſerves that the working maſons, or ſtone-cutters, ought to wear a piece of frize or baize before their mouths, to preſerve themſelves from a conſumption which their buſineſs is otherwiſe apt to bring on. Limeſtone, however, is not obſerved to have this effect.</p><p>To the lift of ſand-ſtones Fabroni adds gritſtone, of greater or leſs hardneſs; moſtly of a grey, and ſometimes of a yellowiſh colour, compoſed of a ſiliceous and micaceous fand, but rarely of a ſparry kind, with greater or leſſer particles cloſely connected with an argillaceous cement. It ſtrikes fire with ſteel, vitrifies in a ſtrong fire, and is generally indiſſoluble in acids. It is uſed for mill-ſtones, whet-ſtones, and ſometimes for filtering ſtones, as well as for building.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
