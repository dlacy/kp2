And on that au-thority, which by his miracles he proved to be divine, he declared to his followers, that there is to be a gene-ral reſurection both of the juſt and of the unjuſt, in-ſtructing his difciples to propagate this doctrine through all nations ; St Paul confeſſing, that if there be no refur-rection of the dead, preaching is vain, and our faith is vain.</p><p>As to the order of fucceſſion in which the dead are to be raiſed, the Scriptures are almoſt filent. St Paul fays, that every man is to riſe in his own order, and that the dead in Chriſt are to riſe firſt: and St John ob-ſerved in his viſion, that the fouls of them which were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhipped the beaſt, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hapds, lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years ; but the reſt of the dead lived not again until the thouſand years (γ) were finiſhed.</p><p>A queſtion that has much oftener agitated the minds of men is, with what fort of bodies are the dead to be raifed ? St Paul has anſwered, with incorruptible and immortal bodies (z). And to ſilence the diſputatious caviller of his day, he illuſtrated his doctrine by the growth of grain. " Thou fool (ſaid he), that which thou ſoweſt, thou ſoweſt not that body that ſhall be, but bare grain, it may chance of wheat or of ſome other grain.” To us it appears very ſurpriſing, that any one who reads this paſſage with the ſlighteſt attention, ſhould perplex himſelf, or diſturb the church with idle attempts to prove the identity of the bodies with which we ſhall die and riſe again at the laſt day. The apoſtle expreſsly affirms, that " fleſh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; that we ſhall all be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the laſt trump ; that there are celeſtial bodies and bodies terreſtrial ; and that the glory of the celeſtial is one, and the glory of the terreſtrial another,”</p><p>'Γhat this implies a total change of qualities, will admit of no diſpute ; but ſtill it has been conſidered as an article of the Chriſtian faith, that we ate to rife with the ſame bodies in reſpect of ſubſtance. what is meant by the identity of ſubſtance, with qualities wholly different, it is not very eaſy to conceive. Perhaps the meaning may be, that our incorruptible bodies ſhall conſiſt oſ the ſame material particles with our mortal bodies, though theſe particles will be differently arranged to produce the different qualities. But as the particles of our preſent bodies are conſtantly changing, and as different particles compoſe the body atdiffeιent times, a queſtion has been put, with what ſet of particles ſhall we riſe? Here a ſingular variety of opinions have been held. Some * contend, that we ſhall riſe with the original ſtamina of our bodies derived from our parents ; ſome are for riſing with that ſet of particles which they had at birth ; ſome with the ſet which they are to have at death ; and ſome with the particles which remain after maceration in water')-; though, God knows, that if this maceration be continued long, theſe may ariſe with few or no particles at all. Another query has given much alarm, what if any of theſe particles ſhould enter a vegetable, compoſe its fruit, and be eaten by a man, woman, or a child ? WÎ11 not a diſpute, ſimilar to that apprehended by the Sadducees about the wife of the ſeven brothers, neceffarily follow, whoſe particles are they to be at the reſurrection ? Againſt this confuſion, they truſt that the goodnefs and wiſdom of heaven will take all the proper and neceffary meaſures ; and they even venture to point out a way in which that may be done. A foot deep of earth, they obſerve, in two or three of the counties of England, ſuppoſing each perſon to weigh on an average about ſeven ſtones and a few pounds, would amply ſupply with material bodies 600,000,000 oſ fouls for no leſs a ſpace than 2 3,000 years § ; and therefore there ſeems to be no neceffity ſor the vamping up of their old materials to lodge and accommodate new fouls.</p><p>But, unluckily here, the queſtion is not about the poſſibility of keeping the particles of different bodies ſeparate and diſtinct. The queſtion is rather, what have the Scriptures determined on the ſubject ? Now the Scriptures ſay, that the ſpirit returns unto God who gave it. And ſhould it be aſked, in what place does he reſerve it till the reſurrection ? the Scriptures reply, in the place of the dead ; becaufe the foul deſcends into the pit, is redeemed from the grave ; and the ſting of death, the laſt enemy that is to be deſtroyed, ſhall be taken away when the trumpet of God ſhall found : at which time the dead that ſleep in their graves ihall awake, ſhall hear the voice, and ſhall come forth. There is not here ſo much as a word concerning the body ; and therefore it was aſked with what bodies are the dead to be raiſed ? To which it was anſwered, the vile body is to be changed. The body which is, is not the body which ſhall be ; for the incorruptible muſt put on incorruption, and that which is mortal, put on immortality.</p><p>This curious diſcovery of the ſentiments of Scripture we owe to a lay-man, the celebrated Locke ; who, in one of his controversies with the biſhop of worceſter, came to underſtand what he knew not before, namely, that nowhere have the Scriptures fpoken of the reſurrection oi the ſame body in the ſenſe in which it is uſu-ally conceived. The reſurrection of the ſame perſon is indeed promifed ; and how that promiſe maybe fπlfill-ed, notwithſtanding the conſtant change of the particles of the body, has been ſhown in another place. See Metaphysics, Part III. Chap. iii.</p><p>The advocatcs, therefore, for the refurrection of the mortal body, have again been obliged to betake them-ſelves to the lhifts of reaſoning. It is proper, ſay they,</p><p>(γ) Theſe thouſand years formed the happy millenium ſo often mentioned in the ancient fathers ; and the learned Burnet, in his Theory ot the Earth, has endeavoured to prove, that a ſimilar notion prevailed among the Jews. See Millenium.</p><p>(z) our Saviour rofe with the ſame body, both as to ſubſtance and qualities ; becauſe it was nefceſſary that his perfon ſhould be known and identified after his reſurrection.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
