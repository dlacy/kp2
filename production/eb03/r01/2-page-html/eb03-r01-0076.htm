<p><span class="font0">th⅛ m¾n had not the courage of Luther ∣ and was therefore on all occaſions ready to make conceſſions,&nbsp;and to propoſe ſchemes of accommodation. In the&nbsp;preſent caſe, therefore, he gave it as his opinion, that&nbsp;the whole of the book called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Interim</span><span class="font0"> could not by any&nbsp;means be adopted by the Proteſtants; but at ſame&nbsp;time he declared, that, he ſaw no reaſon why this book&nbsp;might not be appproved, adopted, and received, as an&nbsp;authoritative rule in things that did not relate to the&nbsp;ciſential parts of religion, and which he accounted&nbsp;indifferent. But this ſcheme, inſtead of cementing&nbsp;tlie differences, made them much worſe than ever ; and&nbsp;produced a divjſion among the Proteſtants themſelves,&nbsp;which might have overthrown the Reformation en-tirely, if the emperor and pope had ſeized the oppoι⅛&nbsp;tunity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the year 1549, the pope (Paul ∏I.) died; and w<sup>,</sup>as ſucceeded by Julius III. who, at the repeated fo-licitations of the emperor, conſented to the re-aſſem-bling oſ a council at Trent. A diet was again held at&nbsp;Augſhurg under the cannon of an imperial army, and&nbsp;Charles laid the matter. before the princes of the em*=&nbsp;pire. Moſt of theſe preſent gave their conſent to it,&nbsp;and among the reſt Maurice elector of Saxony $ who&nbsp;conſented on the following conditions ; 1, That the&nbsp;points of doctrine which had already been decided&nbsp;there, ſhould be re-examined. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2. </span><span class="font0">That this eχami-nation ſhould be made in preſence of the Proteſtant&nbsp;divines. 3. That the Saxon Proteſtants ſhould have a&nbsp;liberty of voting as well as of deliberating in the&nbsp;council. 4. That the pope ſhouid not pretend to pre-fide in that aſſembly, either in perfon or by his legates.&nbsp;This declaration of Maurice was read in the diet, and&nbsp;his deputies inſiſted upon its being entered into the regiſters which the archbiſhop of Mentz obſtinately re-fuſed. The diet was concluded in the year 1551 ;&nbsp;and, at its breaking up, the emperor deſired the aſſembled princes and ſtates to prepare all things for&nbsp;the approaching council, and promifed to uſe his ut-moſt endeavours to procure moderation and harmony,&nbsp;impartiality and charity, in the tranſactions of that aſ-fembly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Οη the breaking up of the diet, the Proteſtants took fuch ſteps as they thought moſt proper for their own&nbsp;ſafety. The Saxons employed Melancthon, and the&nbsp;wurtembergers Brengius, to draw up Confeſſions of&nbsp;Faith to be laid before the new council. The Saxon di-vines, however, proceeded no farther than Nuremberg,&nbsp;having received ſecret orders from Maurice to ſtop&nbsp;there : For the elector, perceiving that Charles had&nbsp;formed deſigns againſt the liberties of the German&nbsp;princes, reſolved to take the moſt effectual meaſures for&nbsp;cruſhing his ambition at once. He therefore entered&nbsp;with the utmQſt fecrecy and expedition into an alliance&nbsp;with the king of France, and ſeveral of the German&nbsp;princes, for the ſecurity of the rights and liberties of&nbsp;the empire ; after which, aſſembling a powerful army&nbsp;in 1552, he marched againſt the emperor, who lay with&nbsp;a handful of troops at Inſpruck, and expected no ſuch&nbsp;thing. By thi3 ſudden and unforeſeen accident Charles&nbsp;was ſo much diſpirited, that he was willing to make&nbsp;peace almoſt on any terms, The conſequence </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ef </span><span class="font0">this&nbsp;was, that he concluded a treaty at Paſſau, which by&nbsp;the Proteſtants is conſidered as the bafis of their religi-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">«us </span><span class="font0">liberty. By the firſt three </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">articles </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">this treaty it</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">was agreed, that Maurice and the eon⅛4βFStfs ſh¢ſtd lay down their arms, and lend their troops to Ferdinand&nbsp;to aſſiſt him againſt the Turks ↑ and that the landgrave&nbsp;of Heſſe ſhould be ſet at liberty. By the fourth it&nbsp;was agreed, that the Rule of Faith called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Interim&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſhould be confidered as null and void ; that </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font0">contending parties ſhould enjoy the free and undiſturixd&nbsp;exerciſe of their religion, until a diet ſhould be aſſetrw&nbsp;bled to determine amicably the prefent diſputes (which&nbsp;diet was to meet in the ſpace of ſix months) ; and. that&nbsp;this religious liberty ſhould continue always, in caſe it&nbsp;ſhould be found impoſſible to come to an uniformity in&nbsp;doctrine and worſhip. It was alſo determined, that all&nbsp;thoſe who had ſuffered baniſhment, or any other eala∙*&nbsp;mity, on account of their having been concerned in the&nbsp;league or war of Smalca!d&gt; ſhould. be iesnſtated in their&nbsp;privileges, poſieſſions, and employments ; that the im«&nbsp;pedal chamber at Spire ſhould be open to the. Prate·&nbsp;Hants as well as to the Catholics 5 and that there ſhould&nbsp;always be a certain number of Lutherans in that high&nbsp;court.-—To this peace Albert, marquis of Branden-burg, refufed to ſubfcribe ; and continued the war&nbsp;agamſt the Roman-catholics, committing ſuch ravagea&nbsp;in the empire, that a confederacy was at laſt formed&nbsp;again ſt him, At the head of this confederacy was&nbsp;Maurice elector of Saxony, who died of a wound he&nbsp;received in a battle fought on the occaſion in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">155 3,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The affembling </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">the diet promiſed by Charles was prevented by various incidents ; however it met at&nbsp;Augſhurg in 1555, where it was opened by Ferdinand in name of the emperor, and terminated thoſe&nbsp;deplorable calamities which had ſh long deſolated the&nbsp;empire» After various debates, the following acts were&nbsp;paffed, on the 25th of September t That the Prote-ſtants who followed the Confeſſion of Augſhurg ſhould&nbsp;be for the future conſidered as entirely free from the ju∙&nbsp;riſdiction of the Roman pontiff, and from the authority&nbsp;and fuperintendance of the biſhops 5 that they were left&nbsp;at perfect liberty to enact laws for themſelves relating&nbsp;to their religious ſentiments, diſcipline, and worſhip j&nbsp;that all the inhabitants oſ the German empire ſhould be&nbsp;allowed to judge for themſelves in religious matteι⅜&nbsp;and to join themſelves to that church whole doctrine&nbsp;and worſhip they thought the moſt pure and ¢onfimant&nbsp;to the ſpirit of true Chriſtianity 5 and that all thoſe&nbsp;who ſhould injure or perſecute any perfon under reli»&nbsp;gious pretences, and on account of their opinions,&nbsp;ſhould be declared and proceeded againſt as public enemies oſ the empire, invaders of its liberty, and diſturbers&nbsp;of its peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus was the Reformation eſtabliſhed in many parts of the German empire, where it continues to this day j&nbsp;nor have the efforts of the Popiſh powers at any time&nbsp;been able to fupprefs it, or even to prevent it from&nbsp;gaining ground. It was not, however, in Germany&nbsp;alone that a reformation of religion took place, Ak&nbsp;moſt all the kingdoms of Europe began t© open their&nbsp;eyes to the truth about the ſame time. The reformed&nbsp;religion was propagated in Sweden, ſoon after </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Lu-</span><span class="font0">ther’s rupture with the church of Rome, by onc </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">his diſciples named </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Olaus Petri,</span><span class="font0"> The zealous efforts&nbsp;of this miſſionary were feconded by Guſtavws </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Vafi⅛&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">whom the Swedes had raifed to the throne in place of&nbsp;Chriſtiern king of Denmark, whoſe horrid barbarity&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">loſt him the crown.
