<p><span class="font2">by the invasion of the Hungarians, took refuge at Remiremont<sub>f </sub>which had grown up round a villa of the Frankish kings, and in&nbsp;the nth century they permanently settled there. Enriched&nbsp;by dukes of Lorraine, kings of France and emperors of Germany,&nbsp;the ladies of Remiremont attained great power. The abbess was&nbsp;a princess of the empire, and received consecration at the hands&nbsp;of the pope. The fifty canonesses were selected from those&nbsp;who could give proof of noble descent. On Whit-Monday the&nbsp;neighbouring parishes paid homage to the chapter in a ceremony&nbsp;called the “ Kyrioles and on their accession lhe dukes of&nbsp;Lorraine, the immediate suzerains of the abbey, had to come to&nbsp;Remiremont to swear to continue their protection. The “ War&nbsp;of the Scutcjieons ” (Panonceaux) in 1566 between the duke and&nbsp;the abbess ended in favour of the duke; and the abbess never&nbsp;recovered her former position. In the 17th century the ladies&nbsp;of Remiremont fell away so much from the original monastic&nbsp;rule as to take the title of countesses, renounce their vows and&nbsp;marry. The town was attacked by the French in 1638 and&nbsp;ruined by the earthquake of 1682. With the rest of Lorraine&nbsp;it was joined to France in 1766. The monastery on the hill&nbsp;and the nunnery in the town were both suppressed in the&nbsp;Revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REMONSTRANTS, the name given to those Dutch Protestants who, after the death of Arminius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> maintained the views&nbsp;associated with his name, and in 1610 presented to the states of&nbsp;Holland and Friesland a “ remonstrance ” in five articles&nbsp;formulating their points of departure from stricter Calvinism.&nbsp;These were: (1) that the divine decree of predestination is&nbsp;conditional, not absolute; (2) that the Atonement is in intention&nbsp;universal; (3) that man cannot of himself exercise a saving&nbsp;faith; (4) that though the grace of God is a necessary condition&nbsp;of human effort it does not act irresistibly in man; (5) that&nbsp;believers are able to resist sin but are not beyond the possibility&nbsp;of falling from grace. Their adversaries (the Gomarists) met&nbsp;them with a “ counter-remonstrance,” and so were known as the&nbsp;Counter-Remonstrants. Although the states-general issued an&nbsp;edict tolerating both parties and forbidding further dispute, the&nbsp;conflict continued, and the Remonstrants were assailed both&nbsp;by personal enemies and by the political weapons of Maurice&nbsp;of Orange, who executed and imprisoned their leaders for holding&nbsp;republican views. In 1618-19 the synod of Dort (see Dort,&nbsp;Synod of), the thirteen Arminian pastors headed by Simon&nbsp;Episcopius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> being shut out, established the victory of the&nbsp;Calvinist school, drew up ninety-three canonical rules, and&nbsp;confirmed the authority of the Belgic Confession and the&nbsp;Heidelberg Catechism. The judgment of the synod was enforced&nbsp;by the deposition and in some cases the banishment of Remonstrant ministers; but the government soon became convinced&nbsp;that their party was not dangerous to the state, and in 1630 they&nbsp;were formally allowed liberty to reside in all parts of Holland&nbsp;and build churches and schools. In 1621 they had already&nbsp;received liberty to make a settlement in Schleswig, where they&nbsp;built the town of Friedrichstadt. This colony still exists. The&nbsp;doctrine of the Remonstrants was embodied in 1621 in a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Confessio&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">written by Episcopius<sub>f</sub> their great theologian, while J. Uyten-bogaert gave them a catechism and regulated their churchly&nbsp;order. The Remonstrants adopted a simple synodical constitution; but their importance was henceforth more theological&nbsp;than ecclesiastical. Their seminary in Amsterdam has boasted&nbsp;of many distinguished names—Curcellaeus, Limborch, Wetstein,&nbsp;Lc Clerc; and their liberal school of theology, which naturally&nbsp;grew more liberal and even rationalistic, reacted powerfully&nbsp;on the state church and on other Christian denominations.&nbsp;The Remonstrants first received official recognition in 1795. As&nbsp;a church they now number 27 communities with about 12,500&nbsp;members, in a flourishing condition and respected for their&nbsp;traditions of scholarship and liberal thought. Their chief'&nbsp;congregation is in Rotterdam.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RÉMUSAT, CHARLES FRANÇOIS MARIE, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Comte de</span><span class="font2"> (1797-1875), French politician and man of letters, was born in Paris on the 13th of March 1797. His father, Auguste Laurent,&nbsp;Comte de Remusat, of a good family of Toulouse, was chamber-lain to Napoleon, but acquiesced in the restoration and became&nbsp;prefect first of Haute Garonne, and then of Nord. His mother’s&nbsp;maiden name was Claire Élisabeth Jeanne Gravier de Vergennes, born in 1780. She married at sixteen, and was attached&nbsp;to Josephine as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dame du palais</span><span class="font2"> in 1802. Talleyrand was among&nbsp;her admirers, and she was generally recognized as a woman of&nbsp;great intellectual capacity and personal grace. After her&nbsp;death (1824) an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essai sur Fêducation des femmes</span><span class="font2"> was published&nbsp;and received an academic </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">couronne.</span><span class="font2"> But it was not until her&nbsp;grandson Paul de Rémusat published her </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires</span><span class="font2"> (3 vols.,&nbsp;Paris, 1879-80), which have since been followed by some correspondence with her son (2 vols., 1881), that justice could be&nbsp;done to her literary talent. Much light was thrown on the&nbsp;Napoleonic court by this book, and on the youth and education&nbsp;of her son Charles. He early developed political views more&nbsp;liberal than those of his parents, and, being bred to the bar,&nbsp;published in 1820 a pamphlet on trial by jury. He was an&nbsp;active journalist, showing in philosophy and literature the&nbsp;influence of Cousin, and is said to have furnished to no small&nbsp;extent the original of Balzac’s brilliant egoist Henri de Marsay,&nbsp;He signed the journalists’ protest against the Ordinances of&nbsp;July 1830, and in the following October was elected deputy&nbsp;.for Haute Garonne. He then ranked himself with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">doctrinaires,</span><span class="font2"> and supportéd most of those measures of restriction on&nbsp;popular liberty which made the July monarchy unpopular with&nbsp;French Radicals. In 1836 he became for a short time undersecretary of state for the interior. He then became an ally of&nbsp;Thiers, and in 1840 held the ministry of the interior for a brief&nbsp;period. In the same year he became an Academician. For&nbsp;the rest of Louis Philippe’s reign he was in opposition till he&nbsp;joined Thiers in his attempt at a ministry in the spring of 1848.&nbsp;During this time Rémusat constantly spoke in the chamber,&nbsp;but was still more active in literature, especially on philosophical&nbsp;subjects, the most remarkable of his works being his book on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Abelard</span><span class="font2"> (2 vols., 1845). In 1848 he was elected, and in 1849&nbsp;re-elected, for Haute Garonne, and voted with the Conservative&nbsp;side. He had to leave France after the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coup Petal*,</span><span class="font2"> nor did he&nbsp;re-enter political life during the Second Empire until 1869, when&nbsp;he founded a moderate opposition journal at Toulouse. In 1871&nbsp;he refused the Vienna embassy offered him by Thiers, but in&nbsp;August he was appointed minister of foreign affairs in succession&nbsp;to M. Jules Favre. Although minister he was not a deputy, and&nbsp;on standing for Paris in September 1873 he was beaten by Désiré&nbsp;Barodet. A month later he was elected (having already&nbsp;resigned with Thiers) for Haute Garonne by a great majority.&nbsp;He died in Paris on the 6th of January 1875.</span></p>
