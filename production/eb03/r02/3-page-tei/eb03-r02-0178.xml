They were likewiſe to keep the ſeas clear of pirates, to convoy the veſſels which brought to Rome the annual tributes ſrom the provinces beyond ſea, and to tranſport corn and other proviſions neceſſary for the relief and ſeibſiſtence of the city. As to the civil government, Auguſtus enacted ſeveral new laws, and reformed ſome of the old ones : however, he affected to do nothing without the advice of the ſenate ; who were ſo well pleaſed with the complaiſance ſhowed them on all oc-caſtons, that to the reſt of his titles they added that of <hi rend="italic">Pater Patrice,</hi>  or “ Father of his Country.”</p><p>And now Auguſtus having ſettled all things with regard to the civil and military eſtabliſhments. of the empire, turned his arms againſt the Spaniſh nations called the <hi rend="italic">Cantabrians</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Aſturians,</hi>  who had never been fully ſubdued. The war, however, terminated as uſual, in ſavour of the Romans ; and theſe brave nations were forced to receive the yoke, though not without the moſt violent reſiſtance on their part, and the utmoſt difficulty on that of the Romans (SeeAsturia). By this and his other conqueſts the name of <hi rend="italic">A</hi>  uguſtus became ſo celebrated, that his friendſhip was courted by the moſt diſtant monarchs. Phrahates king of Parthia conſented to a treaty with him upon his own terms, and gave him four of his own ſons with theſe wives and children as hoſtages for the performance of the articles ; and as a ſurther inſtance of his reſpect, he delivered up the Roman eagles and other enſigns which had been taken from Craflus at the battle of Carrhæ. He received alſo an embaſſy from the king of India, with a letter written in the Greek tongue, in which the Indian monarch informed him, that “ though he reigned over 6oc kings, he had ſo great a value for the friendſhip of A uguſtus, that he had ſent this embaſſy on ſo long a journey on purpoſe to deſire it of him ; that he was ready to meet him at whatſoever place he pleaſed to appoint ; and that, upon the firſt notice, he was ready to afliſt him in whatever was right.” This letter he ſubſeribed by the name of <hi rend="italic">Poms king of India.</hi>  Of the ambaſſadors who ſet out from India, three only reached the preſence of Auguſtus, who was at that time in the iſland of Samos, the others dying by the way, Of the three ſiirvivors one was names <hi rend="italic">Zarτnar,</hi>  a gymnoſophſſi, who followed the emperor to Athens, and there burnt himſelf in his preſence ; it being cuftemary for the gymnoſophifts to put an end to their lives in this manner, when they thought they had lived long enough, or apprehended ſome misfortune. Soon alter this the Roman dominions were extended ſouthward over the Garamantes, a people whoſe country reached as far as the river Niger. All this time the emperor continued to make new regulations for the good of the ſtate ; and among other things cauſed the Sibylline oracles to be reviewed. Many of theſe he rejected ; but ſuch as were reckoned authentic, he cauſed to be copied by the pontifices themſelves, and lodged them in golden cabinets, which he placed in the temple of Apollo, built by him in his palace.</p><p>The Roman empire had now extAded itſelf ſo far, that it ſeemed to have arrived at the limits preſcribed to it by nature ; and as ſoon as this was the caſe, it began to be attacked by thoſe nations which in proceſs of time were to overthrow it. The Germans, by which name the Romans confounded a great number of nations dwelling in the northern parts of Europe, began to make incurſions into Gaul. Their firſl attempt happened in the year 17 B. C. when they at firſl gained an inconfιderable advantage, but were ſoon driven back with great loſs. Soon after this the Rhae-ti, who ſeem to have inhabited the country bordering on the lake of Confiance, invaded Italy, where they committed dreadful devaſtations, putting all the males to the ſw ord without diſtinction of rank or age ; nay, we are told, that, when women with child happened to fall into their hands, they conſulted their augurs whether the child was male or female ; and if they pronounced it a male, the mother was immediately maſſacred. Againſt theſe barbarians Auguftιιs ſent Druſus the ſecond ſon of the empreſs Livia ; who, though very young, found means to gain a complete victory with very little loſs on his part. Thoſe who eſeaped took the road to Gaul, being joined by the Vindelici, another nation in the neighbourhood ; but Tiberius, the elder brother of Druſus, marched againſt them, and overthrew them ſo completely, that the Rhse-ti, Vindelici, and Norici, three of the moſt barbarous nations in thoſe parts, were fain to ſubmit to the pleaſure of the emperor. To keep their country in awe, Tiberius planted tw<hi rend="sup">,</hi>o colonies in Vindelicia, opening a road from thence into Noricum and Rhsetia. One of the cities which he built for the defence of his colonies was called<hi rend="italic">Dryfomagus ;</hi>  the other, <hi rend="italic">Auguſta Pindelico-rum ;</hi>  both of which are now known by the names of <hi rend="italic">Niminghen</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Augjburg.</hi></p><p>Auguſtus, who had long ſince obtained all the temporal honours which could well be conferred upon him, now began to aſſume thoſe of the ſpiritual kind alſo ; being in the year 13 B. C. created Pontifex Maximus : an office which he continued to hold till his death ; as did alſo his ſucceſſors till the time of The-odofius. By virtue of this office he corrected a very groſs miſſake in the Roman kalendar ; for the pontifices having, for the ſpace of 36 years, that is, ever ſince the reformation by Julius Caeſar, made every third year a leap year, inſtead of every fourth, twelve days had been inſerted inſtead of nine, ſo that the Roman year conſiſted of three days more than it ought to have done. Theſe three ſuperfluous days having been thrown out, the form of the year has“ ever ſince been regularly obſerved, and is ſtill known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">old ſtyle</hi>  in uſe among us. On this occaſion he gave his own name to the month of Auguſt, as Julius Cæſar had formerly done to the month of July.</p><p>In the year 11 B. C. Agrippa died, and was ſucceeded in his high employment of governor of Rome by Tiberius ; but, before inveſting him with this ample power, the emperor cauſed him to divorce his wife A-grippina (who had already brought him a ſon, and w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>as then big with child), in order to marry Julia the widow of Agrippa and daughter of the emperor. Julia was a princeſs of an infamous character, as was known to almoſt every body excepting Auguſtus himſelf; however, Tiberius made no heſitation, through ſear of disobliging the emperor.</p><p>The emperor now ſent his two ſons Tiberius and Druſus againſt the northern nations.
