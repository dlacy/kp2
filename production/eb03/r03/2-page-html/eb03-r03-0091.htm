<p><span class="font0">gaged </span><span class="font1">upwards </span><span class="font0">of 300 German artiſts, who were directed to repair to Lubec, in order to proceed from thence to Livonia, But the Lubeckers, who were&nbsp;very powerful at that time, and aimed at nothing leſs&nbsp;than the engroſſing of the whole commerce of the&nbsp;north, ſtopped them, and repreſented ſtrongly to the&nbsp;emperor, in the name of all the merchants in Livonia,&nbsp;the dangerous conſequence oſ thus affording inſtructions&nbsp;to the Ruſſians, who would ſoon avail themſelves of it&nbsp;to ruin their trade, and diſtreſs the ſubjects of his imperial majeſty. The workmen and others intended for&nbsp;Ruſſia were eaſily prevailed upon to return to their re-ſpective homes; and the czar’s ambaſſador was arreſted&nbsp;upon his arrival at Lubec, and impriſoned there at the&nbsp;fuit of the Livonians : however, he made his eſcape&nbsp;ſhortly after ; and the czar, though provoked to the&nbsp;laſt degree at the behaviour of the Lubeckers, was obliged for ſome time to ſuſpend his reſentment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The firſt enterpriſe oſ Baſilovitz now was againſt the Tartars of Caſan, who had hitherto been ſuch formidable enemies. In this he was attended with great&nbsp;ſucceſs ; the whole territory was conquered in ſeven&nbsp;years ; but the capital, named alſo </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caſan,</span><span class="font0"> being well&nbsp;fortified and bravely defended, made ſuch reſiſtance as&nbsp;quite diſheartened the beſiegers, and made them think&nbsp;of abandoning their enterpriſe.<sup>i</sup> Baſilovitz being informed of this, haſtened to them with a conſiderable&nbsp;reinforcement, endeavoured to revive their drooping&nbsp;courage, and exhorted them to puſh the ſiege with&nbsp;redoubled vigour. However, the greater part, deaf&nbsp;to all his remonſtrances, after loudly inſiſting upon a&nbsp;peace with the Tartars, and leave to return home,&nbsp;proceeded to mutiny, and fell upon their comrades who&nbsp;were for continuing the war. Baſilovitz, alarmed at&nbsp;this event, ruſhed in among the combatants, and with&nbsp;great difficulty parted them : but neither menaces nor&nbsp;intreaties, nor even a promiſe of giving them the&nbsp;whole plunder of the city if they took it, could prevail&nbsp;on them to continue the war. Their rage at laſt&nbsp;prompted them to threaten the life of their ſovereign ;&nbsp;who, to provide for his own ſafety, was obliged to&nbsp;make the beſt of his way to Moſcow ; and the mutineers, no longer regarding any command, inſtantly returned thither.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Baſilovitz, though juſtly incenſed at this inſolence, took a method of puniſhing it which does honour to&nbsp;his humanity. Having ſelected a guard of 2c00 of&nbsp;his beſt troops, he ordered a great feaſt, to which he&nbsp;invited his principal nobles and officers, to each of&nbsp;whom, according to the Ruffian cuſtom, he gave very&nbsp;rich garments. The chief of the ſeditious were clothed in black velvet ; and after the dinner was over,&nbsp;he made a ſpeech to the whole company, ſetting forth&nbsp;the behaviour of his troops before Caſan, their contempt of his commands, and their conſpiracy to take&nbsp;away his life : to which he added, that he was doubly&nbsp;ſorry to find the inſtigators of ſuch wickedneſs among&nbsp;thoſe who were ſtyled, and who ought to be, his faithful counſellors ; and that thoſe who knew themſelves&nbsp;to be guilty of ſuch atrocious wickedneſs could not&nbsp;do better than voluntarily to ſubmit themſelves to his&nbsp;mercy. Upon this, moſt of them immediately threw&nbsp;themſelves at his ſeet, and implored his pardon. Some&nbsp;-of the moſt criminal were executed, but the reſt were&nbsp;only impriſoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Immediately after this puniſhmeut of the rebels, Baſilovitz inarched with a freſh army to re-inveſt Ca*&nbsp;ſan before the Tartars had time to recover themſelves.&nbsp;The beſieged ſtill made an obſtinate defence, and the&nbsp;Ruſſians again began to be cliſpirited ; upon which the&nbsp;czar ordered his pioneers to undermine the walls of&nbsp;the citadel, a practice then quite unknown to the Tartars. This work being completed, he directed his&nbsp;prieſts to read a ſolemn maſs to the whole army, at&nbsp;the head of which he afterwards ſpent ſome time in&nbsp;private prayer, and then ordered fire to be ſet to the&nbsp;powder, which acted ſo effectually, that great part of&nbsp;the foundation was immediately blown up, and the&nbsp;Muſcovites ruſhing into the city, ſlaughtered all before them ; while the aſtoniſhed Tartars, crowding&nbsp;out at the oppoſite gate, croſſed the river Caſanka, and&nbsp;fled into the. foreſts. Among the priſoners taken on&nbsp;this occaſion were Simeon king of Caſan with his queen;&nbsp;both of whom were ſent to Moſcow, where they were&nbsp;treated with the utmoſt civility and reſpect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Encouraged by this ſucceſs, Baſilovitz invaded the country of Aſtracan, the capital of which he ſoon reduced ; after which he prepared to revenge himſelf on&nbsp;the Livonians for their behaviour in flopping the German artiſts. John Baſilovitz I. had concluded a truce&nbsp;with this people for 50 years ; which being now&nbsp;expired, Iodocus, archbiſhop of Dorpt and canon&nbsp;of Munſter in Weſtphalia, ſenlible of the danger to&nbsp;which he was expoſed by the vicinity of the Ruſſians,&nbsp;requeſted the czar to give him a prolongation of the&nbsp;truce. .Baſilovitz deſired him to chooſe whether he&nbsp;would have a truce for five years longer, on condition&nbsp;that all the inhabitants of his archbiſhopric ſhould pay&nbsp;to him the annual tribute of a fifth part of a ducat for&nbsp;each perſon, which the people of Γ)orpt had formerly&nbsp;agreed to pay to the grand-dukes of Pleſkow ; or, for&nbsp;20 years, on this farther condition that he and the Livonians ſhould rebuild all the Ruffian churches which&nbsp;had been demoliſhed in their territories at the time of&nbsp;the reformation, and allow his ſubjects the free exerciſe of their religion. Iodocus evaded an anſwer as&nbsp;long as he could : but finding at laſt that the affair&nbsp;grew ſerious, he levied a conſiderable ſum from his&nbsp;ſubjects, and fled with it to Munſter, where he re·&nbsp;ſigned his prebend and married a wife. His ſucceſlbr,&nbsp;whoſe name was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Herman,</span><span class="font0"> and the deputies from Livonia, accepted of the conditions, and ſwore to obſerve&nbsp;them ; with this additional clauſe, that the prieſts of&nbsp;the Romiſh communion ſhould be exempted from paying tribute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But though the Livonians ſwore to the obſervation of theſe terms, they were at that very time in treaty&nbsp;with GuſtavuS Vaſa, king of Sweden, to join them in&nbsp;attacking Ruſſia. <sup>r</sup>Γhe king of Sweden very readily&nbsp;complied with their deſires ; upon which Balilowitz&nbsp;invaded Finland. Guſtavus advanced againſt him with&nbsp;a powerful army ; but as neither the Poles nor Livonians gave him any aſſiſtance, he was obliged to conclude a treaty with the czar, and ſoon after to evacuate the country. Finland was at this time governed&nbsp;by William of Furſtenberg grand-maſter of the Livonian knights, and the archbiſhop of Riga, with ſome&nbsp;other prelates ; between whom a quarrel happened&nbsp;about this time, which ſoon facilitated the deſigns of&nbsp;Baſilovitz on the country. The archbiſhop, after at</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
