                <p><label>RAPIN</label> (Rene), a Jeſuit and eminent French writer, was born at
                    Tours m 1621. He taught polite literature in the ſociety oſ the Jeſuits with
                    great applause, and was juſtly eſteemed one of the best Latin poets and greateſt
                    wits of his time. He died at Paris in 1687. He wrote, 1. A great number of Latin
                    poems, which have rendered him famous throughout all Europe ; among which are
                    his <hi rend="italic">Hortorum libri quatuor,</hi> which is reckoned his
                    maſterpiece. 2. Reflections on Eloquence, Poetry, Hiſtory, and Philosophy. 3.
                    Comparisons between Virgil and Homer, Demoſthenes and Cicero, Plato and

                    works on religious ſubjects. The beſt edition of his Latin poems is that of

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rapin</hi> <hi rend="italic">de Thoyras</hi> (Paul de), a celebrated hiſtorian, was the
                    fon of James de Rapin lord of Thoyras, and was born at Caſtres in 1661. He was
                    educated at fiiſt under a tutor in his father’s houſe ; and afterwards lent to
                    Puylaurens, and thence to Saumur. In 1697 he returned to his father, with a
                    design to apply himself to the ſtudy of the law, and was admitted an advocate :
                    but ſome time after, reflecting that fiis being, a Proteſtant would prevent his
                    advancement at the bar, he reſolved to quit the profeffion of the law, and apply
                    himſelf to that of the ſword ; but his father w°m&lt;l not conſent to ſt.
                    The revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685, and the death of his father,
                    which happened two months after, made him reſolve to come to England ; but as he
                    had no hopes of any fettlement here, his ſtay was but ſhort. He therefore ſoon
                    after went to Holland, and lifted himſelf in the company of French volunteers at
                    Utrecht, commanded by M. Rapin his couſin-german. He attended the Prince of
                    orange into England in 1688 : and the following year the Lord Kingſton made him
                    an enſign in his regiment with which he went into Inland, where he gained the
                    eſteem of his officers at the ſiege of Carrickfergus, and had ſoon a
                    lieutenant’s commiſſion. He was pre. fent at the battle of the Boyne, and was
                    ſhot thro’the ſhoulder at the ſiege of Limerick. He was ſoon after captain of
                    the company in which he had been enſign; but, in 1693, reſigned his company to
                    one of his brothers, in order to be tutor to the earl of Portland’s</p>

                <p>ſon. In 1699, he married Marianne Teſtard; but this marriage neither abated his
                    care of his pupil, nor prevented his accompanying him in his travels. Having
                    ſiniſhed this employment, he returned to his family, which he had ſettled at the
                    Hague ; and here he continued ſome years. But as he found his family increafe,
                    he reſolved to retire to ſome cheap country ; and accordingly removed, in 1707,
                    to weſel, where he wrote his Hiſtory of England, and some other pieces. Though
                    he was of a ſtrong conſtitution, yet ſeventeen years application (for ſo long
                    was he in compofing the hiſtory juſt mentioned) entirely ruined his health. He
                    died in 1725. He wrote in French, 1. A Differtation on the Whigs and Tories. 2.
                    His Hiſtory of England, printed at the Hague in 1726 and 1727, in 9 vols 4to,
                    and reprinted·at Trevoux m 1728, in 10 vols 4to. This laſt edition is more
                    complete than that of the Hague. It has been tranſlated into Engliſh, and
                    improved with Notes, by the Reverend Mr Tindal, in 2 vols folio. This
                    performance, though the work of a foreigner, is defervedly eſteemed as the
                    fulleſt and moſt impartial collection of Engliſh political tranſactions extant.
                    The readers of wit and vivacity, however, may be apt to complain of him for
                    being sometimes rather tedious and dull.</p>
