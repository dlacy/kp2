a ſubſtance diſcovered by Mr Meyer, and by him ſuppoſed to be a new metal ; but Meſſrs Bergman and Kirwan have diſcovered that it is nothing elſe than a natural combination of the phoſphoric acid with iron. Mr Klaproth of Berlin alſo came to the ſame concluſion, without any communication with Mr Meyer. It is extremely difficult to ſeparate this acid from the metal ; however, he found the artificial compound of phoſphoric acid and iron to agree in its properties with the calx ſideri alba obtained by Bergman and Meyer from the cold-ſhort iron extracted from the ſwampy or marſhy ores. The diſcovery of this ſubſtance, however, may be accounted an important affair in chemiſtry, as we are thus furniſhed with an in senſe quantity of phoſphoric acid, which might be applied to uſeful purpoſes if it could be ſeparated from the metal.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
