Owing to the hostility of public&nbsp;opinion, she feared to return to the stage, but she published some&nbsp;more volumes of her writings.

<p><span class="font1">ROB ROY (1671-1734), the popular designation of a famous Highland outlaw whose prowess is the theme of one of Sir&nbsp;Walter Scott<sup>i</sup>S novels, was by descent a Macgregor, being the&nbsp;younger son of Donald Macgregor of GIengyle, lieutenant-colonel in the army of James II., by his wife, a daughter of&nbsp;William Campbell of Gleneaves. He received the name Roy&nbsp;from his red hair, and latterly adopted Campbell as his surname&nbsp;on account of the acts proscribing the name of his clan. Though&nbsp;in stature not much above the middle height, he was so muscular&nbsp;and thickly set that few were his equals in feats of strength,&nbsp;while the unusual length of his arms gave him an extraordinary&nbsp;advantage in the use of the sword. His eyes were remarkably&nbsp;keen and piercing, and with his whole expression formed an&nbsp;appropriate complement to his powerful physical frame. He&nbsp;inherited a small property on the Braes of Balquhidder, and&nbsp;at first devoted himself to the rearing of cattle. Having&nbsp;formed a band of armed clansmen, he obtained, after the&nbsp;accession of William III., a commission from James II. to levy&nbsp;war on all who refused to acknowledge him as king, and in the&nbsp;autumn of 1691 made a descent on Stirlingshire to carry off&nbsp;the cattle of Lord Livingstone, when, being opposed by the&nbsp;villagers of Kippen, he also seized the cattle from all the byres&nbsp;of the village. Shortly afterwards he married Helen Mary,&nbsp;daughter of Macgregor of Comar. On the death of Gregor&nbsp;Macgregor, the chief of the clan, in 1693 he managed, though&nbsp;not the nearest heir, to get himself acknowledged chief, obtaining&nbsp;control of the lands stretching from the Braes of Balquhidder&nbsp;to the shores of Loch Lomond, and situated between the possessions of Argyll and those of Montrose. To assist in carrying&nbsp;on his trade as cattle-dealer he borrowed money from the ist&nbsp;duke of Montrose, and, being unable to repay it, he was in&nbsp;1712 evicted from his property and declared an outlaw. Taking&nbsp;refuge in the more inaccessible Highlands, Rob Roy from this&nbsp;time forward supported himself chiefly by depredations committed in the most daring manner on the duke and his tenants,&nbsp;all attempts to capture him being unsuccessful. During the&nbsp;rebellion of 1715, though nominally siding with the Pretender,&nbsp;he did not take an active part in the battle of Sheriffmuir&nbsp;except in plundering the dead on both sides. He was included&nbsp;in the Act of Attainder; but, having for some time enjoyed&nbsp;the friendship of the duke of Argyll, he obtained, on making&nbsp;his submission at Inveraray, a promise of protection. He now&nbsp;established his residence at Craigroyston, near Loch Lomond,&nbsp;whence for some time he levied blackmail as formerly upon&nbsp;Montrose, escaping by his wonderful address and activity&nbsp;every effort of the English garrison stationed at Inversnaid&nbsp;to bring him to justice. Ultimately, through the mediation of&nbsp;Argyll, he was reconciled to Montrose, and in 1722 he made&nbsp;submission to General Wade; he was carried off, and imprisoned&nbsp;in Newgate, and in 1727 was pardoned just as he was to be&nbsp;transported to Barbados. He then returned to Scotland.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROBSART, the maiden name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lady Amy Dudley</span><span class="font1"> (1532-1560), wife of Lord Robert Dudley, afterwards earl of Leicester. She was the daughter of Sir John Robsart of Norfolk, and was&nbsp;married to Lord Robert on the 4th of June 1550. The marriage&nbsp;was apparently arranged by the family for business reasons,&nbsp;and there is no ground for supposing that it was a love match,&nbsp;or that she was beautiful. Her attraction lay in her estate,&nbsp;which was a provision for a younger son. During the early&nbsp;years of the marriage her husband was entangled in the rebellion&nbsp;of his family against Queen Mary, and was imprisoned in the&nbsp;Tower. She visited him there, and acted for his interests.&nbsp;After his release she saw little of him. When Elizabeth&nbsp;became queen in 1559 Lord Robert was soon known to be her&nbsp;favourite, and it was believed that she would marry him if&nbsp;he were free. IIis wife never came to court and was never in&nbsp;his company. Stories were set about to the effect that she&nbsp;was suffering from cancer and would soon die. Quadra, the&nbsp;Spanish ambassador, reported to the king of Spain that the&nbsp;queen had repeated this rumour to him. In 1560 she went&nbsp;by her husband’s directions to Cumnor Place, a house near&nbsp;Oxford, rented by his agent Anthony Fprster or Forrester,&nbsp;member of parliament for Abingdon. Here she was found&nbsp;lying dead on the floor of the hall on the 8th of September&nbsp;1560 by her servants, whom she had allowed to go to Abingdon&nbsp;Fair. The circumstances of her death never have been, and&nbsp;now cannot be cleared up. A coroner’s jury, which her husband&nbsp;did his best to pack and influence, attributed her end to accident.&nbsp;There is no evidence against Dudley, unless it be evidence that&nbsp;he was a most unscrupulous man, and that he was generally&nbsp;believed to have murdered several other persons who stood in&nbsp;his way.</span></p>
