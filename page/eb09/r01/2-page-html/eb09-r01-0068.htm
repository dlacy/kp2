<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">be broken in frost; when a float and rod are employed, the rod projecting above the funnel catches rain and the&nbsp;resulting reading is too high. Almost all raingauges now&nbsp;used have a circular funnel of known diameter, which conducts the rain-water to a receiver, from which it may be&nbsp;poured into a special narrow measuring-glass so graduated&nbsp;that what would cover a space of the area of the funnel to&nbsp;the depth of 1 inch fills a portion of the glass large enough&nbsp;to be easily graduated into 100 parts. The funnel may&nbsp;have any diameter from 3 to 24 inches without introducing a greater discrepancy than 1 or 2 per cent, of the&nbsp;amount of rain collected, but 5 and 8 inches are the diameters usually employed, and the measuring-glasses are&nbsp;graduated accordingly. Advantage is sometimes taken of&nbsp;the fact that for a funnel 4697־ inches in diameter 1 fluid&nbsp;ounce of water collected represents one-tenth of an inch of&nbsp;rain, since the area is 1733־ square inches, and a fluid&nbsp;ounce at 60° Fahr. contains 1733־ cubic inches of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The best form of instrument, Glaisher’s rain and snow gauge recommended by the Royal Meteorological Society, is a cylindrical copper&nbsp;vessel 8 inches in diameter and 18&nbsp;inches high, in which the funnel is&nbsp;placed about halfway down (see fig. 1).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Scottish Meteorological Society largely employ Howard’s raingauge, a&nbsp;plain glass bottle holding about half&nbsp;a gallon and provided with a long&nbsp;5-inch copper funnel, which has a&nbsp;collar fitting over the neck of the&nbsp;bottle to prevent rain from being&nbsp;blown in laterally by the wind. In&nbsp;some forms the funnel leads to a long&nbsp;glass tube divided into inches, tenths,&nbsp;and hundredths of rainfall. Mr&nbsp;Symon’s storm raingauge on this principle is intended to be read from a&nbsp;distance, and is only graduated into&nbsp;tenths of an inch. The water collected by a raingauge may be weighed&nbsp;instead of measured, but the latter&nbsp;process being much more simple is&nbsp;always adopted, at a slight expense of accuracy, however, as the&nbsp;variation of volume with temperature is not taken into account.&nbsp;Precipitation and evaporation being complementary phenomena,&nbsp;an atmometer or evaporation-gauge ought, strictly speaking, to accompany each raingauge. But none of the instruments yet devised&nbsp;can be regarded as satisfactory, accordingly a number of devices&nbsp;have been introduced to calculate or to minimize the evaporation&nbsp;from raingauges. Dr Garnett in 1795 proposed to use two gauges&nbsp;of unequal size, and recently Prof. Michie Smith has introduced&nbsp;a simplification by making the area of one gauge exactly double&nbsp;that of the other. If the evaporation is the same from each, the&nbsp;difference between the readings of the two gauges gives the true&nbsp;rainfall in the smaller. If </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> be the area of the funnel in the&nbsp;smaller, 2</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> that of the funnel in the larger, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">V</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> a certain volume of&nbsp;water placed in each gauge, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">E</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the evaporation, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">II</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the inches&nbsp;of rainfall, then </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">V</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> + </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">2 All</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> - </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">E-{V+ AR-E) — AR,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> however </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">V</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">E</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> may vary. The simplest and best method is to use a funnel&nbsp;terminating in a long straight tube, which reaches almost to the&nbsp;bottom of the receiving vessel. Gauges have been constructed for&nbsp;experimental purposes always to face the wind, and with openings&nbsp;capable of being fixed at any angle. For use at sea they may be&nbsp;swung on gimbals ; but when so employed the record must be supplemented by the readings of a hydrometer so as to detect and&nbsp;allow for any admixture with sea-spray. Self-registering and self-recording raingauges, as frequently used in meteorological observatories, are constructed on two leading types. In Hermann’s&nbsp;“ hyetometrograph, ” 1789, a fixed funnel conducts the rain into&nbsp;one of twelve glasses placed on the circumference of a horizontal&nbsp;wheel, which is turned by clockwork so that each glass remains&nbsp;under the funnel for one hour. In Stutter’s more recent instrument the receiving funnel delivers into a smaller funnel, which has&nbsp;a sloping tube and is carried round by clockwork so as to remain&nbsp;for one hour over each of twenty-four fixed glasses arranged in a&nbsp;circle. The second kind of self-registering instrument produces a&nbsp;continuous record of rainfall, indicating the hour of commencement&nbsp;and close of each shower, the amount of rain that has fallen, and&nbsp;the rate at which it fell. In Beckley’s “ pluviograph ” a pencil,&nbsp;attached to a vessel which sinks as it receives the rain, describes a&nbsp;curve on a sheet of paper fixed round a rotating cylinder; when&nbsp;full the receiver empties itself by means of a siphon and the pencil&nbsp;is carried rapidly upwards, describing a straight vertical line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The higher a raingauge is placed above the ground, or rather above a broad flat surface, the smaller is the rainfall registered, as&nbsp;the following figures indicate :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Height of funnel above ground in feet. .0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;40&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;200</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bain registered (average)..............158־0 70־0 90־0 93'0 00־1 07־</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">When the mouth of the gauge is on or within a few inches of the ground the insplashing of raindrops increases the amount of water.&nbsp;Minute rain-spherules, which usually float in horizontal or oblique&nbsp;planes, are most numerous near the ground, where consequently&nbsp;they coalesce to form regular drops which fall into the funnel.&nbsp;The raindrops also increase slightly in size by condensing moisture&nbsp;as they fall. But the greatest effect is probably produced by wind,&nbsp;which forms eddies round high and isolated objects, thus more or&nbsp;less interfering with the fall of rain into the gauge. It is obvious&nbsp;that all raingauges intended for comparison should be fixed at the&nbsp;same height, and in Great Britain the standard distance of the&nbsp;mouth of the funnel from the ground or from a broad flat surface&nbsp;is one foot. The situation of a raingauge should be perfectly open,&nbsp;especially in the direction of the prevailing rainbringing winds.&nbsp;In measuring rain it is essential to see that the funnel is not&nbsp;indented or deformed in any way, and that the collecting vessel is&nbsp;inaccessible to air or rain except through the funnel. The temperature of rain as it falls should be observed whenever it is possible&nbsp;to do so. The amount of solid matter collected in the raingauge&nbsp;should be ascertained and recorded as bearing on Mr Aitken’s&nbsp;theory of rain (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Evaporation), </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and it should be examined microscopically for volcanic and cosmic dust.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAIPUR, a district of India, in the Ckhatisgarh division of the Central Provinces, lying between 19° 48' and 21°&nbsp;45' N. lat. and 80° 28' and 82° 38' E. long., with an area&nbsp;of 11,855 square miles. It is bounded on the N. by&nbsp;Bilaspur, on the E. by Sambalpur and Patna, on the W.&nbsp;by Balaghat, Bhandara, and Chanda, and on the S. by&nbsp;Bastar and Jeypur. The district spreads out in a vast&nbsp;plateau closed in by ranges of hills branching from the&nbsp;great Vindhyan chain. It is drained by the Seonath and&nbsp;the Karun rivers, which subsequently unite and form the&nbsp;Mahanadi. Geologically the country consists in the hilly&nbsp;tracts of gneiss and quartzite; the sandstone rocks in the&nbsp;west are intersected with trap dykes. Iron ore is abundant, and red ochre of high repute is found. In the&nbsp;interior the principal strata are a soft sandstone slate&nbsp;(covered generally by a layer of laterite gravel) and blue&nbsp;limestone, which crops out in numerous places on the&nbsp;surface and is invariably found in the beds of the rivers.&nbsp;Throughout the plains the soil is generally fertile. The&nbsp;climate is generally good; the mean temperature is 78°&nbsp;and the average rainfall about 49 inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The population of Raipur in 1881 was 1,405,171 (males 696,242, females 708,929). By religion 856,492 were Hindus, 14,991 Mohammedans, and 821 Christians. The only town with a population&nbsp;exceeding 10,000 is </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Raipur </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(see below). Attached to the district&nbsp;are four feudatory states, viz., Chhuikhadan (with 32,979 inhabitants), Ranker (63,610), Khairagarh (166,138), and Nandgaon&nbsp;(164,339). Their combined area is 2658 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Of the total area under British administration only 3636 square miles are cultivated, and of the portion lying waste 4337 acres are&nbsp;returned as cultivable. The staple crop is rice; other crops are&nbsp;wheat, food-grains, oil-seeds, and cotton. The commerce of Raipur&nbsp;is of quite recent creation, for under the Mahrattas the transit dues&nbsp;that were levied prevented its development. The exports consist&nbsp;mainly of grain, cotton, and lac, while metals constitute the chief&nbsp;import. The gross revenue of the district for 1883-84 amounted to&nbsp;about £89,829, of which the land yielded £64,871.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Raipur was governed by the Haihai-Bansi dynasty of Ratanpur for many centuries until their deposition by the Mahrattas in 1741.&nbsp;The country was then already in a condition of decay, and soon&nbsp;afterwards it relapsed into absolute anarchy. In 1818 it was taken&nbsp;under British superintendence and made rapid progress. It fell&nbsp;with the rest of the Nagpur dominions to the British Government&nbsp;in 1854. Raipur suffered but little during the mutiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAIPUR, chief town of the above district and headquarters of the Chhatisgarh division of the Central Provinces, is situated in 21° 15' N. lat. and 81° 41' E. long., on a plateau 950 feet above sea-level. In 1881 its population&nbsp;amounted to 24,948 (12,447 males and 12,501 females).&nbsp;The modern town dates from 1830, and carries on a flourishing trade in grain, lac, cotton, Ac.</span></p>
