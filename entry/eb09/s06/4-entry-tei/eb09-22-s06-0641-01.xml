or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sumbul,'</hi> also called <hi rend="smallcaps">Musk Root,</hi> a drug recently introduced into European medical practice. It consists of the root of <hi rend="italic">Ferula Sumbul,</hi> Hook., a tall Umbelliferous plant found in the north of Bokhara, its range apparently extending beyond the Amur. It was first brought to Russia in 1835 as a substitute for musk; it was subsequently recommended as a remedy for cholera, and in 1867 was introduced into the British pharmacopoeia. The root as found in commerce consists of transverse sections an inch or more in thickness and from 1 to 3 or more inches in diameter. It has a dark thin papery bark, a spongy texture, and the cut surface is marbled with white and blackish or pale brown ; it has a musky odour and a bitter aromatic taste. Sumbal is used in medicine as an antispasmodic and stimulating tonic, especially in nervous diseases. It owes its medicinal properties to a balsamic resin and an essential oil. Of the former it contains about 9 per cent. and of the latter one-third per cent. The resin is soluble in ether and has a musky smell, which is not fully developed until after contact with water ; by dry distillation it yields umbelliferone, CHO, a crystalline substance soluble in water, ether, and chloroform, and producing in an alkaline solution a brilliant blue fluorescence, which is destroyed by the addition of an acid in excess.</p><p>Under the name of East Indian sumbal, the root of <hi rend="italic">Dorema ammoniacum,</hi> Don., has occasionally been offered in English commerce. It is of a browner hue, has the taste of ammoniacum, and gives a much darker tincture than the genuine drug ; it is thus easily detected. The name “ sumbal ” (a word of Arabic origin, signifying a spike or ear) is applied to several fragrant roots in the East, the principal being <hi rend="italic">Nardostachys Jatamansi,</hi> D.C. (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Spikenard).</hi> West African sumbal is the root of a species of <hi rend="italic">Cyperus.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
