was the wife of a rich merchant in Gueldres, and equally distinguished for her beauty and her virtue. Rhinsauld, a German officer, and governor of the town of Gueldres, fell in love with her ; and not being able, either</p><p>by promises or presents, to seduce her, he imprisoned her husband, pretending that he kept up a traitorous correspondence with the enemies of the state.
