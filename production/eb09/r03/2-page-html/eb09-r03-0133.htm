                after a tire ; it was again burnt in 282 and restored by Diocletian.
                These&nbsp;tires had destroyed nearly all the fine marble arches of Augustus
                ;&nbsp;and Diocletian rebuilt it mostly with brick or travertine piers, a&nbsp;few
                of which remain.@@<sup>1</sup> A final restoration is recorded in an inscription
                discovered in the 16th century, and another in 1882, as being&nbsp;carried out by
                Gabinius Vettius Probianus, præfect of the city in&nbsp;377 (Gruter, </span><span

                class="font2"> 37) mentions that it&nbsp;was one of Caligula’s amusements to throw
                money to the people&nbsp;below from the roof of this basilica, which probably was a
                link in&nbsp;the bridge by which this maniac connected the Palatine with
                the&nbsp;Capitolium. ' The line of the bridge, which starts in the upper
                part&nbsp;of Caligula’s palace, passes over a lofty and massive
                brick-faced&nbsp;building, once lined with marble, which stands on the lower
                slopes&nbsp;of the Palatine. Suetonius’s account (C⅛Z., 22) of the bridge
                makes&nbsp;it very probable that this building is the temple of Augustus,
                as&nbsp;there is no other possible site for it on the line from the Palatine&nbsp;to
                the Capitolium. The intermediate stages from the temple to&nbsp;the basilica and
                thence to the Capitolium were probably merely a&nbsp;wooden structure, as no traces
                of it now remain. The temple of&nbsp;Augustus was begun by Tiberius and finished by
                Caligula (Suet.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"

                columns and&nbsp;piece of entablature, all very delicate and graceful in detail,
                and&nbsp;of the finest workmanship, in Pentelic marble ; the design is of&nbsp;pure
                Greek style. One point shows Roman timidity in the use&nbsp;of a lintel : the frieze
                is jointed so as to form a flat arch, quite&nbsp;needlessly, with the object of
                relieving the weight on the architrave. Its plan, hexastyle, with only eleven
                columns on the sides,&nbsp;is shown in Plate VII. and fig. 14. It had a lofty
                podium, lined&nbsp;with marble, and decorated with a heavy cornice and pilasters,
                one&nbsp;under each column. The podium is an interesting example of
                the&nbsp;enormous solidity of Roman buildings of the best period. Solid&nbsp;tufa
                walls, 8 feet thick, are built under the whole of the cella and&nbsp;the front row
                of columns, while the columns of the sides rest on&nbsp;spurs of similar walling,
                projecting at right angles from that under&nbsp;the cella ; the part immediately
                under the columns is of travertine,&nbsp;and the spurs are united and strengthened
                laterally by massive&nbsp;flat arches, also of travertine. With the exception of a
                small&nbsp;chamber under the steps, entered from the Vicus Tuscus, the
                entire&nbsp;podium is filled up by a solid mass of concrete, made of
                broken&nbsp;tufa, pozzolana, and lime, the whole forming a lofty
                platform,&nbsp;about 22 feet high, solid as a rock, on which the columns
                and&nbsp;upper structure are erected. Small chambers formed in the concrete
                basement, such as the one in this temple, occur in many&nbsp;instances, </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font2"> in the
                temples of Saturn, Divus Julius, and Concord. They were probably used as strong
                rooms, in which money&nbsp;and plate were deposited for safe keeping (see Juv., xiv.
                260), a&nbsp;purpose for which Roman temples were frequently used.
                Two&nbsp;fragments of mosaic, with simple lozenge pattern in white marble&nbsp;and
                basalt, still exist in the cella of this temple. The level of&nbsp;the mosaic shows
                that it is of earlier date than the rebuilding&nbsp;of Tiljerius, as it lies
                considerably below the level of the later floor.&nbsp;It hasall the characteristics
                of early mosaic—very small tesseræ&nbsp;fitted with great accuracy, like the early
                mosaic in the Regia.&nbsp;The temple of Castor was often used as a meeting-place for

                originally passed in front of the temple of Castor ; but in&nbsp;late times its line
                was changed, and it is now covered at this&nbsp;Jioint by rude paving of travertine
                and marble, probably not earlier&nbsp;than the 5th century. The ancient line is

        <p><span class="font2">On the other side of the Sacra Via stand the scanty remains of the

                concrete, which show the position of the tufa&nbsp;foundations under the walls and
                columns (as in the temple of&nbsp;Castor). The temple itself, a hexastyle prostyle

                this very unusual plan was&nbsp;adopted in order that the recess might leave room
