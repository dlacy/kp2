<p><span class="font0">countries. But, fortunately, thoſe paſſing waters occupy leſs room as they advance, and by this wiſe employment of the moſt ſimple means, not only are the ſuperfluous waters drained off from our fertile fields, but the drains themſelves become an uſeful part of the country&nbsp;by their magnitude. They become the habitation of&nbsp;a prodigious number of fiſhes, which ſhare the Creator’s bounty ; and they become the means of mutual&nbsp;communication of all the bleſſings of cultivated ſociety.&nbsp;The vague ramblings of the rivers ſcatter them over the&nbsp;face of the country, and bring them to every door. It&nbsp;is not even an indifferent circumſtance, that they gather&nbsp;ſtrength to cut out deep beds for themſelves. By this&nbsp;means they cut open many ſprings. Without this, the&nbsp;produce of a heavy ſhower would make a ſwamp which&nbsp;would not dry up in many days. And it muſt be ob-ſerved, that the ſame heat which is neceſſary for the&nbsp;vigorous growth of uſeful plants will produce a very&nbsp;copious evaporation. This muſt return in ſhowers&nbsp;much too copious for immediate vegetation, and the&nbsp;overplus would be deſtructive. Is it not pleaſant to&nbsp;contemplate this adjuſtment of the great operations of.&nbsp;nature, ſo different from each other, that if chance alone&nbsp;directed the detail, it was almoſt an infinite odds that&nbsp;the earth would be uninhabitable ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But let us follow the waters in their operations, and note the face of the countries through which they flow:&nbsp;attending to the breadth, the depth, and the ſlope of&nbsp;the valleys, we ſhall be convinced that their preſent ſituation is extremely different from what it was in ancient&nbsp;days ; and that the valleys themſelves are the works of&nbsp;the rivers, or at leaſt of waters which have deſeended&nbsp;from the heights, loaded with all the lighter matters&nbsp;which they were able to bring away with them. The&nbsp;rivers flow now in beds which have a conſiderable permanency ; but this has been the work of ages. This&nbsp;has given ſtability, both by filling up and ſmoothing&nbsp;the valleys, and thus leſſening the changing cauſes, and&nbsp;alſo by hardening the beds themſelves, which are now&nbsp;covered with aquatic plants, and lined with the ſtones,&nbsp;gravel, and coaiſer fand, out of which all the lighter&nbsp;matters have been waſhed away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſurface of the high grounds is undergoing a continual change ; and the ground on which we now&nbsp;walk is,by no means the ſarfie which was trodden by&nbsp;our remote anceſtors. The ſhowers from heaven carry '&nbsp;down into the valleys, or ſweep along by the torrents,&nbsp;a part of the foil which covers the heights and ſteeps.&nbsp;The torrents' carry this foil into the brooks, and theſe&nbsp;deliver part of it into the great rivers, and theſe diſcharge into the ſea this fertilizing fat of the earth,&nbsp;where it is ſwallowed up, and forever loſt for the pur-poſes of vegetation. Thus the hillocks lofe of their&nbsp;height, the valleys are filled up, and the mountains are&nbsp;laid bare, and ſhow their naked precipices, which formerly were covered over with a fleſh and ſkin, but now&nbsp;look like the ſkeleton of this globe. The low countries, raiſed and nouriſhed for ſome time by the ſub-ſtance of the high lands, will go in their turn to be buried in the ocean ; and then the earth, reduced to a&nbsp;dreary flat, will become an immenſe uninhabitable maſs.&nbsp;This cataſtrophe is far diſtant, becauſe this globe is in its&nbsp;youth, but it is not the leſs certain ; and the united labours of the human race could not long protract the term.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">But, in the mean time, we can trace a beneficent</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">pnrpoſe, and a nice adjuſtment oſſeemingly remote cir-cumſtances. The grounds near the ſources of all our rivers are indeed gradually ſtripped of their moſt fertile&nbsp;ingredients. But had they retained them for ages, the&nbsp;ſentient inhabitants of the earth, or at leaſt the nobler&nbsp;animals, with man at their head, would not have derived&nbsp;much advantage from it. The general laws of nature&nbsp;produce changes in our atmoſphere which muſt ever&nbsp;render theſe great elevations unfruitful. That genial warmth, which is equally neceſſary for 'the uſeful&nbsp;plant as for the animaΓwhich lives on it, is confined to&nbsp;the lower grounds. The earth, which on the top of&nbsp;mount Hæmus could only bring forth moſs and dittany,&nbsp;when brought into the gardens of Spalatro, produced&nbsp;pot-herbs ſo luxuriant, that Diocleſian told his colleague&nbsp;Maximian that he had more pleaſure in their cultivation than the Roman empire could confer. Thus nature not only provides us manure, but conveys it to our&nbsp;fields. She even keeps it ſafe in ſtore for us till it ſhall&nbsp;be wanted. The tracts, of country which are but newly inhabited by man, ſuch as great part of America,&nbsp;and the newly diſcovered regions of Terra Auſtralis,&nbsp;are ſtill almoſt occupied by marſhes and lakes, or covered&nbsp;with impenetrable ſoreſts ; and they'would remain long&nbsp;enough in this ſtate, if population, continually increaſing, did not increaſe induſtry, and multiply the hands&nbsp;of cultivators along with their neceſſities. The Author&nbsp;of Nature was alone able to form the huge ridges of&nbsp;the mountains, to model the hillocks and the valleys, to&nbsp;mark out the courſes of the great rivers, and give the&nbsp;firſt trace to every rivulet ; but has left to man the taſlc&nbsp;of draining his own habitation and the fields which are&nbsp;to ſupport him, becauſe this is a tafle not beyond his&nbsp;powers. It was therefore of immenſe advantage to&nbsp;him that thoſe parts of the globe into which he has&nbsp;not yet penetrated ſhould remain covered with lakes,&nbsp;marſhes, and ſoreſts, which keep in ſtore the juice of&nbsp;the earth, which the influence of the air and the vivifying warmth of the ſun would have expended long&nbsp;ere now in uſeleſs vegetation, and which the .rains of&nbsp;heaven would have ſwept into the ſea, had they not&nbsp;been thus protected by their ſituation or their cover.&nbsp;It is therefore the buſineſs of man to open up theſe&nbsp;mines of hoarded wealth, and to thank the Author of&nbsp;ail good, who has thus huſhanded them for his uſe, and&nbsp;left them as a rightful heritage for thoſe of after days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The earth had not in the remote ages, as in our day, thoſe great canals, thoſe capacious voiders, always ready&nbsp;to drain off the rain waters (of which only part is ab-forbed by the thirſty ground), and the pure waters&nbsp;of the ſprings from the foot of the hills. The rivers&nbsp;did not then exiſt, or were only torrents, whoſe waters,&nbsp;confined by the gullies and glens, are ſearching for a&nbsp;place to eſcape. Hence ariſe thoſe numerous lakes in&nbsp;the interior of great continents, of which there are ſtill&nbsp;remarkable relicks in North America, which in pro-ceſs of time will diſappear, and become champaign&nbsp;countries. The moſt remote from the ſea, unable to&nbsp;contain its waters, finds an iſſue through ſome gorge of&nbsp;the hills, and pours over its ſuperfluous waters into a&nbsp;lower hafon, which, in its turn, diſcharges its contents&nbsp;into another, and the laſt of the chain delivers its waters by a river into the ocean. The communication&nbsp;was originally begun by a ſimple overflowing at the&nbsp;Iow’eſt part of the margin. This made a torrent, which</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
