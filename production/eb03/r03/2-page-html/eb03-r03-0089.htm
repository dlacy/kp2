The following accident afforded them the wiſhed-for pretence.&nbsp;Their envoys arriving at Wilna, deſired admittance </span><span class="font1">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the king’s preſence : which being refuſed, one of them&nbsp;endeavoured to force his way in ; but the porter ſhut&nbsp;the door rudely againſt him, and in ſo doing broke one&nbsp;-cf his fingers. The ſervant was immediately put to&nbsp;.--death for this offence : but the Servians, by no means&nbsp;ſatisfied with that, returned home in great fury, and&nbsp;prevailed upon their countrymen to ſubmit themſelves&nbsp;and their country to the Muſcovites. Cafimir made&nbsp;; ſeveral attempts to recall them, but to no purpoſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Matthias king of Hungary dying about this time, two of his ſons, Uladiflaιi6, then king of Bohemia, and&nbsp;i John Albert, contended for the vacant crown. Cafimir&nbsp;-wanted to give it to,the latter, whom he accordingly&nbsp;aſſiſted to the utmoſt of his power ; and to enable him&nbsp;the better ſo to do, though he was in great want of&nbsp;money as well as men, he purchaſed a renewal of the&nbsp;truce with the Ruffians, and thereby gave John Bafi∙&nbsp;lovitz time to eſtabliſh himſelf in his new acquiſi-tions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cafimir died in the year 1492, and was ſucceeded on the throne of Poland by his ſon John Albert, w ho,&nbsp;totally diſregarding the Ruffians, involved himſelf un-neceffarily in a war with the brave Stephen duke of&nbsp;Moldavia : and though he had at the ſame time both&nbsp;the Tartars and Tufks againſt him, his propenſity to&nbsp;pleaſure, and his laſeivious diſpofition, rendered him ſo&nbsp;indolent, that he not only did not ſo much as attempt&nbsp;to moleſt Bafilowitz in any of his poffeſſions, but concluded a peace with him on terms very advantageous&nbsp;tp the latter ; and even entered into a treaty, by which&nbsp;he ſtipulated not to aſſiſt the Lithuanians, though they&nbsp;had choſen his brother Alexander for their duke, in&nbsp;caſe the Ruffians ſhould attack them, as it was ſuppoſed they would. Alexander thinking to parry the inconveniences of this agreement, and to guard againſt&nbsp;the deſigns of his enemies, demanded in marriage Ba-ſilowitz’s daughter, Helena, by his ſecond wife Sophia,&nbsp;and obtained her. The Lithuanians then flattered&nbsp;themſelves with a profpect of tranquillity : but the ambitious </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">czar,</span><span class="font0"> for Bafilovitz had affumed that title ſince&nbsp;bis conqueſt of Caſan, aiming only at the increaſe of&nbsp;dominion, ſoon found a pretence to break with his new&nbsp;allies, by alleging, that Poliſh Ruſſia, as far as the ri-∙,ver Berezina, had formerly belonged to his anceſtors,&nbsp;--and therefore ſhould be his ; and that Alexander, by&nbsp;his marriage-contract, had engaged to build a Greek&nbsp;church at Wilna for his Ruffian conſort, which he had&nbsp;not done, but on the contrary endeavoured to force&nbsp;the Poliſh Ruffians to embrace the religion of the&nbsp;church of Rome. In conſequence of this plea, he ſent&nbsp;into the territories of his ſon-in-law, by different ways,&nbsp;i three armies, which reduced ſeveral places, deſtroyed&nbsp;the country about Smojenſko, and defeated the Lithu∙&nbsp;.anian ſield-marſhal Oſtroſky near the river Wedr'alch,&nbsp;where he fell unawares into an ambuſh cf the Ruffians.&nbsp;Alexander raiſed a new army of Sijeſians, Bohemians,&nbsp;and Moravians ; but they came too late, the Ruffians&nbsp;having retired with their plunder. Elated by their&nbsp;ſucceſs againſt the Lithuanians, they invaded Livonia&nbsp;-in the year 1502, with 130,000 men : but Walter Von&nbsp;Plettenberg, grand-maſter of the knights of the croſs,&nbsp;with only 12,000 men, gave them a total overthrow ;&nbsp;-killing 10,000 of his enemies, with ſcarce any lofs on&nbsp;his own fide. Bafilovitz diipirited by this defeat, and&nbsp;being then engaged in a war with the Tartars, the&nbsp;Poles, and the city of Pleſkow; immediately diſpatched&nbsp;an embaffy to Plettenberg, and concluded a truce with&nbsp;him for 50 years. At the ſame time he begged of&nbsp;that general to ſend to Moſcow, that he might ſee him,&nbsp;one of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">iron-dragoons,</span><span class="font0"> as he called them, wſho had&nbsp;performed wonders iια the late engagement. Von Plettenberg readily complied ; and the czar, ſtruck with&nbsp;admiration, rewarded the cuiraſſier’s accompliſhments&nbsp;with conſiderable honours and preſents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alexander had been elected king of Poland upon the death of his brother John Albert, which happened&nbsp;in the beginning of this year : but the Poles refuſed&nbsp;to crown his confort Helena, becauſe ſhe adhered to&nbsp;the Greek religion. Provoked at this affront, and probably ſtill more ſtimulated by ambition, Bafilovitz reſolved again to try his fortune with them; and accordingly ordered his ſon Demetrius, now the eldeſt, </span><span class="font1">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">march againſt Smolenſko, and reduce that city. The&nbsp;young prince did all that could be done : but the vigorous refiſtance of the belieged, and the arrival of the&nbsp;king of Poland with a numerous army, obliged the&nbsp;Ruffians to raiſe the fiege and return home ; and the&nbsp;czar was glad to make a freſh truce with the Poles for&nbsp;fix years, upon the eaſy terms of only returning the&nbsp;priſoners he had taken. Some writers ſay, that flying&nbsp;into a violent paſſion with his ſon the moment he ſaw&nbsp;him, and imputing the miſcarriage oſ this expedition&nbsp;to his want of courage or conduct, he gave him a blow&nbsp;which laid him dead at his feet ; to which is added,&nbsp;that remorſe for this raſſi action carried his father to&nbsp;his grave: but this account is not confirmed by authors&nbsp;whoſe authority can be relied on. Certain it is, however, that neither of them long furvived this event; and&nbsp;that Demetrius died firſt : for Sophia, who had gained&nbsp;an abſolute aſcendant over her huſhand, and wanted to&nbsp;give the ſovereignty to her own children, perfiιaded&nbsp;him by various artful infinuations to ſet afide and im-priſon his grandſon Demetrius, the only child of the&nbsp;late John, whom he had by his firſt wife Maria, and&nbsp;declare her then eldeſt ſon, Gabriel, his ſucceffor. Age&nbsp;and infirmities had rendered the czar ſo weak, that he&nbsp;blindly followed the iniquitous advice ; but ſhortly after finding his end approach, he ſent for young Demetrius, expreffed great repentance for his barbarity&nbsp;towards him, and on his death-bed declared him his&nbsp;lawful ſucceffor. He died in November 1 705, after a&nbsp;reign of 55 years; leaving behind him an immenſe&nbsp;territory, chiefly of his own acquiring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The czar was no ſooner dead, than his ſon Gabriel Ivanovitz, at the ^inftigation of his mother Sophia,&nbsp;put an end to,the life of the young Demetrius, by&nbsp;confining him in priſon, wſhere heperiſhed with hunger&nbsp;and cold; alter wſhich Gabriel was crowned by the name&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Baſllius,</span><span class="font0"> and took the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cz,ar,</span><span class="font0"> as well as all&nbsp;the other titles belonging to the ſovereignty. On his&nbsp;acceſſion to the throne he expected that the Poles would&nbsp;be in confuſion about the election of a new ſovereign ;&nbsp;but his expectations, being defeated by their unanimous</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
