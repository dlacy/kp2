(Gaſpar), who, from painting a great number of Magdalens, was called <hi rend="italic">Magdalen Smith,</hi> was a Dutch painter, who came to England ſoon after the Reſtoration. For theſe portraits sat a woman that he kept, and called his wife. A lady, whom he had taught to draw, took him with her to Ireland, where he painted ſmall portraits in oil, had great buſineſs, and high prices. His flowers and fruit were ſo much admired, that one bunch of grapes ſold there for L. 40. In his Magdalens he generally introduced a thiſtle on the fore ground. He had ſeveral ſcholars, particularly Maubert, and one Gawdy of Exeter. Yet, notwithſtanding his success, he died poor in Ireland in 1707.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
