a city of Spain, in the province of Old Castille. It is situated on the northern coast, on the Bay of Biscay, and is one of the best ports on that shore. It carries on considerable commerce in fine wools, and imports large quantities of the salted fish of Newfoundland. The commerce with the interior has induced the construction of a good road to Reynosa, in spite of the rocks and quagmires which intervene. It is the see of a bishop, and has an ancient cathedral and several richly adorned churches. It is in north latitude 43. 28. 20. and west longitude 3. 5. 6. from London. It contains 10,000 inhabitants, one sugar refinery, some breweries, founderies, a royal one for anchors, and several tanneries.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
