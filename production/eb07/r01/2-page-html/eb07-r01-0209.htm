<p><span class="font0">a very unusual accumulation of comparisons before it can ' be relied on for any further purpose in argument than that&nbsp;which it has often served so well, namely, the repelling of&nbsp;captious refutations. In this kind of argument, quite as&nbsp;strictly as in any other instance of example, the things compared are assumed, in regard to the point of comparison, to&nbsp;belong to the same genus ; but there is evidently here a&nbsp;still greater risk than that which prevails in other reasonings of the same class, of either over-estimating or underestimating the weight of the evidence. The generic and&nbsp;specific names in common use alternately involve us in mistakes and help to extricate us from them. All of these&nbsp;are accurate for their own purposes ; but the purpose for&nbsp;which we use the example may, though quite legitimate,&nbsp;be extremely different from that which has dictated the&nbsp;common divisions. If, taking any number of men, who&nbsp;form a class in respect of social or civil relations,—a nation,&nbsp;a civic community, or even a large household,—we discover&nbsp;a certain physical peculiarity in one individual, and thence,&nbsp;without examination, infer it of another,—we are arguing,&nbsp;not from similarity, but from one of the remotest and most&nbsp;worthless of all analogies ; an analogy founded, not on any&nbsp;of those qualities of the individuals which came into view&nbsp;in their classification, but on one which merely happens&nbsp;to belong to one of them, and possibly or probably may&nbsp;not be found in any other, being, in short, what logicians&nbsp;would call an inseparable accident. On the other hand, direct and close similarities may be continually discovered&nbsp;between individuals which have in ordinary language no&nbsp;common name, and which could not be classed together&nbsp;for any of the practical purposes of life. Amidst the countless variety of natures and ends which divides the universe&nbsp;into such an interminable number of classes, genera, and&nbsp;species, all the individuals arc united by at least one common relation, that which the created bear to the Creator ;&nbsp;and when we endeavour to contemplate the world in its&nbsp;position towards God, we discover near and essential resemblances between the highest sentient beings and the most&nbsp;insignificant atoms of matter,—between the spirit of the&nbsp;archangel and the trodden grain of sand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In estimating the force of Arguments from Example, our great task should always be, to discover the principle of the&nbsp;division which the reasoning assumes. Ifwe clearly apprehend the principle, and keep it steadily in view, we shall&nbsp;be able to steer safely through all the perplexities of individual cases. When the alleged point of similarity makes&nbsp;up the whole essence of the genus, the pioof, supposing&nbsp;the genus really to exist, is morally certain : when it appears on analysis to be only a separable accident of an individual, the proof is a worthless analogy. Between these&nbsp;two extreme points lies the wide channel through whose&nbsp;shoals the principle will always be able to pilot us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In regard to the Comparative Efficiency and the Proper Order of the several kinds of arguments, as indeed in regard to every other point essential to the rhetorical art,&nbsp;Aristotle will furnish us with the germ of all the principles,&nbsp;and with many of their elucidations; but Whately’s work is&nbsp;extremely valuable in this section, and will aid us scarcely&nbsp;less than it has aided us in the inquiry which w<sup>,</sup>e have just&nbsp;left. All that is most important on this subject may be&nbsp;comDrehended under the answers to three questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">First, what is the Comparative Efficiency of the several sorts of arguments, considered with reference to the nature&nbsp;of the conclusions sought to be established by them ? Our&nbsp;guide answers as follows. “ Matters of opinion, as they are&nbsp;callcd (that is, where we are not said properly to know,&nbsp;,but to judge), are established chiefly by Antecedent Probability (arguments of the first class, from cause to effect),&nbsp;though tlιe Testimony of wise men is also admissible ; past&nbsp;facts, chiefly by Signs of various kmds (that term, it must&nbsp;be remembered, including Testimony); and future events,&nbsp;by Antecedent Probabilities and Examples.” Cases may&nbsp;often occur which form exceptions to these principles ; but&nbsp;reflection will easily convince every one that the outline of&nbsp;them here given is substantially accurate ; and any doubts&nbsp;which may arise on an abstract consideration of the question may be certainly removed by an examination of the&nbsp;most, convincing argumentative compositions. In few instances where argument is applied to practical uses, does&nbsp;any of the several sorts of conclusions constitute the whole&nbsp;of the end which the discourse proposes ; but, in every discourse, one or another of the kinds holds the most prominent place. Compositions chiefly designed for instruction&nbsp;or exhortation, such as ethical and most religious discourses,&nbsp;being principally conversant about conclusions of the first&nbsp;class, appeal mainly to the argument from cause to effect,&nbsp;strengthening this argument by authorities fairly and judiciously selected, and also making frequent use of examples,&nbsp;seldomer however as proofs than as illustrations, which are&nbsp;not introduced for the purpose of proving anything, but&nbsp;merely in order to place imperfectly-apprehended proposi∙&nbsp;tions in a stronger light. Judicial oratory, when employed on&nbsp;those questions which fall within the province of juries, has&nbsp;mainly reference to the second class of conclusions, so that&nbsp;signs compose the chief weapons of the legal speaker’s armoury. Harangues addressed to deliberative assemblies&nbsp;embrace the whole field of conclusions, but in most cases&nbsp;are chiefly directed tow ards those of the third class.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Secondly, what is the Comparative Efficiency of the several sorts of argument, considered with reference to our position towards the party whom we desire to convince ? Which sort is best calculated for direct Conviction ? and which for&nbsp;Refutation ? We again borrow an answer. “ It should be&nbsp;considered whether the principal object of the discourse be,&nbsp;to give </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">satisfaction to a candid mind</span><span class="font0"> and convey </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">instruction</span><span class="font0"> to those who are ready to receive it, or to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comped the&nbsp;assent or silence the. objections</span><span class="font0"> of an opponent. The former of these purposes is in general principally to be accomplished by the former of those two great classes into&nbsp;which arguments were divided (viz. by those from cause to&nbsp;effect), the other by the latter. To whatever class, however, the arguments we resort to may belong, the general&nbsp;tenor of the reasoning will in many respects be affected by&nbsp;the present consideration. The distinction in question is&nbsp;nevertheless in general little attended to. It is usual to call&nbsp;an argument simply </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">strong</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">weak,</span><span class="font0"> without reference to&nbsp;the purpose for which it was designed ; whereas the arguments which afford the most </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">satisfaction</span><span class="font0"> to a candid mind,&nbsp;are often such as would have less weight in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">controversy&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">than many others, which, again, would be less suitable for&nbsp;the former purpose. For example ; the internal evidence&nbsp;of Christianity in general proves the most satisfactory to a&nbsp;believer’s mind, but is not that which makes the most show&nbsp;in the refutation of infidels. The arguments from analogy,&nbsp;on the other hand, which are the most </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">unanswerable,</span><span class="font0"> are&nbsp;not so pleasing and consolatory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thirdly, where we are in possession of arguments of all the kinds, all bearing on the conclusion which we wish to&nbsp;reach, what Arrangement of these is most effectual for producing conviction ? This question is one of the most important in rhetoric : indeed there is scarcely any other&nbsp;which goes so closely to the foundation of all eloquence.&nbsp;A just Arrangement of Arguments is indispensable towards&nbsp;success in conviction or persuasion ; and the leading principles of eloquence carry us by a very short journey to general rules on the subject, which may be considered as infallible. Aristotle has not enlarged on this point further than&nbsp;to press the necessity </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">using probative examples in the&nbsp;very last place ; but Whately has very justly observed that&nbsp;the principle should be extended much more widely.
