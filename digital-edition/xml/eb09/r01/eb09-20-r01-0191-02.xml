                <p><label>RABAD</label> (ראב״ד). Under this abbreviation five Jewish scholars are
                    known, all of whom, singularly enough, lived during the 12th century.</p>
                <p>I. Rab Ab-Beth-Din, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the chief rabbi <hi
                        rend="italic">par excellence.</hi> His real name was R. Abraham b. Yishak of
                    Narbonne. He was the teacher of the most distinguished rabbis of Provence,
                    including his famous son-in-law (Rabad III.) and Rabbenu Zerahyah Hallevi, the
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Maor.</hi> It has always been known that a great
                    deal of literature on the Talmud belonging to him is mixed up with the works of
                    others, notably with those of Rabad (see III. below).</p>
                <p>In 1867-69, however, Dr B. H. Auerbach, rabbi of Halberstadt, edited for the
                    first time Rabad’s chief work, <hi rend="italic">The Eshkol,</hi> in three
                    parts, 4to.</p>
                <p>IL R. Abbaham b. David (Dâùd, דאוד) <hi rend="smallcaps">Hallevi of Toledo, the
                        historiographer, who suffered martyrdom in 1180. His chief work has been
                        printed innumerable times, and repeatedly with historical additions from
                        earlier sources. Some of the parts of this “ Tradi-tion ” and of these
                        additions have been translated into Latin,</hi>
               </p>
                <p>English, and German. (1) His historical work, ספר הקבלה, is a chronicle down to
                    1161, preceded by Seder 'Olam and Megillath Ta <hi rend="sup">,</hi> anith
                    (Mantua, 1513, 4to) ; cheap editions are to be got in Poland. (2) His
                    philosophico-theological work (composed in Arabic, translated into Hebrew by R.
                    Shelomoh Ibn Labi—14th century— and into German by Weil) came out at Frankfort
                    in 1852, 8vo.</p>
                <p>III. R. Abbaham b. David, disciple and son-in-law of Rabad I.</p>
                <p>This is the “great Rabbi of Posquières.” the only opponent whom Maimonides
                    thought a match for himself. He died in 1198. His works are :—(1) Commentary on
                    the Mishnic treatise <hi rend="italic">'Eduyyoth</hi> (see Mishkah, vol. xvi. p.
                    506), which accompanies some early and all later editions of the Babylonian
                    Talmud (that on <hi rend="italic">Tamid,</hi> as-cribed to him, is not his). (2)
                    Commentary on <hi rend="italic">Siphro</hi> (see vol. xvi. p. 507). (3) Much of
                        <hi rend="italic">Temim De'im,</hi> part of the collection</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Tummath Yesharim,</hi> on various Rabbinic matters, Venice,
                    1622, fol. (4) <hi rend="italic">Ba'ale Hannephesh,</hi> on laws relating to
                    women (first inde-pendent edition, Prague, 1811, 4to). (5) <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hassagoth,</hi> or Strictures</p>
                <p>on the <hi rend="italic">Mishneh Torah</hi> of Maimonides <hi rend="italic"
                        >(q.v.).</hi> These accompany most early and all later editions of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Mishneh Torah.</hi>
               </p>
                <p>IV. R. Abbaham b. David, author of the commentary on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sepher Yesirah.</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> The idea that R.
                        Yoseph Arukh—Mακρόs (a Greek) or Longus (a Roman)—was the author of this
                        commentary must be given up. On the other hand, it is not quite impossible
                        that this commentator and the writer of the Strictures on Rashi are one and
                        the same person. </note> His commentary has been printed innumerable times
                    with the work itself, the <hi rend="italic">editio princeps</hi> at Mantua in
                    1562, 4to. Part of its preface was done in Latin by Rittangelius (Am-sterdam,
                    1642, 4to).</p>
                <p>V. R. Abbaham b. David. He wrote Strictures <hi rend="italic">(Hassagoth)</hi>
                    on</p>
                <p>Rashi on the Pentateuch. This little and most interesting book was either
                    written by a Sepharadi or Provençal, and lies in MS. (Add., 377, 3, 1) in the
                    Cambridge University Library. No other copy is known. (S. M. S.-S.)</p>
