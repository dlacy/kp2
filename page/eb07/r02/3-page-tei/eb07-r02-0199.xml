Therefore, by the rules of pendulous bodies, it tends to come back. This would be more remarkably the case if the points of suspension C and D were on the same side of the point P with the points of attachment A and B ; for in this case the new point of intersection of the lines of support would shift to the opposite side, and be still further from the vertical line through the new position of the centre of gravity. But if the points of suspension and of attachment are on opposite sides of P, the new point of intersection may shift to the same side with the centre of gravity, and lie beyond the vertical line. In this case the equilibrium is tottering. It is easy to perceive, too, that if the equilibrium of suspension from tile points C and D be stable, the equilibrium on the props AE and BF must be tottering. It is not necessary for our present purpose to engage more particularly in this discussion.</p><p>It is plain that, with respect to the mere momentary equilibrium, there is no difference in the support by threads, props, or planes, and we may substitute the one for the other. We shall find this substitution extremely usefιd, because we easily conceive distinct notions of the support of a body by strings.</p><p>Observe farther, that if the whole figure be inverted, and strings be substituted for props, and props for strings, the equilibrium will still obtain. For by comparing fig. 5 with fig. 6, we see that the vertical line through the centre of gravity will pass through the intersection of the two strings or props ; and this is all that is necessary for the equilibrium ; only it must be observed in the substitution of props for threads, and of threads for props, that if it be done without inverting the whole figure, a stable equilibrium becomes a tottering one, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p><p>This is a most useful proposition, especially to the unlettered artisan, and enables him to make a practical use of problems which the greatest mechanical geniuses have found it no easy task to solve. An instance will show the extent and utility of it. Suppose it were required to make a mansard or kirb roof whose width</p><p>is AB (fig. 7), and consisting of the four equal rafters AC, CD, DE, EB. There can be no doubt but that its best form is that which will put all the parts in equilibrio, so that no ties or stays may be necessary for opposing the unbalanced</p><p>thrust of any part of it. Make a chain <hi rend="italic">acdeb (fig.</hi>  8) of four equal pieces, loosely connected bypin-joints, round which the parts are perfectly moveable. Suspend this from two pins α, ⅛, fixed in a horizontal line.</p><p>This chain or festoon will arrange itself in such a form that its parts are in equilibrio. Then we know that if the figure be inverted, it will compose the frame or truss of a kirb-roof <hi rend="italic">aγlιb,</hi>  which is also in equilibrio, the thrusts of the pieces balancing each</p><p>other in the same manner that the mutual pulls of the hanging festoon <hi rend="italic">acdeb</hi>  did. If the proportion of the height <hi rend="italic">df </hi>to the width <hi rend="italic">ab</hi>  is not such as pleases, let the pins <hi rend="italic">a, b</hi>  be placed nearer or more distant, till a proportion between the width and height is obtained which pleases, and then make</p><p>the figure ACDEB, fig. 7, similar to it. It is evident that this proposition will apply in the same manner to the determination of the form of an arch of a bridge ; but this is not a proper place for a further discussion.</p><p>We are now enabled to compute all the thrusts and other pressures which are exerted by the parts of a roof on each other and on the walls. Let AB (fig. 9) be a beam standing anyhow obliquely, and G its centre of gravity.</p><p>Let us suppose that the ends of it are supported in any directions AC, BD, by strings, props, or planes. Let these directions meet in the point <hi rend="italic">P of</hi>  the vertical line PG passing through its centre of gravity. Through G draw lines <hi rend="italic">Ga, Gb</hi>  parallel to PB, PA. Then The weight of the beam    1    f PG</p><p>The pressure or thrust at A &gt; is proportional to √ <hi rend="italic">Pa </hi>And the pressure at B    J    ( P⅛.</p><p>For when a body is in equilibrio between three forces, these forces are proportional to the sides of a triangle which have their directions.</p><p>In like manner, if A <hi rend="italic">g</hi>  be drawn parallel to P <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>  we shall have</p><p>Weight of the beam 1    <hi rend="italic">tPg</hi></p><p>Thrust on A    &gt; proportional to √ PA</p><p>And thrust on B    j    <hi rend="italic">[Ag</hi></p><p>Or, drawing Bχ parallel to <hi rend="italic">Pa,</hi></p><p>Weight of the beam 1    i Pχ</p><p>Thrust at A    &gt;    proportional to √ Bχ</p><p>And thrust at B    )    ( PB,</p><p>It cannot be disputed that, if strength alone be considered, the proper form of a roof is that which puts the whole in equilibrio, so that it would remain in that shape although all the joints were perfectly loose or flexible. If it has any other shape, additional ties or braces are necessary for preserving it, and the parts are unnecessarily strained. When this equilibrium is obtained, the rafters which compose the roof are all acting on each other in the direction of their lengths ; and by this action, combined with their weights, they sustain no strain but that of compression, the strain of all others that they are the most able to resist. We may consider them as so many inflexible lines having their weights accumulated in their centres of gravity. But it will allow an easier investigation of the subject, if we suppose the weights to be at the joints, equal to the real vertical pressures which are exerted on these points. These are very easily computed ; for it is plain, that the weight of the beam AB (fig. 9) is to the part of this weight that is supported at B as AB to AG. Therefore, if W represent the weight of the beam, the vertical pressure at AG</p><p>B will be W × L_, and the vertical pressure at A will be Ab BG</p><p>W × ξ-θ. In like manner, the prop BF being considered</p><p>as another beam, and/as its centre of gravity and <hi rend="italic">w</hi>  as its ∕<hi rend="sup">,</hi>F</p><p>weight, a part of this weight, equal to <hi rend="italic">w</hi>  × g=, is support-AG</p><p>ed at B, and the whole vertical pressure at B is W X γθ ∕F</p><p><hi rend="italic">+ w × —. </hi>And thus we greatly simplify the consideration of the mutual thrusts of roof frames.
