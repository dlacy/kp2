<p><span class="font1">frequent steamers from Liverpool and other ports. The shore of the bay is sandy and gently sloping, and excellent&nbsp;bathing is afforded. A golf links, a geological and antiquarian&nbsp;museum, the Mooragh Park by the side of the lake, and the&nbsp;palace or concert hall, are among the attractions to visitors.&nbsp;Ramsey is connected with Laxey, the summit of Snaefell, and&nbsp;Douglas by electric tramway, and has connexion with the&nbsp;western part of the island by the Manx Northern railway. The&nbsp;Albert tower, on a wooded hill above the town, commemorating&nbsp;a visit of the Prince Consort in 1847, is<sup> </sup>a favourite view-point.&nbsp;The harbour has some coasting and fishing trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMSGATE, a municipal borough, watering-place, seaport and member of the Cinque Port of Sandwich, in the Isle of&nbsp;Thanet parliamentary division of Kent, England, 79 m. E. by&nbsp;S. of London by the South Eastern &amp; Chatham railway.&nbsp;Pop. (1901) 27,733. This is one of the most popular resorts&nbsp;on the Kent coast, well situated on the east coast of Thanet,&nbsp;practically contiguous with Broadstairs to the north, with&nbsp;which and Margate to the north-west it is united by an electric&nbsp;tramway. During the season steamers connect it with London&nbsp;and the intermediate watering-places on the north coast, and&nbsp;with Calais and Boulogne. The harbour has an area of 42 acres,&nbsp;and a considerable coasting and fishing trade is carried on.&nbsp;There is a fine sea front, and the beach is of firm sand. The&nbsp;promenade pier was erected in 1881. Near it an obeh*sk&nbsp;commemorates the departure of George IV. to Hanover from&nbsp;here, and his return, in 1821. The church of St George&nbsp;was built in 1826, its tower forming a conspicuous landmark,&nbsp;and the Roman Catholic church of St Augustine was built&nbsp;from the designs and at the expense of A. W. Pugin, who&nbsp;was long a resident here. The neighbouring Pegwell Bay,&nbsp;famed for its shrimps, is supposed to have been the scene&nbsp;of the landing of Hengist and Horsa, and at Cliff’s End (Ebbs&nbsp;Fleet) a monolithic cross marks the landing-place of St Augustine&nbsp;in 596. On the summit of Osengal Hill, about a mile to the&nbsp;west of the town, a graveyard of early Saxon settlers was&nbsp;discovered during the cutting of the railway. The remains&nbsp;proved it to belong to the 5th and 6th centuries. Ramsgate&nbsp;was incorporated in 1884, and is governed by a mayor,&nbsp;6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area, 2304 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ramsgate (Ramesgate) was originally a small but comparatively prosperous place united until 1827 to the parish of St Lawrence. The charter of Charles II. mentions it as&nbsp;having been “ time out of mind ” a member of Sandwich.&nbsp;In 1884 it was incorporated by royal charter, under the title&nbsp;of mayor, aldermen and councillors. A commission of the&nbsp;peace was granted in 1893. Since then the jurisdiction of&nbsp;the Cinque Ports’ justices has ceased within its h*mits, which&nbsp;include the parishes of Ramsgate and St Lawrence Intra. A&nbsp;daily market was obtained in 1784 by grant from George III.&nbsp;No fair was then held, but from 1792 onwards there has been&nbsp;one yearly on the roth of August. Under Elizabeth, Ramsgate&nbsp;was still unimportant though possessed of a fair before the&nbsp;reign of Henry VIII. After 1668 the growth of trade increased&nbsp;its prosperity, and at the beginning of the reign of George I.&nbsp;the pier was enlarged and pier-wardens appointed to collect&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">droits.</span><span class="font1"> In 1749, having been selected as a Harbour of&nbsp;Refuge for the Downs, it underwent great improvements, and&nbsp;henceforward paid </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">£200</span><span class="font1"> yearly to Sandwich out of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">droits&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">for clearing the Channel and repairing the banks of the river&nbsp;Stour within the Liberty; but by 1790 the harbour was of&nbsp;small account.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAMUS, PETRUS, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pierre de la Ramée</span><span class="font1"> (1515-1572), French humanist, was bom at the village of Cuth in Picardy&nbsp;in 1515, a member of a noble but impoverished family; his&nbsp;father was a charcoal-burner. Having gained admission, in a&nbsp;menial capacity, to the college of Navarre, he worked with his&nbsp;hands by day and carried on his studies at night. The reaction&nbsp;against scholasticism was still in full tide; it was the transition&nbsp;time between the old and the new, when the eager and forward-looking spirits had first of all to do battle with scholastic Aris-totelianism. Ramus outdid his predecessors in the impetuosity&nbsp;of his revolt. On the occasion of taking his degree (1536) he&nbsp;actually took as his thesis “ Everything that Aristotle taught&nbsp;is false.” This </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tour de force</span><span class="font1"> was followed up by the publication&nbsp;in 1543 of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aristotelicae Animadversiones</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dialecticae Partitiones,</span><span class="font1"> the former a criticism on the old logic and the latter&nbsp;a new textbook of the science. What are substantially fresh&nbsp;editions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Partitiones</span><span class="font1"> appeared in 1547 as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institutiones&nbsp;Dialecticae,</span><span class="font1"> and in 1548 as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scholae Dialecticae;</span><span class="font1"> his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dialectique&nbsp;(1555),</span><span class="font1"> a French version of his system, is the earliest work on&nbsp;the subject in the French language. Meanwhile Ramus, as&nbsp;graduate of the university, had opened courses of lectures;&nbsp;but his audacities drew upon him the hostility of the conservative party in philosophy and theology. He was accused&nbsp;of undermining the foundations of philosophy and religion,&nbsp;and the matter was brought before the parlement of Paris,&nbsp;and finally before Francis I. By him it was referred to a commission of five, who found Ramus guilty of having “ acted&nbsp;rashly, arrogantly and impudently,” and interdicted his&nbsp;lectures (1544). He withdrew from Paris, but soon afterwards&nbsp;returned, the decree against him being cancelled through the&nbsp;influence of the cardinal of Lorraine. In 1551 Henry II.&nbsp;appointed him professor of philosophy and eloquence at the&nbsp;Collège de France, where for a considerable time he lectured&nbsp;before audiences numbering as many as 2000. He published&nbsp;fifty works in his lifetime and nine appeared after his death.&nbsp;In 1561, however, the enmity against him was fanned into&nbsp;flame by his adoption of Protestantism. He had to flee from&nbsp;Paris; and, though he found an asylum in the palace of&nbsp;Fontainebleau, his house was pillaged and his library burned&nbsp;in his absence. He resumed his chair after this for a time, but&nbsp;in 1568 the position of affairs was again so threatening that he&nbsp;found it advisable to ask permission to travel. Returning to&nbsp;France he fell a victim to his opponents in the massacre of St&nbsp;Bartholomew (1572).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The logic of Ramus enjoyed a great celebrity for a time, and there existed a school of Ramists boasting numerous adherents in France, Germany and Holland. As late as 1626 F. Burgersdyk divides the&nbsp;logicians of his day into the Aristotelians, the Ramists and the&nbsp;Semi-Ramists, who endeavoured, like Goclenius of Marburg, to&nbsp;mediate between the contending parties. Ramus’s works appear&nbsp;among the logical textbooks of the Scottish universities, and he&nbsp;was not without his followers in England in the 17th century. There&nbsp;is even a little treatise from the hand of Milton, published two years&nbsp;before his death, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Artis Logicae Plenior Institutio ad Petri&nbsp;Rami Methοdum coneinnata.</span><span class="font2"> It cannot be said, however, that&nbsp;Ramus’s innovations mark any epoch in the history of logic. His&nbsp;rhetorical leaning is seen in the definition of logic as the “ ars disserendi he maintains that the rules of logic may be better learned&nbsp;from observation of the way in which Cicero persuaded his hearers&nbsp;than from a study of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Organon.</span><span class="font2"> The distinction between natural&nbsp;and artificial logic, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> between the implicit logic of daily speech&nbsp;and the same logic made explicit in a system, passed over into the&nbsp;logical handbooks. Logic falls, according to Ramus, into two&nbsp;parts—invention (treating of the notion and definition) and judgment (comprising the judgment proper, syllogism and method).&nbsp;This division gave rise to the jocular designation of judgment or&nbsp;mother-wit as the “ secunda Petri.” He is, perhaps, most suggestive&nbsp;in his emendations of the syllogism. He admits only the first three&nbsp;figures, as in the original Aristotelian scheme, and in his later works&nbsp;he also attacks the validity of the third figure, following in this&nbsp;the precedent of Laurentius Valla. Ramus also set the modem&nbsp;fashion of deducing the figures from the position of the middle&nbsp;term in the premises, instead of basing them, as Aristotle does,&nbsp;upon the different relation of the middle to the so-called major and&nbsp;minor term. On the whole, however, though Ramus may be&nbsp;allowed to have advanced logical study by the wholesome fermentation of thought which he caused, there is little ground for his pretentious claim to supersede Aristotle by a new and independent&nbsp;system.</span></p>
