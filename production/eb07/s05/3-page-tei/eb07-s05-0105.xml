At these small vessels load and unload. The harbour is formed by the bay, which is about a mile in length, and half of that in breadth. It forms one of the most secure harbours in the north of Scotland, and affords safe anchorage for vessels of 1000 tons burden ; and it is the chief resort for shipping in the northern isles. The wealth of the inhabitants is chiefly derived from the Greenland whalers, which touch here to complete their crews from the sailors belonging to the place, as well as to supply the vessels with provisions and stores. The Hudson Bay vessels also touch here. A number of ships and boats are built at Stromness ; and the manufacture of straw-plait is carried on to a considerable extent. It was erected into a borough of barony in the year 1817, and it is governed by two bailies and nine councillors.

It stands on the river Medway, over which is a bridge connecting it with Rochester, so as in appearance to make it merely a suburb to that city. It consists of a single long street. The church is a fine old building, which formerly belonged to the Knights Templars, who had a palace near this town. The ruins of it are still visible on the banks of the river.

It has a well frequented market on Friday.

In his house he died on the 11th of December 1737, at the patriarchal age of ninety-four.Strype’s principal works are, The Life of Archbishop Cranmer, 1694, fol.: The Life of Sir Thomas Smith, 1698, 8vo: The Life of Dr John Aylmer, bishop of London, 1761, 8vo : The Life of Sir John Cheke, 1705, 8vo: Annals of the Reformation, 4 vols.; vol. i. 17Ô9, reprinted 1725; vol. ii. 1725; vol. iii. 1728; vol. iv. 1731 : The Life of Archbishop Grindal, 1710, fol. : The Life and Letters of Archbishop Parker, 1711, fol.: The Life of Archbishop Whitgift, 1718, fol. : Ecclesiastical Memorials, 1721, 3 vols. fol.The writings of Strype were for many years neglected, but they are now held in deserved estimation ; and they have all been reprinted at the Clarendon press. He is not remarkable for the methodical arrangement of his materials, nor did he ever attain to much proficiency in the art of composition ; bût no one ever denied him the praise of diligence and fidelity. Beside these works, he published Lessons for Youth and Old Age, 1699, 12mo. He likewise published the second volume of Dr Lightfoot’s Works, in 1684 ; and an elaborate edition of Stow’s Survey of London, 1720, 2 vols. fol.STUART, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gilbert, </hi>an eminent jurist and historian, was born at Edinburgh in the year 1742. His father, George Stuart, LL. D., had succeeded John Ker as professor of humanity during the preceding year. According to the tradition of the university, he was an excellent Latinist, but of his proficiency he has left no public proofs. He had prepared an amended and enlarged edition of Ainsworth’s Latin Dictionary ; but it was never committed to the press, and its suppression may perhaps have been occasioned by the too high estimate which the professor had formed of its pecuniary value.The son was educated in the public school and in the university of his native city. Of his proficiency in several branches of study, his various works afford a sufficient criterion. To the pursuit of jurisprudence he devoted himself with uncommon ardour ; but although he had a strong relish for law as a science, he anticipated no delight from its practice, and he was never called to the bar. Of his early progress in this study he exhibited a very conspicuous specimen in a work published without his name ; “ An Historical Dissertation concerning the Antiquity of the English Constitution.” Edinb. 1768, 8vo. It has been asserted that when he produced this work, he was little more than twenty years of age ; but the statement is not sufficiently accurate, for he had then attained his twenty-sixth year. For a writer of that age, or indeed of any age, it is an ingenious and able performance. His chief favourites and models are Tacitus and Montesquieu. With no mean talents for research and disquisition, he has endeavoured to evince that “ the parts which compose our constitution arose more immediately from the forests of Germany.” The same ground had recently been occupied by the learned Dr Squire, bishop of St David’s ; of whose Inquiry into the Foundation of the English Constitution a second edition appeared in the year 1753. Stuart’s Dissertation, distinguished by so much vigour of intellect and maturity of juridical learning, procured him from the university the degree of LL. D., which is very rarely bestowed upon so young a scholar. A second edition, bearing the author’s name, was published at London in the year 1771, and he then prefixed a dedication to the earl of Mansfield.The dedication is dated at London in the month of January 1770; and before this period he had become a regular contributor to the Monthly Review’, with which he continued his connexion from 1768 to 1774. We likewise find him employed as the editor of “ An Historical Treatise on the Feudal Law, and the Constitution and Laws of England ; with a Commentary on Magna Charta, and necessary Illustrations of many of the English Statutes; in aSTRYPE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John,</hi> a most industrious and meritorious labourer in the department of ecclesiastical and literary history, was born at Stepney on the first of November 1643. His father, John van Stryp, was a native of Brabant, and sought refuge in England on account of his religion. He was a merchant and silk-thrower. The son received his early education at St Paul’s school, where he remained for six years. In 1662 he proceeded to Jesus College, Cambridge, from which he was transferred to Catherine Hall. In 1665, he there took the degree of A.B., and that of A.M. four years afterwards. He was appointed to the perpetual curacy of Theydon-Boys, in the county of Essex, in 1669 ; but he only retained it for a few months, having been appointed minister of Low Leyton, in the same county. He was elected by the parishioners, whom the patrons had left to make their own choice of a spiritual guide. His emoluments were not secured to him in the usual way, but by a bond for his maintenance entered into by his parishioners. Their annual subscriptions amounted to sixty-nine pounds sterling. Five years after his appointment to that parish, he was licensed by the bishop of London to preach the word of God in Low Leyton ; and the bishop’s license was the only credential which he had to produce. This undisturbed enjoyment of questionable rights may be attributed to the favour which the ecclesiastical dignitaries felt for a man who had made many valuable additions to the annals of the church. When far advanced in life, Strype was presented by Archbishop Tenison to the sinecure of Terring in Sussex. He was also appointed to the lectureship of Hackney, which he resigned in 1724. At Hackney he resided, in his old age, under the roof of Mr Harris, an apothecary, who was mar</p></body></text></TEI>
