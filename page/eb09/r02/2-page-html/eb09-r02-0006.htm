<p><span class="font1">body and large size the marine Reptiles form the nearest approach in nature to the modern creature of imagination,&nbsp;the “ Sea-Snake.” There is no question that they deviate&nbsp;more from the Lacertilian type than any of the other&nbsp;fossil forms mentioned above, especially in some of their&nbsp;cranial characters, which are more Ophidian. Hence&nbsp;Cope placed them into a distinct order of Reptiles,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pythonomorpha.</span><span class="font1"> Their body was covered with osseous&nbsp;scutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides Mosasaurus, remains of which have been known and described since the year 1766, a number of other genera from&nbsp;Cretaceous rocks of Europe and North America have been distinguished by Owen, Cope, Marsh, and Dollo : Liodon, Clidastes (fig. 2),&nbsp;Sironectes, Platecarpus, Baptosaurus, Diplotomodon, Edestosmmis,&nbsp;Holosaums, Lestosaurus, Tylosaurus, Pteryeollasaunis, Plioplatecarpus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order 9. Ophidia. Snakes. Vertebræ procœlous, extremely numerous ; no sacrum ; ribs single-headed. No&nbsp;chevron bones on any of the vertebrae. Not only the&nbsp;quadrate bone is movably articulated to the skull, but&nbsp;also the Suspensorium and the bones of the palatal&nbsp;maxillary apparatus are movable ; brain capsule entirely&nbsp;osseous. No quadrato-jugal arch. No foramen parietale.&nbsp;Rami of the mandible united by ligament. No trace of&nbsp;anterior extremities, and posterior only sometimes rudi-mentally indicated. Copulatory organs paired ; urinary&nbsp;bladder absent. Integuments folded into regularly arranged scales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the numerous recent genera see Snakes. Fossil forms are scarce, and do not appear before the Eocene (Laophis, Ralæophis,&nbsp;Raleryx).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order 10. Chelonia. Tortoises and Turtles. Cervical and dorsal vertebrae not numerous. The dorsal vertebrae&nbsp;and expanded ribs (with the exception of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis)</span><span class="font1"> are&nbsp;united into a carapace, the elements of which are immovable, and which is completed ventrally by a number of&nbsp;dermal bones, a true sternum being absent and replaced&nbsp;by a plastron. All the bones of the skull are suturally&nbsp;united, with the exception of the mandible and hyoid ;&nbsp;the dentary portion of the mandible consists of one bone&nbsp;only. Pectoral arch consisting of the scapula, with which&nbsp;the precoracoid is united, and the coracoid. Clavicles are&nbsp;represented by the anterior elements of the plastron. The&nbsp;pelvis consists of the usual bones, but is not attached to&nbsp;a sacrum. Two pairs of limbs. No teeth, these being&nbsp;replaced by horny sheaths of the jaws. Copulatory organ&nbsp;single. Integuments consisting of horny scutes covering&nbsp;the carapace, and of scales and tubercles on the soft&nbsp;parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the numerous living genera see Tortoises. Remains of extinct Tortoises are found from the Trias downwards, but they do&nbsp;not show any approximation to some other Reptilian type, or&nbsp;indicate a successive development. The most generalized type,&nbsp;Sphargis, is not older (according to present evidence) than some of&nbsp;the more specialized genera, its earliest representative being the&nbsp;remarkable Rrotostega from North-American Cretacean formations.&nbsp;Some of the Tertiary fossils exceeded in size the largest of living&nbsp;forms, suchasthe Himalayan Colossochelys, the German Macrochelys,&nbsp;the North-American Atlantochelys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A. C. G. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Anatomy of Reptiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As the principal features known of the anatomy of extinct Reptiles have been sufficiently noticed in the&nbsp;several separate articles devoted to them, this chapter will&nbsp;deal almost exclusively with the general structure of living&nbsp;forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Inasmuch as the class of Reptiles is one of the classes which make up that great primary zoological division&nbsp;known as “vertebrate animals,” they of course possess&nbsp;all those structural characters which are common to that&nbsp;division (see Vertebrata). They also possess in common&nbsp;a certain number of structures which they share with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Birds (see Sauropsida), and which will be indicated in our notice of the different sets, or systems, of organs which&nbsp;compose the bodies of the animals of which this article&nbsp;treats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every Reptile has a body made up of a head, a trunk, and a tail, though, as in some </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertilia</span><span class="font1"> and many </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">these regions are not marked off one from another by any&nbsp;constriction or noticeable alteration of diameter. The&nbsp;posterior aperture of the alimentary tube always marks&nbsp;the termination of the trunk and the commencement of&nbsp;the tail. In some kinds of Reptiles—as, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> in the genera&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbæna</span><span class="font1"> amongst the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertilia,</span><span class="font1"> and in&nbsp;such forms as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uropeltis</span><span class="font1"> amongst the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">—the whole body consists of little more than a very elongated trunk with a small head at one end and a short or&nbsp;even quite rudimentary tail at the other. A neck may&nbsp;be interposed between the head and the trunk; this, however, is generally short, as in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertilia</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">but may be more or much elongated, as in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">It was extraordinarily long in the extinct </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sauropterygia—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">like that of a Swan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The head may be very large, as in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font1"> and extinct </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyopterygia,</span><span class="font1"> or small, as in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sauropterygia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or very small indeed, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uropeltis.</span><span class="font1"> It&nbsp;always contains the organs of taste, smell, hearing, and&nbsp;sight, but there may be, as in many Lizards and all&nbsp;Snakes, no external indication of an ear, and the eyes are&nbsp;almost hidden by the skin in Snakes such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and certain Lizards such as Amphisbænians and some&nbsp;Skinks. The mouth may be very large, as in the Crocodiles,&nbsp;or very small, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The trunk may be exceedingly elongated, as in the instances just above referred to, or relatively very short&nbsp;and broad, as in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tail may vary in development from its rudimentary condition in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops</span><span class="font1"> to a length which exceeds that of the body several times, as in not a few </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertilia.</span><span class="font1"> Its&nbsp;distal end may be prehensile and form an important&nbsp;grasping organ, as in almost all Chamæleons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides these regions, there are generally two pairs of limbs,—one pectoral, the other pelvic,—though these may&nbsp;be altogether wanting as far as regards any external manifestation, as in all Ophidians and certain Lacertilians like&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophisaurus.</span><span class="font1"> Internal rudiments of limbs may,&nbsp;however, be present when there is no external indication&nbsp;of them, as will be pointed out when describing the appendicular skeleton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There may be but one pair of limbs, and these pectoral, as in the Lizard </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chirotes ;</span><span class="font1"> or there may be but one pair,&nbsp;which are pelvic, as in the Lizards </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudopus, Lialis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophiodes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pectoral and pelvic limbs are, as a rule, pretty equal in development, and they may be very much so, as&nbsp;in Chelonians and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sauropterygia.</span><span class="font1"> Both may be&nbsp;exceedingly small, as in many Lizards, such as a number of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Seincidæ,</span><span class="font1"> or both may be relatively large, as in Cheloni-ans. In no existing Reptile with four limbs does either&nbsp;pair very greatly exceed the other in length and size, but&nbsp;in extinct </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pinosauria</span><span class="font1"> the pelvic limbs were greatly in&nbsp;excess, while the reverse was the case with the extinct&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ornithosauria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The extremities never terminate in more than five distinct digits, and the number may be reduced to one in&nbsp;front, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodona,</span><span class="font1"> or one behind, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pibamus.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;extremities may end bluntly and be undivided, as in land&nbsp;and marine Chelonians, and as in the extinct </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyop-terygia</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sauropterygia.</span><span class="font1"> The pectoral and pelvic limbs&nbsp;are generally not very divergent in form and structure,&nbsp;and they may be wonderfully alike, as in the existing&nbsp;Tortoises and in the extinct </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyopterygia</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sauro-</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
