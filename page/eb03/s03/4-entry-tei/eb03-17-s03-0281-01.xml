the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cuttle-fish,</hi> a genus belonging to the order of vermes moluſca. There are eight brachia interſperſed on the interior side, with little round ſerrated cups, by the contraction of which the animal lays faſt hold of any thing. Besides theſe eight arms,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0288.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0282"/>
it has two tentacula longer than the arms, and frequently pedunculated. The mouth is situated in the centre of the arms, and is horny and hooked, like the bill of a hawk. The eyes are below the tentacula, towards the body of the animal. The body so fleſhy, and received into a ſheath as far as the breaſt. Their food are tunnies, ſprats, lobſters, and other ſhell-fiſh, With their arms and trunks they faſten themſelves, to reſiſt the motion of the waves. Their beak is like that of a parrot. The females are diſtinguiſhed by two paps. They copulate as the polypi do, by a mutual embrace, and lay their eggs upon ſea-weed and plants, in parcels like bunches of grapes. Immediately after they are laid they are white, and the males paſs over and impregnate them with a black liquor, after which they grow larger. On opening the egg, the embryo-cuttle is found alive. The males are very conſtant, accompany their females everywhere, face every danger in their defence, and rescue them intrepidly at the hazard of their own lives. The timorous females fly as ſoon as they ſee the males wounded. The noiſe of a cuttle-fiſh, on being dragged out of the water, reſembles the grunting of a hog. When the male is purſued by the ſea-wolf or other ravenous fiſh, he ſhuns the danger by ſtratagem. He ſquirts his black liquor, ſometimes to the quantity of a dram, by which the water becomes black as ink, under ſhelter of which he baffles the purſuit of his enemy. This ink or black liquor has been denominated by Mr le Cat a <hi rend="italic">ethiops animal·,</hi> and is reſerved in a particular gland. In its liquid ſtate it reſembles that of the choroid in man ; and would then communicate an indelible dye ; when dry, it might be taken for the product of the black liquor in negroes dried, and made a precipitate by ſpirit of wine. This aethiops anirhal in negroes as well as in the cuttle-fiſh, is more abundant after death than even during life. It may ſerve either for writing or printing ; in the former of which ways the Romans uſed it. It is ſaid to be an ingredient in the compoſition of Indian ink mixed with rice. There are five species.</p><p>1. The loligo, or great cuttle, with ſhort arms and long tentacula ; the lower part of the body rhomboid and pinnated, the upper thick and cylindric. They inhabit all our ſeas, where having blackened the water by the effuſion of their ink, they abſcond, and with their tail leap out of the water. They are gregarious and ſwift in their motions : they take their prey by means of their arms; and embracing it, bring it to their central south. They adhere to the rocks, when they wiſh to be quieſcent, by means of the concave diſcs that are placed along their arms.</p><p>2. The octopodia, with eight arms, connected at their bottom by a membrane. This is the polypus of Pliny, which he diſtinguiſhes from the loligo and ſepia by the want of the tail and tentacula. They inhabit our ſeas, but are moſt at home in the Mediterranean. In hot climates theſe are found of an enormous ſize. The Indians affirm, that ſome have been ſeen two fathoms broad over their centre, and each arm nine fathoms long. When the Indians navigate their little boats, they go in dread of them ; and left theſe animals ſhould fling their arms over and ſink them, they never ſail without an ax to cut them off. When uſed for food they are ſerved up red from their own liquor,</p><p>which from boiling with the addition of nitre becomes red. Barthol. ſays, upon cutting one of them open, ſo great a light broke forth, that at night, upon taking away the Candle, the whole houſe ſeemed to be in a blaze.</p><p>3. The media, or middle cuttle, with a long, ſlender, cylindric body ; tail finned, pointed, and carinated on each side ; two long tentacula ; the body almoſt tranſparent, green, but convertible into a dirty brown ; confirming the remark of Pliny*, that they change their colour through fear, adapting it, chameleon-like, to that of the place they are in. The eyes are large and ſmaragdine.</p><p>4. The ſepiola, or ſmall cuttle, with a ſhort body, rounded at the bottom, has a round fin on each side and two tentacula. They are taken off Flintſhire, but chiefly inhabit the Mediterranean.</p><p>5. The officinalis, or officinal cuttle, with an ovated body, has fins along the whole of the sides, almoſt meeting at the bottom; and two long tentacula. The body contains the bone, the cuttle-bone of the ſhops, which was formerly uſed as an abſorbent. The bones are frequently flung on all our ſhores ; the animal very rarely. The conger eels bite off their arms, or feet ; but they grow again, as does the lizard’s tail (Plin. ix. 29). They are preyed upon by the plaiſe. This fiſh emits (in common with the other species), when frighted or purſued, the black liquor which the ancients suppoſed darkened the circumambient wave, and concealed it from the enemy.</p><p>The endanger’d cuttle thus evades his fears,</p><p>And native hoards of fluid ſafety bears.</p><p>A pitchy ink peculiar glands ſupply,</p><p>Whoſe ſhades the ſharpeſt beam of light defy.</p><p>Purſu’d, he bids the fable fountains flow,</p><p>And, wrapt in clouds, eludes th’ impending foe.</p><p>The fiſh retreats unſeen, while ſelf-born night,</p><p>With pious ſhade befriends her parent’s flight.</p><p>The ancients ſometimes made uſe of it inſtead of ink. Perſius mentions the species in his deſcription of the. noblest student.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Jam liber·, et bicolor positus membrana capillis,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Inque manus charta, nodaſque venit arundo.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Tum querimur, craſſus calamo quod pendeat humor ;</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Nigra quod infuſa veneſcat</hi> ſepia <hi rend="italic">lympha.</hi></p><p>At length, his book he ſpreads, his pen he takes</p><p>His papers here in learned order lays,</p><p>And there his parchment’s ſmoother side diſplays.</p><p>But oh ! what croſſes wait on studious men !</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">cuttle's</hi> juice hangs clotted at our pen.</p><p><hi rend="italic">In all my life ſuch stuff I never knew,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">So gummy thick—</hi> Dilute it, it will do.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Nay, now 'tis water!</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Dryden.</hi></p><p>This animal was esteemed a delicacy by the ancients, and is eaten even at preſent by the Italians. Rondeletius gives us two receipts for the dressing, which may be continued to this day. Athenaeus alſo leaves us the method of making an antique cuttle-fiſh ſauſage ; and we learn from Ariſtotle, that thoſe animals are in highest ſeaſon when pregnant.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
