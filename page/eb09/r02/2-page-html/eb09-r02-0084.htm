<p><span class="font1">the inroads of European civilization, and especially of English sportsmen. It feeds exclusively upon leaves and&nbsp;branches of bushes and small trees, and chiefly frequents&nbsp;the sides of wood-clad rugged hills. Specimens in which the&nbsp;posterior horn has attained a length as great as or greater&nbsp;than the anterior have been separated under the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. keitloa,</span><span class="font1"> but the characters of these appendages are too&nbsp;variable to found specific distinctions upon. The twohorned African rhinoceros is far more rarely seen in menageries in Europe than either of the three Indian species,&nbsp;but one has lived in the gardens of the London Zoological&nbsp;Society since 1868. Excellent figures from life of this and&nbsp;the other species are published in the ninth volume of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions</span><span class="font1"> of the society, from which the accompanying&nbsp;woodcuts are reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. BurchelΓs or the Square-Mouthed Rhinoceros (/?.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">simus),</span><span class="font1"> sometimes called the White Rhinoceros, though the&nbsp;colour (dark-slate) is not materially different from that of&nbsp;the last species, is the largest of the whole group, and&nbsp;differs from all the others in having a square truncated&nbsp;upper lip and a wide, shallow, spatulate symphysis to the&nbsp;lower jaw. In conformity with the structure of the&nbsp;mouth, this species lives entirely by browsing on grass,&nbsp;and is therefore more partial to open countries or districts&nbsp;where there are broad grassy valleys between the tracts&nbsp;of bush. It is only found in Africa south of the Zambesi,&nbsp;and of late years has become extremely scarce, owing to&nbsp;the persecutions of sportsmen ; indeed, the time of its&nbsp;complete extinction cannot be far off. No specimen of&nbsp;this species has ever been brought alive to Europe. Mr&nbsp;Γ. C. Selous gives the following description of its habits&nbsp;from extensive personal observation :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The square-mouthed rhinoceros is a huge ungainly-looking beast, with a disproportionately large head, a large male standing&nbsp;6 feet 6 inches at the shoulder. Like elephants and buffaloes they&nbsp;lie asleep during the heat of the day, and feed during the night and&nbsp;in the cool hours of early morning and evening. Their sight is&nbsp;very bad ; but they are quick of hearing, and their scent is very&nbsp;keen ; they are, too, often accompanied by rhinoceros birds, which,&nbsp;by running about their heads, flapping their wings, and screeching&nbsp;at the same time, frequently give them notice of the approach of&nbsp;danger. When disturbed they go off at a swift trot, which soon&nbsp;leaves all pursuit from a man on foot far behind ; but if chased by&nbsp;a horseman they break into a gallop, which they can keep up for&nbsp;some distance. However, although they run very swiftly, when&nbsp;their size and heavy build is considered, they are no match for an&nbsp;average good horse. They are, as a rule, very easy to shoot on&nbsp;horseback, as, if one gallops a little in front of and on one side of&nbsp;them, they will hold their course, and come sailing past, offering a&nbsp;magnificent broadside shot, while under similar circumstances a&nbsp;prehensile-lipped rhinoceros will usually swerve away in such a&nbsp;manner as only to present his hind-quarters for a shot. When&nbsp;either walking or running, the square-mouthed rhinoceros holds&nbsp;its head very low, its nose nearly touching the ground. When&nbsp;a small calf accompanies its mother, it always runs in front&nbsp;and she appears to guide it by holding the point of her horn&nbsp;upon the little animal’s rump ; and it is perfectly wonderful&nbsp;to note how in all sudden changes of pace, from a trot to&nbsp;a gallop or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa,</span><span class="font0"> the same position is always exactly maintained. During the autumn and winter months (i.e., from March&nbsp;to August) the square-mouthed rhinoceros is usually very fat ; and&nbsp;its meat is then most excellent, being something like beef, but yet&nbsp;having a peculiar flavour of its own. The part in greatest favour&nbsp;among hunters is the hump, which, if cut off whole and roasted&nbsp;just as it is in the skin, in a hole dug in the ground, would, I&nbsp;think, be difficult to match either for juiciness or flavour.”—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Proe.&nbsp;Zook Soc.,</span><span class="font0"> 1881, p. 726</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Extinct Species of Rhinoceros.—</span><span class="font0">The family once contained many more species, which were far more widely distributed than at&nbsp;present. As in similar cases, our knowledge of them is as yet but&nbsp;fragmentary, though constantly augmenting, especially by discoveries made in the Tertiary deposits of North America, a&nbsp;region in which they all died out long ago, though, judging&nbsp;from the evidence at present available, this was the locality in&nbsp;which they first made their appearance. In the Eocene formations&nbsp;of the Rocky Mountains are found the remains of numerous&nbsp;modifications of the primitive Perissodactyle type, from which the&nbsp;rhinoceroses may have originated. In the Lower Miocene a form&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hyraeodxn</span><span class="font0"> by Leidy already presented many of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">characteristics of the family, though, especially as regards the dentition, in a very generalized condition. The next stage of&nbsp;specialization is represented by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aeeratheriιιm,</span><span class="font0"> found in the Miocene&nbsp;of both Europe and America, which still, like the last, shows no&nbsp;sign of having possessed a nasal horn. It differed from the&nbsp;existing species also in having four toes on the anterior limb,&nbsp;instead of only three. At the same period forms occurred </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ODixera-theriwrn,</span><span class="font0"> Marsh) which show a pair of lateral tubercles on the&nbsp;nasal bones, apparently supporting horns side by side. These, however, soon disappeared and gave way in the Old World to species&nbsp;with one or two horns in the median line, a stage of development&nbsp;which apparently was never reached in America. In the Pliocene&nbsp;and Pleistocene of Europe and Asia numerous modifications of the&nbsp;existing types have been found. The present African two-horned&nbsp;type was represented in the Early Pliocene of Greece by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. pachy-gηathus,</span><span class="font0"> the skeleton of which is described by Gaudryas intermediate&nbsp;between the existing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. bieornis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. simus.</span><span class="font0"> As many as three&nbsp;species were inhabitants of the British Isles, of which the best&nbsp;known is the Tichorhine or Woolly Rhinoceros, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. aηtiquitatis</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Blumenbach, nearly whole carcases of which, with the thick woolly&nbsp;external covering, have been discovered associated with those of&nbsp;the mammoth, preserved in the frozen soil of the north of Siberia,&nbsp;and which, in common with some other extinct species, had a solid&nbsp;median wall of bone supporting the nasals, from which it is inferred that the horns were of a size and weight surpassing that of&nbsp;the modern species. The one-horned Indian type was well represented under several modifications (A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sivalensis, palæindicus,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. ),&nbsp;in the Pliocene deposits of the sub-Himalayan region, and forms&nbsp;more allied to the African bicorn species have also been found in&nbsp;India. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. schleirmacheri</span><span class="font0"> of the late European Miocenes was in&nbsp;some respects allied to the existing Sumatran rhinoceros, possessing&nbsp;incisor teeth and two horns.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;( W. H. F. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHODE ISLAND, one of the six New England States, and the smallest in extent of all the States, is one of the&nbsp;original thirteen which formed the American Union. It&nbsp;has an actual land area of only l054<sup>,</sup>6 square miles, the&nbsp;waters of Narragansett Bay, its chief physical feature,&nbsp;comprising an additional area of not far from 360 square&nbsp;miles. It lies between 41° 18'</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> and 42° 3' N. lat., and&nbsp;71° 6' and 71° 55' W. long., its greatest length from north&nbsp;to south being about 48 miles, and its greatest width from&nbsp;east to west about 35 miles. It is shut in on the east and&nbsp;north by Massachusetts, and on the west by Connecticut,&nbsp;while its southern shores are washed by the Atlantic&nbsp;Ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Physical Characteristics.—</span><span class="font1">The geological formation of the western portion of the State is chiefly that of the&nbsp;Montalban gneiss, which characterizes a great part of&nbsp;southern New England (see geological sketch map of New&nbsp;England, in article New Hampshire, vol. xvii. p. 391),&nbsp;but under the bay and to the east of it is an extensive&nbsp;coal-bearing formation, from which at different times&nbsp;upwards of 750,000 tons of coal have been taken. The&nbsp;only other important deposit is one of magnetic oxide of&nbsp;iron. The climate of Rhode Island, though variable,&nbsp;differs from that of the exposed coast of Massachusetts&nbsp;Bay in the absence of harassing east winds ; while the&nbsp;proximity of the southern parts of the State (Newport&nbsp;and vicinity) to the Gulf Stream results in an atmosphere&nbsp;of unusual warmth and moisture, and at the same time&nbsp;comparatively equable. No great extremes, either of heat&nbsp;or of cold, are experienced in the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Population.—</span><span class="font0">The earliest authentic estimate of population is that of 7181 in 1708. The War of Independence (1775-83) had&nbsp;the effect of reducing it from 59,707 in 1774 to 52,347 in 1782.&nbsp;The subsequent United States censuses show steady gains, as&nbsp;follows 1790, 68,825 ; 1800, 69,122 ; 1810, 77,031 ; 1820,&nbsp;83,059; 1830, 97,210; 1840, 108,830; 1850, 147,545; 1860,&nbsp;174,620; 1870, 217,353; 1880, 276,531 (143,501 males, 133,030&nbsp;females) ; while a State census in 1885 (advance returns) gives&nbsp;304,419. The census of 1880 showed Rhode Island to be surpassed&nbsp;in aggregate population by all except Colorado, Oregon, Delaware,&nbsp;and Nevada, but in density it was surpassed by none (254'9 per&nbsp;square mile, the average for the whole United States being 13’92).&nbsp;By the same census the number of persons of foreign birth was&nbsp;73,993, or 26∙8 percent., no State east of Lake Michigan showing</span></p>
