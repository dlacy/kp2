<p><span class="font0">At this point we have to note that the Hellenic element in the state had definitely gained the upper hand before the end&nbsp;of the 6th century, so that henceforward the Empire might&nbsp;be described as Greek. Justinian’s mother-tongue was Latin,&nbsp;and he was devoted to the Latin traditions of Rome, but even&nbsp;he found it necessary to publish his later laws in Greek, and&nbsp;from his reign Greek was the official language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many of the Latin official terms were already represented by Greek equivalents </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ύπατος=consul, ίπαρχος = praefectus,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c.), but they&nbsp;were preserved in great numbers, transliterated and oftcn corrupted&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g. κόμης, μάγιστρος, άσηκρήτης = a Sccretis, KayKtWaptGs, πραιπόσιτος,&nbsp;κνίστωρ— quaestor, σάκρον παλάτιον, όφφίκων, όψίκιον = Obsequium). *Ρηξ,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">rex, was always used of barbarian potentates, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">βασιλεύς</span><span class="font0"> being reserved&nbsp;as = the emperor (but also applied to the.Persian king). Inmilitary&nbsp;drill many Latin words of command continued to be used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is to be noted that the year 630 marks the beginning of a period of literary (and artistic) sterility in the Greek world (see&nbsp;Greek Literature, section </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Byzantine).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the rise of Islam (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Caliphate; Mahomet)</span><span class="font0"> two universal religions, for the first time, stood face to face, each&nbsp;aspiring to win the universe. The struggle therefore which&nbsp;then began was not only a new phase of the “ Eternal Question,”&nbsp;the strife between Europe and Asia, but was one in which the&nbsp;religious element was fundamental. Fire-worship was only a&nbsp;national religion and did not present the danger of Islam.&nbsp;The creation of the political power of the Mahommedans was&nbsp;so sudden that it took the world by surprise. Bostra, the&nbsp;fortress of Roman Arabia, fell into their hands in 634, and&nbsp;before the death of Heraclius in 641 they had conquered&nbsp;Syria and all Egypt, except Alexandria, which opened its gates&nbsp;to them in 643. The religious alienation of the Syrian and&nbsp;Egyptian peoples from Constantinople, expressing as it did a&nbsp;national sentiment antagonistic to the Greeks, was an important&nbsp;political factor in the Mahommedan (as in the previous Persian)&nbsp;conquest. Thus the Mahommedans definitely cut the Empire&nbsp;short in the East, as the Germans had cut it short in the West;&nbsp;Egypt was never recovered, Syria only for short periods and&nbsp;partially, while the integrity of Asia Minor was constantly&nbsp;menaced and Cilicia occupied for many generations. By their&nbsp;conquest of Persia the Caliphs succeeded to the position of&nbsp;the Sassanids; this led to the conquest of Armenia </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font0"> 654);&nbsp;while, in the West, Africa was occupied in 647 (though the conquest was not completed till the capture of Carthage and other&nbsp;strong places in 698). Thus within twenty years from the&nbsp;first attack the Empire was girt about by the new aggressive&nbsp;power from the precincts of the Caucasus to the western&nbsp;Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fortunately Constans II., grandson of Heraclius, was a man of eminent ability and firmness. The state owed to him&nbsp;the preservation of Asia Minor, and the creation of a powerful&nbsp;fleet (see below) which protected the Aegean coasts and islands&nbsp;against the naval power which the Mahommedans created.&nbsp;He was responsible for completing a new, efficient military&nbsp;organization, which determined the lines of the administrative&nbsp;reforms of Leo III. (see below). In his last years he turned&nbsp;his eyes to Italy and Africa. He dreamed of restoring Old&nbsp;Rome as the centre of the Empire. But he did not succeed&nbsp;in recovering south Italy from the Lombards (Duchy of&nbsp;Beneventum), and having visited Rome he took up his residence&nbsp;in Syracuse, where he was assassinated, having lost two fleets&nbsp;which he sent against the Arabs of Africa. The strain lasted&nbsp;for another fifty years. Constantinople sustained two great&nbsp;sieges, which stand out as crises, for, if in either case the enemy&nbsp;had been successful, the Empire was doomed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first siege was in 673-77, under the caliph Moawiya; his fleet blockaded the capital lor five years, but all its efforts were&nbsp;frustrated by the able precautions of Constantine IV.; “Greek&nbsp;fire” (see below) played an important part in the defence; and&nbsp;the armada was annihilated on tne voyage back to Syria by storms&nbsp;and the Roman fleet. The second crisis was at the accession of&nbsp;Leo III., when the city was besieged by land and sea by Suleiman&nbsp;for a year (717-18), and Leo’s brilliant defence, again aided by&nbsp;Greek fire, saved Europe. This crisis marks the highest point of&nbsp;Mahommedan aggression, which never again caused the Empire to&nbsp;tremble for its existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Heraclian dynasty, which had fallen on evil times and rendered inestimable services to the Empire, came to an end&nbsp;in anarchy, which was terminated by the elevation of the&nbsp;Syrian (commonly called Isaurian) Leo III., whose rcign&nbsp;opens a new period. His reforming hand was active in every&nbsp;sphere of government, but the ill-fame which he won by his&nbsp;iconoclastic policy obscured in the memory of posterity the&nbsp;capital importance of his work. His provincial organization&nbsp;was revolutionary, and his legislation departed from the&nbsp;Roman tradition (see below). From his reign to the middle&nbsp;of the 10th century the continuous warfare by land with the&nbsp;Caliphs consisted of marauding expeditions of each power&nbsp;into the other’s territory, captures of fortresses, guerilla fighting, but no great conquests or decisive battles. The efficiency&nbsp;of the army was carefully maintained, but the neglect of&nbsp;the navy led to the losses of Crete (conquered by Moslem&nbsp;adventurers from Spain 826) and Sicily (conquered by the&nbsp;Saracens of Africa), Panormus taken 832, Syracuse 878 (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sicily).</span><span class="font0"> ^The Africans also made temporary conquests,&nbsp;including Bari, in south Italy. This period saw the loss ol&nbsp;the exarchate of Ravenna to the Lombards (750), the&nbsp;expansion of the Frankish power under Pippin and Charlemagne in Italy, and in close connexion therewith the loss of&nbsp;Old Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The inconoclast emperors pursued a moderate foreign policy, consolidating the Empire within its contracted limits.; but&nbsp;under the “ Macedonian ” dynasty, which was of Armenian&nbsp;descent, it again expanded and became the strongest ' power&nbsp;in Europe. The 9th century also witnessed a revival of&nbsp;learning and culture which had been in eclipse for 200 years.&nbsp;The reign of Basil I. was marked by an energetic policy in&nbsp;south Italy, where his forces co-operated with the western&nbsp;emperor Louis II. The Saracens were expelled from their&nbsp;strongholds, Bari recovered, Calabria saved, and the new&nbsp;province (Theme) of Longibardia formed. This secured the&nbsp;entrance to the Adriatic, and the increase of dominion here&nbsp;at the expense of the Lombards was a compensation for the&nbsp;loss of Sicily. Leo VI. did much for reorganizing the navy,&nbsp;but his reign was not fortunate; Saracen pirates plundered&nbsp;freely in the Aegean and, under the able renegade Leo of&nbsp;Tripolis, captured Thessalonica and carried off countless&nbsp;captives (904). But a great tide of success began fifty years&nbsp;later. Nicephorus Phocas won back Crete (961) as general&nbsp;of Romanus II., and then as emperor recovered Cilicia and&nbsp;North Syria (with Antioch) 968. Cyprus was also recovered.&nbsp;The tide flowed on under his equally able successor, John&nbsp;Zimisces (of Armenian race) and under Basil II.; these reigns&nbsp;mark the decisive victory of the Empire in the long struggle&nbsp;with the Saracens, whose empire had been broken up into&nbsp;separate states. The eastern frontier was strengthened by&nbsp;the active policy of Basil II. in Armenia, which was more&nbsp;fully incorporated in the Empire under Constantine IX.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The reign of Basil II. marks the culmination of the power of the Eastern Empire, for it also witnessed the triumphant&nbsp;conclusion of another conflict which had lasted almost as&nbsp;long. In the reign of Constantine IV. the Bulgarians (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bulgaria)</span><span class="font0"> had founded a kingdom in Lower Mocsia, reducing&nbsp;the Slavonic tribes who had occupied the country, but less&nbsp;than two centuries sufficed to assimilate the conquerors to&nbsp;the conquered, and to give Bulgaria the character of a Slavonic&nbsp;state. The reign of Constantine V. was marked by continuous&nbsp;war with this enemy, and Nicephorus I. lost his life in a&nbsp;Bulgarian campaign. This disaster was followed up by Prince&nbsp;Krum, who besieged Constantinople in 815. His death was&nbsp;followed by a long peace. Prince Boris was converted to&nbsp;Christianity (reigm of Michael III.); a metropolitan see of&nbsp;Bulgaria was founded, dependent on the patriarch of Constantinople; and the &quot;civilization of the Bulgarians, and&nbsp;beginnings of their literature, were entirely under Byzantine&nbsp;influence. The conversion was contemporary with the work&nbsp;of the two missionaries Cyril and Methodius, who (while the&nbsp;field of their personal activity was in Great Moravia and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
