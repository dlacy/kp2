<p><span class="font1">layer of cubical cells, which are continuous near the anterior border with the cells of the peritoneum. Deep to these is the&nbsp;ovarian stroma, composed of fibrous tissue, and embedded&nbsp;in it are numerous nests of epithelial cells, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Graafian follicles,</span><span class="font1"> in various stages of development. During the childbearing period of life some of these will be nearing the ripe&nbsp;condition, and if one such be looked at it will be seen to contain one large cell, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ovum,</span><span class="font1"> surrounded by a mass of small&nbsp;cells forming the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">discus proligerus.</span><span class="font1"> At one point this is continuous with a layer of cells called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stratum granulosum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which lines the outer wall of the follicle, but elsewhere the two&nbsp;layers are separated hy fluid, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">liquor folliculi.</span><span class="font1"> When the&nbsp;follicle bursts, as it does in time, the ovum escapes on to the&nbsp;surface of the ovary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fallopian tubes</span><span class="font1"> receive the ova and carry them to the uterus. That end of each which h'es in front of the ovary is&nbsp;called the fimbriated extremity, and has a number of fringes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(fimbriae)</span><span class="font1"> hanging from it; one of the largest of these is the&nbsp;ovarian fimbria and is attached to the upper or tubal pole of&nbsp;the ovary. The smalI opening among the fimbriae by which&nbsp;the tube communicates with the peritoneal cavity is known as&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ostium abdominale,</span><span class="font1"> and from this the lumen of the tube&nbsp;runs from four to four and a half inches, until it opens into the&nbsp;cavity of the uterus by an extremely small opening. In the&nbsp;accompanying figure (fig. 6) the Fallopian tube and ovary&nbsp;are pulled out from the uterus; this, as has been explained,&nbsp;is not the position of the ovary in the living body, nor is it&nbsp;of the tube, the outer half of which lies folded on the front&nbsp;and inner surface of the ovary. Tbe Fallopian tubes, like many&nbsp;other tubes in the body, are made chiefly of iinstriped muscle,&nbsp;the outer layer of which is longitudinal and the inner circular;&nbsp;deep to this are the submucous and mucous coats, the latter&nbsp;being lined with ciliated epithelium (see Epithelial Tissues),&nbsp;and thrown into longitudinal pleats. . Superficially the tube&nbsp;is covered by a serous coat of peritoneum. The calibre&nbsp;gradually contracts from the peritoneal to the uterine&nbsp;opening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uterus</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">womb</span><span class="font1"> is a pear-shaped, very thick-walled, muscular bag, lying in the pelvis between the bladder and&nbsp;rectum. In the non-pregnant condition it is about three&nbsp;inches long and two in its broadest part, which is above. The&nbsp;upper half or body of the uterus is somewhat triangular with&nbsp;its base upward, and has an anterior surface which is moderately&nbsp;flat, and a posterior convex. The lower half is the neck or&nbsp;cervix and is cylindrical; it projects into the anterior wall&nbsp;of the vagina, into the cavity of which it opens by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">os uteri&nbsp;externum.</span><span class="font1"> This opening in a uterus which has never been&nbsp;pregnant is a narrow transverse slit, rarely a circular ‘aperture,&nbsp;but in those uteri in which pregnancy has occurred the slit is&nbsp;much wider and its Iips are thickened and gaping and often&nbsp;scarred. Thc interior of the body of the uterus shows a comparatively small triangular cavity (see fig. 6, B), the anterior&nbsp;and posterior walls of which are in contact. The base of the&nbsp;triangle is upward, and at each lateral angle one of the Fallopian&nbsp;tubes opens. The apex leads into the canal of the cervix,&nbsp;but between the two there is a slight constriction known as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">os uteri internum.</span><span class="font1"> The canal of the cervix is about an inch&nbsp;long, and is spindle-shaped when looked at from in front;&nbsp;its anterior and posterior walls are in contact, and its lining&nbsp;mucous membrane is raised into a pattern which, from its&nbsp;likeness to a cypress twig, is called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arbor vitae.</span><span class="font1"> This arrangement is obliterated after the first pregnancy. On making&nbsp;a mesial vertical section of the uterus the cavity is seen as a&nbsp;mere slit which is bent about its middle to form an angle the&nbsp;opening of which is forward. A normal uterus is therefore&nbsp;bent forward on itself, or anteflexed. In addition to this, its&nbsp;long axis forms a marked angle with that of the vagina, so that&nbsp;the whole uterus is bent forward or anteverted. As a rule,&nbsp;in adults the uterus is more or less on one side of the mesial&nbsp;plane of the body. From each side of the uterus the peritoneum&nbsp;is reflected outward, as a two-layered sheet, to the side wall&nbsp;of the pelvis; this is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">broad ligament,</span><span class="font1"> and between its layers&nbsp;lie several structures of importance. Above, there is thc Fallopian tube, already described; below and in front is the round&nbsp;ligament; behind, the ovary projects backward, and just above&nbsp;this, when the broad. ligament is&nbsp;stretched out as in fig. 6, are the&nbsp;epoöphoron and paroophoron with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">duct of Gärtner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">round ligament</span><span class="font1"> is a cord of unstriped muscle which runs from the lateral angle of its own side of the&nbsp;uterus forward to the internal abdominal&nbsp;ring, and so through the inguinal canal&nbsp;to the upper part of the labium majus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">epoophoron </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">qt</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> parovarium</span><span class="font1"> is a collection of short tubes which radiate&nbsp;from the upper border of the ovary when&nbsp;the hroad ligament is pulled out as in&nbsp;fig. 6. It is best seen in very young&nbsp;children and represents the vasa effer-entia in the male. Near the ovary the&nbsp;tubes are closed, but nearer the Fal-Iopian tube they open into another&nbsp;tube which is nearly at right angles to&nbsp;them, and which runs toward the&nbsp;uterus, though in the human subject&nbsp;it is generally lost before reaching that organ. It is known&nbsp;as the duet of Gartner, and is the homologue of the male&nbsp;epididymis and vas deferens. Some of the outermost tubules&nbsp;of the epoöphoron are sometimes distended to form hydatids.&nbsp;Nearer the uterus than the epoöphoron a few scattered tubules&nbsp;are occasionally found which are looked upon as the homologue&nbsp;of the organ of Giraldès in the male, and are known as the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paroophoron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tbe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vagina</span><span class="font1"> is a dilatable muscular passage, lined with mucous membrane, which leads from the uterus to the external generative organs; its direction is, from the uterus, downward and&nbsp;forward, and its anterior and posterior walls are in contact, so&nbsp;that in a horizontal section it appears as a transverse slit. As&nbsp;the orifice is neared the slit becomes H-shaped. Owing to the&nbsp;fact that the neck of the uterus enters the vagina from in front,&nbsp;the anterior wall of that tube is only about 2j in., while the&nbsp;posterior is 3 j. The mucous membrane is raised into a series of&nbsp;transverse folds or rugae, and between it and the muscular wall&nbsp;are plexuses of veins forming erectile tissue. The relation of the&nbsp;vagina to the peritoneum is noticed under Coelum and Serous&nbsp;Membranes.</span></p>
