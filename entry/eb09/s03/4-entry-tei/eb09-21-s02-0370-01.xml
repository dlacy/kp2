Towards the end of the Middle Ages the Danish influence shows an immense increase, which marks the gradual decline of Norwegian literature, until at last Norwegian as literary language is completely supplanted by Danish. During the 15th century Norway has hardly any literature except charters, and as early as the end of that century by far the greatest number of these are written in almost pure Danish. In the 16th century, again, charters written in Norwegian occur only as rare exceptions, and from the Reformation onward, when the Bible and the old laws were translated into Danish, not into Norwegian, Danish was not only the undisputed literary language of Norway, but also the colloquial language of dwellers in towns and of those who had learned to read. For the rise in recent times of a new Norwegian language, employed in literature and spoken by the educated classes, see p. 373.</p><p>Dialectical differences, as above hinted, occur in great number in the Norwegian charters of the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries. Especially marked is the difference between the language of western Norway, which, in many respects, shows a development parallel to that of Icelandic, and the language of eastern Norway, which exhibits still more striking correspondences with contemporary Old Swedish. The most remarkable characteristics of the eastern dialects of this epoch are the following :— <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is changed into <hi rend="italic">æ</hi> in the pronouns <hi rend="italic">pænn,</hi> this, <hi rend="italic">pæt,</hi> that, and the particle <hi rend="italic">pær,</hi> there (the latter as early as the 13th century), and later on (in the 14th century) also in terminations after a long root syllable,—as <hi rend="italic">sendæ,</hi> to send, <hi rend="italic">høyrae,</hi> to hear (but <hi rend="italic">gera,</hi> to do, <hi rend="italic">vita,</hi> to know) ; <hi rend="italic">ia</hi> passes (as in Old Swedish and Old Danish) into <hi rend="italic">iæ—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">hiærta</hi> (Icel. <hi rend="italic">hjarta),</hi> heart ; <hi rend="italic">y</hi> sometimes passes into <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> before <hi rend="italic">r, l,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">hiurder,</hi> shepherd, <hi rend="italic">lykiul,</hi> key, instead of <hi rend="italic">hyrðir, lykyl</hi> (older still, <hi rend="italic">hirðir, lykill</hi>; see above, p. 369) ; final <hi rend="italic">-r</hi> after a consonant often passes into <hi rend="italic">-ar,</hi> sometimes only into <hi rend="italic">-a</hi>,—as <hi rend="italic">prestar (prestr),</hi> priest, <hi rend="italic">bøkar (bøkr),</hi> books, dat. sing, <hi rend="italic">brøða (brøðr),</hi> (to a) brother ; <hi rend="italic">tl</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">tsl, sl,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">lisla (litla),</hi> (the) little, the name <hi rend="italic">Atsle, Asle (Atle) ; rs</hi> gives a “thick” <hi rend="italic">s</hi>-sound (written <hi rend="italic">ls),—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">Bærdols,</hi> genitive of the name <hi rend="italic">Bergpórr ; nd, ld</hi> are assimilated into <hi rend="italic">nn, ll,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">bann (band),</hi> band, the local name <hi rend="italic">Westfoll (Vestfold)</hi>; and (as far back as the 13th century) traces occur of the vowel assimilation, “ tiljævning,” that is so highly characteristic of the modern Norwegian dialects,—as <hi rend="italic">voko, vuku,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">vaku</hi>, (Icel. <hi rend="italic">voko, ∙u),</hi> accusative singular of <hi rend="italic">vaka,</hi> wake, <hi rend="italic">mykyll</hi> for <hi rend="italic">mykill,</hi> much. On the other hand, as characteristics of the western dialects may be noted the following :—final <hi rend="italic">-r</hi> after a consonant passes into <hi rend="italic">-ur, -or,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">vetur (vetr),</hi> winter, <hi rend="italic">rettur (réttr),</hi> right, <hi rend="italic">aftor (aftr),</hi> again ; <hi rend="italic">sl</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">tl,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">sytlla (sysla),</hi> charge ; <hi rend="italic">hv</hi> is changed into <hi rend="italic">kv</hi> also in pronouns, —as <hi rend="italic">kver</hi> <hi rend="italic">(hverr),</hi> who, <hi rend="italic">kvassu (hversu),</hi> how.</p><p>This splitting of the language into dialects seems to have continued to gain ground, probably with greater rapidity as a Norwegian literary language no longer existed. Thus it is very likely that the present dialectical division was in all essentials accom-</p><p>plished about the year 1600 ; for, judging from the first work on Norwegian dialectology,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> Chr. Jensen's <hi rend="italic">Norsk dictionarium tiler glosebog,</hi> 1646. </note> the Søndfjord (Western Norway) dialect at least possessed at that time most of its present features. A little clog-calendar of the year 1644 seems to prove the same regarding the Valders (Southern Norway) dialect. How far the Old Norwegian dialects on the Faroes, in Ireland and Scotland, on the Scottish islands, and on the Isle of Man differed from the mother-tongue it is impossible to decide, on account of the few remnants of these dialects which exist apart from local names, viz., some charters (from the beginning of the 15th century onward) from the Faroes<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> See <hi rend="italic">Diplomatarium Norvegicum</hi> vol. i. n. 589 and 591. </note> and Orkneys,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> See <hi rend="italic">Dipl.

A systematic treatise on Old Norwegian grammar is still wanting, with the exception of a short work by the Danish scholar N. M.

The oldest but also the most meagre sources of our knowledge of Old Swedish are those words, almost exclusively personal names (nearly one hundred), which were introduced into the Russian language at the foundation of the Russian realm by Swedes (in 862), and which are for the most part somewhat influenced by Russian phonetic laws, preserved in two Russian documents of the years 912 and 945,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="9"> See V.

For the most part they are tombstones or monuments in memory of deceased relatives, rarely public notices. Their form is often metrical, in part at least. Most of them are anonymous, in so far that we do not know the name of the engraver, though, as a rule, the name of the man who ordered them is recorded. Of the engravers named, about seventy in number, the three most productive are Ubir, Bali, and Asmundr Karasun, all three principally working in Upland ; the first-mentioned name is signed on about forty, the others on nearly twenty stones each. These inscriptions vary very much in age, belonging to all centuries of Old Swedish, but by far the greatest number of them date from the 11th and 12th centuries. From heathen times—as well as from the last two centuries of the Middle Ages—we have comparatively few. The oldest are probably the Ingelstad inscription in Östergötland, and the Gursten one found in tho north of Smâland.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="10"> Kindly communicated by Prof. S. Bugge. </note> The rune stone from Rök in Östergötland probably dates from the first half of the 10th century. Its inscription surpasses all the others both in length (more than one hundred and fifty words) and in the importance of its contents, which are equally interesting as regards philology and the history of culture ; it is a fragment (partly in metrical form) of an Old Swedish heroic tale.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="11"> See S. Bugge, “Tolkning af runeindskriften pa Rökstenen" <hi rend="italic">(Antiqvarisk Tidskrift f.

Somewhat later are the inscriptions cut by Ubir, and about contemporary with them, viz., from the beginning of the 12th century, is the remarkable inscription on the door-ring of tho church of Forsa in Helsingland, containing tho oldest Scandinavian statute<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="12"> See S. Bugge, <hi rend="italic">Runeindskriften paa ringen i Forsa Kirke,</hi> 1877. </note> now preserved, as well as other inscriptions from the same province, written in a particular variety of the common runic alphabet, the so-called “ staflösa ” (staffless, without the perpendicular staff) runes, as tho long genealogical inscription on the Malstad-stone.

Of the runic literature hardly anything has been preserved to our days,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="14"> See L. F. Leffler, “ Fomsvenska runhandskrifter ” <hi rend="italic">(Nordisk Tidskrift,</hi> 1879). </note> while the literature in the Latin letters is both in quality and extent incomparably inferior to Old Icelandic, though it, at least in quantity, considerably surpasses Old Norwegian. In age, however, it is inferior to both of them, beginning only in the 13th century. The oldest of the extant manuscripts is a codex of the <hi rend="italic">Older Vestgötalaw</hi> (Cod. Holm. B 59), written about the year 1290, and philologically of the greatest importance. Not much later is a codex of the <hi rend="italic">Uplandslaw</hi> (Cod. Ups. 12) of the year 1300.

The very numerous Old Swedish charters, from 1343 downwards, are also of great importance.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="15"> The Old Swedish monuments are for the most part published in the following collections :— <hi rend="italic">Svenska fοrnskriftsallskapets samlingar,</hi> 84 parts, 1844-84 ; C.

The first part of the inscription of the Rök-stone running thus—</p><p>AFT UAMUP STANTA RUNA <hi rend="italic">R</hi> PA <hi rend="italic">R</hi> IN UARIN FAPI FAPI <hi rend="italic">R</hi> AFT FAIKIAN SUNU,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="16"> In memory of Wámód these runes stand; and Warenn, his father, wrote them in memory of his son, (by destiny) condemned to death. </note> and probably pronounced—</p><p>æft Wámód standa runar poeR ; en Warenn faoe faoeR æft fæighian sunu,</p><p>would, no doubt, have had the same form in contemporary Icelandic, except the last word, which would probably have had the less original form <hi rend="italic">sun.</hi> The formal changes of the Swedish language during this period are, generally speaking, such as appear about the same time in all the members of the group,—as the change of soft R into common <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (the Rök-stone <hi rend="italic">runaR,</hi> later <hi rend="italic">r</hi> unα <hi rend="italic">r</hi>, runes ; this appeared earliest after dental consonants, later after an accented vowel), and the change of sp into <hi rend="italic">st</hi> (in the 10th century <hi rend="italic">raispi,</hi> later <hi rend="italic">reisti,</hi> raised); or they are, at least, common to it with Norwegian, —as the dropping of <hi rend="italic">h</hi> before <hi rend="italic">l, n,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (in the 10th century <hi rend="italic">hraur,</hi> younger <hi rend="italic">rör</hi>, cairn), and the changing of nasal vowels (the long ones latest) into non-nasalized. A very old specific Swedish characteristic, however, is the splitting up of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> into <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> before <hi rend="italic">ngw, nkw,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">siunga,</hi> to sing, <hi rend="italic">siunka,</hi> to sink, from primitive Scandinavian <hi rend="italic">singwan, sinkwan</hi> (Icel.-Norw. <hi rend="italic">syngva, søkkva).</hi> But the case is altogether different during what we may call the classical period of Old Swedish (1200-1350), the time of the later runic inscriptions and the oldest literature. During this period the language is already distinctly separate from the (literary) Icelandic-Norwegian (though not yet from Danish). The words of the <hi rend="italic">Older Vestgötalaw—</hi> FALDER KLOCKÆ NIDER I H0VOP MANNI, BÖTI SOPCN MARCHUM PRIM, EN HAN FAR BANÆ AF—<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="17"> If the bell fall down on anybody’s head, the parish pays a fine of three marks should he die from it. </note></p><p>would in contemporary Icelandic be—</p><p>fellr klukka nior í höfuo manni, bæti sókn mörkum prim, ef hann fær liana af.</p><p>These few words exhibit instances of the following innovations in Swedish :—d is inserted between <hi rend="italic">ll (nn)</hi> and a following <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">b</hi> between <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l, r,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> between <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t, n,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">hambrar,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">hamrar,</hi> hammers, <hi rend="italic">sampt,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">samt,</hi> together with) ; an auxiliary vowel is inserted between final <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and a preceding consonant ; <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in terminations is often changed into <hi rend="italic">æ</hi>; a u in the final syllable causes no change of a preceding <hi rend="italic">a;</hi> the present tense takes the vowel of the infinitive (and the preterite subjunctive that of preterite indicative plural). Other important changes, appearing at the same time, but probably, partly at least, of a somewhat older date, are the following :—all diphthongs are contracted (as <hi rend="italic">ogha,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">auga, eye ; dröm</hi> a, Icel. <hi rend="italic">drøyma,</hi> to dream ; <hi rend="italic">sten,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">steinn,</hi> stone—traces of which we find as early as the 12th century); <hi rend="italic">é</hi> has passed into <hi rend="italic">æ</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">knæ</hi>, Icel. <hi rend="italic">kné</hi>, knee) ; <hi rend="italic">i</hi> α into <hi rend="italic">iæ</hi>, as in Eastern Norwegian (as <hi rend="italic">hiærta,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">hjarta,</hi> heart) ; <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> into <hi rend="italic">y</hi> after <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and a consonant + <hi rend="italic">l</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">flygha,</hi> Icel. <hi rend="italic">fljúga,</hi> to fly); the forms of the three persons singular of verbs have assimilated (except in the so-called strong preterite); the 2d pers. plur. ends in - <hi rend="italic">in</hi> for - <hi rend="italic">i</hi> ö, and the passive voice in -s for the earlier <hi rend="italic">-sk;</hi> the dat. plur. of substantives with suffixed article ends in <hi rend="italic">-umin</hi> (Icel. <hi rend="italic">-onom,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">sunumin, sunonom,</hi> to the sons). The transition to the 14th century is marked by important changes :— short y, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> passed into ö in many positions (as d <hi rend="italic">or</hi> for <hi rend="italic">dyr,</hi> door, &amp;amp;c.), and the forms of the dative and the accusative of pronouns gradually became the same. The number of borrowed words is as yet very limited, and is chiefly confined to ecclesiastical words of Latin and Greek origin, introduced along with Christianity (as <hi rend="italic">kors,</hi> cross, <hi rend="italic">bref,</hi> epistle, <hi rend="italic">skoli,</hi> school, <hi rend="italic">præster,</hi> priest, <hi rend="italic">almosa,</hi> alms). At the middle of the 14th century the literary language undergoes a remarkable reform, developing at the same time to a “ rikssprâk, ” a uniform language, common to the whole country. The chief characteristics of this later Old Swedish are the following:—the long <hi rend="italic">a</hi> has passed into <hi rend="italic">å</hi> (that is, an open <hi rend="italic">o),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">io</hi> (except before <hi rend="italic">rd, rt)</hi> into <hi rend="italic">io</hi> (as s <hi rend="italic">i</hi> o, sea, lake); at the same time there appears a so-called law of vowel balance, according to which the vowels <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and u are always found in terminations after a short root syllable, and—at least when no consonant follows— <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> after a long one (as <hi rend="italic">Gu</hi> d <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, to God, <hi rend="italic">til salu,</hi> for sale, but i <hi rend="italic">garpe,</hi> in the court, <hi rend="italic">for visso,</hi> assuredly) ; <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">k (sk)</hi> before</p><p>palatal vowels are softened into <hi rend="italic">dj</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tj (stj) ; k</hi> and t in unaccented syllables often pass into <hi rend="italic">gh, dh</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">Sverighe</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Sverike,</hi> Sweden, <hi rend="italic">litedh</hi> for <hi rend="italic">litet,</hi> a little); the articles <hi rend="italic">pæn</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">hin),</hi> the, and (a little later) <hi rend="italic">en,</hi> a, come into use ; the dual pronouns vanish ; the relative <hi rend="italic">ær,</hi> that, is changed with su <hi rend="italic">m</hi>; the present participle takes a secondary form in -s (as <hi rend="italic">gangandes,</hi> beside <hi rend="italic">gangande,</hi> going). A little later the following changes appear :—a short vowel is lengthened before a single consonant, first when the consonant belongs to the same syllable (as <hi rend="italic">hat,</hi> hate), afterwards also when it belongs to the following one (as <hi rend="italic">hata,</hi> to hate) ; an auxiliary vowel is inserted between <hi rend="italic">l</hi> or <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and a preceding consonant (as <hi rend="italic">gavel,</hi> gable, <hi rend="italic">oken,</hi> desert) ; short <hi rend="italic">i</hi>, ending a syllable, passes into <hi rend="italic">e</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">leva,</hi> to live) ; <hi rend="italic">th</hi> passes into t; a new conjugation is formed which has no infinitive termination, but doubles the sign of the preterite (as <hi rend="italic">bo, bodde, bolt,</hi> to dwell, dwelt, dwelt). Owing to the political and commercial state of the country the language at this period is deluged with borrowed words of Low German origin, mostly social and industrial terms, such as the great number of verbs in <hi rend="italic">-era (e.g., hantera,</hi> to handle), the substantives in - <hi rend="italic">eri (rö</hi> v <hi rend="italic">er</hi> i, robbery), - <hi rend="italic">innα</hi> <hi rend="italic">(forstinna,</hi> princess), <hi rend="italic">-het (fromhet,</hi> piety), <hi rend="italic">b</hi> e- <hi rend="italic">(betala,</hi> to pay), and a great many others <hi rend="italic">(klen,</hi> weak, <hi rend="italic">smaka,</hi> to taste, <hi rend="italic">grover,</hi> big, <hi rend="italic">ρuηg,</hi> purse, <hi rend="italic">tukt,</hi> discipline, <hi rend="italic">bruka,</hi> to use, <hi rend="italic">tvist</hi>, quarrel, <hi rend="italic">stovel,</hi> boot, <hi rend="italic">arbeta,</hi> to work, <hi rend="italic">frokoster,</hi> lunch, &amp;amp;c. ). Owing to the political circumstances, we find towards the end of the period a very powerful Danish influence, which extends also to phonetics and etymology, so that, for example, nearly all the terminal vowels are supplanted by the uniform Danish <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> the hard consonants <hi rend="italic">p, t, k</hi> by <hi rend="italic">b, d, g</hi> as in Danish, the second person plural of the imperative ends in -e <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> beside -e <hi rend="italic">n</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">tagher,</hi> for older <hi rend="italic">takin).</hi></p><p>Dialectical differences incontestably occur in the runic inscriptions as well as in the literature ; in the former, however, most of them are hidden from our eyes by the character of the writing, which is, from a phonetic point of view, highly unsatisfactory, indicating the most different sounds by the same sign (for example, <hi rend="italic">o, u, y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ö</hi> are denoted by one and the same rune) ; in the literature again they are reduced to a minimum by the awakening desire to form a uniform literary language for the whole country, and by the literary productivity and consequent predominant influence of certain provinces (as Östergötland). This question, moreover, has not hitherto been investigated with sufficient care.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="18"> See especially K. J. Lyngby, <hi rend="italic">Antiqu.

Materials for its study are very abundant<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="19"> See C. Save, <hi rend="italic">Gutniska urkunder,</hi> 1859; J. G. Liljegren, <hi rend="italic">Runurkunder</hi>, 1833. </note>: on one hand we possess more than two hundred runic inscriptions, among them a very remarkable one of the 12th or 13th century, counting upwards of three hundred runes, cut on a font (now in Aakirkeby on the island of Bornholm), and representing the life of Christ in a series of pictures and words ; on the other hand a literature has been preserved consisting of a runic calendar from 1328, the law of the island (from about 1350), a piece of traditional history, and a guild statute. The language is distinguished from the Old Swedish of the mainland especially by the following characteristics :—the old diphthongs are preserved <hi rend="italic">(e.g., auga,</hi> eye, <hi rend="italic">droyma,</hi> to dream, <hi rend="italic">stain,</hi> stone), and a new triphthong has arisen by the change of <hi rend="italic">iú</hi> into <hi rend="italic">iau</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">fliauga,</hi> to fly) ; the long vowels <hi rend="italic">e, œ, ö</hi> <hi rend="italic">,</hi> have passed into i, <hi rend="italic">e, y</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">kni,</hi> knee, <hi rend="italic">mela,</hi> to speak, <hi rend="italic">dyma,</hi> to deem) ; short <hi rend="italic">o</hi> rarely occurs except before <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> being in other positions changed into <hi rend="italic">u</hi>; <hi rend="italic">w</hi> is dropped before <hi rend="italic">r</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">raipi,</hi> wrath) ; the genitive singular of feminines in <hi rend="italic">-a</hi> ends in <hi rend="italic">-ur</hi> for <hi rend="italic">-u</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">kirkiur,</hi> of the church). Owing to the entire absence of documentary evidence it is impossible to determine how far the dialects east of the Baltic, which no doubt had a separate individuality, differed from the mother-tongue.</p><p>The first to pay attention to the study of Old Swedish<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="20"> See A. Noreen, “Aperçu de l’histoire de la science linguistique Suédoise” <hi rend="italic">(Le Muséon,</hi> ii., 1883). </note> was the Swedish savant J. Buræus (+1652), who by several works (from 1599 onwards) called attention to and excited a lively interest in the runic monuments, and, by his edition (1634) of the excellent Old Swedish work <hi rend="italic">Um Styrilsi Konunga ok Höfpinga,</hi> in Old Swedish literature also. His no longer extant <hi rend="italic">Specimen Primariae Linguae Scαntziαnae</hi> gave but a very short review of Old Swedish inflexions, but is remarkable as the first essay of its kind, and is perhaps the oldest attempt in modern times at a grammatical treatment of any old Germanic language. The study of runes was very popular in the 17th century; M. Celsius (+1679) deciphered the “staffless” runes (see above, p. 370), and J. Hadorph (+1693), who also did good work in editing Old Swedish texts, copied more than a thousand runic inscriptions. During the 18th century, again, Old Swedish was almost completely neglected ; but in the present century the study of runes has been well represented by the collection of the Swede Liljegren (+1837) and by the Norwegian S.</p><pb xml:id="eb09-21-s02-0372" facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0394.jp2"/><p>Bugge’s ingenious interpretation and grammatical treatment of some of the most remarkable inscriptions. Old Swedish literature has also been made the object of grammatical researches. A first outline of a history of the Swedish language is to be found in the work of N. M. Petersen (1830) mentioned above (p. 370), and a scheme of an Old Swedish grammar in P. A. Munch’s essay, <hi rend="italic">Fornswenskans och Fornnorskans sprakbyggnad</hi> (1849); but Old Swedish grammar was never treated as an independent branch of science until the appearance of J. E. Rydqvist’s (+ 1877) monumental work <hi rend="italic">Svenska språkets lagar</hi> (in 6 vols., 1850-83), which was followed in Sweden by a whole literature on the same subject. Thus phonetics, which were comparatively neglected by Rydqvist, have been investigated with great success, especially by L. F. Leffler and A. Kock ; while the other parts of grammar have been treated of above all by K. F. Söderwall, the chief of contemporary Old Swedish scholars. His principal work, <hi rend="italic">Ordbok öfver Svenska medeltidsspråket</hi> (1884 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>), now in course of publication, gives the list of words in the later Old Swedish language, and—taken along with the <hi rend="italic">Ordbok till samlingen af Sveriges gamla lagar</hi> (1877), by C. J. Schlyter, the well-known editor of Old Swedish texts, which contains the vocabulary of the oldest literature—it worthily meets the demand for an Old Swedish dictionary. An Old Swedish grammar, answering the requirements of modern philology, is still needed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="21"> A. Noreen has an Old Swedish grammar in preparation. </note></p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Modern Swedish.—</hi> The first complete translation of the Bible, edited in 1541 by the brothers Olaus and Laurentius Petri, and generally called the Bible of Gustavus I., may be regarded as the earliest important monument of this. Owing to religious and political circumstances, and to the learned influence of humanism, theological and historico-political works preponderate in the Swedish literature of the following period, which therefore affords but scanty material for philological research. It is not until the middle of the 17th century that Swedish literature adequately exemplifies the language, for at that period literature first began to be cultivated as a fine art, and its principal representatives, such as Stiernhielm, Columbus, and Spegel, were in reality the first to study it ns a means of expression and to develop its resources. Amongst the authors of the 18th century we have to mention in the first place Dalin, who was to some extent the creator of the prose style of that epoch ; while of the end of the century Kellgren and Bellman are the most noteworthy examples, representing the higher and the more familiar style of poetry respectively. The language of the 19th century, or at any rate of the middle of it, is best represented in the works of Wallin and Tegnér, which, on account of their enormous circulation, have had a greater influence than those of any other authors.</p><p>As to the language itself the earliest Modern Swedish texts, as Gustavus I.’s Bible, differ considerably from the latest Old Swedish ones.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="22"> The printed characters are also considerably changed by the introduction </note> We find a decided tendency to exterminate Danisms and reintroduce native and partially antiquated forms. At the same time there appear several traces of a later state of the language: all genitives (singular and plural), <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> end in -s, which in earlier times was the proper ending of only certain declensions. In spite of the archaistic efforts of many writers, both in forms and in vocabulary, the language nevertheless underwent rapid changes during the 16th and 17th centuries. Thus <hi rend="italic">sj</hi> and <hi rend="italic">stj</hi> (original as well as derived from <hi rend="italic">sk</hi> before a palatal vowel) assimilate into a simple <hi rend="italic">sh-</hi> sound ; <hi rend="italic">dj</hi> (original as well as derived from <hi rend="italic">g</hi> before a palatal vowel), at least at the end of the 17th century, dropped its <hi rend="italic">d</hi>-sound (compare such spellings as <hi rend="italic">diufwer, giättar, envoyé,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">jufter,</hi> udder, <hi rend="italic">jättar,</hi> giants, <hi rend="italic">envoyé,</hi> envoy) ; <hi rend="italic">hj</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">j</hi> (such spellings are found as <hi rend="italic">jort</hi> for <hi rend="italic">hjort,</hi> hart, and <hi rend="italic">hjärpe</hi> for <hi rend="italic">järpe,</hi> hazel grouse) ; <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> inserted in such words as <hi rend="italic">himblar,</hi> heavens, <hi rend="italic">hambrar,</hi> hammers, <hi rend="italic">jämpn,</hi> even, <hi rend="italic">sampt,</hi> together with (see above, p. 371), are dropped ; the first person plural of the verb takes the form of the third person (as <hi rend="italic">vi fara, foro,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">vi farom, forom,</hi> we go, went) ; by the side of the pronoun <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> you, there arises a secondary form <hi rend="italic">Ni,</hi> in full use in the spoken language about 1650 ; the adjective gradually loses all the case-inflexions ; in substantives the nominative, dative, and accusative take the same form as early as the middle of the 17th century ; in the declension with suffixed article the old method of expressing number and case both in the substantive and the article is changed, so that the substantive alone takes the number-inflexion and the article alone the case-ending ; neuter substantives ending in a vowel, which previously had no plural ending, take the plural ending - <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> some <hi rend="italic">-er,—</hi> as <hi rend="italic">bi∙n,</hi> bees, <hi rend="italic">bageri-er,</hi> bakeries. About the year 1700 the Old Swedish inflexion may, in general, be considered as almost completely given up, although a work of such importance in the history of the language as Charles XII.’s Bible (so-called) of 1703 (edited by Bishop J. Svedberg), by a kind of conscious archaism has preserved a good many of the old forms. To these archaistic tendencies of certain authors at the end of the 17th century we owe the great number of Old Swedish and Icelandic borrowed words then introduced into the language,—</p><p>as <hi rend="italic">fager,</hi> fair, <hi rend="italic">härja,</hi> to ravage, <hi rend="italic">later,</hi> manners, <hi rend="italic">snille,</hi> genius, <hi rend="italic">täma,</hi> girl, <hi rend="italic">tima,</hi> to happen, &amp;amp;c. In addition to this, owing to humanistic influence, learned expressions were borrowed from Latin during the whole 16th and 17th centuries ; and from German, chiefly at the Reformation and during the Thirty Years’ War, numberless words were introduced,—as <hi rend="italic">språk,</hi> language, <hi rend="italic">tapper,</hi> brave, <hi rend="italic">prakt,</hi> magnificence, <hi rend="italic">hurtig,</hi> brisk, &amp;amp;c. ; among these may be noted especially a great number of words beginning in <hi rend="italic">an-, er-, för-,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ge-.</hi> Owing to the constantly increasing political and literary predominance of France French words were largely borrowed in the 17th century, and to an equally great extent in the 18th ; such are <hi rend="italic">affär,</hi> business, <hi rend="italic">resρckt,</hi> respect, <hi rend="italic">talaηg,</hi> talent, <hi rend="italic">charmant,</hi> charming, &amp;amp;c. In the 19th century, again, especially about the middle of it, we anew meet with conscious and energetic efforts after purism both in the formation of new words and in the adoption of words from the old language (id, diligence, <hi rend="italic">mala,</hi> to speak, <hi rend="italic">fylking,</hi> battle-array, &amp;amp;c.), and from the dialects <hi rend="italic">(bliga,</hi> to gaze, <hi rend="italic">flis,</hi> flake, <hi rend="italic">skrabbig,</hi> bad, &amp;amp;c. ). Consequently, the present vocabulary differs to a very great extent from that of the literature of the 17th century. As for the sounds and grammatical forms, on the other hand, comparatively few important changes have taken place during the last two centuries. In the 18th century, however, the aspirates <hi rend="italic">dh</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> passed into <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> (after <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> into <hi rend="italic">j</hi>),—as <hi rend="italic">lag</hi> for <hi rend="italic">lagh,</hi> law, <hi rend="italic">brod</hi> for <hi rend="italic">brödh,</hi> bread ; <hi rend="italic">hv</hi> passed into <hi rend="italic">v</hi> (in dialects already about the year 1600),— as <hi rend="italic">valp</hi> for <hi rend="italic">hvalper,</hi> whelp ; <hi rend="italic">lj</hi> likewise into <hi rend="italic">j,—</hi> thus <hi rend="italic">ljuster,</hi> leister, occurs written <hi rend="italic">juster.</hi> In our time <hi rend="italic">rd, rl, rn, rs,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">rt</hi> are passing into simple sounds (“supradental” <hi rend="italic">d, l, n, s,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">t),</hi> while the singular of the verbs is gradually supplanting the plural. A vigorous reform, slowly but firmly carried on almost uniformly during all periods of the Swedish language, is the throwing back of the principal accent to the beginning of the word in cases where previously it stood nearer the end, a tendency that is characteristic of all the Scandinavian languages, but no doubt especially of Swedish. In the primitive Scandinavian age the accent was removed in most simple words'; the originally accented syllable, however, preserved a musically high pitch and stress. Thus there arose two essentially different accentuations,—the one, with unaccented final syllable, as in Icel. <hi rend="italic">stígr</hi> (Gr. oτϵiχϵir), thou goest, the comparative <hi rend="italic">betre (cf</hi> Gr. τάσσων from <hi rend="italic">τaχvs),</hi> better, the other, with secondary stress and high pitch on the final, as in Icel. pret, plur. <hi rend="italic">buoom</hi> (Sanskr. <hi rend="italic">bubudhimá),</hi> we bade, part. pret, <hi rend="italic">bitenn</hi> (Sanskr. <hi rend="italic">bhinnás),</hi> bitten. The same change afterwards took place in those compound words that had the principal accent on the second member, so that such contrasts as German <hi rend="italic">úrtheil</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ertheílen</hi> were gradually brought into conformity with the former accentuation. At the present day it is quite exceptionally (and chiefly in borrowed words of later date) that the principal accent in Swedish is on any other syllable than the first, as in <hi rend="italic">lekámen,</hi> body, <hi rend="italic">välsígna,</hi> to bless.</p><p>The scientific study of Modern Swedish<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="23"> See A. Noreen, “Aperçu,” &amp;c.; H. Hernlund, <hi rend="italic">Förslag och åtgärder till Svenska skriflspråkets reglerande,</hi> 1883. </note> dates from Sweden’s glorious epoch, the last half of the 17th century. The first regular Swedish grammar was written in 1684 (not edited till 1884) in Latin by Er. Aurivillius ; the first in Swedish is by N. Tiällman, 1696. Nothing, however, of value was produced before the great work of Rydqvist mentioned above, which, although chiefly dealing with the old language, throws a flood of light on the modern also. Among the works of late years we must call special attention co the researches into the history of the language by K. F. Söderwall,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="24"> <hi rend="italic">Hufvudepokerna af Svenska sprakets utbildning,</hi> 1870 </note> F. A.

A good though short abstract is given in H. Sweet’s essay on “ Sounds and Forms of Spoken Swedish ” <hi rend="italic">(Trans. Phil. Soc.,</hi> 1877-79). Attempts to construct a dictionary were made in the 16th century, the earliest being the anonymous <hi rend="italic">Variarum Rerum Vocabula cum Sueca Interpretatione,</hi> in 1538, and the <hi rend="italic">Synonymorum Libellus</hi> by Elavus Petri Helsingius, in 1587, both of which, however, followed German originals. The first regular dictionary is by H. Spegel, 1712; and in 1769 Joh. Ihre (+ 1780), probably the greatest philological genius of Sweden, published his <hi rend="italic">Glossarium Sviogoticum,</hi> which still remains the most copious Swedish dictionary in existence. In the present century the diligent lexicographer A. F. Dalin has published several useful works. At present the Swedish Academy has in preparation a gigantic dictionary on about the same plan as Dr Murray’s <hi rend="italic">New English Dictionary</hi>; there will also appear as soon as possible a complete list (with grammatical and etymological notes), drawn up by A. Andersson, Ad. Noreen, and F. A. Tamm, of the words in use in the present language. The characteristic differences between the Swedish literary language used in Finland and that of Sweden are exhibited in the <hi rend="italic">Finsk Tidskrift,</hi> vol. xix. pts. 5, 6, 1885 (“Studier pa Svensk språkbotten i Finland,” by Karl Lindstrom).</p><p>of the new letters å (with the transl. of the New Testament of 1526), and <hi rend="italic">ä</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ö</hi> (both already in the first print in Swedish of 1495) for <hi rend="italic">aa, as, φ.</hi></p><pb xml:id="eb09-21-s02-0373" facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0395.jp2"/><p>IV. Danish, like Swedish, is divided into the two great Pre-and Post-Reformation epochs of Old and Modern Danish.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Old Danish.—</hi> The territory of Old Danish included not only the present Denmark, but also the southern Swedish provinces of Halland, Skåne, and Blekinge, the whole of Schleswig, and, as stated above, for a short period also a great part of England, and Normandy. The oldest monuments of the language are runic inscriptions, altogether about 250 in number.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="27"> See P. G. Thorsen, <hi rend="italic">De Danske runemindesmærker,</hi> i., 1864, ii., 1879-81 ; L. F. A. Wimmer, “ Runeskriftens Oprindelse” <hi rend="italic">(Aarbφgerfοr Βοrdisk Oldkyndighed,</hi> 1874). </note> The oldest of them go as far back as to the beginning of the 9th century, the Snoldelev-stone for instance on Sealand, and the Flemløse-stone on Fünen. From about the year 900 date the very long inscriptions of Tryggevælde (Sealand) and Glavendrup (Fünen) ; from the 10th century we have the stones of Jællinge (Jutland), in memory of two of the oldest historical kings of Denmark (Gorm and Harald) ; while from about 1000 we have a stone at Dannevirke (Schleswig), raised by the conqueror of England, Sven Tjuguskægg. Relics of about the same age are the words that were introduced by the Danes into English, the oldest of which date from the end of the 9th century, the time of the first Danish settlement in England ; most of these are to be found in the early English work <hi rend="italic">Ormulum.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="28"> See E. Brate, “ Nordische Lehnwörter im Orrmulum ” <hi rend="italic">(Paul-Braune’s Beiträge,</hi> x, 1884). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>No Danish literature arose before the 13th century. The oldest manuscript that has come down to us dates from the end of that century, written in runes and containing the law of Skåne. From about the year 1300 we possess a manuscript written in Latin characters and containing Valdemar’s and Erik’s laws of Sealand, the Flensborg manuscript of the law of Jutland, and a manuscript of the municipal laws of Flensborg. These three manuscripts represent three different dialects,—that, namely, of Skåne, Halland, and Blekinge, that of Sealand and the other islands, and that of Jutland and Schleswig. There existed no uniform literary language in the Old Danish period, although some of the most important works of the 15th century, such as Michael’s <hi rend="italic">Poems</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Rhymed Chronicle</hi> (the first book printed in Danish, in 1495), on account of their excellent diction, contributed materially to the final preponderance of their dialect, that of Sealand, towards the Reformation.</p><p>As to the form of the language, it hardly differs at all during the period between 800 and 1200 a.d. from Old Swedish. It is only in the oldest literature that we can trace any marked differences; these are not very important, and are generally attributable to the fact that Danish underwent a little earlier the same changes that afterwards took place in Swedish <hi rend="italic">(e.g., h</hi> in <hi rend="italic">hv</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hj</hi> in Danish was mute as early as the end of the 14th century ; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> p. 372, above). The laws referred to above only agree in differing from the Swedish laws in the following points :—the nominative already takes the form of the accusative (as <hi rend="italic">kalf,</hi> calf, but Old Sw. nom. <hi rend="italic">kalver,</hi> acc. <hi rend="italic">kalf)</hi>; the second person plural ends in -æ (as <hi rend="italic">köpæ,</hi> but Old Sw. <hi rend="italic">köpin,</hi> you buy) ; in the subjunctive no differences are expressed between persons and numbers. Among themselves, on the contrary, they show considerable differences ; the law of Skåne most nearly corresponds with the Swedish laws, those of Sealand keep the middle place, while the law of Jutland exhibits the most distinctive individuality. The Skåne law, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> retains the vowels <hi rend="italic">a, i, u</hi> in terminations, which otherwise in Danish have become uniformly <hi rend="italic">æ</hi>; the same law inserts <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> between certain consonants (like Old Sw. ; see p. 371), has preserved the dative, and in the present tense takes the vowel of the infinitive; the law of Jutland, again, does not insert <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and has dropped the dative, while the present tense (undergoing an “ Umlaut”) has not always accepted the vowel of the infinitive; in all three characteristics the laws of Sealand fluctuate. After 1350 we meet an essentially altered language, in which we must first note the change of <hi rend="italic">k, ρ, t</hi> after a vowel into <hi rend="italic">g, b, d</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">tag,</hi> roof, <hi rend="italic">løbe,</hi> to run, <hi rend="italic">æde,</hi> to eat) ; <hi rend="italic">th</hi> passes into <hi rend="italic">t</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">ting,</hi> thing), <hi rend="italic">gh</hi> into <hi rend="italic">w</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">law</hi> for <hi rend="italic">lagh,</hi> guild) and into <hi rend="italic">i</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">vei</hi> for <hi rend="italic">wægh,</hi> way) ; <hi rend="italic">ld, nd</hi> are pronounced like <hi rend="italic">ll, nn</hi>; <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is the general genitive ending in singular and plural, &amp;amp;c. The vocabulary, which in earlier times only borrowed a few and those mostly ecclesiastical words, is now —chiefly owing to the predominant influence of the Hanse towns— inundated by German words, such as those beginning with <hi rend="italic">be-, bi-, ge-, for-,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">und-,</hi> and ending in <hi rend="italic">-hed,</hi> and a great number of others, as <hi rend="italic">blive,</hi> to become, <hi rend="italic">ske,</hi> to happen, <hi rend="italic">fri,</hi> free, <hi rend="italic">krig,</hi> war, <hi rend="italic">buxer,</hi> pantaloons, <hi rend="italic">ganske,</hi> quite, &amp;amp;c.</p><p>An Old Danish grammar is still wanting, and the preparatory studies which exist are, although excellent, but few in number, being chiefly essays by the Danes K. J. Lyngby and L. F. A. Wimmer, with N. M. Petersen’s treatise <hi rend="italic">Det Danske, Norske, og Svenske sprogs historic,</hi> vol. i. (1829), one of the first works that paid any attention to Old Danish, which till then had been completely neglected. A dictionary on a large scale covering the whole of Old Danish literature, except the very oldest, by O. Kalkar, has been in course of publication since 1881 ; older and smaller is Chr. Molbech’s <hi rend="italic">Dansk Glossarium</hi> (1857-66).</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Modern Danish. —</hi> The first important monument of this is the translation of the Bible, by Chr. Pedersen, Peder Palladius, and others, the so-called Christian III.’s Bible (1550), famous for the unique purity and excellence of its language, the dialect of Sealand, then incontestably promoted to be the language of the kingdom. The first secular work deserving of the same praise is Vedel's translation of Saxo (1575). The succeeding period until 1750 offers but few works in really good Danish ; as perfectly classical, however, we have to mention the so-called Christian V.'s Law of Denmark (1683). For the rest, humanism has stamped a highly Latin-French character on the literature, striking even in the works of the principal writer of this period, Holberg. But about the year 1750 there begins a new movement, characterized by a reaction against the language of the preceding period and purist tendencies, or, at least, efforts to enrich the language with new-formed words (not seldom after the German pattern), as <hi rend="italic">omkreds,</hi> periphery, <hi rend="italic">selvstændighed,</hi> independence, <hi rend="italic">valgsρrog,</hi> devise, <hi rend="italic">digter,</hi> poet. The leading representatives of these tendencies were Eilschow and Sneedorf. From their time Danish may be said to have acquired its present essential features, though it cannot be denied that several later authors, as J. Ewald and Öhlenschläger, have exercised a considerable influence on the poetical style. As the most important differences between the grammatical forms of the 18th and 19th centuries on one hand and those of the 16th and 17th centuries on the other may be noted the following :—most neuter substantives take a plural ending ; those ending in a vowel form their plural by adding <hi rend="italic">-r</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">riger,</hi> for older <hi rend="italic">rige,</hi> plural of <hi rend="italic">rige,</hi> kingdom), and many of those ending in a consonant by adding <hi rend="italic">-e</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">huse</hi> for <hi rend="italic">hus,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">hits,</hi> house) ; substantives ending in <hi rend="italic">-ere</hi> drop their final <hi rend="italic">-e</hi> (as <hi rend="italic">dommer</hi> for <hi rend="italic">dommere,</hi> judge) ; the declension with suffixed article becomes simplified in the same way as in Swedish (see above, p. 372) ; the plural of verbs takes the singular form (as <hi rend="italic">drak</hi> for <hi rend="italic">drukke,</hi> we drank) ; and the preterite subjunctive is supplanted by the infinitive (as <hi rend="italic">var</hi> for <hi rend="italic">vaare,</hi> were). The first Modern Danish grammar is by E. Pontoppidan, 1668, but in Latin ; the first in Danish is by the famous Peder Syv, 1685. The works of the self-taught J. Højsgaard (<hi rend="italic">e.g</hi>., <hi rend="italic">Accentueret og raisonneret grammatica,</hi> 1747) possess great merit, and are of especial importance as regards accent and syntax. The earlier part of this century gave us Rask’s grammar (1830). A thoroughly satisfactory Modern Danish grammar does not exist ; perhaps the best is that by Th. Möbius (1871). The vocabulary of the 16th and 17th centuries is collected in Kalkar’s <hi rend="italic">Ordbog,</hi> mentioned above, that of the 18th and 19th centuries in the voluminous and as yet unfinished dictionary of Videnskabernas Selskab, and in C. Molbech’s <hi rend="italic">Dansk ordbog</hi> (2d ed. 1859).<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="29"> See L(udvig) W(immer). “Det Danske Sprog,” in <hi rend="italic">Nordisk Conversations-lexikon,</hi> 3d ed., 1885 ; T.

But it is only since 1814, when Norway gained her independence, that we can clearly perceive the so-called Dano-Norwegian gradually developing as a distinct offshoot of the general Danish language. The first representatives of this new language are the writer of popular life M. Hansen (+ 1842), the poet H. Wergeland (+ 1845), and above all the tale-writer P. C. Asbjørnsen (+ 1885). In our own days it has been further developed, especially by the great poets Ibsen and Bjørnson and the novelist Lie ; and it has been said, not without reason, to have attained its classical perfection in the works of the first-named author. This language differs from Danish particularly in its vocabulary, having adopted very many Norwegian provincial words (6000 to 7000), less in its inflexions, but to a very great extent in its pronunciation. The most striking differences in this respect are the following :—Norwegian <hi rend="italic">p</hi>, <hi rend="italic">t, k</hi> answer to Danish <hi rend="italic">b, d, g</hi> in cases where they are of later date (see above),—as <hi rend="italic">løpe,</hi> Danish <hi rend="italic">løbe,</hi> to run, <hi rend="italic">liten,</hi> D. <hi rend="italic">liden,</hi> little, <hi rend="italic">bak,</hi> D. <hi rend="italic">bag,</hi> back) ; to Danish <hi rend="italic">k, g</hi> before palatal vowels answer Norwegian <hi rend="italic">tj, j ; r</hi> (point-trill, not back-trill as in Danish) is assimilated in some way with following <hi rend="italic">t (d), l, n,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> into so-called supradental sounds (see p. 372) ; both the primitive Scandinavian systems of accentuation are still kept separate from a musical point of view, in opposition to the monotonous Danish. There are several other characteristics, nearly all of which are points of correspondence with Swedish.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="30"> See J. A.

Aasen was led to undertake the bold project of constructing, by the study of these two sources, and on the basis of his native dialect (Søndmøre), a Norwegian-Norwegian (“Norsk-Norsk”) language, the so-called “Landsmàl.” In 1853 he exhibited a specimen of it, and, thanks to such excellent writers as Aasen himself, the poets O. Vinje and K. Janson, and the novelist A. Garborg, as well as a zealous pro-pagandism of the society “ Det Norske Samlag ” (founded in 1868), there has since arisen a valuable though not very large literature in the “Landsmàl.” But it is nowhere spoken.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="31"> See J.

The Norwegian dialects have been thoroughly examined by Aasen, whose works give a general account of them ; while in our own days Joh. Storm, above all, displays an unwearying activity, especially in the minute investigation of their phonetic constitution, to which Aasen had paid but scant attention. The substance of these researches in the Norwegian dialects has recently been presented in a magazine, called <hi rend="italic">Norvegia,</hi> of which the first volume is in course of publication ; it employs an alphabet invented by Storm.

Feilberg’s great dictionary of the dialect of Jutland, and J. C. Espersen’s of the dialect of Bornholm.

Archbishop E.</p><p>Benzelius the younger (+1743) made collections of dialect words, and on his work is based the dialectical dictionary of Ihre of 1766. An excellent work considering its age is S. Hof’s <hi rend="italic">Dialectus Vestrogothica,</hi> 1772. The energy and zeal of C. Save (essays on the dialects of Gotland and Dalarne) inspired these studies with extraordinary animation at the middle of the 19th century ; in 1867 J. E. Rietz published a voluminous dialect dictionary ; the number of special essays, too, increased yearly. From 1872 so-called “ landsmåleforeningar ” (dialect societies) were founded among the students at the universities of Upsala, Lund, and Helsingfors (at Upsala alone 13), for a systematic and thorough investigation of dialects. We find remarkable progress in scientific method—especially with regard to phonetics—in the constantly increasing literature ; special mention may be made of the detailed descriptions of the dialects of Värmland, Gotland, and Dalarna by Ad. Noreen, and A. F. Freudenthal's monographs on the Finnish and Esthonian Swedish dialects. Since 1879 the Swedish dialect societies have published a magazine on a comprehensive plan, <hi rend="italic">De Svenska Landsm</hi> å <hi rend="italic">len,</hi> edited by J. A. Lundell, who has invented for this purpose an excellent phonetic alphabet (partially based on C. J. Sundeval's work <hi rend="italic">Om phonetiska bokstäfver,</hi> 1855). (A.
