<p><span class="font2">latter, in which thc Apocalyptist looks forward prophetically to the issue, the assurance held out is of ultimate victory, but of&nbsp;victory through death or martyrdom. In the former (Jewish&nbsp;or Christian-Jewish fragment) the sealing seemed to have carried&nbsp;with it the assurance of deliverance from physical death, as in&nbsp;Ezek. ix. 4 sqq. But in its </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">new</span><span class="font2"> context this meaning can hardly&nbsp;be retained. Not improbably the scaling means to our author&nbsp;the preservation not from death, but through death from&nbsp;unfaithfulness, and the number 144,000 would signify mystically&nbsp;the entire body of true Christians, which formed the true people&nbsp;of God,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chapter vii., then, interrupts the development of the author’s plan, but the interruption is deliberate. He wishes to encourage&nbsp;the persecuted church not only to face without fear, but also to&nbsp;meet with triumphant assurance the onset of those evils which&nbsp;would bring panic and despair on the unbelieving world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ww.-fx.—These chapters, though presenting some minor difficulties, do not call for discussion here. They recount the&nbsp;six partial judgments which followed the opening of the seventh&nbsp;seal and the blasts of the six trumpets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">x.-xf. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1-1 d.—</span><span class="font2">This section bristles with difficulties. Chapter x. forms an introduction to xi. 1-13. In it the prophet receives&nbsp;a new commission, x. 11 : “ Thou must prophesy again over many&nbsp;peoples and nations and tongues and kings.” This new commission explains his departure from the plan pursued in the&nbsp;earlier chapters of developing the seventh in each series into a&nbsp;new series of seven. The seer has a vision of the seven thunders,&nbsp;but these he is bidden to seal and not commit to writing. Hc&nbsp;is instead to write down the new book of prophecies. The end&nbsp;is at hand. It is noteworthy that in the earlier visions it was&nbsp;Christ who spoke to the seer. Here and in the later visions,&nbsp;especially those drawn from foreign sources, it is an angel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In xi. 1-13 we have a characteristic illustration of our author’s dependence on* traditional materials and his free adaptation&nbsp;of them to meanings other than originally belonged to them.&nbsp;For it is generally agreed among critics that xi. 1-13 is borrowed&nbsp;from Jewish sources, and that this fragment really consists of&nbsp;two smaller fragments, xi. 1-2 and xi. 3-13. The former oracle&nbsp;referred originally to the actual. Temple, and contained a prediction of the preservation of the Temple. It must have been&nbsp;written before </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 70 and probably by a Zealot.@@<sup>1</sup> But our&nbsp;author could not have taken it in this literal sense if he wrote&nbsp;after </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 70 or even anterior to that date, owing to the explicit&nbsp;declaration of Christ as to the coming destruction of Jerusalem.&nbsp;The passage, then, must have a spiritual meaning, and its purpose&nbsp;is the encouragement of the faithful by the assurance of their&nbsp;deliverance not necessarily from physical death but from the&nbsp;dominion of the evil one. In xi. 3-13 we have another Jewish&nbsp;fragment of a very enigmatic character. Bousset has shown&nbsp;with much probability that it is part of the Antichrist legend.&nbsp;The prophecy of the two witnesses and their martyrdom belongs&nbsp;to this tradition. The fragment was apparently written before&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 70, since it speaks of the fall of only a tenth of thc city,&nbsp;xi. 13.@@<sup>2</sup> The significance of this fragment in our author’s use of&nbsp;it is similar to that of xi. 1-2. The details defy at present&nbsp;any clear interpretation, but the incorporation of the fragment&nbsp;may be due in general to the emphasis it lays on the faithful&nbsp;witness, martyrdom and resurrection of the saints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">xf. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">14-19.—</span><span class="font2">The seventh trumpet, xi. 15, ushers in the third woe, xi. 14. Its contents are given in xii.-xx. In xi. 15-19 the&nbsp;seer hears great voices in heaven singing a triumphal song in&nbsp;anticipation of the victory that is speedily to be achieved. This&nbsp;song forms a prelude to the chapters that follow.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">xii.—</span><span class="font2">This is the most difficult chapter in the book. Its main intention in its present context is apparently to explain Satan’s&nbsp;dominion over the world and thc bitterness of his rage against&nbsp;the church and against Christ. Christ, indeed, escapes him and&nbsp;likewise the Jewish Christians (“ the woman,” xii. 16) but “ the&nbsp;rest of her seed,” xii. 17 (the Gentile Christians?), are exposed to&nbsp;his fury. But his time is at hand; together with his hosts he&nbsp;has been cast down from heaven, and on the earth he <sup>li</sup> hath but&nbsp;a short time.” The attribution of the seven heads and ten horns&nbsp;to the dragon, xii. 3, points forward to Rome, which is regarded&nbsp;as a temporary incarnation of Satan, xiii. 1, xvii. 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But, though a few of the leading thoughts of this chapter may be obvious, we are plunged into problems that all but defy&nbsp;solution when we essay to discover its origin or interpret its&nbsp;details. Most scholars are agreed that this chapter is not, except&nbsp;in the case of a few sentences, the work of our author. In&nbsp;other words, it has been taken over from pre-existing material—&nbsp;either Christian or Jewish—and the materials of which it is&nbsp;composed are ultimately derived from non-Jewish sources—&nbsp;either Babylonian, Greek or Egyptian—and bore therein very&nbsp;different meanings from those which belong to them in their&nbsp;present connexion. Furthermore, the materials are fragmentary&nbsp;and the order irregular.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2">) First of all, the chapter is not the free creation of a Christian writer. Such an one could never have so represented the life of Christ—a child persecuted by a dragon and carried off to&nbsp;God’s throne. No mention of Christ’s earthly life and crucifixion. Furthermore, the victory over Satan is ascribed to&nbsp;Michael. Again, a Christian could not represent Christ as the&nbsp;son of the wife of the sun-god; for such is the natural interpretation of the woman crowned with the twelve stars and&nbsp;with her feet upon the moon. Finally, even if &quot; the woman ”&nbsp;who is the mother of Christ be taken to be the ideal Israel in the&nbsp;beginning of the chapter, at its close she is clearly the Christian&nbsp;community founded by Him. We conclude, therefore, that the&nbsp;present chapter is not the work of our author. There are,&nbsp;however, traces of his hand. Thus 7-12, which is really a&nbsp;Jewish fragment recounting the victory of Michael over Satan,&nbsp;has to a certain degree been adapted to a Christian environment&nbsp;by the insertion of the 10b-11.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font2">) The order is not original. The flight of the woman is mentioned in verse 6 to a place of refuge prepared for her by&nbsp;God. Then comes an account of the casting down of Satan&nbsp;from heaven. Then again in 13-16 the flight of the woman&nbsp;is described. This fact has been variously accounted for by&nbsp;different critics. Wellhausen regards 1-6 and 7-14 as doublets,&nbsp;and differentiates two actions in the original account which are&nbsp;here confused. Spitta takes verse 6 to be an addition of the&nbsp;redactor, which describes prolepticafly what follows, while Gunkel&nbsp;sees in 6 and 7-16 parallel accounts. In any case we should&nbsp;probably agree with the contention of J. Weiss, supported by&nbsp;Bousset in the second edition of his commentary, that 7-12 is a&nbsp;fragment of a Jewish apocalypse, of which iob-n is an addition&nbsp;of our author. Next that 6 is a doublet of 13 sqq. What&nbsp;then is to be made of 1-5, 13-17? Different explanations have&nbsp;been offered. Gunkel@@<sup>3</sup> traces it to a Babylonian origin. He&nbsp;urges that an adequate explanation is impossible on thc assumption of a Jewish or Christian origin. At the base of this account&nbsp;lies the Babylonian myth of the birth of the sun-god Marduk,&nbsp;his escape from the dragon who knows him to be his destined&nbsp;destroyer, and the persecution of Marduk’s mother by the&nbsp;dragon. But GunkeFs explanation is an attempt to account&nbsp;for one </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ignotum per ignotius;</span><span class="font2"> for hitherto no trace of the myth&nbsp;of the sun-god’s birth and persecution and the flight into the&nbsp;wilderness has been found in Babylonian mythology. Moreover, Gunkel no longer lays emphasis on thc Babylonian, but&nbsp;merely on the mythical origin of the details. A more satisfactory explanation has been offered by Dieterich </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Abraxas,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">117 sqq.), who finds in this chapter an adaptation of the birth&nbsp;of Apollo and the attempt of the dragon Pytho to kill his mother</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>2</sup> The. linguistic evidence, as Bousset has pointed out, confirms the critical conclusion that xi. 1-13 were independent sources. For&nbsp;whereas in ix.-x. the verb almost regularly begins the sentence and&nbsp;object follows the verb, in xi. 1-13 the object frequently precedes&nbsp;the verb and the subject nearly always.
