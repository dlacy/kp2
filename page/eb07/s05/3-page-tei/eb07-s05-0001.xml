            <p>STEAM-ENGINE CONT of a good practical boiler, that, if one part should be damaged or
                give way, the whole should be so constructed that the damage done to that part must
                not endanger the rest. An extensive heating surface is to be obtained for economy’s
                sake ; but that large surface must at the same time remain unimpaired to resist
                bursting ; a property to a certain extent inconsistent with extensive surface. The
                surface which is thus spread as widely as possible, so as to apply the fire to the
                water through every part of its mass minutely and in great subdivisions, if extended
                beyond a certain degree, will not have over it a body of water capable of conducting
                heat from it with the rapidity adequate to the rapid generation of steam, and to the
                preservation of the intensely heated metal from the destructive action of the fire.
                Then, again, it is desirable to have long and tortuous flues, to extricate as much
                heat as possible from the fuel and the products of combustion ; but these, by their
                very length, may interfere with the draught of the chimney, so as to diminish the
                efficacy and vigour of the combustion of the fuel, and produce loss instead of gain.
                Thus it happens that the whole question of boilers is an exact and judicious
                combination and adjustment of parts, so as to obtain each of these many points in
                that degree which is most advantageous for every one of the other qualities, and of
                all of them together. The question is a practical one of no common difficulty.</p>
            <p>It is principally by the collection of facts, of accurately recorded statistics of
                boilers, of the practical experience of the most eminent engineers, that we can
                gather data for the solution of the question of the best boiler. We are not without
                such data, although it is much to be regretted that they are not so abundant as we
                should wish. We shall now examine the various points in the structure and functions
                of a boiler in a simple succession.</p>
            <p>The materials of which a boiler should be formed, have been a subject much discussed.
                Copper, iron, brass, cast- iron, lead, and even stone, have been employed. Boilere
                of steam-vessels are frequently made of copper. Many steam-boilers have been made of
                cast-iron, and have lasted long, and been very efficient under careful management.
                Wrought-iron-plate boilers are very common in this country ; and in America have
                been much used, with cast-iron ends or heads of considerable thickness. The boilers
                of locomotive engines have the interior, which is exposed to the direct impact of
                the flame, formed of copper, and sometimes partly of brass ; the exterior of the
                boiler being wrought-iron. Cast-iron boilers were extensively used under Mr Smeaton,
                towards the end of last century ; and when used with care, were employed with
                advantage where fuel was plentiful, from their cheapness. A stone exterior jointed
                with cement, the interior being copper, where subject to great heat, and when the
                steam has scarcely any greater pressure than the atmosphere, has also been employed
                ; and a dome or cupola of lead was often seen, in earlier times, when the art of
                working iron-plate was less common than it is now, forming the cover of the
                antiquated Hay-stack Boiler, which, in these times, the “ Waggon” of Watt has almost
                entirely removed out of use.</p>
            <p>Copper is the best of all substances for steam-engine boilers, in a mechanical point
                of view. That it is not best in a mercantile point of view, is proved by the almost
                universal use of wrought-iron boilers. Yet it is difficult to see why this should be
                the case, if we remember that copper lasts for ever, and is worth, when old, nearly
                two-thirds of its first cost, besides being a much better conductor of heat, and so
                saving fuel and space. The labour, too, of making a copper boiler is no greater than
                an iron one. The relative value of these materials for boilers may be stated thus
                ;—.</p>

            </table>
            <p>The combination of all these ratios is in favour of copper ; and if we add the
                trouble of replacing the new iron boiler, and detaching it from all its connexions,
                five times for once in the case of copper, the scale still further preponderates on
                the same side. We must look, therefore, for the explanation of the general use of
                iron to the state of mercantile affairs, and the value of money in a commercial
                community. It proves that a certain loss, within 15 or 20 years, in a proportion of
                12 to 1, is considered preferable to an original expenditure of four times the
                amount of capital ; showing either that the price of money is too high for such an
                investment, or that the contingencies of mercantile life are too great to allow the
                risk of so large a sum as the value of a copper boiler for the period required to
                reimburse the proprietor. Rich governments and individuals have not failed to profit
                by this knowledge ; but it may be noticed of a government which considers its tenure
                of office insecure, that it does not furnish even its war-steamers with copper
                boilers, as that would involve the expenditure of a large sum by which their
                successors would profit. So also the man who is shortened in means, but hopes to be
                rich enough by the time one boiler is done to get a new one ; or who does not know
                whether he shall be solvent so long as to see the boiler out ; or who, at any rate,
                cannot spare so much money at once—procures at once the cheapest boiler he can ; and
                finds, as usual, that in a short time the expenses of coal and of repairs have drawn
                from him a heavier than the usurer’s percentage. All this applies more peculiarly to
                steam-vessels.</p>
            <p>Another peculiarity of copper is the greater safety which arises from the uniformity
                of its texture. It is scarcely possible to account for the singular differences of
                sheets of iron that have passed nominally through the same processes of manufacture.
                One plate will become deteriorated by heat in half the time of another apparently
                identical. The parts of the same plate are frequently heterogeneous. The
                consequences of this heterogeneity are serious, and sometimes destructive : a single
                plate in a series gives way, and, having broken the chain of connexion, the whole
                fabric is destroyed ; or a latent crack developes itself in the place most difficult
                to restore ; or one plate, or a part of it, is burnt through when all the rest
                remains sound. All this tells in favour of copper. The matter of the copper is very
                nearly homogeneous : its durability is nearly uniform, if it is not made too thick.
                We have examined the part of a copper boiler exposed to most intense heat after
                years of action, and found, when the soot was cleared away, the smooth shining
                surface, produced by the rollers in the process of manufacture, remaining as perfect
                as the day after the boiler was started. In this case the metal was no more than
                one- eighth of an inch thick.</p>
            <p>There are some forms of boiler for which copper is less suitable than iron. The
                strength of copper to resist flexure is not nearly so great, especially at high
                temperatures, as that of iron. A copper boiler must therefore be well stayed, and if
                there be round, or any other unstayed flues in the boiler, they cannot be of more
                than a foot in diameter without incurring danger; they will readily collapse or
                bend. Thia caution in regard to</p>
