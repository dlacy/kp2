<p><span class="font0">RIDLEY (Nicholas), biſhop of London, and a martyr to the Reformation, was deſcended of an ancient family, and born in the beginning of the l6th&nbsp;century, at Wilmontſwick in Northumberland. From&nbsp;the grammar-ſchool at Newcaſtle upon Tyne, he was&nbsp;lent to Pembroke-hall in Cambridge, in the year 1518,&nbsp;where he was ſupported by his uncle Dr Robert Ridley, fellow of Queen’s college. In 1522 he took his&nbsp;firſt degree in arts ; two years after, was elected fellow ; and, in 1725, he commenced matter of arts.&nbsp;In 1527, having taken orders, he was lent by his&nbsp;uncle, for further improvement, to the Sorbonne at&nbsp;Paris ; from thence he went to Louvain, and continued&nbsp;abroad till the year 1529. On his return to Cambridge, he was choſen under-treaſurer of the univerſity ;&nbsp;and, in 1533. was elected ſenior proctor. He afterwards&nbsp;proceeded bachelor of divinity, and was choſen chaplain of the univerſity, orator, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">magijler glomeriœ.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">At this time he was much admired as a preacher and&nbsp;diſputant. He loſt his kind uncle in 1536 ; but was&nbsp;ſoon after patroniſed by Dr Cranmer, archbiſhop of&nbsp;Canterbury, who made him his domeſtic chaplain, and&nbsp;preſented him to the vicarage of Herne in Eaſt Kent ;&nbsp;where, we are told, he preached the doctrine of the&nbsp;Reformation. In 154'∙&gt;, having commenced doctor&nbsp;of divinity, he was made king’s chaplain ; and, in the&nbsp;iame year, was elected maſter of his college in Cambridge. Soon after, Ridley was collaced to a prebend&nbsp;in the church of Canterbury ; and it was not long before he was accuſed in the biſhop’s court, at the inſti-gation of biſhop Gardiner, of preaching againſt the&nbsp;doctrine of the Six Articles. The matter being referred to Cranmer, Ridley was acquitted. In 1545,&nbsp;he was made a prebendary of Weſtminſter abbey; in&nbsp;1547 was preſented, by the fellows of Pembroke-hall,&nbsp;to the living of Soham, in the dioceſe of Norwich ;&nbsp;and the ſame year was conſecrated biſhop of Rocheſter.&nbsp;In 1550 he was tranſlated to the ſee of London; in&nbsp;which year he was one of the commiſſioners for examining biſhop Gardiner, and concurred in his depri-- vation. In the year 1552, our prelate returning from&nbsp;Cambridge, unfortunately for himſelf, paid a viſit to&nbsp;the Princeſs, afterwards Queen Mary ; to whom,&nbsp;prompted by his zeal for reformation, he expreſſed&nbsp;himſelf with too much freedom ; for ſhe was ſcarce-ly ſeated on the throne when Ridley was doomed a&nbsp;victim to her revenge. With Cranmer and Latimer he&nbsp;was burnt alive at Oxford, on the 16th of October&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">355</span><span class="font0">j. He wrote, 1.

<p><span class="font0">RIGA, a large, ſtrong, populous, and rich town of the Ruffian empire, and capital of Livonia. It is&nbsp;a large trading place, and has a very conſiderable for-treſs ; the trade is chiefly in corn, ſkins, leather, and&nbsp;naval ſtores. It was taken by the Ruffians in 17 10,&nbsp;after they had blocked it up a long while, during which&nbsp;the inhabitants were afflicted with the plague. The&nbsp;caſtle is ſquare, and defended by four towers and fix&nbsp;battions ; beſides which, it has a fine arſenal. The&nbsp;Proteſtants have ſtill a handſome college here. It is.&nbsp;ſeated on a large plain on the river Dwina. E. Long.&nbsp;24. 25. N. Lat. 57. o.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIGGING </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oſα Ship,</span><span class="font0"> a general name given to all the ropes employed to ſupport the marts, and to extend&nbsp;or reduce the fails, or arrange them to the diſpoſition of&nbsp;the wind. The former, which are uſed to fuſtain the&nbsp;maſts, remain uſually in a fixed poſition, and are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ftanding rigging;</span><span class="font0"> ſuch are the ſhrouds, ſtays, and&nbsp;back∙ltays. The latter, whoſe office is to manage the&nbsp;ſails, by communicating with various blocks or pulleys, ſituated in different places of the maſts, yards,&nbsp;ſhrouds, &amp;c. are comprehended in the general term of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">running rigging ;</span><span class="font0"> ſuch are the braces, ſheets, haliards,&nbsp;clue-lines, brails, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In rigging a malt, the firſt thing uſually fixed upon its head is a circular w<sup>r</sup>reath or rope, called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gromet,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">collar,</span><span class="font0"> which is firmly beat down upon the top of&nbsp;the hounds. The intent of this is to prevent the ſhrouds&nbsp;from being fretted or worn by the treſtle-trees, or&nbsp;ſhoulders of the maſt ; after this are laid on the two&nbsp;pendants, ſrom whoſe lower ends the main or fore&nbsp;tackles are ſuſpended ; and next, the ſhrouds of the&nbsp;ſtarboard and larboard ſide, in pairs, alternately. The&nbsp;wiιole is covered by the ſtays, which are the largeſt&nbsp;ropes of the rigging.—When a yard is to be rigged,&nbsp;a gromet is alſo driven firſt on each of its extremities ;&nbsp;next to this are fitted on the horſes, the braces, and&nbsp;laſtly the lifts or top-ſail ſheet-blocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principal objects to be conſidered in rigging a ſhip, appear to be ſtrength, convenience, and ſimpli-city : or, the properties of affording ſufficient ſecurity&nbsp;to the maſts,. yards, and ſails ; of arranging the whole&nbsp;machinery in the moſt advantageous manner, to ſu-ſtain the maſts, and facilitate the management of the&nbsp;ſails ; and of avoiding perplexity, and rejecting whatever is ſuperfluous or unneceſſary. The perfection of&nbsp;this art, then, corſſiſts in retaining all thoſe qualities,&nbsp;and in preſerving a judicious medium between them.&nbsp;See Ship-building.</span></p>
