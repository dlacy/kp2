<p><span class="font1">On May 9, 1812, Napoleon left Paris for Dresden, and the Russian and French ambassadors received their&nbsp;passports. The grand army comprised 678,000 men,&nbsp;356,000 of them being French ; and, to oppose them, the&nbsp;Russians assembled 372,000 men. Napoleon crossed the&nbsp;Niemen and advanced by forced marches to Smolensk.&nbsp;Here he defeated the Russians, and again at the terrible&nbsp;battle of Borodino, and then entered Moscow, which had&nbsp;been abandoned by most of the inhabitants ; soon afterwards a fire broke out (probably caused by the order of&nbsp;Rostopchin the governor), which raged six days and&nbsp;destroyed the greater part of the city. Notwithstanding&nbsp;this disaster, Napoleon lingered five weeks among the&nbsp;ruins, endeavouring to negotiate a peace, which he seemed&nbsp;to think Alexander would be sure to grant ; but he had&nbsp;mistaken the spirit of the emperor and his people. On&nbsp;the 18th of October Napoleon reluctantly commenced his&nbsp;backward march. The weather was unusually severe, and&nbsp;the country all round had been devastated by the French&nbsp;on their march. With their ranks continually thinned by&nbsp;cold, hunger, and the skirmishes of the Cossacks who hung&nbsp;upon their rear, the French reached the Beresina, which&nbsp;they crossed near Studianka on the 26th-29th of November&nbsp;with great loss. The struggle on the banks of this river&nbsp;forms one of the most terrible pictures in history. At&nbsp;Smorgoni, between Vilna and Minsk, Napoleon left the&nbsp;army and hurried to Paris. Finally the wreck of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">grande armee</span><span class="font1"> under Ney crossed the Niemen. Not more&nbsp;than eighty thousand of the whole army are said to have&nbsp;returned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Frederick William III. of Prussia now issued a manifesto, and concluded an alliance with Russia for the reestablishment of the Prussian monarchy. In 1813 took place the battle of Dresden, and the so-called Battle of&nbsp;the Nations at Leipsic on October 16 and the two following days. In 1814 the Russians invaded France&nbsp;with the allies, and lost many men in the assault upon&nbsp;Paris. After the battle of Waterloo, and the conveyance&nbsp;of Napoleon to the island of St Helena, it fell to the&nbsp;Russian forces to occupy Champagne and Lorraine. In&nbsp;the same year Poland was re-established in a mutilated&nbsp;form, with a constitution which Alexander, who was&nbsp;crowned king, swore to observe. In 1825 the emperor&nbsp;died suddenly at Taganrog at the mouth of the Don, while&nbsp;visiting the southern provinces of his empire. He had&nbsp;added to the Russian dominions Finland, Poland,&nbsp;Bessarabia, and that part of the Caucasus which includes&nbsp;Daghestan, Shirvan, Mingrelia, and Imeretia. Much was&nbsp;done in this reign to improve the condition of the serfs.&nbsp;The Raskolniks were better treated ; many efforts were&nbsp;made to improve public education, and the universities of&nbsp;Kazan, Kharkoff, and St Petersburg were founded. One&nbsp;of the chief agents of these reforms was the minister&nbsp;Speranski, who for some time enjoyed the favour of the&nbsp;emperor, but he attacked so many interests by his measures&nbsp;that a coalition was formed against him. He was&nbsp;denounced as a traitor, and his enemies succeeded in&nbsp;getting him removed and sent as governor to Nijni-Novgorod. In 1819, when the storm raised against him&nbsp;had somewhat abated, he was appointed to the important&nbsp;post of governor of Siberia. In 1821 he returned to St&nbsp;Petersburg, but he never regained his former power. To&nbsp;the mild influence of Speranski succeeded that of Shishkoff,&nbsp;Novosiltzeff, and Arakcheeff. The last of these men made&nbsp;himself universally detested in Russia. He rose to great&nbsp;influence in the time of Paul, and managed to continue in&nbsp;favour under his son. Besides many other pernicious&nbsp;measures, it was to him that Russia owed the military&nbsp;colonies which were so unpopular and led to serious riots.&nbsp;The censorship of the press became much stricter, and&nbsp;many professors of liberal tendencies were dismissed from&nbsp;their chairs in the universities. The country was now&nbsp;filled with secret societies, and the emperor became gloomy&nbsp;and suspicious. In this condition of mind he died, a man&nbsp;thoroughly disenchanted and weary of life. He has been&nbsp;judged harshly by some authors; readers will remember&nbsp;that Napoleon said of him that he was false as a Byzantine&nbsp;Greek. To us he appears as a well-intentioned man,&nbsp;utterly unable to cope with the discordant elements around&nbsp;him. He had discovered that his life was a failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The heir to the throne according to the principles of succession recognized in Russia was Constantine, the second&nbsp;son of the emperor Paul, since Alexander left no children.&nbsp;But he had of his own free will secretly renounced his&nbsp;claim in 1822, having espoused a Roman Catholic, the&nbsp;Polish princess Julia Grudzinska. In consequence of this&nbsp;change in the devolution of the sovereign’s authority, the&nbsp;conspiracy of the Dekabrists @@<sup>1</sup> broke out at the end of the&nbsp;year, their object being to take advantage of the confusion&nbsp;caused by the alteration of the succession to get constitutional government in Russia. Their efforts failed, but&nbsp;the rebellion was not put down without great bloodshed.&nbsp;Five of the conspirators were executed, and a great many&nbsp;sent to Siberia. Some of the men implicated were among&nbsp;the most remarkable of their time in Russia, but the&nbsp;whole country had been long honeycombed with secret&nbsp;societies, and many of the Russian officers had learned&nbsp;liberal ideas while engaged in the campaign against Napoleon. So ignorant, however, were the common people of&nbsp;the most ordinary political terms that when told to shout&nbsp;for Constantine and the constitution </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(constitutziα)</span><span class="font1"> they&nbsp;naively asked if the latter was Constantine’s wife. The&nbsp;new emperor, Nicholas, the next brother in succession,&nbsp;showed throughout his reign reactionary tendencies ; all&nbsp;liberalism was sternly repressed. In 1830 appeared the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Complete Collection of the Laws of the Russian Empire,<sub>&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font1">which Nicholas had caused to be codified. He partly&nbsp;restored the right of primogeniture which had been taken&nbsp;away by the empress Anna as contrary to Russian usages,&nbsp;allowing a father to make his eldest son his sole heir. In&nbsp;spite of the increased severity of the censorship of the&nbsp;press, literature made great progress in his reign. From&nbsp;1826 to 1828 Nicholas was engaged in a war with Persia,&nbsp;in which the Russians were completely victorious, having&nbsp;beaten the enemy at Elizabetpol, and again under Paskewitch&nbsp;at Javan Bulak. The war was terminated by the peace&nbsp;of Turkmantchai (February 22, 1828), by which Persia&nbsp;ceded to Russia the provinces of Erivan and Nakhitchevan,&nbsp;and paid twenty millions of roubles as an indemnity. The&nbsp;next foreign enemy was Turkey. Nicholas had sympathized with the Greeks in their struggle for independence,&nbsp;in opposition to the policy of Alexander ; he had also a&nbsp;part to play as protector of the Orthodox Christians, who&nbsp;formed a large number of the sultan’s subjects. In consequence of the sanguinary war which the Turks were&nbsp;carrying on against the Greeks and the utter collapse of&nbsp;the latter, England, France, and Russia signed the treaty&nbsp;of London in 1827, by which they forced themselves upon&nbsp;the belligerents as mediators. From this union resulted&nbsp;the battle of Navarino (October 20, 1827), in which the&nbsp;Turkish fleet was annihilated by that of the allies.&nbsp;Nicholas now pursued the war with Turkey on his own&nbsp;account ; in Asia Paskewitch defeated two Turkish armies,&nbsp;and conquered Erzeroum, and in Europe Diebitsch defeated&nbsp;the grand vizier. The Russians crossed the Balkans and&nbsp;advanced to Adrianople, where a treaty was signed in 1829&nbsp;very disadvantageous to Turkey.</span></p>
