<p><span class="font2">In the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Proposals for an Economical and Secure Currency </span><span class="font2">(1816) he first disposes of the chimera of a currency without&nbsp;a specific standard, and pronounces in favour of a single metal,&nbsp;with a preference for silver, as the standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ricardo’s chief work, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Principles of Political Economy and Taxation,</span><span class="font2"> appeared in 1817. The fundamental doctrine of this&nbsp;work is that, on the hypothesis of free competition, exchange&nbsp;value is determined by the labour expended in production,—&nbsp;a proposition not new, nor, except with considerable limitation&nbsp;and explanation, true, and of little practical use, as “ amount&nbsp;of labour ” is a vague expression, and the thing intended&nbsp;is incapable of exact estimation. Ricardo’s theory of distribution has been briefly enunciated as follows: “ (1) The&nbsp;demand for food determines the margin of cultivation;&nbsp;(2) this margin determines rent; (3) the amount necessary to&nbsp;maintain the labourer determines wages; (4) the difference&nbsp;between the amount produced by a given quantity of labour&nbsp;at the margin and the wages of that labour determines profit.”&nbsp;These theorems are too absolutely stated, and require much&nbsp;modification to adapt them to real life. His theory of foreign&nbsp;trade has been embodied in the two propositions: “ (1) International values are not determined in the same way as domestic&nbsp;values; (2) the medium of exchange is distributed so as to&nbsp;bring trade to the condition it would be in if it were conducted&nbsp;by barter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A considerable portion of the work is devoted to a study of taxation, which requires to be considered as a part of the&nbsp;problem of distribution. A tax is not always paid by those&nbsp;on whom it is imposed; it is therefore necessary to determine&nbsp;the ultimate, as distinguished from the immediate, incidence&nbsp;of every form of taxation. Smith had already dealt with&nbsp;this question; Ricardo develops and criticizes his results.&nbsp;The conclusions at which he arrives are in the main as follows:&nbsp;a tax on raw produce falls on the consumer, but will also&nbsp;diminish profits; a tax on rents on the landlord; taxes on&nbsp;houses will be divided between the occupier and the ground&nbsp;landlord; taxes on profits will be paid by the consumer, and&nbsp;taxes on wages by the capitalist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1819 Ricardo, having retired from business and become a landed proprietor, entered parliament as member for&nbsp;Portarlington. He was at first diffident and embarrassed in&nbsp;speaking, but gradually overcame these difficulties, and was&nbsp;heard with much attention and deference, especially when&nbsp;he addressed the House on economic questions. He probably&nbsp;contributed in a considerable degree to bringing about the&nbsp;change of opinion on the question of free trade which ultimately led to the legislation of Sir Robert Peel on that&nbsp;subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1820 he contributed to the supplement of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica</span><span class="font2"> (6th ed.) an “ Essay on the Funding System.” In this&nbsp;besides giving an historical account (founded on Dr Robert&nbsp;Hamilton’s valuable work </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">On the National Debt,</span><span class="font2"> 1813, 3rd ed.,&nbsp;1818) of the several successive forms of the sinking fund, he&nbsp;urges that nations should defray their expenses, whether&nbsp;ordinary or extraordinary, at the time when they are incurred,&nbsp;instead of providing for them by loans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1822 he published a tract </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">On Protection to Agriculture, </span><span class="font2">which is an able application to controversy of the general&nbsp;principles laid down in his systematic work. Its arguments&nbsp;and conclusions are therefore subject to the same limitations&nbsp;which those fundamental principles require.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Plan for the Establishment of a National Bank,</span><span class="font2"> published posthumously in 1824, he proposes that the issue of the paper&nbsp;currency should be taken out of the hands of the Bank of&nbsp;England and vested in commissioners appointed by the&nbsp;government. The tract describes in detail the measures to&nbsp;be adopted for the introduction and working of the system.&nbsp;A certain step towards realizing the objects of his scheme,&nbsp;though on different lines from Ricardo’s, was taken in Sir&nbsp;Robert Peel’s act of 1844, by which the discount business&nbsp;of the bank was separated from the issue department.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ricardo died on the 11th of September 1823, at his seat (Gatcomb Park) in Gloucestershire, from a cerebral affection&nbsp;resulting from disease of the ear. James Mill, who was intimately acquainted with him, says (in a letter to Napier of&nbsp;November 1818) that he knew not a better man, and on the&nbsp;occasion of his death published a highly eulogistic notice of&nbsp;him in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Chronicle.</span><span class="font2"> A lectureship on political&nbsp;economy, to exist for ten years, was founded in commemoration&nbsp;of him, M'Culloch being chosen to fill it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In forming a general judgment respecting Ricardo, we must have in view not so much the minor writings as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Principles,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">in which his economic system is expounded as a whole. By a&nbsp;study of this work we are led to the conclusion that he was&nbsp;an economist only, not at all a social philosopher in the wider&nbsp;sense, like Adam Smith or John Mill. He had great acuteness,&nbsp;but little breadth. For any large treatment of moral and&nbsp;political questions he seems to have been alike by nature and&nbsp;preparation unfitted; and there is no evidence of his having&nbsp;had any but the most ordinary and narrow views of the great&nbsp;social problems. He shows no trace of that hearty sympathy&nbsp;with the working classes which breaks out in several passages&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wealth of Nations</span><span class="font2">; we ought, perhaps, with Held, to&nbsp;regard it as a merit in Ricardo that he does not cover with&nbsp;fine phrases his deficiency in warmth of social sentiment.&nbsp;The idea of the active capitalist having any duties towards&nbsp;his employés never seems to occur to him; the labourer is,&nbsp;in fact, merely an instrument in the hands of the capitalist,&nbsp;a pawn in the game he plays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He first introduced into economics on a great scale the method of deduction from a priori assumptions. The conclusions so arrived at have often been treated as if they were&nbsp;directly applicable to real life, and indeed to the economic&nbsp;phenomena of all times and places. But the truth of Ricardo’s&nbsp;theorems is now by his warmest admirers admitted to be&nbsp;hypothetical only. Bagehot seems right in believing that&nbsp;Ricardo himself had no consciousness of the limitations to which&nbsp;his doctrines are subject. Be this as it may, we now see that&nbsp;the only basis on which these doctrines could be allowed to&nbsp;stand as a permanent part of economic science is that on which&nbsp;they are placed by Roscher, namely, as a stage in the preparatory&nbsp;work of the economist, who, beginning with such abstractions,&nbsp;afterwards turns from them, not in practice merely, but in the&nbsp;completed theory, to real life and men as they actually are or&nbsp;have been.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The criticisms to which Ricardo’s general economic scheme is open do not hold with respect to his treatment of the subjects&nbsp;of currency and banking. These form precisely that branch&nbsp;of economics into which moral ideas (beyond the plain prescriptions of honesty) can scarcely be said to enter, and where&nbsp;the operation of purely mercantile principles is most immediate&nbsp;and invariable. They w<sup>e</sup>re, besides, the departments of the&nbsp;study to which Ricardo’s early training and practical habits&nbsp;led him to give special attention; and they have a lasting&nbsp;value independent of his systematic construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ricardo’s collected works were published, with a notice </span><span class="font2">of his </span><span class="font1">life and writings, by J. R. M'Culloch in 1846.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Principles</span><span class="font1"> have been edited (with an introduction, bibliography and notes) by E. C. K. Conner, 1891. See also </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Letters to H. Trower and Others,</span><span class="font1"> ed. J. Bonar and J. H. Hollander, 1899;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Letters to J. R. M'Culloch,</span><span class="font1"> ed. J. H. Hollander, 1895; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Letters to&nbsp;T. R. Malthus,</span><span class="font1"> ed. J. Bonar, 1887. A French translation of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Principles</span><span class="font1"> by Constancio, with notes by Say, appeared in 1818;&nbsp;the whole works, translated by Constancio and Fonteyraud, form&nbsp;vol. xiii. (1847) of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collection des principaux économistes,</span><span class="font1"> where&nbsp;they are accompanied by the notes of Say, Malthus, Sismondi,&nbsp;Rossi, &amp;c. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Principled</span><span class="font1"> was first “ naturalized ” in Germany,&nbsp;says Roscher (though another version by Von Schmid had previously appeared), by Edward Baumstark in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">David Ricardo’s&nbsp;Grundgesetze der Volkswirthschaft und der Besteuerung übersetzt&nbsp;und erläutert</span><span class="font1"> (1837), which Roscher highly commends, not only&nbsp;for the excellence of the rendering, but for the value of the explanations and criticisms which are added.</span></p>
