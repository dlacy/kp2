makes to the real eccentricities of manner and uncouthness of person in Socrates, the points on which he desires to fix the attention of the theatre. It is the important modification of the Athenian character, under a system of education which had now reached its maturity. Under the administration of Pericles, that system had already infected the policy of the state, and perverted its courts of justice into sinks of corruption and oppression. Now, at length, it was found domesticated at Athens in the sanctuary of private life. An Athenian had appeared in the character of a professor of philosophy ; and around him were gathered citizens of all ranks, from the noble youth who aspired to the helm of the state, and the wealthy patron of literature, to the mean artizan who worked at the forge, and the drudge of the market. What was further to be observed now, was, that the system came recommended by the eloquence of lively and exciting conversation. And how powerful must have been such conversation, as it came forth from the lips of the speaker in the elegant and terse Attic idiom ! It was no wonder, therefore, that the comic poet should have seized this moment for portraying the danger which he anticipated to his country from the fashionable education of the day, and thrown all the force of his ridicule on the most attractive form in which it then presented itself, as displayed in the personal teaching and example of Socrates.</p><p>The testimony of Plato is to the same effect. Plato has not given us an exact portrait of Socrates any more than Aristophanes has ; for he has evidently transferred to the Socrates of his Dialogues, not less of his own cast of mind and manner, than Aristophanes did to the Socrates of his comedy, of the general tone of the sophists. And this is to be accounted for, as in the case of Aristophanes, from the fact, that Plato regarded Socrates as the impersonation of the philosophy of the times. He felt that, to give his own doctrines a proper authority and weight, he could not employ a more effectual organ than the tongue of him who had first given to philosophy an Attic expression, and from whom it would henceforth derive its proper Grecian character.</p><p>But though the drama of “ The Clouds” was unsuccessful as an attack on Socrates, if it were intended as such, or as an attack on the sophists under the name of Socrates, which is the more probable view of its design, it must not be supposed that the play produced no effect unfavourable to Socrates. The tradition, that Aristophanes was employed by Anytus and Melitus to write down Socrates, does not seem altogether without reason ; though it can hardly be literally true, when we look to the distance of time which intervened between the production of the play and the accusation. In the <hi rend="italic">Apology</hi> of Plato there is an allusion to the prejudice excited in the young men by the representation given of the philosopher in this play. Nor had “The Clouds” been the only attack on Socrates by Aristophanes ; not to mention other comic writers who had made him the object of their humour. In the year 405, not more than five years before the prosecution, the play of “ The Frogs” had been exhibited, in which a pointed allusion is made to the influence of Socrates in terms of reprobation.<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Aristoph. Ranæ, 1487.</p></note> In the mean time, also, the same note had been struck ; for the play of “The Birds” was produced in the middle of this</p><p>interval between “The Clouds” and “The Frogs,” in the year 414 ; and in that again the Athenians are warned against the corruptions and enchantments of the philosopher.<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Aristoph.

Mem. iii. 5, the younger Pericles asks Socrates how the Athenians are to be brought again to become enamoured of their ancient virtue, glory, and happiness ; and afterwards he expresses his wonder how the state ever began to decline. Socrates imputes their degeneracy to their neglect of the institutions of their ancestors. The particulars mentioned are, want of respect to elders, neglect of bodily exercises, even to the ridicule of them, insubordination to authorities, mutual irritation, envy, quarrelsomeness, litigation, covetousness, incompetence of their generals.</p></note> * During all this time Socrates continued the unrivalled teacher of the youth of Athens; increasing, indeed, in renown and popularity ; and surrounded by a number of students of philosophy and political science from all parts of Greece. He had, in fact, converted Athens into a university of Greece. For though he had no professed school,—no <hi rend="italic">φροvτιστήριov,</hi> as Aristophanes jocosely represents the scene of Socrates amongst his disciples,—no regular place of meeting, such as Plato had in the Academia, and Aristotle in the Lyceum ;—there might be seen around him in familiar conversation, in every part of the city, day after day, the statesmen, and orators, and generals of the republic,—philosophers of established repute from other cities,—the sons of the noblest families of Athens as well as of the humblest citizens,—and the resident foreigners and occasional visitors of the city ; some seeking instruction in the art of government, some investigating by his guidance the chief good of man, some studying the theory of eloquence and criticism, some exploring, by the light of his searching questions, the depth of metaphysics, and the subtile speculations of the earlier philosophers; all according to their different pursuits, and in their different degrees, receiving information and general mental culture from the great Athenian sage. Those who clung to the thought of Athens in its days of military glory and empire, would pain- fully observe how great a change had taken place in the internal habits of the city. Formerly it was enough for the intellectual improvement of the youth, that in childhood he had the grammarian for his instructor, and as he grew up to manhood, was consigned to the poets;<note anchored="true" n="5" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* If we except the profession of the Sophists, when at its height of public favour, skill in the composition of tragedy was the most highly rewarded of all talents at Athens.

From that time, however, a change, introduced by the literary taste of Pisistratus, had gradually prepared the way for establishing a school of philosophy at Athens.<note anchored="true" n="8" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> I</hi> Aul.

In the midst of his active political life, he could find time and thought for the elaborate disquisitions of the ingenious persons whom he invited to him. He could spend a whole day in disputing with Protagoras on so subtile a question as the theory of causation;<note anchored="true" n="9" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• Plutarch iu Pericl. Op. i. p. 665.</p></note> such was the intense interest which he displayed in every thing tending to the development of mental energy, and such the encouragement he gave to the change of taste then in progress by his own example. In the person of Socrates was found the genius formed to preside over the growing taste for literary and philosophical refinement, and to give it the form of an established institution. What, therefore, were merely indefinite fears at the time of the exhibition of “ The Clouds,” assumed a more distinct character of alarm to ancient prejudices within a quarter of a century afterwards. The rapidity and violence of several successive revolutions of the government during the latter part of that interval, further prepared the minds of the people for any sudden outbreaks of party spirit, and made every man an object of suspicion to his neighbour. A democracy of an hundred years’ existence<note anchored="true" n="10" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>» Thucyd. viii. 68.</p></note> ’ had been overthrown, and first an oligarchy of four hundred, then a tyranny of thirty, established by foreign arms, in its place. Nor, as it had not been without fraud and bloodshed that the people had been spoiled of their “ ancient liberty,”<note anchored="true" n="11" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Thucyd. viii. 71, 72.</p></note> * were they disposed to surrender it in quiet; or were those who seized on the government able to retain it long on the same footing. A struggle ensued ; in which the individuals of contending parties only sought to provide, each for his own aggrandizement and interest, or at least his own safety, under the constant expectation of some counter-revolution.<note anchored="true" n="12" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Thucyd. iii. 82. <hi rend="italic superscript"> ι</hi> <hi rend="italic">rarrωr i'aùrùn</hi> a'rar, x.r.λ.</p></note> The people had found that some of those very pcrsons who would never have been suspected of oligarchical views, had in the late changes taken part against the popular government, so that they knew not, at last, whom to trust even of themselves.<note anchored="true" n="13" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> Thucyd. viii. 66.</p></note> ® We are not to wonder that an accusation of Socrates should have succeeded before an Athenian jury at this period of morbid sensitiveness of the public mind.</p><p>An accusation of impiety was, we must remember, too, an accusation of a political offence. A change of the popular religion was a change of the fundamental constitution of a Greek state. And as in the absolute rule of a single despot, so in the tyranny of a multitude, the reputation of zeal for religion is studiously maintained from policy, if from no higher motive, to throw around its arbitrary acts the reverence and fear due to the religious character. The teaching of Socrates was indeed eminently religious, but it differed from what the state regarded as such. He proved the existence of an invisible divine power, wisely designing and governing all things, and inculcated the duties of piety and morality as flowing from the belief of such an agency. Such clearly was not the state-religion.<note anchored="true" n="14" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Aristotle, Pol. v. 9.</p></note> This was no system of truth or morality. It was tradition and legend, and immemorial usage, and ritual observance.<note anchored="true" n="15" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Cic. de Legib. ii. 16.</p></note> And it was enough for a charge of impiety that Socrates rested religion on other</p><p>grounds. A pious Athenian, and yet not pious after the manner of the Athenians, was, in their view, an introducer of new gods. He might well be believed to be a worshipper of the clouds and the air, when he pointed out to them, that the gods would not receive the sacrifice offered by wicked men,<note anchored="true" n="16" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenoph. Mem. i. 3.</p></note> that even their silent counsels were not concealed from the divine cognizance, and that justice was an indispensable duty of the worshipper of the gods.<note anchored="true" n="17" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenoph. i. 6.</p></note></p><p>That the accusation further should be credible, as brought in this form, is not strange, when it is known that, during the Peloponnesian war, the worship of new gods had been introduced into the city; as at Rome during the depression of its fortunes in the first years of the second Punic war. So greatly had the vicissitudes of fortune influenced the minds of men, observes Livy, describing this effect,—so great was the influx of religion, and that chiefly foreign, into the state,—that either the men or the gods appeared to have suddenly become different.<note anchored="true" n="18" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> II</hi> Liv.

The strong reproof which Euripides puts into the mouth of Theseus, of the austere life of Hippolytus, would seem to point at some ascetic devotees among the Athenians themselves, practising a more refined and scrupulous religion, distinct from that of the vulgar ;</p><p>"Ηδη rt⅛ <hi rend="italic">aυ%eι, xa∣ iι</hi> ά·ψό;/οο <hi rend="italic">βog3,i</hi> 2iτB∕ς xαtr⅞λευ, <hi rend="italic">t)ξf&gt;ιa</hi> r âraxr’ sχu&gt;r,</p><p>Baxjrrvs, τολλϊν <hi rend="italic">γgaμψMm&gt; npΛt</hi> ζασνούί·<note anchored="true" n="19" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>&gt;· Euripid.

The state took in hand its youthful citizens, and trained them according to its peculiar institutions, and in its own spirit. At least, in all the early constitutions, great attention was paid to education. Lycurgus made Sparta a constant school of war to his citizens. So too Solon, though he had, with greater knowledge of human nature than Lycurgus, adapted his institutions to the people for whom he legislated, provided that the people should be trained to the system of laws prescribed to them. But this care of the early legislators had begun to be lost sight of in practice.<note anchored="true" n="21" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lysimachus, in the Laches, complains of their fathers having neglected their education, &lt;iπ <hi rend="italic">i&gt;fuit ∕∙&lt;∙&lt;&gt; t"ut rζvφS.,</hi> p. 182.

Pericles, flattering the democratic spirit of the Athenians of his day, could boast of their ease from labours and the obligation of exercises, and congratulate them on the courage which they could display at the time of action, without being inured beforehand by a course of hardy discipline.<note anchored="true" n="23" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Thucyd. ii. 39.</p></note> But now, whilst the state was remiss in not enforcing education according to its ancient system, a new system had grown up, the offspring of the luxury and refinement of its days of imperial greatness. This new and unauthorized education was diffused throughout the mass of the inhabitants beyond the pale of the citizens. Solon’s law imposed the duties of<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0520.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0453"/>
the exercises on the citizens, but excluded the slaves from the gymnasium. Now all classes were hearers of the philosopher ; the smith, the carpenter, the fuller, the dresser of leather, were engaged in discussing problems of ethics and politics, no less than the high-born and wealthy citizen, and the orator, and the statesman, and the general. This was an evident indication of a corresponding change in the government itself a change, which really came to maturity not long after the time of Socrates, when the machinery of the government passed from the hands of the generals and the men of practical ability, into those of the orators of the republic, and when rhetoric, or oratory, became the master science, and only another name for politics.<note anchored="true" n="24" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristot.

They would now, as they watched his increasing influence and reputation, recal their early associations of the ludicrous with the name of Socrates, not with the good humour with which they were originally received, but with the undefined fears since acquired, in the course of their daily observation, of one in whose hands the destinies of their country seemed to be placed. They would probably then think that they had judged his case too leniently before as spectators, and that they were now called upon to pronounce authoritatively as judges, not so much from the representations and arguments of the. accusers, as from their own experience of the great change which their country had evidently undergone, and was still undergoing. Even indeed at the time of trial, nearly half of the great body of jurors were in favour of his acquittal ; and Melitus would have failed altogether, but for the speeches of Anytus and Lycon, men of popular and rhetorical powers, who addressed the court in support of the charge ; so strongly did the weight of his personal character, and the interest which he had excited by his friendly and instructive intercourse with every class of citizens, prevail in his favour.</p><p>We should take into account, further, the general neutrality of Socrates on questions of politics, and his decisive energy on particular political occasions, in which he was called upon by the circumstances of his position to take part. Both lines of conduct would create enemies. Neutrality in a state distracted with parties is the most unpopular course which can be adopted ; however candid and reasonable the principle of such conduct may be, all parties, look with jealousy at one who will not be associated with them in the guilt and the danger of party-struggles. They envy him his exemption from their violence, his reputation of candour, his safety under every vicissitude of party-ascendancy. Corcyra, as a state, was obnoxious to the other states of Greece for its neutral policy. So was the individual at Athens who kept aloof from public business, amidst that restless pragmatical spirit which actuated the state and its citizens. Athenians could not understand and appreciate the motives of one who abstained from the public assemblies, and the courts, and the theatres,—who shrank from all public offices,—was a member of no faction or club,—engaged in no trade,—disregarded even his own domestic concerns,—and</p><p>lived a private man, where every one else was the servant of the public, busy with the affairs of the state, and incessantly pushing his own interests by his political activity.<note anchored="true" n="25" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Thucyd. ii. 40. <hi rend="italic">in ∏ ret; ai∣ro∣( eixsieit άμα xal πeλιrιxωt erιμiλtιa,</hi> xα∕ irifo∕ς &lt;rfif <hi rend="italic">ieγa τιτςαμμηοις</hi> rβ troλmxa μ∙ιj srisj; <hi rend="italic">γtenar μettι γάο rit ri μηiit rùtii μtrtχetra</hi> oùx <hi rend="italic">aπξaγμeta</hi> βλλ’ <hi rend="italic">aχgtmt teμιζeμn,</hi></p></note> The laws of Solon indeed inculcated the principle, that every one should take his side in the contention of parties.<note anchored="true" n="26" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Plutarch, Solon, 20, tom. i. p. 354, ed. Reiske.</p></note> Solon wished, to interest the people in the maintenance of the constitution which he had given them ; and accordingly, obliged them by penalties to attend to public affairs. This was evidently his reason for compelling their attendance in the assemblies and courts, as also for this singular provision. The increased action of the democratic spirit in the time of Socrates must have greatly fostered the opinion thus declared in their ancient laws. And thus we find philosophers in general held in disrepute at Athens, on account of their inactivity and unconcern in public affairs. The busy sophist, the orator, and the man of the world, censured them as pusillanimous, and indolent, and incapable of the duties of a citizen. Some of the early philosophers, indeed, had been distinguished as statesmen, and legislators, and generals. The Pythagoreans in Magna Græcia appear still to have sustained this character in some measure. But now philosophers were observed, for the most part, to lead a contemplative life of leisure, and to present a striking contrast to the general society of Grecian states. Plato takes every opportunity in his writings of defending philosophy from this calumny directed against the persons of its votaries, evidently treating it as a grievance which he had felt in his own case. Aristotle also indicates the prevalence of the same objection against philosophers at his day, when he studiously maintains that exertions of the mind in mere speculation are to be regarded as even more really practical than those which are directed to external results.<note anchored="true" n="27" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristot.

But he was content, in reply, to point to the number whom he had laboured to render capable of public duties, as a more effectual service on his part to the state, than a mere personal activity.</p><p>But though the general conduct of Socrates was to avoid all interference in affairs of state, he had shewn on one or two very important occasions his patriotic feeling, and the energy with which he could carry it into effect. He had served with distinguished courage at Potidæa, Amphipolis, and Delium, as we have seen ; and proved himself, on those hard-fought days, one who, as Pericles characterizes the Athenians, could philosophize without effeminacy, and, without being inured to the dangers of the field, could brave them at the moment of trial with no diminished spirit. But still greater occasions of trial were those of civil exertion at home, to which he was called not long before the accusation of impiety. Perhaps one of the most memorable instances of resolute firmness which history presents, is to be observed in the fact, that when the uproar of faction was demanding the iniquitous condemnation of the generals who commanded at Arginusæ, Socrates stood alone among his colleagues in office, and refused to put the question to the vote, as the epistates, or superintendent of the<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0521.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0454"/>

He alludes in the same place to the story of Leon.</p></note> Each of the ten Athenian tribes had its turn of presidency in the council of Five Hundred for thirty-six days of the year ; fifty out of the whole tribe being chosen by lot as its representatives during this period. These fifty were further subdivided into tens ; and each of these tens, under the name of proëdri, served a week in succession, as it was allotted, until the official term of the tribe was completed. Again, of these ten presidents, seven were appointed by lot, to occupy the chair in succession during their week of office ; each one of the seven becoming in his turn epistates, or superintendent for a day. The tribe Antiochis, to which Socrates belonged, happened to be the presiding tribe on the occasion of the impeachment of the generals ; and it came to the lot of Socrates to be in the chair of office on the day when the question of their condemnation was so passionately debated. The generals had nobly done their duty to their country, and gained the most brilliant victory which had been achieved at sea in the course of the war by the Athenian arms. But the crisis was an unfortunate one for them. Athens was then on the verge of ruin. The jealousy of parties was at its height. The hopelessness of recovering the lost ground by military strength at this time, gave an opening and encouragement to personal intrigue, and the arts of an unscrupulous diplomacy ; and a victory, however honourable to their arms, and hopeful as to the future, seems only to have been hailed with very doubtful congratulations by the struggling factions of the city; each looking at it rather as it might act for or against his party,—as it might tend to the strength of his rivals or their depression,—than as a great public triumph. However this may be, for the event remains a matter of perplexity to the historian, the successful generals were brought to trial through the treachery of their own officers, on the specious charge of having neglected the collecting of the dead bodies of their men after the action.<note anchored="true" n="30" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Thucyd. ii. Plat. Apol. 28.</p></note> The charge was specious, because it was partly true, and was attested indeed by the very officers who were sent by them on that service, and who were now brought as witnesses against their commanders. It was true, so far as the endeavour to collect the dead bodies had been frustrated by a violent storm which followed the engagement. Still the endeavour had been made. The charge was further specious, because it appealed to religious prejudices, as well as to the democratic spirit. The generals seemed to have been regardless of the solemn rites due to the dead, and of the persons and feelings of the lower orders of the people. The occasion therefore furnished abundant topic of invective to the demagogues ; and their addresses too fatally succeeded in obtaining an ungrateful and factious vote of death against the generals. Socrates was threatened with criminal information by the orators of the people; and the people themselves were urging on his assailants, and clamouring against him. Still he remained unmoved, and would not put the unjust question to the vote ; preferring the hazard of bonds and death to himself, on the side of the law and right, to a compliance with the popular will in an illegal act.<note anchored="true" n="31" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>» Plato, Gorgias.</p></note> The iniquity was perpetrated ultimately in spite of his resistance ; but he at least did his utmost to prevent it.</p><p>Such was his conduct under the ascendancy of the democratic power. Afterwards, when the oligarchy was established, and the Thirty were exercising their acts of cruelty and extortion without restraint, he was the first to give a check to their tyranny. In their career of confiscation and</p><p>blood, they marked out Leon of Salamis for destruction. They conceived that the terror of their power would compel even Socrates to be a ready instrument to their rapacity ; and they were desirous also doubtless to implicate him in the criminality of the act. Accordingly, they appointed him with four others to go to Salamis, and bring Leon to Athens, that he might be put to death. They were disappointed, however, in their expectation, so far as they depended on Socrates as an instrument in the dark deed. The order was executed, and the unhappy Leon was sacrificed to their cruel avarice and fears. But Socrates had no hand in it, and resisted it as far as he could. Unawed by their stern command, he said nothing, but as soon as he had left the Tholus, the place where the Thirty were assembled, he left his four colleagues to proceed on their bloody errand and went home. He would not, indeed, have dared thus to disobey the order with impunity ; he would surely have felt their vengeance ;—for there is nothing that tyrants resent more than a clemency volunteered by the ministers of their cruelties,<note anchored="true" n="32" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Herodot.

It is quite evident, too, that such a spirit as that displayed in these remarkable instances, had he entered into political life, would have subjected him to violent collisions with the successive leaders of party at Athens. “ You well know, Athenians,” are the words which Plato’s “Apology” puts into his mouth, “ that had I long ago attempted to take part in political affairs, I should long ago have perished, and I should neither have done yon any service nor myself. And be not aggrieved with me for saying the truth. For there is no one of men that can be safe, in giving a spirited opposition either to you or to any other popular government, and in preventing the occurrence of many unjust and iniquitous things in the state ; but he that would in reality fight for the right, must, if he would be safe but a little while, lead a private life and not engage in public business.”<note anchored="true" n="35" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Plato, Apol. 31, 32.</p></note> “ Think you, indeed,” he further asks, “ that I should have lived for so many years, had I engaged in public business ; and had I, engaging in it in a manner becoming a good man, succoured the cause of right, and, as behoved me, made that the thing of greatest consequence ?

He had hitherto avoided the impending storm by the quiet tenour of his private life. But he had done enough to offend the partizans of either extreme in the state. Both extremes would be united against him in their enmity to all moderation ; for the ascendancy of such counsels as his, would have been a death-blow to their own reckless lust of power. Hence, they were readily disposed to concur in sacrificing him to their mutual resentments. And we thus behold<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0522.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0455"/>
the sad spectacle of one who had been the friend of every poor man at Athens, no less than of the rich and noble, requited with prosecution and death by those very hands conjoined in the unnatural act, which each should have warded off the blow inflicted by the other. The genius of Intolerance was indeed behind the scene, mixing the poisoned cup for its destined victim. But the actors on the public stage of the trial were, at the same time, wreaking their own vengeance on a political opponent ; and the more exasperated against him, in proportion as, by his imperturbable demeanour and real inoffensiveness, he seemed to defy their assaults, and to throw them back on the consciousness of their injustice and ingratitude towards him.</p><p>Nor can there be any doubt, that there were many individuals, whose pride he had hurt, whose ignorance he had exposed, whose ill-humour he bad irritated, and who, such is the infirmity of human nature, would rejoice in the opportunity of revenge by the verdict of a public condemnation of his doctrine. In affronting the sophists by his free discussions of their pretensions, he had excited, doubtless, the hostility of many of the higher order of citizens, their patrons and disciples. Many fathers of families too must then have been suffering from that corruption of public morals which, under the teaching of the sophists, had clothed itself with plausibilities of argument, and impudently arrogated, for its vain pretensions, the importance of philosophy. Disobedient, profligate sons, lifting their hands against their fathers, and adding bitterness to their unnatural rebellion, by the hollow false-hearted principles upon which they had learned to justify it,—forward, petulant youths, insulting the dignity of age by their pretensions to superior wisdom, and their turbulence,—these were the fruits of sophistical education, which came home to every family at Athens. Few that felt the evil in their own homes, would stop to inquire whether Socrates was the teacher whom they had to blame for their suffering. Most would hastily conclude, that all such instruction of the young was pernicious, and their offence at the mischievous doctrine of the sophists would become a disgust to philosophy and philosophers.</p><p>Some, indeed, would distinctly trace to Socrates the annoyance which they had experienced from particular individuals. There were many who had frequented the society of Socrates, with no sincere intention of profiting by his lessons,—who observed his inquisitive manner, and its effect in convicting and refuting the errors of those with whom he conversed, and who endeavoured, for their own wanton gratification, to imitate him in their intercourse with others. These would take delight in confounding and perplexing others, and exposing and ridiculing their pretensions to wisdom. It is easy to conceive, that the superficial resemblance to the manner of Socrates in these persons, and the vexation produced by it, would excite angry objection against the real method of Socrates.<note anchored="true" n="37" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenophon speaks of persons who were pointedly corrected by Socrates, <hi rend="italic">fsii μ∙i&gt;o&gt; a</hi> ∙xι&lt;fβf xoλα&lt;rr&gt;)j∕ou <hi rend="italic">tnxα rtiι( &lt;ritr aio/iinui</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">tliftaι tξωτω&gt; ηλfγ∙χt&gt;.</hi> Mem. i. 4.

These would be referred to as instances of the evil tendency of the teaching of the philosopher himself ; the discredit of the spurious disciples being reflected on the master, to whom it belonged not in any degree.</p><p>It appears, further, as might have been expected, that</p><p>the doctrines of Socrates were studiously misrepresented at the time. Allusions or illustrations employed by him in his reasonings were construed into positive opinions on the subjects to which he thus referred. For example, when, inculcating honest industry, he quoted Hesiod,<note anchored="true" n="38" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>» Op. 311. <hi rend="italic">0fpyfiη</hi> dt τ* ov&lt;tδor.</p></note> <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> saying. “Work there is none that is a scandal, inaction is the scandal,” the captious absurdly but maliciously interpreted him, as applying the words of the poet to sanction the doing every thing, whether right or wrong, for the sake of gain.

As in the polemics of later days, so in the controversy between Socrates and his assailants, the obloquy of general hackneyed terms of reproach was resorted to as the substitute for definite grounds of imputation. Thus were the off-hand allegations against all philosophers,—“ that they searched into the things in the air and the things under the earth, and rejected all belief in the gods, and made the worse appear the better reason,”<note anchored="true" n="41" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• Plat.

The second of these charges requires to be more particularly noticed, because it has reference to a peculiarity in the conduct of Socrates which gave it a colour of truth.</p><p>The mind of Socrates appears to have been deeply imbued with religious feeling. The observation of final causes particularly excited his interest ; so much so, as to lead him to think that no other account should be attempted to be given of the phenomena of the world, but as they are the results of a wise and benevolent design. He delighted thus in contemplating every thing in a moral and religious point of view. He thought that the introduction of physical and mechanical causes into the study of nature, only perplexed and misled the mind. He had at first been greatly attracted by the speculations of Anaxagoras. What won his attention in the system of this philosopher, was its distinguished merit beyond all previous systems, in assigning mind as the master principle of the universe. But when he came to study the writings of Anaxagoras more closely, he was grievously disappointed, and threw up the system in disgust. For he found that it lost sight of the grand and true principle with which it set out, and, after all, constructed the universe out of mere material and mechanical elements.<note anchored="true" n="43" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Plato, Phædo.—Apolog.</p></note><pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0523.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0456"/>
He saw, indced, how futile, as to any real knowledge of the universe, had been the inquiries of the early philosophers. As an Athenian, he participated in that general prejudice against physical science, which Athenians had ignorantly imbibed against all philosophy, when they characterized it as idle talk and drivelling dotage. But as a genuine philosopher, in spite of his Athenian prejudices, he saw and felt that there was a real moral agency pervading the world ; and he judged that, by observation of this, principles of real use for the right direction of human life might be discovered. Tinctured too, as an Athenian, with the superstition of his countrymen, and at the same time correcting it by his superior judgment and feeling, he was disposed to draw every phenomenon into his moral and religious theory of the universe. To stop to inquire into any thing whether it might be explained on simple natural causes, or to doubt its moral design, would appear to his mind as sceptical and profane. Hence, we see at once displayed in him the common character of the Athenian, in his dislike of physical science, and his susceptibility of superstitious influences from the most trivial things; and, on the other hand, the wisdom and religiousness of the true philosopher, in his constant devout disposition to refer all things to a providential design and moral agency.</p><p>It is well known how anxiously the heathens watched the most minute circumstances, not only in their religious rites, but in the actions of daily life, as intimations of the will of the gods. Not only dreams and visions, but flights of birds, the meeting any particular object, sneezing, a voice, or any sound, and the like trivial things, were regarded with seriousness and awe. Socrates felt the mystic influence of such incidents; only he thought more deeply on them than the generality, and that,—not with the vulgar emotions of fear or of hope, according as the omen might be interpreted,—but with calm and pious reference to the benevolent design which he attributed to them as divine intimations. Further, not only did he apply this sentiment to the outward circumstances of daily life ; but he also took into his view the state of his own mind. He conceived that he received at times mysterious signs distinctly perceptible to himself, not indeed of any positive good to be expected from a particular course of conduct, but of precaution,—warnings against evil concerning others as well as himself. These presages he interpreted,—or others perhaps, taking his account of his impressions in too literal a manner, have so represented it,—as a voice addressed to him on each occasion. Instances too, are alleged in which this divine voice was the means of saving him and those who obeyed its direction, from danger. In the retreat of the Athenians after the unfortunate battle at Delium, it is said to have prevented his taking a particular road, and thus saved him, together with Alcibiades and Laches, from being pursued and overtaken by the enemy ; whilst others taking another way were overtaken and slain.<note anchored="true" n="44" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plutarch, de Socr Gen. 298. Cicer∙ de Divin, i. 54.</p></note> This circumstance, according to Plutarch, was a great occasion of the fame at Athens of the “ demonion,”—or “ genius,” as it was called by Latin writers,—of Socrates.<note anchored="true" n="45" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. p. 299.</p></note> ’ To this voice is attributed his active devotion of his life to the moral reform of his countrymen by private and personal addresses to them, and his refraining at the same time from all political exertion.</p><p>The name of a particular dæmonion, or genius, was evidently not assigned by Socrates himself to these extraordinary presages, while he confidently declared their reality. It was rather the misconstruction of the vulgar, and of his</p><p>assailants, interpreting what he affirmed generally of divine intimations, as assertions of the presence of some particular divinity ascertained by his own convictions, and distinct from the gods worshipped at Athens. Heathens were incapable of forming a notion of the Deity, but as a local and tutelary god. They could not rise to the sublime conception of the one universal Being, <hi rend="italic">το δαιμόνιον,</hi> the God in all the world, than whom there is none else. In the view of Socrates, this belief in a presaging voice addressed to his private ear, was nothing more than an extension of the prophetic science, or divination of the heathen world, to practical purposes, and to the cultivation of religious feelings.</p><p>It must be remembered, that the Athenians had their augurs or prophets among the regular officers of the republic, without whose presence no matter of public counsel or of war was ever transacted. These were the recognized interpreters of the divine will. But Socrates claimed a special authority for the presages with which he was peculiarly favoured, and thus seemed to innovate on the science, and encroach on the established forms, of divination. He enjoined, indeed, a devout reference to the Delphic oracle, in all questions of hazardous conduct, teaching that, whilst human reason was the guide in all matters of human power, in those, on the contrary, which were out of human power, as the future event of actions, resort should be had to every means offered for exploring the will of the gods. He professed to have adopted his own course of life on the evidence of such communications. He advised Xenophon to consult the Delphic oracle, as to whether he should do well in accepting the invitation of Proxenus to join the expedition of Cyrus.<note anchored="true" n="46" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• Xenoph. Anab. iii. 1, 4.</p></note> But with this reverence for the recognized sources of divine information, he combined a suspicion of the pretenders to prophecy, who were countenanced by the popular superstition,—the fcoμdrτ&lt;ιr and <hi rend="italic">χpησ∙</hi> μuδβt,—who abounded at Athens.<note anchored="true" n="47" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>« Plato, Apol. 22. c. p. 51.</p></note> He relied rather on the sagacious auguries of his own mind, drawn from observation of some passing incident, or some rapid conclusion respecting the consequences of actions—a kind of intuitive judgment and forecaste, mingling and confounding itself with his religious impressions,—a second hearing, as it were,—a perception of a voice unperceived by the common ear, mysteriously telling of danger to come from some particular course of conduct. Thus was a pretext given to his enemies to say, that he introduced “ new divinities ;” whilst public opinion tolerated the grossest pretensions to divine revelations, and a system of mercenary imposture founded on them. Public opinion upheld the system of divination as it existed, with its external array of augurs, and prophets, and ceremonial. Socrates, on the contrary, led every man to consult the will of the Deity, not without devout preparation in the inward recesses of his own mind, nor without reference to his own obedience and moral improvement.<note anchored="true" n="48" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• Plato, Alcib. ii. 150, p. 99.

This made him construe many things into divine intimations, which were frivolous and irrelevant.

For these do not conceive, that the birds, and the persons that meet them, know what is expedient to those who divine by them, but that the gods, by means of them, signify this. And so he held.</p><p>But the generality say, that they are dissuaded and persuaded by the birds, and the objects that meet them ; whereas Socrates spoke of it as he thought.

Apol. 13, ryω δr τούτο <hi rend="italic">δαιμόνιον κd∖ω.</hi></p></note></p><p>But how great was the change from the practical devotion of the mind here taught by Socrates, from that popularly entertained at Athens! The history of divination, as it was regarded, not at Athens only, but throughout Greece, is but a picture of the invidiousness and malignity of the human heart transformed into attributes of the Divine Being. Let us only hear Solon, as he is described by Herodotus, speaking of the Deity as a principle of envy and turbulence, and as guided by no fixed course in the disposition of human affairs ; and we may judge what a task he had enterprized, who entered into conflict with this inward and subtile idolatry of human passions, established by the heathen system of divination. It was indeed teaching divinities new to Athenian ears, when Socrates inculcated an inward reformation of the character of those who would look for the favour of the gods, or expect a special interposition and direction from the benevolent principle which guided the course of the moral world.</p><p>Whereas, too, the popular divination was employed on the most trivial occasions, and made the substitute for the proper exertion of men’s faculties on matters cognizable by them, Socrates differed from this prevalent notion of the subject. He contended, that, where the line of conduct was plain, men should use the best of their judgment in acting,—that they should use their experience and reason in learning what the gods had given them to learn by such means, and only have resort to consultation of the Divine will by the extraordinary means of divination, where the results of conduct were uncertain. Thus might he be construed as dissuading men from the use of divination, when he only dissuaded from an improper use of it, and exhorted to a rational activity.</p><p>We may see from the story of Aristodicus of Cyme, how the practice existed among the Greeks, of endeavouring to obtain from the oracles sanctions even to iniquities and impieties. Aristodicus consults the oracle whether he may surrender an unhappy fugitive ; and the oracle permits him, dexterously reproving, by the very permission, the attempt to cast the burthen of personal responsibility on the oracle itself, and to cover an immoral act with the veil of religious duty.<note anchored="true" n="52" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Herodotus, Clio. c. 158, 159. The same is illustrated in the story of Glaucus in Erato, c. 86. The oracles were consulted, also, on</p><p>frivolous matters, such as the petty thefts of Λmasis. Euterpe, c. 174.</p></note> Divination, in fact, was indolently resorted to in the heathen world, to relieve the mind of the labour and anxiety of thought, and the searchings of conscience. And Socrates addressed himself to the correction of this practice, by recommending, as we have seen, exertion of the judgment, and the acquisition of information on all matters within the sphere of human reason. He would thus provoke the hostility of many a professed diviner, who made a trade of his art, and would find individuals of this class ready to join in the outcry raised against him, of innovation on the popular theology.</p><p>The jealousy of the sophists in particular, the very class with whom the accusation of Melitus identified him, would also swell the popular envy against him on this head. For the sophists, among their pretensions, claimed to be regarded as endued with a predictive sagacity, so as to be expert practical guides respecting the future.<note anchored="true" n="53" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Isocr. c. Soph. 2, 4, wept <hi rend="italic">τi&gt;v μίλλόντωι» μiv r!δlvaι πρoσπoισvμlvovc∙</hi></p></note> Socrates would offend them in this point in two ways,—both as directing persons to have recourse to their own judgment, and the regular means of information on all ordinary questions to which human reason was competent ; and as teaching a reference to a secret divine intimation on all other matters beyond the compass of man’s understanding. For in both respects would the sophists find their course interfered with. The use of men’s own judgment, or the appeal to the signs of the Divine will, would equally lessen the value for those counsels which they pretended to impart.</p><p>What added still further to this invidious feeling was, that the reputation of Socrates now eclipsed theirs throughout Greece. And Socrates appears himself confidently to have appealed to this public estimation of his character against the partial censures of his countrymen at the time of his trial. He vindicated his assertion of divine intimations specially granted to him, by referring to the oracle of Delphi as having honoured him with its distinct approbation. Chærephon, in the devoutness of his admiration of his master, had, on some occasion, consulted the oracle respecting him, and obtained an answer that Socrates was the wisest of men. The authenticity of the anecdote has been questioned. But the introduction of it in the two “Apologies,”<note anchored="true" n="54" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• Xenoph. Apol. p. 249. Plato, Apol. p. 48.</p></note> may be taken as a voucher of its substantial truth. It at any rate shews the favourable opinion which had been conceived of him out of Athens itself; that, as Lycurgus had been complimented by the verdict of an oracle, so the same tribute of public applause might, with equal probability, be assigned to Socrates.</p><p>According to Laertius, the sentence of condemnation was carried by a majority consisting of 281 votes. The number was little more than sufficient to decide the question on that side ; for it only exceeded the number of votes of acquittal by three. “ Had but three votes only fallen differently,” says Socrates himself, in the “ Apology” of Plato, <hi rend="italic">“</hi> I should have been acquitted.” Nor, indeed, would Melitus alone, without the aid of Anytus and Lycon, (he is made there confidently to declare) have obtained even a fifth part of the votes to save him the penalty of a thousand drachmas, affixed by the law to an unsustained prosecution. But when the penalty of death was further put to the vote, and he was found unwilling to propose the substitution of any other penalty, such as a fine or exile, but evinced his indignant contempt of their unjust sentence, by asking rather, in his ironical way, instead of even a slight punishment, the highest honour of the state, that of a public maintenance in the Prytaneum, the multitude of the jurors was so exasperated by the unbending spirit thus displayed, that eighty additional votes were given on the hostile side, determining the sentence of death. So evidently was the whole case ruled by passion and the arts of demagogues exciting the people to treat it as a slight on their majesty, rather than as a cause in a court of justice. Otherwise it could not have happened, that when the previous question of guilt had been carried with nearly an equal number of dissentients, the severest penalty should have obtained such an accession of voices in its favour.</p><p>We have already remarked the little solicitude shewn by<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0525.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0458"/>
Socrates in regard to his defence from the accusation. As he strongly disapproved the affected artificial rhetoric of his times, and the practice of appealing to the passions against the judgment of the hearer, so neither would he study beforehand what he should say on the occasion of his trial. Twice had he essayed (he observes to Hermogenes) to consider what he should say in his defence, and as often had he been prevented by those secret divine intimations to which he habitually referred his conduct.<note anchored="true" n="55" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Xenopb.

The celebrated orator Lysias composed an oration for this purpose. On reading it, he expressed his admiration of it, hut declined it as unsuitable to him. When Lysias wondered that he could admire it, and yet say it was unsuitable, he observed, in his usual manner of illustration, by an apposite case; “ Would not also fine coats and shoes be unsuitable to me?” Plato, however, it is said, could not be restrained from appearing in his behalf, and made an effort to address the court. But the uproar was so great, that on his uttering the words, “ ascend the bema,” he was met with the cry, “ descend,” and forced to abandon the attempt.<note anchored="true" n="56" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Diog.

The Athenian juryman expected that the defendant should come before him in the character of a suppliant, and entreat his clemency rather than claim his justice. He was to be assailed with prayers and tears, no less than with arguments addressed to his understanding. But Socrates would not condescend to these methods of persuasion. He would not produce his wife and children in the court, to excite compassion, or bring forward his connexions and friends to intercede in his behalf He felt it unbecoming in him at his age, and with his reputation as a philosopher, to supplicate for his life.

There were in his manner, even at that solemn crisis, touches of the same ironical humour, the same half-earnest, half-playful strokes of argumentative attack, which had given so much interest and point to his daily familiar conversations ; and when the trial was over, he evinced no further emotion than the indignation of a sincere and honest man. at the malicious and mischievous arts by which the result had been accomplished. He was sustained by the consciousness that no crime had been proved against him; whilst his assailants must feel the reproaches of conscience for the real im</p><p>piety and iniquity of which they had been guilty; some for having instigated others to bear false witness against him ; some for having themselves borne this false witness. The disgrace of the condemnation fell not on him, he asserted, but on those who had passed such a sentence. He consoled himself with the thought, that it was the will of the Deity, and it was best for him now to die ; that, though condemned by his present judges, like another Palamedes, he should receive from posterity that verdict of approbation which was withheld from Ulysses, to whose successful plot the life of that chief was sacrificed.<note anchored="true" n="61" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Xenoph.

As for my sons, when they shall have grown up, punish them, I pray you, by troubling them in the same manner in which I have been in the habit of troubling you, if they appear to you to concern themselves either with money or any thing else in preference to virtue. And if they would seem to be something when they are nothing, reproach them as I do you, that they take no concern about what they ought, and think themselves to be something when they are nothing. And if you do this, I shall have suffered justice at your hands, both myself and my sons. But it is now time to depart ; for me to die, for you to live ; but which of us is going to a better thing is uncertain to every one except only the Deity.”<note anchored="true" n="63" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Plato Apol. ad fin.</p></note></p><p>In his way from the court to the prison to which he was now consigned, he was observed with eye and mien and step composed, in perfect unison with his previous address. On perceiving some of those who accompanied him, weeping, " Why is this,” he said; “ is it now that you weep ? did you not long ago know, that, from the moment of my birth, the sentence of death had been decreed against me by nature? If, indeed, I were perishing beforehand in the midst of blessings flowing in upon me, it would be plain that I and my kind friends would have to grieve; but if I terminate my life at a time when troubles are expected, for my part I think you ought all to be in good heart, as feeling that I am happy.”<note anchored="true" n="64" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenoph.

Acknowledging the affectionate feeling thus shewn to him in a familiar manner, by passing his hand over the head of his attached disciple, he, at the same time, gently reproved him, saying, “ Would you then, my dear Apollodorus, rather see roe dying justly than unjustly?” and smiled at the question. On seeing Anytus pass by, he could not forbear, it is said, the expression of a strong censure on the conduct of that individual towards his own son. He foretold, what the unhappy result proved too true, that the heart of Anytus would one day he embittered by the evil fruits of that low and unworthy education to which, with mercenary views, he had subjected his son, a young man with whom the philosopher had formerly conversed, and who had seemed destined for better things.</p><p>The execution of Socrates, by the poisoned cup, would have followed immediately on his condemnation, but for the peculiar circumstances under which the trial had taken place. It was after the commencement of the Delian festival; an annual commemoration, of the safe return of Theseus and his devoted companions to Athens, from the fatal labyrinth of Crete, and the acquittal thenceforth of the<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0526.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0459"/>
bloody tribute exacted by Minos, by the mission of a vessel to Delos with sacrifices to Apollo, and other religious rites. When the priest of Apollo had once crowned the stern of the sacred vessel with the festive garland, it was not lawful to pollute the city by a public execution, until the solemn pomp should have been performed, and the vessel had returned. This ceremony had been performed only the day before the trial of Socrates. Thus he obtained the respite of thirty days between his trial and execution.</p><p>These were days of high interest and importance not only to his sorrowing friends, but to the cause of that admirable practical philosophy which all his previous life had inculcated. During this time he employed himself in literary exercises which he had never practised before. He composed a poem in honour of the god Apollo, whose festival was then in course of celebration. And feeling <hi rend="italic">a</hi> religious scruple as to whether by the general pursuit of philosophy, he had fully complied with the suggestions of dreams repeatedly urging him, as he said, to “ cultivate music,” he new applied himself to the fulfilment of this supposed charge, by turning the fables of Æsop into verse.<note anchored="true" n="65" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Plato, Phædo. p. 60 d. <hi rend="italic">et sqq.</hi></p></note> But these were only pastimes illustrative of the serenity of his mind. Now, too, in his prison, with the chains on his body, and the near prospect of a violent death, he could discourse with an unanswerable cogency and eloquence of argument, of the vanity of human things, and the real happiness of man, as consisting in the cultivation of the spiritual and immortal principles of his nature. He had professed his whole life to be a meditation or discipline of death. He now had the opportunity.—which, as a philosopher, (could the voice of natural instinct have been silenced,) he would most have desired,— of realizing, by his own example, that death to which his thoughts and pursuits had been studiously directed. Unlike his successors in the schools of the Stoics, he did not advocate a doctrine of suicide, however he depreciated the importance of human life. With that good sense which restrained his religion and his philosophy from running into fanaticism, he held it to be impious in any one to release himself, by his own hand, from that post of duty in which the Deity had placed him.<note anchored="true" n="66" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Plato, Phædo, p. 61, c. <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> 0v <hi rend="italic">μiv ισa&gt;s βuiσeraι άντόν. oiι yap φaσl θ(μerov hvai.</hi></p></note> Though, however, he had not courted death, or rashly placed himself in the way of it, he felt that, in the circumstances in which he was now placed, he was called to go through this last act of his philosophic profession. He seems, indeed, to have rejoiced in the opportunity thus afforded him of summing up his philosophy in one great principle, from which every observation and argument, in the course of previous teaching, had been drawn, by demonstrating, so far as reason could avail to demonstrate the fact, the absolute and eternal existence of the great principles of moral truth. The occasion was one which the genius of Plato would not fail to seize as most felicitous for the development of its own enthusiastic and transcendental view of the philosophy of Socrates. Plato, accordingly, has, in that most exquisite of his Dialogues, the Phædo, invited us to the couch of Socrates, on the last sad morning of his imprisonment, to listen to the philosopher, with the chill of death almost upon him, discoursing on the immortality of the soul. The affectionate and eloquent disciple doubtless shed natural tears over his dying master. But he</p><p>wished also to elevate his own philosophy to the dignity of being the dying confession of the great sage of Athens. And he wished, further, that his own philosophy should speak, as it were, the funeral oration over him to whom it was indebted for its earliest inspirations, and pour its own libation on his tomb. Thus he has especially elaborated the last scene of his master’s life, and made us contemplate with the deepest interest the death of Socrates, not only as an act</p><p>of heroic self-devotion and patient martyrdom to the truth, taught by the great sage himself, but as a splendid episode in the dramatic development of his own philosophy.</p><p>During his imprisonment, Socrates was not denied the solace of receiving his friends, and conversing with them day after day. Early each morning might be seen a company of devoted friends, whom nothing could separate from him, assembled at the hall of justice, where the trial had taken place, and which was close to the prison, watching for the jailor to open the gate and admit them. Being admitted, they would commonly remain with him in the prison until evening, engaged in earnest and instructive conversation. His wife and children, too, appear to have been constantly with him.<note anchored="true" n="67" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>&gt; Plato, Phædo. p. 60 a. Op. i. p. 135.</p></note> He was importuned by these affectionate followers to suffer them to effect his escape. Crito earnestly entreated him to be allowed to execute a plan which he had concerted for rescuing him. Simmias, the Theban, also brought a sum of money with him to Athens for that purpose. Cebes and others were equally ready with their resources. They argued, that, so far from being at a loss what to do with himself out of Athens, as he had said on his trial, they could ensure him friends in Thessaly, and many other places, who would most gladly welcome him, and protect him. But to none of these importunities would he yield. He answered, that, while he highly estimated their kindness, he was pledged to obey reason only, and that he saw no ground in his present circumstances for taking a different view of his case. As for the duty of providing for his children, by preserving his own life,—a consideration which Crito appears to have strongly pressed on him,—this was not now a matter for him to consider ;—it was for those to consider, who, as his Athenian judges, treated life and death as such light concerns ; for his part, he must look simply to what was right or wrong to be done.<note anchored="true" n="68" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Plato Crito, p. 48, c. Op. i. p. 111.</p></note> Thus steadily and calmly did he persevere in his resolution of awaiting the utmost extremity.</p><p>At length it was announced that the Theoric galley had been seen off Sunium, and might very shortly be expected to arrive at Athens. Crito proceeded in anxious haste to the prison, and being well-known to the jailor from his frequent visits there, obtained admission at a very early hour. He found Socrates asleep, and sat by him in silence, wondering to see him sleep so soundly in so much trouble, until he at length awoke to receive the fatal intelligence. This he received with the same composure as if it had been some ordinary communication. His only answer to Crito was, that he was quite resigned to the will of the gods, if it were so, but that he was persuaded by a dream, from which he had just waked, that the vessel would not come that day, but the following one. His reliance on dreams as divine intimations, has been already mentioned. He told Crito, accordingly, of his having dreamed that a woman of noble form, clothed in white, came to him and called him, and said to him in the words of Homer,<note anchored="true" n="69" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">* 'Hμaτi κtv τριτάτια φι)iηv ipιβωλθf</hi> tκoιo.</p></note> “ On the third day to deep-soiled Pthia thou shaft come.” The event, at any rate, accorded with his expectation from the dream. On the morrow the vessel reached the harbour of Piraeus ; and the following day was appointed for the execution.</p><p>By the dawn of that day, the sorrowing party again met at the accustomed place, and wore informed by the jailor, that the Eleven,—the officere who superintended the public executions,—had given orders that the chains should be taken off, and that Socrates should die on that day. After being kept waiting some time, they went in and found the philosopher already loosed from his chains, and sitting on the couch, with Xanthippe and his youngest child in her arms, by his side. By his desire they conduct her home, the kind Crito<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0527.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0460"/>
entrusting her to the care of his attendants, amidst cries of passionate grief, which had broken forth from her afresh at the sight of them now come to bid their last farewell. The occasion naturally leads to the conversation which follows a discussion, according to Plato, on the immortality of the soul,—Socrates interrogating and arguing with all his wonted vivacity ; whilst the party around him answer and listen with eager interest, and, as may naturally be conceived, with undescribable sensations of mingled delight and pain. Crito would have dissuaded him from this exertion, for he feared, from what he had been told by the executioner, that the heat of the body thus produced, would add to his discomfort in his last moments, by rendering the effects of the poison more lingering. He only observed, that “ it mattered not ; the executioner should only be ready to do his duty, and mix the draught twice, or even thrice over, if it should be found necessary.”<note anchored="true" n="70" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Plato, Phædo, p. 63, d. <hi rend="italic">et sqq.</hi></p></note></p><p>The discourse being brought to a close, he rose to proceed to the bath, as an immediate preparation for his death; when Crito detained him for a while, to ask his last commands about his children, or any other matter in which their services might gratify him. He replied, “ that he had nothing new to say beyond what he had ever been saying,— that by attending to themselves, they would most gratify him and his, as well as themselves, in all they might do, though they might even make no promise now ; but that if they neglected themselves, and were unwilling to follow in the track pointed out in all that he had said to them up to this last occasion, all that they could do would be of no avail, however much, and however earnestly, they might promise at the present moment.”<note anchored="true" n="71" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Ibid. p. 115, a. <hi rend="italic">et sqq.</hi></p></note> Crito assented to this advice, but in his eagerness still to do some act of kindness to his revered friend, subjoined, “ But in what way are we to bury you?” This mode of speaking of his burial, gives occasion to a very characteristic reproof from him, of this solicitude on the part of Crito. “ As you please,” was his answer, “ if at least you can take me, and I do not escape from you.” Then gently smiling, and looking off to the surrounding company, he added, “ I cannot, my friends, persuade Crito, that I am the Socrates that is now conversing, and ordering every thing that has been said ; but he thinks that I am that man whom he will shortly see a corpse, and asks how you should bury me. But what I have all along been talking so much about,—that when I shall have drunk the poison, I shall no longer stay with you, but shall, forsooth, go away to certain felicities of the blest,—this I seem to myself to have been saying in vain, whilst comforting at the same time you and myself. Bail me therefore, to Crito the opposite bail to that which he bailed me to the judges; for he was bail for my staying; but do you be bail for my <hi rend="italic">not</hi> staying when dead, but going away ; that Crito may bear it more easily, and may not feel aggrieved for me, as if I were suffering something dreadful, when he sees my body either burning, or being interred ; nor may say at the burial, that he lays out, or carries out, or inters <hi rend="italic">Socrates.</hi> For,” he continued, turning himself again to Crito, “ be assured, excellent Crito, that the speaking improperly is not only wrong in itself, but also produces some evil in the soul. However, take courage, and say that you are burying <hi rend="italic">mg body;</hi> and bury it as may be agreeable to you, and in the manner you may hold most lawful.”<note anchored="true" n="72" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Ibid.</p></note></p><p>He then went into another apartment to bathe, Crito following him, whilst the rest of the party awaited his return. After bathing, he received his children,—two of whom were yet little ones, the third a youth,—and the females of his family. Having conversed some time with these in the presence of Crito, and given them his final commands, he dismissed them, and came out again to the assembled friends. This affecting interview had occupied a</p><p>considerable time, and when he returned, it was near sunset. He had not long sat down, when the officer of the Eleven presented himself, and respectfully intimated to him that the fatal moment was at hand. The noble and gentle demeanour of the philosopher during his imprisonment had won upon this man ; and used as he had been to the scenes of execration and horror within those w alls, he was struck by the contrast in the case of Socrates, and bursting into tears as he gave his message, turned himself away, and retired. Socrates himself was touched by this demonstration of considerate feeling. He cordially returned the salutation, promising <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ready compliance with the order. Then addressing the company, he observed, “ How courteous the man is! through all the time he would come to me, and would converse with me sometimes, and was the best of men ; and now how generously does he weep for me!” He then called for the poisoned cup. Crito's affection would still have delayed it, for he urged that the sun was not yet gone down, and that others on the like occasions had not used such despatch, but had supped and drunk beforehand as they pleased. Socrates answered that this might be reasonable for others; for him it was reasonable not to do so; and persisted in requiring the cup to be brought. The process of bruising the hemlock took some time ; but at length the man who was to administer the poison came with it now ready for the draught. He calmly inquired what he was to do ; and, being told that he was only to walk about after drinking it, until he found a heaviness in the legs, and then to lie down, he took the cup into his hand without the slightest change of colour or of countenance. But before he put it to his lips, partly, it seems, from religious feeling, and partly in humour, he further asked whether he might make a libation to any one from the cup. Nor did even his usual quaint manner of putting a question, which he knew would somewhat surprise the hearer, forsake him on this occasion ; for he looked at the man, at the same time, with that peculiar glance usual to him, which his contemporaries jocosely designated by a word denoting its resemblance to the manner in which the bull glares around him with the head downward. Learning that the whole draught was not more than sufficient for the fatal purpose, he said, “ At any rate one may, and ought to pray to the gods, that the migration hence to those regions may be prosperous; which indeed I do pray, and so may it be!” With these words, he drank off the poison with the most perfect composure and readiness.</p><p>At the sight of this, the bystanders could no longer command their emotions. Their tears flowed profusely. Some rose up from their seats,—Crito set the example,— and covered their faces, to give vent to their sorrow. Apollodorus sobbed aloud. He gently expostulated with them for this outbreak of grief, saying, “ What are you doing, my friends, so strangely ? I indeed sent away the women not least on this account, that they might not offend in such a way ; for I have heard that one ought to die amidst auspicious sounds : I pray you, therefore, be tranquil, and bear up.” This rebuke had the effect of repressing their tears. The heaviness which he had been led to expect from the working of the poison now began to come on, and he left off walking, and reclined, with his face upward, and covered over. The torpor gradually spread towards the upper regions of the body,—the lower parts becoming, one after the other, congealed, and insensible,—until it reached the heart. In this interval, he uncovered himself, and said, “ Crito, we owe a cock to Esculapius ; pay it, I pray you, and neglect it not ;” intimating probably that now all the diseases of life were healed, and that he was restored to real and pure existence by the death of the body. These were his last words. Crito asked whether he had any thing more to say, but received no answer. There w as no further indication of life,<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0528.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0461"/>
but a motion of the body. The executioner uncovered him, and they observed his eyes fixed ; upon which Crito, faithful in the last respectful attentions to his beloved friend, the now departed philosopher, closed the mouth and the eyes.</p><p>Thus died Socrates, when he had now completed his seventieth year, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> 400, or 399, in the full vigour of a healthy old age ; happy in his own estimation, and in that of his admiring disciples, in having terminated his life in so glorious a manner, with unimpaired faculties of mind and body, and after a defence sustained with so much truth, and justice, and fortitude.<note anchored="true" n="73" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> Xenoph.

The chief of these appear to have fled to Megara, where they could reckon on finding a refuge from Athenian hostility, and a home with their fellow-disciple, the friendly Euclid. It is remarkable, however, that Isocrates, timid as he was by nature, should not have scrupled to remain at Athens, and to testify his affectionate regret for his master, by appearing the next day in public, clothed in mourning.<note anchored="true" n="74" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Pseudo-Plutarch. X Orat. Vit. Plutarch. Op. ix. p. 336.</p></note> But with the fall of its great victim, the spirit of persecution was sated for a time. An act had been perpetrated, to which the eyes of all Greece would be intently turned ; and the greatness of the sacrifice seems at the moment to have absorbed the attention of its agents and instruments, in the contemplation of it and its possible effects. If we may believe the representation of subsequent writers, shame and repentance soon followed the cruel act ; and those who were most ostensibly involved in its guilt, were either banished or sentenced to death, or laid violent hands on themselves. Of the banishment of Anytus, and the death of Melitus, we are told by Laertius, that Antisthenes was the immediate cause. In what way he was instrumental to the death of Melitus, is not stated. But with regard to Anytus, Antisthenes is said to have occasioned his banishment, apparently without the intention of doing so, by a stroke of practical humour. For meeting with some young men from Pontus, inquiring for Socrates, whose fame had induced them to visit Athens, he conducted them to Anytus, who, as he observed to them, was “ wiser than Socrates upon which, the indignation of the bystanders was excited, and they drove Anytus forth from the city.<note anchored="true" n="75" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Diog.

The ascendancy of another political faction, (and Athens was ever fluctuating between contending parties), would be quite sufficient to account for their overthrow and desperation. On the other hand, the testimony of Plutarch is explicit to the point, though he mentions no individuals by name, that the sycophants who had assailed Socrates became the objects of popular hatred to such a degree, that none would associate with them in any way, not even to return them an answer when addressed by them, and that at last they hanged themselves, being no longer able to endure the public execration.<note anchored="true" n="77" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plutarch, de Invid. et Od.

It oppressed, indeed, the individual, but it gave the seal of martyrdom to the cause in which he had been engaged. It produced a temporary intimidation, under which men would hear less of the name and teaching of Socrates openly avowed, but throughout which the admiration and love of the heroic philosopher would be cherished in secret, and his doctrine would be fostered in the shade, to appear in the sunshine of a future day. If the Athenians had desired to plant the root of philosophy in their city, they could not more effectually have done so, than by their violence against Socrates. Such, in fact, was the result. Philosophy henceforth obtained an Athenian naturalization and name ; and the schools of Athens may date their period of nearly a thousand years from this memorable act, which, in its intent and spirit, fiercely but blindly endeavoured to extinguish there the very profession of philosophy.<note anchored="true" n="78" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> The schools of Athens were closed in the reign of Justinian, A. C. 529.</p></note></p><p>The cause, however, in which Socrates had been engaged, was too true, for any opposition to it, though conducted with the greatest prudence, to have been long successful. It had also already advanced too far, and interested too many persons in the maintenance of it, to be put down by a sudden blow. The burning of a book, or a formal condemnation of the opinions of a writer, are but futile means, as experience shews, of suppressing obnoxious doctrines. How much less could opposition avail, where, as in the case of Socrates, the offending doctrines had been scattered over, not the pages of a book, but the strenuous exertions of a long life,—already engraved in characters which no obliterating hand could reach, and doubtless so worked into many a mind, as not to be distinguishable from its own proper convictions,—doctrines too, so confirmed by the noble example of their teacher, in carrying them out to their full consequences by his death ? For the death of Socrates, it should be observed, was not simply a test of his sincerity in his teaching. It was this, and still more. It was the ultimate and decisive opposition to those false principles, against which every action and discourse of his life had been directed. He had been all along exposing the presumptuousness and vanity of the principles on which men ordinarily judged and acted. He was now further to shew, that this opposition on his part was not to be daunted by those principles, when set in formidable array against his own life ; and that, professing a low estimate of the present life, he would not disown or shrink from that profession at the moment of greatest trial.</p><p>If we inquire, accordingly, what was the substance of the positive teaching of Socrates, we must address ourselves to the contemplation of his active life, and his resigned patient death. He had no design of establishing philosophy as a literary pursuit or intellectual pastime ; though he probably foresaw, that that taste for inquiry into truth which he was ever awakening, must soon lead to the formation of <hi rend="italic">a</hi> philosophical literature at Athens. He already witnessed, indeed, the commencement of such a literature, the result of this excitement, if it be true that he had read the Lysis of Plato, and observed respecting it, “ How much the young man makes me say that I never said !”<note anchored="true" n="79" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> Diog.

at once as well-informed persons and teachers of others, with crude and superficial notions and principles.</p><p>If we look, then, to the course of his practical teaching, —to the general tenor of his conversations and actions, and the example throughout of his life and death,—we shall find that his whole labour was directed to the establishment of true moral and religious principles, in opposition to the false and mischievous principles which, he observed, were commonly acted upon and avowed in the world. The excellence and supremacy of self-knowledge was what he was ever inculcating; and of self-knowledge, not as a matter of intellectual curiosity, or for its value as a science, but in order to self-government and to happiness. He found that this was the last kind of knowledge which men ever thought of acquiring ; that they had, in fact, no concern about it ; or that if they were reminded of its necessity, they presumed on their possession of it already. His first effort, then, was to open the minds of men to a perception of the value of this knowledge, and of their own need of it. The questions which he would put—the refutations which he addressed to the various propositions or conclusions elicited from others in the course of his conversations—the perplexities to which he would reduce them—and the unsatisfied state in which he would commonly leave them, after exciting their doubts—all had a direct tendency to convince men of the insufficiency of their intellectual acquirements, and of their want of some more adequate and availing information.<note anchored="true" n="80" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Xenopb.

For he was far from an utilitarian, in the modern sense of that term. He did not value particular studies, because they ministered to the necessities or conveniences of human life, or undervalue them because they had no such bearing. But he saw that his clever and ingenious countrymen were studious of intellectual refinement—that they delighted in the specious, and the admirable, and the subtile, more than in the solid and the unostentatious qualifications of the good member of a private family and the useful citizen. He was aware, too, from his own acquaintance with the existing physical philosophy, how imperfect that knowledge was, how entirely hypothetical, and incapable of practical application. We must make allowance, therefore, in estimating his objection to speculative science, for the polemical spirit in which he assailed a branch of knowledge then, at once, so barren, and so encroaching in its claims on public attention. We must regard him as preparing the way for the due cultivation of the other, the higher as well as more important knowledge, that of man’s own nature, then so little thought of, and so neglected. This seems to be invariably his design on every occasion, whatever may be the immediate purport of his discourse.</p><p>When he came to direct the minds of men, once awakened to the importance of moral study, to the subject itself of human nature, he had to encounter on the very threshold the most perverse notions. All their maxims of life were based on the absolute importance of the present life. The body, and its present appetites and desires, were regarded as the whole of man. The tyrant, in the enjoyment of absolute power to gratify every passion without restriction or penalty, was considered as the apt representation of the highest human felicity. All men’s plans of life accordingly were directed to the acquisition of power for themselves. They studied to improve their external circumstances, and not themselves. Then their religion was merely the fear of mysterious powers influencing the prosperous or adverse events of the present world, and which</p><p>were therefore to be conciliated or appeased by offerings and vows. Socrates set himself strenuously to refute these vain presumptions. He argued the folly of supposing, that men really accomplished their own washes in gratifying each prevailing inclination. He showed, that whilst they did what they pleased at the moment, they did not in fact attain that pleasure which they sought; and led them therefore to surmise, that there must be some end of human pursuit beyond the gratification of the passions, and further, some ultimate end to the whole sum of the active energies of the soul, beyond the present life, and distinct from all bodily associations. But he not only suggested such a thought by shewing the reasonings on the opposite view of human life to be inconsequential and absurd ; he further practically refuted the prevailing fallacies on the subject, by his own example on the other side. He proved to the world, by divesting himself of all the worldly accessaries of happiness, and depending exclusively on the internal resources of his mind and character, and by his perpetual cheerfulness under those privations, that happiness did not result from externals, or from the body, but from the internal nature of man, nor from any thing positive and absolute in that nature, so much as from its state of discipline and command over the appetites of the body. Theories of morals were yet to be formed. It remained for Plato to erect the true and sublime standard of human conduct in the perfections of the Divinity, and for Aristotle afterwards to shew the application of the law of habits to the subject. Socrates has the merit of having prepared the way for these developments of the subject, by demonstrating the folly of seeking the ideal of happiness in any enjoyment of the body, or in any thing present.</p><p>So also as to religion, though he could not advance, in his conceptions of the retributive justice of the Divine Being, beyond the circle of darkness which limits the natural observation of man, he proved the absurdity of supposing that mere external punishment was the only suffering undergone for offences committed. Secret faults, as he pointed out, did not escape with impunity. He appealed to the remorses of conscience, to shew how surely, however invisibly, wrong doing was visited with its punishment ; and whilst in his own mind he concluded that there would be a future state, in which each man would receive the merited consequences of his actions, he must also have excited, in the minds of his hearers, a strong though undefined apprehension of a period of general retribution after death in another world. At least they must have seen that it was not so certain, as they may have once supposed, that though a present punishment may have been evaded, punishment would not follow at a future day. In well-disposed minds, there would thus be a foundation laid of a doctrine of the immortality of the soul. Under the teaching of Socrates himself, this truth, perhaps, would scarcely assume the form of a doctrine, so distinctly as it is stated by Plato. It would be simply a practical conviction. And thus Socrates himself probably scarcely propounded it in formal terms, nor without those qualifying doubts which both his memorialists describe him as joining with its enunciation. But Plato, following him, took up the doctrine as a formal truth, and worked it up into a perfect theory, with the formal array of argument and didactic exposition.</p><p>There was nothing, indeed, of system in any part of the teaching of Socrates. In the “Memorabilia” of Xenophon, we have probably a very complete specimen of the substance of what he taught, and, in the desultory manner in which the subjects of the several conversations there given are introduced, of the actual way in which he would throw<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0530.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0463"/>

Mem. iv. 2, 16; ii. 6. 35. Aristot.

Supposing even that those great truths, thus taught, were the broken planks from the wreck of a primitive Faith, floated down on the stream of ages, we must yet believe a providential disposition, in the fact of that ready acceptance which they could obtain with one, brought up, as Socrates was, amidst the grossest corruptions of heathenism. His was an instance, how the unsophisticated heart responds to the notices of divine truth, when once they are duly presented to it ; and how, wherever there is a sincere pursuit of right, the moral eye will be enabled to pierce the surrounding gloom, and to discern, for the most part, the true outline and form of right.</p><p>It is observable, however, that, whilst Socrates correctly perceived that the laws of religion and morality possessed a sacred importance, independently of all positive enactments of men, he yet appeals to the laws of the state for the particular rules of religious and moral duty. When instructing Euthydemus on the worship of the gods, he cites the Delphic oracle, which enjoined the law of the state as the rule of acceptable worship.<note anchored="true" n="84" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid. iv. 3, 16. Also, i. 3, 1.</p></note> When asked by the sophist Hippias what is just, he answers, that it is what the laws prescribe. Such reference was perfectly natural in a Greek, accustomed as Greeks were to view every thing in subordination to politics, and to regard the duty of the citizen as paramount to every other duty. This feeling had its influence with Socrates, and induced him to regard the authority of the state as possessing in itself a moral force of obligation. The respect which he throughout shewed to the laws of his own state, was that of one who</p><p>not only obeyed what they commanded, but strictly referenced their authority.<note anchored="true" n="85" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See, in the “Crito " of Plato, a beautiful address, put into the mouth of Socrates, from the personified majesty of the laws.</p></note> We must not, however, suppose, that he thus intended to place positive and moral laws on the same footing. The reference which he gives to the written law of the state, as the directory on questions of religion and morals, is the substitute in his teaching for a systematic development of the moral and religious duties. The law of the state presented, to orte who had no thought of systematizing the subject for himself, the best expression of those great truths which he was drawing forth from the higher source of man’s eternal nature. He is content to point out to his hearers, in a general way, the wisest and readiest collection of rules for those cases which came under the great comprehensive duties of piety and justice. Evidently he is not treating the subject with the exactness of the theorist, in assigning this importance to the law of the state ; but he is enforcing the use of the law of the state as an authoritative practical guide to right conduct. —His internal view of religion, for example, was founded on observation of the signs of benevolent design throughout the material and intellectual world ; and he was thus led to the acknowledgment of a pure Theism. But in his conduct, he knew not how to realize the obligations which the perception of this truth imposed on him. With his reverence, accordingly, for the laws of his country, as well as under the influence of that superstition to which his piety habitually verged, he sought a direction to his religious sentiments from the authority of the state, and thus in practice was a polytheist.—His object was further to prevent men from trusting to the conceits of their own judgment in matters of conduct, and to recommend a proper deference to the wisdom and authority of their ancient laws, then so presumptuously slighted by each vain pretender to superior prudence and political sagacity.</p><p>In assailing, as Socrates did, the follies of his countrymen by the dexterity of an acute reason, he was ever exposing their ignorance. The impression on his own mind appears to have been, that men erred rather from the want of due information respecting their moral condition, than from the perverseness of their will,—from folly, rather than from vice. Himself an accurate observer of human life, and with a disposition to follow the path of duty wherever it might lead him, he had in his own case felt the importance of intellectual cultivation, in order to right conduct. From his own circumstances, accordingly, and a natural predilection for those exercises of the mind which were his habitual pursuit, he overrated this importance ; and, instead of simply regarding the information of the mind as a necessary ingredient in moral improvement, he made it all in all. Thus, according to him; wisdom or philosophy was Virtue, and ignorance and folly, vice. He carried this view of morals so far, as to place the knowledge of duty on a footing with the knowledge Of arts. Nor was he even startled with the paradox, that if such were the case—if the knowledge of right were the whole of morality—there would be less immorality in intentional wrong conduct, than in unintentional done through ignorance.<note anchored="true" n="86" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Xeuoph.

In illis excusatius est, voluntate peccare, quam casu : in hac maxima culpa est, sponte delinquere. Quod dico, tale est.

At in hac arte vivendi, turpior volentium culpa est.” Ep. 95. 8. He seems to have had the argument of Socrates, as given by Xenophon, (Mem. iv. 2, 80. ) in his view. So also Aristotle says: Kol &lt;v <hi rend="italic">μiv τiχvη ό (κών αμαρτάνων alpfτωτtpos∙ πtpi δ( φρόνησιν ijττov, ώστττρ</hi> rat <hi rend="italic">π(pι</hi> rùr <hi rend="italic">ap(T&lt;κ.</hi> Eth.

Thus vice was in no case, in the view of Socrates, an act of the will, but of the mistaken judgment. He did not mean by this to assert, that men did not act wrong wilfully in the particular instances of misconduct, so as not to deserve blame for their misconduct ; but that the seat of vice was in the perverse understanding,—for that the will was invariably towards good. If, accordingly, vice may be regarded as seated in the understanding, and not in the heart, it would follow, that that man is less vicious in <hi rend="italic">principle,</hi> who knows what is right and acts wrong, than one who acts wrong without knowing what is right. The former alternative, however, was impossible, according to his theory. For knowledge, by its intrinsic excellence, must prevail over every other principle. So far was Socrates led by the working of his method, and his observation of the ignorance and folly of men, to overlook facts, at least, as evident on the other side,—the plain instances of men acting wrong in spite of their better knowledge, and of greater blame assigned to wrong thus done in spite of knowledge. His error is further to be traced to a confusion of the ideas of right and happiness, in the term “ good.” That the will is, by the original constitution of man, invariably towards good, if we take good in the sense of real interest or happiness, is quite true ; but it is far from true, if we include the notion of right in that of good. Men, when they take even perverted views of their happiness, may be regarded as unconsciously desiring the real happiness of their nature. The will, therefore, in this sense, may be said to be always towards good. But in the latter sense of the term “good,”—that in which it includes right,—the contrary rather is true. Men see the light, but love darkness rather than light ; and the seat of vice is, accordingly, not in the understanding, but in the heart. But there is this justification of the language of Socrates on moral subjects, that the ignorance which he attacked, was, in truth, a vicious and blameable ignorance. Men did not take pains to inform themselves on moral subjects. They neglected themselves, pursuing and professing every other kind of knowledge but that which was most at hand for their acquisition, and most concerned them. Seeing, then, the moral errors into which men ran from this neglect, Socrates not unreasonably set his mark of reprobation no</p><p>ignorance, as the source of immorality. Immediately, indeed, and ostensibly, he attacked the general ignorance of men, holding out philosophy as the remedy of vice and unhappiness. But the ultimate and real object of his attack all the while was, the immoral disposition, the self-neglect, and the irregular habits of life, from which the incapacity and ignorance of men on moral subjects commonly result. Then, further, it was the ignorance of self, chiefly, that he laboured to remove. He found conceit as to themselves, the prevailing lauft of the men of his age and country. And he hoped, by exposing their ignorance on various subjects, to make them question their presumptions relating to their own nature, and character, and duties. Thus would he, in effect, be correcting moral error,—the folly of men persuading themselves and others that they knew what they had never cared to examine, much less to know.<note anchored="true" n="87" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenophon speaks of the refutatione employed by Socrates, serving as chastisements of presumptuous folly, *0λαp7pι0υ weite. Mem. i.4.I.</p></note> <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi></p><p>As the peculiar aspect under which he presented the subject of morals arose, in a great measure, from his manner of interrogating in conversation, so the general character of his philosophy is to be sought in its intimate connexion with the peculiar method which he pursued. His philosophy, being essentially colloquial, laid down no positive principles in any particular science, or even any general principles for the conduct of the understanding in scientific or</p><p>moral inquiries. But it sought to rouse the understanding to a perception of its condition of weakness, and defects, and ignorance, previous to its interrogation of itself,and its acquisition of knowledge, and its strengthening by exercise and discipline. Like the great reformer of modern science, he found nothing duly ascertained in the field of philosophy ; hypotheses assumed without examination, truth obscured and confounded under the plausible cover of general terms and vague analogies. Yet every one was fully satisfied with the state of knowledge; every one presumed that he was in possession of the truth. So, too, at this period, as at the time when Bacon proposed his new method, there was a dialectical science in use, available only for disputation and victory, and not reaching the truth of things, or imparting any real knowledge. And, in like manner, in the time of Socrates, as in that of Bacon, this imperfect dialectical science was regarded as the key to every kind of knowledge ; and he who could discourse fluently on any given subject, was esteemed the accomplished philosopher. “ Of nothing,” as Bacon himself pointedly observes, “ were men so scrupulous as lest they should seem to doubt on any subject.”<note anchored="true" n="88" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Nov. Org. i. 67.</p></note></p><p>This state of things formed a strong barrier against any attempt to effect a moral reformation. The way to the heart had to be cleared through a mass of outworks thrown out by the intellect. It only remained, then, for him who would be the moral reformer of his countrymen, to work by means of that very dialectical science which opposed its ramparts and its arms to his progress.</p><p>But to have simply used the same method which his contemporaries employed, would have been to revolve in the same perpetual circle. Socrates, indeed, might, by a more skilful use of the same dialectical artifices, have confuted the sophists and others with whom he reasoned. He might have gained the victory in argument, by demonstrating the fallacy of their deductions, or proving the contradictory of their conclusions. But no advance would have been made by such a proceeding towards a detection of the source of the popular errors, the wrong principles themselves, on which men argued and acted. To accomplish this object, then,—to expose the fallacy of wrong principles, —he had to exalt the art of the dialectician to a higher function than that of merely eliciting consequences from given principles.</p><p>This attempt accordingly he made. Without instituting any formal method, or teaching any art of discourse,—without, it seems, having any such design in his thoughts,—he yet so far gave a new direction and impulse to dialectical science, as to render it in some measure at least subservient to the investigation of truth. In his hands, it served, if it did nothing more, to raise <hi rend="italic">doubts</hi> as to the truth of erroneous principles which before had passed without question, and which the very practice of reasoning from them as axioms, had tended to confirm as fixed and indisputable standards of all other truths.</p><p>We must not suppose, that definition and induction were unknown as parts of dialectics before Socrates; or that Socrates was absolutely the first to discover and propound their nature and use. The expressions of Aristotle might suggest this supposition.

He was only an inquirer, himself <hi rend="italic">knowing nothing.</hi> When pressed, as by the sophist Hippias, to give his own account of the particular subject about which he is importunately questioning, he evades the point, and recurs to his established way of proceeding by interrogatories.<note anchored="true" n="92" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenoph.

He cites some instance,—commonly some coarse and very familiar one, from the workshop of the smith or the shoemaker, or from the culinary art, and the like,—as apposite to the point under debate ; and thus brings the principle itself, on which the dispute turns, to the test of actual experience. This was so much his manner, that it was made a standing jest by those against whom he so triumphantly employed it. They complained of his ever repeating the same thing; ever talking of “ carpenters, and smiths, and fullers, and cooks, and such like nonsense.<note anchored="true" n="93" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>∙ Ibid. i. 2, 37.

Here it was the point of an apt illustration that had provoked this sally of resentment from Critias and Charicles, two of the Thirty. It had been reported to them that he had drawn attention to their acts of</p><p>violence, by asking, what would be thought of the herdsman under whose care an herd should be diminished. On this occasion, Charicles, after vainly remonstrating with him against the practice of his daily conversations, shewed the point of the illustration, by bidding him beware lest he also should make the number of the herd still less.<note anchored="true" n="96" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Xenoph. Mem. i. 2. 37.</p></note></p><p>So far, indeed, was Socrates from instituting any method either of argument or of investigation, that the very definitions and instances which he employed were of a popular character, adapted for refutation of error rather than for conviction of the truth,—such as to place difficulties in the way of a dogmatic opponent, rather than didactic illustrations of any particular subject. He was engaged in repelling dogmatism. And nothing is of more avail for this purpose than analogies ; such instances, that is, as test the truth of an assumption in one case, by its application to another of the same kind. Direct instances, shewing experimentally the truth or falsehood of an assumption, may be difficult to be found; and, in their use, they require a particular acquaintance with the subject itself, in order that their application may be seen. For example, if it were desired to expose a false theory of government, some fact of history must be adduced, and its bearing on the theory in question must be distinctly pointed out. But an analogous instance does not require this intimate acquaintance with the subject itself, in illustration of which it is brought. It shews at once that a given hypothesis is either tenable, or not tenable,—that it is verified or not verified in some parallel case, and therefore may be granted or not, in the subject about which the argument is. Only it is necessary, for this purpose, that the analogous instance should be a familiar one,—that the exhibition of the principle in question should be clear and striking in the instances adduced. For example, to set forth the evil of tyranny, it would be quite enough to point out, as Socrates did, the case of a herdsman under whose keeping an herd should be deteriorated; and the inference would be immediate, that a career of confiscation and blood was no evidence of a good government. Again, whether it were wise to choose magistrates by lot, would be a difficult question to be decided by the direct evidence of facts bearing on the point. But when Socrates referred to the absurdity of appointing a steersman by lot, it was at once evident, that there were cases in which this mode of appointing important officers of the state would be mischievous. Such then was the kind of evidence which Socrates was constantly adducing from analogous instances to the point in question ;—an evidence, not conveying any positive instruction in the theories of the subjects to which it was applied ; but removing false impressions respecting them, and opening the mind to the reception of the truth. It was an admirable method of unteaching prejudices or vain assumptions, and of silencing the dogmatist,—a method, powerful at once for the refutation of error, and the conviction of ordinary minds incapable of being instructed by a more direct and positive evidence. Such, accordingly, was the method practised by Socrates. In pursuing any argument, “ he would proceed,” as Xenophon observes, “ by the most admitted principles ; considering this to be the sound basis of discussion. And therefore,” adds Xenophon, “ he, far beyond all I ever knew, when he spoke, carried conviction to his hearers ;” and he would say, “ that Homer had ascribed to Ulysses the merit of being a sound orator, on account of his ability to conduct a discussion, by reasoning from such principles as men acknowledged.”<note anchored="true" n="97" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Ibid. iv. 6. 15.</p></note></p><p>It was seldom, however, if ever, that Socrates avowedly<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0533.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0466"/>
argued a point. Professing to know nothing himself, he constantly challenged others as to what they professed to know. He put his questions to each person with whom he conversed, very much as the skilful experimenter in these days does to nature, so as to lead to the affirmative or negative of a particular hypothesis whose truth he would investigate. Having obtained an answer, he proceeds analytically, to found on that another question, studiously directed, in like manner, to elicit the answer which might serve for further inquiry, and so on, until he has reduced the first proposition to some simple elements, clearly shewing the truth or falsehood of the original assumption. It was as truly an experimental process on men’s minds, as that which the modern investigator performs on the subject which he examines. Those analogical instances in which he so much delighted, served the purpose of this analysis, no less than direct and proper instances, such as belong to him who investigates experimentally the nature of a particular subject. For analogies detect the state of the mind to which they are addressed. They at once call forth and illustrate its principles and habits of thought, and enable the experimenter to avail himself of the existing resources in that mind for effecting the desired conviction. They furnish him with a clue to the course which he should follow in carrying on his analysis. This was that midwifery of the mind which Socrates used sportively to describe as his peculiar occupation.</p><p>In his conversation, for example, with Euthydemus, who prided himself in having cultivated his mind by his own independent study of books, of which he had formed a large collection,—he first drew attention to the singularity of the young man’s conceit, by representing him as coming before the public, with high professions of being self-taught, and putting the parallel case of a candidate tor some medical office, who should announce that he had studiously avoided even the appearance of having <hi rend="italic">learned</hi> the art of medicine, and ask for the office on the promise of endeavouring to learn the art by his future practice. Interest being excited by this illustration of the absurdity, he next led his hearers to see the absurdity of entering on political affairs without preparation, by referring to the fact of the severe application and discipline undergone by persons who seek reputation in such accomplishments as flute-playing or riding. Then, having gained over Euthydemus as a more willing listener, he proceeds to question him as to the use for which he had collected so many books. He throws out the presumption that they have been collected with a view to enrich the mind with virtue. Supposing this to be granted, he goes on to interrogate Euthydemus as to the particular excellence of which he is in quest. He enumerates several particulars; and these being rejected, he comes at last to excellence in the art of government, which the young man concedes to be the object of his desire. This gives an opening to inquire into the qualifications necessary for such excellence. He discovers, by the answers of Euthydemus, that he conceives himself master of those moral virtues which he is induced to admit are indispensable to the good citizen. By a series of questions, however, relating to particular actions, he forces Euthydemus to admit, that what is just in one case, is unjust in another, and to contradict himself in his successive statements as to the comparative criminality of voluntary and involuntary acts of injustice. What, then, triumphantly asks the philosopher,</p><p>think you of a person who is so inconsistent with himself? The conclusion is inevitable; and Euthydemus is constrained to own, that “ he knew not what he thought he knew.” But Socrates, not yet satisfied, presses him further to explain his notion of that ignorance which he had thus displayed ; and finds, that notwithstanding his confession of his want of right instruction, he yet presumes on his pos</p><p>session of self-knowledge. Another question forces him to abandon this position. The young man then asks to be only put in the way of self-examination. Here at once his false presumptions are exposed to the searching analysis of Socrates. The inquiry turns on a knowledge of the goods and evil of life. Euthydemus enumerates one thing after another as good ; and Socrates immediately subjoins some counter evil as attending it ; until Euthydemus at last gives up his confidence in his own opinion, and declares that he knows not now what he ought to pray for to the gods. Again, Socrates presents before him pointedly the evidence he had thus given of having been diverted from consideration of the subject by the strong presumption of his knowledge of it. But that he may leave no room for escape, he calls on him, in conclusion, to state his opinion as to the nature of democracy, which at least, he conceived, Enthydemus, as a candidate for public office in a popular state, must have studied. And in like manner, he extorts from his successive answers a further proof of his ignorance and incompetence to the duties for which he had designed himself.</p><p>The effect thus produced is what Plato compares to the numbing touch of the torpedo.<note anchored="true" n="98" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Plato, Meno., 80 a. t. iv. p. 348.</p></note> The mental powers of the individual thus tried were for the moment paralyzed. He found that he only committed himself further by renewed efforts ; and “ began to think,” as Euthydemus says of himself at the close of the conversation to which we have just referred, “ whether it were not best for him to be silent, as he ran the hazard of appearing absolutely to know nothing.”</p><p>From the instance just given, it will appear that a current of irony pervaded these experimental argumentations of Socrates. There was irony mingled with earnest conviction, in that very disclaimer of all knowledge with which he set out. It was a mask, behind which he could hurl his weapons of assault on the boasted knowledge of others, whilst at the same time he expressed his serious view of the real ignorance of man, and the necessity of coming with a simple unprejudiced mind to the acquisition of truth. In the prosecution, however, of his method of analysis by interrogation, irony was indispensable for the success of his inquiry. For his object was to obtain the truth from the mouth of the person interrogated, not to state it himself ; and where he did state it accordingly, it was necessary to put it in such a form as to try whether it was the opinion or not of that person,—whether he really thought so, or adopted it on the judgment of his questioner. An ironical statement answers this purpose. It conceals the teacher, and enables him to judge, according as the hearer applies it, what the state of the hearer’s mind is, and to argue the point in question, not on premises laid down by himself, but the admissions of the other. The hearer, too, is taken by surprise. The air of seriousness which the ironical manner sets out with, and the absurdity involved, on second thought, in carrying out the supposition of a serious intent, in their united effect, provoke the smile of surprise, and win attention. As Socrates was engaged, too, in presenting unacceptable conclusions,—bringing home to the self-conceited evidences of their real ignorance,—it was necessary for him to disguise, as much as possible, the conclusion to which he was tending. He had to assume, therefore, the principles on which those with whom he conversed were reasoning and acting, and reduce these to an absurdity, by applying them as true to some evident case of ordinary experience. The skilful use made by Socrates of this irony was a powerful enforcement, in itself, of the convictions which he desired to leave on the minds of his hearers. He brought the aid of a delicate ridicule to the support of an argument, and thus exhibited the desired conclusion under a form, which, whilst it pleased the hearers, shamed them into an acknowledgment of its truth.<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0534.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0467"/>
But this irony, and the analogical instances over which it was thrown, were but approaches to that end which Socrates appears always to have had in view in his conversations, —the ascent to accurate general notions of each object of thought. He was always working his way towards an exact definition of the idea on which the discussion turned. Each instance which he adduced was a step in this progress, diminishing by its light some portion of that obscurity and confusion of thought with which he found the subject invested. He did not, indeed, reach the point which he had in view. Dialectical science was in too rude a state at present for the attainment of its perfect end. Socrates rather set an admirable example of the perseverance and energy with which the end should be pursued, than a perfect model of the method of pursuing it. His very method, indeed, confesses its own imperfection, in stopping just at the point where the way seems to be opened, and leaving the subject negatively, rather than positively defined.</p><p>This constant pursuit of exact definition is an indication of the antisceptical bent of the mind of Socrates. The foundations of morals and of all science were shaken by the speculations of his sophistical predecessors. Opinion was exalted to the prerogative of knowledge. Socrates accordingly put opinion to the test. He explored it experimentally, as it existed in different minds ; and he proved it deficient from the standard to which it had been vainly exalted. He found that it vanished before the light of investigation ; and, in fact, that in proportion as the fancies and errors of opinion were cleared away, advances were made towards more stable and certain knowledge. This knowledge, accordingly, he continually sought after. He had probably but an indistinct conception of the realities towards which he directed his pursuit. Still he appears constantly to have assumed and fully believed their existence, by steadily proceeding, as we find him to have done, through the various opinions which he encounters in discussion, until he arrives at some more definite form of thought. What Socrates only indistinctly apprehended, Plato afterwards realized in his philosophical system, and endued with existence in his celebrated theory of Ideas. But in the view of his master that theory was but dimly seen in shadow. Socrates shaped his course towards it, as he more and more limited the extravagancies of popular opinion on the various subjects which he discussed, and excluded whatever was irrelevant and foreign to the real nature of the thing. He threw doubts on what was doubtful, that there might be the less doubt and uncertainty about what remained when the doubtful was removed from a subject.</p><p>What appears to have led Socrates into this sound method of proceeding, was, as Aristotle very justly intimates, the firm moral convictions which were the great elements of his mind and character.<note anchored="true" n="99" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristot.

He not only felt their reality within himself, but he had observed, that however invisible to the outward eye, they produced real effect3 in the world ; that they were not only evidenced in the constitution of nature, but also recognized in those unwritten laws which were found everywhere the same, independently of positive institution, as well as in the enactments of particular states.<note anchored="true" n="100" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>' Xenoph.

Duval.</p></note> ’ It was moral sentiment only, the love and pursuit of good, that possessed real power. This alone, he observed, subsisted unchanged and fixed, whilst every thing else was moved by it, and derived its existence from it. It was the neglect of this primary principle in the detail of the physical theory of Anaxagoras, which had offended him in the system of that philosopher. And agreeably to this, Plato tells us of his accounting for his remaining in his prison, from the simple cause of the moral feeling by which he was actuated.</p><p>Fixing his eye accordingly on these stable eternal principles, Socrates pressed forward in every discussion towards their attainment. He would never rest in vague general classifications, which involving also much that belonged not to the subject in question, left its nature as undefined as ever. But he proceeded to a further limitation of the generalities on each subject, obliging his hearer to distinguish the subordinate genera included in the more general idea first thrown out, and thus gradually to circumscribe the subject within its proper boundaries. This was the intimate connexion of his logic and ethics. He was engaged throughout in an endeavour to remove the vain presumptions of mere opinion, and to substitute for these a real knowledge, as far as it was attainable, of the subjects themselves. He conceived that if men went astray in their conduct, acting on what they mistakenly thought right, and good, and true, it was only necessary to make them <hi rend="italic">know</hi> the truth, and they would then act on their <hi rend="italic">knowledge,</hi> as before they acted on mere <hi rend="italic">opinion,</hi> and by thus acting attain their happiness. This was but a short-sighted view of the origin of human misconduct and unhappiness, as it did not go beyond the fact of the erroneous judgment of men, to the moral perversion which was the primary cause of their failure in action. As the practical error of men arises from this perversion, it is evidently vain to think to improve their conduct, by merely substituting more correct notions of truth and duty; since this remedy does not reach the source of the malady. Such, however, was the view of Socrates. And hence he laboured, whatever might be the subject of his conversations, to lead men to contemplate the nature of the thing discussed, and to seek to define it to themselves ; thus blending the perception of the right and the good in the intellectual apprehension of the truth. Xenophon accordingly remarks the importance attributed by Socrates to the ability of distributing things into genera, on the ground, that by means of this talent “ men would become most virtuous, most formed for command, and most able in discourse.”<note anchored="true" n="102" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Xenopb.

Were we to take our estimate of what Socrates accomplished in this way from the “ Dialogues” of Plato, we must suppose Socrates to have been much more methodical in his discussions, than we should infer from the specimens given by Xenophon. Something perhaps should be allowed for the practical turn of Xenophon’s mind, and his comparative inattention to the more abstract part of the discussions of his master, whilst his fellow-pupil, on the other hand, who had an eagle-eye for<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0535.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0468"/>
theory, however remote and dazzling, would seize every hint that dropped from the lips of Socrates for the indulgence of his Speculative imagination. Still Xenophon may be regarded as having presented the most natural, as well as most exact, specimens of the method of Socrates. In the simplicity of his honest admiration and grateful recollection of the instructor and guide of his youth, he evidently records what had most impressed his own mind, both as to the substance and the manner of the conversations of Socrates, without any attempt either at dramatic or theoretic effect. From Xenophon we learn how Socrates appeared to the young Athenian, who, without any theories of his own, approached him, simply with the desire of hearing him, and applying what he might learn from the philosopher to his own improvement. Plato, on the other hand, whilst he also has given a faithful portrait of Socrates in the general outline, (and the faithfulness is shown by its close correspondence with that given by Xenophon,) studied to give effect, at the same time, to his own philosophic sketches, by placing the figure of Socrates in such a light as to harmonize with his own sublime and beautiful ideal of truth.</p><p>Thus we see how Socrates was the founder of the moral and logical science of the schools of Athens. He taught nothing positively in either branch of philosophy, but he taught men to inquire, and set them on the right track of inquiry. He trained men to think for themselves, to accept no opinion which should be contradicted by the moral and intellectual principles of their own nature, and to rest in no opinion until they had traced it up to these principles.</p><p>An exact logic, and a sound ethical system, would in time naturally result from such a direction of men’s minds.</p><p>In giving account to themselves of their opinions, men would be led to examine into the connexions and dependencies of their ideas. Observations would be made on the relations of ideas, and of words as their signs and representatives. And such observations methodically stated, would at length constitute a system of logic, such as that which Aristotle brought to light about half a century after the death of Socrates. In the mean time, however, the value of ideas in themselves, apart from their expression by words, would engage attention; and a metaphysical logic,—a logic having for its object the determination of the true notion or idea of a thing, and for its business the discussion of the probabilities or appearances of truth surrounding the matter in question,—would naturally be the first to succeed. Such was the Dialectic of Plato,—a science of discourse or discussion, as its name imports; not a particular science, like the logic which grew out of it, but as general in its comprehension as the method itself of Socrates, of which it was the formal development, and equivalent, therefore, to philosophy in the highest sense of that term, as being a search after the nature of things, or, according to him, a theory of Ideas.</p><p>Again, in giving account to themselves of their opinions, men would be led to trace the connexion of their moral sentiments and actions with an internal standard of right, independent of the variations of opinion. The examination of this relation would suggest, in process of time, a system of rules for bringing the variable—the sentiments and actions rtf the individual moral agent—into accordance with the invariable principles of his moral nature. The first ethics, identical, like the first logic, with philosophy in general, would be employed in carrying the views of men to those great principles themselves.—discussing and removing obstructions to the pure contemplation of the nature of virtue. But the more mature study of ethics, taking up the subject as a separate branch of philosophy, would develop the application of the doctrine of the fixed standard, by shewing</p><p>throughout the field of man’s moral nature, how every moral sentiment is strictly limited by its reference to such a standard. The former is the chief business of Plato’s ethical philosophy; the latter, that of Aristotle’s·—the first tending to a contemplative morality, to a love of the transcendent beauty and excellence of virtue,—the latter, to a theory of active virtue,—to a regulated state of the affections in all the offices of life;—both natural consequences in their order, of that awakening of the reason of men, of which Socrates had been the living instrument.</p><p>Socrates, at the same time, by the method which he pursued, taught men the beginning of an art of criticism. From an examination of existing opinions, the transition was natural to the systems of philosophers, and the records of the opinions of men of former days. And, in this respect, Socrates may be regarded as the father of the history of philosophy. Even had the criticism of the writings of philosophers formed no part of his conversations, still he must have prompted such an inquiry by his method of interrogating, and exacting from every one an account of his opinions. But he did more than this. Though not properly erudite, in that sense in which Plato and Aristotle were, he had yet acquainted himself with the doctrines of former philosophers. The chief part of his life was spent with his eye, not on books, but on men. Still, as we are informed by Xenophon, he had read, and had selected, in the course of his reading, whatever he thought valuable in the writings of those before him.<note anchored="true" n="103" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Xenoph.

Much of this criticism evidently belongs to the richly-various and elaborate learning of the disciple, rather than to the master from whose lips it proceeds. But that Plato is not gratuitously ascribing this kind of learning to Socrates, we see from the manner in which the less erudite disciple refers to the discussions by Socrates of the doctrines of former philosophers. Not only does Xenophon mention, in common with Plato, the comments of Socrates on the more recent system of Anaxagoras,<note anchored="true" n="104" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Xenoph. Mem. iv. 7. &lt;</p></note> ® but he refers also to his examination of the great antagonist theories of the older schools, of Parmenides, Xenophanes, Melissus, and others, on the one hand; Heraclitus, Empedocles, and their followers, on the other; though without formally introducing their names.<note anchored="true" n="105" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>» Ibid. i. 1. 1416.</p></note> ’</p><p>That various and discordant schools of philosophy should have arisen out of the excitement produced by the energetic call of Socrates to his countrymen, was in the natural course of things. Powerful minds, shaking off the yoke of sloth and indifference, and now at length roused to self-exertion, would, however generally docile to the guidance of a leader, be tempted to try their own powers, and strike out a path for themselves. We are not to wonder, then, that Aristippus, the advocate of pleasure, and Antisthenes, the austere cynic, should have been among the hearers of Socrates, or that Plato should have founded a contemplative mysticism on the sober homely philosophy of his master. Socrates, as we have all along shewn, did not propose any precise system of doctrine to his followers. His mission was accomplished in making them exert themselves. He did not desire that they should think alike, but that all should think and judge for themselves. It is no wonder, therefore, that some should have gone into extravagancies, and that, whilst general good resulted from the excitement, partial evil also should have accompanied it. An Aristippus, or an Antisthenes, could not have issued from the school of Pythagoras. But how much evil generally may have resulted from the abject submission to the authoritative opinions of Pythagoras, in the neglect of self-examina<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0536.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0469"/>
tion and self-knowledge, and disregard of personal responsibility, by those who implicitly received them ?</p><p>But whilst we ascribe to Socrates the merit of having given at once the impulse and the character to Grecian philosophy, we must yet single out for special commendation, his admirable services in reviving the forgotten theory of natural religion among his countrymen. Of religion, indeed, as an external system of positive laws enforced by the state, they had, as we have before observed, more than enough. But religion, as a system of truth, was scarcely thought of. When Aristophanes<note anchored="true" n="106" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Aristoph. Eq. 82.</p></note> brings on the stage Demosthenes asking Nicias, well-known as Nicias was tor his superstitious feeling; <hi rend="smallcaps">«vîov</hi> ⅛γvi <hi rend="italic">yàp fffois ;</hi> “ really, then, do you think there are gods?"<note anchored="true" n="107" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>* Thucyd. ii. 53, v. 105. <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Er <hi rend="italic">rh ûtîov νομίστως,—</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f∣γoiμd)a τh θiiov 6oξr∣,</hi> are expressions of</p><p>Thucydides, which shew the low ground on which religion was rested in Greece.</p></note> the allusion is evidently to the real irreligion, which the most rigid and scrupulous worship of the heathen but ill concealed. Resting their belief of a Divine agency in the world on tradition and authority, men omitted to explore the witness of God in their own nature, and in the world around them. Consequently, they were exposed to every objection which the ingenuity of theory, or the folly and wickedness of the world, might suggest to their uninformed credulity, against the positive truth of their religions system. As infidelity in these days finds its refuge in the belief of an infallible church, and is itself in its turn the miserable refuge from the despotism of the very infallibility before which it crouches in silence ; so among the votaries of heathen superstition, the doubts and misgivings of the thoughtful intellect, and the troubled heart, were left to prey on themselves, shut up in abject submission to an external authority, and unprepared for their own defence and support. Socrates addressed a great portion of that practical information, which, in spite of his disclaimer of the office of a teacher, he was ever imparting to all around him, to the remedy of this distempered state of the religious feelings. He saw plainly enough that the vulgar theology could not be defended on the ground of rational evidence.<note anchored="true" n="108" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Plato, Euthyphro, p. 6. a. <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Aλλo <hi rend="italic">μoι lari πpi&gt;ς φiλiov, σiι ώς t'ikηθi&gt;ς ήγή ταυτα ytγovmu</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Ôutmç</hi>; s.τ.λ. Op. i. 12.</p></note> This, therefore, in his respect for the ancient laws and customs of his country, he was content to lean on the sanction of positive institution. A great reverence, he justly thought, was due to the wisdom embodied in ancient laws ; and he would not encourage persons wantonly to abandon the presumptions of truth and right naturally belonging to established institutions. At least, he would not have men rashly set up their own notions against the presumptions in favour of the wisdom of other men and other days, recommended as these were by some experience of their stability and use, whilst each man’s private opinions had no such sanction, or no equivalent sanction. But he felt also, that the internal sense of religion wanted other support,—that presumptions of human vanity and corruption were, and ever would be, brought to bear against this ; and that such assaults could only be repelled by a well-informed reason prepared for the encounter. He therefore provided his hearer with a solid and impregnable argument in favour of the being and providence and moral government of the Deity. Tire argument was what is now familiarly known as the argument from final causes, or the evidences of almighty design in the fabric and course of nature. For this purpose, he gave an induction of instances from the world without, and from the</p><p>intellectual and moral constitution of man himself, of admirable design in the adaptation of means to ends. He called upon men, with such evidences of divine benevolence around them, not to wait for any more palpable proof, such as judging from the analogy of nature they had no ground to expect, but to believe in the existence of invisible things from their effects, and from the good received to reverence the Deity its author. The language, indeed, attributed to him by Xenophon, is in remarkable correspondence with that of St. Paul, declaring, that “ the invisible things of God are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead;"<note anchored="true" n="109" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Xenoph.

But Socrates, after all, has the distinguished merit of having given the argument from final causes an explicit statement and due importance in the proof of natural religion.</p><p>When we think that truths of such high import and interest were sedulously propagated for so many years in the place of concourse of the civilized world, we naturally turn from the contemplation of the living philosopher, to ask, what was the result—what was the amount of beneficial influence on the people to whom his mission was addressed. We cannot doubt, that on the whole the influence was great,—that the serious errors of many in regard to the conduct of life were corrected,—their minds opened to consider the great purposes for which they had been bom into the world, and to look for happiness, not from transitory sensual enjoyments, but from the sober and vigorous exertion of their powers of thought and action. In some conspicuous instances, indeed, his endeavours strikingly failed. Critias and Alcibiades were known wherever the name of Athens was heard. And their wild and guilty career presented to the public eye a splendid mirror, from which the most unjust censure was reflected on the philosopher himself. But the many instances which must have occurred in humbler life, of his success in the work of moral reformation, are passed over in silence. That there were such instances Xenophon has given us to understand, when he observes, in his simple manner, that Socrates dismissed those who resorted to him, improved by their intercourse with him.<note anchored="true" n="112" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ Xenoph.

The men of that day, as of the present, had the voice of God distinctly speaking within them, “ their conscience bearing witness, and their thoughts accusing or excusing them,” according to that just description of them which Scripture has set before us. But if they<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0537.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0470"/>
shut their ears, and hardened their hearts against this divine instruction, how would they listen to one who was ever upbraiding them with their dulness and inattention to its lessons and admonitions ? Rather, they would feel towards him, according to that apposite illustration of Plato, as persons dozing towards one that should wake them up, and, after ridding themselves of his disturbance, think quietly to compose themselves to sleep again.<note anchored="true" n="113" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>@@@ Plato, Apol.

Israel rejected its prophets ; but through all the perverseness of the people, those prophets prepared the way of the Lord. The heathen world, in like</p><p>manner, refused to listen to its monitors, its legislators, and philosophers ; but in spite of their general obduracy and indifference, we cannot but believe that the call was not utterly fruitless. To the original influence of Socrates especially, brought as this was to bear on the great centre of heathen civilization, it may have been in great measure owing, that the light of religious and moral truth was kept alive, however faintly burning, for successive generations, in many a dark abode of superstition ; and that in a later day, the doctrine of grace and truth appealed not without effect to the Areopagite of Athens, the jailor of Philippi, and the Roman proconsul at Paphos. He certainly excited a spirit of eager curiosity on moral subjects ; as was evidenced in the rise of the schools of philosophy to meet the demands of that spirit, and in the moral character of the disquisitions pursued in them. But this spirit could not have exhausted itself in mere literary discussion. There were doubtless the waverings of anxious minds beyond the precincts of the schools, to be settled ; cravings after more safe direction of personal conduct than such as the world around them presented, to be satisfied. Such a state of things would keep men looking for gospel-truth. Some would feel, as Alcibiades is represented by Plato, after a conversation with Socrates, and Euthydemus by Xenophon, at a loss how to pray. And to such the answer of Socrates, as given by Plato, would very indistinctly perhaps, yet not without earnest hope, suggest the high thought, that they must wait until they could be informed by God himself, as to the proper disposition towards God and men ; or until one should come to discipline them,—to remove the darkness from their eyes, and enable them to discern both good and evil.<note anchored="true" n="115" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Alcib. ii. p. 150, d. ∏υτj oiv <hi rend="italic">πaρtσruι ό χρόνος δvτoς,</hi> ω <hi rend="italic">Σωκράπς ;</hi> aal <hi rend="italic">τίς &amp; παιΰίύιτων</hi> ’, ηδrστa <hi rend="italic">yap αν μοι δοκώ ιδιιν τόντον rov άνθρωπον τίς Ιοτιν</hi> Σ. <hi rend="italic">Οντας iστιv ω μιλ.ι π.ρι σου, κ.τ.λ.</hi> Op. ν. ρ. 100.</p></note> ®</p><p>(J.
