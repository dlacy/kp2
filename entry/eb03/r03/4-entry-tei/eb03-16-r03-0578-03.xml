<p>View oſ the Tragedies of the laſt Age, and afterwards publiſhed a tragedy named <hi rend="italic">Edgar.</hi> For a critic he was certainly not well qualified, for he wanted candour ; nor is his judgment much to be relied on, who could condemn Shakeſpeare with ſuch rigid ſeverity. His tragedy will ſhow, that his talents for poetry were by no means equal to thoſe whoſe poems he has publicly •cenſured. But though he has no title to the appellation of <hi rend="italic">poet</hi> or <hi rend="italic">critic,</hi> as an antiquarian and hiſtorian his memory will long be preſerved. His <hi rend="italic">Faedera,</hi> which is a collection of all the public tranſactions, treaties, &amp;c. of the kings of England with foreign princes, is eſteemed one of our moſt authentic and valuable records, and is oftener referred to- by the beſt Engliſh hiſtorians than perhaps any other book in the language. It was publiſhed at London in the beginning of the preſent century in 17 volumes folio. Three volumes more were added by Sanderſen after Rymer’s death. The whole were reprinted at the Hague in 10 vols in 1739. They were abridged by Rapin in French, and inſerted in Le Clerc’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque,</hi> a tranſlation of which was made by Stephen Whatley, and printed in 4 vols 8vo, 1731.</p><p>Rymer died 1 4th December 1713, and was buried in the pariſh church of St Clement’s Danes. Some ſpecimens of his poetry are preſerved in the ſirſt volume •of Mr NichoΓs Select Collection of Miſcellaneous Poems, 1780.</p>
