                <p><label>ROSTOCK</label> a town of Germany, in the grand duchy of
                    Mecklenburg-Schwerin, one of the most important commercial cities on the Baltic.
                    It is situated on the left bank of the estuary of the Warnow, 8 m. from the port
                    of Warnemünde on the Baltic. 177 m. N.W. of Berlin by rail, 80 m. N.E. of
                    Lübeck, and 106 m. S. of Copenhagen. Pop. (1905) 60,790. It consists of three
                    parts—the old town to the east, and the middle and new towns to the west—of
                    which the first retains some of the antique features of a Hanse town, while the
                    last two are for the most part regularly and handsomely built. There are also
                    several suburbs. The town has four gates, one of them dating from the 14th
                    century, and some fine squares, among them the Blücher Platz, with a statue of
                    Blücher, who was born here, and the Neue Markt. Rostock was a fortress of some
                    strength, but the old fortifications have been razed, and their site is occupied
                    by promenades. Rostock has five old churches: St Mary’s, dating from 1398 to
                    1472, one of the most imposing Gothic buildings in Mecklenburg, with two
                    Romanesque towers and containing a magnificent bronze font and a curious clock;
                    St Nicholas’s, begun about 1250 and restored in 1450, and again in 1890-94; St
                    Peter’s, with a lofty tower over 400 ft. high, built in 1400, which serves as a
                    landmark to ships at sea; St James’s, completed in 1588, and the church of the
                    Holy Rood, begun in 1270. St Mary’s church contains a monument marking the
                    original tomb of Hugo Grotius, who died in Rostock in 1645, though his remains
                    were afterwards removed to Delft. Among other interesting buildings are the
                    curious 14th-century Gothic town hall, the façade of which is concealed by a
                    Renaissance addition; the palace of the grand duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,
                    built in 1702; the law courts, built in 1878-79; the university buildings,
                    erected in 1867-70; and an assembly hall of the estates of Mecklenburg
                    (Ständehaus), a handsome Gothic building erected in 1889-93.</p>
               <p>The university of Rostock was founded in 1418 by Dukes Johann III. and Albrecht
                    V. of Mecklenburg. From 1437 till 1443 it had its seat at Greifswald in.
                    consequence of commotions at Rostock; and in 1760 it was again removed, on this
                    occasion to Bützow. The professors appointed by the city, however, still taught
                    at Rostock, so that there were practically two universities in the duchy until
                    1789, when they were reunited at the original seat. Rostock is the seat of the
                    supreme court for both the duchies of Mecklenburg, and is well equipped with
                    schools, hospitals, and other institutions.</p>
               <p>Although the population, commerce and wealth of Rostock have declined since
                    .Hanse days, it has a considerable, trade, being the chief commercial town of
                    Mecklenburg and owning a considerable fleet. Vessels drawing 16 ft. of water are
                    able to get uç to the wharves. By far the most important export is grain, which
                    goes almost entirely to British ports; but wool, flax and cattle are also
                    shipped. The chief imports are coal from Great Britain, herrings from Sweden,
                    petroleum, from America, timber, wine and colonial goods. Rostock has an
                    important fair at Whitsuntide, lasting for Fourteen days, and also a frequented
                    wool and cattle market. The industries of the town are varied. One of the chief
                    is shipbuilding. Machinery, chemicals, sugar, malt, paper, musical instruments,
                    cotton, straw hats, tobacco, carpets, soap, playing cards, chocolate and
                    dye-stuffs are among the manufactures. The town also contains distilleries,
                    saw-mills, oil-mills, tanneries, breweries and electrical works.</p>
               <p>Local historians assert that a village existed on the site of Rostock as early
                    as <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 329, but no certain proofs have been traced of
                    any earlier community than that founded here in the 12th century, which is said
                    to have received municipal rights in 1218. The earliest signs of commercial
                    prosperity date from about 1260. For a time Rostock was under the dominion of
                    the kings of Denmark. Soon after returning under the protection of Mecklenburg
                    in the 14th century it joined the Hanseatic League; and was one of the original
                    members of the powerful Wendish Hansa, in which it exercised an influence second
                    only to that of Lübeck. The most prosperous epoch of its commercial history
                    began in the latter half of the 15th century, precisely at the period when its
                    political power began to wane. Rostock, however, never entirely lost the
                    independence which it enjoyed as a Hanse town; and in 1788, as the result of
                    long contentions with the rulers of Mecklenburg, it secured for itself a
                    peculiar and liberal municipal constitution, administered by three burgomasters
                    and three chambers. In 1880 this constitution was somewhat modified, and the
                    city became less like a state within a state. It has belonged to
                    Mecklenburg-Schwerin since 1695; in 1712 it was taken by the Swedes, in 1715 by
                    the Danes and in 1716 by the Russians. The badge of Rostock is the figure 7; and
                    a local rhyme explains that there are 7 doors to St Mary’s church, 7 streets
                    from the market-place, 7 gates on the landward side and 7 wharves on the seaward
                    side of the town, 7 turrets on the town-hall, which has 7 bells, and 7 linden
                    trees in the park.</p>
