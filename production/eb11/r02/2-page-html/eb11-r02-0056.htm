<p><span class="font0">the strongest influence over her brother, and her published letters reveal a mind almost equal, a moral nature superior, to&nbsp;his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was not mathematics but philology which was to settle the gathering doubts of Ernest Renan. His course completed at&nbsp;Issy, he entered the college of St Sulpice in order to take his&nbsp;degree in philology prior to entering the church; and here he&nbsp;began the study of Hebrew. He saw that the second part of&nbsp;Isaiah differs from the first not only in style but in date; that the&nbsp;grammar and the history of the Pentateuch are posterior to the&nbsp;time of Moses; that the book of Daniel is clearly apocryphal.&nbsp;It followed from his training that, if you admit one error in a&nbsp;revealed text, you incriminate the whole. Secretly, Renan felt&nbsp;himself cut off from the communion of saints, and yet with his&nbsp;whole heart he desired to live the life of a Catholic priest&nbsp;Hence a struggle between vocation and conviction; owing to&nbsp;Henriette, conviction gained the day. In October 1845 Renan&nbsp;left the seminary of St Sulpice for Stavistas, a lay college of the&nbsp;Oratorians. Finding himself even there too much under the&nbsp;domination of the church, a few weeks later he reluctantly broke&nbsp;the last tie which bound him to the religious life and entered&nbsp;M. Crouzet’s school for boys as an usher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is always dangerous to educate a really great mind in only one order of truth. Renan, brought up by-priests in a world&nbsp;ruled by authority and curious only of feeling and opinion, was to&nbsp;accept the scientific ideal with an extraordinary expansion of all&nbsp;his faculties. He was henceforth ravished by the splendour&nbsp;of the cosmos. At the end of his life he wrote of AmieI, “ The&nbsp;man who has time to keep a private diary has never understood&nbsp;the immensity of the universe.” The certitudes of physical and&nbsp;natural science were revealed to Renan in 1846 by the chemist&nbsp;Marcellin Berthelot, then a boy of eighteen, his pupil at M.&nbsp;Crouzet’s school. To the day of Renan’s death their friendship&nbsp;continued. Renan was occupied as usher only in the evenings.&nbsp;In the daytime he continued his researches in Semitic philology.&nbsp;In 1847 he obtained the Prix Volney—one of the principal distinctions awarded by the Academy of Inscriptions—for the&nbsp;manuscript of his “ General History of Semitic Languages.”&nbsp;In 1847 he took his degree as Agrégé de Philosophie; that is to&nbsp;say, fellow of the university, and was offered a place as master&nbsp;in the lycée of Vendôme. In 1848 a small temporary appointment to the lycée of Versailles permitted him to return to the&nbsp;capital and resume his studies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The revolution of 1848 aroused in Renan that side of him which loved the priesthood because “ the priest lives for his fellows.”&nbsp;He for the first time confronted the problems of Democracy.&nbsp;The result was an immense volume, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Future of Science,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which remained in manuscript until 1890. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">VAvenir de la&nbsp;science</span><span class="font0"> is an attempt to conciliate the privileges of a necessary&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">elite</span><span class="font0"> with the diffusion of the greatest good of the greatest&nbsp;number. The difficulty haunted Renan throughout his life.&nbsp;By the time he had finished his elaborate scheme for regenerating&nbsp;society by means of a devoted aristocracy of knowdedge, and the&nbsp;diffusion of culture, the year 1848 was past, and with it his fever&nbsp;of Democracy. In 1849 the French government sent him to&nbsp;Italy on a scientific mission. He remained eight months abroad,&nbsp;during which he forgot his anxiety about the toilers’ lot.&nbsp;Hitherto he had known nothing of art. In Italy the artist in him&nbsp;awoke and triumphed over the savant and the reformer. On&nbsp;his return to Paris Renan lived with his sister Henriette. A small&nbsp;post at the National Library, .together with his sister’s savings,&nbsp;furnished him with the means of livelihood. In the evenings he&nbsp;wrote for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Revue des deux mondes</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Debats</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;exquisite essays which appeared in 1857 and 1859 under the&nbsp;titles </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Études P histoire religieuse</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Essais de morale et de&nbsp;critique.</span><span class="font0"> In 1852 his book on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Averroès</span><span class="font0"> had brought him not&nbsp;only his doctor’s degree, but his first reputation as a thinker.&nbsp;In his two volumes of essays Renan shows himself a Liberal, but&nbsp;no longer a Democrat. Nothing, according to his philosophy,&nbsp;is less important than prosperity. The greatest good of the&nbsp;greatest number is a theory as dangerous as it is illusory. Man&nbsp;is not bom to be prosperous, but to realize, in a little vanguard of&nbsp;chosen spirits, an ideal superior to the ideal of yesterday. Only&nbsp;the few can attain a complete development. Yet there is a&nbsp;solidarity between the chosen few and the masses which produce&nbsp;them; each has a duty to the other. The acceptance of this&nbsp;duty is the only foundation for a moral and just society The&nbsp;aristocratic idea has seldom been better stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The success of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Études Phistoire religieuse</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Essais de morale</span><span class="font0"> had made the name of Renan known to a cultivated&nbsp;public. While Mademoiselle Renan remained shut up at home&nbsp;copying her brother’s manuscripts or compiling material for his&nbsp;work, the young philosopher began to frequent more than one&nbsp;Parisian salon, and especially the studio of Ary Scheffer, at that&nbsp;time a noted social centre. In 1856 he proposed to marry&nbsp;Cornélie Scheffer, the niece and adopted daughter of the great&nbsp;Dutch painter. Not without a struggle Henriette consented&nbsp;not only to the marriage, but to make her home with the young&nbsp;couple, whose housekeeping depended on the sum that she&nbsp;could contribute. The history of this romance has been told by.&nbsp;Renan in the memorial essay which he wrote some six years later,&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ma Sœur Henriette.</span><span class="font0"> His marriage brought much&nbsp;brightness into his life, a naturalness into his style and a greater&nbsp;attention to the picturesque. He did not forsake his studies in&nbsp;Semitic philology, and in 1859 appeared his translation of the’&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Book of Job</span><span class="font0"> with an introductory essay, followed in 1859 by the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Song of Songs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Renan was now a candidate for the chair of Hebrew and Chaldaic languages at the Collège de France, which he had&nbsp;desired since first he studied Hebrew at the seminary of St&nbsp;SuIpice. The death of the scholar Quatremère had left this post&nbsp;vacant in 1857. No one in France save Renan was capable of&nbsp;filling it. The Catholic party, upheld by the empress, would&nbsp;not appoint an unfrocked seminarist, a notorious heretic, to a&nbsp;chair of Biblical exegesis. Yet the emperor wished to conciliate&nbsp;Ernest Renan. He offered to send the young scholar on an&nbsp;archaeological mission to Phoenicia. Renan immediately accepted.&nbsp;Leaving his wife at home with their baby son, Renan left France,&nbsp;accompanied by his sister, in the summer of i860. Madame&nbsp;Renan joined them in January 1861, returning to France in&nbsp;July. The mission proved fruitful in Phoenician inscriptions&nbsp;which Renan published in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mission de Phénicie.</span><span class="font0"> They form&nbsp;the base of that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Inscriptionurn Semiticarurn</span><span class="font0"> on which he&nbsp;used in later years to declare that he founded his claim to remembrance. He wished to complete his exploration of the&nbsp;upper range of Lebanon ; he remained, therefore, with Henriette&nbsp;to affront the dangerous miasma of a Syrian autumn. At&nbsp;Amshit, near Byblos, Henriette Renan died of intermittent&nbsp;fever on the 24th of September 1861. ' Her brother, himself at&nbsp;death’s door, was carried unconscious on board a ship waiting&nbsp;in harbour and bound for France. The sea air revived him,&nbsp;but he reached France broken apparently in heart and health.&nbsp;His sister in her last days had entreated him not to give up his&nbsp;candidature for the chair of Hebrew, and on the nth of January&nbsp;1862 the Minister of Public Instruction ratified Renan’s election&nbsp;to the post. But his opening lecture, in which, amid the&nbsp;applause of the students, Renan declared Jesus Christ “ an&nbsp;incomparable Man,” alarmed the Catholic party. Renan’s&nbsp;lectures were pronounced a disturbance of the public peace, and&nbsp;he was suspended. On the 2nd of June 1864, on opening the&nbsp;newspaper, Renan saw that he had been transferred from the&nbsp;chair of Hebrew at the College of France to the post of sublibrarian at the National Library. He wrote to the Minister of&nbsp;Public Instruction : “ Pecunia tua tecum sit ! ” He refused&nbsp;the new position, was deprived of his chair, and henceforth&nbsp;depended solely upon his pen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Henriette had told him to write the life of Jesus. They had begun it together ih Syria, she copying the pages as he wrote&nbsp;, them, with a New Testament and a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Josephus</span><span class="font0"> for all his library.&nbsp;The book bears the mark of its origin—it is filled with the&nbsp;atmosphere of the East. It is the work of a man familiar with&nbsp;the Bible and theology, and no less acquainted with the inscriptions, monuments, types and landscapes of Syria. But it is&nbsp;scarcely the work of a great scholar: Renan’s debt to the school</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
