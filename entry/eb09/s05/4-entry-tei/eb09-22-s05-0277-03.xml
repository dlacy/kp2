He accompanied Louis XV. in the campaign of 1744-48, and attained high military rank, which he owed more to his courtiership than to his generalship. Soon after the beginning of the Seven Years’ War, through the influence of Madame de Pompadour, he was put in command of a corps of 24,000 men, and on 4th November 1757 he sustained the crushing defeat of Rossbach (see vol. ix. pp. 588-591, where also some subsequent and more favourable episodes of his military career are briefly indicated). After 1763 he lived the life of an ordinary courtier in Paris, dying on July 4, 1787.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
