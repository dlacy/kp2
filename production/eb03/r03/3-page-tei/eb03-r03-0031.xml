R. C. which ſome among them interpret <hi rend="italic">fratres roris cοcti ;</hi>  it being pretended, that the matter of the philoſophers Hone is dew concocted, exalted, &amp;c. Some, who are no friends to free-maſonry, make the preſent flouriſhing ſociety c*' .ree-mafons a branch of Roſicrucians ; or rather the Roſicrucians themſelves, under a new name or relation, viz. as retainers to building. And it is certain, there are ſome free-maſons who have all the characters of Roſicrucians ; but how the æra and original oſ ma-ſonry (ſee Masonry), and that of Roſicrucianiſm, here fixed from Naudæus, who has written expreſsly on the ſubject, conſiſt. we leave others to judge.</p><p>Notwithſtanding the pretended antiquity oſ the Roſicrucians, it is probable that the alchemiſts, Paracelſiſts, or fire-philoſophers, who ſpread themſelves through al∙ moſt all Europe about the cloſe of the iixteenth century, aſſumed about this period the obſcure and ambiguous title of Roſicrucian brethren, which commanded at firſt ſome degree of reſpect, as it ſeemed to be borrowed from the arms of Luther, which were a croſs placed upon a roſe. But the denomination evidently appears to be derived from the ſcience of chemiſtry. It is not compounded, ſays Moſheim, as many imagine, of the two words <hi rend="italic">roſa</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">crux,</hi>  which ſignify roſe and croſs, but of the latter of theſe words, and the Latin <hi rend="italic">rοs,</hi>  which ſigniſies dew. Of all natural bodies, dew was deemed the moſt powerful diſſolvent of gold ; and the croſs, in the chemical language, is equivalent to light, becauſe the figure of a croſs -R exhibits, at the ſame time, the three letters of which the word ∕κx<hi rend="sup">,</hi>, or iight, is compounded. Now<hi rend="italic">lux</hi>  is called, by this ſect, the leed or menftruum of the red dragon, or, in other words, that groſs and corporeal light which, when properly digeſted and modified, produces gold. Hence it follows, if this etymology be admitted, that a Roſicrucian philoſopher is one who, by the intervention and aſ-ſiſtance of the dew, ſeeks for light, or, in other words, the ſubſtance called the philoſopher’s ſtone. The true meaning and energy of this denomination did not eſcape the penetration and ſagacity of Gaſſendi, as appears by his <hi rend="italic">Examen Philoſophiai Fludclαηα,</hi>  ſect. ιy. tom. iii. p. 261. And it was more fully explained by Renaudot, in his <hi rend="italic">Conferences Publiques,</hi>  tom. iv. p. 87.</p><p>At the head of theſe fanatics were Robert Fludd, an Engliſh phyſician, Jacob Behmen, and Michael Mayer ; but if rumour may be credited, the preſent Illuminated have a head of higher rank. The common principles, which ſerve as a kind of centre of union to the Roſicrucian ſociety, are the following : They all maintain, that the diſſolution of bodies, by the power of fire, is the only way by which men can arrive at true wiſdom, and come to diſcern the firſt principles of things. They all acknowledge a certain analogy and harmony between the powers of nature and the doctrines of religion; and believe that the Deity governs the kingdom of grace by the ſame laws with which he rules the kingdom of nature ; and hence they are led to uſe chemical denominations to expreſs the truths of religion. They all hold, that there is a fort of divine energy, or foul, diffuſed through the frame of the uni-verſe, which ſome call the <hi rend="italic">argheus,</hi>  others the <hi rend="italic">univerfal fpirit,</hi>  and which others mention under different appellations. They all talk in the moſt ſuperſtitious manner of what they call the ſignatures of things, of the power</p><p>oſ the ſtars over all corporeal beings, and their particular influence upon the human race, of the efficacy of magic, and the various ranks and orders of demons — Theſe demons they divide into two orders, <hi rend="italic">ſylphs</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">gnomes ; </hi>which ſupplied the beautiful machinery of Pope’s <hi rend="italic">Rape oſ the Lock.</hi>  I n fine, the Roſicrucians and all their fanatical deſcend'ants agree in throwing out the moſt crude incomprehenſrble notions and ideas, in the moſt obſcure, quaint, and unuſual expreſſions.—Moſh. Eccl.

In its. flouriſhing ſtate it was of great extent, and comprifed∙ within its walls 27 churches, and as many convents.— Its preſent circumference is ſearcely half an Engliſh mile, and it contains only about 1620 ſou.ls. The houſes are of brick, and of a neat appearance. The only remains of its original magnificence are the ruins of a palace and of the cathedral, a brick building with two ſpires, in which the kings of Denmark are interred» Little of the original building now remains. According to Holberg, it was conſtructed of wood, and afterwards built with ſtone, in the reign of Canute.— From an inſcription in the choir, it appears to have been founded by Harold V I. who is ſtyled king of Denmark, England, and Norway. Some verſes, in barbarous Latin, obſcurely allude to the principal incidents of his life ; adding, that he built this church, and died in 980.—See Coxe’s Travels into Poland, Ruſſia, Sweden, and Denmark, vol. ii. p. $25.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">ROSLEY-hill, a village in Cumberland, with </hi>a fair on Whit-Monday, and every fortnight after till September 29. for horſes, horned cattle, and linen cloth.</p><p>ROSLIN, or Roskelvn, a place in the county of Mid Lothian in Scotland, remarkable for an ancient chapel and caille. The chapel was founded in 1446, by St Clare, prince of Orkney, for a provoſt, fix prebendaries, and two ſinging-boys. The outſide is ornamented with a multitude of pinnacles, and variety of ludicrous ſculptuie. The inſide is 69 feet long, the breadth 34, ſupported by two rows of cluſtered pillars, between ſeven and eight feet high, with an aiſle on each ſide. The arches are obtuſely Gothic. Theſe arches are continued acroſs the ſide-aiſles, but the centre of the church is one continued arch, elegantly divided into compartments, and finely ſculptured. The capitals of the pillars are enriched with foliage, and a variety of figures ; and amidſt a heavenly concert appears a cherubim blowing the ancient Highland bagpipes. The caille is ſeated on a peninſulated rock, in a deep glen far beneath, and acceſſible by a bridge of great height. This had been the ſeat of the great lamily of <hi rend="italic">Sinclair. </hi>Of this houſe was Oliver, favourite of James V. and the innocent cauſe of the loſs of the battle of Solway Moſs, by reaſon of the envy of the nobility on account of his being preferred to the command.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
