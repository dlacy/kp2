<p><span class="font1">gametophyte, and the sporophyte is represented only by the oospore, so that the life-history resembles that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nemalion.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">It is probable that this conclusion is generaUy true of the&nbsp;whole group; at any rate of those forms (Desmids, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Spirogyra<sub>i&nbsp;</sub>Oedogoniurn, Chara)</span><span class="font1"> which have been more or less investigated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Turning to the Fungi, somewhat simUar results have been obtained in the few forms that have been studied from, this&nbsp;point of view. In the sexual Ascomycetes it appears (Harper)&nbsp;that meiosis takes place in the ascocarp just before the development of the spores, so that the Ufe-history essen tiaUy resembles&nbsp;that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nemalion.</span><span class="font1"> Again, in certain Uredineae, having an&nbsp;aecidium-stage and a teleutospore-stage, which is apparently a&nbsp;sexual process has been observed (Blackman, Christman) which&nbsp;is described in the section on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Abnormalities of Reproduction,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;the Ufe-history is as foUows. The sexual act having taken&nbsp;place, a row of aecidiospores is developed in the aecidium, each&nbsp;of which contains two conjugate nuclei derived from the sexual&nbsp;nuclei. The myceUum developed from the aecidiospore, as&nbsp;weU as the Uredospores and the teleutospores that it bears,&nbsp;shows two conjugate nuclei. When, however, the teleuto-spore is about to germinate, the two nuclei fuse (thus completing&nbsp;the sexual act) and meiosis takes place. As a result the promy-ceUum developed from the teleutospore, and the sporidia that it&nbsp;produces, are uninucleate: so are also the myceUum developed&nbsp;from the sporidium, and the female organs (archicarps) bome&nbsp;upon it. Hence the limits of the sporophyte are the aecidiospore and the teleutospore: those of the gametophyte, the&nbsp;teleutospore and the aecidiospore.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">SimUar observations have been made upon other Uredineae with a more contracted Ufe-history. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phragmidium Potentillae-canadensis</span><span class="font1"> is a rust that has no aecidium-stage: consequently&nbsp;the primary uredospores are borne by the mycelium produced&nbsp;on infection of the host by a sporidium. It has been observed&nbsp;(Christman) that the sporogenous hyphae fuse in pairs, suggesting a sexual act; then the primary uredospores are developed&nbsp;in rows from the fused pairs of hyphae which thus behave as&nbsp;sexual organs (archicarps), and each such uredospore contains&nbsp;two conjugate nuclei. Although the research has not been&nbsp;carried beyond this point, it may be inferred that in this case, as&nbsp;in the preceding, nuclear fusion and meiosis take place in the&nbsp;teleutospore. Here the sporophyte is represented by the&nbsp;u redo-form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Finally, in some of the fungi in which no sexual organs have yet been discovered, this method of investigation has made it&nbsp;probable that some kind of sexual act takes place nevertheless.&nbsp;Thus in the Uredine </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Puccinia malvacearum,</span><span class="font1"> which has only&nbsp;teleutospore- and sporidium-stages, it has been observed (Blackman) that the formation of the teleutospores is preceded by a&nbsp;binucleate condition of the hyphae. The same idea is suggested&nbsp;by the binucleate basidia of the Basidiomycetes, which correspond to the teleutospores of the Uredineae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Ufe-histories sketched in the preceding paragraphs show that one of the complexities met with in the Thallophyta is&nbsp;that meiosis does not always take place at the same point in thc&nbsp;life-history. In the higher plants the incidence of meiosis is&nbsp;generally, though not absolutely, constant: it may be stated as&nbsp;a rule that in the Bryophyta, Pteridophyta and Phanerogams&nbsp;it takes place in the spore-mother-cells. In the Thallophyta&nbsp;this rule does not hold. In some of them, it is true, meiosis&nbsp;immediately precedes, as in the higher plants, the formation of&nbsp;certain spores, the tetraspores (Dictyotaceae, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polysiphonia),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the teleutospores (Uredineae): but in others it immediately&nbsp;precedes the development of the sexual organs (Fucaceae), or&nbsp;follows more or less directly upon the sexual act (Green Algae,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nemalion,</span><span class="font1"> Ascomycetes).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Ufe-history of most Thallophyta is further complicated by the capacity of the gametophyte of the sporophyte to reproduce themselves by ceUs termed gonidia, a capacity that is&nbsp;wholly lacking in the higher plants. The karyology of gonidia&nbsp;has not yet been sufficiently investigated: but when, as in the&nbsp;Green Algae and the Oomycetous Fungi, thegonidia are developed&nbsp;by and reproduce the gametophyte, it may be inferred that&nbsp;they, Uke the gametophyte, are haploid. One case, at any&nbsp;rate, of the reproduction of the sporophyte by gonidia is fully&nbsp;known, that of the Uredineae just described, in which the uredo-form, which is a phase of the sporophyte, is reproduced by the&nbsp;uredo-spores which arc binucleate, that is dipIoid, and may be&nbsp;distinguished as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">diplogonidia.</span><span class="font1"> In any case the resuIt is that&nbsp;whereas in the higher plants each of the alternating generations&nbsp;occurs but once in the life-history, in these Thallophyta the Ufe-history may include a succession of gametophytic or of sporo-phytic forms This is, in fact, a distinguishing feature of the&nbsp;group. The higher plants present a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regular</span><span class="font1"> alternation of&nbsp;generations: whereas, in the ThaUophyta, though they probably&nbsp;all present some kind of aIternation of generations, yet it is&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">irregular</span><span class="font1"> in the various ways and for the various reasons&nbsp;mentioned above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sufficient information has been given in the preceding pages to render possible the consideration of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">origin</span><span class="font1"> of alternation&nbsp;of generations. To begin quite at the beginning, it may be&nbsp;assumed that the primitive form of reproduction was purely&nbsp;vegetative, merely division of the uniceUular organism when it&nbsp;had attained the Umits of its own growth. FoUowing on this&nbsp;came reproduction by a gonidium: that is, the protoplasm of&nbsp;the ceU, at the end of its vegetative life, became quiescent,&nbsp;surrounded itself with a proper waU, or was set free as a motile&nbsp;ciliated cell, having in some unexplained way become capable&nbsp;of originating a new course of Ufc </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(rejuvenescence)</span><span class="font1"> on germination.&nbsp;Then, as can be weU traced in the Brown and* Green Algae (see&nbsp;Algae), these primitive reproductive cells (gonidia) began to&nbsp;fuse in pairs: in other words, they graduaUy became sexual.&nbsp;This stage can StiU be observed in some of these Algae </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.&nbsp;Ulothrix, Ectocarpus)</span><span class="font1"> where the zoospores (gonidia) may either&nbsp;germinate independently, or fuse in pairs to form a zygote.&nbsp;GraduaUy the sexuality of these cells became more pronounced :&nbsp;losing the capacity for independent germination, they acquired&nbsp;the external characters of more or less differentiated sexual&nbsp;ceUs, and the gametangia producing them developed into male&nbsp;and female sexual organs. But this advancing sexual differentiation did not necessarily deprive the plant of the primitive mode&nbsp;of propagation: the sexual organism still retained the faculty&nbsp;of reproduction by gonidia. The loss-of this faculty only came&nbsp;with higher development: it is entirely wanting in some of the&nbsp;higher ThaUophyta </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Fucaceae, Characeae), and in aU plants&nbsp;above them in the evolutionary series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With the introduction of the sexual act, a new kind of reproductive ceU made its appearance, the zygote. This ceU, as already explained, differs from other kinds of spores and from&nbsp;the sexual ceUs, in that its necleus is diploid; and with it the&nbsp;sporophyte (diplophyte) was introduced into the Ufe-history. It&nbsp;has been mentioned that in some plants </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Green Algae) the&nbsp;zygote is all that there is to represent the sporophyte, giving rise,&nbsp;or germination and after meiosis, to one or more spores. Passing&nbsp;to the Bryophyta, in the simpler forms </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g. Riccia),</span><span class="font1"> the zygote&nbsp;develops into a multiceUular capsule (sporogonium); and in the&nbsp;higher forms into a more elaborate sporogonium, producing many&nbsp;spores. In the Pteridophyta and the Phanerogams, the zygote&nbsp;gives rise to the highly developed sporophytic plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus the evolution of the sporophyte can be traced from the uniceUular zygote, graduaUy increasing in bulk and in independence untU it becomes the equal of the gametophyte </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dictyota</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polysiphonia),</span><span class="font1"> and eventuaUy far surpasses it&nbsp;(Pteridophyta, Phanerogams). Moreover, the increase in size was&nbsp;attended by the gradual Umitation of spore-production to certain&nbsp;parts only, the rest of the tissues being vegetative, assuming the&nbsp;form of stems, leaves, &amp;c. These facts have been formulated&nbsp;in the theory of “ progressive sterilization ” (Bower), which states&nbsp;that the sporophytic form of the higher plants has been evoIved&nbsp;from the simple, entirely fertile, sporophyte of thc lower, by the&nbsp;gradually increasing development of the sterile vegetative tissue&nbsp;at the expense of the sporogenous, accompanied by increase in&nbsp;total bulk and in morphologicaI and histological differentiation.</span></p>
