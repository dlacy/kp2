            <p>mind of Europe, namely, by their loving appreciation of natural beauty, their
                exquisite delineation of womanly love and devotion, and their tender sentiment of
                mercy and forgiveness.</p>
            <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Purdnas and Tantras.—</hi>The <hi rend="italic">Purânas</hi> are
                partly legendary partly speculative histories of the universe, compiled for the
                purpose of promoting some special, locally prevalent form of Brahmanical belief.
                They are sometimes styled a fifth Veda, and may indeed in a certain sense be looked
                upon as the scriptures of Brahmanical India. The term <hi rend="italic">purâna,</hi>
                signifying “old,” applied originally to prehistoric, especially cosmogonic, legends,
                and then to collections of ancient traditions generally. The existing works of this
                class, though recognizing the Brahmanical doctrine of the Trimûrti, or triple
                manifestation of the deity (in its creative, preservative, and destructive
                activity), are all of a sectarian tendency, being intended to establish, on
                quasi-historic grounds, the claims of some special god, or holy place, on the
                devotion of the people. For this purpose the compilers have pressed into their
                service a mass of extraneous didactic matter on all manner of subjects, whereby
                these works have become a kind of popular encyclopaedias of useful knowledge. It is
                evident, however, from a comparatively early definition given of the typical Purâna,
                as well as from numerous coincidences of the existing works, that they are based on,
                or enlarged from, older works of this kind, more limited in their scope, and
                probably of a more decidedly tritheistic tendency of belief. Thus none of the
                Purânas, as now extant, is probably much above a thousand years old, though a
                considerable proportion of their materials is doubtless much older, and may perhaps
                in part go back to several centuries before our era.</p>
            <p>In legendary matter the Purânas have a good deal in common with the epics, especially
                the <hi rend="italic">Mahâbhârata,—</hi>the compilers or revisers of both classes of
                works having evidently drawn their materials from the same fluctuating mass of
                popular traditions. They are almost entirely composed in epic couplets, and indeed
                in much the same easy flowing style as the epic poems, to which they are, however,
                geatly inferior in poetic value.</p>
            <p>According to the traditional classification of these works, there are said to be
                eighteen <hi rend="italic">(mahâ-,</hi> or great) <hi rend="italic">Purânas,</hi>
                and as many <hi rend="italic">Upa-purânas,</hi> or subordinate Purânas. The former
                are by some authorities divided into three groups of six, according as one or other
                of the three primary qualities of external existence—goodness, darkness (ignorance),
                and passion—is supposed to prevail in them, viz., the <hi rend="italic">Vishnu,
                    Ndradiya, Bhdgavata, Garuda, Padma, Varâha, — Matsya, Kûrma, Linga, Siva,
                    Skanda, Agni,—Brahmânda, Brahma- vaivarta, Mârkandeya, Bhavishya, Vâmana,</hi>
                and <hi rend="italic">Brahma-Purânas. </hi>In accordance with the nature of the
                several forms of the Trimurti, the first two groups chiefly devote themselves to the
                commenda- tion of Vishnu and Siva respectively, whilst the third group, which would
                properly belong to Brahman, has been largely appro- priated for the promotion of the
                claims of other deities, viz., Vishnu in his sensuous form of Krishna, Devi, Ganesa,
                and Surya. As Prof. Banerjea has shown in his preface to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >M&amp;r- kandeya,</hi> this seems to have been chiefly effected by later
                additions and interpolations. The insufficiency of the above classification,
                however, appears from the fact that it omits the <hi rend="italic">Vdyu-pur&amp;na,
                </hi>probably one of the oldest of all, though some MSS. substitute it for one or
                other name of the second group. The eighteen principal Puranas are said to consist
                of together 400,000 couplets. In Northern India the Vaishnava Purânas, especially
                the <hi rend="italic">Bhâgavata </hi>and <hi rend="italic">Vishnu,@@</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript">1</hi> are by far the most popular. The Bhagavata was
                formerly supposed to have been composed by Vopadeva, the grammarian, who lived in
                the 13th century. It has, however, been shown @@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> that
                what he wrote was a synopsis of the Purâna,</p>
            <p>and that the latter is already quoted in a work by Ballala Sena of Bengal, in the
                llth century.</p>
            <p>From the little we know regarding the Upa-purdnas, their character does not seem to
                differ very much from that of the principal Puranas. One of them, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Brahmânda-purâna,</hi> contains, as an episode, the well-known <hi
                    rend="italic">Adhyâtma-Râmâyana,</hi> a kind of spiritualized version of
                Valmiki’s poem. Besides these two classes of works there is a large number of
                so-called <hi rend="italic">Sthala-purânas,</hi> or chronicles recounting the
                history and merits of some holy “place” or shrine, where their recitation usually
                forms an important part of the daily service. Of much the same nature are the
                numerous <hi rend="italic">Mâhâtmyas</hi> (literally “relating to the great
                spirit”), which usually profess to be sections of one or other Purana. Thus the <hi
                    rend="italic">Devî- mâhâtmya,</hi> which celebrates the victories of the great
                goddess Durgâ over the Asuras, and is daily read at the temples of that deity, forms
                a section, though doubtless an interpolated one, of the Markandeya-purâna.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">Tantras,</hi> which have to be considered as a later
                development of the sectarian Puranas, are the sacred writings of the numerous <hi
                    rend="italic">Sdktas,</hi> or worshippers of the female energy <hi rend="italic"
                    >(sakti)</hi> of some god, especially the wife of Siva, in one of her many forms
                (Parvati, Devi, Kali, Bhavânî, Durgâ, &amp;c.). This worship of a female
                representation of the divine power appears already in some of the Purânas; but in
                the Tantras it assumes quite a peculiar character, being largely intermixed with
                magic performances and mystic rites, partly, it would seem, of a grossly immoral
                nature. This class of writings does not appear to have been in existence at the time
                of Amarasimha (6th century); but they are mentioned in some of the Purfinas. They
                are usually in the form of a dialogue between Siva and his wife. Their number is
                very large; but they still await a critical examination at the hands of western
                scholars. Among the best known may be mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Rudra yamala,
                    Kulârnava, Syâmâ-rahasya,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Kâlikâ-tantra.</hi></p>
            <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Modern Epics.—</hi>A new class of epic poems begin to make their
                appearance about the 5th or 6th century of our era, during a period of renewed
                literary activity which has been fitly called @@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> the
                Renaissance of Indian literature. These works differ widely in character from those
                that had preceded them. The great national epics, composed though they were in a
                language different from the ordinary vernaculars, had at least been drawn from the
                living stream of popular traditions, and were doubtless readily understood and
                enjoyed by the majority of the people. The later productions, on the other hand, are
                of a decidedly artificial character, and must necessarily have been beyond the reach
                of any but the highly cultivated. They are, on the whole, singularly deficient in
                incident and invention, their subject matter being almost entirely derived from the
                old epics. Nevertheless, these works are by no means devoid of merit and interest;
                and a number of them display considerable descriptive power and a wealth of genuine
                poetic sentiment, though unfortunately often clothed in language that deprives it of
                half its value. The simple heroic couplet has mostly been discarded for various more
                or less elaborate metres; and in accordance with this change of form the diction
                becomes gradually more complicated,—a growing taste for unwieldy compounds, a
                jingling kind of alliteration, or rather agnomination, and an abuse of similes
                marking the increasing artificiality of these productions.</p>
            <p>The generic appellation of such works is <hi rend="italic">kâvya,</hi> which, meaning
                “poem,” or the work of an individual poet <hi rend="italic">(kavi),</hi> is already
                applied to the <hi rend="italic">Râmâyana.</hi> Six poems of this kind are singled
                out by native rhetoricians as standard works, under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahâ- kâvya,</hi> or great poems. Two of these are ascribed to the famous
                dramatist Kalidasa, the most prominent figure of the Indian Renaissance, and truly a
                master of the poetic art. He is said to have been one of the nine literary “ gems ”
                at the court of Vikrama- ditya, now generally identified with King Vikramaditya
                Harslia of Ujjayinî (Ujjain or Oujein), who reigned about the middle of the 6th
                century, and seems to have originated the Vikramaditya era, reckoned from 56 B.C. Of
                the poets whose works have come down</p>
            <p><hi rend="superscript">@@@1</hi> There are several Indian editions of these two works.
                The Bhagavata has been partly printed, in an <hi rend="italic">édition de luxe,</hi>
                at Paris, in 3 vols., by E. Burnouf, and a fourth by M. Hauvette-Besnault. Of the
                Vishnup. there is a translation by H. H. Wilson, 2d ed. enriched with valuable notes
                by F. Hall. Several other Puranas have been printed in India; the Markandeya and
                Agni Puranas, in the <hi rend="italic">Bibl. Ind.,</hi> by Prof. Banerjea and
                Râjendralâla Mitra respectively.</p>
