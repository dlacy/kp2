According to Mr Gibbon, however, Commodus was not, as has been repreſented, a tiger born with an inſatiate thirſt of hu</p><lb/><p>man blood, and capable from his infancy of the moſt inhuman actions. Nature had formed him of a weak, rather than a wicked diſpofition. His ſimplicity and</p><lb/><p>and was capable of encountering every nation with the advantages of its reſpective arms and diſcipline. Nor was the legion deſtitute of what, in modern language, would be ſtyled a train of artillery. This conſiſted of 10 military engines of the largeſt ſize, and 56 ſmaller ones; but all of them, either in an oblique or horizontal manner, diſcharged ſtones and darts with irreſiſtible violence.</p><p>The camp of a Roman legion preſented the appearance of a fortified city. As ſoon as the ſpace was marked out, the pioneers carefully levelled the ground, and removed every impediment that might interrupt its perfect regularity, its form was an exact quadrangle; and it may be computed that a ſquare of 700 yards was ſufficient for the encampment of 20, 000 Romans, though a ſimilar number of modern troops would expoſe to the enemy a front of more than treble that extent. In the midſt of the camp, the prætorium, or general’s tent, aroſe above the others; and the cavalry, infantry, and auxiliaries, had each their reſpective ſtations appointed them. The ſtreets were broad, and perfectly ſtraight; and a vacant ſpace of 200 ſeet was left on all ſides between the tents and rampart. The rampart itſelf was 12 feet high, armed with a line of ſtrong and intricate paliſades, and defended by a ditch 12 feet deep and as much broad. This labour was performed by the legions themſelves, to whom the uſe of the ſpade and the pick-ax was no leſs familiar than that of the ſword or piluin. Whenever the trumpet gave the ſignal of departure, the camp was almoſt inſtantly broke up, and the troops fell into their ranks without delay or confuſion. Beſides their arms, which the ſoldiers ſcarcely conſidered as an incumbrance, they were laden with their kitchen-furniture, the inſtruments of fortification, and proviſions for many days. Under this weight, which would oppreſs a modern ſoldier, they were taught to advance by a regular ſtep, near 20 miles in ſix hours. On the appearance of an enemy, they threw aſide their baggage, and, by eaſy and rapid evolutions, converted the column of march into an order of battle. The ſlingers and archers ſkirmiſhed in the front; the auxiliaries formed the firſt line, and were ſeconded or ſuſtained by the legions. The cavalry covered the</p><p>flanks, and the military engines were placed in the rear.</p><p>The numbers of the Roman armies are not eaſily calculated with any tolerable accuracy. We may compute, however, that the legion, which conſiſted of 6831 Romans, might, with its attendant auxiliaries, amount to 12, 500 men. The peace eſtabliſhment of Adrian and his ſucceſſors was compoſed of no fewer than 30 of theſe formidable brigades; and moſt probably formed an army of 370, 000 men. Inſtead of being confined within the walls of fortified cities, which the Romans conſidered as the refuge of weakneſs or puſillanimity, the legions were encamped on the banks of the great rivers, and along the frontiers of the barbarians. Three legions were ſuffi-cient for Britain. The principal ſtrength lay upon the Rhine and Danube, and conſiſted of 16 legions, diſpoſed in the following proportions: two in the Lower, and three in the Upper Germany; one in Rhætia; one in Noricum; four in Pannonia; three in Mæſia; and two in Dacia. The defence of the Euphrates was intruſted to eight legions, ſix of whom were placed in Syria, and the other two in Cappadocia. With regard to Egypt, Africa, and Spain, as they were far removed from any important ſcene of war, a ſingle legion maintained the domeſtic tranquillity of each of thoſe great provinces. Italy was defended by the city cohorts and prætorian guards formerly mentioned. Theſe differed nothing from the legions in their arms and inſtitutions, except in a more ſplendid appearance, and a leſs rigid diſcipline.</p><p>The Roman navy, though ſufficient for every uſeful purpoſe of government, never ſeemed adequate to the greatneſs of the empire. The policy of the emperors was directed only to preſerve the peaceful dominion of the Mediterranean ſea, which was included within their dominions, and to protect the commerce of their ſubjects. Two permanent fleets were ſtationed by Auguſtus, one at Ravenna on the Adriatic, and the other at Miſenum in the bay of Naples. A very conſiderable force was alſo ſtationed at Frejus in Provence; and the Euxine was guarded by 40 ſhips and 3000 ſoldiers. To all theſe we may add the fleet which preſerved the communication between Gaul and Britain, and a great number of veſſels conſtantly maintained on the Rhine and Danube to ha-raſs the enemy, or intercept the paſſage of the barbarians. The whole military eſtabliſhment by ſea and land amounted to about 450, 000 men.</p><p>It was not, however, to this formidable power alone that the empire owed its greatneſs. The policy of the laws contributed as much to its ſupport as the martial eſtabliſhment itſelf. According to Mr Gibbon, though the provinces might occaſionally ſuffer from the partial abuſe of delegated authority, the general principle of government was wiſe, ſimple, and beneficent. Among theſe beneficent principles he reckons that of univerſal toleration; but to this there were ſeveral exceptions: for the Britiſh Druids were perſecuted and deſtroyed by the Romans on account of their religion; the Egyptians and Jews were ſometimes perſecuted; and the Chriſtians were frequently ſo, and that even under the very beſt emperors, Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. However, as a very general toleration of religious ſentiments did take place under the heathen emperors of Rome, we muſt certainly look upon this as one of the cauſes of the proſperity of the empire.</p><p>Another thing which greatly contributed to the ſtrength and proſperity of the empire, was the extending of the freedom of Rome to ſo many people, " The narrow policy (ſays Mr Gibbon) of preſerving, without any foreign mixture, the pure blood of the ancient citizens, had checked the fortune and haſtened the ruin of Athens and Sparta. During the moſt flouriſhing era of the Athenian commonwealth, the number of citizens decreaſed gradually from about 30, 000 to 21, 000.
