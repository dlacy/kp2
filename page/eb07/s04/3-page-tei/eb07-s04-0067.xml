The cornfields are wretchedly cultivated, and desert heaths of cistus everywhere meet the eye. Plantations of olive-trees are rare ; here, in short, every kind of vegetation dwindles for want of water. In most cases the rivers carry but little water in comparison with the extent of the land and the number of considerable mountain chains. The causes of this great deficiency are principally the extreme dryness of the atmosphere ; the inconsiderable cover of snow on the mountains, and its short continuance ; the absence of forests and great moors on the heights ; and the comparatively inconsiderable breadth of the mountain ranges. The southern and southwestern part of Spain, which comprehends Andalusia, Granada, and Murcia, is very different from that just described. On the opposite side of the Sierra Morena the whole land has a more southern as pect, which announces itself not only by the vegetable, but likewise by the animal kingdom. The great difference of climate is produced by the southern situation, the exposure of the acclivity on the south and southwest to the African winds, and the strong reflection of the solar rays from the lofty naked mountain-walls. The mountain ranges are more closely aggregated, the valleys more deeply cut ; and there is also a greater difference in the rocks and in their position, so that extensive tablelands cannot be formed. The south of Spain thus possesses not only a much higher temperature, one fit for the orange and the palm, but also a more varied and more favourable soil for cultivation. In East Valencia and Murcia, in the south of Andalusia and the Algarves, in Western Alemtejo and South Estremadura, the rich and varied vegetation rivals that of the fertile plains of Syria. In Andalusia frosts are unknown, and the snow, if it ever falls, melts the moment it touches the soil ; so that it is not surprising that, in the cultivated districts, the Spa niards, so famous for their maritime expeditions of yore, should have introduced many vegetables from remote parts of the world, thus giving a perfectly tropical appearance to the country. There is, however, a deficiency of moisture, but it seems only to affect the growth of some of the lower species of plants.</p><p>Passing over such productions of the soil as are only interesting to the botanist, we shall enumerate those which come under the cognizance of the husbandman. Spain may be reckoned one of the most fruitful countries of Europe, and it presents a great variety of products. Wheat, secale, barley, maize, and flax, are cultivated in almost all the provinces, but still not in crops sufficient for home consumption. Oats are neglected, barley being given to the cattle instead of that grain. Oil and soda are the principal products of the southern shores of the Mediterranean ; the others are sumach, and different esculent plants of an admirable quality. In the same part of the country are fields of saffron, plantations of rice, which stretch out like so many plains, and the cotton shrub thrives as on its native soil. The mulberry trees are very luxuriant, and their leaves afford rich nourishment to the bombyx, which easily accounts for the superior quality of the silk. In the south of Spain there is an immense variety of the most delicious fruits, not only such as are common in temperate climates, but many which naturally belong to the tropical regions. The sugar cane grows near the cotton plant, and numerous olives fur nish the oil which forms so important a branch of commerce. Kali, from which barilla is extracted, is produced in great abundance in Valencia ; anise, maize, and different dye stuffs in Murcia ; and the honey of Cuenza is still as celebrated as it was in the time of the Romans. Among the vegetable products we may briefly mention chestnuts and a variety of other nuts, the corktree, palm, lemon, banana, date, pomegranate, fig, citron, cheremoya, laurel, bay, cypress, almond, and strawberry tree ; potatoe and other culinary vegetables ; forests of oak, pine, and other trees, chiefly in Catalonia, the Asturias, Galicia, and the Sierra Morena.</p><p>Extensive valleys covered with rich pastures are found in Navarre, and numerous herds are fattened on them. In the Asturias considerable forests still exist, chiefly of <hi rend="italic">evergreen</hi> oaks, from which naval timber is obtained. But of all the vegetable productions of Spain, the vine is the most important, the lands being almost everywhere favourable to its culture. The excess of the vintage above the quantity consumed in the country forms a considerable branch of the export trade, and it is capable of being greatly ex tended. The best wines are those of Peralta in Navarre ; Ribadavia and Betanzos in Galicia ; Mansanares and Val de Penas in La Mancha ; Xeres or Sherry, San Lucar, and Rota, in Seville; Cabra, Lucena, and Campine, in Cordova; Malaga in Granada; and lastly, Alicant in Valencia. Sherry wine is produced in great quantities in the plain of Xeres, and a considerable portion is exported to this country. Mr Jacob estimates the quantity of this wine annually produced at 40,000 pipes, of which 15,000 are exported, mostly to England. The finest wine is produced in Malaga, but not in large quantities.</p><p>Mr Swainson thus describes the zoology. “ The native zoology has been so little investigated, that nothing beyond a meagre list could be furnished of indigenous animals. In the mountains of Asturias the ibex is not uncommon, and the Alpine squirrel <hi rend="italic">(Sciurus Alpinus)</hi> is only found in the Pyrenees. In the southern parts, bordering on the African shore, a few species of warblers have recently been found, which are as yet unknown to the rest of Europe. The European bee-eater frequents the vicinity of Gibraltar in large flocks during the season of migration. Among the domesticated animals, the horse and sheep deserve particular notice, as having been long celebrated throughout Eu rope. The best horses are generally about four feet six or eight inches in height ; they have all the fire, docility, grace, and action of the beautiful Arabians of Barbary, and there can be no doubt of these noble animals having been introduced by the Moors and crossed with the native breed. Those of Andalusia, Granada, and Estremadura, are the most distinguished. At Zeres are found two perfectly distinct races ; the one, which possesses the fine qualities above mentioned, is still preserved in all its purity at Chartreux. The other race is larger, stronger, less elegant, and used for common purposes. But little care has latterly been bestowed in keeping up the more noble breed, so that fine horses are not so common in Spain as formerly. The mule in so mountainous a country is particularly useful, and, with the ass, is principally used for conveying goods into the in terior. The breeds of the latter are very fine, anti are hardly excelled by those of Egypt. Spain is still celebrated for its Merino race of sheep. The flocks are kept constantly travelling during the greater part of the summer, but are carefully pent up in winter. This race, subdivided into breeds, is extended over the greater part of Spain, but those of Cavage and Negrate are the best. A third breed, the Sowan, appears more hardy, and passes the winter in Estremadura, Andalusia, and New Castille. These three constitute what is called the Transhumante, or travelling race, to distinguish them from the Estautes, or those of a some what interior breed, which do not migrate. The best fleeces are those which appear almost black on their sur face, caused by the dust adhering to the peculiar greasy pile ; for it is invariably found that such fleeces are of the purest white beneath.” There is a very large breed of oxen in the country round Salamanca ; but the cattle of Spain have been much neglected, the mountaineers deriving all their milk and butter from goats. Fine cattle, how ever, are reared in the Asturias ; and pigs are very common on the mountains of the same province. The wild boar, the wolf, the bear, and different kinds of deer, are still found in Spain, but these are gradually becoming extinct. The chamois and the lynx still find shelter in the Pyrenees and</p></body></text></TEI>
