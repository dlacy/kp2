<hi rend="smallcaps">Alessandro,</hi> composer, singer, and performer on various instruments, was one of the most accomplished Italian musicians of the 17th century. The generally accepted statement that he was born at Naples about 1645 rests upon no trustworthy foundation ; and the few biographical notices that we possess savour so strongly of romance that we can only be said to know him truly through his works, which show extraordinary genius, and have exercised a highly beneficial influence upon Italian art. The story of his life was first circumstantially narrated in Bonnet-Bourdelot’s <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la Musique et de ses Effets</hi> (Paris, 1715). According to this account, Stradella not only produced some successful operas at Venice, but also attained so great a reputation by the beauty of his voice that a Venetian nobleman engaged him to instruct his mistress, Orten sia, in singing. Stradella, the narrative goes on to say, shamefully betrayed his trust, and eloped with Ortensia to Rome, whither the outraged Venetian sent two paid <hi rend="italic">bravi</hi> to put him to death. On their arrival in Rome the assassins learned that Stradella had just completed a new oratorio, over the performance of which he was to preside on the following day at S. Giovanni in Laterano. Taking advantage of this circumstance, they determined to kill him as he left the church ; but the beauty of the music affected them so deeply that their hearts failed them at the critical moment, and, confessing their treachery, they entreated the composer to ensure his safety by quitting Rome immediately. Thereupon Stradella fled with Ortensia to Turin, where, notwithstanding the favour shown to him by the regent of Savoy, he was attacked one night by another band of assassins, who, headed by Ortensia’s father, left him on the ramparts for dead. Through the connivance of the French ambassador the ruffians succeeded in making their escape ; and in the meantime Stradella, recovering from his wounds, married Ortensia, by consent of the regent, and removed with her to Genoa. Here he believed himself safe ; but a year later he and Ortensia were murdered in their house by a third party of assassins in the pay of the implacable Venetian.</p><p>Bonnet-Bourdelot gives 1670 as the date at which the assassination actually took place ; but the oratorio <hi rend="italic">San Giovanni Battista,</hi> assumed to be that which saved its author’s life, is dated Roma,</p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s06-0584" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0608.jp2"/><p><label><?xml version="I.O" encoding="utf-8"?> unknown title unknown author <editionStmt> <edition> <date> unknown date <,date> <,edition> <,editionStmt>  unknown <,p>  Converted from a Word document with eb-docx2tei. <,p> <encodingDesc> <appInfo> <application ident="TEI_fromDOCX" version="2.I5.O" xml:id="docxtotei">  Knowledge Project: DOCX to TEI  <,application> <,appInfo> <,encodingDesc> <revisionDesc> <listChange> <change> <date> 2OI9-OI-2OT22:43:I3Z <,date> <name> unknown author <,name> <,change> <,listChange> <,revisionDesc>  I676”; and a cantata, called <hi rend="italic">Il Barcheggio, <,hi> is known to have been composed by Stradella for the marriage of Carlo Spinola and Paola Brignolo in I68I. These discrepancies are not, however, of sufficient moment to justify the rejection of Bonnet-Bourdelot’s account, which has been accepted as genuine by Burney, Hawkins, Fétis, and many other careful writers, including the remarkably accurate and conscientious Wanley.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> See No. I272 in <hi rend="italic">Cat. Marl. MSS., Brit. Mus. <,hi> Wanley, however, believed Stradella alone to have been murdered and the lady to have escaped. <,note> And it must be remembered, in its defence, that Pierre Bourdelot, by whom the materials for the <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la Musique et de ses Effets <,hi> were originally compiled, was an actual contemporary of Stradella, and died as early as I685, when a host of the composer’s friends must still have been living, and able to give evidence on the subject of his fate. It seems therefore only reasonable to assume that the main facts of the narrative are correctly given, though the dates may need confirmation; while for the embroidered versions of later writers the authors of the <hi rend="italic">Histoire <,hi> are certainly not responsible. <,p>  The finest collection of Stradella’s works extant is that at the Biblioteca Palatina at Modena, which contains I48 MSS., including eleven operas and six oratorios. A collection of <hi rend="italic">canti a voce sola <,hi> was bequeathed by the Contarini family to the library of St Mark at Venice ; and some MSS. are also preserved at Naples and in Paris. Eight madrigals, three duets, and a sonata for two violins and bass will be found among the Additional MSS. at the British Museum, five pieces among the Harleian MSS., and eight cantatas and a motet among those in the library at Christ Church, Oxford. Very few of these compositions have been published ; but an extremely beautiful <hi rend="italic">aria di chiesa, <,hi> entitled <hi rend="italic">Pietá Signore, <,hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> Called in some editions <hi rend="italic">Se i miei sospiri. <,hi> <,note> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2 <,hi> has been frequently printed, under the name of Stradella, and popularly accepted as the air which produced so marvellous an effect upon the assassins. The piece, however, is not to be found in <hi rend="italic">San Giovanni Battista; <,hi> and its style so little resembles that of Stradella’s other works that no less decisive evidence than the discovery of an undoubted autograph could justify its ascription to him. On the other hand, no more extravagant mistake could be made than that of describing it, as some have done, as a forgery, perpetrated either by Fétis, Rossini, or Niedermeyer. Not one of these great musicians could have written it; and it is certainly no forgery, but a genuino work of the I7th century or the opening decade of the I8th. In the absence of trustworthy documentary evidence, all attempts to ascertain the real authorship of the piece must necessarily end in mere conjecture ; but the extraordinary similarity of its style to that cultivated by Francesco de’ Rossi, who is known to have been flourishing at Bari at the time of Stradella’s death, is very significant. <,p>  Much controversy has also been excited by another work, lately attributed to Stradella, viz., a <hi rend="italic">serenata <,hi> for voices and instruments, of which two copies only are known to exist,—one at the Conservatoire at Paris, and the other, a late transcript, now at the Royal College of Music in London. The date of this <hi rend="italic">serenata <,hi> is absolutely unknown. Of evidence proving it to be a genuine work by Stradella there is none in existence. Yet the question of its authenticity is a most important one, for upon the strength of it Handel may perhaps be some day gravely accused of having stolen from the Italian composer some of the finest passages in <hi rend="italic">Israel in Egypt. <,hi> <,p>  The compositions of Stradella are remarkable for their graceful form and the tenderness of their expression. Detached movements will be found in Burney’s <hi rend="italic">History of Music <,hi> and the modern collection called <hi rend="italic">Gemme d'Antichità. <,hi> <,p>
