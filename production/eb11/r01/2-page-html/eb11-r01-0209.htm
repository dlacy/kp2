He was killed by a fall in&nbsp;Switzerland. Sir Charles Reed's third son, Talbot Baines&nbsp;Reed (1852-1893), educated at the City of London School,&nbsp;became managing director of his father’s firm, and was one of&nbsp;the founders and secretary of the Bibliographical Society.

<p><span class="font2">REED, ISAAC (1742-1807), English Shakespearian editor, son of </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">baker, was born on New Year’s Day, 1742, in London.&nbsp;He was articled to a solicitor, and eventually set up as a conveyancer at Staple Inn, where he had a considerable practice.&nbsp;His first important work was the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Biographia dramatica</span><span class="font2"> (2 vols.,&nbsp;1782), consisting of biographies of the dramatists and a&nbsp;descriptive dictionary of their plays. This book, which was an&nbsp;enlargement of David Erskine Baker’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Companion to the Playhouse</span><span class="font2"> (2 vols., 1764), was re-edited (3 vols.) by Stephen Jones&nbsp;in 1811, and is a valuable authority. The original work by&nbsp;Baker had been based on Gerard Langbaine’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Account of the&nbsp;English Dramatick Poets</span><span class="font2"> (1691), Giles Jacob’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Poetical Register&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1719), Thomas Whincop’s “List of all the Dramatic Authors ’’&nbsp;(printed with his tragedy of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scanderbeg,</span><span class="font2"> 1747) and the MSS. of&nbsp;Thomas Coxeter (1689-1747), an industrious antiquary who&nbsp;had collected much useful material. Reed’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia dramatica&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(Addit. MSS. 25390-2, British Museum), supplementary to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Biographia,</span><span class="font2"> was never published. He revised Dodsley’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Collection of Old Plays</span><span class="font2"> (12 vols., 1780). He also re-edited Johnson&nbsp;and Steevens’s edition (1773) of Shakespeare. Reed’s edition&nbsp;was published in 10 vols. (1785), and he gave great assistance&nbsp;to St cevens in his edition (1793). He was Steevens’s literary&nbsp;executor, and in 1803 published another edition (21 vols.)&nbsp;based on Steevens’s later collections. This, which is known&nbsp;as the first </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">variorum,</span><span class="font2"> was re-issued ten years later. He died&nbsp;on the 5th of January 1807. His valuable library of theatrical&nbsp;literature was catalogued for sale as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliotheca Reediana</span><span class="font2"> (1807).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REED, JOSEPH (1741-1785), American politician, was born in Trenton, New Jersey, on the 27th of August 1741. He&nbsp;graduated at Princeton in 1757, studied law under Richard&nbsp;Stockton and, in 1763-65, at the Middle Temple, London,&nbsp;and practised in Trenton from 1765 until his removal to Philadelphia in 1770. He was president of the second Provincial&nbsp;Congress of Pennsylvania in 1775, was aide-de-camp and&nbsp;military secretary to General Washington in 1775-76, and&nbsp;was adjutant-general with the rank of colonel in 1776-77.&nbsp;He resigned his commission in the autumn of 1777, and in&nbsp;1777-78 was a delegate to the Continental Congress. From&nbsp;December 1778 to October 1781 he was president of the state&nbsp;Executive Council. During his administration the proprietary&nbsp;rights of the Penn family were abrogated (1779), and provision&nbsp;was made for the gradual abolition of slavery (1780). During&nbsp;this time Reed led the attack on Benedict Arnold </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> for&nbsp;the latter’s administration of Philadelphia. Reed was elected&nbsp;to Congress in 1784, but died in PhÛadelphĩa on the 5th of&nbsp;March 1785.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Life and Correspondence of Joseph Reed</span><span class="font1"> (2 vols., Philadelphia, 1874), by his grandson, William B. Reed, is based upon the family&nbsp;papers. It pictures Reed as an heroic patriot and statesman;&nbsp;George Bancroft, on the other hand, in the ninth volume (p. 229)&nbsp;of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History</span><span class="font1"> (1866) and in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Joseph Reed: an Historical Essay</span><span class="font1"> (1867),&nbsp;pictures him as a trimmer of the most pronounced type. Bancroft's&nbsp;principal charge against Reed was based on a passage in Count&nbsp;Donop's diary referring to a Col. Reed protected by the British&nbsp;in 1776. In 1876, however, Mr W. S. Stryker discovered that&nbsp;the reference in the diary was really to Col. Charles Read (1715-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 1780). Bancroft withdrew this definite charge in the 1876&nbsp;edition of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History,</span><span class="font1"> in which, however, his tone towards Joseph&nbsp;Reed was unchanged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Joseph Reed’s son, Joseph Reed (1772-1846), published the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Laws of Pennsylvania</span><span class="font2"> (5 vols., 1822-24), continuing the&nbsp;work of Charles Smith, published in 1810-12, which began&nbsp;with the laws of 1700. His grandson, William Bradford&nbsp;Reed (1806-1876), graduated at the university of Pennsylvania&nbsp;in 1822, was a representative in the Pennsylvania legislature&nbsp;in 1834-35, attorney-general of the state in 1838, and </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">state senator in 1841. He was professor of American history&nbsp;in the university of Pennsylvania in 1850-56, United States&nbsp;minister to China in 1857-58, and in 1858 negotiated a&nbsp;treaty with China, proclaimed in i860. Besides the biography&nbsp;of his grandfather mentioned above, he published one of Joseph&nbsp;Reed’s wife, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Esther De Berdt, afterwards Esther Reed&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1853).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">W. B. Reed’s brother, Henry [Hope] Reed (1808-1854), graduated at the university of Pennsylvania in 1825, practised&nbsp;law in Philadelphia, and was assistant-professor of moral&nbsp;philosophy in the university of Pennsylvania in 1831-34&nbsp;and professor of English literature and rhetoric there in&nbsp;1835-54. He assisted Wordsworth in the preparation of an&nbsp;American edition of his poems in 1837, edited in America&nbsp;Christopher Wordsworth’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of William Wordsworth&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1851) and published </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on English Literature from&nbsp;Chaucer to Tennyson</span><span class="font2"> (1855).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REED, THOMAS BRACKETT (1839-1902), American statesman, was born in Portland, Maine, on the 18th of October 1839. He graduated at Bowdoin College in i860; was acting&nbsp;assistant-paymaster in the U.S. navy from April 1864 to&nbsp;November 1865; and in 1865 was admitted to the bar. He&nbsp;was a member of the Maine House of Representatives in&nbsp;1868-69 and of the state Senate in 1870, was attorney-general&nbsp;of the state in 1870-72, and was city solicitor of Portland in&nbsp;1874-77. He was a Republican member of the National&nbsp;House of Representatives from 1877 until 1809; was a member&nbsp;of the Potter Committee to investigate the disputed presidential election of 1876, and conducted the examination of&nbsp;Samuel J. Tilden; and he was Speaker of the House in&nbsp;1889-91, and in 1895-99. He was a “strong ” speaker in his&nbsp;control of the proceedings, and he developed an organized&nbsp;committee system, making the majority of the Committee&nbsp;on Rules consist of the speaker and chairman of the committees&nbsp;on ways and means and on appropriations. The “ Reed&nbsp;Rules,” drawn up by him, William McKinley and J. G. Cannon,&nbsp;were adopted on the 14th of February 1890; they provided&nbsp;that every member must vote, unless pecuniarily interested in&nbsp;a measure, that members present and not voting may be counted for a quorum, and that no dilatory motion be enter-tained by the speaker. His parliamentary methods were&nbsp;bitterly attacked by his political enemies, who called him&nbsp;“ Tsar Reed.’’ He greatly hastened the passage of the McKinley&nbsp;Bill in 1890, and of the Dingley Bill in 1897. His rules and&nbsp;methods of control of legislation were adopted by his successors&nbsp;in the speakership, and the power of the Rules Committee was&nbsp;greatly increased under Charles F. Crisp (1845-1896), Democratic&nbsp;speaker in 1891-1895. After the war with Spain Reed broke&nbsp;with the administration on the issue of imperialism. He&nbsp;resigned his seat in 1899 and practised law ih New York City.&nbsp;He died in Washington on the 7th of December 1902. Reed was a&nbsp;remarkable personality, of whom many good stories were told,&nbsp;and opinions varied as to his conduct in the chair; but he was&nbsp;essentially a man of rugged honesty and power, whose death&nbsp;was a loss to American public life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reed’s Rules</span><span class="font1"> were published as a parliamentary manual. He edited with others a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Library of Modern Eloquence</span><span class="font1"> (10 vols., 1901).&nbsp;See the chapter on Reed in H. B. Fuller’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Speakers of the House&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Boston, 1909).</span></p>
