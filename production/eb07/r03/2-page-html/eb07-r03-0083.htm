                    >Ecclesiastical Schools.</span><span class="font2"> There are numerous
                    establishments of this nature in Russia, which, as relates to their management,
                    are divided into two heads. The first&nbsp;comprehends the schools of the Greek
                    Church, under the&nbsp;control of the holy synod, and directed by a special
                    commission ; the second, the ecclesiastical schools belonging&nbsp;to other
                    forms of worship, which schools are under the superintendence of the minister of
                    the interior. All these&nbsp;schools are divided into three circuits or
                    departments, viz.&nbsp;those of St Petersburg, Moscow, and Kief. Each
                    district&nbsp;has a superior school, called the ecclesiastical academy
                    ;&nbsp;with a certain number of intermediary schools or seminaries, for the most
                    part established in the chief provincial&nbsp;towns, and of inferior schools,
                    divided into district and parochial ones. These establishments are exclusively
                    reserved&nbsp;for the children of the clergy, an arrangement exactly of
                    a&nbsp;piece with the system practised in the common schools. In&nbsp;1835 the

                    establishments which are comprehended under this head are classified according
                    to the different ministers, or members of the imperial family, who especially
                    superintend them. 1. Under the&nbsp;minister of finance. These consist of mining
                    schools, distributed into inferior, middle, and superior seminaries,
                    where&nbsp;the art of mining is taught. They are situated at St Petersburg, and
                    in the principal manufacturing and mining&nbsp;districts. They are organized on
                    the same vicious principle as the others, being confined to the children of
                    miners,&nbsp;as if talents for particular arts were hereditary in
                    families.&nbsp;The total number of pupils in the mining schools is
                    4613,&nbsp;who are allowed for their support by government 647,911&nbsp;roubles
                    annually. Private individuals support similar establishments, at which there may
                    be a thousand pupils more.&nbsp;There are ten other various kinds of schools
                    under the minister of finance. The Practical Institution of Technology&nbsp;was
                    founded in 1828, and intended to form master manufacturers. Two
                    mercantile-marine schools, for forming&nbsp;pilots, were both established in
                    1829 at St Petersburg and&nbsp;Kherson. There are, besides, the Forest
                    Institute, the&nbsp;Academy of Commerce at Moscow, the Agricultural
                    School&nbsp;at Gorygoretsk, schools of land-surveying and design
                    at&nbsp;Tchemigov, and two schools for forest sciences, all as yet&nbsp;in their
                    infancy. They are attended by 608 pupils, which,</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font2">added to those attending the mine-schools, makes the num- ber of
                    pupils in the schools of this class amount to 6221.<sup> </sup>The annual budget
                    is 1,032,191 roubles. 2. Schools under the minister of the interior. These are
                    schools of medicine, surgery, and pharmacy, all independent of the university
                    faculties ; rural schools for the cultivation of the&nbsp;vine, and for
                    agriculture in general ; schools for the sons&nbsp;of persons employed in
                    subaltern situations in public offices, who are supported by the state on
                    condition of serving it eight years ; and schools for orphans and poor children.
                    The establishments under the minister of the interior contain 13,340 pupils, of
                    whom 10,500 are in the hospitals. 3. Under the minister of the emperor’s
                    household&nbsp;are the Moscow Academy of the Fine Arts, Moscow School&nbsp;of
                    Architecture, the Theatrical School of St Petersburg,&nbsp;and the Court School
                    of Singers. @@<sup>1</sup> These contain in all&nbsp;only about 345 pupils. 4.
                    The minister of appanages has&nbsp;under him some schools of agriculture, and
                    primary schools&nbsp;for the peasants, but containing only 1070 pupils. 5. Under
                    the general direction of roads and communications is&nbsp;a school of civil
                    engineers and conductors, containing 665&nbsp;pupils. 6. Under the minister of
                    justice are a school of jurisprudence, and another of land-surveying, to train
                    youth&nbsp;for the exclusive service of government. These two establishments
                    contain 350 pupils. 7. Under the foreign office is an oriental institution for
                    qualifying individuals to act&nbsp;as diplomatic interpreters in the Asiatic
                    tongues. 8. Institutions under the reigning empress, comprehending the foundling
                    hospitals of Moscow and St Petersburg, the boarding-schools for young ladies at
                    St Petersburg, Moscow, and&nbsp;Odessa, which contain 52,912 pupils. The empress
                    has further under her control several patriotic establishments, mostly
                    appropriated to the education of children of indigent or&nbsp;invalid officers.
                    In all they contain 1122 pupils. There&nbsp;are also a number of benevolent
                    institutions, such as houses&nbsp;of industry, establishments for the deaf and
                    dumb, the blind,&nbsp;and others. 9. The Archduchess Helena superintends
                    a&nbsp;number of educational institutions, established in
                    different&nbsp;provincial towns, and managed by the local authorities.&nbsp;10.
                    There remain to be added to the above a number of&nbsp;schools which are
                    supported without any assistance from&nbsp;government. All the foregoing derive
                    considerable pecuniary aid from that source. There are four German
                    schools&nbsp;at St Petersburg, and 750 in the German colonies, having&nbsp;in
                    all 35,746. In the same provinces are 561 Tartar schools,&nbsp;with 14,000
                    pupils ; and there are two Jewish schools, with&nbsp;500 pupils. At Omsk,
                    Cossack and Asiatic schools have&nbsp;been instituted. The latter are intended
                    to supply interpreters to all the frontier line of Siberia.</span></p>

            <p><span class="font2">@@@<sup>1</sup> Travellers have remarked, that the Russians
                    possess a singular aptitude for music ; and Reicha, a very eminent musician,
                    particularly notices the admirable accuracy with which the vocal music is
                    performed in the churches, without the aid of any instrumental accompaniment.
                    But in Russia the music of the church, the theatre, the concert∙room, and the
                    chamber, has been chiefly indebted for its progress to Italian and German
                    musicians, though the native music and musical instruments of Russia are
                    sufficiently interesting to deserve much more consideration than has hitherto
                    been bestowed upon them. The occurrence of popular airs in Finland in the
                    unusual measure of is vouched by continental writers. In the interior of Russia,
                    there appear to be many native airs of an&nbsp;uncommon character in respect of
                    melody and tonality. The celebrated Russian horn-music, though very remarkable
                    in its kind, must be considered as of foreign introduction, and as the result of
                    great musical aptitude, and of most careful and laborious training. About the
                    middle of the eighteenth century, J. A. Maresch, a Bohemian, and a very skilful
                    horn-player, who was settled at St Petersburg, invented there the famous Russian
                    horn-music. For a brief account of it, see the Appendix to Graham’s Essay on
                    Musical Composition; and for minute details regarding the notation and the mode
