Its general configuration must be assumed to have been substantially the same as it is now for thousands of years ; hence we may safely conclude that the absolute composition of the ocean as a whole is constant in the sense of being only subject to very slow progressive millennial variation, and that, taking one part of the ocean with another, the percentage composition of the fixed part of the <hi rend="italic">solutum</hi> can oscillate only within narrow limits. The composition of this solutum is very complex. According to Forchhammer, ocean salt in addition to the chlorides and sulphates of sodium, magnesium, potassium, and calcium—which had long been known to be its principal components—includes silica, boric acid, bromine, iodine, fluorine as acid, and the oxides of nickel, cobalt, manganese, aluminium, zinc, silver, lead, copper, barium, and strontium as basic components. Arsenic, gold, lithium, rubidium, cæsium have been discovered since Forchhammer wrote. But all these subsidiary components, as that investigator found, amount to very little,—so little that in his numerous quantitative analyses of waters which he had procured from all quarters of the globe he confined himself to the determination of the chlorine, sulphuric acid, magnesia, lime, potash, and soda. The soda, however, he determined only by difference, assuming that the muriatic and sulphuric acids are united with the bases into perfectly neutral salts. As a general result he found that, in the open ocean, the ratio to one another of the several acids and bases named is subject to only slight variations. But his samples had all been collected at the surface ; the potash had been determined by an insufficiently exact method ; and the assumed neutrality of the total salt had not been proved. With the view primarily of supplementing Forchhammer’s work, Dittmar made complete analyses of 77 of the samples brought home by the “ Challenger,” so selected that 34 out of the 77 represented depths of 1000 fathoms or more. His analyses brought out a small surplus of base, proving the presence of carbonate in all the waters ; but the numerical values thus found for the “alkalinity,” being charged with the observational errors of the whole series of determinations, could not be relied on. Dittmar therefore subsequently availed himself of a very easy and yet exact method for the direct determination of this quantity, which meanwhile had been discovered by Tornöe, and applied it to over 130 “Challenger” samples. He besides made a special inquiry into the relation between the quantity of lime and the depth at which the water had been collected, and a similar inquiry in regard to the bromine. As a general summary he gives the following three tables. The total salts contained in ocean water amount on an average to about 3·5 per cent., thus leaving 96·5 per cent. for the water proper.</p><table><row><cell cols="5"><hi rend="smallcaps">Table</hi> I.—<hi rend="italic">Average Composition of Ocean-Water Salts.</hi></cell></row><row><cell/><cell/><cell>Per 100 parts of</cell><cell cols="2">Per 100 of Halogen calculated</cell></row><row><cell/><cell/><cell>Total Salts.</cell><cell cols="2">as Chlorine.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell/><cell>Dittmar.</cell><cell>Dittmar.</cell><cell>Forchhammer.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Chlorine	</cell><cell>55∙292</cell><cell>99·848</cell><cell/></row><row><cell/><cell>Bromine	</cell><cell>0188@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></cell><cell>0∙340</cell><cell/></row><row><cell/><cell>Sulphuric acid, SO<hi rend="subscript">3</hi></cell><cell>6∙410</cell><cell>11·576</cell><cell>11·88</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Carbonic acid @@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>, CO„</cell><cell>0∙152</cell><cell>0∙274</cell><cell>Not determined.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Lime, CaO	</cell><cell>1∙676</cell><cell>3·026</cell><cell>2∙93</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Magnesia, MgO	</cell><cell>6∙209</cell><cell>11∙212</cell><cell>11∙03</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Potash, K<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>O 	</cell><cell>1·332</cell><cell>2∙405</cell><cell>1·93</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Soda, Na<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>0 	</cell><cell>41∙234</cell><cell>74∙462</cell><cell/></row><row><cell/><cell>(Basic oxygen, equi-</cell><cell/><cell/><cell/></row><row><cell/><cell>valent to the halo-</cell><cell/><cell/><cell/></row><row><cell/><cell>gens) 	</cell><cell>(-12∙493)</cell><cell>(-22∙559)</cell><cell/></row><row><cell/><cell>Total salts	</cell><cell>100·000</cell><cell>180∙584</cell><cell>181·1</cell></row></table><table><row><cell cols="2"><hi rend="smallcaps">Table</hi> II.—<hi rend="italic">Results from combining Acids and Bases</hi> (Dittmar).</cell></row><row><cell><p>Chloride of sodium	77·758</p><p>Chloride of magnesium ...10·878 Sulphate of magnesium ... 4·737 Sulphate of lime	 3·600</p></cell><cell><p>Sulphate of potash		2·465</p><p>Bromide of magnesium	0·217</p><p>Carbonate of lime 	 0·345</p></cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Total salts... 100·000</cell></row></table><p>Reducing to the absolute mass of the ocean as given above, we arrive at the following numbers :—</p><table><row><cell cols="4"><hi rend="smallcaps">Table</hi> III.—<hi rend="italic">Absolute Composition of the Salts of the Ocean. </hi>Unit=l million million = 10<hi rend="superscript">12</hi> tons.</cell></row><row><cell>Chloride of sodium 	</cell><cell>..35990</cell><cell>Sulphate of potash 	</cell><cell>1141</cell></row><row><cell>Chloride of magnesium</cell><cell>.. 5034</cell><cell>Bromide of magnesium ...</cell><cell>100</cell></row><row><cell>Sulphate of magnesium</cell><cell>.. 2192</cell><cell>Carbonate of lime	</cell><cell>160</cell></row><row><cell>Sulphate of lime 	</cell><cell>.. 1666</cell><cell/><cell>46283</cell></row><row><cell>Total bromine ..</cell><cell/><cell>	87·2 (Dittmar).</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Total iodine 	</cell><cell/><cell>	 0·03 (Köttstorfer).</cell><cell/></row><row><cell cols="2">Total chloride of rubidium</cell><cell>	25·0 (C.

This shows that Forchhammer’s proposition holds for ocean water from all depths, with one important qualification : special research on the lime showed that its quantity increases slightly but appreciably with the depth. Taking <hi rend="italic">s, m, d</hi> as representing the lime per 100 of chlorine in shallow, medium-depth, and deep- sea water respectively, Dittmar found as mean results of analyses which agreed very well together—</p><p>s=3·0175	<hi rend="italic">m</hi>= 3·0300	<hi rend="italic">d</hi>=3·0308</p><p>Probable error, ±0·0012	±0·0014	±0·0011.</p><p>But <hi rend="italic">m</hi>-<hi rend="italic">s</hi> = 0·0124 and <hi rend="italic">d-s</hi> = 0·0132. One explanation of this result is that the crustaceans, foraminifera, and molluscs which form carbonate of lime shells live chiefly in surface waters, but after their death sink to the bottom, where—especially in great depths—their carbonate of lime is partially redissolved.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Oceanic Carbonic Acid.—</hi>It is well known that not only in the neighbourhood of actual volcanoes but in thousands of other places on the dry land carbonic acid gas is constantly streaming forth into the atmosphere, and it is generally admitted now that this supply of telluric carbonic acid amounts to more than all that is furnished by processes of combustion and respiration. That carbonic acid springs should be absent from the bottom of the ocean is too absurd an assumption to be entertained ; hence, supposing even the water of the ocean were perfectly neutral, it could not but contain dissolved carbonic acid. But such carbonic acid, at the ocean surface at least, would constantly tend to assume, and in general probably actually would come down to, the small limit value prescribed to it by the given proportion by volume of the carbonic acid in the atmosphere and the laws of gas - absorption. This proportion, according to the best modern researches, is almost constant, everywhere amounting to very nearly 0·0003 volume per unit volume of air. The coefficient of absorption by even pure water is 1·8 at 0° and 1·0 at 15° C. Hence, even in the polar regions, the surface water could not hold in permanent solution more than about 0·54 c.c., or say one milligramme per litre of water.
