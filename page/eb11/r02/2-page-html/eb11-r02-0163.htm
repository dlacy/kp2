<p><span class="font2">RESTRAINT (from “to restrain,” Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">restringere,</span><span class="font2"> to hold back, prevent), in law, a restriction or limitation. The word is&nbsp;used particularly in three connexions: i. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Restraint on Anticipation.</span><span class="font2"> Although it is a principle of English law that there can&nbsp;be no restriction of the right of alienation of property vested in&nbsp;any person under an instrument, equity makes an exception in&nbsp;the case of a married woman, and has laid down the rule that&nbsp;property may be so settled to the separate use of a married&nbsp;woman that she cannot, during coverture, alienate it or anticipate&nbsp;the income. Restraint on anticipation attaches only during&nbsp;coverture and is therefore removed on widowhood, but it may&nbsp;attach again on remarriage. By the Conveyancing Act 1881,&nbsp;s. 39, a court may however, if it thinks fit, by judgment or order&nbsp;bind a married woman's interest in her property, with her&nbsp;consent, if it appears to be for her benefit, notwithstanding that&nbsp;she is restained from anticipating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Restraint of Marriage.—</span><span class="font2">A gift or bequest to a person may&nbsp;have a condition attached in restraint of marriage. This&nbsp;condition may be either general or partial. A condition in&nbsp;general restraint of marriage is void, as being contrary to public&nbsp;policy, although a condition in restraint of a second marriage&nbsp;is not void. A condition in partial restraint of marriage is&nbsp;valid, and may be either to restrain marriage with a particular&nbsp;class of persons, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> a papist, a domestic servant, or a Scotsman,&nbsp;or under a certain age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Restraint of Trade.—</span><span class="font2">A contract in general restraint of.&nbsp;trade is void as being against public policy. In the leading&nbsp;case of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mitchell</span><span class="font2"> v. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reynolds,</span><span class="font2"> 1711, r Smith L.C., it was laid down&nbsp;that “ it is the privilege of a trader in a free country, in all&nbsp;matters not contrary to law, to regulate his own mode of carrying it on according to his own discretion and choice. If the law&nbsp;has regulated or restrained his mode of doing this, the law must&nbsp;be obeyed. But no power short of the general law ought to&nbsp;restrain his free discretion.” It has been suggested that the&nbsp;rule dates from a time when a covenant by a man not to exercise&nbsp;his own trade meant a covenant not to exercise any trade at&nbsp;all—every man being obliged to confine himself to the trade&nbsp;to which he had been apprenticed. However, contracts which&nbsp;are only in partial restraint of trade are good. A contract not&nbsp;to carry on the business of an ironmonger would be bad; but a&nbsp;contract made by the seller of an ironmonger’s business not to&nbsp;compete with the buyer would be good. To make such a contract&nbsp;binding it must be founded on a valuablç consideration and must&nbsp;not go beyond what is reasonably necessary for the protection&nbsp;of the other party. This is the tendency also of the law in the&nbsp;United States.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RESZKE, JEAN DE (1850- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), operatic singer, was born</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">at Warsaw on the 14th of January 1850. His parents were Poles; his father was a state official and his mother a capable&nbsp;amateur singer, their house being a recognized musical centre.&nbsp;After singing as a boy in the Cathedral of Warsaw, he studied&nbsp;law in the university there, but in a few years he abandoned&nbsp;this and went to Italy to study singing. He made his first&nbsp;public appearance, as a baritone, at Venice in January 1874,&nbsp;as Alfonso in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Favorita,</span><span class="font2"> and in the following April he sang&nbsp;for the first time in London, appearing at Drury Lane Theatre,&nbsp;and a little later in Paris. He was not entirely successful and&nbsp;retired for a further period of study, during which his voice&nbsp;gained remarkably in the upper register; so that when he made&nbsp;his first reappearance at Madrid in 1879 it was as a tenor, in&nbsp;the title-rôle of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Robert le Diable.</span><span class="font2"> Jean de Reszke’s great fame&nbsp;as a singer dates from this time. For several seasons he sang&nbsp;regularly in Paris, and he reappeared at Drury Lane in 1887 as&nbsp;Radames. In the next year he was again in London, this time&nbsp;at Covent Garden as Vasco da Gama; this appearance was&nbsp;mainly responsible for the revival of the opera as a fashionable&nbsp;amusement in London. He appeared in London nearly every year&nbsp;from this date until 1900. In 1891 he visited America, and from&nbsp;1893 to 1899 he was welcomed each year at the Metropolitan&nbsp;Opera House in New York. Jean de Reszke’s most successful&nbsp;parts were the title-rôle of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Cid,</span><span class="font2"> which was written for him by</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Massenet, and those of Romeo, Lancelot in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Elaine,</span><span class="font2"> and Lohengrin, Walther von Stolzing, Siegfried and Tristan in Wagner’s operas.&nbsp;In 1904 illness compelled him to retire from the stage, and he&nbsp;subsequently divided his time between teaching singing in Paris&nbsp;and breeding race-horses in Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Jean de Reszke’s younger brother, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Edouard,</span><span class="font2"> born at Warsaw on the 23rd of December 1855, is also famous as an operatic&nbsp;singer. He appeared for the first time in Paris in April 1896,&nbsp;and has since sung with his brother for many seasons both in&nbsp;London and in New York. His magnificent bass voice and&nbsp;admirable technique earned him fame in such parts as those of&nbsp;Mephistopheles in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Faust,</span><span class="font2"> Charles V. in Marchetti’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Don Qiovanni&nbsp;P Austria,</span><span class="font2"> Walter in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tell,</span><span class="font2"> the Count in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sonnambula,</span><span class="font2"> Prince Gudal&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Demonio,</span><span class="font2"> and Hans Sachs, King Mark, Hunding and Hagen&nbsp;in Wagner’s operas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETABLE (Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rêtable,</span><span class="font2"> a shortened form derived from Med. Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retrotabulum),</span><span class="font2"> a term of ecclesiastical art and architecture,&nbsp;applied in modern English usage to an altar-ledge or shelf,&nbsp;raised slightly above the back of the altar or communion table,&nbsp;on which are placed the cross, ceremonial candlesticks and&nbsp;other ornaments. Retables may be lawfully used in thè church&nbsp;of England </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Liddell</span><span class="font2"> ô* </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Beale,</span><span class="font2"> i860, 14 P.C.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Foreign usage of the term, as in French, is different, and where the word is kept with this foreign application, the distinction&nbsp;should be observed. The Med. Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rdrotabulurn</span><span class="font1"> (modernized </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">re-tabulurn)</span><span class="font1"> was applied to an architectural feature set up at the back&nbsp;of an altar, and generally taking the form of a screen framing a&nbsp;picture, carved or sculptured work in wood or stone, or mosaic,&nbsp;or of a movable feature such as the famous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pala P Oro</span><span class="font1"> in St Mark's,&nbsp;Venice, of gold, jewels and enamels. The foreign “ rétable ” is,&nbsp;therefore, what should in English be Ciilled a “ reredos ” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> though&nbsp;that is not in modern usage a movable feature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETAIL, the sale of goods or commodities in small quantities to the immediate consumer, opposed to a sale wholesale or&nbsp;in gross. The O. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retaille,</span><span class="font2"> from which the word is taken,&nbsp;meant a piece cut off, from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tailler,</span><span class="font2"> to cut, Med. Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">taleare,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">talea,</span><span class="font2"> a rod, cutting for planting. The English meaning&nbsp;appears in Anglo-French and in the Italian </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retaglio,</span><span class="font2"> selling by&nbsp;the piece. The other meaning of “ retail,” to repeat a story,&nbsp;is a transferred sense of an early meaning, “ to sell at second&nbsp;hand.” The Latin source is also seen in the related words&nbsp;“entail,” “tailor,” “detail” and “tally.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETAINER (from “ retain,” Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retinere,</span><span class="font2"> to hold back, keep), properly the act of retaining or keeping for oneself,&nbsp;or a person or object which retains or keeps; historically, a&nbsp;follower of a house or family, and particularly used of armed&nbsp;followers attached to the barons of the middle ages. John&nbsp;Cowell, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Interpreter</span><span class="font2"> (160^), defines “retainer” as a&nbsp;“ servant not meniall nor familiar, that is, not continually&nbsp;dwelling in the house of his lord or master, but onely using or&nbsp;bearing his name or livery.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Retainer of Counsel.—</span><span class="font2">When it is considered desirable by a litigant that the services of any particular counsel (barrister) should be obtained for the conduct of his case, it is&nbsp;necessary to deposit with counsel a form of retainer together&nbsp;with the necessary fee in cash, from which time counsel is&nbsp;bound to give the party who has thus retained him the first&nbsp;call on his services in the matter in which he has been retained.&nbsp;Retainers are either </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">general</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">special.</span><span class="font2"> A general retainer is&nbsp;one which retains counsel for all proceedings in which the.&nbsp;person retaining is a party, and lasts for the joint lives of client&nbsp;and counsel. If any other person offers a special retainer&nbsp;or brief against the general retainer, counsel must give the&nbsp;general retainer notice of such offer—and if after a reasonable&nbsp;time the general retainer does not himself specially retain&nbsp;or brief counsel, the general retainer is forfeited. A special&nbsp;retainer is one which only applies to some particular cause&nbsp;or action. It can only be delivered after the action is begun,&nbsp;and gives the client a right to the services of counsel throughout&nbsp;the course of the action^ and counsel is entitled to be briefed on&nbsp;all occasions to which the retain er „applies. Retainer rules&nbsp;were drawn up in 1901 by the Bar Committee, read by the Bar&nbsp;Council and approved by the Attorney-General and the Council</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
