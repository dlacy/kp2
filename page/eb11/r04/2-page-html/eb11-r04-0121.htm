<p><span class="font1">imported from beyond the sea, and with the foreign slave-labour purchased by the capital of wealthier men.@@<sup>1</sup> Farming became&nbsp;unprofitable, and the hard laborious life with its scanty returns&nbsp;was thrown into still darker relief when compared with the&nbsp;stirring life of the camps with its opportunities of booty, or&nbsp;with the cheap provisions, frequent largesses and gay spectacles&nbsp;to be had in the large towns. The small holders went off to&nbsp;follow the eagles or swell the proletariat of the cities, and their&nbsp;holdings were left to run waste or merged in the vineyards,&nbsp;oliveyards and above all in the great cattlefarms of the rich,&nbsp;and their own place was taken by slaves. The evil was worst&nbsp;in Etruria and in southern Italy; but everywhere it was serious&nbsp;enough to demand the earnest attention of Roman statesmen.&nbsp;Of its existence the government had received plenty of warning&nbsp;in the declining numbers of able-bodied males returned at the&nbsp;census,@@<sup>2</sup> in the increasing difficulties of recruiting for the&nbsp;legions,@@<sup>3</sup> in servile outbreaks in Etruria and Apulia@@<sup>4 </sup>and&nbsp;between 200 and 160 a good deal was attempted by&nbsp;way of remedy. In addition to the foundation of&nbsp;twenty colonies,@@<sup>5</sup> there were frequent allotments of land to&nbsp;veteran soldiers, especially in Apulia and Samnium.@@<sup>6</sup> In&nbsp;180, 40,000 Ligurians were removed from their homes&nbsp;and settled on vacant lands once the property of a&nbsp;Samnite tribe,@@<sup>7</sup> and in 160 the Pomptine marshes&nbsp;were drained for the purpose of cultivation.@@<sup>8</sup> But these efforts&nbsp;were only partially successful. The colonies planted in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cisalpine Gaul and in Picenum flourished, but of the others the majority slowly dwindled away, and two required recolonizing only eight years after their foundation.@@<sup>9</sup> The&nbsp;veterans who received land were unfitted to make good farmers;&nbsp;and large numbers, on the first opportunity, gladly returned&nbsp;as volunteers to a soldier’s life. Moreover, after 160&nbsp;even these efforts ceased, and with the single exception&nbsp;of the colony of Auximum in Picenum (157) nothing&nbsp;was done to check the spread of the evil, until in 133</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tiberius Gracchus, on his election to the tribunate, set his hand to the work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The remedy proposed by Gracchus@@<sup>10</sup> amounted in effect to the resumption by the state of as much of the “ common land ”&nbsp;as was not held in occupation by authorized persons&nbsp;and conformably to the provisions of the Licinian&nbsp;law,@@<sup>11</sup> and the distribution in allotments of the land&nbsp;thus rescued for the community from the monopoly of a few.&nbsp;It was a scheme which could quote in its favour ancient precedent as well as urgent necessity. Of the causes which led&nbsp;to its ultimate failure something will be said later on; for the&nbsp;present we must turn to the constitutional conflict which it&nbsp;provoked. The senate from the first identified itself with the&nbsp;interests of the wealthy occupiers, and Tiberius found himself&nbsp;forced into a struggle with that body, which had been no part&nbsp;of his original plan. He fell back on the legislative sovereignty&nbsp;of the assembly; he resuscitated the half-forgotten powers of&nbsp;interference vested in the tribunate in order to paralyse&nbsp;the action of the senatorial magistrates, and finally lost his&nbsp;life in an attempt to make good one of the weak points in the&nbsp;tribune’s position by securing his own re-election for a second&nbsp;year. But the conflict did not end with bis death. It was</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">renewed on a wider scale, and with a more deliberate aim by his brother Gaius,who on his election to the tribunate (123)&nbsp;at once came forward as the avowed enemy of the&nbsp;senate.@@<sup>12</sup> The latter suddenly found its control of&nbsp;the administration threatened at a variety of points. On&nbsp;the invitation of the popular tribune the assembly proceeded&nbsp;to restrict the senate’s freedom of action in assigning the provinces.@@<sup>13</sup> It regulated the taxation of the province of Asia@@<sup>14&nbsp;</sup>and altered the conditions of military service.@@<sup>15</sup> In home&nbsp;affairs it inflicted two serious blows on the senate’s authority&nbsp;by declaring the summary punishment of Roman citizens by&nbsp;the consuls on the strength of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">senatus consultum</span><span class="font1"> to be a&nbsp;violation of the law of appeal,@@<sup>16</sup> and by taking out of the senate’s&nbsp;hands the control of the newly established court for the trial&nbsp;of cases of magisterial misgovernment in the provinces.@@<sup>17&nbsp;</sup>Tiberius had committed the mistake of relying too exclusively&nbsp;on the support of one section only of the community; his&nbsp;brother endeavoured to enlist on the popular side every available ally. The Latins and Italians had opposed an agrarian&nbsp;scheme which took from them land which they had come to&nbsp;regard as rightfully theirs, and gave them no share in the&nbsp;benefit of the allotments,@@<sup>l8</sup> Gaius not only removed this latter&nbsp;grievance,@@<sup>19</sup> but ardently supported and himself brought forward&nbsp;the first proposals made in Rome for their enfranchisement,@@<sup>20&nbsp;</sup>The indifference of the city populace, to whom the prospect of&nbsp;small holdings in a remote district of Italy was not a tempting&nbsp;one, was overcome by the establishment of regular monthly&nbsp;doles of corn at a low price.@@<sup>21</sup> Finally, the men of business—&nbsp;the publicans, merchants and money-lenders-r-were conciliated&nbsp;by the privilege granted to them of collecting the tithes of the&nbsp;new province of Asia, and placed in direct rivalry with the&nbsp;senate by the substitution of men of their own class as judges&nbsp;in the “ quaestio de repetundis,” in place of senators.@@<sup>22</sup> The&nbsp;organizer of this concerted attack upon the position of the&nbsp;senate fell, like his brother, in a riot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The agrarian reforms of the two Gracchi had little permanent effect.@@<sup>23</sup> Even in the lifetime of Gaius the clause in his brother’s&nbsp;law rendering the new holdings inalienable was repealed, and the process of absorption recommenced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 118 a stop was put to further allotment of occupied lands, and finally, in hi, the whole position of the&nbsp;agrarian question was altered by a law which converted all land still held in occupation into private&nbsp;land.@@<sup>24</sup> The old controversy as to the proper use of&nbsp;the lands of the community was closed by this act of alienation.&nbsp;The controversy in future turns, not on the right of the poor</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
