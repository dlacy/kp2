<p><span class="font1">scribblers, but he was also for fifty years the most celebrated entertainer of celebrities in London. From 1803, when he removed from his chambers in the Temple, till&nbsp;the last year of his long life, his house, 22 St James’s&nbsp;Place, was the common meeting-ground of men of distinction in every walk of life. Hence, though his poems are&nbsp;no longer read except by the student, his name is kept&nbsp;alive in the letters and diaries of associates whose works&nbsp;are more permanent than his own,—kept alive, too, not&nbsp;merely as that of a cultured Amphitryon but as that of a&nbsp;conversational wit whose tart sayings are worthy of record.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He was born at Newington Green (London) on 30th July 1763, the son of a wealthy London banker, and related on the mother’s side to the celebrated Nonconformist divines Philip and Matthew Henry. Dr Price,&nbsp;the Unitarian, Burke’s antagonist, was the family pastor&nbsp;and a frequent visitor at his father’s house. The influence of this writer’s philosophy can be traced in Rogers’s&nbsp;poems. Rogers was educated at the famous Nonconformist&nbsp;academy at Newington Green, where Defoe had been a&nbsp;pupil a hundred years before. Attention to English studies&nbsp;had been a distinct object in this school from its foundation, and Rogers, his youthful ambition awakened, rushed&nbsp;into print as an essayist in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gentleman's Magazine</span><span class="font1"> at&nbsp;the age of eighteen. His main desire then was to be a&nbsp;preacher like Dr Price; but he yielded to his father’s&nbsp;advice and entered the paternal bank. But he was far&nbsp;from abandoning his love for literature. He read Gray&nbsp;and Goldsmith on his way to the bank, and in 1786&nbsp;proved his admiration for these exemplars in a volume&nbsp;containing some pretty imitations of Goldsmith and a&nbsp;wildly apostrophic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ode to Superstition</span><span class="font1"> after the manner&nbsp;of Gray. This volume contains one of the few passages&nbsp;of his that are often quoted—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ There ’s such a charm in melancholy,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I would not, if I could, be gay.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Following Gray’s example, the youthful poet took great pains with his verses, and, after nine years’ maturing,&nbsp;published in 1792 a more elaborate and more successful&nbsp;bid for poetic laurels, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Pleasures of Memory.</span><span class="font1"> This&nbsp;poem may be regarded as the last blaze of the poetic&nbsp;diction of the 18th century before its final extinction.&nbsp;We see here carried to the extremest pitch the theory of&nbsp;elevating and refining familiar themes by abstract treatment and noble imagery. So simple an act as that of&nbsp;trying to remember a half-forgotten fact or fancy is elaborately and beautifully compared to the search of an impatient mother for a child lost in a forest. The common&nbsp;organ-grinder becomes “ the blithe son of Savoy,” and as&nbsp;such is presented in a most romantic situation as an&nbsp;object for refined sympathy. The good familiar creature&nbsp;memory itself is transfigured into a gracious personification of most benignant and wide-reaching power. In this&nbsp;art of “raising a subject,” as the 18th century phrase&nbsp;was, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pleasures of Memory</span><span class="font1"> is much more perfect than&nbsp;Campbell’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pleasures of Hope,</span><span class="font1"> published a few years later&nbsp;in imitation. Byron’s criticism is complete,—“there is&nbsp;not a vulgar line in the poem.” This is the acme of&nbsp;positive praise for the fashionable serious poetry of the&nbsp;18th century : when this can be said of a poet, he has&nbsp;reached the perfection of its ideal of poetic diction. In&nbsp;this poem the characters of the school can be analysed in&nbsp;cold blood, for there is not much excitement in laboured&nbsp;reflexions on the pleasures of memory. Human interest&nbsp;is at a minimum in such frigid exercises ; it is almost&nbsp;entirely an affair of diction. The chief feeling excited is&nbsp;astonishment at the pains taken by the poet to provide&nbsp;thick and showy wrappages for such starveling little&nbsp;children of thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was six years before Rogers was ready with another of his elaborate poems,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">An Epistle to a Emend</span><span class="font1"> (1798).&nbsp;This has at least the advantage of some personal interest.&nbsp;It describes the poet’s ideal of a comfortable life, and&nbsp;may be put side by side with Pomfret’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Choice</span><span class="font1"> for literary&nbsp;comparison, and with the poet’s own life for fifty years&nbsp;afterwards. Although for conventional poetic reasons&nbsp;Rogers establishes his ideal house in the country instead&nbsp;of in St James’s Place, still the principles of living are the&nbsp;same which afterwards regulated his real life and were&nbsp;carried out with easy steady perseverance. “It is the&nbsp;design of this Epistle to illustrate the virtue of True Taste ;&nbsp;and to show how little she requires to secure not only the&nbsp;comforts but even the elegancies of life. True Taste is&nbsp;an excellent Economist.” Rogers illustrated this maxim&nbsp;in proceeding to surround himself with rare and beautiful&nbsp;works of art and letters, and to make his house the centre&nbsp;for all that was most distinguished and agreeable in&nbsp;London society. Many persons in his time spent ten&nbsp;times as much in the pursuit of a similar object without&nbsp;one-tenth of the success. “ I believe,” Mrs Norton wrote,&nbsp;“ no man ever was so much attended to and thought of&nbsp;who had so slender a fortune and such calm abilities. His&nbsp;God was Harmony ; and over his life Harmony presided&nbsp;sitting on a lukewarm cloud.” When he moved to St&nbsp;James’s Place in 1803 he withdrew from active concern&nbsp;in the bank, contenting himself with a moderate income&nbsp;as a sleeping partner ; and so careful a manager was he&nbsp;of this income that he was able not only to entertain and&nbsp;to buy choice things—his collection, which seems to have&nbsp;contained hardly a particle of rubbish, fetching &lt;£50,000&nbsp;when sold after his death—but also to extend generous&nbsp;help to struggling men of letters. It was Rogers who&nbsp;came to Sheridan’s relief in his last days when he was&nbsp;deserted by his titled friends; Moore and Campbell received&nbsp;help in need from him, as munificent as it was delicately&nbsp;offered ; and he was always ready to befriend much less&nbsp;distinguished merit in distress. It was perhaps characteristic of a man so cautious, equable, and dispassionate that&nbsp;his wit had a depreciating turn and was often exercised&nbsp;with calm insolence at the expense of fussy pretence.&nbsp;But that the man was on the whole of a kindly and lovable&nbsp;nature was shown by an incident late in his life. His&nbsp;popularity was put to the test of misfortune by the robbery&nbsp;of his bank. Most of the money was recovered, but upon&nbsp;the news of the misfortune several men of wealth and title&nbsp;came forward with large offers of assistance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although the laureateship was pressed upon Rogers by the prince consort on Wordsworth’s death in 1850, he had&nbsp;not been a prolific poet during his long life of cultured&nbsp;leisure and social enjoyment. He continued his practice&nbsp;of writing little and writing slowly. Fourteen years intervened between the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epistle</span><span class="font1"> and the publication of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Voyage of Columbus</span><span class="font1"> in 1812. In method this poem was&nbsp;a compromise between the old school of reflective poetry&nbsp;and the new school of narrative. The story of Columbus&nbsp;was the theme, but the story was not told : it was only&nbsp;indicated in a series of reflexions on its most striking&nbsp;moments. The experiment helped forward the literary&nbsp;movement ; the new school through Byron took the hint,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Giaour,</span><span class="font1"> though interpenetrated with a more&nbsp;vigorous life, was avowedly written on the model of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Columbus,</span><span class="font1"> and dedicated to Rogers. In his next poem,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jacqueline,</span><span class="font1"> which was published in the same volume with&nbsp;Byron’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lara</span><span class="font1"> in 1814, much to the benefit of the wits of&nbsp;the time, Rogers may be said to have gone over to the&nbsp;new school, adopting their four-accent measure and showing his skill, which was considerable, in pure narrative.&nbsp;His reflective poem on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Human Life,</span><span class="font1"> though published in&nbsp;1819, can hardly be described as a reversion, for he had&nbsp;been engaged on it off and on for twelve years. It is</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
