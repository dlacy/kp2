        <p><span class="font1">of 449 clearly involved more than a restoration of the old form of
                government. The Valerio-Horatian laws, besides&nbsp;reaffirming the right of appeal
                and the inviolability of the&nbsp;tribunes, improved the position of the plebeian
                assemblies&nbsp;by enacting that “ plebiscita ” passed in them, and, as
                seems&nbsp;probable, approved by the patres, should be binding on&nbsp;patricians as
                well as plebeians.@@<sup>1</sup> By this law the tribunes&nbsp;obtained a recognized
                initiative in legislation. Henceforth the desired reforms were introduced and
                carried by&nbsp;tribunes in what were now styled “ comitia tributa,” and,&nbsp;if
                sanctioned by the patres, became laws of the state.&nbsp;From this period, too, must
                be dated the legalization at&nbsp;any rate of the tribune’s right to impeach any
                citizen&nbsp;before the assembly of the tribes.@@<sup>2</sup> Henceforward
                there&nbsp;is no question of the tribune’s right to propose to the&nbsp;plebs to
                impose a fine, or of the validity of the sentence&nbsp;when passed. The efficiency
                of these new -weapons of&nbsp;attack was amply proved by the subsequent course
                of&nbsp;the struggle. Only a few years after the Valerio-Horatian&nbsp;legislation
                came the lex Canuleia (445 </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.),</span><span class="font1"> by
                -which&nbsp;mixed marriages between patricians and plebeians were&nbsp;declared
                lawful, and the social exclusiveness of the&nbsp;patriciate broken down. In the same
                year with this&nbsp;measure, and like it in the interests primarily of
                the&nbsp;wealthier plebeians, a vigorous attack commenced on the&nbsp;patrician
                monopoly of the consulate, and round this&nbsp;stronghold of patrician ascendency
                the conflict raged until&nbsp;the passing of the Licinian laws in 367. The
                original&nbsp;proposal of Canuleius in 445 that the people should be&nbsp;allowed to
                elect a plebeian consul was evaded by a compromise. The senate resolved that for the
                next year, in&nbsp;the stead of consuls, six military tribunes with
                consular&nbsp;powers should be elected,@@<sup>3</sup> and that the new office
                should&nbsp;be open to patricians and plebeians alike. The consulship&nbsp;was thus
                for the time saved from pollution, as the patricians phrased it, but the growing
                strength of the plebs is&nbsp;shown by the fact that in fifty years out of the
                seventy-eight between 444 and 366 they succeeded in obtaining&nbsp;the election of
                consular tribunes rather than of consuls. A&nbsp;good omen for their ultimate
                success was a victory they&nbsp;won in connexion with the inferior office of the
                qusestorship.&nbsp;Down to the time of the decemvirate the quaestors had&nbsp;been
                nominated by the consuls, but in 447 their appointment was transferred to the
                plebeian “comitia tributa,”&nbsp;and in 421 the first plebeian was elected to the
                    office.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>Despite, however, these discouragements, the
                patricians&nbsp;fought on. Each year they strove to secure the creation&nbsp;of
                consuls rather than consular tribunes, and failing this&nbsp;strained every nerve to
                secure for their own order at least&nbsp;a majority among the latter. Even the
                institution of&nbsp;the censorship (435), though rendered desirable by
                the&nbsp;increasing importance and complexity of the census, was,&nbsp;it is
                probable, due in part to their desire to discount beforehand the threatened loss of
                the consulship by diminishing its powers.@@<sup>5</sup> Other causes, too, helped to
                protract&nbsp;the struggle. Between the wealthier plebeians, who were&nbsp;ambitious
                of high office, and the poorer, whose minds were&nbsp;set rather on allotments of
                land, there was a division of&nbsp;interest of which the patricians were not slow to
                take</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">advantage, and to this must be added the pressure of war. The death
                struggle with Veii and the sack of Rome&nbsp;by the Gauls absorbed for the time all
                the energies of&nbsp;the community. In 377, however, two of the tribunes,&nbsp;C.
                I.icinius Stolo and L. Sextius, came forward with proposals which united all
                sections of the plebs in their&nbsp;support. Their proposals were as follows
                    :@@<sup>6</sup> (1) that consuls and not consular tribunes be elected; (2) that
                one&nbsp;consul at least should be a plebeian ; (3) that the priestly&nbsp;college,
                which had the charge of the Sibylline books, should&nbsp;consist of ten members
                instead of two, and that of these&nbsp;half should be plebeians; (4) that no single
                citizen should&nbsp;hold in occupation more than 500 acres of the common&nbsp;lands,
                or pasture upon them more than 100 head of cattle&nbsp;and 500 sheep; (5) that all
                landowners should employ a&nbsp;certain amount of free as w<sup>r</sup>ell as slave
                labour on their&nbsp;estates</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">;
                (6)</span><span class="font1"> that interest already paid on debts should
                be&nbsp;deducted from the principal, and the remainder paid off&nbsp;in three years.
                The three last proposals w’ere obviously&nbsp;intended to meet the demands of the
                poorer plebeians,&nbsp;and to secure their support for the first half of the
                scheme.&nbsp;Ten years of bitter conflict followed, but at last, in
                367&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >b.c.,</span><span class="font1"> the Licinian rogations became law, and one of
                their&nbsp;authors, L. Sextius, was created the first plebeian consul.&nbsp;For the
                moment it was some consolation to the patricians&nbsp;that they not only succeeded
                in detaching from the consulship the administration of civil law, which was
                entrusted to&nbsp;a separate officer, “ praetor urbanus, ” to be elected by
                the&nbsp;comitia of the centuries, with an understanding apparently&nbsp;that he
                should be a patrician, but also obtained the&nbsp;institution of two additional
                sediles (“aediles curules”), who&nbsp;were in like manner to be members of their own
                    order.@@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>With the opening of the consulship, however, the issue
                of&nbsp;the long contest was virtually decided, and the next eighty&nbsp;years
                witnessed a rapid succession of plebeian victories.&nbsp;Now that a plebeian consul
                might preside at the elections,&nbsp;the main difficulty in the way of the
                nomination and&nbsp;election of plebeian candidates -was removed. The proposed
                patrician monopoly of the new curule sedileship was&nbsp;almost instantly abandoned.
                In 356 the first plebeian&nbsp;was made dictator, in 350 the censorship, and in 337
                the&nbsp;praetorship were filled for the first time by plebeians, and&nbsp;lastly,
                in 300, by the lex Ogulnia, even the sacred&nbsp;colleges of the pontiffs and
                augurs, the old strongholds of&nbsp;patrician supremacy, were thrown open to the
                    plebs@@<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>The patricians lost also the control they had exercised
                so&nbsp;long over the action of the people in assembly. The&nbsp;“ patrum
                auctoritas,” the sanction given or refused by the&nbsp;patrician senators to laws
                and to elections, had hitherto&nbsp;been a powerful weapon in their hands. But in
                339 a&nbsp;law of Q. Publilius Philo, a plebeian dictator, enacted&nbsp;that this
                sanction should be given beforehand to all laws @@<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>and by a lex
                Maenia, carried apparently some fifty years&nbsp;later, the same rule was extended
                to elections. Henceforward the “patrum auctoritas” sank into a
                meaningless&nbsp;form, though as such it still survived in the time of Livy.&nbsp;A
                second Publilian law affirmed afresh the validity of&nbsp;“plebiscita,” </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> of
                measures carried in the plebeian&nbsp;comitia tributa. Apparently, however, their
                validity was&nbsp;still left subject to some conditions, for in 287 a
                lex&nbsp;Hortensia, carried by another plebeian dictator, was&nbsp;found necessary
                finally to settle the question.@@<sup>10</sup> From 287&nbsp;onwards it is certain
                that measures passed by the plebs,&nbsp;voting by their tribes, had the full force
                of law’s without</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>Livy, iii. 55, “quum veluti in controverso jure
                esset, tenerenturne patres plt-biscitis legem comitiis centuriatis tulere, ut quod
                tributim&nbsp;plebs jussissetpopulum teneret, qua lege tribuniciis rogationibus

                which&nbsp;a “ plebiscitum ” became law, and what was the exact effect of the
                lex&nbsp;Publilia of 339 and the lex Hortensia of 287, can only be
                conjectured.&nbsp;One of the two last can hardly have been more than a reaffirmation
                of&nbsp;a previous law.</span></p>
