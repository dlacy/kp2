<p><span class="font2">But it was the tendency of the whole jurisprudence of the time, and by no means peculiar to the praetorian creation. Nowhere in the&nbsp;texts are the praetors spoken of as the mouthpieces of equity as&nbsp;distinguished from law. Such a distinction recurs frequently in&nbsp;Cicero; he identifies </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aequitas</span><span class="font2"> with the spirit of a law or agreement,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus</span><span class="font2"> with its letter, but it is in order to sin£ the praises not of&nbsp;the praetors but of the pleaders who maintained the former as&nbsp;against the latter, and of the judges who were persuaded by their&nbsp;arguments. Much of what was contained in the edict might quite&nbsp;as well have been embodied in statute, and we know that in time&nbsp;statute came to its aid; witness a very remarkable provision of it—&nbsp;“ I will give </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">honor um possessio</span><span class="font2"> as may be enjoined by statute,&nbsp;whether comitial enactment or scnatusconsult.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of the edicts of the peregrin praetor and their relation to that of his urban colleague little is known. That they differed in some&nbsp;respects there can be no doubt, for.in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lex Rubria</span><span class="font2"> (49 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font2"> for&nbsp;settling the government of Cisalpine Gaul the magistrates are&nbsp;directed, with reference to a certain action, to formulate it in the&nbsp;way prescribed in the edict of the peregrin praetor. The latter,&nbsp;therefore, must to some extent have been in advance of that of&nbsp;the urban praetor, probably in this respect, that, being prepared&nbsp;primarily for the regulation of questions affecting non-citizens, it&nbsp;more thoroughly than the other avoided formalities that were competent only to citizens, and thus to a greater extent simplified procedure, The edicts of the provincial governors must have varied&nbsp;according to circumstances, being in all cases composites of provisions, more or less numerous, borrowed from the edicts of the&nbsp;praetors and additions suggested by the peculiar wants of the&nbsp;different provinces for which they were framed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(provinciate genus&nbsp;edicendi).</span><span class="font2"> As for those of the curule aediles, who amongst other&nbsp;duties were charged with the supervision of markets, their range&nbsp;was very limited; their most important provisions having reference&nbsp;to open sales of slaves, horses and cattle, and containing regulations&nbsp;about the duties of vendors exposing them, and their responsibility&nbsp;for latent faults and vices. They also had cognisance of certain&nbsp;delicts committed in the streets and markets. As the aediles had&nbsp;no </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font2"> their restricted </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus edicendi</span><span class="font2"> may have been conferred&nbsp;on them by custom or statute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Consuetude, Prof essional Jurisprudence and Res Judicatae.—</span><span class="font2">Great as may be the difficulty experienced by philosophical jurists in&nbsp;defining the ground of the authority of consuetudinary&nbsp;law, there is no room to dispute the importance of its&nbsp;contributions to every system of jurisprudence ancient&nbsp;and modern. The men who first drew, accepted and&nbsp;endorsed a bill of exchange did as much for the law as any lawgiver&nbsp;has ever accomplished. They may or may not have acted on the&nbsp;advice of jurists; but, whether or not, they began a practice which&nbsp;grew into custom, and as such was recognized by the tribunals as&nbsp;a law-creating one—one conferring rights and imposing obligations.&nbsp;There is much of this—far more probably than is commonly imagined</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">—in the history of every system of law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Rome the process was sometimes wonderfully expeditious; witness what Justinian narrates of the introduction and recognition&nbsp;of testamentary trusts and of codicils to last wills, both in the time&nbsp;of Augustus. It can hardly be doubted that the literal contract&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">per expensilationem</span><span class="font2"> originated in the same way, probably in the&nbsp;end of the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century of the city. The&nbsp;keeping of domestic account-books may have been enjoined and&nbsp;enforced by the censors; but it was custom, and neither statute nor&nbsp;praetor’s edict, that made an entry in them to another person’s&nbsp;debit creative of a claim against the latter for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">certa pecunia credita,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">that might be made effectual by an action under the Silian law.&nbsp;It must have been in exactly the same way that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mutuum,</span><span class="font2"> formless&nbsp;loan of money, came to be regarded as the third variety of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">certa&nbsp;credita pecunia,</span><span class="font2"> and to be held recoverable under the same action.&nbsp;True, this could not have been attained without the co-operation of&nbsp;the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then each case was as a rule tried by a single private</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">citizen, whose office ended with his judgment, and who was untrammelled by the authority of any </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">series rerum judicatarum.<sup>@@1</sup> </span><span class="font2">He had simply to decide whether in his view expensilation or formless loan&nbsp;created such an obligation as was covered by the words </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pecuniam&nbsp;dari oportere.</span><span class="font2"> There may for a time have been a divergent practice,&nbsp;contradictory findings, as Cicero says there were in his day upon the&nbsp;question whether </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aequitas</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus strictum</span><span class="font2"> was to be applied to the&nbsp;determination of certain matters; but the eventual unanimity of&nbsp;judicial opinion in one direction was but the expression of the&nbsp;general sentiment of the citizens, of whom the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">judices</span><span class="font2"> were the&nbsp;representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These are but examples of the way in which consuetudinary law was constructed. It required the combined action of the laity and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the judices,</span><span class="font2"> both at times acting under professional advice; in some&nbsp;cases even that of the praetors was necessary. It would have</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">been impossible, for instance, to have introduced the consensual contracts into the Roman system and determined what were the&nbsp;obligations they imposed on either side, without magisterial cooperation in framing the formulae that were to be submitted to&nbsp;the judges. Taking the action on sale as an illustration, the formula&nbsp;substantially was this: “It bein£ averred that the defendant sold&nbsp;such or such a thing to the plaintiff, whatever, judge, it shall appear&nbsp;that the defendant ought in good faith to give to or do for the&nbsp;plaintiff in respect thereof, in the money equivalent thereof condemn&nbsp;the defendant; otherwise, acquit him.” It is very manifest that&nbsp;the free hand here given to the judge must immensely have facilitated&nbsp;the reception of customary doctrine into the law. The judge was&nbsp;to a great extent the spokesman of the forum; his judgment was&nbsp;formed in accordance with current public opinion, which he had&nbsp;ample opportunity of gauging; it was the reflection of that general&nbsp;sentiment of right, which, phrase it how we may, is the real basis&nbsp;of all customary law. And so in an action for establishing a right&nbsp;of property in a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi.</span><span class="font2"> The formula was very simple:&nbsp;“ If it appear that such or sucn a thing belongs to the plaintiff in&nbsp;quiritary right, then, judge, whatever be its value for the plaintiff, in&nbsp;that condemn the defendant; should it appear otherwise, acquit him.”&nbsp;The primary duty of a judge on sucn a remit was to determine&nbsp;whether the title on which the plaintiff founded his pretensions&nbsp;gave him a right that came up to property; and it can hardly be&nbsp;disputed that it was by the decisions of a series of judges, in a series&nbsp;of such actions, that the long list of natural inodes of acquiring&nbsp;property given, by Justinian under technical names was gradually&nbsp;brought into view. Those decisions, whether upon the obligations&nbsp;of a vendor, direct or indirect, or upon the sufficiency of a title&nbsp;founded on by a party averring a right of property by natural&nbsp;acquisition, doubtless were in many cases arrived at under professional advice, and were in all cases embodied in judgments. But&nbsp;that does not in the least deprive the doctrine deduced from them of&nbsp;its character of customary law. It was not until the Empire that the&nbsp;opinions of the jurists submitted to a judge </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jresponsa prudentium)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">were invested with binding authority. During the Republic, if a&nbsp;judge deferred to them, it was simply because he regarded them as&nbsp;in consonance with well-qualified public opinion; and what a series&nbsp;of consistent judgments </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of this sort</span><span class="font2"> built up was in the strictest&nbsp;sense a law based on consuetude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As regards the professional jurists in particular it has already been observed that, according to the testimony of the Roman historians,&nbsp;the law was a monopoly of the patricians down at least to&nbsp;the middle of the 5th century of the city. Livy goes so far&nbsp;as to speak of it as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in penetralibus pontificum repositum,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">—among the secrets of the pontifical college. It was so doubtless during the regal period. But after the publication of the XII. Tables this could be the case only in a qualified&nbsp;sense, the pontiffs becoming the official interpreters of that which&nbsp;in the letter was patent to the world. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jus Flavianum,</span><span class="font2"> with&nbsp;its formulary of actions, about the year 304 B.C., the practice of&nbsp;giving advice in law in public adopted by Tib. Coruncanius in the&nbsp;beginning of the 6th century, and the Tripertita (also called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jus&nbsp;Aelianum),</span><span class="font2"> embodying the current </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">interpretado,</span><span class="font2"> some fifty years&nbsp;later, put an end not only to pontifical but to patrician monopoly<sup>@@2</sup>&nbsp;From this time onwards there was a series of jurists </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(jurisconstdti,&nbsp;jurisperiti, jurisprudentes</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">prudentes,</span><span class="font2"> as they were styled), gradually increasing in number and eminence, of whom a list is given&nbsp;by Pomponius, and many of whom are signalized by Cicero,&nbsp;particularly in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Orator</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Brutus.</span><span class="font2"> They occupied themselves&nbsp;in giving advice to clients (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Patron and Client),</span><span class="font2"> teaching,&nbsp;pleading at the bar, framing styles of contracts, testaments, and&nbsp;various other deeds of a legal character, or writing commentaries or&nbsp;shorter treatises on different branches of the law.<sup>@@3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">iii. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Substantive Changes in the Law during the Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Publician Edict.—</span><span class="font2">There were necessarily many changes during the period in the law of property and of minor real rights,&nbsp;several of them of no mean importance. But the greatest&nbsp;of all was that effected by the Publician Edict<sup>@@4</sup> indirectly&nbsp;recognizing the validity (1) of what Theophilus calls&nbsp;bonitary ownership as an actual though inferior ownership of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">res&nbsp;mancipi,</span><span class="font2"> and (2) of what got the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidei possessio</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@1</sup> It was not until the Empire that a “ series rerum perpetuo similiter judicatarum,” a uniform series of precedents, was held to&nbsp;be law. During the Republic a judge was much freer, and not only&nbsp;entitled but bound to decide according to his own notion of what was&nbsp;right, taking the risk of consequences if his judgment was knowingly&nbsp;contrary to law.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@2 </sup>There is some doubt whether the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jus Aelianum</span><span class="font2"> mentioned by Pomponius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Dig.</span><span class="font2"> i. 2, 2, 7) was not an independent collection of&nbsp;actions by Sextus Aelius different from his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tripertita</span><span class="font2"> mentioned&nbsp;(Dig. i. 2, 2, 38).
