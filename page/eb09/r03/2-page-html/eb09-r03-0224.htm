<p><span class="font2">Under date December 21, 1671, the journal-book records that “ the lord bishop of Sarum proposed for candidate&nbsp;Mr Isaac Newton, professor of the Inathematicks at Cambridge.” Newton was elected a fellow January 11,&nbsp;1671-2, and in 1703 he was appointed president, a post&nbsp;which he held till his death in 1727. During his presidency the society moved to Crane Court, their first&nbsp;meeting in the new quarters being held November 8,&nbsp;1710. In the same year they were appointed visitors and&nbsp;directors of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, a function which they continued to perform until the accession&nbsp;of William IV., when by the new warrant then issued&nbsp;the president and six of the fellows of the Royal Astronomical Society were added to the list of visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1780, under the presidency of Sir Joseph Banks, the Royal Society removed from Crane Court to the apartments assigned to them by the Government in the new&nbsp;Somerset House, where they remained until they removed&nbsp;to Burlington House in 1857. The policy of Sir Joseph&nbsp;Banks was to render the fellowship more difficult of&nbsp;attainment than it had been, and the measures which&nbsp;he took for this purpose, combined with other circumstances, led to the rise of a faction headed by Dr Horsley.&nbsp;Throughout the years 1783 and 1784 feeling ran exceedingly high, but in the end the president was supported by&nbsp;the majority of the society. An account of the controversy will be found in a tract entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">An AUthentic Narrative of the Dissensions and Debates in the Royal Society.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">In connexion with this policy of Sir Joseph Banks may&nbsp;be mentioned a further step in the same direction taken&nbsp;in the year 1847, when the number of candidates recommended for election by the council was limited to fifteen,&nbsp;and the election was made annual. Concurrently, however, with this gradual narrowing of the Royal Society’s&nbsp;boundaries was the successive establishment of other&nbsp;scientific bodies. The founding of the Linnean Society&nbsp;in 1788 under the auspices of several fellows of the&nbsp;Royal Society was the first instance of the establishment&nbsp;of a distinct scientific association under royal charter.&nbsp;The Geological Society followed in 1807, and the Royal&nbsp;Astronomical Society in 1820. The Chemical, the Royal&nbsp;Geographical, and the Entomological are the remaining&nbsp;chartered scientific societies existing in London at the&nbsp;present time. The Royal Society continues, however, to&nbsp;hold the foremost place among the scientific bodies of&nbsp;England, not only from the number of eminent men included in its fellowship, but also from its close official connexion with the Government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The following will serve as some indication of the variety and importance of the scientific matters upon which they have been&nbsp;consulted by or have memorialized the Government during the&nbsp;last seventy years:—1816, standard measures of length; 1817,&nbsp;expedition in search of North-West Passage ; 1822, use of coal-tar&nbsp;in vessels of war ; best manner of measuring tonnage of ships ;&nbsp;1823, corrosion of copper sheathing by sea-water ; Babbage’s calculating-machine ; lightning-conductors for vessels of war; 1825,&nbsp;supervision of gas-works ; 1826, Parry’s North Polar expedition ;&nbsp;1832, tidal observations ; 1835, instruments and tables for testing&nbsp;the strength of spirits ; 1839, Antarctic expedition ; magnetic&nbsp;observatories in the colonies ; 1845, Franklin’s Arctic expedition ;&nbsp;1849-55, Government grant for scientific research ; 1862, the great&nbsp;Melbournetelescope ; 1865, pendulum observations in India ; 1866,&nbsp;reorganization of the meteorological department ; 1868, deep sea&nbsp;research; 1872, “Challenger” expedition; 1874, Arctic expedition ; 1875, eclipse expedition ; 1876, Vivisection Bill ; 1877,&nbsp;transit of Venus expedition ; 1879, prevention of accidents in&nbsp;mines; 1881, pendulum observations; 1882, transit of Venus;&nbsp;cruise of the “ Triton ” in Faroe Channel ; 1883, borings in delta of&nbsp;Nile ; 1884, Bureau des Poids et Mesures ; prime meridian conference, &amp;c. One of the most important duties which the Royal&nbsp;Society performs on behalf of the Government is the administration of the annual grant of £4000 for the promotion of scientific&nbsp;research. This grant originated in a proposal by Lord John</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Russell in 1849 that at the close of the year the president and council should point out to the first lord of the treasury a limited&nbsp;number of persons to whom the grant of a reward or of a sum to&nbsp;defray the cost of experiments might be of essential service. This&nbsp;grant of £1000 afterwards became annual, and was continued until&nbsp;1876. In that year an additional sum of £4000 for similar purposes was granted, and the two funds of £1000 and £4000 were&nbsp;administered concurrently until 1881, in which year the two were&nbsp;combined in a single annual grant of £4000 under new regulations.&nbsp;One of the most useful of the society’s undertakings of late years&nbsp;is the great catalogue of scientific papers,—an index, in eight quarto&nbsp;volumes, under authors’ names, of all the memoirs of importance&nbsp;in the chief English and foreign scientific serials from the year&nbsp;1800 to the year 1873. The work was prepared under the direction and at the expense of the Royal Society, and was printed by&nbsp;H. M. Stationery Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A statement of the trust funds administered by the Royal Society will be found in their published </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proceedings</span><span class="font1"> under date&nbsp;November 30th of each year, and the origin and history of these&nbsp;funds will be found in Weld’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Royal Society,</span><span class="font1"> and in&nbsp;the late William Spottiswoode’s “Anniversary Address for 1874”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Proc. Roy. Soe.,</span><span class="font1"> xxiii. p. 49). The income of the society is&nbsp;derived from the annual contributions and composition fees of the&nbsp;fellows, from rents, and from interest on various investments. The&nbsp;balance-sheet and an account of the estates and property are published in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proceedings</span><span class="font1"> at each anniversary. Four medals (a&nbsp;Copley, two Royal, and a Davy) are awarded by the society every&nbsp;year, and the Rumford medal in alternate years. The first of these&nbsp;originated in a bequest by Sir Godfrey Copley (1709), and is awarded&nbsp;“to the living author of such philosophical research, either published or communicated to the society, as may appear to the council&nbsp;to be deserving of that honour” ; the author may be an Englishman&nbsp;or a foreigner. The Rumford medal originated in a gift from Count&nbsp;Rumford in 1796 of £1000 3 per cent, consols, for the most&nbsp;important discoveries in heat or light made during the preceding&nbsp;two years. The Royal medals were instituted by George IV., and&nbsp;are awarded annually for the two most important contributions to&nbsp;science published in the British dominions not more than ten years&nbsp;nor less than one year from the date of the award. The Davy&nbsp;medal was founded by the will of Dr John Davy, F.R.S., the&nbsp;brother of Sir Humphry Davy, and is given annually for the most&nbsp;important discovery in chemistry made in Europe or Anglo-America.&nbsp;An enumeration of the awards of each of the medals will be found&nbsp;at the end of the list of fellows which is published annually by the&nbsp;society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Under the existing statutes of the Royal Society every candidate for election must be recommended by a certificate in writing signed&nbsp;by six or more fellows, of whom three at least must sign from&nbsp;personal knowledge. From the candidates so recommended the&nbsp;council annually select fifteen by ballot, and on the first Thursday&nbsp;in June the names so selected are submitted to the society in the&nbsp;form of a printed balloting-sheet with space left for erasure and&nbsp;substitution of names. Princes of the blood may, however, be&nbsp;proposed at any ordinary meeting and put to the vote on the same&nbsp;day, and any member of H. M. privy council may be balloted for&nbsp;on the third ordinary meeting from the day upon which his&nbsp;certificate is read. Foreign members, not exceeding fifty, may be&nbsp;selected by the council from among men of the greatest scientific&nbsp;eminence, and proposed to the society for election. Every member&nbsp;of the privileged class is liable to an admission fee of £10 and an&nbsp;annual payment of £4 ; other fellows pay £3 per annum. The&nbsp;composition for annual payments is £60.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The anniversary meeting for the election of the council and officers is held on St Andrew’s Day. The council for the ensuing&nbsp;year, out of which are chosen the president, treasurer, principal&nbsp;secretaries, and foreign secretary, must consist of eleven members&nbsp;of the existing council and ten fellows who are not members of&nbsp;the existing council. These are nominated by the president and&nbsp;council previously to the anniversary meeting. The session of&nbsp;the society is from November to June ; the ordinary meetings are&nbsp;held every Thursday during the session, at 4.30 P.M. The&nbsp;selection for publication from the papers read before the society is&nbsp;made by the “ Gommittee of Papers,” which consists of the&nbsp;members of the council for the time being aided by referees. The&nbsp;papers so selected are published either in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical&nbsp;Transactions</span><span class="font1"> (4to) or the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proceedings of the Royal Society</span><span class="font1"> (8vo),&nbsp;and one copy of each of these publications is presented gratis to&nbsp;every fellow of the society and to the chief scientific societies&nbsp;throughout the world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The making and repealing of laws is vested in the council, and in every case the question must be put to the vote on two several&nbsp;days of their meeting.</span></p>
