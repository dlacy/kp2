<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">it is a simple statement of fact to say that newspapers have on many occasions had word pictures from their descriptive reporters&nbsp;which have never been surpassed in prose writing for elegance and&nbsp;vividness and force. The special correspondent is a “ descriptive&nbsp;reporter.” He goes to war to describe what he sees. The electric&nbsp;telegraph has made a great change in the manner and perhaps in&nbsp;the character of his work ; but he is still among those who help in&nbsp;newspaper reporting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Mention has been made of the connexion of the electric telegraph with reporting ; and it has been said that, since the&nbsp;telegraphs have been extended and telegraphing has been&nbsp;cheapened, the sphere of reporting has been widened and the&nbsp;demand for it has increased. Ho daily newspaper now confines its&nbsp;reporting to the affairs of the part of the countiy in which it is&nbsp;published. The electric telegraph brings the most distant places&nbsp;within easy reach of every newspaper. It has also made the work&nbsp;of the reporter more arduous and his responsibility greater. He&nbsp;cannot postpone the transcription of his notes to another day. The&nbsp;speech that is not finished in Manchester at midnight must be&nbsp;printed in full in the London newspaper which goes to press before&nbsp;three o’clock in the morning. The meeting which does not finish&nbsp;at Wick till midnight must be reported in the next day’s papers in&nbsp;Edinburgh. All this means that the reporter must work under</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">great pressure, and that he must exercise the greatest care in extending his notes. He has no time for revision, no opportunity&nbsp;of amending any doubtful passage. When these drawbacks are&nbsp;considered, it will most likely be felt that the work of reporting is&nbsp;not easy. Yet its importance could not well be overrated. Kc-portiug is the feature in the journalism of to-day which the public&nbsp;could least afford to lose. The editor of a newspaper may influence&nbsp;public opinion, but the reporter furnishes the material for its formation. Fair reporting is indeed a great security for freedom and&nbsp;for moderation. It enables all who can read to see the arguments&nbsp;for and against any proposal; it shows how public bodies discharge their duties ; it indicates the wants and wishes, the hopes&nbsp;and fears of the public ; it puts within easy reach the means of&nbsp;combating wild and foolish propositions, however superficially&nbsp;attractive they may be ; in short, it makes the w׳hole country an&nbsp;open council on all questions affecting the souls and bodies, the&nbsp;education and the government, of the people. It is but fair to add&nbsp;that reporting is done as a rule with great ability and fairness.&nbsp;The reporter rarely carries his likes or his dislikes into his work. He&nbsp;is scrupulously just, and as scrupulously impartial, though it may&nbsp;be that this is not always the opinion of some men who make&nbsp;speeches of which little is seen in the shape of reporting.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">I. Animal Reproduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">§ 1. ASEXUAL REPRODUCTION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">S a general account of this process has already been given (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Biology, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. iii. p. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">686), </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and the details&nbsp;of its occurrence in the various groups are described in the&nbsp;articles devoted to them (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Protozoa, Hydrozoa,&nbsp;Tapeworm, &amp;c.), </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">it suffices here to recall the very broadest&nbsp;aspect of the phenomena,—that asexual reproduction is&nbsp;simply discontinuous growth, and that, as we make an&nbsp;ascending survey of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Metazoa</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, that simple form of&nbsp;discontinuous growth which we term asexual reproduction&nbsp;becomes more and more subordinated to, and at last wholly&nbsp;replaced by, that more differentiated or “sexual” form of&nbsp;reproduction characterized by the union of two heterogeneous cell-elements—never to reappear save in degenerate&nbsp;forms. See Sex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">§ 2. </span><span class="font1">SEXUAL REPRODUCTION.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">In the lowest forms of animal life the process of sexual reproduction is found in its simplest imaginable expression&nbsp;unassociated with any of those complexities which arise&nbsp;among the higher animals and plants. All that is to be&nbsp;observed is the growth of the reproductive organs, the&nbsp;maturation of their products, aud the passive liberation of&nbsp;these,—the fecundation of the ovum and the fate of the&nbsp;embryo being entirely left to the circumstances of the&nbsp;environment. In higher forms, however, not only does&nbsp;this process of maturation become more complex and of&nbsp;far more marked influence over the other functions of the&nbsp;organism, but the attraction of the sexes becomes distinct&nbsp;and leads to new specializations of function and structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Maturation</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The maturation of the sexes acquires, as has been said, increasing definiteness in the higher forms,&nbsp;where it is associated with various characteristic accompaniments. The profound reaction of reproductive maturity&nbsp;upon the wdiole system is best marked in Birds and&nbsp;Mammals, and perhaps most of all in Man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Thus in a young male Bird the circulation in the testes is greatly increased, and these organs increase greatly in&nbsp;size and weight and commence to develop spermatozoa.&nbsp;Meamvhile the “ secondary sexual characters ” of the&nbsp;adult—gayer plumage for alluring the female, or weapons&nbsp;for contest with other males—make their appearance, the&nbsp;voice and note may alter, and a marked increase of&nbsp;strength and courage may appear. Among Mammals the&nbsp;changes are of similar order, the secondary sexual char</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">acters of course differing in detail. The minor changes at puberty in Man associated with the commencement of&nbsp;spermatogenesis are (besides the reflex excitation of erection due to distension of the seminal vesicles, and the&nbsp;more or less periodic expulsion of their contents during&nbsp;sleep) the growth of hair on the pubic region and later on&nbsp;the lower part of the face, and the rapid modification of&nbsp;the laryngeal cartilages and the lengthening of the vocal&nbsp;chords, so rendering the voice harsh and broken during the&nbsp;change and ultimately deepening it by about an octave.&nbsp;The marked strengthening of bones and muscles and the&nbsp;profound psychical changes which accompany the whole&nbsp;series of processes are also familiar. See </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Sex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The local and cellular activity within the ovary, which is the fundamental part of maturation in the female, is&nbsp;not less remarkable than that in the testes. That even in&nbsp;lower Invertebrates the enlargement and escape of the ova&nbsp;are part of a normal cellular rhythm is interestingly shown&nbsp;by their not unfrequent relapse to the amoeboid state, or by&nbsp;the fatty degeneration and death of ova which have not&nbsp;accomplished their destiny. The escape of ripe ova in&nbsp;the Vertebrate ovary is especially remarkable: each Graafian&nbsp;follicle, as it ripens, bursts, expelling its ovum; its cavity&nbsp;contracts; it is filled up by blood, of which the white corpuscles form a ·framewmrk resembling connective tissue, in&nbsp;which the solids and corpuscles of the serum with colour״&nbsp;ing matter derived from the haemoglobin of the latter are&nbsp;retained; and the whole constitutes the “ corpus luteum,”&nbsp;which, should pregnancy occur, may persist and undergo&nbsp;further retrogressive changes, or otherwise gradually disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The direct causes of this process of ovulation have been sometimes ascribed to the congestion of the blood-vessels&nbsp;of the ovary and to its own internal turgidity, or to the&nbsp;existence of a slight contractility of its stroma; it&nbsp;seems, however, rather to depend upon the growth and&nbsp;turgescence of the individual follicle. The question of&nbsp;the relation of ovulation to the process of copulation in&nbsp;the higher animals has also been much discussed. Though&nbsp;we certainly know that ovulation is of regular occurrence&nbsp;whether fecundation takes place or not, it seems that in&nbsp;many cases copulation is speedily followed by the liberation of an ovum; nor is it difficult to see how<sup>7</sup> the profound&nbsp;nervous and circulatory excitement associated with the&nbsp;former process might accelerate the bursting of a follicle.&nbsp;Leopold has conclusively showrn, how<sup>r</sup>ever, that ovulation&nbsp;may also long precede impregnation.</span></p>
