            <p>delivered. But ſhe added, there was a circumſtance to which ſhe had omitted to ſpeak.
                “Your queen (ſaid ſhe) affects in her letter to obſerve, that I am ſubject to the
                laws of England, becauſe I have lived under their protection. This ſentiment and
                mode of thinking are very ſurpriſing to me. I came into England to crave her
                aſſiſtance and aid; and, ever ſince, I have been confined to a priſon. The miſeries
                of captivity cannot be called a protection, and the treatment I have ſuffered is a
                violation of all law.”</p>
            <p>This afflicted but undaunted princeſs, after having thus ſcorned the competency and
                repelled the pretexts of the commiſſioners, was induced at laſt, by arguments under
                the inſidious maſk of candour and friendſhip, to depart from the proper and
                dignified ground which ſhe had taken, and conſent to that mode of the trial which
                had been propoſed. It was repreſented to her by Hatton the vice-chamberlain, that by
                rejecting a trial, ſhe injured her own reputation and intereſts, and deprived
                herſelf of the only opportunity of ſetting her innocence in a clear light to the
                preſent and to future times. Impoſed upon by this artifice, ſhe conſented to make
                her appearance before the judges; at the ſame time, however, ſhe ſtill proteſted
                againſt the juriſdiction of the court, and the validity of all their
                proceedings.</p>
            <p>After various formalities, the lord-chancellor opened the cafe; and was followed by
                Serjeant Gawdry, who proceeded to explain the above ſtatute, and endeavoured to
                demonſtrate that ſhe had offended againſt it. He then entered into a detail of
                Babington’s conſpiracy; and concluded with affirming, “That Mary knew it, had
                approved it, had promiſed her aſſiſtance, and had pointed out the means to effect
                it.” Proofs of this charge were exhibited againſt her, and diſplayed with great art.
                The letters were read which Sir Francis Walſingham had forged, in concert with
                Gifford, &amp;c. and her ſecretaries Naw and Curl. The three ſpies had afforded all
                the neceſſary intelligence about the conſpiracy, upon which to frame a
                correſpondence between Mary and Babington, and upon which diſpatches might be
                fabricated in her name to her foreign friends; and the ciphers were furniſhed by her
                two ſecretaries. @@But beſide theſe pretended letters, another ſpecies of evidence
                was held out againſt her. Babington, proud of the diſpatch lent to him in her name
                by Walſingham and Gifford, returned an anſwer to it; and a reply from her by the
                ſame agency was tranſmitted to him. Deluded, and in toils, he communicated theſe
                marks of her attention to Savage and Ballard, the moſt confidential of his
                aſſociates. His confeſſion and theirs became thus of importance. Nor were her
                letters and the confeſſions of theſe conſpirators deemed ſufficient vouchers of her
                guilt. Her two ſecretaries, therefore, who had lately ſiorſaken her, were engaged to
                ſubſcribe a declaration, that the diſpatches in her name were written by them at her
                command, and according to her inſtructions. Theſe branches of evidence, put together
                with ſkill, and heightened with all the impoſing colours of eloquence, were preſſed
                upon Mary. Though ſhe had been long accuſtomed to the perfidious inhumanity of her
                enemies, her amazement was infinite. She loſt not, however, her coinage; and her
                defence was alike expreſſive of her penetration and magnanimity.</p>
            <p>“The accuſation preferred to my prejudice is a moſt deteſtable calumny. I was not
                engaged with Babington in his conſpiracy; and I am altogether-innocent of having
                plotted the death of Elizabeth. @@The copies of Babington’s letters which have been
                produced, may indeed be taken from originals which are genuine; but it is impoſſible
                to prove that I ever received them. Nor did he receive from me the diſpatches
                addreſſed to him in my name. His confeſſion, and thoſe of his aſſociates, which have
                been urged to eſtabliſh the authority of my letters to him, are imperfect and vain.
                If theſe conſpirators could have teſtified any circumſtances to my hurt, they would
                not ſo ſoon have been deprived of their lives. Tortures, or the fear of the rack,
                extorted improper confeſſions from them; and then they were executed. Their mouths
                were opened to utter falſe criminations; and were immediately ſhut for ever, that
                the truth might be buried in their graves. It was no difficult matter to obtain
                ciphers which I had employed; and my adverſaries are known to be ſuperior to
                ſcruples. I am informed, that Sir Francis Walſingham has been earneſt to recommend
                himſelf to his ſovereign by practices both againſt my life and that of my ſon; and
                the fabrication of papers, by which to effectuate my ruin, is a buſineſs not
                unworthy of his ambition. An evidence, the moſt clear and inconteſtable, is
                neceſſary to overthrow my integrity; but proofs, the moſt feeble and ſuſpicious, are
                held out againſt me. Let one letter be exhibited, written in my hand, or that bears
                my ſuperſcription, and I will inſtantly acknowledge that the charge againſt me is
                ſufficiently ſupported. The declaration of my ſecretaries is the effect of rewards
                or of terror. They are ſtrangers; and to overcome their virtue was an ealy
                atchievement to a queen whoſe power is abſolute, whoſe riches are immenſe, and whoſe
                miniſters are profound and daring in intrigues and treachery. I have often had
                occaſion to iuſpect the integrity of Naw; and Curl, whoſe capacity is more limited,
                was always moſt obſequious to him. They may have written many letters in my name
                without my knowledge, or participation; and it is not fit that I ſhould bear the
                blame of their inconſiderate boldneſs. They may have put many things into diſpatches
                which are prejudicial to Elizabeth; and they may even have ſubſcribed their
                declaration to my prejudice, under the prepoſſeſſion that the guilt which would
                utterly overwhelm them might be pardoned in me. I have never dictated any letter to
                them which can be made to correſpond with their teſtimony. And what, let me aſk,
                would become of the grandeur, the virtue, and the ſafety of princes, if they
                depended upon the writings and declarations of ſecretaries? Nor let it be forgotten,
                that by acting in hoſtility to the duty and allegiance which they ſolemnly ſwore to
                obſerve to me, they have utterly incapacitated themſelves from obtaining any credit.
                The violation of their oath of fidelity is an open perjury; and of ſuch men the
                proteſtations are nothing. But, if they are yet in life, let them be brought before
                me. The matters they declare are ſo important as to require that they ſhould be
                examined in my preſence. It argues not the fairneſs of the proceedings againſt me,
                that this formality is neglected. I am alſo without the aſſiſtance of an advocate;
                and, that I might be defenceleſs and weak in the greateſt degree, I have been robbed
                of my papers and com-</p>
