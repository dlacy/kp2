Not the least improvement has been that in the manufacture of gunpowder. The excellence of our guns and dogs has tended much to spread the love of shooting, which has be- come the most popular and universal of British field sports.</p><p>It has been remarked, that England (Great Britain) is peculiarly the land of sportsmen, the very name being unknown in all other countries. The observation is in a great measure true, for, if we look around the globe, we find that wherever wild animals are killed for the sake of sport, it is mostly by the Englishman. In Sweden the Englishman alone kills the bear for sport. The natives kill it for the sake of reward, or to rid themselves of a noxious neighbour. Their method is generally thus: The strength of the country is summoned <hi rend="italic">en masse,</hi> and several hundreds of people armed, form a circle many miles in circumference, and march forward until they meet in the centre, by which means great numbers of bears, wolves, and lynxes are de- stroyed. But this is not done for sport ; it is a compulsory matter, and the people engaged in it are paid by the <hi rend="italic">government</hi> ; it is a species of feudal duty, which the able- bodied are called upon to perform whenever public safety requires it. In Asia, the only sportsman that encounters the royal tiger is the Englishman; the native shekerrie shoots the tiger for profit. There also the buffalo and the boar are hunted by the Englishman alone. In Africa, it is the Englishman who hunts the lion, the hippopotamus, and the giraffe. And in America, it is the Englishman, or English settler, who hunts the panther, the bison, and the bear, for sport ; the natives do so from necessity. Since, then, the Englishman is the universal sportsman, it behoves the officer, the emigrant, and the tourist, to make themselves acquainted not only with what may be called the first prin- ciples of sporting, but more especially with the sports peculiar to the countries to which they are proceeding, a theoretical knowledge of which may be gleaned from the volumes which annually proceed from the pens of our adventurous countrymen.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Rifle.</hi> The only fire-arms used by the sportsman are the rifle, the musket, and the fowling-piece; the latter may be classified into the swivel-gun, which is fired from a rest, and the shoulder-gun. A short, wide-bored musket, charged with a round or oval iron ball, was formerly used for the destruction of such animals as the lion, tiger, or bear. In modern times, the musket has been superseded by the rifle, and the iron ball by a leaden one, hardened with tin and weighted with quicksilver. A short piece is said to be pre- lerred to a long one for shooting tigers, bears, and the like, as it may be more readily loaded, and is more easily ma- naged in cases of emergency ; indeed we apprehend the shooter should seldom fire, except when the animal is so near to him that if he aim coolly, he can scarcely fail to lodge a ball. We subjoin the method of taking aim at wild beasts from practical sporting writers. Captain Williamson gives the following instructions for shooting tigers :@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> “If the motion of an animal through the grass be perceived, the nearest elephant should be halted ; and its left shoulder being pointed towards the moving object, is the most favourable position for taking a good aim. The hunter should fire without hesitation, observing to proportion his level as far within the space between himself and the tops of the yielding grass as the height of the cover may dictate ; by this precaution, equally necessary when shooting fish that are in any degree beneath the surface of the water, the iron ball will, in general, take effect.” Mr. Lloyd says,@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> “ If a man purposes attacking a bear at close quarters, a double gun is decidedly the best ; if it be in the winter season, a detonator is very preferable. Owing to having flint locks, both my barrels, on one occasion, missed fire, which might have been attended with most serious consequences; a large ball is very desirable. The best points to hit a bear, or any other animal, are in the forehead, in the breast, under the ear, or at the back of the shoulder ; bullets placed in other parts of the body of an old bear usually have little immedi- ate effect. If the snow be deep, and the bear is crossing a man, he should always aim very low ; he must often, indeed, fire into the snow, if he expects to hit the heart of the beast.”</p><p>In 1826 it was found necessary to destroy an elephant in Exeter ’Change. A detachment of foot guards were called in, and directed by surgeons where to fire ; and 152 bullets were fired before it was disabled. This proves how utterly ineffectual the leaden musket ball would be in the forest. Captain Harris, in his South African tour, in 1837, took with him a double-barrelled rifle, carrying balls two ounces weight, and thus armed, no beast could stand before him. Speaking of the forehead of the elephant, he says,@@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> <hi rend="italic">“ A</hi> ball hardened with tin or quicksilver readily penetrates to the brain, and proves instantaneously fatal.” He gives instances of his killing large elephants at a single shot, and seems to have had no difficulty with the “ king of beasts,” which he has slain “ in every stage from whelphood to imbecility.” According to Captain Harris, travelling through countries infested by wild beasts is not so dangerous as it is commonly thought to be. He says, indeed, that during part of his journey, “ scarcely a day passed without our seeing two or three lions, but, like the rest of the animal creation, they uniformly retreated when disturbed by the approach of man. However troublesome we found the intrusions of the feline race during the night, they seldom, at any other time, shewed the least disposition to molest us, unless we commenced hostilities.” He, however, does justice to the terrors of the maned monarch when he says, “ those who have seen the monarch of the forest in crippling captivity only, immured in a cage barely double his own length, with his sinews relaxed by confinement, have seen but the sha- dow of that animal which ‘ clears the desert with his rolling eye.’ ”</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fallow-Deer Shooting.</hi> There are only three kinds of deer in Great Britain ; the red, the fallow, and the roe. The fallow deer, which was the dun deer of the days of Robin Hood, is the common deer of the parks. The positions of a stag at rest when tired at may be reduced to three, for each of which a different aim should be adopted. First, when presenting his side to the shooter, the aim should be low behind the shoulder. Secondly, when standing obliquely from the shoot- cr, the aim should be just under the ear, which is a vital part ; there is too the chance, when this aim is selected, of reaching the brain through the upper or back part of the cheek, or of striking the animal in some other part of the neck, which will generally bring him down or so disable him that he will be readily recovered. It may be observed here, that the quickest mode of dispatching a dog, horse, or any other domestic animal is to shoot them through the neck, just under the ear. Thirdly, when standing or moving directly from the shooter, the aim should be at the back of the head ; thus a chance is secured, should the part aimed at not be struck, of lodging a ball in the neck or spine. When a deer is approaching the shooter, or standing with its head towards him, he should wait until he can have a cross, an oblique, or a driving shot. When a deer is wounded, however slightly, one or more dogs should be instantly slipped. The dogs for this purpose should, as far as practicable, com</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@,</hi> Oriental Field Sports by Captain Thomas Willamson.
