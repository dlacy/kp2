is a nice and delicate perception of pleaſure or pain, beauty or deformity. It is very nearly allied to taſte ; and, as far as it is natural, ſeems to depend upon the organization of the nervous ſyſtem. It is capable, however, of cultivation, and is experienced in a much higher degree in civilized than in ſavage nations, and among persons liberally educated than among boors and illiterate mechanics. The man who has cultivated any of the fine arts has a much quicker and more exquiſite perception of beauty and deformity in the execution of that art, than another of equal or even greater natural powers, who has but caſually inſpected its productions. He who has been long accuſtomed to that decorum of manners which characterizes the polite part of the world, perceives almoſt inſtantaneouſly the ſmalleſt deviation from it, and feels himſelf almoſt as much hurt by behaviour harmleſs in itſelf, as by the groſſeſt rudeneſs ; and the man who has long proceeded ſteadily in the paths of virtue, and often painted to himſelf the deformity of vice, and the miſeries of which it is productive, is more quickly alarmed at any deviation from rectitude, than another who, though his life has been ſtained by no crime, has yet thought leſs upon the principles of virtue and conſequences of vice.</p><p>Every thing which can be called ſenſibility, and is not born with man, may be reſolved into association, and is to be regulated accordingly ; for ſenſibilities may be acquired which are inimical to happineſs and to the practice of virtue. The man is not to be envied who has ſo accuſtomed himſelf to the forms of polite addreſs as to be hurt by the unaffected language and manners of the honeſt peaſant, with whom he may have occasion to tranſact buſineſs ; nor is he likely to acquire much uſeful knowledge who has ſo ſedulouſly ſtudied the beauties of composition as to be unable to read without diſguſt a book of ſcience or of hiſtory, of which the ſtyle comes not up to his ſtandard of perfection. That ſensibility which we either have from nature, or neceſſarily acquire, of the miſeries of others, is of the greateſt uſe when properly regulated, as it powerfully impels us to relieve their diſtreſs ; but if it by any means become ſo exquiſite as to make us ſhun the sight of miſery, it counteracts the end for which it was implanted in our nature, and only deprives us of happineſs, while it contributes nothing to the good of others. Indeed there is reaſon to believe that all ſuch extreme ſenſibilities are ſelfiſh affectations, employed as apologies for withholding From the miſerable that relief which it is in our power</p><p>to give ; for there is not a fact better eſtabliſhed in the ſcience of human nature, than that paſſive perceptions grow gradually weaker by repetition, while active habits daily acquire ſtrength.</p><p>It is of great importance to a literary man to cultivate his taſte, becauſe it is the ſource of much elegant and refined pleaſure, (see T <hi rend="smallcaps">aste)</hi>; but there is a degree of faſtidiouſneſs which renders that pleaſure impoſſible to be obtained, and is the certain indication of expiring letters. It is neccſſary to ſubmit to the artificial rules of politeneſs, for they tend to promote the peace and harmony of ſociety, and are ſometimes a uſeful ſubſtitute for moral virtue ; but he who with respect to them has ſo much ſenſibility as to be diſguſted with all whole manners are not equally poliſhed with his own, is a very troubleſome member of ſociety. It is every man’s duty to cultivate his moral ſenſibilities, ſo as to make them ſubſervient to the purpoſes for which they were given to him ; but if he either feel, or pretend to feel, the miſeries of others to ſo exquiſite a degree as to be unable to afford them the relief which they have a right to expect, his ſenſibilities are of no good tendency.</p><p>That the man of true ſenſibility has more pains and more pleaſures than the callous wretch, is univerſally admitted, as well as that his enjoyments and ſufferings are more exquiſite in their kinds ; and as no man lives for himſelf alone, no man will acknowledge his want of ſenſibility, or expreſs a wiſh that his heart were callous. It is, however, a matter of ſome moment to diſtinguish real ſenſibilities from ridiculous affections ; thoſe which tend to increase the ſum of human happineſs from ſuch as have a contrary tendency, and to cultivate them all in ſuch a manner as to make them anſwer the ends for which they were implanted in us by the beneficent Author of nature. This can be done only by watching over them as over other aſſociations, (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics,</hi> n⁰ 98.); for exceſſive ſenſibility, as it is not the gift of nature, is the bane of human happineſs. “ Too much tenderneſs (as Rouſſeau well obſerves) proves the bitterest curſe inſtead of the moſt fruitful bleſſing ; vexation and disappointment are its certain conſequences. The temperature of the air, the change of the ſeaſons, the brilliancy of the ſun, or thickneſs of the fogs, are ſo many moving ſprings to the unhappy poſſeſſor, and he becomes the wanton ſport of their arbitration.”</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SENSITIVE-plant.</hi> See MIMOSA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dionæa,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Hedysarum.</hi></p><p>The ſenſitive plants are well known to poſſeſs a kind of motion, by which the leaves and ſtalks are contracted and fall down upon being ſlightly touched, or ſhaken with ſome degree of violence.</p><p>The contraction of the leaves and branches of the ſenſitive plant when touched, is a very ſingular phenomenon. Different hypotheſes have been formed by botaniſts in order to explain it ; but we are diſpoſed to believe that theſe have generally been deduced rather from analogical reaſoning than from a collection of facts and obſervations. We ſhall therefore give an account of all the important facts which we have been able to collect upon this curious ſubject ; and then draw ſuch conclusions as obviouſly reſult from them, without, however, attempting to ſupport any old, or to eſtabliſh a new, hypotheſis.</p><p>1.

lapse<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> As the nature of the ſenſitive plant is curious, we wiſh to make the deſcription of it intelhgible to thoſe who are not acquainted with the technical language of botany. We have therefore uſed the word <hi rend="italic">leaf</hi> inſtead of foliolum, or lobe.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a),</hi> the foliola or little leaves moving at their base till they come into contact, and then applying themſelves cloſe together, if the leaf be touched with a little more force, the oppoſite leaf will exhibit the ſame appearance. If a little more force be applied, the partial footſtalks bend down towards the common footſtalk from which they iſſue, making with it a more acute angle than before. If the touch be more violent ſtill, all the leaves ſituated on the ſame side with the one that has been touched will inſtantly collapſe, and the partial footſtalk will approach the common footſtalk to which it is attached, in the ſame manner as the partial footſtalk of the leaf approaches the ſtem or branch from which it iſſues ; ſo that the whole plant, from having its branches extended, will immediately appear like a weeping birch.</p><p>2. Theſe motions of the plant are performed by means of three diſtinct and ſenſible articulations. The firſt, that of the foliola or lobes to the partial footſtalk ; the second, that of the partial footſtalk to the common one ; the third, that of the common footſtalk to the trunk. The primary motion of all which is the cloſing of the leaf upon the partial footſtalk, which is performed in a ſimilar manner, and by a ſimilar articulation. This, however, is much leſs visible than the others. Theſe motions are wholly independent on one another, as may be proved by experiment. It appears that if the partial footſtalks are moved, and collapſe toward the petioli, or theſe toward the trunk, the little leaves, whoſe motion is uſually primary to theſe, ſhould be affected alſo ; yet experiment proves that it is poſſible to touch the footſtalks in ſuch a manner as to affect them only, and make them apply themſelves to the trunk, while the leaves feel nothing of the touch ; but this cannot be, unleſs the footſtalks are ſo diſpoſed as that they can fall to the trunk, without ſuſſering their leaves to touch any part of the plant in their paſſage, becauſe, if they do, they are immediately affected.</p><p>3. Winds and heavy rains make the leaves of the ſenſitive plant contract and cloſe ; but no ſuch effect is produced from flight ſhowers.</p><p>4. At night, or when expoſed to much cold in the day, the leaves meet and cloſe in the ſame manner as when touched, folding their upper ſurfaces together, and in part over each other, like ſcales or tiles, ſo as to expoſe as little as poſſible of the upper ſurface to the air. The oppoſite ſides of the leaves (foliola) do not come cloſe together in the night, for when touched they apply themſelves cloſer together. Dr Darwin kept a ſenſitive plant in a dark place for ſome hours after daybreak ; the leaves and footſtalks were collapſed as in its moſt profound ſleep; and, on expoſing it to the light, above 20 minutes paſſed before it was expanded.</p><p>5. In the month of Auguſt, a ſenſitive plant was carried in a pot out of its uſual place into a dark cave, the motion that it received in the carriage ſhut up its leaves, and they did not open till 24 hours afterwards ; at this time they became moderately open, but were afterwards ſubject to no changes at night or morning, but remained three days and nights with their leaves in the same moderately open ſtate. At the end of this time they were brought out again into the air, and there recovered their natural periodical motions, ſhutting every night, and opening every morning, as naturally and as ſtrongly as if the plant had not been in this forced ſtate ; and while in the cave, it was obſerved to be very little leſs affected with the touch than when abroad in the open air.</p><p>6. The great heats of summer, when there is open ſunſhine at noon, affect the plant in ſome degree like cold, cauſing it to ſhut up its leaves a little, but never in any very great degree. The plant, however, is leaſt of all affected about nine o’clock in the morning, and that is conſequently the propereſt time to make experiments on it. A branch of the ſenſitive plant cut off, and laid by, retains yet its property of ſhutting up and opening in the morning for ſome days ; and it holds it longer if kept with one end in water, than if left to dry more ſuddenly.</p><p>7. The leaves only of the ſenſitive plant ſhut up in the night, not the branches; and if it be touched at this time, the branches are affected in the ſame manner as in the day, ſhutting up, or approaching to the ſtalk or trunk, in the ſame manner, and often with more force. It is of no conſequence what the ſubſtance is with which the plant is touched, it anſwers alike to all ; but there may be obſerved a little ſpot, diſtinguiſhable by its paler colour in the articulations of its leaves, where the greateſt and niceſt ſenſibility is evidently placed.</p><p>8. Duhamel having obſerved, about the 15th of September, in moderate weather, the natural motion of a branch of a ſenſitive plant, remarked, that at nine in the morning it formed with the ſtem an angle of 100 degrees ; at noon, 112 degrees ; at three afternoon, it returned to 100 ; and after touching the branch, the angle was reduced to 90. Three quarters of an hour after it had mounted to 112 ; and, at eight at night, it deſcended again, without being touched, to 90. The day after, in finer weather, the ſame branch, at eight in the morning, made an angle of 135 degrees with the ſtem ; after being touched, the angle was diminiſhed to 80 ; an hour after, it roſe again to 135 ; being touched a ſecond time, it deſcended again to 80 ; an hour and a half after, it had riſen to 145 ; and upon being touched a third time, deſcended to 135 ; and remained in that poſition till five o’clock in the afternoon, when being touched a fourth time it fell to 110.</p><p>9. The parts of the plants which have collapſed afterwards unfold themſelves, and return to their former expanded ſtate. The time required for that purpose varies, according to the vigour of the plant, the ſeaſon of the year, the hour of the day, the ſtate of the atmoſphere. Sometimes half an hour is requisite, ſome- times only ten minutes. The order in which the parts recover themſelves varies in like manner : ſometimes it is the common footſtalk ; ſometimes the rib to which<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0280.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0274"/>
the leaves are attached ; and ſometimes the leaves themſelves are expanded, before the other parts have made any attempt to be reinſtated in their former poſition.</p><p>10. If, without ſhaking the other ſmaller leaves, we cut off the half of a leaf or lobe belonging to the laſt pair, at the extremity or ſummit of a wing, the leaf cut, and its antagoniſt, that is to ſay, the firſt pair, begin to approach each other ; then the ſecond, and ſo on succeſſively, till all the leſſer leaves, or lobes of that wing, have collapſed in like manner. Frequently, after 12 or 15 seconds, the lobes of the other wings, which were not immediately affected by the ſtroke, ſhut; whilſt the ſtalk and its wing, beginning at the bottom, and proceeding in order to the top, gradually recover themſelves. If, inſtead of one of the leſſer extreme leaves, we cut off one belonging to the pair that is next the footſtalk, its antagoniſt ſhuts, as do the other pairs succeſſively, from the bottom to the top. If all the leaves of one side of a wing be cut off, the oppoſite leaves are not affected, but remain expanded. With some addreſs, it is poſſible even to cut off a branch without hurting the leaves, or making them fall. The common footſtalk of the winged leaves being cut as far as three-fourths of its diameter, all the parts which hang down collapſe, but quickly recover without appearing to have ſuffered any conſiderable violence by the ſhock. An inciſion being made into one of the principal branches to the depth of one-half the diameter, the branches ſituated betwixt the lection and the root will fall down ; thoſe above the inciſion remain as before, and the lesser leaves continue open ; but this direction is ſoon deſtroyed, by cutting off one of the lobes at the extremity, as was obſerved above. Laſtly, a whole wing being cut off with precaution near its inſertion into the common footſtalk, the other wings are not affected by it, and its own lobes do not ſhut. No motion enſues from piercing thebranch with a needle or other ſharp inſtrument.</p><p>11. If the end of one of the leaves be burned with the flame of a candle, or by a burning glaſs, or by touching it with hot iron, it cloſes up in a moment, and the oppoſite leaf does the ſame, and after that the whole ſeries of leaves on each side of the partial or little footſtalk ; then the footſtalk itſelf ; then the branch or common footſtalk ; all do the ſame, if the burning has been in a ſufficient degree. This proves that there is a very nice communication between all the parts of the plant, by means of which the burning, which only is applied to the extremity of one leaf, diffuſes its influence through every part of the ſhrub. If a drop of aquafortis be carefully laid upon a leaf of the ſenſitive plant, ſo as not to ſhake it in the leaſt, the leaf does not begin to move till the acrid liquor corrodes the ſubſtance of it ; but at that time, not only that particular leaf, but all the leaves placed on the ſame footſtalk, cloſe themſelves up. The vapour of burning ſulphur has alſo this effect on many leaves at once, according as they are more or leſs expoſed to it ; but, a bottle of very acrid and ſulphureous ſpirit of vitriol, placed under the branches unſtopped, produces no ſuch effect. Wetting the leaves with ſpirit of wine has been obſerved alſo to have no effect, nor the rubbing oil of almonds over them ; though this laſt application deſtroys many plants.</p><p>From the preceding experiments the following con</p><p>clusions maybe fairly drawn : 1. The contraction or the parts of the ſenſitive plant is occaſioned by an external force, and the contraction is in proportion to the force. 2. All bodies which can exert any force affect the ſenſitive plant; ſome by the touch or by agitation, as the wind, rain, &amp; c. ; ſome by chemical influence, as heat and cold. 3. Touching or agitating the plant produces a greater effect than an inciſion or cutting off a part, or by applying heat or cold.</p><p>Attempts have been made to explain theſe curious phenomena. Dr Darwin, in the notes to his admired poem, intitled, <hi rend="italic">The Botanic Garden,</hi> lays it down as a principle, that “ the sleep of animals conſiſts in a ſuſpenſion of voluntary motion ; and as vegetables are ſubject to ſleep as well as animals, there is reaſon to conclude (says he) that the various action of cloſing their petals and foliage may be juſtly aſcribed to a voluntary power ; for without the faculty of volition ſleep would not have been neceſſary to them,” Whether this definition of ſleep when applied to animals be juſt, we ſhall not inquire ; but it is evident the ſuppoſed analogy between the ſleep of animals and the ſleep of plants has led Dr Darwin to admit this aſtoniſhing conclusion, that plants have volition. As volition preſuppoſes a mind or ſoul, it were to be wiſhed that he had given us ſome information concerning the nature of a vegetable ſoul, which can think and will. We ſuſpect, however, that this vegetable ſoul wall turn out to be a mere mechanical or chemical one ; for it is affected by external forces uniformly in the ſame way, its volition is merely paſſive, and never makes any ſucceſsful reſiſtance againſt thoſe cauſes by which it is influenced. All this is a mere abuſe of words. The ſleep of plants is a metaphorical expreſſion, and has not the leaſt reſemblance to the ſleep of animals. Plants are ſaid to ſleep when the flowers or leaves are contracted or folded together ; but we never heard that there is any ſimilar contraction in the body of an animal during ſleep.</p><p>The fibres of vegetables have been compared with the muſcles of animals, and the motions of the ſenſitive plant have been ſuppoſed the ſame with muſcular motion. Between the fibres of vegetables and the muſcles of animals, however, there is not the leaſt ſimilarity. If muſcles be cut through, ſo as to be ſeparated from the joints to which they are attached, their powers are completely deſtroyed ; but this is not the caſe with vegetable fibres. The following very ingenious experiment, which was communicated to us by a reſpectable member of the University of Edinburgh, is deciſive on this ſubject. He ſelected a growing poppy at that period of its growth, before unfolding, when the head and neck are bent down almoſt double. He cut the ſtalk where it was curved half through on the under side, and half through at a ſmall diſtance on the upper fide, and half through in the middle point between the two ſections, ſo that the ends of the fibres were ſeparated from the stalk. Notwithſtanding theſe ſeveral cuttings on the neck, the poppy raised its head, and aſſumed a more erect poſition. There is, therefore, a complete diſtinction between muſcular motion and the motions of a plant, for no motion can take place in the limb of an animal when the muſcles of that limb are cut.</p><p>In fine, we look upon all attempts to explain the motions of plants as abſurd, and all reaſoning from ſuppoſed analogy between animals and vegetables as the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0281.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0275"/>
ſource of wild conjecture, and not of sound philosophy. We view the contraction and expanſion of the ſenſitive plant in the ſame light as we do gravitation, chemical attraction, electricity, and magnetiſm, as a singular fact, the circumſtances of which we may be fully acquainted with, but muſt deſpair of underſtanding its cauſe.</p><p>What has been ſaid under this article chiefly refers to the <hi rend="italic">mimoſa ſenfitiva</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pudica.</hi> For a full account of the motions of vegetables in general, ſee <hi rend="italic">Vegetable Motion,</hi> under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Motion.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
