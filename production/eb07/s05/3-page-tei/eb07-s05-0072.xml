The criminal’s hands being tied behind him, he is hoisted up with a rope to the top of a long piece of wood, and again let fall almost to the ground; so that, by the weight of his body in the shock, his arms are dislocated. Sometimes he has to undergo three strapadoes or more.STRASBOURG, an arrondissement of the department of the Lower Rhine, in France. It is a rich district, extending over 523 square miles, is divided into 12 cantons, and these into 162 communes, with a population of 218,839 persons. The chief city, of the same name, is also the capital of the department. It is the see of a bishop, the seat of the Lutheran consistory, and of the courts of law. The city stands in a highly cultivated plain, at the distance of about one mile from the river Rhine, on the river Ill, a small but navigable river. Its waters are distributed in various small canals through the city, and connect it with the Rhine. The streets are narrow, and the buildings for the most part old and massive, many of them very lofty. Strasburg is strongly fortified, and defended by three powerful fortresses and a strong citadel. Even in the time of peace it usually contains a garrison of 10,000. The cathedral, one of the finest Gothic buildings in France, was begun in 1275 and finished in 1439. Its tower is a most imposing object, 445 feet in height, being the loftiest erection known except the largest of the Egyptian pyramids. Besides six Catholic, there are seven Lutheran, and one Calvinist church. The other public buildings are the royal palace, the prefecture, the town-hall, the mint, and two theatres. Strasburg is the seat of a university. The population, which in 1836 amounted to 7885, is chiefly of German origin, and most of the people speak that language. The industry of the inhabitants is much exercised in making sail-cloth and other linen goods, woollens of various kinds, and in spinning and weaving cottons. There are tanneries, distilleries, founderies, paper-mills, and glass-houses ; and considerable trade is carried on with Switzerland on one side, and with Germany and Holland on the other.

The ancients dealt very much in stratagems, the moderns wage war more openly. Polyænus and Frontinus, the former a Greek, the latter a Latin writer, have each left a treatise on stratagems of war.STRATEGUS, <hi rend="italic">ςϑατηγος</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">Antiquity,</hi> an officer among the Athenians, whereof there were turn chosen yearly, to command the troops of the state. Plutarch avers there was one chosen from each tribe ; but Pollux seems to say they were chosen indifferently from the people. The people themselves made the choice, on the last day of the year, in a place called <hi rend="italic">Pnyx.</hi> The two <hi rend="italic">strategi</hi> did not command together, but took their turns day by day, as we find from Herodotus and Cornelius Nepos. Constantine the Great, besides many other privileges granted to the city of Athens, honoured its chief magistrate with the title of M<hi rend="italic">εγας</hi> ∑<hi rend="italic">ετϐατηγος</hi>, or the Great General.STRATFORD, sometimes distinguished by the name <hi rend="italic">Long Stratford,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Stratford le Bow.</hi> It is the first town in the county of Essex, on the road from London, and, being connected with Middlesex by a bridge, said to be the oldest in England, over the river Lea, may be considered a suburb of the metropolis. It is in the hundred of Beacontree, and within the parish of West Ham. The soil is rich, but marshy, and intersected with canals and streams. Like the other suburbs of London, it has much increased</p><p>in population, as well as industrious pursuits. The East India Docks are within the parish. One of the pursuits in this place is that of practical chemistry, on a large scale, for making magnesia, the volatile salts, Prussian blue, and other preparations. There are, besides, bleachers, calico- printers, brewers, distillers, and millers. The parish of West Ham is divided into four parts, but the division of Stratford is by very far the largest, though not distinguished in the decennial population returns. The number of souls in the parish of West Ham amounted in 1801 to 6485, in 1811 to 8136, in 1821 to 9753, and in 1831 to 11,580.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stratford, </hi><hi rend="italic">Fenny,</hi> a market-town in the county of Buckingham, seven miles from Stony Stratford, and forty-six from London. It is in the hundred of Newport, and is a chapelry of the parish of Blechley. Being on the great road from London to the north of England, and to Scotland, as well as to Ireland, this place chiefly depends on the money spent by travellers. It consists of one long street, on a rising ground, with the river Lofield in the bottom. There is a chapel of ease, dedicated to St Martin. The mother-church at Blechley, a mile and a half distant, is an elegant structure. There was formerly some employment in making lace, which has of late declined; but there is some trade by the Grand Junction Canal, and more is expected when the railway from London to Birmingham is completed. The population amounted in 1801 to 469, in 1811 to 481, in 1821 to 521, and in 1831 to 635, but in the whole parish to 1254.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stratford, </hi><hi rend="italic">Stony,</hi> a market-town in the hundred of Newport and county of Buckingham, fifty-two miles from London. It stands on the Ouse, which divides it from Northamptonshire, and is on the Roman or Watling Street road. It is partly in the parish of Calderton, and partly in that of Wolverton, and had a church, or rather a chapel of ease, to each of these parishes, both of which were burnt in 1742 ; but a new one has been erected, and is a handsome structure, dedicated to St Giles. The town consists of one street, nearly a mile in length, with well-built houses on each side, mostly constructed of freestone. It has a good market on Friday, and but little trade on other days, as may be inferred from the state of its population, which amounted in 1801 to 1653, in 1811 to 1488, in 1821 to 1499, and in 1831 to 1619.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stratford-on-Avon,</hi> a town in the hundred of Bar- lichway and county of Warwick, ninety-four miles from London. It stands on the navigable river Avon, over which is a bridge of fourteen arches. It is moderately well built, and has some trade in corn and malt, but no manufactures. It is chiefly remarkable as the birth-place of Shakspeare, whose memory has here been celebrated by splendid pageants. In the guild-hall is a large room, called Shak- speare’s, with a portrait of him and of the celebrated actor Garrick. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2418, in 1811 to 2842, in 1821 to 3069, and in 1831 to 3488.</p><p>STRATH, in the Scotish language, signifies a long narrow valley, along the centre of a river.</p><p>STRATHAVEN, a town in Lanarkshire, Scotland, sixteen miles from Glasgow. It is pleasantly situated at the end of a ridge of small eminences, on the banks of the Pomilion, which runs through it, and divides it into two parts. The original part of the town is old, as is shown by its being erected into a borough of barony in the year 1450, and is most irregularly built, the streets being crowded together, and intersected by long narrow lanes. The modern part is well laid out, and in it are many excellent houses. A number of neat small villas has also been erected in the neighbourhood, by the wealthier burgesses. The old castle of Strathaven overhangs the town, and, though now in ruins, adds considerably to its beauty. The inhabitants are an industrious, enterprising class of individuals ; and from their business habits they are yearly</p></body></text></TEI>
