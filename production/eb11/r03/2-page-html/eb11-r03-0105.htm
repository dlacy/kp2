<p><span class="font0">wide joints filled with small gravel grouted with cement; but this is mischievous. The cement breaks up, and when the&nbsp;blocks shrink, the filling-in is driven downwards, and when&nbsp;they again get wet, they have less room to expand, the side&nbsp;kerbs are driven back, and the foot-pavements are displaced,&nbsp;so as to require relaying. To guard against this, a space of&nbsp;about 2 in. has been left between the pavement and the kerb,&nbsp;to be temporarily filled with clay or sand, which can be cleared&nbsp;out as the pavement expands. But cement has no affinity&nbsp;for wood, and its use, together with the wide joints that were&nbsp;thought necessary to give foothold, has been abandoned.&nbsp;They permitted the edge of the block to be beaten down below&nbsp;the centre, so as to produce a succession of ridges, having much&nbsp;of the character of a “ corduroy ” road. Asphalted felt placed&nbsp;in the joints has not succeeded. A method very successfully&nbsp;adopted is to leave the end joints slightly open, and to place&nbsp;strips or laths one-tenth of an inch thick between the courses,&nbsp;so that hot pitch can be poured down to fill the joint and cover&nbsp;the surface. The roadway is then strewn with fine sharp gravel.&nbsp;Hard-wood blocks so laid expand very slightly, so that a space&nbsp;of an inch and a quarter is sufficient between the kerb and&nbsp;the two courses of blocks that are usually laid parallel to it;&nbsp;this, when filled with pitch, is more than enough to allow for&nbsp;expansion. Paving has been laid with close joints, small&nbsp;vessels of hot pitch being provided, into which each paviour&nbsp;dips the blocks more or less completely before laying them;&nbsp;but wood blocks are more commonly laid dry, a little pitch&nbsp;being brushed over the surface. The gradual abandonment of&nbsp;the wide joints once considered necessary for foothold will be&nbsp;noticed. Soft wood seems to wear under very heavy traffic&nbsp;about five times as fast as hard wood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plank Roads.—</span><span class="font0">In opening up a new country, roads, temporary or permanent, must be made with such materials as may&nbsp;happen to be at hand. The plank road often used in American&nbsp;forests makes an excellent track for all kinds of traffic.&nbsp;Upon that side of the space devoted to the road, which the&nbsp;heavy traffic leading to a town will use, two parallel rows of&nbsp;sills 15 to 20 ft. long, 12 in. wide and 4 deep are laid longitudinally flatwise 4 ft. from centre to centre, the earth being&nbsp;well packed and rammed to the level of their faces. The joints&nbsp;are not opposite; a short piece of sill is put either under or&nbsp;by the side of each joint. Cross-boards about 8 ft. 3 in. long&nbsp;and 3 in. thick are laid down loosely, so that groups of four&nbsp;boards together will project on alternate sides of the road&nbsp;3 or 4 in., forming a shoulder to enable vehicles to get on to&nbsp;the track at any point. The remainder of the road space is&nbsp;formed as an earthen track, 12 ft. wide, for light vehicles.&nbsp;Its slope outwards may be 1 in 16, that of the plank road 1&nbsp;in 32. If the soil is too bad for the earthen track, short lengths&nbsp;of plank road of double width are made at intervals to form&nbsp;passing places. The cross boards are spiked down on five&nbsp;sills, and are sprung so as to give a fall both ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Log Roads.—</span><span class="font0">The log road is formed across swamps by laying young trees of similar length close together. This is&nbsp;ridiculed as a “ corduroy ” road, but it is better than the&nbsp;swamp. Good temporary roads may be made by laying&nbsp;down half logs roughly squared upon the ground, close&nbsp;together or with spaces between of a couple of inches, into&nbsp;which earth is well rammed. They may be 8 or 9 ft. long,&nbsp;alternate logs being made to project a foot on each side for&nbsp;convenience of driving on and off the track..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Charcoal Roads.—</span><span class="font0">When fuel is available, good roads can be formed of burned materials. Clay is burned into ballast for&nbsp;foundations, or for a temporary track. In American forests&nbsp;charcoal roads have been largely used. Logs from 6 in. to&nbsp;2 ft. in diameter are piled along the whole route, the&nbsp;stack being 9 ft. broad at the base, 6 ft. high and 2 ft.&nbsp;broad at the top. Dry materials for lighting are intermixed,&nbsp;and the stack is covered up with sods and earth from the side&nbsp;ditches. When burned, the charcoal is simply raked down so&nbsp;as to form a 15-ft. road of a well-rounded section. These roads&nbsp;are dry and hard, and otherwise satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mode of carrying a road across a bog upon a foundation of faggots or brushwood is well known. In India the native&nbsp;roads have been made equal to heavy traffic by laying branches&nbsp;of the mimosa across the track. And in the great plains, where&nbsp;the soil, when dry, would otherwise be made deep in dust, this&nbsp;is entirely prevented by laying across the track a coarse reed&nbsp;or grass like the pampas-grass, and covering it with 3 or 4 in.&nbsp;of loam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sand Dressing.—</span><span class="font0">In carrying traffic over a clay soil a covering of 3 or 4 in. of coarse sand will entirely prevent the formation&nbsp;of the ruts which would otherwise be cut by the wheels; and&nbsp;if the ground has already been deeply cut up, a dressing of&nbsp;sand will so alter the condition of the day that the ridges will&nbsp;be reduced by the traffic, and the ruts filled in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Noiseless Roads.—A</span><span class="font0"> comparatively noiseless pavement may be formed with bricks made of cork granulated and mixed with&nbsp;fibre and asphalt; they are set in pitch, and seem to be suitable for rather steep gradients. For a perfectly noiseless&nbsp;pavement, such as is specially required where a carriage entrance&nbsp;under bedrooms is used by night, no substance is equal to&nbsp;indiarubber. For this purpose it is made in inch sheets about&nbsp;3 ft. wide and as long as the width of the roadway; it is fixed&nbsp;over concrete and secured by iron clips. This arrangement&nbsp;carries the whole of the passenger traffic to St Pancras Station,&nbsp;London, and also a considerable amount of traffic passing under&nbsp;the Euston Square Station Hotel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dustless Roads.—</span><span class="font0">The necessity for making roads dustless has been rendered urgent by the advent 6f the motor-car.&nbsp;The oldest and least efficacious method is to convert the dust&nbsp;into mud by the aid of the watering cart; at the best, however,&nbsp;the improvement is temporary, though attempts have been&nbsp;made to obtain more lasting results by using a solution of some&nbsp;hygroscopic salt such as calcium chloride. Various special&nbsp;preparations of petroleum and other oils have been introduced&nbsp;as palliatives, but the most promising treatment for existing&nbsp;macadam roads consists in distributing tar by hand or machine&nbsp;over the surface, care being taken to make the application in&nbsp;fine weather when the roads are dry. The radical solution of&nbsp;the problem, however, is to be sought in the adoption of&nbsp;improved methods and materials for construction, probably&nbsp;with a bituminous binding or matrix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This same problem of the motor-car, which, by its rapidity of movement, rendered many of the old country roads in&nbsp;England (suitable, or at least tolerable, as they were for slow-moving traffic) positively dangerous for the new traffic by&nbsp;reason of their narrowness, sharp corners, &amp;c., has been responsible for the passing by the legislature of a very important&nbsp;measure, the Development and Road Improvement Funds&nbsp;Act 1909. This act, in its second part, deals with the question&nbsp;of road improvement, and establishes a Road Board, making&nbsp;it a body corporate. The Board is given powers to make&nbsp;advances to county councils or other highway authorities for&nbsp;the construction of new roads or the improvement of existing&nbsp;roads, as well as itself to construct and maintain new roads.&nbsp;The expression “ improvement of roads ” is defined by the&nbsp;act as including the widening of a road, the cutting off corners,&nbsp;levelling, treating a road for mitigating dust nuisance, &amp;c*&nbsp;Power is given to the Board to acquire land for the purposes&nbsp;of road improvements. The expenses of the Board are met&nbsp;out of a road improvement grant each year, the greater part of&nbsp;which it was proposed should be provided by diverting the&nbsp;tax on motor spirit and on motor vehicles levied under the&nbsp;Finance Act of 1909-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Watering.</span><span class="font1">—On macadamized roads in Great Britain watering is only good for the road itself when the materials are of a very sili-cious nature and in dry weather. With other materials the effect&nbsp;is to soften the road and increase wear. In and near towns watering is required for the comfort of the inhabitants, but it should&nbsp;not be more than enough to lay the dust without softening the&nbsp;road, and the amount required for this may be greatly reduced by&nbsp;keeping the surface free from mud, and by sweeping off the dust&nbsp;when slightly wetted. Pavements are watered to cleanse them as&nbsp;well as to lay the dust, but it must be remembered that both wood</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
