<p><span class="font1">He publicly ridiculed the exerciſe and evolutions of the Ruffian troops ; and haſtily adopting the Pruſſian diſcipline, without digeſting and fitting it for the conſtitution of his own forces, he completely ruined himſelf&nbsp;by diſguſting the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What he loſt was ſoon and eaſily gained by the emiſſaries of Catharine. Four regiments of guards, amounting to </span><span class="font3">8ooo </span><span class="font1">men, were inſtantly brought over by the three brothers Orloff, who had contrived to ingratiate&nbsp;themſelves with their officers. The people at large were&nbsp;in a ſtate of indifference, out of which they were rouſed&nbsp;by the following means. A little manuſcript was hand</span><span class="font3">ed </span><span class="font1">about, containing principles of legiſlation for Ruſſia,&nbsp;founded on natural rights, and on the claims of the&nbsp;different claſſes of people which had inſenfibly been&nbsp;formed, and become ſo familiar as to appear natural.&nbsp;In that performance was propoſed a convention of deputies ſrom all thc claſſes, and from every part of the&nbsp;empire, to converſe, but without authority, on the ſubjects of which it treated, and to inform the ſenate of&nbsp;thc reſult of their deliberations. It paſſed for the work&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">of </span><span class="font1">her majeſty and was much admired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While Catharine was thus high in the public eſteem and affection, the emperor took the alarm at her popularity, and in a few days came to the reſolution of confining her for life, and then of marrying his favourite.&nbsp;The ſervants of that favourite betrayed her to her filter,&nbsp;who imparted the intelligence to the empreſs. Catherine ſaw her danger, and inſtantly formed her reſolution.&nbsp;She muſt either tamely ſubmit to perpetual impriſonment, and perhaps a cruel and ignominious death, or&nbsp;contrive to hurl her huſhand from his throne. No other&nbsp;alternative was left her ; and the conſequence was what&nbsp;undoubtedly was expected. The proper ſteps were taken ; folly fell before abilities and addreſs, and in three&nbsp;days the revolution was accompliſhed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the emperor ſaw that all was loſt, he attempted to enter Cronſtadt ſrom Oranienbaum, a town on the gulph of Finland, 39 verſts, or near 26 miles from&nbsp;Peterſburgh. The ſentinels at the harbour preſented&nbsp;their muſkets at the barge ; and though they were not&nbsp;loaded, and the men had no cartridges, he drew back.&nbsp;The Engliſh ſailors called from ſhip to ſhip for ſome&nbsp;perſon to head them, declaring that they would take&nbsp;him in and defend him ; but he precipitately withdrew.&nbsp;Munich received him again at Oranienbaum, and exhorted him to mount his horſe and head his guards,&nbsp;ſwearing to live and die with him. He ſaid, “ No : I&nbsp;ſee it cannot be done without ſhedding much of the&nbsp;blood of my brave Holſteinians. I am not worthy of&nbsp;the ſacrifice.” The revolution was ſettled, and Catharine declared </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">autocratrix.</span><span class="font1"> The crown was ſaid to be&nbsp;preſſed upon her, and her </span><span class="font3">ſon </span><span class="font1">was proclaimed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">her</span><span class="font1"> heir,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ſuch</span><span class="font3"> great duke of all the Ruſſias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">She behaved with magnanimity and moderation ; retained Munich; even pardoned counteſs Vorontzoſſ the emperor’s favourite ; and afterwards, on her marriage&nbsp;with Mr Raulotſky, made a handſome· ſettlement on&nbsp;them. She allowed the expectations of golden days and&nbsp;a philoſophical government to become the ſubject of&nbsp;faſhionable conversation ; and the princeſs Daſhkoff@@(c)&nbsp;was completely happy. The convention of deputies&nbsp;was even reſolved on; and as they were not to be&nbsp;elected by the people, except here and there for the&nbsp;ſhow, Prince Galitzin and Count Panin, whom ſhe had&nbsp;completely gained over, and who had the greateſt abilities of any Ruſſians about court, were at immenſe pains&nbsp;in appointing a proper ſet. In the mean time, a great&nbsp;number of ſhowy patriotic projects were begun. A&nbsp;grave Engliſh clergyman was invited over to ſuperintend the inſtitution of ſchools for civil and moral education; and the empreſs was moſt liberal in her appointments. This inſtitution failed, however, to produce&nbsp;the effects expected from it. The clergyman appointed, though a moſt excellent character and real philan-thropiſt, had views too contracted for the ſphere in&nbsp;which he was placed ; and Mr Betſkoy, the Ruffian&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mecaenas,</span><span class="font1"> to whom the empreſs referred him for inſtructions, preferred déclamation, and ſtage-playing, and ballets, to all other accompliſhments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, elegance of all kinds was introduced before the people were taught the principles of morals. The nobles were ſent a travelling ; and as the&nbsp;Ruſſians more eaſily acquire foreign languages than the&nbsp;people of moſt other nations, have great vivacity without flippancy, and in general underſtand play, theſe travellers were everywhere well received, eſpecially at Paris, where reaſons of ſtate contributed not a little to&nbsp;procure to them that attention with which they were&nbsp;treated. They were raviſhed with the manners of foreign courts, and imported faſhions and fineries without&nbsp;bounds. The ſovereign turned all this to her own account, by encouraging a diſſipation which rendered court&nbsp;favours neceſſary, and made the people about her forget&nbsp;their Utopian dreams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The convention of deputies at laſt aſſembled </span><span class="font3">in </span><span class="font1">the capital. The empreſs’s book of inſtructions @@(d) came&nbsp;forth; and by ſome great things were doubtleſs expected. The moſt conſequential of the deputies were privately inſtructed to be very cautious, and informed that&nbsp;carriages and guards were ready for Siberia. There&nbsp;was a grand proceſſion at their preſentation. Each had&nbsp;the honour of kiſſing her majeſty’s hand and receiving&nbsp;a gold medal. They met in </span><span class="font3">form </span><span class="font1">to recogniſe one an-</span></p><div>

She might have taken part with the emperor, and directed the&nbsp;counſels of the empire ; for her ſiſter, on whom he doated, acknowledged her ſuperiority, and wanted nothing&nbsp; but pleaſure. Between them they could eaſily have governed ſuch a man as Peter III. but Catharine Romanovna was a theoretical enthufiaſt, who loved the empreſs becauſe ſhe thought her a philoſopher and philanthropiſt ; and perhaps ſhe might entertain hopes of directing the conduct of Catharine II. as ſhe had formerly aſſiſted&nbsp;her in her patriotic ſtudies.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font3">@@@(d) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is intitled, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inſtructions for the Deputies to conſult about a New Code of Laws,</span><span class="font3"> &amp;c. and is a very re</span><span class="font2">ſ</span><span class="font3">pectable work, which does honour to the empreſs, by whom it was undoubtedly compoſed.</span></h2></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
