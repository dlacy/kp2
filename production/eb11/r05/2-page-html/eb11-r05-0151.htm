<p><span class="font0">diplomatically the projected crusade. His foreign tour, during which he visited Germany, Holland, England, France and Austria, lasted nearly a year and a half, and was suddenly&nbsp;interrupted, when on his way from Vienna to Venice to study&nbsp;the construction of war-galleys, by the alarming news that the&nbsp;turbulent </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stryeltsi</span><span class="font0"> of Moscow had mutinied anew with the&nbsp;intention of placing Sophia on the throne. On arriving in&nbsp;Moscow he found that the mutiny had been suppressed and&nbsp;the ringleaders punished, but he considered it necessary to&nbsp;reopen the investigation and act with exemplary severity.&nbsp;Of the surviving mutineers over twelve hundred were executed,&nbsp;some of them by his own hand, and the entire corps was disbanded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this moment may be dated the personal reign of Peter, for he now began to direct personally all branches of the administration, and governed with indefatigable vigour for twenty-seven&nbsp;years, during which he greatly increased the area and profoundly&nbsp;modified the internal condition of his country. At first he&nbsp;concentrated his attention on foreign affairs. During his&nbsp;foreign tour he had discovered that the idea of a grand crusade&nbsp;against the infidel was irrealizable, for France was, according&nbsp;to her traditional policy,-the ally of the sultan, Austria wished to&nbsp;avoid trouble on her eastern frontier in order to devote her&nbsp;energies to the question of the Spanish succession, and all the&nbsp;other countries which he wished to draw into the coalition had&nbsp;good reasons of their own for desiring the maintenance of peace&nbsp;in eastern Europe. For his Baltic schemes, on the contrary,&nbsp;he had found the ground well prepared. During a halt of a few&nbsp;days in Poland on his way back from Vienna, King Augustus&nbsp;had explained to him a project for partitioning the trans-Baltic provinces of Sweden, by which Poland should recover&nbsp;Livonia and annex Esthonia, Russia should obtain Ingria&nbsp;and Karelia, and Denmark should take possession of Holstein.&nbsp;As Sweden was known to be exhausted by the long wars of&nbsp;Gustavus Adolphus and his successors, and weakened by internal&nbsp;dissensions, the dismemberment seemed an easy matter, and&nbsp;Peter embarked on the scheme with a light heart; but his&nbsp;illusions were quickly dispelled by the eccentric young Swedish&nbsp;king, Charles XII., who arrived suddenly in Esthonia and&nbsp;completely routed the Russian army before Narva. Thus&nbsp;began the so-called Northern War, which lasted intermittently&nbsp;for more than twenty years, and was terminated by the treaty&nbsp;of Nystad (Sept, io, 1721). By that treaty Peter acquired&nbsp;not only Ingria and Karelia, as originally contemplated, but&nbsp;also Livonia, Esthonia and part of Finland. The problem of&nbsp;obtaining a firm footing on the Baltic coast, on which Ivan&nbsp;the Terrible had squandered his resources to no purpose, was&nbsp;now solved satisfactorily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Peter’s other favourite scheme, that of acquiring the command of the Black Sea, was as far from realization as ever. In the midst of the Northern War, shortly after the great&nbsp;Russian victory of Poltava (1709), the sultan, at the instigation&nbsp;of Swedish and French agents, determined to recover Azov,&nbsp;and made great military preparations for that purpose. Having&nbsp;annihilated at Poltava the army of Charles XII., Peter was not&nbsp;at all indisposed to renew the struggle with Turkey, and began&nbsp;the campaign in the confident hope of making extensive conquests; but he had only got as far as the Pruth when he found&nbsp;himself surrounded by a great Turkish army, and, in order to&nbsp;extricate himself from his critical position, he had to sign a&nbsp;humiliating treaty by which Azov and other conquests were&nbsp;restored to the sultan. His dreams of freeing the Christians&nbsp;from the yoke of the infidel had to be abandoned, and the&nbsp;conquest of the northern shores of the Black Sea was postponed&nbsp;till the reign of Catherine II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Those tedious and exhausting wars did not prevent Peter from attending to internal affairs, and he displayed as a reformer&nbsp;even more vigour and tenacity than as a general in&nbsp;the field. His first reforms were connected with the&nbsp;army. Several of his immediate predecessors had come&nbsp;to recognize that Russia, with her antiquated military organization, was unable to cope with her Western neighbours, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">had begun to organize, with the help of foreigners, a military force more in accordance with modern requirements; but the&nbsp;progress made in that direction bad been slow and unsatisfactory. Unlike his predecessors, Peter was in a hurry to&nbsp;realize his plans, and he set to work at once. In less than two&nbsp;years from the time of disbanding the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stryeltsi</span><span class="font0"> he contrived to&nbsp;create an army of 40,000 men. This army, it is true, was&nbsp;so inefficient that it was completely routed by the Swedish&nbsp;king with a most inferior force, but it was improved gradually&nbsp;until it learned to conquer its Swedish opponents. To accomplish such a feat it was necessary, of course, to expend large&nbsp;sums of money; and as the country could ill bear an increase&nbsp;of taxation, the whole financial system had to be improved&nbsp;and the natural resources of the country had to be developed.&nbsp;At the same time the military and financial requirements&nbsp;dislocated the local and central administration, and consequently a series of radical administrative reforms had to be&nbsp;undertaken. Thus one reform led to another; but Peter&nbsp;was not dismayed by the magnitude of the task, and worked&nbsp;vigorously in all departments with a sublime disregard for the&nbsp;clamour of reactionary opponents and for the feelings and&nbsp;prejudices of his subjects in general. A prudent ruler in his&nbsp;position would have sought to preserve the outward forms&nbsp;while changing the inner substance, but Peter was ncjt at all&nbsp;prudent in that sense. Very often he wantonly provoked&nbsp;opposition, as when he shaved off his beard and compelled&nbsp;his chief officials to do likewise, though he well knew that the&nbsp;operation was regarded by the ignorant masses and the pious&nbsp;of all ranks as a sinful defacing of the image of God. In his&nbsp;eyes the beard was a symbol of the old regime, and as such it&nbsp;must be removed. Reckless of consequences, he swept away&nbsp;the venerated ceremonial formalities which his ancestors bad&nbsp;scrupulously observed, openly scoffed at ancient usage, habitually dressed in foreign costume, and generally chose foreign&nbsp;heretics as his boon companions. In adopting foreign innovations, he showed, like the Japanese of the present day, no&nbsp;sentimental preference for any particular nation, and was&nbsp;ready to borrow from the Germans, Dutch, English, Swedes&nbsp;or French whatever seemed best suited for his purpose. The&nbsp;innovations, it must be admitted, did not prove so efficient&nbsp;as he expected, because human nature and traditional habits&nbsp;cannot be changed as quickly as institutions. When the&nbsp;Boyar Duma became the Senate, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prikazi</span><span class="font0"> or administrative departments were organized under the name of Colleges,&nbsp;and when every important town was endowed with a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rathhaus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polizeimeister,</span><span class="font0"> gilds, aldermen, and all the municipal paraphernalia of western Europe, the vices of the old institutions&nbsp;survived in the new. Notwithstanding the changes in organization and terminology, the officials remained ignorant, indolent,&nbsp;careless, indifferent to the public welfare, high-handed and&nbsp;extortionate, and the local self-government which was intended&nbsp;to enlighten and control them proved sadly wanting in vitality&nbsp;and practically worthless. So inefficient, indeed, were the&nbsp;reforms as a whole, and so unsuited to the national character&nbsp;and customs, that the Slavophil critics of a later date could&nbsp;maintain plausibly the paradoxical thesis that in regard to&nbsp;internal administration Peter was anything but a national&nbsp;benefactor. However that may be, it must be confessed even&nbsp;by Slavophils that he dragged his countrymen, more by force&nbsp;than by persuasion, from the paths of traditional routine and&nbsp;pushed them along with all his might on the broad road of&nbsp;progress in the modern sense of the term. Abandoning the&nbsp;ancient Muscovite capital, where many influential personages&nbsp;were fanatically hostile to his innovations and not a few of the&nbsp;superstitious inhabitants regarded him with horror as Antichrist, he built at the mouth of the Neva a new capital which&nbsp;was to serve as “ a window through which his people&nbsp;might look into Europe ”; and laying aside the national&nbsp;title of tsar he proclaimed himself (1711) emperor&nbsp;(Imperator) of all Russia—much to the surprise and&nbsp;indignation of foreign diplomatic chancelleries, which resented&nbsp;the audacity of a semi-barbarous potentate in claiming to be</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
