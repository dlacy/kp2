The whole space occupied does not exceed 1400 ft. in length by about half as much in breadth. Besides sea-fowl the only land creatures are insects and spiders. Fish are abundant, seven species (one, <hi rend="italic">Holocentrum sancti pauli,</hi> peculiar to the locality) being collected by the “ Challenger ” during a brief stay.
