is a Saxon word ſignifying a diviſion ; but a county, <hi rend="italic">comitatus,</hi> of the ſame import, is plainly derived from comes, " the count of the Franks ;” that is, the earl or alderman (as the Saxons called him) of the ſhire, to whom the government of it was entruſted. This he uſually exerciſed by his deputy, ſtill called in Latin <hi rend="italic">vice-comes,</hi> and in Engliſh the <hi rend="italic">ſheriff, shrieve, or shire reeve,</hi> ſignifying the “ officer of the ſhire ;” upon whom, in proceſs of time, the civil adminiſtration of it totally devolved. In ſome counties there is an intermediate diviſion between the ſhire and the hundred ; as lathes in Kent and rapes in Suſſex, each of them containing about three or four hundreds apiece. Theſe had formerly their lathe-reeves and rape-rceves, acting in ſubordination to the ſhire-reeve. Where a county is divided into three of theſe intermediate juriſdictions, they are called <hi rend="italic">trithings,</hi> which were anciently governed by a trithing reeve. Theſe trithings ſtill ſubſiſt in the large county of York, where, by an eaſy corruption, they are denominated <hi rend="italic">ridings ;</hi> the north, the eaſt, and the west riding.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
