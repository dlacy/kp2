<p><span class="font0">(753) Iconoclasm was supported by the army (t.e. Asia Minor), and a considerable portion of the episcopate, but it was not&nbsp;destined to triumph. When the Athenian Irene, wife of Leo IV.,&nbsp;came to power after her husband’s death, as regent for her son&nbsp;Copstantine VI., she secured the restoration of the worship&nbsp;of icons. The Iconoclastic Council was reversed by the 7th Ecumenical Council of 787. The iconoclastic party, however, was&nbsp;not yet defeated, and (after the neutral reign of Nicephorus I.)&nbsp;came again to the helm in the reigns of the Armenian Leo V.&nbsp;and the first two Phrygian emperors, Michael II. and Theophilus.&nbsp;But the Empire was weary of the struggle, and on the death of&nbsp;Theophilus, who had been rigorous in enforcing his policy, icon-worship was finally restored by his widow Theodora (843), and&nbsp;the question was never reopened. This was a triumph for the&nbsp;Greek element in the Empire; the “ Sunday of orthodoxy ” on&nbsp;which iconoclasm was formally condemned is still a great day&nbsp;in the Greek Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ablest champions who wielded their pens for the cause of icons, defending by theological arguments practices which&nbsp;really had their roots in polytheism, were in the early stage John&nbsp;of Damascus and in the later Theodore (abbot of the monastery&nbsp;of Studium at Constantinople). The writings of the iconoclasts&nbsp;were destroyed by the triumphant party, so that we know their&nbsp;case only from the works of their antagonists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this struggle the Greeks and Latins were of one mind; the image-worshippers had the support of the Roman see.&nbsp;When the pope resisted him, Leo III. confiscated the papal&nbsp;estates in Sicily and Calabria; and the diocese of Illyricum&nbsp;was withdrawn from the control of Rome and submitted to&nbsp;the patriarch of Constantinople. But when iconoclasm was&nbsp;defeated, there was ’no question of restoring Illyricum, nor&nbsp;could there be, for political reasons; since the iconoclastic&nbsp;schism had, with other causes, led to the detachment of the&nbsp;papacy from the Empire and its association with the Frankish&nbsp;power. By the foundation of the rival Roman Empire in&nbsp;800 the pope had definitely become a subject of another state.&nbsp;No sooner had the iconoclastic struggle terminated than&nbsp;differences and disputes arose between the Greek and Latin&nbsp;Churches which finally led to an abiding schism, and helped&nbsp;to foster the national self-consciousness of the Greeks. A&nbsp;strife over the patriarchal chair between Ignatius (deposed by&nbsp;Michael III. and supported by Rome) and Photius the learned&nbsp;statesman who succeeded him, strained the relations with&nbsp;Rome; but a graver cause of discord was the papal attempt&nbsp;to win Bulgaria, whose sovereign Boris had been baptized&nbsp;under the auspices of Michael III. (c. 865), and was inclined to&nbsp;play Old Rome against New Rome. Photius stood out as the&nbsp;champion of the Greeks against the claim of the Roman see,&nbsp;and his patriarchate, though it did not lead to a final breach,&nbsp;marks the definite emancipation of the Greeks from the spiritual&nbsp;headship of Rome. This is the significance of his encyclic&nbsp;letter (867), which formulated a number of differences in rite&nbsp;and doctrine between the Greek and Latin Churches, differences&nbsp;so small that they need never have proved a barrier to union,&nbsp;if on one side there had been no question of papal supremacy,&nbsp;and if the Greek attitude had not been the expression of a&nbsp;tenacious nationality. There was a reconciliation about 900,&nbsp;but the Churches were really estranged, and the open and&nbsp;ultimate breach which came in 1054, when the influence of&nbsp;the Cluny movement was dominant at Rome (Leo IX. was&nbsp;pope and Michael Cerularius patriarch), sealed a disunion&nbsp;which had long existed. Subsequent plans of reunion were&nbsp;entertained by the emperors merely for political reasons, to&nbsp;obtain Western support against their foes, or to avert (through&nbsp;papal influence) the aggressive designs of Western princes.&nbsp;They were doomed to futility because they were not seriously&nbsp;meant, and the Greek population was entirely out of sympathy with these political machinations of their emperors.&nbsp;The Union of Lyons (1274) was soon repudiated, and the&nbsp;last attempt, the Union of Florence in 1439, was equally,&nbsp;hollow (though it permanently secured the union of the&nbsp;Rumanians and of the Ruthcnians). Part of the historical&nbsp;significance of the relations between the Greek and Latin</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Churches lies in the fact that they illustrate, and promoted by way of challenge, the persistence of Greek national self-consciousness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The emperors legislated against paganism and ’against heresy, not merely under ecclesiastical pressure, but because&nbsp;they thought religious uniformity politically desirable.&nbsp;Theodosius the Great, a Spaniard, with no sympathy for&nbsp;Hellenic culture, set himself the task of systematically eradicating pagan institutions and customs. Though his&nbsp;persecution accomplished much, paganism was far from being&nbsp;extinct either in the East or in the West in the 5th century.&nbsp;Not only did heathen cults survive in many remote districts,&nbsp;but the old gods had many worshippers among the higher&nbsp;classes at Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria and&nbsp;Athens. The most distinguished Greek literati of that period&nbsp;were non-Christian. Justinian, who united theological enthusiasm with belief in the ideal of uniformity and, like&nbsp;Theodosius, was cut of sympathy with Hellenism (“ IIelIen ”&nbsp;now came to mean “ pagan ”), persecuted polytheism more&nbsp;earnestly and severely than his predecessors. His measures&nbsp;created a panic among the higher classes at Byzantium, of&nbsp;whom many, as he suspected, were addicted to the ancient&nbsp;religion. He instituted a regular inquisition, exacted oaths&nbsp;of orthodoxy from all officials and teachers, and closed the&nbsp;philosophical schools of Athens. Missionaries (and it is&nbsp;remarkable that he employed monophysite heretics) were&nbsp;sent to abolish the old heathen worship which survived in&nbsp;many parts of Asia Minor where Christianity had hardly&nbsp;penetrated. By the end of the 6th century formal paganism&nbsp;had practically disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Asia Minor, especially in the cast, there were many dissident communities which asserted independence of the&nbsp;Church of Constantinople and of all ecclesiastical traditions,&nbsp;founding their doctrines directly on the Bible. Most important&nbsp;of these heretics were the Paulicians </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> a dualistic sect whom&nbsp;the Church regarded as Manichaeans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Autocracy and its Constitutional Forms.—</span><span class="font0">With Diocletian the Principate of Augustus had become Undisguisedly an&nbsp;absolute monarchy, and this constitution prevailed to the&nbsp;end. There is virtually no constitutional history in the&nbsp;proper sense of the term in the later Roman Empire, for there&nbsp;was neither evolution nor revolution. The monarchical&nbsp;system remained in all its essential points unchanged, and&nbsp;presents a remarkable example of an autocracy of immense&nbsp;duration which perfectly satisfied the ideas of its subjects.&nbsp;No attempt was made to alter it,—to introduce, for instance,&nbsp;a limited monarchy or a republican government; all revolts&nbsp;and conspiracies were aimed at the policies of particular&nbsp;autocrats, not at autocracy itself; generally they only represented sectional antagonisms and personal ambitions. The&nbsp;emperors inherited a deeply rooted instinct of legality as a&nbsp;tradition from Old Rome; and this respect for law which&nbsp;marked their acts, along with the generally good administration&nbsp;of justice, was a palladium of the monarchy. They were&nbsp;supreme in legislation, as well as in the administrative and&nbsp;judicial spheres; but they were on the whole moderate in&nbsp;wielding legislation as an instrument of policy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There were, however, recognized constitutional principles which it would have been impossible for the emperor to override.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) The elective principle, inherited from the Rcpubfic, was never changed. A new emperor had to be elected by the&nbsp;senate and acclaimed by the people. The succession never&nbsp;became automatic. But even Augustus had indirectly introduced the dynastic principle. Theodosius the Great, by&nbsp;causing his two sons, Arcadius and Honorius, to be elected&nbsp;Augusti in their infancy, practically elevated the dynastic&nbsp;idea into a constitutional principle; henceforward it was&nbsp;regarded as in the regular course that the son bom to a reigning&nbsp;sovereign should in his infancy be elected Augustus. Thus&nbsp;the election, though always an indispensable form, was only a&nbsp;reality when a dynasty came to an end.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
