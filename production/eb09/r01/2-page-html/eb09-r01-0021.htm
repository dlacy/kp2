<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">coolness, and black balls are in vogue. In England black paint and white balls are used. In cool climates asphalt&nbsp;makes the best flooring. In the tropics stone paving,&nbsp;perfectly evenly set, or some similar material, must be used.&nbsp;Gutta-percha soles to the shoes of the players are indispensable, to prevent slipping and to preserve the evenness&nbsp;of the flooring. The narrow entrance door, made of very&nbsp;hard wood, is situated in the centre of the back wall and&nbsp;must be perfectly flush with the same on the inside. The&nbsp;bottom of the front wall is covered with hollow deal sounding boarding up to a height of 2 feet 2 inches, where is&nbsp;the “ line.” The sound betrays a ball striking the boarding below the line, which throws it out of play. At 7 feet&nbsp;9 inches above the level of the floor comes another white&nbsp;line across the front wall, termed the “ cut line,” because&nbsp;the in-player, when serving, must first make the ball rebound from the front wall above this line. Across the&nbsp;floor, varying in position according to the length of the&nbsp;court, is the “ short line,” so called because an out-player&nbsp;is not bound to take any ball served which falls between&nbsp;it and the front wall. The space between here and the&nbsp;back wall is divided into tw<sup>r</sup>o equal-sized parallelograms&nbsp;by a line drawn down to the doorway. As the front&nbsp;wall is faced, these are called “ right ” and “ left ” courts.&nbsp;An in-player serving from one side must make the ball&nbsp;fall in the other court after rebounding from the front&nbsp;wall. The “ service spaces,” in which an in-player stands&nbsp;when serving, are 8 feet 6 inches deep from the short line&nbsp;and 6 feet 6 inches wide from each side wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The game is played with no other implements but bats and balls. The striking portion of the former is ovalshaped and strung tightly across with catgut. The handle&nbsp;is of pliant ash covered with leather in order to give the&nbsp;hand a tight grip. The balls are about 11 inches in diameter,&nbsp;and very hard in order to rebound evenly and quickly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In a four-handed game we will suppose A and B to be playing against C and I) and that the former couple have won the choice&nbsp;of first innings. A accordingly commences serving from the right&nbsp;service space into the left court, that being the most difficult one to&nbsp;return the ball from. B stands behind A to return any balls for&nbsp;his side in the back portion of the court. C stands where he likes&nbsp;ready to take the ball about to be served by A, whilst C’s partner,&nbsp;D, places himself between A and B to take the fore court play for&nbsp;his side. For A’s service to be good his ball must first strike the&nbsp;front wall above the cut line, and secondly rebound from the floor&nbsp;of the left-hand court, though whether it strike the side or back&nbsp;walls or not after rebounding from the front wall is immaterial.&nbsp;If these rules are complied with, C is bound to return the ball, at its&nbsp;first bound off the floor, on to the front wall above the sounding-board. If he does not succeed A and B score one ace in their favour.&nbsp;If C achieves his purpose the game is continued by one of either side&nbsp;returning the ball alternately, till a player either strikes the sounding board, skies it into the roof or gallery, or strikes it later than&nbsp;the first bound off the floor. If A or B makes the first failure A is&nbsp;out. If it is C or D, the in-side scores an ace, and A continues&nbsp;serving alternately from each service space. The out-player may&nbsp;take a faulty service at his own option. If he does, the ace is&nbsp;played out in the usual way. When A is put out C goes in, then&nbsp;D, and lastly A’s partner B, and so on in the same rotation. B&nbsp;is not allowed to follow A’s first hand, as the latter has the advantage of possibly scoring the first ace. The player who gains the&nbsp;last ace of a game continues serving for the next. The mode of&nbsp;procedure in a single-handed match is precisely the same, each&nbsp;player going in alternately, hut having no partner to aid him. It&nbsp;often happens that both sides go in and out several times running&nbsp;without scoring. The most difficult kind of services to take are&nbsp;the sharp “cut,” which strikes the front wall just above the cut&nbsp;line and rebounds with great velocity, and the “ nick ” into the&nbsp;back corner of the court served into. Other strokes are the “drop,”&nbsp;which places the ball only just above the wooden board, making it&nbsp;fall almost dead ; the “ volley,” in which the ball is struck in the&nbsp;full before touching the floor ; and lastly, the “cut,” by which the&nbsp;ball acquires a twisting or rotatory spin as well as a forward motion&nbsp;caused by a descending diagonal stroke with the bat. The following are the rules of rackets as drawn up and used at Prince’s Club,&nbsp;London, the leading racket club of the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. The game to be 15 up. At 13 all, the out-players may set it to 5, and at&nbsp;14 all, to 3, provided this be done before another ball is struck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The going in first, whether odds be given or not, to be decided by lot,&nbsp;but one hand only then is to be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ball to be served alternately from right and left, beginning whichever&nbsp;side the server pleases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In serving, the server must have one foot in the space marked off for that&nbsp;purpose. The out-player to whom he serves may stand where he pleases, but&nbsp;his partner and the server’s partner must both stand behind the server till&nbsp;the ball is served.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The ball must be served above, and not touching the line on the front&nbsp;wall, and it must strike the floor, before it bounds, within and not touching&nbsp;the lines enclosing the court on the side opposite to that in which the server&nbsp;stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ball served below the line, or to the wrong side, is a fault, but it may&nbsp;be taken, and then the ace must be played out, and counts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In serving, if the ball strikes anywhere before it reaches the front wall, it&nbsp;is a hand out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In serving, if a ball touches the server or his partner before it has bounded&nbsp;twice it is a hand out, whether it was properly served or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a fault—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a.</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the server is not in his proper place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">b.</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the ball is not served over the line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it does not fall in the proper court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">d.</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it touches the roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">e. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If it touches the gallery-netting, posts, or cushions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The out-player may take a fault if he pleases, but if he fails in putting the ball up it counts against him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two consecutive faults put a hand out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An out-player may not take a ball served to his partner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The out-players may change their courts once only in each game.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a player designedly stops a ball before the second bound it counts&nbsp;against him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a ball hits the striker's adversary above or on the knee, it is a let; if&nbsp;below the knee, or if it hits the striker’s partner or himself, it counts against&nbsp;the striker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Till a ball has been touched, or has bounded twice, the player or his&nbsp;partner may strike it as often as they please.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every player should get out of the way as much as possible. If he cannot,&nbsp;the marker is to decide whether it is a let or not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the service, a ball going out of the court or hitting the roof is an&nbsp;ace ; a ball hitting the gallery-netting, posts, or cushions, in returning from the&nbsp;front wall, is a let; but if it hits the roof before reaching the front wall it&nbsp;counts against the striker.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The marker’s decision is final. If he has any doubt, he should ask</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">advice; and, if he cannot decide positively, the ace is to be played over again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H. F. W.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RADAUTZ, a town in the Austrian duchy of Bukowina, is situated on the Suczava, about 15 miles from the&nbsp;frontier of Moldavia. It was formerly the seat of a Greek&nbsp;bishopric, removed to Czernowitz in 1786, and possesses a&nbsp;cathedral with the tombs of several Moldavian princes.&nbsp;It contains a Government stud, and manufactures paper,&nbsp;glass, machinery, beer, and brandy. In 1880 Radautz&nbsp;had 11,162 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RADBERTUS, head of the Benedictine abbey of Corbie, near Amiens, from 844 to 851, and one of the most prominent theological writers of his age, was born at or near&nbsp;Soissons towards the close of the 8th century, and became&nbsp;a monk of Corbie in 814, when he assumed the cloister&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Paschasius. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">He soon gained recognition as a&nbsp;learned and successful teacher, and Adalhard, St Anskar&nbsp;the apostle of Sweden, Odo bishop of Beauvais, and&nbsp;Warinus abbot of Corvey in Saxony may be mentioned&nbsp;among the more distinguished of his pupils. In 844 he&nbsp;was chosen abbot, but as a disciplinarian he was more&nbsp;energetic than successful, and in 867 he resigned the office.&nbsp;In his official capacity he took part in the synod of Chiersy&nbsp;which condemned Gottschalk. Of the closing period of&nbsp;his life nothing is known, except that it was one of great&nbsp;literary activity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">His works include an </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Expositio in Matthseum,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in twelve books, a favourable specimen of the exegesis of that period, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Liber dc&nbsp;Corpore et Sanguine Christi</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, a pious and popularly written treatise,&nbsp;designed to prove that the elements in the sacrament are completely&nbsp;changed. The latter work, originally composed in 831, elicited a&nbsp;reply by Ratramnus, a brother monk of Corbie, who maintained&nbsp;that the body and blood of Christ were present in the Eucharist&nbsp;only “ spiritualiter et secundum potentiam.” The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dc Partic&nbsp;Virginis</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Radbertus (845) was also taken exception to by&nbsp;Ratramnus for its Docetic teaching as to the manner of Christ’s&nbsp;birth “utero clauso.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RADCLIFFE, a town of Lancashire, is situated on the river Irwell, crossed by a bridge of two arches, and on&nbsp;the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway, 7 miles north-west&nbsp;of Manchester and 2 south-west of Bury. The church&nbsp;of St Bartholomew dates from the time of Henry IV. ;&nbsp;some of the Norman portions of the building still remain.&nbsp;The tower was rebuilt in 1665, the north transept added&nbsp;in 1846, and the whole building restored in 1870-73. It&nbsp;possesses some good windows and several ancient monu</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
