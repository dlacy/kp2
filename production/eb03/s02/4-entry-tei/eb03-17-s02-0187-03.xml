in medicine, ſee that article, n⁰ 351, where we have given an account of the ſymptoms, cauſes, and modes of prevention and cure, according to ſome of the moſt eminent writers in medicine. We have here only to add, that, in the opinion oſ Dr Beddoes, the mineral acids, eſpecially the nitric and vitriolic, may be employed in the prevention or cure of this dreadful diſeaſe with as much ſucceſs as the vegetable acids.— But of all the ſubſtances that can at once be cheaply procured and long preſerved, he thinks the concrete acid of tartar by far the moſt promiſing. It is very grateful, and comes near to the citric acid. In tropical countries the ſcurvy is ſeldom known.</p><p><hi rend="italic">ScURVY-graſs,</hi> in botany. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cochlearea.</hi></p><p>The officinalis, or common officinal ſcurvy-graſs, grows upon rocks on the ſea coaſt, and on the Highland mountains, abundantly. It has an acrid, bitter, and acid taſte, and is highly recommended for the ſcurvy. There are inſtances of a whole ſhip’s crew having been cured of that diſtemper by it; and as it abounds with acid ſalts, there can be no doubt but that it is a great reſiſter of putrefaction. The beſt way of taking it is raw in a ſalad. It is alſo diuretic, and uſeful in dropſies. The Highlanders eſteem it as a good ſtomachic.</p><p>The coronopus, another ſpecies, was ſome years ago rendered famous, the aſhes of it being an ingredient in Mrs Joanna Stephens’s celebrated medicine for the ſtone and gravel; but, unfortunately for thoſe afflicted with that excruciating complaint, it has not been able to ſupport its credit. It is acrid, and taſtes like garden creſs.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
