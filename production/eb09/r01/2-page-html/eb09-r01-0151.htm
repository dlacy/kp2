<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REGALIA, insignia of royalty used at the coronation of the sovereign and other great state ceremonials. The&nbsp;regalia of England were in very early times deposited for&nbsp;security in some religious house dependent on the crown,&nbsp;most generally in the treasury of the Temple. The first&nbsp;mention of their being deposited in the Tower of London&nbsp;is in the reign of Henry III., who on his return from&nbsp;France in 1230 commanded the bishop of Carlisle to&nbsp;replace the jewels in the Tower as they had been before.&nbsp;From his time down to the present the regalia (with the&nbsp;exception of the ancient crown of Edward the Confessor,&nbsp;long retained in Westminster Abbey) have been generally in&nbsp;the Tower under the care of a keeper, but both Henry III.&nbsp;and several of his successors, when in money difficulties,&nbsp;had recourse to the expedient of pawning the crown&nbsp;jewels to raise a loan. Originally the keeper was appointed&nbsp;by letters patent at a stated salary of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">£50</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> per annum,&nbsp;which was so largely increased by perquisites that in the&nbsp;time of Henry VIII. it amounted to about ¿£1500. The&nbsp;office had attached to it important privileges, and was&nbsp;frequently held by persons of distinction. At the Restoration many of the perquisites were abolished, and since&nbsp;that period the duties have been merged in those of the&nbsp;lord chamberlain, who appoints a person to have charge of&nbsp;the regalia in the Tower. To make up for the decrease in&nbsp;the perquisites of the office, the regalia were first in the&nbsp;reign of Charles II. allowed to be exhibited in public,&nbsp;the profits accruing being given to the person appointed&nbsp;by the lord chamberlain to have charge of the regalia.&nbsp;They were originally kept in a small building in the south&nbsp;side of the White Tower, till the reign of Charles I., when&nbsp;they were transferred to a strong chamber in the Martin&nbsp;Tower, afterwards called the Jewel Tower. During the&nbsp;Civil War they were nearly all carried off by the Puritans&nbsp;and destroyed, and in 1671 an attempt made to steal the&nbsp;new regalia by Colonel </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Blood </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> was nearly successful.&nbsp;During the fire of 1841 they were removed for safety to&nbsp;the house of the governor, and afterwards a new room&nbsp;within the Wakefield Tower was constructed for their&nbsp;reception. The regalia now contained in this room include&nbsp;St Edward’s crown, made for the coronation of Charles II.&nbsp;to replace the one broken up and sold during the Civil&nbsp;War; the new state crown made for the coronation of&nbsp;Queen Victoria; the prince of Wales’s crown ; the queen&nbsp;consort’s crown ; the queen’s diadem or circlet of gold made&nbsp;for the coronation of Marie d’Este, consort of James IT.;&nbsp;St Edward’s staff of beaten gold ; the royal sceptre or&nbsp;sceptre with the cross ; the rod of equity or sceptre with&nbsp;the dove; the queen’s sceptre with the cross; the queen’s&nbsp;ivory sceptre, made for Marie d’Fste ; an ancient sceptre&nbsp;supposed to have been made for Queen Mary, consort of&nbsp;William III.; the orb; the queen’s orb; the Koh-i-Noor&nbsp;diamond ; the sword of mercy or curtana ; the sword of&nbsp;justice; the armilke or coronation bracelets; the royal&nbsp;spurs ; the ampulla for the holy oil; the gold coronation&nbsp;spoon (supposed to be the only relic of the ancient regalia&nbsp;now remaining) ; the golden salt cellar; the baptismal&nbsp;font; and the silver wine fountain presented to Charles&nbsp;II. by the corporation of Plymouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Tlie regalia of Scotland, of which there is a very complete account in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">1’aprrs relative to the regalia of Scotland</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> published by the&nbsp;Bannatyne Club (1829), consist of the crown, the sceptre, and the&nbsp;sword of state. The ancient regalia were carried off or destroyed&nbsp;by Edward I. of England in 1296, and Robert Bruce was crowned&nbsp;at Scone with a temporary crownlet, which also shortly afterwards&nbsp;fell into the hands of the English. The present crown, from the&nbsp;character of a portion of its workmanship, is supposed to be that&nbsp;made by the orders of Robert Brace and first used at the coronation&nbsp;of David TI. in 1329. Two concentric circles were added to it in&nbsp;the reign of James V., surmounted at the point of intersection with&nbsp;a mound of gold enamelled and a large cross patee, upon which&nbsp;arc the characters J. R. V. The sceptre was made in the reign of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">James V., and the sword of state was presented to King James IV. in 1507 by Pope Julius II. When Cromwell invaded Scotland the&nbsp;regalia were removed for greater security by the earl marischal&nbsp;from the crown room in Edinburgh Castle to his castle of Duunottar,&nbsp;one of the strongest fortresses in Scotland. During its siege by&nbsp;Cromwell they were carried from it by a stratagem devised by the&nbsp;wife of the governor and the wife of the minister of Kiuneff, and&nbsp;buried under the flagstones in Kinneff church, where they remained&nbsp;till the Restoration. From the Restoration till the Union they&nbsp;were deposited in the crown room of Edinburgh Castle. After the&nbsp;Union they lay locked in a chest until 1818, when they were first&nbsp;publicly exhibited.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REGENT. The position of a regent as an administrator of the realm during the minority or incapacity of the king&nbsp;is one unknown to the common law. “ In judgment of law&nbsp;the king, as king, cannot be said to be a minor, for when&nbsp;the royal body politic of the king doth meet with the&nbsp;natural capacity in one person ,the whole body shall have&nbsp;the quality of the royal politic, which is the greater and&nbsp;more worthy and ־wherein is no minority. For </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ovine majus&nbsp;continet in se minus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> ” (Coke upon Littleton, 43a). For&nbsp;reasons of necessity a regency, however anomalous it may&nbsp;be in strict law, has frequently been constituted both in&nbsp;England and Scotland. There are fifteen instances in&nbsp;English history, the earliest of which is the appointment&nbsp;of the earl of Pembroke with the assent of the loyal barons&nbsp;on the accession of Henry III. Whether or not the&nbsp;sanction of parliament is necessary for the appointment is&nbsp;a question which has been much discussed. Lord Coke&nbsp;recommends that the office should depend on the will of&nbsp;parliament </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Inst.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> vol. iv. </span><span class="font2">p. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">58), and it is certain that in&nbsp;modern times provision for a regency has always been&nbsp;made by Act of Parliament. In Scotland the appointment&nbsp;of regents was always either by the assent of a council or of&nbsp;parliament. Thus in 1315 the earl of Moray was appointed&nbsp;regent by Robert I. in a council. At a later period&nbsp;appointment by statute was the universal form. Thus by&nbsp;1542 c. 1 the earl of Arran was declared regent during&nbsp;the minority of Mary. By 1567 c. 1 the appointment by&nbsp;Mary of the earl of Moray as regent was confirmed. As&nbsp;late as 1704 c. 3 provision was made for a regency after&nbsp;the death of Anne. The earliest regency in England resting&nbsp;upon an express statute was that created by 28 Hen. VIII.&nbsp;c. 17, under which the king appointed his executors to&nbsp;exercise the authority of the crown till the successor to&nbsp;the crown should attain the age of eighteen if a male or&nbsp;sixteen if a female. They delegated their rights to the&nbsp;protector Somerset, with the assent of the lords spiritual&nbsp;and temporal. No other example of a statutory provision for a regency occurs till 1751. In that year the&nbsp;Act of 24 Geo. II. c. 24 constituted the princess dowager&nbsp;of Wales regent of the kingdom in case the crown should&nbsp;descend to any of her children before such child attained&nbsp;the age of eighteen. A council called the council of&nbsp;regency was appointed to assist the princess. A prescribed&nbsp;oath was to l&gt;e taken by the regent and members of the&nbsp;council. Their consent was necessary for the marriage of&nbsp;a successor to the crown during minority. It was declared&nbsp;to be unlawful for the regent to make war or peace, or&nbsp;ratify any treaty with any foreign power, or prorogue,&nbsp;adjourn, or dissolve any parliament without the consent of&nbsp;the majority of the council of regency, or give her assent&nbsp;to any bill for repealing or varying the Act of Settlement,&nbsp;the Act of Uniformity, or the Act of the Scottish parliament for securing the Protestant religion and Presbyterian&nbsp;church government in Scotland (1707 c. 6). The last&nbsp;is an invariable provision, and occurs in all subsequent&nbsp;Regency Acts. The reign of George III. affords examples&nbsp;of provision for a regency during both the infancy and&nbsp;incapacity of a king. The Act of 5 Geo. III. c. 27 vested</span></p>
