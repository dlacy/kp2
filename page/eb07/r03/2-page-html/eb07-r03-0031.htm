<p><span class="font0">gian, who was the son of a Christian, and had been brought up in the new faith. The unhappy father refused the demanded victim. The enraged people, deeming their prince&nbsp;and their religion insulted, assailed the house, and having&nbsp;burst open the doors, butchered both the father and the son,&nbsp;folded in mutual embraces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">i Yet this furious Pagan and bloody warrior afterwards became a most zealous Christian, and a shining example of&nbsp;charity and benevolence to his subjects. The circumstances&nbsp;that led to these important changes are, as well as the martial achievements of this favourite prince, related with great&nbsp;minuteness by the Russian annalists, and give this part of&nbsp;their chronicles the air rather of a historical romance than&nbsp;a narrative of facts. We are told that the fame of Vladimir’s military exploits had rendered him so formidable to&nbsp;the neighbouring nations, that each courted his alliance,&nbsp;and strove to render this more lasting by engaging him in&nbsp;the ties of the same religion with themselves. In particular, the Grecian emperors sent to him a philosopher, whose&nbsp;exhortations, though they did not at first induce Vladimir&nbsp;to embrace the Greek ritual, at least succeeded in giving&nbsp;him a favourable opinion of it ; so that the philosopher was&nbsp;entertained with respect, and returned home loaded with&nbsp;presents. We are also told, that, determined to act in the&nbsp;most impartial manner with respect to the several religions&nbsp;which he had been invited to embrace, the prince despatched persons remarkable for their wisdom and sagacity to visit&nbsp;the surrounding nations, inspect the religious tenets and ceremonies that distinguished them, and communicate to him&nbsp;the result of their observations. On the return of these&nbsp;deputies, the report of those who had visited the churches&nbsp;of Constantinople, and witnessed the imposing splendour of&nbsp;religious adoration, and the gorgeous decorations of the&nbsp;Greek priests in the superb basilica of St Sophia, proved&nbsp;so satisfactory to Vladimir, that he determined on embracing the Christian religion according to the Observancesmf&nbsp;the Greek church. But though he resolved on baptism, he&nbsp;was too proud to seek from the Greek emperor a priest by&nbsp;whom the solemn ordinance might be performed. He assembled an army selected from all the nations of which his&nbsp;empire was composed, and marching to Taurida, laid siege&nbsp;to Theodosia, which is the modern Kaffa. On sitting down&nbsp;before the walls of this place, he is said to have offered up&nbsp;the following characteristic prayer : “ O God, grant me thy&nbsp;help to take this town, that I may carry from it Christians&nbsp;and priests to instruct me and my people, and convey the&nbsp;true religion into my dominions.” His prayer was at length&nbsp;granted ; for, rather by stratagem than by force, he made&nbsp;himself master of the town, and, through it, of the whole of&nbsp;the Crimea. He might now have received baptism ; but his&nbsp;desire of being initiated in the Christian faith seems to have&nbsp;been excited more by ambition than by true devotion. His&nbsp;ruling passion promised to be amply gratified by an alliance&nbsp;with the Grecian emperors, as he would thus acquire some&nbsp;legal claim on the territories which they possessed. He&nbsp;therefore demanded in marriage Anna, the sister of Basi-lius and Constantine, who jointly held the imperial dignity;&nbsp;threatening, that if they refused his proffered alliance, he&nbsp;would lay siege to Constantinople. After some deliberation, the emperors complied, on condition that Vladimir and&nbsp;his people should become Christians ; and these conditions&nbsp;being accepted, the Russian monarch was baptized, took&nbsp;the name of Basilius, received the Grecian princess, and, as&nbsp;the reward of his victories, carried off several popes and archimandrites, together with sacred vessels and church books,&nbsp;images of saints, and consecrated relics</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1 Whatever might have been the considerations that swayed Vladimir in his conversion to the Christian faith, it is certain that his new religion had the happiest influence on&nbsp;his subsequent life and conduct. He not only abjured idolatry himself, and destroyed the idols which he had caused</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">to be raised in his dominions, but he used every exertion to persuade and compel his subjects to follow his example.&nbsp;Before his conversion he is said to have possessed five wives&nbsp;and eight hundred concubines; but after he became a Christian, he maintained an unshaken fidelity towards the imperial princess. As a Pagan he had been lavish of human&nbsp;blood ; but after he had adopted the religion of Jesus, he&nbsp;could scarcely be prevailed on to sentence to death a single&nbsp;highway robber. His former delight had been in storming&nbsp;towns and gaining battles ; but he now found his greatest&nbsp;pleasure in building churches, and endowing seminaries of&nbsp;education. He encouraged the raising of new cities and&nbsp;towns ; peopled the waste districts of his country with the&nbsp;prisoners whom he had taken in war ; and not only conducted himself as a sovereign who consulted the welfare of&nbsp;his dominions, but displayed many benevolent and amiable&nbsp;qualities that highly endeared him to his subjects. By thus&nbsp;showing that Christianity had made him both a milder and&nbsp;a wiser prince, he insured from his people a respect for the&nbsp;new religion, whilst the striking example of the sovereign&nbsp;and his nobles could not fail to influence the minds of the&nbsp;inferior orders. Having one day issued a proclamation, ordering all the inhabitants of Kief to repair next morning to&nbsp;the banks of the river to be baptized, the people cheerfully&nbsp;obeyed the order ; observing, that if it were not good to be&nbsp;baptized, the prince and the boyars would never submit&nbsp;to the ceremony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The establishment of Christianity in the Russian dominions forms one of the most prominent features in the reign of Vladimir, and gives him a much juster claim to the title&nbsp;of Great, which has been bestowed on him by historians,&nbsp;than all his numerous victories. We have therefore dwelt&nbsp;on it with the greater minuteness. Indeed the latter transe&nbsp;actions of his reign afford but little interest. His last days&nbsp;were embittered by domestic vexations. His wife and one&nbsp;of his favourite sons died long before him ; while another of&nbsp;his sons, Yaroslaf, on whom he had bestowed the government of Novgorod, refused to acknowledge him as his liege&nbsp;lord, and applied to the Varagians for assistance against his&nbsp;father. The aged Vladimir, compelled to march against a&nbsp;rebellious son, died of grief upon the road, after a long and&nbsp;glorious reign of thirty-five years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Notwithstanding the unfavourable circumstances we have noticed, the improvement which Russia owed to this prince&nbsp;was great and permanent. With the Christian religion he&nbsp;imported from Greece the arts which then flourished in that&nbsp;empire ; and almost entirely new-modelled the language of&nbsp;his country, by engrafting on it the more refined dialect of&nbsp;the Greeks, and adopting, in a great measure, the letters of&nbsp;their alphabet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The dominions of Russia, which at first consisted of two principalities, that of Novgorod, bordering on the Baltic,&nbsp;and that of Kief, occupying no very large space on the&nbsp;eastern bank of the Dnieper, were, by the victories of Vladimir, extended westward along the shores of the Baltic&nbsp;into Lithuania and Poland ; southward along the shores of&nbsp;the Euxine, so as to include the Crimea and great part of the&nbsp;Bulgarian territories ; whilst to the east it extended to the&nbsp;Oka, the Don, and the Volga. He still maintained the seat&nbsp;of government at Kief, of which he was styled grand prince,&nbsp;whilst the other districts were either tributary to that principality, or held of it as their superior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before his death, Vladimir had divided his extensive territories amongst his twelve sons, reserving to himself and his immediate heir the grand principality of Kief. The consequences of this ill-judged distribution were disunion, con-<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>tention, and almost perpetual warfare amongst the brothers.&nbsp;The most respectable, and in the end the most powerful of&nbsp;these, was Yaroslaf, or, as he is commonly called, Jarislas,&nbsp;prince of Novgorod. This prince, finding that Sviatopolk<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>who had raised himself to the sovereignty of Kief after his</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
