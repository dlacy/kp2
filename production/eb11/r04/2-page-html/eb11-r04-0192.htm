<p><span class="font1">Slates are cut to many different sizes varying in length from io in. to 36 in. and in width from 5 in. to 24 in. There are&nbsp;perhaps thirty or more recognized sizes, each distinguished by a&nbsp;different name. In common practice those generally used are&nbsp;“large ladies,“ 16 in. by 8 in.; “countesses,” 20 in. by 10 in.;&nbsp;and duchesses,” 24 in. by 12 in. Generally speaking, the rule&nbsp;governing the use of the different sorts is that the steeper the pitch&nbsp;the smaller the slate, and vice versa. Buildings in very exposed&nbsp;positions naturally require steeply pitched roofs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some of the technical terms used by the slater are as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bed,</span><span class="font1"> the under surface of a slab when laid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Back,</span><span class="font1"> the upper surface of the slate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gauge,</span><span class="font1"> the distance between the lines of nailing. This depends on the length of the slate and equals half the length of the slate&nbsp;after the lap plus an inch for tne nail-hole has been deducted.&nbsp;This is for slates nailed near the toq edge; for those fixed near the&nbsp;middle the gauge would be half an inch more, as no allowance for&nbsp;nail-holes is required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Margin,</span><span class="font1"> the width of the exposed portion of each course which equals the width apart of the nailing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Head and tail,</span><span class="font1"> the top and bottom edges of the slate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lap,</span><span class="font1"> the lap of the tail of one course of slates over the head of the second course below it. The lap is made from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2%</span><span class="font1"> in. to 4 in.&nbsp;(usually 3 in.), and for this distance there are three thicknesses&nbsp;of slate, namely, the tail of the top course, the middle of the next&nbsp;and the head of the third course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Slates may be fixed by nailing at the head (see fig. 22) or.at about the middle. The latter method is the stronger, as the levering effect&nbsp;of the wind cannot attain so great a strength.. There is a small&nbsp;economy effected by centre nailing, as the margin is slightly larger&nbsp;and fewer slates are required to cover a given space; longer nails,&nbsp;however, are required, for as slates are laid at an angle with the&nbsp;pitch of the roof their centres cannot be made to approach so near</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to the slating battens or boarding as the head, which lies close on the surface to which* it is fixed. Another point worth noticing is&nbsp;that the nail-holes in the centre nailed slating are only covered by&nbsp;3 in. of the tail (the amount of the “ lap ”) of the course of slates&nbsp;above, and rain is very liable to be forced under by the wind and&nbsp;cause the wood battens or other woodwork to rot. Head-nailed&nbsp;slates, on the other hand, have their holes covered by two layers of&nbsp;slate, and are removed from exposure by the length of the gauge&nbsp;plus the lap, which in the case of “ countess ” slating equals 11 in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Open slating ” is an economical method of laying slates that is often adopted for the roofs of sheds and temporary buildings. The&nbsp;slates in the same course are not laid edge to edge as in close slating,&nbsp;but at a distance of two or more inches apart. This forms a roof&nbsp;covering light in weight and inexpensive, which, although not&nbsp;strictly weather-proof, is sufficiently so for the buildings upon which&nbsp;it is used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Slates are laid upon open battens fixed upon the rafters or upon close boarding.or upon battens, fixed upon boarding. The battens&nbsp;are } in. or I in. thick and ij in. to 3 in. wide, and are spaced to&nbsp;suit the gauge of the slates. When close boarding is used it is often&nbsp;covered with inodorous asphalted felt. While taking these precautions to make the roof sound and tight it should be borne in&nbsp;mind that slate is liable to. decay if not ventilated, and to effect&nbsp;this the battens are sometimes fixed vertically, ridge ventilators&nbsp;introduced and air inlets arranged_at the eaves. ^The bed of slates&nbsp;laid without provision for the admission of air will be found on&nbsp;removal after some time to have rotted so as to scale off and easily&nbsp;crumble into powder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The nails used in slating are a very important item, and the durability of the work depends to a large extent upon them. They&nbsp;should have large flat heads. The most satisfactory are those made&nbsp;of a composition of copper and zinc, but others of copper, zinc,&nbsp;galvanized iron and plain iron are used. Those of copper are most&nbsp;durable, but arc soft and expensive. Zinc nails are soft and not&nbsp;very durable; they will last about twenty years. Iron nails even&nbsp;if galvanized are objectionable in permanent work,, though they&nbsp;may be used for temporary roofs. When the plain-iron nails are&nbsp;employed they should be heated and plunged in boiled linseed oil.&nbsp;The pitch of a roof intended for slating should not incline less than&nbsp;25° with the horizontal, while 30° is a safer angle to adopt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tiles for roofing purposes are made from clay and burned in a manner similar to bricks. The clay from which they arc made is,&nbsp;however, of a specially tenacious nature and prepared&nbsp;with great care so as to obtain a result as strong and as&nbsp;nearly non-porous as possible. Tiles are obtainable in many different&nbsp;colours, and some of these have a very beautiful effect when fixed&nbsp;and improve with age. They comprise a large number of tints from&nbsp;yellowish red, red and brown to dark blue. As with bricks the&nbsp;quality depends to a large extent upon the burning; underburnt&nbsp;tiles are weak and porous, liable to early decay, while overburning,&nbsp;though improving the tiles as regards durability., will cause them to&nbsp;warp and will spoil colour. The usual shape is the “ plain tile,”&nbsp;but they are made in various other shapes with a view both to easier&nbsp;fixing and lighter weight, and to ornamental effect. There are also&nbsp;several patented forms on the market for which the makers claim&nbsp;special advantages. The ordinary tiles are slightly curved in shape&nbsp;to enable them to lie close one upon the other. Some of them have&nbsp;small “ mbs ” moulded on at the head by which they may be hung&nbsp;upon the battens and nailing avoided (see fig. 23). Nail-holes are&nbsp;provided, and . upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">steep slopes it is ad</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">visable to make use</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of them. . Others are</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">made without the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">nibs, and are fixed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">either by nailing to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the battens or boarding</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">or hung by means</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of oaken pegs wedged</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in the holes to the bat</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">tens, the pegs in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">latter case acting in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the same way as the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">above-mentioned nibs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Plain tiles are of rectangular form, the standard dimensions&nbsp;are io| in. long by&nbsp;6J in. wide. They are&nbsp;usually 1 in. thick and&nbsp;weigh about 2J lb each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are many forms of ornamental tiles, which are plain tiles having their tails cut to various.shapes instead of moulded square.&nbsp;A number of patented forms of tiles also are on the market, some of&nbsp;which possess considerable merit. Pantiles are suitable for temporary and inferior buildings such as sheds and outhouses. They&nbsp;are laid on a different principle from plain tiles, merely overlapping&nbsp;each other at the edges, and. this necessitates bedding in mortar and&nbsp;pointing inside ana sometimes outside with mortar or cement.&nbsp;This pointing plays an important part in keeping the interior of&nbsp;the building free ffom the penetration of wind and water. Pantiles&nbsp;are generally made to measure 13 J in. long by 9 j in. wide, and w<sup>r</sup>eigh&nbsp;from 5 lb to 5I lb each. Moulded on at the head of each tile is a&nbsp;small projecting nib which serves for the purpose of hanging the tile&nbsp;to the lath or batten. They are laid with a lap of 3I in., 2J in. or&nbsp;ij in., giving a gauge (and margin) of 10 in., 11 in. and 12 in.»&nbsp;respectively. The side lap is generally 1} in., leaving a width of&nbsp;8 in. exposed face. There are many other forms based upon the&nbsp;shape of the pantile, some of which are patented and claim to have&nbsp;advantages which the original form does not possess. Among such&nbsp;are “ corrugated tiles,” of the ordinary shape or with angular&nbsp;flutes, and also the Italian pattern “ double roll tiles,” “ Foster’s&nbsp;lock-wing tiles.” Poole’s bonding roll tiles are a development of&nbsp;the Italian pattern tile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Glass as a roof covering and the different methods of fixing it are dealt with in the article </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Glazing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are many, other materials used for roof covering besides those already described^ many of them of considerable value. Some&nbsp;have in the past enjoyed considerable vogue, but have&nbsp;practically died out of use owing to the development and&nbsp;cheapening of other forms of roofing. Among these may&nbsp;be included.thatch and wood shingles, the use of which in&nbsp;these days is practically reduced to special cases. Other little used&nbsp;roofing materials are those of recent invention, some of which perhaps</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
