<p><span class="font0">muted into perpetual exile. And finally on Christmas day, in St Peter’s, before an assemblage of Roman and&nbsp;Frankish lords, the clergy, and the people, the pontiff&nbsp;placed the imperial crown on Charlemagne’s head and all&nbsp;proclaimed him emperor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus the new emperor was elected by the Romans and consecrated by the pope. But he was their real master&nbsp;and supreme judge. The pope existed only by his will,&nbsp;since he alone supplied the means for the maintenance of&nbsp;the temporal power, and already pretended to the right of&nbsp;controlling the papal elections. Yet Charlemagne was&nbsp;not sovereign of Rome ; he possessed scarcely any regalia&nbsp;there, and was not in command of the army ; he mainly&nbsp;represented a principle, but this principle was the law&nbsp;which is the basis of the state. The pope still nominated&nbsp;the Roman judges, but the emperor or his ro⅛' presided&nbsp;over them, together with those of the pope, and his&nbsp;decision was appealed to in last resort. During the Caro-lingian times no mention is found of the prefect, and it&nbsp;would seem that his office was filled by the imperial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">missus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or legate, the judices de clero, and judices de militia.&nbsp;The power of the pope was now entangled with that of the&nbsp;republic on the one hand and that of the empire on the&nbsp;other. The consequent confusion of sacred and secular functions naturally led to infinite complications and disputes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The death of Charlemagne in 814 was the signal for a fresh conspiracy of the nobles against the pope, who, discovering their design, instantly put the ringleaders to death,&nbsp;and was severely blamed by Louis for this violation of the&nbsp;imperial prerogative. While the matter was under discussion the nobles broke out in fiercer tumults, both in&nbsp;Rome and the Campagna. At last, in 824, the emperor&nbsp;Lothair came to re-establish order in Rome, and proclaimed&nbsp;a new and noteworthy constitution, to which Pope Eugenius&nbsp;II. (824-27) gave his oath of adherence. By this the&nbsp;partnership of pope and emperor in the temporal rule of&nbsp;Rome and the states of the church was again confirmed.&nbsp;The more direct power appertained to the pope ; the&nbsp;supreme authority, présidence of the tribunals, and final&nbsp;judgment on appeal to the emperor. The new constitution also established the right of contending parties to&nbsp;select either the Roman or the Teutonic code for the settlement of their disputes. During the Carolingian period it&nbsp;is not surprising that the commune should have been, as&nbsp;it were, absorbed by the church and the empire. In fact&nbsp;it is scarcely mentioned in history throughout that time.&nbsp;And when, no longer sustained by the genius of its founder,&nbsp;the Frankish empire began to show signs of dissolution,&nbsp;the popes, finding their power thereby strengthened, began&nbsp;to assume many of the imperial attributes. Soon, however,&nbsp;as a natural consequence of the loss of the main support of&nbsp;the papacy, the nobles regained vigour and were once&nbsp;more masters of the city. Teutonic and feudal elements&nbsp;had now largely penetrated into their organization. The&nbsp;system of granting lands, and even churches and convents,&nbsp;as benefices according to feudal forms, became more and&nbsp;more general. It was vain for the popes to offer opposition, and they ended by yielding to the current. The fall&nbsp;of the Frankish empire left all Italy a prey to anarchy,&nbsp;and torn by the faction fights of Berengar of Friuli and&nbsp;Guido of Spoleto, the rival claimants to the crowns of&nbsp;Italy and the empire. The Saracens were advancing from&nbsp;the south, the Huns from the north ; the popes had lost all&nbsp;power; and in the midst of this frightful chaos a way was&nbsp;opened for the rise of the republics. Anarchy was at its&nbsp;climax in Rome, but the laity began to overpower the&nbsp;clergy to such an extent that the judices de militia prevailed over the judices de clero. For a long time no&nbsp;imperial missi or legates had been seen, and the papacy&nbsp;was incredibly lowered. The election of the popes had&nbsp;positively fallen into the hands of certain beautiful women&nbsp;notorious for their evil life and depravity. The aristocracy alone gained strength ; now freed from the domination of the emperor, it continually wrested fresh privileges&nbsp;from the impotent pontiffs, and became organized as the&nbsp;ruling force of the republic. Gregorovius, notwithstanding his denial of the continuation of the senate after the&nbsp;6th century, is obliged to acknowledge that it appeared&nbsp;to have retürned to life in the power of this new baronage.&nbsp;And, although this body was now permeated with the feudal&nbsp;principle, it did not discard its ancient traditions. The&nbsp;nobles claimed to be the main source of the empire; they&nbsp;wished to regain the dignity and office of patricius, and to&nbsp;make it, if possible, hereditary in their families. Nothing&nbsp;is known of their system of organization, but it seems that&nbsp;they elected a chief bearing the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">consul, senator,&nbsp;pmnceps Romanorum,</span><span class="font0"> who was officially recognized by the&nbsp;pope, as a patricius presided over the tribunals, and was&nbsp;the head of the commune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theophylact was one of the first to assume this dignity. His wife Theodora, known as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">senαtrix,</span><span class="font0"> was one of the&nbsp;women then dominating Rome by force of their charms&nbsp;and licentiousness. She was supposed to be the concubine'&nbsp;of Pope John X. (914-928), whose election was due to her&nbsp;influence. Her daughter Marozia, in all things her worthy&nbsp;rival, was married to Alberic, a foreign mercenary of uncertain birth who rose to a position of great influence, and,&nbsp;although an alien, played a leading part in the affairs of&nbsp;the city. He helped to increase the power of Theophylact,&nbsp;who seemingly shared the rule of the city with the pope.&nbsp;In the bloody war that had to be waged against the&nbsp;Saracens of southern Italy, and at the defeat of the latter&nbsp;on the Garigliano (916), Theophylact and Alberic were&nbsp;the Roman leaders, and distinguished themselves by their&nbsp;valour. They disappeared from the scene after this victory,&nbsp;but Marozia retained her power, and bore a son Alberic,&nbsp;who was destined to greater deeds. The pope found himself caught in this woman’s toils, and struggled to escape,&nbsp;but Marozia, gaining fresh influence by her marriage with&nbsp;Hugo, margrave of Tuscany, imprisoned the pontiff himself&nbsp;in Castle St Angelo (928). This fortress was the property&nbsp;of Marozia and the basis of her strength. The unfortunate&nbsp;John died within its walls. Raised to the chair by&nbsp;Theodora, he was deposed and killed by her daughter.&nbsp;The authority of the latter reached its culminating point&nbsp;in 931, when she succeeded in placing her son John XI.&nbsp;on the papal throne. On the death of her second husband&nbsp;she espoused Hugo of Provence, the same who in 928 had&nbsp;seized the iron crown at Pavia, and now aspired to the&nbsp;empire. Dissolute, ambitious, and despotic, he came to&nbsp;Rome in 932, and, leaving his army outside the walls,&nbsp;entered Castle St Angelo with his knights, instantly began&nbsp;to play the tyrant, and gave a blow to Alberic his stepson, who detested him as a foreign intruder. This blow&nbsp;proved the cause of a memorable revolution ; for Alberic&nbsp;rushed from the castle and harangued the people, crying&nbsp;that the time was come to shake off the tyrannous yoke&nbsp;of a woman and of barbarians who were once the slaves of&nbsp;Rome. Then, putting himself at the head of the populace, he closed the city gates to prevent Hugo’s troops&nbsp;from coming to the rescue, and attacked the castle. The&nbsp;king fled ; Marozia was imprisoned, Alberic proclaimed&nbsp;lord of the Romans, and the pope confined to the Lateran&nbsp;in the custody of his own brother. Rome was again an&nbsp;independent state, a republic of nobles. Rid of the&nbsp;temporal dominion of emperor and pope, and having&nbsp;expelled the foreigners with great energy and courage, it&nbsp;chose Alberic for its chief with the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pmnceps&nbsp;atgue omnium Romanornm senator.</span><span class="font0"> The tendency of the&nbsp;Roman republic to elect a supreme authority, first mani</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
