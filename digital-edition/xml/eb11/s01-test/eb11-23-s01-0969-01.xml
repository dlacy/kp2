a town of Afghanistan, situated at an elevation of 3550 ft. on the left bank of the river Harud, 93 m. S. of Herat. Sabzawar was once a city of considerable size, and still possesses a fortress with sides of about 2âˆž or 250 yds. This fortress has been abandoned, and the town, which is the centre of a group of villages, is now fairly prosperous, with a bazaar of about 800 shops and a busy traffic with Seistan. The plains about Sabzawar are highly cultivated by the Nurzai Duranis, and each village boasts its own little mud fort.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
