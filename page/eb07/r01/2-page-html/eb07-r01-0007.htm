<p><span class="font0">ledged. He first made his peace with Nicole, who received him with open arms ; and Boileau introduced him to Ar-nauld, who also embraced him tenderly, at the same time&nbsp;freely forgiving him all his satire. About the same time&nbsp;Louis XIV. appointed Racine and Boileau historiographers&nbsp;of France, upon the understanding, of course, that they were&nbsp;to write the history of his reign ; and the public expected&nbsp;great things from two writers of such distinguished reputation. But both the king and his subjects were equally disappointed. Boileau and Racine, after having for some time&nbsp;laboured at the work, perceived that it was entirely opposite to the genius of each ; and they also judged, with reason,&nbsp;that the history of such a king could not, and indeed ought&nbsp;not, to be written until long after his death, unless it were to&nbsp;be made up of extracts of gazettes and such like materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During a period of twelve years, Racine had steadily adhered to his resolution not to write any more poetry, especially for the stage; but the entreaties of Madame de Main-tenon so far prevailed as to induce him to resume his dramatic character, and in consequence he composed his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther, </span><span class="font0">which was to be represented, not on the French stage, but in&nbsp;the house of Saint-Cyr. On the 20th of January 1689, it was&nbsp;performed for the first time, and had prodigious success.&nbsp;“ It appears to me very remarkable,” says Voltaire, “ that&nbsp;this tragedy should then have had universal success, and&nbsp;that two years afterwards </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie,</span><span class="font0"> though performed by&nbsp;the same persons, had none. It happened quite otherwise&nbsp;when these pieces were acted at Paris long after the death&nbsp;of the author, and when prejudice and partiality had ceased.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie,</span><span class="font0"> represented in 1717, was received, as it deserved to&nbsp;be, with transport; whilst </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther,</span><span class="font0"> in 1721, inspired nothing&nbsp;but coldness, and never appeared again. But at that time&nbsp;there were no courtiers who complaisantly acknowledged&nbsp;Esther in Madame de Maintenon, and with equal malignity&nbsp;saw Vashti in Madame de Montespan, Haman in M. de&nbsp;Louvois, and above all, the persecution of the Hugonots&nbsp;by this minister, in the proscription of the Hebrew’s.” The&nbsp;same writer, who had no taste for scriptural subjects, thinks&nbsp;the story of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther</span><span class="font0"> uninteresting and even improbable ;&nbsp;“ but, notwithstanding the badness of the subject,” he adds,&nbsp;“ thirty verses of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Esther</span><span class="font0"> are of more value than many tragedies which have had great success.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie,</span><span class="font0"> composed, like Esther, for Saint-Cyr, had, as already intimated, a very different fate. Envy masked under a false zeal prevented the representation. It was only performed twice at Versailles, in a chamber without scenes&nbsp;and costumes, by the ladies of Saint-Cyr. Racine having&nbsp;Originally intended it for publication, now sent it to the press;&nbsp;but, to the eternal disgrace of the age and nation, this masterpiece of sublime genius, unsurpassed either in ancient or&nbsp;in modern times, found no readers ; and, in some societies&nbsp;of pretended wits, the perusal of it was ironically prescribed as penance. It is in truth lamentable to think that Racine should have descended to the grave suffering under&nbsp;this injustice, and with the bitter feeling of seeing his age&nbsp;dissatisfied with his immortal work. In vain did Arnauld,&nbsp;from the depth of his solitude, try to sustain, by his suffrage,&nbsp;the sinking spirits of his old pupil; in vain did Boileau repeat, “ C’est votre meilleur ouvrage, le public y reviendra.”&nbsp;Racine almost believed that he had survived his genius, and&nbsp;the authority of Boileau, so potential with posterity, was&nbsp;disregarded during the lifetime of his friend. This second&nbsp;injustice of the public towards Racine reopened the wound&nbsp;inflicted by the first, completed his disgust, and decided him&nbsp;to abandon definitively writing for the theatre, which, in&nbsp;fact, his religious impressions had, for some time, led him to&nbsp;regard as incompatible with the Christian life. He accordingly withdrew' from all connection with the stage, and employed the remainder of his days in the grateful and almost&nbsp;filial task of composing a history of Port-Royal, the place of&nbsp;his education, which is drawn up with equal taste and elegance, but was not published till 1767, when it appeared in&nbsp;two volumes 12mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Racine, although he had conversed much with the court, had not learned to disguise his sentiments, the usual, perhaps the necessary accomplishment of a courtier. In 1697,&nbsp;during one of those interviews which Madame de Mainte-non frequently granted him, the conversation having turned&nbsp;upon the misery of the people exhausted by long wars, and&nbsp;the best means of affording them relief, this celebrated woman entreated the poet to throw his ideas on the subject&nbsp;into the form of a memoir, promising that the writing should&nbsp;not pass out of her hands. Racine consented, not from the&nbsp;mere complaisance of a courtier, and still less from any ambitious view’, which the whole tenor of his life contradicts,&nbsp;but solely with the design of being useful. The king surprised this memoir in the hands of his mistress, and the name&nbsp;of the author was disclosed. Perhaps the lesson was a little&nbsp;too direct, since the monarch, who had all along favoured the&nbsp;poet, immediately took offence. “ Because he makes good&nbsp;verses,” said Louis, “ does he think he knows every thing ?&nbsp;and because he is a great poet, does hepretend to be a statesman ?” Racine was greatly hurt by this observation, not&nbsp;from any selfish consideration, but from the idea of having&nbsp;unnecessarily offended his royal benefactor. But to say as&nbsp;some have done, that it shortened his days, is manifestly&nbsp;absurd. His constitution had for several years been sinking&nbsp;under the wasting influence of excitement, and, in consequence, the term of his earthly career was now fast approaching. During his last illness, however, the king evinced&nbsp;the greatest interest in the expiring poet, about whom he daily&nbsp;sent to make the most anxious inquiries ; and his benefits&nbsp;followed him even beyond the tomb. Racine died on the&nbsp;22d of April, 1699, after much suffering, borne with truly&nbsp;Christian fortitude, and was interred, according to his wish,&nbsp;at Port-Royal, at the feet of Dr. Hamon, that he might not&nbsp;be separated even in death, from the master whom he so&nbsp;loved and respected in life. After the destruction of this&nbsp;monastery, his remains were transported to Paris, and deposited in the church of Saint-Etienne-du-Mont, where they&nbsp;were placed beside those of Pascal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Racine was naturally melancholy when alone, though gentle and pleasing with others. His nature was tender and affectionate, inclined to indulge sorrowful or religious emotions rather than those which spring out of mirth or joy. He&nbsp;was generous, and knew how to preserve the means of being&nbsp;so by much order and economy. He afforded assistance to&nbsp;a number of distant relations, and had a regard almost filial&nbsp;for his nurse, whom he did not forget in his will. There was&nbsp;no better husband, no more affectionate father. The Christian education of his children formed his chief concern. He&nbsp;had family prayers daily, at the same time reading and explaining a portion of the gospel to his wife, his children, and&nbsp;his domestics. During the last ten years of his life, all his&nbsp;pleasures, and all his happiness were concentred in his domestic circle. He no longer went to court except when&nbsp;called thither by the duties of his charge, and the interests of&nbsp;his family ; and yet who else could boast of the same meansof&nbsp;pleasing and making himself beloved ; his fine and noble&nbsp;figure, his gracious manners, all the charms of wit, all the&nbsp;splendour of renown, united with the happy art of causing&nbsp;them to be forgotten ? He was, indeed, what the ladies of&nbsp;Saint-Cyr described him, a man of great genius and great&nbsp;simplicity ; and he had, in fact, enchanted the world, more by&nbsp;the amenity and grace of his instructions, than by his talent&nbsp;for declamation, which, however, he possessed in the very&nbsp;highest degree. No man of his time read and recited better than Racine. One day, at Boileau’s, in his house at&nbsp;Anteuil, reading and translating off-hand the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Edipus</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Sophocles, he drew tears from all present. He also taught&nbsp;Baron and La Champmale a system of declamation more&nbsp;conformable to nature and good taste, or. to express it</span></p>
