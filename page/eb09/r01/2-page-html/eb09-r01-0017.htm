<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">preface to both which he had prepared with a view to publishing them together. In this respect Boileau was&nbsp;certainly Racine’s good angel, for no one has ventured to&nbsp;excuse the tone of these letters. The best excuse for them is&nbsp;that they represent the accumulated resentment arising&nbsp;from a long course of “ excommunications.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">After this disagreeable episode Racine’s life for ten years and more becomes simply the history of his plays, if we&nbsp;except his liaisons with the actresses Mademoiselle du Parc&nbsp;and Mademoiselle de Champmeslé (which are undoubted,&nbsp;though there is not much to be said about them) and his&nbsp;election to the Academy on 17th July 1673. Mademoiselle&nbsp;du Parc (Marquise de Gorla) was no very great actress, but&nbsp;was very beautiful, and she had previously captivated&nbsp;Molière. Racine induced her to leave the Palais Royal&nbsp;company and join the Hôtel. She died in 1668, and long&nbsp;afterwards the infamous Voisin accused Racine of having&nbsp;poisoned her. Mademoiselle de Champmeslé was plain and&nbsp;stupid, but an admirable actress and apparently very attractive in some way, for not merely Racine but Charles&nbsp;de Sévigné and many others adored her. She was cruel&nbsp;to none, but for five years before his marriage Racine&nbsp;seems to have been her </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">amant en titre.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Long afterwards, just before his own death, he heard of her mortal&nbsp;illness and speaks of her to his son without a flash of&nbsp;tenderness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The series of his dramatic triumphs began with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andro-maque,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and this play may perhaps dispute with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the title of his masterpiece. It is much more&nbsp;uniformly good than </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">, and the character of Hermione&nbsp;is the most personally interesting on the French tragic&nbsp;stage. It is said that the first representation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> was on 10th November 1667, in public and by&nbsp;the actors of the Hôtel de Bourgogne, but the first contemporary mention of it by the gazettes, prose and verse,&nbsp;is on the 17 th, as performed in the queen’s apartment.&nbsp;Perrault, by no means a friendly critic as far as Racine is&nbsp;concerned, says that it made as much noise as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cid,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and so it ought to have done. Whatever may be thought&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tragédie pathétique</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (a less favourable criticism might&nbsp;call it the “sentimental tragedy”), it could hardly be&nbsp;better exemplified than in this admirable play. A ferocious&nbsp;epigram of Racine’s own (an epigram not unworthy of&nbsp;Martial, and as difficult to comment on to modern ears&nbsp;polite as some of Martial’s own) tells us that some critics&nbsp;thought Pyrrhus too fond of his mistress, and Andromache&nbsp;too fond of her husband, which is not likely to be the&nbsp;present verdict. In the contemporary depreciations is to&nbsp;be found the avowal of its real merit. The interest was&nbsp;too varied, the pathos too close to human nature to content&nbsp;Boileau, and the partisans of Corneille still found Racine&nbsp;unequal to the heroic height of their master’s grandeur.&nbsp;A just criticism will probably hold that these two objections&nbsp;neutralize each other. Both parties agreed in saying that&nbsp;much of the success was due to the actors, another censure&nbsp;which is equivalent to praise. It so happens, too, that,&nbsp;though the four main parts were played by accomplished&nbsp;artists, two at least of them were such as to try those&nbsp;artists severely. Pyrrhus was taken by Floridor, the best&nbsp;tragic actor by common consent of his time, and Orestes&nbsp;by Montfleury, also an accomplished player. But Mademoiselle du Parc, who played Andromache, had generally&nbsp;been thought below, not above, her parts, and Mademoiselle&nbsp;des Oeillets, who played the difficult rôle of Hermione, was&nbsp;old and had few physical advantages. No one who reads&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> without prejudice is likely to mistake the&nbsp;secret of its success, which is, in few words, the application&nbsp;of the most delicate art to the conception of really tragic&nbsp;passion. Before leaving the play it may be mentioned&nbsp;that it is said to have been in the part of Hermione, three</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">years later, that Mademoiselle de Champmeslé captivated the author. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> was succeeded, at the distance&nbsp;of not more than a year, by a play which, taken in conjunction with his others, is perhaps the best proof of the&nbsp;theatrical talent of Racine,—the charming comedietta of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Plaideurs.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> We do not know exactly when it was&nbsp;played, but it was printed on 5th December 1668, and it&nbsp;had succeeded so badly that doubtless no long time passed&nbsp;between its appearance on the stage and in print. For&nbsp;the printing at that time both in France and England&nbsp;made the play </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">publica maternes,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and therefore in the case&nbsp;of very successful pieces it was put off as long as possible.&nbsp;Many anecdotes are told about the origin and composition&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Plaideurs,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wasps</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Aristophanes and the&nbsp;known fact that Racine originally destined it, not for a&nbsp;French company, but for the Italian troupe which was&nbsp;then playing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Commedia dell' Arte</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Paris dispense us&nbsp;from enumerating them. The result is a piece admirably&nbsp;dramatic, but sufficiently literary to shock the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">profanum&nbsp;vulgus,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> which too frequently gives the tone at theatres. It&nbsp;failed completely, the chief favouring voice being, according to a story sufficiently well attested and worthy of&nbsp;belief even without attestation, that of the man who was&nbsp;best qualified to praise and who might have been most&nbsp;tempted to blame of any man then living. Molière, says&nbsp;Yalincourt, the special friend of Racine, said in leaving&nbsp;the house, “ Que ceux qui se moquoient de cette pièce&nbsp;meri toi ent qu’on se moquoient d’eux.” But the piece was&nbsp;suddenly played at court a month later ; the king laughed,&nbsp;and its fortunes were restored. The truth probably was&nbsp;that the legal profession, which was very powerful in the&nbsp;city of Paris, did not fancy the most severe satire on its&nbsp;ways which had been made public since the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">or ça</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the&nbsp;fifth book of Rabelais. It need only be added that, if&nbsp;Louis XIY. admired </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Plaideurs,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Napoleon did not, and&nbsp;excluded it from his travelling library. It was followed&nbsp;by a very different work, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Britannicus,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> which appeared on&nbsp;13th December 1669. It was much less successful than&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and, whether or not the cabals, of which&nbsp;Racine constantly complains, and which he certainly did&nbsp;nothing to disarm, had anything to do with this, it seems&nbsp;to have held its own but a very few nights. Afterwards&nbsp;it became very popular, and even from the first the exquisite versification was not denied. But there is no&nbsp;doubt that in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Britannicus</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the defects of Racine, which in&nbsp;his first two plays were excusable on the score of apprenticeship, and in the next two hardly appeared at all, display&nbsp;themselves pretty clearly to any competent critic. The&nbsp;complete nullity of Britannicus and Junie and the insufficient attempt to display the complex and dangerous character of Nero are not redeemed by Agrippina, who is really&nbsp;good, and Burrhus, who is solidly painted as a secondary&nbsp;character. Voltaire calls it “la pièce des connaisseurs,”&nbsp;and the description is—not quite in the sense in which the&nbsp;critic meant it—a very pregnant one. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Britannicus</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> is&nbsp;eminently the piece in which persons of a dilettante turn&nbsp;are seduced by the beauties which do exist to discover&nbsp;those which do not. The next play of Racine has, except&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the most curious history of all. “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bérénice,״</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> says&nbsp;Fontenelle succinctly, “fut un duel,” and he acknowledges&nbsp;that his uncle was not the conqueror. Henrietta of Orleans&nbsp;proposed (it is said without letting them know the double&nbsp;commission) the subject to Corneille and Racine at the&nbsp;same time, and rumour gives no very creditable reasons&nbsp;for her choice of the subject. Her death, famous for its&nbsp;disputed causes and for Bossuet’s sermon, preceded the&nbsp;performance of the two plays, both of which, but especially&nbsp;Racine’s, were successful. There is no doubt that it is&nbsp;the better of the two, but Chapelle’s not unfriendly criticism in quoting the two lines of an old song—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
