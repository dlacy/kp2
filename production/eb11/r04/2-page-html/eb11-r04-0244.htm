<p><span class="font1">for his cantata </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">II pianto</span><span class="font1"> d’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ar m onia per la morte d'Orfeo.</span><span class="font1"> Between 1810 and 1813, at Bologna, Rome, Venice and Milan, Rossini produced operas of which the successes were varying.&nbsp;All memory of them is eclipsed in that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tancredi.</span><span class="font1"> The libretto&nbsp;was an arrangement of Voltaire’s tragedy by J. A. Rossi. Traces&nbsp;of Paer and Paisiello were undeniably present in fragments&nbsp;of the music. But all critical feeling on the part of the public&nbsp;was drowned in the effect of sweetness and clarity produced&nbsp;by such melodies as “ Mi rivedrai, ti rivedrd ” and “ Di tanti&nbsp;palpiti,” the former of which became so popular that the&nbsp;Italians would sing it in crowds at the law courts until called&nbsp;upon by the judge to desist. Rossini continued to write operas&nbsp;for Venice and Milan during the next few years, but their reception was tame and in some cases unsatisfactory after the success&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tancredi.</span><span class="font1"> In 1815 he retired to his home at Bologna, where&nbsp;Barbaja, the impresario of the Naples theatre, who had once&nbsp;been a waiter in a coffee-house and now combined the business&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">theatrical management with that of farming the public&nbsp;gaming-tables, concluded an agreement with him by which&nbsp;he was to take the musical direction of the Teatro San Carlo&nbsp;and the Teatro Del Fondo at Naples, composing for each of&nbsp;them one opera a year. His payment was to be 200 ducats&nbsp;(about £35 or $173) per month; he was also to receive a share&nbsp;in the gaming-tables amounting to about 1000 ducats (£175 or&nbsp;$875) per annum. The presence of Zingarelli and Paisiello&nbsp;in Naples was an incentive to intrigue against the success of&nbsp;the youthful composer, but all hostility was made futile by&nbsp;the enthusiasm which greeted the court performance of his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elisabetta regina</span><span class="font1"> d’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inghilterra,</span><span class="font1"> in which Isabella Colbran, who&nbsp;subsequently became the composer’s wife, took a leading part.&nbsp;The libretto of this opera by Schmidt was in many of its incidents an anticipation of those presented to the world a few&nbsp;years later in Scott’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kenilworth.</span><span class="font1"> The opera was the first&nbsp;in which Rossini wrote the ornaments of the airs instead of&nbsp;leaving them to the fancy of the singers, and also the first in&nbsp;which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recitativo secco</span><span class="font1"> was replaced by a recitative accompanied by a quartet of strings. In XZwoma, produced in&nbsp;the beginning of the next year in Rome, the libretto, a version&nbsp;of Beaumarchais’ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Barbier de Seville</span><span class="font1"> by Sterbini, was the same&nbsp;as that already used by Paisiello in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Barbiere,</span><span class="font1"> an opera&nbsp;which had enjoyed European popularity for more than a quarter&nbsp;of a century. The indignation of Paisiello’s admirers expressed&nbsp;itself strongly on the production of the new setting, but in&nbsp;the thirteen days devoted to the composition of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Almaviva,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Rossini had created such a masterpiece of musical comedy&nbsp;that the fame of Paisiello’s opera was transferred to his, to&nbsp;which the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">II Barbiere di Siviglia</span><span class="font1"> passed as an inalienable heritage. Between 1815 and 1823 Rossini produced&nbsp;twenty operas. Of these </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Otello</span><span class="font1"> formed the climax to his reform&nbsp;of serious opera, and offers a suggestive contrast with the treatment of the same subject at a similar point of artistic development by the composer Verdi. In Rossini’s time the tragic&nbsp;close was so distasteful to the public of Rome that it was necessary to invent a happy conclusion to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Otello;</span><span class="font1"> and there are still&nbsp;places in Italy in which the Shakespearian end of the story can&nbsp;never be performed without interruption from the audience,&nbsp;who warn Desdemona of Otello’s deadly approach. Conditions&nbsp;of stage mechanism in 1817 are illustrated by Rossini’s acceptance of the subject of Cinderella for a libretto only on the condition that the supernatural element should be omitted. The&nbsp;opera </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cenerentola</span><span class="font1"> is to be ranked with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Barbiere.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;absence of a similar precaution in the construction of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mose&nbsp;in Egitto</span><span class="font1"> led to disaster in the scene depicting the passage of&nbsp;the Israelites through the Red Sea, when the defects in stage&nbsp;contrivance always raised a laugh, so that the composer was&nbsp;at length compelled to introduce the chorus “ Dal tuo stellato&nbsp;Soglio ” to divert attention from the dividing waves. In 1821,&nbsp;three years after the production of this work, Rossini married&nbsp;Isabella Colbran. In 1822 he directed his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cenerentola</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;Vienna, where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zelmira</span><span class="font1"> was also performed. After this he&nbsp;returned to Bologna; but an invitation from Prince Metter-nich to come to Verona and “ assist in the general re-establishment of harmony ” was too tempting to be refused, and he&nbsp;arrived at the Congress in time for its opening on the 20th of&nbsp;October 1822. Here he made friends with Chateaubriand and&nbsp;Madame de Lieven. In 1823, at the suggestion of the manager&nbsp;of the King’s Theatre, London, he came to England, being&nbsp;much fêted on his way through Paris. In England he was&nbsp;given a generous welcome, which included an introduction&nbsp;to King George IV. and the receipt of £7000 after a residence&nbsp;of five months. In 1824 he became musical director of the&nbsp;Théâtre Italien in Paris at a salary of £800 per annum, and&nbsp;when the agreement came to an end he was rewarded with&nbsp;the offices of chief composer to the king and inspector-general&nbsp;of singing in France, to which was attached the same income.&nbsp;The production of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guillaume Tell</span><span class="font1"> in 1829 brought his career&nbsp;as a writer of opera to a close. The libretto was by Étienne&nbsp;Jouy and Hippolyte Bis, but their version was revised by&nbsp;Armand Marrast. The music is remarkable for its freedom&nbsp;from the conventions discovered and utilized by Rossini in his&nbsp;earlier works, and marks a transitional stage in the history of&nbsp;opera. In 1829 he returned to Bologna. His mother had&nbsp;died in 1827, and he was anxious to be with his father. Arrangements for his subsequent return to Paris on a new agreement&nbsp;were upset by the abdication of Charles X. and the July Revolution of 1830. Rossini, who had been considering the subject&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Faust</span><span class="font1"> for a new opera, returned, however, to Paris in the&nbsp;November of that year. Six movements of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stabat Mater&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">were written in 1832 and the rest in 1839, thé year of his father’s&nbsp;death, and the success of the work bears comparison with his&nbsp;achievements in opera; but his comparative silence during&nbsp;the period from 1832 to 1868 makes his biography appear&nbsp;almost like the narrative of two lives—the life of swift triumph,&nbsp;and the long life of seclusion, of which the biographers give us&nbsp;pictures in stories of the composer’s cynical wit, his speculations&nbsp;in fish culture, his mask of humility and indifference. His&nbsp;first wife died in 1845, and political disturbances in the&nbsp;Romagna compelled him to leave Bologna in 1847, the year&nbsp;of his second marriage with Olympe Pelissier, who had sat to&nbsp;Vemet for his picture of “ Judith and Holofernes.” After living&nbsp;for a time in Florence he settled in Paris in 1855, where his&nbsp;house was a centre of artistic society. He died at his country&nbsp;house at Passy on the 13th of November 1868. He was a&nbsp;foreign associate of the Institute, grand officer of the Legion&nbsp;of Honour, and the recipient of innumerable orders. In his&nbsp;compositions Rossini plagiarized even more freely from himself than from other musicians, and few of his operas are without&nbsp;such admixtures frankly introduced in the form of arias or&nbsp;overtures. A characteristic mannerism in his musical writing&nbsp;earned for him the nickname of “ Monsieur Crescendo.” His&nbsp;music is associated with the names of the greatest singers in&nbsp;lyrical drama, such as Tamburini, Mario, Rubini, Delle Sedie,&nbsp;Albani, Grisi, Patti and Nilsson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSSLAND, an important city in the Kootenay district of British Columbia, incorporated in 1897. Pop. (1907) 4033. It&nbsp;is situated in a valley 7 m. W. of Trail on the Columbia river&nbsp;and 8 m. N. of the international boundary. It has direct&nbsp;railroad communication with Trail and the Arrow lakes as well&nbsp;as with Northport and Spokane in the state of Washington.&nbsp;Rossland owes its importance to the immense deposits of iron&nbsp;and copper pyrites carrying gold, which occur in the vicinity.&nbsp;The best-known mines are the Le Roy, Centre Star and War&nbsp;Eagle. The city derives its electric light and power service&nbsp;from Bonnington Falls on the Kootenay river.</span></p>
