<p><span class="font0">of his son Alexis, in which it must be said with sorrow Peter seemed lost to all the feelings of a father. Alexis&nbsp;had undoubtedly given him great cause for dislike by&nbsp;identifying himself in every way with the retrogressive&nbsp;party. The unfortunate young man probably died under&nbsp;the &quot;infliction of torture. In 1721 Peter promulgated the&nbsp;celebrated ukaze (afterwards abrogated by Paul) that&nbsp;the sovereign had the right of naming his successor. On&nbsp;January 28, 1725, the great reformer was dead. An&nbsp;attempt to estimate his character has been made in the&nbsp;separate article assigned to him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the death of Peter the country was divided into two factions. The old reactionary party, the Golitzins, Dolgo-rukis, and others, were eager to proclaim Peter the son of&nbsp;Alexis, but those who had identified themselves with the&nbsp;reforms of the late sovereign were anxious that Catherine&nbsp;his widow, who had been crowned empress, should succeed.&nbsp;Menshikoff, the favourite of the late czar, who is said when&nbsp;a boy to have sold cakes in the streets of Moscow, became&nbsp;all-powerful at this period, and the reforms of Peter continued to be carried out. Catherine died in 1727 ; she&nbsp;appears to have been an indolent, good-natured woman,&nbsp;with but little capacity for government, and accordingly,&nbsp;throughout her short reign, was entirely controlled by&nbsp;others. She designated as her successor Peter the son of&nbsp;Alexis, and, in default of Peter and his issue, Anna, who&nbsp;had married the duke of Holstein, and Elizabeth, her&nbsp;daughters. The regency was exercised by a council consisting of tho two daughters, the duke of Holstein, Menshikoff,&nbsp;and seven or eight of the chief dignitaries of the empire.&nbsp;Menshikoff was still all-important ; he had obtained from&nbsp;Catherine her consent to a marriage between his daughter&nbsp;and the youthful czar. But his authority was gradually&nbsp;undermined by the Dolgorukis. The favourite of Peter&nbsp;the Great was first banished to his estates, and afterwards&nbsp;to Berezoff in Siberia, where he died in 1729. The Dol-gorukis were now in the ascendency, and the czar was&nbsp;betrothed to Natalia, one of that family. He showed&nbsp;every inclination to undo his grandfather’s work, and the&nbsp;court was removed to Moscow. Soon afterwards, however, in January 1730, the young prince died of smallpox. His last words as he lay on his death-bed were,&nbsp;“ Get ready the sledge ; I want to go to my sister,”—&nbsp;alluding to the Princess Natalia, the other child of Alexis,&nbsp;who had died three years previously. The only foreign&nbsp;event of importance in this reign was the attempt of&nbsp;Maurice of Saxony to get possession of Courland, by&nbsp;marrying the duchess Anna, then a widow. She consented to the union, and the states of the province&nbsp;elected him, but Menshikoff sent a body of troops who&nbsp;forced him to quit it. On the death of Peter at the age&nbsp;of fifteen, various claimants of the throne were put forward. The great czar had left two daughters, Elizabeth,&nbsp;and Anna, duchess of Holstein, who had a son, afterwards&nbsp;Peter III. Two daughters were also surviving of his&nbsp;eldest brother Ivan, Anna, the duchess of Courland, and&nbsp;Catherine, duchess of Mecklenburg. Alexis Dolgoruki&nbsp;even had an idea of claiming the crown for his daughter,&nbsp;because she had been betrothed to the young emperor.&nbsp;This proposal, however, was treated with derision, and the&nbsp;High Secret Council resolved to call to the throne Anna&nbsp;of Courland, thinking that, as she was so much more remote&nbsp;by birth than the daughters of Peter, she would more&nbsp;willingly submit to their terms. In fact, they had prepared for her signature something like the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">porta Conventa&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Poland. The following were the terms:—(1) the High&nbsp;Council was always to be composed of eight members, to&nbsp;be renewed by co-option, and the czarina must consult it&nbsp;on state affairs ; (2) without its consent she could neither&nbsp;make peace nor declare war, could not impose any tax,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">alienate any crown lands, or appoint to any office above that of a colonel ; (3) she could not cause to be condemned&nbsp;or executed any member of the nobility, nor confiscate the&nbsp;goods of any noble before he had a regular trial ; (4) she&nbsp;could not marry nor choose a successor without the consent of the council. In case she broke any of these stipulations she was to forfeit the crown (see Rambaud, p. 425).&nbsp;Anna assented to these terms and made her entry into&nbsp;Moscow, which was now to be the capital. But the empress was soon informed how universally unpopular these&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pacta conventa</span><span class="font0"> were, which in reality put Russia into the&nbsp;hands of a few powerful families, chiefly the Dolgorukis and&nbsp;Golitzins. She accordingly convened her supporters, and&nbsp;publicly tore the document to pieces, and thus ended the&nbsp;last attempt to give Russia a constitution. The new&nbsp;empress was a cold, repulsive woman, whose temper had&nbsp;been soured by indignities endured in her youth ; she&nbsp;took vengeance upon her opponents, and threw herself&nbsp;almost entirely into the hands of German advisers, especially Biren, a Courlander of low origin. This is the period&nbsp;called by the Russians the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bironovstchina.</span><span class="font0"> The country&nbsp;was now thoroughly exploited by tho Germans ; some of&nbsp;the leading Russians were executed, and others banished&nbsp;to Siberia. Among the former was the able minister&nbsp;Volinski, beheaded with two others in 1740. He had&nbsp;fallen under the wrath of the implacable Biren. One of&nbsp;the most important enactments of this reign was the&nbsp;abolition of the right of primogeniture introduced by&nbsp;Peter the Great, which had never been popular in the&nbsp;country. On the crown of Poland falling vacant in 1733,&nbsp;an attempt was again made to place Stanislaus Leszczynski&nbsp;on the throne, but it failed through the opposition of&nbsp;Russia, and Stanislaus escaped with difficulty from Dantzic.&nbsp;Upon this followed a war with Turkey, which lasted four&nbsp;years (1735-1739), in conjunction with Austria. This&nbsp;was not very successful, but the Russian generals gained&nbsp;possession of a few towns, and were indignant when the&nbsp;Austrians signed the treaty of Belgrade with the Turks&nbsp;(1739), and the campaign came to an end. In 1740 the&nbsp;empress Anna died ; she had reigned exactly ten years.&nbsp;She left the crown to Ivan, the son of her niece Anna,&nbsp;daughter of her sister Catherine, duchess of Mecklenburg.&nbsp;During the minority of this child Biren was to be regent.&nbsp;By a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">revolution de palais,</span><span class="font0"> however, the German adventurer&nbsp;was hurled from power and sent to Pelîm in Siberia.&nbsp;But matters did not rest here ; taking advantage of the&nbsp;general unpopularity of the German faction, the partisans&nbsp;of Elizabeth, the daughter of Peter the Great, were&nbsp;resolved to work their overthrow, and place her upon the&nbsp;throne. They consisted of Alexander and Peter Shuvaloff,&nbsp;Michael Vorontzoff, Razumovski, Schwarz, and a French&nbsp;surgeon named Lestocq. Elizabeth ingratiated herself&nbsp;into the favour of the soldiers, by whom the name of Peter&nbsp;the Great was still so much cherished. Anna Leopoldovna, as she was called, her husband Anthony Ulrich,&nbsp;the infant emperor, Munich, Ostermann, and the whole&nbsp;German faction were arrested in the night, and Elizabeth&nbsp;ascended the throne. Ivan VI. was imprisoned in the&nbsp;fortress of Schlüsselburg ; Anna, with her husband and&nbsp;children, was banished to Kholmogori near Archangel,&nbsp;where she died in 1746. Ostermann was banished to Bere-zoff, and Munich to Pelim ; they had both been previously&nbsp;sentenced to death. Biren and his family were now&nbsp;recalled and allowed to live at Yaroslavl. Elizabeth</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Petrovna (1741-1762) inaugurated the return of Russian influence in opposition to the Germans, from whom the&nbsp;country had suffered so much during the reign of Anna.&nbsp;The people were weary of them, yet they were, as we shall&nbsp;see, to have one German emperor more. On ascending&nbsp;the throne she summoned to her court the son of her sister</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
