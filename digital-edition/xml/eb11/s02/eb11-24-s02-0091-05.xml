The word is a combination of “salt’’ and “ saler,” assimilated in the 16th and 17th centuries to “cellar” (Lat. <hi rend="italic">cellarium,</hi> a storehouse). “ Saler ” is from the Fr.

New College, Oxford, possesses a magnificent specimen, dated 1493. Later salts take a square or cylindrical shape.

The “ trencher salts ” are either of triangular or circular shape, some are many-sided. The circular silver salt with legs came into use in the 18th century.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
