<p><span class="font1">with the remainder of the skeleton secondarily modified for aerial progression. Vertebrae not numerous, precœlous ; from three to six forming a sacrum ; cervical&nbsp;vertebræ exceeding in size the others. No neuro-central&nbsp;suture. Anterior ribs with bifurcate heads. Skull large,&nbsp;bird-like, with long jaws. Os quadratum suturally connected with the skull. Orbits very large, with a ring of&nbsp;sclerotic plates. Sternum broad, completely ossified, with&nbsp;a median crest anteriorly. Scapula and coracoid slender,&nbsp;Bird-like ; no clavicle. Phalanges of the ulnar digit&nbsp;exceedingly elongate. Pelvis weak ; hind limb smaller&nbsp;than fore limb. Bones generally hollow, many with&nbsp;pneumatic foramina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. a. Pterosauria. Jaws toothed ; scapula and coracoid separate. Genera : Pterodactylus, Rhamphorhynchus, Dimorphodon,&nbsp;from Jurassic formations of Europe ; of small or moderate size.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. b. Pteranodontia. Edentulous ; scapula and coracoid solidly united, the former articulating with the common neural&nbsp;spine of the vertebræ. Genus : Pteranodon, from Cretaceous strata&nbsp;of Kansas ; specimens with a spread of wing of some 20 feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order 5. Ckocodilia. Reptiles with Lizard-like body, and long powerful tail adapted for swimming. Limbs&nbsp;short, especially the anterior ; five digits in manus and&nbsp;four in pes ; only three of the digits are clawed. A dermal&nbsp;armour, consisting of flattened bony scutes, covers the&nbsp;back, and in some genera the abdomen. Teeth in a single&nbsp;row, implanted in distinct sockets. Nostrils generally at&nbsp;present; but a system of free abdominal ribs is developed.&nbsp;The pectoral arch consists of a pair of large coracoids,&nbsp;meeting in the median line, and clavicular elements&nbsp;extending from one scapula to the other. Pelvis large,&nbsp;with the ilia, pubes, and ischia not coalesced, and all&nbsp;sharing in the formation of the acetabulum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These characters may not fully apply to all the genera which have been referred to this order, as some are known&nbsp;from their skulls or other fragments only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best known are the Plesiosaurians (q.v.) proper Neusti-cosaurus, from the Trias, with paddles in front and ordinary limbs behind ; gigantic forms from the Trias, as Nothosaunis, Simo-saurus, Pistosaurus, or post-Triassic, as Plesiosaurus, and Plio-saurus, Polycotylus, and Elasmosaurus (or Discosaurus) from the&nbsp;Liasand Chalk.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order 7. Rhynciiocephalia. Lacertiform Reptiles, with four limbs. Vertebræ with flat ends ; two in the&nbsp;sacrum ; the tubercular and articular surfaces are united ;&nbsp;ribs single-headed. Os quadratum suturally united&nbsp;with the skull and pterygoid; an osseous infra-temporal&nbsp;bar. Foramen parietale present. Sternum and a system&nbsp;of abdominal ribs well developed. Copulatory organs&nbsp;absent ; urinary bladder present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One recent genus: Hatteria. Represented in the Upper Cretaceous</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> It is very doubtful whether Placodus, originally described as a Fish, belongs to this order.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">or near the end of the snout Vertebræ with the neurocentral suture persistent. Two sacral vertebræ only. The majority of the cervical and trunk ribs double-headed,&nbsp;attached to the diapophysis and centrum of the vertebræ.&nbsp;From seven to nine of the anterior dorsal ribs are united&nbsp;with the sternum by sternal ribs. Bones of the skull very&nbsp;solid, firmly united by sutures, as is also the quadrate&nbsp;bone. Heart with a double ventricle. Copulatory organ&nbsp;single, situated in the cloaca.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. a. (or suborder) Procœlia. With procœlous vertebræ. All living genera and the extinct forms down to the Chalk belong to&nbsp;this division.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. b. (or suborder) Amphicœlia. With amphiccelous vertebræ. All the genera are pre-Cretaceous : Teleosaurus, Goniopholis, Strep-tospondylus, Steganolepis, Galesaurus (?), Belodom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order C. Sauropterygia (extinct). Marine Reptiles with long neck, small head, long tail, natatory limbs, and&nbsp;a naked skin. Hind and fore limbs identical in structure&nbsp;and form, transformed into Cetacean-like paddles with five&nbsp;digits, which were composed of numerous phalanges and&nbsp;enclosed in a common skin. Teeth in a single row in both&nbsp;jaws, implanted in distinct sockets. Vertebræ amphicœl-ous, with the neuro-central suture persistent ; singleheaded ribs are attached to the long diapophyses of the&nbsp;dorsal vertebræ. Sacral vertebræ two. Quadrate bone&nbsp;Suturally united with the skull. A parietal foramen.&nbsp;No sclerotic ring. Neither sternal ribs nor sternum are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and Lower Eocene by Champsosaurus, in the Trias by Rhyncho-saurus, Hyperodapcdon, and in the Permian by Protcrosaurus, Sphenosaurus, Telerpeton (?), Saurosternum (?).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order 8. Lacertilia. Lizards. Vertebræ generally proccelous, with short or rudimentary transverse processes;&nbsp;sacral vertebræ not exceeding two ; ribs single-headed.&nbsp;Os quadratum articulated with the skull. Parts of the ali-and orbito-sphenoid regions fibro-cartilaginous. Temporal&nbsp;region without, or with only one, osseous bar. Limbs&nbsp;four, two, or absent ; when they are present, a sternum&nbsp;with sternal ribs and a pelvis are developed. Copulatory&nbsp;organs paired ; urinary bladder present. Integuments&nbsp;with horny or sometimes bony scutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the numerous recent genera see Lizards. Distinguidiable representatives of the order appear first in Jurassic formations and&nbsp;thence downward to our period : Acrosaums, Ardeosaunis, Pleuro-saurus, Saphdosaurus, Atoposaunis, and Homœosaurus from the&nbsp;Oolite ; Nuthetes, Saurillus, Macellodon from the Wealden ; Dolicho-saurus, Acteosaurus, Coniosaurus, Rhaphiosaunis from the Chalk.&nbsp;From Tertiary formations in Europe numerous small remains are&nbsp;known, whilst those described from Australia belonged to much&nbsp;larger forms, showing more or less affinities to the Lizards of the&nbsp;present Australian fauna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A distinct division of this order includes the extinct Mosasaurians, which arc, in fact, the Pinnipedes among&nbsp;Lacertilians. Their limbs, of which they had two pairs,&nbsp;are transformed into paddles; by their long Snake-like</span></p>
