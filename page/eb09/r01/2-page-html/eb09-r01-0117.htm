<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and legislation, the latter sometimes interpreted by the courts in a manner very different from the intention of&nbsp;parliament. The most important influence of equity has&nbsp;been exercised in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mortgage </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and trusts (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Trust),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in the doctrine of specific performance of contracts concerning real estate, and in relief from forfeiture for breach&nbsp;of covenant. As to legislation, it is impossible in this place&nbsp;to do more than direct attention to the main provisions of&nbsp;the principal statutes among the mass of those which from&nbsp;Magna Charta downwards have dealt with real estate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of Real Estate Legislation</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The reign of Edward I. is notable for three leading statutes which are still law,&nbsp;all passed in the interests of the superior lords. The&nbsp;Statute of Mortmain (7 Edw. I. st. 2, c. 13) is the first of&nbsp;a long series directed against the acquisition of land by&nbsp;religious and charitable corporations (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Charities). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The&nbsp;statute </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De Donis Conditionalibus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (13 Edw. I. c. 1) forbade&nbsp;the alienation of estates granted to a man and the heirs&nbsp;of his body, which before the statute became on the birth&nbsp;of an heir at once alienable (except in the case of gifts in&nbsp;frankmarriage), and so the lord lost his escheat. For the&nbsp;mode in which the statute was practically defeated and&nbsp;estates tail in their modern form created see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Entail.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The statute </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Quia Emptores</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (18 Edw. I. c. 1) preserved&nbsp;those rights of the lords which were up to that time subject to be defeated by subinfeudation, by enacting that in&nbsp;any alienation of lands the alienee should hold them of&nbsp;the same lord of the fee as the alienor.@@<sup>1</sup> Since 1290 it&nbsp;has been impossible to create an estate in fee-simple to be&nbsp;held of a mesne lord, or to reserve a rent upon a grant of&nbsp;an estate in fee (unless in the form of a rent-charge), or to&nbsp;create a new manor. The statute, however, does not bind&nbsp;the crown. The practical effect of the statute was to make&nbsp;the transfer of land thenceforward more of a commercial&nbsp;and less of a feudal transaction. The writ of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elegit</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> w<sup>r</sup>as&nbsp;introduced by the Statute of Westminster II. in 1285 as a&nbsp;creditor’s remedy over real estate. It has, however, been&nbsp;considerably modified by subsequent legislation. From&nbsp;1290 to the I’eign of Henry VIII. there is no statute of&nbsp;the first importance dealing with real estate. The reign&nbsp;of Henry VIII., like the reign of Edward I., is signalized&nbsp;by three Acts, the effects of which continue to this day.&nbsp;The one which has had the most lasting influence in law&nbsp;is the Statute of Uses, 27 Hen. VIII. c. 10 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Conveyancing, Trust). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Statute of Uses was intended to&nbsp;provide against secrecy of sales of land, and as a necessary&nbsp;sequel to it an Act of the same year (27 Hen. VIII. c. 16)&nbsp;enacted that all bargains and sales of land should be duly&nbsp;enrolled (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Sale). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Bargain and sale was a form of equitable transfer which had for some purposes superseded&nbsp;the common law feoffment. It applied only to estates&nbsp;of inheritance and not to terms of years. The unforeseen&nbsp;effect of 27 Hen. VIII. c. 16 was to establish as the&nbsp;ordinary form of conveyance until 1841 the conveyance&nbsp;by lease and release.@@<sup>2</sup> Uses having become legal estate&nbsp;by the Statute of Uses, and therefore no longer devisable, 32 Hen. VIII. c. 1 (explained by 34 and 35 Hen.&nbsp;VIII. c. 5) was passed to remedy this inconvenience.&nbsp;It is still law as to wills made before 1838 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Will).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the reign of Elizabeth the Acts of 13 Eliz. c. 5 and&nbsp;27 Eliz. c. 4 avoided fraudulent conveyances as against&nbsp;all parties and voluntary conveyances as against subsequent purchasers for valuable consideration. Early in&nbsp;the reign of Charles II. the Act of 1661 (12 Car. II.&nbsp;c. 24) turned all the feudal tenures (with the exception</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of frankalmoign and grand serjeanty) into tenure by free and common socage and abolished the feudal incidents.&nbsp;The Statute of Frauds (29 Car. II. c. 3) contained provisions that certain leases and assignments, and that all&nbsp;agreements and trusts relating to land, should be in writing&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Fraud). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The land registries of Middlesex and Yorkshire date from the reign of Anne (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Registration).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Devises of land for charitable purposes were forbidden by&nbsp;the Mortmain Act (9 Geo. II. c. 36). In the next reign&nbsp;the first general Inclosure Act was passed, 41 Geo. III.&nbsp;c. 109 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Commons). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the reign of William IV. were&nbsp;passed the Prescription, Limitation, and Tithe Commutation Acts (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Prescription, Limitation, Tithes) </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">; fines&nbsp;and recoveries were abolished and simpler modes of conveyance substituted by 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 74; and the&nbsp;laws of inheritance and dower were amended by 3 and&nbsp;4 Will. IV. cc. 105, 106 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Inheritance, Husband&nbsp;and Wife). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the reign of Victoria there has been a vast&nbsp;mass of legislation dealing with real estate in almost every&nbsp;conceivable aspect. At the immediate beginning of the&nbsp;reign stands the Wills Act (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Will). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The transfer of&nbsp;real estate has been simplified by 8 and 9 Viet. c. 106&nbsp;and by the Conveyancing Acts of 1881 and 1882 (see&nbsp;below). Additional powers of dealing with settled estates&nbsp;were given by the Settled Estates Act, 1856, later by the&nbsp;Settled Estates Act, 1877, and the Settled Land Act,&nbsp;1882 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Settlement). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Succession duty was levied for&nbsp;the first time on freeholds in 1853. The strictness of the&nbsp;Mortmain Act has been relaxed in favour of gifts and sales&nbsp;to public institutions of various kinds, such as schools,&nbsp;parks, and museums. The period of limitation has&nbsp;been shortened for most purposes from tw׳enty to twelve&nbsp;years by the Real Property Limitation Act, 1874 (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Limitation). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Several Acts have been passed dealing with&nbsp;the enfranchisement and commutation of copyholds and&nbsp;the preservation of commons and open spaces (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Commons, Copyhold). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The Naturalization Act, 1870 (33 and&nbsp;34 Viet. c. 14), enables aliens to hold and transfer land in&nbsp;England. The Felony Act, 1870 (33 and 34 Viet. c. 23),&nbsp;abolished forfeiture of real estate on conviction for felony.&nbsp;The Agricultural Holdings Act, 1883 (46 and 47 Viet. c.&nbsp;61), gives the tenant of a tenancy within the Act a general&nbsp;right to compensation for improvements, substitutes a&nbsp;year’s notice to quit for the six months’ notice previously&nbsp;necessary, enlarges the tenant’s right to fixtures, and limits&nbsp;distress to a year’s rent. By 47 and 48 Viet. c. 71 the&nbsp;law of escheat is extended to incorporeal hereditaments&nbsp;and equitable estates. Among other subjects which have&nbsp;been dealt with by recent legislation may be mentioned Re</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">gistration, Mortgage, Partition, Excambion, Fixtures&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(qq.vv.),</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> taking of land in execution, declaration of title,&nbsp;and apportionment. Not a year passes in which the land&nbsp;law is not altered to a greater or less degree. Bills have&nbsp;been introduced within recent years, but hitherto unsuccessfully, for amending the law by the assimilation of the succession to real and personal estate, and for the compulsory&nbsp;enfranchisement of leaseholds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Real estate at the present day is either legal or equitable, a difference resting mainly upon historical grounds (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Equity, Trust). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The following observations apply in general to both kinds of estate.&nbsp;The usual classification of interests in real estate regards either the&nbsp;extent, the time, or the mode of enjoyment. The division according to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">extent</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> is in the first instance into corporeal and incorporeal&nbsp;hereditaments, a division based upon the Roman law division of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">res</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> into </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">corporales</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">incorporales,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and open to the same objection,&nbsp;that it is unscientific as co-ordinating subjects of rights with the&nbsp;rights themselves.@@<sup>3</sup> Corporeal hereditaments, says Blackstone,&nbsp;“consist of such as affect the senses, such as may be seen and&nbsp;handled by the body ; incorporeal are not the objects of sensation,&nbsp;can neither be seen nor handled, are creatures of the mind, and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tenants in chief of the crown were liable to a fine on alienation&nbsp;until 12 Car. II. c. 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;"><sup>@@@2</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the reign of Edward IV. at latest up to the Fines and Recoveries Act of 1833 fines and recoveries were also recognized as a&nbsp;means of conveyance. They are so regarded in the Statute of Uses.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@3</sup> In spite of this objection the division is adopted by the legislature ; see, for instance, 47 and 48 Viet. c. 71.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
