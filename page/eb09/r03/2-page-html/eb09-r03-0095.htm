<p><span class="font1">results of the conditions amid which it took shape. The separation of the civil from the military power has entirely&nbsp;disappeared. This is proved by the fact that, after the&nbsp;year 600, there is no further mention of the prefect.&nbsp;His office still survived, but with a gradual change of&nbsp;functions, until, in the 8th century, he once more appears&nbsp;as president of a criminal tribunal. The constitution of&nbsp;the duchy and of the new republic formed during the wars&nbsp;with the IjOmbards and the exarch was substantially of an&nbsp;aristocratico-military nature. At its head was the duke,&nbsp;first elected by the emperor, then by the pope and the&nbsp;people, and, as his strength and influence grew with&nbsp;those of the commune, he gradually became the most&nbsp;respected and powerful personage iu Rome. The duke&nbsp;inhabited the palace of the Cæsars on the Palatine Hill,&nbsp;and had both the civil and the military power in his&nbsp;hands ; he was at the head of the army, which, being&nbsp;composed of the best citizens and highest nobility of&nbsp;Rome, was a truly national force. This army was styled&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">felicissimus</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jlorens exercitus Romanus</span><span class="font1"> or also the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">militia Romana.</span><span class="font1"> Its members never lost their citizen&nbsp;stamp ; on the contrary they formed the true body of the&nbsp;citizens. We find mention of other </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">duxes</span><span class="font1"> in Rome, but&nbsp;these were probably other leaders or superior officers of&nbsp;the army. Counts and tribunes are found in the subject&nbsp;cities bound to furnish aid to the capital. In fact during&nbsp;the pontificate of Sergius II. (844), when the duchy was&nbsp;threatened by a Saracenic invasion, they were requested&nbsp;to send troops to defend the coast, and as many soldiers&nbsp;as possible to the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At that time the inhabitants of Rome were divided into four principal classes—clergy, nobles, soldiers, and simple&nbsp;citizens. The nobles were divided into two categories,&nbsp;first the genuine </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">optimates, i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> members of old and wealthy&nbsp;families with large estates, and filling high, and often&nbsp;hereditary, offices in the state, the church, and the army.&nbsp;These were styled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">proceres</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">primates.</span><span class="font1"> The second&nbsp;category comprised landed proprietors, of moderate means&nbsp;but exalted position, mentioned as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nobiles</span><span class="font1"> by Gregory L,&nbsp;and constituting in fact a numerous petty nobility and the&nbsp;bulk of the army. Next followed the citizens, i.e., the&nbsp;commercial class, merchants, and craftsmen, who, having&nbsp;as yet no fixed organization and but little influence, were&nbsp;simply designated as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">honxsti cives.</span><span class="font1"> These, however, were&nbsp;quite distinct from the plebeians, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs, vulgus populi, viri&nbsp;humiles,</span><span class="font1"> who in their turn ranked above bondsmen and&nbsp;slaves. The honesti cives did not usually form part of the&nbsp;army, and were only enrolled in it in seasons of emergency.&nbsp;Nevertheless the army was not only national, but became&nbsp;increasingly democratic, so that in the IOth century it&nbsp;included every class of inhabitants except churchmen and&nbsp;slaves. At that period we sometimes find the whole&nbsp;people designated as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">exercitus,</span><span class="font1"> those actually under&nbsp;arms being distinguished as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">militia exercitus Romani.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">This again was divided into bands or “ numbers,” t.β.,&nbsp;regiments, and also, in a manner peculiar to Rome, into&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">scholae militurn.</span><span class="font1"> These scholae were associations derived&nbsp;from antiquity, gaining strength and becoming more&nbsp;general in the Middle Ages as the central power of the&nbsp;state declined. There were scholae of notaries, of church&nbsp;singers, and of nearly every leading employment; there&nbsp;were scholae of foreigners of diverse nationalities, of&nbsp;Franks, Lombards, Greeks, Saxons, Ac. Even the trades&nbsp;and crafts began to form scholae. These were at first&nbsp;very feeble institutions, and only later gained importance&nbsp;and became guilds. As early as the 8th century there&nbsp;vzere scholae militurn in the army, which was thus doubly&nbsp;divided. But we have no precise definition of their functions. They were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> corporations with separate property, churches, and magistrates of their own. The latter&nbsp;were always optimates, and guarded the interests of the&nbsp;army. But the real chiefs of the bands or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">numeri</span><span class="font1"> were&nbsp;the duces or tribunes, and under the Franks the latter&nbsp;became comités. These chiefs were styled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">magnijici&nbsp;consules, optimates de militia,</span><span class="font1"> often too </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pudixes de militia,</span><span class="font1"> since, as was the custom of the Middle Ages, they&nbsp;wielded political and judicial as well as military authority.&nbsp;The title of consul was now generally given to superior&nbsp;officers, whether civil or military. The importance of the&nbsp;scholae militurn began to decline in the IOth century;&nbsp;towards the middle of the 12th they disappeared altogether, and, according to Papencordt, were last mentioned&nbsp;in 1145. It is probable that the scholae militurn signified&nbsp;local divisions of the army, corresponding with the city&nbsp;wards, which were twelve in number during the IOth and&nbsp;Ilth centuries, then increased to thirteen, and occasionally to fourteen. It is certain that from the beginning&nbsp;the army was distributed under twelve flags; after the&nbsp;scholae had disappeared, we find it classified in districts,&nbsp;which were subdivided into companies. The division of&nbsp;cities into quarters, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sestieri</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rwni,</span><span class="font1"> corresponding with&nbsp;that of the army, and also with that of the municipal&nbsp;government, was the common practice of Florence, Siena,&nbsp;and almost all the Italian communes. But, while usually&nbsp;losing importance as the guilds acquired power, in Rome&nbsp;the insignificance of the guilds added to the strength of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regioni</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rwni,</span><span class="font1"> which not only became part of the&nbsp;army but finally grasped the reins of government. This&nbsp;was a special characteristic of the political constitution of&nbsp;the Roman commune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We now come to a question of weightier import for <sup>ι </sup>all desiring to form a clear idea of the Roman government at that period. What had become of the senate ?&nbsp;It had undoubtedly lost its original character now that&nbsp;the empire was extinct. But, after much learned discussion, historical authorities are still divided upon the&nbsp;subject. Certain Italian writers of the 18th century—&nbsp;Vendettini, for example—asserted with scanty critical&nbsp;insight that the Roman senate did not disappear in&nbsp;the Middle Ages. The same opinion backed </span><span class="font0">by </span><span class="font1">much&nbsp;learned research was maintained by the great German&nbsp;historian Savigny. And Leo, while denying the persistence of the curia in Lombard Italy, adhered to&nbsp;Savigny’s views as regarded Rome. Papencordt did the&nbsp;same, but held the Roman senate to be no more than a&nbsp;curia. This judgment was vigorously contested, first by&nbsp;Hegel and Giesebrecht, then by Gregorovius. These&nbsp;writers believe that after the middle of the 6th century&nbsp;the senate had a merely nominal existence. According&nbsp;to Gregorovius its last appearance was in the year 579.&nbsp;After that date it is mentioned in no documents, and the&nbsp;chroniclers are either equally silent or merely allude to its&nbsp;decay and extinction. In the 8th century, however, the&nbsp;terms </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">senator, senαtores, senatus</span><span class="font1"> again reappear. We&nbsp;find letters addressed to Pippin, beginning thus : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Omvis&nbsp;senatus atque Universi populi geηeralitas.</span><span class="font1"> When Leo III.&nbsp;returned from Germany he was met by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tam proceres cleri-corum cum omnibus clericis, quamque optimates et senatus,&nbsp;Cunctaque militia</span><span class="font1"> (see Anastasius, in Muratori, vol. iii.&nbsp;198 c). But it has been noted that the senate was never&nbsp;found to act as a political assembly ; on occasions when it&nbsp;might have been mentioned in that capacity we hear&nbsp;nothing of it, and only meet with it in ceremonials and&nbsp;purely formal functions. Hence the conclusion that the&nbsp;term senator was used in the sense of noble, senatus of&nbsp;nobility, and no longer referred to an institution but&nbsp;only to a class of the citizens. Even when we find that&nbsp;Otho III. (who sought to revive all the ancient institutions of Rome) addressed an edict to the “ Consuls and&nbsp;Senate of Rome,” and read that the laws of St Stephen</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
