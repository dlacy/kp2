                said to have followed in sequence but overlapped each other.&nbsp;The same sequence
                is observable in the history of the laws&nbsp;of other nations, the later system
                gradually gaining ground&nbsp;upon the earlier and eventually superseding
                    it.<sup>@@2</sup> The remarkable thing in Rome is that private vengeance should
                so long&nbsp;not only have left its traces but continued to be an active&nbsp;power.
                According to tradition it was an admitted right of&nbsp;the gens or kinsmen of a
                murdered man in the days of Numa;&nbsp;a law of his is said to have provided that,
                where a homicide&nbsp;was due to misadventure, the offering to them of a ram

                >{supra,</span><span class="font0"> p. 533). And this seems to have been&nbsp;also
                prescribed in the XII. Tables (VIII., 24). To avenge the&nbsp;death of a kinsman was
                more than a right: it was a religious&nbsp;duty, for his </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">manes</span><span class="font0"> had to be appeased; and
                so strongly was&nbsp;this idea entertained that, even long after the state
                had&nbsp;interfered and made murder a matter of public prosecution,&nbsp;a kinsman
                was so imperatively bound to set it in motion that&nbsp;if he failed he was not
                permitted to take anything of the&nbsp;inheritance of the deceased. The talion we
                read of in the&nbsp;XII. Tables is also redolent of the </span><span class="font0"

                often attended it, be said to have&nbsp;savoured more of private vengeance than
                either punishment&nbsp;or procedure in reparation.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Expiatio, supplicium, sacratio
                capitis,</span><span class="font0"> all suggest offences against the gods rather
                than against either an individual or the state. But it is&nbsp;difficult to draw the
                line between different classes of offences, and predicate of one that it was a .sin,
                of another that it was a crime and of a&nbsp;third that it was but civil injury.
                They ran into each other in a way&nbsp;that is somewhat perplexing. Apparently the
                majority of those&nbsp;specially mentioned in the so-called </span><span

                other records of&nbsp;the regal period were regarded as violations of divine law,
                and the&nbsp;punishments appropriate to them determined upon that footing.&nbsp;Yet
                in many of them the prosecution was left to the state or to&nbsp;private
                individuals. It is not clear, indeed, that there was any&nbsp;machinery for public
                prosecution except in treason and murder—&nbsp;the former because it was essentially
                a state offence, the latter&nbsp;because it was comparatively early deemed expedient
                to repress the&nbsp;blood-feud, which was apt to lead to deplorable results when
                clansmen&nbsp;and neighbours appeared to defend the alleged assassin.</span></p>

                ploughing&nbsp;up or removal of a boundary stone, the slaughter of a
                plough-ox—&nbsp;all these were capital offences; the offender, by the formula

                class="font0"> was usually coupled with forfeiture of the offender’s estate&nbsp;or

                be doubted; no community has ever been&nbsp;so happy as to know nothing of thefts,
                robberies and assaults.&nbsp;The XII. Tables contained numerous provisions in
                reference to&nbsp;them; but it is extremely probable that, down at least to the
                time&nbsp;of Servius Tullius, the manner of dealing with them rested on&nbsp;custom,
                and was in the main self-redress, restrained by the intervention of the king when it
                appeared to him that the injured party&nbsp;was going beyond the bounds of fair
                reprisal, and frequently bought&nbsp;off with a composition. When the offence was

                    been generally supreme in both. But this can be&nbsp;accepted only with
                    considerable reservation. For the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"
                    style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0">, aided by a
                    council in cases of importance,&nbsp;was judge within the family—his
                    jurisdiction sometimes excluding&nbsp;that of the state, at other times
                    concurring with it, and not to&nbsp;be stayed even by an acquittal pronounced by
                    it. He alone was&nbsp;competent in any charge against a member of tnc family for
                    a crime&nbsp;or. offence against the domestic order—adultery or unchastity
                    of&nbsp;wife or daughter, undutiful behaviour of children or clients, or
                    the&nbsp;like. Death, slavery, banishment, expulsion from the family,
                    imprisonment, chains, stripes, withdrawal of </span><span class="font0"
                    style="font-style:italic;">pecutium,</span><span class="font0"> were all at
                    his&nbsp;command as punishments; and it may readily be assumed that
                    in&nbsp;imposing them he was freer to take account of moral guilt than
                    an&nbsp;outside tribunal. The indications of criminal jurisdiction on
                    the&nbsp;part of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >gens</span><span class="font0"> are slight; but its organization was such that
                    it is&nbsp;difficult not to believe that it must occasionally have been called
                    on&nbsp;to exercise such functions. And it must not be* lost sight of
                    that,&nbsp;as.murder seems to have been the only crime in regard to
                    which&nbsp;private revenge was absolutely excluded, the judicial office of
                    the&nbsp;kings must have been, considerably lightened, public opinion approving
                    and not condemning self-redress so long as it was kept within the&nbsp;limits
                    set by usage and custom.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">The boundary between civil and criminal jurisdiction, if it
                    existed at all, was extremely shadowy. Theft and robbery, for example, if one
                    may conclude from the position they held in the later jurisprudence, were
                    regarded not as public but as private wrongs;&nbsp;and yet when a thief was
                    caught in the act of theft by night he&nbsp;might be slain, and when by day
                    might be scourged and thereafter sold&nbsp;as a slave. But in both cases it may
                    also be assumed that a practice,&nbsp;afterwards formally sanctioned by the XII.
                    Tables—that of the&nbsp;thief compounding for his life or freedom—was early
                    admitted, and&nbsp;the right of self-redress thus made much more beneficial to
                    the&nbsp;party wronged than when nothing was attained but vengeance on&nbsp;the
                    wrongdoer. In assaults, non-manifest thefts, and other minor&nbsp;wrongs,
                    self-interest would in like manner soon lead to the general&nbsp;adoption of the
                    practice of compounding; what was originally, a&nbsp;matter of option in time
                    came to be regarded as a right; and with&nbsp;it there would be occasional
                    difficulty in settling the amount of the&nbsp;composition, and consequent
                    necessity of an appeal to a third party.&nbsp;Here seems to be the origin of the
                    king’s jurisdiction in&nbsp;matters of this sort. He was the natural person to
                    whom&nbsp;to refer such a dispute; for he alone, as supreme magistrate, had the
                    power to use coercion to prevent the party wronged&nbsp;insisting on his right
                    of self-redress, in face of a tender by the&nbsp;wrongdoer of what had been
                    declared to be sufficient reparation. But that self-redress was not stayed if
                    the reparation found&nbsp;due was withheld; as the party wronged was still
                    entitled at a&nbsp;much later period to wreak his vengeance upon the wrongdoer
                    by&nbsp;apprehending and imprisoning him, it cannot reasonably be
                    doubted&nbsp;that such also was the practice of the regal period.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">How far the kings exercised jurisdiction in questions of
                    quiritarian right, such as disputes about property or inheritance, is by
                    no&nbsp;means obvious. Within the family, of course, such questions&nbsp;were
                    impossible, though between clansmen they may have been&nbsp;settled by the
                    gews.or its chief. The words of style used in the&nbsp;sacramental real action
                    </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{infra,</span><span
                    class="font0"> p. 548) suggest that there must have&nbsp;been a time, when the
                    spear was the arbiter, and when the contending parties, backed possibly by their
                    clansmen or friends, were&nbsp;actual combatants, and victory’ decided the
                    right. Such a procedure could not long survive the institution of a state. In
                    Rome&nbsp;there seems to have been very early substituted for it what
                    from&nbsp;its general complexion one would infer was a submission of
                    the&nbsp;question of right to the pontiffs as the repositories of legal
                    lore.&nbsp;Their proper functions, however, being sacred, they had to
                    bring&nbsp;what was a question of purely civil right within their
                    jurisdiction,&nbsp;by engrafting on it a sacral element, viz. by requiring each
                    of the&nbsp;parties to make oath to the verity of his contention; and the
                    point&nbsp;that in form they decided was which of the two oaths was false
                    and&nbsp;therefore to be made atonement for. In substance, however, it&nbsp;was
                    a finding on the real question at issue; and the party in whose&nbsp;favour it
                    was pronounced was free to make it effectual if necessary&nbsp;by self-redress
                    in the ordinary way.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">Of Servius, Dionysius says—using, as he often does, language more
                    appropriate to the republican than to the regal period—that&nbsp;he drew a line
