There remained now but one obſtacle to his ambition, which was Antony, whom lie reſolved to remove, and for that purpoſe began to render his character as contemptible as he poſſibly could at Rome. In fact, Antony’s conduct did not a little contribute to promote the endeavours of his ambitions partner in the ſtate. He had marched againſt the Parthians with a prodigious army; but was forced to return with the loſs of the fourth part of his forces, and all his baggage *. This extremely diminiſhed his reputation; but his making a triumphal entry into Alexandria ſoon after, entirely diſguſted the citizens of Rome. However, Antony ſeemed quite regardleſs of their reſentment: totally diſregarding the buſineſs of the ſtate, he ſpent whole days and nights in the company of Cleopatra, who ſtudied every art to increaſe his paſſion, and vary his entertainments. Not contented with ſharing in her company all the delights which Egypt could afford, Antony was reſolved to enlarge his ſphere of luxury, by granting her many of thoſe kingdoms which belonged to the Roman empire. He gave her all Phoenicia, Celo-Syria, and Cyprus; with a great part of Cilicia, Arabia, and Judea; gifts which he had no</p><p>-right to beſtow, but which he pretended to grant in imitation of Hercules. This complication of vice and ſolly at length totally exaſperated the Romans ; and Octavianus, willing to take advantage of their reſentment, took care to exaggerate aſt his defects. At 'length, when he found the people fuſſiciently irritated againſt him, he reſolved to ſend Octavia, who was then at Rome, to Antony, as if with a view of reclaiming Tier huſhand; but, in fact, to furniſh a ſufficient pretext of declaring war againſt him, a8 he knew ſhe would be diſmiſſed with contempt.</p><p>Antony was now in the city of Leucopolis, revelling with his inſidious paramour, when he heard that Octavia was at Athens, upon her journey to viſit him. This •was very unwelcome news to him as well as to Cleopatra ; who, fearing the charms of her rival, endeavoured , to convince Antony of the ſtrength of her paſſion. He frequently caught her in tears, which ſhe ſeemed as if willing to hide; and often intreated her to tell him the cauſe, which ſhe ſeemed willing to ſuppreſs. Theſe artifices, together with the ceaſeleſs flattery and importunity of her creatures, prevailed ſo much upon Antony’s weakneſs, that he commanded Octavia to return home without ſeeing her, and attached himſelf ſtill more cloſely to Cleopatra than before. His ridiculous paſſion now began to have no bounds. He reſolved to own her ſor his wiſe, and entirely to repudiate Octavia. He accordingly aſſembled the people of Alexandria in the public theatre, where was raiſed an alcove of ſilver, under which were placed two thrones of gold, one for himſelſ and the other for Cleopatra. There he ſeated himſelf, dreſſed like Bacchus, while .Cleopatra ſat beſide him clothed in the ornaments and attributes of lſis, the principal deity of the Egyptians. On that occaſion he declared her queen of all the countries which hc had already beſtowed uponher; while he aſſociated Gæfa-rio, her ſon by Cæſar, as her partner in the government. To the two children which he had by her himſelf he gave the title of <hi rend="italic">king of kings,</hi>  with very extenſive do</p><p>minions ; and, to crown his abſurdities, he ſent a ml· nute account of his proceedings to the two conſuls at Rome. It was now neceſſary to act up to his imaginary dignity ; new Luxuries and pageantries were now therefore ſtudied, and new marks of profuſion found out : not leſs than 6o&gt;oool.∙of our money were laviſhed upon one ſingle entertainment; it is ſaid, upon this occaſion, that Cleopatra diſſolved a pearl of great value in •vinegar, and drank it off. But wo are told of one circumſtance that might well repreſs their delights, and teach mankind to reliſh the beverage of virtue, however ſimple, above their greateſt luxuries. He was ſuſpicious of being poiſoned in every meal ; he feared Gleopatra, whom he ſo much loved, and would eat nothing without having it previouſly taſted by one of his attendants.</p><p>In the mean time Octavianus had now a ſufficient pretext for declaring war; and informed the ſenate of his intentions. However, he deferred the execution of his deſign for a while, being then employed in quelling an inſurrection of the Illyrians. The following year was chiefly taken up in preparations againſt Antony, who, perceiving his deſign, remonſtrated to the ſenate, that he had many cauſes of complaint againſt his colleague, who had ſeized upon Sicily without offering him a ſhare ; alleging that he had alſo diſpoſſeſſed Lepidus, and kept to himſelf the province he had commanded ; and that he had divided all Italy among his own ſoldiers, leaving nothing to recompenſe thoſe in Aſia. To this complaint Octavianus was contented to make a ſar-caſtic anſwer ; implying, that it was abſurd to complain of his diſtribution of a few trifling diſtricts in Italy, when Antony having conquered Parthia, he might now reward his ſoldiers with cities and provinces. The ſar-caſm upon Antony’s misfortunes in Parthia ſo provoked him, that he ordered Canidius, who commanded his army, to march without intermiſſion into Europe ; while he and Cleopatra followed to Samos, in order to prepare for carrying on the war with vigour. When arrived there, it was ridiculous enough to behold the odd mixture of preparations for pleaſure and for war. Gn one ſide all the kings and princes from Europe to the Euxine ſea had orders to ſend him thither ſupplies both of men, proviſions, and arms ; on the other lide, all the comedians, dancers, buffoons, and muſicians of Greece, were ordered to attend him. Thus, frequently, when a ſhip was thought to arrive laden with ſoldiers, arms, and ammunition, it was found only filled with players and theatrical machinery. When news was expected of the approach of an army, meſſengers only arrived with tidings of a freſh quantity of veniſon. The kings who attended him endeavoured to gain hie favour more by their entertainments than their warlike preparations ; the provinces ſtrove rather to pleaſe him by ſacriſicing to his divinity, than by their alacrity in his defence ; ſo that ſome were heard to ſay, “ What rejoicings would not this man make for a victory, when he thus triumphs at the eve of a dangerous war!” In ſhort, his beſt friends now began to forſake his intereſts.</p><p>His delay at Samos, and afterwards at Athens, where he carried Cleopatra to receive new honours, was extremely favourable to the arms of Octavianus. This general was at firſt ſcarcely in a diſpoſition to oppoſe him, had he gone into Italy ; but hc ſoon found time</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
