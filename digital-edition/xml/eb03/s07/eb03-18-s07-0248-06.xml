(Dr Thomas), an excellent Engliſh phyſician, was the ſon of William Sydenham of Winford Eagle in Dorſetſhire, and was born there about the year 1624. He studied at Magdalen-hall, Oxford ; but left that univerſity when Oxford was garrisoned for king Charles I. and went to London : where, becoming acquainted with Dr Thomas Cox, an eminent phyſician, that gentleman persuaded him to apply himſelf to the ſtudy of phyſic ; accordingly, after the garrison was delivered up to the parliament, he retired again to Magdalen-hall, entered on the ſtudy of medicine, and in 1648 was created bachelor of phyſic. Soon after, he was made a fellow of All-Souls college, and continued there ſeveral years : when, leaving the university, he ſettled at Weſtminſter, became doctor of his faculty at Cambridge ; grew famous for his practice ; and was the chief phyſician in London from the year 1660 to 1670 ; at which period he began to be diſabled by the gout. He died in 1689. His works are highly eſteemed both at home and abroad. He was famous for his cool regimen in the ſmall- pox ; for giving the bark after the paroxysm in agues ; and<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0255.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0249"/>
for his uſe of laudanum. He regulated his practice more by his own obſervations and inquiries, than by the method either of his predeceſſors or contemporaries.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
