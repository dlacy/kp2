Dr. Simeon claimed our notice as a mathematician ; and his affectionate admiration of the ancient analysis is the prominent feature of his literary character. By this he is known all over Europe ; and his name is never mentioned by any foreign author without some very honourable allusion to his distinguished geometrical elegance and skill. Dr. James Moor, professor of Greek in the University of Glasgow, no less eminent for his knowledge in ancient geometry than for his professional talents, put the following apposite inscription below a portrait of Dr. Simson : “ Geometriam, sub Tyranno barbaro sæva servitute diu squalentem, in libertatem et decus antiquum vindicavit unus.”</p><p>Yet it must not be understood that Dr. Simeon’s predilection for the geometrical analysis of the ancients did so far mislead him as to make him neglect' the symbolical analysis of the present times ; on the contrary, he was completely master of it, as has been already observed, and frequently employed it. In his academical lectures to the students of his upper classes, he used to point out its proper province, which he by no means limited by a scanty boundary, and in what cases it might be applied with safety and advantage even to questions of pure geometry. He once honoured the writer of this article with the sight of a very short dissertation on this subject, perhaps the one referred to in the preface to his <hi rend="italic">conic Sections.</hi> In this piece he was perhaps more liberal than the most zealous partizans of the symbolical analysis could desire, admitting <hi rend="italic">p* C as</hi> a sufficient equation of the Conic Sections L=-<hi rend="subscript">5</hi>-, where</p><p>L is the <hi rend="italic">latus rectum, x</hi> is the distance of any point of the curve from the focus, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the perpendicular drawn from the focus to the tangent in the given point, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is the chord of the equicurve circle drawn through the focus. Unfortunately this dissertation was not found amongst his papers. He spoke in high terms of the analytical works of Cotes, and of the two Bernoullis. He was consulted by Mr. Mac- laurin during the progress of his inestimable <hi rend="italic">Treatise of Fluxions,</hi> and contributed not a little to the reputation of that work. The spirit of that most ingenious algebraic demonstration of the fluxions of a rectangle, and the very process of the argument, is the same with Dr. Simson’s in his dissertation on the limits of quantities. It was therefore from a thorough acquaintance with the subject, and by a just taste, that he was induced to prefer his favourite analysis, or, to speak more properly, to exhort mathematicians to employ it in his own sphere, and not to become ignorant of geometry, while he successively employed the symbolical analysis in cases which did not require it, and which suffered by its admission. It must be acknowledged, however, that in his later years, the disgust which he felt at the artificial and slovenly employment on subjects of pure geometry, sometimes hindered him from even looking at the most refined and ingenious improvements of the algebraic analysis which occur in the writings of Euler, D’Alembert, and other eminent masters. But, when properly informed of them, he never failed to give them their due praise ; and we remember him speaking, in terms of great satisfaction, of an improvement of the infinitesmal calculus, by D’Alembert and D’Lagrange, in their researches concerning the propagation of sound, and the vibration of musical cords.</p><p>And that Dr. Simson was not only master of this calculus and the symbolical calculus in general, but held them in proper esteem, appears from two valuable dissertations to be found in his posthumous works ; the one on logarithms, and the other on the limits of ratios. The last, in particular, shows how completely he was satisfied with respect to the solid foundation of the method of fluxions ; and it contains an elegant and strict demonstration of all the applications</p><p>which have been made of the method by its illustrious author to the objects of pure geometry.</p><p>We hoped to have given a much more complete and instructive account of this eminent geometer and his works, by the aid of a person fully acquainted with both, and able to appreciate their value ; but an accident has deprived us of this assistance, when it was too late to procure an equivalent. And we must request our readere to accept of this very imperfect account, since we cannot do justice to Dr. Simson’s merit unless almost equally conversant in all the geometry of the ancient Greeks.</p><p>The life of a literary man rarely teems with anecdote ; and a mathematician, devoted to his studies, is perhaps more abstracted than any other person from the ordinary occurrences of life, and even the ordinary topics of conversation. Dr. Simson was of this class ; and, having never married, lived entirely a college life. Having no occasion for the commodious house to which his place in the university entitled him, he contented himself with chambers, good, indeed, and spacious enough for his sober accommodation, and for receiving his choice collection of mathematical writers, but without any decoration or commodious furniture. His official servant sufficed for valet, footman, and chamber-maid. As this retirement was entirely devoted to study, he entertained no company in his chambers, but in a neighbouring house, where his apartment was sacred to him and his guests.</p><p>Having in early life devoted himself to the restoration of the works of the ancient geometers, he studied them with unremitting attention ; and, retiring from the promiscuous intercourse of the world, he contented himself with a small society of intimate friends, with whom he could lay aside every restraint of ceremony or reserve, and indulge in all the innocent frivolities of life. Every Friday evening was spent in a party at whist, in which he excelled, and took delight in instructing others, till increasing years made him less patient with the dulness of a scholar. The card-party was followed by an hour or two dedicated solely to playful conversation. In like manner, every Saturday he had a less select party to dinner at a house about a mile from town. The Doctor’s long life gave him occasion to see the <hi rend="italic">dramatis persona</hi> of this little theatre completely changed, whilst he continued to give it a personal identity ; so that, without any design or wish of his own, it became, as it were, his own house and his own family, and went by his name.</p><p>Dr. Simson was of a good stature, with a fine countenance ; and even in his old age he had a graceful carriage and manner, and always, except when in mourning, dressed in light coloured clothes. He was of a cheerful disposition ; and though he did not make the first advances to acquaintance, had the most affable manner, and strangers were at perfect ease in his company. He enjoyed a long course of uninterrupted health ; but toward the close of life suffered from an acute disease, and was obliged to employ an assistant in his professional labours for a few years preceding his death, which happened in 1768, at the age of eighty-one. He left to the university his valuable library, which is now arranged apart from the rest of the books, and the public use of it is limited by particular rules. It is considered as the most choice collection of mathematical books and manuscripts in the kingdom, and many of them are rendered doubly valuable by Dr. Simson’s notes.	<hi rend="smallcaps">(b.b.b.)</hi></p><p>SINAI, a celebrated mountain of Arabia, near the head of the Red sea, the place whence the divine law was given by Moses.
