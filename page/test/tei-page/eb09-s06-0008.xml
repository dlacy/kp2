            <p>the Rose-coloured Starling, which is not an unfrequent visitor to the British
                Islands. It is a bird of most irregular and erratic habits—a vast horde suddenly
                arriving at some place to which it may have hitherto been a stranger, and at once
                making a settlement there, leaving it wholly deserted as soon as the young are
                reared. This happened in the summer of 1875 at Villafranca, in the province of
                Verona, the castle of which was occupied in a single day by some 12,000 or 14,000
                birds of this species, as has been graphically told by Sig. de Betta <hi

                    rend="superscript">1</hi> but similar instances have been before recorded,—as in
                Bulgaria in 1867, near Smyrna in 1856, and near Odessa in 1844, to mention only some

            <p>STARODUB, a district town of Russia, in the government of Tchernigoff, 116 miles to
                the north-east of that town, on the marshy banks of a small tributary of the
                navigable Sudost. It is regularly built, with broad straight streets, the houses
                being surrounded by large gardens. Its 23,890 inhabitants—Little Russian descendants
                of former Cossacks, with about 5000 Jews—support themselves chiefly by gardening and
                agriculture. Tanning is also carried on, and the trade in corn and hemp exported to
                Riga and St Petersburg has some importance.</p>
            <p>Starodub at one time played a prominent part in the history of the Ukraine. As early
                as the 11th and 12th centuries it was a bone of contention between different Russian
                princes, who appreciated the value of its strategic position. The Mongols seem to
                have destroyed it, and its name does not reappear till the 14th century. During the
                15th and 16th centuries the Russians and Lithuanians were continually disputing the
                possession of its fortress, and at the beginning of the 17th century it became a
                stronghold of Poland.</p>
            <p>STARO-KONSTANTINOFF, a district town of Russia, in the government of Volhynia,
                situated 121 miles to the west-south-west of Zhitomir. It is an old-fashioned,
                poorly built town, dating from the 16th century, and is often mentioned in history
                in connexion with the rising of Cossacks under Bogdan Khmelnitzky. Owing to its
                excellent position close to the Austrian frontier and its railway communication with
                south-west Russia, it has a very active trade in corn, cattle, and salt with
                Austria, Prussia, and Poland. Its population (17,980 in 1884, of whom two-thirds
                were Jews) is rapidly increasing.</p>
            <p>STASSFURT, a town in the Prussian province of Saxony, and one of the chief seats of
                the German salt- producing industry, is situated on both sides of the Bode, 19 miles
                to the south-west of Magdeburg. Although saline springs are mentioned here as early
                as the 13th century, the first attempt to bore for salt was not made until 1839,
                while the systematic exploitation of the salt- beds, to which the town is indebted
                for its prosperity, dates only from 1856. The shafts reached deposits of salt nt a
                depth of 850 feet, but the finer and purer layers lie more than 1100 feet below the
                surface. Besides the rock-salt, which is excavated by blasting, the saline deposits
                of Stassfurt yield a considerable quantity of deliquescent salts and other saline
                products, which have encouraged the foundation of numerous chemical factories in the
                town and in the neighbouring village of Leopoldshall, which stands upon Anhalt
                territory. The formation of the Stassfurt salt-beds and the composition of the rock-
                salt are described under <hi rend="smallcaps">Salt</hi> (vol. xxi. pp. 231, 232).
                The rock-salt works are mainly Government property, while</p>
            <p>the chemical factories are in private hands. About 2000 workmen are employed in the
                Stassfurt salt industry, and about 490,000 tons of raw salt are annually excavated.
                The population of the town, which contains one or two miscellaneous factories, was
                16,457 in 1885.</p>
            <p>STATE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Great Officers of.</hi> All the principal ministers of
                the British crown are popularly called the great officers of state. Under this
                designation are more or less accurately included the premier for the time being, the
                other members of the cabinet, and the leading functionaries of the court. But
                properly speaking the great offices of state are only nine in number, and it is to
                the holders of them alone that the description of “ the great officers of state ”
                strictly and distinctively applies. They are the lord high steward, the lord high
                chancellor, the lord high treasurer, the lord-president of the privy council, the
                lord-keeper of the privy seal, the lord great chamberlain, the lord high constable,
                the earl marshal, and the lord high admiral. Of these, three—the lord chancellor,
                the lord-president of the council, and the lord privy seal— are the first and second
                always and the third almost always cabinet ministers. The offices of two more—those
                of the lord treasurer and the high constable—are now executed by commission, the
                chief of the lords commissioners, known severally as the first lord of the treasury
                and the first lord of the admiralty, being likewise members of the cabinet, while
                the first lord of the treasury is usually at the head of the Government. But,
                although it has become the rule for the treasury and the admiralty to be put in
                commission, there is nothing except usage of longer or shorter duration to prevent
                the crown from making a personal appointment to either of them, and the functions
                which formerly appertained to the lord treasurer and the high admiral are still
                regularly performed in the established course of the national administration. The
                four offices of the high steward, the great chamberlain, the high constable, and the
                earl marshal stand on a different footing, and can be regarded at the present day as
                little else than survivals from an earlier condition of society. They have
                practically ceased to have any relation to the ordinary routine of business in the
                country or of ceremonial in the palace, and the duties associated with them have
                either passed entirely into abeyance or are restricted within extremely narrow
                limits, save on certain occasions of exceptional pomp and solemnity. All of them
                were once hereditary, and, taking the three kingdoms together, they or their
                counterparts and equivalents continue to be held by right of inheritance in one or
                other of them even now. The prince of Wales is the hereditary great steward of
                Scotland, and the carl of Shrewsbury is the hereditary grand seneschal of Ireland.
                The great chamberlainship of England is held jointly by Lady Willoughby de Eresby
                and Lord Carrington on the one part and on the other part by the marquis of
                Cholmondeley. The hereditary high constable of Scotland is the earl of Erroll, and
                the hereditary earl marshal of England is the duke of Norfolk. It is of the great
                offices of the steward, the chamberlain, the constable, and the marshal that we
                shall at present speak, the rest of those we have mentioned being dealt with under
                their proper headings, or in the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Cabinet, Ministry,
                    Privy Council,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Royal Household.</hi></p>
            <p>The lord high steward of England ranks as the first of the great officers of state.
                His office is called out of abeyance by commission under the great seal only for
                coronations and for trials by the House of Lords. At the former he bears the crown
                of St Edward immediately before the sovereign in the procession to Westminster
                Abbey, and he presides at the latter on the arraignment of a peer or a peeress for
                treason or felony. From the reign of Richard II. to that of Henry VII. it was the

                occasions the locality pitched upon has been, either at the time or soon after,
                ravaged by locusts, which the birds greedily devour. Another fact worthy of
                attention is that they are often observed to affect trees or shrubs bearing
