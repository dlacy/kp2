<p><span class="font0">gustful to Rubens, whose natural disposition was modest 'and amiable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Anxious to find an artist whose genius and dispositions were congenial with his own, he became the disciple of Octavio Van Veen, generally known by the name of Otho&nbsp;Venius, a painter of singular merit, and who was not only&nbsp;skilled in the principles of his art, but also distinguished&nbsp;for learning and other accomplishments. Between the&nbsp;master and the scholar a remarkable similarity appeared in&nbsp;temper and inclination; indeed the whole turn of their&nbsp;minds was the same. It was this congeniality of sentiments&nbsp;which animated Rubens with that ardent passion for the&nbsp;art of painting which at length determined him to pursue&nbsp;it as a profession. From this time he gave up his whole&nbsp;mind to it; and so successful were his exertions, that he&nbsp;soon equalled his master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In order to arrive at that perfection which he already beheld in idea, it became requisite to study the productions&nbsp;of the most eminent artists ; and for this purpose he travelled&nbsp;throughout Italy, visiting the most valuable collections of&nbsp;paintings and antique statues with which that country&nbsp;abounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sandrat, who was intimately acquainted with Rubens, informs us that he was recommended to the Duke of Mantua by the Archduke Albert, who had witnessed his talents&nbsp;in the finishing of some fine paintings designed for his own&nbsp;palace. At Mantua he was received by the duke with the&nbsp;most flattering marks of distinction, and had opportunities&nbsp;of improving himself, which he did not neglect. He there&nbsp;carefully studied the works of Julio Romano; and he next&nbsp;visited Rome, where he had an opportunity of examining&nbsp;the productions of Raffaelle. The paintings of Titian and&nbsp;Paul Veronese called him to Venice, where he improved&nbsp;himself in the art of colouring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He continued in Italy seven years. At length receiving intelligence that his mother was taken ill, he hastened to&nbsp;Antwerp. But his filial affection was not gratified with a&nbsp;sight of her. She died before his arrival. He married soon&nbsp;afterwards; but his wife dying at the end of four years, he&nbsp;retired for some time from Antwerp, and endeavoured to&nbsp;soothe his melancholy by a journey to Holland. At Utrecht&nbsp;he visited Hurtort, whom he greatly esteemed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fame of Rubens was now spread all over Europe. He was invited by Mary de’ Medici, queen of Henry IV. of&nbsp;France, to Paris, where he painted the galleries in the palace of Luxembourg. These form a series of paintings&nbsp;which delineate the history of Mary; and afford a convincing proof how well qualified he was to excel in allegorical&nbsp;and emblematical compositions. Whilst at Paris he became acquainted with the Duke of Buckingham, who was&nbsp;so taken with his great talents and accomplishments, that&nbsp;he judged him well qualified to explain to Isabella, the wife&nbsp;of Albert the archduke, the cause of the misunderstanding&nbsp;which had taken place between the courts of England and&nbsp;Spain. In this employment Rubens acquitted himself with&nbsp;such propriety, that Isabella appointed him envoy to the&nbsp;king of Spain, with a commission to propose terms of peace,&nbsp;and to bring back the instructions of that monarch. Philip&nbsp;was not less captivated with Rubens, conferring on him&nbsp;the honour of knighthood, and making him secretary to his&nbsp;privy council. Rubens returned to Brussels, and thence&nbsp;passed over into England in 1630 with a commission from&nbsp;the Catholic king to negotiate a peace between the two&nbsp;crowns. He was successful in his negotiation, and a treaty&nbsp;was concluded. Charles I. who then filled the British&nbsp;throne, could not receive Rubens in a public character on&nbsp;account of his profession ; nevertheless, he treated him&nbsp;with every mark of respect. Having engaged him to paint&nbsp;some of the apartments of Whitehall, he not only gave him&nbsp;a handsome sum of money, but, as an acknowledgment of&nbsp;his merit, created him a knight; and the Duke of Buckingham, his friend and patron, purchased of him a collection&nbsp;of pictures, statues, medals, and antiques, for the sum of ten&nbsp;thousand pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He returned to Spain, where he was magnificently honoured arid rewarded for his services, being created a gentleman of the king’s bed-chamber, and named secretary to the council of state in the Netherlands. Rubens, however,&nbsp;did not lay aside his profession. He returned to Antwerp,&nbsp;where he married a second wife, called Helena Forment,&nbsp;who, being an eminent beauty, helped him much in the&nbsp;figures of his women. But he died on the 30th of May&nbsp;1640, in the sixty-third year of his age, leaving vast riches&nbsp;to his children. Albert his eldest son succeeded him in the&nbsp;office of secretary of state in Flanders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As Rubens was possessed of all the ornaments and advantages that render a man worthy to be esteemed or courted, he was always treated as a person of consequence.&nbsp;His figure was noble, his manners engaging, and his conversation lively. His learning was universal. Though his&nbsp;favourite study must have occupied him much, yet he found&nbsp;time to read the works of the most celebrated authors, especially the poets. He spoke several languages perfectly,&nbsp;and was an able statesman, as well as an excellent painter.&nbsp;His house at Antwerp was enriched with every thing that&nbsp;was rare and valuable in the arts. It contained one spacious apartment, in imitation of the rotunda at Rome, adorned&nbsp;with a choice collection of pictures which he had purchased&nbsp;in Italy, part of which he sold to the Duke of Buckingham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His genius qualified him to excel equally in every thing that can enter into the composition of a picture. His invention was so fertile, that, if he had occasion to paint the&nbsp;same subject several times, his imagination always supplied&nbsp;him with something striking and new. The attitudes of&nbsp;his figures are natural and varied, the carriage of the head&nbsp;is peculiarly graceful, and his expression is noble and animated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He is by all allowed to have carried the art of colouring to its highest pitch. He understood so thoroughly the true&nbsp;principles of the chiaro-scuro, that he gave to his figures&nbsp;the utmost harmony, and a prominence resembling real life.&nbsp;His pencil is mellowed, his strokes are bold and easy, his&nbsp;carnation glows with life, and his drapery is simple but grand,&nbsp;broad, and hung with much skill. The great excellence of&nbsp;Rubens appears in his grand compositions. For as they&nbsp;are to be viewed at a distance, he laid on a proper body of&nbsp;colours with uncommon boldness, and fixed all his tints in&nbsp;their proper places; so that he never impaired their lustre&nbsp;by breaking or torturing them, but touched them in such&nbsp;a manner as to give them a lasting force, beauty, and harmony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is generally allowed that Rubens wanted correctness in drawing and designing; some of his figures being heavy&nbsp;and too short, and the limbs in certain parts not being justly&nbsp;sketched in the outline. Though he had spent seven years&nbsp;in Italy in studying those antiques by which other celebrated artists had modelled their taste, and though he had&nbsp;examined them with such minute attention as not only to&nbsp;perceive their beauties, but to be qualified to describe them&nbsp;in a dissertation which he wrote on that subject; yet he&nbsp;seems never to have divested himself of that heavy style of&nbsp;painting which, being peculiar to his native country, he&nbsp;had insensibly acquired. The astonishing rapidity too with&nbsp;which he painted, made him fall into inaccuracies, from&nbsp;which those works that he finished with care are entirely&nbsp;exempted. Amongst his finished pieces may be mentioned&nbsp;the Crucifixion of Jesus Christ between the Two Thieves ;&nbsp;but of all his works the paintings in the palace of Luxembourg best display his genius and his style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is the observation of Algarotti, that he was more moderate in his movements than Tintoretto, and softer in his chiaro-scuro than Carravaggio; but not so rich in his com</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
