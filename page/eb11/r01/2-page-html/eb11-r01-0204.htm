<p><span class="font2">REDESDALE, JOHN FREEMAN-MITFORD, Baron (1748-1830), English lawyer and politician, younger son of John Mitford (d. 1761) and brother of the historian William Mitford,&nbsp;was born in London on the 18th of August 1748. Having&nbsp;become a barrister of the Inner Temple in 1777, he wrote&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A Treatise on the Pleadings in Suits in the Court of Chancery by&nbsp;English Bill,</span><span class="font2"> a work of great value, which has been reprinted&nbsp;several times in England and America. In 1788 Mitford became&nbsp;member of parliament for the borough of Beeralston in Devon,&nbsp;and in 1791 he introduced the important bill for the relief of&nbsp;Roman Catholics, which was passed into law. In 1793 he&nbsp;succeeded Sir John Scott, afterwards Lord Eldon, as solicitor-general for England, becoming attorney-general six years later,&nbsp;when he was returned to parliament as member for East Looe,&nbsp;in Cornwall. In February 1801 Sir John Mitford (as he was&nbsp;now) was chosen speaker of the House of Commons. Exactly&nbsp;a year later, he was appointed lord chancellor of Ireland and&nbsp;was created a peer of the United Kingdom as Baron Redesdale.&nbsp;Being an outspoken opponent of Roman Catholic emancipation,&nbsp;Redesdale was unpopular in Ireland. In February 1806 he&nbsp;was dismissed on the formation of the ministry of Fox and&nbsp;Lord Grenville. Although Redesdale declined to return to&nbsp;official life, he was an active member of the House of Lords&nbsp;both on its political and its judicial sides. In 1813 he&nbsp;secured the passing of acts for the relief of insolvent debtors,&nbsp;and later he was an opponent of the repeal of the Test and&nbsp;Corporation Acts and of other popular measures of reform.&nbsp;Redesdale, who was a fellow of the Royal Society and a member&nbsp;of three commissions on the public records, died on the 16th of&nbsp;January 1830. In 1803 he married Frances (d. 1817), daughter&nbsp;of John, 2nd earl of Egmont. He took the additional name of&nbsp;Freeman in 1809 on succeeding to the estates of Thomas Edwards&nbsp;Freeman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His only son, John Thomas Freeman Mitford (1805-1886), succeeded to the title. In 1851 he was chosen chairman of&nbsp;committees in the House of Lords, a position which he retained&nbsp;until his death, and in 1877 he was created earl of Redesdale.&nbsp;His chief interest was reserved for ecclesiastical questions,&nbsp;and he won some repute as a Protestant controversialist. He&nbsp;assisted to revive Convocation in 1853; was an active opponent&nbsp;of the disestablishment of the Irish Church; and engaged in&nbsp;controversy with Cardinal Manning on the subject of communion in both kinds. On his death, on the 2nd of May 1886,&nbsp;his titles became extinct. He wrote </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Thoughts on English&nbsp;Prosody and Translations from Horace,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Further Thoughts&nbsp;on English Prosody</span><span class="font2"> (Oxford, 1859), in addition to various pamphlets on ecclesiastical topics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The earl bequeathed his estates to his kinsman, Algernon Bertram Freeman-Mitford (b. 1837), a great-grandson of William&nbsp;Mitford. He had been in the diplomatic service from 1858 to&nbsp;1873, and had been secretary to the Office of Works from 1874&nbsp;to 1886. From 1892 to 1895 he was member of parliament for&nbsp;the Stratford-on-Avon division of Warwickshire, and he was&nbsp;created Baron Redesdale in 1902. He was well known for his&nbsp;writings on Japan, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tales of Old Japan</span><span class="font2"> (1871), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Attaché at&nbsp;Peking</span><span class="font2"> (1900), &amp;c.</span></p>
