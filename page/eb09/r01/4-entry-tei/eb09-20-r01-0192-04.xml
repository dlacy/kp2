<p><label>RABBĀH</label>— <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Rab Abbah bar Naḥmani</hi> —was of the house of Eli, on whom the curse rested that none of them should reach a high age (1 Sam. ii. 33). Like Rābā, he tried to remove this curse (T. B., <hi rend="italic">Rosh Has-shanah,</hi> 18a ; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rābā).</hi> He was twenty-two years head of the academy of Pumbadithā, from which he fled in the year 330, pursued by a troop of the Persian king (Shápúr IL), and perished miserably in a jungle (T. B., <hi rend="italic">Bobo Metṣ‛io,</hi> leaf 86a).</p><p>Rabbāh, owing to his great dialectic powers, to which no difficulty seemed difficult, was called 'Oker Harim, “uprooter of mountains.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> See for a similar expression Matt. xvii. 20. </note> This title was applied to him when the selection as “ head ” lay between him and his friend, fellow-pupil, and successor, Rab Yoseph, “the Blind,” to whom is commonly, but by mistake, ascribed the authorship of certain Targumim. This latter doctor was, owing to his vast but mere reproductive powers, called Sinai, the mountain from which the letter of the Law was given (T. B., <hi rend="italic">Berakhoth,</hi> 64a). (S. M. S.-S.)</p>
