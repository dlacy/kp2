He made no other alteration in the ceremony, but that of wearing a crown of myrtle inſtead of a crown of laurel, and this on account of his having defeated the Corſicans in a place where there was a grove of myrtles. The example of Papirius was afterwards followed by a great many generals to whom the ſenate refuſed triumphs.</p><p>The next year, when M. Æmilius Barbula and M. Junius Pera were conſuls, a new war ſprung up in a kingdom out of Italy. <hi rend="italic">Illyricum,</hi>  properly ſo called, which bordered upon Macedon and Epirus, was at this time governed by a woman named <hi rend="italic">Teuta,</hi>  the widow of king Agron, and guardian to her ſon Pinεeus, who was under age. The ſucceſs of her late huſhand againſt the Ætolians had fluſhed her to ſuch a degree, that, inſtead of ſettling the affairs of her ward in peace, ſhe commanded her ſubjects to cruiſe along the coaſt, ſeize all the ſhips they met, take what places they could, and ſpare no nation. Her pirates had, purſuant to her orders, taken and plundered many ſhips belonging to the Roman merchants ; and her troops were then beſieging the iſland of IfΓa in the Adriatic, though the inhabitants had put themſelves under the protection of the republic. Upon the complaints therefore of the Italian merchants, and to protect the people of Iſſa, the ſenate ſent two ambaſſadors to the Illyrian queen, Lucius and Caius Coruncanus, to demand of her that ſhe would reſtrain her ſubjects from infeſting the ſea with pirates. She anſwered them haughtily, that ſhe could only promiſe that her ſubjects ſhould not for the future attack the Romans in her name, and by public authority : “ but as for any thing more, it is not cuſtomary with us (ſaid ſhe) to lay reſtraints on our ſubjects, nor will we forbid them to reap thoſe advantages from the ſea which it offers them.” Your cuſtoms then (replied the young-eſt of the ambaſſadors) are very different from ours. At Rome we make public examples of thoſe ſubjects who injure others, whether at home or abroad. Teuta, we can, by our arms, force you to reform the abuſes of your bad government.” Theſe unſeaſonable threaten-ings provoked Teuta, who was naturally a proud and imperious woman, to ſuch a degree, that, without regard to the right of nations, ſhe cauſed the ambaſſadors to be murdered on their return home.</p><p>When ſo notorious an infraction of the law of na-tions<hi rend="sub">ι</hi>was known at Rome, the people demanded vengeance; and the ſenate having firſt honoured the manes of the ambaſſadors, by erecting, as was uſual in ſuch caſes, ſtatues three feet high to their memory, ordered a fleet to be equipped, and troops raiſed, with all poſſible expedition. But now Teuta, reflecting on the enormity of her proceedings, ſent an embaſſy to Rome, aſſuring the ſenate that ſhe had no hand in the murder of the ambaſſadors, and offering to deliver up to the republic thoſe who had committed that barbarous aſ-ſaſſination. The Romans being at that time threatened with a war from the Gauls, were ready to accept this ſatisfaction : but in the mean time the Illyrian fleet having gained ſome advantage over that of the Achæ-ans, and taken the iſland of Corcyra near Epirus, this ſucceſs made Teuta believe herſelf invincible, and forget the promiſe ſhe had made to the Romans ; nay, ſhe ſent her fleet to ſeize on the iſland of Iſſa, which the Romans had taken under their protection.</p><p>Hereupon the conſuls for the new year, P. Poſthumius Albinus and Cn. Fulvius Centumalus, embarked for Illyricum; Fulvius having the command of the fleet, which conſiſted of ιoo galleys; and Poſthumius of the land forces, which amounted to 20,000 foot, beſides a ſmall body of horſe. Fulvius appeared with his fleet before Corcyra in the Adriatic, and was put in poſſeſſion both of the iſland and city by Demetrius of Pharos, governor of the place for Queen Teuta. Nor was this all ; Demetrius found means to make the inhabitants of Apollonia drive out the Illyrian garriſon, and admit into their city the Roman troops. As Apollonia was one of the keys of Illyricum on the ſide of Macedon» the conſuls, who had hitherto acted jointly, no ſooner ſaw themſelves in poſſeſſion of it than they ſeparated, the fleet cruiſing along the coaſt, and the army penetrating into the heart of the queen’s dominions. The Andyœans, Parthini, and Atintanes, voluntarily ſubmitted to Poſthumius, being induced by the perſuaſions of Demetrius to ſhake off the Illyrian yoke. The conſul being now in poſſeſſion of moſt of the inland towns, returned to the coaſt, where, with the aſſiſtance of the fleet, he took many ſtrong holds, among which was Nutria, a place of great ſtrength, and defended by a numerous garriſon ; ſo that it made a vigorous defence, the Romans having loſt before it a great many private men, ſeveral legionary tribunes, and one quæftor. However, this loſs was repaired by the taking of 40 Illyrian veſſels, which were returning home laden with booty. At length the Roman fleet appeared before Iſſa, which, by Teuta’s order, was ſtill cloſely beſieged, notwithſtanding the loſſes ſhe had ſuſtained. However, upon the approach of the Roman fleet, the Illyrians diſperſed ; but the Pharians, who ſerved among them, followed the example of their countryman Demetrius, and joined the Romans, to whom the Iſſani readily ſubmitted.</p><p>In the mean time Sp. Corvilius and Q. Fabius Maximus being raiſed to the conſulate a ſecond time, Poſthumius w-as recalled from Illyricum, and refuſed a triumph for having been too prodigal of the Roman blood at the ſiege of Nutria. . His colleague Fulvius was appointed to command the land forces in his room, in quality of proconſul. Hereupon Teuta, who had founded great hopes on the change of the conſuls, retired to one of her ſtrong-holds called <hi rend="italic">Rl&gt;ixon,</hi>  and from thence early in the ſpring ſent an embaſſy to Rome. The ſenate reſuſed to treat with her ; but granted the young king a peace upon the following conditions : 1. That he ſhould pay an annual tribute to the republic. 2. That he ſhould ſurrender part of his dominions to the Romans. 3. That he ſhould never ſuffer above three of his ſhips of war at a time to ſail beyond Lyſſus, a town on the confines of Macedon and Illyricum. The places he yielded to the Romans in virtue of this treaty, were the iſlands of Corcyra, Iffa, and Pharos, the city of Dyrrhachium, and the country of the Atintanes. Soon after Teuta, either out of ſhame, or compelled by a ſecret article of the treaty, abdicated the regency, and Demetrius ſucceeded her.</p><p>Before this war was ended, the Romans were alarmed by new motions of the Gauls, and the great progreſs which the Carthaginians made in Spain. At this time</p></body></text></TEI>
