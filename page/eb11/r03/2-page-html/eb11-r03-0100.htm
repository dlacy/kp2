<p><span class="font1">the victory, and under the empire Marshal Masséna received the title of duke of Rivoli. The strong positions around Rivoli,&nbsp;which command the approaches from Tirol and the upper&nbsp;Adige into the Italian plain, have always been celebrated in&nbsp;military history as a formidable obstacle, and Charles V. and&nbsp;Prince Eugene of Savoy preferred to turn them by difficult&nbsp;mountain paths instead of attacking them directly. Minor&nbsp;engagements, such as rearguard actions and holding attacks,&nbsp;have consequently often taken place about them, notably&nbsp;in the campaign of 1796-97. Anengagementofthischaracter&nbsp;was fought here in 1848 between the Austrian and the Piedmontese troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIXDORF, a town of Germany, lying immediately south of Berlin, of which it practically forms a suburb, though&nbsp;retaining its own civic administration. Pop. (1880) 18,729;&nbsp;(1895) 59,495;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1905) 153,650. It is connected with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">metropolis by a railway (Ring-bahn) and by an electric tramway. It contains no public buildings of any interest, and is almost&nbsp;entirely occupied by a large industrial and artisan population,&nbsp;engaged in the manufacture of linoleum, furniture, cloth,&nbsp;pianos, beer, soap, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rixdorf is chiefly interesting as a foundation of Moravian Brethren from Bohemia, who settled here in 1737 under the&nbsp;protection of King Frederick William I. German Rixdorf,&nbsp;which is now united with Bohemian Rixdorf, was a much more&nbsp;ancient place, and appears as Richardsdorf in 1630 and as&nbsp;Riegenstorp in 1435. Before 1435 it belonged to the order of&nbsp;the -Knights of St John.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIZZIO, or Riccio, DAVID (c. 1533-1566), secretary of Mary </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> queen of Scots, was a native of Turin, and came&nbsp;to Scotland in 1561 in the train of the Piedmontese ambassador.&nbsp;The queen wanted a bass singer, and he entered her service&nbsp;as a musician, becoming also her </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">valet de chambre,</span><span class="font1"> and in&nbsp;1564 private foreign secretary. After her marriage to Darnley&nbsp;in 1565 his influence with Mary became paramount, and he&nbsp;gave himself great airs and affected considerable state,&nbsp;practically superseding Maitland of Lethington as secretary&nbsp;of state. His elevation aroused the active hostility of Darnley&nbsp;and the other nobles, and he was suspected of being the queen’s&nbsp;lover. On the evening of the 9th of March 1566, the earls&nbsp;of Morton and Lindsay, with armed followers, entered&nbsp;Mary’s supper chamber at Holyrood, seized Rizzio, hacked&nbsp;him to death with daggers, and threw his body into the&nbsp;courtyard.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROACH </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Leuciscus rutilus),</span><span class="font1"> a small fish belonging to the Cyprinid family, the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Leuciscus</span><span class="font1"> having many representatives in Europe, in which the rudd, the chub and the dace&nbsp;are included. It may attain a length of over 12 in., but a&nbsp;roach of 2 Ib is an unusually large one. It is good sport for&nbsp;anglers, but is not esteemed for the table. The general colour is&nbsp;silvery, with reddish fins. It does not occur in Ireland.

<p><span class="font1">ROADS AND STREETS. These words embrace the two divisions into which the lines of communication made by man&nbsp;for vehicular and pedestrian traffic between different places may&nbsp;be roughly classified. In current usage “ road ” is applied as a&nbsp;general term for all broad made ways from place to place,&nbsp;whether with separate side-paths for foot-passengers or not,&nbsp;while “ street ” is confined to the roads through towns, villages&nbsp;and other inhabited places, more or less lined by houses and other&nbsp;buildings on either side. The present article is confined to the&nbsp;methods adopted in making roads, from the first great road-makers, the Romans, down to modern times. The roadways of&nbsp;times anterior to the Romans, at least in Europe, were merely&nbsp;the tracks worn by the feet of pedestrians and animals, and the&nbsp;wheels of vehicular traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Etymologically considered, “ road ” in its current usage is late in its appearance. The first quotation in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New English&nbsp;Dictionary</span><span class="font1"> is from Shakespeare </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(1 Henry IV.</span><span class="font1"> 2, i. 16). The true&nbsp;O.E. word was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">weg,</span><span class="font1"> way, common to Teut. languages, and&nbsp;probably allied to Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">via.</span><span class="font1"> The O.E. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">räd</span><span class="font1"> meant the act of&nbsp;riding, and is formed from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ridan,</span><span class="font1"> to ride, and is thus used of a&nbsp;journey on horseback, and in compounds of a track or course,&nbsp;cf. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">swanräd,</span><span class="font1"> the swan’s track, a poetic word for the sea- or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">streäm-räd,</span><span class="font1"> course of a stream, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hweolrad,</span><span class="font1"> wheel-track, &amp;c. A special use&nbsp;of the word, occurring as early as the Anglo-Saxon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C hr on.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">c. 900, was for a hostile foray, an “ inroad,” a “ raid,” which is the&nbsp;N. Eng. doublet of “ road,” and has superseded it in general use.&nbsp;Another use, which still survives, and show’s the origin, is that&nbsp;of a space of water where ships may “ ride at anchor in security&nbsp;from stress of weather, a roadstead.” “ Street ” (O.E. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sträet}&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">represents the Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">strata via,</span><span class="font1"> paved way (from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sternere,</span><span class="font1"> to strew,&nbsp;pave). It is one of the few words adopted in O.E. from the&nbsp;Romans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The earliest roads about which anything definite is known, so far as construction is concerned, are those of ancient Rome,&nbsp;one of the oldest of which and the most celebrated&nbsp;for the grandeur of its works—the Appian Way—was&nbsp;commenced in 312 </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> Roman roads are remarkable&nbsp;for preserving a straight course from point to point regardless of&nbsp;obstacles which might have been easily avoided. They appear&nbsp;to have been often laid out in a line with some prominent landmark, and their general straightness is perhaps due to convenience in setting them out. In solidity of construction they&nbsp;have never been excelled, and many of them still remain, often&nbsp;forming the foundation of a more modern road, and in some&nbsp;instances constituting the road surface now used. It is consequently possible, with the help of allusions of ancient writers,&nbsp;to follow the ideal mode of construction, though this was not&nbsp;always adopted. Two parallel trenches were first cut to mark&nbsp;the breadth of the road; loose earth was removed until a solid&nbsp;foundation was reached; and it was replaced by proper.material&nbsp;consolidated by ramming, or other means were taken to form a&nbsp;solid foundation for the body of the road. This appears often&nbsp;to have been composed of four layers, generally of local materials,&nbsp;though sometimes they were brought from considerable distances.&nbsp;The lowest layer consisted of two or three courses of flat stones,&nbsp;or, when these were not obtainable, of other stones, generally&nbsp;laid in mortar; the second layer was composed of rubble masonry&nbsp;of smaller stones, or a coarse concrete; the third of a finer&nbsp;concrete, on which was laid a pavement of polygonal blocks of&nbsp;hard stone jointed with the greatest nicety. The four layers are&nbsp;found to be often 3 ft. or more in thickness, but the lower ones&nbsp;were dispensed with on rock, on which the paving stones were&nbsp;sometimes laid almost directly. The paved part of a great road&nbsp;appears to have been about 14 ft. wide, and on either side, and&nbsp;separated from it by raised stone edgings, were unpaved sideways, each of half the width of the paved road. Where, as on&nbsp;many roads, the surface was not paved, it was made of hard&nbsp;concrete, or pebbles or flints set in mortar. Sometimes clay and&nbsp;marl were used instead of mortar, and it would seem that where&nbsp;inferior materials were used the road </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font1">made higher above the&nbsp;ground and rounder in cross section. Streets were paved with&nbsp;large polygonal blocks laid as above described, and footways&nbsp;with rectangular slabs. Specimens are still to be seen in Rome&nbsp;and Pompeii, while in Britain many of the roads were of hard&nbsp;gravel or had a cobbled surface. There are no traces of Roman&nbsp;influence in the later roads in England, but in France the Roman&nbsp;method appears to have been followed to some extent when new&nbsp;roads were constructed about the beginning of the 18th century.&nbsp;A foundation of stones on the flat was laid, and over that two layers&nbsp;of considerable thickness, of larger and smaller stones, bordered&nbsp;by large stones on edge, which appeared on the surface of the&nbsp;road. In 1764 Trésaguet set the foundation-stones on edge and&nbsp;reduced the thickness of the upper layers, and his method was&nbsp;generally followed until the influence of John Loudon McAdam&nbsp;(1756-1836) began to be felt. A French chaussée with accotements still retains some  resemblance to the old Roman&nbsp;roads.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
