The famiſhed Germans who eſcaped the fury of the auxiliaries were ſold as ſlaves, at the contemptible price of as many ſingle pieces of gold : but the difference of food and climate ſwept away great numbers of thoſe unhappy ſtrangers; and it was obſerved, that the inhuman purchaſers, inſtead of reaping the fruit of their labour, were ſoon obliged to add to it the expence of interring them. Stilicho informed the emperor and the ſenate of his ſucceſs ; and deſerved a ſecond time the glorious title of <hi rend="italic">Deliverer of Italy.</hi></p><p>“ The fame of the victory, and more eſpecially of the miracle, has encouraged a vain perſuafion, that the whole army, or rather nation, of Germans, who migrated from the ſhores of the Baltic, miſerably periſhed under the walls of Florence. Such indeed was the fate of Radagaiſus himſelf, of his brave and faithful companions, and of more than one-third of the various multitude of Sueves and Vandals, of Alani and Burgundians, who adhered to the ſtandard of their general. The union of ſuch an army might excite our ſurpriſe, but the cauſes of ſeparation are obvious and forcible ; they were the pride of birth, the inſolence of valour, the jealouſy of command, the impatience of ſubordination, and the obſtinate conflict of opinions, of intereſts, and of paf-ſions, among ſo many kings and warriors, who were untaught to yield or to obey. Alter the defeat of Radagaiſus, two parts of the German hoſt, which muſt have exceeded the number of 100,000 men, ſtill remained in arms between the Apennine and the Alps, or between the Alps and the Danube. It is uncertain whether they attempted to revenge the death of their general : but their irregular fury was ſoon diverted by the prudence and firmneſs of Stilicho, who oppoſed their march, and facilitated their retreat ; who conſidered the ſafety of Rome and Italy as the great object of his care, and who ſacriſiced with too much indifference the wealth and tranquillity of the diſtant provinces. The barbarians acquired, ſrom the junction of ſome Pannonian deſerters, the knowledge of the country and of the roads ; and the invaſion of Gaul, which Alaric had deſigned, was executed by the remains of the great army of Radagaiſus.</p><p>“ Yet if they expected to derive any aſſiſtance ſrom ihe tribes of Germany who inhabited-the banks of the Rhine, their hopes were diſappointed. The Alemanni preſerved a ſtate of inactive neutrality ; and the Franks diſtinguiſhed their zeal and courage in the defence of the empire. In the rapid progreſs down the Rhine, which was the firſt act of the adminiſtration of Stilicho, he had applied himſelf with peculiar attention to ſecure the alliance of the warlike Franks, and to remove the irreconcileable enemies of peace and of the republic. Marcomir, one of their kings, was publicly convicted before the tribunal of the Roman magiſtrate of violating the faith of treaties. He was ſentenced to a mild, but diſtant exile, in the province of Tuſcany ; and this degradation of the regal dignity was ſo far from exciting the reſentment of his ſubjects, that they puniſhed with death the turbulent Sunno, who attempted to revenge his brother, and maintained a dutiful allegiance to the princes who were eſtabliſhed on the throne by the choice of Stilicho. When the limits of Gaul and Germany were ſhaken by the northern emigration, the Franks</p><lb/><p>bravely encountered the ſingle force of the Vandals ; who, regardleſs of the leffons of adverſity, had again ſeparated their troops from the ſtandard of their barbarian allies. They paid the penalty of their raſhneſs ; and 20,000 Vandals, with their king Godigiſclus, were ſlain in the field of battle. The whole people muſt have been extirpated, if the ſquadrons of the Alani, advancing to their relief, had not trampled down the infantry of the Franks ; who, after an honourable reſiſtance, were compelled to relinquiſh the unequal conteſt. The victorious confederates purfued their march ; and on the laſt day of the year, in a ſeaſon when the waters of the Rhine w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ere moſt probably frozen, they entered without oppoſition the defenceleſs provinces of Gaul. This memorable paſſage of the Suevi, the Vandals, the Alani, and the Burgundians, who never afterwards retreated, may be conſidered as the fail of the Roman empire in the countries beyond the Alps ; and the barriers, which had ſo long ſeparated the ſavage and the civilized nations of the earth, w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ere ſrom that fatal moment levelled with the ground.</p><p>“ While the peace of Germany was ſecured by the attachment of the Franks and the neutrality of the Alemanni, the ſubjects of Rome, unconſeious of their approaching calamities, enjoyed a ſtate of quiet and proſperity, which had ſeldom bleſſed the frontiers of Gaul. Their flocks and herds were permitted to graze in the paſtures of the barbarians ; their huntſmen penetrated, without fear or danger, into the darkeſt receſſes of the Hercynian wood. The banks of the Rhine were crowned, like thoſe of the Tiber, with elegant houſes and weſt cultivated farms ; and if a poet deſcend-ed the river, he might expreſs his doubt on which ſide was ſituated the territory of the Romans. This ſcene of peace and plenty was ſuddenly changed into a deſert, and the proſpect of the ſmoking ruins could alone diſtinguiſh the ſolitude of nature from the deſolation of man. The flouriſhing city of Mentz was ſurpriſed and deſtroyed ; and many thouſand Chriſtians were inhumanly maſſacred in the church. Worms periſhed after a long and obſtinate ſiege : Straſhurg, Spires, Rheims, Tournay, Aras, Amiens, experienced the cruel oppreſſion of the German yoke ; and the conſuming flames of war ſpread from the banks of the Rhine over the greateſt part of the 17 provinces of Gaul. That rich and extenſive country, as far as the Ocean, the Alps, and the Pyrenees, was delivered to the barbarians, who drove before them, in a promiſeuous crowd, the biſhop, the ſenator, and the virgin, laden with the ſpoils of their houſes and altars.”</p><p>In the midſt of theſe calamities a revolt happened in Britain, where one Conſtantine, a common ſoldier, was raiſed to the imperial throne, merely for the ſake of his name. However, he ſeems to have been a man of conſiderable abilities, and by no means unfit for the high dignity to which he was raiſed. He governed Britain with great proſperity ; paſſed over into Gaul and Spain, the inhabitants of which ſubmitted without oppoſition, being glad of any protector whatever from the barbarians. Honorius, incapable of defending the empire, or repreſſing the revolt, was obliged to acknowledge him for his partner in the empire. In the mean time, Alaric, with his Goths, threatened a new invaſion unleſs he was paid a certain ſum of money. Stilicho is ſaid to have occaſioned this demand, and to have inſiſt-</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
