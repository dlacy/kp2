<p><span class="font1">the means of recovering it from the husband or his heirs when the marriage was dissolved. Between the time of Constantine and&nbsp;that of Theodosius and Valentinian it had become the practice for&nbsp;a man to make a settlement on his intended wife of a provision&nbsp;which was to remain his property (but without the power of alienation) during the marriage, but to pass to her on his predecease ; it&nbsp;got the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">donatio ante nuptias</span><span class="font1"> or sometimes, as being a sort&nbsp;of return for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dos, antiphema.</span><span class="font1"> The earliest legislation about it&nbsp;was by the last - mentioned emperors; Zeno and Justin followed&nbsp;suit; and Justinian, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Novels,</span><span class="font1"> published five or six enactments for its regulation. The general result was that, wherever a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dos</span><span class="font1"> was given or promised on the part of the wife, there a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">donatio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was to be constituted on the part of the husband ; that, if one was&nbsp;increased during the marriage, a corresponding increase was to be&nbsp;made to the other ; that it might be constituted after the marriage&nbsp;without infringing the rule prohibiting donations between husband&nbsp;and wife, which caused Justinian to change its name to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">donatio&nbsp;propter nuptias</span><span class="font1">; that the wife might demand its transfer to her&nbsp;(as she could that of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dos)</span><span class="font1"> on her husband’s insolvency, but&nbsp;under obligation to apply its income to the maintenance of the&nbsp;family; and that on the dissolution of the marriage by her husband’s death or by a divorce for which he was in fault she had&nbsp;ample remedies for reducing it into possession.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The change in the complexion of the relations between husband and wife under the Christian emperors, however, was insignificant&nbsp;when compared with that which had overtaken the relation between&nbsp;parent and child. Justinian in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes</span><span class="font1"> reproduces the boast&nbsp;of Gaius that nowhere else had a father such power over his children&nbsp;as was exercised by a Roman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias.</span><span class="font1"> True it is that the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font1"> in name still held a prominent place in the Justinianian collections; but it had been shorn of most of the prerogatives&nbsp;that had characterized it in the republic. To expose a new-born&nbsp;child was forbidden under penalties. To take the life of a grownup one—unless it was a daughter slain with her paramour in the&nbsp;act of adultery—was murder ; for the domestic tribunal, with the&nbsp;judicial power of life and death in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> as its head,&nbsp;had long disappeared. For the same reason a parent could no&nbsp;longer sell his child as a slave, at least he could do so only when&nbsp;the child was an infant and he in such extreme poverty as to be&nbsp;unable to support it. Even the right to make a noxal surrender&nbsp;of his son to a party who had suffered from the latter’s delict had&nbsp;silently become obsolete; so greatly had altered sentiment, in&nbsp;sympathy with legislation, curtailed the power of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">over those in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas.</span><span class="font1"> All that remained of it in the latest&nbsp;Justinianian law was no more than is sanctioned in most modern&nbsp;systems as natural emanations of the paternal relationship,—the&nbsp;rights of moderate chastisement for offence, of testamentary nomination of guardians, of pupilary substitution (enlarged by Justinian),&nbsp;and of withholding consent from the marriage of a child, but subject&nbsp;to magisterial intervention if used unreasonably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How the right of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> over the earnings and acquisitions of his children was modified by the recognition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the, peculium castrense</span><span class="font1"> has been shown in a previous page (p. 706). But the&nbsp;modification was carried to such an extent by the Christian emperors as finally to negative the father’s ownership altogether,&nbsp;except as regarded acquisitions that were the outcome of funds&nbsp;advanced by him to his child for his separate use </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(peculium profecticium).</span><span class="font1"> Of some of the child’s acquisitions his father had,&nbsp;down to the time of Justinian, the life interest and right of administration ; but by his legislation even these might be excluded&nbsp;at the pleasure of the parties from whom the acquisitions had been&nbsp;derived. By the classical law the father’s radical right in his son’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">peculium castrense</span><span class="font1"> revived on the latter’s death; for if he died&nbsp;intestate the former appropriated it not as his son’s heir, but as&nbsp;an owner whose powers as such had been merely temporarily suspended. But by one of the chapters in the famous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Novel</span><span class="font1"> on the&nbsp;law of intestate succession even this prerogative of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was abolished, and all a child’s belongings except his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">peculium&nbsp;profecticium</span><span class="font1"> were recognized as his own in death as well as in life,&nbsp;so that if any of them should pass to his parent on his intestacy&nbsp;it should only be by title of inheritance and in the absence of&nbsp;descendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In every other branch of the law of the family the same reforming spirit was manifested. Adoption was no longer followed in all cases by a change of family for the adoptee, but only when the&nbsp;adopter was in fact one of his parents, such as a paternal or maternal&nbsp;grandfather,—when there was a natural </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> to underlie and&nbsp;justify the civil one. The modes of legitimation of children born&nbsp;out of wedlock, especially that by subsequent marriage of the&nbsp;parents, first introduced by Constantine, were regulated, and the&nbsp;extent of the rights of the legitimated issue carefully defined.&nbsp;Emancipation was simplified, and the old procedure by sales and&nbsp;manumissions, which degraded the child too much to the level of&nbsp;a slave, dispensed with. Tutory at law was opened to the pupil’s&nbsp;nearest kinsman, whether on the father’s side or the mother’s ; and&nbsp;the mother herself, or the child’s grandmother, might be allowed,&nbsp;under certain conditions, to act as its guardian. Slavery was often&nbsp;converted into the milder condition of colonate ; but, even where&nbsp;this did not happen, the rights of owners were not allowed to&nbsp;be abused ; for slaves were permitted to claim the protection of&nbsp;the magistrate, and cruelty by a master might result in his being&nbsp;deprived of his human property. Kinship that had arisen between&nbsp;two persons when one or both were slaves </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(servilis cognatio)</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;recognized as creative not only of disabilities but of rights. The&nbsp;modes of manumission were multiplied, and the restrictions of the&nbsp;legislation of the early empire abolished ; and a freedman invariably became a citizen, Junian Latinity and dediticiancy being no&nbsp;longer recognized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amendments on the Law of Property and Obligation.—</span><span class="font1">In the law of property the principal changes of the Christian empire were the&nbsp;simplification of the forms of conveyance, the extension of the&nbsp;colonate, the introduction and regulation of emphyteusis, and the&nbsp;remodelling of the law of prescription. Simplification of the forms&nbsp;of conveyance was necessary only in the case of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res&nbsp;nec mancipi</span><span class="font1"> had always passed by delivery. From the Theodosian&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code</span><span class="font1"> it is apparent that movable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font1"> usually passed in the&nbsp;same way from very early in the period, and that for the mancipation of lands and houses (for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in jure cessio</span><span class="font1"> had disappeared with&nbsp;the formular system) a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">solemnis traditio,</span><span class="font1"> a written instrument and&nbsp;delivery following thereon, and both before witnesses, was gradually substituted. Of this there is no trace in the Justinianian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">For Justinian abolished all remains of the distinction between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res&nbsp;mancipi</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> between full ownership, bonitarian&nbsp;ownership, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nudum jus Quiritium,</span><span class="font1"> placing movables and immovables on a footing of perfect equality so far as their direct conveyance was concerned. But, as regarded the possession required of&nbsp;an alienee to cure any defect in the conveyance, he made a marked&nbsp;difference between them. For, amalgamating the old positive usucapion of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> with .the negative “prolonged possession”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(longi temporis posscssio)</span><span class="font1"> that had been introduced in the provinces&nbsp;(probably by the provincial edict), he declared that possession on a&nbsp;sufficient title and in good faith should in future make the possessor&nbsp;legal owner of the thing possessed by him, provided that the possession of himself and his author had endured uninterruptedly for three&nbsp;years in the case of a movable, and in the case of an immovable for&nbsp;ten years if the party against whom he possessed was resident in&nbsp;the same province, or for twenty if he resided in another one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The same causes that led to the colonate induced the introduction of emphyteusis@@<sup>1 </sup>—an institution which had already existed in some of the Eastern provinces when independent, and which came&nbsp;to be utilized first by the emperors, then by the church, and afterwards by municipalities and private landowners, for bringing into&nbsp;cultivation the large tracts of provincial land belonging to them&nbsp;which were unproductive and unprofitable through want of supervision on the spot. Its nature and conditions were carefully defined by Zeno and amended by Justinian. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphyteuta,</span><span class="font1"> as the&nbsp;grantee of the right was called, did not become owner ; the granter&nbsp;still remained </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dominus,</span><span class="font1"> all that the grantee enjoyed being </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;jus in&nbsp;re aliena,</span><span class="font1"> but </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> so extensive as hardly to be distinguishable&nbsp;from ownership. It conferred upon him and his heirs a perpetual&nbsp;right in the lands included in the grant, in consideration of a fixed&nbsp;annual payment to the lord </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(canon)</span><span class="font1"> and due observance of conventional and statutory conditions; but he was not entitled to abandon&nbsp;it, nor able to free himself of the obligations he had undertaken,&nbsp;without the lord’s consent. The latter was entitled to hold the&nbsp;grant forfeited if the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">canon</span><span class="font1"> fell into arrear for three years (in church&nbsp;lands for two), or if the land-tax was in arrear for the same period,&nbsp;or if the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphyteuta</span><span class="font1"> allowed the lands to deteriorate, or if he attempted to alienate them </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(alienare meliorationes,</span><span class="font1"> as the text says)&nbsp;without observance of statutory requirements. These were that he&nbsp;should intimate an intended alienation and the name of the intended&nbsp;alienee to the lord, so that the latter, before giving his assent,&nbsp;might satisfy himself that he would not be a loser by the transaction ; and, if the alienation was to be by sale, he had to state the&nbsp;price fixed, so as to give the lord the opportunity of exercising his&nbsp;statutory right of pre-emption at the same figure. If those requirements were complied with, and the lord had no reasonable objection&nbsp;to the proposed alienee, he was not entitled to resist the alienation,&nbsp;provided a payment </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(laudemium)</span><span class="font1"> was made to him of two per cent,&nbsp;of the sale-price in consideration of his enforced consent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The changes in the law of obligation were more superficial than those in the law of property, and consisted principally in the simplification of formalities and in some cases in their entire abolition.&nbsp;To describe them, however, would cany us into details which&nbsp;would here be out of place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amendments on the Law of Succession.—</span><span class="font1">The changes made in the law of succession by Justinian’s Christian predecessors, especially&nbsp;Theodosius II. and Anastasius, were far from insignificant; but&nbsp;his own were in some directions positively revolutionary. The&nbsp;testament </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram</span><span class="font1"> of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> probably never obtained&nbsp;any firm footing in the East; for it was only by Caracalla’s con-</span></p>
