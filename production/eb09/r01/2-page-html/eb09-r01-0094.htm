The student of Raphael owes a special debt of gratitude&nbsp;for the recent labours of MM. Miintz, Gruyer, and Geymüller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Reproductions of Raphael's Works.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—From the time of Raimondi downwards no painter’s works have been so frequently engraved.&nbsp;The Calcografia Camerale (now called Regia) of Rome possesses&nbsp;an enormous number of copper-plates of his pictures by a great&nbsp;many good (and bad) engravers of this and the last century. Electrotypes of the old coppers are still worked, and are published by&nbsp;the Stamperia at very moderate prices ; in the catalogue Nos. 736&nbsp;to 894 are the works of Raphael, including several books of engravings containing whole sets, such as the Vatican loggie, &amp;c. A&nbsp;very complete collection of photographs from these and other engravings is published by Gutbier and Lübke, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rafael’s Werke, sämmt-liche Tafelbilder und Fresken,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Dresden, 188182־, in three large&nbsp;volumes, divided into classes,—pictures of the Madonna, frescos,&nbsp;stanze of the Vatican, tapestry cartoons, &amp;c. The descriptive text&nbsp;and life of Raphael are by Lübke. The Malcolm, Oxford, British&nbsp;Museum, Lille, Louvre, Dresden, and other collections of Raphael’s&nbsp;drawings have mostly been published in photographic facsimile,&nbsp;and an enormous number of illustrated monographs on single&nbsp;pictures exists. Braun’s autotypes of the stanze and Farnesina&nbsp;frescos are especially good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. H. M.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAPIN, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Paul de </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1661-1725), sieur of Thoyras, French historian, was the son of Jacques de Rapin, avocat&nbsp;at Castres (Tarn), where he was born on 25th March&nbsp;1661. He was educated at the Protestant academy of&nbsp;Saumur, and in 1679 he became an advocate, but soon&nbsp;afterwards entered the army. The revocation of the Edict&nbsp;of Nantes in 1685 and the death of his father, which&nbsp;happened two months afterwards, led him to come to&nbsp;England; but, unable to find employment there, he crossed&nbsp;to Holland and enlisted in the company of French volunteers at Utrecht commanded by Daniel de Rapin, his&nbsp;cousin-german. He accompanied the prince of Orange&nbsp;to England in 1688, and the following year Lord Kingston&nbsp;made him ensign in his regiment, with which he proceeded&nbsp;to Ireland. He took part in the siege of Carrickfergus&nbsp;and the battle of the Boyne, and was shot through the&nbsp;shoulder at the battle of Limerick. Soon afterwards he&nbsp;was promoted captain; but in 1693 he resigned in order&nbsp;to become tutor to the earl of Portland’s son. His next&nbsp;change was to return to his family, which he had settled&nbsp;at The Hague, and there he continued some years. But,&nbsp;as he found his family increase, he resolved to retire to a&nbsp;more economical residence, and accordingly removed in&nbsp;1707 to Wesel, where he commenced his great work&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">L·Histoire d'Angleterre.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though he was of a strong con</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">stitution, the seventeen years’ application entirely ruined his health. He died in 1725.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rapin was also the author of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dissertation sur les Whigs et les Torys,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1717. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L'Histoire d’Angleterre,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> embracing the period from&nbsp;the invasion of the Romans to the death of Charles L, was printed&nbsp;at The Hague in 1724 in 8 vols. It was translated into English,&nbsp;and improved with notes, by Tindal, in 2 vols, folio, 1725-31.&nbsp;Although the work of a foreigner, it is deservedly esteemed as one&nbsp;of the fullest and most impartial collections of English political&nbsp;transactions extant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RASGRAD or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Hesargrad, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a town of Bulgaria, with a station about 2 miles distant on the Varna and Rustchuk</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Railway, is situated on the Byaly Lorn, 970 feet above sea-level. It has increased in population during the last&nbsp;fifty years from 3000 to 10,000 inhabitants. In 1810 it&nbsp;was the scene of the defeat of the Turks by the Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RASHBA (רשב׳׳א) stands for three rabbins of various ages and various countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Shime'on Ben El'azar </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">was a Mishnic teacher of&nbsp;the 2d century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rabbenu Shimshon Ben Abraham </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of Sens wrote&nbsp;commentaries on various Mishnic treatises (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mishnah,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xvi. p. 506).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;R. Shelomoh Ben Abraham </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(or Ben [Ibn] Ad-dereth) was a disciple of Nachmanides, upon whom his&nbsp;master’s mantle had fallen (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ramban). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">He became&nbsp;chief rabbi of Barcelona. Here so many disciples from&nbsp;the neighbouring provinces flocked to him as to excite&nbsp;emulation among the Jews in the capital of Castile, who&nbsp;thereupon appointed the German Rabbi Asher b. Yehiel&nbsp;(Rosh). At the same time religious questions poured in&nbsp;upon him from all Israel, so that it is a marvel how he&nbsp;could go through his mere clerical work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">His works extend over the whole Talmud, although not all of them are printed. But thousands of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Responsa</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> have been printed,&nbsp;while many others lie in MS. at Cambridge (Add. 500). Of his&nbsp;other works, the enumeration of which would occupy columns,&nbsp;mention can be made only of his explanations of the Agadoth of&nbsp;the Babylonian Talmud, containing polemic against both Christians&nbsp;and Moslems (MS., Univ. Camb., Add. 1567, 1). On his part in&nbsp;the Maimonidean controversy see Schiller-Szinessy, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Catalogue,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> i.&nbsp;187 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sq.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(S. M. S.-S.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RASHBAM. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rabbenu Shemuel Ben Meer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">commonly called, from his title and the initials of his own and his&nbsp;father’s names, Rashbam, was born at Rameru (Ramerupt&nbsp;near Troyes, in France) about 1080. He was almost the&nbsp;greatest Talmudist of his time, the only two excelling him&nbsp;till 1105 being Rashi and later on his own younger brother,&nbsp;Rabbenu Ya'akob, better known as Rabbenu Tham. In&nbsp;Bible criticism and exegesis, however, he excelled all the&nbsp;men of the 11th and 12th centuries, even if we include&nbsp;R. Menahem b. Helbo, R. Yoseph Bekhor Shor, and R.&nbsp;Yoseph Kara of the Franco-Ashkenazic school, and&nbsp;Abraham Ibn 'Ezra of the Sepharadic school. Rashbam&nbsp;was the son of Yokhebed, second daughter of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rashi </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q.v.),&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and of Rabbenu Meir of Rameru (b. Shemuel). He sue-ceeded his grandfather Rashi as head of the Rabbinical&nbsp;college, and probably also of the congregation, of Troyes.&nbsp;Later, however, we meet him at other places, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Caen,&nbsp;Loudun. He died about 1160.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Of his works the following are known. (1) Commentaries on the Bible: </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> his commentary on the Pentateuch, uncritically&nbsp;edited several times </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(ed. princeps,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Berlin, 1705), and critically and&nbsp;most ably for the first time by Rosin of Breslau (1881, 8vo); (</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">b)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">commentaries on most of the other books of the Bible, the greater&nbsp;part of which are now lost, but the existence of which is in early&nbsp;times fully testified to. Those on Ecclesiastes and Canticles@@<sup>1</sup> were&nbsp;published by Dr Jellinek at Leipsic (1855, 8vo); specimens of both&nbsp;books have been translated into English by Dr Ginsburg </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Song of&nbsp;Songs,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> London, 1857, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Coheleth,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> London, 1861).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) Com-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rashi on the Riph,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the Mishnah, iii. 5, catchword ¡ועל הזק). Commentaries on five other treatises are distinctly referred to by&nbsp;old authorities,@@<sup>2</sup> but Rashi’s commentaries so thoroughly eclipsed&nbsp;all those written before and after him that none of them had a&nbsp;chance of surviving, except in the shape of a supplement. (3)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Additamenta</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tosaphoth</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> ; see Rabbinovicz </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(variae lectiones),</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> ii.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present writer cannot share the opinion of those who, because&nbsp;of the Agadic explanations with which that commentary abounds, call&nbsp;Rashbam’s authorship in question. Ibn ’Ezra himself, who was sober&nbsp;thinker enough, is compelled in Canticles to resort to the Rabbinic&nbsp;explanation,—a proceeding and a method in which every modern commentator must take refuge, unless he wishes to explain the book as a&nbsp;merely profane one.</span></p>
