. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Anas,</hi> n⁰ 6.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Nova</hi> SCOTIA, or <hi rend="italic">New</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Scotland,</hi> one of the Britiſh feulements in North America, ſituated between 43⁰and 49° north latitude, and between 60⁰ and 67⁰ weſt longitude, is bounded by the river St Laurence on the north; by the gulph of St Laurence and the Atlantic ocean on the eaſt; by the ſame ocean on the ſouth; and by Canada and New England on the weſt. —In the year 1784, this province was divided into two governments. The province and government now ſtyled New <hi rend="italic">Brunſwick</hi> is bounded on the weſtward of the mouth of the river St Croix, by the ſaid river to its ſource, and by a line drawn due north from thence to the ſouthern boundary of the province of Quebec, to the northward by the ſaid boundary as far as the weſtern extremity of the Bay de Chaleurs, to the eaſtward by the ſaid bay to the gulph of St Laurence to the bay called <hi rend="italic">Bay Verte,</hi> to the ſouth by a line in the centre of the Bay of Fundy, from the river St Croix aforeſaid, to the mouth of the Muſquat river, by the ſaid river to its ſource, and from thence by a due eaſt line acroſs the Iſthmus into the Bay Verte, to join the eaſtern lot above deſcribed, including all iſlands within fix leagues of the coaſt.</p><p>The chief rivers are, the river of St Laurence, which forms the northern boundary. The rivers Riſgouche and Nipiſiguit run from weſt to eaſt, and fall into the bay of St Laurence. The rivers of St John, Paſſamagnadi, Penobſcot and St Croix, which run from</p><p>north to ſouth, fall into Fundy Bay, or the ſea a little to the eaſtward oſ it</p><p>The ſeas adjoining to it are, the Atlantic ocean, Fundy Bay, and the gulph of St Laurence. The leſſer bays are, Chenigto and Green Bay upon the iſthmus which joins the north part of Nova Scotia to the ſouth; and the Bay of Chaleurs on the north-eaſt; the Bay of Chedibucto on the ſouth-eaſt; the Bay of the Iſlands, the Ports of Bart, Chebucto, Proſper, St Margaret, La Heve, port Maltois, port Ryſignol, port Vert, and port Joly, on the ſouth; port La Tour on the ſouth-eaſt; port St Mary, Anapolis, and Minas on the ſouth ſide of Fundy Bay, and port Roſeway, now the moſt populous of all. — The chief capes are, Cape Portage, Ecoumenac, Tourmentin, Cape Port, and Epis, on the eaſt; Cape Fogerie and Cape Canceau on the ſouth-eaſt Cape Blanco, Cape Vert, Cape Theodore, Cape Dore, Cape La Heve, and Cape Negro, on the ſouth; Cape Sable and Cape Fourche on the ſouth-weſt. —The lakes are very numerous, but have not yet received particular names.</p><p>The face of the country, when viewed at a diſtance, preſents a pleaſingly variegated appearance of hills and valleys, with ſcarcely any thing like mountains to interrupt the proſpect, eſpecially near the ſea. A nearer approach diſcovers thoſe ſublime and beautiful ſcenes which are ſo far ſuperior to the gaudy embelliſhments of art. Immenſe foreſts, formed of the talleſt trees, the growth of ages, and reaching almoſt to the clouds, everywhere cover and adorn the land: Their leaves falling in autumn, add continually to that cruſt of moſs, vegetables, and decaying wood, that has for many centuries been accumulating; whilſt the rays of the ſun, unable to pierce the thick ſhade which everywhere covers the ground, leaves it in a perpetual ſtate of damp and rottenneſs; a circumſtance which contributes, in no ſmall degree, to increaſe the ſharpneſs of the air in winter.</p><p>The clouds, flying over the higher grounds, which are covered in every direction with one vaſt foreſt, and arreſted by the attraction of the woods, fill the country with water. Every rock has a ſpring, and every ſpring cauſes a ſwamp or moraſs, oſ greater or leſs extent in proportion to its cauſe: hence it is, that travelling becomes almoſt impracticable in ſummer, and is ſeldom attempted, but in the fall of the year, when winter begins to ſet in, and the ground is already frozen.</p><p>The land throughout the peninſula is in no part mountainous, but frequently riſes into hills of gradual aſcent, everywhere clothed with wood. From theſe ariſe innumerable ſprings and rivulets, which not only fertilize and adorn the country, but have formed, in the midſt of it, a large lake or piece of freſh water, which is of various depths, and of which, however, little more is known, than that it has upon its borders very large tracts of meadow-land highly improveable. That part of the province which is beyond the Bay of Fundy, and extends to the river St Laurence, riſes alſo gradually as we advance from the ſea quite to Canada, but is, however, hardly anywhere mountainous. Its lands are for the moſt part very rich, particularly at a diſtance from the ſea; and its woods abound with the hardeſt and loftieſt trees.</p><p>Though this country, like Canada, is ſubject to long<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0727.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0721"/>
and ſevere winters, ſucceeded by ſudden and violent heats, often much greater than what are felt in the ſame latitudes in Europe, yet it cannot be accounted an unhealthy climate. The air in general in winter is very ſharp. froſty, and dry; the ſky ſerene and unclouded, by which every kind of exerciſe adapted to the ſeaſon is rendered pleaſant and agreeable. The fogs are frequent near the ſea, but ſeldom ſpread themſelves to any diſtance in land.</p><p>The winter commonly breaks up with heavy rains, and the inhabitant experience hardly any of the delights of the ſpring, which in England is accounted the moſt agreeable ſeaſon of the year. From a lifeleſs and dreary appearance, and the gloomy ſcenes of winter wrapped around the vegetable world, the country throws off its diſguſtful attire, and in a few days exhibits a grand and pleaſant proſpect; the vegetation being inconceivably rapid, nature paſſes ſuddenly from one extreme to another, in a manner utterly unknown to countries accuſtomed to a gradual progreſſion of ſeaſons. And, ſtrange as it may appear, it is an acknowledged fact, a fact which furniſhes a certain proof of the purity of the air, that theſe ſudden changes ſeldom, if ever, affect the health of ſtrangers or Europeans.</p><p>In this country agriculture has yet made but ſmall progreſs. Nova Scotia is almoſt a continued foreſt, producing every kind of wood which grows in the neighbouring provinces of New England. Four fifths of all the lands in the province are covered with pines, which are valuable not only for furniſhing mails, ſpars, lumber for the ſugar plantations, and timber for building, but for yielding tar, pitch, and turpentine, commodities which are all procured from this uſeful tree, and with which the mother-country may in a few years eaſily be ſupplied.</p><p>All the various ſpecies of birch, beech, and maple, and ſeveral forts of ſpruce, are found in all parts in great abundance; as alſo numerous herbs and plants, either not common to, or not known in, England. Amongſt theſe none is more plentiful than ſarſaparilla, and a plant whoſe root reſembles rhubarb in colour, taſte, and effects; likewiſe the Indian or mountain tea, and maiden-hair, an herb much in repute for the ſame purpoſe, with ſhrubs producing ſtrawberries, raſpberries, and many other pleaſant fruits, with which the woods in ſummer are well ſtored: Of theſe wild productions the cherries are beſt, though ſmaller than ours, and growing in bunches ſomewhat reſembling grapes. The ſaſſafras tree grows plentiſully in common with others; but amongſt them none is more uſeful to the inhabitants than a ſpecies of maple, diſtinguiſhed by the name of the <hi rend="italic">ſugar tree,</hi> as affording a conſiderable quantity of that valuable ingredient. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Sugar.</hi></p><p>Amongſt the natural productions of Nova Scotia, it is neceſſary to enumerate their iron-ore, which is ſuppoſed equally good with that found in any part of America.</p><p>Limeſtone is likewiſe found in many places; it is extremely good, and is now much tiled lor building: independent of which, it gives the farmers and landholders a great advantage for improving the ground, as it is found by experience to be one of the molt approved things in the world for that purpoſe.</p><p>Several of the uſeful and moſt common European Fruits have been planted in many places; ſo that the</p><p>province now produces great quantities of apples, ſome pears, and a few plums, which are all good of their kind, eſpecially the former. The ſmaller fruits, ſuch as currants, gooſeberries, &amp;c. grow to as great perfection as in Europe; and the ſame may be ſaid of all the common and uſeful kinds of garden plants. Among theſe their potatoes have the preference, as being the moſt ſerviceable in a country abounding with fiſh; and indeed they are not to be exceeded in goodneſs by any in the world. The maize, or Indian corn, is a native of much warmer climates; and, though planted here, never arrives at more than two thirds of its natural bigneſs; a defect which ariſes as well horn the ſhortneſs of the ſummer as the gravelly nature of the ſoil. Tobacco may likewiſe be cultivated with eaſe in Nova Scotia, as it is already everywhere in Canada, from Lake Champlain to the iſle of Orleans, for the purpoſe of internal conſumption.</p><p>This country is not deficient in the animal productions of the neighbouring provinces, particularly deer, beavers, and otters. Wild fowl, and all manner of game, and many kinds of European fowls and quadrupeds, have from time to time been brought into it and thrive well. At the cloſe of March the fiſh begin to ſpawn, when they enter the rivers in ſuch ſhoals as are incredible. Herrings come up in April, and the ſturgeon and ſalmon in May. But the moſt valuable appendage of New Scotland is the Cape Sable coaſt, along which is one continued range of cod-fiſhing banks and excellent harbours. This fiſhery employs a great number of men, in ſome ſeaſons not leſs than 10,000, when 120,00 quintals will be caught, of which 40, 000 may be exported. Theſe, at the loweſt price, muſt bring into the colony L. 26, 000 Sterling, either in caſh or in commodities neceſſary to the inhabitants.</p><p>Notwithſtanding the, comparatively uninviting appearance of this country, it was here that ſome of the firſt European ſettlements were made. The firſt grant of lands in it was given by James I. to his ſecretary Sir William Alexander, from whom it had the name of <hi rend="italic">Nova Scotia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">New Scotland.</hi> Since that period it has frequently changed hands from one private proprietor to another, and from the French to the Engliſh nation backward and forward.</p><p>It was in 1604 that the French firſt ſettled in Nova Scotia, to which they gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Acadia.</hi> Inſtead of fixing towards the eaſt of the peninſula, where they would have had larger ſeas, an eaſy navigation, and plenty of cod, they choſe a ſmall bay, afterwards called French Bay, which had none of theſe advantages. It has been ſaid, that they were invited by the beauty of Port Royal, where a thouſand ſhips may ride in ſafety from every wind, where there is an excellent bottom, and at all times four or five fathoms of water, and eighteen at the entrance. It is more probable that the founders of this colony were led to chooſe this ſituation, from its vicinity to the countries abounding in furs, of which the excluſive trade had been granted to them.</p><p>This conjecture is confirmed by the following circumſtance: that both the firſt monopolizers, and thoſe who ſucceeded them, took the utmoſt pains to divert the attention of their countrymen, whom an unſettled diſpoſition, or neceſſity, brought into theſe regions, from the clearing of the woods, the breeding of cattle, fiſhing, and every kind of culture; chooſing rather to<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0728.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0722"/>
engage the induſtry of theſe adventurers in hunting or in trading with the ſavages.</p><p>This colony was yet in its infancy when the ſettlement, which has ſince become ſo famous under the name of <hi rend="italic">Neva England,</hi> was firſt eſtabliſhed in its neighbourhood. The rapid ſucceſs of the plantations in this new colony did not much attract the notice of the French. This kind of proſperity did not excite any jealouſy between the two nations. But when they began to ſuſpect that there was likely to be a competition for the beaver trade and furs, they endeavoured to ſecure to themſelves the ſole property of it, and were unfortunate enough to ſucceed.</p><p>At their firſt arrival in Acadia, they had found the peninſula, as well as the foreſts of the neighbouring continent, peopled with ſmall ſavage nations, who went under the general name of <hi rend="italic">Abenakies.</hi> Though equally fond of war as other ſavage nations, they were more ſociable in their manners. The miſſionaries eaſily inſinuating themſelves among them, had ſo far inculcated their tenets, as to make enthuſiaſts of them. At the ſame time that they taught them their religion, they inſpired them with that hatred which they themſelves entertained for the Engliſh name. This fundamental article of their new worſhip, being that which made the ſtrongeſt impreſſion on their ſenſes, and the only one that favoured their paſſion for war, they adopted it with all the rage that was natural to them. They not only refuſed to make any kind of exchange with the Engliſh, but alſo frequently diſturbed and ravaged the frontiers of that nation.</p><p>This produced perpetual hoſtilities between the New Englanders and the French ſettlers in Acadia, till that province was, at the peace of Utrecht, for ever ceded to the Engliſh, who ſeemed not for a long time to diſcover the value of their new acquiſition. They reſtored to it its ancient name of <hi rend="italic">Nova Scotia;</hi> and having built a ſlight fortification at Port-Royal, which they called <hi rend="italic">Annapolis</hi> in honour of Queen Anne, they contented themſelves with putting a very ſmall garriſon into it. In proceſs of time, however, the importance of Nova Scotia to the commerce of Great Britain began to be perceived; and at the peace of 1749, the miniſtry offered particular advantages to all perſons who choſe to go over and ſettle in Acadia. Every ſoldier, ſailor, and workman, was to have 50 acres of land for himſelf, and ten for every perſon he carried over in his family. All non-commiſſioned officers were allowed 80 for themſelves, and 15 for their wives and children; enſigns 200; lieutenants 300; captains 400; and all officers of a higher rank 600; together with 30 for each of their dependents. The land was to be tax free for the firſt ten years, and never to pay above one livre two ſols ſix deniers<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">* About 18 Sterling.</hi></p></note> * for fifty acres. Beſide this the government engaged to advance or reimburſe the expences of paſſage, to build houſes, to furniſh all the neceſſary inſtruments for fiſhery or agriculture, and to defray the expences of ſubſiſtence for the firſt year. Theſe encouragements determined 3750 perſons, in the month of May 1749, to go to America, in hopes of bettering their fortune,</p><p>Thus encouraged, the province of Nova Scotia began to flouriſh, though in 1769 it ſent out only 14 veſſels and 148 boats, which together amounted to 7324 tons, and received 22 veſſels and 120 boats, which together made up 7000 tons. They conſtructed three ſloops, which did not exceed no tons burden. Their exportation for Great Britain and for the other parts of the globe did not amount to more than 729, 850 livres 12 ſols 9 deniers<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">† About L. 30,410,8 s. 10d. Sterling.</hi></p></note> †. Continuing, however, true to its allegiance when the other colonies threw off the dominion of Great Britain, it has now become a place of great conſequence both to the mother-country and the Weſt Indies. Its ſhipping and ſeamen are rapidly increaſing, as well as its produce, which affords the pleaſing proſpect of being able to ſupply itſelf with all the neceſſaries of life. The number of perſons who have abandoned their habitations in the more ſouthern provinces, and ſettled either there or in Canada, cannot be eſtimated, by the moſt moderate calculation, at leſs than 80,000; and it is without doubt the moſt convenient in point of ſituation of any province in America for a maritime power of Europe to be poſſeſſed of.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scotia,</hi> in architecture, a ſemicircular cavity or channel between the tores in the baſes of columns.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
