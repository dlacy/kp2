<p><span class="font1">ROEMER, FRIEDRICH ADOLPH (1809-1869), German geologist, was born at Hildesheim, in Prussia, on the 14th of&nbsp;April 1809. His father was a lawyer and councillor of the&nbsp;high court of justice. In 1845 he became professor of&nbsp;mineralogy and geology at Clausthal, and in 1862 director&nbsp;of the School of Mines. He first described the Cretaceous and&nbsp;Jurassic strata of Germany in elaborate works entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die&nbsp;Versteinerungen des Norddeutschen Oolithen-gebirges</span><span class="font1"> (1836-39),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Versteinerungen des Norddeutschen KreiAegebirgcs</span><span class="font1"> (1S40-1841) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Versteinerungen des Harzgebirges</span><span class="font1"> (1843). He&nbsp;died at Clausthal on the 25th of November 1869.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His brother, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Carl Ferdinand von Roemer</span><span class="font1"> (1818-1891), who had been educated for the legal profession at Göttingen,&nbsp;also became interested in geology, and abandoning law in&nbsp;1840, studied science at the university of Berlin, where he&nbsp;graduated Ph.D. in 1842. Two years later he published his&nbsp;first work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Das Rheinische Übergangsgebirge</span><span class="font1"> (1844), in which&nbsp;he dealt with the older rocks and fossils. In 1845 he paid a&nbsp;visit to America, and devoted a year and a half to a careful&nbsp;study of the geology of Texas and other Southern states.&nbsp;He published at Bonn in 1849 a general work entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Texas,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">while the results of his investigations of the Cretaceous rocks&nbsp;and fossils were published three years later in a treatise, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die&nbsp;KreiAebilAungen von Texas und ihre organischen Einschlüsse&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1852), which included also a general account of the geology,&nbsp;and gained for him the title “ Father of the geology of Texas.”&nbsp;Subsequently he published at Breslau </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Silurische Fauna des&nbsp;westlichen Tennessee</span><span class="font1"> (i860). During the preparation of these&nbsp;works he was from 1847 to 1855 “ privat-docent ” at Bonn,&nbsp;and was then appointed professor of geology, palaeontology&nbsp;and mineralogy in the university of Breslau, a post which he&nbsp;held with signal success as a teacher until his death. As a&nbsp;palaeontologist he made important contributions to our&nbsp;knowledge especially of the invertebrata of the Devonian&nbsp;and older rocks. He assisted H. G. Bronn with the third&nbsp;edition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lethaea geognostica</span><span class="font1"> (1851-56), and subsequently he laboured on an enlarged and revised edition, of&nbsp;which he published one section, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lethaea palaeozoica</span><span class="font1"> (1876-1883). In 1862 he was called on to superintend the preparation of a geological map of Upper Silesia, and the results of&nbsp;his researches were embodied in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geologie von Oberschlesien&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(3 vols., 1870). As a mineralogist he was likewise well known,&nbsp;more particularly by his practical teachings and by the collection he formed in the Museum at Breslau. He died at Breslau&nbsp;on the 14th of December 1891.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROEMER, OLE (Latinized </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Olaus)</span><span class="font1"> (1644-1710), Danish astronomer, was born </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font1">Aarhuus in Jutland on the 25th of September 1644. He became in 1662 the pupil and amanuensis of Erasmus&nbsp;Bartholinus at Copenhagen, and assisted J. Picard in 1671 to&nbsp;determine the geographical position of Tycho Brahe’s observatory (Uraniborg on the island of Hveen). In 1672 he accompanied Picard to Paris, where he remained nine years, occupied&nbsp;with observations at the new royal observatory and hydraulic&nbsp;works at Versailles and Marly. On the 22nd of November&nbsp;1675 he read a paper before the Academy on the successive&nbsp;propagation of light as revealed by a certain inequality in the&nbsp;motion of the first of Jupiter’s satellites. A scientific mission&nbsp;to England in 1679 made him acquainted with Newton, Halley&nbsp;and Flamsteed. In 1681, on the summons of Christian V.,&nbsp;king of Denmark, he returned to Copenhagen as royal mathematician and professor of astronomy in the university ; and&nbsp;from 1688 he discharged, besides, many important administrative functions, including those of mayor (1705), chief of&nbsp;police and privy councillor. He died at Copenhagen on the&nbsp;23rd of September 1710.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roemer will always be remembered as the discoverer of the finite velocity of light. He showed besides wonderful ingenuity in the improvement of astronomical apparatus. The&nbsp;first transit instrument worthy the name was in 1690 erected&nbsp;in his house. In the same year he set up in the university&nbsp;observatory an instrument with altitude and azimuth circles&nbsp;(for observing equal altitudes on both sides of the meridian)&nbsp;and an equatorial telescope. In 1704 he built, at his own cost,&nbsp;the so-called “ Tusculan ” observatory at Vridlosemagle, a&nbsp;few miles west of Copenhagen, and equipped it with a meridian&nbsp;circle (the transit instrument and vertical circle combined) and&nbsp;a transit moving in the prime vertical. Roemer thus effectively&nbsp;realized nearly all our modern instruments of precision, and&nbsp;accumulated with them a large mass of observations, all of&nbsp;which unfortunately perished in the great conflagration of the&nbsp;21st of October 1728, except the three nights’ work discussed&nbsp;by J. G. Galle (O. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roemeri triduum observationum astronomic&nbsp;carum a. 1706 institutarum,</span><span class="font1"> Berlin, 1845).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROERMOND, a town in the province of Limburg, Holland, on the right bank of the Maas at the confluence of the Roer,&nbsp;and a junction station 28 m. by rail N.N.E. of Maastricht.&nbsp;Pop. (1900) 12,348. The old fortifications have been dismantled and partlyconverted into fine promenades. At this&nbsp;point the Maas is crossed by a bridge erected in 1866-67, <sup>an</sup>^&nbsp;the Roer by one dating from 1771, replacing an older structure,&nbsp;and connecting Roermond with the suburb of St Jacob.&nbsp;Roermond is the seat of a Roman Catholic episcopal see. The&nbsp;finest building in the town is the Romanesque minster church&nbsp;of the first quarter of the 13th century. In the middle of the&nbsp;nave is the tomb of Gerhard III., count of Gelderland, and his&nbsp;wife Margaret of Brabant. It was formerly the church of a&nbsp;Cistercian nunnery, and in modern times has been elaborately&nbsp;restored. The cathedral of St Christopher is also of note; on&nbsp;the top of the tower (246 ft.) is a copper statue of the saint, and&nbsp;the interior is adorned with paintings by Rubens, Jacob de&nbsp;Wit (1695-1754) and others. The Reformed church was once&nbsp;the chapel of the monastery of the AIinorites. There is also&nbsp;a Redemptorist chapel. The old bishop’s palace is now the&nbsp;courthouse, and the old Jesuits* monastery with its fine gardens&nbsp;a higher-burgher school. Woollen, cotton, silk and mixed&nbsp;stuffs, paper, flour and beer are manufactured at Roermond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Close to Roermond on the west is the village of Hom, once the seat of a lordship of the same name, which is first mentioned&nbsp;in a document of 1166. The lordship of Hom was a fief of&nbsp;the counts of Loon, and after 1361·of the bishop of Liège; but&nbsp;in 1450 it was raised to a countship by the Emperor Frederick II.&nbsp;On the extinction of the house of Hom in 1540, the countship&nbsp;passed to the famous Philip of AIontmorency, who, with the&nbsp;count of Egmont, was executed in Bmssels in 1568 by order of&nbsp;the duke of Alva. In the beginning of the next century the&nbsp;countship was forcihly retained by the see of Liège, and was&nbsp;incorporated in the French department of the Lower Maas at&nbsp;the end of the 18th century. The ancient castle is in an excellent state of preservation and is sometimes used for the&nbsp;assembly of the states.</span></p>
