<p><span class="font3">dwelt upon by T. H. Huxley </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Proc. Zool. Society,</span><span class="font3"> 1867, pp. 420-422) and W. A. Forbes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(op. cit.,</span><span class="font3"> 1881, pp. 784-87). There can be little doubt that they should be regarded as types of as many&nbsp;orders—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Struthiones</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rheae</span><span class="font3">—of the subclass Ratitae. Structural characters no less important separate the rheas from&nbsp;the emeus; the former can be readily recognized by the rounded&nbsp;form of their contour-feathers, which want the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hyporrhachis&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">or after-shaft that in the emeus and cassowaries is so long as&nbsp;to equal the main shaft, and contributes to give these latter&nbsp;groups the appearance of being covered with shaggy hair. The&nbsp;feathers of the rhea have a considerable market value, and for&nbsp;the purpose of trade in them it is annually killed by thousands,&nbsp;so that@@<sup>1</sup> its total extinction as a wild animal is probably only&nbsp;a question of time. It is polygamous, and the male performs&nbsp;the duty of incubation, brooding more than a score of eggs,&nbsp;the produce of several females—facts known to Nieremberg</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3">more than two hundred and fifty years since, but hardly accepted by naturalists until recently. No examples of this bird seem&nbsp;to have been brought to Europe before the beginning of the&nbsp;present century, and accordingly the descriptions previously&nbsp;given of it by systematic writers were taken at second hand and&nbsp;were mostly defective if not misleading. In 1803 J. Latham&nbsp;issued a wretched figure of the species from a half-grown specimen in the Leverian Museum, and twenty years later said he&nbsp;had seen only one other, and that still younger, in Bullock’s&nbsp;collection </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Gen. Hist. Birds,</span><span class="font3"> viii. p. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">37g).@@</span><span class="font3"><sup>2</sup> A bird living in confinement at Strassburg in 1806 was, however, described and&nbsp;figured by Hammer in 1808 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann. du Muséum,</span><span class="font3"> xii. pp. 427-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3">433j pl· 39)· </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">In</span><span class="font3"> England the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font3"> of the Zoological Society for 1833 announced the rhea as having been exhibited for the&nbsp;first time in its gardens during the preceding twelvemonth.&nbsp;Since then many other living examples have been introduced,&nbsp;and it has bred both there and in many private parks in Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Though considerably smaller than the ostrich, and wanting its fine plumes, the rhea in general aspect far more resembles&nbsp;that bird than the other Ratitae. The feathers of the head and&nbsp;neck, except on the crown and nape, where they are dark brown,&nbsp;are dingy white, and those of the body ash-coloured tinged with&nbsp;brown, while on the breast they are brownish-black, and on the&nbsp;belly and thighs white. In the course of the memorable voyage&nbsp;of the “ Beagle,” C. Darwin came to hear of another kind of&nbsp;rhea, called by his informants </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Avestruz petise,</span><span class="font3"> and at Port&nbsp;Desire on the east coast of Patagonia he obtained an example&nbsp;of it, the imperfect skin of which' enabled J. Gould to descrihe&nbsp;it </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Proc. Zool. Society,</span><span class="font3"> 183.7, p. 35) as a second species of the&nbsp;genus, naming it after its discoverer. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rhea darwini</span><span class="font3"> differs&nbsp;in several well-marked characters from the earlier known&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R. americana.</span><span class="font3"> Its bill is shorter than its head; its tarsi are&nbsp;reticulated instead of Scutellated in front, with the upper part&nbsp;feathered instead of being bare; and the plumage of its body&nbsp;and wings is very different, each feather being tipped with a&nbsp;distinct whitish band, while that of the head and neck is greyish-brown. A further distinction is also asserted to be shown by&nbsp;the eggs—those of R. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">americana</span><span class="font3"> being of a yellowish-white,&nbsp;while those of R. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">darwini</span><span class="font3"> have a bluish tinge. Some years&nbsp;afterwards P. L. Sclater described </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{op. cit.,</span><span class="font3"> i860, p. 207) a third&nbsp;and smaller species, closely resembling the R. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">americana,</span><span class="font3"> but&nbsp;having apparently a longer bill, whence he named it R. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">macro-rhyncha,</span><span class="font3"> more slender tarsi, and shorter toes, while its general&nbsp;colour is very much darker, the body and wings being of a&nbsp;brownish-grey mixed with black. The precise geographical&nbsp;range of these three species is still undetermined. While R.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">americana</span><span class="font3"> is known to extend from Paraguay and southern&nbsp;Brazil through the La Plata region to an uncertain distance in&nbsp;Patagonia, R. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">darwini</span><span class="font3"> seems to be the proper inhabitant of the&nbsp;country last named, though M. Claraz asserts </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(op. cit.,</span><span class="font3"> 1885,&nbsp;p. 324) that it is occasionally found to the northward of the Rio&nbsp;Negro, which had formerly been regarded as its limit, and,&nbsp;moreover, that flocks of the two species commingled may be&nbsp;very frequently seen in the district between that river and the&nbsp;Rio Colorado. On the “ pampas ” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">americana</span><span class="font3"> is said to&nbsp;associate with herds of deer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cariacus campestris),</span><span class="font3"> and R.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">darwini</span><span class="font3"> to be the constant companion of guanacos </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Lama&nbsp;huanaco)—</span><span class="font3">just as in Africa the ostrich seeks the society of&nbsp;zebras and antelopes. As for R. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">macrOrhyncha</span><span class="font3">, it was found by</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Besides the works above named and those of other recognized authorities on the ornithology of South America such as Azara, ,&nbsp;Prince Max of Wied, Professor Burmeister and others, more cr less&nbsp;valuable information on the subject is to be found in Darwin’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Voyage,</span><span class="font3"> Dr Booking’s “ Monographie des Nandu ” in (Wieg-mann’s) </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Archiv für Naturgeschichte</span><span class="font3"> (1863, i. pp. 213-41); R.
