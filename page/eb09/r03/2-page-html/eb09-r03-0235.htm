<p><span class="font3">RUDDIMAN, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thomas</span><span class="font3"> (1674-1758), an eminent Scottish scholar, was born in October 1674, at Raggal, in the parish of Boyndie, Banffshire, where his father was a&nbsp;farmer. He studied Latin eagerly at the school of his&nbsp;native parish, and when sixteen started off to walk to&nbsp;Aberdeen, there to compete for a college bursary. On the&nbsp;way he was attacked by Gipsies, robbed of a guinea, which&nbsp;was all he had, and otherwise very cruelly treated ; but he&nbsp;j&gt;ersevered in his journey, reached Aberdeen, and competed&nbsp;for and won the bursary. He then entered the university,&nbsp;and four years afterwards—on 21st June 1694—received&nbsp;the degree of M.A. For some time he acted as schoolmaster at Laurencekirk in Kincardine. There he chanced&nbsp;to make the acquaintance of Dr Pitcairne, of Edinburgh,&nbsp;who persuaded him to remove to the Scottish capital,&nbsp;where he obtained the post of assistant in the Advocates’&nbsp;Library. As his salary was only £8, 6s. 8d. per annum,&nbsp;he was forced to undertake additional employment. He&nbsp;engaged in miscellaneous literary work, took pupils, and&nbsp;for some time acted as an auctioneer. His chief writings&nbsp;at this period were editions of Wilson’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">De Animi Tran-(Ruillitate Dialogus</span><span class="font3"> (1707), and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cantixi Solomanix Paraphrasis Poetixa</span><span class="font3"> (1709) of Arthur Johnstone </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(ob.</span><span class="font3"> 1641),&nbsp;editor of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Delixve Poeiarum Scotornm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1714 he published </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rudiments of the Latin Tongue, </span><span class="font3">which is even yet his best known work. This w<sup>,</sup>as intended&nbsp;to be an easy introduction to Latin grammar, and was so&nbsp;successful that it at once superseded all others. Under&nbsp;various forms it has been in use, down to our own day, in&nbsp;the schools of Scotland. In 1715 he edited, with notes&nbsp;and annotations, the works of George Buchanan in two&nbsp;volumes folio. As Ruddiman was a Jacobite, the liberal&nbsp;views of Buchanan seemed to him to call for frequent&nbsp;censure. That censure is often rather implied than openly&nbsp;expressed ; but it excited much opposition. A society of&nbsp;scholars was formed in Edinburgh to “ vindicate that incomparably learned and pious author from the calumnies&nbsp;of Mr Thomas Ruddiman” by publishing a correct edition&nbsp;of his works. This they never did ; but a number of obscure writers from this time attacked Ruddiman λvith great&nbsp;vehemence. He replied ; and it was not till the year&nbsp;before his death that he said his “ last word ” in the controversy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">His worldly affairs, meanwhile, grew more and more prosperous. He founded (1715) a successful printing&nbsp;business, and atyer some time was appointed printer to the&nbsp;university. He acquired the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Caledernian Merxury ia</span><span class="font3"> 1729,&nbsp;and in 1730 was appointed keeper of the Advocates’&nbsp;Library, which post, owing to failing health, he resigned&nbsp;in 1752. He died at Edinburgh, 19th January 1758, and&nbsp;was interred in Greyfriars churchyard, where in 1806 a&nbsp;tablet was erected to his memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Besides the works mentioned, the following writings of Ruddiman deserve notice an edition of Gavin Douglas’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Æneid</span><span class="font2"> of Virgil&nbsp;(1710); the editing and completion of Anderson’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Selxetus Diplo-rnαtum et Numisinatiim Scotiæ Tlixsaurus</span><span class="font2"> (1739) ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue of ιl</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">∣</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x&nbsp;Advocates' Lihramj</span><span class="font2"> (1733-42) ; an edition of Livy, famed for its&nbsp;“immaculate purity,” in 4 vols. (1751). Ruddimun was for many&nbsp;years the representative scholar of Scotland. Writing in 1766, Dr&nbsp;Johnson, after reproving Boswell for some bad Latin, significantly&nbsp;adds—“Rnddiman is dead.” When Boswell proposed to write&nbsp;Ruddimans life, “ I should take pleasure in helping you to do&nbsp;honour to him,” said Johnson.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Rl DE, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">François</span><span class="font3"> (1784-1855), a French sculptor of great natural talent and force of character, but of an ignorance&nbsp;as to all that did not immediately concern his art which&nbsp;can best be described as out of date. He was born at&nbsp;Dijon, 4th January 1784, and came therefore in his youth&nbsp;under the influence of the democratic and Napoleonic&nbsp;ideals in their full force. Till the age of sixteen he&nbsp;worked at his father’s trade as a Stovemaker, amusing&nbsp;himself with modelling in his free hours only ; but in&nbsp;1809 he went up to Paris from the Dijon school of art,&nbsp;and became a pupil of Castellier, obtaining the Great Prize&nbsp;in 1812. After the second restoration of the Bourbons&nbsp;he retired to Brussels, where he got some work under the&nbsp;architect Van der Straeten, who employed him to execute&nbsp;nine bas reliefs in the palace of Tervueren, which he was&nbsp;then engaged in building. At Brussels Rude married&nbsp;Sophie Fremiet, the daughter of a Bonapartist compatriot,&nbsp;to whom he had many obligations, but, obtaining with&nbsp;difficulty work so ill-paid that it but just enabled him to&nbsp;live, he gladly availed himself of the opportunity of&nbsp;return to Paris, where in 1827 a statue of the Virgin for&nbsp;St Gervais and a Mercury Fastening his Sandals obtained&nbsp;much attention. His great success dates, however, from&nbsp;1833, when he received the cross of the Legion of Honour&nbsp;for his statue of a Neapolitan Fisher Boy playing with a&nbsp;Tortoise, which also procured for him the important commission for all the ornament and one bas relief of the Arc&nbsp;de l’Étoile. This relief, a work full of energy and fire,&nbsp;immortalizes the name of Rude. Amongst other productions, we may mention the statue of Monge, 1848, Jeanne&nbsp;d’Arc (in garden of Luxembourg), 1852, a Calvary in&nbsp;bronze for the high altar of St Vincent de Paul, 1855, as&nbsp;well as Hebe and the Eagle of Jupiter, Love Triumphant,&nbsp;and Christ on the Cross, all of which appeared at the Salon&nbsp;of 1857 after his death. He had worked all his life long&nbsp;with the most extraordinary energy and given himself no&nbsp;rest in spite of the signs of failing health, and at last, on&nbsp;the 3d November 1855, he died suddenly with scarcely&nbsp;time to cry out. One of his noblest works, and easily&nbsp;accessible, is the tomb of Cavaignac, on which he placed&nbsp;beside his own the name of his favourite pupil Christophe.&nbsp;Although executed in 1840, this was not erected at Montmartre till the year after Rude’s own death. His Louis&nbsp;XIII., a life size statue, cast in silver, is to be seen at the&nbsp;Duc de Luynes’s chateau at Dampierre. Cato of Utica&nbsp;stands in the gardens of the Tuileries, and his Baptism of&nbsp;Christ decorates a chapel of the Madeleine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RUDE STONE MONUMENTS. The raising of commemorative monuments of such an enduring material as stone is a practice that may be traced in all countries&nbsp;to the remotest times. The highly sculptured statues,&nbsp;obelisks, and other monumental erections of modern civilization are but the lineal representatives of the unhewn&nbsp;monoliths, dolmens, cromlechs, &amp;c., of prehistoric times.&nbsp;Judging from the large number of the latter that have&nbsp;still survived the destructive agencies (notably those of&nbsp;man himself) to which they have been exposed during so&nbsp;many ages, it would seem that the ideas which led to their&nbsp;erection had as great a hold on humanity in its earlier&nbsp;stages of development as at the present time. In giving&nbsp;some idea of these rude monuments in Britain and elsewhere, it will be convenient to classify them as follows&nbsp;(see vol. ii. p. 383, figs. 1-4). (1) Isolated pillars or monoliths of unhewn stones raised on end are called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Menhirs&nbsp;(maen,</span><span class="font3"> a stone, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hir,</span><span class="font3"> long). (2) When these monoliths&nbsp;are arranged in lines they become </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Alignments. (2&gt;)</span><span class="font3"> But&nbsp;if their linear arrangement is such as to form an enclosure&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(enceinte),</span><span class="font3"> whether circular, oval, or irregular, the group is&nbsp;designated by the name of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cromlech</span><span class="font3"> (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cromlech).</span><span class="font3"> (4)&nbsp;Instead of the monoliths remaining separate, they are&nbsp;sometimes placed together and covered over by one or&nbsp;more capstones so as to form a rude chamber ; in this case</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
