               <p>                   <label>ROSSELLI, COSIMO</label> (1439-c. 1507), Florentine painter, was born in
                    1439. At the age of fourteen he became a pupil of Neri di Bicci, and in 1460 he
                    worked as assistant to his cousin Bernardo di Stefano Rosselli. The first work
                    of Cosimo mentioned by Vasari exists in S. Ambrogio, in Florence, over the third
                    altar on the left. It is an “ Assumption of the Virgin,” a youthful and feeble
                    work. In the same church, on the wall of one of the chapels, is a fresco by
                    Cosimo which Vasari praises highly, especially for a portrait of the young
                    scholar Pico of Mirandola. The scene, a procession bearing a miracle-working
                    chalice, is painted with much vigour and less mannerism than most of this
                    artist’s work. A picture painted by Rosselli for the church of the Annunziata,
                    with figures of SS. Barbara, Matthew and the Baptist, is in the Academy of
                    Florence. Rosselli also spent some time in Lucca, where he painted several
                    altar-pieces for various churches. A picture attributed to him, taken from the
                    church of S. Girolamo at Fiesole, is now in the National Gallery of London. It
                    is a large retable, with, in the</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0746" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0799.jp2"/>
               <p>centre, St Jerome in the wilderness kneeling before a crucifix, and at the sides
                    standing figures of St Damasus and St Eusebius, St Paolo and St Eustachia; below
                    is a predella with small subjects. Though dry and hard in treatment, the figures
                    are designed with much dignity. The Berlin Gallery possesses three pictures by
                    Rosselli: “The Virgin in Glory," “ The Entombment of Christ," and “ The Massacre
                    of the Innocents.” In 1480 Rosselli, together with the chief painters of
                    Florence, was invited by Sixtus IV. to Rome to assist in the painting of the
                    frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. Three of these were executed by him—“ The
                    Destruction of Pharaoh’s Army in the Red Sea," “ Christ Preaching by the Lake of
                    Tiberias,” and “ The Last Supper.” The last of these is well preserved, but is a
                    mediocre work. Vasari’s story about the pope admiring Rosselli*s paintings more
                    than those of his abler brother painters has probably little foundation.
                    Rosselli’s Sistine frescoes were partly painted by his assistant Piero di
                    Cosimo, who was so called after Cosimo Rosselli. His chief pupil was Fra
                    Bartolommeo. According to Vasari, Rosselli died in 1484, but this is a mistake,
                    as his will exists dated 25th of November 1506 (see Gaye, <hi rend="italic">Car.
