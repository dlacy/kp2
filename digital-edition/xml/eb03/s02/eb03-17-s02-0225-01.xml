in geometry, a line that cuts another or divides it into parts. The ſecant of a circle is a line drawn from the circumference on one ſide to a point without the circumference on the other; and it is demonſtrated by geometers, that of ſeveral ſecants drawn to the ſame point, that is the longeſt which paſſes thro’ the centre of the circle. The portions, however, of theſe ſeveral ſecants that are without the circle are ſo much the greater as they recede from the centre, and the leaſt external portion is of that ſecant which paſſes through it.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Secant,</hi> in trigonometry, denotes a right line drawn from the centre of a circle, which, cutting the circumference, proceeds till it meets with a tangent to the ſame circle. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Geometry,</hi> n⁰ 24—28.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Line of</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Secants,</hi> one of thoſe lines or ſcales which are uſually put upon ſectors. How ſuch a ſcale is formed will be ſeen by a bare inſpection of fig. 53. Plate CCXV.; for C 10, C 20, C 30, &amp;c. drawn from the centre C to the line of tangents BE, being the real ſecants of the arches B 10, B 20, B 3c, it is obvious that by marking off the diſtances B 10, B 20, B 30, upon any other line, we make that line a ſcale of ſecants.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
