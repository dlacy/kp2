tions of argumentative with narrative matter which make up the staple of the oration are next resumed, and close at last in a remonstrance against the unfairness of the comparison proposed by Æschines, between the honours of the ancient times and those now conferred.
A short peroration follows, in which Demosthenes, without attempting any summary, claims for himself, and denies to his rival, credit for possessing what he maintains to be the two principal qualifications of a good citizen ; namely, unchangeable love for his country, and a constant inclination to prompt his countrymen to noble and ambitious deeds. The foreign faction are then painted with a few bold and hurried strokes ; and the oration closes with a prayer to the gods to convert them if they will be converted, and if they will not, to cut them off from among the people, destroying a few men that the nation may be saved.
We had designed to attempt exhibiting the eloquence of the great Attic masters in a yet stronger light, by contrasting it with specimens from the lowest ages of Greek oratory ; and for that purpose we had selected one or two disputations of the learned and skilful sophist Libanius, the panegyrist of Julian the Apostate. Want of space, however, compels us to abandon this intention ; and as the same cause prevents us from entering minutely on the Orations of Cicero, we prefer leaving these altogether untouched, to passing them with a few vague generalities. The characteristics of Cicero’s admirable eloquence, and the differences between it and that of Demosthenes, are matters familiar to every one ; and the study of the Latin orator is more common than that of the Greek, nearly in the inverse proportion of the real merits of the two.
Aristotle, in his Rhetoric, makes an observation which has been sometimes treated as an extravagant paradox. He says that courts of law are the great field for the display of impassioned eloquence ; and that, on the other hand, deliberative assemblies, being convened for the purpose of determining on their own affairs, will always force a speaker to keep to the point, and are of all audiences the most intolerant of declamation. Now, with regard to the judicial tribunals of Greece in the philosopher’s own time, the first part of his assertion was unfortunately quite true ; and as to the latter part, if the proceedings in the Eccleshe of Athens did not justify it, which they probably did, those in our own British houses of parliament, which may still be considered as the only great modem schools of political eloquence, have most signally demonstrated its truth. The eloquence of our statesmen is remarkable for its tone of practical sense, the closeness of its adherence to the business immediately in hand, and its general avoidance of oratorical excitement and display, even on occasions when these are justly called for. The character of our great speakers as statesmen likewise has been inextricably mixed up with the consideration of their strictly oratorical merits ; and hence more than one of them hold in universal estimation a rank as orators, which they owe in no mean degree to their talent and success as political leaders. Altogether, while there has generally prevailed among us, and more especially till the beginning of the present century, a tendency to depreciate unduly the eloquence of our statesmen, there are yet very few of them indeed whose works could be recommended, unless with much qualification and explanation, as models for the rhetorical student. The speeches of the younger Pitt, eminently characteristic both in grasp of intellect and haughty stubbornness of will, often admirable and masterly as details of facts or expositions of principles, and frequently most highly successful in the speaker’s favourite tone of contemptuous Tecriminativcsarcasm, are but indifferently adapted for the end which we at present have in view. Those of Fox are entitled to rank far higher as speci
mens of oratory ; and indeed, for those who have purity of taste enough to relish the severer graces of a manly and practical eloquence, always drawing its materials from a vigorous and richly stored understanding, always animated by at least a calm and lofty feeling of truth and freedom, and sometimes inspired by a genuine and rapid enthusiasm, but never stooping to be graceful, nor pausing to gather ornaments on its way,—for minds which can appreciate eloquence like this, the speeches of Fox will form a treasure of models, in which they will not only find successful exemplifications of most of the principles of eloquence, but much that will remind them of the calmer moods of Demosthenes. But several others of our British statesmen, especially of those who flourished in the end of last century and the earliest years of this, deserve from the student of eloquence more industrious study than those two great men. Among these, we can do no more than name Grattan, Erskine, and Sheridan ; and we pause at the threshold of the present age, naming no man who is still alive.
But of the political orators who have preceded the present time both in the last century and this, by far the most remarkable, in a merely rhetorical point
of view,
were these three ; Chatham, Burke, and Canning.
Very many of Chatham’s speeches are unreported ; many of the earlier ones have reached us with much distortion ; and there are but a very few in which we can believe ourselves to be listening throughout to the exact words of the speaker. But enough remains to convince us that Chatham was the most powerful and striking political orator whom our country has ever produced. His celebrated youthful retort to the elder Horace Walpole bears unequivocal marks of being, in the shape in which we possess it, the manufacture of SamuelJohnson ; and we have scarcely any speech completely and genuinely reported, which was delivered before his fiftieth year. In the orations succeeding that time, our recollection of the speaker’s age and lofty position in the state prepares our minds to harmonize with the tone of address, and to consider that as noble boldness, which in a younger and meaner man might have received another name. The tone is never varied ; it is always uncompromising, stern, and admonitory : the speaker is not an advocate devising means to conciliate and persuade, but a preacher of truth and right, denouncing judgments on political transgression. Chatham’s mind never grew old ; to the last hour of his public life the feelings glowed as passionately, and prompted images as vivid, and alternately checked, and impelled, and transformed the language, in figures as abrupt and varied, as in the morning of his youth and dawning ambition ; the sickness and decay of the body were overcome by the resistless energy of the fiery soul ; and the British House of Lords trembled before the cripple who stood up feebly in the midst of them, to grow strong as he spoke by the impulse of his own fervent imagination. The idol of Chatham’s mind was the baronial constitution of England as confirmed in Magna Charta, which, indeed, with the Petition and Bill of Rights, he himself called the Englishman’s political bible : all the strong and diversified powers of his intellect, in observation, judgment, and rapidly convincing argument, and all the array of his chivalrously generous feelings, did continual homage at the one sacred shrine : attempts from below to widen the area of thc political edifice, that the mass of the Jleople might come in, the aristocratic Whig would have laughed to scorn : insidious endeavours from above and within to shake the pillars of the temple, roused him repeatedly to overwhelming indignation. His eloquence found its most favourable field of display in two questions of his time : the famous elections of W’ilkes for Middlesex, which were made the occasion of fierce debates as to the constitutional rights of the subject ; and the more
