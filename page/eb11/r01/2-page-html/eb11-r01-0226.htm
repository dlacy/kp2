<p><span class="font2">would soon be suppressed, as they had so often been in the past. The situation tended to become more, rather than less,&nbsp;complicated, and there was every variety of reformer and&nbsp;every degree of conservatism, for there were no standards&nbsp;for those who had rejected the papal supremacy, and even&nbsp;those who continued to accept it differed widely. For&nbsp;example, George of Saxony viewed Aleander, the pope’s&nbsp;nuncio, with almost as much suspicion as he did Luther&nbsp;himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The religious ideas in South Germany were affected by the development  of a reform party in Switzerland, under the influence&nbsp;of Zwingli, who claimed that at Einsiedeln, near the&nbsp;lake of Zürich, he had begun to preach the gospel of&nbsp;Christ in the year 1516 “ before any one in my locality&nbsp;had so much as heard the name of Luther.” Three&nbsp;years later he became preacher in the cathedral of Zürich.&nbsp;Here he began to denounce the abuses in the Church,&nbsp;as well as the traffic in mercenaries which had so long been a&nbsp;blot upon his country’s honour. From the first he combined&nbsp;religious and political reform. In 1523 he prepared a complete&nbsp;statement of his beliefs, in the form of sixty-seven theses. He&nbsp;maintained that Christ was the only high priest and that the&nbsp;gospel did not gain its sanction from the authority of the&nbsp;Church. He denied the existence of purgatory, and rejected&nbsp;those practices of the Church which Luther had already set&nbsp;aside. Since no one presented himself to refute him, the town&nbsp;council ratified his conclusions, so that the city of Zürich practically withdrew from the Roman Catholic Church. Next&nbsp;year the Mass, processions and the images of saints were&nbsp;abolished. The shrines were opened and the relics burned.&nbsp;Some other towns, including Bern, followed Zürich’s example,&nbsp;but the Forest cantons refused to accept the innovations. In&nbsp;1525 </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">religious and political league was arranged between&nbsp;Zürich and Constance, which in the following year was joined&nbsp;by St Gallen, Biel, Mühlhausen, Basel and Strassburg. Philip&nbsp;of Hesse was attracted by Zwingli’s energy, and was eager that&nbsp;the northern reformers should be brought into closer relations&nbsp;with the south. But the league arranged by Zwingli was&nbsp;directed against the house of Habsburg, and Luther did not&nbsp;deem it right to oppose a prince by force of arms.&nbsp;Moreover, he did not believe that Zwingli, who conceived the eucharist to be merely symbolical in its&nbsp;character, “ held the whole truth of God.” Nevertheless&nbsp;, Philip of Hesse finally arranged a religious&nbsp;conference in the castle of Marburg (1529) where Zwingli and Luther met. They were able to agree on fourteen&nbsp;out of the fifteen “ Marburg Articles,” which stated the chief&nbsp;points in the Christian faith as they were accepted by both.&nbsp;A fundamental difference as to the doctrine of the eucharist,&nbsp;however, stood in the way of the real union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The diet of Spires (1529) had received a letter from the emperor directing it to look to the enforcement of the edict of&nbsp;Worms against the heretics. No one was to preach&nbsp;against the Mass, and no one was to be prevented from&nbsp;attending it freely. This meant that the evangelical&nbsp;princes would be forced to restore the most characteristic&nbsp; Catholic rite. As they formed only a minority in&nbsp;the diet, they could only draw up a protest, which was signed by&nbsp;John Frederick of Saxony, Philip of Hesse, and fourteen of the&nbsp;three towns, including Strassburg, Nuremberg and Ulm. In&nbsp;this they claimed that the majority had no right to abrogate the&nbsp;stipulations of the former diet of Spires, which permitted each&nbsp;prince to determine religious matters provisionally for him self&nbsp;, for all had unanimously pledged themselves to observe&nbsp;that agreement. They therefore appealed to the emperor&nbsp;and to a future council against the tyranny of the majority.&nbsp;Those who signed this appeal were called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protestants,</span><span class="font2"> a name&nbsp;which came to be generally applied to those who rejected the&nbsp;supremacy of the pope, the Roman Catholic conceptions of&nbsp;the clergy and of the Mass, and discarded sundry practices of&nbsp;the older Church, without, however, repudiating the Catholic creeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the period which had elapsed since the diet of Worms, the emperor had resided in Spain, busy with a series of wars,&nbsp;waged mainly with the king of France.@@<sup>1</sup> In 1530 the&nbsp;emperor found himself in a position to visit Germany&nbsp;once more, and summoned the diet to meet at Augsburg,&nbsp;with the hope of settling the religious differences and&nbsp;bringing about harmonious action against the Turk. The Protestants were requested to submit a statement of their&nbsp;opinions, and on June 25th the “Augsburg Confession” was&nbsp;read to the diet. This was signed by the elector of Saxony&nbsp;and his son and successor, John Frederick, by George, margrave&nbsp;of Brandenburg, two dukes of Lüneburg, Philip of Hesse and&nbsp;Wolfgang of Anhalt, and by the representatives of Nuremberg&nbsp;and Reutlingen. The confession was drafted by Melanchthon,&nbsp;who sought consistently to minimize the breach which separated&nbsp;the Lutherans from the old Church. In the first part of the&nbsp;confession the Protestants seek to prove that there is nothing&nbsp;in their doctrines at variance with those of the universal Church&nbsp;“ or even of the Roman Church so far as that appears in the&nbsp;writings of the Fathers.” They made it clear that they still&nbsp;held a great part of the beliefs of the medieval Church, especially&nbsp;as represented in Augustine’s writings, and repudiated the&nbsp;radical notions of the Anabaptists and of Zwingli. In the second&nbsp;part, those practices of the Church are enumerated which the&nbsp;evangelical party rejected; the celibacy of the clergy, the Mass,&nbsp;as previously understood, auricular confession, and monastic&nbsp;vows, the objections to which are stated with much vigour. “ Christian perfection is this: to fear God sincerely, to trust*&nbsp;assuredly that we have, for Christ’s sake, a gracious and merciful&nbsp;God; to ask and look with confidence for help from him in all&nbsp;our affairs, accordingly to our calling, and outwardly to do good&nbsp;works diligently, and to attend to our vocation. In these&nbsp;things doth true perfection and a true worship of God consist.&nbsp;It doth not consist in going about begging, or in wearing a black&nbsp;or a grey cowl.” The Protestant princes declared that they had&nbsp;no intention of depriving the bishops of their jurisdiction, but&nbsp;this one thing only is requested of them, “ that they would suffer&nbsp;the gospel to be purely taught, and would relax a few observances&nbsp;in which we cannot adhere without sin.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The confession was turned over to a committee of conservative  theologians, including Eck, Faber and Cochlaeus. Their&nbsp;refutation of the Protestant positions seemed needlessly&nbsp;sharp to the emperor, and five drafts were made of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Charles finally reluctantly accepted it, although he would gladly have had it milder, for it made reconciliation hopeless. The majority of the diet approved a&nbsp;recess, allowing the Protestants a brief period of immunity until&nbsp;the 15th of April 1531, after which they were to be put down&nbsp;by force. Meanwhile, they were to make no further innovations,&nbsp;they were not to molest the conservatives, and were to aid the&nbsp;emperor in suppressing the doctrines of Zwingli and of the&nbsp;Anabaptists. The Lutheran princes protested, together with&nbsp;fourteen cities, and left the diet. The diet thereupon decided&nbsp;that the edict of Worms should at last be enforced. All Church&nbsp;property was to be restored, and, perhaps most important of all,&nbsp;the jurisdiction of the Imperial court (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reichskammergericht),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which was naturally Catholic in its sympathies, was extended&nbsp;to appeals involving the seizure of ecclesiastical benefices,&nbsp;contempt of episcopal decisions and other matters deeply affecting the Protestants. In November the Protestants formed the&nbsp;Schmalkaldic League, which, after the death of Zwingli, in 1531,&nbsp;was joined by a number of the South German towns. The&nbsp;period of immunity assigned to the Protestants passed by;&nbsp;but they were left unmolested, for the emperor was involved&nbsp;in many difficulties, and the Turks were threatening Vienna.&nbsp;Consequently, at thè diet of Nuremberg (1532) a recess was drafted indefinitely extending the religious truce and quashing&nbsp;such cases in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reichskammergericht</span><span class="font2"> as involved Protestant</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> In 1527 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1">pope’s capital was sacked by Charles’s army. This was, of course, but an incident in the purely political relations of&nbsp;the European powers with the pope, and really has no bearing upon&nbsp;the progress of the Protestant revolt.</span></p>
