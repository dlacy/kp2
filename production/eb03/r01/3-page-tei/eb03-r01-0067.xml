See Metallurgy, Part II. Clarification; and Pharmacy.</p><p>Gold and ſilver may be refined by ſeveral methods, which are all founded on the effential properties of theſe metals, and acquire different names according to their kinds. Thus, for inſtance, gold having the property which no other metal, not even filver, has of reſiſting the action of ſulphur, of antimony, of nitrous acid, of marine acid; may be purified by theſe agents from all other metallic ſubſtances, and conſequently may be re-fined. Theſe operations are diſtinguiſhed by proper names, as <hi rend="italic">purification oſ gold by antimony, parting, concentrated parting, dry parting *.</hi>  In a fimilar manner, as filver has the property, which the imperfect metals have not, of reſiſting the action of nitre, it may be refined by this ſalt : but the term <hi rend="italic">refining</hi>  is chiefly applied to the purification of gold and filver by lead in the cupel.</p><p>This is performed by the deſtruction, vitrification, and ſcorification, of all the extraneous and deſtructible metallic ſubſtances with which they are all allayed.</p><p>As none but the perfect metals can refill: tlie combined action of air and fire, without loſing their inflammable principle, and being changed into earthy or vitreous matters, incapable of remaining any longer united with ſubſtances in a metallic ſtate, there is then a poſſibility of purifying gold and ſilver from all allay of imperfect metals merely by the action of fire and air ; only by keeping them fuſed till all die allay be deſtroy-ed : but this purification would be very expenſive, from the great conſumption of fuel, and would be exceedingly tedious. Silver allayed with copper has been expofed longer than 60 hours to a glaſs-houſe fire -without being perfectly refined the reaſon of which is, that when a fmall quantity only of imperfect metal remains united with gold or filver, it is covered and protected from the action of the air, which is neceſſary for the combuſtion of the imperfect metals, as of all comhuſti-ble matters.</p><p>This refining of gold'and ſilver merely by the action of fire·, which was the only method anciently known, was very long, difficult, expenſive, and imperfect ; but a much ſhorter and more advantageous method has been diſcovered. This method conſiſts in adding to the al-layed gold and ſilver a certain quantity of lead, and in expofing afterwards this mixture to the action of the ſire. Lead is one of the metals which lofes moſt quickly and eaſily a ſufficient quantity of its inflammable principle to ceaſe te be in a metallic ſtate·; but<hi rend="sub">z</hi>  at thς ſame time, this metal has the remarkable property of retaining, notwithſtanding the action of the ſire, enough of this ſame inflammable principle to be very eaſily melted into a vitrified and powerfully vitrifying matter, called <hi rend="italic">litharge.</hi></p><p>The lead then which is to be added to the gold and ſilver to be refined, or which happens naturally to be mixed with theſe metals, produces in their refining the following advantages: 1. By increafing the proportion' of imperfect metals, it prevents them from being fo well covered and protected by the perfect metals.—-2. By uniting with theſe imperfect metals, it commu-nicates to them a property it has of lofing very eaſily a great part of its inflammable principle. 3. By its vitrifying and fufing property which it exereifes with all its force upon the calcined and naturally refractory parts of the other metals, it facilitates and accelerates the fuſion, the ſcoriſication, and thc ſeparation of thefe metals. Theſe are the advantages procured by lead in the refining of gold and ſilver.</p><p>The lead, which in this operation is ſcorified, and' fcorifies along with it the imperfect metals, ſeparates -from the metallic maſs, with which it is then incapable of remaining united. It floats upon the ſurface of the melted maſs ; becauſe, by loſing part of its phlogiſ-ton, it lofes alſo part of its ſpecific gravity, and laſtly it vitrifies.</p><p>Thefe vitrified and melted 'matters accumulating more and more upon the ſurface of the metal while thc operation advances, would protect this ſurface from the contact of air which is ſo abſolutely neceſſary for the ſcorification of the reſt, and would thus ſtop the pro-greſs of the operation, which could never be ſiniſhed, if a method had not been contrived for their removal. This removal of the vitrified matter is procured either by the nature of the veſſel in which the melted matter is contained, and which being porous, abſorbs and imbibes the ſcorified matter as faſt as it is formed, or by a chan-, nel cut in the edge, of the veſſel through which the matter flows out.</p><p>The veſſel in which the refining is performed is flat* and ſhallow, that the matter which it contains may prefent to the air the greateſt ſurface poſſible. This form reſembles that of a cup, and hence it lias been called <hi rend="italic">cupel.</hi>  The furnace ought to be vaulted, that the heat may be applied upon the'ſurſace of the metal during thc whole time- of the operation. Upon this furface a cruſt of dark-coloured pellicle is continually forming. In the inſtant when all the imperfect metal is deftroyed&gt; and conſequently the ſcorification ceaſes, the ſurface of the perfect metals is ſeen, and appears clean and brilliant. This forms a kind of fulguration or coruſ-cation. By this mark the metal is known to be refinedt If the operation be ſo conducted that the metal ſuſtains only the preciſe degree of heat neceſſary to keep it fuſed before it be perfectly refined, we may obſerve that it fixes or becomes ſolid all at once in the very in-ſtant of the eoruſcation ; becauſe a greater heat is re* quired to&gt; keep ſilver or gold in fuſion when they are pure than when allayed with lead.</p><p>Ί he operation of refining may be performed m finall or in large quantities, upon the fame principles, but only with ſome differences in the management. As the refining of final! quantities of perfect metals is performed in the ſame maimer as theſe metals are eſſay ed,· thé</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
