The papers were betrayed by Demetrios Oikonomos Kozanites into the hands&nbsp;of the Austrian government, and Rhigas was arrested at Trieste&nbsp;and handed over with his accomplices to the Turkish authorities&nbsp;at Belgrade. Immediately on arrest he attempted suicide.&nbsp;His Turkish friend, Passvan-Oglou, sought to secure his escape,&nbsp;and the government apparently consented to release him on&nbsp;the payment of a ransom of about £6000; but meanwhile the&nbsp;Turkish pasha commanding at Belgrade had taken the law into&nbsp;his own hands. Rhigas’s five companions were secretly drowned,&nbsp;but he himself offered so violent a resistance that he was shot&nbsp;by two Turkish soldiers. His last words are reported as being:&nbsp;“ I have sown a rich seed; the hour is coming when my country&nbsp;will reap its glorious fruits.” Rhigas, writing in the popular&nbsp;dialect instead of in classical Greek, aroused the patriotic&nbsp;fervour of his contemporaries and his poems were a serious&nbsp;factor in the awakening of modern Greece.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RHINE (Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhenus,</span><span class="font3"> Ger. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhein,</span><span class="font3"> Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhin,</span><span class="font1"> Dutch </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhyn, </span><span class="font3">o'r </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rijri),</span><span class="font3"> the chief river of Germany and one of the most important in Europe. It is about 850 m. in length and drains an&nbsp;area of 75,000 sq. m. The distance in a direct line between&nbsp;its source in the Alps and its mouth in the German Ocean is&nbsp;460 m. Its general course is north-north-west, but it makes&nbsp;numerous deflexions and at one point is found running in a&nbsp;diametrically opposite direction. The name Rhine, which is&nbsp;apparently of Celtic origin, is of uncertain etymology, the most&nbsp;favoured derivations being either from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">der Rinnende</span><span class="font3"> (the&nbsp;flowing), or from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rein</span><span class="font3"> (the clear), the latter being now the more&nbsp;generally accepted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Swiss Portion.—</span><span class="font3">The Rhine rises in the mountains of the Swiss canton of the Grisons, and flows for 233 m. in Swiss&nbsp;territory, within which its drainage basin includes about 14,059&nbsp;sq. m., and every canton save Geneva. The two main branches&nbsp;of the Rhine, the Hinter Rhine and the Vorder Rhine, unite&nbsp;at Reichenau, 6 m. S.W. of Coire. (1) The principal stream&nbsp;is considered to be that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hinter Rhine,</span><span class="font3"> which issues&nbsp;(7271 ft.) from the glaciers of the Rheinwaldhom group, and&nbsp;then flows first N.E. through the Rheinwald valley, and next&nbsp;N. through the Schams valley, which communicates by the&nbsp;well-known gorge of the Via Mala with the Tomleschg valley&nbsp;at Thusis, whence the stream continues its N. course to Reichenau; total length 35I m., total fall 3711 ft. It receives a&nbsp;number of mountain torrents during its course, the most important being that from the Avers- glen, and the Albula, both&nbsp;on the right, which is itself formed by many mountain streams.&nbsp;(2) The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vorder Rhine</span><span class="font3"> rises in the small Toma lake (7691 ft.),&nbsp;S. of the Oberalp Pass, not far from the St. Gotthard Pass, and&nbsp;then flows N.E. past Disentis and Ilanz, which claims the&nbsp;honour of being the “ first town on the Rhine,” to Reichenau;&nbsp;total length 42 m., total fall 3492I ft. Its chief affluents are&nbsp;the stream dignified by the name of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Medels RJtine,</span><span class="font3"> that&nbsp;rises in the Cadlimo glen, W. of the Lukmanier Pass, and, after&nbsp;flowing through the Medels glen, joins the Vorder Rhine at&nbsp;Disentis, and the Glenner, flowing from the Lugnetz glen, both&nbsp;on the right. From Reichenau the united streams flow N.E.&nbsp;to Coire, the capital of the canton of the Grisons, and then turn&nbsp;towards the N., past Ragatz, the valley broadening out, and&nbsp;the river being joined on the right by the Landquart and the 111,&nbsp;before it expands into the Lake of Constance. Extensive&nbsp;“ corrections ” of the river bed, especially the canal of Diepold-sau, have been carried out in the lower bit of this part of the&nbsp;valley, while from a little north of Ragatz the right bank belongs&nbsp;first to Liechtenstein and then to the Austrian province of the&nbsp;Vorarlberg. On issuing from the Lake of Constance at Constance, the Rhine flows nearly due west to Basel, where it leaves&nbsp;Swiss territory, the south bank during this portion of the river&nbsp;being entirely Swiss, save the town of Constance, but the north&nbsp;shore belongs to Baden, save in the case of the Swiss town&nbsp;of Stein-am-Rhein and the Swiss canton of Schaffhausen. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">chief towns on its banks are Constance (S.), Schaffhauscn (N.), Waldshut (N.), Laufenburg (S.), Sackingen (N.), Rheinfelden&nbsp;(S.), and Basel (both banks). About 1 j m. below Schaffhausen&nbsp;the river forms the famous Falls of the Rhine, or Falls of Schaff-hausen (60 ft. high), while at Coblenz, opposite Waldshut, it&nbsp;receives its chief affluent, the Aar, recently swollen by the&nbsp;Reuss and the Limmat, and of greater volume than the river&nbsp;in which it loses its identity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. A. B. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">2. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The German and Dutch Portion.—</span><span class="font3">After Basel, when the Rhine turns to the north and enters Germany, its breadth is&nbsp;between 550 and 600 ft., while its surface now lies not more than&nbsp;800 ft. above the sea, showing that the river has made a descent&nbsp;of 6900 ft. by the time it has traversed a third of its course.&nbsp;From Basel to Mainz the Rhine flows through a wide and&nbsp;shallow valIey, bordered on the east and west by the parallel&nbsp;ranges of the Black Forest and the Vosges. Its banks are low&nbsp;and flat, and numerous islands occur. The tendency to divide&nbsp;into parallel branches has been curbed in the interests of navigation, and many windings have been cut off by leading the water&nbsp;into straight and regular channels. At Mannheim the river&nbsp;is nearly 1500 ft. in width, and at Mainz, where it is diverted&nbsp;to the west by the barrier of the Taunus, it is still wider. It&nbsp;follows the new direction for about 20 m., but at Bingen&nbsp;it again turns to the north and begins a completely new stage&nbsp;of its career, entering a narrow valley in which the enclosing&nbsp;rocky hills abut so closely on the river as often barely to leave&nbsp;room for the road and railway on either bank; during this&nbsp;portion of its course the speed of the current at a normal state&nbsp;of the water exceeds 6 m. an hour. This is the most beautiful&nbsp;part of the whole course of the river, abounding in ruined&nbsp;castles, romantic crags and sunny vineyards. At Coblenz the&nbsp;valley widens and the river is 1200 ft. broad, but the hills close&nbsp;in again at Andemach, and this ravine-like part of its course&nbsp;cannot be considered as ending till below the Siebengebirge&nbsp;(Seven Motmtains), where the river once more expands to a&nbsp;width of 1300-1600 ft. Beyond Bonn and Cologne the banks&nbsp;are again flat and the valley wide, though the hills on the right&nbsp;bank do not completely disappear till the neighbourhood of&nbsp;Düsseldorf. Farther on the country traversed by the Rhine is&nbsp;perfectly level, and the current becomes more and more sluggish.&nbsp;On entering Holland, which it does below Emmerich, its course&nbsp;is again deflected to the west. Within Holland the banks&nbsp;are so low as to require at places to be protected by embankments against inundations. Almost immediately after entering&nbsp;Holland the stream divides into two arms, the larger of which,&nbsp;carrying off about two-thirds of the water, diverges to the west,&nbsp;is called the Waal, and soon unites with the Maas. The smaller&nbsp;branch to the right retains the name of Rhine and sends off&nbsp;another arm, called the Yssel, to the Zuider Zee. The Rhine&nbsp;now pursues a westerly course almost parallel with that of the&nbsp;Waal. At Wijk another bifurcation takes place, the broad Lek&nbsp;diverging on the left to join the Maas, while the “ Kromme&nbsp;Rijn ” to the right is comparatively insignificant. Beyond&nbsp;Utrecht, where it is again diminished by the divergence of the&nbsp;Vecht to the Zuider Zee, the river under the name of the “ Oude&nbsp;Rijn,” or Old Rhine, degenerates into a sluggish and almost&nbsp;stagnant stream, which requires the artificial aid of a canal&nbsp;and of sluices in finding its way to the sea. In Roman times&nbsp;the Rhine at this part of its course seems to have been a full and&nbsp;flowing river, but by the 9th century it had lost itself in the&nbsp;sands of Katwijk, and it was not until the beginning of the&nbsp;19th century that its way to the sea was re-opened. Though&nbsp;the name Rhine thus at last attaches to a very insignificant&nbsp;stream, the entire district between the Waal on one side </span><span class="font1">and&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">the Yssel on the other, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Insula Batavorum</span><span class="font3"> of Caesar, in&nbsp;reality belongs to tfie delta of the famous river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tributaries.</span><span class="font2">—The Rhine is said to receive, directly or indirectly, the waters of upwards of 12,000 tributaries of all sizes. Leaving&nbsp;out of account the innumerable glacier streams that swell its volume&nbsp;above the Lake of Constance, the most important affluents to its&nbsp;upper course are the Wutach, the Alb and the Wiese, descending&nbsp;on the right from the Black Forest, and the Aar, draining several&nbsp;Swiss cantons on the left. In the upper Rhenish basin, between</span></p>
