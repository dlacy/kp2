<p><span class="font0">Naseby. Rupert fled to Bristol, whence he counselled the king to come to terms with the parliament. In his conduct of the defence of the town, this “ boldest attaquer in&nbsp;the world for personal courage” showed how much he&nbsp;“ wanted the patience and seasoned head to consult and&nbsp;advise for defence ” (Pepys). His surrender of the town&nbsp;after only a three weeks’ siege, though he had promised&nbsp;Charles to keep it four months, caused his disgrace with&nbsp;the king, who revoked all his commissions by an order&nbsp;dated September 14, and in a cold letter ordered him to&nbsp;seek his subsistence beyond seas, for which purpose a pass&nbsp;was sent him. Rupert, however, broke through the enemy,&nbsp;reached the king at Oxford, and was there reconciled to&nbsp;him. He challenged an investigation of his conduct, and&nbsp;was triumphantly acquitted by the council of war. He&nbsp;appears, too, to have remonstrated personally with Charles&nbsp;in terms of indecent violence. He then applied to the&nbsp;parliament for a pass. This, however, was offered only on&nbsp;unacceptable conditions. On June 24 Rupert was taken&nbsp;prisoner by Fairfax at Oxford, and on July 5, at the&nbsp;demand of the parliament, sailed from Dover for France.&nbsp;He was immediately made a marshal in the French&nbsp;service, with the command of the English there. He&nbsp;received a wound in the head at Armentières during 1647.&nbsp;The greater part of the English fleet having adhered to&nbsp;Charles, and having sailed to Holland, Rupert went with&nbsp;the prince of Wales to The Hague, where the charge of it&nbsp;was put into his hand. He immediately set out in&nbsp;January 1649 upon an expedition of organized piracy.&nbsp;In February, after passing without molestation through&nbsp;the Parliamentary ships, he was at Kinsale, of which he&nbsp;took the fort. He relieved John Grenville at the Scilly&nbsp;Isles, and practically crippled the English trade.&nbsp;Attacked by Blake, he sailed to Portugal, and was received&nbsp;with kindness by the king; Blake, however, blockaded&nbsp;him in the Tagus, and demanded his surrender. Rupert&nbsp;broke through the blockade and sailed to ûhe Mediterranean, landing at Barbary, and refitting at Toulon ; thence&nbsp;he proceeded to Madeira, the Canaries (in 1652), the&nbsp;Azores, Cape de Verd, and the West Indies, sweeping the&nbsp;ocean between the latter places for a considerable time.&nbsp;Finding it impossible, however, to escape the indefatigable&nbsp;pursuit of Blake, he returned to France in 1653. He was&nbsp;now invited to Paris by Louis XIV., who made him master&nbsp;of the horse ; he had also an offer from the emperor to&nbsp;command his forces. He travelled for some while, and&nbsp;was again in Paris in 1655. His movements, however, at&nbsp;this time are very uncertain, but he appears to have&nbsp;devoted his enforced leisure to engraving, chemistry, the&nbsp;perfection of gunpowder, and other arts, especially those&nbsp;of military science. Whether he was the actual discoverer&nbsp;of mezzotinto engraving, in which he was skilful, is uncertain, but this seems probable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the end of September 1660 Rupert returned to England; he was abroad during 1661, was placed on the&nbsp;privy council in April 1662, and in October was one of the&nbsp;commissioners for Tangiers ; in December he became a&nbsp;member of the Royal Society. In August 1664 he was&nbsp;appointed to command the Guinea fleet against the Dutch,&nbsp;and set sail in October. On June 5, 1665, he gained&nbsp;with Monk a great victory over the Dutch, and on his&nbsp;return had his portrait painted by Lely along with the&nbsp;other admirals present at the battle. He again put to&nbsp;sea in May 1666, to hinder the junction of the Dutch and&nbsp;French, and returned in the beginning of June after a&nbsp;heavy defeat, his ship having stuck on the Galloper Sands&nbsp;during the fight. He was obliged to justify himself&nbsp;before the council. In January 1667 he was very ill, but&nbsp;recovered after the operation of trepanning. At this time&nbsp;he is mentioned as one of the best tennis players in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">nation. On October 22, 1667, he received with Monk the thanks of the House of Commons for his exertions&nbsp;against the Dutch at Chatham, and he was again at&nbsp;sea iu April 1668. He was always staunch in his Protestant principles, and was carefully kept in ignorance of&nbsp;Charles’s Catholic plot in 1670. In August of that year&nbsp;he was constable of Windsor, and busied himself with the&nbsp;fitting up of the Round Tower, a turret of which he&nbsp;converted into a workshop. He shared in the prevailing immorality of the time, his favourite mistress being&nbsp;the celebrated actress, Mrs Hughes. In 1673 he was&nbsp;appointed lord high admiral, and fought two battles with&nbsp;the Dutch Fleet on May 28 and August 11, but could do&nbsp;little through the backwardness of the French in coming&nbsp;to his assistance. This appears to have so annoyed him&nbsp;that he henceforward eagerly helped the anti-French party.&nbsp;He was an active member of the Board of Trade, and&nbsp;governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company. Till his death,&nbsp;on November 29, 1682, he lived in complete retirement at&nbsp;Windsor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(o. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUSH. Under the name of rush or rushes, the stalks or fistular stem like leaves of several plants have minor&nbsp;industrial applications. The common rushes (species of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jutixus)</span><span class="font0"> are used in many parts of the world for chair-bottoms, mats, and basket work, and the pith they&nbsp;contain serves as wicks in open oil-lamps and for tallow-candles,—whence rushlight. The bulrush, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typha elephan-tiηa,</span><span class="font0"> is used in Sindh for mats and baskets. Under the&nbsp;name of rushes, species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scirpus</span><span class="font0"> and other </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gyperaceæ</span><span class="font0"> are&nbsp;used for chair-bottoms, mats, and thatch. The elegant&nbsp;rush mats of Madras are made from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Papyrus pαngorei.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The sweet rush, yielding essential oil, is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andropogon&nbsp;Scluxnanthux,</span><span class="font0"> known also as lemon grass. Large quantities&nbsp;of the “horse tail,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eguisetum hiemαle,</span><span class="font0"> are used under the&nbsp;name of the Dutch or scouring rush, for scouring metal&nbsp;and other hard surfaces on account of the large proportion&nbsp;of silica the plant contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSH, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Benjamin</span><span class="font0"> (1745-1813), the Sydenham of America, was born near Bristol (12 miles from Philadelphia), on a homestead founded by his grandfather,&nbsp;who had followed Penn from England in 1683, being of&nbsp;the Quaker persuasion, and a gunsmith by trade. After&nbsp;a careful education at school and college, and an apprenticeship of six years with a doctor in Philadelphia, Rush&nbsp;went for two years to Edinburgh, where he attached&nbsp;himself chiefly to Cullen. He took his M.D. degree&nbsp;there in 1768, spent a year more in the hospitals of&nbsp;London and Paris, and began practice in Philadelphia at&nbsp;the age of twenty-four, undertaking at the same time&nbsp;the chemistry class at the new medical school. He at&nbsp;once became a leading spirit in the political and social&nbsp;movements of the day. He was a friend of Franklin’s,&nbsp;a member of Congress for the State of Pennsylvania in&nbsp;1776, and one of those who signed the Declaration of&nbsp;Independence the same year. He had already written on&nbsp;the Test Laws, “Sermons to the Rich,” and on Negro&nbsp;Slavery, having taken up the last-named subject at the&nbsp;instance of Anthony Benezet, whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Account of&nbsp;Guinea</span><span class="font0"> was the inspiration of Clarkson’s celebrated college&nbsp;essay twelve years after. In 1774 he started along with&nbsp;James Pemberton the first anti-slavery society in America,&nbsp;and was its secretary for many years. When the political&nbsp;crisis ended in 1787 with the convention for drawing up&nbsp;a federal constitution, of which he was a member, he&nbsp;retired from public life, and gave himself up wholly to&nbsp;medical practice. In 1789 he exchanged his chemistry&nbsp;lectureship for that of the theory and practice of physic ;</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
