The vendor was bound to support the purchaser in any action by&nbsp;a third party disputing his right, and to repay him the price twofold&nbsp;in the event of that third party’s success; and he was bound,&nbsp;moreover, to make good to him any loss he had sustained through&nbsp;a deficiency of acreage he had guaranteed, non-existence of servitudes he had declared the lands enjoyed, existence of others from&nbsp;which he had. stated they were free,<sup>@@1</sup> incapability of a slave for&nbsp;labour for which he was vouched fit, and so on. But breaches of&nbsp;these obligations were probably all regarded as of a delictual character; the obligations were binding, not in virtue of the sale </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per se,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">but of the transaction </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram</span><span class="font1"> superinduced upon it; and, if&nbsp;the vendor had at any time to return the price on failure to manci-pate what he had sold, it was not because he had committed a breach&nbsp;of contract, but because he had unjustly enriched himself at the&nbsp;purchaser’s expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In sales of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> just as in those of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> a vendor who had been incautious enough to deliver his wares before he had&nbsp;been paid, or had got stipulatory security for the price, or had&nbsp;converted it into a book-debt, might recover them bv a real action&nbsp;if payment was unduly delayed; while the purchaser who had paid&nbsp;in advance but failed to get delivery might also get back his money&nbsp;from the. vendor on the pica of unwarrantable enrichment. But,&nbsp;as mancipation was, as is generally supposed, incompetent for&nbsp;carrying the property, some other machinery had to be resorted to&nbsp;than that of the copper and the scales for imposing upon the vendor&nbsp;an obligation of warranty against eviction, defects and so forth.&nbsp;What it was is a question much controverted among modern writers.&nbsp;It may be that, until trade began to assume considerable proportions, and when a transaction was between citizens, a purchaser&nbsp;was content to rely partly on the honesty of his vendor, partly on&nbsp;the latter’s knowledge that he ran the risk of an action for theft if&nbsp;what he sold belonged to another,<sup>@@2</sup> and partly on the maxim common&nbsp;in all ages and climes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">caveat emptor.</span><span class="font1"> When it was one between a&nbsp;citizen and a peregrin, a different set of rules of course came into&nbsp;operation; for between them disputes were settled by actions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;factum</span><span class="font1"> before recuperators, whose decisions were arrived at very&nbsp;much on considerations of natural equity. On the whole, while&nbsp;admitting it to be quite maintainable that the urban praetors, under&nbsp;the influence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium,</span><span class="font1"> granted </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arbitria</span><span class="font1"> for enforcing obligations&nbsp;of parties in sales </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter cives</span><span class="font1"> even a good while prior to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex&nbsp;Aebutia,</span><span class="font1"> the balance of evidence, we think, is in favour of the view&nbsp;that it was the popularization of the stipulation that facilitated the&nbsp;development of sale into a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonaefidei</span><span class="font1"> contract.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Varro, in a collection of styles of sales of sheep, cattle, &amp;c., some of which he says were abridgments of those of M. Manilius, who was&nbsp;consul in the year 149 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> It was the guarantee of the vendor of&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> or even occasionally of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font1"> sold without&nbsp;mancipation, that the purchaser should be maintained in possession&nbsp;of what he had bought; it entitled him to reparation on eviction,&nbsp;measured not by any fixed standard but according to the loss he had&nbsp;'sustained. It cannot have been introduced, therefore, until after&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Aebutia</span><span class="font1"> and the formulation by the praetor of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio&nbsp;ex stipulate.</span><span class="font1"> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stipulatio duplae</span><span class="font1"> was one binding the vendor for&nbsp;double the price in case of eviction, and was entered into not only&nbsp;where no mancipation of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font1"> took place or one which&nbsp;might be challengeable for invalidity, but also where valuable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res&nbsp;nec mancipi</span><span class="font1"> were sold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The idea of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stipulatio duplae</span><span class="font1"> may have been borrowed from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">duplum</span><span class="font1"> incurred by a vendor on the eviction of a purchaser acquiring&nbsp;a thing by mancipation; for one of its earliest manifestations was&nbsp;in the edict of the curulc aediles, who insisted on it from persons&nbsp;selling slaves, probably because the dealers were for the most part&nbsp;foreigners, and therefore unable to complete their sales </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et&nbsp;libram.'</span><span class="font1"> Judging from Varro, it was a form of stipulation against&nbsp;eviction that in his time was used only in sales of slaves, although&nbsp;he adds that by agreement of parties it might be limited to a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">simplum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There were also stipulations against vices in the object sold. We learn from Varro—wnat is also indicated in various passages of&nbsp;Plautus—that the vendor at the same time and in the body of the&nbsp;same </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stipulatio duplae</span><span class="font1"> guaranteed that the sheep or cattle he was&nbsp;selling were healthy and of a healthy stock and free from faults,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">and that the latter had not done any mischief for which their owner could be held liable in a noxal action; and similarly that&nbsp;a slave sold was healthy and not chargeable for any theft or other&nbsp;offence for which the purchaser might have to answer. If any of&nbsp;these guarantees turned out fallacious, the purchaser had an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio&nbsp;ex stipulate</span><span class="font1"> against the vendor: &quot; Whereas the plaintiff got from&nbsp;the defendant a stipulation that certain sheep he bought from him&nbsp;were healthy, &amp;e. [repeating the words of guarantee], and that he,&nbsp;the plaintiff, should be free to hold them </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(habere licere),</span><span class="font1"> whatever it&nbsp;shall appear that the defendant ought in respect thereof to give to&nbsp;or do for the plaintiff, in the value thereof, judge, condemn him;&nbsp;otherwise, acquit him.” It is an observation of Bekker’s<sup>@@4 </sup>that&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio empti</span><span class="font1"> in its original shape was just a simplification of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio ex stimulate</span><span class="font1"> on a vendor's guarantees;&nbsp;the stipulations to which we have been alluding had become&nbsp;such unfailing accompaniments of a sale as to be matters&nbsp;of legal presumption, the result being that the words &quot;whereas this&nbsp;plaintiff </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bought</span><span class="font1"> from the defendant the sheep about which the&nbsp;action has arisen ” were substituted in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">demonstratio</span><span class="font1"> (as the&nbsp;introductory clause of the formula was called) for the detailed recital&nbsp;of what had been stipulated. Bekker justifies this by reference to&nbsp;the language of Varro, who seems to include under the words </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emptio,&nbsp;venditio</span><span class="font1"> not merely the agreement to buy and sell but also the&nbsp;stipulations that usually went with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The introduction of an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio empti</span><span class="font1"> in this shape, however, was far from the recognition of sale as a purely consensual contract.&nbsp;If the price was not paid at once, the purchaser gave his stipulatory&nbsp;promise for it, or got some one on whom the vendor placed more&nbsp;reliance to do so for him, or else the vendor made a booK-debt of it;&nbsp;and, if it had to be sued for, it was in all these cases by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">condiclio&nbsp;certae pecuniae</span><span class="font1"> and not by an action on the sale. If the price was&nbsp;paid but the thing purchased not delivered, the only remedy open&nbsp;to the purchaser was to get back his money by the same condict ion,&nbsp;unless, indeed, the guarantee </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">habere licere</span><span class="font1"> was held to cover delivery,&nbsp;in which case the purchaser might obtain damages in an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio&nbsp;ex stipulate</span><span class="font1"> under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio empti.</span><span class="font1"> But this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio empti,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">whether raised on the ground of non-delivery, eviction or breach of&nbsp;some other warranty, was really an action on the verbal contracts&nbsp;ihat had accompanied the sale—a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">strictum jus</span><span class="font1"> action in which the&nbsp;judge could not travel beyond the letter of the engagements of the&nbsp;purchaser. In the latter years of the Republic, and probably a&nbsp;little before the time of Q. Mucius Scaevola, it was a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidei&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">action. How had the change come about? A single case of hardship may have been sufficient to induce it, such as the defeat of a&nbsp;claim for damages for eviction on the ground that the stipulatory&nbsp;guarantee had been accidentally overlooked. Ulpian says: “As the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stipulatio duplae</span><span class="font1"> is a thing of universal observance, action on the&nbsp;ground of eviction will lie </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex empto</span><span class="font1"> if perchance the vendor of a&nbsp;slave have failed to give his stipulatory guarantee, for everything&nbsp;that is of general custom and practice ought to be in view of the&nbsp;judge in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidei judicium. <sup>@@5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Very little was required to convert the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stricti juris actio empti, </span><span class="font1">really nothing more than an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio ex stipulate,</span><span class="font1"> into a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidei&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">one—simply the addition by the praetor of the words “ on considerations of good faith ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ex fiae bona)</span><span class="font1"> to the “ whatever the&nbsp;defendant ought to give to or do for the plaintiff.” The effect,&nbsp;however, was immeasurable—not that it did away with the practice&nbsp;of stipulatory guarantees, for Varro wrote after the time of Q.&nbsp;Mucius (who speaks of the action on sale as a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidei</span><span class="font1"> one), and&nbsp;references to them are abundant in the pages of the classical jurists;&nbsp;but it rendered them in law unnecessary’. It made sale a purely&nbsp;consensual contract in which, in virtue of the simple agreement to&nbsp;buy and sell, all the obligations on either side that usually attended&nbsp;it were held embodied without express formulation or (still less)&nbsp;stipulatory or literal engagement. And, in instructing the judges&nbsp;to decide in every case between buyer and seller suing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex empto</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex vendito</span><span class="font1"> on principles of good faith, it really empowered them to&nbsp;go far beyond “ general custom and practice,” and to take cognisance&nbsp;of everything that in fairness and equity and common sense ou^ht&nbsp;to influence their judgment, so as to enable them freely to do justice&nbsp;between the parties in any and every question that might directly&nbsp;or indirectly arise out of their relation as seller and buyer.<sup>@@6</sup></span></p>
