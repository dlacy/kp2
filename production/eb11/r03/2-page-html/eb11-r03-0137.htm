<p><span class="font1">hood had gone out of use by the end of the 16th century.@@<sup>1 </sup>Bachelors’ hoods were to be lined throughout with fur </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Mun.&nbsp;Acad.</span><span class="font1"> p. 361), which we learn from the statute </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de admissione ad&nbsp;pelluram</span><span class="font1"> (1432) to have been budge. Masters and noblemen&nbsp;might use miniver, or silk in summer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Mun. Acad.</span><span class="font1"> pp. 283, 301).&nbsp;There were evidently hoods of at least two kinds for masters,&nbsp;sometimes called respectively </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">caputium</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">epomis,</span><span class="font1"> whether&nbsp;corresponding to the distinction between regents and nonregents we do not know. (See </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mun. Acad.</span><span class="font1"> p. 638, will of&nbsp;Thomas Bray, M.A., and Robinson, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">loc. cit.</span><span class="font1"> In the Oxford&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Statulorurn</span><span class="font1"> of 1768 the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">epomis</span><span class="font1"> is worn with the ordinary&nbsp;gown, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Capntiiim</span><span class="font1"> with the scarlet habit.) At a later date,&nbsp;at Cambridge, a distinction was made between the hoods of&nbsp;non-regents, which were lined with silk, and those of regents,&nbsp;which were lined with miniver.@@<sup>2</sup> Later again the regents wore&nbsp;their hoods in such a way as to show the white lining, while&nbsp;the non-regents wore theirs“ squared,” so that the white did not&nbsp;show. Hence the name “ White Hoods ” and “ Black Hoods ”&nbsp;given to the upper and lower houses of the old Senate respectively. It is not settled when the modern colourings of hoods&nbsp;arose; they probably followed those of·the gowns of the&nbsp;faculties, but about these we are equally uncertain. The&nbsp;Oxford Proctor still wears a miniver hood. The modern&nbsp;Cambridge hood has preserved .the original shape more closely&nbsp;than the Oxford one, being a hood and tippet combined, the&nbsp;hood having square corners. The tippet, which appears as&nbsp;part of the early costume of certain doctors, was probably,&nbsp;like the judges’ tippet, originally the shoulder-cape forming&nbsp;part of the same garment as the hood. Clark and others&nbsp;would derive it from the almuce (ç.v.), but do not seem to&nbsp;show any definite grounds for so doing. Its place seems to&nbsp;have been taken by the scarf worn by D.D.’s, &amp;c., probably&nbsp;developed from the hood with long Hripipe as worn turban-wise on the head or as a scarf round the shoulders. It seems&nbsp;rather ar-fetched to derive the scarf from the two pendants&nbsp;of the almuce.@@<sup>3</sup> (See article </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vestments</span><span class="font1"> and cp. the mayor’s&nbsp;scarf mentioned above.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There seem to have been at least three varieties of academic head-dress:@@<sup>4</sup> firstly, the doctor’s skull-cap with “ apex ” as illustrated&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chandler MS.</span><span class="font1"> drawings; secondly, the square cap of cloth&nbsp;as prescribed by Laud’s statutes of 1636 for graduates and foundation scholars (similarly for Cambridge by Burleigh’s letter to the&nbsp;vice-chancellor in 1588), with its counterpart of velvet worn by&nbsp;doctors; thirdly, a round cloth cap prescribed by the Laudian&nbsp;statutes and Burleigh’s letter for undergraduates who were not&nbsp;foundation scholars, with the round cap of velvet for doctors which&nbsp;survives as part of their full dress to the present day. The square&nbsp;cap was adopted at the universities, according to Robinson, after&nbsp;1520, in imitation of the university of Paris. For the development&nbsp;of Jhe modern “ college cap,” see Biretta. In this connexion&nbsp;should be mentioned the term “ tuft-hunting,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> attempting to&nbsp;thrust oneself into the society of one’s social superiors, derived from&nbsp;the gold tufts or tassel worn by noblemen and fellow-commoners&nbsp;on their college caps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As to the dresses of the different degrees, the drawings from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chandler MS.</span><span class="font1"> give a good idea of the early costume. It is also</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">well illustrated by brasses.@@5 Doctors of theology seem to have w’orn a tippet but no hood. Masters of Arts seem to have worn a gowm,&nbsp;over which was a garment with bell-shaped sleeves reaching to the&nbsp;elbow, a tippet and a hood (see Druitt, plate facing p. 136, and p. 135).&nbsp;The same dress was sometimes worn by B.A.’s (see brass </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">John&nbsp;Palmer, B.A., d. 1479, New College, Oxford, in Druitt, p. 141), and&nbsp;bachelors of law and divinity, the latter being generally already&nbsp;M.A.’s (Druitt, p. 139). Haines’s theory is that alter the middle of&nbsp;the 15th century the dress of the M.A.’a was changed, and they&nbsp;wore a sleeveless tabard reaching to midway bctw'een ankle and&nbsp;knee. This costume certainly occurs on brasses, chiefly of the&nbsp;16th or late 15th centuries, but the change is hard to explain.@@6·</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Academic dress underwent much inquiry and some revision at the time of the Reformation, chiefly in the direction </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">sobriety and uniformity, “ excess of apparel ” being repressed&nbsp;as severely as ever, but not with much more effect.@@<sup>7</sup> Burleigh’s&nbsp;letter to the Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University (1585),&nbsp;and the statutes of Queen Elizabeth, strictly enforce the&nbsp;wearing of cap and gown by all, and hoods and habits by&nbsp;those entitled to wear them, and similar regulations were&nbsp;made for Oxford by Laud’s statutes of 1633, further details&nbsp;being dealt with by a decree of 1770. Academic dress during&nbsp;the 17th century may be further studied in Bedcl Buck’s&nbsp;book (1665, see Appendix B. to Peacock, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Observations on the&nbsp;Statutes of the .University of Cambridge},</span><span class="font1"> and Loggan’s plates&nbsp;of academic costume in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oxonia Illustrata</span><span class="font1"> (1675) <sup>an</sup>^ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cantabrigia&nbsp;Illustrata</span><span class="font1"> (1690, ed. J. W. Clark, 1905).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There have been few far-reaching changes since Loggan’s day. Cambridge has of late years inquired into and revised&nbsp;her regulations as to dress, and in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ordinances</span><span class="font1"> (latest ed.&nbsp;1908, Statute A, cap.

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@l</sup>An interesting survival, which only disappeared about the middle of the 19th century, was the little black hood placed round&nbsp;the neck of candidates going in for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">viva voce</span><span class="font1"> in all examinations&nbsp;subsequent to responsions at Oxford. This was a survival of the&nbsp;custom of conferring on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sophistae generales, i.e.</span><span class="font1"> those who had passed&nbsp;the first stage of the exercises for the B.Ä. degree, a hood of plain&nbsp;black cloth.

On the brass of John Lowlhe, D.C.L., should be&nbsp;noticed the two curious long streamers or Iiripipes hanging from&nbsp;the back of his tabard or hood, lt is hard to say w’hat they can&nbsp;be; but the closest parallel is in the two streamers on the back of&nbsp;the old Oxford commoners’ gown, which were probably survivals&nbsp;of sleeves.

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@6</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is just possible that this sleeved garment may be the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capa&nbsp;manicata</span><span class="font1"> mentioned in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mun.

Braun, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Liturgische Gewandung,</span><span class="font1"> p. 308, shows that a sleeved cope, called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cappa 'manicata,</span><span class="font1"> did&nbsp;develop from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cappa Clericalis</span><span class="font1"> or everyday cope of the clergy,&nbsp;at the end of the 12th century, its use being forbidden by various&nbsp;synods. It is possible, then, that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capa manicata</span><span class="font1"> may have&nbsp;been w<sup>r</sup>orn by non-regents, the tabard (which Haines alleges to&nbsp;have been adopted generally by M.A.’s in the late 15th century),&nbsp;or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pallium,</span><span class="font1"> by regents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@7</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential parts of Laud’s statutes, Burleigh’s letter, &amp;c.,&nbsp;with much other matter bearing on academic costume from the&nbsp;16th century onwards, will be found in C.
