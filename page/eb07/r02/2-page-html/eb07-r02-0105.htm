<p><span class="font0">however humble or disagreeable may be the department from which they are drawn. His best novel is usually considered to be the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paysan Perverti,</span><span class="font0"> which appeared inl776∙</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two writers may be pointed out, however, about this period, who were the representatives, if not of better taste, at least of better feelings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bernardin de St. Pierre (1737—1814) may be regarded as the connecting linkbetween the eighteenth and the nineteenth century : a graft of Fenelon upon Rousseau. His&nbsp;pathos no doubt often merges in a weakly sentimentalism ;&nbsp;but the calm idyllic beauty of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paul and Virginia</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Indian Cottage</span><span class="font0"> (1789—1792) was not without its use&nbsp;in restoring to French literature a feeling for nature and&nbsp;its simple enjoyments, and the acknowledgment of a Providence, a belief which both philosophy and fiction had for&nbsp;some time past been labouring to obliterate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The defects of St. Pierre, with very little of his redeeming excellencies, appear in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Atala, Rene,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Natchez</span><span class="font0"> of Chateaubriand. He is, no doubt, in some departments an original thinker, and a man of a poetical imagination, though&nbsp;a degree of vagueness and mysticism mingles even with the&nbsp;best of his works ; but as a novelist, his sickly sentiment and&nbsp;exaggeration of feeling are fatal to his success.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the limbo of the Revolution, after its billowy heaving, began to settle again into something like a calm, under the&nbsp;despotism of the Consulate, the novel took the direction of&nbsp;broad and extravagant humour, derived from the gaieties and&nbsp;vulgaritiesof middle life,and,as might naturally be expected,&nbsp;liberally sprinkled with indecency, in the voluminous novels&nbsp;of Pigault Le Brun,—to whom it w*ould be unfair to deny&nbsp;considerable powers of broad mirth, and a fertility in imaginary burlesque situations, which remind us of Smollett. But&nbsp;the questionable character of the novel-writing of this&nbsp;period is not universal. In the tales of Madame Cottin,&nbsp;the authoress of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Elizabeth</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mathilde,</span><span class="font0"> a pure morality,&nbsp;and feminine tenderness, reappear ; and though those of&nbsp;Madame de Staël, with all their eloquence, occasionally inculcate more doubtful lessons, her genuine admiration for&nbsp;pure and elevated feeling, prevents her from willingly lending her talents to the palliation of vice. The novels of&nbsp;Madame de Staël, however, are far more German in their&nbsp;character than French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The works of the literary veteran, Nodier, certainly owe their attractions more to the charms of a beautiful style than&nbsp;to theirsubstance. Throughout his whole course he has been&nbsp;but an imitator, putting on successively the manner of other&nbsp;writers. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Werther</span><span class="font0"> of’Goethe appears to have first given&nbsp;the tone to his novels, and the passionate energy and wild&nbsp;complaints of the German suicide were reproduced in his tale&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Therese Aubert.</span><span class="font0"> To the influence of Goethe succeeded&nbsp;that of Byron, and the spirit of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Corsair</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lara</span><span class="font0"> were&nbsp;infused into the Bandit.∕cαra</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sbogαr.</span><span class="font0"> From Byron he passed&nbsp;to Scott, whom he has imitated in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trilby, ou lelutiη d<sup>,</sup>Ar-gail,</span><span class="font0"> a production, the effect of which, though meant to be&nbsp;serious and pathetic, is unintentionally of the most comic&nbsp;kind, for the “ tricksy spirit” of Argyle in the hands of Nodier&nbsp;becomes one of the most absurd of supernatural conceptions.&nbsp;In his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Smarra</span><span class="font0"> again, a Thessalian story in the manner of&nbsp;the sorceries and diableries in the Golden Ass of Apuleius,&nbsp;he seems to have been influenced by the German night&nbsp;pieces of the school of Hoffmann ; and he certainly succeeds almost as well as his German master, in producing a&nbsp;strange ephialtic effect by a cloud of misty murky phantoms, which pass before us as if in a feverish and uneasy&nbsp;dream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the restoration of the Bourbons, some degree of external decency, at least, distinguished the productions of&nbsp;the French press, though still the license which its novelists permitted to themselves in their comic works, and the&nbsp;extravagant and terrible cast of their more tragic stories,&nbsp;indicated at once a looseness of morality, and a coarseness&nbsp;of taste, which might, in some measure, have prepared the&nbsp;world for that strange and revolting spectacle which the&nbsp;literature of fiction has presented in France, since the Revolution of 1830. The manner of Pigault le Brun, was&nbsp;imitated and improved upon by Paul de Koch ; for, adopting his principle of drawing chiefly from middle life, and&nbsp;his love for the representation of comic mischances, he has&nbsp;thrown into the best of his novels, scenes of simple humour,&nbsp;of tenderness, and even of powerful passion, to which the&nbsp;novelist of the Revolution had made no pretensions. To&nbsp;sneer at him as a Parisian cockney, or as the romance writer&nbsp;of the Grisettes, is easy; but we are much mistaken if his&nbsp;tales, homely and even coarse as they may be, will not be&nbsp;read when the atrocities of Sue and Masson, and the delicate depravities of Balzac, are forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the higher sphere of romance, we have, during the same period, the earlier productions of Victor Hugo, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hans&nbsp;of Iceland,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bug Jargal. Hans of Iceland,</span><span class="font0"> wild and&nbsp;extravagant as it is, is evidently not the work of an ordinary&nbsp;writer. A stern, savage northern spirit is breathed into&nbsp;the romance. Spiagudry, Orugix, even the monster from&nbsp;whom the tale derives its name, strange and ghastly creations as they are, exercise a certain fascination over the&nbsp;mind ; and the youthful poet has turned to great account&nbsp;the dreary wilds, gloomy lakes, stormy seas, and ruined&nbsp;fortresses of Scandinavia. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bug Jargal</span><span class="font0"> was decidedly inferior to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hans of Iceland.</span><span class="font0"> The essential improbability in&nbsp;the character of a negro passionately in love with a white&nbsp;woman, and yet tempering the wildest passion with the&nbsp;deepest respect, is obvious ; nor is that improbability disguised by the art with which Hugo has framed his story.&nbsp;There was more of genius, we think, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dernier Jour&nbsp;d’un Condamné,</span><span class="font0"> in which Hugo, like Sterne, has taken a&nbsp;single captive, shut him up in his dungeon, and then&nbsp;“ looked through the twilight of the grated door to take&nbsp;his picture.” In this little work he has shown how a profound interest might be given to a mere register of sensations, and a dramatic movement imparted to a monologue,&nbsp;in which the scene shifts only from the Bicètre to the Conciergerie, the Hotel de Ville, and the Place de Grève.&nbsp;Hugo’s great novel, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Notre Dame de Paris,</span><span class="font0"> appeared in&nbsp;1831. It is needless to speak of a work which has been&nbsp;more than once translated into English; and the characteristics of which, the mingled genius and extravagance,&nbsp;the poetical spirit in which it is conceived, and the want of&nbsp;nature in the characters which it pourtrays, resembling&nbsp;distorted and hideous masques rather than men, are now&nbsp;very generally and correctly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The popularity of the romances of Scott led about the same time to a multitude of imitations, by Jacob and others,&nbsp;of which the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cinq Mars</span><span class="font0"> of Alfred de Vigny appears to be&nbsp;generally considered the most successful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have no idea of entering on that mass of revolting performances, equally offensive to good morals and good&nbsp;taste, with which the French press has teemed since 1830;&nbsp;and which we are but too happy to consider, with the French&nbsp;themselves, as a literature of transition. This school of&nbsp;blood and voluptuousness, funereal horrors and drunken orgies, the transitions in which remind one of the stage arrangement in the Rehearsal,—“ the coffin opens, and a banquet is discovered,”—we feel assured, can be of no long&nbsp;duration ; and already we believe, that the French public&nbsp;begin to feel that they have had enough of the endless&nbsp;Balzac, and Janin, and Sue, and Soulie, and Masson, and&nbsp;the other labourers in this Montfaucon of fiction. As for&nbsp;Madame du Devant, or George Sand,—the Chevalier d’Eon&nbsp;of French literature,—a being whose sex it would be impossible to ascertain from her works, with the warm passions and headlong eloquence of the woman, and the&nbsp;audacious speculation of the man ;—while the principles&nbsp;which she labours to inculcate, are of the most odious na-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
