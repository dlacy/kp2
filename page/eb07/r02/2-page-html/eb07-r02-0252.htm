<p><span class="font2">58. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is not necessary that tlle progressive motion of&nbsp;the centre of gravity be in a straight line, this formula enables us to determine the distances from the centre at which&nbsp;the planets may have received the single impulses which&nbsp;gave them at the same time their motions of revolution in&nbsp;their orbits, and of rotation round their axes. Thus, taking&nbsp;the case of the earth, and making R = the radius of its orbit, the circumference of the orbit is 2wR, and the part of&nbsp;this which is described by the centre of gravity, while tlle</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">59. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The direction of the force being PA (fig. 12), if a point&nbsp;be taken in the line AG between A and G, the motion of the&nbsp;point arising from the rotation of the body about the axis is&nbsp;in the first instant of time parallel to the direction of the progressive motion, and if </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font2"> be its distance from G, the velocity&nbsp;due to both motions will be V + </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rw.</span><span class="font2"> But if the point be&nbsp;taken on the other side of G, the direction of the rotatory&nbsp;motion will be opposite to that of the progressive motion,&nbsp;and the velocity of the point will be V — </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rw.</span><span class="font2"> If therefore&nbsp;the point T be taken such that making GT = </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r,</span><span class="font2"> we have&nbsp;the equation V </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">— rw;</span><span class="font2"> then, for a single instant, every point&nbsp;in the straight line passing through T perpendicular to&nbsp;HKL is at rest, or is carried as far back by the rotatory&nbsp;motion in the first instant of time, as it is carried forward&nbsp;by the progressive motion ; and, for a single instant, the&nbsp;double motion of the body may be regarded as a simple rotatory motion about that straight line. This point T is&nbsp;called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">centre of spontaneous rotation,</span><span class="font2"> and the straight&nbsp;line passing through T, perpendicular to tlle plane HKL,&nbsp;is called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">axis of spontaneous ιotαtion∙</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">60. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preceding formulæ enable us to determine completely the two motions of translation and rotation when a&nbsp;’force is applied to a single point of the free body ; we have&nbsp;now to determine what the effect will be when any number of forces given in magnitude and direction are applied&nbsp;to different points of the body ; and as it appears from what&nbsp;precedes, that during the first instant the two motions take&nbsp;place independently of each other, we shall first give the&nbsp;equations which fix the position of the centre of gravity of&nbsp;the moving body, and then those which define the rotatory&nbsp;motion, or determine the position of any point of the body&nbsp;with reference to its centre of gravity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let G be the centre of gravity of the body, M its mass, and let the motion be referred to three rectangular axes&nbsp;OX, OY, OZ. Let us now suppose forces given in magnitude and direction to be applied at the points A, A', A&quot;, &amp;c.&nbsp;of the body, and that each of them is resolved into three&nbsp;others respectively parallel to the directions of the axis, and&nbsp;let </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p, q, r,</span><span class="font2"> be the resolved forces applied at A ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">j∕, cf, r<sup>,</sup>,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the resolved forces applied at A', and so on ; also let P </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">—p&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">+ ∕ + ∕∕' +, &amp;c., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Q. = q + &lt;f</span><span class="font2"> + r∕'+, &amp;c., R = </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font2"> + r'&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">+ r’</span><span class="font2"> +, &amp;c. ; then, since the moving force is equal to the&nbsp;product of the mass into the velocity, and since by (56) the&nbsp;progressive motion resulting from the force applied at A is&nbsp;the same as if it had been applied to the centre of gravity,&nbsp;the velocity of the centre of gravity from the joint action&nbsp;of all the forces, in the directions OX, OY, OZ, will be re-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">diagonal of the parallelopiped of which these component velocities are the sides ; therefore, denoting it by V, we have</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h6><span class="font3">v = ⅛√(P<sup>t</sup>+Q<sup>s</sup> + R<sup>2</sup>)∙</span></h6>

<p><span class="font2">the angles which its direction makes with the axis </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x, y, z; </span><span class="font2">then, since the forces P, Q, R meet in a point (the centre&nbsp;of gravity), we have</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">cos.α = <sub>i3v</sub>,cos.∕3 = <sub>s</sub>j<sub>v</sub>, cos.<sub>r</sub>=<sub>j</sub>^<sub>v</sub>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These equations give the direction of the velocity ; hence, since V has already been found, the initial velocity of the&nbsp;centre of gravity and its direction are both completely determined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">61. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the forces applied to the body are simply percussions, which cease to act after the first impact, and there&nbsp;is no resistance, no change will take place in the velocity&nbsp;or its direction during the second and succeeding instants,&nbsp;and the centre of gravity will describe a straight line with&nbsp;a uniform motion ; but if the forces continue to act after&nbsp;the motion has commenced, we must have recourse to the&nbsp;formulæ given by the principles of dynamics, which express&nbsp;the varied motion of a body subjected to the action of accelerating forces. At the end of the time </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t,</span><span class="font2"> reckoned from&nbsp;the commencement of the motion, let </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x, y, z</span><span class="font2"> be the co-ordinates of the element of the body </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dm,</span><span class="font2"> referred to the&nbsp;rectangular axes OX, OY, OZ ; then the velocity at that&nbsp;instant being expressed by the differential of the space described divided hy the element of the time, the components</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of the velocity at the same instant will be ⅛ ⅞ ⅜. Now </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>j</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dt dt dt</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the forces acting on the body, whatever be their nature, may always be decomposed into others parallel to the three&nbsp;axes ; suppose therefore P, Q, R to be the components of&nbsp;the accelerating forces in those directions acting on the&nbsp;point </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dm,</span><span class="font2"> then the increment of velocity being equal to&nbsp;tile force into the element of the time, if the particle </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dm&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">were entirely free, the velocities ^∙,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⅛ would acquire</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the increments </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pdt, Qdt,</span><span class="font2"> RΛ in the instant </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dt.</span><span class="font2"> But the increments of velocity actually acquired in the instant </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dt</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">are the differentials of the velocities, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d ∙ d∙ d ∙</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Multiplying each of these expressions by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dm,</span><span class="font2"> we get tlle quantities of motion due to the respective velocities. Now,&nbsp;according to a well-known principle of dynamics, the discovery of which is due to D’Alembert, the infinitely small&nbsp;quantities of motion lost in every instant by all the particles&nbsp;in consequence of their mutual connection must make equilibrium ; the integrals of the preceding expressions multiplied by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dm</span><span class="font2"> must therefore be severally equal to zero, and&nbsp;we have accordingly (on effecting the operations indicated,&nbsp;and dividing by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dt)</span><span class="font2"> the three equations</span></p>
