The abbé Girard publiſhed one on the ſynonymous terms of the French language many years ago. Another was publiſhed on the ſame ſubject in the year 1785 by the abbé Roubaud. An account of the Engliſh ſynonyma was publiſhed by an anonymous author in 1766 ; which is a cloſe imitation, and in ſome parts a literal tranſlation, of the abbé Girard's <hi rend="italic">Synonymes François.</hi> We recollect, too, of seeing ſome eſſays of Mrs Piozzi on the ſame ſubject.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
