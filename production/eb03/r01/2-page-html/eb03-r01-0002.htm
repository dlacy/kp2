<p><span class="font0">there is nothing that </span><span class="font1">ſeems to comma .fi </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">if</span><span class="font0"> but a ſmall </span><span class="font1">hill at ſome diſtance, which is undermined and may be&nbsp;blown up. It -was taken by Amurath ill. with the&nbsp;loſs of </span><span class="font0">20,000 </span><span class="font1">men ; but was ſurpriſed ſoon aſter by&nbsp;Count Palfi, who killed all the Turks that were found&nbsp;therein. It is ſeated at the confluence of the rivers&nbsp;Rab and Rabnitz, not far from the Danube, 32 miles&nbsp;weſt of Gran, and 55 ſouth-eaſt of vienna. E. Long.&nbsp;17. 25. N. Lat. 47. 48,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAB AC, a ſmall port on the Arabian coaſt of the Red Sea, in N. Lat. 22<sup>0</sup> 35' 40'' by Mr Bruce’s ac-¢ount. The entry to the harbour is from the E. N. E.&nbsp;and is about a quarter of a mile broad. The port extends about two miles in length to thc eaſtward. The&nbsp;mountains are about three leagues to the north, and the&nbsp;town about four miles north by eaſt from the entrance&nbsp;to the harbour. The water is gcod, and all ſhips may&nbsp;be ſupplied here from the wells which are in the neigh-bourhood of the town. The country is bare and un-¢ultivated ; but from the appearance of it, and the&nbsp;freſhneſs of the water, Mr Bruce ſuppoſes that it fome-times rains among the mountains here, which is the&nbsp;more probable as it is conſiderably within the tropic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABAT, a large and handfome ſea-port town of Africa, in the kingdom of Fez and province of Tremε-fen. It has fine mofques and handſome palaces, and is&nbsp;ſeated at the mouth of the river Burrigrig, almoſt in the&nbsp;mid-way between Fez and Tangier. W. Long. 5. 28.&nbsp;N. Lat. 34. 40.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rabat, together with SaHee, which is oppoſite to it, was formerly famous for fitting out piratical veſſels ;&nbsp;but the late emperor Sidi Mahomet ſubdued them both,&nbsp;and annexed them to the empire ; ſince which time the&nbsp;harbour of Rabat has been ſo filled with the ſand waſhed in by the ſea as to render it unfit to carry on ſuch&nbsp;piracies in future.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The town of Rabat, whoſe walls incloſe a large ſpace </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">ground, is defended on the ſea-fide by three forts to-lerably well finiſhed, which were erected ſome little time&nbsp;ago by an Engliſh renegado, and furniſhed with guns&nbsp;from Gibraltar. The houſes in general are good, and&nbsp;many of the inhabitants are wealthy. The Jews, who&nbsp;are very numerous in this place, are generally in better&nbsp;circumſtances than thoſe of Larache or Tangier, and&nbsp;their women are extremely beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The caſtle, which is very extenſive, contains a ſtrong building, formerly uſed by the late emperor as his prin-cipal treaſury, and a noble terrace, which commands an&nbsp;extenfive proſpect oſ the town of Sallee, the ocean, and&nbsp;all the neighbouring country. There are alſo the ruins&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">another caſtle, which is ſaid to have been built by&nbsp;Jacob Almonzor, one of their former emperors, and of&nbsp;which at preſent very little remai∏3 but its walls, con-taining within them ſome very ſtrong magazines for&nbsp;powder and naval ſtores. Οη the outſide of theſe walls&nbsp;is a very high and ſquare tower, handſomely built of&nbsp;cut ſtone, and called the tower of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hajfin.</span><span class="font1"> From the&nbsp;workmanſhip of this tower, contraſted with the other&nbsp;buildings, a very accurate idea may be formed how great-ly the Moors have degenerated from their former ſplen-dour and taſte for aιchitecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABBETTING, in carpentry, the planning or cut-ting of channels or grooves in boards, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In ſhip-carpentry, it figmies the letting in of the planks </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the ſhip into the keel; which, in the rake aιid</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h1><span class="font1">run </span><span class="font0">of a ſhip, is hollowed away, that the planks may </span><span class="font1">join the cloſer.</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">RABBI, or Rabbins, a title which the Phariſees and doctors of the law among the Jews aſſumed, and&nbsp;literally fignifies </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mqflers</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">excellents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There were ſeveral gradations before they arrived at the dignity of a rabbin ; which was not conferred till&nbsp;they had acquired the prcfoundeſt knowledge of the&nbsp;law and the traditions. It does not, however, appear&nbsp;that there was any fixed age or previous examination&nbsp;ncceſſary ; but when a man had diſtinguiſhed himſelſ by&nbsp;his ſkill in the written and oral law, and paſſed through&nbsp;the ſubordinate degrees, he was faluted a rabbin by the&nbsp;public voice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the modern Jews, for near 700 years paſt, the learned men retain no other title than that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rabbi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rabbins</span><span class="font1"> ; they have great reſpect paid them, have the&nbsp;firſt places or ſeats in their ſynagogues, determine all&nbsp;matters of controverſy, and frequently pronounce upon&nbsp;civil affairs ; they have even power </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>f</sup>o</span><span class="font1"> excommunicate&nbsp;the diſobedient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABBIN1STS, among the modern Jews, an appellation given to the doctrine of the rabbins concerning traditions, in oppofition to the Caraites ; who reject all&nbsp;traditions. See Car ait e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABELAIS (Francis), a French writer famous ſor his facetiouſneſs, was born at Chinonin Touraine about&nbsp;the year 1483. . He was ſirſt a Francifcan⅛ friar ; but&nbsp;quitting his religious hablt ſtudied phyſic at Montpelier,&nbsp;where he took his doctor’s degree. It is ſaid, that the&nbsp;chancellor du Pratt ha ing aboliſhed the privileges of&nbsp;the faculty of phyſic atv Montpelier by a decree of the&nbsp;parliament, Rabelais h ad the addreſs to make him revoke what he had don e ; and that thofe who were madc&nbsp;doctors of that univerſity wore Rabelais’s robe, which&nbsp;is there held in great veneration. Some time after, he&nbsp;came to Rome, in quality of phyſician in ordinary to&nbsp;Cardinal John du Bellay archbiſhop of Paris. Rabelais is&nbsp;ſaid to have uſed the freedom to jeer Pope Paul III. to&nbsp;his face. He had quitted his religious connections for&nbsp;the ſake of leading a life more agreeable to his taſte ;&nbsp;but renewed them on a ſecond journey to Rome, when&nbsp;he obtained, in 1536, a brief to qualify him for holding eccleſiaſtical benefices ; and, by the intereſt of his&nbsp;friend Cardinal John du Bellay, he was received as a ſecular canon in the abbey of St Maur near Paris. His&nbsp;profound knowledge in phyſic rendered him doubly uſeful ; he being as ready, and at leaſt as well qualified, to&nbsp;prefcribe for the body as for the foul : but as he was a&nbsp;man of wit and humour, many ridiculous things are laid&nbsp;to his charge, of which he was quite innocent. He&nbsp;publiſhed ſeveral things ; but his chief performance is&nbsp;a ſtrange incoherent romance, called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">IIfiory oſ Gargantua and Pantagruel,</span><span class="font1"> being a ſatire upon prieſts, popes,&nbsp;fools, and knaves of all kinds. This work contains a&nbsp;wild, irregular profuſion of wit, learning, obſcenſty,&nbsp;low conceits, and arrant nonſenſe ; hence thc ſhrewd-neſs of his ſatire, in ſome places where he is to be underſtood, gains him credit ſor thoſe where no meaning is diſcoverable. Some alluſions may undoubtedly&nbsp;have been ſo temporary and local as to be now quite&nbsp;loſt : but it is too much to conclude thus in favour of&nbsp;every unintelligible rhapſody ; for we are not without&nbsp;Engliſh writers of great talents, whoſe ſportive geniufes&nbsp;have betrayed them into puerilities, no leſs incoherent at</span></p>
