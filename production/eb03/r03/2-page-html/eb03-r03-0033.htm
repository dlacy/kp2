<p><span class="font0">found in every part of this country. The valleys, </span><span class="font1">or </span><span class="font0">ſtraths, are generally covered with wood ; and near Al-frag there are foreſts of fir ιy ôr 20 miles in length,&nbsp;well ſtocked with deer and game of all forts. Great&nbsp;numbers of black cattle, horſes flιeep, and goats, are&nbsp;fed upon the mountains ; and the ſea, rivers, and lakes,&nbsp;teem with fiſh and fowl. The lochs on the weſtern&nbsp;coaſt abound with herrings in the ſeaſon, particularly&nbsp;Loch Eu, about nine miles long, and three in breadth ;&nbsp;one part of this is formed by a bay, or inlet of the ſea ;&nbsp;and the other is a lake of freſh water. The Tides of it&nbsp;are covered with wood, where formerly abundance of&nbsp;iron was ſmelted. Though the middle part of Roſs,&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ardroſs,</span><span class="font0"> is mountainous and ſcarce inhabited,&nbsp;the north-eaſt parts on the rivers Okel, Charron, and&nbsp;Frith of Tayne, are fruitful, and abound with villages.&nbsp;Coygach and Aſsgut, two northerly diſtricts, are bare&nbsp;and hilly ; yet they abound with deer and black cattle;&nbsp;and we ſee ſeveral good houſes towards the coaſt, where&nbsp;there are alſo promontories, and huge r0ck3 of marble.&nbsp;Ardmeanach part of the peninſula betwixt the bays&nbsp;cf Cromarty and Murray, is a barony, which of old&nbsp;be owed a title on the king of Scotland’s ſecond ſon.&nbsp;The di rict of Glen-elchig, on the ſouth-we ‘, as the&nbsp;paternal e '.ate of the earl of Seafo th, chief of the clan&nbsp;of Mackenzie : but the la I earl of that name, having&nbsp;riſen in rebellion, was in the year 1719 defeated at Glen-ihiel, in th∣s very quarter, together with a ſmall body&nbsp;of Spaniards by whom he had been joined. His auxiliaries were taken ; and though he himſelf, with ſome&nbsp;of his friends, eſeaped to the continent, his e <sup>ι</sup>ate and&nbsp;honours were forfeited. At the ſame time, the king’s&nbsp;troops, who obtained this victory, diſmantled the caſtle of Yion donnen, ſituated on an iſland in a bay that&nbsp;fronts the ifle of Sky. It belonged to the crown ; but&nbsp;the office of hereditary governor was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ve'</span><span class="font0"> ed in the earl&nbsp;of Seaforth, and here he had erected his magazine.&nbsp;Roſs is chiefly peopled by the Mackenzies and Fraſers,&nbsp;two warlike clans, who ſpeak Erſe, and live in the&nbsp;Highland faſhion. There are fiſheries carried on along&nbsp;the coa<sup>ι</sup>' ; but their chief traffic is with ſſieep and&nbsp;black cattle. The chief towns of Roſs are Channerie,&nbsp;Dingwall, Tayne, and Fortroſe.</span></p>

There is nothing in this archiepiſco-pal city that claims much notice ; the buildings are&nbsp;mean, the ſtreets vilely paved and contrived. The number of inhabitants does not exceed 6000, wſho ſubſiſt by&nbsp;the ſale of their oil, the principal object of their attention, though the territory produces a great deal of good&nbsp;wine and corn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roffano probably owes its origin to the Roman emperors, who conſidered it as a poll equally valuable for ſtrength and convenience of traffic. The Marfans, a&nbsp;family of French extraction, poffeffed this territory,&nbsp;with the title of prince, from the time of Charles II.&nbsp;to that of Alphonſus II. when the laſt male heir was,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">by </span><span class="font0">that prince’s order, put to death in Iſchia, where he</span></p>
