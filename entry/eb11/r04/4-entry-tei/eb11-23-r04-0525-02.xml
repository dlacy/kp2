               <p>                   <label>ROMANIN, SAMUELE</label> (1808-1861), Venetian historian, was born
                    of a poor Jewish family at Trieste. Being left an orphan at an early age, he
                    provided for his younger brothers and sister by giving French and German
                    lessons. In 1821 he settled in Venice, where he afterwards translated
                    Hammer-Purgstall’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des osmanischen Reiches</hi>
                    into Italian. He next published his own <hi rend="italic">Storia dei Popoli
                        Europei</hi> (Venice, 1843-44). He taught in a private school and was sworn
                    interpreter in German to the courts of justice; on the expulsion of the
                    Austrians in 1848 he was appointed professor of history by the provisional
                    government, and he lectured on Venetian history at the Ateneo Veneto. In 1852 he
                    began to publish his monumental <hi rend="italic">Storia documentata di
                        Venezia,</hi> but although he finished the work, carrying it down to the
                    fall of the republic in 1798, he did not live to see the publication completed,
                    as he died of apoplexy on the 9th of September 1861; among his papers were found
                    all the documents which were to be added,</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0526" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0567.jp2"/>
               <p>and the index. The tenth and last volume was issued in 1861.</p>               <p>After Romanin’s death his lectures on Venetian history were published in two
                    volumes (Florence, 1875). Among his minor works we may mention: <hi
                        rend="italic">Gli Inquisitori di Stato di Venezia</hi> (Venice, 1858), <hi
                        rend="italic">Bajamonte Tiepolo e le sue ultime vicende</hi> (Venice, 1851),
                    and <hi rend="italic">Venezia nel 1789</hi> (Venice, 1860).</p>            </div>
