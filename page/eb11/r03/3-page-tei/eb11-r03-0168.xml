(See Hare and Rabbit.)</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Extinct Rodents</hi></p><p>Among extinct rodents, only a few of the more important types may be noticed. As to the origin of the order, we are still to a great extent in the dark; and even the relations of the Duplicidentata to the Simplicidentata are not yet fully understood. With regard to the latter point, it is, however, considered probable that both are branches of a common stock, which diverged from each other before all the typical rodent characters were acquired. As to the ancestral stock of the order, it has been suggested that this is represented by certain Lower Eocene European and North American mammals, at one time regarded as primitive Primates. In Europe these include <hi rend="italic">Plesiadapis</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Protoadapis,</hi>  and in North America <hi rend="italic">Mixodectes, Microsyops</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Cynodontomys ;</hi>  the last three constituting the family Mixodectidae. Possibly the European forms, in which the dental formula has been given as <hi rend="italic">c.</hi>  8, <hi rend="italic">pi, m.</hi>  and there is a gap between the incisors and the cheek-teeth, are more nearly related to modern rodents than the American types, and may indeed belong to the sa me order. On the other hand, the American forms, which have one pair of large chisel-like incisors in the lower jaw, also possess a lower canine, and show no marked gap in front of the cheek-teeth, nor any indication of the characteristic rodent backwards movement of the lower jaw. On these grounds, while admitting that they are allied to the rodents, it has been pointed out that they can scarcely be included in the Rodentia, and the order Proglires has in consequence been proposed for their reception.</p><p>Whatever may be the true affinity of these problematical mammals, undoubted rodents are known from the Lower Eocene of both Europe and North America. In Europe these form the genus <hi rend="italic">Ischyrornys</hi>  and the family Ischyromyidae, and have premolars f, and all the cheek-teeth low-crowned,, with simple cusps of ridges. Possibly they are akin to the Sciuridae. In America, <hi rend="italic">Paramys, </hi>with transversely ridged molars, is allied ; and the European <hi rend="italic">Sciuromys </hi>should perhaps find a place in the same neighbourhood. A more advanced phase is represented in the European Lower Oligocene by the Pseudosciuridae, with the genera <hi rend="italic">Pseudosciurus, Sciuroides, Trechomys, Theridomys,</hi>  &amp;c., in which part of the masseter passes through the broad infra-orbital canal, and the premolars are J; the molars being low-crowned, many-rooted and either cusped or ridged. These rodents are thought to be allied to the Anomaluridae; and it is partly on their evidence that the family Pedetidae is placed next the latter. Here it may be mentioned that <hi rend="italic">Leithia,</hi>  from the Pleistocene of Malta, originally regarded as a giant dormouse, seems near akin to <hi rend="italic">Anomalurus.</hi>  In the highly specialized mastoid region of the skull, the North American Oligocene <hi rend="italic">Protoptychus</hi>  approaches to <hi rend="italic">Dipopodornys,</hi>  while the contemporary <hi rend="italic">Gymnoptychus</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">En-toptychus</hi>  likewise appear referable to the Geomyidae. The Upper Oligocene <hi rend="italic">Cricetodon</hi>  in Europe and <hi rend="italic">Eurnys</hi>  in America are the earliest known forerunners of the cricetine Muridae; while at the same time primitive beavers appear in the form of <hi rend="italic">Stemeofiber,</hi>  to be succeeded in the European Pleistocene by the gigantic <hi rend="italic">Trogontherittm.</hi></p><p>The still larger North American Pleistocene <hi rend="italic">Castoroides,</hi>  known by one species of the size of a bear, and the allied West Indian <hi rend="italic">Amblyrhiza,</hi>  appear to be specialized beavers, although they have been referred to a family by themselves. Near akin is the North American Miocene family Mylagaulidae, typified by <hi rend="italic">Mylagaulus, </hi>but including <hi rend="italic">Mesogaulus</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Protogaulus.</hi>  Although showing some dental characters approximating to the porcupines, these rodents are regarded as allied to the Castoridae, although forming an isolated type. The prominent feature, writes Mr E. S. Riggs, is the unusual development of the premolar to the exclusion of the posterior teeth. Associated with this is the strength and sharpness of the lower jaw, the prominence and anterior position of the masseteric ridge, and the depth of the ramus from the alveolar line to the angle. These indicate unusual capacity for crushing or grinding; while the last premolar is a crushing implement, which has reached the highest degree of specialization knewn in Rodentia. It is suggested that these teeth may have been employed for cracking nuts or hard seeds, although also used for grinding. The remarkable North American <hi rend="italic">Ceratogaulus,</hi>  with a large bony nasal horn, belongs to the same family. To discuss the remaining Miocene and later fossil Simplicidentata would be doing little more than adding to the generic names referable to the various existing families, lt may be mentioned, however, that the distribution of these later Tertiary types accords very closely with that of their existing relatives; the families of South American hystricoids being represented by a number of extinct genera in the formations of Argentina and Brazil. Special mention may be made of <hi rend="italic">Megamys,</hi>  from the caves of Brazil, which, while apparently allied to the living viscacha, attained dimensions approximating to those of a hippopotamus.</p><p>As regards the Duplicidentata, it appears that the families Ocho-tonidae and Leporidae had become differentiated as early as the Lower Miocene. <hi rend="italic">Titanomys</hi>  is the earliest form, from the Middle Miocene, succeeded by <hi rend="italic">Lagopsis,</hi>  and then by the modern <hi rend="italic">Ochotona. </hi>In this line there is a tendency to lose the last upper molar, but in <hi rend="italic">Prolagus,</hi>  which ranges in the Pliocene from Sardinia and Corsica to Spain, and forms a side-branch, the corresponding lower tooth has likewise disappeared. In contradistinction to <hi rend="italic">Titanomys,</hi>  in which the cheek-teeth are rooted, is the North American Upper OIigocene <hi rend="italic">Palaeolagus,</hi>  where they are rootless. . In general dental characters, especially the retention of three pairs of molars, this genus approximates to the Leporidae, although in the absence of post-orbital processes and the pattern of the molars it departs less widely from the modern Ochotonidae than does <hi rend="italic">Prolagus.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Authorities.—The above article is partly based on that by G.

Roderick succeeded to Connaught in 1156, and after ten years<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  fighting won back the title of high king. His ill-advised persecution of Dermot (Diarmait MacMurchada), king of Leinster, furnished the pretext for the Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland. Roderick endeavoured to expel the invaders, but was driven behind the Shannon. He delayed his submission to Henry II. until 1175, when a treaty was concluded at Windsor. Roderick, under this agreement, held Connaught as the vassal of England, and exercised lordship over all the native kings and chiefs of Ireland; in return he undertook to pay an annual tribute. The treaty did not put an end to the wars of the Norman adventurers against Connaught and Roderick’s dependants. He held out till iiQi; but then, weary’ of strife, retired to the cloister. He died in Π98, the last of the high kings of Ireland.</p><p>See GiraIdus Cambrensis, <hi rend="italic">Opera,</hi>  vol. v.

(1906) town, ir,076; commune, 15,502. Rodez is situated on the southern border of the Causse of Rodez, on an isolated plateau bordered on the E. and S. by the river Aveyron. The cathedral was built between 1277 and 1535. A great Flamboyant rose-window and a gallery in the same style are the chief features of the principal façade, which is flanked by two square towers and has no portal. Each transept has a fine Gothic doorway. On the north side of the building rises a tower (1510-1526) of imposing height (253 ft.). The three upper stages are richly decorated, and the whole is surmounted by a colossal statue of the Virgin. In the cathedral are a fine rood-loft, some good wood-carving and the tombs of several bishops. Other interesting buildings are the episcopal palace (r7th and Iqthcenturies), flanked by a massive tower, relic of an older palace; the church of St Amans, of Romanesque architecture, restored in the 18th century; and, among other old houses, the hôtel d’Armagnac built in the Renaissance period on the site of the old palace of the counts. The ruins of a Roman amphitheatre still exist in Rodez, which is supplied with water by a Roman aqueduct. About 6 m. to the north of Rodez is the chasm of Tindoul de la Vayssière, leading to a subterranean river issuing in the springs of the picturesque village of SalIes-Ia-Source.</p><p>The town is the seat of a bishop, a prefect and a court of assizes, and has tribunals of first instance and commerce, a chamber of commerce, a branch of the Bank of France, a lycée training college for both sexes and an ecclesiastical seminary. The industries include wool-spinning and the weaving of woollen goods.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
