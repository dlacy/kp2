                an enlargement of the citizen body.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Marcus Livius Drusus </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> who as tribune
                gallantly took up the task of reform, is claimed by Cicero@@<sup>1</sup> as a member
                of that&nbsp;party of the centre to which he belonged himself.&nbsp;Noble, wealthy
                and popular, he seems to have hoped&nbsp;to be able by the weight of his position
                and character&nbsp;to rescue the burning questions of the day from the&nbsp;grasp of
                extreme partisans and to settle them peacefully and&nbsp;equitably. But he, like
                Cicero after him, had to find to his&nbsp;cost that there was no room in the fierce
                strife of Roman politics&nbsp;for moderate counsels. His proposal to reform the law
                courts&nbsp;excited the equestrian order and their friends in the senate
                to&nbsp;fury. The agrarian and corn laws which he coupled with
                    it@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>alienated many more in the senate, and roused the old
                antipopular party feeling; finally, his known negotiations with the&nbsp;Italians
                were eagerly misrepresented to the jealous and excited&nbsp;people as evidence of
                complicity with a widespread conspiracy&nbsp;against Rome. His laws were carried,
                but the senate pronounced&nbsp;them null and void.@@<sup>3</sup> Drusus was
                denounced in the&nbsp;senate house as a traitor, and on his way home was&nbsp;struck
                down by the hand of an unknown assassin. His&nbsp;assassination was the signal for
                an outbreak which&nbsp;had been secretly prepared for some time before.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Throughout the highlands of central and southern Italy the flower of
                the Italian peoples rose as one man.@@<sup>4</sup> Etruria and&nbsp;Umbria held
                aloof; the isolated Latin colonies stood firm; but&nbsp;the Sabellian clans, north
                and south, the Latinized Marsi and&nbsp;Pacligni, as well as the Oscan-speaking
                Samnites and Lucanians,&nbsp;rushed to arms. No time was lost in proclaiming their
                plans&nbsp;for the future. A new Italian state was to be formed. The&nbsp;Paelignian
                town of Corfinium was selected as its capital and rechristened with the proud name
                of Italica. All Italians were to&nbsp;be citizens of this new metropolis, and here
                were to be the place&nbsp;of assembly and the senate house. A senate of 500
                members&nbsp;and a magistracy resembling that of Rome completed a constitution which
                adhered closely to the very political traditions which&nbsp;its authors had most
                reason to abjure.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Now, as always in the face of serious danger, the action of Rome was
                prompt and resolute. Both consuls took the field;@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>with each were
                five legates, among them the veteran Marius and&nbsp;his destined rival L. Cornelius
                Sulla, and even freedmen were&nbsp;pressed into service with the legions. But the
                first year’s&nbsp;campaign opened disastrously. In central Italy the
                northern&nbsp;Sabellians, and in the south the Samnites, defeated the
                forces&nbsp;opposed to them. And though before the end of the year Marius&nbsp;and
                Sulla in the north, and the consul Caesar himself in Campania, succeeded in
                inflicting severe blows on the enemy, and on&nbsp;the Marsi especially, it is not
                surprising that, with an empty&nbsp;treasury, with the insurgents’ strength still
                unbroken, and with&nbsp;rumours of disaffection in the loyal districts, opinion in
                Rome&nbsp;should have turned in the direction of the more liberal policy&nbsp;which
                had been so often scornfully rejected and in favour of&nbsp;some compromise which
                should check the spread of the revolt, and&nbsp;possibly sow discord among their
                enemies. Towards the&nbsp;close of the year 90 the consul L. Julius Caesar
                (killed&nbsp;by Fimbria in 87) carried the </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">lex Julia@@<sup>6</sup></span><span class="font2"> by
                which&nbsp;thé Roman franchise was offered to all communities&nbsp;which had not as
                yet revolted; early in the next year&nbsp;(89) the Julian law was supplemented by
                the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lex&nbsp;Plautia
                Papiria,</span><span class="font2"> introduced by two of the tribunes,</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">M. Plautius Silvanus and C. Papirius Carbo Arvina, which enacted that
                any citizen of an allied community then domiciled&nbsp;in Italy might obtain the
                franchise by giving in his name to a&nbsp;praetor in Rome within sixty days. A third
                law </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(lex
                Calpurnia),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">apparently passed at the same time,
                empowered Roman magistrates in the field to bestow the franchise there and then
                upon&nbsp;all who were willing to receive it. This sudden opening of the&nbsp;closed
                gates of Roman citizenship was completely successful,&nbsp;and its effects were at
                once visible in the diminished vigour of&nbsp;the insurgents. By the end of 89 the
                Samnites and&nbsp;Lucanians were left alone in their obstinate hostility&nbsp;to
                Rome, and neither, thanks to Sulla’s brilliant campaign&nbsp;in Samnium, had for the
                moment any strength left for active&nbsp;aggression.</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font2">The termination of the Social War brought with it no peace in
                    Rome. The old quarrels were renewed with increased&nbsp;bitterness, and the
                    newly enfranchised Italians themselves&nbsp;complained as bitterly of the
                        restriction@@<sup>7</sup> which robbed them&nbsp;of their due share of
                    political influence by allowing them to vote&nbsp;only in a specified number of
                    tribes. The senate itself was distracted by violent personal rivalries—and all
                    these feuds, animosities and grievances were aggravated by the
                    widespread&nbsp;economic distress and ruin which affected all
                        classes.@@<sup>8</sup> Lastly,&nbsp;war with Mithradatcs VI. had been
                    declared; it was notorious&nbsp;that the privilege of commanding the force to be
                    sent against&nbsp;him would be keenly contested, and that the contest would
                    lie&nbsp;between the veteran Marius and L. Cornelius
                Sulla.@@<sup>9</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">It was in an atmosphere thus charged with* the elements of
                    disturbance that P. Sulpicius Rufus as tribune@@<sup>10</sup>
                    brought&nbsp;forward his laws. He proposed—(1) that the command of the
                    Mithradatic war should be given to&nbsp;Marius, (2) that the new citizens should
                    be distributed&nbsp;through all the tribes, (3) that the freedmen should&nbsp;no
                    longer be confined to the four city tribes, (4) that any&nbsp;senator owing more
                    than 2000 denarii should lose his seat,&nbsp;(5) that those exiled on suspicion
                    of complicity with the Italian&nbsp;revolt should be recalled. These proposals
                    inevitably provoked&nbsp;a storm, and both sides were ominously ready for
                    violent&nbsp;measures. The consuls, in order to prevent legislation, proclaimed
                    a public holiday. Sulpicius replied by arming his&nbsp;followers and driving the
                    consuls from the forum. The proclamation was withdrawn and the laws carried, but
                    Sulpicius’s&nbsp;triumph was short-lived. From Nola in Campania, where
                    lay&nbsp;the legions commanded by him in the Social War, Sulla advanced&nbsp;on
                    Rome, and for the first time a Roman consul entered the&nbsp;city at the head of
                    the legions of the Republic. Resistance was&nbsp;hopeless. Marius and Sulpicius
                        fled,@@<sup>11</sup> and Sulla, summoning&nbsp;the assembly of the
                    centuries, proposed the measures he considered necessary for the public
                    security, the most important&nbsp;being a provision that the. sanction of the
                    senate should be&nbsp;necessary before any proposal was introduced to the
                        assembly.@@<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>Then, after waiting in Rome long enough to
                    hold the&nbsp;consular elections, he left for Asia early in 87.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Sulla had conquered, but his victory cost the Republic dear. He
                    had first taught political partisans to look for final success,&nbsp;not to a
                    majority of votes in the forum or campus,&nbsp;but to the swords of the
                    soldiery. The lesson was well&nbsp;learnt. Shortly after his departure L.
                    Cornelius&nbsp;Cinna as consul revived the proposals of
                        Sulpicius;@@<sup>13</sup> his&nbsp;colleague, Gnaeus Octavius, at the head
                    of an armed force&nbsp;fell upon the new citizens who had collected in crowds to
                    vote,</span></p>
