<p><span class="font0">more dignified, but less influential, post of president of the council, a process which his enemy Halifax describcd as being&nbsp;“ kicked upstairs.” Although appointed lord lieutenant of&nbsp;Ireland, Rochester did not take up this position; he was still&nbsp;president of the council when James II. became king in February&nbsp;1685, and he was at once appointed to the important office of&nbsp;lord treasurer. But in spite of their family relationship and&nbsp;their long friendship, James and his treasurer did not agree.&nbsp;The king wished to surround himself with Roman Catholic&nbsp;advisers; the earl, on the other hand, looked with alarm on&nbsp;his master’s leanings to that form of faith. In January 1687&nbsp;he was removed from his office of treasurer, being solaced&nbsp;with a pension of £4000 a year and a gift of Irish lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the revolution of 1688 Rochester appeared as a leader of the Tories, and he opposed the election of William and Mary&nbsp;as king and queen, raising his voice for the establishment of a&nbsp;regency on behalf of the exiled James. But he soon reconciled&nbsp;himself to the new order, perhaps because he could not retain&nbsp;his pension unless he took the oaths of allegiance. After this&nbsp;he was quickly in the royal favour and again a member of the&nbsp;privy council. He advised the queen in ecclesiastical matters,&nbsp;and returned to his former position as the leader of the High&nbsp;Church party. From December 1700 until February 1703 he&nbsp;was lord lieutenant of Ireland, although he did not spend much&nbsp;time in that country, and the concluding years of his public&nbsp;life were mainly passed in championing the interests of the&nbsp;Church. In 1710 he was again made lord president of the&nbsp;council. He died on the 2nd of May 1711, and was succeeded&nbsp;by his only son, Henry (1672-1758), who in 1724 inherited the&nbsp;earldom of Clarendon. When Henry died without issue on the&nbsp;10th of December 1758 all his titles became extinct.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROCHESTER, a city, municipal and parliamentary borough of Kent, England, on the river Medway, 33 m. E.S.E. of London&nbsp;by the South-Eastern &amp; Chatham railway, contiguous to&nbsp;Chatham and Strood. Pop. (1901) 30,590. Chatham lies east of&nbsp;the city on the same bank of the river, while Strood is opposite,&nbsp;on the left bank, bcing connected with Rochester by a railway&nbsp;bridge and by an iron swing bridge, the latter occupying the&nbsp;site of a bridge which spanned the Medway before the Conquest.&nbsp;The cathedral church of St Andrew was originally founded by&nbsp;Augustine in 604, for whom Æthelbert built the church. It&nbsp;was partially destroyed by the Danes, but was rebuilt, with a&nbsp;long choir and square east end, by Bishop Gundulph, the second&nbsp;Norman bishop (1077-1108). Gundulph at the same time&nbsp;(1089) established an order of Benedictine monks here. Bishop&nbsp;Ernulf (1115-24), who as prior of Canterbury and abbot of&nbsp;Pcterborough had already distinguishcd himself as a builder,&nbsp;completed and also renovated the church, lengthening it by&nbsp;two bays eastward; the old chapter-house remains. The&nbsp;beautiful Norman west front was built about 1125-30, and in&nbsp;1130 the new cathedral was consecrated About 1201 a baker,&nbsp;William of Perth, while on a pilgrimage was murdered near&nbsp;Rochester by robbers. He was buried in the cathedral and.&nbsp;was canonized, his shrine becoming a famous resort of pilgrims,&nbsp;who brought much wealth to the monastery. The edifice&nbsp;suffered from fire in 1137 and in 1171. During the whole of&nbsp;the 13th and a part of the 14th century a gradual rebuilding,&nbsp;or sometimes mcre recasing, of the church was effected from&nbsp;east to west. The work included an extended choir by William</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">de Hoo (1227), enlargement of the main transepts, the building of piers for a central tower, and treatment of the nave to the&nbsp;third bay. About 1352 a low central tower was built, to which&nbsp;a spire was added in the next century. Towards the end of&nbsp;the 15th century St Mary’s chapel was added, the Norman&nbsp;clcrestory was rebuilt, and a great west window inserted.&nbsp;Though a comparatively small building, being only 306 ft. in&nbsp;length and 65 ft. in breadth at the nave, the cathedral is of&nbsp;much architectural interest, and exhibits a variety of styles&nbsp;from Norman to Perpendicular. The rich and varied decoration&nbsp;of the Norman nave (especially the triforium) is very notc-WOrthy, as is also the chapter-house doorway, a fine example&nbsp;of Decorated work. Thc Early English portion of the building&nbsp;is less successful. The ruins of Gundulph’s Tower stand detached from and are earlier than the church; this tower was&nbsp;built by Bishop Gundulph probably as a defensive w’ork for&nbsp;the eastern boundary of the city. The crypt beneath the&nbsp;choir is of special interest, showing early Norman work in&nbsp;the western part. The remainder is Early English, and there&nbsp;are traces of mural painting. The cathedral contains many&nbsp;interesting monuments, including a plain slab assigned to&nbsp;Gundulph, and several tombs of bishops of the 13th century,&nbsp;among them that of Bishop Walter de Alerton, founder of&nbsp;Merton College, Oxford (d. 1277). The library attached to&nbsp;the modern chapter-house contains, among various valuable&nbsp;relics, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Text us Roffensis<sub>j</sub></span><span class="font0"> being records of the cathedral&nbsp;compiled in the time of Bishop Ernulf. The old episcopal&nbsp;palace is partly converted into dwelling-houses. Portions&nbsp;of the wall of the priory dormitory and the refectory doorway&nbsp;may also still be seen. Among various restorations of the&nbsp;cathedral in the 19th century the earliest was that of Lewis&nbsp;Cottingham (1825-27), who erected a Decorated central tower&nbsp;unsuited to the general character of the building.. Bishop&nbsp;Hamo de Hythe (1319-52) had erected a tower with short&nbsp;spire of timber and lead, and of this the general design is reproduced in the present tower and spire from designs of Mr&nbsp;C. H. Fowler, begun in 1904 under Dean Hole, who, however,&nbsp;did not survive to see its dedication on St Andrew’s day at&nbsp;the close of the same year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The parish church of St Nicholas was built in 1421, and restored after a fire in 1892. In Saxon times the cathedral&nbsp;was the parish church, but after the establishment of a monastery here, monks and parishioners quarrelled as to their rights,&nbsp;and a new parish church was built.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the eminence overlooking the right bank of the river and commanding a wide view of the surrounding country are the&nbsp;extensive remains of the Norman castle, part of which was&nbsp;built by Bishop Gundulph at the order of William Rufus towards the close of the nth century. The castle was besieged&nbsp;by King John, by Simon de Montfort in the reign of Henry III.,&nbsp;and in the reign of Richard II. by a party of rebels during the&nbsp;insurrection of Wat Tyler. It was repaired by Edw’ard IV.,&nbsp;but soon afterwards fell into decay, although the massive keep&nbsp;is still in good preservation. This, one of the finest relics of&nbsp;its kind in England, is considered to be the work of Wilham dc&nbsp;Corbeil, archbishop of Canterbury, to whom the castle was&nbsp;granted in 1126. It is a quadrangular four-storeyed structure,&nbsp;flanked by turrets, with an extreme height of 120 ft. Remains&nbsp;of the 13th-century walls which once surrounded the city also&nbsp;exist. Gad’s Hill, above Strood, to the north-west, is famous&nbsp;as the residence of Charles Dickens. At Borstal, south-west&nbsp;of Rochester, is a large convict prison. Among the principal&nbsp;public buildings of secular character in the city are the town&nbsp;hall (1687), the corn exchange with free library and a museum,&nbsp;the county court offices, and the Richard Watt’s almshouses&nbsp;(1579). Besides these almshouses there are a number of other&nbsp;charities, among which the almshouse of St Catherine originated&nbsp;in 1316 as a leper’s hospital A picturesque Ehzabethan mansion&nbsp;was acquired by the corporation for a museum as a memorial&nbsp;of Queen Victoria’s Diamond Jubilee. The principal schools&nbsp;are the cathedral grammar-school or King’s School, founded in&nbsp;1544, and the Williamson mathematical school (1704), formerly</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
