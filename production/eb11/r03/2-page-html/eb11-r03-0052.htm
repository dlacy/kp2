<p><span class="font0">long technical treatise would be required to name the many combinations of cordage and spars which make up the total&nbsp;rigging. All that is attempted here is to give the 'main lines&nbsp;and general principles or divisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The vessel dealt with here is the fully rigged ship of three or more masts. But she includes all the others and the principles&nbsp;are the same. The simplest of all forms of rigging is the dipping&nbsp;lug, a quadrangular sail hanging from a yard, and always&nbsp;hoisted on the side of the mast opposite to that on which the&nbsp;wind is blowing (the lee side). When the boat is to be tacked&nbsp;so as to bring the wind on the other side, the sail is lowered&nbsp;and rehoisted. One rope can serve as halliard to hoist the sail&nbsp;and as a stay when it is made fast on the weather side on which&nbsp;the wind is blowing. The difference between such a craft and&nbsp;the fully rigged ship is that between a simple organism and a&nbsp;very complex one ; but it is one of degree, not of kind. The&nbsp;steps in the scale are innumerable. Every sea has its own&nbsp;type. Some in eastern waters are of extreme antiquity, and&nbsp;even in Europe vessels are still to be met with which differ&nbsp;very little if at all from the ships of the Norsemen of the 9th&nbsp;and 10th centuries. For a full account of these varieties of&nbsp;rigging the reader may be referred to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mast and Sail in Europe&nbsp;and Asia</span><span class="font0"> (London, 1906), by H. Warington Smyth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the finer degrees of variation are neglected the types of rigging may be reduced to comparatively few, which can be classed&nbsp;by the shapeof their sail and the number of their masts. At the&nbsp;bottom of the scale is such a craft as the Norse herring boat (fig. 2).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">She has one quadrangular sail suspended from a yard which is hung (or dung) by the middle to a single mast which is placed (or&nbsp;stepped) in the middle of the boat. She is the direct representative&nbsp;of the ships of the Norsemen. Her one sail is a ” course ” such as&nbsp;is still used on the fore and mainmasts of a fully developed ship;&nbsp;a topsail may be added (as in fig. 3) and then we have the beginning</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of a fully clothed mast. A very similar craft called a Humber keel is used in the north of England. The lug sail is an advance on&nbsp;the course, since it is better adapted for sailing on the wind, with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the wind on the side. When the lug is not meant to be lowered, and rehoisted on the lee side, as in the dipping lug mentioned above,&nbsp;it is slung at a third from the end of the yard, and is called a standing&nbsp;lug. A good example of the lug is the Chinese junk (fig. 4). The Fig. 4.—Four-masted Junk lug is a “ lifting sail,” and does not tend to press the vessel&nbsp;down as the fore and aft sail does. Therefore it is much used by&nbsp;fishing vessels in the North Sea. The type of the fore and aft rig is the schooner(fig 5) The sails on the masts have a gaff above and a boom below. Theses spars have a prong called“the jaws,” which fit tothe mast, and are held in place by a “ jaw rope ” on which are threaded beads called trucks. Sails of this shape are carried by fully rigged ships on the mizzen mast, and can be spread</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">on the fore and main. They are then called try sails and are used only in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">bad weather when little sail can be carried, and are hoisted on the trysail mast, a small mast attached to the great one. The Lateen (Latin) sail (fig. 6) is a triangular sail akin to the lug, and is the prevailing type of the Mediterranean. These original types, even when unmodified by mixture with any other, permit of large&nbsp;variations. The number of masts of a lugger may vary from one&nbsp;to five, and of a schooner from two to five or even seven. A small&nbsp;lug may be carried above the large one, and a gaff topsail added to&nbsp;the sails of a schooner. A small-masted fore-and-aft-rigged vessel&nbsp;may be a cutter (fig. 7) or sloop. But the pure types may be combined, in topsail schooner, brigantines, barquentines and barques,&nbsp;when the topsail, a quadrangular sail hanging from and fastened&nbsp;to a yard, slung by the middle, is combined with fore and aft sails.&nbsp;The lateen rig has been combined with the square rig to make such&nbsp;a rigging as the xebec—a three-masted vessel square rigged on the&nbsp;main, and lateen on the fore and mizzen. Triangular sails of the </span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
