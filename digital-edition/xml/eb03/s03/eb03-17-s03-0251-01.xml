in natural hiſtory, the name of a large claſs of foſſils, the characters of which are theſe : they are bodies compoſed of ſlender and ſcarce viſible filaments, arranged into fine, even, and thin flakes ; and thoſe diſpoſed into regular figures, in the ſeveral different genera, approaching to a rhomboïde, or hexangular column, or a rectangled parallelogram ; fiſſile, like the talcs, but they not only lie in a horizontal, but also in a perpendicular direction : they are flexile in a ſmall degree, but not at all elaſtic ; they do not ferment with acid menstrua, but readily calcine in the fire. Of this clals there are ſeven orders of bodies, and under thoſe ten genera. The selenitæ of the firſt order are thoſe compoſed of horizontal plates, and approaching to a rhomboidal form: of the second are thoſe compoſed of horizontal plates, arranged into a columnar and angular</p><p>form: of the third are thoſe whoſe filaments are ſcarce visibly arranged into plates, but which, in the whole maſſes, appear rather of a ſtriated than of a tubulated ſtructure: of the fourth are thoſe which are flat, but of no determinately angular figure : of the fifth are thoſe formed of plates, perpendicularly arranged : of the sixth are thoſe formed of congeries of plates, arranged into the figure of a ſtar ; and of the ſeventh are thoſe of a complex and indeterminate figure.</p><p>Of the firſt of theſe orders there are three genera.</p><p>1. The <hi rend="italic">leptodecarbombes. 2.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">pachodecarbombes.</hi> 3.The <hi rend="italic">tetradecarbοmbes.</hi> Of the second order there are also three genera. 1. The <hi rend="italic">iſchnamb luces. 2. The iſambluces.</hi> 3. The <hi rend="italic">οxuciae.</hi> Of the third order there is only one known genus, the <hi rend="italic">inamblucia.</hi> Of the fourth order there is also only one known genus, the <hi rend="italic">ſanidia.</hi> Of the fifth order there is also only one known genus, the <hi rend="italic">cathetοlipes.</hi> Of the sixth order, there are two genera. 1. The <hi rend="italic">lepaſlra.—</hi></p><p>2. The <hi rend="italic">trichestra.</hi> Of the ſeventh order there is only one genus, the <hi rend="italic">ſymplexia.</hi></p><p>The ſtructure of the ſelenitas of all the genera of the firſt order is exactly alike ; they are all compoſed of a great number of broad flakes or plates, in a great meaſure externally reſembling the flakes of the soliaceous talcs : theſe are of the length and breadth of the whole maſs ; the top and bottom being each only one ſuch plate, and thoſe between them, in like manner, each complete and ſingle; and the body may always be easily and evenly ſplit, according to the direction of theſe flakes. Theſe differ, however, extremely from the talcs, for they are each compoſed of a number of parallel threads or filaments, which are uſually diſpoſed parallelly to the ſides of the body, though sometimes parallelly to its ends. In many of the ſpecies they are also divided by parallel lines, placed at a conſiderable diſtance from each other, and the plates in ſplitting often break at theſe lines ; add to this, that they are not elaſtic, and that they readily calcine. The ſtructure of thoſe of the second order is the ſame with that of the firſt ; but that in many of the ſpecimens of them the filaments of which the plates are compoſed ran in two directions, and meet in an obtuſe angle ; and in the middle there is generally ſeen in this cafe a ſtraight line running the whole length of the column and ſmall parcels of clay inſinuating themſelves into this crack, repreſent in it the figure of an ear of graſs so naturally, as to have deceived many into a belief that there was really an ear of graſs there. The other orders conſiſting only of ſingle genera, the ſtructure of each is explained under the generical name.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SelenItes,</hi> in chemiſtry, called <hi rend="italic">also gypſum spatosum,</hi> a species of gypſum or platter of Paris.
