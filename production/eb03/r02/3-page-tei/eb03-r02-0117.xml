The ſenate took offence at the regard which the king ſhowed to fιιch mean people, who had but lately ſhaken off their fetters ; but Servius, by a moſt humane and judicious diſcourſe, entirely appeaſed the fathers, rvho paſſed his inſtitution into a law, which ſubliſted ever after.</p><p>The wiſe king, having thus eſtabliſhed order among the people, undertook at laſt to reform the royal power itſelf ; his equity, which was the main ſpring of all his reſolutions, leading him to act contrary to his own intereſt, and to ſacriſice one half of the royal authority to the public good. His predeceſſors had reſerved to themſelves the cognizance of all cauſes both public and private ; but Servius, finding the duties of his office too much for one man to diſcharge well, committed the cognizance of ordinary ſuits to the ſenate, and reſerved that only of ſtate-crimes to himſelf.</p><p>All things being now regulated at home, both in the city and country, Servius turned his thoughts abroad, and formed a ſeheme for attaching the Sabines and Latins to the Romans, by ſuch ſocial ties as ſhould be ſtrengthened by religion. He ſummoned the Latin and Sabine cities to ſend their deputies to Rome, to conſult about an affair of great importance. When they were come, he propoſed to them the building of a temple in honour of Diana, where the Latins and Sabines ſhould meet once a year, and join with the Romans in offering ſacrifices to that goddeſs ; that this feſtival ſhould be followed by a council, in which all diſputes between the cities ſhould be amicably determined ; that there proper meaſures ſhould be taken to purſue their common intereſt ; and, laſtly, in order to draw the common people thither, a fair ſhould be kept, at which every one might furniſh himſelf with what he wanted. The king’s deſign met with no oppoſition : the deputies only added to it, that the temple ſhould be an inviolable aſylum ſor the united nations ; and that all the cities ſhould contribute toward the expence of building it. It being left to the king to chooſe a proper place for it, he pitched upon the Aventine hill, where the temple was built, and aſſemblies annually held in it. The laws which were to be obſerved in theſe general meetings were engraved on a pillar of braſs, and were to be ſeen in Auguſtus’3 time, in the Latin tongue, but in Greek characters.</p><p>But now Servius was grown old ; and the ambition of Tarquin his ſon-in-law revived in proportion as the king advanced in years. His wife uſed her utmoſt endeavours to check the raſhneſs and fury of her huſhand, and to divert him from all criminal enterpriſes ; while her younger filter was ever inſtigating Arunx, who placed all his happineſs in a private life, to the moſt villanous attempts. She was continually lamenting her fate in being tied to inch an indolent huſhand, and wiſhing ſhe had either continued unmarried, or were become a widow. Similitude of temper and manners, formed, by degrees, a great intimacy between her and Tarquin. At length ſhe propoſed nothing leſs to him than the murdering of her father, ſiſter, and huſhand, that they two might meet and aſcend the throne together. Soon after, they paved their way to an ince-ſtuous marriage, he by poiſoning his wife, and ſhe her</p><p>huſhand ; and then had the aſſurance to aik the king’s</p><lb/><p>and queen’s confent to their marriage. Servius arid Tarquinia, though they did not give it, were filent, through too much indulgence to a daughter in whom now was their only hope of poſterity. But theſe criminal nuptials were only the firſt ſtep towards a yet greater iniquity. The wicked ambition of the new-married couple firſt ſhowed itſelf againſt the king : for they publicly declared, that the crown belonged to them ; that Servius was an ufurpcr, who, being appointed tutor to Tarquin’s grandchildren, had deprived his pupils of their inheritance ; that it was high time for an old man, who was but little able to ſupport the ' weight of public affairs, to give place to a prince who was of a mature age, &amp;c.</p><p>The patricians, whom Servius had takert great pleaſure in humbling during the whole time of his reign, were eaſily gained over to Tarquin’s party ; and, by the help of money, many of the poorer citizens were alſo brought over to his intereſt. The king, being informed of their treafonable practices, endeavoured to diſſuade his daughter and ſon-indaw from ſuch proceedings, which might end in their ruin ; and exhorted them to wait for the kingdom till his death. But they, deſpiſing his counſels and paternal admonitions, reſolved to lay their claim before the ſenate ; which Servius was obliged to ſummon : ſo that the affair came to a formal proceſs. Tarquin reproached his father-in-law with having aſcended the throne without a previous interregnum ; and with having bought the votes of the people, and deſpiſed the ſuffrages of the ſenate. He then urged his own right of inheritance to the crown, and injuſtice of Servius, who, being only his guardian, had kept poiſeſſion of it, when he himſelf was of an age to govern. Servius anſwered, that he had been lawfully elected by the people ; and that, if there could be an hereditary right to the kingdom, the ſons of Ancus had a much better one than the grandſons of the late king, who muſt himſelf have been an uſurper. He then referred the whole to an aſſembly of the people ; which being immediately proclaimed all over the city, the forum was ſoon filled ; and Servius harangued the multitude in ſuch a manner as gained all their affections. They all cried out with one voice, <hi rend="italic">Let Servius reign ; let him continue to make the Romans happy.</hi>  A-midſt their confuſed clamours, theſe words were likewiſe heard : <hi rend="italic">Let Tarquin periſh ; let him die; let us kill him.</hi>  This language frightened him ſo, that he retired to his houſe in great haſte ; while the king was conducted back to his palace with the acclamations of the people.</p><p>The ill ſucceſs of this attempt cooled Tarquin’s ardent deſire of reigning ; but his ambition made him act a new part. He undertook to regain the favour of his father-in-law by careſſes, ſubmiſſions, and proteſtations of a ſincere regard and affection for him ; inſomuch that the king, who judged of the policy of others from his own, was ſincerely reconciled to him, and tranquillity re-eſtabliſhed in the royal family. But it was not long ere Tarquin, rouſed hy the continual reproaches of his wife, began to renew his intrigues among the ſenators ; of whom he had no ſooner gained a conſider-able party, than he clothed himſelf in the royal robes, and cauſing the faſees to be carried before him by ſome of his domeſtics, croſſed the Roman forum, entered the temple where the ſenate uſed to meet, and ſeated him-</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
