<p><span class="font1">we ſuppoſe the body unconnected with any fixed points, but as having its axis acted on by the ſeme forces which&nbsp;theſe points exert, the body would turn as we obſerve&nbsp;it to do, the axis remaining at reſt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">It would be a defirable thing in our machines which derive their efficacy from a rotatory motion, to apply&nbsp;the preſſures arifing from the power and from the reiiſt-ance oppoſed by the work in ſuch a manner as to annihilate of diminiſh this preflure on the ſupport?. of the&nbsp;axis of motion. Attention to this theorem will point&nbsp;'out what may be done ; and it is at all times proper,&nbsp;nay neceſſary, to know what are the preſſures in the&nbsp;points of ſupport. If we are ignorant of this, we ſhall&nbsp;run the riſk of our machine failing in thoſe parts; and&nbsp;our anxiety to prevent this will make υs load it with&nbsp;needleſs and ill-diſpoſed ſtrength. In the ordinary theories of machines, deduced entirely from the principles&nbsp;of equilibrium, the preſſure on the points of ſupport&nbsp;(exclufive of what proceeds from the weight of the machine itſelf) is ſtated as the ſanae as if the moving and&nbsp;refitting forces were applied immediately to theſe points&nbsp;in their own directions. But this is in all caſes erroneous; and, in caſes of ſwift motions, it is greatly ſo. We&nbsp;may be convinced of this by a very fimple inſtance.</span></p>
    <p><span class="font1">Suppoſe a line laid over a pulley, and a pound weight at one end of it, and ten pounds at the 0ther5 the&nbsp;preſſure of the axis 011 its ſupport is eleven pounds, ac-ct rding to the uſual rule ; whereas we ſhall find it only&nbsp;3<sub>τ</sub><sup>7</sup>y. For, if we call the radius of the pulley 1, the&nbsp;momentum of the moving force i⅞ιo×ι — 1χ1, &quot;&nbsp;9 ; and the momentum of inertia isιo×ι<sup>2</sup>ff-f×ι<sup>,</sup>.&nbsp;(n<sup>c</sup> 18.) — 11. Therefore the angular velocity is -,-<sup>y</sup><sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;But the diſtance ÇG of the centre oſ gravity from the&nbsp;axis of motion ⅛&gt; alſo <sub>1</sub><sup>9</sup>,-, becauſe we may ſuppoſe the&nbsp;two weights in contact with the circumference of the&nbsp;pulley. Therefore the velocity of the centre oſ gravity&nbsp;is <sub>τ</sub>-'∙<sup>,</sup><sub>1</sub> X ∙<sub>1</sub><sup>y</sup>,∙,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-<sub>r</sub><sup>8</sup><sub>1</sub>∖ of its natural velocity.

<p><span class="font1">Since all our machines conſiſt of inert matter, which <sup>1 </sup>requires force to put it in motion, or to ſtop it, or to '&nbsp;change its motion, it is plain that ſome of our natural ‘&nbsp;power is expended in producing this effect ; and ſince&nbsp;the principles of equilibrium only ſtate the proportion&nbsp;between the power and reſiſtance which will preſerve·&nbsp;the machine at reſt, our knowledge of the actual performance of a machine is imperfect, unleſs we know&nbsp;how much of our power is thus employed Tt is only&nbsp;the remainder which can be ſtated in oppoſition to the&nbsp;reſiſtance oppoſed by the work. This renders it proper to give ſome general propofitions, which enable us&nbsp;to compute this with eaſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It would be very convenient, for inſtance, to know ſome point in which we might ſuppoſe the whole rota&nbsp;tory part of the machine concentrated ; becauſe then we&nbsp;could at once tell what the momentum of its inertia is,&nbsp;and what force we muſt apply to the impelled point of&nbsp;the machine, in order to move it with the defiled velocity.</span></p>
