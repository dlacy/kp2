<p><span class="font0">In 1496 Count Eberhard died, and enemies of Reuchlin had the ear of the new prince. He was glad therefore&nbsp;hastily to follow the invitation of John of Dalburg the&nbsp;scholarly bishop of Worms, and flee to Heidelberg, which&nbsp;was then the seat of the “ Rhenish Society,” a lively and&nbsp;active circle of humanists under Dalburg’s presidency,&nbsp;equally zealous in the service of Apollo and Bacchus. In&nbsp;this court of letters Reuchlin’s appointed function was to&nbsp;make translations from the Greek authors, in which his&nbsp;reading was already extremely wide. Many of these&nbsp;versions were never printed, but a considerable number of&nbsp;pieces were given to the press at intervals down to the&nbsp;year 1519, and formed an important element in his efforts&nbsp;to spread a knowledge of Greek. For, though Reuchlin&nbsp;had no public office as teacher, and even at Heidelberg&nbsp;was prevented from lecturing openly, he was during a&nbsp;great part of his life the real centre of all Greek teaching as well as of all Hebrew teaching in Germany. No&nbsp;young man of promise who came to him for help was&nbsp;rejected ; he taught many and found teachers for others,&nbsp;or gave direction and solution of difficulties to more&nbsp;advanced scholars. Thus he was a sort of unofficial&nbsp;general director of the studies of Germany, and to carry&nbsp;out this work he found it necessary to provide a series&nbsp;of helps for beginners and others. He never published&nbsp;a Greek grammar, though he had one in MS. for use&nbsp;with his pupils, but he put out several little elementary Greek books ; and these with the series of translations were in fact the text books of the German youth.&nbsp;Reuchlin, it may be noted, pronounced Greek as his native&nbsp;teachers had taught him to do, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font0"> in the modern Greek&nbsp;fashion. This pronunciation, which he defends in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dia-logus de Recta Lat. Græcique Serm. Pron.,</span><span class="font0"> 1519, came to&nbsp;be known, in contrast to that used by Erasmus, as the&nbsp;Reuchlinian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At Heidelberg Reuchlin had many private pupils, among whom Franz von Sickingen is the best known&nbsp;name ; and all his relations, except with the monks who&nbsp;stopped his attempt to lecture on Hebrew, were very&nbsp;pleasant. With the monks he had never been well ; at&nbsp;Stuttgart also his great enemy was the Augustinian&nbsp;Holzinger. On this man he took a scholar’s revenge in&nbsp;his first Latin comedy </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sergius,</span><span class="font0"> a satire on -worthless monks&nbsp;and false relics which his young Heidelberg friends were&nbsp;eager to act. But, Dalburg thinking this unsafe, he&nbsp;wrote for them a new piece, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scenica Progymnasmata</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Henno,</span><span class="font0"> based on the old French play of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Maître Pathelin,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which is not without humour and sparkle of language, and&nbsp;much better constructed than the French piece.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Through Dalburg, Reuchlin came into contact with Philip of the Pfalz, who employed him to direct his son’s&nbsp;studies, and in 1498 gave him the mission to Rome&nbsp;which has been already noticed as fruitful for Reuchlin’s&nbsp;progress in Hebrew. He came back laden with Hebrew&nbsp;books, and found when he reached Heidelberg that a&nbsp;change of Government had opened the way for his return&nbsp;to Stuttgart. His wife had remained there all along ; so&nbsp;that we may assume that he never looked on his exile&nbsp;as more than temporary. His friends were the party of&nbsp;order and good government, who could not long remain&nbsp;powerless. They had now again the upper hand, and&nbsp;knew Reuchlin’s value. In 1500, or perhaps in 1502, he&nbsp;was named “triumvir of Swabia,” a very high judicial&nbsp;office in the Swabian League, which he held till 1512, when&nbsp;he retired to a small estate near Stuttgart. By this time&nbsp;the long conflict which gives Reuchlin’s life its chief&nbsp;interest had already begun.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For many years Reuchlin had been increasingly absorbed in Hebrew studies, which had for him more than&nbsp;a mere philological interest. Though he was always a&nbsp;good Catholic, and even took the habit of an Augustinian&nbsp;monk when he felt that his death was near, he was too&nbsp;thorough a humanist to be a blind Catholic. He knew&nbsp;the abuses of monkish religion, and was interested in the&nbsp;reform of preaching </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(De Arte Predicandi,</span><span class="font0"> 1503—a book&nbsp;which became a sort of preacher’s manual) ; but above all&nbsp;as a scholar he was eager that the Bible should be better&nbsp;known, and could not tie himself to the authority of the&nbsp;Vulgate. To him the Old Testament Scriptures meant&nbsp;the Hebrew text, and this he was determined to study&nbsp;with an independent love for truth : “ I honour St Jerome&nbsp;as an angel ; I value Lira as a master ; but I worship&nbsp;truth as my God.” The key to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hebræa veritas</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;the grammatical and exegetical tradition of the mediæval&nbsp;rabbins, especially of Kiιnhi, and when he had mastered&nbsp;this himself he was resolved to open it to others. In&nbsp;1506 appeared his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rudimenta Hebraica—</span><span class="font0">grammar and&nbsp;lexicon—mainly after Kimhi, yet not a mere copy of one&nbsp;man’s teaching. The edition was costly and sold slowly.&nbsp;In 1510 he was glad to offer Amorbach seven hundred&nbsp;and fifty copies at the reduced price of a florin for three&nbsp;copies. Even then Amorbach could hardly find purchasers,&nbsp;but Reuchlin bade him be patient, “ for if I live Hebrew&nbsp;must with God’s help come to the front.” One great&nbsp;difficulty was that the wars of Maximilian in Italy prevented Hebrew Bibles coming into Germany. But for&nbsp;this also Reuchlin found help by printing the Penitential&nbsp;Psalms with grammatical explanations (1512), and other&nbsp;helps followed from time to time. But Reuchlin had&nbsp;yet another interest in Hebrew letters. His Greek studies&nbsp;had interested him in philosophy, and not least in those&nbsp;fantastical and mystical systems of later times with which&nbsp;the Cabbala has no small affinity. Following Pico, he&nbsp;seemed to find in the Cabbala a profound theosophy&nbsp;which might be of the greatest service for the defence of&nbsp;Christianity and the reconciliation of science with the&nbsp;mysteries of faith—an unhappy delusion indeed, but one&nbsp;not surprising in that strange time of ferment, when the&nbsp;old and the new intellectual life had not yet clearly discriminated themselves, and when men of progress sought&nbsp;less to free themselves from mere tradition than to find&nbsp;an ancient tradition of truth which had been lost in the&nbsp;darkness of mediæval ignorance. Reuchlin’s mystico-cabbalistic ideas and objects were expounded in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Verbo Mirifico,</span><span class="font0"> 1494, and finally in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Arte Cabba-listica,</span><span class="font0"> 1517. We see therefore that not only the philological tradition but the most esoteric wisdom of the&nbsp;rabbins was in his eyes of the greatest value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Unhappily many of his contemporaries held other views, and thought that the first step to the conversion of the&nbsp;Jews was to conquer their obstinacy by taking from them&nbsp;their books. This view had for its chief advocate the&nbsp;bigoted John Pfefferkorn, himself a baptized Hebrew.&nbsp;Pfefferkorn’s plans were backed by the Dominicans of&nbsp;Cologne; and in 1509 he got from the emperor authority&nbsp;to confiscate all Jewish books directed against the Christian&nbsp;faith. Armed with this mandate, he visited Stuttgart&nbsp;and asked Reuchlin’s help as a jurist and expert in putting&nbsp;it into execution. Reuchlin evaded this demand, mainly&nbsp;because the mandate lacked certain formalities, but he&nbsp;could not long remain neutral. The execution of Γfeffer-korn’s schemes led to difficulties and to a new appeal to&nbsp;Maximilian. It was resolved to call in the opinion of&nbsp;experts, and in 1510 Reuchlin was summoned in the name&nbsp;of the emperor to give his formal opinion on the suppression of the Jewish books. His answer is dated from&nbsp;Stuttgart, November 6, 1510 ; in it he divides the books&nbsp;into six classes—apart from the Bible which no one proposed to destroy—and, going through each class, he shows&nbsp;that the books openly insulting to Christianity are very</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
