<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prsetorian Amendments on the Law of Succession.—</span><span class="font1">The most important change in the law of succession during the latter half of the - republic was due to the praetors. They introduced, tinder the name&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1 </sup>what was really beneficial enjoyment of the&nbsp;estate of a deceased person without the legal title of inheritance.&nbsp;There is much to lead to the conclusion that the series of provisions&nbsp;in regard to it which we find in the Julian consolidation of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edici</span><span class="font1"> were the work of a succession of praetors, some of them probably not under the republic but under the empire ; but it will be&nbsp;convenient to give here a general view of the subject as a whole,&nbsp;disregarding the consideration that some of its features may not</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">have Deen given to it within the period now under notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">J ustinian, speaking of the origin of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio,</span><span class="font1"> observes that in promising it to a petitioner the praetors were not always&nbsp;actuated by the same motives ; in some cases their object was to&nbsp;facilitate the application of the rules of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font1"> in some to&nbsp;amend their application according to what they believed to be the&nbsp;spirit of the XII. Tables, in others, again, to set them aside as inequitable. It is not unreasonable to assume that it was with the&nbsp;purpose of aiding thejits </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">civile</span><span class="font1"> that the first step was taken in what&nbsp;gradually became a momentous reform ; and it is extremely probable that this first step was the announcement by some praetor that,&nbsp;where there was dispute as to an inheritance, and a testament was&nbsp;presented to him bearing not fewer seals than were required by law,&nbsp;lie would give possession of the goods of the defunct to the heir&nbsp;named in it.@@<sup>2</sup> In this as it stands there is nothing but a regulation&nbsp;of possession of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bona</span><span class="font1"> of the inheritance pending the question of&nbsp;legal right. Just as between two parties contending about the ownership of a specific thing in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rei vindicatio</span><span class="font1"> the praetor first settled the&nbsp;question of interim possession, so did he promise to do here when a&nbsp;question was about to be tried about the right to an inheritance </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(si&nbsp;de hereditate ambigitur).</span><span class="font1"> It was a provisional arrangement merely,&nbsp;and very necessary in view of the state of the law which permitted&nbsp;a third party, apart from any pretence of title, to step in and complete a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">usucapio pro herede</span><span class="font1"> by a year’s possession of the effects of the&nbsp;inheritance </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(supra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 692). Even at the time when the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edict</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;closed it was not necessarily more than a provisional grant; for, if&nbsp;heirs-at-law of the deceased appeared and proved that, although&nbsp;the testament bore on the outside the requisite number of seals,&nbsp;yet in fact some solemnity of execution, such as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae venditio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">testamenti nuncupalio,</span><span class="font1"> had been omitted, the grantee had to yield&nbsp;them up the possession that had been given him pending inquiry.&nbsp;It was only by a rescript of Marcus Aurelius’s that it was declared&nbsp;that a plea by the heir-at-law of invalidity of a testament on the&nbsp;ground of defect of formalities of execution might be defeated by an&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cxceptio doli,</span><span class="font1"> on the principle that it was contrary to good faith to&nbsp;set aside the wishes of a testator on a technical objection that was&nbsp;purely formal. Thus was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio secundum tabulas,&nbsp;i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> in accordance with a testament, from being originally one in&nbsp;aid of thejui </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">civile,</span><span class="font1"> in course of time converted into one in contradiction of it. That the motives and purposes of the series of&nbsp;praetors who built up the law of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font1"> must have varied&nbsp;in progress of years is obvious ; and, once the machinery had been&nbsp;invented, nothing was easier than to apply it to new ideas. The&nbsp;praetor could not make a man heir,—that he always disclaimed;&nbsp;but he could give a man, whether heir or not, the substantial advantages of inheritance, and protect him in their enjoyment by&nbsp;praetorian remedies. He gave him possession of the goods of the&nbsp;deceased, with summary remedies for ingathering them, which,&nbsp;once in his hands, would become his in quiritarian right on the&nbsp;expiry of the period of usucapion ; and, by interpolation into the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">formula</span><span class="font1"> of a fiction of heirship, he gave him effectual personal&nbsp;actions against debtors of the deceased, rendering him liable in&nbsp;the same way to the deceased’s creditors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another variety of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font1"> was that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">contra tabulas, </span><span class="font1">—in opposition to the terms of a testament. If a testator had&nbsp;neither instituted nor expressly disinherited a son who was one of&nbsp;his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes,</span><span class="font1"> then his testament was a nullity, and the child&nbsp;passed over had no need of a praetorian remedy. Where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">other than sons were passed over the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> allowed them to participate with the instituted heirs by a sort of accrual. But the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edict</span><span class="font1"> went further; for, if the institute was a stranger, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> not&nbsp;brother or sister of the child passed over, then, on the petition of&nbsp;the latter, the praetor gave him and any other </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui</span><span class="font1"> concurring with&nbsp;him possession of the whole estate of the deceased, the institute&nbsp;being left with nothing more than the empty name of heir. Another</span></p>

Hechts,</span><span class="font0"> voi. ii. g 176. Of the&nbsp;later literature if is enough to mention Leist, in the first 4 vols. of his continuation of Gluck’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pandeeten-Commentar,</span><span class="font0"> Erlangen, 1870-79.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2 </sup>Cic., </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">In Verr.</span><span class="font0"> II., i. 45, § 117. He says (writing in 684) that an edict to that effect was already </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tralaticium, i.e.,</span><span class="font0"> had been adopted year after year by a&nbsp;series of praters. Gaius (ii. 119) speaks of seven at least as the requisite number of seals ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font0"> those of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">libripens</span><span class="font0"> and the five citizen witnesses, and that&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aniestatus,</span><span class="font0"> whose functions are not well understood, but whose official&nbsp;designation appended to his seal recurs so regularly in inscriptions as to leave&nbsp;no doubt that his was the seventh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">application of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio contra tabulas</span><span class="font1"> was to the case of emancipated children of the testator’s. By the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> he was&nbsp;not required to institute or disinherit them ; for by their emancipation they had ceased to be siri </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heredes,</span><span class="font1"> and had lost that interest&nbsp;in the family estate which was put forward as the reason why they&nbsp;had to be mentioned in the testament of their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;praetors—although probably not until the empire, and when the&nbsp;doctrines of the Jits </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">naturalc</span><span class="font1"> were being more freely recognized—&nbsp;put them on the same footing as unemancipated children, requiring&nbsp;that they also should be either instituted or disinherited, and giving&nbsp;them </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font1"> if they were not. It was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">contra tabulas</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;the sense that it displaced the instituted heirs either wholly or&nbsp;partially,—wholly when the institutes were not children of the&nbsp;deceased, partially when they were. In the latter case, at least&nbsp;when </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui</span><span class="font1"> were affected by it, the grant of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;under the very equitable condition that the grantees should collate or bring into partition all their own acquisitions since their&nbsp;emancipation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The third variety of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font1"> was that granted </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab intestato.</span><span class="font1"> As has been shown on a previous page (p. 692), the rules of the jws </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">civile</span><span class="font1"> in reference to succession on intestacy were extremely&nbsp;strict and artificial. They admitted neither emancipated children&nbsp;nor agnates who had undergone </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio</span><span class="font1"> ; they admitted&nbsp;no female agnate except a sister ; if the nearest agnate or agnates&nbsp;declined, the right did not pass to those of the next degree ; mere&nbsp;cognates, kinsmen of the deceased who were not agnates, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> grandchildren or others related to him through females and agnates </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitc&nbsp;minuti,</span><span class="font1"> were not admitted at all ; while a wife had no share unless&nbsp;she had been </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in manu</span><span class="font1"> of the deceased and therefore </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fliae loco.</span><span class="font1"> All&nbsp;these matters the praetors amended, and so far paved the way for&nbsp;the revolution in the law of intestate succession which was accomplished by Justinian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The classes they established were four. (1) Displacing the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes</span><span class="font1"> of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font1"> they gave the first place to descendants&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(liberi),</span><span class="font1"> including in the term all those whom the deceased would&nbsp;have been bound either by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> or the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edict</span><span class="font1"> to institute&nbsp;or disinherit had he made a will, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> his wife </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in manu,</span><span class="font1"> his natural&nbsp;(as distinguished from adopted) sons and daughters whether </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;potestate</span><span class="font1"> at his death or emancipated, the representatives of sons&nbsp;who had predeceased him, and adopted children in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">when he died. (2) On failure of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">liberi</span><span class="font1"> the right to petition for&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font1"> opened to the nearest collateral agnates of the&nbsp;intestate, under their old name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legitimi heredes.</span><span class="font1"> (3) Under the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font1"> on failure of agnates (and of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> where there was&nbsp;one), the succession was vacant and fell to the fisc, unless perchance&nbsp;it was usucapted by a stranger possessing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pro herede.</span><span class="font1"> The frequency&nbsp;of such vacancies was much diminished by the recognition by the&nbsp;praetors of the right of cognates to claim </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font1"> in the&nbsp;third place. Who they had primarily in view under the name of&nbsp;“cognates” it is impossible to say. The epithet is most frequently&nbsp;applied by modern writers to kinsmen related through females ;&nbsp;but in its widest sense it included all kinsmen without exception,&nbsp;and in a more limited sense all kinsmen not entitled to claim as&nbsp;agnates. There were included amongst them therefore—although&nbsp;it is very probable that the list was not made up at once, but from&nbsp;time to time by the action of a series of praetors—not merely kinsmen related through females (who were not agnates), but also&nbsp;agnates of a remoter degree who were excluded as such because the&nbsp;nearest agnates in existence had declined, persons who had been&nbsp;agnates but by reason of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis minutio</span><span class="font1"> had lost that character,&nbsp;female agnates more distantly related than sisters, and children of&nbsp;the intestate’s who at the time of his death were in an adoptive&nbsp;family. All these took according to proximity. (4) Finally, the&nbsp;claim passed to the survivor of husband and wife, assuming always&nbsp;that their marriage had not involved </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus.</span><span class="font1"> This list constituted&nbsp;the prsetorian order of succession on intestacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All these </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessions</span><span class="font1"> had to be formally petitioned for. In that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab intestato</span><span class="font1"> descendants were allowed a year for doing so,&nbsp;while other persons were limited to 100 days, the period for those&nbsp;entitled in the second place beginning when that of those entitled&nbsp;in the first had expired, and so on. The grant was always made&nbsp;at the risk of the petitioner ; nothing was assured him by it; it&nbsp;might turn out real and substantial </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(cum re)</span><span class="font1"> or merely nominal&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(sine re),</span><span class="font1"> according as the grantee could or could not maintain it&nbsp;against the heir of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the jus civile.</span><span class="font1"> For the latter was entitled to&nbsp;stand on his statutory or testamentary right, without applying for&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio,</span><span class="font1"> although in fact he often did so for the sake of&nbsp;the summary procedure it supplied him for ingathering the effects&nbsp;of the deceased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Law of Procedure.—</span><span class="font1">The substitution of the formular system of procedure for that by the “actions of the law” commenced long&nbsp;before the end of the period now under consideration ; and we have&nbsp;had occasion more than once to observe how greatly it facilitated&nbsp;the development of the institutions of property and contractual&nbsp;obligation. But as the change was only completed in the early&nbsp;empire it will be more convenient to defer explanation of the nature&nbsp;of the new procedure in the meantime.
