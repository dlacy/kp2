The ſtyle is ſhorter than the filicula. There is only one species, the</hi> aquatica, <hi rend="italic">which is a native of Britain. It is about an inch high. The leaves are awl-ſhaped, and grow in cluſters round the root. The ſtalk is naked, and produces four or five ſmall white flowers growing alternately on ſhort footſtalks. It flowers under water, whereas moſt aquatic plants emerge above water at the time of flowering. The Author of Nature has, however, carefully prevented the tender flower from receiving any injury from the water, by making the petals dole, and form themſelves into a kind of arch. This plant grows on the borders of the Highland lakes, in Loch Tay, in Scotland, alſo in Wales and Ireland.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
