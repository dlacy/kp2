<p><span class="font2">graver Girardet at the age of sixteen for Paris. He was on the eve of obtaining the great prize for engraving when&nbsp;the events of 1815 blasted his hopes, for Neufchâtel was&nbsp;restored to Prussia and Robert was struck off the list of&nbsp;competitors as a foreigner. Having fortunately whilst&nbsp;continuing his studies under Girardet never ceased to&nbsp;frequent the studio of David, he now determined to become a painter, and only returned to his native country&nbsp;when his master himself was exiled. At Neufchâtel he&nbsp;had the good fortune to attract the notice of Roullet de&nbsp;Mezerac, who enabled him by a timely loan to proceed to&nbsp;Rome. At Rome Robert soon struck the vein of subject&nbsp;destined to render his talent celebrated. In depicting the&nbsp;customs and life of the people, of southern Italy especially,&nbsp;he showed peculiar feeling for the historical characteristics&nbsp;of their race. All his work of this class was distinguished&nbsp;by an individual style : the actors bore themselves with an&nbsp;air of distinction and something of gravity which witnessed&nbsp;to their ancient lineage, and the rhythmical play of line&nbsp;which characterized all these compositions had a peculiar&nbsp;affinity to the nature of the types which figured in them.&nbsp;The charm of choice in these types, the beauty of this play&nbsp;of line, and the plastic restraint and measure which also&nbsp;marked Robert’s treatment of his favourite subjects were&nbsp;the points to which he owed the wide recognition of his&nbsp;talent, for his command of his own powers was anything&nbsp;but ready and his difficulty in bringing out what he desired&nbsp;to produce shackled him, and especially so because painting requires a sure and ready hand if its means are to be&nbsp;used with brilliant effect. After executing many detached&nbsp;studies of Italian life Robert conceived the idea of painting four great works which should represent at one and&nbsp;the same time the four seasons in Italy and the four leading races of its people. In the Return from the Fête of&nbsp;the Madonna delΓ Arco (Louvre) he depicted the Neapolitans and the spring. This picture, exhibited at the Salon&nbsp;of 1827, achieved undoubted success and was bought for&nbsp;the Luxembourg by Charles X.; but the work which appeared in 1831—the Summer Reapers arriving in the&nbsp;Pontine Marshes (Louvre), which became the property of&nbsp;Louis Philippe — established the artist’s reputation, and&nbsp;Robert found himself with all his hopes of honour fulfilled&nbsp;and reckoned as one of the leading masters of his day.&nbsp;Florence and her autumn vineyards should now have&nbsp;furnished him with his third subject. He attempted to&nbsp;begin it, but, unable to conquer his unhappy passion for&nbsp;Princess Charlotte Napoleon (then mourning the violent&nbsp;death of her husband, Robert’s devoted friend), he threw&nbsp;up his work and went to Venice, where he began and&nbsp;carried through the fourth of the series, the Fishers of&nbsp;the Adriatic. This work was not equal to the Reapers.&nbsp;Worn by the vicissitudes of painful feeling and bitterly&nbsp;discouraged, Robert committed suicide before his easel,&nbsp;20th March 1835, on the tenth anniversary of the melancholy suicide of a brother to whom he had been much&nbsp;attached.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROBERT of Gloucester, an English antiquary and historical writer, who lived in the second half of the 13th&nbsp;century, was a monk of the abbey at Gloucester, and is&nbsp;supposed by Hearne, the editor of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle,</span><span class="font2"> to have&nbsp;been sent to preside over the foundation at Oxford (afterwards Worcester College), where the younger members of&nbsp;the abbey were partly educated. This, however, is mere&nbsp;conjecture. The evidence which establishes his claim to&nbsp;be the author of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font2"> (by which he is best known)&nbsp;is also extremely slight. In the Harleian MS. 201 (from&nbsp;which Hearne printed his edition) there occurs (fol. 159b&nbsp;to 160) an account of the battle of Evesham. The narration implies that the writer was living at that time (1265),&nbsp;for he describes the dark and dismal weather that pre&nbsp;vailed on the day of the battle, adding, “ This isci Roberd,&nbsp;That verst this boc made,”—a passage, however, which&nbsp;may possibly have reference not to the versifier but to the&nbsp;original compiler of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>1</sup></span><span class="font2"> The period at which&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font2"> was composed was evidently late in the 13th&nbsp;or early in the 14th century, as it contains a reference to&nbsp;the canonization of St Louis, king of France, which took&nbsp;place on lltlι August 1297. From an historical point of&nbsp;view, however, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font2"> is of but little value. The&nbsp;internal evidence shows it to have been a translation from&nbsp;the French and the original in turn to have been a mere&nbsp;compilation. The narrative commences with a description&nbsp;of Britain, taken from Henry of Huntingdon ; the material&nbsp;is next derived mainly from Geoffrey of Monmouth, and&nbsp;then, again, from William of Malmesbury, special information being supplied, here and there, from Henry of Huntingdon, Ailred of Rievaulx, and the Annals of Winchester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the other hand, the value of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font1"> as an illustration of the versification and language of the period is considerable. Λs&nbsp;a writer of English verse Robert comes first in order, being prior&nbsp;to both Robert of Brunne and Laurence Minot, and he has accordingly been styled the Ennius of English literature. His diction,&nbsp;again, affords many interesting points of comparison with that&nbsp;known as Old English on the one hand and the language of&nbsp;Chaucer and William Tyndale on the other. In his verses we first&nbsp;find the term “Saxons” used in opposition to Normans (Hearne,&nbsp;p. 363), although “English” is the term by which, throughout&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronide,</span><span class="font1"> the original population is more generally designated.&nbsp;Of the English tongue itself, however, he says </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cb.,</span><span class="font1"> p. 125) that&nbsp;“]je Saxones speche it was, and ]&gt;orw hem ycome yt ys.” Many&nbsp;of the most noteworthy peculiarities of his diction will be found&nbsp;pointed out in Mr. Kingdon Oliphant’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Old and Middle English,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">pp. 430-439.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Other compositions attributed to Robert of Gloucester are—a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> of St Alban in verse (MS. Ashmole, 43), a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> of St Patrick,&nbsp;also in verse (MS. Tanner, 17), a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> of St Bridget (MS. C.C.C.&nbsp;Camb., 145), and a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> of St Alphege (MS. Cott. Julius, D. ix.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The only complete edition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font0"> is that edited by Thomas Heamb (Oxford, 1724), 2 vols. Svo, partly from the Harleian MS. 201, and partly from&nbsp;the Cottonian MS. Calig. A. xi., and reprinted at London in 1810, 2 vols. 8vo.&nbsp;This, however, is extremely defective, Hearne's collation of the important&nbsp;MS. in the library of the college of Arms being very imperfect. For further&nbsp;information see Hardy’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Descriptive Catalogue of ΜSS.,</span><span class="font0"> iii. 181-189, i. 25, 68,&nbsp;iii. 623.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROBERT GUISCARD (c. 1015-1085), duke of Apulia and Calabria, sixth of the twelve sons of Tancred de&nbsp;Hauteville, was born at Hauteville near Coutances in&nbsp;Normandy about the year 1015. At an early age he&nbsp;followed into Apulia his three elder brothers William Bras-de-fer, Drogo, and Humphrey, who had established a footing there as military adventurers; and in 1053 he took a&nbsp;prominent part in the battle of Civitella, which resulted in&nbsp;the defeat and captivity of Pope Leo IX. On the death&nbsp;of Humphrey in 1057 Robert, who already had earned&nbsp;the sobriquet of “Guiscard” (“Sagacious” or “Cunning”),&nbsp;succeeded to the chief command of the Norman troops,&nbsp;and, already designated by them duke of Apulia and&nbsp;Calabria, was confirmed in that title in 1059 by Pope&nbsp;Nicholas IL, who at the same time named him gonfalonier&nbsp;of the church. For the next one-and-twenty years he&nbsp;was continually engaged, along with his youngest brother&nbsp;Roger, in warlike operations against the Greeks and&nbsp;Saracens in the south of the Italian peninsula and in&nbsp;Sicily, the principal events being the capture of Bari in&nbsp;1070, that of Palermo in the following year, and that of&nbsp;Salerno in 1077. In 1081 he felt himself strong enough&nbsp;to carry his arms abroad against Alexius Comnenus,&nbsp;ostensibly on behalf of the deposed emperor Michael&nbsp;Ducas, the father-in-law of his daughter. The defeat of&nbsp;Alexius under the walls of Durazzo in October 1081 was&nbsp;followed by the capture of that place in February 1082,</span></p>
