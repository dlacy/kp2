        <p><span class="font1">second point in the new system was the complete and final
                emancipation of the imperial authority from all constitutional limitation and
                control. The last lingering traces&nbsp;of its republican origin disappear. The
                emperors from&nbsp;Diocletian onwards are autocrats in theory as well as
                in&nbsp;practice. The divided powers, the parallel jurisdictions,&nbsp;the defined
                prerogatives of the Augustan system have all&nbsp;vanished. There is but one legal
                authority throughout&nbsp;the empire, that of the emperor himself ; and that
                authority&nbsp;is absolute. This avowed despotism Diocletian, following&nbsp;in the
                steps of Aurelian, hedged round with all the pomp&nbsp;and majesty of Oriental
                monarchy. The final adoption of&nbsp;the title “ dominus,” so often rejected by
                earlier emperors,&nbsp;the diadem on the head, the robes of silk and gold,
                the&nbsp;replacement of the republican salutation of a fellow&nbsp;citizen by the
                adoring prostration even of the highest in&nbsp;rank before their lord and master,
                were all significant&nbsp;marks of tfie new regime.@@<sup>1</sup> In the hands of
                this absolute&nbsp;ruler was placed the entire control of an elaborate
                administrative machinery. Most of the old local and national&nbsp;distinctions,
                privileges, and liberties which had once&nbsp;flourished within the empire had
                already disappeared&nbsp;under the levelling influence of imperial rule, and the
                levelling process was now completed. Roman citizenship had,&nbsp;since the edict of
                Caracalla, ceased to be the privilege of a&nbsp;minority. Diocletian finally reduced
                Italy and Rome to&nbsp;the level of the provinces : the provincial land-tax and
                provincial government were introduced into Italy,@@<sup>2</sup>
                AvhileRome&nbsp;ceased to be even in name the seat of imperial
                    authority.@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>Throughout the whole area of the empire a uniform
                system&nbsp;of administration was established, the control of which&nbsp;was centred
                in the imperial palace, and in the confidential&nbsp;ministers who stood nearest the
                emperor’s person.@@<sup>4</sup> Between the civil and military departments the
                separation&nbsp;was complete. At the head of the former, at least under
                the&nbsp;completed organization of Constantine, were the four
                    prefects,@@<sup>5</sup> next below them the “ vicarii,” who had charge
                of&nbsp;the “ dioceses,” below these again the governors of the separate provinces
                (“ praesides,” “ correctors,” “ consulares”),@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>under each of whom
                was a host of minor officials.&nbsp;Parallel with this civil hierarchy of prefects,
                vicars, præ-sides, and smaller “ officiales ” was the series of
                military&nbsp;officers, from the “magistri militum,” the “duces,” and&nbsp;“comités”
                downwards. But the leading features of both&nbsp;are the same. In both there is the
                utmost possible subordination and division of authority. The subdivision
                of&nbsp;provinces, begun by the emperors of the 2d century, was&nbsp;systematically
                carried out by Diocletian, and either by&nbsp;Diocletian or by Constantine the
                legion was reduced to&nbsp;one-fifth of its former strength.@@<sup>7</sup> Each
                official, civil or&nbsp;military, was placed directly under the orders of a
                superior,&nbsp;and thus a continuous chain of authority connected the&nbsp;emperor
                with the meanest official in his service. Finally,&nbsp;the various grades in these
                two imperial services were care-</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">fully marked by the appropriation to each of distinctive titles, the
                highest being that of “illustris,” which was&nbsp;confined to the prefects and to
                the military magistri and&nbsp;comités, and to the chief
                ministers.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">There can be little doubt that on the whole these reforms prolonged
                the existence of the empire, by creating&nbsp;a machinery which enabled the stronger
                emperors to&nbsp;utilize effectively all its available resources, and
                which&nbsp;even to some extent made good the deficiencies of weaker&nbsp;rulers. But
                in many points they failed to attain their&nbsp;object. Diocletian’s division of the
                imperial authority&nbsp;among colleagues, subject to the general control of
                the&nbsp;senior Augustus, was effectually discredited by the twenty&nbsp;years of
                almost constant conflict which followed his own&nbsp;abdication (305-323).
                Constantine’s partition of the&nbsp;empire among his three sons was not more
                successful in&nbsp;ensuring tranquillity, and in the final division of the
                East&nbsp;and West between Valens and Valentinian (364) the&nbsp;essential principle
                of Diocletian’s scheme, the maintenance of a single central authority, was
                abandoned. The&nbsp;“ tyrants,” the curse of the 3d century, were far
                from&nbsp;unknown in the 4th, and their comparative paucity was&nbsp;due rather to
                the hold which the house of Constantine&nbsp;obtained upon the allegiance of their
                subjects than to the&nbsp;system of Diocletian. This system, moreover, while it
                failed&nbsp;altogether to remove some of the existing evils, aggravated&nbsp;others.
                The already overburdened financial resources of&nbsp;the empire were strained still
                further by the increased&nbsp;expenditure necessitated by the substitution of
                four&nbsp;imperial courts for one, and by the multiplication in every&nbsp;direction
                of paid officials. The gigantic bureaucracy of&nbsp;the 4th century proved, in spite
                of its undoubted services,&nbsp;an intolerable Aveight upon the energies of the
                    empire.@@<sup>9</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Diocletian and Maximian formally abdicated their high office in 305.
                Eighteen years later Constantine, the sole&nbsp;survivor of six rival emperors,
                united the Avhole empire&nbsp;under his oavπ rule. His reign of fourteen years
                Avas&nbsp;marked by two events of first-rate importance,—the recognition of
                Christianity as the religion of the empire,@@<sup>10</sup> and&nbsp;the building of
                the new capital at Byzantium. The&nbsp;alliance Avhich Constantine inaugurated
                betAveen the&nbsp;Christian church and the imperial government, Avhile
                it&nbsp;enlisted on the side of the state one of the most powerful&nbsp;of the neAV
                forces with which it had to reckon, imposed a&nbsp;check, Avhich Avas in time to
                become a powerful one, on the&nbsp;imperial authority. The establishment of the new
                “ City&nbsp;of Constantine ” as a second Rome, Avith a second senate,&nbsp;a prefect
                of tbe city, regiones, and even largesses, did&nbsp;more than proclaim once again
                the deposition of Rome&nbsp;from her old imperial position. It paved the Avay for
                the&nbsp;final separation of East and West by providing the former&nbsp;for the
                first time with a suitable seat of government on&nbsp;the Bosphorus. The death of
                Constantine in 337 Avas&nbsp;folloAved, as the abdication of Diocletian had been, by
                the&nbsp;outbreak of quarrels among rival Cæsars. Of the three&nbsp;sons of
                Constantine Avho in 337 divided the empire&nbsp;between them, Constantine the eldest
                fell in civil Avar&nbsp;against his brother Constans ; Constans himself was,
                ten&nbsp;years afterwards, defeated and slain by Magnentius; and the&nbsp;latter in
                his turn Avas in 353 vanquished by Constantine’s&nbsp;only surviving son
                Constantius. Thus for the second (&nbsp;time the Avhole empire Avas united under the
                rule of a *&nbsp;member of the house of Constantine. But in 355 Con- </span></p>
