Whether or not Surrey was educated from literal childhood with a king’s son, he was certainly educated with the care for literary culture which about that time became common in the households of English noblemen ; and, as the fashion was, he was sent, after passing through Cambridge, to complete his education in Italy. The tradition that he made the tour of Europe as a knight-errant, upholding against all comers the superiority of his mistress Geraldine, has no extrinsic evidence in its favour. If Geraldine was, as is commonly supposed, Elizabeth Fitzgerald, a daughter of the earl of Kildare, she was but a child of seven or eight years when Surrey set out on his travels. The legend about his knight-errantry is probably only a sign of the extent to which his chivalrous personality and poetry fascinated the imagination of his own and the next generation. The eminence of the Howards at Henry’s court was evidenced in many ways : in the festivities at the king’s marriage with Anne of Cleves, Surrey was the leader of one of the sides at the tournament, and two years later his cousin, Catherine Howard, became the king’s fifth wife. Surrey took an active part in the insignificant wars of Henry’s later years, accompanied the expedition, led by his father, which ravaged the south of Scotland in 1542, and held a command in the French expedition of 1544. When the king’s death was known to be near, the duke of Norfolk was suspected of aiming at the throne, and Surrey’s own haughty and ostentatious manners countenanced the suspicion. A month before the king’s death both were arrested and lodged in the Tower, and on 13th January 1547 Surrey was brought to trial for high treason. The main charge against him was that he had “ falsely, maliciously, and treacherously set up and borne the arms of Edward the Confessor.” His plea that the arms belonged to his ancestors was probably not accepted as an extenua</p><p>tion of the offence. A common jury found him guilty, and he was executed on Tower Hill on 19th January.</p><p>His poems, which had been one of the occupations of his crowded life, first appeared in print in <hi rend="italic">Tottel's Miscellany</hi> in 1557. On the title-page of this memorable publication Surrey’s name stood first, but this was probably in deference to his rank ; Wyatt was the first in point of time of Henry’s “courtly makers” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Wyatt). </hi>Surrey,. indeed, expressly acknowledges λVyatt, who was several years his senior, as his master in poetry. Seeing, however, that their poems were first published in the same volume, many years after the death of both, their names can never be disassociated, and it must always be hard to say which was the leader in the various new and beautiful forms of verse which <hi rend="italic">Toltel's Miscellany </hi>introduced into English poetry. Surrey’s only unquestionable distinction as a metrician lies outside the <hi rend="italic">Miscellany</hi> : his translation of the second and fourth books of the <hi rend="italic">Æneid</hi> into blank verse — the first attempt at blank verse in English—was published separately by Tottel in the same year. But his sonnets (in various schemes of verse), his elegy on the death of Wyatt (in elegiac staves shut in by a final couplet), his pastoral poem (a lover’s complaint put into the mouth of a shepherd), and his lyrics in livelier measures are all extremely interesting experiments, and served as models for more than one generation of courtly singers and sonneteers. In form as well as in substance Surrey and his compeers were largely indebted to Italian predecessors ; most of his poems are in fact translations or adaptations of Italian originals. The tone of the love sentiment was new in English poetry, very different in its earnestness, passion, and fantastic extravagance from the lightness, gaiety, and humour of the Chaucerian school. In this respect <hi rend="italic">Tottel’s Miscellany</hi> helped to educate the English muse for the triumphs of the tragic drama. Surrey’s own contributions are distinguished by their copious and impetuous eloquence and sweetness.</p><p>SURROGATE is a deputy of a bishop or an ecclesiastical judge, acting in the absence of his principal, and strictly bound by the authority of the latter. At present the chief duty of a surrogate is the granting of marriage licences. Quite recently judgments of the arches court of Canterbury have been delivered by a surrogate. The office is unknown in Scotland, but is of some importance in the United States. In the State of New York the surrogate’s court is a court of record, with jurisdiction over the administration of the personal estate of a deceased person and certain other matters. In New Jersey the surrogate is an official of the orphans’ court, grants unopposed probates, &amp;c.</p><p>SURVEYING is the art of determining the relative positions of prominent points and other objects on the surface of the ground and making a graphical delineation of the included area. The general principles on which it is conducted are in all instances the same: certain measures are made on the ground and corresponding measures are protracted on paper, on a scale which is fixed at whatever fraction of the natural scale may be most appropriate in each instance. The method of operation varies with the magnitude and importance of the survey, which may embrace a vast empire or be restricted to a small plot of land. All surveys rest primarily on linear measures for direct determinations of distance ; but these are usually largely supplemented by angular measures, to enable distances to be deduced by the principles of geometry which cannot be conveniently measured over the surface of the ground where it is hilly or broken. The nature of a survey depends on the proportion which the linear and the angular measures bear to each other ; it may be purely linear or even purely angular, but is generally a combination of both methods. Thus in India there are numerous instances of large tracts having been surveyed by the purely linear method, in the course of the revenue surveys which were initiated by the native Governments. The operations were conducted by men who had no knowledge of geometry or of any other measuring instrument than the rod or chain, and whose principal object was the determination of fairly</p><p>accurate areas ; their methods sufficed for this purpose and were accepted and perpetuated for many years by the European officers to whom the revenue assessments became entrusted after the subversion of the native rule. In India, too, there are extensive tracts of country which have been surveyed by the purely angular method, either because the ground did not permit of the chain being employed with advantage, as in the Himalayan mountains and hill tracts generally, or because the chain was considered politically objectionable, as in native states where it would have been regarded with suspicion.</p><p>Surveys of any great extent of country were formerly constructed on a basis of points whose positions were fixed astronomically, and in some countries this method of operation is still of necessity adopted. But points whose relative positions have been fixed by a triangulation of moderate accuracy present a more satisfactory and reliable basis ; for astronomical observations are liable, not only to the well-known intrinsic errors which are caused by uncertainties in the catalogued places of the moon and stars, but to external errors arising from deflexions of the plumb line under the influence of local attractions, and these of themselves materially exceed the errors which would be generated in a fairly executed triangulation of a not excessive length, say not exceeding 500 miles. The French Jesuits who made a survey of China for the emperor about 1730 appear to have been the first deliberately to discard</p></body></text></TEI>
