are thoſe ſubſtances which promote putrefaction, chiefly the calcareous earths, magneſia, and teſtaceous powders. From the many curious experiments made by Sir John Pringle to aſcertain the <hi rend="italic">ſeptic</hi> and <hi rend="italic">antiſeptic</hi> virtues of natural bodies, it appears that there are very few ſubſtances of a truly <hi rend="italic">ſeptic</hi> nature. Thoſe commonly reputed ſuch by authors, as the alcaline and volatile ſalts, he found to be no wife <hi rend="italic">ſeptic.</hi> However, he diſcovered ſome, where it ſeemed leaſt likely to find any ſuch quality ; theſe were chalk, common ſalt, and teſtaceous powders. He mixed twenty grains of crabs eyes, prepared with six drams of ox’s gall, and an equal quantity of water. Into another phial he put an equal quantity of gall and water, but no crabs-eyes. Both theſe mixtures being placed in the furnace, the putrefaction began much ſooner, where the powder was, than in the other phial. On making a like experiment with chalk, its <hi rend="italic">ſeptic</hi> virtue was found to be much greater than that of the crabs-eyes : nay, what the doctor had never met with before, in a mixture of two drams of fleſh, with two ounces of water and thirty grains of prepared chalk, the fleſh was reſolved into a perfect mucus in a few days.</p><p>To try whether the teſtaceous powders would alſo diſſolve vegetable ſubſtances, the doctor mixed them with barley and water, and compared this mixture with another of barley and water alone. After a long maceration by a fire, the plain water was found to ſwell the barley, and turn mucilaginous and four ; but that with the powder kept the grain to its natural ſize, and though it ſoftened it, yet made no mucilage, and remained ſweet.</p><p>Nothing could be more unexpected, than to find ſea ſalt a haſtener of putrefaction ; but the fact is thus ; one dram of ſalt preſerves two drams of freſh beef in two ounces of water, above thirty hours uncorrupted, in a heat equal to that of the human body ; or, which is the ſame thing, this quantity of ſalt keeps fleſh ſweet twenty hours longer than pure water ; but then half a dram of ſalt does not preſerve it above two hours longer. Twenty-five grains have little or no antiſeptic virtue, and ten, fifteen, or even twenty grains, manifeſtly both hasten and heighten the corruption. The quantity which had the moſt putrefying quality, was found to be about ten grains to the above proportion of fleſh and water.</p><p>Many inferences might be drawn from this experiment : one is, that ſince ſalt is never taken in aliment beyond the proportion oſ the corrupting quantities, it would appear that it is ſubſervient to digeſtion chiefly by its sep <hi rend="italic">tic</hi> virtue, that is, by softening and resolving meats ; an action very different from what is commonly- believed.</p><p>It is to be obſerved, that the above experiments were made with the ſalt kept for domeſtic uses.
