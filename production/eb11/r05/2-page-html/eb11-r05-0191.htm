<p><span class="font0">as of the Kne of Elimelech and Mahlon (Naomi’s husband and son). In point of fact, a nearer kinsman than Boaz had&nbsp;agreed to purchase the estate (as g0eJ), which Naomi evidently&nbsp;had not yet sold (see commentaries on iv. 3); but he was&nbsp;unwilling to marry Ruth (reading in ver. 5, “and also Ruth thou&nbsp;must buy cf. ver. 10), recognizing that if a son were born the&nbsp;estate would revert to the line of Elimelech, thus leaving him&nbsp;at a disadvantage. He was evidently unprepared for what&nbsp;seems a novel condition (contrast Boaz in iii. 12 seq.), although,&nbsp;from the felicitations in iv. 11-13, the issue of the marriage&nbsp;is actually reckoned to the husband (Boaz). It is improbable&nbsp;that these conflicting features in v. 11-13 and ver. 17a, and&nbsp;all that they involve, co-existed, and it is possible that the&nbsp;former (with the implied reference to the coming David) is&nbsp;not part of the original. However, as in the equally complicated story in Gen. xxxviii., it is difficult to trace the extent&nbsp;or growth of the various motives, e.g. the primary interest in&nbsp;Naomi, the romantic marriage of Ruth, the selling of the land&nbsp;(which comes only in ch. iv.), &amp;c.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUTHENIANS, a name applied to those of the Little Russians who arc Austrian subjects. The name is a form of the word&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Russian.</span><span class="font0"> The Ruthenians were separated from the bulk of&nbsp;Russians by the accident of the two feudal principalities of the&nbsp;old Red Russia, Halid and Volhynia, having fallen to Lithuania,&nbsp;which in turn was united with Poland. At the partition of&nbsp;Poland no one troubled about ethnological boundaries. The&nbsp;language is in substance like the Little Russian of the Ukraine,&nbsp;though it has marked differences; the most interesting dialects&nbsp;are those in the extreme W., which approach to Slovak and&nbsp;that of the Huzuli in Bukovina. The Ruthenians number&nbsp;some three million in Galicia, Bukovina, and in the Carpathians&nbsp;along the edges of Hungary from the 21st meridian eastwards.&nbsp;Throughout Galicia the Poles form the aristocracy, though in&nbsp;two-thirds of it Ruthenians form the bulk of the population,&nbsp;while the middle class is Jewish or German. The Ruthenians&nbsp;are therefore under an alien yoke both politically and economically: in religion they mostly belong to the Uniate Church,&nbsp;acknowledging the Pope but retaining their Slavonic liturgy&nbsp;and most of the outward forms of the Greek Church. Their&nbsp;intellectual centre is Lemberg (Lviv or Lwow), where some&nbsp;lectures in the university are given in their language, and they&nbsp;are agitating for it to have equal rights with Polish. Yet here&nbsp;Little Russian is freer than in the Russian empire, and in Lemberg is the centre of its literature, the society called by the&nbsp;name of Sevdenko, the Little Russian poet. This society&nbsp;publishes voluminous transactions in a special orthography&nbsp;and deals with everything concerning Little Russia, its archaeology, people and language.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUTHENIUM [symbol Ru, atomic weight 101*7 (O = i6)l, in chemistry, a metallic element, found associated with platinum,&nbsp;in platinum ore and in osmiridium. The metal may be obtained&nbsp;from the residues obtained in the separation of osmium from&nbsp;osmiridium. These are washed with ammonium chloride until&nbsp;the filtrate is colourless, ignited, fused with caustic potash and&nbsp;nitre, the melt dissolved in water and nitric acid added to&nbsp;the solution until the colour of potassium ruthenate disappears.&nbsp;A precipitate of ruthenium oxide gradually separates; this is&nbsp;collected and ignited in a graphite crucible and finally fused in&nbsp;the oxyhydrogen furnace (H. Sainte-CIaire Deville and H. J;&nbsp;Debray, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ann. chim. phys.,</span><span class="font0"> 1859, (3), $6, p. 406). For other&nbsp;methods see C.

Pure ruthenium tetroxidc&nbsp;distils over. This is then dissolved in water, reduced by alcohol&nbsp;and ignited in oxygen. Ruthenium in bulk resembles platinum&nbsp;in its general appearance, and has been obtained crystalline&nbsp;by heating an alloy of ruthenium and tin in a current of hydrochloric acid gas. Its specific gravity (after fusion) is 12*063&nbsp;(A. Joly, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Comptes rendus,</span><span class="font0"> 1893, 116, p. 430). It fuses easily in&nbsp;the electric arc. It oxidizes superficially when heated, but&nbsp;fairly rapidly when ignited in an oxidizing blowpipe flame, forming a black smoke of the oxide. It is also oxidized when fused&nbsp;with caustic potash and nitre, forming a ruthenate. Acids&nbsp;have practically no action on the metal, but it is soluble&nbsp;in solutions of the alkaline hypochlorites. Like most of the&nbsp;other metals of the group, it absorbs gases. A colloidal form&nbsp;has been obtained by A. Gutbier and G. Hofmeier </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Jour, prakt.&nbsp;Chem.,</span><span class="font0"> 1905, (2), 71, p. 452) by reducing ruthenium salts with&nbsp;“hydrazine hydrate in the presence of gum-arabic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Several oxides of ruthenium have been described, the definite existence of some of which appears to be doubtful. The dioxide,&nbsp;RuO<sub>2</sub>, is formed by heating sulphate, or by heating the metal&nbsp;in. a current of. oxygen.. It crystallizes in octahedra isomorphous&nbsp;with stannic oxide. It is insoluble in acids and decomposes when&nbsp;heated to a sufficiently high temperature. Fusion with caustic&nbsp;potash, converts it into a mixture of potassium ruthenate and&nbsp;ruthenium sesquioxide, Ru<sub>2</sub>Oa, which is a black, almost insoluble&nbsp;powder. An oxide of composition Ru<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9</sub> is obtained as a black&nbsp;hydrated powder when the peroxide is heated with water for some&nbsp;time. It becomes anhydrous at about 360° C., and is unattacked&nbsp;by acids and alkalis. The peroxide, RuO&lt;, is formed when a solution, of potassium ruthenate is decomposed by chlorine, or by&nbsp;oxidizing ruthenium compounds with potassium chlorate ana&nbsp;hydrochloric acid, or with potassium permanganate and sulphuric&nbsp;acid. It forms a golden yellow crystalline mass, which sublimes&nbsp;slowly in vacuo, and melts at 25-5° C. It blackens on exposure&nbsp;to moisture, and decomposes when exposed to light. It is insoluble in water, but gradually decomposes, forming a hydrated&nbsp;oxide, Ru<sub>2</sub>O<sub>6</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O. It is readily reduced. Its vapour possesses&nbsp;a characteristic smell, somewhat, resembling that of ozone. Ruthenium dichloride, RuC1</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>2</sub>, is obtained (in solution) by reducing the&nbsp;sesquichloride by sulphuretted hydrogen or zinc. It is stable in&nbsp;the cold. The sesquichloride, Ru</span><span class="font0"><sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>6</sub>, is formed when a mixture&nbsp;of chlorine and carbon monoxide is passed over finely divided&nbsp;ruthenium heated to 350° C. (Joly, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Comptes rendus,</span><span class="font0"> 1892, 114,&nbsp;p. 291). It is a brown powder which is readily decomposed by&nbsp;boiling water. It absorbs ammonia readily, forming Ru</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>2</sub>C1<sub>#</sub>*7NH».&nbsp;Numerous double chlorides are known, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> Ru<sub>2</sub>CL*4KCl;&nbsp;Ru<sub>2</sub>Cl«*4NH<sub>4</sub>C1, &amp;c. The pure tetrachloride, RuCU, has not&nbsp;been isolated, but is chiefly known in the form of its double salts,&nbsp;such as potassium ruthenium chloride, K</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>2</sub>RuC1&lt;, which is obtained&nbsp;when finely divided ruthenium is fused with caustic potash and&nbsp;potassium chloride is gradually added to the fused mass (U. Antony&nbsp;and A. Luchesi, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gazz,</span><span class="font0"> 1899, 29, II. p. 82). It is a red-brown&nbsp;crystalline powder, which is soluble in water. A similar ammonium&nbsp;salt has been obtained. Ruthenium sulphides are obtained when&nbsp;the metal is warmed with pyrites and some borax, and the fused&nbsp;mass treated with hydrochloric acid first in the cold and then&nbsp;hot. The insoluble residue contains a mixture of tw’o sulphides,&nbsp;one of which is converted into the sulphate by nitric acid, whilst&nbsp;the other (a crystalline solid) is insoluble in acids. Ruthenium&nbsp;sulphate, RufSO^s, as obtained.by oxidizing the sulphide, is an&nbsp;orange-yellow mass which is deliquescent and dissolves in water,&nbsp;the solution possessing a strongly acid reaction. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rouge de Ruthene,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Ru<sub>2</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>*Clr(NH4)<sub>7</sub>, is obtained from ammonia and ruthenium&nbsp;sesquichloride at 40° C., the product being purified by crystallization from ammonia. It forms small brown lamellae which dissolve slowly in water to give a fuchsin-red solution possessing a&nbsp;violet reflex. The solution possesses a considerable tinctorial&nbsp;power, dyeing silk in the cold. Potassium ruthenium cyanide,&nbsp;K4Ru(CN)e*3H<sub>2</sub>O, formed when potassium ruthenate is boiled with&nbsp;a solution of potassium cyanide, crystallizes in colourless plates&nbsp;which are soluble in water. A ruthenium silicide, RuSi, has been&nbsp;prepared by H.
