<p><span class="font2">ducts are not always used as genital ducts, bdt special coelomic ducts are formed (see Coelom and Serous Membranes) .</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the Dipnoi or mudfish long coiled Miillerian ducts are present, but the testes either pour their secretion directly into&nbsp;the coelom or, as in Protopterus, have ducts which are probably&nbsp;coelomic in origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In both the Teleostomi and Dipnoi the testes and ovaries are paired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">True hermaphroditism is known among fishes, the hag (Myxine) and the sea perch (Serranus) being examples. In&nbsp;many others it occurs as an abnormality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the Amphibia both ovaries and testes are symmetrical. In the snakelike forms which are found in the order Gymno-phiona the testes are a series of separate lobules extending&nbsp;for a long distance, one behind the other, and joined by a&nbsp;connecting duct from which vasa efferentia pass into the Malpighian capsules of the kidneys, and so the sperm is conducted&nbsp;to the mesonephric duct, which acts both as vas deferens and&nbsp;ureter. The Mtillerian ducts or oviducts are long and often&nbsp;coiled in Amphibia, and usually open separately into the cloaca.&nbsp;There is no penis, but in certain forms, especially the Gymno-phiona, the cloaca is protrusible in the male and acts as an&nbsp;intromittent organ. Corpora adiposa or fat bodies are present&nbsp;in all Amphibians, and probably nourish the sexual cells during&nbsp;the hibernating period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Reptilia two testes and ovaries are developed, though they are often asymmetrical in position. In Lizards the yas&nbsp;deferens and ureter open into the cloaca by a common orifice;&nbsp;as they do in the human embryo. In these animals there are&nbsp;two penes, which can be protruded and retracted through the&nbsp;vent; but in the higher reptiles (Chelonia and Crocodilia) there&nbsp;is a single median penis rising from the ventral wall of the&nbsp;cloaca, composed of erectile tissue and deeply grooved on its&nbsp;dorsal surface for the passage of the sperm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In birds the right ovary and oviduct degenerates, and the left alone is functional. In the male the ureter and vas deferens&nbsp;open separately into the cloaca, and in the Ratitae (ostriches)&nbsp;and Anseres (ducks and geese) a well-developed penis is present&nbsp;in the male. In the ostrich this is fibrous, and bifurcated at&nbsp;its base, suggesting the crura penis of higher forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Among the Mammalia the Monotremata (Ornithorhynchus and Echidna) have bird-like affinities. The left ovary is larger&nbsp;than the right, and the oviducts open separately into the cloaca&nbsp;and do not fuse to form a uterus. The testes retain their&nbsp;abdominal position; and the vasa deferentia open into the base&nbsp;of the penis, which lies in a separate sheath in the ventral wall of&nbsp;the cloaca, and shows an advance on that of the reptiles and&nbsp;birds in that the groove is now converted into a complete tunnel.&nbsp;In the female there is a well-developed clitoris, having the same&nbsp;relations as the penis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the marsupials the cloaca is very short, and the vagina and rectum open separately into it. The two uteri open separately&nbsp;and three vaginae are formed,.two lateral and one median. The&nbsp;two lateral join together below to form a single median lower&nbsp;vagina, and it is by means of these that the spermatozoa pass&nbsp;up into* the oviducts. The upper median vagina at first does&nbsp;not open into the lower one, but during parturition a communication is established which in some animals remains&nbsp;permanent (see </span><span class="font0">J. </span><span class="font2">P. Hill, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Proc. Linn. Soc. N.S. Wales,</span><span class="font1"> 1899&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and 1900). This tripartite arrangement of the upper part of the&nbsp;marsupial vagina is of especial interest in connexion with the&nbsp;views of the. embryology of the canal detailed by Berry Hart and&nbsp;already referred to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When, as in marsuf ials, the two uteri open separately into the vagina by two ora, the arrangement is spoken of as uterus duplex.&nbsp;When the two uteri join below and open by one os externum, it&nbsp;is known as uterus bipartitus. When the uterus bifurcates&nbsp;above and has two horns for the reception of the Fallopian&nbsp;tubes (oviducts), but is otherwise single, the term uterus bicornis&nbsp;is given to it, while the single uterus of man and other Primates&nbsp;is called uterus simplex. From the marsupials upward the&nbsp;ovarian'end of the Fallopian tube has the characteristic fimbriated&nbsp;appearance noticed in human anatomy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In some mammals, such as the sow and the cow, the Wolffian duct is persistent in the female and runs along the side of the&nbsp;vagina as the duct of Gärtner. It is possible that the lateral&nbsp;vaginae of the marsupials are of Wolffian origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In marsupials the testes descend into the scrotum, which lies in these animals in front of instead of behind the penis. In some&nbsp;mammals, such as the elephant, they never reach the scrotum at&nbsp;all; while in others, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> many rodents, they can be drawn up&nbsp;into the abdomen or lowered into the scrotum. The subject&nbsp;of the descent of the testicles has been very fully treated by&nbsp;H. Klaatsche, “ Ueber den Descensus testiculorum,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Morph.&nbsp;Jahrb.,</span><span class="font2"> Bd. xvi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The prostate is met with in its most simple forms in marsupials, in which it is a mere thickening of the mucous membrane of the&nbsp;urethra; in the sheep it forms a bilateral elongated mass of&nbsp;gland tissue lying behind the urethra and surrounded by a well-developed layer of striped muscle. In the sloth it is said to be&nbsp;altogether absent, while in many of the insectivores and rodents&nbsp;it consists of many lobes which usually show a bilateral arrangement. The vesiculae seminales are. usually present in the&nbsp;Eutheria or higher mammals, and sometimes, as in the hedgehog, are very large, though they are absent in the Carnivora.&nbsp;Cowper’s glands are usually present and functional throughout&nbsp;life. The uterus rnasculinus is also usually present, but there is&nbsp;grave doubt whether the large organ called by this name in the&nbsp;rabbit should not rather be regarded as homologous with part&nbsp;of the vesiculae seminales. The penis shows many diversities&nbsp;of arrangement; above the marsupials its two crura obtain an&nbsp;attachment to the ischium. In many mammals it is quite hidden&nbsp;by the skin in the flaccid condition, and its external orifice may&nbsp;range from the perineum in the marsupials to the middle of&nbsp;the ventral wall of the abdomen in the ruminants. In the&nbsp;Marsupialia, Rodentia, Chiroptera, Carnivoraandsome Primates&nbsp;an os penis is developed in connexion with the corpora cavernosa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The clitoris is present in all mammals; sometimes, as in the female hyena, it is very large, and at others, as in the lemur,&nbsp;it is perforated by the urethra.</span></p>
