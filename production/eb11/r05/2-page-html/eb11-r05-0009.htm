<p><span class="font0">Rottweil-Altstadt, which lies about { m. to the south, was a Roman colony. It has an old church and a Cistercian&nbsp;nunnery founded in 1221 and dissolved in 1838. Near the town&nbsp;is Wilhelmshall, with saline springs. In the 13th century Rott-weil became a free imperial city and was subsequently the seat&nbsp;of an imperial court of law, the jurisdiction of which extended&nbsp;over Swabia, the Rhineland and Alsace. The functions of&nbsp;this tribunal came to an end in 1784. In 1803 Rottwcil passed&nbsp;into the possession of Württemberg.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROTUMAH (Rotuma, Rotuam or Grenville), an island of the South Pacific Ocean, in 12° 30' S., 177° E., about 300 m. N. by&nbsp;W. of Fiji, of which British colony it is a dependency. Its area&nbsp;is 14 sq. m., and its extreme elevation 800 ft. It is surrounded&nbsp;by coral reefs, and is richly wooded. Several islets lie round it.&nbsp;The population is abojit 2200, the natives being Polynesian,&nbsp;though their language has been classified as Melanesian. They&nbsp;are Wesleyans or Roman Catholics. The chief product is&nbsp;copra. A European commissioner resides. Local laws, subject&nbsp;to approval by the legislative council of Fiji, are promulgated by a regulation board, composed of the commissioner,&nbsp;native chiefs of the seven districts into which the island is&nbsp;divided, and two native magistrates. Rotumah was discovered&nbsp;by Captain Edwards of the “Pandora” in 1791, and was&nbsp;annexed by Great Britain in 1881.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUAULT, JOACHIM (d. 1478), French soldier, was a member of an old family of Poitou. He attached himself to the&nbsp;dauphin (afterwards Louis XI.) and became his premier squire.&nbsp;He followed Louis in his expedition against the Swiss in 1444,&nbsp;distinguished himself in the war against England in 1448, and&nbsp;received the posts of governor of Blaye and Fronsac and constable of Bordeaux. After taking an important part in the&nbsp;battle of Castillon (1453), which resulted in the defeat and&nbsp;death of John Talbot, ist earl of Shrewsbury, he fought against&nbsp;John V., count of Armagnac, in 145s, and in the following year&nbsp;made a fruitless expedition into Scotland. He took part in&nbsp;the campaign in Catalonia, and became marshal of France&nbsp;in 1461, and governor of Paris in 1471. In 1471 and 1472&nbsp;he defended Amiens and Beauvais against the Burgundians.&nbsp;Towards the end of his life he was disgraced by Louis XI., and&nbsp;sentenced to banishment and the confiscation of his property.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROUBAIX, a manufacturing town of northern France, in the department of Nord, 6 m. N.E. of Lille on the railway to Ghent.&nbsp;Pop. (1906) 119,955. Roubaix is situated about a mile from&nbsp;the Belgian frontier on the Roubaix Canal, which connects the&nbsp;lower Deule with the Scheldt by way of the Marcq and the&nbsp;Espierre. Tramways connect the town with Lille and with&nbsp;the neighbouring communes of Tourcoing (pop. 62,694), Croix&nbsp;(pop. 16,292) and Wattrelos (pop. 14,618), with which it unites&nbsp;to form one great industrial centre. The chief business of&nbsp;Roubaix is the woollen manufacture, but cotton, silk and other&nbsp;materials are also produced. The chief of these are fancy and&nbsp;figured stuffs for garments, velvet and upholstering fabrics.&nbsp;Wool-combing and wool-dressing works, spinning-mills, weaving&nbsp;establishments, dye-houses and printing-works occupy some&nbsp;50,000 work-people, and four hundred firms act as commission&nbsp;agents for the sale of raw material and the other requisites&nbsp;for the industry. Power is supplied chiefly by steam, less&nbsp;than 5000 out of 28,000 looms being hand-looms. There are&nbsp;breweries, rubber-works, metal foundries and machinery-works&nbsp;in the town. Tomato and grape growing under glass for the&nbsp;winter market is extensively prosecuted. To maintain the high&nbsp;standard of artistic taste which has made the industry of Roubaix a success, schools have been multiplied. By the co-operation of the town and the state the national school of industrial&nbsp;arts was founded in 1883. This is a small university of art,&nbsp;commerce and industry, the twenty-two courses of which&nbsp;include all the branches of knowledge useful in any of those&nbsp;pursuits. Among the public institutions are the tribunal of&nbsp;commerce and the chamber of commerce, the exchange, a&nbsp;board of trade-arbitration and the establishment </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(bureau de&nbsp;conditionnement)</span><span class="font0"> for determining the nature and weight of silk,&nbsp;wool and cotton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prosperity of Roubaix had its origin in the first factory franchise granted in 1469 by Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy,&nbsp;to Peter, lord of Roubaix, a descendant of the royal house of&nbsp;Brittany. In the 18th century Roubaix suffered from the&nbsp;jealousy of Lille of which it was a dependency, and it was not&nbsp;till the 19th century that its industries acquired real importance.&nbsp;The population, which in 1804 was only 8700, had risen in 1861&nbsp;to 40,000, in 1866 to 65,000, and in 1876 to 83,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUBILIAC (more correctly Roubillac), LOUIS FRANCOIS (1695-1762), French sculptor, was born at Lyons and became a pupil of Balthasar of Dresden and of N. Coustou.&nbsp;It is generally stated that he settled in London about 1720,&nbsp;but as he took the second grand prize for sculpture in 1730,&nbsp;while still a pupil of Coustou, it is unlikely that he visited&nbsp;England at an earlier date. The date 1744, as given by&nbsp;Dussieux, is incorrect. He was at once patronized by Walpole&nbsp;and soon became the most popular sculptor in England, superseding the success of the Fleming Rysbraeck and even of&nbsp;Scheemakers. He died on the nth of January 1762, and&nbsp;was buried in the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields. Roubiliac&nbsp;was largely employed for portrait statues and busts, and&nbsp;especially for sepulchral monuments. His chief works in&nbsp;Westminster Abhey are the monuments of Handel, Admiral&nbsp;Warren, Marshal Wade, Mrs Nightingale and the duke of&nbsp;Argyll, the last of these being the first work which established&nbsp;Roubiliac’s fame as a sculptor. The statues of George I.,&nbsp;Sir Isaac Newton, and the duke of Somerset at Cambridge,&nbsp;and of George II. erected in Golden Square, London, were&nbsp;also his work. Trinity College, Cambridge, possesses a series&nbsp;of busts of distinguished members of the college by him.&nbsp;Roubiliac possessed skill in portraiture and was technically a&nbsp;master, but lived at a time when his art had sunk to a low ebb.&nbsp;His figures are frequently uneasy, devoid of dignity and&nbsp;sculpturesque breadth, and his draperies treated in a manner&nbsp;more suited to painting than sculpture. There are, however,&nbsp;noteworthy exceptions, his bust of Pope, for example, reaching&nbsp;a high standard. More often, however, his striving after&nbsp;dramatic effect detracts from repose of attitude.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His most celebrated work, the Nightingale monument, in Westminster Abbey, a marvel of technical skill, is saved from being ludicrous by its ghastly and even impressive hideousness. On this&nbsp;the dying wife is represented as sinking in the arms.of her husband,&nbsp;who in vain strives to ward off a dart which Death is aiming at her.&nbsp;The lower part of the monument, on which the two portrait figures&nbsp;stand, is shaped like a tomb, out of the opening door of which&nbsp;Death, as a half-veiled skeleton, is bursting forth.. The celebrated&nbsp;bust of Shakespeare, known as the Davenant bust, in the possession&nbsp;of the Garrick Club, London, must be attributed to Roubiliac. The&nbsp;statue of Shakespeare, a commission from David Garrick, and&nbsp;bequeathed by the actor to the English nation, is in the British&nbsp;Museum, and shows the talent of the sculptor in a flattering light.&nbsp;It is noteworthy that none, of his work is recorded in France, the&nbsp;land of his birth and education.</span></p>
