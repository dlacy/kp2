<p><span class="font1">them of his own invention, anil designed theatrical costumes and properties, was versed in mechanics and mechanical devices, and&nbsp;was a very agreeable, companion. For the sake of his work he lived&nbsp;in a most retired fashion, and even when not painting was wont to&nbsp;remain in his working room surrounded by casts. Here he hardly&nbsp;admitted any, even intimate friends, and he kept his modes of work&nbsp;secret, save as regards his assistants. He abounded in pleasant&nbsp;witty sayings whether to great personages or to others, but no smile&nbsp;hovered on his lips. Out of doors his wife made him wear the robe&nbsp;of a Venetian citizen ; if it rained she tried to indue him with an&nbsp;outer garment, but this he resisted. She would also when he left&nbsp;the house wrap up money for him in a handkerchief, and on his&nbsp;return expected an account of it ; Tintoret’s accustomed reply was&nbsp;that he had spent it in alms to the poor or to prisoners. In 1574&nbsp;he obtained the reversion of the first vacant broker’s patent in a&nbsp;fondaco, with power to bequeath it,—an advantage granted from&nbsp;time to time to pre-eminent painters. For his phenomenal energy&nbsp;in painting he was termed “11 Furioso.” An agreement is extant&nbsp;showing that he undertook to finish in two months two historical&nbsp;pictures each containing twenty figures, seven being portraits. The&nbsp;number of his portraits is enormous ; their merit is unequal, but&nbsp;the really fine ones cannot be surpassed. Sebastian del Piombo&nbsp;remarked that Robusti could paint in two days as much as himself&nbsp;in two years ; Annibale Caracci that Tintoret was in many pictures&nbsp;equal to Titian, in others inferior to Tintoret. This was the&nbsp;general opinion of the Venetians, who said that he had three&nbsp;pencils—one of gold, the second of silver, and the third of iron.&nbsp;The only pictures (if we except his own portrait) on which he inscribed his name are the Miracle of Cana in the church of the&nbsp;Salute (painted originally for the brotherhood of the Crociferi), the&nbsp;Miracle of the Slave, and the Crucifixion in the Scuola di S. Rocco ;&nbsp;the last was engraved in 1589 by Agostino Caracci. Generally he&nbsp;painted at once on to the canvas without any preliminary. Some&nbsp;of his dicta on art have been recorded as follows by Ridolfi :—“the&nbsp;art of painting remains increasingly difficult ” ; “painters in youth&nbsp;should adhere to the best masters, these bemg Michelangelo and&nbsp;Titian, and should be strict in representing the natural forms ” ;&nbsp;“the first glance at a picture is the crucial one”; “black and&nbsp;white, as developing form, are the best of colours” ; “drawing is&nbsp;the foundation of a painter’s work, but drawing from life in the&nbsp;nude should only be essayed by well-practised men, as the real is&nbsp;often wanting in beauty.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of pupils Robusti had very few ; his two sons and Martin de Vos of Antwerp were among them. Domenico Robusti (1562-1637),&nbsp;whom we have already had occasion to mention, frequently assisted&nbsp;his father in the groundwork of great pictures. He himself painted&nbsp;a multitude of works, many of them on a very large scale ; they&nbsp;would at best be mediocre, and, coming from the son of Tintoret,&nbsp;are exasperating ; still, he must be regarded as a considerable sort&nbsp;of pictorial practitioner in his way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We conclude by naming a few of the more striking of Tintoret’s very numerous works not already specified in the course of the&nbsp;article. In Venice—(S. Giorgio Maggiore), a series of his later&nbsp;works, the Gathering of the Manna, Last Supper, Descent from&nbsp;the Cross, Resurrection, Martyrdom of St Stephen, Coronation of&nbsp;the Virgin, Martyrdom of St Damian ; (S. Francesco della Vigna)&nbsp;the Entombment ; (the Frari) the Massacre of the Innocents ; (S.&nbsp;Cassiano) a Crucifixion, the figures seen from behind along the&nbsp;hill slope ; (St Mark’s) a mosaic of the Baptism of Christ,—the&nbsp;oil-painting of this composition is in Verona. In Milan (the&nbsp;Brera), St Helena and other saints. In Florence (Pitti Gallery),&nbsp;Venus, Vulcan, and Cupid. In Cologne ( Wallraff-Richarts Museum),&nbsp;Ovid and Corinna. In Augsburg (the town-hall), some historical&nbsp;pictures, which biographers and tourists alike have unaccountably&nbsp;neglected,—one of the siege of a fortified town is astonishingly fine.&nbsp;In England—(Hampton Court), Esther and Ahasuerus, and the&nbsp;Nine Muses ; (the National Gallery) Christ washing Peter’s Feet, a&nbsp;grand piece of colour and execution, not greatly interesting in other&nbsp;respects, also a spirited smallish work, St George and the Dragon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The writer who has done by far the most to establish the fame of Tintoret at the height which it ought to occupy is Professor Ruskin in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stones of Venice&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and other books ; the depth and scope of the master’s power had never before&nbsp;been adequately brought out, although his extraordinarily and somewhat&nbsp;arbitrarily used executive gift was acknowledged. Ridolfi </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Meraviglie dell' Art g&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">gives interesting personal details ; the article by Dr Janitschek in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kunst und&nbsp;Künstler</span><span class="font0"> (1876) is a solid account. For an English reader the most handy&nbsp;narrative is that of Mr W. R. Osler </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Tintoretto,</span><span class="font0"> 1879), in the series entitled “The&nbsp;Great Artists.” Here the biographical facts are clearly presented ; the æsthetic&nbsp;criticism is enthusiastic but not perspicuous.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W.

<p><span class="font2">ROC, or more correctly Rukh, a fabulous bird of enormous size which carries off elephants to feed its young.&nbsp;The legend of the roc, familiar to every one from the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Arabian Nights,</span><span class="font2"> was widely spread in the East; and in&nbsp;later times the home of the monster was sought in the&nbsp;direction of Madagascar, whence gigantic fronds of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Raphia</span><span class="font2"> palm very like a quill in form appear to have&nbsp;been brought under the name of roc’s feathers (see Yule’s</span></p>

Such a feather was brought to the Great Khan, and we&nbsp;read also of a gigantic stump of a roc’s quill being brought&nbsp;to Spain by a merchant from the China seas (Abu Hâmid&nbsp;of Spain, in Damiri, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s.v.).</span><span class="font2"> The roc is hardly different from&nbsp;the Arabian </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>l</sup>anka,</span><span class="font2"> already mentioned under Phcenix ;&nbsp;it is also identified with the Persian </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">simurgh,</span><span class="font2"> the bird&nbsp;which figures in Firdausi’s epic as the foster-father of the&nbsp;hero Zal, father of Rustam. When we go farther back&nbsp;into Persian antiquity we find an immortal bird, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">amru,</span><span class="font2"> or&nbsp;(in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Miηoi-khiradh) siηamru,</span><span class="font2"> which shakes the ripe fruit&nbsp;from the mythical tree that bears the seed of all useful&nbsp;things.

The name of his&nbsp;father was John and that of his mother Franca or Libera.&nbsp;He was born with the mark of a red cross upon his person,&nbsp;and this was at once interpreted as signifying his future&nbsp;eminence. In his twelfth year he began to manifest strict&nbsp;asceticism and great devoutness, and on the death of his&nbsp;parents in his twentieth year he gave all his substance to&nbsp;the poor and joined the Franciscan Tertiaries. Coming to&nbsp;Italy during an epidemic of plague, he was very diligent&nbsp;in tending the sick in the public hospitals at Aquapendente,&nbsp;Cesena, and Rome, and effected many miraculous cures by&nbsp;prayer and simple contact. After similar ministries at&nbsp;Piacenza he himself fell ill, and would have perished as he&nbsp;passed through the forest had not the dog of a certain&nbsp;nobleman daily supplied him with bread. On his return&nbsp;to Montpellier he was arrested as a spy and thrown into&nbsp;prison, where he died, having previously obtained from&nbsp;God this favour, that all plague-stricken persons invoking&nbsp;him should be healed. The date of his death was 16th&nbsp;August 1327, in the thirty-second year of his age. During&nbsp;the sittings of the council of Constance in 1414, when the&nbsp;city was visited with the plague, the efficacy of St Roch’s&nbsp;intercession was “ most manifestly ” experienced. His&nbsp;remains were removed in 1385 to Venice, where they now&nbsp;lie. He is commemorated, chiefly in Italy and France, as&nbsp;the patron of the sick, and especially of the plague-stricken.</span></p>
