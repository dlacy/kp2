<p><span class="font0">grows to the height of about a yard ; the branches are numerous, produced irregularly, and covered with a&nbsp;purpliſh bark. The leaves are oval, ſpear-ſhaped, ſmall,&nbsp;and in the under ſurface of the colour of iron. The&nbsp;flowers are produced at the end of the branches in&nbsp;bunches, are of a wheel-ſhaped figure, pretty large, of a&nbsp;fine crimſon colour, and handſome appearance. They&nbsp;appear in June, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules containing ripe feeds in September. 4. The Dauricum, or&nbsp;Daurian dwarf roſe-bay, is a low deciduous ſhrub,&nbsp;and native of Dauria. Its branches are numerous, and&nbsp;covered with a browniſh bark. The flowers are wheel-ſhaped, large, and of a beautiful roſe-colour : they appear in May, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules full of&nbsp;feeds, which in England do not always ripen. 5. The&nbsp;maximum, or American mountain laurel, is an evergreen ſhrub, and native of Virginia, where it grows naturally on the higheſt mountains, and on the edges of&nbsp;cliffs, precipices, &amp;c. where it reaches the ſize of a moderate tree, though with us it ſeldom riſes higher than&nbsp;fix feet. The fl0wer3 continue by ſucceſſion ſometimes&nbsp;more than two months, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules full of feeds. 6. The Ponticum, or Pontic dwarf&nbsp;roſe-bay, is an evergreen ſhrub, native of the eaſt, and&nbsp;of moſt ſhady places near Gibraltar. It grows to the&nbsp;height of four or five feet. The leaves are ſpear-ſhaped,&nbsp;gloſſy on both ſides, acute, and placed on ſhort foot-ſtalks on the branches : the flowers, which are produced&nbsp;in cluſters, are bell-ſhaped, and of a fine purple colour.&nbsp;They appear in July, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules containing ſeeds, which in England ſeldom attain&nbsp;to maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Siberia, a ſpecies of this plant is uſed with great ſucceſs in gouty and rheumatic affections ; of which the&nbsp;following account is given in the 5th volume of the Medical Commentaries, p. 434. in a letter from Dr Guthrie of Peterſhurgh to Dr Duncan of Edinburgh. “ It&nbsp;is the rhododendrum chryſanthemum, nova ſpecies, belonging to the claſs of decandria, diſcovered by Profeſ-ſor Pallas in his tour through Siberia. This Alpine&nbsp;ſhrub grows near the tops of the high mountains named&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sajanes,</span><span class="font0"> in the neighbourhood of the river Jeniſe in Siberia ; and delights in the ſkirts of the ſnow-covered&nbsp;ſummits, above the region that produces trees. When&nbsp;the inhabitants of that country mean to exhibit it in&nbsp;arthritic or rheumatic diſorders, they take about two&nbsp;drams of the dried ſhrub, ſtalk and leaves, with nine or&nbsp;ten ounces of boiling water, and putting them into an&nbsp;earthen pot, they lute on the head, and place them in&nbsp;an oven during the night. This infuſion (for it is not&nbsp;allowed to boil) the lick man drinks next morning&nbsp;for a doſe. It occaſions heat, together with a degree&nbsp;of intoxication, reſembling the effects of ſpirituous liquors, and a ſingular kind of uneaſy ſenſation in the&nbsp;parts affected, accompanied with a ſort of vermiculatio,&nbsp;which is likewiſe confined to the diſeaſed parts. The&nbsp;patient is not permitted to quench the thirl! which this&nbsp;medicine occaſions ; as fluids, particularly cold water,&nbsp;produce vomiting, which leſſens the power of the ſpe-cific. In a few hours, however, all the diſagreeable&nbsp;effects of the doſe diſappear, commonly with two or&nbsp;three ſtools. The patient then finds himſelf greatly relieved of his diſorder ; and has ſeldom occaſion to repeat&nbsp;the medicine above two or three times to complete a&nbsp;cure. The inhabitants of Siberia call this ſhrub </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chei</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tea,</span><span class="font0"> from their drinking, in common, a weak infuſion of&nbsp;it, as we do the Chineſe plant of that name. This&nbsp;practice ſhows that the plant, uſed in ſmall quantities,&nbsp;muſt be innocent. Profeſſor Pallas informs me, that he&nbsp;ſent ſome time ago ſome of this ſhrub dried to Profeſſor&nbsp;Koelpin at Stetin ; and he ſhowed me a letter from&nbsp;that gentleman, where he ſays, that he has given It&nbsp;with ſucceſs in ſeveral caſes, particularly in what he&nbsp;calls the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">arthritica venerea,</span><span class="font0"> with a tophus arthriticus on&nbsp;the carpus, and it produced a complete cure. It muſt&nbsp;be remarked, that the doſe which theſe hardy Siberians take, who are alſo in the habit of drinking it.&nbsp;as tea, would, in all probability, be too ſtrong for our&nbsp;countrymen ; however, it is a medicine which we&nbsp;may certainly give with ſafety, beginning with ſmall&nbsp;doſes.”</span></p>
