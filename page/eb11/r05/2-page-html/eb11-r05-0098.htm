<p><span class="font0">The poems of Runeberg show the influence of the Greeks and of Goethe upon his mind; but he possesses a great&nbsp;originality. It is hardly possible to over-estimate the value&nbsp;of his patriotic poems as a link between the Swedish and&nbsp;Finnish nations. He has remained one of the most popular&nbsp;Swedish poets, although his whole life was spent in Finland.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUNES, RUNIC LANGUAGE AND INSCRIPTIONS. The art of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">writing with an alphabet appears to have been introduced into Germanic Europe in the Iron Age. Something hieratic and&nbsp;mysterious was involved in the idea of letters as used to convey&nbsp;thought, and from the earliest recorded times they were called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">runes,</span><span class="font0"> from the Gothic </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">runa (rfin,</span><span class="font0"> in Icelandic), which originally&nbsp;means a secret thing, a mystery, and was later used to describe&nbsp;a letter of the ancient language (see Alphabet and Scandinavian Languages). The Iron Age is supposed to have&nbsp;existed from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">circa</span><span class="font0"> 200 to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">circa</span><span class="font0"> 650, and it is to the close of&nbsp;this epoch that the beginning of the writing on Scandinavian&nbsp;memorials is attributed. There are runes which have been discovered in England, and some also on the Germanic mainland&nbsp;of Europe, but it is in the Scandinavian peninsula that the vast&nbsp;majority of inscribed monuments have been discovered. The&nbsp;custom of erecting runic monuments, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> stones engraved with&nbsp;more or less literary statements, over the bodies of the dead,&nbsp;was practised first, there can be no doubt, in Norway and Sweden,&nbsp;then spread to Denmark and over the whole North of Europe.&nbsp;It is remarkable, however, that two of the three runic alphabets&nbsp;from which our knowledge of the whole range of rune-literature&nbsp;is founded, were discovered outside Scandinavia. These three&nbsp;alphabets exist, the first on a thin gold </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bractea</span><span class="font0"> found in 1774 at&nbsp;Vadstena, in Sweden; the second on a bracelet, dug up at&nbsp;Chamoy, in Burgundy; the third on a knife, found in the&nbsp;Thames in 1857, and now in the British Museum. There are&nbsp;two principal runic alphabets, the older consisting of 24 letters,&nbsp;and beginning with f; the later of 16 letters. During the last&nbsp;century before the introduction of Christianity, the larger&nbsp;alphabet was increased by 3 letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The oldest runes which have been examined are those found on the Thorsbjerg Shield-buckle, which is at present in the Kiel&nbsp;Museum; here the writing, which runs from right to left in&nbsp;straight lines, is of the fourth or fifth century. Other invaluable&nbsp;sources of runic knowledge are the diadem of Straarur, the&nbsp;Vimose comb and the brooch of Himlingoje, which was found&nbsp;in the Vier Fen. Still greater importance has the Golden&nbsp;Hom, discovered at Gellehuus, near Tondern, in 1734; this&nbsp;monument was stolen by thieves and melted down, but fortunately not until a careful copy of it had been made, which is&nbsp;now in the Museum at Copenhagen. It is not until the 6th&nbsp;century that the runic stones begin. The most ancient are&nbsp;believed to be those of Einang, of Tune, of Strand, of Varnum,&nbsp;of Tanum and of Berga. Perhaps a little later are the stones&nbsp;at Vaanga, Skarkind, Skaaang, Torvik, Bo and others, too&nbsp;numerous to mention, but all, as seems likely, erected between&nbsp;550 and 600. On the famous Tune-stone, the name of the&nbsp;author of the inscription is preserved, “I Wiwar made these I&nbsp;runes,” and this is not an isolated instance. The original&nbsp;direction of the runic writing was from left to right, like Latin,&nbsp;but quite early the reverse method was introduced. A union&nbsp;of these forms produced more complicated systems, in which&nbsp;much was left to the individual taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the earliest times uninscribed memorial stones in Scandinavia, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bautasteinar</span><span class="font0">, were raised to preserve the memory&nbsp;of the dead, and these certainly partook of a more or less religious&nbsp;and sacrificial character. It is evident that, during the Iron&nbsp;Age, stones continued to be erected which had no inscriptions,&nbsp;after the runic alphabets had been invented, and that at first&nbsp;the runes were added only in cases of great importance or&nbsp;solemnity. These runic stones were as a rule posed on the top&nbsp;of the grave, or by the side of it, on mounds, of which only one&nbsp;example survives, that of the stone of Einang, in Norway. But&nbsp;runic stones were not infrequently placed in the grave itself.&nbsp;These were smaller than those erected outside the grave, and&nbsp;they did not lend themselves to lengthy or elaborate inscriptions. The majority of graves containing such small rune-stones, bearing merely the name of the deceased or a magical&nbsp;sentence, have been found in Norway. But the antiquity of&nbsp;most of these is questioned, that of Vatn, which is the oldest,&nbsp;being now placed no earlier than the 8th century. The very&nbsp;important stone of Valdby, which is the oldest Norwegian&nbsp;monument employing the shorter alphabet, is attributed by&nbsp;Wimmer to heathen times, indeed, but to a date no earlier&nbsp;than the second half of the 9th century. It is supposed that&nbsp;the most ancient of the runic stones of Sweden, those respectively of V&amp;nga, Skarkind and Kinncvad, must have come&nbsp;from the interior of graves, but there is no certain proof of this.&nbsp;The latest criticism tends to the belief that when runes were&nbsp;first inscribed on Scandinavian monuments, they were^placed&nbsp;both upon and inside graves, but that after the runic letters&nbsp;had been used for about a century, the latter custom tended to&nbsp;exclude the former. About the year 800 both customs began&nbsp;to invade Denmark, the practice of placing the rune-stones&nbsp;inside, however, soon getting the upper hand. It is a curious&nbsp;fact that in Iceland not a single rune-stone which can be referred back to heathen times is known to exist; the Icelandic&nbsp;rune-stones all date from a period well advanced in the middle&nbsp;ages. It was the old theory that the ancient stones had&nbsp;mouldered away under stress of weather, but that is abandoned,&nbsp;and it is now supposed that the aristocratic exiles from Norway,&nbsp;who settled in Iceland, had not yet adopted in their old home&nbsp;the practice of inscribed monuments to their dead. There&nbsp;were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bautasteinar</span><span class="font0"> in Iceland, as we know, but there is no evidence&nbsp;that these bore runes upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is in Denmark that the runic inscriptions exist which possess the highest literary interest. These are all attributed to the beginning of the 9th century. The Kallerup Stone was&nbsp;discovered in 1826 at the village of Hojetostrup, a Danish mile&nbsp;E. of Roskilde; it has been lifted and placed in its original&nbsp;position. This monument contains a statement in old Danish,&nbsp;to the effect that it marks the grave of Hornhora, son of Swidi.&nbsp;The Stone of Snoldelev was discovered in 1768, not far from&nbsp;the spot where the Kallerup Stone was found; it is now in the&nbsp;Archaeological Museum at Copenhagen; this has a long and&nbsp;important inscription in a form of old Scandinavian, allied to&nbsp;the classical Icelandic. The Stone of Helnaes was found on the&nbsp;islet of that name in i860, and is now at Copenhagen. The&nbsp;other most famous runic monuments are those of Flemlose,&nbsp;Orja, Norrenaer&amp;, Glarendrup, Fryggcvaelde and Ronninge,&nbsp;of all of which Wimmer has published full analytical descriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These inscriptions are of remarkable value as historical documents, from a period of which no other definite records&nbsp;remain in existence. From a literary point of view, they represent what Germanic language was up to the point at which&nbsp;Ulfilas created a new alphabet for his version of the Bible,&nbsp;by adapting to the runic alphabets a number of Greek letters.&nbsp;It was an error, now exploded, to suppose that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">notae im-pressae,</span><span class="font0"> which Tacitus describes in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Germania,</span><span class="font0"> were &quot;written&nbsp;runes; these were simply signs, or mystic marks, which had no&nbsp;linguistic significance. These are described in the staves of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Edda</span><span class="font0"> as having been revealed to mankind by the god Odin,</span></p>
