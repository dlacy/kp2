in zoology, a genus of infects belonging to the order of aptera. The feet are very numerous, being as many on each ſide as there arc joints in the body; the antennæ are ſetaceous: there are two jointed pappi, and the body is depreſſed. —Theſe infects are very formidable and noxious in the warm countries, where they grow to the length of a quarter of a yard or more, though in this climate they ſeldom grow above an inch long. The ſcolopendra is alſo called the <hi rend="italic">centipes</hi> from its number of feet. In the Eaſt Indies it grows to ſix inches in length, and as thick as a man’s finger: it conſiſts of many joints; and from each joint proceeds a leg on each ſide: they are covered with hair, and ſeem to have no eyes; but there are two feelers on the head, with which they find out the way they are to paſs: the head is very round, with two ſmall ſharp teeth, with which they inflict wounds that are very painful and dangerous. A ſailor that was bit by one on board a ſhip felt exceſſive pain, and his life was ſuppoſed to be in danger; but by the application of roaſted onions to the part he recovered. The bite of the ſcolopendra <hi rend="italic">morsitans</hi><note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">§ See Plate CCCCXLV.</hi></p></note> <hi rend="italic">§</hi> in Jamaica is ſaid to be as poiſonous as the ſting of a ſcorpion. — Some of the ſpecies live in holes in the earth: others under ſtones, and among rotten wood; ſo that the removing of theſe is exceedingly dangerous in the countries where the ſcolopendrae breed. —Theſe infects, like the ſcorpion, are ſuppoſed to be produced perfect from the parent or the egg, and to undergo no changes after their firſt excluſion. They are found of all ſizes; which is a ſufficient reaſon for believing that they preſerve their firſt appearance through the whole of their exiſtence. It is probable, however, that, like moſt of this claſs, they often change their ſkins; but of this we have no certain information. The ſcolopendra for- ſicata is the largeſt in this country, of a dun colour, ſmooth, and compoſed of nine ſcaly ſegments, without reckoning the head. The feet are 15 in number on each fide, and the laſt longer than the reſt, and turned backwards, form a kind of forky tail. The antennæ are twice the length of the head, and conſiſt of 42 ſhort ſegments. The inſect’s progreſſive motion is very quick, and ſometimes ſerpentine. It is found under ſtones on the ground, under flower-pots and garden boxes.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
