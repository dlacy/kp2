(c. 1184-1292). MuṢliḤ-uddĪn, or more correctly Musharrif-uddĪn b. MuṢliḤ-uddĪn, the greatest didactic poet and the most popular writer of Persia, was born about 1184 (a.h. 580) in Shiraz. After the premature death of his father he was taken under the protection of Sa'd b. Zengî, the atābeg of Fars, who sent him to pursue his studies in the famous medresseh of Baghdad, the Nizämiyya, where he remained about thirty years (1196-1224). About 1210 (a.ii. 606) his literary fame had spread as far as Kashgar in Turkistan, which the young poet (who in honour of his patron had assumed the name of Sa’dī) visited in his twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh year. After mastering alI the dogmatic disciplines of the Islamitic faith he turned his attention first to practical philosophy, and later on to the more ideal tenets of Sufic pantheism, under the spiritual guidance of the famous sheikh Shihāb-uddīn Umar Suhrawardī (died 1234; a.h. 632). Between 1220 and 1225 he paid a visit to a friend in Isfahan, went from there to Damascus, and returned to Isfahan just at the time of the inroads of the Mongols, when the atãbeg Sa'd had been deposed by the victorious Khwarizm ruler of Ghiyāss-uddīn (1226). Sadly grieved by the misfortune of his patron and disgusted with the miserable condition of Persia, Sa'dī quitted Shīrāz and entered upon the second period of his life—that of his wanderings (1226-1256). He proceeded via Balkh, Ghazni and the Punjab to Gujarāt, on the western coast of which he visited the famous shrine of Siva in Somnath. After a prolonged stay in Delhi, where he learnt Hindūstānī, he sailed for Yemen. Overcome with grief at the loss of a beloved child (when he had married is not known), he undertook an expedition into Abyssinia and a pilgrimage to Mecca and Medina. Thence he directed his steps towards Syria and lived as a renowned sheikh for a considerable time in Damascus, which he had once already visited. There and in Baalbek he added to his literary renown that of a first-rate pulpit orator. Specimens of his spiritual addresses are preserved in the five homilies (on the fugitiveness of human life, on faith and fear of God, on love towards God, on rest in God and on the search for God). At last, weary of Damascus, he withdrew into the desert near Jerusalem and led a solitary wandering life, till one day he was taken captive by a troop of Frankish soldiers, brought to Tripoli, and condemned to forced labour in the trenches of the fortress. After enduring countless hardships, he was eventually rescued by a rich friend in Aleppo, who paid his ransom, and gave him his daughter in marriage. But Sa'dī, unable to live with his quarrelsome wife, set out on fresh travels, first to North Africa and then through the length and breadth of Asia Minor and the adjoining countries. Not until he had passed his seventieth year did he return to Shiraz (about 1256; A.H. 653). Finding the place of his birth tranquil and prosperous under the wise rule of Abūbakr b. Sa’d, the son of his old patron (1226-1260; a.h. 623-658), the aged poet took up his permanent abode, interrupted only by repeated pilgrimages to Mecca, and devoted the remainder of his life to Sūfic con-templation and poetical composition. He died at Shïrãz in 1292 (a.h. 691) according to Hamdallãh Mustaufī (who wrote only forty years later), or in December 1291 (a.h. 690), at the age of 110 lunar years.</p><p>The experience çf the world gained during his travels, his intimate acquaintance with the various countries he had visited, his insight into human character, together with an inborn loftiness of thought and the purest moral standard, made it easy for Sa'di to compose in the short space of three years his two masterpieces, which have immortalized his name, the <hi rend="italic">Büslän</hi> or “ Fruit-garden ” (1257) and the <hi rend="italic">Gulistãn</hi> or “Rose-garden” (1258), both dedicated to the reigning atãbeg Abü Bekr. The former, also called <hi rend="italic">Sa'dinãma,</hi> is a kind of didactic epopee in ten chapters and double-rhymed verses, which passes in review the highest philosophical and religious questions, not seldom in the very spirit of Christianity, and abounds with sound ethical maxims and matchless gems of transcendental speculation. The latter is a prose work of a similar tendency in eight chapters, interspersed with numerous verses and illustrated, like the <hi rend="italic">Būstān,</hi> by a rich store of clever tales and charming anecdotes; it discusses more or less the same topics as the larger work, but has acquired a much greater popularity in both the East and the West, owing to its easier and more varied style, its attractive</p><pb xml:id="eb11-23-s01-0993" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_1056.jp2"/>

Other minor works are the Arabic <hi rend="italic">qaṣīdas,</hi> the first of which laments the destruction of the Arabian caliphate by the Mongols in 1258 (a.h. 656); the Persian <hi rend="italic">qaṣīdas,</hi> partly panegyrical, partly didactical; the <hi rend="italic">marathi,</hi> or elegies, beginning with one on the death of Abū Bekr and ending with one on the defeat and demise of the last caliph, Mosta'sim; the <hi rend="italic">mulamma' ät,</hi> or poems with alternate Persian and Arabic verses, of a rather artificial character; the <hi rend="italic">tarjī'āt,</hi> or refrain-poems; the <hi rend="italic">ghazals,</hi> or odes; the ṣā <hi rend="italic">hibiyyah</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mukatta'ät,</hi> or moral aphorisms and epigrams; the <hi rend="italic">rubā'iyyāl,</hi> or quatrains; and the <hi rend="italic">mufradät,</hi> or distichs. Sa’dī’s lyrical poems possess neither the easy grace and melodious charm of Ḥāfız’s songs nor the overpowering grandeur of Jelãlud-dïn Rūmī'sum divine hymns, but they are nevertheless full of deep pathos and show such a fearless love of truth as is seldom met with in Eastern poetry. Even his panegyrics, although addressed in turn to almost all the rulers who in those days of continually changing dynasties presided over the fate of Persia, are free from that cringing servility so common in the effusions of Oriental encomiasts.</p><p>The first who collected and arranged his works was 'Alī b. Ahmad b. Bīsutūn (1326-1334; A.H. 726-734). The most exact information about Sa'di’s life and works is found in the introduction to Dr W. Bacher’s <hi rend="italic">Sa'dī's Aphorismen und Sinngedichte (Sāhibiyyah)</hi> (Strass-burg, 1879; a complete metrical translation of the epigrammatic poems), and in the same author’s “ Sa'dī Studien," in <hi rend="italic">Zeitschrift der morgenländischen Gesellschaft,</hi> xxx. pp. 81-106; see also H.

Browne, <hi rend="italic">Literary History of Persia,</hi> pp. 525-539. Sa’di’s <hi rend="italic">Kulliyyät</hi> or complete works have been edited by Harrington (Calcutta, 1791—1795) (with an English translation of some of the prose treatises and of Daulat Shah’s notice on the poet, of which a German version is found in Graf’s <hi rend="italic">Rosengarten</hi> (Leipzig, 1846, p. 229 sq.) ; for the numerous lithographed editions, see Rieu's <hi rend="italic">Pers.
