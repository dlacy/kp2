In consequence of Mr Glass’s expulsion, his adherents formed themselves into churches, conformable in their institution and discipline to what they considered to be the plan of the first churches, as recorded in the New Testament. Soon after the year 1755, Mr Robert Sandeman, an elder in one of these churches in Scotland, published a series of letters addressed to Mr Hervey, occasioned by his Theron and Aspasio, in which he endeavours to show that his notion of faith is contradictory to the Scripture account of it, and could only serve to lead men, professedly holding the doctrines commonly called Calvinistic, to establish their own righteousness upon their inward feelings and various acts of faith. In these letters Mr Sandeman attempts to prove that faith is neither more nor less than a simple assent to the divine testimony concerning Jesus Christ, recorded in the New Testament ; and he maintains, that the word faith, or belief, is constantly used by the apostles to signify what is denoted by it in common discourse, namely, a persuasion of the truth of any proposition, and that there is no difference between believing any common testimony and believing the apostolic testimony, except that which results from the nature of the testimony itself. This led the way to a controversy among those who were called Calvinists, concerning the nature of justifying faith ; and those who adopted Mr Sandeman’s notion of it, and who took the denomination of <hi rend="italic">Sandemanians,</hi> formed themselves into a church order, in strict fellowship with the churches in Scotland, but holding no kind of communion with other churches. The chief opinions and practices in which this sect differs from other Christians are, their weekly administration of the Lord’s Supper ; their love-feasts, of which every member is not only allowed but required to partake, and which consists in their dining together in the interval between the morning and afternoon service ; their kiss of charity used on this occasion, at the admission of a new member, and at other times when they deem it to be necessary or proper ; their weekly collection before the Lord’s Supper for the support of the poor, and defraying other expenses ; mutual exhortation ; abstinence from blood and from things strangled ; washing each other’s feet, the precept concerning which, as well as other precepts, they understand literally ; community of goods, in so far as that every one is to consider all that he has in his possession and power as liable to the calls of the poor and church ; and the unlawfulness of laying up treasures on earth, by setting them apart for any distant, future, and uncertain use. They allow of public and private diversions, so far as they are not connected with circumstances really sinful ; but apprehending a lot to be sacred, they disapprove of playing at cards, dice, and the like. They maintain a plurality of elders, pastors, or bishops, in each church ; and the necessity of the presence of two elders in every act of discipline, and at the administration of the Lord’s Supper. In the choice of these elders, want of learning and engagements in trade are not a sufficient objection ; but second marriages disqualify for the office ; and they are ordained by prayer and fasting, imposition of hands, and giving the right hand of fellowship. In their discipline they follow strictly what they consider to be the rules of Scripture, and think themselves obliged to separate from the communion and worship of all such religious societies as appear to them not to profess the simple truth for their only ground of hope, and who do not walk in obedience to it.</p><p>SANDING <hi rend="smallcaps">Isles, Pulo Sanding</hi>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sandiang,</hi> two small islands, which are both inhabited, and are situated off the south-west coast of Sumatra, near the south-eastern extremity of the Nassau or Poggy Isles, in which group they are sometimes included. They produce the wild nutmeg and some good timber.</p><p>SANDOMIR, one of the provinces into which the kingdom of Poland is divided. It extends in north latitude from 50° 25' to 51° 52', and in east longitude from 19° 43' to 21° 52', consisting of 5590 square miles; and it contains 378,000 inhabitants, mostly adhering to the Catholic church, except the Jews, who form the majority in the towns. It is a level district, situated on the left bank of the Vistula, and bears the best white wheat, which brings the highest price in the markets of Dantzig or of Odessa, to both of which it is sent, as the prices are most favourable. This province provides iron from its mines to the rest of the kingdom. It is divided into four circles, and the capital is Radom.</p><p>SANDPU, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sanpoo,</hi> the vulgar name of a river in the East Indies, which is one of the largest in the world. It is better known by that of <hi rend="italic">Brahmaputra,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Burrampooter,</hi> to which the reader is referred.</p><p>SANDWICH, a town of the county of Kent, in the hundred of Eastry, and lathe of St Augustine, sixty-eight miles from London. It is situated on the river Stour, two miles from its entrance into the sea. It was once accessible by ships, but the sand has nearly choked the passage, though some plans are at present in contemplation to improve it. It is one of the Cinque Ports, and as such, is governed by a corporation composed of a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors, who have jurisdiction over Deal, Fordwich, Ramsgate, Reculver, Sarre, Stower, and Walmer. It was once fortified, and a portion of its walls is still standing. Sandown Castle, a strong fortress within the parish, commands the anchorage of the Downs. It is rather a decayed town, but has a market on Wednesday and Saturday. There are three established churches, and also places of worship for dissenters. It returns two members to parliament, and confers on the family of Montague the title of earl. The population amounted in 1821 to 2912, and in 1831 to 3136.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sandwich,</hi> an island in the Eastern Seas, opposite to the island of New Ireland. It is covered with trees, and its general appearance is picturesque and pleasing. Long, of the most westerly point 50. 54. 15. E. Lat. 2. 59. 26. S.</p><p>SANDWICH <hi rend="smallcaps">IslandS.</hi> These islands, which are situated in the Pacific Ocean, are eleven in number. They were discovered by Captain Cook and Captain King in the year 1778, and have been subsequently visited by Vancouver, Meares, Turnbull, and various other navigators. These islands received their name from the Earl of Sandwich, during whose administration they were discovered. In their climate they resemble the West India islands, which lie in the same latitude, although, on the whole, the temperature is more moderate ; nor are they subject to the dreadful hurricanes which desolate the West India Islands. The thermometer during the day never rises higher than 88°, but its mean height at noon is about 83°. There is a constant land and sea breeze every night. The vegetable productions differ little from those in the rest of the South Sea islands. The bread-fruit thrives, the sugar-canes are of unusual size, and large vegetable roots are produced, shaped like a yam, and from six to eight pounds in weight, which yield a juice that was found to be an excellent substitute for sugar. These islands are evidently peopled by the same race which is found in the islands of New Zealand, the Society and Friendly Islands, and the Marquesas ; a race that possesses, without any intermixture, all the known lands between the latitudes of 47° south and 20° north, and between the longitudes of 184° and 260° east. The natives are in general above the middle size, graceful in all their movements, and capable of bearing great fatigue. They are of a much darker complexion than the Otaheitans, and are altogether an inferior people, though many have fine open countenances, and a number of the women have a sweetness and sensibility which renders them very engaging. They are distinguished from Europeans by one pecu-</p></body></text></TEI>
