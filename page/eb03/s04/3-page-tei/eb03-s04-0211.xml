            <p>Thoſe gentlemen obſerved the expanſion of water to be very anomalous between 32⁰ and
                45⁰. This is diſtinctly ſeen during the gradual cooling of water to the point of
                freezing. It contracts for a while, and then ſuddenly expands. But we ſeldom have
                occaſion to meaſure ſpecific gravities in ſuch temperature.</p>
            <p>The reader is now sufficiently acquainted with the principles of this hydrostatical
                method of determining the ſpecific gravity of bodies, and can judge of the propriety
                of the forms which may be propoſed for the experiment.</p>
            <p>The ſpecific gravity of a fluid may be determined either by filling with it a veſſel
                with a narrow neck, or by weighing a ſolid body that is immerſed in it. It is hard
                to ſay which is the beſt way. The laſt is not ſubject to any error in filling,
                becauſe we may ſuſpend the ſolid by a fine wire, which will not diſplace any
                ſenſible quantity of the fluid ; and if the ſolid is but a little heavier than the
                fluid, the balance being loaded only with the exceſs, will be very ſenſible to the
                ſmalleſt want of equilibrium. But this advantage is perhaps compenſated by an
                obstruction to the motion of the ſolid up or down in the fluid, ariſing from
                viscidity. When the weight in the oppoſite ſcale is yet too ſmall, we ſlowly add
                more, and at laſt grain by grain, which gradually brings the beam to the level. When
                it is exactly level, the weight in the ſcale is ſomewhat too great; for it not only
                balances the preponderance of the ſolid, but alſo this viſcidity of the fluid. But
                we may get rid of this error. Add a ſmall quantity more ; this will bring the beam
                over to the other side. Now put as much into the ſcale on the ſame side with the
                ſolid ; this will not reſtore the beam to its level. We muſt add more till this be
                accompliſhed ; and this addition is the meaſure of the viſeidity of the fluid, and
                muſt be ſubtracted from the weight that was in the other ſcale when the beam came
                first to a level. This effect of viſcidity is not inſenſible, with nice apparatus,
                even in the pureſt water, and in many fluids it is very conſiderable—and, what is
                worſe, it is very changeable. It is greatly diminiſhed by heat ; and this is an
                additional reaſon for making thoſe trials in pretty warm temperatures. But for
                fluids of which the viſcidity is conſiderable, this method is by no means proper ;
                and we muſt take the</p>
            <p>other, and weigh them in a veſſel with a narrow neck. Mercury muſt alſo be treated in
                this way, becauſe we have no ſolid that will sink in it but gold and platina.</p>
            <p>It is not ſo eaſy as one would imagine to fill a veſſel preciſely to the ſame degree
                upon every trial. But if we do not operate on too ſmall quantities, the unavoidable
                error may be made altogether inſignificant, by having the neck of the veſſel very
                ſmall. If the veſſel hold a pound of water, and the neck do not exceed a quarter of
                an inch (and it will not greatly retard the operation to have it half this ſize),
                the examinator muſt be very careleſs indeed to err one part in two thouſand ; and
                this is perhaps as near as we can come with a balance. We muſt always recollect that
                the capacity of the veſſel changes by heat, and we muſt know this variation, and
                take it into the account. But it is affectation to regard (as Mr Homberg would make
                us believe that he did) the diſtenſion of the veſſel by the preſſure of the fluid.
                His experiments of this kind have by no means the conſiſtency with each other that
                ſhould convince us that he did not commit much greater errors than what aroſe from
                diſtenſion.</p>
            <p>In examining either ſolids or fluids, we muſt be careful to free their ſurface, or
                that of the veſſel in which the fluid is to be weighed, from air, which frequently
                adheres to it in a peculiar manner, and, by forming a bubble, increaſes the apparent
                bulk of the ſolid, or diminiſhes the capacity of the veſſel. The greateſt part of
                what appears on thoſe occaſions ſeems to have exiſted in the fluid in a ſtate of
                chemical union, and to be ſet at liberty by the ſuperior attraction of the fluid for
                the contiguous ſolid body. Theſe air bubbles muſt be carefully bruſhed off by hand.
                All greasy matters muſt be cleared off for the ſame reaſon : they prevent the fluid
                from coming into contact.</p>
            <p>We muſt be no leſs careful that no water is imbibed by the ſolid, which would
                increaſe its weight without increaſing its bulk. In ſome caſes, however, a very long
                maceration and imbibition is neceſſary. Thus, in examining the ſpecific gravity of
                the fibrous part of vegetables, we ſhould err exceedingly if we imagined it as ſmall
                as appears at firſt. We believe that in moſt plants it is at leaſt as great as
                water, for after long maceration they sink in it.</p>
            <p>It is almoſt needleſs to ſay that the niceſt and moſt ſenſible balances are neceſſary
                for this examination. Balances are even conſtructed on purpoſe, and fitted with
                ſeveral pieces of apparatus, which make the examination eaſy and neat. We have
                deſcribed (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Balance) </hi>Mr Graveſande’s as one of the moſt
                convenient of any. His contrivance for obſerving the fractions of a grain is
                extremely ingenious and expeditious, eſpecially for detecting the effect of
                viſcidity.</p>
            <p>The hydrometer, or aecometer, is another inſtrument for aſcertaining the ſpecific
                gravity of fluids. This very pretty inſtrument is the invention of a lady, as
                eminent for intellectual accompliſhments as ſhe was admired for her beauty. Hypatia,
                the learned daughter of the celebrated mathematician Theon of Alexandria, became for
                eminent for her mathematical knowledge, that ſhe was made public profeſſor of the
                ſcience in the firſt ſchool in the world. She wrote a commentary on the works of
                Apollonius and of Diophantus, and compoſed Aſtronomical Tables ; all of which are
                loſt. Theſe rare</p>
