        <p><span class="font1">question at length, but two statements may be safely made respecting
                it. The Sabine invasion, if it took place at&nbsp;all, must have taken place far
                back in the prehistoric&nbsp;age; it must have been on a small scale ; and the
                Sabine&nbsp;invaders must have amalgamated easily and completely&nbsp;with the Latin
                settlers. The structure of the early&nbsp;Roman state, while it bears evident marks
                of a fusion of&nbsp;communities, shows no traces of a mixture of race. Nor&nbsp;is
                it easy to point to any provably Sabine element in the&nbsp;language, religion, or
                civilization of primitive Rome.@@<sup>1</sup> The&nbsp;theory of a Sabine conquest
                can hardly be maintained&nbsp;in the face of the predominantly Latin character of
                both&nbsp;people and institutions. On the other hand, the probability of a Sabine
                raid and a Sabine settlement, possibly&nbsp;on the Quirinal Hill, in very early
                times may be admitted.&nbsp;The incursions of the highland Apennine tribes into
                the&nbsp;lowlands fill a large place in early Italian history. The&nbsp;Latins were
                said to have originally descended from the&nbsp;mountain glens near
                    Reate.@@<sup>2</sup> The invasions of Campania&nbsp;and of Magna Grtecia by
                Sabellian tribes are matter of&nbsp;history, and the Sabines themselves are
                represented as&nbsp;a restless highland people, ever seeking new homes
                in&nbsp;richer lands.@@<sup>3</sup> In very early days they appear on
                the&nbsp;borders of Latium, in close proximity to Rome, and Sabine&nbsp;forays are
                familiar and frequent occurrences in the old&nbsp;legends.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Such is all we know of the manner in which the separate settlements
                on the seven hills grew into a single city and&nbsp;community. How long Rome took in
                the making, or&nbsp;when or by whom the work was completed, we cannot say.&nbsp;Nor
                is it possible to give more than a very meagre outline of&nbsp;the constitution and
                of the history of the united state in the&nbsp;early days of its
            existence.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The “ populus Romanus ” was, we are told, divided into three tribes,
                Ramnes, Tities, and Luceres@@<sup>4</sup> and into thirty&nbsp;“ curiae.” The three
                tribes probably represent a primitive&nbsp;clan division, older than the Roman state
                itself. They&nbsp;survived in later times only as divisions of the ancient&nbsp;“
                equitum centuriae,” and even in the accounts of the&nbsp;earliest constitution they
                have ceased to serve as a political&nbsp;division of the people.@@<sup>5</sup> Of
                far greater importance is&nbsp;the division into “curiae.” In Cicero’s time there
                were&nbsp;still curies, curial festivals, and curiate assemblies, and&nbsp;modern
                authors are unquestionably right in regarding the&nbsp;curia as the keystone of the
                primitive political system.&nbsp;It was a primitive association held together by
                participation in common “sacra,” and possessing common festivals,&nbsp;common
                priests, and a common chapel, hall, and hearth.&nbsp;The members of a curia were
                very probably neighbours&nbsp;and kinsmen, but the curia seems to represent a stage
                in&nbsp;political development midway between that in which clanship is the sole bond
                of union and that in which such claims&nbsp;as those of territorial contiguity and
                ownership of land have&nbsp;obtained recognition. As separate associations the
                curiae</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">are probably older than the Roman state, but@@ however this may be,
                it is certain that of this state when formed&nbsp;they constituted the only
                effective political subdivisions.&nbsp;The members of the thirty curiae are the
                populus&nbsp;Romanus, and the earliest known condition of Roman&nbsp;citizenship is
                the “communio sacrorum,” partnership in&nbsp;the curial “sacra.” Below the curia
                there was no further&nbsp;political division, for there is no reason to believe that
                the&nbsp;curia was ever formally subdivided into a fixed number of&nbsp;gentes and
                families@@ Nor can we assent to the view&nbsp;which would represent the curiae as
                containing only the&nbsp;“ patrician gentes.” The primitive Roman people of
                the&nbsp;thirty curiae included all the freemen of the community,&nbsp;simple as
                well as gentle@@</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">At their head was the “rex,” the ruler of the united' people. The
                Roman “king” is not simply either the&nbsp;hereditary and patriarchal chief of a
                clan, the priestly&nbsp;head of a community bound together by common sacra,&nbsp;or
                the elected magistrate of a state, but a mixture of&nbsp;all three@@ In later times,
                when no “ patrician magistrates ”&nbsp;were forthcoming to hold the elections for
                their successors,&nbsp;a procedure was adopted which was believed to
                represent&nbsp;the manner in which the early kings had been
                    appointed@@<sup>&nbsp;</sup>In this procedure the ancient privileges of the
                old&nbsp;“ gentes ” and their elders, the importance of maintaining&nbsp;unbroken
                the continuity of the “sacra,” on the transmission and observance of which the
                welfare of the community depended, and thirdly the rights of the freemen,&nbsp;are
                all recognized. On the death of a king, the auspicia,&nbsp;and with them the supreme
                authority, revert to the council&nbsp;of elders, the “patres,” as representing the
                “gentes.” By&nbsp;the “ patres ” an “ interrex ” is appointed, who in
                turn&nbsp;nominates a second; by him, or even by a third or fourth&nbsp;interrex, a
                new king is selected in consultation with the&nbsp;“patres.” The king-designate is
                then proposed to the&nbsp;freemen assembled by their curiae for their acceptance,
                and&nbsp;finally their formal acceptance is ratified by the “ patres,”&nbsp;as a
                security that the “ sacra ” of which they are the&nbsp;guardians have been
                respected.@@ Thus the king is in the&nbsp;first instance selected by the
                representatives of the old&nbsp;gentes, and they ratify his appointment. In form he
                is&nbsp;nominated directly by a predecessor from whose hands he&nbsp;receives the
                auspicia. But it is necessary also that the&nbsp;choice of the patres and the
                nomination of the interrex&nbsp;should be confirmed by a solemn vote of the
                community.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It is useless to attempt a precise definition of the prerogatives of
                the- king when once installed in office.&nbsp;Tradition ascribes to him a position
                and powers closely</span></p>
