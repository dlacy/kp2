tribe, and the eyes, ears, and other characters are similar, but the tongue is thick, fleshy, not extensile, and, instead of being terminated by two filaments, is merely notched at the extremity.
Sect. L—
No teeth on the palate.
Agamians, Cuv.
a.
Tail surrounded by rings composed of large scales,
which are frequently spiny.
Stelliones,
Cuv.
In the genus Cordylus of Gronovius, not only the tail, but even the back and abdomen, are furnished with large scales placed in transverse rows. The head, as in the common lizards, is provided with a bony buckler, and covered with plates. In several species the points of the scales of the tail form spinous circles, and there are also little spines on the sides of the back, on the shoulders, and outside the thighs. The last-named parts have a line of very large pores. The Cape of Good Hope produces several species, which have been long confounded in systematic works under the name of
LaceRa coτdylus,
Linn. They are somewhat larger than the common green lizard of Europe, and like it feed on insects.
In the genus Stellio of Daudin, the spines of the tail are of medium size, the back part of the head is bulged by the muscles of the jaws, the back and thighs are here and there beset with scales of larger size, sometimes spiny, and little groups of spines surround the ears. The thighs want the pores. The tail is long and pointed. Only a single species seems distinctly known to naturalists,—
St. vulgaris (L. stellio,
Linn.), a reptile very common in Egypt, and throughout the Levant. It measures about a foot in length, and is of an olive hue shaded with black. It is the 
hoscordylus
of the modem Greeks
(hardun
of the Arabs), and is not Unfrequently named the rough lizard, in consequence of the unusually hispid appearance of the whole of its upper surface. The Mahommedans slay this species wrathfully, from a feeling that a peculiar downward inclination of its head is in mockery of their own reverential motions while engaged in prayer. The species called
stellio 
by ancient writers was so named on account of its being marked by spots resembling stars, and was probably in no way allied to the genus to which in after times the title was applied.
The genus Doryphorus, Cuv. (a name too nearly resembling one already bestowed upon a group of insects), resembles tlle preceding in the absence of pores, but the body is not beset with groups of spines. (See Plate CCCCXXXL fig. 4.) The azure lizard
(L. azuτea,
Linn.) may serve as an example. The genus Uromastix, Cuv., may be described as composed of stellions, of which the hind head is not inflated ; all the scales of the body small, smooth, and uniform, except those of the upper surface of the tail, which are large, spiny, and projecting. There is a series of pores upon the thighs.
Stellio spinipes
of Daudin is a
Uromas-tix.
It is found in the deserts which encompass Egypt, and is supposed by Belon, although without sufficient proof, to have been the
land-crocodile
of the ancients. It measures from two to three feet, has an inflated body of a fine grass-green colour, with small spines upon the thighs, as well as on the upper portion of the tail.
⅛. Scales on the tail imbricated.
Agamœ,
Daud.
In the ordinary or restricted genus Agama, scales raised into points or tubercles beset different parts of the body, and especially the ears, with spiny projections, isolated or in groups. There is sometimes a row upon tlle nape of the neck, but not forming a compressed crest as in
Calotes. 
The skin of the throat is loose, transversely folded, and susceptible of dilatation. A species from New Holland 
(Ag. barbata,
Cuv.) is remarkable for its size and extraordinary formation. A series of large spiny scales, disposed in transverse bands, prevails along the back and tail. The throat, often much inflated, is furnished with long pointed scales, forming a kind of beard-like appendage ; and similar scales beset the sides, and form two oblique crests behind the ears. There are yellow spots upon the abdomen, bordered with black. Another of this genus is the muricated lizard of Shaw
(L. muricata),
likewise a native of New Holland. In some the body is enlarged or inflated, so as
