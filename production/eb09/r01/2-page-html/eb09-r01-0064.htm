<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">i Victoria has a uniform gauge of 5 feet 3 inches. The railways all belong to the state. There were 1562 miles of railway open at&nbsp;the end of 1883, besides which 130 were in progress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">i </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Queensland a system of light substantial railways has been laid out on the feet gauge, mainly from motives of economy and&nbsp;to moderate the difficulties of carrying the line over the main range&nbsp;to the tableland of the Darling Downs. The first section of the&nbsp;Southern and Western Railway was opened in 1867. At the end&nbsp;of 1883 there were 1038 miles of railway open for traffic, and 454&nbsp;were in course of construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In South Australia a gauge of 5 feet 3 inches was at first adopted. The Adelaide and Port Adelaide Railway, miles long, was opened&nbsp;in 1856, and the Adelaide and Kapunda Railway, connecting the&nbsp;capital with the chief copper mines, 50¿ miles long, was opened in&nbsp;1857. At the same time railways on a 3J feet gauge were also constructed ; the first of these, between Port Wakefield and Blyth,&nbsp;was partly opened in May 1867. The Port Augusta and Port&nbsp;Darwin Railway, destined to connect the Indian Ocean with the&nbsp;Southern Ocean, will, when completed, be about 2000 miles in&nbsp;length. The colony had 991 miles of railway open for traffic at&nbsp;the end of 1883, with 225 in course of construction. In view of&nbsp;the inconveniences of a break of gauge, the progress of the broader&nbsp;gauge lines was stayed northwards, after the junctions had been&nbsp;effected, and new main lines into the interior are constructed on&nbsp;the 3| feet gauge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Western Australia there were only 55 miles of railway open for traffic at the end of 1883 and 68 in course of construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">At the end of 1883 Tasmania had 167 miles of railway completed, and in 1884 207 miles in course of construction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">New Zealand</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The first railways in New Zealand were constructed in the province of Canterbury: the Lyttelton and Christchurch Railway, connecting the port town with the capital of the province, 6 miles long, was commenced in 1860, and opened in&nbsp;1867, laid to a gauge of 5 feet 3 inches. The Great Southern Railway, a portion of the trunk line to the south, of the same gauge,&nbsp;was opened, also in 1867, to the river Selwyn, distant 23 miles from&nbsp;Christchurch. A comprehensive system of railways connecting the&nbsp;chief towns of the colony was commenced at the expense of the&nbsp;Government in 1872, for which the 3^ feet gauge was adopted as&nbsp;the standard. The first lines so constructed were the Wellington&nbsp;and Woodville Railway and the Napier and Manawatu Railway.&nbsp;At the end of 1883 there were 469 miles open for traffic in the&nbsp;North Island and 926 in the South Island, besides 91 of private&nbsp;lines, making in all 1486 miles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Construction</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The low cost of American railways has been due largely to a close adaptation of the alignment to the natural surface&nbsp;by the use of grades and curves. The importance of saving in&nbsp;materials, labour, and cost has been very much greater than in&nbsp;Europe, because labour and nearly all materials but timber were&nbsp;much costlier, and especially because the interest on money was&nbsp;very much higher,—until about 1875, on the average probably 9 or&nbsp;10 per cent. The use of the “ truck ” or “bogie ” under locomotives&nbsp;and cars made it possible for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, the&nbsp;first long line in a mountainous country, to be constructed with&nbsp;curves of 600 feet radius, and on temporary lines on the same railway with curves of 300 and 278 feet radius. Curves of 955 and even&nbsp;716 feet radius are common through difficult country; curves of&nbsp;573 feet radius occur on some important lines; and 410 to 383 feet&nbsp;radii are not uncommon in mountainous regions. On the United&nbsp;States military railroads in 1864 an immense traffic passed safely&nbsp;over temporary lines with a curve of 50 feet radius. Early experiments as to the real power of the locomotive to surmount gradients&nbsp;led to the adoption of 110 and 116 feet per mile for ascents 17 miles&nbsp;long, and to the successful use on a temporary track over a tunnel&nbsp;(in 1852) of gradients of 1 in 10, over which a locomotive weighing&nbsp;25 tons hauled regularly one-car trains weighing 53^ tons, including&nbsp;its own weight. A gradient of 1 in 127 miles long, in a mining&nbsp;branch in Colorado is now regularly worked. In the construction&nbsp;proper a noticeable peculiarity has been the free use of open trestle-work of timber, to save both masonry and earth or rock excavation.&nbsp;Some of these timber structures have been of enormous proportions,&nbsp;as the Portage Viaduct (see vol. iv. p. 328) over the Genesee River,&nbsp;234 feet high and 800 feet long, in 50 feet spans, built in eighteen&nbsp;months (1858), at a cost of only $140,000, and containing 125,000&nbsp;cubic feet of timber and 80 tons of bolts. Structures of timber&nbsp;exceeding 100 feet in height have been rare, but of all dimensions&nbsp;below that exceedingly common, the usual intent and practice having been to replace them as they became unserviceable with masonry&nbsp;embankments. Although their use has not unfrequently been&nbsp;abused by permitting them to become unsafe from decay, they have&nbsp;in the main been thoroughly solid and substantial. For bridge&nbsp;spans of 30 to 250 feet the wooden “Howe truss” bridge, a type&nbsp;peculiar to America, was early invented and almost universally&nbsp;used where wrought-iron trusses would be now used both in&nbsp;Europe and America. The piers and abutments for such trusses&nbsp;were usually of stone, but not unfrequently of timber also. These&nbsp;wooden trusses are now being rapidly replaced with iron,-the lead-ing types being the Whipple, Post, Fink, and Bollman trusses (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bridges, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. iv. p. 322 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sq.).</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The sleepers (in America called ties&nbsp;or cross-ties) are usually of hard wood (white oak), hewn on top&nbsp;and bottom, with the natural surface of the tree on the sides. The&nbsp;usual dimensions are 6 (sometimes 7) inches thick, 8 (sometimes 8|&nbsp;or 9) feet long, and 8 to 10 or even 12 inches face. The usual rule&nbsp;is to place them 2 feet or less apart, and 2640 to 2700 to the mile.&nbsp;The large bearing surface thus afforded has especially favoured the&nbsp;use of the flat-based or Vignoles rail, and it is in exclusive use&nbsp;throughout North and for the most part South America. The rails&nbsp;now most largely rolled weigh from 56 to 65 lb per yard. On the&nbsp;light-traffic lines of the south and west there are still many 50 lb&nbsp;rails, and in the north and east rails of 70, 72, 75, and 80 tb sections&nbsp;are in limited but increasing use. An average for the whole United&nbsp;States would now be somewhat under 60 lb. The close propinquity&nbsp;of the sleepers gives much greater stiffness to the rail than comparative weights alone would indicate, a 60 lb rail being fully&nbsp;equivalent in stiffness and strength to an 80 lb rail supported on&nbsp;chairs 3 feet between centres. The ballast and drainage of American&nbsp;railroads have often been very defective, with the view to effecting&nbsp;a large saving in first cost. Improvements in this as in other&nbsp;respects have taken place in recent years, and many thousand miles&nbsp;are now maintained at a high standard of excellence. Right of&nbsp;way, usually in a continuous strip 100 feet wide (wider where&nbsp;necessary, but never narrower), has been largely given, or purchased&nbsp;at veiy low rates. The widths of road-bed (almost always first&nbsp;graded for a single track) are usually 18 to 20 feet in excavation&nbsp;and 14 feet on embankments, with 1| to 1 slopes. Side slopes of&nbsp;1 to 1 have been largely used in regions not exposed to frost.&nbsp;Parallel tracks are placed 13 feet between centres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Railway development in the United States has had to adapt itself to the needs of a new and rapidly growing country, a large&nbsp;part of which was first made available for settlement by railways.&nbsp;Three locomotives were imported from England in 1829, and the&nbsp;first trial in America took place on 8th August 1829 at Honesdale,&nbsp;Pennsylvania. The first railway constructed to be worked by locomotives was the South Carolina Railroad (1828-30), though trials&nbsp;of an experimental locomotive had been made before on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which continued to be worked by horse&nbsp;power until 1832. The mileage of railway construction about kept&nbsp;pace with that of the United Kingdom until 1850 ; at the beginning&nbsp;of 1885 it amounted to 125,379 miles. The mileage completed&nbsp;amounted to 40 miles at the end of 1830, to 3361 miles in 1841, and&nbsp;to 5206 miles in 1847, of which 1340 miles had been opened within&nbsp;six years. Then there was a sudden and great increase, the yearly&nbsp;additions for seven years being 1056 miles in 1848, 1048 in 1849,&nbsp;1261 in 1850, 1274 in 1851, 2288 in 1852, 2170 in 1853, 3442&nbsp;miles in 1854. The Civil War checked railway construction, only&nbsp;3257 miles being opened during the five years ending with 1865,&nbsp;when the aggregate amounted to 32,996 miles. But during the&nbsp;seven years ending with 1872 the mileage of the country was nearly&nbsp;doubled, the yearly additions being 1403 miles in 1866, 2541 in&nbsp;1867, 2468 in 1868, 4103 in 1869, 5658 in 1870, 6660 in 1871, 7439&nbsp;in 1872, a total of 30,272 miles in seven years. At the close of&nbsp;this period of construction there was a mile of railway to every 666&nbsp;inhabitants. It was followed by great financial disasters and industrial stagnation, and by a period of comparative inactivity in&nbsp;railway extension, only 5217 miles being opened in 1873, and only&nbsp;14,057 in the five years ending with 1878 (2428 in the last-named&nbsp;year). During the five years ending with 1883 40,000 miles were&nbsp;opened, of which 11,568 fell to 1882. At the end of 1884 the&nbsp;population per mile of railway w<sup>r</sup>as 458. There was no railway west&nbsp;of the Mississippi until 1853, and then only 38 miles; in 1860&nbsp;there were 1930 miles (24,990 on the east), and in 1865 3007 miles.&nbsp;(29,988 on the east). Since 1865 46,600 miles have been built&nbsp;west of the Mississippi. About one-half of the population of the&nbsp;United States is in the territory lying north of the Potomac and&nbsp;Ohio and east of the Mississippi, including sixteen States with&nbsp;an aggregate area of 418,495 square miles, 29,000,000 inhabitants,&nbsp;and 55,725 miles of railway. France and Germany together have&nbsp;nearly the same area (416,205 square miles), 83,000,000 inhabitants,&nbsp;and 40,682 miles of railway. The United States has one mile of&nbsp;railway to 75־ square miles of territory and 520 inhabitants, aml&nbsp;Europe 1 mile of railway to 102־ square miles and 2040 inhabitants. The two States of New York and Pennsylvania, whose area&nbsp;is about equal to that of Great Britain, have one mile of railway to&nbsp;62־ square miles, against one to 59־ in Great Britain ; and Massachusetts and New Jersey, with one-third more area than Belgium&nbsp;(which has more railway in proportion to area than any other&nbsp;European country), have 4 square miles of area per mile of railway,&nbsp;while Belgium has 42־. In the Southern States the railways are&nbsp;much less numerous and have lighter traffic and earnings. The&nbsp;prevailing course of traffic in America is east and west, or rather</span></p>
