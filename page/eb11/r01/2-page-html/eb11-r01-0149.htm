<p><span class="font2">by which means the bearing shoots are deflected from the per-pendicular to the sunny side of the row, and are not shaded by the annual wood. When this mode of training is adopted, the&nbsp;plan of planting 1 foot apart in the row and leaving one or two&nbsp;canes only to each shoot is preferable. The ground between&nbsp;the rows should never be disturbed by deep digging; but an&nbsp;abundant supply of good manure should be given annually in&nbsp;autumn as a dressing, which should be forked in regularly to a&nbsp;depth of 4 or 5 inches. All surplus suckers should be got away&nbsp;early in the summer before they have robbed the roots—five or&nbsp;six, to be reduced to the four best, being reserved to each root.&nbsp;Fresh plantations of raspberries should be made every six or&nbsp;seven years. The double-bearing varieties, which continue to fruit&nbsp;during autumn, require light soils and warm situations. These&nbsp;should be cut close down in February, as it is the strong young&nbsp;shoots of the current year which bear the late autumnal crops.&nbsp;The other varieties may be made to bear in autumn by cutting&nbsp;the stems half-way down at an early period in spring; but, as&nbsp;with all other fruits, the flavour of the raspberry is best when&nbsp;it is allowed to ripen at its natural season.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The European raspberry, though admittedly of better quality, has been largely displaced in the United States of America by&nbsp;a closely allied native species, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">strigosus,</span><span class="font2"> the numerous varieties&nbsp;of which are hardier than the varieties of the European species&nbsp;and ripen their crop much more rapidly. The stems are more&nbsp;slender and flexible than in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Idacus,</span><span class="font2"> usually brown or reddish-brown in colour and beset with stiff straight prickles. The&nbsp;most important raspberry of cultivation in America is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R. occidentalis,</span><span class="font2"> the black raspberry or thimbleberry, which is at once&nbsp;distinguished by its firm black, rarely yellow, fruit. The purple-cane raspberry, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">neglectus,</span><span class="font2"> with fruit varying in colour from&nbsp;dull purple to dark red or sometimes yellowish, is perhaps a&nbsp;hybrid between </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">strigosus</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R. occidentalis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For a detailed account of the American species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rubus</span><span class="font1"> see F. W. Card, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bush-fruits</span><span class="font1"> (1898).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Loganberry is a hybrid between the raspberry </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rubus Idaeus}</span><span class="font2"> and the blackberry or bramble (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R. fruticosus</span><span class="font2">), and&nbsp;derives its name from its raiser, Judge Logan of the American&nbsp;Bar. It is a strong-growing plant, partaking more of the habit&nbsp;of the blackberry than the raspberry, and making shoots often&nbsp;10 to 15 ft. long in the course of the year. These bear leaves&nbsp;with 5 leaflets, and fruit the following year. The fruiting shoots&nbsp;have leaves with only 3 leaflets; but young and old stems are&nbsp;densely covered with sharp crimson prickles. The fruits are&nbsp;borne profusely in loose trusses, and are ripe in southern&nbsp;localities in July, and about early August in northern parts.&nbsp;They are at first reddish like raspberries in a half-ripened state,&nbsp;but when fully ripe are deep purplish red, and much more&nbsp;palatable, each fruit being about 1¼</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font2">in. long, and shaped like&nbsp;a raspberry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Loganberry flourishes in heavy loamy soil, and is a useful plant for old fences or trellises, or even in waste places, where it is&nbsp;fully exposed to the sunshine. The old fruiting shoots should be&nbsp;cut away each winter, and in the spring the young shoots should&nbsp;have a foot or two taken off the ends, to induce the better and riper&nbsp;buds lower down to throw masses of white flowers, to be succeeded&nbsp;in due course by the fruits. Propagation is by means of suckers&nbsp;from the base.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RASPE, RUDOLF ERICH (1737-1794), the original author of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Adventures of Baron Munchausen</span><span class="font2"> (see Munchausen),&nbsp;was born in Hanover in 1737, and studied at Göttingen and&nbsp;Leipzig. In 1762 he became a clerk in the university library&nbsp;at Hanover, and in 1764 secretary to the university library at&nbsp;Göttingen. He had become known as a versatile scholar and&nbsp;a student of natural history and antiquities, and be published&nbsp;some original poems and also translations, among the latter&nbsp;of Leibnitz’s philosophical works and of Ossian’s poems; he&nbsp;also wrote a treatise on Percy’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reliques.</span><span class="font2"> In 1767 he was&nbsp;appointed professor in Cassel, and subsequently librarian.&nbsp;He contributed in 1769 a zoological paper to the 59th volume&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions,</span><span class="font2"> which led to his being selected&nbsp;an honorary member of the Royal Society in London, and he&nbsp;wrote voluminously on all sorts of subjects. In 1774 he started&nbsp;a periodical called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cassel Spectator.</span><span class="font2"> But having gone to&nbsp;Italy in 1775 to buy curios for the landgrave of Hesse, to whom&nbsp;he was keeper of the gems, he was found to have sold the land-grave’s valuables for his own profit; and, on orders being issued&nbsp;for his arrest, he decamped to England. In London he employed&nbsp;his knowledge of English and his learning to secure a living&nbsp;by publishing books on various subjects, and English translations of German works, and there are allusions to him as “ a&nbsp;Dutch savant ” in 1780 in the writings of Horace Walpole,&nbsp;who gave him money and helped him to publish an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on the Origin of Oil-painting</span><span class="font2"> (1781). But he remained poor, and&nbsp;the Royal Society expunged his name off its list. He went to&nbsp;Cornwall in 1782, and till about 1788 was assay-master and&nbsp;storekeeper at the Dolcoath mine, where memories of his&nbsp;ingenuity remained to the middle of the 19th century. While&nbsp;there, he seems to have written the original version of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Munchausen,</span><span class="font2"> which was subsequently elaborated by others. Between 1785 and 1790 he compiled a descriptive catalogue of&nbsp;James Tassie’s collection of pastes and casts of gems, in two&nbsp;quarto volumes (1791) of laborious industry and bibliographical&nbsp;rarity. Raspe then went to Scotland, and in Caithness found&nbsp;a patron in Sir John Sinclair of Ulbster, whose mineralogical&nbsp;proclivities he proceeded to impose upon by pretending to&nbsp;discover valuable and workable veins on his estates; but&nbsp;Raspe had “ salted ” the ground himself, and on the verge of&nbsp;exposure he absconded. He next betook himself to Ireland,&nbsp;but died at Muckross in 1794, when he was only beginning some&nbsp;mining operations in Donegal. His career is interesting because&nbsp;of his connexion with the famous book of stories of Baron&nbsp;Munchausen </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font2"> His authorship was not known in his&nbsp;lifetime, except to his friend Gottfried August Bürger and&nbsp;possibly a few of his other intimates (such as Kästner and&nbsp;Lichtenburg) in his student days at Göttingen; and it was&nbsp;not till 1824 that the biographer of Bürger (who had been&nbsp;credited with writing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Munchausen</span><span class="font2"> instead of only translating&nbsp;it, as he did in 1786) revealed the truth about the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RASSAM, HORMUZD (1826-1910), Assyriologist and traveller, was born at Mosul of native Christian parents. His first work&nbsp;was done as assistant to Sir A. H. Layard in his first expedition&nbsp;(1845-47). He subsequently came to England, studied at&nbsp;Oxford, and was again sent by the British Museum trustees to&nbsp;accompany Layard in his second expedition (1849-51). Layard&nbsp;having entered upon a political career, Rassam continued the&nbsp;work (1852-54) in Assyria under the direction of the British&nbsp;Museum and Sir Henry Rawlinson at Nimrud and Kuyunjik.&nbsp;In 1866 he was sent by the British government to Abyssinia,&nbsp;where, however, he was imprisoned for two years until freed&nbsp;by the victory of Sir Robert Napier. From 1876 to 1882 he&nbsp;was again in Assyria conducting important investigations,&nbsp;especially at Nineveh, and during the Russo-Turkish War he&nbsp;was sent on a mission of inquiry to report on the condition of&nbsp;the Christian communities of Asia Minor and Armenia. His&nbsp;archaeological work resulted in many important discoveries&nbsp;and the collection of valuable epigraphical evidence.</span></p>
