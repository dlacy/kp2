<p><span class="font2">sided with Urban VI. in Rome, Scotland with Clement VII., his rival; Flanders followed England; Urban secured Germany,&nbsp;Hungary and the northern kingdoms; while Spain, after remaining neutral for a time, went over to Clement. Western&nbsp;Christendom had now two papal courts to support. The schism&nbsp;extended down to the bishoprics, and even to the monasteries&nbsp;and parishes, where partisans of the rival popes struggled to&nbsp;obtain possession of sees and benefices. The urgent necessity&nbsp;for healing the schism, the difficulty of uniting the colleges&nbsp;of cardinals, and the prolonged and futile negotiations carried&nbsp;on between the rival popes inevitably raised the whole question&nbsp;of the papal supremacy, and led to the search for a still higher&nbsp;ecclesiastical authority, which, when the normal system of&nbsp;choosing the head of the Church broke down, might re-establish&nbsp;that ecclesiastical unity to which all Europe as yet clung.&nbsp;The idea of the supreme power on earth of a general council&nbsp;of Christendom, deliberating in the name of the Holy Spirit,&nbsp;convoked, if necessary, independently of the popes, was defended&nbsp; by many, and advocated by the university of Paris.&nbsp;The futile council of Pisa in 1409, however, only served to&nbsp;increase to three the number of rival representatives of God&nbsp;on earth. The considerable pamphlet literature of the time&nbsp;substantiates the conclusion of an eminent modern Catholic&nbsp;historian, Ludwig Pastor, who declares that the crisis through&nbsp;which the church passed in this terrible period of the schism&nbsp;was the most serious in all its history. It was at just this&nbsp;period, when the rival popes were engaged in a life-and-death&nbsp;struggle, that heretical movements appeared in England,&nbsp;France, Italy, Germany, and especially in Bohemia, which&nbsp;threatened the whole ecclesiastical order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The council of Constance assembled in 1414 under auspices hopeful not only for the extinction of the schism but for the&nbsp;general reform of the Church. Its members showed&nbsp;no patience with doctrinal innovations, even such&nbsp;moderate ones as John Huss represented. They&nbsp;turned him over to the secular arm for execution,&nbsp;although they did not thereby succeed in checking the growth of heresy in Bohemia (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Huss). </span><span class="font2">The&nbsp;healing of the schism proved no very difficult matter;&nbsp;but the council hoped not only to restore unity and&nbsp;suppress heresy, but to re-establish general councils as&nbsp;a regular element in the legislation of the Church. The&nbsp;decree </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sacrosancta</span><span class="font2"> (April 1415) proclaimed that a general&nbsp;council assembled in the Holy* Spirit and representing the&nbsp;Catholic Church militant had its power immediately from&nbsp;Christ, and was supreme over every one in the Church,&nbsp;not excluding the pope, in all matters pertaining to the faith&nbsp;and reformation of the Church of God in head and members.&nbsp;The decree </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Frequens</span><span class="font2"> (October 1417) provided for the regular&nbsp;convocation of councils in the future. As to ecclesiastical&nbsp;abuses the council could do very little, and finally satisfied&nbsp;itself with making out a list of those which the new pope was&nbsp;required to remedy in co-operation with the deputies chosen&nbsp;by the council. The list serves as an excellent summary of&nbsp;the evils of the papal monarchy as recognized by the unimpeachably&nbsp; orthodox. It included: the number, character&nbsp;and nationality of the cardinals, the abuse of the “ reservations ” made by the apostolic see, the annates, the collation&nbsp;to benefices, expectative favours, cases to be brought before&nbsp;the papal Curia (including appeals), functions of the papal&nbsp;chancery and penitentiary, benefices </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in commendam,</span><span class="font2"> confirmation of elections, income during vacancies, indulgences,&nbsp;tenths, for what reasons and how is a pope to be corrected or&nbsp;deposed. The pope and the representatives of the council&nbsp;made no serious effort to remedy the abuses suggested under&nbsp;these several captions; but the idea of the superiority of a&nbsp;council over the pope, and the right of those who felt aggrieved&nbsp;by papal decisions to appeal to a future council, remained a&nbsp;serious menace to the theory of papal absolutism. The decree&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Frequens</span><span class="font2"> was not wholly neglected; though the next council,&nbsp;at Siena, came to naught, the council at Basel, whose chief&nbsp;business was to put an end to the terrible religious war that&nbsp;had been raging between the Bohemians and Germans, was&nbsp;destined to cause Eugenius IV. much anxiety. It reaffirmed&nbsp;the decree </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sacrosancta,</span><span class="font2"> and refused to recognize the validity&nbsp;of a bull Eugenius issued in December 1431 dissolving it.&nbsp;Two years later political reverses forced the pope to sanction&nbsp;the existence of the council, which not only concluded a treaty&nbsp;with the Bohemian heretics but abolished the papal fees for&nbsp;appointments, confirmation and consecration—above all, the&nbsp;annates—and greatly reduced papal reservations; it issued&nbsp;indulgences, imposed tenths, and established rules for the&nbsp;government of the papal states. France, however, withdrew&nbsp;its support from the council, and in 1438, under purely national&nbsp;auspices, by the famous Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges, adjusted the relations of the Gallican Church to the papacy; and&nbsp;Eugenius soon found himself in a position to repudiate the&nbsp;council and summoned a new one to assemble in 1438 at Ferrara&nbsp;under his control to take up the important question of the&nbsp;pending union with the Greek Church. The higher clergy&nbsp;deserted the council of Basel, and left matters in the hands of&nbsp;the lower clergy, who chose an anti-pope; but the rump council&nbsp;gradually lost credit and its lingering members were finally&nbsp;dispersed. The various nations were left to make terms with&nbsp;a reviving papacy. England had already taken measures to&nbsp;check the papal claims. France in the Pragmatic Sanction&nbsp;reformulated the claim of the councils to be superior to the&nbsp;pope, as well as the decision of the council of Basel in regard&nbsp;to elections, annates and other dues, limitations on ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and appeals to the pope. While the&nbsp;canonical elections were re-established, the prerogatives of the&nbsp;crown were greatly increased, as in England. In short, the&nbsp;national ecclesiastical independence of the French Church was&nbsp;established. The German diet of Regensburg (1439) ratified&nbsp;in the main the decrees of the council of Basel, which clearly&nbsp;gratified the electors, princes and prelates; and Germany for&nbsp;the first time joined the ranks of the countries which subjected&nbsp;the decrees of the highest ecclesiastical instance to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">placet&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">or approval of the civil authorities. But there was no strong&nbsp;power, as in England and France, to attend to the execution&nbsp;of the provisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1448 Eugenius’s successor, Nicholas V., concluded a concordat with the emperor Frederick III. as representative of the German nation. This confined itself to papal&nbsp;appointments and the annates. In practice it restored&nbsp;the former range of papal reservations, and extended&nbsp;the papal right of appointment to all benefices (except&nbsp;the higher offices in cathedrals and collegiate churches)&nbsp;which fell vacant during the odd months. It also accorded </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">him&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the right to confirm all newly elected prelates and to receive&nbsp;the annates. Nothing was said in the concordat of a great&nbsp;part of the chief subjects of complaint. This gave the princes&nbsp;an excuse for the theory that the decrees of Constance and&nbsp;Basel were still in force, limiting the papal prerogatives in all&nbsp;respects not noticed in the concordat. It was Germany which&nbsp;gave the restored papacy the greatest amount of anxiety during&nbsp;the generation following the dissolution of the council of Basel.&nbsp;In the “ recesses ” or formal statements issued at the conclusion of the sessions of the diet one can follow the trend of&nbsp;opinion among the German princes, secular and ecclesiastical.&nbsp;The pope is constantly accused of violating the concordat, and&nbsp;constant demands are made for a general council, or at least&nbsp;a national one, which should undertake to remedy the abuses.&nbsp;The capture of Constantinople by the Turks afforded a new&nbsp;excuse for papal taxation. In 1453 a crusading bull was issued&nbsp;imposing a tenth on all benefices of the earth to equip an&nbsp;expedition against the infidel. The diet held at Frankfort in 1456 recalled the fact that the council of Constance had forbidden&nbsp; the pope to impose tenths without the consent of the&nbsp;clergy in the region affected, and that it was clear that he&nbsp;proposed to “ pull the German sheep’s fleece over its ears.”&nbsp;A German correspondent of Aeneas Sylvius assures him in 1457 that “ thousands of tricks are devised by the Roman&nbsp;see which enables it to extract the money from our pockets very</span></p>
