<p><span class="font1">the Batrachia, having an aspect exceedingly deformed. This arises not so much from the general shape of the animal, as&nbsp;from the extraordinary structure of the upper eyelids, which&nbsp;are so formed as to resemble a pair of strange sharp-pointed&nbsp;horns, while the width of the mouth exceeds that of its congeners, and equals half the length of its body. Seba, in fact,&nbsp;describes it as having two sharp horns on its head, within&nbsp;which its eyes are situated ; and Schneider more accurately, as a pair of accuminated callous processes, of a conical&nbsp;shape, placed upon the eyelids. The colour is grayish yellow, striped with brown. The body is rough, with pointed&nbsp;spines. The head is very large and thick, and the tongue&nbsp;proportionably so. Baron Cuvier assigns five species to this&nbsp;genus, from the works of Seba, Daudin, Spix<sub>1</sub> and Prince&nbsp;Maximilian. In Mr Gray’s catalogue an additional one is&nbsp;furnished by Mr Wagler, the habitat of which is Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Genus Dactylethra, Cuv. The south of Africa, according to Cuvier, produces a group of Batrachians which resemble the frogs in their teeth, their smooth skin, their&nbsp;pointed toes, those of the hind feet being deeply webbed,&nbsp;and the inner three having their extremity enveloped in&nbsp;a conical nail, which is black ; their head is small, and&nbsp;their mouth not very large. The tongue, attached deep&nbsp;in the throat, is fleshy and large ; their tympanum not apparent. These numerous distinctive characters have induced&nbsp;the baron to constitute a new genus under the above name,&nbsp;from 3αxruλ)j3jα, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a thimble.</span><span class="font1"> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">smooth toad, crapaud lisse&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of Daudin </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">CPipa bufonia</span><span class="font1"> of Merrem), belongs to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Genus Hyla, Laurenti ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Calamita,</span><span class="font1"> Schn. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tree-frogs</span><span class="font1"> of the English,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rainettes</span><span class="font1"> of French authors. The Hylæ were first separated from the frogs and toads by Laurenti, and his arrangement is now universally followed.&nbsp;They differ from the other genera in having all the extremities of their toes enlarged, and rounded into a kind of&nbsp;disk or cushion, usually covered with a viscid humour,&nbsp;which enables them to attach themselves firmly to foreign&nbsp;bodies, and to climb trees. (See Plate CCCCXXXIII. fig.&nbsp;3.) Trees, in fact, constitute their abode during the whole of&nbsp;summer, and there they hunt for food. They, however, produce their ova in water, and shelter themselves in the mud&nbsp;during winter. They have a gular pouch, and are good&nbsp;croakers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The disks with which the toes of the tree-frogs are provided are simply fleshy, and in the form of lentils. Examined with the microscope, they appear like porous sieves, from which a glutinous fluid slowly exudes ; they are usually somewhat concave, and are sometimes furnished with a&nbsp;distinct fold. By means of this apparatus the species can&nbsp;attach themselves to smooth surfaces ; they can leap from&nbsp;branch to branch, and can traverse twigs when agitated by&nbsp;the wind. They may be regarded as among the most nimble&nbsp;of their kind. They are, however, more tranquil than many,&nbsp;and watch most patiently for prey. In the day time, and&nbsp;especially when the sun’s heat is great, they are said to shelter themselves among the thick foliage, putting themselves&nbsp;in motion on the approach of evening, and then sporting with&nbsp;delight. The croaking of these animals is similar to that of&nbsp;the proper frogs, but stronger, though not quite so sharp. It&nbsp;is most frequently heard in wet weather ; but on a beautiful&nbsp;summer evening the traveller is sometimes surprised by a&nbsp;vast group of these hoarse musicians, assembled on the tops&nbsp;of the highest trees. They feed on the insect tribes. Late&nbsp;in the season they retire to the water, where they pass the&nbsp;winter in a kind of lethargy, and remain there till the spawning season has elapsed. Some Indian species deposit their&nbsp;eggs on the under side of leaves hanging over water ; and&nbsp;General Hardwicke has observed them place their ova on&nbsp;a leaf which stood over a pail of water, so that the young&nbsp;dropt into the fluid beneath. There is not a single species&nbsp;of the tree-frog in the British isles ; they occur, however, frequently in the more favoured climes of Europe,&nbsp;and superabound in warmer regions. The number of ascertained species is not inferior to that of the frogs proper. They are among the most interesting of the race,&nbsp;and many of them are very beautiful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H. Arborea,</span><span class="font1"> Cuv.</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> ; R.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arborea,</span><span class="font1"> Lin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Common tree-frog.</span><span class="font1"> In beauty of colouring, as well as in elegance of form, and general agility of movement, the tree-frog&nbsp;exceeds every other European species. It is found in&nbsp;France, Germany, and Italy; but more towards the south&nbsp;than north. It avoids dry situations and mountainous forests, and delights in humid woods, in hedges bordering on&nbsp;marshes, and in parks and gardens ornamented with water.&nbsp;Its principal sojourn during the summer months is the upper parts of trees, searching for insects, which it catches&nbsp;with extreme alacrity, stealing softly upon them, as a cat&nbsp;towards a mouse, and seizing them with a sudden spring&nbsp;of frequently more than a yard in height. It often suspends itself by its feet, or by a single foot, or even by its&nbsp;abdomen and drawn-up toes from a twig, or the under portion of a leaf, thus continuing beneath the shade. It is&nbsp;among the smallest of European frogs. Its colour is green&nbsp;above, more or less bright ; its belly whitish, and covered&nbsp;with numerous small tubercles; a dark violet-coloured&nbsp;streak runs along the flanks ; and the limbs are reddish.&nbsp;The body is smooth above, and rather short and plump ;&nbsp;the hind legs are very long and slender. The fore feet&nbsp;have four toes, the hind five, and all of them terminate in&nbsp;dilated flattish tips. The surface of the abdomen is very&nbsp;remarkable, being so granular, adhesive, and elastic, that&nbsp;it enables the animal to adhere almost to anything, even,&nbsp;it is said, to polished glass, at whatever inclination, or in&nbsp;whatever position it is placed. The spawn is deposited towards the end of April, and the perfect animal appears in&nbsp;August, when it ascends the neighbouring trees, and assorts with its parents. Being very noisy on the approach&nbsp;of rain, this species is considered as an excellent barometer ; and in the German </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ephemerides</span><span class="font1"> there is an account of&nbsp;one which was kept in a state of domestication for seven&nbsp;years, and gave the greatest satisfaction from being peculiarly weather-wise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zebra hyla, H. calarnitα,</span><span class="font1"> Gray, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Calamita maxima,</span><span class="font1"> Schn., appears to be one of the largest of these slender-bodied fi<sup>ι</sup>ogs, a specimen described by Seba having attained the length of five inches. It is a native of Carolina and Virginia. It is of a rufous-brown colour, striped&nbsp;with chestnut bands ; all its feet are w<sup>,</sup>ebbed, and the toes&nbsp;orbicular. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Merian hyla, H. Meriana,</span><span class="font1"> Gray, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rana&nbsp;Meriana,</span><span class="font1"> Shaw, first depicted and described by Maria&nbsp;Merian, in her </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Surinam,</span><span class="font1"> merits a distinct notice. It is&nbsp;about three times the size of the common hyla ; and on&nbsp;each side of the neck has a remarkable protuberance, resembling an obtusely conical inflated pouch ; its hind feet&nbsp;are distinctly webbed. It is of a brownish-green colour&nbsp;above, and is variegated with patches of yellow. It is found&nbsp;sometimes on trees, and sometimes in water. Mad. Me-rian states that they have external ears, and that the balls&nbsp;on their toes facilitate their progress over the soft marshes&nbsp;which they frequent. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H. tibiatrix,</span><span class="font1"> Laurenti, is an&nbsp;American species, and is said by Seba to croak in a melodious manner during very hot weather after the setting of&nbsp;the sun, while in the cold and rainy season it is silent, concealing itself at the bottom of the waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H. lateralis,</span><span class="font1"> Catesby, has been observed in Carolina, and also, it is said, in Surinam. It is usually found attached&nbsp;underneath the leaves of trees, concealing itself, and lying&nbsp;secure from birds and serpents, its most dangerous foes.&nbsp;They are sometimes found in vast heaps, the bushes and&nbsp;woods being completely covered with them ; and their&nbsp;croaking may be heard at the distance of whole leagues.&nbsp;They make prodigious leaps, and hence in the United&nbsp;States are called the crickets of the savannahs, their cry</span></p>
