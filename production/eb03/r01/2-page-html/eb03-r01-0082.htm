<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">upon </span><span class="font2">this occaſion. For gondoliers who have loſt the race often declare, that witchcraft had been practiſed&nbsp;againſt them, or certainly they muſt have won the day.&nbsp;Such a ſuppoſition prevents a poor fellow from thinking ill of himſelf ; an opinion that might be favourable&nbsp;to him another time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The courſe is about four miles. Tlie boats ſtart ſrom </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font2">certain place, run through the great winding canal,&nbsp;which divides the town into two parts, turn round a&nbsp;picket-, and, coming back the fame way, go and ſeize&nbsp;the prize, which is fixed at the acuteſt angle of the&nbsp;great canal, on the convex ſide, ſo that the point of&nbsp;fight may he the more extended, and the prize ſeized&nbsp;in the ſight of the ſpectators on both ſides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">According to the number of competitors, different races are performed in different ſorts of boats ; ſome with ∙&nbsp;one oar and others with two. The prizes propoſed are&nbsp;four, indicated by four flags of different colours, with&nbsp;the different value of the prizes marked upon them.—&nbsp;Theſe flags, public and glorious monuments, are the&nbsp;prizes to which the competitors particularly aſpire. But&nbsp;the government always adds to each a genteel ſum of&nbsp;money ; befides that the conquerors, immediately after&nbsp;the victory, are ſurroundtd by all the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">beau monde,</span><span class="font2"> who&nbsp;congratulate and make them pref<sup>,</sup>μts ; after which they&nbsp;go, bearing their honourable trophy in their hand,&nbsp;down the whole length of the canal, and receive the&nbsp;applauſe of innumerable fpectat0r3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This grand canal, ever ſtriking by the ſingularity and beauty of the buildings which border it, is, upon&nbsp;theſe occaſions, covered with an infinity of ſpectators,&nbsp;in all ſorts of barges, boats, and gondolas. The element on whieh they move is ſearcely ſeen ; but the&nbsp;noiſe of' oars, the agitation of arms and bodies in perpetual motion, indicate tbe fpectacle to be upon the&nbsp;water. At certain diſtances, on each ſide of the ſhore,&nbsp;are erected little amphitheatres and ſcaffoldings, where&nbsp;are placed bands of muſic ; the harmonious found of&nbsp;which predominates now and then over the buzzing&nbsp;nυile of the people. Some days before a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">regata,</span><span class="font2"> one&nbsp;may ſee on the great canal many boats for pleafιue and&nbsp;entertainment. The young noble, the citizen, the rich&nbsp;artizan, mounts a long boat of ſix or eight oars ; his&nbsp;gondoliers decorated with rich and ſingular dreffes, and&nbsp;the veffel itſelf adorned with various ſtuffs. Among thc&nbsp;nobles there are always a number who are at a conſiderable expence in theſe decorations ; and at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">regate</span><span class="font2"> it-ſelf ' exhibit on the water perſonages of mythologie&nbsp;ſtory, with the heroes of antiquity in their train, or&nbsp;amufe themſelves with repreſenting the coſtumi of different nations ; in ſhort, people contribute with a mad&nbsp;fort of magnificence, from all quarters, to this maſque-rade, the favourite diverlion of the venetians. But&nbsp;theſe great machines, not being the lefs in motion on&nbsp;account of their ornaments, are not merely deſtined to&nbsp;grace the ſhow : they are employed at the regata, at&nbsp;every moment, to range the people, to protect the&nbsp;courſe, and to keep the avenue open and clear to the&nbsp;goal. The nobility, kneeling upon cuſhions at the&nbsp;prow of their veffels, are attentive to theſe matters, and&nbsp;announce their orders to the moſt reſtive, by darting at&nbsp;them Jittle gilded or ſilvered balls, by means of certain&nbsp;bows, with which they are furniſhed on this occaſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And this is the only appearance of coercion in the VC-uetian police on theſe days of the greateſt tumult : nor is there to be ſeen, in any part of the city, a body of&nbsp;guards or patrol, nor even a gun or a halbert. The&nbsp;mildneſs of the nation, its gaiety, its education in the&nbsp;habit oſ believing that the government is ever awake,&nbsp;that it knows and fees every thing ; its reſpectfid attachment to the body of patricians ; the ſole afpect of&nbsp;certain officers of the police in their robes, diſperſed in&nbsp;different places, at once operate and explain that tran-quillity, that ſecurity, which we ſee in the midſt oſ the&nbsp;greateſt confuſion, and that ſurpriſing docility in ſo&nbsp;lively and fiery a people. Regattas have been attempted on the river Thames, but they were but humble imitations oſ tbe venetian amuſement.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REGENERATION, ill theology, the act of being born again by a ſpiritual birth, or the change oſ heart&nbsp;and life experienced by a perſon who ſorſakes a courſe&nbsp;oſ vice, and ſincerely embraces a life oſ virtne and piety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REGENSBURG, or Ratisbon. See Ratisbon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REGENT, one who governs a kingdom during the minority or abſence oſ the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In France, the queen-mother had the regency oſ the kingdom during the minority oſ the king, under the&nbsp;title oſ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">queen-regent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In England, the methods oſ appointir∕ this guardian or regent have been ſo various, and the duration oſ his power ſo uncertain, that ſrom hence alont it&nbsp;may be collected that his office is unknown to the common law ; aud therefore (as Sir Edward Coke ſays,&nbsp;4 Inſt. 58.) the ſureſt way is to have him made by authority oſ the great council in parliament. The earl of&nbsp;Pembroke by his own authority affumed in very troubleſome times the regency oſ Henry III. who was then&nbsp;only nine years old ; but was declared of full age by&nbsp;the pope at 17, confirmed the great charter at ιb, and&nbsp;took upon him the adminiſtration oſ the government at&nbsp;20. A guardian and councils oſ regency were named&nbsp;for Edward III. by the parliament, which depofed his&nbsp;father ; the young king being then 1 5, and not affuming&nbsp;the government till three years after, when Richard II.&nbsp;ſucceeded' at the age of 11, the duke oſ Lancaſter took&nbsp;upon him the management oſ the kingdom till the parliament met, rvhich appointed a nominal council to affiſthim.&nbsp;Henry V. on his death-bed named a regent and a guar-dian ſor his infant ſon Henry VI. then nine months old t&nbsp;but the parliament altered his diſpoſition, and appointed a protector and council, with a ſpecial limited authority. Both theſe princes remained iu a ſtate oſ pupilage till the age oſ 23. Edward V. at tlie age oſ 13,&nbsp;was recommended by his father to the care oſ the duke&nbsp;of <sub>f</sub>Glouceſter; who was declared protector by the privy-council. The ſtatutes 25 Hen. VIII. c. 12. and 28'&nbsp;Hen. VIII. c. 7. provided, that the fucceiſor, if a&nbsp;male and under 18, or if a female and under 16, ſhould&nbsp;he till ſuch age in tbe governance of his or her natural mother, (if approved by the king), and ſuch other&nbsp;counſellors as his majeſty ſhould by will or otherwiſe appoint : and he accordingly appointed his 16 executors·&nbsp;to have the government of his ion Edward VI. and the&nbsp;kingdom, which executors elected the eaιl of Hartford&nbsp;protector. Tlιe ſtatutes 24 Geo. II. c. 24. in caſe the&nbsp;crown ſhould deſcend to any of the children of Frederic late prince of wales under the age of 18, appointed the prîncefs dowager ;—and that of 5 Geo. III. c.</span></p>
