<p><span class="font1">above obſerved, a character not acknowledged by gene-ral nature in this department, ought to be rejected as generally improper. The other ſuppoſition therefore&nbsp;muſt. be accounted right ; and then, as to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">whole&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">matter of the book, the reader is found to be exactly in&nbsp;the ſituation of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">repeater,</span><span class="font1"> ſave that he takes what he&nbsp;■ delivers from the page before him inſtead of his memory. It follows then, in proof of our initial propoſition,&nbsp;that, if we are directed by nature and propriety, the&nbsp;manner of our delivery in reading ought to be inferior&nbsp;in warmth and energy to what we fhould uſe, were the&nbsp;language before us the fpontaneous effuſions of our own&nbsp;hearts in the circumftances of thoſe out of whoſe mouths&nbsp;it is ſuppoſed to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Evident as the purport of this reaſoning is, it has not ſo much as been glanced at by the writers on the ſubject we are now entered upon, or any of its kindred&nbsp;ones ; which has occaſioned a manifeſt want oſ accuracy&nbsp;in ſeveral of their rules and obſervations. Among the&nbsp;reſt, this precept has been long reverberated from author to author as a perfect ſtandard for propriety in&nbsp;reading. &quot; Deliver yourfelves in the ſame manner you&nbsp;would do, were the matter your own original ſentiments&nbsp;uttered directly ſrom the heart.” As all kinds of delivery muſt have many things in common, the rule will&nbsp;in many articles be undoubtedly right ; but, from what&nbsp;has been ſaid above, it muſt be as certainly faulty in&nbsp;reſpect to ſeveral others ; as it is certain nature never&nbsp;confounds by like ſigns two things ſo very different, as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">copy</span><span class="font1"> and an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">original,</span><span class="font1"> an emanation darted immediately&nbsp;from the ſun, and its weaker appearance in the lunar reflection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The precepts we have to offer for improving the above-mentioned rule, ihall be delivered under the heads&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">accent, eτnphafis, modulation, exprefiιon, pauſes,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">'1. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Accent.</span><span class="font1"> In attending to the affections of the Voice when we ſpeak, it is eaſy to obſerve, that, independent of any other conſideration, one part of it differs&nbsp;from another, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">βrefs, energy,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">force</span><span class="font1"> of utterance.&nbsp;In words we ſind one ſyllable differing from another&nbsp;with reſpect to this mode ; and in ſentences one or&nbsp;more words as frequently vary from the reſt in a ſimilar&nbsp;manner. This ſtreſs with regard to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ſyllables</span><span class="font1"> is called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">accent,</span><span class="font1"> and contributes greatly to the variety and harmony of language. Reſpecting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">words,</span><span class="font1"> it is termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphaſis ;</span><span class="font1"> and its chief office is to aſſiſt the ſenſe, force, or&nbsp;perſpicuity of the ſentence—of which more under tbe&nbsp;iιext head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; Accent (as defcr⅛ed in the Lectures on Elocu-tion) is made by us two ways; either by dwelling longer upon one ſyllable than tbe reſt, or by giving it a Γmarter percuſſion of the voice in utterance. Df the&nbsp;firſt of thefe we have inſtances in the words </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">glory, father,&nbsp;holy ;</span><span class="font1"> of the laſt in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bat’tie, hadit, bor'row.</span><span class="font1"> So that accent with ‘us is not referred to tune, but to time ; to&nbsp;quantity, not quality ; to the more equable or precipitate motion of the voice, not to the variation of the&nbsp;notes or inflexions.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">theatric declamation,</span><span class="font1"> in order to give it more pomp and ſolemnity, it is ufual to dwell longer than common&nbsp;upon the unaccented ſyllables ; and the author now&nbsp;quoted has endeavoured to prove (p. 51. 54.) the&nbsp;practice faulty, and to ſſiow (p. 55.) that &quot; though it&nbsp;(i. e. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">true </span><span class="font1">folemnity) may </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">demand a flower utterance</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">than uſual, yet (it) requires that the ſame </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">proportion </span><span class="font1">in point of quantity be obſerved in the ſyllables, as there&nbsp;is in mufical notes when the ſame tune is played in&nbsp;quicker or flower time.” But that this deviation from&nbsp;ordinary ſpeech is not a fault, as our author afferts ;&nbsp;nay, that on the contrary it is a real beauty when kept&nbsp;under proper regulation, the following obſervations it 13&nbsp;hoped will ſuſſiciently prove.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(I.) It is a truth of the moſt obvious nature, that thoſe things which on their application to their proper&nbsp;ſenſes have a power of raffing in us certain ideas and&nbsp;emotions, are ever </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">differently</span><span class="font1"> modified in their conſtituent&nbsp;parts when different effects are produced in the mind :&nbsp;and alſo (II.) that, within proper bounds, were we to&nbsp;ſuppoſe theſe conftituent parts to be proportionally in-creaſed or diminiſſied as to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quantity,</span><span class="font1"> this effect would&nbsp;ſtill be the ſame as to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quality.—</span><span class="font1">For inſtance : The different ideas of ſtrength, ſwiftneſs, &amp;c. which are raiſed&nbsp;in us by the ſame ſpecies of animals, is owing to the&nbsp;different form of their correſponding parts; the different&nbsp;effects of muſic on the paſſions, t® the different airs and&nbsp;movements of the melody ; and the different expreſſions&nbsp;of human ſpeech, to a difference in tone, fpeed, &amp;c. of&nbsp;the voice. And theſe peculiar effects would ſtill remain the ſame, were we to ſuppofe the animals above&nbsp;alluded to, to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">greater</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lefjer,</span><span class="font1"> within their proper&nbsp;bounds ; the movement of the muſic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quicker</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">flower,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">provided it did not palpably interfere with that of fome&nbsp;other ſpecies ; and the pitch of the voice </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">higher</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lower,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">if not carried out of the limits in which it is obſerved&nbsp;on fimilar occafions naturally to move. Farther (III.)&nbsp;fince, reſpecting the emotions more efpecially, there&nbsp;are no rules to determine </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">à priori</span><span class="font1"> what effect any particular attribute or modification of an object will have&nbsp;upon a percipient, our knowledge of this kind mnſt&nbsp;evidently be gained from experience. Laſtly, (IV.)&nbsp;In every art imitating nature we are pleaſed to fee&nbsp;the characteriſtic members of the pattern </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heightened</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">little farther than perhaps it ever was carried in any&nbsp;real example, provided it be not bordering upon ſome&nbsp;ludicrous and diſagreeable provinces of exceſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now for the application of theſe premiffes.—To keep pace and be conſiſtent with the z⅛∙∏ι(y of the tragic&nbsp;muſe, the delivery of her language ſſiould neceffarily be&nbsp;dignified ; and this it is plain from obſervation (I.) cannot be accompliſhed otherwiſe than by ſomething diffe-rent in the manner oſ it from that of ordinary fpeech ;&nbsp;fince </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dignity</span><span class="font1"> is effentially different from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiarity.</span><span class="font1"> But&nbsp;how muſt we diſcover this different manner ? By attending to nature : and in this caſe ſſie tells us, that befides&nbsp;ufing a</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">βower</span><span class="font1"> delivery, and greater </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">diβinfinejs</span><span class="font1"> of the&nbsp;words (which every thing merely </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">grave</span><span class="font1"> requires, and&nbsp;gravity is a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concomitant</span><span class="font1"> of dignity, though not its </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">effence),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">we muft dwell a little </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">longer</span><span class="font1"> upon the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">unaccented</span><span class="font1"> ſyllables than we do in common. As to what our author&nbsp;obſerves io the above quotation, of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dignity’s</span><span class="font1"> only requiring a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">βower</span><span class="font1"> utterance than ordinary, while the proportion of the ſyllables as to quantity continues the&nbsp;fame; it is apprehended the remark (II.) reſpecting&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quicknefs</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jlownefs</span><span class="font1"> of movement, will ſhow it to be&nbsp;not altogether true. For ſince the delivery is not altered in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">form,</span><span class="font1"> its expreſſion muft be ftill of the fame&nbsp;kind, and perhaps what may be rightly ſuggeſted by&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the term </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gravely familiar.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
