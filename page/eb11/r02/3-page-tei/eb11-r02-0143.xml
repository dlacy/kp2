Consequently both in the mother country and in the United States acts have been passed empowering the courts to issue commissions for taking evidence to colonial or foreign courts, and to execute such commissions when received by them from the courts of the colonies or of foreign countries. The British statutes are 13 Geo. III. c. 63; 1 Will. IV. c. 22; 3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 105, 6 &amp; 7 Vict. c. 82, 22 Vict. c. 20 and 49 &amp; 49 Vict. c. 74. But neither in England nor in thc United States have commissions of the old kind been entirely disused. In the practice under the Anglo-American statutes, the leading rules are that all the acts of the judge whose services are required, and all things done before him, are governed by the law of the country in which the execution takes place <hi rend="italic">(locus regit actum),</hi>  while the admissibility of the evidence and all else which concerns the conduct of the action is governed by the law of the country in which it is pending <hi rend="italic">(lex fori).</hi>  Details may be seen for England and the United States in the usual books of practice, and in Wharton’s <hi rend="italic">Conflict of Laws</hi>  (2nd ed., 1881), §§ 722-31, and Sir R. Phillimore’s <hi rend="italic">International Law </hi>(3rd ed., 1889), v. 4, §§ 882-85; f°<hi rend="sup">r</hi>  other countries in von Bar’s <hi rend="italic">Private International Law,</hi>  translated by Guthrie (2nd ed., 1892), §§ 39<hi rend="sup">1</hi>» 392, 409, 410. In ecclesiastical law, letters of request are issued for the purpose of sending causes from one court to another. Where a diocesan court within a province has jurisdiction over the parties concerned, the plaintiff may apply to the judge of such court for letters of request, in order that the cause may be instituted either in the court of arches or the chancery court of York, as the case may be. When the judge of the diocesan court consents to sign such Iettcrs and they have been accepted by the judge of the higher court, a decree issues under his seal, calling upon the defendant to answer to the plaintiff in the suit instituted against him. Letters of request are also issued for other purposes, being sometimes sent from one judge to another to request him to examine witnesses who are out of tbe jurisdiction of the former, but in that of the latter; to enforce a monition, &amp;c.</p><p>REQUESTS, COURT OF, a minor court of the king’s council in England, under the presidency of the lord keeper of the privy seal. Its possible origin has been assigned to an order in council of 1390 directing the lords of the council to form a committee to examine the petitions of the humble people. Its jurisdiction was chiefly equitable, and owing to the small expenses of procedure it grew in popularity, especially for cases not of sufficient importance to bring into the court of chancery itself. Under Wolsey the court was fixed permanently at Whitehall. The judges of the court were styled masters of requests. In the reign of Queen Elizabeth there were two masters ordinary and two masters extraordinary. In James I.’s reign there were four masters ordinary. In Henry VIII.’s reign the judges of the court had ceased to be privy councillors, and towards the end of Elizabeth’s reign the court incurred the hostility of the common law courts, as having neither a statutory nor prescriptive title to jurisdiction. Notwithstanding a decision in 1598 as to the illegality of its jurisdiction, and subsequent decisions to the same effect in the reigns of James I. and Charles I., it continued to flourish until the suppression of the Star Chamber in 1640 virtually put an end to it. Although it sat until 1642, and masters of requests were appointed even after the Restoration, it ceased to exercise judicial functions. There were also courts of requests or, as they were sometimes called, courts of conscience, established in London in the reign of Henry VIII. with jurisdiction in matters of debt under forty shillings. These courts were extended in the reigns of George I. and George II. to various places in England, but they were abolished by an act of 1846 (County Courts Act), which established in their place the tribunal of tbe county court <hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi></p><p>REQUIEM, the name of a solemn mass for the dead <hi rend="italic">(Missa pro defunctis)</hi>  in the Roman Church, appointed to be sung on</p><p>All Souls’ Day, in memory of all “ faithful departed,” at funeral services, and at the anniversaries of the death of particular persons. The name is taken from the first words of the Introit, <hi rend="italic">Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.</hi>  The term is specially applied to the musical setting of the mass. Thc most celebrated Requiem Masses are thosc of Palestrina, Mozart and Cherubini. The word has been also used of memorial services held in honour of a deceased person in churches other than the Roman.</p><p>REREDOS (Anglo-Fr. <hi rend="italic">areredos,</hi>  from <hi rend="italic">arere,</hi>  behind, and <hi rend="italic">dos, </hi>back), an ornamental screen of stone or wood built up, or forming a facing to the wall behind an altar in a church. Reredoses are frequently decorated with representations of the Passion, niches containing statues of saints, and the like. In England these were for the most part destroyed at thc Reformation or by the Puritans later; a few medieval examples, however, survive, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>  at Christchurch, Hants. In some large cathedrals <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>  Winchester, Durham, St Albans, the reredos is a mass of splendid tabernacle work, reaching nearly to the groining. In small churches the reredos is usually replaced by a hanging or parament behind the altar, known as a dossal or dorsal.

This Alpine pass is in some sort the pendant of the Brenner Pass, but leads from the upper valley of the Inn or Engadine to the upper valley of. the Adige. It is but 4902 ft. in height. Near the summit * is the hamlet of Reschen, while some way below is the former hospice of St Valentin auf der Haid, mentioned as early as 1140. Starting from Landeck, the carriage road runs up the Inn valley to Pfunds, whence it mounts above the gorge of Finstermtinz to the village of Nauders (27} m.) where the road from the Swiss Engadine falls in (53j m. from St Moritz). Thence the road mounts gently to the pass, and then descends, with the infant Adige, to Mals (15J m.), whence the pass is sometimes wrongly named Malserheide. The road now descends the upper Adige valley, or Vintschgau, past Meran (37J m.) to Botzen (20 m. from Meran, or 100 m, from Landeck) where the Brenner route is joined.    (W. A. B.

To constitute the legal offence of rescue, the person rescued must be in the custody of a constable or private individual, but in the latter case the rescuer must know that the prisoner is in lawful custody. The punishment for the offence is fine and imprisonment, wdth or without hard labour, if the party rescued has not been convicted of the offence for which-he was in custody. But if the prisoner has been imprisoned on a charge of, or under sentence for, high treason, felony or misdemeanour, the rescue is high treason, felony or misdemeanour. The punishment for a felonious rescue may be penal servitude for not more than seven or less than three years, or imprisonment for not more than two years, with or without hard labour. The forcible rescue of goods legally distrained or the rescuing of cattle by pound breach are misdemeanours indictable at common law, but the more usual procedure is a civil action under 2 W. &amp; M. c. 5, s. 3 (1690), which makes an offender liable for treble damages.</p><p>RESEARCH (O.
