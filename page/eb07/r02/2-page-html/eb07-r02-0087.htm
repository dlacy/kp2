<p><span class="font1">almost in itself fatal to the vraisemblance of incident. The affairs of private life we cannot help recollecting, are seldom&nbsp;managed to any great extent through the post-office, while&nbsp;in many cases it remains a mystery how such matters came&nbsp;to be committed to paper at all, and least of all under the&nbsp;circumstances in which they are supposed to be recorded by&nbsp;these persevering, and, in the existing state of the revenue&nbsp;laws, formidable correspondents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is in the mind of Richardson a very remarkable union of feminine tastes with masculine vigour. Early accustomed peculiarly to court the society of females ; the&nbsp;depository of their gossip, the confident of their love secrets, the complete letter-writer of a little knot of young&nbsp;ladies when only thirteen years of age, the deference which&nbsp;he thus acquired for their tastes, and the insight he obtained into their habits of thinking, though probably springing,&nbsp;as Johnson believed, very much from his ow<sup>τ</sup>n vanity and&nbsp;love of praise, appear to have been of the utmost use to&nbsp;him in his novels, in which so much of the interest rests&nbsp;upon the female characters, and in the minute dissection&nbsp;and study of emotions and sentiments in which women are&nbsp;either the chief actors or sufferers. The traces of this influence appear constantly, and sometimes in excess, in the&nbsp;minute accuracy with which he dwells, in description, upon&nbsp;those little particulars of looks, and voice, and gesture, and&nbsp;turns of speech, which men in their correspondence generally overlook, but which women note with such care, and&nbsp;interpret with such sagacity ; in the complacency with which&nbsp;he dwells on the details of robes and wedding dresses, which&nbsp;are conceived in the spirit of a waiting-w oman, and executed with the learning of a man-milliner ; and which, as in&nbsp;the minute description given by Lovelace of Clarissas’ dress&nbsp;at the time of her elopement, are occasionally introduced&nbsp;in the worst place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The more favourable results of these tastes are exhibited in the wonderful familiarity he evinces with the feelings and&nbsp;sympathies of women ; for though,in his notions of perfection,&nbsp;either in manners or morals, we of another age often see cause&nbsp;to depart from Richardson’s standard, we may trust implicitly to his accuracy, when he is delineating the movements of passion in the female breast, the revolutions of&nbsp;feeling, or the struggle between feeling and delicacy. In&nbsp;his female portraits even more than in his corresponding&nbsp;delineations of male character, we acknowledge the justice&nbsp;of the remark which Sir Walter Scott applies to his portraits generally, that “ in his survey of the heart, he left&nbsp;neither head, bay, nor inlet behind him, until he had traced&nbsp;its soundings, and laid it down in his chart with all its minute sinuosities, its depths, and its shallows.” This accuracy, indeed, constitutes at once his strength and his weakness ; for not content with having surveyed the coast and&nbsp;taken its bearings, he still, from the very pride of discovery,&nbsp;insists on following the windings of the shore, and pointing&nbsp;out its landmarks, when those on board would have gladly&nbsp;seen him make his passage by the shortest course. It was&nbsp;the misfortune of Richardson, that, like nervous men in&nbsp;company, or like painters who go on retouching till the picture becomes loaded, he never knew when to have done,&nbsp;either with a character or a conversation. He was unskilful,&nbsp;as D’Israeli remarks, in the art of writing, and “ could never&nbsp;lay his pen down while his inkhorn supplied it.” Even as regards the description of sentiment, or the creation of characteristic dialogue, the field in which Richardson was most at&nbsp;home, it is certain that he carried his system, probably&nbsp;as much from this inability to leave off, as from choice, to&nbsp;extremes, particularly in his last novel, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir C. Grandison;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and unless the reader selects that work on the system of&nbsp;the old lady mentioned by Sir Walter Scott, who chose it&nbsp;because she could sleep for half an hour at any time during</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">its perusal, and still find the personages just where she left them, conversing in the cedar parlour, he will probably&nbsp;think there is more justice than D’Israeli seems willing to&nbsp;admit in the cold remark of D’Alembert, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“ La nature est&nbsp;bonne a imiter, mais non pas jusqu' a l'ennui.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is not often that with this feminine character of intellect, a masculine vigour in painting scenes of a passionate and terrible cast is found united, and yet Richardson has&nbsp;proved his mastery over the higher passions, not less than&nbsp;his minute study of sentiment and manners, in the conclusion of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa Harlowe.</span><span class="font1"> To apply to him the epithet of&nbsp;the Shakspeare of prose fiction, winch has been done by&nbsp;D’Israeli, is extravagant. A solitary creation of this kind,&nbsp;highly pathetic and morally impressive as it is, is but a narrow basis on which to rest the claims of the novelist to such&nbsp;a title. But the conception of the noble character of Clarissa&nbsp;Harlowe, set off by such a foil as is afforded by that of Lovelace, perhaps the most finished picture of the self-possessed&nbsp;and insinuating libertine ever drawn, (and certainly as great&nbsp;an improvement on that of the Lothario from which it was&nbsp;drawn, as Rowes’ hero had been on the vulgar rake of&nbsp;Massinger,) and the closing scenes of that novel, are at all&nbsp;events sufficient to place Richardson </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">among</span><span class="font1"> the great&nbsp;writers of fiction ; among the few who have formed a&nbsp;striking and original conception, which they have wrought&nbsp;out with a corresponding felicity and power. It is not the&nbsp;common-place idea of a woman of virtue foiling the schemes&nbsp;of a seducer, which Richardson has undertaken to illustrate :&nbsp;in the case of a lady like Clarissa, of birth, education, and&nbsp;good feelings, Mrs. Barbauld says truly, that would have&nbsp;been no triumph worthy of being recorded by such a pen ;&nbsp;but it is the dignity, the deep interest, he has lent to the&nbsp;character, even in that situation of personal dishonour, witll&nbsp;which, from whatever cause it has arisen, we are apt to&nbsp;connect the idea of degradation. “ There is something,”&nbsp;says Mrs. Barbauld,@@<sup>1</sup> “ in virgin purity, to which the imagination willingly pays homage. In all ages something saintly&nbsp;has been attached to the idea of unblemished chastity, but&nbsp;it was reserved for Richardson to overcome all circumstances&nbsp;of dishonour and disgrace, and to throw a splendour round&nbsp;the violated virgin more radiant than she possessed in her&nbsp;first bloom. He has drawn the triumph of mental chastity ;&nbsp;he has drawn it uncontaminated, untarnished, and incapable&nbsp;of mingling with pollution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The other novels of Richardson, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Charles Grandison,</span><span class="font1"> are ofan inferior order to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa. Pamela,</span><span class="font1"> his&nbsp;first work, besides the questionable character of some of its&nbsp;highly coloured scenes, the license of which leads one to smile&nbsp;at the notions of morality entertained by that literary oracle&nbsp;who declared, “ that if all other books were to be burned, Pamela and the Bible should be preserved,” is justly liable to&nbsp;the objections pointed out by Mrs. Barbauld, that the heroine throughout her probation seems guided as much by&nbsp;wwltlly wisdom as by the love of virtue ; that she acts&nbsp;like one who knows her price, and that her purity is protected more by the chance of securing a rich husband, and&nbsp;the prospect of “the gilded coach and dappled Flanders&nbsp;mares,” w hich she sees in perspective, than by any idea that&nbsp;virtue is its own reward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Least of all, is it possible to relish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir ChαrlesGrαndison, </span><span class="font1">a work written upon an entirely wrong plan ; a system of&nbsp;pedantic morality put in action in the person of a formal, bowing, moralizing hero, “ content to dwell in decencies for ever;” a hero whose worst trial, as Sir Walter&nbsp;Scott observes, is the embarrassment of choosing between&nbsp;two females, both handsome, accomplished, and in love with&nbsp;him ; a gentleman who detests the theory of duelling on&nbsp;Christian principles, but reconciles the practice of it to his&nbsp;conscience, because his skill in swordsmanship always en-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
