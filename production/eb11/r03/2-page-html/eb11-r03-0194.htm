<p><span class="font1">itself deserves attention, and, as it chances, we know much aboSTTf,’ mainly from Polybius. Its elements were three:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(A) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal unit was the legion, generally a division of&nbsp;4500 men—3000 heavy infantry, 1200 Tighter-armed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">^elites),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">300 horse—though sometimes including as many as 6000 men.&nbsp;The heavy infantry were the backbone of the legion. They were&nbsp;levied from the whole body of Roman citizens who had some private&nbsp;means and who had not already served 16 campaigns, and in effect&nbsp;formed a yeoman force, For battle they were divided into 1200&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hastati,</span><span class="font1"> 1200 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">principes</span><span class="font1"> and 600 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">triarii·.</span><span class="font1"> all had a large shield, metal&nbsp;helmet, leather cuirass, short Spanish thrusting and cutting sword,&nbsp;and in addition the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hastati</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">principes</span><span class="font1"> each carried two short&nbsp;heavy throwing spears </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Pila),</span><span class="font1"> while the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">triarii</span><span class="font1"> had ordinary long&nbsp;spears (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arms ano Armour).</span><span class="font1"> They were drawn up in three&nbsp;lines: (1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hastati,</span><span class="font1"> (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">principes,</span><span class="font1"> (3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">triarii·,</span><span class="font1"> the first two were&nbsp;divided into IO maniples each (of 120 men, when the legicn only&nbsp;counted 4500), the third into 10 maniples of half the strength.&nbsp;According to the ordinary interpretation of our ancient authorities,&nbsp;the maniples were arranged in a chess-board fashion </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(quincunx),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the idea being that the front row of maniples could retire through&nbsp;the intervals in the second row without disordering it, and the second&nbsp;row could similarly advance. Recent military writers, however,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">doubt whether this arrangement can be considered workable, and it is possible that our authorities did not really mean what has&nbsp;been supposed. In any case the procedure in fighting seems to&nbsp;have been simple: the front line discharged a volley of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pila</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;rushed in with the short sword—a sequence much like the volley&nbsp;and bayonet charge of the 18th century—and if this failed, the&nbsp;second line went in turn through the same process: the third line&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">triarii,</span><span class="font1"> armed with spear instead of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pilum,</span><span class="font1"> was a reserve. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">velites,</span><span class="font1"> armed with javelins, were either broken up among the heavyarmed centuries or used as skirmishers or as aids to the cavalry.&nbsp;The 300 cavalry, however, were (it seems) of little account—a&nbsp;natural result if, as we have reason to think, the horses were small&nbsp;and stirrups were not used. The officers of the legion consisted of :&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1"> Six tribunes, in part elected by the comitia, in part appointed by&nbsp;the consuls, and holding »command in rotation. They were either&nbsp;veteran officers, sometimes even ex-magistrates, or young noblemen&nbsp;beginning their career, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font1"> Sixty centurions, each commanding&nbsp;one century, or, rather, a pair commanding each maniple. They were&nbsp;chosen by the tribunes from among the veteran soldiers serving at&nbsp;the time and were, arranged in a complicated, hierarchy, by means&nbsp;of which a centurion might move upwards till he became </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">primus&nbsp;pilus,</span><span class="font1"> senior centurion of the first maniple of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">triarii,</span><span class="font1"> the chief officer&nbsp;in the legion, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c)</span><span class="font1"> There were also standard-bearers and other&nbsp;under-officers, for whom reference must be made to specialist&nbsp;publications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(B) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the legions, composed of citizens, the Roman army&nbsp;included contingents from the Italian &quot; allies ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(socii),</span><span class="font1"> subjects of&nbsp;Rome. These contingents appear to have been large: in many&nbsp;armies we find as many </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">socii</span><span class="font1"> as legionaries, but we are ignorant of&nbsp;details. The men were armed and drilled like the legionaries, but&nbsp;they served not in legions butin cohorts, smaller units of 400-500 men,&nbsp;and their conventional positions seem to have been on the wings of&nbsp;the legions. They were principally infantry, but included also a&nbsp;fairly large proportion of cavalry. Despite their numbers, they&nbsp;do not appear to have ranked with the heavy legionary infantry,&nbsp;and they were probably used more as detachments from the main&nbsp;army than, as infantry of the line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(C) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides legionaries and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">socii,</span><span class="font1"> the Roman army included&nbsp;non-Italian troops of special kinds, Balearic slingers, Numidian&nbsp;horsemen, Rhodians, Celtiberians and others: at Trasimene, for&nbsp;example (217 </span><span class="font0">B.C.), </span><span class="font1">the Roman army included 600 Cretan archers.&nbsp;The numbers of these </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auxilia</span><span class="font1"> varied; probably they were not&nbsp;numerous till the latest days of the Republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Composition and Size of Armies in the Second Stage.—</span><span class="font1">According to the general practice, each of the two consuls, if he took the&nbsp;field alone, commanded an army of two legions with appropriate&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">socii.</span><span class="font1"> If the two. consuls combined their forces, commanding the&nbsp;joint force in rotation (as often occurred), the total would be—according to our authorities—four legions, each of 4200 infantry, the same&nbsp;number of “ allied ” infantry (in all 33,600 infantry), 1200 legionary&nbsp;cavalry and about 3600 &quot; allied ” cavalry = 38,400 men. Such, for&nbsp;example, was the Roman army at Trebia (218 </span><span class="font0">B.C.), </span><span class="font1">where (says&nbsp;Polybius) there fought 16,000 legionaries and 20,000 allied infantry.&nbsp;The total number of men in the field could be increased; we even&nbsp;hear of 23 legions serving at one time in the Second Punic War.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Just before this war, in 225 B.c., the total strength of Rome was reckoned at three-quarters of a million, of which about 65,000 were&nbsp;in the field and 55,000 were in a reserve at Rome; of the total,&nbsp;325,000 were Roman citizens and 4^3,000 (apparently a rough&nbsp;estimate) were allies. The battle order in normal circumstances&nbsp;was simple. In the centre stood the legionary infantry: on each&nbsp;side of that was the allied infantry: on the wings the cavalry.&nbsp;But sometimes the legions were held in reserve and the brunt (and&nbsp;honour) of the fight was left to the allies. Sometimes, when the&nbsp;army was a double force, one commander’s troops fought and the&nbsp;others lay in reserve. Frequently the attack was begun by one&nbsp;wing, as by Caesar at Pharsalus. At Ilipa in Spain Scipio put his&nbsp;Spanish auxiliaries in the centre, his Roman troops on the wings,&nbsp;and attacked with both wings. The chief command of the army&nbsp;fell (as stated above) to the consul, if present, or, if two consuls&nbsp;acted together, to them in turn. In default of consuls, a pro-consul, praetor, or propraetor, in charge of a province, would&nbsp;command.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Development from the Second Stage to the Third.</span><span class="font1">—Towards the end of the Republic many changes began to work themselves out in the Roman army. If Camillus began the system&nbsp;of pay and long service, it was effectually developed by long&nbsp;foreign wars in Spain and in the East. Moreover, the growth&nbsp;of Rome as a wealthy state tended to wreck the old theory&nbsp;that every citizen was a soldier, and favoured a division of&nbsp;labour between (i.g.) the merchant and the military, while&nbsp;the increasing complexity of war required a longer training and&nbsp;a more professional soldier. In consequence, the old restriction&nbsp;of legionary service to men with some sort of private property&nbsp;was abolished by Marius about 104 </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> and the legionaries&nbsp;now became wholly proletariate and professionals. By a&nbsp;second change, also connected with the name of. Marius, the&nbsp;legion was reorganized as a body of 6000 men in 60 centuries,&nbsp;divided into 10 cohorts instead of (as hitherto) into 30&nbsp;maniples; the unit of tactical action thus became a body of&nbsp;600 instead of 120. This was probably an adaptation within&nbsp;the legion of the system of cohorts already in use for the contingents of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">socii.</span><span class="font1"> Soon after, the extension of the Roman&nbsp;franchise to all Italians converted allies and subjects into&nbsp;citizens, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">socii</span><span class="font1"> into legionaries. A fourth change&nbsp;abolished the legionary cavalry and greatly increased the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auxilia</span><span class="font1"> (C above). And, finally, the appearance of great&nbsp;military leaders in place of civilian statesmen, and of pretenders&nbsp;to a throne in place of patriots, familiarizëd the world with the&nbsp;notion of large standing armies commanded by permanent&nbsp;chiefs, and at the same time destroyed discipline and military&nbsp;loyalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Third Stage.—The Imperial Army of Defence.—</span><span class="font1">The evils of the Civil Wars (49-31 </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font1"> furnished the first emperor, Augustus,,&nbsp;with both the opportunity and the necessity for reforming the&nbsp;army. Disorganization had reigned for twenty years. It was&nbsp;needful to restore loyalty and system alike. Augustus did&nbsp;this, as he did all his work, by adapting the past: yet there is.&nbsp;some truth in the view of his latest historian, von Domaszewski,&nbsp;that his army reforms were his greatest and most original work.&nbsp;The main lines of his work are simple. The Imperial army&nbsp;consisted henceforward of two classes or grades of troops,,&nbsp;about equal in numbers if unequal in importance. The first&nbsp;grade were the legions, recruited from Roman citizens, whether&nbsp;resident in Italy or in the provinces. The second grade w<sup>r</sup>as&nbsp;formed by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auxilia,</span><span class="font1"> recruited from the subjects (not the&nbsp;citizens) of the Empire in the provinces, organized in cohorts&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">alae</span><span class="font1"> and corresponding somewhat to both the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">socii</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;the auxiliaries (B, C above) of the Republican army. There&nbsp;were also in Rome special “ household” troops (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Praetorians),</span><span class="font1"> and a large body of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vigiles</span><span class="font1"> who were both fire brigade&nbsp;and police.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(A) The legion of the Empire was what Marius had left it— 6000 heavy infantry divided into 10 cohorts: Augustus added&nbsp;only 120 horsemen to serve as despatch-riders and the like. The&nbsp;supreme command was no longer in the hands of the six tribunes.&nbsp;According to a practice which had sprung up in the latest Republic&nbsp;it vzas in the hands of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iegatus legionis,</span><span class="font1"> deputy of the general (now&nbsp;of the emperor, commander-in-chief of the whole army) and a&nbsp;man usually of senatorial rank and position. The six tribunes&nbsp;assisted him, in theory.: in practice they were now little more than&nbsp;young men of good birth learning their business or wasting their</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
