<p><label>RÉJANE, GABRIELLE</label>
[Charlotte Reju] (1857- ), French actress, was born in Paris, the daughter of an actor. She was a pupil of Rcgnier at the Conservatoire, and took the second prize for comedy in 1874. Her <hi rend="italic">debut</hi> was made the next year, during which she played attractively a number of light— especially soubrette—parts. Her first great success was in Henri Meilhac’s <hi rend="italic">Ma camarade</hi> (1883), and she soon became known as an emotional actress of rare gifts, notably in <hi rend="italic">Decorê, Germinie Lacerteux, Ma cousine. Amoureuse</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lysistrata.</hi> In 1892 she married M. Porel, the director of the Vaudeville theatre, but the marriage was dissolved in 1905. Her performances in <hi rend="italic">Madame Sans Gène</hi> (1893) made her as well known in England and America as in Paris, and in later years she appeared in characteristic parts in both countries, being particularly successful in <hi rend="italic">Zaza</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La Passerelle.</hi> She opened the Theatre Rejane in Paris in 1906. The essence of French vivacity and animated expression appeared to be concentrated in Madame Réjane’s acting, and made her Unrivalledintheparts which she had made her own.</p>
