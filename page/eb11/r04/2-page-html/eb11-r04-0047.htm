<p><span class="font0">thereof condemn N. N.,” and so on.<sup>@@1</sup> Once this point was attained further progress was comparatively easy, the way being open for&nbsp;the construction of formulae upon illiquid claims arising from transactions in which the practice of stipulation gradually dropped out&nbsp;of use, till at last the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidei indicia</span><span class="font0"> were reached, marked by&nbsp;the presence in the “ intention<sup>T</sup>' of the words </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ex fide bona—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">“ whatever in respect thereof N. N. ought in good faith to give to or&nbsp;do for A. A.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the case of real actions the transition from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis aetiones </span><span class="font0">to the formulae followed a different course. The Aebutian law,&nbsp;while sanctioning the competency of formulae, did not&nbsp;interfere with the procedure </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per sacramentum</span><span class="font0"> when&nbsp;reference was to be to the centumviral court on a question of quintarían right. In the time of Cicero that court&nbsp;was apparently still in full activity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(supra),</span><span class="font0"> but by that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of Gaius, owing, it is supposed, to the Julian laws having made formulae in most cases compulsory, it was rarely resorted to except for trial of questions of inheritance. In his time questions of&nbsp;property were raised either </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per sponsionem</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per fortnulam peti-toriam.</span><span class="font0"> The procedure by sponsion may be regarded as a sort of&nbsp;bridge between the sacramental process and the petitory </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vindi*&nbsp;catio.</span><span class="font0"> In it the question of real right was determined only indirectly. The plaintiff required the defendant to give him his&nbsp;stipulatory promise to pay. a nominal sum of twenty-five sesterces&nbsp;in the event of the thing in dispute being found to belong to the&nbsp;former; and at the.same time the defendant gave sureties for its&nbsp;transfer to the plaintiff, with all fruits and profits, in the same&nbsp;event. The formula that was adjusted and remitted to a judge&nbsp;raised </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ex facie</span><span class="font0"> only the simple question whether the twenty-five&nbsp;sesterces were due or not: the action was in form a personal, not a&nbsp;real one, and was therefore appropriately remitted to a single </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judex&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">instead of to the centumviral tribunal. But judgment on it could&nbsp;be reached only through means of a finding </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(sententia)</span><span class="font0"> on the question&nbsp;of real right; if it was for the plaintiff, he did not claim the amount&nbsp;of the sponsion, but the thing which had been found to be his;&nbsp;and, if the defendant delayed to deliver it, with its fruits and profits, the plaintiff had recourse against the latter’s sureties. The&nbsp;petitory formula, was undoubtedly of later introduction and much&nbsp;more straightforward. Like the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">condictio certae pecuniae,</span><span class="font0"> it contained only “intention” and “condemnation/<sup>1</sup> It ran thus:&nbsp;“ Titius be judge. Should it appear that the slave Stichus, about&nbsp;whom this action has been raised, belongs to A. A. in quiritary&nbsp;right, then, unless the slave be restored, whatever be his value,&nbsp;in that you will condemn N. N. to A. A.; should it not so appear,&nbsp;you will acquit him.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The formulae given above, whether applicable to real or personal actions, are so many illustrations of tne class known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">formulae&nbsp;juris civilis</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in jus conceptae.</span><span class="font0"> The characteristic of&nbsp;such a formula was that it contained in the “ intention ”&nbsp;such phrases as the following—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ejus esse ex jure Quiritium,&nbsp;praestare oportere,<sup>@@2</sup> dare oportere, dare facere oportere,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">damnum decidere oportere.<sup>@@3</sup> </span><span class="font0">Such words were employed where the right to be vindicated or the obligation to&nbsp;be enforced had. its sanction directly in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font0"> whether&nbsp;in the shape of statute, consuetude or interpretation. Where, on&nbsp;the other hand, the right or obligation had its sanction solely&nbsp;from the praetor’s edict, special formulae, had to be framed.. The&nbsp;actions employed in such cases were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aetiones juris honorarii,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;these either </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aetiones utiles</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aetiones in factum.</span><span class="font0"> The first were&nbsp;adaptations of actions of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font0"> to cases that, did not properly fall within them; the second were actions entirely of praetorian devising, for the protection of rights or redress of wrongs</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Utilis actio</span><span class="font0"> may be translated as analogous or adapted action, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> analogous to a direct action. Where a direct action was inapplicable to pdrticular cases or persons, according to&nbsp;the terms of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex,</span><span class="font0"> edict, &amp;c., the praetor frequently&nbsp;adapted the statute, &amp;c., to such cases and persons by&nbsp;granting an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio utilis.</span><span class="font0"> He did so where he thought them to be&nbsp;within the spirit though not the letter of the law. He effected his&nbsp;object, commonly by a modification of the regular formula either&nbsp;objectively, as by adding, or omitting, or altering words, or subjectively by transposing names of parties. But sometimes also&nbsp;the adaptation was maae by the introduction of a legal fiction into&nbsp;the regular formula, and in this case the action was called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">utilis&nbsp;fictitia</span><span class="font0">or simply </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fictitia.</span><span class="font0"> The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aetiones utiles</span><span class="font0"> might, therefore, be of&nbsp;two kinds, ordinary and fictitious. Those of common occurrence&nbsp;early became stereotyped in the Edict and even got special names.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As illustrations of .an ordinary </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio utilis,</span><span class="font0"> in which the formula was objectively modified, reference may be made to the numerous&nbsp;actions for wrongful damage to property under the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex&nbsp;Aquilia.</span><span class="font0"> Thus this statute in its first chapter used the&nbsp;term </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oceidere,</span><span class="font0"> which means killing by a physical act of violence&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(corpore corpori),</span><span class="font0"> but to meet cases of Killing without violence&nbsp;(c.g. by poison) the praetors simply substituted the words </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mortis&nbsp;causam praestare</span><span class="font0"> for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oceidere</span><span class="font0"> in the formula. As illustrations of&nbsp;an ordinary </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio utilis</span><span class="font0"> with subjective transposition of names, we&nbsp;may mention the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio Rutiliana</span><span class="font0"> applicable to a purchaser of the&nbsp;bankrupt estate of a living debtor, the action by an assignee of a&nbsp;debt against the debtor, and the action of a procurator suing for&nbsp;his principal. In these the names of. the bankrupt, cedent and&nbsp;principal respectively appeared in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">intentio,</span><span class="font0"> while the plaintiff’s&nbsp;name was inserted in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">condemnatio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Resort to a fiction is sometimes said to be a confession of weakness, and adversely criticized accordingly. But every amendment on&nbsp;the law is an. admission of defect in w hat is being amended;&nbsp;and it was in sympathy with the spirit of Roman jurisprudence, when it found an action too narrow Jn its definition, to include some new case that ought to fall within it,&nbsp;rather by feigning that the new case was the same as the old, to&nbsp;bring it within the scope of the existing and familiar action, than&nbsp;to cause disturbance by. either altering the definition of the latter&nbsp;or introducing an entirely new remedy. A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessor&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">held a position unknown to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile*,</span><span class="font0"> he was not an heir, and&nbsp;therefore not entitled offhand to employ the actions competent&nbsp;to an heir, either for recovering the property of the defunct or&nbsp;proceeding against his debtors. The praetor could have had no&nbsp;difficulty in devising new actions to meet his case; but he preferred&nbsp;the simpler expedient of adapting to it an heir’s actions, by introducing into the formula a fiction of civil heirship; so he did with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum emptor</span><span class="font0"> or purchaser of a deceased bankrupt’s estate at&nbsp;the sale of it in mass by his creditors. A peregrin could not sue&nbsp;or be sued for the penalties imposed for theft or culpable damage&nbsp;to property, for the XII. Tables and the Aquilian law applied only&nbsp;to citizens; but he could both sue and be sued under cover of a&nbsp;fiction of citizenship. A man who had acquired a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font0"> on&nbsp;a good title, but without taking a conveyance by mancipation or&nbsp;surrender in court, if he was dispossessed before he had completed&nbsp;his usucapion, could not sue a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rci vindicatio</span><span class="font0"> for its. recovery, for&nbsp;he was not in a position to affirm that he was quiritarian owner;&nbsp;neither, for the same reason, could a man who in good faith and on&nbsp;a sufficient title had acquired a thing from one who was not in a&nbsp;position to alienate it. But in both cases the praetor granted him&nbsp;w hat was in effect a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rei vindicatio</span><span class="font0"> proceeding on a fiction of completed&nbsp;usucapion—the Publician .action referred to on p. 556. These are&nbsp;examples of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aetiones fictitiae</span><span class="font0">—actions of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font0"> adapted by&nbsp;this very simple expedient to cases, to which otherwise they would&nbsp;have been inapplicable, and forming one of the most important&nbsp;varieties of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aetiones utiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Quite different was the course of procedure in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aetiones in factum,</span><span class="font0"> whose number and varieties were practically unlimited,&nbsp;although for the most part granted in pursuance of the praetor’s&nbsp;promise in the edict that under such and such circumstances he&nbsp;would make a remit to a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judex (judicium dabo),<sup>@@5</sup> </span><span class="font0">and formulated in&nbsp;accordance with the relative skeleton styles also published on the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">album.
