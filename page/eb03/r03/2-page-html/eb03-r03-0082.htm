<p><span class="font0">RUM, a ſpecies of brandy or vinous ſpirits, diſtilled from ſugar-canes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rum, according to Dr Shaw, differs from ſimple fugar-ſpirit, in that it contains more of the natural flavour or eſſential oil of the ſugar-cane ; a great deal of&nbsp;raw juice and parts of the cane itſelf being often fermented in the liquor or ſolution of which the rum is&nbsp;prepared. The unctuous or oily flavour of rum is often&nbsp;ſuppoſed to proceed from the large quantity of fat&nbsp;uſed in boiling the ſugar ; wſhich fat, indeed, if coarſe,&nbsp;will uſually give a ſtinking flavour to the ſpirit in our&nbsp;diſtillations of the ſugar liquor or waft, from our refining ſugar-houſes ;, but this is nothing of kin to the&nbsp;flavour of the rum, which is really the effect of the&nbsp;natural flavour of the cane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The method of making rum is this : When a ſuſſicient ſtock of the materials are got together, they add water to them, and ferment them in the common method, though the fermentation is always carried on&nbsp;very ſlewly at firſt ; becauſe at the beginning of the&nbsp;ſeaſon for making rum in the iſlands, they want yeaſt&nbsp;or fome other ferment to make it work : but by degrees, after this, they procure a ſuſſicient quantity of&nbsp;the ferment, which riſes up as a head to the liquor in&nbsp;the operation ; and thus they are able afterwards to&nbsp;ferment and make their rum with a great deal of expedition, and in large quantities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the waſh is fully fermented, or to a due degree of acidity, the diſtillation is carried on in the. common&nbsp;way, and the ſpirit is made up proof : though ſometimes it is reduced to a much greater ſtrength, nearly&nbsp;approaching to that of alcohol or ſpirit of wine ; and&nbsp;it is then called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">double-diβilled rum.</span><span class="font0"> It might be eaſy&nbsp;to rectify the ſpirit, and bring it to much greater purity than we uſually find it to be of : for it brings over&nbsp;in the diſtillation a very large quantity of the oil ; and&nbsp;this is often ſo diſagreeable, that the rum muſt be ſuf-Iered to lie by a long time to mellow before it can be&nbsp;uſed ; whereas, if well rectified, it would grow mellow&nbsp;much ſooner, and would have a much leſs potent flavour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The beſt ſtate to keep rum in, both ſor exportation and other uſes, is doubtleſs. that of alcohol or rectified ſpirit. In this manner it would be tranſported in&nbsp;one half the bulk it uſually is, and might be let down&nbsp;to the common proof-ſtrengtſh with water when neceſſary : for the common uſe of making punch, it would&nbsp;likewiſe ſerve much better' in the ſtate of alcohol ; as.&nbsp;the taſte would be cleaner, and the ſtrength might always be regulated to a much greater exactneſs than&nbsp;in the ordinary way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The only uſe to which, it would not ſo well ſerve in this ſtate, would be the common practice of adulteration among our diſtillers ; for when they want to mix a&nbsp;large portion of cheaper ſpirit with the rum, their bufineſs is to have it of the proof-ſtrength, and as full of&nbsp;the flavouring oil as they can, that it may drown the&nbsp;flavour of the ſpirits they mix with it, and extend its&nbsp;o,wn. If the bufineſs of rectifying rum was more nicely&nbsp;managed, it ſeems a very practicable ſcheme to throw&nbsp;out ſo much of the oil, as to have it in the fine light&nbsp;ſtate of a clear ſpirit, but lightly impregnated with it :&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">this caſe </span><span class="font1">it would very nearly reſemble </span><span class="font0">arac, </span><span class="font1">as is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">proved by the mixing a very ſmall quantity </span><span class="font1">oſ it with </span><span class="font0">a taſteleſs ſpirit, in which caſe the whole bears a very&nbsp;near reſemblance to arac in flavour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rum is uſually very much adulterated in Britain ; ſome are ſo bare-faced as to do it with malt-ſpirit ;&nbsp;but when it is done with molaffes ſpirit, the taſtes of&nbsp;both are ſo nearly allied, that it is not eaſily diſcovered. The beſt method of judging of it is by ſetting&nbsp;fire to a little of it ; and, when it has burnt away all&nbsp;the inflammable part, examining the phlegm both by&nbsp;the taſte and ſmell.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUMEX, dock, in botany : A genus of the trigy-nia order, belonging to the hexandria claſs of plants </span><span class="font1">j </span><span class="font0">and in the natural method ranking under the 12th order, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Holorαce&lt;t.</span><span class="font0"> The calyx is- triphyllous ; there are&nbsp;three connivent petals, and one triquetrous ſeed. There&nbsp;are 27 ſpecies ; of which the moſt remarkable are,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The patientia, commonly called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patience rhubarb.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">This was formerly much more cultivated in the Britiſh&nbsp;gardens than at preſent: the.roots of this have been generally uſed for the monk’s rhubarb, and has even been&nbsp;thought to be the true kind ; but others ſuppoſe the&nbsp;ſecond fort ſhould be uſed as ſuch. The root rs large,&nbsp;and divides into many thick fibres ; their outer cover is&nbsp;brown, but they are yellow within, with ſome reddiſh&nbsp;veins; the leaves are broad, long, and acute-pointed;&nbsp;their footſtalks are of a reddiſh colour ; the ſtalks riſe&nbsp;ſix or ſeven ſeet high, aud divide towards the top into&nbsp;ſeveral erect branches garniſhed with a few narrowdeaves&nbsp;terminating with looſe ſpikes oſ large ſtaminous flowers.&nbsp;Theſe appear in June, and are ſucceeded by pretty large&nbsp;three-cornered ſeeds, whoſe coverings are entire, which&nbsp;ripen, i« autumn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The alpinus, or monk’s rhubarb, grows naturally&nbsp;on the Alps, but has ∙long been cultivated in the gardens&nbsp;of this country. This hath large roots which ſpread&nbsp;and multiply by their offsets : they are ſhorter and&nbsp;thicker than the former, are of a very dark brown on&nbsp;the outſide, and yellow within. The leaves are of the&nbsp;round heart-ſhape, ſtanding upon long footſtalks. The&nbsp;ſtalks riſe from two to three feet high ; they are thick,&nbsp;and have a few ſmall roundiſh leaves:on the lower part;·&nbsp;but the upper part is cloſely garniſhed with ſpikes of&nbsp;white flowers ſtanding erect cloſe to the ſtalks. Theſe&nbsp;appear in the latter end of May, and are ſucceeded by&nbsp;large triangular ſeeds which ripen in Auguſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The aquaticus, or water-dock, grows naturally inponds, ditches, and ſtanding waters, in many parts of'&nbsp;Britain. It is ſuppoſed- to be the herba Britannica of&nbsp;the ancients. It hath large roots which ſtrike deep'&nbsp;into the looſe mud, ſending out leaves which are above»&nbsp;two feet long.
