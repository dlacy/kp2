            <p><span class="font0">though we cannot subscribe to his view that the artist calculated
                    the effect of natural illumination upon the relief, it remains&nbsp;true that
                    they are eminently pictorial compositions in respect&nbsp;of their depth of
                    focus, yet without sacrifice of plastic effect&nbsp;(Plate II. fig. 14). So far
                    as bas-relief is concerned, the&nbsp;problem of representing form in open space
                    is here solved.&nbsp;Equally admirable in technique, though of less
                    historical&nbsp;importance, are the circular medallions </span><span

                    which now&nbsp;adorn the Arch of Constantine, but originally belonged&nbsp;(as
                    the present writer has shown)@@<sup>1</sup> to a monument of the&nbsp;Flavian
                    period, perhaps the “ temple of the Flavian house ”&nbsp;erected by Domitian.
                    The one shown (Plate III. fig. 18)&nbsp;is remarkable in that the head of the
                    emperor has been replaced&nbsp;by a portrait, not of Constantine, but (in all
                    probability) of&nbsp;Claudius Gothicus </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font0"> 268-70), who
                    was the first to divert&nbsp;these sculptures from their original
                    destination.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">Flavian portraits,@@<sup>2</sup> of which two are here figured,—a
                    bust of Vespasian in the Museo delle Terme (Plate I. fig. 4) and a&nbsp;bust,
                    now in the Lateran, found in the tomb of the IIaterii,&nbsp;which, as is shown
                    by the snake, represents a physician&nbsp;(Plate I. fig. 5),—must rank as the
                    masterpieces of Roman&nbsp;art. Their extraordinarily lifelike character is due
                    to the fact&nbsp;that the artist, without accumulating unnecessary detail,
                    has&nbsp;contrived to catch the characteristic expression of his
                    subject,&nbsp;and to render it with the utmost technical virtuosity.
                    These&nbsp;portraits differ from the works of the Greek masters, who
                    always&nbsp;subordinated the individual to the type, and therefore gave&nbsp;a
                    less complete impression of reality than the Roman artists.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">The same tendency has been noted in ornamental work which may be
                    dated to the Flavian period. Wickhoff selected&nbsp;a pilaster from the monument
                    of the Haterii (Plate II. fig. 15)&nbsp;upon which a column entwined with roses
                    is carved. The&nbsp;flowers are not in fact represented with precise fidelity
                    to&nbsp;nature, but the illusion of reality is no less great than in
                    more&nbsp;accurately worked examples.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">Roman sculpture soon passed the zenith of its achievement. We are
                    not able to assign any historical monuments to the&nbsp;earlier years of
                    Trajan’s reign, but the portraits of the emperor&nbsp;betray a certain hardness
                    of touch which makes them less&nbsp;interesting than those of the Flavian
                    period. To the latter&nbsp;part of the reign belong a number of monuments
                    which&nbsp;represent Trajanic art at its best. First and foremost come&nbsp;the
                    reliefs, colossal in scale, which appear to have decorated&nbsp;the walls of
                    Trajan’s Forum. Four slabs were removed by&nbsp;Constantine’s order and used to
                    adorn the central passage&nbsp;and the shorter sides of the attic of his arch.
                    The first of&nbsp;these (Plate II. fig. 16) shows the victorious charge of
                    the&nbsp;Roman cavalry, with the emperor at its head, against their&nbsp;Dacian
                    enemies. Other fragments of this frieze are extant&nbsp;in the
                        Louvre,@@<sup>3</sup> and a much-restored relief, walled up in
                    the&nbsp;garden of the Villa Medici, shows a Dacian on horseback&nbsp;swimming
                    the Danube with Trajan’s Bridge in the background.&nbsp;The composition of the
                    battle-scene is very fine, and the heads&nbsp;of the Dacians are full of
                    character; but, although details&nbsp;of armour, &amp;c., are carefully and
                    accurately reproduced, we&nbsp;see clear signs of technical decadence, both in
                    the fact that&nbsp;the human eye is in many cases represented as though in
                    full&nbsp;face on heads which are shown in profile, and also in the
                    naïve&nbsp;attempt to render several files of troops in perspective
                    by&nbsp;means of superposed rows of heads.@@<sup>4</sup> The reliefs of the

                    style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> we find&nbsp;the
                    suicide of the Dacian king Decebalus represented in&nbsp;precisely the same way

                    representing&nbsp;a battle between Greeks and Gauls; again, the symmetry
                    of&nbsp;the scene in which the fall of Sarmizegetusa (the Dacian&nbsp;capital)
                    is depicted recalls that of Greek monuments—&nbsp;particularly the painting of
                    the fall of Troy by Polygnotus,&nbsp;described by Pausanias at Delphi. But the
                    loving care with&nbsp;which the arms and accoutrements of the Roman
                    troops—&nbsp;both regular and irregular—are rendered@@<sup>5</sup> betrays
                    the&nbsp;nationality of the artist; and his technical
                    deficiencies,&nbsp;especially in the matter of perspective, point in the
                    same&nbsp;direction. It seems probable, moreover, that the
                    artistic&nbsp;conception of a column ornamented with a band of relief
                    was&nbsp;new, and that the designer had to find his own solution for&nbsp;the
                    problem. We find, in fact, that he tells his story in more&nbsp;than one way:
                    </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span
                    class="font0"> Considerable portions of the narrative,&nbsp;</span><span
                    class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0">
                    Trajan’s march in the opening campaign, consist in a&nbsp;series of isolated and
                    successive scenes; the divisions are&nbsp;usually marked by some conventional
                    means, such as the&nbsp;insertion of a tree, or a change of direction in the
                    action,&nbsp;(ά) At other times the scenes unfold themselves against
                    a&nbsp;continuous background, and merge almost insensibly into&nbsp;those which
                    succeed them; to this form of narrative the&nbsp;term “ continuous style,”
                    brought into use by Wickhoff, more&nbsp;properly applies, (c) The direct
                    progress of the narrative&nbsp;is sometimes broken by passages which can only be
                    called&nbsp;“ panoramic the great composition showing the siege and&nbsp;fall of

            <p><span class="font0">The reliefs (as already indicated) tell the story of both of
                    Trajan’s wars with the Dacians, a formal division between the&nbsp;two
                    narratives being made by a figure of Victory setting up a&nbsp;trophy; and the
                    design of the second series shows a decided&nbsp;advance in artistic and
                    dramatic effect on that of the first.&nbsp;Clearly the artist learnt the laws of
                    composition applicable to&nbsp;his problem in the course of his work.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">Before leaving the Trajanic period a word must be said as to the
                    arch erected at Benevento (see </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-variant:small-caps;">Triumphal Arch,</span><span class="font0"> fig.
                    2),&nbsp;from which point a new road—the Via Trajana—ran to Brun-disium. The
                    inscription on this arch bears the date </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font0"> 114,&nbsp;but
                    the prominence given to Hadrian has led to the supposition&nbsp;that the reliefs
                    were executed after his accession. We have&nbsp;already noted that the use of
                    relief as ornament is here carried&nbsp;to excess in the artist’s desire to
                    present a summary of Trajan’s&nbsp;achievements at home and
                        abroad.@@<sup>6</sup> The arrangement of the&nbsp;panels is calculated and
                    significant. On the side which faces&nbsp;the town of Benevento the subjects
                    have reference to Trajan’s&nbsp;work in Rome. On the attic we see, to the left,
                    a group of&nbsp;gods with the Capitoline triad—Jupiter, Juno and
                    Minerva—&nbsp;in the foreground; to the right, Trajan welcomed at the
                    entrance&nbsp;to the Capitol by the goddess Roma, the penates and the consuls.
                    He is accompanied by Hadrian, who is designated by&nbsp;the gesture of Roma as
                    the emperor’s successor. The two&nbsp;lowest panels likewise form a single
                    picture. To the right&nbsp;Trajan appears at the entrance of the Forum, where he
                    is&nbsp;welcomed by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"

                    civil&nbsp;aspects of Trajan’s government—veterans to left, merchants&nbsp;to
