<p><label>ROHILCUND</label>
in Sanscrit <hi rend="italic">Kuttair</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kuttaher,</hi> an extensive and valuable district of Hindustan, situated between the rivers Ganges and Goggra, and between the twenty-eighth and thirtieth degrees of north latitude, and from seventy-eight to eighty east longitude. It is extremely well watered by the rivers Ganges and Ramgunga. The latter traverses the country throughout its whole extent, and joins the Ganges at Kanoge. Many smaller streams intersect the country, and contribute to its fertility, being distributed by means of canals and reservoirs. Water is also found by digging a foot under ground. With all these advantages, this country is remarkably fertile, and was extremely productive and well cultivated under its native sovereigns, though, when it was ceded to the British in 1801 by the nabob of Oude, it was in a state of desolation, owing to his tyranny and extortion. It abundantly produces grain of all sorts, sugar-cane, indigo, cotton, and tobacco. It also contains large forests of valuable timber, the wood of which is floated down the Dewall or Goggra, which issues from the Kemaon Mountains, and runs past the town of Pillibeet, and is thence embarked for Patna, Calcutta, and other large towns in the south. Its chief towns are Bareilly, Bis-sowly, Budavon, Moradabad, Owlah, Pillibeet, Rampore, Sumbul, with several others. In the early history of the Mogul empire, Rohilcund is celebrated as a very flourishing country, and of great political importance ; and in many parts are still to be seen the remains of magnificent edifices, palaces, gardens, mosques, colleges, and mausoleums. In more recent times this district was occupied by a number of Afghans of the tribe of Roh or Rohillas. Tbe founders of the dynasty were two brothers, named Shah Aalum, and Hussein Khan, who quitted Afghanistan about the year 1673, and settled in this country, where they pursued some inconsiderable employments under the <hi rend="sub">z</hi> Emperor Aurungzebe. Their descendants acquired possession of a considerable territory, which they ruled with prudence and moderation ; and their territories were cultivated like a garden. A quarrel ensued between them and the nabob of Oude, to whose vengeance they were consigned by the British, who sent troops to aid in their extermination, under the understood condition that they were to share in the spoil. They were defeated by the British troops ; and their country, given up to fire and</p>

Under Fyzoola Khan, one of the eons of Aly Mohammed, the country was in a most flourishing condition ; and several of the Rohilla chiefs resided in each of the large towns, where they lived in a princely and hospitable manner, and gave every protection and encouragement to the farmers, so that the revenue amounted to a million sterling ; but under the waste and ruin of this cruel invasion the revenue decreased in the course of twenty years to L.400,000, and the country went gradually to ruin. The country was transferred to the British in 1801, and is now governed by a civil establishment of officers stationed at Bareilly.</p>
