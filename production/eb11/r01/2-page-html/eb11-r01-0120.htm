<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Girolamo Giuseppe (1555-1611), the son of Paolo, was born at Venice in 1555. He entered the public service in&nbsp;1577, and was employed in connexion with various foreign&nbsp;missions.

<p><span class="font1">RANADE, MAHADEO GOVIND (1842-1901), Indian lawyer, reformer and author, was born on the 16th of January 1842 at&nbsp;Niphad, in Nasik district, of a Chitpavan Brahman family.&nbsp;When his father was minister at Kolhapur he attended the&nbsp;Anglo-vernacular school in that town, and joined the Elphin-stone Institute in Bombay at the age of fourteen. He was one&nbsp;of the first graduates of the Bombay University, taking the B.A.&nbsp;in 1862 and the LL.B. in 1866. Having entered government&nbsp;service he became presidency magistrate and then fourth judge&nbsp;of the small cause court at Bombay in 1871, first-class sub-judge&nbsp;at Poona in 1873, and judge of the Poona small cause court in&nbsp;1884, after which, as special judge under the Deccan Agriculturists’ Relief Act from 1887, he came into close contact with the&nbsp;difficulties of the agrarian classes. In 1886 he was a member of&nbsp;the finance committee appointed to report on the expenditure,&nbsp;both imperial and provincial, with a view to retrenchment. This&nbsp;service won him the decoration of C.I.E. He became a member&nbsp;of the legislative council of Bombay in 1885, and occupied that&nbsp;position until raised to the high court in 1893. Being an&nbsp;energetic social reformer, he directed his efforts against infant&nbsp;marriages, the shaving of widows, the heavy cost of marriages&nbsp;and other social functions, and the caste restrictions on travelling&nbsp;abroad. He strenuously advocated widow remarriage and&nbsp;female education. He was the founder of the social conference&nbsp;movement, which he supported till his death. In the political&nbsp;sphere he founded the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, through which&nbsp;be frequently helped the government with sound advice. He&nbsp;was also one of the originators of the Indian National Congress. In Bombay University, where he held the offices of&nbsp;syndic and dean in arts, he displayed much organizing power&nbsp;and great intimacy with the needs of the student class. Himself a thorough Mahratti scholar, he encouraged the translation&nbsp;of standard English works, and tried, with some success, to&nbsp;introduce vernacular languages into the university curriculum.&nbsp;Though reared in the strictest tenets of Hinduism, his deep&nbsp;religious feeling and trained intellect craved something higher&nbsp;and broader than he could find in the traditional forms and&nbsp;orthodox teaching of his race. The same spiritual want being&nbsp;felt by many enlightened Hindus, he joined with his friends, Dr&nbsp;Atmaram Pandurang, Bal Mangesh Wagle and Vaman Abaji&nbsp;Modak, in founding a new sect in Bombay known as the “ Par-thana Samaj.” This community resembles, in all essential&nbsp;points, the Brahma Samaj of Bengal. Its principles of enlightened theism are based on the ancient Vedas. He published</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">books on Indian economics and on Mahratta history. He died on the 16th of January 1901. He left no children, but his widow&nbsp;continued his work of social and educational reform at Poona.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RANAVALO (Ranavalona) III. (1864- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), the last queen</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of Madagascar, born in 1864, was a great-niece of Radama I. Her name originally was Razàfindrahèty, but on succeeding to&nbsp;the throne of Madagascar after the death of Queen Ranavalo II.,&nbsp;on the 14th of July 1883, she assumed the style of Ranavalo III.&nbsp;Although nominally queen, she took no share in the government,&nbsp;which her prime minister, Rainilaiarivony, had controlled&nbsp;since 1864. After placing her on the throne, he married her&nbsp;before the close of the year. Ranavalo became queen just after&nbsp;the French had revived their claim to a protectorate over the&nbsp;island. The Hova government refusing to admit the claim, war&nbsp;broke out, and several sharp engagements took place. The&nbsp;French bombarded the coast towns, but were unable to reach the&nbsp;interior of the island, where the strength of the Hova lay. In&nbsp;December 1885 a treaty was concluded by which it was agreed&nbsp;that the government of the French Republic should represent&nbsp;Madagascar in all foreign relations, but that in internal matters&nbsp;the Hova government should be independent, as formerly.&nbsp;During the next ten years French influence was quietly extended&nbsp;over the island, in spite of the efforts of Rainilaiarivony, who&nbsp;pursued an anti-French policy, encouraging English and American planters and traders. In 1894 differences on commercial&nbsp;and territorial questions arose between the Hova government&nbsp;and the French, which terminated in war. In 1893 a well-organized expedition was despatched from France to subjugate&nbsp;the island. Many of the inhabitants sympathized with the&nbsp;invaders, and even the Hova themselves were divided. Although Ranavalo endeavoured to arouse a martial spirit in her&nbsp;subjects, the French advanced on the capital without encountering any effective opposition. On the 30th of September they&nbsp;captured Antananarivo. Rainilaiarivony was sent into exile,&nbsp;where he died in the following year; but Ranavalo was suffered&nbsp;to remain as nominal head of the government, under a strict&nbsp;French protectorate. In August 1896, to avoid commercial&nbsp;difficulties with foreign powers, the island was declared a French&nbsp;colony; but no change was made in the internal administration.&nbsp;Later in the year, however, the civil governor was replaced by&nbsp;a military resident, General Gallieni. A formidable insurrection&nbsp;broke out, which Gallieni suppressed, executing or exiling several&nbsp;prominent members of the Hova administration. Finding that&nbsp;the court had been a centre of intrigue, he abolished the sovereignty by proclamation in February 1897, and exiled Ranavalo&nbsp;to Réunion. In March 1899 she was removed to Algiers. Her&nbsp;exile there was relieved by occasional visits to Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RANC, ARTHUR (1831-1908), French politician and writer, was born at Poitiers on the 20th of December 1831, and was&nbsp;educated for the law. Implicated in a plot against Napoleon&nbsp;III. in 1853, he was acquitted, but shortly afterwards was im-prisoned for belonging to a secret society; for his share in anti-imperialist&nbsp; conspiracies in 1855 he was arrested and deported to&nbsp;Algeria without a trial. The amnesty of 1859 permitted him to&nbsp;return to Paris, where he soon drew the attention of the' police&nbsp;to his presence by his violent articles. During the siege of&nbsp;Paris he left the city in a balloon and joined Gambetta, for whom&nbsp;he organized a system of spies through which General Trochu&nbsp;was kept informed of the strength and disposition of the&nbsp;Prussians around Paris. He was elected to the National&nbsp;Assembly in February 1871, but resigned rather than subscribe&nbsp;to the peace. He had been elected mayor of the ninth arron-dissement of Paris in the autumn of 1870, and in March was sent&nbsp;by the same district to the Commune, from which he resigned&nbsp;when he found no reconciliation was possible between the&nbsp;mayors and the Commune. In July he became a member of&nbsp;the municipal council of Paris, and in 1873 was returned to the&nbsp;National Assembly for the department of the Rhône, and took&nbsp;his place on the extreme Left. A month after his election the&nbsp;governor of Paris demanded his prosecution for his share in the&nbsp;Commune. The claim being granted by a large majority, he</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
