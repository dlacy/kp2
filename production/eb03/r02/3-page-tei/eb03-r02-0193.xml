His governors, however, did all in their power to reſtrain this perverted ambition ; but finding him reſolute, they incloſed a ſpace of ground in the valley of the Vatican, where he firſt exhibited only to ſome choſen ſpectators, but ſhortly after invited the whole town. The praiſes of his flattering ſubjects only ſlimulated him ſtill more to theſe unbecoming pur-ſuits ; ſo that he now reſolved to allume a new character, and to appear as a finger upon the ſtage.</p><p>His paſſion for muſic, as was obſerved, was no leſs natural to him than the former ; but as it was leſs man-lv, ſo he endeavoured to defend it by the example of Tome of the moſt celebrated men, who practiſed it with the ſame fondneſs. He had been inſtructed in the the principles of this art from his childhood ; and upon his advancement to the empire, hc had put himſelf under the moſt celebrated maſters. He patiently ſubmitted to their inſtructions, and uſed ail thoſe methods which fingers practice, either to mend the voice, or improve its volubility. Yet, notwithſtanding all his aſſiduity, his voice was but a wretched one, being both feeble and unpltaſant. However, he was reſolved to produce it to the public, ſuch as it was ; for flattery, he knew, would ſupply every deficiency. His firſt public appearance was at games of his own inſtitution, called <hi rend="italic">juveniles</hi>  ; where he advanced upon the ſtage, tuning his inſtrument to his voice with great appearance of ſkill. A group of tribunes and centurions attended behind him ; when his old governor Bun hus ſtood by his hopeful pupil, with indignation in his countenance, and praiſes on his lips.</p><p>He was deſirous alſo of becoming a poet : hut he was unwilling to undergo the pain of ſtudy, which a proficiency in that art requires ; he was délirons of being a poet ready made. For this purpoſe, he got together ſeveral perſons, who were conſidered as great wits at court, though but very little known as ſuch to the public. Theſe attended him with verſes which they had compoſed at home, or which they blabbed out ex-temporaneouſly ; and the whole of their compoſitions being tacked together, by his direction, was called a <hi rend="italic">poem.</hi>  Nor was he without his philoſophers alſo ; he took a pleaſure in hearing their debates after ſupper, but he heard them merely for his amuſement.</p><p>Furniſhed with ſuch talents as theſe for giving pleaſure, he was reſolved to make the tour of his empire, and. give the moſt public diſplay of his abilities wherever he came. The place of his firſt exhibition, upon leaving Rome, was Naples. The crowds there were ſo great, and the curioſity of the people ſo earned in hearing him, that they did not perceive an earthquake that happened while he was ſinging. His deſire of gaining the ſuperiority over the other actors was truly ridiculous : he made intereſt with his judges, reviled his competitors, formed private factions to ſupport him, all in imitation of thoſe who got their livelihood upon the ſtage. While he continued to perform,, no man was permitted to depart from the theatre, upon any pretence whatſoever. Some were ſo· fatigued with hearing him, that they leaped privately from the walls, or pretended to fall into fainting fits, in order to be.</p><p>carried out. Nay, it is ſaid, that ſeveral women were delivered in the theatre. Syldiers were placed in ſeveral parts to obſerve the looks and geſtures of the ſpectators, either to direct them where to point their applauſe, or reſtrain their diſpleaſure. An old ſenator, named <hi rend="italic">Pef-paſian,</hi>  afterwards emperor, happening to-fall aſleep upon one of theſe occaſions, very narrowly eſeaped with his li'ſe.    <hi rend="sub">i</hi></p><p>After bring fatigued with the praiſes of his coun. trymen, Nero reſolved upon going over into Greece, to receive new theatrical honours. The occaſion was this. The cities of Greece had made a law to ſend him the crowns from all the games ; and deputies were accordingly diſpatched with this (to him) important embaſſy. As he one day entertained them at his table in the moſt ſumptuou» manner, and converged with them with the utmoſt familiarity, they intreated to hear him fing. Upon his complying, the artſul Greeks teſtified all the marks of ecſtafy and rapture. Applauſes ſo warm were peculiarly pleaſing to Nero : he could not refrain from crying out, That the Greeks alone were worthy to hear him ; and accordingly prepared without delay to go into Greece, where he ſpent the whole year· enſuing. In this journey, his retinue reſembled an army in number ; but it was only, compoſed of fingers, dancers, taylors, and other attendants upon the theatre, ht paſſed over all Greece, and exhibited at all their games, which he ordered to be celebrated in one year. At the 'Olympic games he reſolved to ſhow the people ſomething extraordinary ; wherefore, he drove a chariot with io horſes ; but being unable to ſuſtain the violence of the motion, he was driven ſrom his ſeat. The ſpectators, however, gave their unanimous applauſe, and,, he was crowned as conqueror. In this manner he obtained the prize at the Ifthmian, Pythian, ana Nemean games. The Greeks were not ſparing of their crowns; he obtained 1800 of them. An unfortunate finger happened to oppoſe him on one of theſe occaſions, and exerted all the powers of his art, which, it appears,, were prodigious. But he ſeems to have been a better finger than a politician ; for Nero ordered him to be killed on the ſpot. Upon his return ſrom Greece, he entered Naples, through a breach in the walla of the city, as was cuſtomary with thoſe who were conquerors in the Olympic games. But all the ſplendor of his return was reſerved for his entry into Rome. There he appeared ſeated in the chariot of Auguſtus, dreſſed in robes of purple, and crowned with wild olive, which was the Olympic garland. He bore in his hand the Pythian crown, and had I loo more carried before him.— Befide him ſat one Diodorus, a muſician; and behind him followed a band of fingers, as numerous as a legion, who ſung in honour of his victories. The ſenate, the knights, and the people, attended this puerile pageant, filling the air with their acclamations. The whole city was illuminated, every ſtreet ſmoked with incenſe;. wherever he paſted, victims were ſiain ; the pavement was ſtrewed with ſaſt’ron, while garlands of flowers,, ribbons, fowls, and paſties, (for ſo we are told), were ſhowered down upon him from the window’s as he pall-ed along. So many honours only inflamed his deſires of acquiring new; he at laſt began to take leſtons in wreſtling; willing to imitate Hercules in ſtrength, as he had rivalled Ag&lt;≈&gt;llo in activity.
