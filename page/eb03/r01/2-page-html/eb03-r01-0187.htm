<p><span class="font2">citizens, from whom loud clamours and every mark of diſapprobation broke forth. All verfailles was fpeedily&nbsp;in an uproar. M. Neckar had repeatedly folicited his&nbsp;diſmiſſion, and the report of this had increaſed the po-pular clamour. The court was in conſternation. The&nbsp;king probably diſcovered, with no great fatisfaction,&nbsp;that his miniſter was more popular than himſelf. At&nbsp;fix o’clock in the evening the queen fent for M. Nec-kar. when he returned from the palace, he affined the&nbsp;crowd that waited for him that he would not abandon&nbsp;them ; upon which they retired ſatisſied. At the ſame&nbsp;time the news of the royal ſeſſion had thrown the city&nbsp;of Paris into violent agitation. The peace of that ca-pital was at this time endangered by a variety of cauſes.&nbsp;A dreadful famine raged through the land, which in a&nbsp;great city is uſually moſt ſeverely felt. This prepared&nbsp;the minds of men for receiving unfavourable impreſ-fions of their political ſtate. Every effort was more-over made to diſorganize the government, and produce a diſlike to the ancient order of things. The&nbsp;preſs poured forth innumerable publications, filled with&nbsp;new and feducing, though generally impracticable, theories of liberty. Theſe were diſtributed^r«/z'j· among the&nbsp;bulk of the people of Paris, and diſperſed in the fame&nbsp;manner through the provinces. Philip duke of Ογ-leans (preſumptive heir to the crown failing the children and brothers of the king) is with good reaſon believed to have ſupplied this expence out of his more&nbsp;than royal revenues. In the gardens of the Palais&nbsp;Royale at Paris, which belonged to him, an immenſe&nbsp;multitude was daily aſſembled, liſtening from morning&nbsp;to night to orators who deſcanted upon the moſt violent&nbsp;ſubjects of popular politics. Many of theſe orators&nbsp;were fuſpected to be in his pay. It was even believed&nbsp;that his money found its way into the pockets of ſome&nbsp;of the moſt diſtinguiſhed leaders in the national aſſem-bly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But the government was, if poſſible, ſtill more dan-gerouſly aſſaulted by the methods now generally uſed to ſeduce the military. Every officer of the French army belonged to the order of the nobles ; and from that&nbsp;quarter, therefore, it might have been imagined that&nbsp;there was little danger. But this very circumſtance became the means of diforganizing that great engine of&nbsp;deſpotiſm. As the ſoldiers could not avoid imbibing&nbsp;ſome of the new opinions, their own officers became the&nbsp;firſt objects of their jealouſy ; eſpecially in conſequence&nbsp;of that impolitic edict of Louis XVI. which required&nbsp;every officer to produce proofs of four degrees of nobi-Iity ; and thus inſulted, by avowedly excluding the pri-vate men from promotion. Perhaps with a view to&nbsp;what might happen, the inſtructions to the deputies of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tiers eta(</span><span class="font2"> had recommended an increaſe of the p y&nbsp;of the ſoldiers. And now at Paris every art was uſed&nbsp;to gain them to the popular cauſe. They were con-ducted to the Palais Royal, and were there careſſed and&nbsp;flattered by the populace, while they liſtened to the po-pular harangues. Theſe arts were ſucceſsful. Οη the&nbsp;23d of June they firſt refuſed to fire on the mob in a&nbsp;riot. Some of them were on the 30th reported to be</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">in confinement for this offence ; a crowd inſtantly col-lected, and reſcued them, the dragoons that were brought to ſupprefs the tumult grounding their arms :&nbsp;a deputation of the citizens folicited of the aſſembly the&nbsp;pardon of the priſoners. The aſſembly applied to the&nbsp;king, who pardoned them accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All theſe events, together with the tumultuous ſtate of the capital, which was daily increafing, made it neceſſary for the king to call out the military force to&nbsp;reſtore, if poſſible, the public peace. 'Γhat his intentions were pure, the then ſtate of affairs will permit&nbsp;no man but a democrate to doubt ; but the ariſtocracy,&nbsp;with the Count d’Artois at their head, were bringing&nbsp;forward other meaſures, which ultimately contributed&nbsp;to the ruin of themſelves, the king, and the kingdom.&nbsp;Crowds of ſoldiers were collected from all parts of the&nbsp;kingdom around Paris and verfailles. It was obſerved,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">. that theſe confiſted chiefly of foreign mercenaries. Camps were traced out. Marſhal Broglio, a tried ve-teran, was ſent for and placed at the head of the army.&nbsp;The king was ſuppoſed to have entirely yielded to new&nbsp;counſels, and every thing bore the appearance of a deſperate effort to reſtore the energy of the ancient government. This is the moſt important period of the&nbsp;French revolution ; yet the ſpecific deſigns oſ the leading actors have never been clearly underſtood. It was&nbsp;rumoured at the time, that Paris was to be ſubdued by&nbsp;a liege and bombardment ; that the aſſembly was to be&nbsp;diſſolved, and its leaders put to death. Theſe are in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">credible exaggerations ; but the criſis of French liberty was univerſally regarded as at hand, and alſo the exiſtence of the national aſſembly as an independent body ;&nbsp;or at leaſt upon any other footing than that propoſed&nbsp;by the king on the 23d of June.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">An able and eloquent addreſs to the king againſt the aſſemblage of foreign troops in their neighbourhood&nbsp;was brought forward by Mirabeau, and voted by the&nbsp;aſſembly. The king properly replied, that the ſtate of&nbsp;the capital was the cauſe of aſſembling the troops, and&nbsp;offered to transfer the ſtates-general to Noyons or Soiſ-fons. &quot; we will neither remove (exclaimed Mirabeau)&nbsp;to Noyons· nor to Soiſſons ; we will not place ourſelves&nbsp;between two hoſtile armies, that which is beſieging Pa-ris and that which may fall upon us from Flanders or&nbsp;Alſace ; we have not aſked permiſſion to run away from&nbsp;the troops ; we have defined that the troops-ſhould be ‘&nbsp;removed from the capital.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ί hirty-five thouland men were now ſtationed in the neighbourhood of Paris and verfailles. The poſts&nbsp;were occupied which commanded the city, and camps&nbsp;were marked out for a greater force. The Count d’Artois and his party regarded their plans as ripe for execu-tion ; and M. Neckar received a letter from the king,&nbsp;requiring him to quit the kingdom in 24 hours. That&nbsp;popular (a) miniſter took the route of Bruſſels on the&nbsp;following day, when his departure was made public.&nbsp;In his diſmiffion the popular, or as it was now called&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">democratic,</span><span class="font2"> party thought they faw the refolution ■&nbsp;adopted to accompliſh their ruin. The affembly again&nbsp;addrefled the throne ; they requeſted anew the removal</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
