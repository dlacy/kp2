<p><span class="font1">but continued to give lectures as usual in the Old Catholic Faculty of Theology in the university of Bonn, and to write&nbsp;on theological subjects. He was made rector of that university&nbsp;in 1873. In 1874 and 1875 he was the official reporter of&nbsp;the memorable Reunion Conferences held at Bonn in those&nbsp;years and attended by many distinguished theologians of the&nbsp;Oriental and Anglican communions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reusch was a profound scholar, an untiring worker and a man of lovable character. Among his voluminous works were&nbsp;contributions to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Revue internationale de théologie,</span><span class="font1"> a review&nbsp;started at Bern at the instance of the Old Catholic Congress at&nbsp;Lucerne. He wrote also works on the Old Testament; a&nbsp;pamphlet on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Deutschen Bischöfe und der Aberglaube;</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;another on the falsifications to be found in the treatise of&nbsp;Aquinas against the Greeks; as well as essays on the history of&nbsp;the Jesuit Order, and a book of prayers. But his fame will&nbsp;mainly rest on the works which he and DoUinger published&nbsp;jointly. These consisted of a work on the Autobiography of&nbsp;Cardinal BeUarmine, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der Moralstreitigen in der&nbsp;Römisch-Katholischen Kirche seit dem XVI. Jahrhundert,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erörterungen über Leben und Schriften des hl. Liguori.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">During the last few years of his life he was smitten with paralysis.&nbsp;He died on the 3rd of March 1900, leaving behind him in manuscript a coUection of letters to Bunsen about Roman cardinals&nbsp;and prelates, which has since been published.

<p><span class="font1">REUSCH, HANS HENRIK (1852- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), Norwegian geologist,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">was born at Bergen on the 5th of September 1852. Hc was educated at Christiania, Leipzig and Heidelberg, and graduated&nbsp;Pb.D. at Christiania in 1883. He joined the Geological Survey&nbsp;of Norway in 1875, and became Director in 1888. He is distinguished for his researches on the crystaUine schists and the&nbsp;Palaeozoic rocks of Norway. He discovered Silurian fossils&nbsp;in the highly altered rocks of the Bergen region; and in 1891&nbsp;he called attention to a palaeozoic conglomerate of glacial origin&nbsp;in tbe Varanger Fiord, a view confirmed by Mr A. Strahan&nbsp;in 1896, who found glacial striae on the rocks beneath the&nbsp;ancient boulder-bed. Reusch has likewise thrown light on&nbsp;the later geological periods, on the Pleistocene glacial phenomena and on the sculpturing of the scenery of Norway. Among&nbsp;his separate publications are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Silur fossiler og pressede Kon-glomerater</span><span class="font1"> (1882); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Det nordlige Norges Geologi</span><span class="font1"> (1891).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REUSS, AUGUST EMANUEL VON (1811-1873), Austrian geologist and palaeontologist, the son of Franz Ambrosius&nbsp;Reuss (1761-1830), was born at Bilin in Bohemia on the 8th&nbsp;of July 1811. He was educated for the medical profession,&nbsp;graduating in 1834 at the university of Prague, and afterwards&nbsp;practising for fifteen years at BiUn. His leisure was devoted to&nbsp;mineralogy and geology, and the results of his researches were&nbsp;pubUshed in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geognostische Skizzen aus Böhmen</span><span class="font1"> (1840-44) and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Versteinerungen der Böhmischen Kreideformation</span><span class="font1"> (1845-46).&nbsp;In 1849 he gave up his medical practice, and became professor&nbsp;of mineralogy at the university of Prague. There he estab-Hshed a fine mineralogical coUection, and he became the first&nbsp;lecturer on geology. In 1863 he was appointed professor of&nbsp;mineralogy in the university of Vienna. He investigated&nbsp;the Cretaceous fauna of Gosau, and studied the Crustacea,&nbsp;including entomostraca, the corals, bryozoa, and especially&nbsp;the foraminifera of various geological formations and countries.&nbsp;He died at Vienna on the 26th of November 1873.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REUSS<sub>t</sub> ÉDOUARD GUILLAUME EUGÈNE &lt;1804-1891), Protestant theologian, was born at Strassburg on the 18th of&nbsp;July 1804. He studied philology in his native town (1819-22),&nbsp;theology at Göttingen under J. G. Eichhorn; and Oriental&nbsp;languages at Halle under Wilhelm Gesenius, and afterwards at&nbsp;Paris under SiIvestre de Sacy (1827-28). In 1828 he became&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Privatdozeni</span><span class="font1"> at Strassburg. From 1829 to 1834 he taught&nbsp;BibUcal criticism and Oriental languages at the Strassburg&nbsp;Theological School; he then became assistant, and afterwards,&nbsp;in 1836, regular professor of theology at that university. The&nbsp;sympathies of Reuss were German rather than French, and&nbsp;after the annexation of Alsace to Germany he remained at&nbsp;Strassburg, and retained his professorship till, in 1888, he retired&nbsp;on a pension. Amongst his earliest works were: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Iibris&nbsp;veteris Testamenti Jpocrypkis plebi non negandis</span><span class="font1"> (1829), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ideen&nbsp;zur Einleitung in das Evangelium Johannis</span><span class="font1"> (1840) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die&nbsp;Johanneische Theologie</span><span class="font1"> (1847). In 1852 he pubUshed his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la théologie chrétienne au siècle apostolique,</span><span class="font1"> which was&nbsp;foUowed in 1863 by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">HHistoire du canon des saintes écritures dans&nbsp;Véglise chrétienne.</span><span class="font1"> In 1874 he began to pubUsh his translation&nbsp;of the Bible, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Bible, nouvelle traduction avec commentaire.</span><span class="font1"> It&nbsp;was the criticism and exegesis of the New Testament which&nbsp;formed the subject of Reuss’s earUer labours—in 1842, indeed,&nbsp;he had published in German a history of the books of the New&nbsp;Testament, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der heiligen Schriften N. Test.*,</span><span class="font1"> and though&nbsp;his own views were Uberal, he opposed the results of the Tübingen&nbsp;school. After a time he turned his attention also to Old Testament criticism, for which he was especially fitted by his sound&nbsp;knowledge of Hebrew. In 1881 he pubUshed in German his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der heiligen Schriften A. Test.,</span><span class="font1"> a veritable encyclopaedia&nbsp;of the history of Israel from its earliest beginning tiU the taking&nbsp;of Jerusalem by Titus. He died at Strassburg on the 15th of&nbsp;AprU 1891.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reuss belonged to the more modern section of the Liberal party in the Lutheran Church. His critical position was to&nbsp;some extent that of K. H. Graf and J. Wellhausen, aUowing for&nbsp;the circumstances that he was in a sense their forerunner, and&nbsp;was actuaUy for a time Graf’s teacher. Indeed, he was reaUy&nbsp;the originator of the new movement, but hesitated to pubUsh&nbsp;the results of his studies. For many years Reuss edited with&nbsp;A. H. Cunitz (b. 1812) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Beiträge zu den theologischen Wissenschaften.</span><span class="font1"> With A. H. Cunitz and J. W. Baum (1809-1878),&nbsp;and after their death alone, he edited the monumental edition&nbsp;of Calvin’s works (38 vols., 1863 ff.). His critical edition of&nbsp;the Old Testament appeared a year after his death. His son,&nbsp;Ernst Rudolf (b. 1841), was in 1873 appointed city Ubrarian&nbsp;at Strassburg.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REUSS, the name of two small principaUties of the German empire, caUed Reuss, elder line, or Reuss-Greiz, and Reuss,&nbsp;younger line, or Reuss-Schleiz-Gera. With a joint area of&nbsp;441 sq. m. they form part of the complex of Thuringian states,&nbsp;and consist, roughly speaking, of two main blocks of territory,&nbsp;separated by the Neustadt district of the duchy of Saxe-Weimar.&nbsp;The more southerly, which is much the larger of the two portions,&nbsp;belongs to the bleak, mountainous region of the Frankenwald&nbsp;and the Vogtland, whUe the northern portion is hiUy, but fertile.&nbsp;The chief rivers are the Weisse Elster and the Saale. About&nbsp;35% of the total surface is occupied by forests, while about&nbsp;40% is under tiUage and about 19% under meadow and&nbsp;pasture. Wheat, rye and barley are the principal crops grown,&nbsp;and the breeding of cattle is an important industry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reuss-Greiz,</span><span class="font1"> with an area of 122 sq. m., belongs to the larger of the two divisions mentioned above, and consists of three&nbsp;large and several smaU parcels of Iand. On the whole, the soil&nbsp;is not favourable for agriculture, but the rearing of cattle is&nbsp;carried on with much success. About 63% of the inhabitants&nbsp;maintain themselves by industrial pursuits, the chief products&nbsp;of which are the making of wooUen fabrics at Greiz, the capital,&nbsp;and of stockings at Zeulenroda. Other industries are machine-budding, printing and the making of paper and porcelain. In 1905&nbsp;the population of the principality was 70,603. The constitution of&nbsp;Reuss-Greiz dates from 1867, and provides for a representative&nbsp;chamber of twelve members, of whom three are appointed by&nbsp;the prince, while two are chosen by the landed proprietors,&nbsp;three by the towns and four by the rural districts. The revenue&nbsp;and expenditure amount to about £76,000 a year, and there is no&nbsp;public debt. The reigning prince is Henry XXIV. (b. 1878),&nbsp;but as he is incapable of discharging his duties, these are now&nbsp;undertaken by a regent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reuss-Schleiz-Gero,</span><span class="font1"> with an area of 319 sq. m., includes part of the southern and the whole of the northern of the two main&nbsp;divisions mentioned above; it touches Bavaria on the south</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
