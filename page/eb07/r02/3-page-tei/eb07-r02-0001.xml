            <p>RIVER CONTD. been able to eradicate this plant of native growth from the heart of man. The
                sentiment is congenial to his nature, and therefore it is universal; and we could
                almost appeal to the feelings of every reader, whether he does not perceive it in
                his own breast. Perhaps we may be mistaken in our opinion in the case of the
                corrupted inhabitants of the populous and busy cities, who are habituated to
                the fond contemplation of their own individual exertions as the sources of all their
                hopes. Give the shoemaker but leather and a few tools, and he defies the powers of
                nature to disappoint him; but the simpler inhabitants of the country, the most
                worthy and the most respectable part of every nation, after equal, perhaps greater
                exertion, both of skill and of industry, are more accustomed to resign themselves
                to the great ministers of Providence, and to look up to heaven for the “ early and
                the latter rains, ” without which all their labours are fruitless.</p>
            <p>--Extrema per illos</p>
            <p>Numenque excedens terris vestigia fecit.</p>
            <p>And among the husbandmen and the shepherds of all nations and ages, we find the same
                fond attachment to their springs and rivulets.</p>
            <p>Fortunate senex, hie, inter flumina nota Et fontes sacros, frigus captabis
                opacum,</p>
            <p>was the mournful ejaculation of poor Melibœus. We hardly know a river of any note in
                our own country whose source is not looked on with some respect.</p>
            <p>We repeat our assertion, that this worship was the offspring of affection and
                gratitude, and that it is giving a very unfair and false picture of the human mind
                to ascribe these superstitions to the working of fear alone. These would have
                represented the river-gods as seated on ruins, brandishing rooted-up trees, with
                angry looks, pouring out their sweeping torrents. But no such thing. The lively
                imagination of the Greeks felt, and expressed with an energy unknown to all other
                nations, every emotion of the human soul. They figured the Naiads as beautiful
                nymphs, patterns of gentleness and of elegance. These they represented as partially
                attached to the children of men; and their interference in human affairs is always
                in acts of kind assistance and protection. They resemble, in this respect; the rural
                deities of the northern nations, the fairies, but without their caprices and
                resentments. And if we attend to the descriptions and representations of their
                river-gods, beings armed with power, an attribute which slavish fear never fails to
                couple with cruelty and vengeance, we shall find the same expression of affectionate
                trust and confidence in their kind dispositions. They are generally called by the
                respectable but endearing name of<hi rend="italic"> father.</hi> “ Da Tyberi pater.
                ” says Virgil. Mr Bruce says that the Nile at its source is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">abay,</hi> or “ father. ” We observe this word, or its radix,
                blended with many names of rivers of the east; and think it probable that when our
                traveller got this name from the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, they applied to
                the stream what is meant to express the tutelar or presiding spirit. The river-gods
                are always represented as venerable old men, to indicate their being coeval with
                the world. But it is always a <hi rend="italic">cruda viridisque senectus,</hi>
                and they are never represented as oppressed with age and decrepitude. Their beards
                are long and flowing, their looks placid, their attitude easy, reclined on a bank,
                covered, as they are crowned, with never-fading sedges and bulrushes, and leaning on
                their urns, from which they pour out their plentiful and fertilizing streams. Mr
                Bruce’s description of the sources of the Nile, and of the respect paid to the
                sacred waters, has not a frowning feature; and the hospitable old man, with his fair
                daughter Irepone, and the gentle priesthood which peopled the little village of
                Geesh, form a contrast with the neighbouring Galla (among whom a mili-</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>tary leader was called the <hi rend="italic">lamb,</hi> because he did not murder
                pregnant women), which very clearly paints the inspiring principle of this
                superstition. Pliny says (lib. viii. 81 that at the source of the Clitumnus there is
                an ancient temple highly respected. The presence and the power of the divinity are
                expressed by the fates which stand in the vestibule. Around this temple are several
                little chapels, each of which covers a sacred fountain; for the Clitumnus is the
                father of several little rivers which unite their streams with him. At some distance
                below the temple is a bridge which divides the sacred waters from those which are
                open to common use. No one must presume to set his foot in the streams above this
                bridge; and to step over any of them is an indignity which renders a person
                infamous. They can only be visited in a consecrated boat. Below the bridge we are
                permitted to bathe, and the place is incessantly occupied by the neighbouring
                villagers. See also Vibius Sequester Oberlini, p. 101-103, and 221-223; also
                    Sueton. <hi rend="italic">Caligula,</hi> c. 43; Virg. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Georg.</hi> ii. 146.</p>
            <p>What is the cause of all this? The Clitumnus, near its source, flows through the
                richest pastures, through which it was carefully distributed by numberless drains;
                and these nourished cattle of such spotless whiteness and extraordinary beauty that
                they were sought for with eagerness over all Italy, as the most acceptable victims
                in their sacrifices.</p>
            <p>Is not this superstition then an effusion of gratitude?</p>
            <p>Such are the dictates of kind-hearted nature in our breasts, before it has been
                vitiated by vanity and self-conceit, and we should not be ashamed of feeling the
                impression. We hardly think of making any apology for dwelling a little on this
                incidental circumstance of the superstitious veneration paid to rivers. We cannot
                think that our readers will be displeased at having agreeable ideas excited in their
                minds, being always of opinion that the torch of true philosophy will not only
                enlighten the understanding, but also warm and cherish the affections of the
                heart.</p>
            <p>With respect to the origin of rivers, we have very little to offer in this place. It
                is obvious to every person, that besides the torrents which carry down into the
                rivers what part of the rains and melted snows is not absorbed by the soil or taken
                up by the plants which cover the earth, they are fed either immediately or remotely
                by the springs. A few remarkable streams rush at once out of the earth in force, and
                must be considered as the continuation of subterraneous rivers, whose origin we are
                therefore to seek out; and we do not know any circumstance in which their first
                beginnings differ from those of other rivers, which are formed by the union of
                little streams and rills, each of which has its own source in a spring or fountain.
                This question, therefore, what is the process of nature, and what are the supplies
                which fill our springs? will be treated of under the word Spring.</p>
            <p>Whatever be the source of rivers, it is to be met with in almost every part of the
                globe. The crust of earth with which the rocky framing of this globe is covered is
                generally stratified. Some of these strata are extremely pervious to water, having
                but small attraction for its particles, and being very porous. Such is the quality
                of gravelly strata in an eminent degree. Other strata are much more firm, or attract
                water more strongly, and refuse it passage.</p>
            <p>This is the case with firm rock and with clay. When a stratum of the first kind has
                one of the other immediately under it, the water remains in the upper stratum, and
                bursts out wherever the sloping sides of the hills cut off the strata, and this will
                be the form of a trickling spring, because the water in the porous stratum is
                greatly obstructed in its passage towards the outlet. As this irregular formation of
                the earth is very general, we must have springs, and of course rivers or rivulets,
                in every corner where there are high grounds.</p>
            <p>Rivers flow from the higher to the low grounds. It is</p>
