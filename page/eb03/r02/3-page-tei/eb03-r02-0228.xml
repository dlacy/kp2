His death gave general ſatisſaction to all, except his ſoldiers, who hoped to reap the reward of their treachery by the plunder of Milan. But being fruſtrated in theſe expectations, and in ſome meaſure kept within bounds by the largeſſes of Martian, Flavius Claudius was nominated to ſucceed, and joyfully accepted by all orders of the ſtate, and his title confirmed by the ſenate and the people.</p><p>We are not ſufficiently aſſured of this emperor’s lineage and country. Some affirm that he was born in Dalmatia, and deſeended from an ancient family there ; others aſſert that he was a Trojan ; and others, that he was ſon to the emperor Gordian. But, whatever might have been his deſcent, his merits were by no means doubtful. He was a man of great valour and conduct, having performed the moſt eminent ſervices againſt the Goths, who had long continued to make irruptions into the empire. He was now about 55 years old, equally remarkable ſor the ſtrength of his body and the vigour of his mind ; he was chaſte and temperate, a rewarder of the good, and a ſevere puniſher of ſuch as tranſgreſſed the laws. Thus endowed, therefore, he in ſome meaſure put a ſtop to the precipitate decline of the empire, and once more ſeemed to reſtore the glory of Rome.</p><p>His firſt ſucceſs, upon being made emperor, was againſt Aureolus, whom he defeated near Milan. His next expedition was to oppoſe the Goths, againſt whom he led a very numerous army. Theſe barbarians had made their principal and moſt ſucceſsful irruptions into Thrace and Macedonia, ſwarmed over all Greece, and had pillaged the famous city of Athens, which had long been the ſchool of all the polite arts to the Romans. The Goths, however, had no veneration for thoſe em-belliſhments that tend to ſoften and humanize the mind, but deſtroyed all monuments of taſte and learning with the moſt ſavage alacrity. It was upon one of theſe occaſions, that, having heaped together a large pile of books in order to burn them, one of the commanders diſſuaded them from the deſign, alleging, that the time which the Grecians ſhould waſte on books would only render them more unqualified ſor war. But the empire ſeemed to tremble, not only on that ſide, but almoſt on every quarter. At the ſame time, above 300,000 of theſe barbarians (the Heruli, the Trutangi, the Virtur-gi, and many nameleſs and uncivilized nations) came down the river Danube, with 2000 ſhips, fraught with men and ammunition, ſpreading terror and devaſtation on every ſide.</p><p>In this ſtate of univerſal diſmay, Claudius alone ſeem-ed to continue unſhaken. He marched hie diſpropor-tioned army againſt the ſavage invaders ; and though but ill prepared for ſuch an engagement, as the forces Of the empire were then employed in different parts of the world, he came off victorious, and made an incredible ſlaughter of the enemy. The whole of their great army was cither cut to pieces or taken priſoners : houſes were filled with their arms ; and ſcarce a province of the empire, that was not furniſhed with ſlaves from thoſe that ſurvived the defeat. Theſe ſucceſſes were followed by many others in different parts of the empire; fothat</p><lb/><p>the Goths, ſor a conſiderable time aſtcr, made but a ſeeble oppoſition. He ſome time after marched againſt the revolted Germans, and overthrew them with conſiderable ſlaughter. His laſt expedition was to oppoſe Tetricus and Zenobia, his two pniſſant rivals in the empire. But on his march, as he approached near Sirmium, in Pannonia, he was ſeized with a peſtilential fever, of which he died in a ſew days, to the great regret of his ſubjects, and the irreparable loſs of the Roman empire. His reign, which was not quite two years continuance, was active and ſucceſsful ; and ſuch is the character given of him by hiſtorians, that he is ſaid to have united in himſelf the moderation of Auguſtus, the valour of Trajan, and the piety of Anto∙∙ ninus.</p><p>Immediately after the death of Claudius, the army made unanimous choice of Aurelian, who was at that time maſter of the horſe, and eſteemed the moſt valiant commander of his time. However, his promotion was not without oppoſition on the part of the ſenate, as Quintilius, the brother of the deceaſed emperor, put in his claim, and was ſor a while acknowledged at Rome. But his authority was of very ſhort duration ; for find· ing himſelf abandoned by thoſe who at firſt inſtigated him to declare for the throne, he choſe to prevent the ſeverity of his rival by a voluntary death, and cauſing his veins to be opened, expired, after having reigned but 17 days.</p><p>Aurelian being thus univerſally acknowledged by all the ſtates of the empire, aſſumed the command, with a greater ſhow of power than his predeceſſors had enjoyed for ſome time before. This active monarch was born of mean and obſcure parentage in Dacia, and was about 55 years old at the time of his coming to the throne. He had ſpent the earjy part of his life in the army, and had riſen through all the gradations of military duty. He was of unſhaken courage and amazing ſtrength ; he in one engagement killed 40 of the enemy with his own hand, and above 900 at ſeveral different times. In ſhort, hie valour and expedition were ſuch, that he was compared to Julius Cæſar ; and, in fact, only wanted mildneſs and clemency to be every way his equal.</p><p>The whole of this monarch’s reign was ſpent in repreſſing the irruptions of the northern nations, in humbling every other pretender to the empire, and puniſhing the monſtrous irregularities of his own ſubjects. He defeated the Marcαmanni, that had invaded Italy, in three ſeveral engagements, and at length totally deſtroyed their army. He was not leſs ſucceſsful againſt Zenobia, the queen of the Eaſt, a woman of the moſt heroic qualifications, who had long diſclaimed the Roman power, and eſtabliſhed an empire of her own, as is related under the article Palmyra.</p><p>Aurelian having thus brought back peace to the empire, endeavoured, by the rigours of juſtice, to bring back virtue alſo. He was very ſtrict in puniſhing the crimes of the ſoldiery : in his orders to his lieutenants, he inſiſted that the peaſants ſhould not be plundered upon any pretences ; that not even a grape, a grain of ſalt, or a drop of oil, ſhould be exacted unjuſtly. He cauſed a ſoldier, who had committed adultery with his hoſteſs, to have his ſeet tied to the tops of two trees, forcibly bent at top to meet each other ; which being let looſe, and ſuddenly recoiling, tore the</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
