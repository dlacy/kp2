formed from the Perſian word seraw, or Turkiſh word <hi rend="italic">ſarai,</hi> which ſignifies a houſe, and is commonly uſed to expreſs the houſe or palace of a prince. In this ſenſe it is frequently uſed at Conſtantinople ; the houſes of foreign ambaſſadors are called s <hi rend="italic">eraglios.</hi> But it is commonly uſed by way of eminence for the palace of the grand ſignior at Conſtantinople, where he keeps his court, and where his concubines are lodged, and where the youth are trained up for the chief polls of the empire.</p><p>It is a triangle about three Italian miles round, wholly within the city, at the end of the promontory Chryſoceras, now called the <hi rend="italic">Seraglio Point.</hi> The buildings run back to the top of the hill, and from thence are gardens that reach to the edge of the ſea. It is inclosed with a very high and ſtrong wall, upon which there are ſeveral watch towers : and it has many gates, ſome of which open towards the ſea-ſide, and the rest into the city ; but the chief gate is one of the latter, which is conſtantly guarded by a company oſ capoochees, or porters ; and in the night it is well guarded towards<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0294.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0288"/>
the ſea. The outward appearance is not very beautiful, the architecture being irregular, consisting of separate edifices in the form of pavilions and domes.</p><p>The ladies of the ſeraglio are a collection of beautiful young women, chiefly ſent as preſents from the provinces and the Greek iſlands, moſt of them the children of Chriſtian parents. The brave prince Heraclius hath for ſome years paſt aboliſhed the infamous tribute of children of both ſexes, which Georgia formerly paid every year to the Porte. The number of women in the harem depends on the taſte of the reigning monarch or ſultan. Selim had 2000, Achmet had but 300, and the late ſultan had nearly 1600. On their admiſſion they are committed to the care of old ladies, taught ſewing and embroidery, muſic, dancing, and other accompliſhments, and furniſhed with the richeſt clothes and ornaments. They all ſleep in ſeparate beds, and between every fifth there is a preceptreſs. Their chief governeſs is called Katon Kiaga, or governeſs of the noble young ladies. There is not one ſervant among them, for they are obliged to wait on one another by rotation ; the laſt that is entered ſerves her who preceded her and herelf. Theſe ladies are ſcarcely ever ſuffered to go a- broad, except when the grand ſignior removes from one place to another, when a troop of black eunuchs conveys them to the boats, which are incloſed with lattices and linen curtains ; and when they go by land they are put into cloſe chariots, and ſignals are made at certain diſtances, to give notice that none approach the roads through which they march. The boats of the harem, which carry the grand ſignior’s wives, are inanned with 24 rowers, and have white covered tilts, shut alternately by Venetian blinds. Among the emperor’s attendants are a number of mutes, who act and converſe by ſigns with great quickneſs, and ſome dwarfs, who are exhibited for the diversion of his majeſty.</p><p>When he permits the women to walk in the gardens of the ſeraglio, all people are ordered to retire, and on every ſide there is a guard of black eunuchs, with fibres in their hands, while others go their rounds in order to hinder any perſon from ſeeing them. If, unfortunately, any one is found in the garden, even thro' ignorance or inadvertence, he is undoubtedly killed, and his head brought to the feet of the grand ſignior, who gives a great reward to the guard for their vigilance. Sometimes the grand ſignior paſſes into the gardens to amuſe himſelf when the women are there ; and it is then that they make uſe of their utmoſt efforts, by dancing, ſinging, ſeducing geſtures, and amorous blandiſhments, to enſnare the affections of the monarch. It is not permitted that the monarch ſhould take a virgin to his bed, except during the ſolemn feſtivals, and on occaſion of ſome extraordinary rejoicings, or the arrival of ſome good news. Upon ſuch occaſions, if the sultan chooſes a new companion to his bed, he enters into the apartment of the women, who are ranged in files by the governeſſes, to whom he ſpeaks, and intimates the perſon he likes beſt : the ceremony of the handkerchief, which the grand ſignior is ſaid to throw to the girl that he elects, is an idle tale, without any foundation. As ſoon as the grand ſignior has choſen the girl that he has deſtined to be the partner of his bed, all the others follow her to the bath, waſhing and perfuming her, and dreſſing her ſuperbly, conducting her ſinging,</p><p>dancing, and rejoicing, to the bed-chamber of the grand ſignior, who is generally, on ſuch an occaſion, already in bed. Scarcely has the new-elected favourite entered the chamber, introduced by the grand eunuch who is upon guard, than ſhe kneels down, and when the ſultan calls her, ſhe creeps into bed to him at the foot of the bed, if the ſultan does not order her, by eſpecial grace, to approach by the side ; after a certain time, upon a ſignal given by the ſultan, the governeſs of the girls, with all her fuite, enter the apartment, and take her back again, conducting her with the ſame ceremony to the womens apartments ; and if by good fortune ſhe becomes pregnant, and is delivered of a boy, ſhe is called aſaki sultaness, that is to ſay, ſultaneſs-mother ; for the firſt ſon ſhe has the honour to be crowned, and ſhe has the liberty of forming her court. Eunuchs are alſo affirmed for her guard, and for her particular ſervice. No other ladies, though delivered of boys, are either crowned or maintained with ſuch coſtly diſtinction as the firſt ; however, they have their ſervice apart, and handſome appointments. After the death of the ſultan, the mothers of the male children are ſhut up in the old ſeraglio, from whence they can never come out any more, unleſs any of their ſons aſcend the throne. Baron de Tott informs us, that the female slave who becomes the mother of a ſultan, and lives long enough to ſee her ſon mount the throne, is the only woman who at that period alone acquires the diſtinction of ſultana-mother ; ſhe is till then in the interior of her priſon with her ſon. The title of bache kadun, principal woman, is the firſt dignity of the grand ſignior’s harem ; and ſhe hath a larger allowance than thoſe who have the title of ſecond, third, and fourth woman, which are the four free women the Koran allows.</p><p>This is a deſcription of the grand ſignior’s ſeraglio : we ſhall now add an account of the ſeraglio or harem, as it is often called, of the emperor of Morocco, from the very intereſting tour of Mr Lemprſere. This gentleman being a ſurgeon by proſeſſion, was admitted into the harem to preſcribe for ſome of the ladies who were indiſpoſed, and was therefore enabled to give a particular account of this female priſon, and, what is ſtill more curious, of the manners and behaviour of its inhabitants.</p><p>The harem forms a part of the palace. The apartments, which are all on the ground floor, are ſquare, very lofty, and four of them incloſe a ſpacious ſquare court, into which they open by means of large folding doors. In the centre of theſe courts, which are floored with blue and white checquered tiling, is a fountain, ſupplied by pipes from a large reſervoir on the outſide of the palace, which ſerves for the frequent ablutions recommended by the Mahometan religion, as well as for other purpoſes. The whole of the harem conſiſts of about twelve of theſe ſquare courts, communicating with each other by narrow passages, which afford a free acceſs from one part of it to another, and of which all the women are allowed to avail themselves.</p><p>The apartments are ornamented on the outſide with beautiful carved wood. In the inſide moſt of the rooms are hung with rich damaſk of various colours ; the floors are covered with beautiful carpets, and there are matresses diſpoſed at different diſtances, for the purpoſes of fitting and ſleeping.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0295.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0289"/>
Beſides theſe, the apartments are furniſhed at each extremity with an elegant European mahogany bed- ſtead, hung with damaſk, having on it ſeveral matreſſes placed one over the other, which are covered with various coloured ſilks ; but theſe beds are merely placed there to ornament the room. In all the apartments, without exception, the ceiling is wood, carved and painted. The principal ornaments in ſome were large and valuable looking-glaſſes, hung on different parts of the walls. In others, clocks and watches of different ſizes, in glaſs caſes, were diſpoſed in the ſame manner.</p><p>The ſultana Lalla Batoom and another favourite were indulged with a whole ſquare to themſelves ; but the concubines were only each allowed a single room.</p><p>Each female had a ſeparate daily allowance from the emperor, proportioned to the eſtimation in which they were held by him. The late emperor’s allowance was very trifling : Lalla Douyaw, the favourite ſultana, had very little more than half-a-crown Engliſh a-day, and the others leſs in proportion. It muſt be allowed, that the emperor made them occaſional preſents of money, dreſs, and trinkets ; but this could never be ſufficient to ſupport the number of domeſtics and other expences they muſt incur. Their greateſt dependence therefore was on the preſents they received from thoſe Europeans and Moors who viſited the court, and who employed their influence in obtaining ſome particular favour from the emperor. This was the moſt ſucceſsful mode that could be adopted. When Mr Lempriere was at Morocco, a Jew, desirous of obtaining a very advantageous favour from the emperor, for which he had been a long time unſucceſsfully ſoliciting, ſent to all the principal ladies of the harem preſents of pearls to a very large amount ; the conſequence was, that they all went in a body to the emperor, and immediately obtained the wiſhed-for conceſſion.</p><p>The ladies ſeparately furniſh their own rooms, hire their own domeſtics, and, in fact, do what they pleaſe in the harem, but are not permitted to go out without an expreſs order from the emperor, who very ſeldom grants them that favour, except when they are to be removed from one palace to another. In that caſe, a party of ſoldiers is diſpatched a little diſtance before them, to diſperſe the male paſſengers in particular, and to prevent the poſſibility of their being ſeen. This previous ſtep being taken, a piece of linen cloth is tied round the lower part of the face, and afterwards theſe miſerable females cover themſelves entirely with their haicks, and either mount mules, which they ride like men, or, what is more uſual, are put into a ſquare carriage or litter, conſtructed for this purpoſe, which by its lattice-work allows them to ſee without being ſeen. In this manner they ſet off, under the charge of a guard <hi rend="italic">of</hi> black eunuchs. This journey, and ſometimes a walk within the bounds of the palace, with which they are, however, ſeldom indulged, is the only exerciſe they are permitted to take.</p><p>The late emperor’s harem conſiſted of between 60 and 100 females, beſides their domeſtics and ſlaves, which were very numerous. Many of the concubines were Mooriſh women, who had been preſented to the emperor, as the Moors consider it an honour to have their daughters in the harem ; ſeveral were European ſlaves, who had either been made captives, or purchased by the emperor ; and ſome were Negroes.</p><p>In this group the Europeans, or their deſcendants, had by far the greateſt claim to the character of hand- ſome. There was one in particular, who was a native of Spain, and taken into the harem at about the ſame age as Lalla Douyaw, who was indeed a perfect beauty. Nor was this lady quite lingular in that reſpect, for many others were almoſt equally handſome.</p><p>The eunuchs, who bate the entire charge of the women, and who in fact live always among them, are the children of Negro ſlaves. They are generally either very ſhort and fat, or elſe tall, deformed, and lame. Their voices have that particular tone which is obſervable in youths who are just arriving at manhood ; and their perſons altogether afford a diſguſting image of weakneſs and effeminacy.</p><p>The ſame gentleman gives us a very curious account of the manners and ignorance of theſe immured females, from his own obſervation, when viſiting the prince’s harem. "Attended by an eunuch (ſays he), after paſſing the gate of the harem, which is always locked, and under the care of a guard of eunuchs, we entered a narrow and dark paſſage, which ſoon brought us to the court, into which the womens chambers open. We here ſaw numbers of both black and white women and children ; ſome concubines, ſome ſlaves, and others hired domeſtics.</p><p>“ Upon their obſerving the unuſual figure of an European, the whole multitude in a body ſurrounded me, and expreſſed the utmoſt aſtoniſhment at my dreſs and appearance. Some ſtood motionleſs, with their hands lifted up, their eyes fixed, and their mouths open, in the uſual attitude of wonder and ſurpriſe. Some burst into immoderate fits of laughter ; while others again came up, and with uncommon attention eyed me from head to foot. The parts of my dreſs which ſeemed moſt to attract their notice were my buckles, buttons, and ſtockings ; for neither men nor women in this country wear any thing of the kind. With reſpect to the club of my hair, they ſeemed utterly at a loſs in what view to consider it ; but the powder which I wore they conceived to be employed for the purpoſe of deſtroying vermin. Moſt of the children, when they ſaw me, ran away in the moſt perfect conſternation ; and on the whole, I appeared as lingular an animal, and I dare say had the honour of exciting as much curioſity and attention, as a lion or a man-tiger juſt imported from abroad, and introduced into a country town in England on a market-day. Every time I viſited the harem, I was ſurrounded and laughed at by this curious mob, who, on my entering the gate, followed me cloſe to the very chamber to which I was proceeding, and on my return univerſally eſcorted me out.</p><p>“ The greateſt part of the women were uncommonly fat and unwieldy ; had black and full eyes, round faces, with ſmall noſes. They were of different complexions; ſome very fair, ſome fallow, and others again perfect Negroes.</p><p>“ One of my new patients being ready to receive me, I was desired to walk into her room ; where, to my great ſurpriſe, I ſaw nothing but a curtain drawn quite acroſs the apartment, ſimilar to that of a theatre which ſeparates the ſtage from the audience. A female domeſtic brought a very low ſtool, placed it near the curtain, and told me I was to lit down there, and feel her miſtreſs’s pulse.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0296.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0290"/>
" The lady, who had by this time summoned up courage to ſpeak, introduced her hand from the bottom of the curtain, and desired me to inform her of all her complaints, which ſhe conceived I might perfectly do by merely feeling the pulſe. It was in vain to aſk her where her pain was ſeated, whether in her ſtomach, head, or back ; the only anſwer I could procure was a requeſt to feel the pulſe of the other hand, and then point out the ſeat of the diſeaſe, and the nature of the pain.</p><p>“ Having neither ſatisfied my curioſity by exhibiting her face, nor made me acquainted with the nature of her complaint, I was under the neceſſity of informing her in poſitive terms, that to underſtand the diſeaſe, it was abſolutely neceſſary to ſee the tongue as well as to feel the pulſe ; and that without it I could do nothing for her. My eloquence, or rather that of my Jewiſh interpreter, was, however, for a long time exerted in vain ; and I am perſuaded ſhe would have diſmiſſed me without any further inquiry, had not her invention ſupplied her with a happy expedient to remove her embarraſſment. She contrived at laſt to cut a hole through the curtain, through which ſhe extruded her tongue, and thus complied with my injunction as far as it was neceſſary in a medical view, but most effectually diſappointed my curioſity.</p><p>“ I was afterwards ordered to look at another of the prince’s wives, who was affected with a ſcrophulous ſwelling in her neck. This lady was, in the ſame manner as the other, at firſt excluded from my light ; but as ſhe was obliged to ſhow me her complaint, I had an opportunity of seeing her face, and obſerved it to be very handſome.”</p><p>It is curious to obſerve the ſtrange and childiſh notions of persons who have been totally ſecluded from the world. All the ladies of the harem expected that our author ſhould have inſtantly diſcovered their complaints upon feeling the pulſe, and that he could cure every diſeaſe inſtantaneouſly. He found them proud and vain of their perſons, and extremely ignorant. “ Among many ridiculous queſtions, they aſked my interpreter (says Mr Lempriere) if I could read and write ; upon being anſwered in the affirmative, they expressed the utmoſt ſurpriſe and admiration at the abilities of the Chriſtians. There was not one among them who could do either ; theſe rudiments of learning are indeed only the lot of a few of their men, who on that account are named <hi rend="italic">Talbs,</hi> or explainers of the Mahometan law.”</p><p>It is melancholy to reflect on the ſituation of theſe unfortunate women. Being conſidered as the mere inſtruments of pleaſure, no attention is paid to the improvement of their minds. They have no employment to occupy their time. Their needle-work is performed by Jewelſes; their food is dreſſed, and their chambers taken care of, by ſlaves and domeſtics. They have no amuſement but a rude and barbarous kind of melancholy muſic, without melody, variety, or taste ; and eonverſation with one another, which must indeed be very confined, uniform, and inanimate, as they never ſee a new object. Excluded from the enjoyment of freſh air and exerciſe, so neceſſary for the iupport of health and life ; deprived of all ſociety but that of their fellow ſufferers, a ſociety to which moſt of them would prefer ſolitude itſelf ; they are only to be conſidered as</p><p>the moſt abject of ſlaves—ſlaves to the vices and caprice of a licentious tyrant, who exacts even from his wives themselves a degree of ſubmiſſion and reſpect. which borders upon idolatry, and which God and nature never meant ſhould be paid to a mortal.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
