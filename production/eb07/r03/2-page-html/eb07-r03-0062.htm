        <p><span class="font2">nation was at the same time discovered, and in a few days there
                arrived from Warsaw a communication from Constantine, in which he acknowledged the
                existence and validity&nbsp;of the deed, and anew waived his right of
                succession.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Accordingly Nicholas I. ascended the throne, announcing the event by
                a proclamation of the 23d of December 1825. The disturbance of the natural order of
                succession&nbsp;was seized by the discontented as a favourable pretext
                for&nbsp;insurrection ; and the reign of the new emperor was opened by a military
                mutiny in St Petersburg, which, after having been suppressed with bloodshed, was
                followed by several executions, and many imprisonments and banishments&nbsp;to
                Siberia. Nicholas, and his spouse, the princess royal of&nbsp;Prussia, were crowned
                at Moscow in 1826, and at Warsaw&nbsp;in 1829. The latter of these two ceremonies
                did not long&nbsp;precede the revolution of Poland, which has been the
                most&nbsp;remarkable event of the emperor’s reign. It is unnecessary&nbsp;to repeat
                the circumstances of that unfortunate struggle.&nbsp;The whole character and policy
                of Nicholas have been similar to those of his brother since 1815, with, however,
                an&nbsp;additional degree of force and boldness, which may be attributable partly to
                the natural progress of the political tactics which were common to both, and partly
                to the more energetic will and greater attachment to military principles&nbsp;and
                forms which distinguish the younger brother.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">If we look to the three questions which were described above as
                forming the main business of Alexander in his foreign policy, we find the position
                of Russia regarding them&nbsp;to have remained, with slight alterations, the same
                since the&nbsp;commencement of the new reign as it was before.
                The&nbsp;anti-constitutional views of the Holy Alliance have been&nbsp;necessarily
                modified, but not abandoned ; although Nicholas speedily recognised the title of
                Louis Philippe to the&nbsp;French throne, and took an active share in the
                conferences&nbsp;of the five powers at London for arranging the affairs
                of&nbsp;Belgium and Holland. On the side of Turkey, Russia has,&nbsp;during the last
                fifteen years, been rapidly gaining strength.&nbsp;The treaty of Akjerman between
                the two powers in 1826,&nbsp;extending the principles laid down in the peace of
                Buka-rescht, was ill executed on both sides ; and the mutual misunderstanding, being
                still further complicated by the emergence of the Greek question, issued first in
                the battle of&nbsp;Navarino, and afterwards in a regular war of two years between
                Russia and the Porte. The first campaign, in 1828,&nbsp;was favourable to Russia,
                but not completely decisive ; that&nbsp;of 1829 was celebrated for the successful
                passage of the&nbsp;Balkan by the Russian general Diebitsch<sub>1</sub> and was
                closed&nbsp;in September by the peace of Adrianople, in which Turkey&nbsp;consented
                to several articles both humiliating and injurious.&nbsp;Russia received but a
                slight direct accession of territory, but&nbsp;obtained a confirmation of the right
                of her vessels to navigate&nbsp;the Black Sea, a definitive settlement of frontier
                towards&nbsp;Turkey, and a recognition of such restrictions on the Turkish
                government of Moldavia and Wallachia as materially&nbsp;weakened the sultan’s power.
                The fortresses of these provinces were moreover to be garrisoned by Russian
                troops,&nbsp;till the Porte should have paid to Russia the expenses of&nbsp;the war
                ; and accordingly the provinces were not evacuated till 1834. Diplomatic skill, and
                other means less justifiable, strengthened the hold of Russia on the Porte,
                whose&nbsp;weakness was completely exposed in 1832, when Russian&nbsp;troops
                appeared as its protectors against its own rebellious&nbsp;subject the viceroy of
                Egypt. Turkey, in short, has in the&nbsp;mean time thrown herself unreservedly under
                the influence&nbsp;of Russia, and it appears not improbable that the course
                of&nbsp;events may very soon allow that influence a yet more favourable field. The
                most conspicuous incident of recent&nbsp;Russian history on the side of India has
                been the war with&nbsp;Persia, commenced in 1826, carried on successfully by
                the&nbsp;generals Yermoloft'and Paskewitsch<sub>1</sub> and terminated in
                1828&nbsp;by the cession of some important provinces to Russia. (See</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Persia.) Since that time, both in
                Persia and in the neutral countries on the frontiers of British India, there is
                little reason to doubt that the Russian diplomacy has been acquiring an increasing
                influence. The only actual accession&nbsp;of territory to Russia in this quarter
                that deserves notice&nbsp;was given in 1829 by the revolt of the Kirghis
                Tartars,&nbsp;formerly subject to China, who now placed themselves under the
                sovereignty of Russia, and brought the Russian&nbsp;frontier nearer by another step
                to our Asiatic possessions.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Internally Russia has had to contend with incursions of' the
                Caucasian hordes from beyond the frontier, with revolts &lt;&nbsp;of the Lesghians
                and other tribes nominally subject to the<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>empire, and lately with
                an extensive and spirited insurrection of the Circassians, which it has not yet been
                possible&nbsp;to quell.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The domestic government of Nicholas has little to dis- : tinguish it
                from tbat of his brother. Education has been </span><span class="font0"

                been by<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Alexander ; the Catholic and Lutheran churches

                missions to the Calmucks and other nomadic hordes;&nbsp;trade and manufactures have
                been furthered by regulations&nbsp;devised with much intelligence ; and the laws
                have since&nbsp;1826 received a tolerably complete revision and
                concentration.</span></p>

        <p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">STATISTICS.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The Russian empire is of enormous extent, of vast resources, and of
                great capacity of improvement. It forms a connected territory, extending from the
                frontiers of Germany and Prussia, and the shores of the Gulf of
                Bothnia,&nbsp;eastward to the sea which separates Asia from America,&nbsp;thus
                embracing nearly one half of Europe and all the north&nbsp;of Asia. Beyond Behring’s
                Straits it extends over a portion&nbsp;of the north-west territory of America,
                embracing at the&nbsp;same time a number of islands situated in the ocean
                which&nbsp;washes the northern shores of Europe and Asia, and flows&nbsp;between
                Asia and America. Its most westerly point is in&nbsp;longitude 18°
                20<sup>,</sup>15&quot;, and its most easterly in 209° 14' east&nbsp;from Greenwich,
                thus extending through about 190 degrees of longitude. Its northern and southern
                boundaries&nbsp;have deep indentations ; the extreme points of the former&nbsp;are
                in 78° 4<sup>,</sup>, and of the latter in 38° 40<sup>,</sup> of north
                latitude.&nbsp;This empire embraces about the one-ninth (some estimate&nbsp;it as
                high as the one-seventh) part of the habitable globe,&nbsp;the one-fourteenth part
                of tbe northern hemisphere, and&nbsp;above the one twenty-eighth part of the
                superficies of our&nbsp;planet. The whole of China is not equal to two thirds
                of&nbsp;Russia ; and the Roman empire, at the period of its greatest extension, did
                not comprehend more than one fourth of&nbsp;the territory which now bows to the
                sceptre of the czar.&nbsp;Some have included the mountains of Caucasus, others
                the&nbsp;whole of the Caspian Sea, whilst some again have omitted&nbsp;the one and
                not the other. A very elaborate calculation of&nbsp;the superficies of Russia has,
                within these few years, been&nbsp;published by M. Sernoff, who has invented an
                improved&nbsp;method of computing areas, by which he can allow for
                the&nbsp;inequalities of boundaries. “ Russia in Europe, including&nbsp;Russian
                Poland and the islands of the Baltic and German&nbsp;Ocean, contains
