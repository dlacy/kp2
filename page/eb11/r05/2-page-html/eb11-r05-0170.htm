<p><span class="font0">has left </span><span class="font1">us </span><span class="font0">many exquisite lyrics. A genuine bard of the people, and one of their most truly national authors, was Alexis&nbsp;Koltsov (1809-1842), the son of a tallow merchant of&nbsp;Voronezh. He has left us a few exquisite lyrics, which&nbsp;are to be found in all the collections of Russian poetry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He died of consumption after a protracted illness. Another poet who much resembled Koltsov was Ivan Nikitin (1826-1861), born in the same town, Voronezh. His best&nbsp;poem was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kulak.</span><span class="font0"> Nildtin, to support his relations, was obliged&nbsp;to keep an inn; this he was afterwards enabled to change for the&nbsp;more congenial occupation of a bookseller. The novel in Russia &lt;&nbsp;has had its cultivators in Zagoskin and Lazhechnikov, who imitated&nbsp;Sir Walter Scott. The most celebrated of the romances&nbsp;of Zagoskin was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Yuri Miloslavskiy,</span><span class="font0"> a tale of the expulsion&nbsp;of the Poles from Russia in 1612. The book may even yet be&nbsp;read with interest: it çives a very spirited picture of the times;&nbsp;unfortunately, a gloss is put upon the barbarity of the manners&nbsp;of the period. Among the better known productions of Lazhechnikov are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Heretic</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Palace of Ice. A</span><span class="font0"> flashy but now&nbsp;forgotten writer of novels was Thaddeus Bulgarin (1789-1859)&nbsp;author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ivan Vyshigin,</span><span class="font0"> a work which once enjoyed considerable</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">popularity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first Russian novelist of great and original talent was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nicholai Gogol (1809-1852) (g.r.). In his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dead Souls</span><span class="font0"> he satirized all classes of society, some of the portraits being wonderfully vivid. Being a native of Little Russia, he describes&nbsp;its scenery and the habits of the people, especially in such stories&nbsp;as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Old-Fashioned Household,</span><span class="font0"> or in the more powerful </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Taras</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bulba.</span><span class="font0"> This last is a highly wrought story, giving us a picture of the savage warfare carried on between the Cossacks and Poles.&nbsp;Gogol was also the author of a good comedy, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Reviser,</span><span class="font0"> wherein&nbsp;the petty pilferings of Russian municipal authorities are satirized.&nbsp;In his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of a Madman</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Portrait,</span><span class="font0"> he shows a weird and&nbsp;fantastic power which proves him to have been a man of strong&nbsp;imagination. The same may be said of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Cloak,</span><span class="font0"> and the curious&nbsp;tale </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vii</span><span class="font0"> (“ The Demon ”), where he gives us a picture of Kiev in&nbsp;the old days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the field of fiction Gogol had various famous successors, concerning whom details will be found in separate articles. It must suffice here to enumerate Alexander Herzen (d. 1869);&nbsp;Ivan Goncharov (1812-1891); Dmitri Grigorovich (1822-1899), author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Fisherman</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Emigrants;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alexis Pisemskiy (1822-1900); Michael Saltikov (1826-1889); Feodor Dostoievskiy (1821-1881); Alexander Ostrovskiy (1823-1886); Feodor Ricshetnikov (1841-1871); Count A. Tolstoy&nbsp;(1817-1875), also famous as a dramatist; and greater than all these&nbsp;Ivan Turgeniev (1819-1883), and Count L. Tolstoy (1828-1910),&nbsp;the last of whom ranks as much more than a man of letters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Vissarion Belinski the Russians produced their best critic. For thirteen years (1834-47) he was the Aristarchus of&nbsp;Russian literature ana exercised a healthy influence. In his later&nbsp;days he addressed a withering epistle to Gogol on the newly adopted&nbsp;reactionary views of the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since the time of Karamzin the study of Russian history has made great strides. He was followed by Nicholas Polevoy (1775-1842), who wrote what he called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Russian&nbsp;People</span><span class="font0"> (6 vols., 1829-33), but his work was not received&nbsp;with much favour. Polevoy was a self-educated man, the&nbsp;son of a Siberian merchant; besides editing a well-known Russian&nbsp;journal, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Telegraph</span><span class="font0"> (suppressed in 1834), he was also the author&nbsp;of many plays, among others a translation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet.</span><span class="font0"> Since his&nbsp;time, however, the English dramatist has been produced in a more&nbsp;perfect dress by Kroneberg, Druzhinin and others. Sergius Soloviev (1820-1879) was the author of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Russia</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;may be described rather as a quarry of materials for future historians of Russia than an actual history. In 1885 died N. Kostomarov, the writer of many valuable monographs, of which those&nbsp;on Bogdan Khmelnitskiy and the False Demetrius deserve special&nbsp;mention. From 1847 ^0 1854. Kostomarov, whose interest in the&nbsp;history of Little Russia and its literature made him suspected of&nbsp;separatist views, wrote nothing, having been banished to Saratov,&nbsp;and forbidden to teach or publish. But after this time his literary&nbsp;activity began again, ana, besides separate works, the leading&nbsp;Russian reviews, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Old and New Russia, The Historical&nbsp;Messenger,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Messenger of Europe,</span><span class="font0"> contained many contributions from his pen of the highest value. Constantine Kavelin&nbsp;(1818-1855) was the author of many valuable works on Russian&nbsp;law, and Kalatchev published a classical edition of the old Russian&nbsp;codes. Ilovaiskiy and Gedeonov attempted to upset the general&nbsp;belief that the founders of the Russian empire were Scandinavians.&nbsp;A good history of Russia (1855) was published by N. Ustrialov,&nbsp;but his most celebrated work was his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tzarstvovanie Petra Velikago&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(“ Reign of Peter the Great ”); in this many important documents&nbsp;first saw the light, and the circumstances of the death of the unfortunate Alexis were made clear. Russian writers of history&nbsp;have not generally occupied themselves with any other subject&nbsp;than that of their own country, but an exception may be found&nbsp;in the writings of Timofei Granovskiy (1813-1855), such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Abbé&nbsp;Suger</span><span class="font0"> (1849) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Four Historical Portraits</span><span class="font0"> (1850). So also Kudriav-tsov, who died in 1850, wrote on The Fortunes of Italy, from&nbsp;the Fall of the Roman Empire of the West tilt its Reconstruction&nbsp;by Charlemagne.” He also wrote on “ The Roman Women as&nbsp;described by Tacitus.” We may add Kareyev, professor at Warsaw,&nbsp;who wrote on the condition of the French peasantry before the&nbsp;Revolution. Other writers on Russian history have been H.&nbsp;Pogodine (d. 1873), who compiled a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Russia till the Invasion of the Mongols</span><span class="font0"> (1871), and especially I. Zabielin, who has&nbsp;written a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Russian Life from the most Remote Times&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1876), and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Private Lives of the Czarinas</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Czars</span><span class="font0"> (1869 and&nbsp;1872) and a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Moscow.</span><span class="font0"> Leshkov has written a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History&nbsp;of Russian Law to the 18th Century,</span><span class="font0"> and Tchitcherin a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;Provincial Institutions in Russia in the 17th Century</span><span class="font0"> (1856). To&nbsp;these must be added the work of Zagoskin, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Law in the&nbsp;State of Muscovy</span><span class="font0"> (Kazan, 1877). Professor Michael Kovalevskiy, of&nbsp;the university of Moscow, wrote an excellent work on Communal&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Land Tenure,</span><span class="font0"> in which he investigates the remains of this custom&nbsp;throughout the world. In 1885 Dubrovin published an excellent&nbsp;history of the revolt of Pugachev. The valuable work by Alexander Pypin (b. 1833) and Vladimir Spasovich, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Slavonic&nbsp;Literatures,</span><span class="font0"> is the most complete account of the subject, and has&nbsp;been made more generally accessible by the German translation&nbsp;of Pech. N. Tikhonravov (1832-1893) wrote a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle of Russian&nbsp;Literature and Antiquities</span><span class="font0"> (5 vols., 1859^61). The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;Slavonic Literature</span><span class="font0"> by Schafarik, published in 1826, has long been&nbsp;antiquated. A history of Russian literature, by Paul Polevoy has&nbsp;appeared, which has gone through two editions. The account of&nbsp;the Polish rebellion of 1863 by Berg, published in 1873, which&nbsp;gave many startling and picturesque episodes of the celebrated&nbsp;struggle, was withdrawn from circulation. It appeared originally&nbsp;in the pages of the Russian magazine </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Starina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nicholas Nekrasov, who died in 1877, left six volumes of poetry which in many respects remind us of the writings of Crabbe; the&nbsp;poet is of that realistic school in which Russian authors&nbsp;so much resemble English. Another writer of poetry&nbsp;deserving mention is Ogariev, for a long time the companion in&nbsp;exile of Herzen in England; many of his compositions appeared&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polar Star</span><span class="font0"> of thé latter, which contains the interesting&nbsp;autobiographical sketches of Herzen, entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Byloe i Dumi</span><span class="font0"> (&quot;The&nbsp;Past and my Thoughts ”). Apollon Maikov (1821-1847) at one&nbsp;time enjoyed great popularity as a poet; he is a kind of link with&nbsp;Pushkin, of whose elegance of versification he is an imitator.&nbsp;Another poet of a past generation was Prince Viazemskiy (1792-1878). Graceful lyrics were written by Mei, Fet (whose name&nbsp;would apparently prove Dutch extraction, Veth), Stcherbina, and,&nbsp;going a little further back, Yazykov, the friend of Pushkin, and&nbsp;Khomiakov, celebrated for his Slavophile propensities. To these&nbsp;may be added Mdlle Zhadovskaya, Benediktov, Podolinskiy and&nbsp;Tiutchev. Polonskiy (1820-1898) contributed exquisite lyrics to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Viestnik Yevropî.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Excellent works on subjects connected with Slavonic philology have been published by Vostokov, who edited the Ostromir Codex,&nbsp;and Sreznevskiy and Bodianskiy, who put forth an edition&nbsp;of the celebrated codex used at Reims for the coronation&nbsp;of the French kings. After their deaths their work was&nbsp;carried on by Professor Grot </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Philological Investigations,</span><span class="font0"> also many&nbsp;critical editions of Russian classics), Budilovich, professor at Warsaw,&nbsp;Potcbnya of Kharkov, and Baudoin de Courtenay, who, among&nbsp;other services to philology, has described the Slavonic dialect&nbsp;spoken by the Resanians, a tribe living in Italy, in two villages&nbsp;of the Julian Alps. The songs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(byliny)</span><span class="font0"> of the Russians have been&nbsp;collected by Zakrevskiy, Rybnikov, Hilferding, Barsov and others,&nbsp;and their national tales by Sakharov, Afanasiev and Erlenvein.&nbsp;Kotliarevskiy, Tereshenko and others have treated of their customs&nbsp;and superstitions. S. Stanislaus Mikutskiy, professor at the university of Warsaw, has published his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Materials for a Dictionary of&nbsp;the Roots of the Russian and all Slavonic Dialects,</span><span class="font0"> but it represents&nbsp;a somewhat obsolete school of philology. The Early Russian&nbsp;Text Society continues its useful labours, and has edited many&nbsp;interesting monuments of the older Slavonic literature. Two&nbsp;valuable codices have been printed in Ru ssia, Zographus and&nbsp;Marianus, interesting versions of the Gospels in Palaeoslavonic.&nbsp;They were edited, by the learned Croat Jagic, who occupied the&nbsp;chair of Sreznevskiy in St Petersburg. An excellent </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tolkovi Slovar&nbsp;Velikorusskago Yazîka</span><span class="font0"> (&quot; Explanatory Dictionary of the Great&nbsp;Russian Language ”) was compiled by Vladimir Dahl. Alexander&nbsp;Hilferding published some valuable works on ethnology and philology» among others on the Polabs, an extinct Slavonic tribe who&nbsp;once dwelt on the banks of the Elbe. The Russians have not&nbsp;exhibited many works in the field of classical or other branches&nbsp;of philology. Exception, however, must be made of the studies&nbsp;of Tchubinov in Georgian, Minayev in the Indian and Tsvetayev&nbsp;in the old languages of Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In moral and mental philosophy the Russians have produced but few authors. We meet with some good mathematicians, Lobachevsldy&nbsp;among others, and in natural science the publications of the Society&nbsp;for Natural History at Moscow have attracted considerable attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Recent Literature.</span><span class="font0">—The death of Nekrasov in 1877 deprived Russia of her most eminent poet since the days of Pushkin and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
