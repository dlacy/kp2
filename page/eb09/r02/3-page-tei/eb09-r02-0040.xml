Thus the M. levatores costarum arise from the transverse processes of the 7th cervical and eleven upper dorsal vertebræ, and are attached to the ribs below in series ; the M. scaleni spring from the cervical vertebræ, and are attached to the anterior parts of the first and second ribs ; he M. sterno-cleido-mastoidei arise from the side and back of the skull, and are inserted into the upper part of the sternum and the clavicle ; the M. pectoralis minor arises from the coracoid process of the scapula, and is inserted into the anterior ends of some of the ribs ; the M. serratus posticus superior arises from certain of the cervical and dorsal vertebræ, and is inserted into the posterior part of certain of the ribs ; the M. cervicalis ascendens (part of the M. erector spinæ) arises from certain of the cervical vertebræ, and is inserted into the posterior part of certain ribs. The M. serratus magnus and the M. pectoralis major, which are affixed on the one hand to the upper arm and to the scapula respectively and on the other to the ribs and to the sternum respectively, may in certain elevated positions of the arm and shoulder act as in</p><p>spiratory muscles. When</p><p>all these muscles contract,</p><p>the ribs are raised in the</p><p>twofold way already de</p><p>scribed, some pulling up</p><p>the anterior ends of the</p><p>ribs, and others causing</p><p>the arched ribs to rotate</p><p>about an axis passing</p><p>through their vertebral</p><p>and sternal joints.</p><p>In addition to the muscles just enumerated the M. intercostales externi are undoubtedly inspiratory muscles. Every external intercostal muscular fibre between a pair of ribs must, when it contracts, of necessity raise <hi rend="italic">both</hi>  ribs, as is clearly shown by the'accompanying diagram (fig. 6). Here <hi rend="italic">a'd</hi>  must be shorter than <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi>  for if BAα=sc, then</p><p>αδ<hi rend="sup">2</hi>=AB<hi rend="sup">2</hi> + (Bδ - Aα)<hi rend="sup">2 </hi>+ 2AB (Bδ - ∆α) cos<hi rend="italic">x ;</hi></p><p>hence <hi rend="italic">ab</hi>  will be larger the</p><p>smaller the angle <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>  for the</p><p>cosine increases as the angle</p><p>diminishes.</p><p>By a similar geometrical treatment of the question it may be shown that the in-tefnal intercostal muscles when they contract must of necessity depress both the ribs to which they are attached. If the angle BAc'=x (fig. 7), then</p><p>c'&lt;Z'<hi rend="sup">2</hi>=AB<hi rend="sup">2</hi> + (Ac'- B&lt;Z')<hi rend="sup">2</hi> - 2AB(Ac<hi rend="sup">,</hi>-B&lt;Z') cos<hi rend="italic">x ; </hi>hence <hi rend="italic">e'd'</hi>  will be larger the larger the angle <hi rend="italic">x.</hi></p><p>The case, however, is not so clear with reference to the anterior portions of the internal intercostals which lie between the cartilages ; for it is evident that these fibres have the same direction with regard to the sternum as an axis as the external intercostals have with regard to the vertebral column as an axis ; that is to say, the geometrical diagram in fig. 6 applies to the intercartilaginous internal intercostals as perfectly as it does to the interosseous parts of the external intercostals, the inference being that the intercartilaginous internal intercostals tend to elevate the pair of ribs between which they stretch. The geometrical argument is, however, overborne by physiological experiment: Martin and Hartwell have observed in the dog and the cat that the internal intercostals throughout their whole extent contract (not synchronously) but alternately with the diaphragm ; hence we must conclude that their function throughout is not inspiratory like that of the diaphragm, but expiratory.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Movements of the Diaphragm.—</hi>The muscular fibres of the diaphragm are arranged in a radial manner, or more strictly speaking in a manner like the lines of longitude on a terrestrial globe. The central tendon of the diaphragm corresponds to the pole of such a globe. The contraction of the fibres is expended on straightening the longitudinal curves rather than on pulling down the central tendon to a lower level ; in fact the central tendon moves very little in ordinary respiration.</p><p><hi rend="italic">How the Expiratory Movements are Produced.—</hi>The action of inspiration disturbs many organs from the position of rest into which gravity and their own physical properties have thrown them. The ribs and sternum are raised from the position of lowest level ; the elastic costal cartilages are twisted ; the elastic lungs are put upon the stretch ; the abdominal organs, themselves elastic, are compressed and thrust against the elastic walls of the belly, causing these to bulge outwards. In short the very act of inspiration stores up, as it were, in sundry ways the forces which make for expiration. As soon as the inspiratory muscles cease to act these forces come into play, and the position of rest or equilibrium is regained. It is very doubtful whether any special expiratory muscles are called into action during ordinary respiration. The internal intercostals may in man be exercised in ordinary expiration (although they are certainly not so exercised in the dog and the cat); but in laboured expiration many muscles assist in the expulsive effort. The muscles forming the belly walls contract and force the abdominal contents against the relaxed diaphragm in such a manner as to drive it farther and farther into the thorax. At the same time by their attachment to the lower edge of the thorax these same muscles pull down the ribs and sternum. The M. triangularis sterni, which arises from the back or thoracic aspect of the sternum and lower costal cartilages and is inserted into the costal cartilages higher up, can obviously depress the ribs. So also can the M. serratus posticus inferior, which arises from the thick fascia of the loins and is inserted into the last four ribs. So also can the M. quadratus lumborum, which springs from the pelvis and is attached to the last rib. Indeed there is hardly a muscle of the body but may be called into play during extremely laboured respiration, either because it acts on the chest, or because it serves to steady some part and give a better purchase for the action of direct respiratory muscles.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Certain Abnormal Forms of Respiration.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Coughing.—</hi>There is first a deep inspiration followed by closure of the glottis. Then follows a violent expiratory effort which bursts open the glottis and drives the air out of thé lungs in a blast which carries away any light irritating matter it may meet with. The act is commonly involuntary, but may be imitated exactly by a voluntary efibrt.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hawking, or Clearing the Throat.—</hi>In this act a current of air is driven from the lungs and forced through the narrow space betλveen the root of the tongue and the depressed soft palate. This action can only be caused voluntarily.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sneezing.—</hi>There is first an inspiration which is often unusually rapid ; then follows a sudden expiration and the blast is directed through the nose. The glottis remains open all the time. The act is generally involuntary, but may be more or less successfully imitated by a voluntary effort.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Snoring</hi>  is caused by unusually steady and prolonged inspirations and expirations through the open mouth,—the soft palate and uvula being set vibrating by the currents of air.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Crying</hi>  consists of short deep inspirations and prolonged expirations with the glottis partially closed. Long-continued crying leads to sobbing, in which sudden spasmodic contractions of the diaphragm cause sudden inspirations and inspiratory sounds generated in larynx and pharynx.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sighing</hi>  is a sudden and prolpnged inspiration following an unusually long pause after the last expiration.</p></body></text></TEI>
