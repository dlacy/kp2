According to 1 Sam. iii. 3, 15, this sanctuary was not a tabernacle but a temple, with doors. But the priestly narrator of Josh. xviii. 1 has it that the tabernacle was set up there by Joshua after the conquest. In Judges xxi. 19 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> the yearly feast at Shiloh appears as of merely local character. Shiloh seems to have beep destroyed by the Philistines after the disastrous battle of Ebenezer; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Jeremiah vii. 12 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi> The position described in Judges, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit. (cf. Onomastica,</hi> ed. Lagarde, p. 152), gives certainty to the identification with the modern Séilûn lying some 2 miles east-south-east of Lubbán (Lebonah), on the road from Bethel to Shechem. Here there is a ruined village, with a flat double-topped hill behind it, offering a strong position, which suggests that the place was a stronghold as well as a sanctuary. A smiling and fertile landscape surrounds the hill. The name Seilûn corresponds to <hi rend="italic">Σ</hi> ιλούν in Josephus. LXX. has <hi rend="italic">Σηλω, Σηλώμ.</hi> The forms given in the Hebrew Bible (r⅛tr, l5&amp;gt; <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ty) have dropped the final consonant, which reappears in the adjective OiS <hi rend="sup">,</hi> K <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ∙ On Shiloh in Gen. xlix. 10 see Judah.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
