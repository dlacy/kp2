<p><span class="font0">van-guard, put many of the Epirots to the ſword, and took ſome of their elephants. Curius encouraged with&nbsp;this ſucceſs, marched his army into theTauraſian fields,&nbsp;and drew it up in a plain which was wide enough for&nbsp;his troops, but too narrow for the Epirot phalanx, the&nbsp;phalangites being ſo crowded that they could not handle&nbsp;their arms without difficulty. But the king’s eagerneſs&nbsp;to try his ſtrength and ſkill with ſo renowned a com-’ mander, made him engage at that great diſadvantage.&nbsp;Upon the firſt ſignal the action began ; and one of the&nbsp;king’s wings giving way, the victory ſeemed to incline&nbsp;to the Romans. But that wing where the king fought&nbsp;in perſon repulſed the enemy, and drove them back&nbsp;quite to their intrenchments. This advantage was in&nbsp;great part owing to the elephants ; which Curius perceiving, commanded a corps de reſerve, which he had&nbsp;poſted near the camp, to advance and fall upon the elephants. Theſe carrying burning torches in one hand,&nbsp;and their ſwords in the other, threw the former at the&nbsp;elephants, and with the latter defended themſelves&nbsp;againſt their guides ; by which means they were both&nbsp;forced to give way. The elephants being put to flight&nbsp;broke into the phalanx, cloſe as it was, and there cauſed&nbsp;a general diſorder ; which was increaſed by a remarkable accident: for it is ſaid, that a young elephant being wounded, and thereupon making a dreadful noiſe,&nbsp;the mother quitting her rank, and haſtening to the aſſiſtance of her young one, put thoſe who ſtill kept their&nbsp;ranks into the utmoſt confuſion. But, however that&nbsp;be, it is certain that the Romans obtained at laſt a complete victory. Oroſius and Eutropius tell us that&nbsp;Pyrrhus’s army conſiſted of 80,000 foot and 6ooo&nbsp;horſe, including his Epirots and allies ; whereas the&nbsp;conſular army was ſcarce 20,000 ſtrong. Thoſe who&nbsp;exaggerate the king’s loſs ſay, that the number of the&nbsp;ſlain on his ſide amounted to 30,000 men ; but others&nbsp;reduce it to 20,000. All writers agree, that Curius&nbsp;took 1200 priſoners and eight elephants. This victory,&nbsp;which was the moſt deciſive Rome had ever gained,&nbsp;brought all Italy under ſubjection, and paved the way&nbsp;for thoſe vaſt conqueſts which afterwards made the&nbsp;Romans maſters of the whole know<sup>r</sup>n world.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pyrrhus being no way in a condition, after the great loſs he had ſuſtained, to keep the field, retired to Ta-rentuιh<sup>,</sup>, attended only by a ſmall body of horſe, leaving the Romans in full poſſeſſion of his camp ; which&nbsp;they ſo much admired, that they made it ever after a&nbsp;model to form theirs by. And now the king of Epirus reſolved to leave Italy as ſoon as poſſible; but concealed his deſign, and endeavoured to keep up the&nbsp;drooping ſpirits of his allies, by giving them hopes of&nbsp;ſpeedy ſuccours from Greece. Accordingly he diſpatched ambaſſadors into Ætolia, Illyricum, and Macedon, demanding ſupplies of men and money. But&nbsp;the anſwers from thoſe courts not proving ſavourable,&nbsp;he forged ſuch as might pleaſe thoſe whom he was willing to deceive ; and by this means ſupported the courage of his friends, and kept his enemy in play. When&nbsp;he could conceal his departure no longer, he pretended&nbsp;to be on a ſudden in a great paſſion at the dilatorineſs&nbsp;of his friends in ſending him ſuccours ; and acquainted&nbsp;the Tarentines, that he muſt go and bring them over&nbsp;himſelf. However, he leſt behind him a ſtrong garriſon in the citadel of Tarentum, under the command of&nbsp;the ſame Milo who had kept it for him during his ſtay&nbsp;in Sicily. In order to keep this governor in his duty,&nbsp;he is ſaid to have made him a very ſtrange preſent, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">viz.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a chair covered with the fl&lt;in of Nicias, the treacherous&nbsp;phyſician, who had offered Fabricius to poiſon his ma-' ſter. After all theſe diſguiſes and precautions, Pyrrhus&nbsp;at laſt ſet ſail for Epirus, and arrived ſafe at Acrocerau-nimn with 8000 foot and 500 horſe; after having&nbsp;ſpent to no purpoſe ſix years in Italy and Sicily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though, from the manner in which Pyrrhus took his leave, his Italian allies had little reaſon to expect&nbsp;any further aſſiſtance from him, yet they continued to&nbsp;amuſe themſelves with vain hopes, till certain accounts&nbsp;arrived of his being killed at the ſiege of Argos, as has&nbsp;been related under the article Epirus. This threw&nbsp;the Samnites into deſpair : ſo that they put all to the&nbsp;iſſue of a general battle ; in which they were defeated&nbsp;with fιιch dreadful ſlaughter, that the nation is ſaid to&nbsp;have been almoſt exterminated. This overthrow was&nbsp;ſoon followed by the ſubmiſſion of the Lucanians, Bruttians, Tarentines, Sarcinates, Picentes, and Salentines ;&nbsp;ſo that Rome now became miſtreſs of all the nations&nbsp;from the remoteſt parts of Hetruria to the Ionian ſea,&nbsp;and from the Tyrrhenian ſea to the Adriatic. All theſe&nbsp;nations, however, did not enjoy the ſame privileges.&nbsp;Some were entirely ſubject to the republic, and had no&nbsp;laws but what they received from thence ; others retained their old laws and cuſtoms, but in ſubjection to&nbsp;the republic : ſome were tributary; and others allies,&nbsp;who were obliged to furniſh troops at their own expence when the Romans required. Some had the privilege of Roman citizenſhip, their ſoldiers being incorporated in the legions; while others had a right of ſuffrage in the elections made by the centuries. Theſe&nbsp;different degrees of honour, privileges, and liberty, were&nbsp;founded on the different terms granted to the conquered nations when they ſurrendered, and were afterwards&nbsp;increaſed according to their fidelity and the ſervices&nbsp;they did the republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Romans now became reſpected by foreign nations, and received ambaſſadors from Ptolemy Philadel-phus king of Egypt, and from Apollonia a city of Macedon. Senſible of their own importance, they now granted protection to whatever nation requeſted it of&nbsp;them ; but this not with a view of ſerving one party,&nbsp;but that they might have an opportunity of ſubjecting&nbsp;both. In this manner they aſſiſted the Mamertines&nbsp;againſt Hiero king of Syracuſe, which brought on the&nbsp;wars with the Carthaginians, which terminated in the&nbsp;total deſtruction of that ancient republic, as has been&nbsp;related under the article Carthage. The interval between the firſt and ſecond Punic wars was by the Romans employed in reducing the Boii and Ligurians,&nbsp;who had revolted. Theſe were Gauliſh nations, who&nbsp;had always been very formidable to the Romans, and&nbsp;now gave one of their conſuls a notable defeat. However, he ſoon after ſufficiently revenged himſelf, and&nbsp;defeated the enemy with great ſlaughter ; though it&nbsp;was not till ſome time after, and with a good deal of&nbsp;difficulty, that they were totally ſubdued. During this&nbsp;interval alſo, the Romans ſeized on the iſlands of Sardinia, Corſica, and Malta ; and in the year 219 B. C.&nbsp;the two former were reduced to the form of a province.&nbsp;Papirius, who had ſubdued Corſica, demanded a triumph ;&nbsp;but not having intereſt enough to obtain it, he took </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">method entirely new to do himſelf juſtice.
