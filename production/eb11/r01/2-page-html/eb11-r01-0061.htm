<p><span class="font0">that no such dependence on free competition was possible, either in practice or in theory. This difficulty is not peculiar&nbsp;to railways; but it was in the history of railway economy&nbsp;and railway control that certain characteristics which are&nbsp;now manifesting themselves in all directions where large&nbsp;investments of fixed capital are involved were first brought&nbsp;prominently to public notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For a large number of those who use a railway, competition in its more obvious forms does not and cannot exist. Independent carriers cannot run trains over the same line and&nbsp;underbid one another in offering transportation services. It&nbsp;would be practically impossible for a line thus used by different&nbsp;carriers to be operated either with safety, or with economy, or&nbsp;with the advantage to the public which a centralized management affords. It is equally impossible for the majority of&nbsp;shippers to enjoy the competition of parallel lines. Such duplication of railways involves a waste of capital. If parallel lines&nbsp;compete at all points, they cause ruin to the investors. If&nbsp;they compete at some points and not at others, they produce&nbsp;a discrimination or preference with regard to rates and facilities,&nbsp;which builds up the competitive points at the expense of the&nbsp;non-competitive ones. Such partial competition, with the&nbsp;discrimination it involves, is liable to be worse for the public&nbsp;than no competition at all. It increases the tendency, already&nbsp;too strong, towards concentration of industrial life in large&nbsp;towns. It produces an uncertainty with regard to rates which&nbsp;prevents stability of prices, and is apt to promote the interests&nbsp;of the unscrupulous speculator at the expense of those whose&nbsp;business methods are more conservative. So marked are these&nbsp;evils that such partial competition is avoided by agreements&nbsp;between the competing lines with regard to rates, and by divisions&nbsp;of traffic, or pools, which shall take away the temptation to&nbsp;violate such rate agreements. The common law has been&nbsp;somewhat unfavourable to the enforcement of such agreements,&nbsp;and statutes in the United States, both local and national, have&nbsp;attempted to prohibit them; but the public advantage from&nbsp;their existence has been so great as to render their legal disabilities inoperative. In those parts of the continent of Europe&nbsp;where railways are owned and administered by state authority,&nbsp;the necessity for such agreements is frankly admitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But if rates are to be fixed by agreement, and not by competition, what principle can be recognized as a legitimate basis of railway rate-making? The first efforts at railway legislation were governed by the equal mileage principle; that is,&nbsp;the attempt was made to make rates proportionate to the&nbsp;distance. It was, however, soon seen that this was inadmissible.&nbsp;So much of the expense of the handling, both of freight and of&nbsp;passengers, was independent of the length of the journey that&nbsp;a mileage rate sufficiently large for short distances was unnecessarily burdensome for long ones, and was bound to destroy&nbsp;long-distance traffic, if the theory were consistently applied.&nbsp;The system has been retained in large measure in passenger&nbsp;business, but only because of the conflict which inevitably&nbsp;occurs between the authorities and the passengers with regard&nbsp;to the privilege of breaking and resuming a journey when&nbsp;passenger rates are arranged on any other plan. In freight&nbsp;schedules it has been completely abandoned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A somewhat better theory of rate regulation was then framed, which divided railway expenditures into movement expense,&nbsp;connected with the line in general, and terminal expense,&nbsp;which connected itself with the stations and station service.&nbsp;Under this system each consignment of freight is compelled to&nbsp;pay its share of the terminal expense, independently of distance,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plus</span><span class="font0"> a mileage charge proportionate to the length of the journey&nbsp;or haul. There has been also a further attempt in England&nbsp;to divide terminal charges into station and service terminals,&nbsp;according to the nature of the work for which compensation is&nbsp;sought. But none of these classifications of expense reaches&nbsp;the root of the matter. A system of charges which compels&nbsp;each piece of traffic to pay its share of the charges for track and&nbsp;for stations overlooks the fundamental fact that a very large&nbsp;part of the expenses of a railway—more than half—is not&nbsp;connected either with the cost of moving traffic or of handling&nbsp;traffic at stations, but with the cost of maintaining the property&nbsp;as a whole. Of this character are the expenditures necessary&nbsp;for maintenance of way, for general administration and for&nbsp;interest on capital borrowed, which are almost independent&nbsp;of the total amount of business done, and quite independent of&nbsp;any individual piece of business. To say that all traffic must bear&nbsp;its share of these interest and maintenance charges is to impose&nbsp;upon the railways a rate which would cut off much of the long-distance traffic, and much of the traffic in cheap articles, which&nbsp;is of great value to the public, and which, from its very magni-tude, is a thing that railways could not afford to lose. It is also&nbsp;a fact that with each recurring decade these general expenses&nbsp;(also called indirect, undistributed or fixed charges) have an&nbsp;increased importance as compared with the particular (direct,&nbsp;distributed or operating) expense attaching naturally to the&nbsp;particular portions of the traffic. For with increased density&nbsp;of population it becomes profitable to make improvements on&nbsp;the original location, even though this may involve increased&nbsp;charges for interest and for some parts of its maintenance, for&nbsp;the sake of securing that economy of operation, through larger&nbsp;train-loads, which such an improved location makes possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whatever the ostensible form of a railway tariff, the contribution of the different shipments of freight to these general expenses is determined on the principle of charging what the&nbsp;traffic will bear. Under this principle, rates are reduced where&nbsp;the increase of business which follows such reduction makes the&nbsp;change a profitable one. They are kept relatively high in those&nbsp;cases where the expansion of business which follows a reduction&nbsp;is small, and where such a change is therefore unprofitable.&nbsp;This theory of charging what the traffic will bear is an unpopular one, because it has been misapplied by railway managers&nbsp;and made an excuse for charging what the traffic will not bear.&nbsp;Rightly applied, however, it is the only sound economic principle.&nbsp;It means taxation according to ability—that ability being&nbsp;determined by actual experiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the practical carrying out of this principle, railways divide all articles of freight into classes, the highest of which are charged&nbsp;two or three, or even four times the rates of the lowest. This&nbsp;classification is based partly upon special conditions of service,&nbsp;which make some articles more economical to carry than others&nbsp;(with particular reference to the question whether the goods&nbsp;are offered to the companies in car-loads or in smàll parcels),&nbsp;but chiefly with regard to the commercial value of the article,&nbsp;and its consequent ability to bear a high charge or a low one.&nbsp;For each of these classes a rate-sheet gives the actual rate-charge per unit of weight between the various stations covered&nbsp;by the tariff. This rate increases as the distance increases,&nbsp;but not in equal proportion; while the rates from large trade&nbsp;centres to other trade centres at a great distance are not higher&nbsp;than those to intermediate points somewhat less remote; if&nbsp;the law permits, there is a tendency to make them actually&nbsp;a little lower. Besides the system of charges thus prescribed&nbsp;in the classification and rate-sheet, each tariff provides for a&nbsp;certain number of special rates or charges made for particular&nbsp;lines of trade in certain localities, independently of their relation&nbsp;to the general system. If these special rates are published in&nbsp;the tariff, and are offered to all persons alike, provided they&nbsp;can fulfil the conditions imposed by the company, they are&nbsp;known as commodity rates, and arc apparently a necessity&nbsp;in any scheme of railway charges. If, however, they are not&nbsp;published, and are given to certain persons as individual favours,&nbsp;they become a prolific source of abuse, and are quite indefensible&nbsp;from the standpoint of political economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While the superficial appearance of the railway tariff is different for different countries, and sometimes for different&nbsp;parts of the same country, the general principles laid down&nbsp;are followed in rate-making by all well-managed lines, whether&nbsp;state or private. It is a mistake to suppose that the question&nbsp;of public or private ownership will make any considerable&nbsp;difference in the system of rate-making adopted by a good&nbsp;railway. A state system will be compelled, by the exigencies</span></p>
