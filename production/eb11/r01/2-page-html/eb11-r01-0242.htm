<p><span class="font3">REFRIGERATING and ICE-MAKING. “ Refrigeration ” (from Lat. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">frigus,</span><span class="font3"> frost) is the cooling of a body by the transfer&nbsp;of a portion of its heat to another and therefore a cooler body.&nbsp;For ordinary temperatures it is performed directly with water&nbsp;as the cooling agent, especially when well water, which usually&nbsp;has a temperature of from 52° to 55° F., can be obtained. There&nbsp;are, however, an increasingly large number of cases in which&nbsp;temperatures below that of any available natural cooling agent&nbsp;are required, and in these it is necessary to resort to machines&nbsp;which are capable of producing the required cooling effect by&nbsp;taking in heat at low temperatures and rejecting it at temperatures&nbsp; somewhat above that of the natural cooling agent, which&nbsp;for obvious reasons is generally water. The function of a&nbsp;refrigerating machine, therefore, is to take in heat at a low&nbsp;temperature and reject it at a higher one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This involves the expenditure of a quantity of work W, the amount in any particular case being found by the equation&nbsp;W = Q</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sub>2</sub></span><span class="font2"> —Q<sub>1</sub>, where W is the work, expressed by its equivalent in British&nbsp;thermal units; Q<sub>2</sub> the quantity of heat, also in B.Ther.U., given&nbsp;out at the higher temperature T<sub>2</sub>; and Q<sub>1</sub> the heat taken in at&nbsp;the lower temperature T<sub>1</sub>. It is evident that the discharged heat&nbsp;Q<sub>2</sub> is equal to the abstracted heat Q<sub>1</sub>, plus the work expended,&nbsp;seeing that the work W, which causes the rise in temperature from&nbsp;T<sub>1</sub> to T<sub>2</sub>, is the thermal equivalent of the energy actually expended&nbsp;in raising the temperature to the level at which it is rejected. The&nbsp;relation then between the work expended and the actual cooling&nbsp;work performed denotes the efficiency of the process, and this is&nbsp;expressed by Q<sub>1</sub>/(Q<sub>2</sub>—Q<sub>1</sub>); but as in a perfect refrigerating machine&nbsp;it is understood that the whole of the heat Q<sub>1</sub> is taken in at the&nbsp;absolute temperature T<sub>1</sub>, and the whole of the heat Q<sub>2</sub>, is rejected&nbsp;at the absolute temperature T<sub>2</sub>, the heat quantities are proportional&nbsp;to the temperatures, and the expression T<sub>1</sub>/(T<sub>2</sub>—T<sub>1</sub>) gives the&nbsp;ideal coefficient of performance for any stated temperature range,&nbsp;whatever working substance is used. These coefficients for a number&nbsp;of cases met with in practice are given in the following table. They</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">show that in all cases the heat abstracted exceeds by many times the heat expended. As an instance, when heat is taken in at o°&nbsp;and rejected at 70°, a perfect refrigerating machine would abstract&nbsp;6·6 times as much heat as the equivalent of the energy to be applied.&nbsp;If, however, the heat is to be rejected at 100°, then the coefficient&nbsp;is reduced to 4·6.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By examining Table </span><span class="font3">1. </span><span class="font2">it will be seen how important it is to reduce the temperature range as much as possible, in order to obtain&nbsp;the most economical results. No actual refrigerating machine&nbsp;does, in fact, take in heat at the exact temperature of the body&nbsp;to be cooled, and reject it at the exact temperature of the cooling&nbsp;water, but, for economy in working, it is of great importance that&nbsp;the differences should be as small as possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">There are two distinct classes of machines used for refrigerating  and ice-making. In the first refrigeration is produced by&nbsp;the expansion of atmospheric air, and in the second by the&nbsp;evaporation of a more or less volatile liquid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Compressed-air Machines.</span><span class="font3">—A compressed-air refrigerating machine consists in its simplest form of three essential parts&nbsp;—a compressor, a compressed-air cooler, and an expansion&nbsp;cylinder. It is shown diagrammatically in fig. 1 in connexion&nbsp;with a chamber which it is keeping cool. The compressor&nbsp;draws in air from the room and compresses it, the work expended&nbsp;in compression being almost entirely converted into heat. The&nbsp;compressed air, leaving the compressor at the temperature T<sub>2</sub>,&nbsp;passes through the cooler, where it is cooled by means of water,&nbsp;and is then admitted to the expansion cylinder, where it is&nbsp;expanded to atmospheric pressure, performing work on the&nbsp;piston. The heat equivalent of the mechanical work performed on the piston is abstracted from the air, which is discharged at the temperature T<sub>1</sub>. This temperature T<sub>1</sub> is necessarily very much below the temperature to be maintained in&nbsp;the room, because the cooling effect is produced by transferring&nbsp;heat from the room or its contents to the air, which is thereby&nbsp;heated. The rise in temperature of the air is, in fact, the measure&nbsp;of the cooling effect produced. If such a machine could be&nbsp;constructed with reasonable mechanical efficiency to compress&nbsp;the air to a temperature but slightly above that of the cooling&nbsp;water, and to expand the air to a temperature but slightly&nbsp;below that required to be maintained in the room, we should of&nbsp;course get a result approximating in efficiency somewhat nearly&nbsp;to the figures given in Table I. Unfortunately, however, such&nbsp;results cannot be obtained in practice, because the extreme&nbsp;lightness of the air and its very small, heat capacity (which at&nbsp;constant pressure is ·2379) would necessitate the employment&nbsp;of a great volume, with extremely large and mechanically inefficient cylinders and apparatus. A pound of air, representing about 12 cub. ft., if raised 10° F. will only take up about&nbsp;2·4 B.T.U. Consequently, to make such a machine mechanically&nbsp; successful a comparatively small weight of air must be&nbsp;used, and the temperature difference increased; in other&nbsp;words, the air must be discharged at a temperature very much&nbsp;below that to be maintained in the room.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This theory of working is founded on the Carnot cycle for </span><span class="font3">a </span><span class="font2">perfect heat motor, a perfect refrigerating machine being simply&nbsp;a reversed heat motor. Another theory’ involves the use of the&nbsp;Stirling regenerator, which was proposed in connexion with the&nbsp;Stirling heat engine (see Air Engines). The air machine invented&nbsp;by Dr. A. Kirk in 1862, and described by him in a paper on the&nbsp;“ Mechanical Production of Cold ” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Proc. Inst.</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C.E.</span><span class="font2">, xxxvii.,&nbsp;1874, 244), is simply a reversed Stirling air engine, the air working&nbsp;in a closed cycle instead of being actually discharged into the room&nbsp;to be cooled, as is the usual practice with ordinary compressed-air machines. Kirk's machine was used commercially with success&nbsp;on </span><span class="font3">a </span><span class="font2">fairly large scale, chiefly for ice-making, and it is recorded that&nbsp;it produced about 4 ℔ of ice for 1</span><span class="font1"> ℔</span><span class="font2"> of coal. In 1868 J. Davy&nbsp;Postle read a paper before the Royal Society of Victoria, suggesting&nbsp;the conveyance of meat on board ship in a frozen state by means&nbsp;of refrigerated air, and in 1869 he showed by experiment how it&nbsp;could be done; but his apparatus was not commercially developed.&nbsp;In 1877 a compressed-air machine was designed by J. J. Coleman&nbsp;of Glasgow, and in the early part of 1879 one of his machines was&nbsp;fitted on board the Anchor liner “ Circassia,” which successfully&nbsp;brought a cargo of chilled beef from America—the first imported&nbsp;by the aid of refrigerating machinery, ice. having been previously&nbsp;used. The first successful cargo of frozen mutton from Australia&nbsp;was also brought by a Bell-Coleman machine in 1879. In the&nbsp;Bell-Coleman machine the air was cooled during compression by&nbsp;means of an injection of water, and further by being brought into&nbsp;contact with a shower of water. Another, perhaps the principal·,&nbsp;feature was the interchanger, an apparatus whereby the compressed&nbsp;air was further cooled before expansion by means of the comparatively&nbsp; cold air from the room in its passage to the compressor,&nbsp;the same air being used over and over again. The object of this&nbsp;interchanger was not only to cool the compressed air before&nbsp;expansion, but to condense part of the moisture in it, so reducing&nbsp;the quantity of ice or snow produced during expansion. A full&nbsp;description of the machine may be found in a paper on “ Air-Refrigerating Machinery ” by J. J. Coleman </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Proc. Inst. C.E.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">lxviii., 1882). At the present time the Bell-Coleman machine&nbsp;has practicaíly ceased to exist. In such compressed-air machines</span></p>
