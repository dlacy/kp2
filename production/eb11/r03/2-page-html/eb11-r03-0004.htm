<p><span class="font0">RICH, CLAUDIUS JAMES (1787-1821), English traveller and scholar, was born near Dijon on the 28th of March 1787.&nbsp;His youth was spent at Bristol. He early developed a gift for&nbsp;languages, becoming familiar not only with Latin and Greek&nbsp;but also with Hebrew, Syriac, Persian, Turkish and other&nbsp;Eastern tongues. In 1804 Rich went to Constantinople, where,&nbsp;and at Smyrna, he stayed some time, perfecting himself in&nbsp;Turkish. Proceeding to Alexandria as assistant to the British&nbsp;consul-general there, he devoted himself to Arabic and its&nbsp;various dialects, and made himself master of Eastern manners&nbsp;and usages. On leaving Egypt he travelled by land to the&nbsp;Persian Gulf, disguised as a Mameluke, visiting Damascus, and&nbsp;entering the great mosque undetected. At Bombay, which he&nbsp;reached in September 1807, he was the guest of Sir James&nbsp;Mackintosh, whose eldest daughter he married in January&nbsp;1808, proceeding soon after to Bagdad as resident. There he&nbsp;began his investigations into the geography, history and antiquities of the district. He explored the remains of Babylon,&nbsp;and projected a geographical and statistical account of the&nbsp;pashalic of Bagdad. The results of his work at Babylon&nbsp;appeared first in the Vienna serial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mines de Varient,</span><span class="font0"> and in 1815&nbsp;in England, under the title </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Narrative of a Journey to the Site&nbsp;of Babylon in 1811.</span><span class="font0"> In 1813-14 Rich spent some time in Europe,&nbsp;and on his return to Bagdad devoted himself to the study of&nbsp;the geography of Asia Minor, and collected much information&nbsp;in Syrian and Chaldaean convents concerning the Yezidis.&nbsp;During this period he made a second excursion to Babylon, and&nbsp;in 1820 undertook an extensive tour to Kurdistan—from Bagdad&nbsp;north to Sulimania, eastward to Sinna, then west to Nineveh,&nbsp;and thence down the Tigris to Bagdad. The narrative of this&nbsp;journey, which contained the first accurate knowledge (from&nbsp;scientific observation) regarding the topography and geography of&nbsp;the region, was published by his widow under the title, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Narrative&nbsp;of a Residence in Koordistan and on the site of Ancient Nineveh,&nbsp;&amp;c.</span><span class="font0"> (London, 1836). In 1821 Rich went to Basora, whence he&nbsp;made an excursion to Shiraz, visiting the ruins of Persepolis&nbsp;and the other remains in the neighbourhood. At Shiraz he&nbsp;died of cholera on the 5th of October 1821. His fine collections of manuscripts and coins was purchased by the British&nbsp;Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICH, JOHN (1692-1763<sup>4</sup>), English actor, the “father of English pantomime,” was the son of Christopher Rich (d. 1714),&nbsp;the manager of Drury Lane, with whose quarrels and tyrannies&nbsp;Colley Cibber’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apology</span><span class="font0"> is much occupied. John Rich opened&nbsp;the new theatre in Lincoln’s Inn Fields left unfinished by his&nbsp;father, and here, in 1716, under the stage name of Lun, he first&nbsp;appeared as Harlequin in an unnamed entertainment which&nbsp;developed into an annual pantomine </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{q.v.}.</span><span class="font0"> By this departure&nbsp;he made successful headway in his competition with the stronger&nbsp;company at Drury Lane, including Cibber, Wilks and Booth.&nbsp;Rich was less happy in his management of Covent Garden,&nbsp;which he opened in 1733, until Garrick’s arrival.(1746), when&nbsp;a most prosperous season ensued, followed by a bad one when&nbsp;Garrick went to Dury Lane. During Rich’s management&nbsp;occurred the rival performances of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romeo and Juliet—</span><span class="font0">Barry&nbsp;and Mrs Cibber at Covent Garden, and Garrick and Miss Bellamy&nbsp;at Dury Lane—and the subsequent competition between the&nbsp;two rival actors in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">King Lear.</span><span class="font0"> Rich died on the 26th of November 1761. Garrick’s lines show that his acting was pantomime pure and simple, without words:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ When Lun appeared, with matchless art and whim,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He gave the power of speech to every limb :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tho’ masked and mute, conveyed his quick intent,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And told in frolic gesture what he meant.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICH, PENELOPE, Lady (c. 1562-1607), the Stella of Sir Philip Sidney’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Astrophel and Stella,</span><span class="font0"> was the daughter of Walter&nbsp;Devereux, ist Earl of Essex. She was a child of fourteen when&nbsp;Sir Philip Sidney accompanied the queen on a visit to Lady&nbsp;Essex in 1576, on her way from Kenilworth, and must have been&nbsp;frequently thrown into the society of Sidney, in consequence&nbsp;of the many ties between the two families. Essex died at&nbsp;Dublin in September 1576. He had sent a message to Philip</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sidney from his death-bed expressing his desire that he should marry his daughter, and later his secretary wrote to the young&nbsp;man’s father, Sir Henry Sidney, in words which seem to point&nbsp;to the existence of a very definite understanding. Penelope’s&nbsp;great-grandmother was a sister of Anne Boleyn, and she and&nbsp;her brother Robert were therefore distantly connected with*&nbsp;Elizabeth. Perhaps the marriage of Lady Essex with the earl&nbsp;of Leicester, which destroyed Sidney's prospects as his uncle’s&nbsp;heir, had something to do with the breaking off of the proposed&nbsp;match with Penelope. Her relative and guardian, Henry&nbsp;Hastings, earl of Huntingdon, secured Burghley’s assent in&nbsp;March 1581 for her marriage with Robert Rich, 3rd Baron Rich.&nbsp;Penelope is said to have protested in vain against the alliance&nbsp;with Rich, who is represented as a rough and overbearing&nbsp;husband. The evidence against him is, however, chiefly derived&nbsp;from sources as interested as Sir Philip Sidney’s violent denunciation in the twenty-fourth sonnet of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Astrophel and Stella, “</span><span class="font0"> Rich&nbsp;fooles there be whose base and filthy hart.” Sidney's serious&nbsp;love for Penelope appears to date from her marriage with Rich.&nbsp;The earlier sonnets are in praise of her beauty, or treat of the&nbsp;conventional topic of the struggle between reason and love,&nbsp;while the later ones are marked by unmistakable passion. The&nbsp;eighth song of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Astrophel and Stella</span><span class="font0"> narrates Stella’s refusal to&nbsp;accept Sidney as a lover. Lady Rich was the mother of six&nbsp;children by her husband when she contracted in 1595 an open&nbsp;liaison with Charles Blount, 8th Lord Mountjoy, a brilliant&nbsp;courtier and favourite of Elizabeth, to whom she had long been&nbsp;attached. Rich took no steps against his wife during her&nbsp;brother’s lifetime, and she nursed him through an illness in&nbsp;1600, but they obtained a legal separation in 1601, and Mountjoy&nbsp;acknowledged her five children born after 1595. Mountjoy&nbsp;was created earl of Devonshire on the accession of James I., and&nbsp;Lady Rich was in high favour at court. In 1605, however,&nbsp;they legitimized their connexion by a marriage celebrated by&nbsp;William Laud, the earl’s chaplain. This proceeding, carried&nbsp;out in defiance of canon law, was followed by the disgrace of&nbsp;both parties, who were banished from court. Devonshire died&nbsp;on the 3rd of April 1606, and his wife within a year of ’that&nbsp;date. Her eldest son by Lord Rich, who became earl of Warwick&nbsp;in 1618, was Robert Rich, 2nd earl of Warwick (1587-1658). The&nbsp;second, Henry Rich, earl of Holland, was beheaded in 1649&nbsp;for his share in the second Civil War. Her eldest son by&nbsp;Mountjoy,Mountjoy Blount, Baron Mountjoy and earl of Newport&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{c.</span><span class="font0"> 1597-1665) also figured in the Civil War.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RICH, RICHARD (fl. 1610), English soldier and adventurer, the author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Newes from Virginia,</span><span class="font0"> sailed from England on&nbsp;the 2nd of June 1609 for Virginia, with Captain Christopher&nbsp;Newport and the three commissioners entrusted with the&nbsp;foundation of the new colony. In his verse pamphlet he&nbsp;relates the adventures undergone by the expedition, and&nbsp;describes the resources of the new country, with the advantages&nbsp;offered to colonists. The title runs: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nesves from Virginia.&nbsp;The lost Plocke Triumphant. With the happy Arrivall of that&nbsp;famous and worthy Knight Sr. Thomas Gates; and the well-reputed and valiant Captaine Mr Christopher Newport, and&nbsp;others, into England.
