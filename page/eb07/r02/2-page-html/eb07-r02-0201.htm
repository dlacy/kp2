<p><span class="font0">make with the horizon ; and they are also as the thrusts of those rafters to which they are parallel. Therefore, the&nbsp;thrust which any rafter makes in its own direction is as the&nbsp;secant of its elevation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The horizontal thrust is the same at all the angles. For </span><span class="font1">if = ftx = </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">my = nt = psr.</span><span class="font0"> Therefore both walls are, equally&nbsp;pressed out by the weight of the roof. We can find its&nbsp;quantity by comparing it with the load on one of the joints.&nbsp;Thus, QC : CB = sin. ABC : sin. ABft</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">BC : BT = rad. : sin. BCT = rad. ; sin. CB6. Therefore, QC : BT = rad. × sin. ABC : sin. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0">BA × sin.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0">BC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It deserves remark, that the lengths of the beams do not affect either the proportion of the load at the different&nbsp;joints, or the position of the rafters. This depends merely&nbsp;on the weights at the angles. If a change of length affects&nbsp;the weight, it indeed affects the form also ; and this is&nbsp;generally the case. For it seldom happens, indeed it never&nbsp;should happen, that the weight on rafters of longer bearing&nbsp;is not greater. The covering alone increases nearly in the&nbsp;proportion of the length of the rafter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the proportion of the weights at B, C, and D is given, as also the position of any two of the lines, the position of&nbsp;all the rest is determined. If the horizontal distances between the angles are all equal, the forces on the different&nbsp;angles are proportional to the verticals drawn on the lines&nbsp;through these angles from the adjoining angle, and the&nbsp;thrusts from the adjoining angles are as the lines which connect them. If the rafters themselves are of equal lengths,&nbsp;the weights at the different angles are as these verticals and&nbsp;as the secants of the angles of elevation of the rafters jointly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This proposition is very fruitful in its practical consequences. It is easy to perceive that it contains the whole theory of the construction of arches ; for each stone of an&nbsp;arch may be considered as one of the rafters of this piece&nbsp;of carpentry, since all is kept up by its mere equilibrium.&nbsp;We may have an opportunity in a future article of exhibiting some very elegant and simple solutions of the most&nbsp;difficult cases of this important problem ; and we now proceed to make use of the knowledge we have acquired for&nbsp;the construction of roofs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We mentioned by the by a problem which is not unfrequent in practice, to determine the best form of a kirb-roof. M. Couplet of the Royal Academy of Paris has given a solution of it in an elaborate memoir in 1726, occupying&nbsp;several lemmas and theorems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let AE (fig. 11) be the width, and CF the height; it</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">is required to construct a roof ABCDE, whose rafters AB, BC, CD, DE, are all equal, and which shall be in equilibrio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Draw CE, and bisect it perpendicularly in H by the line DHG, cutting the horizontal line AE in G. About the&nbsp;centre G, with the distance GE, describe the circle EKC.&nbsp;It must pass through C, because CH is equal to HE and&nbsp;the angles at H are equal. Draw HK parallel to FE, cutting the circumference in K ; draw CK, cutting GH in D ;&nbsp;and join CD, ED. These lines are the rafters of half of the&nbsp;roof required.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We prove this by showing that the loads at the angles C and D are equal ; for this is the proportion which results&nbsp;from the equality of the rafters, and the extent of surface&nbsp;of the uniform roofing which they are supposed to support.&nbsp;Therefore produce ED till it meet the vertical FC in N ;&nbsp;and having made the side CBA similar to CDE, complete&nbsp;the parallelogram BCDP, and draw DB, which will bisect&nbsp;CP in R, as the horizontal line KH bisects CF in Q. Draw&nbsp;KF, which is evidently parallel to DP. Make CS perpendicular to CF, and equal to FG ; and about S, with the radius SF, describe the circle FKW. It must pass through&nbsp;K, because SF is equal to CG, and CQ = QF. Draw&nbsp;WK, WS, and produce BC, cutting ND in O.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The angle WKF at the circumference is one half of the angle WSF at the centre, and is therefore equal to WSC&nbsp;or CGF. It is therefore double of the angle CEF or ECS.&nbsp;But ECS is equal to ECD and DCS, and ECD is one half&nbsp;of NDC, and DCS is one half of DCO or CDP. Therefore the angle WKF is equal to NDP, and WK is parallel&nbsp;to ND, and CF is to CW as CP to CN ; and CN is equal&nbsp;to CP. But it has been shown above that CN and CP are&nbsp;as the loads upon D and C. These are therefore equal, and&nbsp;the frame ABCDE is in equilibrio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A comparison of this solution with that of M. Couplet will show its great advantage in respect of simplicity and&nbsp;perspicuity ; and the intelligent reader can easily adapt&nbsp;the construction to any proportion between the rafters AB&nbsp;and BC, which other circumstances, such as garret-rooms,&nbsp;&amp;c. may render convenient. The construction must be</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">pr) i ∏F</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">such that NC may be to CP as CD to---. What</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ever proportion of AB to BC is assumed, the point D' will be found in the circumference of a semicircle fl'D'Λ', whose&nbsp;centre is in the line CE, and having AB : BC = CH' : ΗΈ&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">= ch'</span><span class="font0"> : Λ<sup>,</sup>E. The rest of the construction is simple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In buildings which are roofed with slate, tile, or shingles, the circumstance which is most likely to limit the construction is the slope of the upper rafters CB, CD. This must&nbsp;be sufficient to prevent the penetration of rain, and the&nbsp;stripping by the winds. The only circumstance left in our&nbsp;choice in this case is the proportion of the rafters AB and&nbsp;BC. Nothing is easier than making NC to CP in any desired proportion when the angle BCD is given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We need not repeat that it is always a desirable thing to form a truss for a roof in such a manner that it shall be in&nbsp;equilibrio. When this is done, the whole force of the struts&nbsp;and braces which are added to it is employed in preserving&nbsp;this form, and no part is expended in unnecessary strains.&nbsp;For we must now observe, that the equilibrium of which we&nbsp;have been treating is always of that kind which we call the&nbsp;tottering, and the roof requires stays, braces, or hanging&nbsp;timbers, to give it stiffness, or keep it in shape. We have&nbsp;also said enough to enable any reader acquainted with the&nbsp;most elementary geometry and mechanics, to compute the&nbsp;transverse strains and the thrusts to which the component&nbsp;parts of all roofs are exposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It only remains now to show the general maxims by which all roofs must be constructed, and thc circumstances&nbsp;which determine their excellence. In doing this we shall&nbsp;be exceedingly brief, and almost content ourselves with ex-</span></p>
