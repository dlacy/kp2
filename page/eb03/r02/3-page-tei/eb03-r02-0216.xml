Upon Lætus entering his apartment, Pertinax, without any ſhow of fear, cried out, That for many days he had expected to end his liſe in that manner, wondering that the emperor had deferred it ſo long. However, he was not a little ſurpriſed when informed of the real cauſe oſ their viſit ; and being ſtrongly urged to accept of the empire, he at laſt complied with their offer.</p><p>Being carried to the camp, Pertinax was proclaimed emperor : ſoon after the citizens and ſenate conſented ; the joy for the election of a new ſovereign being ſcarce equal to that for the death of the former. The provinces quickly followed the example of Rome ; ſo that he began his reign with univerſal ſatisſaction to the whole empire, in the 68th year of his age.</p><p>Nothing could exceed the wiſdom and juſtice of this monarch’s reign the ſhort time it continued. He puniſhed all thoſe who had ſerved to corrupt the late emperor, and diſpoſed of his ill-got poſſeſſions to public uſes. He attempted to reſtrain the licentiouſneſs of the prætorian bands, and put a ſtop to the injuries and inſolences they committed againſt the people. He ſold moſt of the buffoons and jeſters of Commodus as ſlaves; particularly ſuch as had obſcene names. He continually frequented the ſenate as often as it ſat, and never refuſed an audience even to the meaneſt of the people. His ſucceſs in foreign affairs was equal to his internal policy. When the barbarous nations abroad had certain intelligence that he was emperor, they immediately laid down their arms, well knowing the oppoſition they were to expect from ſo experienced a commander. His great error was avarice ; and that, in ſome meaſure, ſerved to haften his ruin.</p><p>The prætorian ſoldiers, whoſe manners he had attempted to reform, having been long corrupted by the indulgence and profuſion of their former monarchs, began to hate him for the parſimony and diſcipline he had introduced among them. They therefore reſolved to dethrone him ; and for that purpoſe declared Maternus, an ancient ſenator, emperor, and endeavoured to carry him to the camp to proclaim him. Maternus, however, was too juſt to the merits of Pertinax, and too faithful a ſubject, to concur in their ſeditious designs ; wherefore eſcaping out of their hands, he fled, firſt to the emperor, and then out of the city. They then nominated one Falco, another ſenator ; whom the ſenate would have ordered for execution, had not Pertinax interpoſed, who declared that daring his reign no ſenator ſhould ſuffer death.</p><p>'1 he prætorian ſoldiers then reſolved unanimouſly not to uſe any ſecret conſpiracies, or private contrivances, but boldly to ſeize upon the emperor and empire at once. They accordingly, in a tumultuous manner, marched through the ſtreets of Rome, and entered the palace without oppoſition. Such was the terror at their approach, that the greateſt part of the emperor ’s attendants forſook hiift <hi rend="italic">j</hi>  while theſe who remaiaed earnçit-</p><lb/><p>ly intreated him to fly to the body of the people, and intereſt them in his defence. However, he rejected their advice ; declaring, that it was unworthy his imperial dignity, and all his paſt actions, to ſave himſelf by flight. Having thus reſolved to face the rebels, he had ſome hopes that his preſence alone would terrify and confound them. But what could his former virtues, or the dignity of command, avail againſt a tumultuous rabble, nurſed up in vice, and miniſters of former tyranny ? One Thauſius, a Tuagrian, ſtruck him with his lance on the breaſt, crying out, “ The ſoldiers ſend you this.” Pertinax finding all was over, covered his head with his robe, and ſunk down, mangled with a multitude of wounds, which he received from various aſſaſſins. Eclectus, and ſome more of his attendants, who attempted to defend him, were alſo ſlain : his ſon and daughter only eſcaped, who happened to be lodged out of the palace. Thus, after a reign of three mouths, Pertinax ſell a ſacriſice to the licentious ſury of the prætorian army. From the number of his adventures, he was called the <hi rend="italic">tennis-ball of Fortune ;</hi>  and certainly no man ever experienced ſuch a variety of ſituations with ſo blameleſs a character.</p><p>The ſoldiers having committed this outrage, retired with great precipitation ; and getting out of the city to the reſt of their companions, expeditiouſly fortified their camp, expecting to be attacked by the citizens. Two days having paſſed without any attempt of this kind, they became more inſolent ; and willing to make uſe of the power of which they found themſelves poſſeſſed, made proclamation, that they would ſell the empire to whoever would purchaſe it at the higheſt price, In conſequence of this proclamation, ſo odious and unjuſt, only two bidders were found ; namely, Sulpicia-nus and Didius Julianus: The former, a conſular perſon, prefect of the city, and ſon-in-law to the late emperor Pertinax ; the latter, a Conſular perſon likewile<hi rend="sub">s </hi>a great lawyer, and the wealthieſt man in the city. He was ſitting with ſome ſriends at dinner when the proclamation was publiſhed ; and being charmed with the proſpect of unbounded power, immediately roſe ſrom tahle and haſtened to the camp. Sulpicianus was got there before him ; but as he had rather promiſes than treafore to beſtow, the offers of Didius, who produced immenſe ſums of ready money, prevailed» He was received into the camp by a ladder, and they inſtantly ſwore to obey him as emperor. From the camp he was attended by his new electors into the city ; tire whole body of his guards, which conſiſted of 10,000 men, ranged around him in ſuch order as if they had prepared for battle, and not for a peaceful ceremony. The citizens, however, refuſed to confirm his election ; but rather curſed him as he paſſed. Up-» on being conducted to the ſenate-houſe, he addreſſed the few ſenators that were preſent in a very laconic ſpeech : “ Fathers, you want an emperor ; and I am the ſitteft perſon you can chooſe.” But even this, ihort as it ſeems, was unneceſſary, ſince the ſenate had it not in their power to refuſe their approbation. His ſpeech being backed by the army, to whom lie had given, about a million of our money, ſucceeded. The choice of the ſoldiers was confirmed by the ſenate, and Didius wag acknowledged emperor, now in the 57 th year of his. age.</p><p>it ſhould ſeem by this weak monarch’s conduct when</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
