<p><span class="font2">In passing to the religion of the state we are clearly entering on a later period and a more developed form of society. The&nbsp;loose aggregation of agricultural households gives place&nbsp;to the organized community with new needs and new&nbsp;ideals, and at the same time in religious thought the&nbsp;old vague notion of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">numen</span><span class="font2"> is almost universally superseded&nbsp;by the more definite conception of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dens—</span><span class="font2">not even now&nbsp;quite anthropomorphic, but with a much more clearly realized&nbsp;personality. We find then two prominent notes of the state&nbsp;influence, firstly, the adaptation of the old ideas of the household and agricultural cults to the broader needs of the community, especially to the new necessities of internal justice&nbsp;between citizens and war against external enemies, and secondly&nbsp;the organization of more or less casual worship into something&nbsp;like a consistent system. Adaptation proceeds at first naturally&nbsp;enough on the lines of analogy. As Janus is in the household&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">numen</span><span class="font2"> of the door, so in the state he is the god associated&nbsp;with the great gate near the corner of the forum: the Penates&nbsp;have their analogy in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Di Penates populi Romani Quiritium&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">by whom the magistrates take their oath on entering office,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lar familiaris</span><span class="font2"> in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lares Praestites</span><span class="font2"> of the community,&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Genius</span><span class="font2"> in the new notion of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Genius populi Romani&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Genius urbis Romae.</span><span class="font2"> But the closest and most curious&nbsp;analogy is seen in the case of Vesta. The Vesta of the state&nbsp;is in fact the king’s hearth, standing in close proximity to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Regia,</span><span class="font2"> the king’s palace; the Vestal Virgins, who have charge&nbsp;of the sacred fire, are the “ king’s daughters,” and as such even&nbsp;in republican times were in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font2"> of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pontifex maximus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">who was the successor of the king on the legal side of his religious&nbsp;duties, as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rex sacrorum</span><span class="font2"> was on the sacrificial side. But&nbsp;adaptation meant also reflection and the widening of old conceptions under the influence of thought and even of abstract&nbsp;ideas. Thus, the simple reflection that the door is used for</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the double purpose of entrance and exit leads to the notion of the Janus of the state as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bifrons</span><span class="font2"> (“ two-faced ”): the thought&nbsp;of the&gt;door as the first part of the house to which one comes,&nbsp;produces the more abstract idea of Janus as the “ god of beginning,” in which character he has special charge of the first&nbsp;beginnings of human life </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Consevius)</span><span class="font2">, the first hour of the day,&nbsp;the Calends of the month and the first month of the year in&nbsp;the later calendar: for the same reason his n^me takes the first&nbsp;place in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">indigitamenta.</span><span class="font2"> But development proceeds also&nbsp;on broader and more important lines. Jupiter in the rustic-cult was a sky-god concerned mainly with the wine festivals&nbsp;and associated with the sacred oak on the Capitol. Now he&nbsp;develops a twofold character: as the receiver of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">spolia&nbsp;opima</span><span class="font2"> he becomes associated with war, especially in the double&nbsp;character of the stayer of rout </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Stator)</span><span class="font2"> and the giver of victory&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Victor),</span><span class="font2"> in which last capacity he later gives birth to an offshoot in the abstract conception of the goddess Victoria. As&nbsp;the sky-god again he is appealed to as the witness of oaths in&nbsp;the special capacity of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Dius Fidius,</span><span class="font2"> producing once more&nbsp;an abstract offshoot in the goddess Fides. In these two conceptions, justice and war, lie the germs of the later idea of&nbsp;Jupiter as the embodiment of the life of the Roman people both&nbsp;in their internal organization and in their external relations. In&nbsp;much the same manner Mars takes on in addition to his agricultural character the functions of war-god, which in time completely&nbsp;superseded the earlier idea. Finally, we must notice, as the sign&nbsp;of the synoecismus of the two settlements, the inclusion of the&nbsp;Colline deity, Quirinus, apparently the Mars of the originally&nbsp;rival community. In these three deities, Jupiter, Mars, Quirinus,&nbsp;we have the great triad of the earliest stage of the state religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Organization showed itself in the fixing of the annual calendar and the development of the character and functions of the&nbsp;priesthood, and as we should expect, in a new conception of the&nbsp;legal relation of the gods to the state. In the earlier stage—&nbsp;•whose notions of course still persist alongside of the state religion&nbsp;—each household has its own relations to its </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">numina:</span><span class="font2"> now the&nbsp;state approaches the gods through its duly appointed representatives, the magistrates and priests. Their presence is&nbsp;typical of that of the whole people, and the private citizen is&nbsp;required to do no more on festival days than a ceremonial abstinence from work. It is obvious that the state religion has a&nbsp;less direct connexion with morality and the religious sense than&nbsp;the worship of the household, but it has its ethical value in a&nbsp;sense of discipline and a consecration of the spirit of patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The later stages represent not the spontaneous development of the genuine Roman religion, but its alteration and super-session by new cults and ideas introduced from foreign&nbsp;sources. Authorities are generally agreed in recognizing three periods:—(i) from the end of the Regal&nbsp;epoch to the second Punic War, when Rome was influenced&nbsp;by other peoples in Italy, with whom she was brought into&nbsp;contact by commerce or war; (2) from the second Punic War&nbsp;to the end of the Republic, when contact with Greek and&nbsp;oriental sources and the growth of literature revolutionized&nbsp;religious notions and led to a philosophic scepticism; (3) the&nbsp;Imperial epoch, opening with a revival of old religious notions&nbsp;and later marked by the official worship of the deified emperors&nbsp;and the wide influence of oriental cults.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(1) By the end of the regal period Rome had ceased to bea mere&nbsp;agricultural community and had developed into a city-state. There&nbsp;had consequently grown up within the state a large artisan class,&nbsp;excluded from the old patrician </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font2"> and therefore from the state&nbsp;cult: at the same time the beginnings of commerce had opened&nbsp;relations with neighbouring peoples. The consequence was the&nbsp;introduction of certain new deities, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">di novensides,</span><span class="font2"> from external&nbsp;sources, and the birth of new conceptions of the gods and their&nbsp;worship. We may distinguish three main influences, to a certain&nbsp;extent historically successive, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font2"> Tradition always assigned to the&nbsp;last three kings of Rome a connexion with the mysterious people&nbsp;of Etruria, and their influence at this period though not very&nbsp;definite was certainly extensive. To them, possibly&nbsp;through the mediation of Falerii, a Latin town on the&nbsp;Etruscan border, was due the introduction of Minerva, who, as the&nbsp;goddess of handicraft and protectress of the artisan gilds, was&nbsp;established in a temple on the Aventine. Soon, however, she found&nbsp;her way on to the Capitol, and there a new Etruscan triad, Jupiter,&nbsp;Juno and Minerva, possibly going back from Etruria to Greece, was&nbsp;enshrined in a magnificent new temple built by Etruscan workmen&nbsp;and decorated in the Etruscan manner. In this temple the deities&nbsp;were represented by images, and on its dedication day, September&nbsp;13th, at the novel festival of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">epulum Jovis,</span><span class="font2"> the images were&nbsp;adorned and set out as partakers of the feast, a proceeding wholly&nbsp;foreign to the native Roman religion (see further </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Etruria,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">§ Religion).. (b)</span><span class="font2"> Secondly, in war and peace Rome formed relations&nbsp;with her neighbours of Latium, and, as a sign of the Latin league&nbsp;which resulted, the cult of Diana was brought from Aricia and&nbsp;established on the Aventine in the ** commune Latinorum&nbsp;Dianae tempium ” (Varro, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ling. Lat.</span><span class="font2"> v. 43): about the&nbsp;same time was built the temple of Jupiter Latiaris on the Alban&nbsp;mount, its resemblance in style to the new Capitoline temple pointing&nbsp;to Rome’s hegemony. So great was Rome’s sense of kinship to the&nbsp;Latins that in two cases Latin cults were introduced inside the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pomoeriunr.</span><span class="font2"> the worship of Hercules, which came from Tibur in&nbsp;connexion with commerce, was established at the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ara maxima</span><span class="font2"> in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">forum boarium,</span><span class="font2"> and the Tusculan cult of Castor as the patron of&nbsp;cavalry found a home close to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">forum Romanum</span><span class="font2">: it is a strange&nbsp;irony that both these deities should in reality have been in their&nbsp;origin Greek. Other Italian cults introduced at this period were those&nbsp;of Juno Sospes and Juno Regina, Venus and Fortuna Primigenia,&nbsp;a goddess of childbirth who came from Praeneste. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(c)</span><span class="font2"> Later on in&nbsp;the same period contact with the cities of Magna Graecia brought&nbsp;about the wide-reaching introduction of the Sibylline books.&nbsp;Whatever may be their origin—and they came from Cumae—they&nbsp;were placed in the Capitoline temple under the care of a&nbsp;special commission of two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(duovin sacris faciundis,</span><span class="font2"> later&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">decemviri</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">quindecimviri),</span><span class="font2"> and their “ oracles,” which&nbsp;were referred to in times of great national stress, recommended.the&nbsp;introduction of foreign cults. In 493 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C., </span><span class="font2">at a time of serious&nbsp;famine, they ordered the building of a temple to the Greek triad&nbsp;Demeter, Dionysus and Persephone, who were identified with the&nbsp;old Roman divinities Ceres, Liber and Libera: Apollo must&nbsp;have come with or before the books themselves, though his temple&nbsp;was not built till 433 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C.: </span><span class="font2">Mercury followed, the representative&nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’E/xiroXatos, Asclepius was brought from Epidaurus to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the Tiber island in 293 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> and Dis and Proserpina, with their strange chthonic associations and night ritual, probably from&nbsp;Tarentum in 249 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font2"> With new deities came new modes of worship:&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">graecus ritus,</span><span class="font2"> in which, contrary to Roman usage, the worshipper’s&nbsp;head was unveiled, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lectisternium</span><span class="font2"> (&lt;£.r.), an elaborate form of&nbsp;the “ banquet of the gods.” In this period, then, we find first a&nbsp;legitimate extension of cults corresponding to the needs of the&nbsp;growing community, and secondly a religious restlessness and a&nbsp;consequent tendency to more dramatic forms of worship.</span></p>
