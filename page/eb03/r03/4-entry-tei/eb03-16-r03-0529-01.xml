<p><label>ROUNDELAY</label>
or Roundo, a fort of ancient poer∩, derived its name, according to Menage, from its form, and becauſe it ſtill turns back again to the ſirll verſe, and thus goes round. The common roundelay conſiſts ol 13 verſes, eight of which are in one rhyme and five in another. It is divided into couplets ; at the end of the ſecond and third of which the beginning of the roundelay is repeated ; and that, if poſſible, in an equivocal or punning ſenſe. The roundelay is a popular poem in Fiance, but is little known among us. Ma-rot and Voiture have ſucceeded the beſt in it. Rapin remarks, that if the roundelay be not very exquiſite, it is intolerably bad In all the ancient ones, Menage ob-ſerves, that the verſe preceding has a leſs complete ſenſe, and yet joins agreeably with that oſ the cloſe, without depending neceſſarily thereon. This rule, well obſerved, makes the roundelay more ingenious, and is one of the ſineſſts of the poem. Some of the ancient wri ters ſpeak of the roundelay or roundel as a kind of air appropriated to dancing ; and in this ſenſe the term ſeems to indicate little more than dancing in a circle with the hands joined</p>
