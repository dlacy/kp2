        <p><span class="font2">level of the Miocene sea, which was very shallow to the N. of this
                last ridge, while farther S. it was connected both with the Vienna&nbsp;basin and
                with the Aral-Caspian. The Pliocene appears only in&nbsp;the coast region of the
                Black and Azov Seas, but it is widely&nbsp;developed in the Aral-Caspian region,
                where, however, the Ust-Urt&nbsp;and the Obshchiy Syrt rose above the
            sea.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The thick Quaternary, or Post-Pliocene, deposits which cover nearly
                all Russia were for a long time a puzzle to geologists. They&nbsp;consist of a
                boulder clay in the N. and of loess in the S. The&nbsp;former presents an intimate
                mixture of boulders brought from&nbsp;Finland and Olonets (with an addition of local
                boulders) with small&nbsp;gravel, coarse sand and the finest glacial mud,—the whole
                bearing&nbsp;no trace of ever having been washed up and sorted by water
                in&nbsp;motion, except in subordinate layers of glacial sand and gravel;&nbsp;the
                size of the boulders decreases on the whole from N. to S., and&nbsp;the boulder
                clay, especially in N. and central Russia, often takes&nbsp;the shape of ridges
                parallel to the direction of the motion of the&nbsp;boulders. Its S. limits, roughly
                corresponding with those established by Murchison, but not yet settled in the S.E.
                and E., are,&nbsp;according to M. Nikitin, the following:—from the S. frontier
                of&nbsp;Poland to Ovrutch, Uman, Kremenchug, Poltava and Razdornaya&nbsp;(5O°[N.
                latitude), with a curve N. to Kozelsk (?); thence due&nbsp;N. to Vetluga (¿8° N.
                latitude), E. to Glazova in Vyatka, and&nbsp;from this place towards the N. and W.
                along the watershed of&nbsp;the Volga and Pechora (?). S. of the 50th parallel
                appears the&nbsp;loess, with all its usual characters (land fossils, want 01
                stratification, &amp;c.), showing a remarkable uniformity of composition
                over&nbsp;very large surfaces; it covers both watersheds and valleys,
                but&nbsp;chiefly the former. Such being the characters of the
                Quaternary&nbsp;deposits in Russia, the majority of Russian geologists now
                adopt&nbsp;the opinion that Russia was covered, as far as the above
                limits,&nbsp;with an immense ice-sheet which crept over central Russia
                and&nbsp;central Germany from Scandinavia and N. Russia. Another ice covering was
                probably advancing at the same time from the N.E.,&nbsp;that is, from the N. of the
                Urals, but the question as to the glaciation of the Urals still remains open. As to
                the loess, the usual&nbsp;view is that it was a steppe-deposit due to the drifting
                of fine sand&nbsp;and dust during a dry episode in the Pleistocene
            period.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The deposits of the Post-Glacial period are represented throughout
                Russia, Poland and Finland, as also throughout Siberia and Central Asia, by very
                thick lacustrine deposits, which show that,&nbsp;after the melting of the ice-sheet,
                the country was covered with&nbsp;immense lakes, connected by broad channels (the
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fjarden</span><span
                class="font2"> of the&nbsp;Swedes), which later on gave rise to the actual, rivers.
                On the&nbsp;outskirts of the lacustrine region, traces of marine deposits,
                not&nbsp;higher than 200 or perhaps even 150 ft. above present sea-level,&nbsp;are
                found alike on the Arctic Sea. and on the Baltic and Black Sea&nbsp;coasts. A deep
                gulf of the Arctic Sea advanced up the valley of&nbsp;the Dvina; and the Caspian,
                connected by the Manych with the&nbsp;Black Sea, and by the Uzboy valley with Lake
                Aral, penetrated&nbsp;N. up the Volga valley, as far as its Samara bend.
                Unmistakable&nbsp;traces show that, while during the Glacial period Russia had
                an&nbsp;arctic flora and fauna, the climate of the Lacustrine period was&nbsp;more
                genial than it is now, and a dense human population at that&nbsp;time peopled the
                shores of the numberless lakes..</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The Lacustrine period has not yet reached its close in Russia.
                Finland and the N.W. hilly plateaus are still in the same geological&nbsp;phase,
                and.are dotted with numberless lakes and ponds, while the&nbsp;rivers continue to
                dig out their yet undetermined channels. But&nbsp;the. great lakes which covered,
                tne country during the Lacustrine&nbsp;period have disappeared, leaving behind them
                immense marshes&nbsp;like those of the rripet and in the N.E. The disappearance
                of&nbsp;what still remains of them is accelerated not only by the
                general&nbsp;decrease of. moisture, but also perhaps by the gradual upheaval&nbsp;of
                N. Russia, which is going on from Esthonia and Finland to the&nbsp;Kola peninsula
                and Novaya Zemlya, at an average rate of about&nbsp;two feet per century. This
                upheaval—the consequences of which&nbsp;have been felt even within the historic
                period, by the drainage&nbsp;of the formerly impracticable marshes of Novgorod and
                at the&nbsp;head </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">the Gulf
                of Finland—together with tne destruction of&nbsp;forests (which must be considered,
                however, as a quite subordinate&nbsp;cause), contributes towards a decrease of
                precipitation over Russia&nbsp;and towards increased shallowness of her rivers. At
                the same&nbsp;time, as the gradients, are gradually increasing on account of
                the&nbsp;upheaval of the continent, the rivers dig their channels deeper&nbsp;and
                deeper.. Consequently central and especially S. Russia .witness&nbsp;the. formation

                population of the empire, which was estimated at 74,000,000 in 1859, was found to be
                over 129,200,000&nbsp;at the census of 1897, taken over all the empire except
                Finland.&nbsp;In 1904 it was estimated to be 143,000,000, and in 1906, according to
                </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font3">detailed estimate of the
