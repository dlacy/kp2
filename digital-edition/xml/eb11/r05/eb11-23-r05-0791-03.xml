<p><label>ROYAL FERN</label>
in botany, the common name for the fern <hi rend="italic">Osmunda regalis,</hi> a native of Britain, where it grows in bogs, marshy woods, &amp;c. It is a handsome plant with bi-pinnate fronds 2 to 6 ft. long and 1 ft. or more broad; the tops of the fronds are fertile, the fertile pinnae being cylindrical and densely covered with the spore-cases, giving the appearance of a dense panicle of flowers, whence the plant is known as the flowering fern. There are various cultivated formsâ€” <hi rend="italic">cristata</hi> has the ends of the fronds and the pinnae finely crested, and <hi rend="italic">corymbifera</hi> has curiously forked and crested fronds. Several other species, such as <hi rend="italic">0. cinnamomea, O. Claytoniana,</hi> are known as handsome greenhouse ferns (see also Ferns).</p>
