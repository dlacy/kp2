<p><span class="font2">Plate CCCCXXIX. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font2"> the steam whistle which is made use of to warn workmen on the road, and persons on the stations, when the&nbsp;engine is approaching; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font2"> an elevated dome, Iipwhich the steam pipe&nbsp;rises to nearly the top, to prevent the motion of the engine throwing&nbsp;water out of the boiler. This dome, when taken off, forms the manhole ; c, working safety valve, the lever of which is attached to a&nbsp;spring weighing-machine ; &lt;/, lock-up safety valve, which is screwed&nbsp;down to the required pressure by a series of springs ; e, chimney ;&nbsp;this generally has a wire gauze at the top to prevent the escape of&nbsp;sparks, and sometimes a damper to regulate the force of the blast-pipe; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">f,</span><span class="font2"> smoke box, in which are the cylinders, the end of one of&nbsp;which is seen at 7, with the cock A, which is to let Outcondensed water&nbsp;or priming from the cylinder. There is a large door in the front of the&nbsp;engine, opening into the smoke-box, to allow of repairs being made to&nbsp;the cylinders, tubes, &amp;c. inside ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">t. i, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i,</span><span class="font2"> three guage cocks, to ascertain the height of the water in the boiler ; A, water guage, shewing&nbsp;in a glass tube the height of the water in the boiler. This guage&nbsp;communicates by a cock ut the top with the steam, and by one at&nbsp;the bottom with die water. It also has a second cock at the bottom, for the purpose of emptying it when necessary ; Z, steam regulator, by turning which, the steam is shut off, or let into the cylinders ;&nbsp;nt, railing round the place where the engine-man and fireman stand ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">n,</span><span class="font2"> fire box, containing the furnace, round which a thickness of about&nbsp;three inches of water circulates from the boiler ; the top is also full&nbsp;of water to the height of that in the boiler ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">0,</span><span class="font2"> supply pipe connected with the tender, from which water is pumped in at pleasure by&nbsp;means of the pumps p, which are worked by arms fixed on the piston rods, and running in guides ; 7, the handle which turns the pet&nbsp;cock; this is used by the engine-man to ascertain when his pumps&nbsp;are in proper order, in which case it throws out water, but when they&nbsp;are deranged it gives out steam ; there is one on each side of the&nbsp;engine ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r,</span><span class="font2"> cock by which the boiler is emptied, and the engine blown&nbsp;off. Plates also take off at the bottom of the boiler, and open into&nbsp;the mud-holes, which are also used to clean the engine internally ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s, s,</span><span class="font2"> strengthening rods to the frame-work of the engine ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t, (,</span><span class="font2"> stays&nbsp;from the framing to the boiler; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">u,</span><span class="font2"> draw-bar to which the tender is&nbsp;attached ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">v,</span><span class="font2"> door to the furnace ; there is a similar one to the lower&nbsp;part of the fire-box, which is formed into the ash pit, and is open to&nbsp;the front for the purpose of increasing the draft ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w,</span><span class="font2"> the frame-work&nbsp;of the engine. Some makers place this with its breadth horizontal&nbsp;instead of vertical, and Mr. Bury of Liverpool has his bearings inside the wheels instead of outside ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">x, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2"> the axle guards which play&nbsp;up and down in grooves in the sides of the axle-boxes ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">y,</span><span class="font2"> hook for attaching carriages to the foremost end of the engine ; there is a similar one on the other side ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">z,</span><span class="font2"> the buffer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The lower part of the boiler has a number of brass tubes running along its whole length, through which the flame and hot air rush in&nbsp;their passage to the chimney, up which the steam, after it has performed its office in the cylinders, is thrown through an iron pipe called&nbsp;the blast pipe. This is one of the most essential of all the improvements of the locomotive. The boiler is cased with wood, to preserve&nbsp;the heat as much as possible ; its tubes last about two years, and cost&nbsp;about L.l each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The steam pipe, by which the steam is conveyed to the cylinders, is divided into two after it enters the smoke-box, and one goes to&nbsp;each cylinder ; these are all made of copper, and the entrance and&nbsp;exit of the steam into the cylinder is regulated by slide valves worked&nbsp;by eccentrics on the cranked axle, which move levers fixed to the&nbsp;weigh bars. The pistons are formed of metal rings in several divisions,&nbsp;so placed as to break joint. The piston rod is fixed with a joint to&nbsp;the connecting rod ; and this last gives motion to the cranked axle,&nbsp;having its end next the piston rod fixed to the cross heads, each end&nbsp;of which work in guide blocks, thus causing a parallel motion in the&nbsp;piston rod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The cranks are placed at right angles to each other, to enable the engine to get over her centres ; one piston thus works at the greatest&nbsp;advantage, when the other is at the least. By the eccentrics on the&nbsp;crank axle, and a series of levers, the slide valves are continually&nbsp;worked backwards and forwards with the engine, and this motion can&nbsp;be reversed instantly, so as to cause the engine to go in the opposite&nbsp;direction when required ; this is done by means of the long handle&nbsp;near the fire box, which moves against an arc having three notches in&nbsp;it ; when the handle is placed in the upper or lower notch, the engine&nbsp;goes either forward or backward, and when in the middle, the slide&nbsp;valves no longer work. There are many modes by which this is arrived at by different makers, and there is generally two starting handles, by pulling which the slides can be worked by hand ; these are&nbsp;constantly in motion while the engine is going.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Proper cups containing oil are placed over each of the working parts, so as to ensure a steady and constant supply of oil to every&nbsp;moving portion of the engine. These cups have a tube inside them,&nbsp;which leads through to the part which is intended to be supplied with&nbsp;oil. and a cotton wick is put through the tube, one end of which&nbsp;hangs over the top into the oil cup, «and thus acts as a syphon. The&nbsp;axle boxes are filled with grease, and have a cover on the top to ensure a proper lubrication of the axles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Inside bearings are often used to strengthen the engine, and ensure its correct action ; they also steady the cranked axle against the horizontal force of the piston rods. The whistle is formed by a pipe&nbsp;through which the steam is allowed to pass at pleasure, by turning a&nbsp;cock; it then rushes against the thin edge of the upper domed part,&nbsp;which is hollow like a bell, and gives out a clear sound when the&nbsp;cock is properly turned, which may be heard at a very great distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The buffers consist of leather cushions stuffed with horse hair, and their use is to break the shock arising from any concussion which the&nbsp;engine may receive. Each of the wheels has a cover, called a splasher,&nbsp;I</span><span class="font1">∣</span><span class="font2">laced over them, to prevent their throwing the dirt from the rails into&nbsp;the machinery. Sometimes two pair of wheels are coupled together ;&nbsp;this gives more adhesion, and is generally done to goods’ engines only,&nbsp;which also have usually their wheels of less diameter than those used&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">for</span><span class="font2"> passenger trains, velocity being not so much an object as power of&nbsp;draught. JVIr. Stephenson does not now make his engines with any&nbsp;flanges on the middle pair of wheels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(n.
