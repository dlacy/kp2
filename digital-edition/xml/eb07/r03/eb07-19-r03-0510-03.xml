<p><label>ROWNING</label>
John, an English mathematician and philosopher of considerable ingenuity, was fellow of Magdalen College, Cambridge, and afterwards rector of Anderby in Lincolnshire, in the gift of that society. He constantly attended the meetings of the Spalding Society, and was a man of an extraordinary philosophical habit of mind, whilst at the same time his dispositions were social and cheerful. His genius was peculiarly fitted for mechanical contrivances or inventions. He published a compendious system of Natural Philosophy at Cambridge, in the year 1738, in two volumes 8vo; a work of much ingenuity, which has gone through several editions. He likewise inserted two pieces in the Philosophical Transactions, namely, a description of a barometer, wherein the scale of variation may be increased at pleasure (vol. xxxviii. p. 39); and directions for making a machine for finding the roots of equations universally, together with the manner in which it should be used (vol. lx. p. 240). He died at his lodgings in Carey Street, near Lincolnâ€™s-Inn Fields, in the end of November 1771, in the seventy-second year of his age. Though a man both ingenious and pleasant, his external appearance was rather forbidding, being tall, and low in the shoulders, with his countenance down-looking and sallow.</p>
