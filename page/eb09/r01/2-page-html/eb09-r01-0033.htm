<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAHWAY, a city of the United States in Union county, New Jersey, 19 miles by rail south-west of New York, lies&nbsp;on Rahway river at the head of schooner navigation, about&nbsp;4 miles above its mouth in Staten Island Sound. It is&nbsp;best known for its carriage-factories, but has also a wool-mill, a printing-press manufactory, a printing-house, a&nbsp;shirt-factory, a hunting-goods factory, etc. The population was 6258 in 1870 and 6455 in 1880. First settled&nbsp;in 1720 and named after Rahwack, the Indian owner of&nbsp;the site, Rahway was incorporated as a city in 1858.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAI BARELI or </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Roy Bareilly, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a district of British India, in the Rai Bareli division@@<sup>1</sup> of Oudh, under the&nbsp;jurisdiction of the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces, has an area of 1738 square miles.&nbsp;It lies between 25° 49' and 26° 35' N. lat. and between&nbsp;80° 45' and 81° 40' E. long., and is bounded on the N.&nbsp;by the districts of Lucknow and Bara Banki, on the E.&nbsp;by Sultanpur, on the S. by Partabgarh and the Ganges,&nbsp;and on the W. by Unao. The general aspect of the&nbsp;district is slightly undulating, and the country is beautifully wooded ; in fact, the beauty of the country is not to&nbsp;be surpassed by any part of the real plain of Hindustan.&nbsp;The soil is remarkably fertile, and the cultivation of a&nbsp;high class. The principal rivers of the district are the&nbsp;Ganges and the Sai: the former skirts it for 54 miles&nbsp;and is everywhere navigable for boats of 40 tons; the&nbsp;latter traverses it from north-west to south-east, a distance of 55 miles. Other rivers are the Basha, the Loni,&nbsp;and the Naiya. The indigenous products of Rai Bareli&nbsp;consist of several magnificent and useful timber trees,&nbsp;numerous kinds of grazing and thatching grasses, and a&nbsp;variety of rice known as “pasahi,” which grows wild in&nbsp;many tanks and marshes; its jungle products are lac and&nbsp;silk cocoons. Herds of wild cattle are to be found in&nbsp;the south of the district, near the Sai river, and do much&nbsp;harm to the crops; nylghau are common near the Ganges,&nbsp;and wolves are occasionally met with in the jungles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">According to the census of 1881 Rai Bareli district contains a population of 951,905 (males 466,906, females 484,999). By&nbsp;religion 874,180 are Hindus, 77,424 Mohammedans, and 123&nbsp;Christians. The most numerous castes are the Ahirs (114,869), the&nbsp;Brahmans(113,212), and the Rajputs (70,757). Compared with other&nbsp;Oudh districts, the proportion of high castes is large, which is&nbsp;accounted for by the fact that Rai Bareli was for centuries the seat&nbsp;of Hindu authority and hut little controlled by the Mohammedan&nbsp;kings. The population is almost entirely rural, there being only&nbsp;three towns with a population exceeding 5000, viz., Rai Bareli (see&nbsp;below), Jais (11,044), and Dalmau (5367). The principal occupation of the people is agriculture. Of the total area 892 square&nbsp;miles were in 1882 returned as cultivated, 432 as cultivable, and&nbsp;414 square miles as uncultivable. The greater portion of the&nbsp;cultivated area is two-crop land. The principal crops are rice,&nbsp;wheat, gram, arhar, and pease. In years of scarcity Rai Bareli&nbsp;is worse off than other districts, having no railway and only&nbsp;some 56 miles of water communication along its border. On&nbsp;the other hand, its masonry wells afford it a greater assurance&nbsp;against famine ; its drainage is superior to that of other districts ;&nbsp;it suffers comparatively less from floods ; and its area of artificial&nbsp;irrigation is so large that absolute famine ought to be almost&nbsp;unknown. The average rainfall of the district is 37 inches ; the&nbsp;rainfall is, however, very capricious and often deficient in the very&nbsp;months when it is most needed for agricultural purposes. Although&nbsp;possessing no railway communication, the district is well opened up&nbsp;by roads. Its gross revenue in 1882 was £153,072, of which&nbsp;£129,841 was derived from the land-tax. There are little trade and&nbsp;few manufactures, except cloth-weaving for local use, the making&nbsp;of brass and copper utensils, and glass ware.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> @@@<sup>1</sup> Rai Bareli division comprises the three districts of Rai Bareli, Sultanpur, and Partabgarh, and contains an area of 4882 square miles,&nbsp;with a population (1881) of 2,756,864 (males 1,362,761, females&nbsp;1,394,103). The great majority of the people are Hindus, of whom&nbsp;there are 2,493,536 ; the Mohammedans number 262,892 and the&nbsp;Christians 226.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

It was founded by the Bhars, who called it Bharauli, but&nbsp;it was subsequently corrupted into Bareli. The prefix&nbsp;“ Rai ” is either derived from Rahi, a village near the&nbsp;town, or from the fact of its having been long in the&nbsp;possession of a Kayasth family bearing the name of Rai.&nbsp;The population of the town (1881) is 11,781 (males&nbsp;5970, females 5811). It possesses many architectural&nbsp;features, chief of which is a spacious and strong fort&nbsp;erected in 1403, and constructed of bricks 2 feet long by&nbsp;1 foot thick and 1| wide. Among its ancient buildings&nbsp;are the magnificent palace and tomb of Nawab Jahan&nbsp;Khan, the governor in the time of Aurangzeb, and four&nbsp;fine mosques.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAIKES, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Robert </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1735-1811), the founder of Sunday schools, was the son of Robert Raikes, a printer in&nbsp;Gloucester and proprietor of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gloucester Journal</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, and&nbsp;was born on 14th September 1735. On the death of his&nbsp;father in 1757 he succeeded him in the business, which&nbsp;he continued to conduct till 1802. Along with some&nbsp;others he started a Sunday school at Gloucester in 1780,&nbsp;and on his giving publicity to the enterprise in the columns&nbsp;of his journal the notice was copied into the London papers&nbsp;and awakened considerable attention. For nearly thirty&nbsp;years he continued actively engaged in the promotion of&nbsp;his undertaking, and he lived to witness its wide extension&nbsp;throughout England. He died on 5th April 1811. Among&nbsp;various accounts of the life and work of Raikes mention&nbsp;may be made of that by P. M. Eastman, 1880.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Land-Rail, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">also very commonly known as the Corn-Crake, and sometimes as the Daker-Hen, is the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ballus crex</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Linnaeus and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Crex pratensis</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of recent&nbsp;authors. Its monotonous grating cry, which has given it&nbsp;its common name in several languages, is a familiar sound&nbsp;throughout the summer nights in many parts of the British&nbsp;Islands ; but the bird at that season very seldom shews&nbsp;itself, except when the mower lays bare its nest, the owner&nbsp;of which, if it escape beheading by the scythe, may be&nbsp;seen for an instant before it disappears into the friendly&nbsp;covert of the still standing grass. In early autumn the&nbsp;partridge-shooter not unfrequently flushes it from a clover-field or tangled hedgerow ; and, as it rises with apparent&nbsp;labour and slowly flies away to drop into the next place&nbsp;of concealment, if it fall not to his gun, he wonders how&nbsp;so weak-winged a creature can ever make its way to the&nbsp;shores if not to the interior of Africa, whither it is almost&nbsp;certainly bound ; for, with comparatively few individual&nbsp;exceptions, the Land-Rail is essentially migratory—nay&nbsp;more than that, it is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ortygometra</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of classical authors&nbsp;—supposed by them to lead the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Quail </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(supra,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> p. 146) on&nbsp;its voyages—and in the course of its wanderings has now&nbsp;been known to reach the coast of Greenland, and several&nbsp;times that of North America, to say nothing of Bermuda,&nbsp;in every instance we may believe as a straggler from Europe&nbsp;or Barbary. The Land-Rail needs but a brief description.&nbsp;It looks about as big as a Partridge, but on examination&nbsp;its appearance is found to be very deceptive, and it will&nbsp;hardly ever weigh more than half as much. The plumage above is of a tawny brown, the feathers being longitudinally streaked with blackish brown ; beneath it is of&nbsp;a yellowish white ; but the flanks are of a light chestnut.&nbsp;The species is very locally distributed, and in a way for&nbsp;which there is at present no accounting. In some dry&nbsp;upland and corn-growing districts it is plentiful; in others,&nbsp;of apparently the same character, it but rarely occurs ; and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
