<p><span class="font0">and its fall is correspondingly reduced. Accordingly, the discharging capacity of a river is materially diminished by the erection of overfall weirs ; and this is only partially remedied by the&nbsp;deepening of the channel for navigation, especially as deposit more&nbsp;readily accumulates in the lower part of a reach, owing to the&nbsp;reduction in velocity of the current by the conversion of the river&nbsp;into level reaches. Endeavours have been made to alleviate this&nbsp;defect by placing the weir in a wide place on the river, and at an&nbsp;angle to the cross section of the channel, thereby increasing the&nbsp;length of its sill, and consequently the discharge over it for any&nbsp;definite height of the river (fig. 2). The gain in length of an&nbsp;oblique weir is somewhat neutralized by the weir not being at&nbsp;right angles to the direction of the current ; and, even if the cross&nbsp;section of the channel above the sill of the weir is as large as the&nbsp;average section of the river bed, the change in shape, and the small&nbsp;hydraulic radius of the section over the weir, check the discharge&nbsp;of the stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Draw-door Weirs.—In order to afford a freer flow than is attainable with the best-designed overfall weir, draw-door weirs are sometimes adopted, which serve equally well to retain the water&nbsp;above during dry weather, and provide a large opening for the&nbsp;discharge of the stream in floods. Draw-door weirs consist of a row&nbsp;of doors, or sluice gates, sliding vertically in grooves formed at the&nbsp;sides of frames, piles, or piers, which are shut down when the flow&nbsp;is small, but are raised to admit the passage of flood waters. These&nbsp;weirs generally serve to supplement an ordinary overfall weir ; and,&nbsp;whilst the overfall weir regulates the flow in dry weather, the&nbsp;draw-door weir provides for its more rapid discharge in flood time.&nbsp;The relief, however, afforded by draw-door weirs depends entirely&nbsp;on the opening they furnish ; they are rarely, if ever, made equal&nbsp;in section to the river channel, and their sills are usually raised&nbsp;some feet above the bed of the river ; but, nevertheless, they are&nbsp;much superior to overfall weirs in respect of drainage, especially&nbsp;when the river has a small fall and low banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A large oblique overfall and draw-door weir has been erected across the Thames, by Mr Leach, at the limit of its tidal flow at&nbsp;Teddington, having a total length of 480 feet. This weir is&nbsp;divided into four bays, the two side bays being overfalls, whilst&nbsp;the two central bays, 172∣ feet and 69 j feet wide respectively, are&nbsp;closed by large iron draw-doors sliding in grooves at the sides&nbsp;of strong iron frames supporting a foot bridge from which the doors&nbsp;are raised. The frames rest upon piles, and on the top of a rubble&nbsp;mound raised about a foot above low-tide level.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The friction of large draw-doors against the grooves, in being lifted, is considerable when there is a head of water on one side ;&nbsp;but this has been much reduced by Mr F. Stoney, in a large weir&nbsp;in Brazil, by making the doors, 20 feet in width, bear on each side&nbsp;against a row of free rollers suspended in the grooves.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Movable Weirs. —Although draw-door weirs afford a much freer discharge for a river than overfall weirs, the vertical frames or&nbsp;piers in which the doors slide offer more or less impediment to the&nbsp;flow. This defect is avoided by movable weirs, which, whilst&nbsp;equally efficient in retaining the water when raised, can be entirely&nbsp;lowered or removed so as to leave the channel quite open in floodtime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are three types of movable weirs which have been regularly adopted abroad, whilst other forms have been occasionally tried.&nbsp;The two types most extensively used are the frame or needle weiland the shutter weir, whereas the drum weir has been only erected&nbsp;on the Marne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ∕rατne weir consists of a series of movable iron frames, placed at intervals across the channel of a river end on to the current,&nbsp;carrying a foot bridge at the top, and supporting a wooden watertight barrier which forms the actual weir. Till recently the&nbsp;barrier was always composed of a series of long square wooden&nbsp;spars, or needles, placed close together and nearly vertical, resting&nbsp;against a sill at the bottom and against a horizontal bar connecting the frames near the top (fig. 3). This type of weir has,&nbsp;accordingly, been very commonly called a needle weir {barrage a&nbsp;aiguilles)g but this term would not now include every form of the&nbsp;frame weir. The first needle weir was erected across the Yonne in&nbsp;1834 ; and till 1881 all the weirs on the Seine below Paris were of&nbsp;this form. The needle weir is opened by lifting each needle&nbsp;successively from the foot bridge ; one of the end frames is then&nbsp;disconnected from the rest by unfastening and withdrawing the&nbsp;connecting bars, the corresponding portion of the foot bridge is&nbsp;taken up, and the frame, which is hinged at the bottom, is lowered&nbsp;by chains on to the apron of the weir, and the whole of the frames&nbsp;are similarly lowered in succession, leaving the passage quite&nbsp;clear. The weir is closed again by a precisely reverse series of&nbsp;operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the weight of the needle, which should be readily lifted by one man, imposes a limit to the height of the weir, the large frame&nbsp;weir recently erected at Pσrt-Villez near Vernon, having a height&nbsp;of 18 feet, has been closed by a sort of wooden hinged shutter&nbsp;which spans the interval of 3⅛ feet between each frame, and can be&nbsp;rolled up from the bottom and removed when the weir is to be&nbsp;opened.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font0">A series of similar hinged shutters are designed to close double intervals between the frames, about 7 feet wide, of the frame weir in&nbsp;progress at Poses, the next weir above Martot weir which is at the&nbsp;boundary of the tidal Seine above Rouen. Poses weir has a form&nbsp;quite distinct from all frame weirs hitherto constructed, for its&nbsp;vertical frames are suspended from an overhead girder, and rest&nbsp;against a sill at the bottom when down, but can be raised entirely&nbsp;out of water into a horizontal position when the weir is open. The&nbsp;girders carry a foot bridge, from which the frames and hinged&nbsp;shutters are raised and lowered, and rest on masonry piers dividing&nbsp;the river into seven bays, the two navigable passes being 106⅛ feet&nbsp;and the five shallower passes 99 feet wide. The girders spanning&nbsp;the two navigable passes leave a clear headway of 17⅛ feet above&nbsp;the navigable high water, whilst the rest of the girders are merely&nbsp;placed above flood level. The fall at the weir is 13 feet. The&nbsp;system is costly, with its girders and piers, but it secures all the&nbsp;movable parts of the weir from injury in flood, and enables the&nbsp;weir to be worked with perfect ease and safety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sliding panels have been adopted for closing the frame weir across the Rhone at Mulatière, near Lyons, erected in 1882; and a&nbsp;comparison is being made of the relative durability of sliding&nbsp;panels and hinged shutters by placing the two systems side by side&nbsp;at Suresnes weir just below Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The earliest form of shutter weir consisted of a gate, or shutter, turning on a horizontal axis at the bottom, supported by a prop&nbsp;when raised against the stream, and falling flat on the apron of the&nbsp;weir when the prop was withdrawn. As considerable force would&nbsp;be required to raise such a shutter against a strong stream, a&nbsp;second up-stream gate is usually provided, which, rising with&nbsp;the stream and being retained by chains, relieves the pressure on&nbsp;the down-stream gate, and enables it to be readily raised and&nbsp;propped up. The waterlevel is then equalized on both sides of&nbsp;the upper gate, which is then lowered ; and the lower gate forms&nbsp;the actual weir, which can be opened by merely releasing the prop.&nbsp;In India, where this form of shutter weir has been adopted on a&nbsp;large scale, the strain on the retaining chains was so great, when&nbsp;the upper shutter was raised in a strong current to shut off the&nbsp;river from the irrigation canals, that hydraulic brakes have been&nbsp;substituted, by Mr Fouracres, for controlling the motion of the&nbsp;up-stream shutters. A closed cylinder full of water is fixed on the&nbsp;apron of the weir above the upper shutter, in which a piston,&nbsp;attached to the upper side of the shutter, is fitted. Directly the&nbsp;current tends to lift the shutter, the piston is drawn against the&nbsp;cushion of water in the cylinder, which controls its motion. The&nbsp;pressure of the piston forces the water gradually out of some small&nbsp;orifices along the side of the cylinder, so that the piston is enabled&nbsp;to travel slowly along the cylinder. In its progress, however, it&nbsp;passes by some of the orifices, whereby the rate of efflux of the&nbsp;remaining water is reduced, and a greater resistance offered to the&nbsp;motion of the piston. Whilst therefore the shutter in rising&nbsp;presents a greater surface to the stream, and consequently exerts a&nbsp;greater pull upon the piston, the retarding force is similarly&nbsp;increased, and the shutter is thus gradually raised without any jar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At Brûlée Island weir, on the Yonne, the up-stream shutter has been dispensed with; and the shutter forming the weir is&nbsp;raised against the stream by a piston working in a hydraulic press&nbsp;(fig. 4), the water pressure being supplied from an accumulator&nbsp;which is charged by means of a turbine worked by the fall of&nbsp;water at the weir. The weir is closed by seven shutters, 11⅜ feet&nbsp;long and 6 feet high, which can be raised in five minutes ; and the&nbsp;power for damming up the stream is actually obtained from the&nbsp;stream itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The form of shutter weir most commonly adopted in France is shown in fig. 5, representing a section of the largest and most&nbsp;recent weir of this type, erected at Port-à-Γ Anglais weir on the&nbsp;Seine, two or three miles above Paris ; and weirs on the same&nbsp;system have been erected across the Great Kanawha river in the&nbsp;United States. The shutter revolves upon a horizontal axis placed&nbsp;just above the centre of pressure on the down-stream side of the&nbsp;shutter. The axis is fastened on an iron tressel hinged to the&nbsp;apron of the weir ; and the shutter and tressel are supported in&nbsp;position by a wrought-iron prop resting against a cast-iron shoe&nbsp;fixed on the apron. When the weir is closed, the shutter butts&nbsp;against a sill at the bottom, as is shown on fig. 5. The weir can be&nbsp;more or less opened, from the foot bridge, by means of chains&nbsp;fastened to the top and bottom of the shutter; and it can be&nbsp;completely lowered in flood time by releasing the prop from its&nbsp;shoe, when the prop, tressel, and shutter fall flat upon the apron,&nbsp;their fall being regulated by aid of the chains ; the frames also&nbsp;supporting the foot bridge, being hinged to the apron, can be&nbsp;lowered as in the ordinary frame weir. The weir is raised by first&nbsp;reinstating the foot bridge, and then raising the shutters, with&nbsp;the connected tressels and props, by means of the chains.
