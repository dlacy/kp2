He obtained the friendship of Cornelius Gallus, governor of Egypt. In order to collect materials for his great work, he travelled in many different regions ; and after much toil and research completed his Geography, which is justly regarded as a very precious relique of antiquity. It consists of seventeen books, all of which are not however entire. The first two books are employed in showing that the study of geography is not only worthy of, but even necessary to, a philosopher; the third describes Spain ; the fourth, Gaul and the Britannic isles ; the fifth and sixth, Italy and the adjacent isles ; the seventh, which is imperfect at the end, Germany, the countries of the Getæ and Illyrii, Taurica Chersonesus, and Epirus ; the eighth, ninth, and tenth, Greece with the neighbouring isles ; the four following, Asia within Mount Taurus ; the fifteenth and sixteenth, Asia without Taurus, India, Persia, Syria, Arabia; and the seventeenth, Egypt, Ethiopia, Carthage, and other countries of Africa.</p><p>Strabo’s Geography first appeared in a Latin version, executed by Phavorinus and Tifcrnas, and printed at Rome by Sweynheym and Pannartz. It is an ample folio volume, without date, but is supposed to have been printed in or about the year 1469. The earliest edition with a date is that of Venice, 1472, fol. The <hi rend="italic">editio princeps </hi>of the Greek text proceeded from the press of Aldus, Venet. 1516, folio. This edition, which is not distinguished by its accuracy, was succeeded by that of Marcus Hopper, Basil. 1549, fol. He has printed a Latin translation by Glareanus and Hartungus. An edition, containing an elegant version, with notes and castigations, was next produced by Xylander, Basil. 1571, fol. But all these were eclipsed by the edition of Casaubon, Genev. 1597, fol. By the aid of four MSS. and of his own critical sagacity, he greatly improved the Greek text. He retained the version of Xylander. He afterwards augmented and improved his annotations, and the work was reprinted at Paris in 1620, after the death of the very learned editor. This second edition of Casaubon, together with the notes of various other critics, was republished by T. Janson van Almeloveen, Amst. 1707, fol. He has subjoined the <hi rend="italic">Chrestomathiæ,</hi> or epitome of Strabo ; which, according to Dodwell, was compiled by some unknown writer between the years 976 and 996. It had been found of some use, not only in contributing to the correction of the text, but likewise in supplying to a certain extent the defect of the seventh book. An elaborate and valuable edition of Strabo was commenced by Siebenkees, and completed by Tzschucke, Lipsiæ, 1796-1819, 7 tom. 8vo. Much was expected from the edition of Falconer, Oxon. 1807, 2 tom. fol. It was one defect of the editor, that he was not sufficiently acquainted with the labours of the continental critics. Nor must we overlook an edition of the text, illustrated with Greek notes by Coray, Paris. 1815, 4 tom. 8vo. Strabo was translated into German by Penzel. A French translation was undertaken by command of the emperor, and was executed by De la Porte du Theil, Coray, and Letronne. The introduction, and the notes distinguished by the letter G, were contributed by Gossellin. “ Géographie de Strabon, traduite du Grec en Français.” Paris, 1805-19, 5 tom. 4to.</p><p>STRADA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Famianos,</hi> an ingenious and learned Jesuit, was born at Rome in the year 1572, and there taught rhetoric for fifteen years. He wrote several pieces upon the art of oratory, and published some orations with a view of illustrating by example what he had inculcated by precept. But his “ Prolusiones Academicæ” and his “ Historia de Bello Belgico’’ are the works which raised his reputation, and have preserved his memory. His history of the war of Flanders was published at Rome, the first decad in 1640, the second in 1647; the whole extending from the death of Charles V. which happened in 1558, to the year 1590. It is written in good Latin, as all allow; but its merit in other respects has been variously estimated. His “ Prolusiones Academicæ” show great ingenuity, and a masterly skill in classical literature ; that prolusion especially in which he introduces Lucan, Lucretius, Claudian, Ovid, Statius, and Virgil, each of them versifying according to his own strain. This work has often been printed. Strada died at Rome in the Jesuits College in the year 1649.</p><p>STRAHAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">William,</hi> an eminent printer, was born at Edinburgh in the year 1715. His father, who had a small appointment in the customs, gave his son the education which every one of decent rank then received in a country where the avenues to learning were easy, and open to men of the most moderate circumstances. After having passed through the tuition of a grammar-school, he served an apprenticeship to a printer, and when a very young man removed to a wider sphere in that line of business, and went to follow his trade in London. Sober, diligent, and attentive, while his emoluments were for some time very scanty, he contrived to live rather within than beyond his income ; and though he married early, and without such a provision as prudence might have looked for in the establishment of a family, he continued to thrive, and to better his circumstances. This he would often mention as an encouragement to early matrimony ; and used to say, he never had a child born that Providence did not send some increase of income to provide for the increase of his household. With sufficient vigour of mind, he had that happy flow of animal spirits that is not easily discouraged by unpromising appearances.</p><p>His abilities in his profession, accompanied with perfect integrity and unabating diligence, enabled him, after the first difficulties were overcome, to advance with rapid success. And he was one of the most flourishing men of the trade, when, in the year 1740, he purchased a share of the patent for king’s printer, of Mr Eyre, with whom he maintained the most cordial intimacy during the rest of his life. Beside the emoluments arising from this appointment, as well as from a very extensive private business, he now drew largely from a field which it required some degree of speculative sagacity to cultivate, on account of the great literary property which he acquired by purchasing the copyrights of the most celebrated authors of the time. Here his liberality kept pace with his prudence, and in some cases went perhaps rather beyond it. Never had such rewards been given to the labours of literary men, as were received from him and his associates in their purchases of copyrights.</p><p>Having now attained the first great object of business, wealth, Mr Strahan looked with a very allowable ambition on the stations of political rank and eminence. Politics had long occupied his active mind, and he had for many years pursued them as his favourite amusement, by corresponding on that subject with some of the first characters of the age. Mr Strahan’s queries to Dr Franklin in the year 1769, respecting the discontents of the Americans, published in the London Chronicle of 28th July 1778, show the just conception which he entertained of the important consequences of that dispute, and his anxiety as a good subject to investigate, at that early period, the proper means by which their grievances might be removed, and a permanent harmony restored between the two countries. In the year 1775 he was elected a member of parliament for the borough of Malmesbury in Wiltshire, with a very illustrious colleague, Mr Fox ; and in the succeeding parliament, for Wooton Basset, in the same county. In this station, applying himself</p></body></text></TEI>
