<p><span class="font1">In addition to the ordinary articular processes (or zygapo-physes), which are here broad and flattened, often with an accessory process, there are two noteworthy structures.&nbsp;The first of these is called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">zygosphene,</span><span class="font1"> and consists of&nbsp;a wedge-shaped process with two articular surfaces, which&nbsp;projects forward from the anterior surface of each neural&nbsp;arch. The other is called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">zyg-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">antrum,</span><span class="font1"> and is a corresponding</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">excavation with two articular sur</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">faces on the hinder side of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">neural arch, and receives the zygo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sphene of the vertebra next behind</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">it. It was structures such as these</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">that were referred to in the last</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">paragraph as existing so exception</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ally amongst Lacertilians in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iguana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The atlas and axis have a form similar to that already described&nbsp;as existing in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertilia.</span><span class="font1"> Long azygous hypapophyses&nbsp;nearly always depend from the centre of the anterior trunk&nbsp;vertebræ, or even from the whole&nbsp;of them, being especially large and&nbsp;numerous in some of the most&nbsp;poisonous Serpents, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g., Crotalus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Naja.</span><span class="font1"> In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dasypeltis scaber&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">some of these processes in the anterior dorsal region are made to&nbsp;minister to alimentation,—their&nbsp;tips being coated with tooth substance, and penetrating within the&nbsp;alimentary canal, as will be again&nbsp;mentioned further on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ribs assume the function of locomotion, and are therefore very movably articulated to&nbsp;short transverse processes. Each has two proximal articular surfaces, but they are close to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">gether, there being no diverging</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">articular and tubercular processes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Each rib terminates in a short car</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">tilage. The caudal vertebræ may,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in rare instances, be very few, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">they may be very numerous—from</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">five to two hundred. They do not</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">possess chevron bones, but bifold</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">depending hypapophyses, and they</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">have transverse processes which also</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">are generally bent downwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sometimes, at the limit between the body and the tail, the transverse process, or the rib, as the case may be,&nbsp;bifurcates or develops an ascending process, as, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g</span><span class="font1">., in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boa,&nbsp;Naja,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Echidna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No Ophidian has any sternum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia.—</span><span class="font1">The Tortoises and Turtles present a spinal structure remarkably divergent from that of all other&nbsp;Reptiles, and especially divergent from that of Ophidians.&nbsp;Nevertheless the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia</span><span class="font1"> agree with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidia</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;having no sternum, and in having at least a portion of the&nbsp;vertebral column formed for extreme mobility, in spite of&nbsp;the excessive rigidity and immobility of the trunk. Only&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis</span><span class="font1"> do we find a structure generally resembling&nbsp;that of other Reptiles and diverging from that common to&nbsp;other Chelonians. With the exception of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis,</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;structure of the vertebral column of which will be subsequently noticed, the Chelonians present the following&nbsp;characters. The endoskeleton of the dorsal region is&nbsp;intimately united with those ossified exoskeletal plates&nbsp;which have been already described </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(supra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 447) as&nbsp;investing both dorsally and ventrally the entire trunk.&nbsp;The median series of plates are united with the neural&nbsp;spines and arches, and the lateral plates are similarly&nbsp;united with the ribs, so that the carapace is formed both&nbsp;of endoskeletal and exoskeletal elements intimately united.&nbsp;The constancy of the number of vertebræ is very exceptional, as is also the very small number of those of the&nbsp;body. There are always 8 cervical, 12 dorsal, and 2&nbsp;sacral vertebræ. The number of caudal vertebræ varies,&nbsp;but is never great. The cervical vertebræ have very small&nbsp;processes, whereby they are better fitted for great mobility.&nbsp;They vary greatly as to the form of their centra, some&nbsp;being opisthocœlous, others proc</span><span class="font0">œ</span><span class="font1">lous, others biconvex,&nbsp;while one at least is flattened both in front and behind—&nbsp;the arrangement differing even in different species of the&nbsp;same genus. The atlas consists of three pieces, and the os&nbsp;odontoideum is separate. The neuro-central suture persists. The centra of the first ten dorsal vertebræ are&nbsp;amphicœlous, and but loosely connected with twin neural&nbsp;arches, each neural arch being superimposed over the&nbsp;posterior half of one vertebra and the anterior half of the&nbsp;vertebra next behind. The sacral vertebræ have either&nbsp;stout ribs Suturally attached or transverse processes anchy-losed to the vertebræ. The caudal vertebræ are proc</span><span class="font0">œ</span><span class="font1">lous,&nbsp;and generally have a pair of separate descending processes,&nbsp;which may (as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ghelydra)</span><span class="font1"> unite distally and form&nbsp;chevron bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis</span><span class="font1"> the endoskeleton is quite distinct from the exoskeleton. Its neural arches are very loosely united to&nbsp;the centra, so that they can be separated with the greatest&nbsp;ease. The trans</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">verse processes of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the caudal vertebræ</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">also remain unan-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">chylosed to their</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">centra. The dorsal</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">vertebræ pass so</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">gradually into the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">caudal that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">boundary can only</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">be determined by</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the somewhat in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">creased thickness of the transverse process of the two sacral vertebræ. The summits of the neural arches are somewhat&nbsp;dilated (as if from superincumbent pressure) or obtusely&nbsp;keeled. The ribs are not much expanded, their heads&nbsp;fitting into a hollow formed by the centra of two vertebræ&nbsp;together with the neural arch superimposed upon the two.&nbsp;They become shorter and narrower behind, that of the&nbsp;tenth dorsal vertebra being even smaller than the sacral&nbsp;ribs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Skull.—</span><span class="font1">The anterior portion of the axial skeleton, or cranium, differs markedly from that of every other&nbsp;class of Vertebrates, while it presents a much greater&nbsp;diversity of structure than does the cranium of Mammals&nbsp;or of Birds. It differs from the cranium of the lower&nbsp;Vertebrate classes by its more complete Ossificationand by&nbsp;a greater prolongation backwards of the nasal cavity,&nbsp;which causes a greater expanse and density of the palatal&nbsp;structure. The skull, however, is not so much ossified as&nbsp;in Mammals, and the bones do not become anchylosed&nbsp;together so quickly and certainly as in Birds. The&nbsp;occipital region always consists of four occipital elements,&nbsp;and there is an ossified basisphenoid in front of a well-developed basioccipital. The skull almost always articulates with the atlas by a single occipital condyle. The&nbsp;lower jaw is always suspended to the skull by the intervention of a quadrate bone with which the os articulare&nbsp;of the mandible articulates. Besides the last-mentioned&nbsp;bone the mandible consists of as many bones as in Fishes,&nbsp;with the addition of a supra-angular and a complementary&nbsp;bone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The bones of the cranium may form a very solid and</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
