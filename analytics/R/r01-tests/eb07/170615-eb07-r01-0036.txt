making a foot in each case for the unit of space, and a second for the unit of time, we get the measure of the centrifugal force represented by its proportion to the weight P. Thus on a curve of 500 feet radius, at a velocity of 20 miles an hour, or 29, 25 feet per second, we have

or about τ ⅛ . P, the effect of which force in the direction of the radius, will of course be to press the carriages against the outside rail till the flange of the wheel stops them ; and the elevation of the outer rail must be such that the centrifugal force is so balanced by the natural tendency from gravitation, by which the carriages would slide towards the inner rail, that the coned wheel corrects the effect of curvature without producing a friction on the flange,
calling y=the elevation of the outside rail,

If we suppose this lateral displacement to have taken place,
the inclination of the plane on which the carriages will be, is

whilst, at the same time, from the coned form of the wheels,
the tire having an inclination -, this lateral deviation to
