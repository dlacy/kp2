 in botany: Agenus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">decandria,</hi> and the order of <hi rend="italic">pentagynia ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem arranged under the 22d order, <hi rend="italic">caryophylleae.</hi> The calyx is pentaphyllous ; the petals five, and undivided ; the capſule oval, unilocular, and containing five valves. There are five species, the arvenſis, nodoſa, pentandra, laricina, and ſaginoides ; all of which are Britiſh : 1. The <hi rend="italic">arvenſis,</hi> corn-ſpurrey, has linear ſurrowed leaves, from eight to twenty in a whirl. The flowers are small, white, and terminal. It is frequent in corn-fields. In Holland it is cultivated as food for cattle, and has the advantage of growing on the very pooreſt soils ; but does not afford a great deal of food. Poultry are fond of the seeds ; and the inhabitants of Finland and Norway make bread of them when their crops of corn fail. Horſes, ſheep, goats, and ſwine, eat it. Cows refuſe it.</p><p>2. The <hi rend="italic">nodoſa,</hi> knotted ſpurrey. Several ſtalks ariſe from one root, ſometimes reclining and ſometimes erect, and from three to five inches high. The leaves are ſmooth, of a fine green, narrow, pointed, and oppoſite. The flowers are white, terminal, with yellow antherse.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Pentandra,</hi> ſmall ſpurrey. The leaves are very narrow, and grow in whirls at the joints. The ſeeds are black with a white circle. It flowers in July.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Laricina,</hi> larch-leaved ſpurrey. Several ſtalks<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0694.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0688"/>
ariſe from one root, from an inch to an inch and a half high ; the leaves are linear, tabulate, and acuminated, ſomewhat hairy on the edges, and their points turned to one side of the ſtalk. The petals are white and about the length of the calyx. Lightfoot found this ſpecies on a hill in the iſle of Bute. He is doubtful whether the s <hi rend="italic">agina procumbens,</hi> var. <hi rend="italic">β</hi> of Linnaeus, be not the ſame plant with this. It flowers in July.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Saginoides,</hi> pearlwort ſpurrey, has ſmooth, linear, oppoſite leaves: the peduncles are ſolitary and very long. Aiton ſays it is a native of England, and flowers from June to Auguſt.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
