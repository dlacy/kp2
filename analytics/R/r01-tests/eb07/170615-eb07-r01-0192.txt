false meshes
equidistantly, then twenty rows of
dead
netting, then a row with five
false meshes ;
repeat this manœuvre ; then net thirty-six rows of
dead
netting, and the next row in 
double
twine ; thus you have an upper and a lower row, as shown in fig. 5, the dotted lines representing the lower row. Cut off the thread which has worked the
upper
row, leaving an end ; empty your needle, and wind on it the thread that proceeds from the
lower
row, and work on with the single twine as follows, taking care, however, to pick up only the loops of the
lower
row as you go round. Net on the same spool fourteen rows of
dead
netting, then at equal distances in tlle circumference of the fifteenth row set in eight
stole 
meshes, then net two rows of
dead
netting, in the next row eight stole meshes in a line with the others ; repeat this action three times more. After you have for the fifth time set in your
stole
meshes, net a row of plain netting ; lay aside the two-inch spool, and take a twelve-inch and net one row. The
valve
is now finished, and must be reflected inwards to gain its right position. You now take your needle, charged with single twine, and join on to that end which was left at the upper row where the valve issued from the
body
of the engine ; with the two-inch spool net eleven rows of dead netting. In the next row set in five
false meshes
at equal distances each from the other, and continue to set in these at every third row eleven times in the same line. This done, make seven rows of
dead
netting, then one row on a four-inch spool in
double
twine. Through this last row a pliant stick is passed, about six feet long, and bent into a
bow
(BBB, fig. 8) ; a piece of cord keeps the extremities in place, answering to the string of the archer’s bow ; the lower meshes of the net’s mouth are strung on this cord, see fig. 8. A weight is generally attached to the 
bow
at its extremities, somewhere towards BB. Four hoops are lashed round the net at HHHH, to prevent its collapsing ; these are larger as they proceed from the point to the mouth, and are made of slighter wood than the bow, the smallest being about one foot three inches diameter, and tlle largest two feet.
Some
hoop-nets
have more tnan one
valve.
In that case the hoops must always be placed at the entrance of the 
valves,
and many netters make a row of
double
twine at those parts, to give additional strength where there is most strain on the netting. The large loops at the bottom of the
funnel
are tied together, in
fasces
of equal number of loops, to four lines, and these are made fast to another line which is threaded through the last row of meshes belonging to the point of the
body,
and which, being drawn tight, closes up the entrance at that part. All the lines are then tied to a support at P, and thus the net is kept extended. The principle of this engine is analogous to that of the common mouse-trap. Wtien there is only one valve (as in fig. 8, V), the fisherman withdraws the fish by loosing the line that closes the body of the engine at P ; but when there are more than one valve, he makes a
regard
in the
body 
between each hoop. A
regard
is thus made : Net round and round, and when arrived at the part wherein you wish to put a
regard, return on your work ;
and when you again come to the place where you altered your mode of netting, return again ; and thus continue until you have made the 
regard
of sufficient length, then work round and round as before.
A
tunnel
for partridges is made like the hoop-net, but without valves.
The
trawl
is a very large and rapacious net, and much discussion has been held as to whether it should be permitted. It would seem, however, upon a careful examination of evidence, that, under proper restrictions, it is not detrimental to the fisheries. This engine is composed of two separate pieces, called the
upper
and the
lower leaf ; 
the meshes are about two inches square. For the
under leaf
or
blade,
net 16Ü loops in
double
twine, two rows, then
with single twine net a plain row ; in the next, set in a
stole
mesh at about the sixth mesh from the beginning, and another at about the sixth mesh from the end of the row ; net three rows of
dead
netting, then set in
stole
meshes as before ; repeat this once again, afterwards go on setting in 
stole meshes
less frequently, t.
e.
leave five rows of dead netting between, until the width of the
blade
is reduced to thirty-six meshes, then net about five feet for the
hose
or 
tail
H, fig. 9. The
wings
are now to be set on to this
leaf. 
For this purpose you must begin working at the other extremity, or top of the
leaf,
as at T or
t ;
net fifty-six loops and stop ; return on your work ; net again to the end of your row (the third), and here, quite at the extremity, set in a
false
mesh ; but when, in the course of netting row after row, you come to the
false
meshes, do
not
take them up, but let them
hang,
as is shown in fig. 9 at B and B of the
wings
W and W. At the
commencement
of every row which alternates with those to which you add a
false 
mesh, at about three loops from the beginning, set in a
stole 
mesh ; thus
the false
meshes will always be on one side, and the
stole
meshes on the other side of the
wing,
which will thus be diminished at last to eighteen meshes. When this is effected, net two rows in
double
twine, not adding or diminishing. Thus one
wing
is done ; net the other in the same way, and take care that the one is exactly the same as the other. The
under
leaf being now finished, we pass on to the structure of the
upper blade,
fig. 10. Net 180
loops 
in
double
twine, two rows ; then with single twine forty rows of
dead
netting; diminish evenly and gradually from 180 to 160 meshes, taking notice that this reduction must be made before you come to a level with the
doιd>le
rows whence the
wings
rose in the other
blade.
Diminish from 160 to thirty-six, as you did when working down the
lower leaf
making the
hose
as before. The
blades
being now finished, must be joined together down their sides, as the sides of a sack are ; and a rope, acting as a binding along the seams, is sewn on, in the same way as the
head-rope
of the 
trammel.
Round the top of the
upper blade
a rope is strung through the meshes, and carried round the
bosom 
BBB, fig. 9, being sewn to, and not threaded through, the 
hanging false loops
of the
wings
W, W. The twτ o blades are then sewn together at certain parts to form
pockets,
in the direction of A, A, A, A, A, A;
oooooo,
being the orifice of the pockets. At L, L, loops of rope are bent, to which lines are hitched for hauling the net out of the sea into the boat. The two
blades
or
leaves
must be
exactly 
of the same length ; for, when joined, the top row of the 
wings
must be even with the top row of the back of the net or
upper blade,
and the
hose
should meet no less accurately at the bottom. When the
trawl
is in the sea, a long beam of about thirty feet in length and seven incites in circumference is lashed to the top of the net, keeping the 
wings
and back extended from point to point. This beam is let into irons, called
trawl-heads,
at each extremity, which serve to sink it. A heavy rope, usually made of old netting, tightly twisted and bound round with strong twine, is lashed along the bosom of the net. Thus
mounted,
the engine is lowered into the sea, being
trailed
or
trawled
along the bottom by means of a rope attached to the boat’s mast, and communicating with each end of the
beam
by a
bridle.
The 
bosom
touches the ground, and the
upper blade
and
beam 
floats over it ; the
bosom’s
rope disturbs the fish at the bottom ; they are, however, Stopped from escaping, by striking against the
upper blade,
which extends over the
bosom,
so they swim down the
trawl
to the Aose ,∙ but this is tied up, so they next attempt to return towards the mouth of the net ; but in their way they fall into the pockets, which only open inwards towards the
hose,
and thus are secured.
Â 
day-net
is used for catching larks from 14th September to 14th November; after that, until 25th February, the
trammel.
The reason of tllis is, that during the latter division of
