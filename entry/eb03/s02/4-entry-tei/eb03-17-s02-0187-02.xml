in a ſhip, are certain channels cut through the water-ways and ſides of a ſhip, at proper diſtances, and lined with plated lead, in order to carry the water off from the deck into the ſea. The ſcuppets of the lower deck of a ſhip of war are uſually furniſhed with a leathern pipe, called the <hi rend="italic">ſcupper-ho</hi> ſ <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> which hangs downward from the mouth or opening of the ſcupper. The intent of this is to prevent the water from entering when the ſhip inclines under a weight of ſail.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
