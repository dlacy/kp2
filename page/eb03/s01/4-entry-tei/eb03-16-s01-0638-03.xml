a province of Poland, bounded on the north by Courland, on the eaſt by Lithuania, on the weſt by the Baltic Sea, and on the ſouth by Regal Pruſſia, being about 175 miles in length and 125 in breadth. It is full of foreſts and very high mountains, which feed a great number of cattle, and produce a large quantity of honey. There are alſo very active horſes, in high eſteem. The inhabitants are clowniſh, but honeſt; and they will not allow a young woman to go out in the night without a candle in her hand and two bells at her girdle. Roſſenna and Wormia are the principal places.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
