<p><span class="font0">RANDOM Shot, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gunnery,</span><span class="font0"> is a shot made when the muzzle of a gun is raised above the horizontal line, and is&nbsp;not designed to shoot directly or point black. The utmost&nbsp;random of any piece is about ten times as far as the bullet&nbsp;will go point blank. The bullet will go farthest when the&nbsp;piece is mounted at an angle of about forty-five degrees&nbsp;above the level range.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RANGAMUTTY, a town and district of Hindustan, in the north-western extremity of Bengal, situated about the&nbsp;twenty-sixth degree of north latitude, and formerly included in the extensive kingdom of Kamroop. After its subjugation by the Mahommedans, about the middle of the&nbsp;seventeenth century, it was annexed to the collectorship of&nbsp;Rungpore. It has for its boundaries Bootan on the north,&nbsp;the Gaιτow Hills on the south, Assam on the east, and&nbsp;Cooch Bahar and Rungpoor on the west. It is a wild uncultivated country, stretching on both sides of the Brahmaputra, easterly, to the confines of Assam. Many parts of&nbsp;the country, the area of which is 2620 square miles, might&nbsp;be rendered extremely productive, although at present they&nbsp;yield little more than a few elephants, which are caught&nbsp;annually in the neighbouring forests. The chief river is&nbsp;the Brahmaputra, which nearly intersects the country ; and&nbsp;the principal towns are Rangamutty and Goalporah. The&nbsp;former is situated near the hills, between two tributary&nbsp;streams of the Brahmaputra. It has declined from its ancient prosperity. Long. 90. E. Lat. 26. 9. N.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RANGER, a sworn officer of a forest, appointed by the king’s letters patent, and whose proper business it is to walk&nbsp;through his charge, to drive back the deer out of the purlieus, and to present all trespasses within his jurisdiction at&nbsp;the next forest court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RANGOON, a city and principal sea-port of the Bur-man empire, in the province of Pegu. It is situated on the Rangoon river, one of the mouths of the great Irrawaddy, about twenty-four miles from its mouth. The river is&nbsp;broad, deep, and navigable. At its entrance it is nearly a&nbsp;mile in width, and is distinguished by a clump of trees called&nbsp;the Elephant, which stands on the western point. It gradually narrow's to about a quarter of a mile opposite Rangoon. There is a depth of from six to eight fathoms water&nbsp;in the river, and no shoals ; and there are four fathoms water on the bar at half flood. About three miles below the&nbsp;town is the mouth of the Syriam or Pegu river, where it&nbsp;joins the Rangoon. The country above is level, and agreeably variegated with clumps of trees ; although it appears&nbsp;to be much depopulated, from the frequent wars between&nbsp;the Burmese and Peguers. The town, with the exception&nbsp;of the public offices, and one or two houses, is built of wood,&nbsp;extends along the bank of the river about a mile, and is&nbsp;about half or three quarters of a mile in breadth. It is built&nbsp;in the form of a square, surrounded by a stockade fifteen&nbsp;feet high, and on the north side it is farther strengthened by&nbsp;an indifferent fosse, across which a wooden bridge is thrown.&nbsp;The fort or stockade is an irregular square, the north and&nbsp;south faces of which were found to measure 1145 yards, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">east 598, and the west 187. On the north face there arθ two gates and a sally-port, on the south three gates and&nbsp;three sally-ports, on the east two gates, and on the west&nbsp;one gate and one sally-port. The stockade is fifteen feet&nbsp;high, and is composed of heavy beams of teak timber. The&nbsp;city and its suburbs are divided into eight wards, superintended by an officer, whose business it is to maintain, watch,&nbsp;and ward within his division. The palisaded fort or stockade is a town composed of three wide and clean streets running east and west, and three smaller ones crossing them,&nbsp;and fronting the gates of the south face. The most populous part of the town is the suburb called TackalIy, immediately on the west face of the stockade. Wooden stages&nbsp;are erected within the stockade for musketeers to stand on&nbsp;in case of attack. A battery of twelve pieces of cannon,&nbsp;raised on the banks, commands the river ; but it has fallen&nbsp;into disrepair. The town has by no means an imposing&nbsp;appearance. The wooden buildings along the banks of the&nbsp;river resemble barns, though the great temple of Shoe Da-goon, in the midst of its intermediate spires, forms a splendid object. This temple is a well-known place of pilgrimage ; it is frequented by many strangers during the vernal festival in March, when, as it is usual in the East to connect commerce and religion, a great fair is held near it. It&nbsp;is the only temple frequented as a common place of worship by the inhabitants of Rangoon and its vicinity. The&nbsp;principal part of the city is situated within the stockade ; the&nbsp;streets are wide and at right angles ; and one or two houses&nbsp;only are built of brick and chunam, the chief of which is&nbsp;the custom-house. The dwellings of the common people&nbsp;are constructed of posts driven into the ground, at the distance of two or three feet, from which there is a bamboo&nbsp;grating forming the floor. The roof is covered with the&nbsp;leaves of the palmyra, or long grass twisted round and&nbsp;sewed to slips of bamboo. The houses of the priests are&nbsp;large buildings of teak, with substantial tiled roofs ; the&nbsp;floors are commonly eight or twelve feet from the ground,&nbsp;and many of them are carved. In these are contained the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">marble or gilded wooden images of Gaudma, seated on an oak, in which their sacred books are contained. The suburb&nbsp;of Tackally, inhabited by the lower classes, is more populous&nbsp;than the town itself. Almost all the houses here, as in other&nbsp;parts, are composed of the cheapest and frailest materials, and&nbsp;are peculiarly liable to destruction by fire. In March 1826,&nbsp;Mr Crawford, who was sent on an embassy to Ava, saw the&nbsp;whole suburb burned to the ground in a few hours, from&nbsp;the accident of a pot boiling over. It was reconstructed&nbsp;in less than a month, and the houses were far more numerous than before the accident. The great pagoda or golden&nbsp;temple is situated two and a half miles in the rear of Rangoon ; the road to it is through one of the northern gates,&nbsp;by a causeway across the fosse. The road then ascends between tw<sup>,</sup>o rows of smaller pagodas, until the eminence is&nbsp;reached upon which the temple is situated, occupying the&nbsp;highest of three platforms. The building is octagonal at&nbsp;the base and spiral at the top, and is estimated at 330 feet&nbsp;in height. It is highly gilt on the top, and is an umbrella of&nbsp;open iron work, surmounted by a vane, and a small globe&nbsp;of glass. Bells are hung round the lower part. There are&nbsp;no apertures in the building, which is solid throughout.&nbsp;It has small niches all around, that formerly contained&nbsp;images of marble and wood. But these were mostly removed&nbsp;by the English when they occupied the town during the&nbsp;Burmese war. The smaller pagodas were also mostly pillaged by the soldiery. On the southern side of the pagoda&nbsp;is a beautiful pavilion, gilt and painted, containing an image&nbsp;of Gaudma, of gigantic dimensions. The river Rangoon&nbsp;is extremely commodious for ship-building, which is carried&nbsp;on to a great extent. The spring-tides rise to the perpendicular height of twenty feet. The banks are soft, and so&nbsp;flat that there is need of little labour for the formation of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
