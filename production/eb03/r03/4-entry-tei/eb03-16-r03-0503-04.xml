                <p><label>ROTATION</label>, is a term which expreſſes the motion of the different
                    parts of a ſolid body round an axis, and diſtinct from the progreſſive motion
                    which ſt may . have in its revolution round a diſtant point. The earth has a
                    rotation round its axis, which produces the viciſ-ſitudes of day and night ;
                    while its revolution round the ſun, combined with the obliquity oſ the equator,
                    produces the varieties of ſummer and winter.</p>
                <p>The mechaniſm of this kind of motion, or the relation which ſubſiſts between the
                    intenſity of the moving forces, modified as it may be by the manner oſ
                    application, and the velocity of rotation, is highly intereſting, both to the
                    ſpeculative philoſopher and to the practical engineer. The preceſſion of the
                    equinoxes, and many other aſtronomical problems of great importance and
                    difficulty, receive their ſolutions from this quarter : and the <hi
                        rend="italic"> actual performance</hi> of our moſt valuable machines cannot
                    be aſcertained by the mere principles of equilibrium, but require a previous
                    acquaintance with certain general propoſitions of rotatory motion.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly with the view of aſſiſting the engineer that we propoſe to deliver
                    in this place a few fundamental propoſitions ; and we ſhall do it in as familiar
                    and popular a manner as poſſible, although this may cauſe the application of
                    them to the abſtruſe problems of aſtronomy to be greatly deficient in the
                    elegance of which they are ſuſceptible.</p>
                <p>When a ſolid body turns round an axis, retaining its ſhape and dimenſions, every
                    particle is actually deſcri-j bing a circle round this axis, and the axis paſſes
                    through the centre of the circle, and is perpendicular to its plane. Moreover,
                    in any inſtant of the motion, the particle is moving at right angles with the
                    radius vector, or line joining it with <hi rend="italic">its</hi> centre of
                    rotation. Therefore, in order to aſcertain the direction of the motion of any
                    particle P (fig. 1.), we may draw a ſtraight line PC from the particle
                    perpendicular to the axis AB of rotation. This line will lie in the plane of the
                    circle P<hi rend="italic">mn</hi> of rotation of the particle, and will be its
                    radius vector ; and a line PQ_drawn from the particle perpendicular to this
                    radius vector will be a tangent to the circle of rotation, and will have the
                    direction of the motion of this particle.</p>
                <p>The whole body being ſuppoſed to turn together, it is evident, that when it has
                    made a complete rotation, , each particle has deſcribed a circumference of a
                    circle, and the whole paths of the different particles will be in the ratio oſ
                    theſe circumferences, and therefore of their radii ; and this is true of any
                    portion of a whole turn, ſuch as 4» ⅛, or 20 degrees, or any arch whatever;
                    therefore the velocities of the different particles are proportional to their
                    radii vectores, or to their diſtances from the axis oſ rotation.</p>
                <p>And, laſtly, all theſe motions are in parallel planes, to which the axis of
                    rotation is perpendicular.</p>
                <p>When we compare the rotations of different bodies in reſpect of velocity, it is
                    plain that it cannot be done <hi rend="sub">t</hi> by directly comparing the
                    velocity of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> particle in &lt; one of the bodies
                    with that of <hi rend="italic">any</hi> particle of the other; <hi rend="sup">t</hi> ſor, as all the particles of each have different velocities, <hi
                        rend="sub"> 1</hi> this compariſon can eſtabliſh no ratio. But we fami-1
                    liarly compare ſuch motions by the number of complete &lt; turns which they
                    make in equal times, and we ſay that the ſecond hand of a dock turns 6o times
                    faſter than the minute hand ; now' this compariſon i⅛, equally juſt in any part
                    of a turn as in the whole. While the minute-hand moves round one degree, the
                    ſecond-hand moves 60 ; therefore, as the length or number of feet in the line
                    uniformly deſcribed by a body in its progreſſive motion is a proper meaſure of
                    its progreſſive velocity, ſo the number of degrees deſcribed by <hi
                        rend="italic"> any</hi> particle of a whirling body in the circumference of
                    its circle of rotation, or the angle deſcribed by <hi rend="italic">any</hi> radius vector of that bodv, is a proper meaſure of its velocity off rotation.
                    And in this manner may the rotation of two bodies be compared; and the velocity
                    is with propriety termed angular, velocity.</p>
                <p>An angle is directly as the length of the circumference on which it ſtands, and
                    inverſely as the radius of the circle, and may be expreffed by the fraction of
                    which the numerator is the arch, and the denominator the radius. Thus the angle
                    PC/ may be expreffed by P A</p>
                <p>This fraction expreſſes the portion of the radius which is equal to the arch
                    which meaſures the angle ; and it is converted into the uſual denomination of
                    degrees, by knowing that one degree, or the 360th part of the circumference, is
                    1/57,296 of the radius, or that an arch of 57,206 degrees is equal to the
                    radius.</p>
                <p>When a ſolid body receives an impulſe on any one point, or when that point is
                    anyhow urged by a moving force, it cannot move without the other points alſo
                    moving. And whatever is the motion of any particle, that particle muſt be
                    conceived as urged by a force preciſely competent to the production of that
                    motion, by acting' immediately on the particle itſelf. If this is not the
                    particle immediately acted on by the external foιce, the force which really
                    impels it is a force ariſing from the coheſion of the body. The particle
                    immediately impelled by the external force is preſſed towards its neighbouring
                    particles, or is drawn away from them ; and, by this change of place, the
                    connecting forces are brought into action, or are excited ; they act on the
                    particles adj lining, and change, or tend to change, their diſtances from the
                    particles immediately beyond them ; and thus the forces which connect this next
                    ſe-ries of particles are alſo excited, and another ſeries of particles are made
                    to exert their forces ; and this goes on through the body till we come to the
                    remote particle, whoſe motion we are conſidering. The forces which connect it
                    with the adjoining ſeries of particles are excited, and the particle is moved.
                    We frequently ſay that the external moving force is propagated thro <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> the body to the diſtant particle ; but this is not
                    accurate. The particle is really and immediately movedby the forces which
                    connect it with thoſe adjoining. It</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0504" facs="gri_33125011196389_0510.tif"/>
                <p>will greatly 'aſſiſt our conception o'f the manner in which motion is thus
                    produced in a diſtant particle, if we conſider the particles as ſo many little
                    balls, connected with each other by ſlender ſpiral ſprings like cork-ſcrews.
                    This would compoſe a maſs which would be compreſ-ſible, or which could be
                    ſtretched, &amp;c. And if we give an impulſe to one of theſe balls, we ſhall
                    ſet the whole aſſemblage in motion round any axis which we may ſuppoſe to
                    ſupport it. Now any one of theſe balls is really and immediately moved by the
                    elaſticity of the ſpiral wares which join it to its neighbours.</p>
                <p>We are but little acquainted with the nature of theſe connecting forces. It can
                    be learned only by the phenomena which arc their effects. Theſe are various,
                    almoſt beyond defoliation ; but the mechanical philoſo-pher has little to do
                    wfith this variety. '1 he diſtinctionS which are the immediate cauſes of
                    fluidity, of hardneſs, ſoftneſs, elaſticity, ductility, are not of very
                    difficult conception. There is one general fact which is ſuſſicient for our
                    preſent purpoſe - the forces by which the particles of bodies act on each other
                    are equal. This is a matter of unexcepted experience ; and no other foundation
                    can be given to it as a law of mechanical nature.</p>
                <p>An immediate conſequence of this law is, that when two external forces A and B
                    are in equilibrium by the intervention of a folid body (or rather w <hi
                        rend="sup"> r</hi> hen a ſolidbody fis in equilibrium betw <hi rend="sup">r</hi> een tw <hi rend="sup">r</hi> o external forces), theſe forces are
                    equal and oppoſite ; for the force A is in factin immediate equilibrium wfith
                    the oppoſite forces exerted by the particle to which it is applied, and is
                    therefore equal and oppoſite to the force reſulting from the combination of all
                    the forces which connect that particle with the ſeries of particles immediately
                    adjoining. This reſulting force may with propriety be called tfie equivalent of
                    the forces from the combination of which it reſults. The uſe of this term will
                    greatly abbreviate language. This firſt ſet of connecting forces conſiſts of a
                    number of diſtinct forces correſponding to each particle of the ſeries, and each
                    force has an equal and oppoſite force correſponding to it : therefore the
                    compound force by which the firſt ſeries of particles acts on that to which the
                    external force A is applied, is equal and oppoſite to the compound force which
                    connects this ſirſt ſeries with the next ſeries. And the ſame thing muſt be ſaid
                    of each ſucceeding ſeries of particles, till w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> e come at
                    laſt to the particle to which the external force B is immediately applied. The
                    force exerted by this particle is equal and oppoſite to that external force ;
                    and it is equal to the compound force exerted by the ſecond ſeries of particles
                    on that fide ; therefore the forces A and B are equal and oppoſite.</p>
                <p>It reſults ſrom this propoſition, that <hi rend="italic">when any number of
                        external forces are applied to a folid body, and it is in equilibrio between
                        them, they are ſuch as would be in equilibrio iſ they were all applied to
                        one point.</hi> Let the forces «A, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> B, cC (ſig.
                    2.), be applied to three particles of the folid body. Therefore <hi
                        rend="italic"> a</hi> A is immediately in ■equilibrium with an equal and
                    oppoſite force A a, reſulting from the compoſition of the force AD, which
                    connects the particles A and B, and the force AE ■which connects A wfith C. In
                    like manner <hi rend="italic">b</hi> B is immediately in equilibrio wfith B <hi rend="italic">ß,</hi> the equivalent of the forces BF and BG j and c C
                    is in immediate equilibrio</p>
                <p>with the equivalent C χ of the forces CH and CI. We ſhall conceive it very
                    clearly if we ſuppoſe the three forces A <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> B <hi
                        rend="italic"> b,</hi> C <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> to be exerted by means
                    of threads pulling at the folid body. The connecting parts be* tween A and B, as
                    alſo between A and C, are ſtretched. The lines AB and AC may be conſidered as
                    elaſtic threads. Each thread is equally ſtretched through its wfiιole length ;
                    and therefore if we take AD to repreſent the force wfith which the particle A is
                    held back by the particle B, and if we would alſo repreſent the force with
                    which B is held back by A, we muſt make BF equal to AD. Now (n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 9.) the forces AD and BF are equal and oppoſite ; ſo are the forces
                    AE and CI ; ſo are the forces CH and BG. Now it is evident, that if the ſix
                    forces AD, BF, BG, CH, CI, AE, were applied to one particle, the particle would
                    be iri equilibrio; for each force is accompanied by an equal and oppoſite force
                    : and iſ the force A «■ were applied in place of AD, AE, the equilibrium w <hi
                        rend="sup"> r</hi> ould remain, becauſe A≈ is equivalent to AD and AE. The
                    ſame is true of B <hi rend="italic">ß</hi> and C χ. Therefore if the three
                    forces A «, B <hi rend="italic">ß,</hi> C <hi rend="sup">,</hi> , were
                    applied to one point, they would be in equilibrio. Conſequently if the three
                    forces a A, <hi rend="italic">b</hi> B, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> C, which
                    are reſpectively equal and oppoſite to A ≈, B <hi rend="italic">ß, C</hi> <hi rend="sup">x</hi> -, are ſo applied, they will be in equilibrio. It is
                    plain that this demonſtration may be extended to any number of forces.</p>
                <p>We may juſt remark by the bye, that if three forces are thus in equilibrio, they
                    are acting in one plane ; and, if they are not parallel, they are really
                    directed to one point : for any one of them muſt be equal and oppoſite to the
                    equivalent of the other two ; and this equivalent is the diagonal of a
                    parallelogram, of which the other two are the ſides, and the diagonal and ſides
                    of any parallelogram are in one plane -; and ſince they are in one plane, anti
                    any one of them is in equilibrio wfith the equivalent of the other two, it muſt
                    paſs thro’ the ſame point wfith that equivalent, that is, through the point of
                    concourſe of the other two. -</p>
                <p>Theſe very limple propoſitions are the foundation of the whole theory of
                    ſtatics, and render it a very ſimple branch of mechanical ſcience. It has been
                    made ab-ſtruſe by our very attempts to Amplify it. Many elaborate treatiſes have
                    been written on the fundamental property of the lever, and in them all it has
                    been thought next to an inſuperable difficulty to clemonſtrate the equilibrium
                    of a ſtraight lever when the parallel forces are inverſely as their diſtances
                    from the fulcrum.</p>
                <p>We think the demonſtrations of Archimedes, Fonſe-nex, D’Alembert, and Hamilton,
                    extremely ingenious; but they only bring the mind into ſuch a ſtate of
                    conception that it cannot refuſe the truth of the propoſition ; and, except Mr
                    Hamilton’s, they labour under the diſadvantage of being applicable only to
                    commen-ſurable tliſtances anti forces. Mr Vince’s, in the Philoſophical
                    Tranſactions for 1794, is the moſt ingenious of them all ; and it is wmnderful
                    that it has not occurred long ago. The difficulty in them all has ariſen from
                    the attempt to ſimplify the matter by conſidering ∙a lever as an inflexible
                    ſtraight line. Had it been taken out of this abſtract form, and conſidered as
                    what it really is, a natural body, of ſome ſize, having its particles connected
                    by equal and oppoſite forces, all diſſiculty would have vaniſhed.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0505" facs="gri_33125011196389_0511.tif"/>
                <p>That we may apply theſe proportions to explain the motion of rotation, we muſt
                    recollect an unqueſtionable propoſition in dynamics, that the force which
                    produces any motion is equal and oppoſite to the force which would prevent it,
                    when applied in the fame place and in the fame line, or which would extinguiſh
                    it in the fame time in which we ſuppoſe it to be produced. Therefore the force
                    which is excited and made to act on any particle of a body, by the action of an
                    external force on another particle, ſo as to cauſe it to move round an axis, is
                    equal and oppoſite to the force which, when applied to that particle in the
                    oppoſite direction, would be in equilibrio with the external force.</p>
                <p>The only diſtinct notion we can form of the magnitude of any moving force is the
                    quantity of motion which it can produce by acting uniformly during ſome given
                    time. This will be had by knowing the velocity which it will produce in a body
                    of known bulk. Thus we know that the weight of ten pounds of matter acting on it
                    for a ſecond will cauſe it to fall 16 feet with an uniformly accelerated motion,
                    and will leave it in a ſtate ſuch that it wotſld move on for ever at the rate of
                    32 feet in a ſecond ; which we call communicating the velocity of 3 2 feet per
                    ſecond. In the ſame manner, the belt way of acquiring a diſtinct conception of
                    the rotatory effort of a moving force, is to determine the quantity of rotatory
                    motion which it can produce by acting uniformly during ſome known time.</p>
                <p>Let a ſolid body turn round an axis palling through the point C (fig. 3.)
                    perpendicular to the plane of this figure. Let this rotation be ſuppoſed to be
                    produced by an external force acting in the direction FP. Let this force be
                    ſuch, that if the body were free, that is, unconnected with any axis ſupported
                    by fixed points, it would, by acting uniformly during a ſmall moment of time,
                    cauſe its centre of gravity G<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            may be ſuppoſed united. It is by no means (though commonly ſuppoſed) the
                            point where the equivalent of the real gravitations of the particles may
                            be ſuppoſed to act, and to produce the ſame motion as when acting on
                            each particle ſeparately. It is this point only when all the particles
                            gravitate alike, and in parallel directions. If the body were near the
                            centre of the earth for inſtance, the gravitations of the different
                            particles would neither be nearly equal nor in parallel lines ; and the

                            whole gravitation may be ſuppoſed to act, would be very different from
                            G. Were we to denominate the point G, as uſually determined, by its
                            mathematical properties, we would call it the centre of position ;
                            becauſe its diſtance from any plane, or its poſition with reſpect to any
                            plane, is the average diſtance and poſition of all the particles. The
                            true deſignation of G is “ the point through which if <hi rend="italic">any plane whatever</hi> be made to paſs, and if perpendiculars to

                        <p>It we were to denominate G by its mechanical properties, we would call
                            it the centre of inertia ; for this is equal in every particle, and in
                            the ſame direction : and it is not in conſequence of gravity, but of
                            inertia, that the body deſcribes with the point G a line parallel to FP.

                    chance to move differently, if the body, befides its progreſſive motion, has
                    alſo a motion of rotation, as is generally the cafe. Draw GI parallel to FP, and
                    make GI to GC as the velocity which the external force would communicate to the
                    centre of the body (if moving freely, unconnected with a ſupported axis), to the

                <p>But ſince the body cannot move any way but round the axis paſſing through C, the
                    centre G will begin to move with the velocity, and in the direction, GH
                    perpendicular to the line CG (n <hi rend="sup">o</hi> 2.) And any particle A
                    can only move in the direction AL, perpendicular to CA. Moreover, the velocities
                    of the different particles are as their radii vectores ; and CG is actually
                    equal to the line GH, which expreſſes the velocity of a particle in G. Therefore
                    CA will in like manner expreſs the velocity of the particle A. If A expreſs its

                <p>Suppoſe the external force to act immediately on the external particle F. The
                    line FC connecting this particle with the axis in C is either ſtretched or
                    compreſſed by the effort of giving motion to a remote particle A. It is plain
                    that, in the circumſlances rtpreſented in the figure, the line FC is compreſſed,
                    and the axis is puſhed by it againſt its ſupports in the direction C <hi
                        rend="sup"> z</hi> ; and the body muff, on this account, reſiſt in the
                    oppoſite direction F∕. The particle A is dragged out of its poſition, and made
                    to begin its motion in the direction AL perpendicular to AC. This cannot be,
                    unleſs by the connection of the two lines AC, AF. A refills by its inertia, and
                    therefore both AC and AF are ſtretched by dragging it into motion. By this
                    reſiſtance the line AC tends to contract itſelf again, and it pulls C in the
                    direction Cr, and A in the direction A <hi rend="italic">a ;</hi> and if we
                    take Cc to repreſent the action on C, A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> muſt be taken
                    equal to it. In like manner AF is ſtretched and tends to contract, pulling F in
                    the direction Fø and A in the direction A « with equal forces. Thus the particle
                    A is pulled in the directions Aa and A <hi rend="sup">α</hi> ; the particle F
                    is pulled in the direction Fø,and puſhed in the direction F <hi rend="italic">ſ;</hi> and C is pulled in the direction C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> , and
                    puſhed in the direction C×. A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and A <hi rend="sup">α</hi> have produced their equivalent AL, by which A is dragged into motion ; F <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and Fø produce their equivalent F <hi

                    mechaniſm of rotatory motions. And the intelligent reader will ob-ſerve, that
                    this other demonſtration is nothing but the demonſtration by the lever expanded

                    particles, we ſhall not again have recourſe to it.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the ſum of all the forces <hi rend="italic">g</hi> F, or <hi rend="italic">m.</hi> G <hi rend="italic">i</hi> muſt be equal to

                <p>As m the communication of motion to bodies in free ſpace a given force always

                    from the axes, always produces the ſame quantity of momentum. Whence it χnay
                    eaſily be deduced (and we ſhall do it afterwards), that as in the communication
                    of motion among free bodies the ſame ■quantity of motion is preſerved, ſo in the
                    communication of motion among whirling bodies the ſame quan-tity oſ whirling
                    motion is preſerved.</p>
                <p>This is a propoſition of the utmoſt importance in practical mechanics, and may
                    indeed be conſidered as the fundamental propoſition with reſpect to all machines
                    of the rotatory kind when performing work ; that is, of all machines which
                    derive their efficacy from levers or wheels. There is a valuable ſet of
                    experiments by Mr Smeaton in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, Volume LXVI. which
                    fully confirm it. We ſhall give an example by and by of the utility of the
                    propoſition, ſhowing how exceedingly imperfect the uſual theories of mechanics
                    are which do not proceed on this principle.</p>
                <p>With reſpect to the general propoſition ſrom which all theſe deductions have
                    been made, we muſt obſerve, that the demonſtration is not reſtricted to the time
                    neceſſary for cauſing each particle to deſcribe an arch equal to the radius
                    vector. We aſſumed the radius vector as the meaſure of the velocity merely to
                    ſimpliſy the notation. Both the progreſſive motion of the free body and the
                    rotation of the whirling body are uniformly accelerated, when we ſuppoſe the
                    external force to act uniformly during any time whatever ; and the ſpaces
                    deſcri-bed by each motion in the ſame time are in a confiant ratio. The formulæ
                    may therefore with equal propriety repreſent the momentary accelerations in the
                    different caſes.</p>
                <p>It muſt alſo be obſerved, that it is not neceſſary to ſuppoie that all the
                    particles of the body are in one plane, and that the moving force acts in a line
                    FP lying alſo in this plane. This was tacitly allowed, merely to make the
                    preſent inveſtigation (which is addreſſed chiefly to the practical mechanic)
                    more familiar and eaſy. The equilibrium between the force A × CA, which is
                    immediately urging the particle A, and the force <hi rend="italic">rn.G i</hi> employed at P or F, in order to excite that force at A, would have been
                    preciſely the ſame although the lines AC and FP had been in different planes,
                    provided only that theſe planes were parallel. This is known ςo every perſon in
                    the leaſt acquainted with the wheel and axle. But iſ the external moving force
                    does not act in a plane parallel to the circles of rotation of the different
                    particles, it muſt bç reſolved into two forces, one of which is perpendicular to
                    theſe planes, or parallel to the axis of rotation, and the other lying in a
                    plane of rotation. And it is this laſt only that we conſider as the moving
                    force; the other tends merely to puſh the body in the direction of its axis, but
                    has no tendency to turn it round that axis. When we come to conſider the
                    rotation of a body perf ectly free, it will be neceſſary to attend particularly
                    to this circumſtance. But there are ſeveral important mechanical propoſit.ons
                    which do not require this.</p>
                <p>The motion of any body is eſtimated by that of its centre of gravity, as is well
                    known. '1 he difference between the motion of the centre of ,a free body and the
                    motion of the centre of a body turning round an axis, is evidently owing to the
                    connection which the parts of the body have with this axis, and to the action of
                    the points of ſupport on this axis. This action muſt be conſidered as another <hi rend="italic">externat</hi> force, combined with that which acts on
                    the particle P, and therefore muſt be ſuch as, if combined with it, would
                    produce the very motion which we obſerve. That is, if</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0508" facs="gri_33125011196389_0514.tif"/>
                <p>we ſuppoſe the body unconnected with any fixed points, but as having its axis
                    acted on by the ſeme forces which theſe points exert, the body would turn as we
                    obſerve it to do, the axis remaining at reſt.</p>
                <p>Therefore join I and Iff, and complete the parallelogram GIHK∙ It is plain that <hi rend="italic">m .</hi> GK muſt repreſent the forces exerted by the
                    axis on the fixed points.</p>
                <p>If therefore GI ſhould coincide with GH, and the point I with the point H, the
                    force GK vaniſhe«, and the body <hi rend="italic">begins</hi> to turn round C,
                    without exerting any preſſure on the points of ſupport ; and the initial motion
                    is the ſame as if the body were free. Or, the axis at C is then a <hi
                        rend="italic"> ſpontaneous</hi> axis of converfion.</p>
                <p>That this may be the caſe, it is neceſſary, in the firſt place, that the
                    external force act in a direction perpendicular to C G ; for G I is always
                    parallel to FP : it being a leading propofition in dynamics, that when a moving
                    force acts on any part whatever ol a ſolid body, unconnected with fixed points,
                    the centre of gravity will proceed in a ſtraight line parallel to the direction
                    of that force. In the next place GH . . <hi rend="sub">o</hi> ^.G1.CP.GG</p>

                <p>It would be a defirable thing in our machines which derive their efficacy from a
                    rotatory motion, to apply the preſſures arifing from the power and from the
                    reiiſt-ance oppoſed by the work in ſuch a manner as to annihilate of diminiſh
                    this preflure on the ſupport?. of the axis of motion. Attention to this theorem
                    will point 'out what may be done ; and it is at all times proper, nay neceſſary,
                    to know what are the preſſures in the points of ſupport. If we are ignorant of
                    this, we ſhall run the riſk of our machine failing in thoſe parts; and our
                    anxiety to prevent this will make υs load it with needleſs and ill-diſpoſed
                    ſtrength. In the ordinary theories of machines, deduced entirely from the
                    principles of equilibrium, the preſſure on the points of ſupport (exclufive of
                    what proceeds from the weight of the machine itſelf) is ſtated as the ſanae as
                    if the moving and refitting forces were applied immediately to theſe points in
                    their own directions. But this is in all caſes erroneous; and, in caſes of ſwift
                    motions, it is greatly ſo. We may be convinced of this by a very fimple
                    inſtance.</p>
                <p>Suppoſe a line laid over a pulley, and a pound weight at one end of it, and ten
                    pounds at the 0ther5 the preſſure of the axis 011 its ſupport is eleven pounds,
                    ac-ct rding to the uſual rule ; whereas we ſhall find it only 3 <hi rend="sub">τ</hi> <hi rend="sup">7</hi> y. For, if we call the radius of the pulley 1, the

                <p>Since all our machines conſiſt of inert matter, which <hi rend="sup">1</hi> requires force to put it in motion, or to ſtop it, or to ' change its motion, it
                    is plain that ſome of our natural ‘ power is expended in producing this effect ;

                    its gravity, where, if all its weight be ſuppoſed to be concentrated, it will
                    perform its oſcillations in the ſame time. For while the body has its natural
                    form, the whole force of gravity may be fuppoſed to be exerted on its centre of
                    gravity. When the matter of the body is collected at O, the force of gravity is
                    concentrated there alſo ; and if CG have the ſame inclination to the horizon in.
                    the firſt caſe that CO has in the ſecond, the action of gravity will be applied
                    in the ſame angle of inclination, and the two bodies will acquire the fame
                    angular velocity ; that is, they will deſcend from this ſituation to the

                <p>We ſee alſo that the diſtance CO is that at which an external force muſt be
                    applied ; ſo that there may not be any preſſure excited in the axis upon its
                    points of ſupport, and the axis may be a ſpontaneous axis of converſion. This we
                    learn, by comparing the value of CO with that oſ'CP in art. 30. This being the
                    caſe, it follows, that if an external force is applied in a direction paſſing
                    thro’ O, perpendicularly to CO, it will produce the ſame initial velocity of the
                    centre as if the body were free : for as it exerts no preſſure on the points of
                    ſupport, the initial motion muſt be the ſame as if they were not there.</p>
                <p>If the external force be applied at a greater diſtance in the line CG, the
                    velocity of the centre will be greater than if the body were free. In this caſe
                    the preſ-fure excited in the axis will be backward, and conſequently the points
                    of ſupport will re-act forward, and this re-action will be equivalent to another
                    external force conſpiring with the one applied at O. Some curious conſequences
                    may be deduced from this.</p>
                <p>If the external force be applied to a point in the line GC, lying beyond C, the
                    motion of the centre will be in the oppoſite direction to what it would have
                    taken had the body been free, and ſo will be the preſ-ſures exerted by the
                    points of ſupport on the axis.</p>
                <p>A force w.GI applied at P produces the initial pro- <hi rend="sup">;</hi> greſſive motion rc.GH ; and <hi rend="italic">any</hi> force applied at O,
                    perpendicularly to CG, produces the ſame motion of the centre as if the body
                    were free. Therefore a force m.GH applied thus at O will produce a motion w.GIT
                    in the centre, and therefore the ſame motion which τw.Gl applied at P would
                    produce ; and it will produce the momentum wz.GI at P. Therefore if a force
                    equal to the progreſſive motion of the body be applied at O, perpendicularly to
                    CO, in the oppoſite direction, ft wfill ſtop all this motion wfithout exciting
                    any ſtrain on the axis or points of ſuppoit. Therefore the equivalent of all the
                    motions of each particle round C is conceived as paſſing through O in a
                    direction perpendicular to CO ; and the blow given by that point to any body
                    oppoſed to its motion is conſidered as equal to the compounded effect of the
                    rotatory motion, or to the progreſſive motion of the body combined with its
                    rotation.</p>
                <p>For ſuch reafons O has been called the Centre of Percussion of the body turning
                    round C. But the name of <hi rend="italic">centre of momentum,</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic"> rotatory effort,</hi> would have been more proper.</p>
                <p>We can feel this property of the point O when we give a ſmart blow with a flick.
                    If we give it a motion round the joint of the wriſt only, and ſtrike ſmart-ly
                    with a point conſiderably nearer or more remote than τ of its length, we feel a
                    painful ſhock or wrench in the hand ; but if we ſtrike with that point which is
                    preciſely at y of its length, we feel no ſuch diſagreeable ſtrain.</p>
                <p>Mechanical writers frequently ſay, that O conſidered as the centre of
                    percuſſion, is that with which the moſt violent blow is ſtruck. But this is by
                    no means true; O is that point of a body turning round C which gives a blow
                    preciſely equal to the progreſſive motion of the body, and in the ſame
                    direction. As we have already ſaid, it is the point where we may ſuppoſe the
                    whole rotatory momentum of the body accumulated. Every particle of the body is
                    moving in a particular direction, with a velocity proportional to its diſtance
                    from the axis of rotation ; and iſ the body were ſtopped in any point, each
                    particle tending to continue its motion endeavours to drag the reſt along with
                    it. Whatever point we call the centre of percuſſion ſhould have this property,
                    that when it is ſtopped by a ſuſſicient force, the whole motion and tendency to
                    motion of every kind ſhould be ſtopped ; ſo that if at that inſtant the ſupports
                    of the axis were annihilated, the body would remain in abſolute reſt.</p>
                <p>The conſideration of a veιy ſimple caſe will ſhow that this point of ſtoppage
                    cannot be taken indifferently. Suppoſe a ſquare or rectangular board CDD'C',
                    fig. 4. advancing in jthe direction GH, perpendicular to its plane, without any
                    rotation. Let G be the centre of gravity, and the middle of the board. It is
                    evident, that if a force be applied at G, in the direction HG,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0511" facs="gri_33125011196389_0517.tif"/>
                <p>and equal to the quantity of motion oſ the board, all motion will be ſtopped :
                    for when the point G is ſtopped, no- reaſon can be aſſigned why one part of the
                    board ſhall advance more than another. The ſame thing muſt happen if the board
                    be ſtopped by a ſtraight edge put in its way, and paſſing through G : for
                    example, in the line LGM, or y G <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> But if this edge be
                    ſo placed that the board ſhall meet it with the line IPK, then, becauſe this
                    line does not divide it equally, and becauſe there is a greater quantity of
                    motion in the part CIKC' than in the part IDD K, though the progreſſive motion
                    may be ſtopped, the upper part will advance, and a motion of rotation will
                    commence, of which IK will be the axis. Now ſuppoſe that the board, inſtead of
                    having been moving along in the direction GH, every part with the ſame velocity
                    had been fwinging round the axis CC' like a pendulum, from the poſition C <hi
                        rend="italic"> d d'</hi> C', and that it is ſtopped by a ſtraight edge
                    meeting it in the line LGM parallel to CO', in the moment that it has attained
                    the vertical poſition CDD'C' ; all its motion will not be ſtopped : for,
                    although LGM divides the board equally, there is more motion in the lower part
                    LDD <hi rend="sup">,</hi> M than in the upper part CLMC', becauſe every
                    particle of the lower part iβ deſeribing larger circles and moving ſwifter.
                    Therefore when the line LGM is ſtopped, there will be a <hi rend="italic">tendency</hi> of the lower part to advance, and the pivots C and C' of the
                    axis will be preſſed backwards on their holes ; and if the holes were at that
                    inſtant removed, a rotation would commence, of which LM is the axis. The board
                    muſt therefore be ſtopped in ſome line IPK below LGM, and ſo ſituated, that the
                    ſum of all the momenta on each ſide oſ it ſhall be equal. This alone can hinder
                    a rotation round the axis IPK. From what has been already demonſtrated, it
                    appears, that this will be prevented if the edge meets the board in aline ΓPK
                    paſſing through O the centre of oſcillation, which is ſituated in the line <hi
                        rend="italic"> gGh</hi> paſſing through the centre of gravity perpendicular
                    to the axis CC'. This line 10 K may therefore be called the <hi rend="italic">line</hi> or <hi rend="italic">axis</hi> of percuſſion.</p>
                <p>But any point of this line will not do. It is evident that if the board
                    ∏toulc⅛meet the fixed edge in the line <hi rend="italic">g</hi> GO <hi
                        rend="italic"> h,</hi> all motion will be ſtopped, for the motions on each
                    ſide arc equal, and neither can prevail. But if it be ſtopped in the line
                    ∕&gt; P <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> there is more motion in the part <hi
                        rend="italic"> p q</hi> DC' than in the part <hi rend="italic">p q</hi> DC ; and if the ſupports at C and C' were that inſtant taken away, there would
                    commence a rotation round the axis <hi rend="italic">p q.</hi> Con-ſequently,
                    if the body were not ſtopped by an edge, but by a ſimple point at P, this
                    rotation would take place. The motions above and below P would indeed balance
                    each other, but the motions on the· right and left lides of it would not.
                    Therefore it is not enough for determining the centre of percuſſion that we have
                    aſcertained its diſtance <hi rend="italic">g</hi> 0 from the axis of rotation
                    by</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ſp r * ,</hi></p>
                <p>the equation <hi rend="italic">g</hi> 0 = <hi rend="italic">f <hi rend="sub">v</hi> ~"fyp</hi> This equation only gives</p>
                <p>us the line IOK parallel to CC', but not the point of percuſſion. This point
                    (ſuppoſe it P) muſt be ſuch that if any line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> P <hi
                        rend="italic"> q</hi> be drawn through it, and conſidered as an axis round
                    which a rotation <hi rend="italic">may</hi> commence, it <hi rend="italic">ſhall not</hi> commence, becauſe the ſum of all the momenta round this axis
                    on the right ſide is equal to the</p>
                <p>ſum of the momenta on the left. Let us inveſtigate in what manner this condition
                    may be ſecured.</p>
                <p>Let there be a body in a ſtate of rotation round the axis D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> (ſig. 5.), and let G be its centre of gravity, and CGO a line through the
                    centre of gravity perpendicular to the axis DC <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> At
                    the moment under conſideration, the centre of gravity is moving in the direction
                    GH, perpendicular to the radius vector GC, as alſo perpendicular to a plane
                    paſſing through the lines D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> and CG. Let O be the
                    centre of oſcillation, Draw the line <hi rend="italic">n</hi> O parallel to D <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> The centre oſ percuſſion muſt be ſomewhere in
                    this line. For the point of percuſſion, wherever it is, muſt be moving in the
                    ſame direction with the progreſſive motion of the body, that is, in a direction
                    parallel to GH, that is, perpendicular to the plane DCG. And its diſtance from
                    the axis D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> muſt be the ſame with that of the centre
                    of oſcillation. Theſe conditions require it therefore to be in ſome point oſ <hi
                        rend="italic"> η</hi> 0. Suppoſe it at P. Draw P <hi rend="italic">p</hi> perpendicular to D <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> P muſt be ſo ſituated, that all
                    the momenta tending to produce a rotation round the line <hi rend="italic">p</hi> P may balance each other, or their ſum total be nothing.</p>
                <p>Now let A be any particle of the body which is out of the plane DCG, in which
                    lie all the lines CGO, <hi rend="italic">ρP, n</hi> OP, See. Draw its radius
                    vector A <hi rend="italic">β</hi> perpendicular to D <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and draw <hi rend="italic">a n</hi> parallel to CG, and therefore
                    perpendicular to D <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> The plane A <hi rend="italic">a
                        n</hi> is perpendicular to the plane <hi rend="italic">Dan</hi> (Euclid,
                    XI. 4). Draw AL perpendicular to A <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and AZ
                    perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">a n.</hi> Then, while the body is beginning
                    to turn round D <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> the incipient motion of the particle
                    A is in the direction AL, perpendicular to its radius vector A <hi rend="italic"
                        > α.</hi> This motion AL may be conſidered as compounded of the motion A Z,
                    perpendicular to the plane DCG, and the motion Z L in this plane. It is evident
                    that it is AZ only which is oppoſed by the external force Hopping the body at P,
                    becauſe A ∕ alone makes any part of the progreſſive motion of the centre of
                    gravity in the direction GH,</p>
                <p>We have hitherto taken the <hi rend="italic">radii vefiοres</hi> for the
                    meaſures of the velocities or motions of the particles. Therefore the quantity
                    of motion or the moving force of A is A. An, and this is exerted in the
                    direction AL, and may be conceived as exerted on any point in this line, and
                    therefore on the point L- That is, the point L might be conſidered as urged in
                    this direction with the force A.A <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> or with the two
                    forces of which the force A. A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is compounded. The
                    force in the direction AL is to the force in the direction AZ as AL to A Z, or
                    as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> A to <hi rend="italic">a l,</hi> becauſe the
                    triangles A <hi rend="italic">l</hi> L and <hi rend="italic">a l</hi> A are
                    ſimilar. Therefore, inſtead of ſuppoſing the point L urged, by the force A.A <hi
                        rend="italic"> a,</hi> acting in the direction AL, we may ſuppoſe it
                    impelled by the force A.αZ, acting perpendicularly to the line A ∕, or to the
                    plane DCG, and by the force A.AZ acting in this plane, viz. in the direction L
                    n. This laſt force has nothing to do with the percuſſion at P. Therefore we need
                    conſider the point L as only impelled by the force A.A Z. The momentum of this
                    force, or its power to urge the plane DCG forward in the direction GH, by
                    turning it round D eZ, muſt be A.aZ. aL. (√V. <hi rend="italic">B,</hi> This

                    be produced, it is plain that the momentum of the ■point L to produce ſuch a
                    rotation will be A.&lt;j∕.Lhi. In like manner, its momentum for producing a
                    rotation round « P would be A.∣j∕.Lh. In general, Its momentum for producing
                    rotation round any axis is equal to the product ol the perpendicular force at L
                    (that is, <hi rend="italic">A.a l)</hi> and the diſtance of L from this axis.</p>
                <p>In order therefore that P may be the centre of percuſſion, the ſum of all the
                    forces <hi rend="italic">A.αllErn</hi> muſt be equal to nothing ; that is, the

                    A'.&lt;i AL' <hi rend="italic">m'</hi> on the other ſide. To expreſs this

                    percuſſion do not neceſſarily coincide, and the circumſtance which is neceſſary
                    for their coincidence, viz. that/A.A«. A « is equal to O. It is of importance to
                    keep this in mind.</p>
                <p>There occurs here another obſervation of great im-_ portance. Since every force
                    is balanced by an equal</p>
                <p>force acting in the oppoſite direction, and ſince all motion progreſſive and
                    rotatory is ſtopped by an external force applied at P in the direction
                    &lt;yP, it follows that, if the body were at reſt, and the ſame force be
                    applied there, it will ſet the body in rotation round the axis D7, in the
                    oppoſite direction, with the ſame angular velocity, and without any preſſure on
                    the pivots D and <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> For whatever motion of the particle
                    A, in the direction AL, was ſtopped by a part of the external force applied at
                    P, the ſame motion will be produced by it in the quieſcent particle A in the
                    oppoſite direction LA. And as the pivots D and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> had no
                    motion in the caſe of the body turning round them, they will acquire no motion,
                    or will have-no tendency to motion, or no preſſure will be exerted on them, in
                    the laſt caſe. Therefore when an external force is applied at P in a direction
                    perpendicular to the line P∕&gt;, the line D <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> will become a momentary ſpontaneous axis of converſion, and the incipient motion
                    of the body will per-ſectly reſemble the rotation of the ſame body round a fixed
                    axis Dr∕.</p>
                <p>There is another ſet of forces of which we have as yet taken no notice, viz.
                    that part of each force AL which is directed along the plane DCG, and is
                    repreſented by <hi rend="italic">l</hi> L when the whole force is repreſented
                    by AL, or by A∕ when the whole force is repreſented by <hi rend="italic">A a.</hi> Theſe forces being all in the plane DCG, and in the dilection CG or GC,
                    can have no effect on the rotation round any axis in that plane. But they tend,
                    ſeparately, to produce rotation round any axis paſſing through this plane
                    perpendicularly. And the momentum of A to produce a rotation round an axis
                    perpendicular to this plane, in O for iniiance, muſt evidently be <hi
                        rend="italic"> A.Al.n</hi> O, and round P it muſt be A.A ∕.nP, &amp;c.
                    We ſhall have occaſion to confider theſe afterwards.</p>
                <p>It is uſual in courſes of experimental philoſophy to illuſtrate the motions of
                    bodies on inclined planes and curved ſurfaces by experiments with balls rolling
                    down theſe ſurfaces. But the motions of ſuch rolling balls aie by no means juſt
                    repreſentations of the motions they repreſent. The ball not only goes down the
                    inclined plane by the action of gravity, but it alſo turns round an axis. Force
                    is neqeſſary for producing this rotation ; and as there is no other ſource but
                    the weight of the ball, part ot this weight is expended on the rotation, and the
                    remainder only accelerates it down the plane. The point of the ball which reſts
                    on the plane is hindered from Aiding down by friction ; and therefore the ball
                    tumbles, as it were, over this point of contact, and is inſtantly catched by
                    another point of contact, over which it tun.Wes in the ſame manner. A cylinder
                    rolls down in the very ſame way; and its motion is nearly the ſame as if a fine
                    thread had been lapped round it, and one end oſ it made faſt at the head of the
                    inclined plane. The cylinder rolls down by unwinding this thread.</p>
                <p>The mechaniſin of all ſuch motions (and ſome oſ them are important) may be
                    underſtood by conſidering them as follows : Let a body of any ſhape be connected
                    with a cylinder FCB (fig. 6.) whoſe axis paſſes through G the centre of gravity
                    of the body. Suppoſe that body ſuſpended from a fixed point A by a thread wound
                    round the cylinder. This body will de-Jcend by the action of gravity, and it
                    will alſo turn round, unwinding the thread. Draw the horizontal</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0513" facs="gri_33125011196389_0519.tif"/>
                <p>line OGC- ït will paſs through the point of conta -' C of the thread and
                    cylinder, and C is the point round which it <hi rend="italic">begins</hi> to
                    turn in deſcending. Let G be its centre of oſcillation correſponding to the
                    momentary centre oſ rotation C. It will begin to deſeend in the ſame manner as
                    jf all its matter were collected in O: for <hi rend="sup">-</hi> it may be
                    conſidered, in this inſtant, as a pendulum ſuſpended at C. But in this caſe O
                    will deſeend in the ſame manner as if the body were falling freely. Therefore
                    the velocity of G (that is, the velocity of de-ſcent) will be to the velocity
                    with which a heavy body would fall as CG to CO. Now ſince the points C, G, o,
                    are always in a horizontal line, and the radius CG is given'; as alſo CO (n <hi
                        rend="sup"> 0</hi> 48.) the velocity of a body falling· freely, and of the
                    body unwinding from this thread, will always be in the ſame proportion of CO to
                    CG, and ſo will the ſpaces deſeribed in any given time. And thus we can compare
                    their motions in every caſe when we know the place of the centre of oſcillation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cor</hi> I. The weight of the defeending body will be to the
                    tenſion of the thread as CO to GO : for the ten ſion of the thread is the
                    difference between the momentum of thé rolling body and that of the body falling
                    freely.</p>
                <p>Obſerve, that this proportion between the weight of the body and the tenſion of
                    the thread will be always the ſame; for it has been demonſtrated already, n <hi
                        rend="sup"> o</hi> 42. that if C be in the circumference of a circle whoſe
                    centre is G, O will be in the circumference of another circle round the ſame
                    centre, and therefore the ratio of CG to CO is conſtantl</p>
                <p>v <hi rend="italic">Cor.</hi> 2. If a circular body TCB roll down an inclined
                    plane by unfolding a thread, or by friction which prevents all Aiding, the ſpace
                    deſeribed will be to that which the body would deſcribe freely as CG to CO ; for
                    the tendency down the inclined plane is a determined proportion of the weight of
                    the body. The motion of rotation in theſe caſes, both progreſſive and whirling,
                    is uniformly accelerated.</p>
                <p>Something of the ſame kind obtains in common pendulous bodies. A ball hung by a
                    thread not only oſcillates, but alſo makes part of a rotation ; and for this
                    reaſon its oſcillations differ from thoſe of a heavy point hanging by the ſame
                    thread, and the centre of oſcillation is a little below the centre of the ball.
                    A ball hung by a thread, and oſeillating between cycloidal cheeks, does not
                    ofcillate like a body in a cycloid, becauſe its centre of oſcillation is
                    continually ſhiſting its place. Huyghens avoided this by ſuſpending his
                    pendulous body from two points, ſo that it did not change its attitude during
                    its oſcillation. If ourſpring-carriages w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ere hung in
                    this manner, having the four lower ſtaples to which the ſtraps are fixed as far
                    aſun-rier as the four upper ſtaples at the ends of the ſprings, the body of the
                    carriage would perform its oſcillations without kicking up and down in the
                    diſagreeable manner they now do, by which we are frequently in danger oſ
                    ſtriking the glaſſes with our heads. The ſwings would indeed be greater, but
                    incomparably eaſeer; and we could hold things almoſt as ſteadily in our hand as
                    if the carriage were not fwinging at all.</p>
                <p>This will ſuſſice for an account of the rotation round fixed axes, as the
                    foundation for a theory of machines actually performing work. The limits oſ our
                    under</p>
                <p>taking will not .allow us to do any more than juſt point out the method of
                    applying it.</p>
                <p>Let there be any machine of the rotatory kind, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> compoſed of levers or wheels, and let its conſtruction be ſuch, that the
                    velocity of the point to which the power is applied (which we ſhall call the <hi rend="italic">impelled point)</hi> is to the velocity of the working
                    point in the ratio of <hi rend="italic">vι</hi> to <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> It is well known that the energy of this machine will be the ſame with that of
                    an axis in peritrochio, of which the radii are <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n.</hi></p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">ρ</hi> expreſs the actual preſſure exerted on the
                    impelled point by the moving power, and let <hi rend="italic">r</hi> be the
                    actual preſſure or reſiſtance exerted on the working point by the work to be
                    performed. Let <hi rend="italic">χ</hi> be the inertia of the power, or the
                    quantity of dead matter which muſt move with the velocity of the impelled point
                    in order that the moving power may act. Thus the moving power may be <hi
                        rend="italic"> the weight</hi> of a bucket of water in a water-wheel ; then <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is the quantity of matter in this bucket of
                    water. Let <hi rend="italic">y</hi> in like manner be the inertia of the w <hi
                        rend="sup"> τ</hi> ork, or matter which muſt be moved with the velocity oſ
                    the working-point, in order that the work may be performed. Thus <hi
                        rend="italic"> y</hi> may be a quantity of water which muſt be continually
                    puſhed along a pipe. This is quite different from the weight of the water,
                    though it is proportional to it, and may be meafured by it.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> be a preſſure giving the ſame reſiſtance when
                    applied at the w'orking-point with the friction of the machine, and let <hi
                        rend="italic"> aη <hi rend="sup">i</hi></hi> be the momentum of the machine’s inertia, viz. the fame as if a proper
                    quantity of matter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> were attached to the
                    working-point, or to any point at the fame diſtance from the axis.</p>
                <p>This ſtate of things may- be repreſented by the wheel and axle PQS (ſig. 7.)
                    where <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and y and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are
                    repreſented by weights acting by lines. P is the impelled point, and R the
                    working-point; CP is <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and CR is«. 'Ihe moving force is
                    repreſented by PA, the reſiſtance by RB, and the friction by BF.</p>
                <p>It is evident that the momentum of the inertia of <hi rend="italic">x, y,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> are the ſame as if they were for -a moment
                    attached to the points P and R.</p>
                <p>Hence we derive the following expreſſions,</p>

                <p>work is proportional to the product of the reſiſtance and the. velocity with
                    which it is overcome.</p>
                <p>We ſhall give a very ſimple example of the utility of theſe formulæ. Let us
                    ſuppoſe that water is to be raiſed in a bucket by the deſeent of a weight, and
                    that the machine is a ſimple pulley. Such a machine is deſeribed by Deſaguliers
                    *, who ſays he found it preferable to all other machines. The bucket dipped
                    itſelf in the ciſtern. A chain from it went over a pulley,' and at its extremity
                    was a ſtage on which a man could ſtep from the head of a ſtair His preponderance
                    brought down the ſtage and raiſed the bucket, which diſcharged its water into
                    another ciſtern. The man quitted the ſtage, and walked up flairs, and there he
                    found</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0514" facs="gri_33125011196389_0520.tif"/>
                <p>it ready to receive him, becauſe the empty bucket is made heavier than the empty
                    ftage.</p>
                <p>Now, if there be no water in the bucket, it is evident, that although the motion
                    of the machine will be the quickeſt poſſible, there will be no work performed.
                    On the other hand, if the loaded ſtage and the full bucket are of equal weight,
                    which is the uſual ſtatc-rnent of ſuch a machine in elementary treatiſes of
                    mechanics, the machine will ſtand ſtill, and no work will be performed. In every
                    intermediate ſtate of things the machine will move, and work will be performed.
                    Therefore the different values of the work performed muſt be a ſeries of
                    quantities which increaſe from nothing to a certain magnitude, and then diminiſh
                    to nothing again. The maxim which is uſually received as a fundamental
                    propoſition in mechanics, viz. that what is gained in force by the intervention
                    of a machihe is loft in time, is therefore falſe. There muſt be a particular
                    proportion of the velocities of the impelled and working-points, which will give
                    the greateſt performance when the power and reſiſtance are given ; and there is
                    a certain proportion oſ the power and reſiſtance which will have the ſame effect
                    when thb ſtructure of the machine lias previouſly fixed the velocities of the
                    impelled and working points.</p>
                <p>This proportion will be found by treating the formula which expreſſes the work
                    as a fluxionaty quantity, and finding its maximum. Thus, when the ratio of the
                    power and reſiſtance is given, and we wiſh to know what muſt be the proportion
                    of the velocities <hi rend="sub">r</hi> ∏ and <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> that
                    we may conſtruct the machine accordingly, we have only to conſider <hi
                        rend="italic"> n</hi> as the variable quantity in the third formula. This
                    gives us √</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">½ct× r+ſ <hi rend="sup">1</hi> - <hi rend="sup">s</hi> Uρ <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ' <hi rend="sup">χ</hi></hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">&lt;j÷j∣</hi> — <hi rend="sup">κr</hi> +y∙</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">n — mX.---—cv=ez----—</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">pa-↑~y</hi></p>
                <p>This is a fundamental propoſition in the theory of working machines : but the
                    application requires much attention. Some natural powers are not accompanied by
                    any inertia worth minding; in which caſe <hi rend="italic">x</hi> may be
                    omitted. Some works, in like manner, are not accompanied by any inertia ; and
                    this is a very general caſe. In many caſes the work exerts no contrary ſtrain on
                    the machine at reſt, and r is nothing. In moſt inſtances the intenſity of the
                    power varies with the velocity of the impelled point, and is diminiſhed when
                    this increaſes; the reſiſtance or actual preſſure at the working-point
                    frequently increaſes with the velocity of the working-point. All theſe
                    circumſtances muſt be attended to ; but ſtill they only modify the general
                    propoſition. Theſe are matters which do not come within the limits of the
                    preſent article. We only took this opportunity of ſhowing how imperſect is the
                    theory of machines in equilibrio for giving us any knowledge of their
                    performance or juſt principles of their conſtruction.</p>
                <p>One thing, however, muſt be particularly attended to. in this theory. The forces
                    which are applied to the body moveable round an axis are conſidered in the <hi

                    points of the body or machine, as when a weight is appended to a lever or wheel
                    and axle, and, by deſeending uniformly, acts with its whole weight In this caſe
                    the ■weight multiplied by its diſtance from the axis will always expreſs its
                    momentum, and the rotation will <hi rend="italic">fa-tens paribus)</hi> be
                    proportional to this product. But in many important caſes our machines are
                    actuated by external impulſions. A body in motion ſtrikes on the impelled point
                    of the machine, and cauſes it to turn round its axis. It is natural for us to
                    conſider the quantity of motion of this impelling body as the meaſure of our
                    moving force. Suppoſing <hi rend="italic">n</hi> to be its quantity of matter,
                    and V its velocity, <hi rend="italic">η</hi> V appears a very proper meaſure
                    of its intenſity. And if it be applied at the diſtance CP from the axis of
                    rotation, nV*CP ſhould expreſs its energy, momentum, or power to turn the
                    machine round C ; and we ſhould expreſs the angular velocity by <hi rend="sup">n</hi> -^-— <hi rend="sub">j</hi> -. Accordingly, this is the</p>
                <p>manner in which calculations are uſually made for the conſtruction and
                    performance of the machine, as may be ſeen in almoſt every treatiſe oſ
                    mechanics.</p>
                <p>But nothing can be more erroneous, as we ſhall ſhow by a very ſimple inſtance.
                    It ſhould refuît from theſe principles that the angular velocity will be
                    proportional <hi rend="sup">1</hi> to CP. Let us ſuppoſe our moving power to
                    bea ſtream of water moving at the rate of ten feet per ſecond, and that every
                    ſecond there paſſes ιoo pounds of water. We ſhould then call our moving force
                    ιcoo, It is evident, that iſ we ſuppoſe the arm of the float-board on which it
                    ſtrikes to be infinitely long, the impelled point can never move faſter than ι o
                    ſeet in a ſecond, and this will make the angular velocity infinitely ſmall,
                    inſtead of being the greateſt of all. The rotation will therefore certainly be
                    greater if CP be ſhorter. We need not examine the caſe more minutely.</p>
                <p>We muſt therefore carefully diſtinguiſh between the quantity of motion of the
                    impelling body and its moſ ving power, as it is modified by its manner of
                    acting, <hi rend="sub">j</hi> The moving power is the <hi rend="italic">preſſure actually exerted</hi> on the impelled point of the machine. Now
                    the univerſal fact of the equality of action and reaction in the colliſion of
                    bodies aſſures us, that their mutual preſſure in their col-liſion is meaſured by
                    the <hi rend="italic">change</hi> of motion which each ſuſtains: for this
                    change of motion is the only indication and meaſure of the preſſure which we
                    ſuppoſe to be its cauſe. A way therefore of aſcertaining what is the real moving
                    force on a machine actuated by the iιn-pulſion of a moving body, is to diſeover
                    what quantity of motion is loſt by the body or gained by the machine; for theſe
                    are equal. Having diſcovered this, we may proceed according to the propoſitions
                    of rotatory mo,· tion.</p>
                <p>Therefore let AEF (fig. 8.) repreſent a body move-able round an axis paſſing
                    through C, perpendicular to the plane of the figure. Let this body be ſtruck in
                    the point A by a body moving in the direction FA, and. let BAD be a tangent, to
                    the two bodies in the point of colliſion. It is well known that the mutual
                    actions of two folid bodies are always exerted in a direction perpendicular to
                    the touching ſurfaces. Therefore the mutual preſſure oſ the two bodies is in the
                    direction AP perpendicular to AD. Thereſorc let the motion of the impelling body
                    be reſolved into the directions AP and AD. The force AD has <hi rend="sub">t</hi> no ſhare in the preſſure. Therefore letV be, the velocity of the impelling
                    body eſtimated in the direction AP, and let <hi rend="italic">n</hi> be its
                    quantity of matter. Its quantity of motion in the direction AP will be <hi
                        rend="italic"> η</hi> V.</p>
                <p>Did AP paſs through C, it is evident that the only</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0515" facs="gri_33125011196389_0521.tif"/>
                <p>effect would be to preſs the axis on its ſupports. But AP, the direction of the
                    preffure, being inclined to AC, the point A is forced aſide, and in ſome ſmall
                    moment of time deſcribes the little arch A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> round the
                    centre C. The point P will therefore deſcribe a ſmall arch P <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> ſubtending an angle PC∕&gt; = ACtf. Draw <hi rend="italic">a o</hi> perpendicular to AP, and <hi rend="italic">a d</hi> perpendicular to AD.
                    The triangles JAo, ACP are ſimilar, and A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> : Ao~ AC :
                    CP. But the angles AC <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> PC <hi rend="italic">p</hi> being equal, the arches are as their radii, and A <hi rend="italic">a : Pp</hi> = AC : CP, = A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> : A <hi rend="italic">o ;</hi> therefore <hi rend="italic">tp—</hi> A <hi rend="italic">o.</hi></p>
                <p>Now ſince, in conſequence of the impulſe, A deſcribes A a in the moment of time,
                    it is plain that A <hi rend="italic">o</hi> is the ſpace through which the
                    impelling body continues to advance in the direction oſ the preffure ; and if V
                    be taken equal to the ſpace which it deſeribed in an equal moment before the
                    ſtroke, <hi rend="italic">v</hi> will expreſs the remaining velocity, and V— <hi rend="italic">v</hi> is the velocity loſt, and ∏(V— <hi rend="italic">v)</hi> is the quantity of motion loſt by the impelling body, and is the
                    true meaſure oſ the preffure exerted. This gives us the whole circumſtances of
                    the rotatory motion. The angular velocity will be and the velocity</p>

                <p>What we have now delivered is ſufficient for explaining all the motions of
                    bodies turning round fixed axes ; and we preſume it to be agreeable to our
                    readers, that we have given the inveſtigation of the centres of gyration,
                    oſcillation, and percuſſion. Tlιe curious reader will find the application of
                    theſe theorems to the theory of machines in tw <hi rend="sup">,</hi> o very
                    valuable differtations by Mr Euler in the Memoirs of the Academy of Berlin, vols
                    viii. and x. and occafionally by other authors who have treated mechanics in a
                    ſcientific and uſeful manner, going beyond the ſchool-boy elements of
                    equilibrium.</p>
                <p>There remains a very important caſe of the rotation of bodies, w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ithout which the knowledge of the motion of ſolid bodies is
                    incomplete ; namely, the rotation of free bodies, that is, of bodies unconnected
                    w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ith any fixed points. We hardly ſee an inſtance of
                    motion of a</p>
                <p>free body without ſome rotation. A ſtone thrown from the hand, a ball from a
                    cannon, the planets themſelves, are obſerved not only to advance, but alſo to
                    whirl round. The famous problem of the preceſſion of the' equinoxes depends for
                    its ſolution on this doctrine ; and the theory of the working of ſhips has the
                    ſame foundation. We can only touch on the leading proportions.</p>
                <p>We need not begin by demonſtrating, that when the direction of the external
                    force paffes through the centre of the body, the body will advance without any
                    rotation. This we conſider as familiarly known to every perſon verſant in
                    mechanics ; nor is it neceffary to de-monſtrate, that when the direction of the
                    moving force does not paſs through the centre of gravity, this centre will ſtill
                    advance in a direction parallel to that of the moving force, and with the ſame
                    velocity as if the direction of the moving force had paffed through it. This is
                    the immediate conſequence of the equality of action and reaction obſerved in all
                    the mechanical phenomena of the univerſe.</p>
                <p>But it is incumbent on us to demonſtrate, that when the direction of the moving
                    force does not paſs thro’ the centre of gravity, the body will not only advance
                    in the direction of the moving force, but will alſo turn round an axis, and we
                    muſt determine the poſition of this axis·, and the relation ſubſiſting between
                    the progreſſive and rotatory motions.</p>
                <p>The celebrated John Bernoulli w’as the firſt who con-fιdered this ſubject ; and,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Diſqutſitionet Mechanico-dynamic#,</hi> he has
                    demonſtrated ſeveral propofitions concerning the ſpontaneous axis of converfion,
                    and the motions arifing from eccentric external forces : and although he affumed
                    for the leading principle a propoiition which is true only in a great number of
                    caſes, he has determined the rotation of ſpherical bodies with great accuracy.</p>
                <p>This combination of motions wall be palpable in ſome fimple caſes, ſuch as the
                    following : Let two equal bodies A and B (ſig. 9.) be connected by an inflexible
                    rod (of which,we may neglect the inertia for the preſent). Let G be the middle
                    point, and therefore the centre of gravity. Let an external force act on the
                    point P in the direction FP perpendicular to AB, and let AP be double of PB,
                    Alſo let the force be ſuch, that it would have cauſed the ſyſtem to have moved
                    from the fituation AB to the ſituation <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> in an
                    indefinitely ſmall moment of time, had it acted immediately on the centre G. G
                    would in this caſe have deſeribed Gy, A would have deſeribed A <hi rend="italic"
                        > a,</hi> and B would have deſeribed B <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic"> a b</hi> would have been parallel to AB : for the force
                    impreſſed on A would have been equal to the force impreſſed on B ; but becauſe
                    the force acts on P, the force imprfcſſed on A is but one half of that impreffed
                    on B by the property oſ the lever : therefore the initial motion or acceleration
                    of A will be only half of the initial motion of B ; yet the centre G muſt ſtill
                    be at <hi rend="sub">ι</hi> y. We ſhall therefore aſcertain the initial motion
                    of the ſyſtem, by drawing through <hi rend="italic">g</hi> a line <hi
                        rend="italic"> a g ß,</hi> ſo that A « ſhall be ⅛ of B <hi rend="italic">ß.</hi> This we ſhall do by making AC= AB, and drawing <hi rend="italic">C
                        &lt;*</hi> <hi rend="italic">g β.</hi> Then « <hi rend="italic">β</hi> will be the
                    poſition of the ſyſtem at the end of the moment of time. Thus we ſee that the
                    body muſt have a motion of rotation combined with its progreſſive motion,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0516" facs="gri_33125011196389_0522.tif"/>
                <p>And we deduce immediately ſrom the premiſes that this rotation is performed
                    round an axis paſſing through the centre of gravity G : for ſince the centre
                    deſcribes a ſtraight line, it is never either above or below the axis of
                    rotation, and is therefore always in it. This is a fundamental theorem, and our
                    ſubſequent inveſtigation is by this means greatly ſimplified, being thus reduced
                    to two problems : ι. To determine in what direction the axis paſſes through the
                    centre of gravity.</p>
                <p>2. To determine the angular velocity of the rotation, or how far the centre muſt
                    ’ advance while the body makes one turn round the axis. 'Γhis eſtabliſhes the
                    relation between the progreſſive and rotatory motions. It will contribute to our
                    better conception of both theſe problems to ſee the reſult iι⅛ the preſent
                    ſimple caſe.</p>
                <p>It is evident, in the firſt place, that the impreſſions made on A and B are in
                    lines A <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> parallel to FP
                    and G . ; and therefore the motions of the points A, G, and B, are made in one
                    plane, viz. the plane FPG. The axis of rotation therefore muſt be a line drawn
                    through G, perpendicular to this plane. If we give it any other poſition, one of
                    the points A, B, or both of them, muſt quit this plane.</p>
                <p>In the next place, in <hi rend="italic">bα</hi> produced take <hi
                        rend="italic"> bc~~P&gt;C.</hi> Then ſuppoſing AC to be a rigid line
                    connected with the ſy ſtem, it is evident that if there had been no rotation,
                    the line BC would have kept parallel to its firſt poſition, and that at the end
                    of the moment of time C would have been at <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> The point
                    C therefore has had, by the rotation, a backward motion <hi rend="italic">e</hi> C, relative to the centre G or y, and this motion is equal to the
                    progreſſive motion Gy of the centre ; therefore if we make G <hi rend="italic">y</hi> equal to the circumference of a circle, whoſe radius is CG, the body
                    will make one rotation round the centre of gravity, while this centre moves
                    along G <hi rend="italic">y ;</hi> and thus the relation is eſtabliſhed
                    between the two motions.</p>
                <p>But farther, the point C has, in fact, not moved out of its place. The incipient
                    motion has therefore been ſuch, that C has become a ſpontaneous centre of
                    converſion. It is eaſy to ſee that this muſt always be the caſe, whatever may be
                    the form of the rigid body or ſyſtem of particles connected by inflexible and
                    inexten-ſible lines. Since the ſyſtem both advances and turns round an axis
                    paſſing through its centre of gravity, there muſt be ſome point in the ſyſtem,
                    or which may eb conceived as connectedwith it by an inflexible line, which moves
                    backward, by the rotation, as faſt as the centre advances forward. A line drawn
                    through this point parallel to the axis muſt in this inſtant be at reſt, and
                    therefore muſt be a ſpontaneous axis of conversion. And, in this inſtant, the
                    combined motions of rotation round an axis paſſing through the centre of gravity
                    and the motion of progreſſion, are equivalent to, and actually con-ſtitute, an
                    incipient ſimple motion of rotation round another axis parallel to the former,
                    whoſe poſition may be afcertâined. But it is neceſſary to eſtabliſh this
                    propoſition and its converſe on clearer evidence.</p>
                <p>Therefore let G (ſig. ιo.) be the centre of gravity of a rigid ſyſtem of
                    particles of matter, ſuch as we ſuppoſe a ſolid body to be. Let this ſyſtem be
                    ſuppoſed to turn round the axis G <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> while the axis
                    itſelf is moving forward in the direction and with the velocity GI. Let the
                    rotation be ſuch, that a particle A has the direction ant velocity A Z <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> . Letus firſt ſuppoſe the progreſſive motion GI to be
                    perpendicular to the axis G^. Tt will therefore be parallel to the planes of the
                    circles deſcribed round the axis by the different particles. Let C G <hi
                        rend="italic"> g</hi> be a plane perpendicular to G I. It will cut the
                    plane of the circle deſcribed by A in a ſtraight line <hi rend="italic">cg,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> will be the centre round which A is
                    turning. Therefore A <hi rend="italic">g</hi> will be the radius vector of A,
                    and A <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">i∖ g.</hi> Let A <hi rend="italic">d</hi> be perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">c

                    abſolute motion of A is compounded of the motions A <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and A <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and is the diagonal A <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> of the parallelogram A <hi rend="italic">e ſ h.</hi> In the line <hi

                    in this moment a ſpontaneous axis of converſion ; ſor, becauſe A <hi
                        rend="italic"> η</hi> is perpendicular to A^∙ and A <hi rend="italic">d</hi> to Cy, the angle c <hi rend="sub">t</hi> y A is equal to <hi

                    the common angles A <hi rend="italic">ſ,</hi> and the remaining angle <hi

                    turning round the axis <hi rend="italic">e</hi> C.-Moreover, A <hi
                        rend="italic"> f</hi> is to <hi rend="italic">'fh</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic"> g i</hi> as A ί to <hi rend="italic">c g.</hi> Therefore,
                    both the direction and velocity of the abſolute motion of A is the lame as if
                    the body were turninground the fixed axis <hi rend="italic">cC</hi> ; and the
                    combined motion A <hi rend="italic">e of</hi> proςref-ſion, and the motion A <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of rotation round Gy, are equivalent to, and
                    really conſtitute, a momentary ſimple motion of rotation round the axis C <hi

                <p>On the other hand, the converſe propoſition is, that a ſimple motion of rotation
                    round a fixed axis Cc, ſuch that the centre G has the velocity and direction GI
                    perpendicular to C G, is equivalent to, and produces a motion of rotation round
                    an axis <hi rend="italic">Gg,</hi> along with the progreſſive motion GI of
                    this axis. This propo’ſtion is demonſtrated in the very ſame way, from the
                    conιide-ration that, by the rotation round C <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> we have <hi rend="italic">c</hi> A : <hi rend="italic">eg — A.J : g ι.</hi> From
                    this we deduce, that A <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is perpendicular to <hi
                        rend="italic"> Ag,</hi> and that <hi rend="italic">ſh</hi> : A <hi
                        rend="italic"> h — c g</hi> : y A; and thus we rcſolve the motion .Vj <hi
                        rend="sup"> r</hi> into a motion A <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of rotation
                    round G y, and a motion A <hi rend="italic">e</hi> of progreſſion common to
                    the whole body.</p>
                <p>But let us not confine the progreſſive motion to the direction perpendicular to
                    the axis G y Let us ſuppoſe that the whole body, while turning round G <hi
                        rend="italic"> g,</hi> is carried forward in the direction and with the
                    velocity GK. We can always conceive a plane L G C, which is perpendicular to the
                    plane in which the axis G <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and the direction G K of
                    the progreſſive motion are ſituated— And the motion G K may be conceived as
                    compounded of a motion Gt perpendicular to this plane and to the axis ; and a
                    motion of tranſlation G L, by which the axis Hides along in its own direction.
                    It is evident, that in conſequence of the firſt motion G I, there ariſes a
                    motion of rotation round C c. It is alſo evident, that if, while the body is
                    turning for a moment round C <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> this line be ſlid along
                    itſelt in the direction <hi rend="italic">c</hi> C, a motion equal to G L
                    vzill be induced on every particle A, and compounded with its motion of rotation
                    A F, and that if <hi rend="italic">ft</hi> be drawn equal and parallel to G L,
                    &lt;p will be the ſituation of the particle A when G is in K</p>
                <p>And thus it appears, that when the progreſſive mo-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0517" facs="gri_33125011196389_0523.tif"/>
                <p>tion is perpcndſeular to the axis oſ rotation paſſing through the centre of
                    gravity, the two motions progreſſive and rotatory are equivalent to a momentary
                    ſimple motion of rotation round a ſpontaneous axis of con-verſion, which is at
                    reſt: but when the progreſſive motion is inclined to the axis paſſing thro’ the
                    centre, the fponta-neous aχis of converſon is Aiding in its own direction.</p>
                <p>We may conceive the whole of this very diſtinctly and accurately by attending to
                    the motion of a garden roller. We may ſuppoſe it ſix feet in circumference, and
                    that it is dragged along at the rate of three feet in a ſecond from eaſt to
                    weft, the axis of the roller lying north and ſouth. Suppoſe a chalk line drawn
                    on the ſurface of the roller parallel to its axis. <hi rend="italic">Ί</hi> he
                    roller wfill turn once round in tw o féconds, and this line wfill be in contact
                    wfith the ground at the intervals of every fix ſeet. In that inſtant the line on
                    the roller now ſpoken of is at reſt, and the motion is the ſame as if it were
                    fixed, and the roller really turning round it. In ſhort, it is then a
                    ſpontaneous axis of converſion.</p>
                <p>Now, ſuppoſe the roller dragged in the ſame manner and in the ſame direction
                    along a ſheet of ice, while the ice is floating to the ſouth at the rate of four
                    feet in a ſecond. It is now plain that the roller is turning round an axis
                    through its centre of gravity, while the centre is carried in the direction <hi
                        rend="italic"> ſ</hi> 36 <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 52' W. at the rate of five
                    feet <hi rend="italic">per</hi> ſecond. It is alſo plain, that when the line
                    drawn on the ſurface of the ſtone is applied to the ice, its only motion is that
                    which the ice itſelf has to the ſouthward. The motion is now' a motion oi
                    rotation round this ſpontaneous axis of converſion, compounded wfith the motion
                    of four feet <hi rend="italic">per</hi> ſecond in the direction oſ this axis.
                    And thus we ſee that any complication of motion of rotation round an axis
                    paſſing through the centre of gravity, and a motion of progreſſion of that
                    centre, may always be reduced to a momentary or incipient motion of rotation
                    round another axis parallel to the former, compounded with a motion of that axis
                    in its own direction.</p>
                <p>The demonſtration which we have given of theſe two propoſitions points out the
                    method of finding the axis C <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> the incipient rotation
                    round which is equivalent to the combined progreſſive motion of the body, and
                    the rotation round the axis G <hi rend="sub">i</hi> y. We have only to note
                    the rotatory velocity A <hi rend="italic">h</hi> oſ ſome particle , and its
                    diſtance A <hi rend="sub">ι</hi> g from the axis, and the progreſſive velocity
                    GI oſ the whole body, and then to make G C a fourth proportional to Δ <hi
                        rend="italic"> b,</hi> GI, and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> A, and to place
                    GC in a plane perpendicular to G I, which is perpendicular to Gy, and to place C
                    on that fide of G <hi rend="sub">t</hi> ^ w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> hich is
                    moving in the oppoſite direction to the axis.</p>
                <p>In the ſimple caſe of this problem, which we exhibited in order to give us eaſy
                    and familiar notions of the ſubject, it appeared that the retrograde velocity of
                    rotation of the point C was equal to the progreſſive velocity of the centre.
                    This muſt be the caſe in e⅛ery point of tħe circumference of the circle of which
                    CG, fig. 9. is the radius. Therefore, as the body advances, and turns round G,
                    this circle will apply itſelf in ſucceſſion to the line CK parallel to G <hi
                        rend="italic"> y</hi> ; and any individual point of it, ſuch as C, will
                    deſcribe a cycloid of which this circle is the generating circle, C K the baſe,
                    and C G half the altitude. The other points of the body will deſcribe trochoids,
                    elongated or contracted according as the deſcribir.g points are nearer to or
                    more remote &amp;om G than the point C is.</p>
                <p>It is now' evident that all this muſt obtain in every caſe, as well as in this
                    limple one. And when we have aſeertained the diſtance G C between the axis of
                    rotation paſſing through the centre, and the momentary lponta-neous axis of
                    converſion paſſing through C, we can then aſcertain the relation betw <hi
                        rend="sup"> τ</hi> een the motions of rotation and progreſſion. We then
                    know that the body will make one rotation round its central axis, While its
                    centre moves over a ſpace equal to the circumference of a circle of a known
                    diameter.</p>
                <p>We muſt therefore proceed to the methods ſor determining the poſition of the
                    point C. This muſt depend on the proportion between the velocity of the general
                    progreſſive motion, that is, the velocity of the centre, and the velocity of
                    ſome point of the body.— This muſt be aſeertained by obſervation. In moſt caſes
                    which are intereſting, wè learn the po tion of the axis, the place of its
                    poles, the comparative progreſſive velθ'∙ city of the centre, and the velocity
                    of rotation of the different points, in a variety oſ w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ays ; and it would not much increaſe our knowledge to detail the rules which may
                    be followed ſor this purpoſe. The circumſtance which chiefly intereſts us at
                    preſent is to know how theſe motions may be produced ; what force is neceſe
                    ſary, and how it muſt be applied, in order to produce a given motion of rotation
                    and progreſſion ; or what will be the motion which a given force, applied ina.
                    given manner, wfill produce.</p>
                <p>We have already given- the principles on which we may proceed in this
                    inveſtigation. We have ſhown the circumſtances which determine the place of the
                    centre of percuſſion of a body turning round a given fixed axis. Γhis centre of
                    percuſſion is the point of the body where all the inherent forces oſ the
                    whirling body preciſely balance each other, or rather where they unite and
                    compoſe one accumulated progreſſive force, which may then be oppoſed by an equal
                    and oppoſite external force If, therefore, the body is not whirling, but at reſt
                    on this i.xed axis, and if this external force be applied at the centre of
                    percuſſion, now become <hi rend="italic">apoini oſ impvlfiοn,</hi> a rotation
                    wfill commence round the fixed axis preciſely equal to what had been ſtopped by
                    this external force, but in the oppoſite direction ; or, if the external force
                    be applied in the direction in which the centre of percuſſion of the whirling
                    body was moving at the inſtant of ſtoppage, the rotation produced by this
                    impulſe will be the ſame in every reſpect. And we found that in the inſtant of
                    application of this external force, either to ſtop or to begin the motion, no
                    preſſure whatever was excited on the ſupports of the axis, and that the axis
                    was, in this inſtant, a ſpontaneous axis of converſion.</p>
                <p>Moreover, we have ſhown, art. 84, that a rotation round any axis, whether fixed
                    or ſpontaneous, is equivalent to, or compounded of, a rotation, round another
                    axis <hi rend="italic">parallel to it,</hi> and paſſing through the centre of
                    gravity, and a progreſſive motion in the direction of the centre’s motion at the
                    inſtant of impulſe.</p>
                <p>Now, as the poſition oſ the fixed axis, and the known diſpoſition of all the
                    particles of the body with reſpect to this axis, determines the place of the
                    centre of percuſſion, and furniſhes all the mathematical conditions which muſt
                    be implemented in its determination, and the direction and magnitude of the
                    force which is produced and exerted at the centre of percuſſion ; ſo, on the
                    other hand, the knowledge of the magnitude and.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0518" facs="gri_33125011196389_0524.tif"/>
                <p>direction of an external force which is exerted on the point of impulſion of a
                    body not connected with any fixed axis, and of the diſpoſition of all the parts
                    of this body with reſpect to this point of impulſion, will furniſh us with the
                    mathematical circumſtances which determine the poſition of the ſpontaneous axis
                    of converſion, and therefore determine the poſition of the axis through the
                    centre (parallel to the ſpontaneous axis of converſion), round which the body
                    will whirl, while it3 centre proceeds in the direction of the external force.</p>
                <p>The proceſs, therefore, for determining the axis of progreſſive rotation is juſt
                    the converſe of the proceſs for determining the centre of percuſſion.</p>
                <p>John Bernoulli was the firſt who conſidered the motion of free bodies impelled
                    by forces whoſe line of direction did not paſs through their centre of gravity ;
                    and lie takes it for granted, that ſince the body both advances and turns round
                    an axis paſſing through the centre of gravity, this axis is perpendicular to the
                    plane paſſing through the direction of the force, and through the point of
                    impulſion and the centre of gravity. Other authors of the firſt name, ſuch as
                    Huyghens, Leibnitz, Roberval, &amp;c. have thought themſelvee -obliged to
                    de-monſtrate this. Their demonſtration is as follows :</p>
                <p>Let a body whoſe centre of gravity is G (ſig. II.) be impelled at the point P by
                    a force acting in the direction P Q not paſſing through the centre. The inertia
                    of the whole body wfill reſiſt in the ſame manner as if the whole matter were
                    collected in G, and therefore the reſiſtance will be propagated to the point P
                    in the direction. GP. The particle P, therefore, is impelled in the direction P
                    and reiiſted in the direction P A, and muſt therefore begin to move in ſome
                    direction PB, which makes the diagonal of a parallelogram of which the ſides
                    have the directions P Q__and P A. The diagonal and ſides of a parallelogram are
                    in one plane. P is therefore moving in the plane APQB or GPQ^, and it is turning
                    round an axis which paſſes through G.— Therefore this axis <hi rend="italic">muſl</hi> be perpendicular to the plane</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">gpq.</hi></p>
                <p>It would require a ſeries of difficult proportions to ſhow the fallacy of this
                    reaſoning in general terms, and to determine the poſition oſ the axis through G.
                    We ſhall content ourſelves with a very limple caſe, where there can be no
                    heſitation. Let A and B (ſig. 12.) be two equal balls connected wfith the axis <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> by inflexible lines A <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> B <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">a b.</hi> Let A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be 1, and B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> 2.
                    The centre of gravity G wfill evidently be in the line cG parallel to Art and
                    B/?, and in the middle of <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> G is ιfi- Let O be the centre of</p>
                <p>A . A <hi rend="italic">a <hi rend="sup">2</hi></hi> + B . B <hi rend="italic">D</hi></p>
                <p>oſciBation. ,0 &gt;3 = - = t—</p>
                <p>Draw A w, B <hi rend="italic">n</hi> perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">c</hi> G, and ſuppoſe the balls transferred to <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic"> n.</hi> Their centre of oſcillation will be ſtill at O ; and
                    we ſee that if the ſyſtem in this form were ſtopped at 0, all would be in
                    equilibrio. For the force with which the ball A arrives (by Bringing round thé
                    axis)’at <hi rend="italic">rn,</hi> is as its quantity of matter and velocity
                    jointly, that is, A . A <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> or ι. That of B arriving at <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is B . B <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> or 2. The
                    arm <hi rend="italic">m</hi> 0 of the lever turning round 0 is -∣∙, and the
                    arm <hi rend="italic">n</hi> O is -j-. The forces, therefore, are reciprocally
                    as the arms of the lever on which they act, and their momenta, or powers to turn
                    the line <hi rend="italic">rn n</hi> round O, are equal and oppoſite, and
                    therefore balance each other ; and therefore, at the</p>
                <p>mitant of flopping, no preſſure is exerted at <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> Therefore, if any impulſe is made at O, the balls at <hi rend="italic">m</hi> and « will be put in motion with velocities 1 and 2, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> will be a ſpontaneous centre of converſion. Let ue ſee whether this will
                    be the caſe when the halls are in their natural places A and B, or whether there
                    will be any tendency to a rotation round the axis <hi rend="italic">c</hi> 0.
                    The momentum of A, by which it tends to produce a rotation round <hi
                        rend="italic"> c</hi> O is A . A <hi rend="italic">a .</hi> A ot, = 1 × A
                    ot. That of B is B.B zLBn, — 2×Bπ. Aot and B <hi rend="italic">n</hi> are
                    equal, and therefore the momentum of B is double that of A, and there is a
                    tendency of the ſyſtem to turn round <hi rend="italic">c</hi> O; and if, at
                    the inſtant of ſtoppage, the ſupports oſ the axis <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> were removed, this rotation round <hi rend="italic">c</hi> O would take place,
                    and the point <hi rend="italic">b</hi> would advance, and <hi rend="italic">a</hi> would recede, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> only remaining at reſt.
                    Therefore, if an impulſe were made at O, <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> w <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> ould not become a ſpontaneous momentary axis of
                    converſion, and 0 is not the centre of percuſſion. This centre muſt be ſomewhere
                    in the line OP parallel to <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> as at P, and ſo
                    ſituated that the momenta A . A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> . A « and B . B <hi
                        rend="italic"> β</hi> . B <hi rend="italic">β</hi> may be equal, or that
                    A <hi rend="sup">a</hi> - may be double of B <hi rend="sub">j</hi> g,or <hi
                        rend="italic"> ap</hi> double of <hi rend="italic">bp.</hi> If an impulſe
                    be now made at P, the balls A B will be urged by forces as 1 and 2, and
                    therefore will move as if round the axis <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> and there
                    will be no preſſures produced at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic"> b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> will really become
                    a momentary ſpontaneous axis of converſion.</p>
                <p>Now join G and P. Here then it is evident, that a body or ſyſtem A,B, receiving
                    an impulſe at P perpendicular to the plane <hi rend="italic">a c</hi> G,
                    acquires to itſelf a ſpontaneous axis of converſion which is not perpendicular
                    to the line joining the point of impreſſion and the centre of gravity. And we
                    have ſhown, in art. 84. that this motion round <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> is
                    compounded of a progreſſive motion of the whole body in the direction of the
                    centre, and a rotation round an axis paſſing through the centre <hi
                        rend="italic"> parallel to α b.</hi> Therefore, in this ſyſtem of free
                    bodies, the axis of rotation is not perpendicular to the plane paſſing through
                    the centre of gravity in the direction of the. impelling force.</p>
                <p>As w <hi rend="sup">f</hi> e have already obſerved, it would be a laborious
                    •taſk to aſcertain in general terms the poſition of the &lt; progreſſive
                    axis of rotation. Although the proceſs is’ the inverſe of that for determining
                    the centre of per- j cuſſion when the axis of rotation is given, it is a moſt ,
                    intricate bufineſs to convert the ſteps of this proceſs. The general method is
                    this : The momentum of a particleA (fig. 5.) by which it tends to change the
                    poſx-tion of the axis D <hi rend="italic">cl,</hi> has for its factors A <hi
                        rend="italic"> a</hi> A ∕, and A ≈, which are its diſtances from three
                    planes DT <hi rend="sup">t</hi> z, DCO <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and C <hi
                        rend="sub"> ι</hi> 5 <hi rend="sup">r</hi> χκ, given in poſition. The ſum
                    of all theſe muſt be equal to nothing,-by the compenſa-tion oſ poſitive and
                    negative quantities. We muſt find three other planes (of which only one is in
                    ſome meaſure determined in poſition, being perpendicular to DCO »), ſo ſituated
                    that the ſums of ſimilar products of the diſtances of the particles from them
                    may in like manner be equal to nothing. This is a very intricate problem ; ſo
                    intricate, that mathematicians have long doubted and diſputed about the
                    certainty of the ſolu-tions. Euler, d’Alembert, Erifi, Landen, and others, have
                    at laſt proved, that every body, however irregular its ſhape, has at leaſt three
                    axes paſſing through its centre of gravity., round which it will continue to re-</p>

                <p>volve while proceeding forward, and that theſe are at right angles to each other
                    ; and they have given the conditions which muſt be implemented in the
                    determination of theſe axes. But they ſtill leave us exceedingly at a loſs ſor
                    means to diſcover the poſitions of the axes of a given body which have theſe
                    conditions.</p>
                <p>To ſolve this problem therefore in general terms, would lead to a diſquiſition
                    altogether diſproportioned to our work. We muſt reſtrict ourſelves to thoſe
                    forms of body and ſituations of the point of impulſion which admit of the
                    coincidence of the centres of ofcillation and percuſſion ; and we muſt leave out
                    the caſes where the axis has 'a motion in the direction of its length ; that is,
                    we ſhall always ſuppoſe the ſpontaneous axis of converſion to have no motion.
                    Thus we ſhall comprehend the phenomena of the planetary motions, ſimilar to the
                    preceſſion of our equinoctial point?, and all the intereſting caſes oſ practical
                    mechanics. The ſpeculative mathematical reader will fill up the blanks of this
                    inveſtigation by conſuking the writings of Euler and D’Alembert in the Berlin
                    Memoirs, Friſi’s Coſmo-graphia, and the papers of Mr Landen, Mr Milner, and Mr
                    Vince, in the Philoſophical Tranſactions. But we hope, by means of a beautiful
                    propoſition on the com-poſition of rotatory motions, to enable every reader to
                    diſcover the poſition oſ the axis oſ progreſſive rotation in every caſe which
                    may intereſt him, without the previous ſolution of the intricate problem
                    mentioned</p>
                <p>above.</p>
                <p>Let ABPC∕&gt;i A (fig. 13.) be a ſection of a body through its centre of
                    gravity G, ſo formed, that the part ABPC is ſimilar, and ſimilarly placed with
                    the part <hi rend="italic">AbpC,</hi> ſo that the plane AC would divide it
                    equally. Let thia body bc impelled at P in the direction HP, perpendicular to
                    the plane AC. The axis round which it will turn will be perpendicular to G ‰
                    Suppoſe it at A. Then drawing AB and A <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to ſimilar
                    points, it is plairr that B <hi rend="italic">r, b ß</hi> are equal and
                    oppoſite ; theſe repreſent the forces which would raiſe or lower one end of the
                    axis, as has been already obſerved. The axis therefore will remain perpendicular
                    to G ‰</p>
                <p>Let the body be ſo ſhaped, that if the parts to the right and left of the point
                    of impulſe jγ (the impulſe is here ſuppoſed not <hi rend="italic">perpendicular</hi> to the plane AC, but <hi rend="italic">in</hi> this plane) are equal and
                    ſimilarly placed ; then the momenta round AC muſt balance each other, and the
                    axis EF will have no tendency to go out of the plane ABCZ∣ A perpendicular to
                    the impulſe.</p>
                <p>Any body whoſe ſhape has theſe two properties will turn round an axis
                    perpendicular to the plane which paſſes through the centre of gravity in the
                    direction of the impelling force. This condition is always found in the planets
                    when dſtlurbed by the gravitation to a diſtant planet: for they are all figures
                    of revolution. The direction of the diſturbing or impelling force is always in a
                    plane paſſing through the axis and the diſturbing body.</p>
                <p>With ſuch limitations therefore we propoſe the following problem</p>
                <p>Let G (ſig. 14.) be the centre of gravity of a body in free ſpace, which is
                    impelled by an external force <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> acting in the fine FP,
                    which does not paſs through the centre. Ret <hi rend="italic">m</hi> be the
                    number of equal particles in the body, or its quantity of matter. Let the forcé <hi rend="italic">f</hi> be</p>
                <p>ſuch, that it would communicate to the body the velocity <hi rend="italic">v ;</hi> that is, would cauſe the centre to move with the velocity <hi
                        rend="italic"> v.</hi> It may be expreffed by the quantity of motion which
                    it produces, that is, by <hi rend="italic">m v,</hi> and it would produce the
                    velocity <hi rend="italic">m v</hi> on one particle. It is required to
                    determine the whole motion, progreſſive and rotatory, which it will produce, and
                    the ſpace which it will deſcribe during one turn round its axis.</p>
                <p>Draw GI parallel and PGC perpendicular to FP, and let GI be taken for the
                    meaſure of the progreſſive velocity <hi rend="italic">v.</hi></p>
                <p>It has been demonſtrated that the centre G will proceed in the direction GI with
                    the velocity <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> and that the body will at the ſame time
                    turn round an axis paſſing through G, perpendicular to the plane of the figure,
                    every particle deſcribing circles in parallel planes round this axis, and with
                    velocities of rotation proportional to their diſtances from it. There is
                    therefore a certain diſtance GB, ſuch that the velocity with which a particle
                    deſcribes its circumference is equal to the progreſſive velocity <hi
                        rend="italic"> v.</hi> Let BCD be this circumference. When the particle
                    deſcribing this circumference is in the line CGP, and in that part of it which
                    lies beyond P from G, its abſolute velocity muſt be double that of the centre G
                    ; but when it is in the oppoſite point C <hi rend="sub">9</hi> its retrograde
                    velocity being equal to the progreſſive velocity of the centre, it muſt be at
                    reſt. In every poſition of the body, therefore, that point of the accompanying
                    circumference which is at this extremity of the perpendicular drawn through the
                    centre on the line of dire ion of the impelling force is at reſt. It is at
                    that-initant a ſpontaneous centre of converſion, and the ſtraight line drawn
                    through it perpendicular to the plane of the figure is then a ſpontaneous axis
                    of converſion, and every particle is in a momentary ſtateof rotation round this
                    axis, in directions perpendicular to the lines drawn to the axis at right
                    angles, and with velocities proportional to theſe diſtances ; and laſtly, the
                    body advances in the direction GI through a ſpace equal to the circumference
                    BCD, while it makes one turn round G.</p>
                <p>Let A be one of the particles in the plane of the figure. Join AC, AG, AP. Draw <hi rend="italic">Ab, Ac, Ad</hi> perpendicular to CP, CA, GA. The
                    abſolute motion A <hi rend="italic">c</hi> of A is compounded of the
                    progreſſive motion A <hi rend="italic">h</hi> common to the whole body and
                    equal to GI, and the motion A <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of rotation round the .
                    entre of gravity G. Therefore ſince A <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is equal to
                    &lt;υ, and A <hi rend="italic">c</hi> is the diagonal of a parallelogram
                    given both in ſpecies and magnitude, it is alſo given, and (as appears alſo ſrom
                    the reaſoning in art. 85.) it is to GI as CA to CG.</p>
                <p>By the application of the force <hi rend="italic">m v</hi> in the direction
                    FP, every particle of the body is dragged out of its place, and exerts a
                    reſiſtance equal to the motion which it acquires. A part of this force, which we
                    may call <hi rend="italic">m v,</hi> is employed in communicating the motion A <hi rend="italic">c</hi> tΘ A. Therefore <hi rend="italic">m v,</hi> which we have, and, from what has been lately ſhown, CG.: CA = GI : A <hi
                        rend="italic"> c, = v</hi> : A <hi rend="italic">c <hi rend="sub">9</hi></hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">v'CA</hi></p>
                <p>and therefore At = ^qq^. But farther (agreeably to</p>
                <p>what was demonſtrated in art. 16.) we have CP : C A ∙u.CA</p>

                    the form of the body and.the ſituation of the point of impuliion ; while the
                    time of deſeribing <hi rend="sub">π</hi> times this length is inverſely as the
                    force.</p>
                <p>2. The angular velocity with any given force is as GP : for CG, and conſequently
                    the circumference %.CG, deſeribed during one turn, is inverſely as GP.</p>

                    ſpontaneous centre of conver-ſion (ſee art. 4' )∙</p>
                <p>y. A force equal and oppoſite to <hi rend="italic">m v,</hi> or to ∕, applied
                    at G, will ſtop the progreſſive motion, but will make no change in the rotation
                    ; but if it be applied at P, it will ſtop all motion both progreſſive and
                    rotatory. If applied between P and G, it will ſtop the progreſſive motion, but
                    will leave ſome motion of rotation. If applied beyond P it will leave a rotation
                    in the oppoſite direction. If applied beyond G, or between G and C, it will
                    increaſe the rotation. All this will be eaſily conceived by reflecting on its
                    effect on the body at reſt.</p>
                <p>6. A whirling body which has no progreſſive motion cannot have been brought into
                    this ſtate by the action of a ſingle force It may have been put into this
                    condition by the fimultaneous operation of two equal and oppofιte forces. The
                    equality and oppoſition oſ the forces is neceffary for flopping all progreſſive
                    motion. If one of them has acted, at the centre, the rotatory motion has been
                    the effect of the other only. If they have acted on oppoſite fides, they
                    conſpired with each other in producing the rotation ; but have oppoſed each
                    other if they acted on oppoſite fides.</p>
                <p>In like manner, it is plain that a motion of rotation, together with a
                    progreſſive motion of the centre in the direction of the axis, could not have
                    been produced by the action of a ſingle force.</p>
                <p>7. When the ſpace S which a body deſcribes during one rotation has been
                    obſerved, we can diſcover the point of impulſe by which a fingle force may have
                    acted in producing both the motions of progreſſion</p>

                    perfect oppoſition and equality oſ two forces, neceffary for giving a rotation
                    without a progreſſive motion, has the odds againſt it of infinity to unity. This
                    corroborates the conjectures of philoſophers, and the obſervations. of Herſehel
                    and other aſtronomers, who think that the ſo-lar ſyſtem is approaching to that

                <p>8. As in the communication of progreſſive motion among bodies, the ſame quantity

                <p>tatlon among whit ling bodies the quantity of rotatory momentum is preſerved.
                    This appears ſrom the general tenor oſ our formulæ : for if we ſuppoſe a body
                    turning round an axis paſſing through its centre, without any progreſſive
                    motion, we muſt ſuppoſe that the force <hi rend="italic">n v,</hi> which put
                    it in motion, has been oppoſed by an equal and oppoſite force. Let this be
                    ſuppoſed to have acted on the centre. Then the whole rotation has been the
                    effect of the other acting at ſome diſtance GP from the centre. Its momentum is
                    wj∙u.GP. Had it acted alone, it would have produced a rotation compounded with a
                    progreſſive motion of the centre with the velocity <hi rend="italic">v ;</hi> and the body acquires a momentary ſpontaneous axis of converſion at the diſtance
                    GC from the centre oſ gravity. The abſolute velocity AC of</p>
                <p>, ∙υ.AC . . τ.AC <hi rend="sup">1</hi></p>
                <p>any particle is <hi rend="sup">-</hi> CG~' <hi rend="sup">lts</hi> momentum

                <p>and the ſum of all the momenta is —qj—, or v/AC <hi rend="sup">1</hi></p>
                <p>-4ςφς—, and this is equal to <hi rend="italic">m</hi> v.GP. But when the vLr</p>
                <p>progreſſive motion is ſtopped, A <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which was a
                    conſti-tuent of the abſolute motion of A, is annihilated, and nothing remains
                    but the motion A J of rotation round G. But the triangles <hi rend="italic">dλc</hi> and G AC were demon-ftrated (n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 8ι.) to be ſimilar;
                    and therefore AC : <hi rend="italic">Ad</hi> <hi rend="sub">=</hi> CA : GA. Therefore the abſolute velocity of the

                    di-ftance of the centre of converſion from the centre of gravity, becauſe there
                    is now no ſuch thing as the ſpontaneous axis of converſion, or rather it
                    coincides with the axis of rotation. GC is the diſtance from the centre of a
                    particle whoſe velocity of rotation is equal to <hi rend="italic">v.</hi></p>
                <p>Now let the body be changed, either by a new diſ-tribution of its parts, or by
                    an addition or abſtraction of matter, or by both ; and let the ſame force <hi
                        rend="italic"> m v</hi> act at the ſame diſtance GP ſrom the centre. We
                    ſhall</p>

                <p>ſtill have <hi rend="italic">m</hi> v&gt;.GP — —qq <hi rend="sup">,,</hi> ; and therefore the ſum</p>
                <p>of the momenta of the particles of the whirling body is ſtill the ſame, viz.
                    equal to the momentum of the force <hi rend="italic">m v</hi> acting by the
                    lever GP. If therefore a free body has been turning round its centre of gravity,
                    and has the diſtribution of its parts ſuddenly changed (the centre however
                    remaining in the ſame place), or has a quantity of matter ſuddenly added or
                    taken away, it will turn with ſuch an angular velocity that the ſum of the
                    momenta is the ſame as before.</p>
                <p>We have been ſo particular on this ſubject, becauſe 'it affects the celebrated
                    problem of the preceſſion of :the equinoxes ; and Sir Iſaac Newton’s ſolution of
                    it is erroneous on account of his miſtake in this particular. He computes the
                    velocity with which a quantity of matter equal to the exceſs of the terreſtrial
                    ſpheroid over the inſcribed ſphere would perform its librations, if detached
                    from the ſpherical nucleus. He then ſup-poſes it ſuddenly to adhere to tſie
                    ſphere, and to drag it into the fame libratory motion and he computes the</p>
                <p>libration of the whole maſs, upon the ſuppoſition that the quantity of motion in
                    the libratory ſpheroid is the ſame with the previous quantity of motion oſ the
                    libra-ting redundant ring or ſhell ; whereas he ſhould have computed it on the
                    ſuppoſition that it was the quantity of momenta that remaincd unchanged.</p>
                <p>The ſame thing obtains in rotations round fixed axes, as appears by the perfect
                    ſameneſs of the formulæ for both claſſes of motions.</p>
                <p>This law, which, in imitation of the Leibnitzians, w’e might call the <hi

                <p>Laſtly, if the oblate ſpheroid is made to turn round an equatorial diameter
                    paſſing through C perpendicular to the plane of the figure, it is plain that
                    every ſection parallel to the meridian EPQ__/&gt; is an ellipſe ſimilar to
                    this meridian. If this ellipſe differs very little from the inſcribed circle, as
                    is the caſe of the earth in the problem <hi rend="sub">e</hi> &gt;f the
                    preceſſion of the equinoxes, the momentum of each ellipſe may be conſidered as
                    equal to that of a circle of the ſame area, or whoſe diameter is a mean
                    proportional between the equatorial and polar diameters of the ſpheroid. This
                    radius is to the radius of the circum-ſcribed circle as √3 <hi rend="italic">a</hi> to <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Therefore the momenta of the ſection of the
                    ſpheroid and oſ the circumſeribed ſphere are in the conſtant ratio of <hi
                        rend="italic"> b <hi rend="sup">2</hi> α <hi rend="sup">l</hi></hi> to <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="sup"> b</hi> 4 <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> or of <hi rend="italic">a <hi rend="sup">t</hi></hi> to <hi rend="italic">b <hi rend="sup">2</hi> .</hi> And if the

                    of the ſphere <hi rend="italic">is b <hi rend="sup">4</hi> wi</hi> and
                    therefore that of the ſpheroid j <hi rend="sub">s</hi> <hi rend="italic">τr h <hi rend="sup">2</hi> <hi rend="sub">a</hi> <hi rend="sup">1</hi> w,</hi> agreeably to what was aſſumed in the

                <p>This value of the momentum of a ſpheroid round an equatorial diameter is only a
                    very eaſy approximation ; ⅛n exact value may be obtained by an infinite ſeries.
                    The whole matter of the ſpheroid may be conſidered as uniformly diſtributed on
                    the ſurface of a ſimilar ſpheroid whoſe diameter is = √4 of the diameter of the
                    ſpheroid. It will have the ſame momentum, becauſe a triangle in one of the
                    ellipſes, having an elementary arch of the circumference for its baſe, and the
                    centre of the ellipſe for its vertex, has its centre of gyration diſtant from
                    the vertex √⅜ the length of the radius of the ellipſe, and the problem is
                    reduced to the finding the ſum of theſe lines. But even when the ſeries for this
                    ſum involves the 3d power of the eccentricity, it is not more exact than the
                    above approximation.</p>
                <p>A ſimilar propoſition may be obtained ſor a prolate ſpheroid vibrating round an
                    equatorial diameter, and</p>

                <p>The reader muſt have obſerved that the preceding diſquiſitions refer to thoſe
                    motions only which reſiſtt from the action of external forces and to the ſtate
                    of incipient motion. All circular motions, ſuch as thoſe of rotation, are
                    accompanied by centrifugal forces. A central force is neceſſary .for retaining
                    every particle in its circular path ; ſuch forces muſt therefore be excited in
                    the body, and can ariſe only from the forces of co-heſion by which its particles
                    are held, together. Theſe forces are mutual, equal, and oppoſite ; and as much
                    as a particle A (fig. 5.) is retained by a force in the direction A <hi
                        rend="italic"> a</hi> of the line which connects it with the fix, ed axis D <hi rend="italic">d <hi rend="sub">y</hi></hi> or in the direction AG (fig. 10.), which, connects it with the progreſſive
                    axis; ſo much muſt the point <hi rend="italic">a of</hi> the axis <hi
                        rend="italic"> Dd</hi> be urged in the oppoſite direction <hi rend="italic"
                        > a</hi> A, or ſo much muſt the whole body be urged in the direction GA.
                    Every point therefore of the axis D √, or of the axis through G in ſig. 10. is
                    carried in a variety of directions perpendicular to itſelf. Theſe forces may or
                    may not balance each other. If this balance obtains with reſpect to the fixed
                    axis, its ſupports will ſuſtain no preſſure but what ariſes from the external
                    force; if not, one ſupport will be more preſſed than the other; and <hi
                        rend="italic"> iſ</hi> both were removed, the axis would change its
                    poſition. The ſame muſt be affirmed of the axis through G in ſig. 10. This,
                    having no ſupport, muſt change its poſition.</p>
                <p>And thus it may happen, that the axis of rotation paſſing through G which has
                    been determined by the preceding diſquiſitions, is not permanent either in
                    reſpect oſ the body, or in reſpect of abſolute ſpace. Theſe two rotations are
                    eſſentially different. The way to conceive both is this. Suppoſe a ſpherical
                    ſurface deſcri-bed round the body, having its centra in the centre of gravity;
                    and ſuppoſe this ſurface to revolve and to proceed forward along with the body :
                    in ſhort, let it be conceived as an immaterial ſm face attached to the body. The
                    axis of rotation will paſs through this ſurface in two points which we ſhall
                    call its poles. Now, we ſay that the axis is permanent with reſpect to the body
                    when it has always the ſame poles in this ſpherical ſurface. Suppoſe another
                    ſpherical ſurface dcſcribed round the ſame centre, and that this ſurface alſo
                    accompanies the body in all its progreſſive motion, but does not turn with it.
                    The axis is permanent with reſpect to abſolute ſpace when it has always the ſame
                    poles in this ſurface : it is evident that theſe two facts are not inſepa-rable.
                    A boy’s top ſpins on the ſame point and the ſame corporeal axis, while, towards
                    the end of its motion, we obſerve it directing this round and round to different
                    quarters of the room. And when we make an egg or a lemon ſpin with great
                    rapidity on its fide on a level table, we ſee it gradually riſe up, till it
                    ſtand quite on end, ſpinning all the while round an axis pointing to the zenith.</p>
                <p>This change in the poſition of the axis is produced by the unbalanced actions of
                    the centrifugal forces exerted by the particles. Suppoſe two equal balls A and B
                    (fig. 16.) connected by an inflexible rod whoſe middle point is G, the centre of
                    gravity of the balls. This ſyſtem may be made to turn round the material axis D⅛
                    A deſcribing the circle AEF A, and B deſcribing the circle BHKB. The rod AB may
                    alſo be conceived</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0523" facs="gri_33125011196389_0529.tif"/>
                <p>as moveable round the point G by mean« of a pin at right angles to the axis.
                    Suppoſe the balls paſſing through the ſituations A and B ; their centrifugal
                    forces urge them at the ſame time in the directions CA and OB, which impulſions
                    conſpire to make the connecting rod recede from both ends of the axis D <hi
                        rend="italic"> d.</hi> And thus the balls, inſtead of deſeribing parallel
                    circles round this axis, will deſcribe parallel ſpirals, gradually opening the
                    angles DGA, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> GB more and more, till the balls acquire
                    the poſition « <hi rend="italic">ß</hi> at right angles to the axis. They will
                    not ſtop there, for tach came into that poſition v⅜h an oblique motion. They
                    will paſs it ; and were it not for the reſiſtance of the air and the friction of
                    the joint at G, they would go on till the ball A came to deſcribe the circle
                    BHK, and the ball B to deſcribe the circle AEF. The centrifugal forces will now
                    have exhauſted by oppoſition all the motions which they had acquired during
                    their paſſage from the poſition AB to the poſition <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="sup"> x</hi> IL</hi> and now they will again deſcribe ſpirals
                    gradually opening, and then contracting, till the balls arrive at their original
                    poſition AB, when the proceſs will begin again. Thus they will continue a kind
                    of oſeillating rotation.</p>
                <p>Thus the axis is continually changing with reſpect to the ſyſtem of balls ; but
                    it is fixed in reſpect to abſolute ſpace, becauſe the axis D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is ſupported. It does not yet appear that it has any tendency to
                    change its poſition, becauſe the centrifugal tendency of the balls is completely
                    yielded to by the joint at G. The material axis has indeed ſuftained no change ;
                    but the real axis, or mathematical line round which the rotation was going on
                    every moment, has been continually ſhiſting its place. This is not ſo obvious,
                    and requires a more attentive conſideration. To ſhow accurately the gradual
                    change of poſition of the real axis of rotation would require a long diſcuſſion
                    We ſhall content ourſelves wn’tſh exhibiting a caſe where the poſition of the
                    momentary axis is unqueſtionably different from <hi rend="italic">Dd,</hi> which we may ſuppoſe horizontal.</p>
                <p>Take the balls in the poſition « <hi rend="italic">β∙</hi> They came into this
                    poſition with a ſpiral motion, and therefore each of them was moving obliquely
                    to <hi rend="sup">t</hi> he tangents <hi rend="italic">*r,βγ</hi> to the
                    circle <hi rend="italic">afβt,</hi> ſuppoſe in the directions <hi
                        rend="italic"> a6,βκ,</hi> They are therefore moving round the centre G in
                    a plane <hi rend="italic">0aβκ,</hi> inclined to the plane <hi rend="italic">&lt;t <hi rend="sup">i</hi> &lt;*-βy</hi> of the circle <hi
                        rend="italic"> aSβι.</hi> The momentary axis of rotation is therefore
                    perpendicular to this oblique plane, and therefore does not coincide with D <hi
                        rend="italic"> d.</hi></p>
                <p>We cannot enter upon the inveſtigation oſ this eva-gation of the axis, although
                    the ſubject is both curious and important to the ſpeculative mathematicians.</p>
                <p>A knowledge of it is abſolutely neceffary to a <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> ſolution of the great ' problem of the preceſſion. But when treating that
                    article, we contented ourſelves with ſhowing that the evagation which obtains in
                    this natural phenomenon is ſo exceedingly minute, that although multiplied many
                    thouſands of times, it would eſeape the niceft obſervations of modern
                    aſtronomers; and that it is a thing which does not accumulate beyond a certain
                    limit, much too ſmall for obſervation, and then , diminiſhes again, and is
                    periodical. Euler, D’Alembert, Frifi, and De la Grange, have ſhown the momentary
                    poſition of the real variable axis correſponding to any given time ; and Landen
                    has with great ingenuity and elegance connected theſe momentary pofi∙</p>
                <p>fitιons, and given the whole paths of evagation. Mr Segnor was, we believe, the
                    firſt who ſhowed (in a Diſſertation <hi rend="italic">De Mοtu Turbinuιn <hi
                            rend="sub"> t</hi></hi> Halle, 1755)» that in every body there were at leaſt three lines paſſing
                    through the centre of gravity at right angles to each other, forming the ſolid
                    angle of a cube, round which the centrifugal forces were accurately balanced,
                    and therefore a rotation begun round either of theſe three lines would be
                    continued, and they are permanent axes of rotation. Albert Euler gave the firſt
                    de-monſtration in 1760, and ſince that time the inveſtigation of theſe axes has
                    been extended and improved by the different authors already named. It is an
                    exceedingly difficult ſubject; and w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> e recommend the
                    ſyn-thetical inveſtigation by Frifi in his <hi rend="italic">Coſmographia</hi> as the fitteſt for inſtructing a curious reader to whom the ſubject is new. We
                    ſhall conclude this diſſertation with a beautiful theorem, the enunciation of
                    which we owe to P. Frifi, which has amazingly improved the whole theory, and
                    gives eaſy and elegant ſolutions of the moſt difficult problems. It is analogous
                    to Qιe great theorem of the compofition of motions and forces.</p>
                <p>If a body turns round an axis AGa (fig. 17.) paſſing through its centre of

                    though the whole and every particle of the body will be in a ſtate of rotation

                <p>If a body revolves round an axis paſſing through its centre of gravity with the
                    angular velocity «, while this axis is carried round another axis, alſo paſſing
                    through its centre of gravity, with the angular velocity <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> theſe two motions compoſe a motion of every particle of the body round a
                    third axis, lying in the plane of the other two, and inclined to each of the
                    former axes in angles whoſe fines are inverſely as the angular velocities round
                    them ; and the angular velocity round this new axis is to that round one of the
                    primitive axes as the fine of inclination of the two primitive axes is to the
                    line of the inclination of the new axis to the other primitive axis.</p>
                <p>When we ſay that we owe the enunciation of this theorem to P. Friſi, we grant at
                    the ſame time that ſomething like it has been ſuppoſed or aſſumed by other
                    authors. Newton ſeems to have conſidered it as true, and even evident, in
                    homogeneous ſpheres ; and this has been tacitly acquieſced in by the authors who
                    followed him in the problem of the preceſſion. Inferior writers have careleſsly
                    aſſumed it as a truth. Thus Nollet, Graveſande, and others, in their
                    contrivances for exhibiting experiments for illuſtrating the compoſition of
                    vortices, proceeded on this aſſumption. Even authors of more ſcrupulous reſeareh
                    have ſatisſied themſelves with a very imperfect proof. Thus Mr Landen, in his
                    excellent diſſertation on rotatory motion, Philoſophical Tranſactions, Vol.
                    LXVII. contents himſelf with ihow-mg, that, by the equality and oppoſite
                    directions of the motions round the axes A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and B <hi
                        rend="italic"> b,</hi> the point C will be at reſt, and from thence
                    concludes that CG <hi rend="italic">c</hi> will be the new axis of rotation.
                    But this is exceedingly haſty (note alſo, that this diſſertation was many years
                    poſte-rior to that of P. Friſi) : For although the ſeparate motions of the point
                    C may be equal and oppoſite, it is by no means either a mathematical or a
                    mechanical conſequence that the body will turn round the axis C <hi
                        rend="italic"> c.</hi></p>
                <p>In order that the point C may remain at reſt, it is neceſſary that all
                    tendencies to motion be annihilated : this is not even thought of in making the
                    aſſumption. Friſi has ſhown, that in the motion of every particle· round the
                    axis C c, there is involved a motion round the two axes A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and B <hi rend="italic">b <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> with the velocities <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b ;</hi> and it is a conſequence of this, and of this only, that the impulſes which
                    would ſeparately produce the rotations of every particle round A <hi
                        rend="italic"> a</hi> and B <hi rend="italic">b</hi> will, either in
                    ſucceſſion or in conjunction, produce a rotation round Cλ Moreover, Mr Landen’s
                    not having attended to this, has led him, as we imagine, into a miſtake refpe ⅜β
                    the velocity with which the axis changes its poſition ; and though his proceſs
                    exhibits the path of evagation with accuracy, we apprehend that it does not
                    aſſign the true times of the axes arriving at particular points of this path.</p>
                <p>It follows from this propoſition, that if every particle of a body, whether
                    ſolid or fluid, receives in one inſtant a ſeparate impulſe, competent to the
                    production of a motion of the particle round an axis wfith a certain angular
                    velocity, and another impulſe competent to the production of a motion round
                    another axis with a certain velocity*, the combined effect of all theſe
                    impulſions will be a motion of the whole ſyſtem round a third axis given in
                    poſition, with an angular velocity which is alſo given : and this motion will
                    obtain without any ſe-paration or diſunion of parts ; for we ſee that a motion
                    round two axes conſtitute a motion round a third axis in every particle, and no
                    ſeparation would take place although the ſyſtem were incoherent like a main of
                    fand, except by the action of the centrifugal forces ariſing from rotation. Mr
                    Simpſon therefore erred in his ſolution of the problem of the preceſſion, by
                    ſuppo-ſing another force neceſſary for enabling the particles of the fluid
                    ſpheroid to accompany the equator when diſplaced from its former ſituation. The
                    very force which makes the diſplacement produces the accompaniment, as far as it
                    obtains, which we ſhall ſee preſent-ly is not to the extent that Mr Simpſon and
                    other authors who treat this problem have ſuppoſed.</p>
                <p>For the ſame reaſon, if a body be turning round any axis, and every particle in
                    one inſtant get an impulſe preciſely ſuch as is competent to p∣oduce a given
                    angular velocity round another axis, the body will turn, round a third axis
                    given in poſition, with a given angular velocity : for it is indifferent (as it
                    is in the ordinary compoſition of motion) whether the forces act on a particle
                    at once or in lucceſſion. The final motion is the ſame both in reſpect of
                    direction and velocity.</p>
                <p>Laſtly, when a rigid body acquires a rotation round an axis by the action of an
                    impulſe on one part of it, and at the ſame time, or afterwards, gets an impulſe
                    on any part which, alone, would have produced a certain rotation round another
                    axis, the effect of the combined actions will be a rotation round a third axis,
                    in terms of this propoſition ; for when a rigid body acquires a motion round an
                    axis, not by the ſimultaneous impulſe of the preciſely competent force on each
                    particle, but by an impulſe on one part, <hi rend="italic">there has been
                        propagated tβ every particle</hi> (by means of the connecting forces) an

                    an impulſe which makes it actually turn round another axis C r, there <hi
                        rend="italic"> has been propagated to each particle</hi> a force preciſely
                    competent to produce, not the motion, but the <hi rend="italic">change</hi> of
                    motion which takes place in that particle, that is, a force which, when
                    compounded with the inherent force of its primitive motion, produces the new
                    motion ; that is (by this theorem), a force which alone would have cauſed it to
                    turn round a third axis B <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> with a rotation making the
                    other conſtituent of the actual rotation round C <hi rend="italic">c.</hi></p>
                <p>This muſt be conſidered as one of the moſt important propofitions in dynamics,
                    anti gives a great extenſion to the doctrine of the compofition of motion. We
                    ſee that rotations are compounded in the ſame manner as other motions, and it is
                    extremely eaſy to diſcover the compofition. We have only to ſuppoſe a ſphere
                    deſeribed round the centre of the body ; and the equator of this ſphere
                    correſponding to any primitive poſition of the axis of rotation gives us the
                    direction and velocity of the particles ſituated in it. Let another great circle
                    cut this equator in any point ; it will be the equator oſ another rotation. Set
                    off an arch of each from the point of interſection, proportional to the angular
                    velocity of each rotation, and complete the ſpherical parallelogram. The great
                    circle, which is the diagonal of this parallelogram, will be the equator of the
                    rotation, which is actually compounded of the other two.</p>
                <p>And thus may any two rotations be compounded. We have given an inſtance of this
                    in the ſolution of the problem of the <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Precession of the Equinoxes,</hi></hi> Vol. XV. p. 463.</p>
                <p>It appears plainly in the demonſtration of this theorem that the axis C <hi
                        rend="italic"> c</hi> is a new line in the body. The change of rotation is
                    not accompliſhed by a transference ' of the poles and equator of the former
                    rotation to a new ſituation, in which they are again the poles and equator of
                    the rotation ; for we ſee that in the rotation round the axis C <hi
                        rend="italic"> c,</hi> the particle of the body which was formerly the pole
                    A is deſeribing a circle round the axis C <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> Not
                    knowing this compofition of rotations, Newton, Walmefly, Simpſon, and other
                    celebrated mathematicians, imagined, that the axis of the earth’s rotation
                    remained the fame, but changed its poſition. In this they were confirmed by the
                    conſtancy of the obſerved latitudes of places on the ſurface of the earth. But
                    the axis of the earth’s rotation really changes its place, and the poles ſhift
                    through different points of its ſurface ; but theſe different points are too
                    near each other to</p>
                <p>make the change ſenſible to the niceſt obſervation.</p>
                <p>It would ſeem to rtſult from theſe obſervations, that it is impoſſible that the
                    axis of rotation can change its poſition in abſolute ſpace without changing its
                    poſition in the body, contrary to what we∙ experience in a thouſand familiar
                    inſtances ; and indeed this is impoſſible by any one change. We cannot by the
                    impulſe of any one force make a body which is turning round the axis Aa change
                    its poſition and turn.round the ſame material axis brought into the poſition C
                    r. In the ſame way that a body muſt paſs through a ſeries of intermediate
                    points, in going from one end of a line to the other, ſo it· muſt acquire an
                    infinite ſeries of intermediate rotations (each of them momentary) before the
                    fame material axis paſſes into another poſition, ſo as to become an. axis’ of
                    rotation. A momentary impulſe may make a great change of the poſition of the
                    axis of rotation, as it may make in the velocity of a rectilineal motion. Thus
                    although the rotation round A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be indefinitely ſmall,
                    if another equally ſmall rotation be impreſſed round an axis B <hi rend="italic"
                        > b</hi> perpendicular to A <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the axis will at
                    once ſhift to C <hi rend="italic">c</hi> half way between them ; but a
                    ſucceſſion of rotations is necefl'ary for carrying the primitive material axis
                    into a new poſition, where it is again an axis. This transference, however, is
                    poſſible, but gradual, and muſt be accompliſhed by a <hi rend="italic">continuation</hi> of impulſes totally different from what we would at firſt
                    ſuppoſe. In order that A may paſs from A to C, it is not enough that it gets an
                    impulſe in the direction AC. Such an impulſe would carry it thither, if the body
                    had not been whirling round A <hi rend="italic">a</hi> by the mere
                    perſeverance of matter in its ſtate of motion; but when the body is already
                    whirling round A <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the particles in the circle IP <hi
                        rend="italic"> i</hi> are moving in the circumference of that circle ; and
                    ſince that circle alſo partakes of the motion given to A, every particle in it
                    muſt be <hi rend="italic">incejſant-ly</hi> deflected from the path in which
                    it is moving. The <hi rend="italic">continual</hi> agency of a force is
                    therefore neceſſary for this purpoſe ; and if this force be diſeontinued, the
                    point A will immediately quit the plane of the arch AC, along which we are
                    endeavouring to move it, and will ſtart up.</p>
                <p>This is the theorem which we formerly ſaid would enable us to overcome the
                    difficulties in the inveſtigation of the axis oſ rotation.</p>
                <p>Thus we can diſcover what Mr Landen calls the evagations of the poles of
                    rotation by the action of cen∙ , trifugal forces: For in fig. 16. the known
                    velocity of∣ the ball A and the radius AC of its circle of rotation' will give
                    us the centrifugal force by which the balls <hi rend="italic">tend</hi> to
                    turn in the plane DA&lt;∕BD. This gives the, axis D <hi rend="italic">d</hi> a tendency to move in a plane perpendicular to the plane of the figure ;
                    and its ſeparation from the poles 1&gt; and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> does
                    not depend on the ſeparation of the connecting rod A B from its preſent
                    inclination to D <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> but on the angle which the ſpiral
                    path of the ball makes with the plane of a circle of rotation round <hi
                        rend="italic"> Dd.</hi> The diſtance of the new poles from D and <hi
                        rend="italic"> d</hi> is an arch of a circle which meaſures the angle made
                    by the ſpiral w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ith the . circle of rotation, round the
                    primitive axis. This-wall gradually increaſe, and the mathematical axis of
                    rotation will be deſeribing a ſpiral round D and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> gradually ſeparating from , theſe points, and again approaching them, and
                    coinciding with them again, at the time that the balls themſelves are moſt of
                    all removed from their primitive ſituation, namely, when A is in the place of B.</p>
                <p>The ſame theorem·'alio, enables us to-find the inci-. pient axis of rotation in
                    the complicated caſes which <hi rend="sup">1</hi> are almoſt inaceeſſible by-
                    means oſ the elementary prin-' ciples of rotation.</p>
                <p>Thus, when the centres of oſcillation and-percuſſion do not coincide,, as we
                    ſuppoſed in fig. 5. and 12. .Suppoſe, firſt,.that they do coincide, and find the
                    poſition of the axis.a <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and the angular .velocity of
                    the rotation. Then find the centre of percuſſion, the axis P <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and the momentum.round it, and the angular velocity which this
                    momentum would produce. Thus we have obtained tw <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> o
                    rotations round given axes, and with given angular velocities. Compound theſe
                    rotations by this theorem, and we obtain the required poſition of the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r03-0526" facs="gri_33125011196389_0532.tif"/>
                <p>true incipient axis of rotation, and the angular velocity, without the intricate
                    proceſs which would otherwiſe have been neceſſary.</p>
                <p>• If the body is of ſuch a ſhape, that the forces in the plane DCG do not
                    balance each other, we ſhall then diſcover a momentum round an axis
                    perpendicular to this plane. Compound this rotation in the ſame manner with the
                    rotation round D <hi rend="italic">d.</hi></p>
                <p>And from this ſimple view of the matter we learn (what would be difficult to
                    diſcover in the other way), that when the centre of percuſſion does not coincide
                    with that of rotation, the axis is in the plane DGC, though not perpendicular to
                    PG. But when there is a momentum round an axis perpendicular to this plane, the
                    incipient axis of rotation is neither perpendicular to PC, nor in a plane
                    perpendicular to that paſſing through the centre in the direction of the
                    impelling force.</p>
                <p>We muſt content ourſelves with merely pointing out theſe tracks of inveſtigation
                    to the curious reader, and recommending the cultivation of this moſt fruitful
                    theorem of Father Friſi.</p>
                <p>Theſe are by no means ſpeculations of mere curioſity, intereſting to none but
                    mathematicians : the nobleſt art which is practiſedby man muſt receive great
                    improvement from a complete knowledge of this ſubject. We mean the art of
                    seamanship. A ſhip, the moſt admirable 6f machines, muſt be conſidered as a body
                    in free ſpace, impelled by the winds and waters, and continually moved round
                    ſpontaneous axes of converſion, and inceſſantly checked in theſe movements. The
                    trimming of the ſails, the action of the rudder, the very diſpoſition of the
                    loading, all affect her verſatility. An experienced ſeaman knows by habit how to
                    produce and facilitate theſe motions, and to check or ſtop ſuch as are
                    inconvenient. Experience, without any reflection or knowledge how and why,
                    informs him what poſition qf the rudder produces a deviation from the courſe. A
                    fort of common ſenſe tells him, that, in order to make the ſhip turn her head
                    away from the wind, he muſt increaſe the ſuri'ace or the obliquity of the head
                    ſails, and diminiſh the power of the ſails near the ſtern. A few other
                    operations are dictated to him by this kind of common ſenſe ; but few, even of
                    old ſeamen, can tell why a ſhip has ſuch a tendency to bring her head up in the
                    wind, and why it is ſo neceſſary to crowd the tore part oſ the ſhip with ſails ;
                    fewer ſtill know that a certain ſhifting of the loading will facilitate ſome
                    motions in different caſes ; that the crew of a great ſhip running ſuddenly to a
                    particular place ſhall enable the ſhip tcx accompliih a movement in a ſtormy ſea
                    which could not be done otherwiſe ; and perhaps not one in ten thouſand can tell
                    why this procedure will be ſucceſs-ful. But the mathematical inquirer will ſee
                    all this ; and it would be a moſt valuable acquifition to the public, to have a
                    manual of ſuch propoſitions, deduced from a careful and judicious conſideration
                    of the circumſtances, and freed from that great complication and intricacy which
                    only the learned can unravel, and expreffed in a familiar manner, clothed with
                    ſuch reaſoning as will be intelligible to the unlearned ; and though not
                    accurate, yet perſuaſive. Mr Bouguer, in his <hi rend="italic">'Traité du
                        Navire,</hi> and in his <hi rend="italic">Manœuvre des Paiſſeaux,</hi> has delivered a great deal of uſeful information on this ſubject ; and Mr Bezout
                    has made a very uſeful abſtract of theſe works in his <hi rend="italic">Cours
                        de Mathématique.</hi> But the ſubject iβ left by them in a form far too
                    abſtruſe to be of any general uſe : and it is unfortunately ſo combined with or
                    founded on a falſe theory of the action and reſiſtance of fluids, that many of
                    the propoſitions are totally inconſiſtent with experience, and many maxims of
                    ſea-manſhip are falſe. This has occaſioned theſe doctrines to bc neglected
                    altogether. Few of our proſeſſional ſeamen have the preparatory knowledge
                    neceſſary for improving the ſcience ; but it would be a work of immenſe utility,
                    and would acquire great reputation to the perſon who ſucceſsfully proſecutes it.</p>
                <p>We ſhall mention under the article Seamanship the chief problems, and point out
                    the mechanical principles by which they may be ſolved.</p>
