<p><span class="font1">RAILWAYS. Railways had their origin in the tramways (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q. v. </span><span class="font1">) or wagon-ways which at least as early as the middle&nbsp;of the 16th century were used in the mineral districts of England&nbsp;round Newcastle for the conveyance of coal from the pits to&nbsp;the river Tyne for shipment. It may be supposed that originally&nbsp;the public roads, when worn by the cartage of the coal, were&nbsp;repaired by laying planks of timber at the bottom of the ruts,&nbsp;and that then the planks were laid on the surface of special&nbsp;roads or ways@@<sup>1</sup> formed between the collieries and the river.&nbsp;“ The manner of the carriage, ” says Lord Keeper North in&nbsp;1676, “ is by laying rails of timber... exactly straight and&nbsp;parallel, and bulky carts are made with four rowlets fitting&nbsp;these rails, whereby the carriage is so easy that one horse will&nbsp;draw down four or five chaldrons of coals ” (from 10∙6 to 13∙2&nbsp;tons). The planks were of wood, often beech, a few inches&nbsp;wide, and were fastened down, end to end, on logs of wood, or&nbsp;“ sleepers, ” placed crosswise at intervals of two or three feet.&nbsp;In time it became a common practice to cover them with a thin&nbsp;sheathing or plating of iron, in order to add to their life; this&nbsp;expedient caused more wear on the wooden rollers of the wagons,&nbsp;and, apparently towards the middle of the 18th century, led to&nbsp;the introduction of iron wheels, the use of which is recorded on&nbsp;a wooden railway near Bath in 1734. But the iron sheathing&nbsp;was not strong enough to resist buckling under the passage of the&nbsp;loaded wagons, and to remedy this defect the plan was tried of&nbsp;making the rails wholly of iron. In 1767 the Colebrookdale&nbsp;Iron Works cast a batch of iron rails or plates, each 3 ft. long&nbsp;and 4 in. broad, having at the inner side an upright ledge or&nbsp;flange, 3 in. high at the centre and tapering to a height of&nbsp;2½ in. at the ends, for the purpose of keeping the flat wheels&nbsp;on the track. Subsequently, to increase the strength, a similar&nbsp;flange was added below the rail. Wooden sleepers continued&nbsp;to be used, the rails being secured by spikes passing through&nbsp;the extremities, but about 1793 stone blocks also began to be&nbsp;employed—an innovation associated with the name of Ben-jamin Outram, who, however, apparently was not actuaIly&nbsp;the first to make it. This type of rail (fig. 1) was&nbsp;known as the plate-rail, tramway-plate or barrow-way-plate—names which are preserved in the&nbsp;modern term “ platelayer ” applied to the men&nbsp;who lay and maintain the permanent way of a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">railway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another form of rail, distinguished as the edge-rail, was first used on a line which was opened between Loughborough and Nanpantan in 1789.&nbsp;This line was originally designed as a “ plate-way ” on the Outram system, but objections were&nbsp;raised to rails with upstanding ledges or flanges&nbsp;being laid on the turnpike road which was crossed&nbsp;at Loughborough on the level. In other cases&nbsp;this difficulty was overcome by paving or “ causewaying ” the road up to the level of the top of the flanges, but</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">on this occasion William Jessop, of the Butterley Iron Works, near Derby, proposed to get over it by laying down two plates&nbsp;of iron, perfectly flat and level with the road but each&nbsp;having on its outside a groove ¾ in. wide and ¾ in. deep to&nbsp;control extra guiding wheels which were to be of somewhat&nbsp;larger diameter than the bearing wheels and to be affixed&nbsp;to them. The rest of the line was laid with what were substantially plate-rails placed on their edge instead of flat. These&nbsp;were cast in 3 ft. lengths, of a double-flanged section, and for the&nbsp;sake of strength they were “ fish-bellied ” or deeper in the&nbsp;middle than at the ends. At one end of each rail the flange&nbsp;spread out to form a foot which rested on a cross sleeper, being&nbsp;secured to the latter by a spike passing through a central hole,&nbsp;and above this foot the rail was so shaped as to form a socket&nbsp;into which was fitted the end of the next rail. Each length was&nbsp;thus fastened to a sleeper at one end, while at the other it was&nbsp;socketed into the end of its fellow. This method, however,&nbsp;was not found satisfactory: the projecting feet were liable&nbsp;to be broken off, and in 1799 or 1800 Jessop abandoned them,&nbsp;using instead separate cast-iron sockets or chairs, which were&nbsp;fastened to the sleepers and in which the rails were supported&nbsp;in an upright position. In the first instance he proposed to&nbsp;place the guiding wheels outside the bearing wheels, and the&nbsp;Nanpantan line was laid on this plan with a width of 5 ft.&nbsp;between the guide wheels; but before it was opened he decided&nbsp;not only to cast the guiding wheels and bearing wheels in one&nbsp;piece but also to put the former inside the rails, arguing that&nbsp;with this arrangement the edge-rails themselves would keep&nbsp;the wheels in position on the axles, whereas with that first contemplated fastenings would have been required for them (fig. 2).&nbsp;Jessop thus produced what was virtually the flanged&nbsp;wheel of to-day, having the flanges inside the rails,&nbsp;and further, it is said, established what has become&nbsp;the standard gauge of the world, 4 ft. 8½ in., or 5 ft.&nbsp;minus the width of two of his rails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These two systems of constructing railways— the plate-rail and the edge-rail—continued to&nbsp;exist side by side until well on in the 19th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In most parts of England the plate-rail was preferred, and it was used on the Surrey iron railway, from&nbsp;Wandsworth to Croydon, which, sanctioned by&nbsp;parliament in 1801, was finished in 1803, and was&nbsp;the first railway available to the public on payment&nbsp;of tolls, previous lines having all been private and&nbsp;reserved exclusively for the use of their owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In South Wales again, where in 1811 the railways in connexion with canals, collieries and iron and copper&nbsp;works had a total length of nearly 150 miles, the&nbsp;plate-way was almost universal. But in the north of England&nbsp;and in Scotland the edge-rail was held in greater favour,&nbsp;and by the third decade of the century its superiority was&nbsp;generally established. The manufacture of the rails them-selves was gradually improved. By making them in longer&nbsp;lengths a reduction was effected in the number of joints—&nbsp;always the weakest part of the line; and another advance&nbsp;consisted in the substitution of wrought iron for cast iron,&nbsp;though that material did not gain wide adoption until&nbsp;after the patent for an improved method of rolling rails&nbsp;granted in 1820 to John Birkinshaw, of the Bedlington&nbsp;Ironworks, Durham. His rails were wedge-shaped in section,&nbsp;much wider at the top than at the bottom, with the inter-mediate portion or web thinner still, and he recommended&nbsp;that they should be made 18 ft. long, even suggesting that&nbsp;several of them might be welded together end to end to form&nbsp;considerable lengths. They were supported on sleepers by&nbsp;chairs at intervals of 3 ft., and were fish-bellied between&nbsp;the points of support. As used by George Stephenson on the&nbsp;Stockton &amp; Darlington and Whitstable &amp; Canterbury lines&nbsp;they weighed 28 ℔ per yard. On the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway they were usually 12 ft. or 15 ft. long and&nbsp;weighed 35 ℔ to the yard, and they were fastened by iron&nbsp;wedges to chairs weighing 15 or 17 ℔ each. The chairs were</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
