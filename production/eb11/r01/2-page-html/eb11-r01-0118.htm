<p><span class="font2">RAMUSIO. The noble Italian family of Ramusio—the spelling adopted in the publication of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Navigations,</span><span class="font2"> though&nbsp;it is also written Ramnusio, Rhamnusio, Rannusio, &amp;c.—was&nbsp;one of note for literary and official ability during at least four&nbsp;generations. Its original home was in Rimini, and the muni-cipality of that city has within the last few years set up a&nbsp;tablet on the town hall bearing an inscription which may be&nbsp;thus rendered: “ The municipality of Rimini here records the&nbsp;claim of their city to the family of the Ramusios, adorned&nbsp;during the 15th and 16th centuries by the illustrious jurist&nbsp;and man of letters Paolo the elder, who rendered the work of&nbsp;Valturius, our fellow-citizen, into the vernacular; by the&nbsp;physician Girolamo, a most successful student of Oriental&nbsp;tongues, and the first to present Europe with a translation of&nbsp;Avicenna; and by Giovanni Battista, cosmographer to the&nbsp;Venetian republic and secretary to the Council of Ten, who&nbsp;bequeathed to the world that famous collection of voyages and&nbsp;travels, regarded in his own day as a marvellous work, and&nbsp;still full of authority among all civilized nations.’’</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Paolo the Elder </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">(c.</span><span class="font2"> 1443-1506), the first of those thus commemorated, migrated in 1458 from Rimini to Venice,&nbsp;where he obtained full citizenship, studied law and became&nbsp;a member of the magistracy, filling the offices of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vicario,</span><span class="font2"> of&nbsp;judicial assessor, and of criminal judge under various administrators of the Venetian provinces on the continent. He con-tinued, however, to maintain relations with the Malatesta&nbsp;princes of his native city, and in 1503 negotiated with them&nbsp;the cession of Rimini to the republic. The wife of Paolo,&nbsp;bearing the singular name of Tomyris Macachio, bore him&nbsp;three sons and four daughters. Paolo died at Bergamo on&nbsp;19th August 1506 at the age of sixty-three, and was buried&nbsp;in S. Agostino at Padua. Paolo was the author of a variety&nbsp;of legal treatises and the like, and also published at Verona in&nbsp;1483 both a corrected edition and an Italian translation of a&nbsp;once famous book, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Valturius, De re militari,</span><span class="font2"> dedicating both to&nbsp;Pandolfo Malatesta of Rimini.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Girolamo (1450-1486), younger brother of Paolo, had a notable history. After he had studied medicine at Padua&nbsp;public suspicion was roused against him in connexion with the&nbsp;death of a lady with whom he had had some love passages, and&nbsp;this ran so high that he was fain, by help of his brother Paolo,&nbsp;to whom he transferred his property, to make his escape (about&nbsp;1481-1483) to Syria and to take up his abode at Damascus. In&nbsp;i486 he removed to Beyrout, and died the same year, killed,&nbsp;as the family chronicler relates, by a surfeit of “ certain fruit&nbsp;that we call </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">armellini</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">albicocche,</span><span class="font2"> but which in that country&nbsp;are known as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mazzafranchi”</span><span class="font2"> a title which English sailors in&nbsp;southern regions still give to apricots in the vernacular paraphrase of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">killjohns.</span><span class="font2"> During his stay in Syria Girolamo studied&nbsp;Arabic and made a new translation of Avicenna, or rather, we&nbsp;may assume, of some part of that author’s medical works (the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Canon ?). </span><span class="font2">It was, however, by no means the first such translation, as is erroneously alleged in the Rimini inscription, for&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Canon</span><span class="font2"> had been translated by Gerard of Cremona (d. 1187),&nbsp;and this version was frequently issued from the early press.&nbsp;Girolamo’s translation was never printed, but was used by&nbsp;editors of versions published at Venice in 1579 and 1606. Other&nbsp;works of this questionable member of the house of Ramusio&nbsp;consisted of medical and philosophical tracts and Latin poems,&nbsp;some of which last were included in a collection published at&nbsp;Paris in 1791.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gian Battista (1485-1557), the eldest son of Paolo Ramusio and Tomyris Macachio, was bom at Treviso in 1485 (June 20).&nbsp;Having been educated at Venice and at Padua, at an early</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">age he entered the public service (1505), becoming in 1515 secretary of the senate and in 1533 secretary of the Council&nbsp;of Ten. He also served the republic in various missions to&nbsp;foreign states, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> to Rome, to Switzerland and to France,&nbsp;travelling over much of the latter country by special desire&nbsp;of the king, Louis XII. He also on several occasions filled&nbsp;the office of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cancellier grande.</span><span class="font2"> In 1524 he married Franceschina,&nbsp;daughter of Francesco Navagero, a noble—a papal dispensation&nbsp;being required on account of her being cousin to his mother&nbsp;Tomyris. By this lady he had one son, Paolo. In his old&nbsp;age Ramusio resigned the secretaryship and retired to the&nbsp;Villa Ramusia, a property on the river Masanga, in the province&nbsp;of Padua, which had been bestowed on his father in 1504&nbsp;in recognition of his services in the acquisition of Rimini the&nbsp;year before. The delights of this retreat are celebrated in the&nbsp;poems and letters of several of Gian Battista’s friends. He&nbsp;also possessed a house at Padua in the Strada del Patriarcato,&nbsp;a mansion noted for its paintings and for its collection of ancient&nbsp;sculpture and inscriptions. These, too, are commemorated&nbsp;by various writers. A few days before his death Ramusio&nbsp;removed to this house in Padua, and there died, 10th of July&nbsp;1557, at the age of seventy-two. He was, by his own desire,&nbsp;buried at Venice, in the tomb which he had made for his&nbsp;mother, in Santa Maria dell’ Orto. His wife’s death had&nbsp;occurred in 1536. In the work called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Museum Mazzuchdlianum&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(Venice, 1761, vol. i. pl. lxiv. No. 6) there is represented a&nbsp;16th-century medal of Ramusio, which looks a genuine likeness, and a bronze example of which, without the reverse,@@<sup>3</sup> is&nbsp;preserved in St Mark’s Library. There was a portrait of him,&nbsp;represented as in conversation with Andrea Gradenigo, in&nbsp;the Sala del Maggior Consiglio, but in 1577 this perished in a&nbsp;fire, as did also a portrait of his father, Paolo. A professed&nbsp;portrait of Gian Battista by Francesco Grisellini, in the Sala&nbsp;dello Scudo, appears to be, like the companion portrait of&nbsp;Marco Polo, a work of fancy. A public nautical school at&nbsp;Rimini received from the government the title of the Istituto&nbsp;Ramusio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ramusio was evidently a general favourite, as he was free from pushing ambition, modest and ingenuous, and, if it be&nbsp;safe to judge from some of the dissertations in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Navigationi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">must have been a delightful companion; both his friend&nbsp;Giunti and the historian Giustiniani@@<sup>4</sup> speak of him with the&nbsp;strongest affection. He had also a great reputation for&nbsp;learning. Before he was thirty Aldus Manutius the elder&nbsp;dedicated to him his edition of Quintilian (1514); a few years&nbsp;later (1519) Francesco Ardano inscribed to him an edition of&nbsp;Livy, and in 1528 Bernardino Donati did the like with his&nbsp;edition of Macrobius and Censorinus. To Greek and Latin&nbsp;and the modern languages of southern Europe he is said to&nbsp;have added a knowledge of “ Oriental tongues,’’ but there&nbsp;is no evidence how far this went, unless we accept as such a&nbsp;statement that he was selected in 1530 on account of this&nbsp;accomplishment to investigate the case of one David, a Hebrew,&nbsp;who, claiming to be of the royal house of Judah, wished to&nbsp;establish himself at Venice outside of the Ghetto.@@<sup>5</sup> But&nbsp;Ramusio had witnessed from his boyhood the unrolling of&nbsp;that great series of discoveries by Portugal and Spain in East&nbsp;and West, and the love of geography thus kindled in him</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@6</sup> Ramusio’s report on this Hebrew is preserved in the diaries of Marcus Sanudo, and is printed by Cigogna. It is curious. David&nbsp;represented himself as a prince of the Bedouin Jews who haunt the&nbsp;caravan-road between Damascus and Medina ; he claimed to be not&nbsp;only a great warrior covered with wounds but great also in the law&nbsp;and in the cabala, and to have been inspired by God to conduct the&nbsp;dispersed tribes to the Holy Land and to rebuild the temple. In&nbsp;this view he had visited Prester John and the Jews in his kingdom,&nbsp;and then various European countries. David was dark in complexion,&nbsp;“ like an Abyssinian,&quot; lean, dry and Arab-like, well dressed and&nbsp;well attended, full of pretensions to supernatural cabalistic knowledge, and with enthusiastic ideas about his mission, whilst the Jews&nbsp;regarded him as a veritable Messiah.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
