It is a perennial plant, with ſtalks trailing upon the ground, and are ſeldom more than two inches long, garniſhed with ſmall oval leaves ſtanding oppoſite, which lie over one another like the ſcales of fiſh: they are of a brown green colour, and have a reſemblance of heath. The flowers are produced at the end of the branches, of a deep blue; and thus make a pretty appearance during their continuance, which is great part of March and the beginning of April. All theſe ſpecies are eaſily propagated by offsets, or by parting their roots.</p><p>@@S<hi rend="smallcaps">AXO-Grammaticus,</hi> deſcended from an illuſtrious Daniſh @@(<hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>) family, was born about the middle of the 12th century. Stephens, in his edition of Saxo-Grammaticus, printed at Soroë, indubitably proves, that he muſt have been alive in 1156, but cannot aſcertain the exact place and time of his birth. See Stephens’s <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> to the Notes on Saxo-Grammaticus, p. 8, to 24; alſo Holberg, vol. i. p. 269.; and Mallet’s North. Antiq. vol. i. p. 4. On account of his uncommon learning, Saxo was diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi rend="italic">Grammaticus.</hi> He was provoſt of the cathedral church of Roſkild, and warmly patronized by the learned and warlike Abſalon, the celebrated archbiſhop of Lunden, at whoſe inſtigation he wrote the Hiſtory of Denmark. His epitaph, a dry panegyric in bad Latin verſes, gives no account of the era of his death, which happened, according to Stephens, in 1204. His hiſtory, conſiſting of 16 books, begins from the earlieſt account of the Daniſh annals, and concludes with the year 1186. @@ According to the opinion of an accurate writer, the firſt part, which relates to the origin of the Danes, and the reigns of the ancient kings, is full of fables; but the eight laſt books, and particularly thoſe which regard the events of his own times, deferve the utmoſt credit. He wrote in</p><p>Latin; the ſtyle, if we conſider the barbarous age in which he flouriſhed, is in general extremely elegant, but rather too poetical for hiſtory. Mallet, in his <hi rend="italic">Hiſtoire de Dannemarc,</hi> vol. i. p. 182, ſays, “that Sperling, a writer of great erudition, has proved, in contradiction to the aſſertions of Stephens and others, that Saxo- Grammaticus was ſecretary to Abſalon; and that the Saxo provoſt of Roſkild was another perſon, and lived earlier.”</p><p>SAXONY, the name of two circles of the German empire, an electorate, and a duchy of the fame. The lower circle is bounded to the ſouth by the circle of Upper Saxony, and a part of that of the Upper Rhine; to the north, by the duchy of Sleſwick, belonging to the king of Denmark, and the Baltic; to the well, by the circle of Weſtphalia and the north ſea; and to the eaſt by the circle of Upper Saxony. The ſtates belonging to it are the dukes and princes of Magdeburg and Bremen, Zell, Grubenhagen, Calenburg, Wolfenbuttle, Halberſtadt, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklen- burg-Guſtro, Holſtein-Gluckſtadt, Holſtein-Gottorf,</p><p>Hildeſheim, Saxe-Lawenburg; the archbiſhopric of Lubeck; the principalities of Schwerin, Ratzeburg, Blankenburg, Ranzau; the imperial cities of Lubeck, Gotzlar, Muhlhaufen, Nordhauſen, Hamburgh, and Bremen. The dukes of Bremen and Magdeburg are alternately directors and ſummoning princes; but, ever ſince the year 1682, the diets which uſed generally to be held at Brunſwick or Lunenburg have been diſcontinued. Towards the army of the empire, which, by a decree of the empire in 1681, was ſettled at 40,000 men, this circle was to furniſh 1322 horſemen and 2707 foot; and of the 300,000 florins granted to the imperial cheſt in 1707, its quota was 31,271 florins; both which aſſeſſments are the ſame with thoſe of Upper Saxony, Burgundy, Swabia, and Weſtphalia. This circle at preſent nominates only two aſſeſſors in the chamber- judicatory of the empire, of one of which the elector of Brunſwick-Lunenburg has the nomination, who muſt be a Lutheran, and is the ninth in rank. The inhabitants of this circle are almoſt all Lutherans.</p><p>The circle of Upper Saxony is bounded by that of Franconia, the Upper Rhine, and Lower Saxony; and alſo by the Baltic ſea, Pruſſia, Poland, Sileſia, Luſatia, and Bohemia. It is of great extent, and contains the following ſtates, viz. the electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Eifenach, Saxe-Cobourg, Saxe-Gotha, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Querfurt, the Hither and Farther Pomerania, Camin, Anhalt, Quidlen- burg, Gernrode, Walkenried, Schwarzburg, Sonderſhauſen, Schwarzburg-Rudolſtadt, Mansfeld, Stolberg, Barby, the counts of Reuſſen, and the counts of Schonberg. No diets have been held in this circle ſince the year 1683. The elector of Saxony has always been the ſole ſummoning prince and director of it. Moſt of the inhabitants profeſs the Proteſtant religion. When the whole empire furniſhes 40,000 men, the quota of this circle is 1322 horſe and 2707 foot. Of the 300, 000 florins granted by the empire in 1707, it contributed only 31,271 florins, 28 kruitzers, being rated no higher than thoſe of Weſtphalia, Lower Saxony, Swabia, and Burgundy, though it is much larger. Agreeable to a reſolution and regulation in 1654, this circle nominates now only two aſſeſſors of the chamber-court.</p><p>The electorate conſiſts of the duchy of Saxony, the greateſt part of the margravate of Meiſſen, a part of the Vogtland, and the northern half of the landgravate of Thuringia. The Luſatias alſo, and a part of the country of Henneberg, belong to it, but are no part of this circle. The ſoil of the electoral dominions lying in this circle is in general exceeding rich and fruitful, yielding corn, fruits, and pulſe in abundance, together with hops, flax, hemp, (tobacco, aniſeed, wild ſaffron, wood; and in ſome places woad, wine, coals, porcelain clay, terra ſigillata, fullers-earth, fine ſhiver, various forts of beautiful marble, ſerpentine ſtone, and almoſt all the different ſpecies of precious ſtones. Sulphur alſo, alum, vitriol, fand, and free-stone, ſalt-ſprings, amber, turf, cinnabar, quickſilver, antimony, biſmuth, arſenic, cobalt, and other minerals, are found in it.
