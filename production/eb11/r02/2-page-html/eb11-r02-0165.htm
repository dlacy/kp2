<p><span class="font2">RETINITE (Gr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ρητίνη,</span><span class="font2"> resin), a general name applied to various resins, particularly those from beds of brown coal,&nbsp;which are near amber in appearance, but contain little or no&nbsp;succinic acid. It may conveniently serve as a generic name,&nbsp;since no two independent occurrences prove to be alike, and&nbsp;the indefinite multiplication of names, no one of them properly&nbsp;specific, is not to be desired.</span></p>

They were a source&nbsp;of trouble and abuse in the 15th and early 16th century (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Livery</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Maintenance).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETORT (Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retorquere,</span><span class="font2"> to twist or turn back), a word used in two distinct meanings: (1) a sharp reply, answer to an&nbsp;argument, statement or charge; (2) a vessel used in chemistry&nbsp;and manufacture. The chemical retort is a flask-shaped or&nbsp;bulbous vessel made of glass, earthenware or metal, with a neck,&nbsp;bent downwards, which leads to a receiver; such vessels are&nbsp;particularly used for distillation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font2"> The name is also given&nbsp;to the apparatus, varying in size and shape, used in the distinctive distillation of various substances, such as coal, in the&nbsp;manufacture of gas </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETREAT (O.

In military&nbsp;usage <sup>u</sup> retreat ” is also the term for a signal, given by bugle&nbsp;and drum at or about sunset. It is the last general signal&nbsp;before “ tattoo.” In religious usage, a “ retreat ” is a period&nbsp;and place set apart for prayer, self-examination and other&nbsp;spiritual exercises. Such “ retreats ” conducted by a director&nbsp;have long been the practice in the Roman Church. They were&nbsp;introduced into the English Church by Pusey. The word is&nbsp;also used of an institution or home where insane persons or&nbsp;habitual inebriates may be treated. For the law relating to&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> licensed retreats ” for inebriates, see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Inebriety, Law</span><span class="font2"> or.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETRENCHMENT (Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retrenchement,</span><span class="font2"> an old form of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retranchement,</span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retrancher,</span><span class="font2"> to cut down, cut short), an act&nbsp;of cutting down or reduction, particularly of expenditure;&nbsp;the word is familiar in this, its most general sense, from the&nbsp;motto of the GIadstonian Liberal party in British politics,&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> Peace, Retrenchment and Reform.” A special technical use of&nbsp;the term is in fortification, where it is applied to a work or series&nbsp;of works constructed in rear of existing defences in order to bar&nbsp;the further progress of the enemy should he succeed in breaching or storming these. A modern example may be found in&nbsp;the siege of Port Arthur in 1904. When early in thc siege&nbsp;Fort Panlung fell into the hands of the Japanese, the Russians&nbsp;connected up the two adjacent first-line forts to a fort in the rear&nbsp;by means of new works, the whole forming a rough semicircle&nbsp;facing tbe lost fort. This retrenchment prevented the Japanese&nbsp;from advancing, and remained in the hands of the defenders&nbsp;up to the fall of the whole line of forts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETRO-COGNITION (from tat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retro,</span><span class="font2"> back, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cognitio,</span><span class="font2"> the acquiring of knowledge), a word invented by F. W. H. Myers&nbsp;to denote a supposed faculty of acquiring direct knowledge&nbsp;of the past beyond the reach of the subject’s ordinary memory.&nbsp;The alleged manifestations of the faculty are of several kinds,&nbsp;of which the most important are as follows: (1) There are&nbsp;many recorded cases in which an impression has been received&nbsp;in dream or vision representing some recent event—shipwreck,&nbsp;death-bed scene, railway accident—outside the knowledge of&nbsp;the percipient. (2) Analogous to the transmission of habits&nbsp;and physical peculiarities in particular families, it is alleged&nbsp;that there are also cases of the transmission of definite memories&nbsp;of scenes and events in the life of some ancestor. (3) It is&nbsp;asserted that pictures of past scenes may bc caUed up in certain&nbsp;cases by the presence of a material object associated with those&nbsp;scenes—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> a vision of the destruction of Pompeii by a piece&nbsp;of cinder from the buried city, or the scene of a martyrdom&nbsp;by a charred fragment of bone—the percipient being unaware&nbsp;at the time of the nature of the object. For this supposed&nbsp;faculty the American geologist, Professor Denton, has suggested&nbsp;the name <sup>44</sup> psychometry.” There are also cases recorded in&nbsp;which pictures of historical scenes unknown to the seer have&nbsp;been described in the crystal. (4) Some spirit mediums profess&nbsp;to realise incidents belonging to their previous incarnation.&nbsp;Thus Flournoy’s medium, Hélène Smith, represented herself&nbsp;as having been successively incarnated as a Hindoo Princess,&nbsp;Simandini, and as Marie Antoinette, and gave vivid descriptions&nbsp;of scenes in which she had figured in these capacities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will be gathered that the facts afford little warrant for the assumption of a faculty of retro-cognition. The cases described&nbsp;in the first class, though apparently exhibiting knowledge not&nbsp;within the range of the percipient’s ordinary faculties, hardly&nbsp;call for such an extreme hypothesis. In the other cases the result&nbsp;recorded may plausibly be attributed to the imagination of the&nbsp;percipient, working upon hints given by bystanders, or aided&nbsp;by the emergence of forgotten knowledge.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RETZ, SEIGNEURS AND DUKES OF. The district of Retz or Rais, in S. Brittany, belonged in early times to a house&nbsp;which bore its name, and of <sup>l</sup>Svhich the eldest branch became&nbsp;extinct in the 13th century in the Chabot family. From the&nbsp;Chabot family the lordship passed to the Lavais. Gilles de&nbsp;Laval, sire de Retz (1404-1440), the comrade-in-arms of Joan&nbsp;of Arc and marshal of France, gave himself over to the most&nbsp;revolting debauchery, and was strangled and burned at Nantes.&nbsp;The barony of Retz passed successively to the families of&nbsp;Tournemine, Annebaut and Gondi. In 1581 it was erected&nbsp;into a duchy in the peerage of France </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(duché-pairie)</span><span class="font2"> for Albert&nbsp;de Gondi, marshal of France and general of the galleys. Pierre&nbsp;de Gondi, brother of the first duc de Retz, became bishop of&nbsp;Paris in 1570 and cardinal in 1587. He was succeeded by his&nbsp;nephews, Henri (d. 1622) and Jean François de Gondi (d. 1654),&nbsp;for whom the episcopal see of Paris was erected into an archbishopric in 1622, and by his great-nephew, Jean François Paul&nbsp;de Gondi, the famous cardinal de Retz. With the death of the&nbsp;last male of the house of Gondi in 1676 the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">duché-pairie</span><span class="font2"> became&nbsp;extinct; the lordship passed to the house of Neuville-Villeroy.</span></p>

The family was one of those which had been&nbsp;introduced into France by Catherine de’ Medici, but it acquired&nbsp;great estates in Brittany and became connected with the noblest&nbsp;houses of the kingdom. It may be added that Retz himself&nbsp;always spelt his designation <sup>44</sup> Rais.” He was the third son,&nbsp;and according to Tallemant des Réaux was made a knight of&nbsp;Malta on the very day of his birth. The death of his second&nbsp;brother, however, destined him for a closer connexion with the&nbsp;church. The family of Retz had military traditions, but it had&nbsp;also much church influence, and, despite the very unclerical&nbsp;leanings of the future cardinal, which were not corrected by the&nbsp;teachings of his tutor St Vincent de Paul, the intentions of his&nbsp;family never varied respecting him. By unanimous consent&nbsp;his physical appearance was not that of a soldier.
