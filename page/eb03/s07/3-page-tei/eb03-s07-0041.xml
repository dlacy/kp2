Long. 56. 0. It gives name to the country for 100 miles round ; and ſtands on a river of the ſame name, which is navigable for 30 leagues up the country. A ſettlement was formed at Surinam in 1650 by the Dutch, who preſerved poſſeſſion of it ever ſince. The chief trade conſiſts in ſugar, cotton, coffee of an excellent kind, tobacco, flax, skins, and ſome valuable drugs for dyeing. Four hundred and thirty plantations have been already formed on the banks of the Surinam and the adjacent country, which in 1775 yielded 24,120,000 weight of rough ſugar, which were sold in Holland for 347,225 1. Serling ; 15,000,387 lb. weight of coffee, which ſold for 357,538 l. ; 970,000 lb. weight of cotton ; 790,854 lb. weight of cocoa ; 152,844 lb. weight of wood for dyeing. The ſum total of theſe productions amounted to 822,905 Sterling, and was brought into the harbours of the republic in 70 veſſels. The number of ſlaves employed in the ſame year was 60,000, who belonged to 2824 maſters, excluſive of the women and children. The white people were of different countries and different religions.</p><p>Connected with Surinam, we may mention the colonies of Demerary, Iſſequibo, and Berbice, which lie a little to the west. The two firſt ſurrendered to the Britiſh troops in 1781 ; but being left defenceleſs, were retaken by a French frigate. Demerary has lately been taken a second time by the army of Great Britain. It is conſidered as a valuable acquiſition, being a flouriſhing colony. In 1769 there were eſtabliſhed on the banks of the Demerary 130 habitations, in which ſugar, coffee, and cotton were ſucceſsfully cultivated, and ſince that period the number of plantations hath increaſed much.</p><p>Iſſequibo is a very inconſiderable ſettlement. Berbice, which lies between Demerary and Surinam, contains about 104 plantations, most of them ſmall, and ſcattered at great distances from one another upon the banks of the Berbice or of Conje. When Raynal publiſhed the laſt edition of his Hiſtory of Settlements and Trade in the Eaſt and West Indies, the population conſiſted of 7c00 ſlaves of every age and ſex, 250 white men, excluſive of the ſoldiers. The coffee, ſugar, and cotton produced was conveyed to Holland in four or five ſhips, and ſold for about 40 or 50,000 l.</p><p>SURMOUNTED, in heraldry, is when one figure is laid over another.</p><p>SURMULLET. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mullus.</hi></p><p>SURNAME, that which is added to the proper name for diſtinguiſhing perſons and families. It was originally diſtinguiſhed from s<hi rend="italic">irname,</hi> which denotes the name of the sir<hi rend="italic">e</hi> or progenitor : thus Macdonald, Robertſon are firnames expreſſing the ſon of Donald, the ſon of Robert. The word <hi rend="italic">ſurname,</hi> again, signified ſome name ſuperadded to the proper name to diſtinguiſh the individual, as Artaxerxes <hi rend="italic">Longimanus,</hi> Harold <hi rend="italic">Harefoot,</hi> Malcolm <hi rend="italic">Canmore.</hi> From this it is evident that every ſirname was a ſurname, though the reverſe was not ſo. In modern times they are confounded ; and as there is now no occaſion to preſerve the diſtinction, Dr Johnſon has rejected the word s<hi rend="italic">irname</hi> altogether. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Name.</hi></p><p>Surnames were introduced among all nations at an early</p><p>period, and ſeem to have been formed at firſt by adding the name of the father to that of the ſon. This was the practice among the Hebrews, as appears from the scriptures. Caleb is denominated the ſon of Jephunneh, and Joſhua the ſon of Nun. That the ſame thing was cuſtomary among the Greeks, every one who has read the poems of Homer muſt remember. We have an inſtance of it in the very firſt line of the Iliad : Αχιλληος Πηληιαϛεω, "Achilles the ſon of Peleus.”</p><p>This is perhaps the general origin of ſurnames, for it has been common among moſt nations @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p><p>The Romans generally had three names. The firſt called <hi rend="italic">praenomen</hi> anſwered to our Chriſtian name, and was intended to diſtinguiſh the individuals of the ſame family ; the second called <hi rend="italic">nomen</hi> correſponded to the word <hi rend="italic">clan</hi> in Scotland, and was given to all thoſe who were ſprung from the ſame ſtock ; the third called <hi rend="italic">cognomen</hi> expreſſed the particular branch of the tribe or clan from which an individual was ſprung. Thus Publius Cornelius Scipio, <hi rend="italic">Publius</hi> correſponded to our names John, Robert, William ; <hi rend="italic">Cornelius </hi>was the name of the clan or tribe, as Campbell was formerly the name of all the Duke of Argyle’s clients, and Douglas the name of the retainers of the Duke of Hamilton’s progenitors. <hi rend="italic">Scipio</hi> being added, conveyed this information, that Publius, who was of the tribe of the Cornelii, was of the family of the Scipios, one of the branches or families into which that tribe was divided. Reſpecting the three names which were common among the Romans, we may ſay that the firſt was a name and the other two ſurnames.</p><p>Du Cheſne obſerves, that ſurnames were unknown in France before the year 987, when the lords began to aſſume the names of their demeſnes. Camden relates, that they were firſt taken up in England, a little before the conquest, under King Edward the Confeſſor : but he adds, they were never fully eſtabliſhed among the common people till the time of Edward II. ; till then they varied with the father’s name ; if the father, <hi rend="italic">e. gr.</hi> was called <hi rend="italic">Richard,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Roger, </hi>the ſon was called <hi rend="italic">Richardſon,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hodgſon ;</hi> but from that time they were ſettled, ſome ſay, by act of parliament. The oldeſt ſurnames are thoſe we find in Domeſday-Book, moſt of them taken from places, with the addition of <hi rend="italic">de ;</hi> as Godeſeidus <hi rend="italic">de</hi> Mannevilla, Walterus <hi rend="italic">de</hi> Vernon, Robert <hi rend="italic">de </hi>Oyly, &amp;c. Others from their fathers, with <hi rend="italic">filius,</hi> as Gulielmus <hi rend="italic">filius</hi> Oſberni ; others from their offices, as Eudo <hi rend="italic">Dapifer,</hi> Gulielmus <hi rend="italic">Camerarius,</hi> Giſlebertus <hi rend="italic">Cocus,</hi> &amp;c. But the inferior people are noted simply by their Chriſtian names, without any ſurnames at all.</p><p>They ſeem to have been introduced into Scotland in the time of William the Conqueror by the Engliſh who accompanied Edgar Atheling when he fled into that kingdom. Theſe had their proper ſurnames, as Moubray, Lovell, Liſle, uſing the particle <hi rend="italic">de</hi> before them ; which makes it probable that theſe ſurnames had been derived from the lands which their anceſtors or they themſelves had poſſeſſed. In Kenneth Il’s. time in 800. the great men had indeed begun to call their lands by their own names ; but the ordinary diſtinctions then uſed were only perſonal, and did not deſcend to ſucceeding generations, ſuch as thoſe employed by the Hebrews and Greeks : For example, <hi rend="italic">John the son of William</hi> ; or the names of office, as Stewart ; or accidental diſtinctions from complexion or ſtation, as Black,</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a)</hi> This might be ſupported by examples borrowed from many nations. The old Normans uſed <hi rend="italic">Fitz,</hi> which signifies ſon ; as Fitzherbert, Fitzsimmons, the ſon of Herbert, the ſon of Simmons. The Iriſh uſed O <hi rend="italic">;</hi> as O''Neal, the ſon of Neal. The Scotch Highlanders employed <hi rend="italic">Mac ;</hi> as Macdonald, the ſon of Donald. The Saxons added the word <hi rend="italic">ſon</hi> to the end of the father’s name, as Williamſon.</p></body></text></TEI>
