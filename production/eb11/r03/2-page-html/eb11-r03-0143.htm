<p><span class="font1">of his myth; and his myth was, as is evident from what we have already said and quoted, full-grown in the first half of the 14th century. Whatever may have been the immediate genesis of the myth&nbsp;—and it may well be sought in the heartless forest laws—its&nbsp;vitality was assured by the English love of archery and historical&nbsp;repetition. In the rolls of parliament of 1437 mention is made&nbsp;of Piers Venables, a robber who took to the woods “ like as it&nbsp;had been Robin Hood and his meyné.” There are indications&nbsp;that Robin was identified or confused with Robert Locksley, a&nbsp;manslayer of BradfieId in Hallamshire. The former is said to&nbsp;have been bom in “ Merry sweet </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Locksley</span><span class="font1"> town.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But whether he lived or not, and whenever he lived, it is certain that many mythical elements are contained in his story.&nbsp;Both his name and his exploits remind us of the woodland spirit&nbsp;Robin Goodfellow and his merry pranks. He is fond of disguising himself, and devoted to fun and practical jokes. These&nbsp;frolics suggest the wind. “ The whole story,” says Mr H.&nbsp;Bradley, “ is ultimately derived from the great Aryan sun-myth. Robin Hood is Hod, the god of the wind, a form of&nbsp;Woden; Maid Marian is Morgen, the dawn-maiden; Friar Tuck&nbsp;is Toki, the spirit of frost and snow.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The name Robin (a French form from Rob, which is of course a short form for Robert) WOuld serve both for “ the shrewd and&nbsp;knavish sprite ”—the German Knecht Ruprecht (see Grimm’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Teut. Myth.</span><span class="font1"> p. 504, trans. Stallybrass)—and for the bandit (see&nbsp;“ Roberdes Knaues ” in the Prologue of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Piers the Plowman,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1.44, and the note in Warton’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hist, of Eng. Poet.</span><span class="font1"> ii. 95, ed. 1840).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hood</span><span class="font1"> is a very usual dialectal form of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wood,</span><span class="font1"> and in his play&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edward the First,</span><span class="font1"> George Peele actually alludes to the bandit&nbsp;as “ Robin of the Wood.” Mr Gutch thus explains the origin of&nbsp;the name. It is still a common enough surname, of which the&nbsp;earlier shape is Odo (see “ Houdart, ” &amp;c., in Larchey’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diet,&nbsp;des Noms);</span><span class="font1"> notice, too, the name Hudson. But it also reminds&nbsp;one of the German familiar spirit Hudekin, or possibly of the&nbsp;German Witikind (see Wright’s Ewayi </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">on the Middle</span><span class="font1"> Agei, ii.&nbsp;207). Mr Sidney Lee suggests that Robin was a forest elf so&nbsp;called because elves wore hoods (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diet, of National Biography,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">sub; “ Robin Hood ”). How certain it is that the Robin Hood&nbsp;story attracted to it and appropriated other elements is illustrated by its subsequent history—its history after the 14th&nbsp;century. Thus later on we find it connected with the Morris&nbsp;dance; but the Morris dance was not known in England before&nbsp;the 16th century or late in the 15th. The Friar Tuck and&nbsp;Maid Marian elements have been thought to have been introduced for the purpose of these performances, which were held&nbsp;on May-day and were immensely popular (see Latimer’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Frutefull&nbsp;Sermons</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1571), p. 75; also </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paston Letters,</span><span class="font1"> ed. J. Gaird-ner, iii. 89). After 1615, the date of the pageant prepared for&nbsp;the mayoralty of Sir John Jolles, draper, by Anthony Munday&nbsp;and entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Metropolis Coronata,</span><span class="font1"> a peer was imported into it,&nbsp;and the yeoman of the older version was metamorphosed into&nbsp;the earl of Huntingdon, for whom in the following century&nbsp;William Stukeley discovered a satisfactory pedigree! The&nbsp;earl of Huntingdon was probably a nickname for a hunter. At&nbsp;last, with the change of times, the myth ceased growing. Its&nbsp;rise and development and decay deserve a more thorough study&nbsp;than they have yet received.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What perhaps is its greatest interest as we first see it is its expression of the popular mind about the close of the middle&nbsp;ages. Robin Hood is at that time the people’s ideal as Arthur&nbsp;is that of the upper classes. He is the ideal yeoman as Arthur&nbsp;is the ideal knight. He readjusts the distribution of property:&nbsp;he robs the rich and endows the poor. He is an earnest worshipper of the Virgin, but a bold and vigorous hater of monks&nbsp;and abbots. He is the great sportsman, the incomparable&nbsp;archer, the lover of the greenwood and of a free life, brave,&nbsp;adventurous, jocular, open-handed, a protector of women.&nbsp;Observe his instructions to Little John—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">” Loke ye do no housbonde harme That tylleth with his plough ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No more ye shall no good yeman That walketh by grene wode shawe;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nc no knyght ne no squycr That woldc be a good felawc :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These bysshoppes and thysc archebysshoppes Yc shall them bete </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font1">byndc;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The hye sheryfc of Notynghame Hym holde in your mynde.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And we are told—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Robin loved our dcre lady;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For doute of dcdcly synne Woldc he never do company harme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That ony woman was ynne.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">See also Drayton’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Polyolbion,</span><span class="font1"> Song xxvi. The story is localized in Barnsdale and Sherwood, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> between Doncaster and Nottingham. In Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire a host&nbsp;of place-names testify to the popularity of the Robin Hood&nbsp;legend—Robin Hood’s Bay, Robin Hood’s Cave, Robin Hood’s&nbsp;Chase, Robin Hood’s Cup (a well), Robin Hood’s Chair, Robin&nbsp;Hood’s Pricks, and many more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The best collections of Robin Hood poems are those of Ritson (8vo, 1795) and Gutch (2nd cd., 18^7), and of Professor Child in the&nbsp;5th volume of his invaluable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">English and Scotch Popular Ballads&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Boston, 1888). See also Professor F. B. Gummere’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Old English&nbsp;Ballads</span><span class="font1"> (Boston, 1894). The versions in the Percy Folio (edited&nbsp;by Hales and Furnivall, 1867, vol. i.) are unhappily mutilated;&nbsp;but they should be consulted, for they arc all more or less unique,&nbsp;and that on “ Robin Hoode his death ” is of singular interest.&nbsp;The literary and artistic value of many of the Robin Hood ballads&nbsp;cannot be pronounced considerable, but eight of them attain the&nbsp;high-water mark of their class. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Robin Hood and the Monk</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guy&nbsp;of Gisborne</span><span class="font1"> are perhaps the best. There is, howover, real vigour&nbsp;and force in this fragment on the hero’s death. The earliest&nbsp;“ Garland ” was printed in 1670, and in 1678 appeared a prose&nbsp;version which was reprinted by W. J. Thoms in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Early English&nbsp;Prose Romances</span><span class="font1"> (vol. ii., 1858). Mr Lee's memoir in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of National Biography</span><span class="font1"> is extremely erudite, and two valuable&nbsp;articles, contributed by Sir Edward Brabrook to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Antiquary&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">for June and July 1906, might be consulted. See also Stukelcy,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paleographia Britannica,</span><span class="font1"> No. i. 115; Thierry, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Conquête de l’Angleterre</span><span class="font1"> (1830); and J.

<p><span class="font1">ROBIN HOOD’S BAY, a seaside resort in the Whitby parliamentary division of the North Riding of Yorkshire, England, 6| m. S.E. of Whitby by a branch of the North-Eastern railway.&nbsp;The bay itself is a shallow indentation of the coast, and is&nbsp;fringed with high picturesque cliffs, breached in places by steep-sided narrow gullies. The old fishing village overhangs the&nbsp;cliffs, while the more modem watering-place is mostly built a&nbsp;little inland. A fine stretch of sandy shore is exposed at low tide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBINIA, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Locust-Tree,</span><span class="font1"> a genus of about six species native of the United States and Mexico, belonging to the suborder Papilionaceae of the great family Leguminosae. It was&nbsp;named by Linnaeus in honour of Jean Robin (1550-1629),&nbsp;herbalist to the king of France and his son and successor,&nbsp;Vespasien Robin (1579-1660) by whom the best-known species,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Robinia Pseicdacacia,</span><span class="font1"> was introduced into Europe, in the Jardin&nbsp;du Roi at Paris in 1636. This tree, the bastard acacia, or&nbsp;false acacia, and often called erroneously acacia, is now widely&nbsp;cultivated as an ornamental tree in this country and on the&nbsp;European continent. It grows from 30 to 60 ft. high, and&nbsp;bears long, graceful, compound leaves with 9 to 17 bright&nbsp;green oblong leaflets, and white fragrant flowers in loose&nbsp;pendulous racemes, recalling the laburnum in habit. There&nbsp;are many varieties in English gardens varying in the method&nbsp;of growth, the presence or absence of thorns (persistent spinose&nbsp;stipules) on the branches and the colour of the flower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the eastern United States, where it is native, it grows from 70 to 80 ft. high with a trunk 3 or 4 ft. in diameter. It&nbsp;is one of the most valuable timber trees of the American forest.&nbsp;The wood is heavy, very hard, strong, close-grained and durable,&nbsp;and is extensively used in shipbuilding, also for posts and&nbsp;other purposes where durability in contact with the ground is&nbsp;essential.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Like many plants of the same family, the leaves show sleep movement, folding together at night and in dull or wet weather;&nbsp;for this reason it is less injurious than many trees to plants&nbsp;growing in its shade, as the rain is able more quickly to reach&nbsp;the ground beneath.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
