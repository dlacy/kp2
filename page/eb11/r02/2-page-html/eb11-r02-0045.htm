<p><span class="font2">RENAISSANCE, THE.—The “ Renaissance ” or “ Renascence ” is a term used to indicate a well-known but indefinite space&nbsp;of time and a certain phase in the development of Europe.@@<sup>1</sup> On&nbsp;the one hand it denotes the transition from that period of history which we call the middle ages </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> to that which we call&nbsp;modern. On the other hand it implies those changes in the&nbsp;intellectual and moral attitude of the Western nations by which&nbsp;the transition was characterized. If we insist upon the literal&nbsp;and etymological meaning of the word, the Renaissance was a&nbsp;re-birth; and it is needful to inquire of what it was the re-birth.&nbsp;The metaphor of Renaissance may signify the entrance of the&nbsp;European nations upon a fresh stage of vital energy in general,&nbsp;implying a fuller consciousncss and a freer exercise of faculties&nbsp;than had belonged to the medieval period. Or it may mean the&nbsp;resuscitation of simply intellectual activities, stimulated by the&nbsp;rcvival of antique learning and its application to the arts and&nbsp;literatures of modern peoples. Upon our choice between these&nbsp;two interpretations of the word depend important différences in&nbsp;any treatment of the subject. The former has the disadvantage&nbsp;of making it difficult to separate the Renaissance from other&nbsp;historical phases—the Reformation, for example—with which&nbsp;it ought not to be confounded. The latter has the merit of&nbsp;assigning a specific name to a limited series of events and group&nbsp;of facts, which can be distinguished for the purpose of analysis&nbsp;from other events and facts with which they are intimately but&nbsp;not indissolubly connected. In other words, the one definition&nbsp;of Renaissance makes it denote the whole change which came&nbsp;over Europe at the close of the middle ages. The other confines&nbsp;it to what was known by our ancestors as the Revival of Learning.&nbsp;Yet, when we concentrate attention on the recovery of antique&nbsp;culture, we become aware that this was only one phenomenon&nbsp;or symptom of a far wider and more comprehensive alteration&nbsp;in the conditions of the European races. We find it needful to&nbsp;retain both terms, Renaissance and Revival of Learning, and&nbsp;to show the relations between the scries of evcnts and facts which&nbsp;they severally imply. \The Revival of Learning must be regarded&nbsp;as a function of that vital energy, an organ of that mental&nbsp;cvolution, which brought into existence the modern world, with&nbsp;its new conceptions of philosophy and religion, its reawakened&nbsp;arts and sciences, its firmer grasp on the realities of human nature&nbsp;and the world, its manifold inventions and discoveries, its altered&nbsp;political systems, its expansive and progressive forces. Important as the Rcvival of Learning undoubtedly was, there are&nbsp;essential factors in the complex callcd the Renaissance with&nbsp;which it can but remotely be connected. When we analyse the&nbsp;whole group of phenomena which have to be considered, we&nbsp;pcrceive that some of the most essential have nothing or little&nbsp;to do with the recovery of the classics. These are, briefly&nbsp;speaking, the decay of thosc great fabrics, church and empire,&nbsp;which ruled the middle’ages both as ideas and as realities; the&nbsp;development of nationalities and languages; the enfeeblement&nbsp;of the feudal system throughout Europe; the invention and&nbsp;application of paper, the mariner’s compass, gunpowder, and&nbsp;printing; the exploration of continents beyond the ocean; and&nbsp;the substitution of the Copernican for the Ptolemaic system of&nbsp;astronomy. Europe in fact had been prepared for a thoroughgoing metamorphosis before that new ideal of human life and&nbsp;culture which the Revival of Learning brought to light had&nbsp;been made manifest. It had recovered from the confusion consequent upon the dissolution of the ancient Roman empire. The&nbsp;Teutonic tribes had been Christianized, civilizcd and assimilated&nbsp;to the previously Latinized races over whom they excrcised the&nbsp;authority of conquerors. Comparative tranquillity and material&nbsp;comfort had succeeded to discord and rough living. Modern&nbsp;nationalities, defined as separate factors in a common system,&nbsp;were ready to co-operate upon the basis of European federation.&nbsp;The ideas of universal monarchy and of indivisible Christendom,&nbsp;incorporated in the Holy Roman Empire and the Roman&nbsp;Church, had so far lost their hold that scope was offered for the&nbsp;introduction of new theories both of state and church which would&nbsp;have seemed visionary or impious to the medieval mind. It is&nbsp;therefore obvious that some term, wider than Revival of Learning, descriptive of the change which began to pass over Europe&nbsp;in the 14th and 13th centuries, has to be adopted. That of&nbsp;Renaissance, Rinascimento, or Renascence is sufficient for the&nbsp;purpose, though we have to guard against the tyranny of what is&nbsp;after all a metaphor. We must not suffer it to lead us into rhetoric&nbsp;about the deadncss and the darkness of the middle ages, or hamper&nbsp;our inquiry with preconceived assumptions that the re-birth in&nbsp;question was in any true sense a return to the irrecoverable pagan&nbsp;past. Nor must we imagine that there was any abrupt break&nbsp;with the middle ages. On the contrary, the Renaissance was&nbsp;rather the last stage of the middle ages, emerging from ecclesiastical and feudal despotism, developing what was original in&nbsp;medieval ideas by the light of classic arts and letters, holding&nbsp;in itself the promise of the modern world. It was thereforc a&nbsp;period and a process of transition, fusion, preparation, tentative&nbsp;endeavour. And just at this point the real importance of the&nbsp;Revival of Learning may be indicated. That rediscovcry of the&nbsp;classic past restored the confidence in their own faculties to men&nbsp;striving after spiritual freedom; revealed the continuity of&nbsp;history&quot; and the identity of human nature in spite of diverse&nbsp;creeds and different customs; held up for emulation master-works of literature, philosophy and art; provoked inquiry;&nbsp;encouraged criticism; shattered the narrow mental barriers&nbsp;imposed by medieval orthodoxy/ Humanism, a word which&nbsp;will often recur in the ensuing paragraphs, denotes a specific&nbsp;bias which the forces liberated in the Renaissance took from&nbsp;contact with the ancient world,—the particular form assumed&nbsp;by human self-esteem at that epoch,—the idcal of life and&nbsp;civilization evolved by the modern nations. It indicates the&nbsp;endeavour of man to reconstitute himself as a free being, not as&nbsp;the thrall of theological despotism, and the peculiar assistance&nbsp;he derived in this effort from Grcek and Roman literature, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Utterae humaniores,</span><span class="font2"> letters leaning rather to the side of man than&nbsp;of divinity.</span></p><div>
