<p><label>RAZOR</label>
a well-known inſtrument, uſed by fur-gcons, barbers, &amp;c. for (having off the hair from va-rious parts of the body.—As ſhaving to many people is a moſt painful operation, cutlers in different cotιn-tries have long applied their ſkill to remove that inconvenience. Some have invented ſoaps of a peculiar kind to make the operation more eaſy, and ſome have invented ſtraps. with reſpect to razors, ſome artiſts have ſucceeded rather by accident than from any fixed principle ; and therefore we have found great inequality in the goodnefs of razors made by the ſame artiſt.</p><p>A correſpondent aſſures us, that he has for 40 years paſt been at much pains to find out razors made by the beſt makers both in England and Scotland, and was fortunate enough, about 22 years ago, to diſcover a kind made by a Scotchman of the name of <hi rend="italic">Logan,</hi> which he called magnetical razors, becauſe they were directed to be touched with an artificial magnet before ufing. Theſe, our friend aſſures us, are moſt excellent razors, and he has uſed them for upwards of 20 years. He fays likewiſe that they continue in good order, without requiring to be ground ; but that the great draw-back on their being generally uſed, is the price, which is higher than moſt people are able or diſpoſed to give ' for that jnſtrument. ‘ ûur correſpondent, who reſides in the vicinity of London, alio informs us, that lately the famous ſurgeon’s inſtrument-maker, Mr Savigny in Pall Mall, after numberleſs experiments, in the courſe of above 20 years, has at length brought razors to a degree of perfection never yet equalled ; and with ſuch certainty, that the purchaſer is in no danger of a diſappointment, though the price is very moderate. By theſe, we are told, the operation of ſtiaving is performed with greater eaſe, more perfectly, and more ex-</p><p>peditiouſiy, than with any other.</p>
