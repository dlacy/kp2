a ſpecies of gladiators among the Romans, whoſe arms were a helmet, a ſhield, and a ſword or a leaden bullet. They were armed in this manner, becauſe they had to contend with the retiarii, who were dreſſed in a ſhort tunic, bore a three-pointed lance in their left hand, and a net in their right. The retiarius attempted to caſt his net over the head of the ſecutor; and <hi rend="italic">if</hi> he ſucceeded, he drew it together and flew him with his trident: but if he miſſed his aim, he immediately betook himſelſ to flight till he could find a ſecond opportunity of intangling his adverſary with his net. He was purſued by the ſecutor, who endeavoured to diſpatch him in his flight.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Secutores</hi> was alſo a name given to ſuch gladiators who took the place of thoſe killed in the combat, or who engaged the conqueror. This poſt was uſually taken by lot.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
