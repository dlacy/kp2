<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ſct out at two </span><span class="font1">o’clock </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">prifoner </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in the cuſtody of the </span><span class="font1">mob. Two gentlemen were felected from his body&nbsp;guard, and, with all the parade </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">an execution, beheaded in the court of his palace. Their heads were&nbsp;ſtuck upon fpears, and led the proceſſion ; whilſt the&nbsp;royal captives who followed in the train, and beheld&nbsp;this fpectacle, were conducted fυ ſlowly, that a ſhort&nbsp;journey of twelve miles was protracted to </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">fix </span><span class="font1">hours.&nbsp;The king, the queen, and their children, were lodged&nbsp;in the old palace of the Louvre, while Monſieur went&nbsp;to reſide at the Luxemburg. The city was illumina-ted, and the evening fpent in triumph by the Pari-ſians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The removal of the king to Paris was regarded as </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">triumph by the popular party. The higher order of&nbsp;nobles conſidered it as completely ruinous to their&nbsp;hopes ; and even many men of talents, ſuch as Mounier&nbsp;and Lally Tollendal, whom we cannot avoid regarding&nbsp;as friends to the popular cauſe in its out-ſet, now re-gardcd every profpect of attaining a happy conflit ution-al freedom as at an end, as the national reprefentatives&nbsp;muff be for ever expυfed to the inſults, and overawed by&nbsp;the influ&lt;gιce, of a turbulent capital. Many members of&nbsp;the affembly took refuge in foreign countries, and uſed&nbsp;every effort to excite the other nations of Europe to&nbsp;lioſtility againſt France. As the duke of odeans had&nbsp;been regarded as a chief agent in promoting the late&nbsp;diſturbances, the marquis de la Fayette waited upon&nbsp;him, and inſiſted upon his leaving the kingdom for a&nbsp;time. The duke was overawed, and, on pretence of&nbsp;public buſineſs, went to England, where he remained&nbsp;for ſeveral months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Οη the i gth of october, the National Aſſembly held its firſt ſeſſion in Paris. The King was clofely&nbsp;guarded in his own palace ; and no apparent oppoſition&nbsp;now ſtood in the way to prevent the popular party from&nbsp;giving to their country ſuch a conſtitution as they might&nbsp;judge expedient. Much, however, was yet to be done,&nbsp;and many difficulties remained, reſulting from the habits of men educated under a very different order of&nbsp;things. Two days after the Affembly came to Paris,&nbsp;a baker was publicly.executed by the mob, upon a falſe&nbsp;accuſation of having concealed a quantity of bread.—&nbsp;while the Affembly was at a diſtance, events of this&nbsp;nature had been little attended to, and the leading party&nbsp;avoided attempting to check theſe ebullitions of popular&nbsp;violence, from which they had derived fo much advantage ; but that party was now all-powerful, and ſo flagrant an offence committed againſt the law was regarded as an inſnlt upon the ſovereignty of the National&nbsp;Affembly. Two leaders of the mob were therefore&nbsp;tried and publicly executed, and a ſevere law was paffed, of the nature of the Britiſh riot act, authoriſing&nbsp;the magiſtrates to act by military force againſt any multitude of perſons that ſhould refuſe to diſperſe. Thus&nbsp;the peace of the capital was ſecured for ſeveral months;&nbsp;but in the country at large no ſmall degree of anxiety&nbsp;and trouble ſtill ſubſiſted. The ſame ſufpicious temper&nbsp;which had prevailed at Paris agitated the provinces&nbsp;with the dread of plots and monopolies oſ grain. Add&nbsp;to this, that the nobleſſe in the country were by no&nbsp;means ſatisſied with the liberality with which their reprefentatives had on the 4th of Auguſt voted away&nbsp;their privileges and their property. This produced&nbsp;violent jealoufies between the peaſants and their lords,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">and gradually conveyed to every corner of the kingdom the political ferment which had commenced at Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The National Aſſembly being now, however, in to-lerable ſecurity, proceeded in the arduous attempt of forming </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">free conſtitution for the great empire of&nbsp;France. The Abbé Sieyes preſented a plan for&nbsp;dividing the kingdom into 83 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">departments,</span><span class="font1"> of about&nbsp;324 fquare leagues, and of each department into feve-ral </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">difiricts,</span><span class="font1"> and each diſtrict was ſubdivided into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cantons&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of four ſquare leagues in extent. Thus the whole of&nbsp;the ancient diviſions of the kingdom into governments,&nbsp;generalities, and bailiewicks, was in an inſtant obliterated. An attempt was alſo made to Amplify in an&nbsp;equal degree the relative ſituation of individuals in civil&nbsp;life, by a decree which put an end to all diſtinction of&nbsp;orders and immunities, ſo far as any privilege whatever&nbsp;was concerned. At the ſame time, a bold and moſt im-portant meaſure was adopted, which has lince proved&nbsp;the organ of thoſe terrible efforts which France has&nbsp;been enabled to make againſt the reft of Europe. This&nbsp;was the conſiſcation of the whole of the lands belonging to the church, for the purpoſe of ſupplying the&nbsp;exigencies of the ſtate. In this tranſaction, all regard&nbsp;to juſtice was thrown aſide. The lands of the church&nbsp;were as certainly the property of the then poſſeiſors of&nbsp;them as any entailed eſtate among us is the property of&nbsp;him who occupies it. The ſtate may have had a right&nbsp;to appropriate to itſelf the church lands upon the death&nbsp;of the incumbents ; but it might with equal juſtice, and&nbsp;perhaps greater propriety, have ſeized the enormous re-venues of the Duke of Qrleans, as have confifcated </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ſingle acre belonging to the moſt ufelefs abbot without his own conſent. This nefarious meafure was pro--poſed by the biſhop of Autun, M. Tallegrand Peri-gord, a man of no religion, who had been promoted to&nbsp;the bench in a moſt irregular manner to ſerve this very&nbsp;purpoſe. The mode in which this property was to be&nbsp;expended was by iſſuing affiguments </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(affignats)</span><span class="font1"> upon it;&nbsp;which aſſignments were to be received by the ſtate for&nbsp;the payment of taxes, or for the purchaſe of church&nbsp;lands when ſet up to ſale. A proviſion was at the&nbsp;ſame time made for the national clergy, who were for&nbsp;the future to be paid by the ſtate. Qn the day following that on which this important meaſure was adopted,&nbsp;a decree was paffed, ſuſpending the parliaments of the&nbsp;kingdom from the exerciſe of their functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Decrees, in which the intereſts of ſo vaſt a multitude of individuals were involved, could not be carried into&nbsp;effect without much murmuring and oppoſition. Thc&nbsp;parliaments, in particular, began to exert themſelves&nbsp;with vigour, and, by proteſts and other publications,&nbsp;attempted to invalidate the decrees of the Aſſembly as&nbsp;illegal ; but theſe privileged bodies, who had often&nbsp;been accuſtomed to contend with fome ſuccefs againſt&nbsp;the deſpotic adminiſtration of their country, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">011&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">that account had been for ages the objects of public ap-plauſe, now found themfelves utterly forfaken, and unable to reſiſt the mandate of a popular Aſſembly. After a few fruitleſs ſtruggles, they were all of them under the neceſſity of ſubmitting to their fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nothing remarkable now .occurred for ſome time.— The Aſſembly proceeded to organize the kingdom by&nbsp;the eſtabliſhment </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">municipalities, and by reforming&nbsp;the juriſprudence of thc country. It is to bc obferved,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">however, that when the parliament of Paris was abo-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
