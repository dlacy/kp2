It marked the extreme limit of the Forum in this direction (Cic., <hi rend="italic">Pro Plan.,</hi>  7, 17), as the rostra did at the other end. This arch was dug up and mostly destroyed in 1540-50, near the temple of Faustina ; on one of the fragments then discovered was inscribed Q . FABIVS . Q . F. MAXSVMVS . AED . CVR . REST. About twenty-live other fragments were found in 1882.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  The arch of Augustus, erected in 29B.C., also stood near this point, but its exact site is uncertain. An inscribed block of its attic was found during the excavations of 1540-50.</p><p>The temple of Faustina the elder stands at the east angle of the Forum, facing the later line of the Sacia Via. It is prostyle hexastyle, and has monolithic columns of cipollino and a rich entablature of Greek marble, with graceful reliefs of griffins and candelabra on the frieze.@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> The walls are of massive peperino, once lined with marble. On the front is inscribedDIVO. ANT0NIN0. ET. DIVAE. FAVSTINAE . EX . S . C. This temple, built by Antoninus Pius in memory of his wife, who died in 141, was after his death dedicated also to him, and the first line was then added (Capitolinus, <hi rend="italic">Ant. Pius,</hi>  6). At an early period it was consecrated as the church of S. Lorenzo in Miranda, and a great part of its cella has been destroyed. The front is now excavated to the original level. This temple is shown on the reverse of several coins of Antoninus Pius ; some Iiave the legend DEDICATIO. AEDIS.</p><p>The space between the north-west end of the Forum and the Tabularium is occupied by a range of important buildings (see Plate VII.). The chief of these is the temple of Concord (see Festus, ed. Müller, p. 347) shown on a fragment of the marble plan, founded by Camillus in 367 b.c. (Plut., <hi rend="italic">Cam.,</hi>  42), and rebuilt by the brothers Tiberius and Drasus out of the spoils gained in Germany ; it was rededicated in 10 a.d. (Suet., <hi rend="italic">Tib.,</hi>  20 ; Dion Cass., lv. 25). It is shown with unusual minuteness on the reverse of a first brass of Tiberius. It is probable that an earlier restoration was carried out by L. Opimius in 121 B.c. (Plut., <hi rend="italic">C. Graeeh.,</hi>  17 ; Appian, <hi rend="italic">Bell. Civ.,</hi>  i. 26). The existing remains @@<hi rend="sup">3</hi>  are of the rebuilding by Tiberius and Drusus, and show that it was unusual in plan, having a large cella much wider than its depth, and a very large projecting portico. Its construction is an interesting example of the Roman use of many different materials. The lower part of the walls was of massive tufa blocks, the upper part of the cella of travertine ; and the inner low wall, which supported ranges of internal columns, was of mixed concrete, tufa, and travertine. The whole was lined with marble, white outside, and rich Oriental marbles inside (see fig. 5), which were also used for the pavement. The door-sill is made of enormous blocks of porta santa marble, in which a bronze Caduceus (emblem of Concord) was inlaid. Between the internal columns of the cella stood rows of statues ; and the temple also contained a large collection of pictures, engraved gems, gold and silver plate, and other works of art, mostly the work of ancient Greek artists (see Plin.,<hi rend="italic">H.K,</hi>  xxxiv. 19, xxxv. 36, 40, xxxvi. 67, xxxvii. 2). On the apex of the pediment was a group of three figures embracing ; the tympanum was filled with sculpture ; and statues were set in the open porch. Though now only the podium and the lower part of the cella wall exist, with foundations of the great flight of steps, many rich fragments both of the Corinthian entablature and of the internal caps and bases are preserved in the Capitol ; and some of the marble lining is still wt <hi rend="italic">situ.</hi>  The Einsiedeln MS.@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi>  gives part of the inscription of the front—<hi rend="smallcaps">S.

This was dedicated by Cn. Flavius, 305 B.c. (see Liv., ix. 46); according to Pliny <hi rend="italic">(H.K,</hi>  xxxiii. 6) it stood “in Græcostasi, quæ tunc supra Comitium erat.” Both these were probably only small shrines.</p><p>The temple of Vespasian stands close by that of Concord, abutting on the Tabularium in a similar way, and blocking up a doorway at the foot of a long flight of steps (see fig. 1). It consists of a nearly square cella with prostyle hexastyle portico of the Corinthian order ; three of the columns are still standing, with their rich entablature, the frieze of which is sculptured with sacred instru-</p><p>ments. The avails are of enormous blocks of travertine with strong iron clamps ; the whole was lined with white Pentelic marble outside, and inside with coloured Oriental marbles. There was an internal range of columns, as in the temple of Concord. This temple was built by Domitian, c. 94 a.d., in honour of his father Vespasian. The inscription on the entablature, given in the Einsiedeln MS., records a restoration by Severus and Caracalla—DIVO. VESPASIANO. AVGVSTO. S . P. Q . R. IMPP. CAESS . SEVERVS . ET. ANTONINVS. PII . FELIC . AVGG . R[ESTITVER]VNT ; part of the last word only now exists.@@<hi rend="sup">6</hi></p><p>In the narrowspace between the temples of Concordand Vespasian (only about 7 feet in width) a small brick and concrete ædicula stands against the Tabularium. This has been wrongly called a shrine of Faustina, on the authority of a small inscribed pedestal found near it ;@@<hi rend="sup">7</hi> but there is clear constructional proof that it is contemporary with the temple of Vespasian, and is therefore of the time of Domitian.@@<hi rend="sup">8</hi> It may possibly have been a shrine dedicated to Titus, whose name does not occur in the inscription of the adjoining temple, though the catalogue in the<hi rend="italic">Curwsurn, </hi>Reg. ix., mentions a dedication to both father and son.@@<hi rend="sup">9</hi></p><p>The next building is the Porticus XII. Deorum Consentium, a large marble platform facing the Clivus Capitolinus, with a row of small rooms or shrines partly cut into the tufa rock of the hill behind. This conjunction of twelve deities was of Etruscan origin; they were six of each sex and were called Senatus Deorum (Varro, <hi rend="italic">L.L</hi><hi rend="italic">∣</hi><hi rend="italic">.,</hi>  viii. 70, and <hi rend="italic">De Re Rusk,</hi>  i. I).@@<hi rend="sup">10</hi>  The columns are of cipollino with Corinthian caps ; on the frieze is an inscription recording a 'restoration by Vettius Prætextatus, præfect of the city in 367 A.D. Under the marble platform is a row of seven small rooms, the brick facing of which is of the Flavian period, used as offices (schola) for scribes and præcones of the ædilcs. It is usually called the Schola Xanthi from an inscription, now lost, recording its restoration by A. Fabius Xanthus and others, and the erection of seven silver statues of gods (Gruter, <hi rend="italic">Inscr.,</hi>  170, 3).@@<hi rend="sup">11</hi></p><p>The arch of Severus stands by the rostra, across the road on the north-east side of the Forum ; the remains of the ancient travertine curb show that originally the road went along a rather different line, aud was probably altered to make room for this great arch. It was built in 203 a.d., after victories in Parthia, and was originally set up in honour of Severus and his two sons Caracalla (here called M. Aurelius Antoninus) and Geta. Caracalla, after murdering Geta, erased his name from all monuments to his honour in Rome. Representations of the arch on coins of Severus show that its attic was surmounted by a chariot of bronze drawn by six horses, in which stood Severus crowned by Victory ; at the sides were statues of Caracalla and Geta, with an equestrian statue at each angle. The arch, except the base, which is of marble-lined travertine, is built of massive blocks of Pentelic marble, and has large crowded reliefs of victories in the East, showing much decadence from the best period of Roman art.</p><p>The central space of the Forum is paved with slabs of travertine, much patched at various dates ; it appears to have been marked out into compartments with incised lines (see Plate VII.), the use of which is not known.@@<hi rend="sup">12</hi> Numerous clamp-holes all over the paving show where statues and other ornaments once stood. The recorded number of these is very great, and they must once have thickly crowded a great part of the central area. Two short marble walls or plutei covered with reliefs, discovered in 1872, stand on the north side. Their use and original position are not known, as the rough travertine plinth on which they have been set is evidently of late date. Each of these marble screens has (on the inside) reliefs of a fat bull, boar, and ram, decked out with sacrificial wreaths and vittæ—the Suovetaurilia. On the outside are scenes in the life of Trajan : one has the emperor seated on a suggestus instituting a charity for destitute children in 99 a.d.—a scene shown also in one of his first brasses—with the legendALIM[ENTA] ITALIAE;@@<hi rend="sup">13</hi>at the other end the emperor stands on the rostra, on which the two tiers of beaks are shown ; he is addressing a crowd of citizens. The backgrounds of this and the other relief are of great topographical interest. In the first is shown the long line of arches of the Basilica Julia, with (on the left) what is probably the temple of Castor and the arch of Augustus. On the right are the statue of Marsyas and the sacred fig-tree <hi rend="italic">(ficus
