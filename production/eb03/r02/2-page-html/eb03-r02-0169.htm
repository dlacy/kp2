<p><span class="font1">deration, and great humanity of Brutus, who in every inſtance ſeemed ſtudious of the happineſs of his&nbsp;country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was in this flouriſhing ſtate of their affairs that the conſpirators had formed a reſolution of going againſt&nbsp;Cleopatra, who, on her </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ide, had made great preparations to aſſiſt their opponents. However, they were&nbsp;diverted from this purpoſe by an information that Octavianus and Antony were now upon their march, with&nbsp;40 legions to oppoſe them. Brutus now, therefore,&nbsp;moved to have their army paſs over into Greece and&nbsp;Macedonia, and there meet the enemy </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">γ</span><span class="font1"> but Caſſius ſo&nbsp;far prevailed as to have the Rhodians and Lycians firſt&nbsp;reduced, who had refuſed their uſual contribution.&nbsp;This expe&lt;Jtion was immediately put in execution, and&nbsp;extraordinary contributions were raiſed by that means,&nbsp;the Rhodians having ſcarce any thing leſt but their&nbsp;lives *. The Lycians ſuffered ſtill more ſeverely ; for&nbsp;having ſhut themſelves up in the city of Xanthus, they&nbsp;defended the place againſt Brutus with </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">uch fury, that&nbsp;neither his art nor intreaties could prevail upon them&nbsp;to ſurrender. At length, the town being ſet on fire,&nbsp;by their attempting to burn the works of the Romans,&nbsp;Brutus, inſtead of laying hold on this opportunity to&nbsp;ſtorm the place, made every effort to preſerve it, intreating his ſoldiers to try all means of extinguiſhing&nbsp;the fire : but the deſperate phrenzy of the citizens was&nbsp;not to be mollified. Far from thinking themſelves obliged to their generous enemy for the efforts which&nbsp;were made to ſave them, they reſolved to periſh in the&nbsp;flames. Wherefore, inſtead of extinguiſhing, they did&nbsp;all in their power to augment the fire, by throwing in&nbsp;wood, dry reeds, and all kinds of fuel. Nothing could&nbsp;exceed the diſtreſs of Brutus upon ſeeing the townſmea,&nbsp;thus reſolutely bent on deſtroying themſelves : he rede&nbsp;about the fortifications, ſtretching out his hands to the&nbsp;Xanthians, and conjuring them to have pity on therm·&nbsp;ſelves and their city ; but, inſenſible to his expoſtula-tions, they ruſhed into the flames with deſperate obſtinacy, and the whole ſoon became an heap of« undi-ſtinguiſhable ruin. At this horrid ſpectacle, Brutus&nbsp;offered a reward to every ſoldier who would bring him&nbsp;a Lycian alive. The number of thoſe whom it was&nbsp;poſſible to ſave from their own fury amounted to no&nbsp;more than 150.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brutus and Caſſius met once more at Sardis, where, after the uiual ceremonies were paſſed between them,&nbsp;they reſolved to have a private conference together,&nbsp;when, after much altercation, they were at laſt perfectly reconciled. After which, night coming on, Caſſius invited Brutus and his friends to an entertainment.&nbsp;Upon retiring home, it was that Brutus, as Plutarch&nbsp;tells the ſtory, ſaw a ſpectre in his tent. It was in&nbsp;the dead of the night, when the whole camp was per*&nbsp;ſectly quiet, that Brutus was employed in reading by&nbsp;a lamp that was juſt expiring. On a ſudden he thought&nbsp;he heard a noiſe as if ſomebody entered ;. and looking&nbsp;towards the door, he perceived it open. A gigantic&nbsp;figure, with a frightful aſpect, ſtood before him, and &lt;&nbsp;continued to gaze upon him with filent ſeverity. At<sup>,&nbsp;</sup>laſt Brutus had courage to ſpeak to it : “ Art thou a&nbsp;daemon or a mortal man? and why comeſt thou to me?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Brutus,” replied the phantom, “ I am thy evil genius, thou ſhalt ſee me again at Philippi.” “ Well then,” anſwered Brutus, without being diſcompoſed,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">“ we ſhall meet again.” Upon which the phantom vaniſhed ; and Brutus calling to his ſervants, allied if&nbsp;they had ſeen any thing ; to which replying in the negative, he again reſumed his ſtudies. But as he was&nbsp;ſtruck with ſo ſtrange an occurrence, he mentioned it&nbsp;the next day to Caſſius, who, being an Epicurean,&nbsp;aſeribed it to the effect of imagination too much exerciſed by vigilance and anxiety. Brutus appeared ſatisfied with this ſolution of his late terrors ; and, as Antony and Octavianus were now advanced into Macedonia, they ſoon after paſſed over into Thrace, and advanced to the city of Philippi, near which the forces&nbsp;of the triumvirs were poſted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A battle ſoon enſued ; in which the republicans were defeated, and Caſſius killed, as is related in the article&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Philippi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The firſt care of Brutus, when he became the ſole general, was to aſſemble the diſperſed troops of Caſſius, and animate them with freſh hopes of victory. As&nbsp;they had loſt all they poſſeſſed by the plundering of&nbsp;their camp, he promiſed them 2000 denarii each man&nbsp;to make up their lofles. This once more inſpired them&nbsp;with new ardour ; they admired the liberality of their&nbsp;general, and with loud ſhouts proclaimed his former&nbsp;intrepidity. Still, however, he had not confidence&nbsp;ſufficient to face the adverſary, who offered him battle&nbsp;the enſuing day. His aim was to ſtarve his enemies,&nbsp;who were in extreme want of proviſions, their fleet having been lately defeated. But his ſingle opinion was&nbsp;over-ruled by the reſt of his army, who now grew&nbsp;every day more confident of their ſtrength, and more&nbsp;arrogant to their new general. He was, therefore, at&nbsp;laft, after a reſpite of 20 days, obliged to comply with&nbsp;their ſolicitations to try the fate of the battle. Both&nbsp;armies being drawn out, they remained a long while&nbsp;oppoſite to each other without offering to engage. It&nbsp;is ſaid that he himſelſ had loſt much of his natural ardour by having again ſeen the ſpectre the night preceding : however, he encouraged his men as much as poſſible, and gave the ſignal for battle within three hours of&nbsp;fun-ſet. Fortune again declared againſt him; and the&nbsp;two triumviri expreſsly ordered by no means to ſuffer&nbsp;the general to eſcape, for fear he ſhould renew the&nbsp;war. Thus the whole body of the enemy ſeemed chiefly&nbsp;intent on Brutus alone, and his capture ſeemed inevitable. In this deplorable exigence, Lucilius his friend&nbsp;reſolved, by his own death, to effect the general’s delivery., Upon perceiving a body of Thracian horſe&nbsp;cloſely purſuing Brutus, and juſt upon the point of&nbsp;taking him, he boldly threw himſelf in their way, telling them that he was. Brutus. The Thracians, overjoyed with ſo great a prize, immediately diſpatched&nbsp;ſome of their companions, with the news of their ſucceſs, to the army. Upon which, the ardour of the purſuit now abating, Antony marched out to meet his priſoner ; ſome ſilently deploring the fate of ſo virtuous a&nbsp;man ; others reproaching that mean deſire of life for&nbsp;which he conſented to undergo captivity. Antony&nbsp;now feeing the Thracians approach, began to prepare ~&nbsp;himſelf for the interview ; but the faithful Lucilius, advancing with a cheerful air, owned· the deceit that he&nbsp;had put upon him : on which the triumvir, ſtruck with&nbsp;ſo much fidelity, pardoned him upon the ſpot; and from -,&nbsp;that time forward loaded him with benefits, and hαfo∙&nbsp;noured him. with his friendſhip..</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
