<p><span class="font0">the ſhort delay of his execution was ſufficient to brand the conqueror with the guilt of cool and deliberate&nbsp;cruelty. The famiſhed Germans who eſcaped the fury&nbsp;of the auxiliaries were ſold as ſlaves, at the contemptible&nbsp;price of as many ſingle pieces of gold : but the difference&nbsp;of food and climate ſwept away great numbers of thoſe&nbsp;unhappy ſtrangers; and it was obſerved, that the inhuman&nbsp;purchaſers, inſtead of reaping the fruit of their labour,&nbsp;were ſoon obliged to add to it the expence of interring&nbsp;them. Stilicho informed the emperor and the ſenate&nbsp;of his ſucceſs ; and deſerved a ſecond time the glorious&nbsp;title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deliverer of Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The fame of the victory, and more eſpecially of the miracle, has encouraged a vain perſuafion, that the&nbsp;whole army, or rather nation, of Germans, who migrated from the ſhores of the Baltic, miſerably periſhed&nbsp;under the walls of Florence. Such indeed was the fate&nbsp;of Radagaiſus himſelf, of his brave and faithful companions, and of more than one-third of the various multitude of Sueves and Vandals, of Alani and Burgundians, who adhered to the ſtandard of their general. The&nbsp;union of ſuch an army might excite our ſurpriſe, but the&nbsp;cauſes of ſeparation are obvious and forcible ; they were&nbsp;the pride of birth, the inſolence of valour, the jealouſy of&nbsp;command, the impatience of ſubordination, and the&nbsp;obſtinate conflict of opinions, of intereſts, and of paf-ſions, among ſo many kings and warriors, who were&nbsp;untaught to yield or to obey. Alter the defeat of Radagaiſus, two parts of the German hoſt, which muſt&nbsp;have exceeded the number of 100,000 men, ſtill remained in arms between the Apennine and the Alps, or&nbsp;between the Alps and the Danube. It is uncertain whether they attempted to revenge the death of their general : but their irregular fury was ſoon diverted by the&nbsp;prudence and firmneſs of Stilicho, who oppoſed their&nbsp;march, and facilitated their retreat ; who conſidered&nbsp;the ſafety of Rome and Italy as the great object of his&nbsp;care, and who ſacriſiced with too much indifference the&nbsp;wealth and tranquillity of the diſtant provinces. The&nbsp;barbarians acquired, ſrom the junction of ſome Pannonian deſerters, the knowledge of the country and of the&nbsp;roads ; and the invaſion of Gaul, which Alaric had deſigned, was executed by the remains of the great army&nbsp;of Radagaiſus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Yet if they expected to derive any aſſiſtance ſrom ihe tribes of Germany who inhabited-the banks of the&nbsp;Rhine, their hopes were diſappointed. The Alemanni&nbsp;preſerved a ſtate of inactive neutrality ; and the Franks&nbsp;diſtinguiſhed their zeal and courage in the defence of&nbsp;the empire. In the rapid progreſs down the Rhine,&nbsp;which was the firſt act of the adminiſtration of Stilicho,&nbsp;he had applied himſelf with peculiar attention to ſecure&nbsp;the alliance of the warlike Franks, and to remove the&nbsp;irreconcileable enemies of peace and of the republic.&nbsp;Marcomir, one of their kings, was publicly convicted&nbsp;before the tribunal of the Roman magiſtrate of violating&nbsp;the faith of treaties. He was ſentenced to a mild, but&nbsp;diſtant exile, in the province of Tuſcany ; and this degradation of the regal dignity was ſo far from exciting&nbsp;the reſentment of his ſubjects, that they puniſhed with&nbsp;death the turbulent Sunno, who attempted to revenge&nbsp;his brother, and maintained a dutiful allegiance to the&nbsp;princes who were eſtabliſhed on the throne by the choice&nbsp;of Stilicho. When the limits of Gaul and Germany&nbsp;were ſhaken by the northern emigration, the Franks</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">bravely encountered the ſingle force of the Vandals ; who, regardleſs of the leffons of adverſity, had again&nbsp;ſeparated their troops from the ſtandard of their barbarian allies. They paid the penalty of their raſhneſs ;&nbsp;and 20,000 Vandals, with their king Godigiſclus, were&nbsp;ſlain in the field of battle. The whole people muſt have&nbsp;been extirpated, if the ſquadrons of the Alani, advancing to their relief, had not trampled down the infantry&nbsp;of the Franks ; who, after an honourable reſiſtance,&nbsp;were compelled to relinquiſh the unequal conteſt. The&nbsp;victorious confederates purfued their march ; and on&nbsp;the laſt day of the year, in a ſeaſon when the waters of&nbsp;the Rhine w<sup>,</sup>ere moſt probably frozen, they entered&nbsp;without oppoſition the defenceleſs provinces of Gaul.&nbsp;This memorable paſſage of the Suevi, the Vandals, the&nbsp;Alani, and the Burgundians, who never afterwards retreated, may be conſidered as the fail of the Roman&nbsp;empire in the countries beyond the Alps ; and the barriers, which had ſo long ſeparated the ſavage and the&nbsp;civilized nations of the earth, w<sup>,</sup>ere ſrom that fatal moment levelled with the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ While the peace of Germany was ſecured by the attachment of the Franks and the neutrality of the&nbsp;Alemanni, the ſubjects of Rome, unconſeious of their&nbsp;approaching calamities, enjoyed a ſtate of quiet and&nbsp;proſperity, which had ſeldom bleſſed the frontiers of&nbsp;Gaul. Their flocks and herds were permitted to graze&nbsp;in the paſtures of the barbarians ; their huntſmen penetrated, without fear or danger, into the darkeſt receſſes of the Hercynian wood. The banks of the Rhine&nbsp;were crowned, like thoſe of the Tiber, with elegant&nbsp;houſes and weſt cultivated farms ; and if a poet deſcend-ed the river, he might expreſs his doubt on which ſide&nbsp;was ſituated the territory of the Romans. This ſcene&nbsp;of peace and plenty was ſuddenly changed into a deſert,&nbsp;and the proſpect of the ſmoking ruins could alone diſtinguiſh the ſolitude of nature from the deſolation of&nbsp;man. The flouriſhing city of Mentz was ſurpriſed and&nbsp;deſtroyed ; and many thouſand Chriſtians were inhumanly maſſacred in the church. Worms periſhed after&nbsp;a long and obſtinate ſiege : Straſhurg, Spires, Rheims,&nbsp;Tournay, Aras, Amiens, experienced the cruel oppreſſion of the German yoke ; and the conſuming flames of&nbsp;war ſpread from the banks of the Rhine over the greateſt&nbsp;part of the 17 provinces of Gaul. That rich and extenſive country, as far as the Ocean, the Alps, and the&nbsp;Pyrenees, was delivered to the barbarians, who drove&nbsp;before them, in a promiſeuous crowd, the biſhop, the&nbsp;ſenator, and the virgin, laden with the ſpoils of their&nbsp;houſes and altars.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the midſt of theſe calamities a revolt happened in Britain, where one Conſtantine, a common ſoldier, was&nbsp;raiſed to the imperial throne, merely for the ſake of his&nbsp;name. However, he ſeems to have been a man of conſiderable abilities, and by no means unfit for the high&nbsp;dignity to which he was raiſed. He governed Britain&nbsp;with great proſperity ; paſſed over into Gaul and Spain,&nbsp;the inhabitants of which ſubmitted without oppoſition,&nbsp;being glad of any protector whatever from the barbarians. Honorius, incapable of defending the empire,&nbsp;or repreſſing the revolt, was obliged to acknowledge&nbsp;him for his partner in the empire. In the mean time,&nbsp;Alaric, with his Goths, threatened a new invaſion unleſs he was paid a certain ſum of money. Stilicho is&nbsp;ſaid to have occaſioned this demand, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font0">have inſiſt-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
