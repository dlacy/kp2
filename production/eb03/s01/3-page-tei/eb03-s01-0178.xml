Bruce and his party perceived the ſignal, as they thought, and immediately put to ſea. Their voyage took up but little time; and as Bruce had now 400 men along with him, he reſolved immediately to act on the offenſive. His firſt exploit was to ſurpriſe his own caſtle of Tunberry, which had been given, along with Bruce’s eſtate, to lord Henry Percy. Him he drove out, along with the Engliſh garriſon; but, in the mean time, he met with his fervant Cuthbert, who gave him diſagreeable intelligence. This man had met with very little encouragement on his landing in Scotland; in conſequence of which he had not lighted the fire agreed upon as a ſignal of his ſucceſs, that which Bruce had obſerved having been kindled by accident. He alſo told him, that the Engliſh were in full poſſeſſion of the country, and adviſed his maſter to be upon his guard. Soon after this the king was joined by a lady of fortune, who brought along with her 40 warriors. By her he was firſt particularly informed of the miſerable fate of his family and relations; which, inſtead of diſheartening, animated him the more with a deſire of revenge. However, he did not immediately attempt any thing himſelf, but allowed Douglas to attempt the recovery of his eſtate of Douglasdale, as Bruce himſelf had recovered his in Carrick. In this expedition Douglas was joined by one Thomas Dickſon, a man of conſiderable fortune, and who gave him intelligence concerning the ſtate of the country. By his advice he kept himſelf private till Palm Sunday; when he and his followers with covered armour repaired to St Bride’s church, where the Engliſh were performing divine ſervice. The latter were ſurpriſed, but made a brave defence; though, being overpowered by numbers, they were at laſt obliged to yield. Douglas, without farther reſiſtance, took poſſeſſion of his own caſtle, which he found well furniſhed with arms, proviſions, and money. He deſtroyed all that he could not carry with him, and alſo the caſtle itſelf, where he knew that he muſt have been beſieged if he had kept it.</p><p>While Bruce and his friends were thus ſignalizing themſelves, and ſtruggling with the Engliſh under ſo many diſadvantages, it is natural to think that they muſt have met with many dangerous and difficult adventures. Many of theſe, indeed, are related by the Scots hiſtorians; but moſt of them have the appearance of fables, and it is now impoſſible to diſtinguiſh the true from the falſe; for which reaſon we ſhall paſs them all over in ſilence, confining ourſelves only to thoſe facts which are at once important and well authenticated.</p><p>In 1307, the earl of Pembroke advanced into the weft of Scotland to encounter Bruce. The latter did not decline the combat; and Pembrokc was defeated. Three days after this, Bruce defeated with great Daughter another Engliſh general named Ralph de Monthermer, and obliged him to fly to the caſtle of Air. The  king laid ſiege to the caſtle for ſome time, but retired at the approach of ſuccours from England. This year the Engliſh performed nothing, except burning the monaſtery at Paiſley. Edward, however, reſolved ſtill to execute his utmoſt vengeance on the Scots, though he had long been retarded in his operations by a tedious and dangerous indiſpoſition. But now, ſuppoſing that his malady was decreaſed ſo far that he could ſafely proceed on his march, he offered up the horselitter, in which he had hitherto been carried, in the cathedral church of Carliſle; and, mounting himſelf on horſeback, proceeded on the way towards Solway. He was ſo weak, however, that he could advance no farther than ſix miles in four days; after which he expired in light of Scotland, which he had ſo often devoted to deſtruction. With his dying breath he gave orders that his body ſhould accompany his army into Scotland, and remain unburied until the country was totally ſubdued; but his ſon, diſregarding this order, cauſed it to be depoſited in Weſtminſter abbey.</p><p>The death of ſuch an inveterate enemy to the Scottiſh name, could not fail of raiſing the ſpirits of Bruce and his party; and the inactive and timid behaviour of his ſon Edward II. contributed not a little to give them freſh courage. After having granted the guardianſhip of Scotland to his favourite Piers de Gaveſton earl of Pembroke, whom his lather had lately baniſhed, he advanced to Cumnock, on the frontiers ol Airlhire, and then retreated into England; conferring the office of guardian of Scotland upon John de Bretagne earl of Richmond, a fortnight after he had beſtowed it on Gaveſton. He was no ſooner gone than Bruce invaded Galloway. The inhabitants refuſing to follow his ſtandard, he laid waſte the country; but was defeated, and obliged to retire northwards by the guardian. In the north he over-ran the country without oppoſition; and ſoon began to move ſouthwards again in order to repair his late diſgrace. He was encountered by Cornyn earl of Buchan with an undiſciplined body of Engliſh, whom he entirely defeated and diſperſed. But about this time he was ſeized with a grievous diſtemper, which weakened him so much, that no hopes were left of his recovery. In this enfeebled ſituation, he was attacked by the earl of Buchan and John Mowbray an Engliſh commander, who had aſſembled a body of troops in order to efface their late difhonout. The armies met at Inverury in Aberdeenſhire. Bruce was too weak to ſupport himſelf, and therefore was held upon horſeback by two attendants: but he had the pleaſure of ſeeing his enemies totally defeated, and purſued with great ſlaughter for many mile; and it is reported, that the agitation of his ſpirits on that day proved the means of curing him of his diſeaſe. This battle was fought on the 22d of May 1308.</p><p>The king of Scotland now took revenge of his enemies, after the manner of that barbarous age, by waſting the country of Buchan with fire and ſword. His ſucceſſes had ſo raiſed his character, that many of the Scots who had hitherto adhered to the Engliſh cauſe, now came over to that of Robert. Edward, the king’s brother, invaded Galloway, and defeated the inhabitants of that country. John de St John, an Engliſh commander, with 1500 horſemen, attempted to ſurpriſe him; but Edward having received timely information of his deſigns, ordered the infantry and meaner part of his army to entrench themſelves ſtrongly, while he himſelf, with no more than 50 horſemen, well armed, under cover of a thick miſt, attacked his enemies, and put them to flight. After this he reduced all the fortreſſes in the country, and totally expelled the Engliſh from it. About this time alſo, Douglas, when roving about the moun-</p></body></text></TEI>
