<p><span class="font1">and in 1639 Rotrou bought the post of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lieutenant particulier au bailliage</span><span class="font1"> at Dreux. In the next year he married Marguerite&nbsp;Camus, and settled down as a model magistrate and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">père de&nbsp;famille.</span><span class="font1"> Among his pieces written before his marriage were&nbsp;a translation of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphitryon</span><span class="font1"> of Plautus, under the title of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Deux Sosies</span><span class="font1"> (1636), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Antigone</span><span class="font1"> (1638), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Laure Persecutée&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(acted 1637; pr. 1639), in the opposite style to these classical&nbsp;pieces. In 1646 Rotrou produced the first of his four&nbsp;masterpieces, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Véritable Saint Genest</span><span class="font1"> (acted 1646; pr. r648),&nbsp;a story of Christian martyrdom containing some amusing byplay, one noble speech and a good deal of dignified action.&nbsp;Rotrou uses with considerable success the device of a play&nbsp;within a play. The actor Genest becomes a real convert while&nbsp;playing the part of a Christian martyr. Incidentally (Act i.&nbsp;Sc. v. ) Rotrou pays a noble tribute to the genius of Corneille.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Don Bertrand de Cabrère</span><span class="font1"> (1647) is a tragi-comedy of merit;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Venceslas</span><span class="font1"> (1647; pr. r648) is considered in France his masterpiece, and has had several modern revivals; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cosroès</span><span class="font1"> (1649)&nbsp;has an Oriental setting, and is claimed as the only absolutely&nbsp;original piece of Rotrou. These masterpieces follow foreign&nbsp;models, and Rotrou’s genius is shown in the skill with which he&nbsp;simplifies the plot and strengthens the situations. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Saint Genest&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">followed Lope de Vega’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lo fingido υerdadero</span><span class="font1">;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> Venceslas&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">followed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">No ay ser padre siendo rey</span><span class="font1"> of Francisco de Rojas.&nbsp;In this play Ladislas and his brother both love the princess&nbsp;Cassandra; Ladislas makes his way into her house and in the&nbsp;darkness kills a man whom he thinks to be the duke of Courland,&nbsp;but who is really his brother Alexandre, the favoured lover.&nbsp;In the early morning he meets the king and is confronted by&nbsp;the duke of Courland. The outline of this incident is in the&nbsp;Spanish play, but there the spectators are aware of the ghastly&nbsp;mistake at the time of the murder. Rotrou shows his dramatic&nbsp;skill by concealing the real facts from the audience until they&nbsp;are revealed to the horror-struck Ladislas himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1650 the plague broke out at Dreux. Rotrou remained at his post, although urgently desired to save himself by going to&nbsp;Paris; caught the disease, and died in a few hours. He was&nbsp;buried at Dreux on the 28th of June 1650. Rotrou’s great&nbsp;fertility (he left thirty-five collected plays besides others lost,&nbsp;strayed or uncollected), and perhaps the uncertainty of&nbsp;dramatic plan shown by his hesitation almost to the last between&nbsp;the classical and the romantic style have injured his work.&nbsp;He has no thoroughly good play, hardly one thoroughly good&nbsp;act. But his situations are often pathetic and noble, and as a&nbsp;tragic poet properly so called he is at his best almost the equal&nbsp;of Corneille and of Racine. His single lines and single phrases&nbsp;have a brilliancy and force not to be found in French drama&nbsp;between Corneille and Hugo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A complete edition of Rotrou was edited in five volumes by Viollet le Duc in 1822. ln 1882 M. de Ronchaud published a&nbsp;handsome edition of six plays—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saint Genest, Venceslas, Don Bertrand&nbsp;de Cabrère, Antigone, Hercule Mourant</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cosroes. Venceslas</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saint Genest</span><span class="font0"> are also to be found in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chefs-d'œuvre Tragiques</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;the Collection Didot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rotrou’s brother, Pierre Rotrou de Saudreville, left a memoir of him which is unfortunately lost, but this is cited by the Abbé&nbsp;Brillon (1671-1736) as his authority in a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Notice biographique sur&nbsp;Jean Rotrou,</span><span class="font0"> first printed in 1885 at Chartres under the editorship&nbsp;of L.

<p><span class="font1">ROTTA, Chrotta, Hrotta (Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cithare,</span><span class="font1"> rotta; Ger, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cythara,</span><span class="font1"> Rotta), a medieval stringed instrument derived from the Greek cithara. The rotta possessed, in common with all&nbsp;other forerunners of the violin, the chief structural features&nbsp;of the cithara, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> the box sound-chest composed of back&nbsp;and belly either flat or delicately arched connected by ribs.&nbsp;The rotta represents the first step in the evolution of the cithara,&nbsp;when arms and cross-bar were replaced by a frame joined to&nbsp;the body, the strings being usually restricted to eight or less.&nbsp;Examples of these early rottas abound in miniatures from&nbsp;the 8th to the 12th century or even the 14th, such as Cotton&nbsp;MS. Vespasian A. I. (Brit. Mus. ), 700 a. d., and the MS. copy&nbsp;in the Durham Cathedral Library of the Cassiodorus Commentary on the Psalms@@<sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manu Bedae.</span><span class="font1"> The most interesting&nbsp;is a real specimen of wood found in an Alamannic tomb of&nbsp;the 4th to the 7th century at Oberflacht@@<sup>2</sup> in the Black Forest,&nbsp;and now preserved in the Völker Museum, Berlin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The next step was the addition of a finger-board and the consequent reduction of the strings to three or four, since each string was now capable of producing several notes. In the Carolingian Bible presented to Charles the Bald@@<sup>3</sup> by Count Vivian&nbsp;of Tours there is a fine example of the rotta at this stage, in&nbsp;which the artist has reproduced the position of the fingers of&nbsp;the left hand stopping the strings, and of the right hand plucking them. The same instrument occurs in a companion Bible,&nbsp;known as the Bible of St Paul because it was preserved&nbsp;in the monastery of that name “ without the walls ” at Rome.&nbsp;Although these MSS. were executed in the 9th century, they&nbsp;do not represent contemporary scenes, but were inspired by&nbsp;Romano-Christian models, if not actually copied from older&nbsp;MSS. This is the only representation yet found of the finger*&nbsp;board thus applied to the rotta. In the final transition preceding the transformation into the guitar, the rotta appears as&nbsp;a guitar-shaped instrument without neck or head and having&nbsp;a hole large enough to allow the hand to pass through left in&nbsp;the body on each side of the strings. At first this instrument,&nbsp;which developed into the crwth, was twanged with the fingers,&nbsp;but in the 11th century it was played with a bow, the bridge&nbsp;having been slightly raised on feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first (and perhaps also the second) of these transitions was accomplished in the Christian East, where, however, the upper&nbsp;frame of the earliest rotta seems to have been at once discarded in&nbsp;favour of a long neck with frets, for which the tanbur undoubtedly&nbsp;supplied the idea. This evolution is to be traced in the miniatures&nbsp;of a single MS., which supplies examples of all the transitions. The&nbsp;miniatures illustrate the Psalms in the Utrecht Psalter; they were&nbsp;beyond doubt originally designed to accompany a Greek or Syriac&nbsp;version.@@<sup>4</sup> The Utrecht Psalter, executed in the diocese of Reims&nbsp;under Anglo-Saxon influence during the 9th century, is no servile&nbsp;copy, but it owes much of its inspiration and local colour to an&nbsp;unknown Greek or Syrian prototype.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As soon as the neck was added to the guitar-shaped body, the instrument ceased to be a rotta and became a guitar (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font0">), or a&nbsp;guitar-fiddle (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q. v. </span><span class="font0">) if played with the bow. Of the rotta, there were&nbsp;two distinct types, the one derived from the cithara, the rotta proper,&nbsp;and the other derived from the lyre, which survived to the 18th&nbsp;century as the Welsh crwth. Although the various forms of the&nbsp;name came to be applied somewhat indiscriminately in different&nbsp;countries and epochs to both types, yet the structural features of&nbsp;both remained true to their respective archetypes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The words rotta in England and cythara in Germany seem to have clung more especially to the first of these types, while the forms&nbsp;crwth, crowd, crouth were reserved for the bowed instruments, the&nbsp;earliest of which appeared in the 11th century. @@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The crwth or crowd, so popular in England during the 14th century, does not seem to have won equal favour in Germany, where at that&nbsp;time the nidel or guitar-fiddle had been popularized by the minnesingers. The crwth derived from the lyre underwent no further&nbsp;development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(K. S. )</span></p>
