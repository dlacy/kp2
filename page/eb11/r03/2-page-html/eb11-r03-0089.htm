<p><span class="font0">conservancy of rivers, numerous obstructions have in many cases been placed in their channel, such as mining refuse, sluicegates for mills, fish-traps, unduly wide piers for bridges and&nbsp;solid weirs, which impede the flow and raise the flood-level.&nbsp;Stringent prohibitions with regard to refuse, the enlargement&nbsp;of sluice-ways and the compulsory raising of their gates for&nbsp;the passage of floods, the removal of fish-traps which are frequently blocked up by leaves and floating rubbish, a reduction&nbsp;in the number and width of the piers of bridges when rebuilt,&nbsp;and the substitution of movable weirs for solid weirs, greatly&nbsp;facilitate the discharge of a river, and consequently lower its&nbsp;flood-level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prediction of Floods in Rivers.—</span><span class="font0">By erecting gauges in a fairly large river and its tributaries at suitable points, and keeping&nbsp;continuous records for some time of the heights of the water&nbsp;at the various stations, the rise of the floods in the different&nbsp;tributaries, the periods they take in passing down to definite&nbsp;stations on the main river, and the influence they severally&nbsp;exercise on the height of the floods at these places, are ascertained. With the help of these records, by observing the&nbsp;times and heights of the maximum rise of a particular flood&nbsp;at the stations on the various tributaries, the time of arrival&nbsp;and height of the top of the flood at any station on the main&nbsp;river can be predicted with remarkable accuracy two or more&nbsp;days beforehand. By telegraphing these particulars about a&nbsp;high flood to places on the lower river, the weir-keepers are&nbsp;enabled to open fully beforehand the movable weirs for the&nbsp;passage of the flood, and the riparian inhabitants receive&nbsp;timely warning of the impending inundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Embankments along Rivers to prevent Inundations.—</span><span class="font0">Where portions of a riverside town are situated below the maximum&nbsp;flood-level, or when it is important to protect land adjoining&nbsp;a river from inundations, the overflow of the river must be&nbsp;confined within continuous embankments on both sides. By&nbsp;placing these embankments somewhat back from the margin&nbsp;of the river-bed, a wide flood-channel is provided for the discharge of the river directly it overflows its banks, whilst leaving&nbsp;the natural channel unaltered for the ordinary flow. Low&nbsp;embankments may be sufficient where only exceptional summer&nbsp;floods have to be excluded from meadows. Occasionally the&nbsp;embankments are raised high enough to retain the floods during&nbsp;most years, whilst provision is made for the escape of the&nbsp;rare exceptionally high floods at special places in the embankments, where the scour of the issuing current is guarded against,&nbsp;and the inundation of the neighbouring land is least injurious.&nbsp;In this manner, the increased cost of embankments raised&nbsp;above the highest flood-level of rare occurrence is saved, and&nbsp;the danger of breaches in the banks from an unusually high&nbsp;flood-rise and rapid flow, with their disastrous effects, is avoided.&nbsp;Both the above methods afford the advantage of relieving the&nbsp;embanked channel of some of the sediment deposited in it&nbsp;by the confined flood-waters, when the surplus flow passes&nbsp;over the embankments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When complete protection from inundations is required, the embankments have to be raised well above the highest&nbsp;flood-level, after allowing for the additional rise resulting&nbsp;from the confinement of the flood within the embankments,&nbsp;instead of spreading over the low-lying land; and they have&nbsp;to be made perfectly watertight and strong enough to resist&nbsp;the water-pressure and current of the highest floods. The&nbsp;system has been very extensively adopted where large tracts&nbsp;of fertile alluvial land below flood-level stretch for long distances away from the river. Thus the fens of Lincolnshire,&nbsp;Cambridgeshire and Norfolk are protected from inundations&nbsp;by embankments along their rivers and drains; a great portion&nbsp;of Holland is similarly protected; and the plains of Lombardy&nbsp;are shut off from the floods of the Po by embankments along&nbsp;each side of the river for a distance of about 265 m., extending from Cornale, 89 m. below Turin, to its outlet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The system has been developed on a very extensive scale along the alluvial valley of the Mississippi, which is below the high flood-level&nbsp;of the river from Cape Girardeau, 45 m. above Cairo, to the Gulf&nbsp;of Mexico, and has a length of 600 m. in a straight line with a&nbsp;width ranging between 20 and 80 m., and an area of 29,790 sq. m.&nbsp;These embankments, having been begun by the French settlers in&nbsp;Ixjuisiana, are called levees, and have a total length of 1490 m.&nbsp;They, however, do not afford complete protection from inundations,&nbsp;as they are not quite continuous and are not always strong enough&nbsp;to withstand the water-pressure of high floods, which have at Vicksburg a maximum rise of 59 ft. above the lowest, stage of the river,&nbsp;and tend to increase in height owing, to the improved drainage&nbsp;following on the extension of cultivation. Breaches, or crevasses&nbsp;as they are termed in the United States, resulting from a deficiency&nbsp;in the strength or consistency of the banks, or from their being&nbsp;overtopped or eroded by the current, produce a sudden rush of the&nbsp;flood-waters through the opening, which is much more damaging&nbsp;to the land in the neighbourhood of the breach than a gradual&nbsp;inundation. Moreover, the velocity of the outflowing water is&nbsp;intensified by the sloping down of the land on these alluvial plains&nbsp;for some distance away from the river, owing to the raising of the&nbsp;ground nearest the river by the gradual deposit of layers of sediment&nbsp;from the flood-waters when they begin to overflow the river banks.&nbsp;The levees on the Mississippi are breached in weak places every year&nbsp;during the spring floods, and are liable to be destroyed along considerable lengths by the rapid erosion resulting from their being&nbsp;overtopped by exceptional floods at intervals of about ten years;&nbsp;and in places they are undermined and overthrown by changes in&nbsp;the course of the river from the caving-in of concave banks at Ixmds,&nbsp;necessitating reconstruction some distance back from the river at&nbsp;points thus threatened. When towns have been established below&nbsp;the flood-level of an adjoining river, like New Orleans on the&nbsp;Mississippi and Szegedin on the Theiss in Hungary, the channel of&nbsp;the river should be improved to facilitate the passage of floods past&nbsp;the town. The town also must be enclosed within very solid&nbsp;embankments, raised above the highest possible flood-level, to&nbsp;obviate the contingency of an exceptional flood, or a gradually&nbsp;raised flood-level, overtopping the protecting b^nk at a Tow part,&nbsp;leading to an inevitable breach and a catastrophe such as overwhelmed&nbsp;the greater part of Szegedin in March 1879.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Effect of Embankments in raising the River Bed.—</span><span class="font0">A most serious objection to the formation of continuous, high embankments along rivers bringing down considerable quantities&nbsp;of detritus, especially near a part where their fall has been&nbsp;abruptly reduced by descending from mountain slopes on to&nbsp;alluvial plains, is the danger of their bed being raised by deposit,&nbsp;producing a rise in the flood-level, and necessitating a raising of the embankments if inundations are to be prevented.&nbsp;Longitudinal sections of the Po taken in 1874 and 1901 show&nbsp;that its bed was materially raised in this period from the&nbsp;confluence of the Ticino to below Caranella, in spite of the&nbsp;clearance of sediment effected by the rush through breaches;&nbsp;and therefore the completion of the embankments, together&nbsp;with their raising, would only eventually aggravate the injuries&nbsp;of inundations they have been designed to prevent, as the&nbsp;escape of floods from the raised river must sooner or later&nbsp;occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The periodical devastating floods of the Hwang Ho or Yellow River in China are due to the raising of the bed of its embanked&nbsp;channel by detritus brought down from the hills, followed by the&nbsp;raising of the banks, whereby the river is forced to flow above the&nbsp;level of the plains. When the* river was first embanked, a considerable space was left between it and its banks on each side, which&nbsp;allowed for deviations in the channel, and also afforded a fair area&nbsp;for the deposit of detritus away from its bed, and a good width for&nbsp;the discharge of floods. Later, however, in order to appropriate&nbsp;and bring under regular cultivation the riparian land thus prudently&nbsp;left within the embankments and exposed to every flood, lines of&nbsp;inner embankments were formed close to the river, thereby greatly&nbsp;confining the flood-waters, and, consequently, raising the flood-level&nbsp;and the river-bed, besides exposing these embankments to undermining by merelya moderate change in position of the river channel.&nbsp;This reckless policy of securing additional land regardless of consequences has greatly contributed to the more frequent occurrence&nbsp;of the very widespread inundations resulting from the bursting of&nbsp;the vast volume of pent-up flood-waters through breaches in the&nbsp;banks, which descend with torrential violence upon the plains below,&nbsp;causing great destruction of life and property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The restriction of the floods on the lower Mississippi by the levees, placed about double the width apart of the ordinary channel, has&nbsp;caused the river to enlarge its very soft alluvial bed, resulting in a&nbsp;lowering of the water-line at the low stage; and it is, therefore,&nbsp;anticipated that the further scour by floods when the levées have&nbsp;been made continuous will, in this instance, prevent any material&nbsp;raising of the flood-level by the levees.</span></p>
