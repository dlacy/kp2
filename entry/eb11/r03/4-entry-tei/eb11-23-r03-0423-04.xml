               <p>                   <label>ROBINSON, SIR JOSEPH BENJAMIN</label> (1845- ), South African mine-owner,
                    was born at Cradock, Cape Colony, in 1845. At the age of sixteen he started
                    business as a general trader, wool-buyer and stock-breeder, but on the discovery
                    of diamonds in South Africa in 1867 he hastened to the Vaal river district,
                    where, by purchasing the stones from the natives and afterwards by buying
                    diamond-bearing land, notably at Kimberley, he soon acquired a considerable
                    fortune. He was mayor of Kimberley in 1880, and for four years was a
                    representative of Griqualand West in the Cape parliament. On the discovery of
                    gold in the Witwatersrand district in 1886, Robinson purchased the Langlaagte
                    and Randfontein estates. His views as to the westerly trend of the main
                    gold-bearing reef were entirely contrary to the bulk of South African opinion at
                    the time, but events proved him to be correct, and the enormous appreciation in
                    value of his various properties made him one of the richest men in South Africa.
                    As a Rand capitalist he stood aloof from combinations with other gold-mining
                    interests, and took no part in the Johannesburg reform movement, maintaining
                    friendly relations with President Kruger. He claimed that it was as the result
                    of his representations after the Jameson Raid that Kruger appointed the
                    Industrial Commission of 1897, whose recommendations—had they been carried
                    out—would have remedied some of the Uitlander grievances. In 1908 he was created
                    a baronet.</p>            </div>
