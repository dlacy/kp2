<p><span class="font1">REGIMEN, the regulation of diet with a view to preserve or restore health. See Dietetics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Regimen, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Grammar,</span><span class="font1"> that part of syntax, or construction, which regulates the dependency of words, and the alteration which one occasions in another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REGIMENT is a body of men, either horse, foot, or artillery, commanded by a colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, and a major. Each regiment of foot is divided into companies,&nbsp;but the number of companies differs. In Britain our regiments have generally ten companies, one of which always&nbsp;consists of grenadiers. Regiments of horse commonly consist of six troops, but there are some which contain nine.&nbsp;Dragoon regiments have generally in time of war eight&nbsp;troops, but in time of peace six only. Each regiment has a&nbsp;chaplain, quarter-master, adjutant, and surgeon. (See the&nbsp;article Army.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REGION, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geography,</span><span class="font1"> a large extent of land, inhabited by many people of the same nation, and inclosed within certain limits or bounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Region, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Physiology,</span><span class="font1"> is taken for a division of our atmosphere, which is divided into the upper, middle, and lower regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The upper region commences from the tops of the mountains, and reaches to the utmost limits of the atmosphere. In this region reign perpetual and equable calmness, clearness, and serenity. The middle region is that in which the&nbsp;clouds reside, and where meteors are formed, extending&nbsp;from the extremity of the lowest to the tops of the highest&nbsp;mountains. The lowest region is that in which we breathe,&nbsp;which is bounded by the reflection of the sun’s rays, or by&nbsp;the height to which they rebound from the earth. See&nbsp;Atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ethereal Region,</span><span class="font1"> in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cosmography,</span><span class="font1"> is the whole extent of the universe, in which is included all the heavenly bodies, and even the orb of the fixed stars.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Region, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anatomy,</span><span class="font1"> a division of the human body, otherwise called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cavity,</span><span class="font1"> of which anatomists reckon three, viz. the upper region, or that of the head ; the middle region,&nbsp;or that of the thorax or breast ; and the lower, being that&nbsp;of the abdomen or belly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REGIS, Peter Sylvain, a French philosopher, and a great propagator of the doctrines of Descartes, was born in&nbsp;Agenois in the year 1632. Hestudied languages and philosophy under the Jesuits at Cahors ; and as his views were&nbsp;then directed to the church, he was afterwards occupied in&nbsp;the study of divinity at the university of that town. His&nbsp;progress in learning was so uncommon, that at the end of&nbsp;four years he was offered a doctor’s degree without the usual&nbsp;charges; but he did not think it became him to accept&nbsp;of it till he had also studied in the Sorbonne at Paris. He&nbsp;went thither, but was soon disgusted with theology ; and as&nbsp;the philosophy of Descartes began at that time to make a&nbsp;noise, in consequence of the lectures of Rohault, he conceived a taste for, and gave himself up entirely to, the study&nbsp;of it. He frequented these lectures ; and becoming an adept,&nbsp;went to Toulouse in 1666, and read lectures himself. Having fine parts, a clear and fluent manner, and a happy way&nbsp;of making himself understood, he attracted all sorts of people ;&nbsp;the magistrates, the learned, the ecclesiastics, and the very&nbsp;women, who now all affected to abjure the ancient philosophy. In 1680 he returned to Paris, where the concourse&nbsp;which flocked to him was such that the sticklers for the peripatetic philosophy began to be alarmed. They applied to&nbsp;the Archbishop of Paris, who thought it expedient, in the&nbsp;name of the king, to put a stop to the lectures, which accordingly were discontinued for several months. The whole&nbsp;life of Regis was spent in propagating the new philosophy.&nbsp;In 1690 he published a formal system thereof, containing&nbsp;logic, metaphysics, physics, and morals, in three volumes 4∙to,&nbsp;written in French. It was reprinted the year after, at Amsterdam, with the addition of a discourse upon ancient and&nbsp;modern philosophy. He wrote afterwards several pieces&nbsp;in defence of his system, in which he had disputes with&nbsp;M. Huet, Duhamel, Malebranche, and others. His works,&nbsp;though abounding with ingenuity and learning, have been&nbsp;disregarded, in consequence of the great discoveries and&nbsp;advancement in philosophical knowledge which have since&nbsp;been made. He had been chosen member of the Academy&nbsp;of Sciences in 1699, and he died in 1707.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides his System of Philosophy, he wrote the following works: The Use of Reason and of Faith ; an Answer to&nbsp;Huet’s Censures of the Cartesian Philosophy ; an Answer&nbsp;to DuhameVs Critical Reflections; some pieces against&nbsp;Malebranche, to show that the apparent magnitude of an&nbsp;object depends solely on the magnitude of its image traced&nbsp;upon the retina ; and a small piece upon the question, Whether Pleasure constitutes our present Happiness ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REGISTER, a public book, in which are entered and recorded memoirs, acts, and minutes, to be had recourse to&nbsp;occasionally for knowing and proving matters of fact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REGISTRAR, an officer in the English universities, who has the keeping of all the public records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REGISTRATION, General, ofBirths, Baptisms, Marriages, Deaths, and Burials, in England and Wales. The first known public authority under which registers recording births or baptisms, marriages, deaths or burials, were&nbsp;systematically kept in England, was an injunction issued in&nbsp;September 1538 (30 Hen. VIII.), by Thomas Lord Cromwell, lord privy seal and vicegerent to the king, which enjoined, that in every parish a register-book should be kept&nbsp;in a coffer with two locks, by the parson, vicar, or curate,&nbsp;and churchwardens ; and that every Sunday, in the presence&nbsp;of one of the churchwardens, the parson, &amp;c. should enter in&nbsp;a register-book a written record of the dates and names of&nbsp;the weddings, christenings, and burials, of the preceding&nbsp;week ; by neglect of which duty he incurred a fine of three&nbsp;shillings and fourpence, to be employed in the repair of the&nbsp;church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1547, an injunction was issued by Edward VI. similar to that of 1538, excepting only that the penalty was directed “ to be employed to the poore-box” of the parish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Inquiry was directed, at the instance of Cardinal Pole, under Philipand Mary, in the years 1555 and 1557, whether&nbsp;the clergy had complied with these directions ; and in the&nbsp;first year of Queen Elizabeth, 1559, a further injunction was&nbsp;issued, which differed from that of Edward VI. in 1547 only&nbsp;in directing that the penalty should be divided between the&nbsp;poor-box and the repair of the church. These injunctions&nbsp;were not very strictly observed, as appears by the preamble&nbsp;of a bill to “ authorize every archbishop and bishop to erect&nbsp;one office of registership of all the church-books, to be kept&nbsp;in every diocese,” which, in March 1563, was read a first&nbsp;time in the House of Commons, but did not pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The great importance of registration was in 1590 represented to the Lord-treasurer Burghley, who, impressed with the force of the representation, communicated a plan to the&nbsp;Archbishop of Canterbury. Nothing, however, appears to&nbsp;have been done in consequence until October 1597, when a&nbsp;constitution was made by the archbishop, bishops, and clergy&nbsp;of the province of Canterbury, and approved hy the queen ;&nbsp;which notices the very great utility of parish-registers, and&nbsp;gives minute directions for keeping them, and for the transmission of a transcript yearly to the diocesan registrar. It&nbsp;appears, too, that persons were appointed for the purpose&nbsp;of ascertaining if the several orders had been complied&nbsp;with ; and that every minister, at institution, was required to&nbsp;declare that he would “ keep the register-book according&nbsp;to the queen’s majesty’s injunctions.”</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">In 1603, the first year of the reign of James I. another</span></h1><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
