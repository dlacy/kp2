In 1809 it was rebuilt from designs by Hake-will; the chapel, dedicated to St Lawrence, was added in 1820. At the tercentenary of the school in 1867 subscriptions were set on foot for founding scholarships, building additional schoolrooms, rebuilding or enlarging the chapel, and other objects. The chapel was rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1872. A swimming bath was erected in 1876; the Temple observatory, containing a fine equatorial refractor by Alvan Clark, was built in 1877, and the Temple reading room with the art museum in 1878. The workshops underneath the gymnasium were opened in 1880, and a new big school and class rooms were erected in 1885. There are three major and four minor exhibitions for students to any university in the United Kingdom. From about 70 in 1777 the numbers attending the school have increased to over 400. A great impulse was given to the progress of the school during the headmastership of Dr Arnold, 1827-1842. The best known of Arnold’s successors are Tait, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, and Temple, the present bishop of London. The parish church of St Andrew’s is, with the exception of the tower and the north arcade in the nave, entirely modern, having been built from designs by Mr Butterfield at a cost of £22,000, and reconsecrated in 1879. The daughter church of the Holy Trinity, a handsome building by Sir Gilbert Scott, in close proximity to St Andrew’s, was erected in 1853. St Marie’s Catholic Church is in the Early English style. A town-hall was erected in 1858, at a cost of £7000. There are a number of charities, including Laurence Sheriff’s almshouses (founded 1567), Elborow’s almshouses (1707), Miss Butlin’s almshouses (1851),and the hospital of StCross, opened in 1884, at a cost of £20,000. A public recreation ground was provided by the local government board in 1877. The town has an important cattle market. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 1617 acres) in 1871 was 8385, and in 1881 it was 9891.</p><p>Rugby was originally a hamlet of the adjoining parish of Clifton-on-Dunsmore, and is separately treated of as such in Domesday Book. Ernaldus de Bosco (Ernald de Bois), lord of the manor of Clifton, seems to have erected the first chapel in Rugby, in the reign of Stephen, about 1140. It was afterwards granted by him, with certain lands, to endow the abbey of St Mary, Leicester, which grant was confirmed by his successors and by royal charter of Henry II. In the second year of King John (1200) a suit took place between Henry de Rokeby, lord of the manor of Rugby, and l’aul, abbot of St Mary, Leicester, which resulted in the former obtaining possession of the advowson of Rugby, on condition of homage and service to the abbot of Leicester. By virtue of this agreement the chapel was converted into a parish church, and the vicarage into a rectory. In 1350 Ralph, Lord Stafford, became possessed of the manor and advowson of Rugby, and considerably enlarged the parish church. Subsequent alterations, notably in 1814 and 1831, left little of this structure remaining except the tower and north arcade in the nave. The advowson of Kugby is now the property of the earl of Craven ; and the late rector was widely known and honoured as “the poet pastor,” John Moultrie.</p><p>RUGE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Arnold</hi>  (1803-1880), German philosophical and political writer, was born at Bergen, in the island of Rügen, on the 13th September 1803. He studied at Halle, Jena, and Heidelberg, and became an enthusiastic adherent of the party which sought to create a free and united Germany. For his zeal in this cause he had to spend five years in the fortress of Kolberg, where he devoted himself to the study of classical writers, especially Plato and the Greek poets. On his release in 1830, he published <hi rend="italic">Schill und die Seinen,</hi>  a tragedy, and a translation of <hi rend="italic">(Edipus in Colonus.</hi>  Ruge settled in Halle, where in 1838, in association with his friend Echtermayer, he founded the <hi rend="italic">Hallesche JahrlAjxher für deutsche Eunst und Wissenschaft.</hi>  In this periodical, which soon took a very high place, he discussed all the great questions which were then agitating the best minds in Europe, dealing with them from the point of view of the Hegelian philosophy, interpreted in the most liberal sense. The <hi rend="italic">Jahrbücher</hi>  was detested by the orthodox party in Prussia ; but, as it was published in Leipsic, the editors fancied that it was beyond the reach of the Prussian Government. In 1840, however, soon after the accession of King Frederick William IV., they were ordered, on account of the name of the periodical, to have it printed in Halle, subject to the censorship there. Thereupon Ruge went to Dresden, and the <hi rend="italic">Jahrbücher</hi>  (with which Echtermayer was no longer connected) continued to appear in Leipsic, but with the title <hi rend="italic">Deutsche Jahrbücher,</hi>  and without the names of the editors. It now became more liberal than ever, and in 1843 was suppressed by the Saxon Government. In Paris Ruge tried to act with Karl Marx as co-editor of the <hi rend="italic">Dewtsch-Französische Jahrbücher,</hi>  but the two friends soon parted, Ruge having little sympathy with Marx’s socialist theories. Ruge next associated himself with a publishing firm in Zürich, and when it was put down he attempted to establish a firm of his own in Leipsic, but his scheme<hi rend="sup">-</hi>was thwarted by the Saxon Government. In the revolutionary movement of 1848 Ruge played a prominent part. He organized the Extreme Left in the Frankfort parliament, and for some time he lived in Berlin as the editor of the<hi rend="italic">Reform,</hi>  in which he advocated the opinions of the Left in the Prussian National Assembly. The career of the <hi rend="italic">Reform</hi>  being cut short by the Prussian Government, Ruge soon afterwards visited Paris, hoping to establish, through his friend Ledru-Rollin, some relations between German and French republicans; but in 1849 both Ledru-Rollin and Ruge had to take refuge in London. Here, in company with Mazzini and other advanced politicians, they formed a “ European Democratic Committee.” From this committee Ruge soon withdrew, and in 1850 he went to Brighton, where he supported himself by working both as a teacher in schools and as a writer. He took a passi mate interest in the events of 1866 and 1870, and as a publicist vigorously supported the cause of Prussia against Austria, and that of Germany against France. In his last years he received from the German Government a pension of 3000 marks. He died on the 31st December 1880.</p><p>Ruge was a man of generous sympathies and an able writer, but he did not produce any work of enduring importance. In 1846-48 his <hi rend="italic">Gesamnwlte Schriften</hi>  were published in ten volumes. After this time he wrote, among other books, <hi rend="italic">Unser System, Revolutionsnovellen, Die Loge des Humanismus,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Aus früherer Zeit</hi>  (bis memoirs). He also wrote many poems, and several dramas and romances, and translated into German various English works, including the <hi rend="italic">Letters of Junius</hi>  and Buckle’s <hi rend="italic">History of Civilization.</hi></p><p>RÜGEN, the largest island belonging to Germany, is situated in the Baltic Sea, immediately opposite the town of Stralsund, l£ miles off the north-west coast of Pomerania in Prussia, from which it is separated by the narrow Strelsasund. Its shape is exceedingly irregular, and its coast-line is broken by very numerous bays and peninsulas, sometimes of considerable size. The general name is applied by the natives only to the roughly triangular main trunk of the island, while the larger peninsulas, the landward extremities of which taper to very narrow necks of land, are considered to be as distinct from Rügen as the various adjacent smaller islands which are also statistically included under the name. The chief peninsulas are those of Jasmund and Wittow on the north, and Mönchgut, at one time the property of the monastery of Eldena, on the south-east ; and the chief neighbouring islands are Unmanz and Hiddensoe, both off the northwest coast. The greatest length of Rügen from north to south is 32 miles ; its greatest breadth is 251 miles ; and its area is 377 square miles. The surface gradually rises towards the west to Rugard (335 feet), the “eye of</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
