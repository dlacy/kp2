<p><span class="font1">affiliated peoples, whose centre was Alexandria, expressed their fancies in novels rather than in epics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When, about the lst century of the Christian era, verse gave place in general favour to rhetorical prose the&nbsp;greater ease of the style lent itself to more detailed narratives than the eclogue and love-poem ; and the sophist&nbsp;who might formerly have devoted his attention to poetry&nbsp;became in the decadence of Greek literature a writer of&nbsp;novels. From this period to the 10th century were published the works it is now proposed to analyse. The&nbsp;Greek novel being a late, and it must be confessed an&nbsp;inferior, kind of prose, it would be well if one could trace&nbsp;its rise, progress, and development. This is, however, impossible here; it is sufficient to refer in passing to the&nbsp;fables of primitive invention, the tales inserted by historians, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Atlantis</span><span class="font1"> of Plato, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cyropædia</span><span class="font1"> of Xenophon,&nbsp;the forged histories of Alexander, the fictitious lives of&nbsp;eminent men, the fabulous voyages,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> and the apocryphal&nbsp;sacred books of Christians and Jews, as supplying in turn&nbsp;material for building up the highly artificial novel which&nbsp;we find first represented by Iamblichus. One element&nbsp;may, however, be spoken of specially, although it is rather&nbsp;a forerunner of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tale</span><span class="font1"> as distinct from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">novel</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">romance.</span><span class="font1"> The Ionic Greeks, living under an Asiatic sky&nbsp;and corrupted by Oriental luxury, were the first to cultivate to any extent that kind of literature which, without&nbsp;demanding any intellectual labour, tickles the fancy by&nbsp;voluptuous pictures told in a brief and witty manner.&nbsp;Miletus was especially famous for such tales ; hence they&nbsp;were usually known as Milesian (Μιλψτιακά). What was&nbsp;their exact shape it is difficult to say, as they have entirely&nbsp;perished, leaving only the reputation of the universal&nbsp;favour they enjoyed. Perhaps the story of the Ephesian&nbsp;matron told by Petronius in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Satiræ,</span><span class="font1"> and (though less&nbsp;likely) that of Cupid and Psyche in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Asinus</span><span class="font1"> of Apuleius,&nbsp;are more closely allied to them than anything we now&nbsp;possess. They must be considered as a natural growth of&nbsp;the imagination, although some may have been contributed&nbsp;by Orientals or Egyptians ; and, while forming a portion&nbsp;of the materials upon which the later Hellenistic novel&nbsp;was constructed, they differed widely from it in form and&nbsp;matter. Ovid cannot be considered as a person easily&nbsp;shocked, yet in two passages of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tristia</span><span class="font1"> he says—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Junxit Aristides Milesia crimina secum ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Trust.,</span><span class="font0"> ii. 413).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Vertit Aristiden Sisenna, nec obfuit illi</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Historiæ turpes inseruisse joeos </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">” (ib.,</span><span class="font0"> 443-444).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Plutarch </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Crassus,</span><span class="font1"> 32) refers to the fact of a copy of this very translation by L. Cornelius Sisenna (a contemporary of Sulla) having been found in the baggage of a&nbsp;Roman officer, which gave occasion for Surenas to animadvert upon the Romans carrying with them infamous&nbsp;books during war time. This testimony gives sufficient&nbsp;indication of the nature of the Milesian tales. They&nbsp;must have been short and witty anecdotes, turning chiefly&nbsp;upon the subject of love in its grosser form, and may be&nbsp;regarded as the prototypes of the Italian n</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ovelle</span><span class="font1"> and the&nbsp;Provençal and French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fabliaux.</span><span class="font1"> All that remains to us&nbsp;consists of the names of a few writers and some imitations and translations. The best-known writer whose&nbsp;fame has reached us is Aristides of Miletus, though we are&nbsp;ignorant of his life and even of the age in which he lived.&nbsp;A more recent author of the same class was Clodius&nbsp;Albinus, the rival of Septimius Severus. We also hear of&nbsp;Ephesian, Cyprian, and Sybaritic tales, the last almost as&nbsp;famous as those of Miletus. Aristophanes (as well as Ovid)&nbsp;specially refers to them. Yet after all they exercised but&nbsp;little influence upon the Hellenistic novel beyond perhaps&nbsp;furnishing the more indecent incidents. The lost ’Ερωτικά&nbsp;of Clearchus of Soli, a pupil of Aristotle, may have been&nbsp;more closely connected with that branch of our subject.&nbsp;The love-stories (∏∈pι cpωτικωv </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">παθημάτων')</span><span class="font1"> of Parthenius&nbsp;of Nicæa are also different. They consist of thirty-six&nbsp;brief tales ending in an unfortunate manner, and were&nbsp;dedicated to Cornelius Gallus as forming subjects for poetical treatment. The author carefully indicates the sources&nbsp;whence he took them, thus giving a special value to his&nbsp;collection. He informs us that some were derived from&nbsp;“ the Milesian adventures ” of Hegesippus, and also mentions Naxian, Pallenian, Lydian, Trojan, and Bithynian&nbsp;tales. Like Parthenius, Conon was of the Augustan age,&nbsp;and compiled a collection of fifty narratives (∆ι^γψr∈ιs) of&nbsp;heroic times, relating chiefly to the foundation of colonies.&nbsp;They are analysed by Photius. Cervantes has used one&nbsp;of them in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eon Quixote.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> Strabo considered all those who had written about India down to his time as mere fictionists, and at their head he placed Daimachπs&nbsp;and Megasthenes. From the analysis furnished by Diodorus Siculus&nbsp;(ii. 55-60) of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fortunate Island</span><span class="font0"> of Iambulus we are led to believe&nbsp;that the writer, who lived before the 1st century, intended the work&nbsp;as a kind of social utopia similar to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Atlantis,—</span><span class="font0">full of marvels and&nbsp;surprises like all the other imaginary voyages.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">The first we hear of the Greek or Hellenistic novel is in the time of Trajan (c. 110), when Iamblichus, a Syrian by&nbsp;descent and a freeman, born and educated at Babylon,&nbsp;wrote in Greek his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Babylonixa,</span><span class="font1"> which is known from Suidas,&nbsp;Photius, and a scholium discovered by Henry Estienne on&nbsp;an ancient MS. of the latter writer. A complete codex&nbsp;existed in 1671 ; and a considerable fragment has been&nbsp;reprinted by Mai (A<sup>r</sup>ora </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coll. Script. Vet.,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 349, &lt;fcc.).&nbsp;Suidas states that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Babyloηixa</span><span class="font1"> consisted of thirty-nine&nbsp;books, but Photius, who gives a full abstract </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(^Bibliotheca,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">cod. 94), only mentions seventeen. The story is that of&nbsp;Sinonis and Rhodanes, married lovers, persecuted by&nbsp;Garmus, king of Babylon, who is fascinated by Sinonis.&nbsp;They fly, and are pursued by the royal eunuchs, who give&nbsp;them no peace through many adventurous scenes. A&nbsp;remarkable resemblance between the fugitives and another&nbsp;couple, Euphrates and Mesopotamia, is the chief subject of&nbsp;the plot. We now meet, incorporated in the works of&nbsp;writers whose dignity might be supposed above the suspicion of story-telling, short tales of a didactic nature, such&nbsp;as those given by Plutarch under the title “ On the Virtues&nbsp;of Women.” Dion Chrysostom, the most eminent of the&nbsp;rhetoricians and sophists, has also left among his orations&nbsp;a short novel called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Hunter.</span><span class="font1"> The narrator is supposed&nbsp;to have been wrecked on the shores of Eubœa and meets&nbsp;a hunter who tells him his history. Two married couples&nbsp;(the hunter and his wife being one) were living in friendly&nbsp;solitude, when one day a stranger came, and asking for&nbsp;money received all the recluses were able to give in the&nbsp;shape of two deerskins. The hunter goes to the city with&nbsp;the traveller, and his first impressions are happily told.&nbsp;He is frightened by the bustle and excitement, and debates&nbsp;with an idler upon the comparative advantages of town&nbsp;and country life. The return home is very delicately&nbsp;drawn. Lucian of Samosata, one of the chief essay-writers&nbsp;of the post-Christian age, has left two romances, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lucius or&nbsp;the</span><span class="font1"> Ass and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">True History,</span><span class="font1"> both of which have beeil&nbsp;briefly analysed in the article Lucian (vol. xv. p. 43).&nbsp;The former was considered by Photius (cod. 129) to have&nbsp;been taken from a fable by Lucius of Patræ and to have&nbsp;thus had a common origin with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Asinus</span><span class="font1"> of Apuleius ;&nbsp;others consider Lucian himself to have been the original&nbsp;inventor of the story. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">True History</span><span class="font1"> has been drawn&nbsp;on by Rabelais, Cyrano de Bergerac, Swift, and the author&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Baron Munchausen.</span><span class="font1"> Like the productions of more&nbsp;modern satirists, it loses much of its point and meaning&nbsp;when the allusions upon which the chief interest is based&nbsp;can no longer be understood. Rather of the nature of the&nbsp;fictitious voyage was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Wonders beyond Thule</span><span class="font1"> of Antonius&nbsp;Diogenes, only known from the account given by Photius</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
