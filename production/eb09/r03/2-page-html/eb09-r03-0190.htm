<p><span class="font1">a Polyzoan larva, while </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enteroplea</span><span class="font1"> is probably a male Rotifer, and, like the other males, in a reduced condition. There is no reason for&nbsp;considering this mastax as the homologue of either the gastric mill of&nbsp;Crustaceans on the one hand or the teeth in the Chætopods’ pharynx&nbsp;on the other ; it is merely homoplastic with these structures, but has&nbsp;attained a specialized degree of development. Both the pharynx&nbsp;and the oesophagus which follows it are lined with chitin. The&nbsp;œsopliagus varies in length and in some genera is absent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Philo-dinadæè,</span><span class="font1"> the stomach following immediately upon the pharynx.&nbsp;The stomach is generally large ; its wall consists of a layer of very&nbsp;large ciliated cells, which often contain fat globules and yellowish-green or brown particles, and outside these a connective tissue&nbsp;membrane ; muscular fibrillæ have also been described. Very&nbsp;constantly a pair of glands open into the stomach, and probably&nbsp;represent the hepato-pancreatic glands of other Invertebrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Following upon the stomach there is a longer or shorter intestine, which ends in the cloaca. The intestine is lined by ciliated cells.&nbsp;In forms living in an urceolus the intestine turns round and runs&nbsp;forward, the cloaca being placed so as to debouch over the margin&nbsp;of the urceolus. The cloaca is often very large ; the nephridia and&nbsp;oviducts may open into it, and the eggs lodge there on their way&nbsp;outwards ; they are thrown out, as are the fæcal masses, by an&nbsp;eversion of the cloaca. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Asplanchna, Notommata Sieboldii,</span><span class="font1"> and certain species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">AScomorpha</span><span class="font1"> are said to be devoid of intestine or&nbsp;anus, excrementitious matters being ejected through the mouth (11).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nephridia.—</span><span class="font1">The cœlom contains a fluid in which very minute corpuscles have been detected. There is no trace of a true vascular&nbsp;system. The nephridia (fig. 2, B, ri) present a very interesting&nbsp;stage of development. They consist of a pair of tubules with an&nbsp;intracellular lumen running up the sides of the body, at times&nbsp;merely sinuous, at others considerably convoluted. From these&nbsp;are given off at irregular intervals short lateral branches, each of&nbsp;which terminates in a flame-cell precisely similar in structure to&nbsp;the flame-cells found in Planarians, Trematodes, and Cestodes ;&nbsp;here as there the question whether they are open to the coelom or&nbsp;not must remain at present undecided. At the base these tubes&nbsp;open either into a permanent bladder which communicates with the&nbsp;cloaca or into a structure presenting apparently no advance in its&nbsp;development upon the contractile vacuole of a ciliate Infusorian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nerwus System &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SeTise-Organs.—</span><span class="font1">Various structures have been</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">spoken of as nervous which are now acknowledged to have been erroneously so described (18). There is a supra-cesophageal ganglion which often attains considerable dimensions, and presents a&nbsp;Iobed appearance (fig. 2, A and B, g). Connected with this are the&nbsp;eye-spots, which are seldom absent. Where these are most highly&nbsp;developed a lens-like structure is present, produced by a thickening of the cuticle. In the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifer</span><span class="font1"> and other forms these are&nbsp;placed upon the protrttsible portion of the head, and so appear to&nbsp;have different positions at different moments. The number of eye-spots varies from one to twelve or more. They are usually red, reddish-brown, violet, or black in colour. Other structures are found&nbsp;which doubtless act as sense-organs. The calcar above-mentioned&nbsp;generally bears at its extremity stiff hairs which have been demonstrated to be in connexion with a nerve fibril. On the ventral surface of the body just below the mouth a somewhat similar structure&nbsp;is often developed—the chin. There are besides at times special&nbsp;organs, like the two lateral organs in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Microcodon</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 1, d, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">s),</span><span class="font1"> which&nbsp;no doubt in common with the calcar and chin have a tactile function.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reproductive Organs and Development.—</span><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font1"> were formerly considered to be hermaphrodite, but, while the ovary was&nbsp;always clear and distinct, there was always some difficulty about&nbsp;the testis, and various structures were put forward as representing&nbsp;that organ. One by one, however, small organisms have been discovered and described as the males of certain species of Rotifers,&nbsp;until at the present time degenerated males are known to occur in&nbsp;all the families except that of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philodinadæ.</span><span class="font1"> Tlie male Rotifers&nbsp;are provided with a single circlet of cilia (a peritroch), a nerve&nbsp;ganglion, eye-spots, muscles, and nephridial tubules all in a somewhat reduced condition, but there is usually no trace of mouth or&nbsp;stomach, the main portion of the body being occupied by the testicular sac. There is an aperture corresponding with the cloaca of the&nbsp;female, where the testis opens into the base of an eversible penis.&nbsp;The males of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ftoscularia</span><span class="font1"> are shown in fig. 1. The male of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pedalion&nbsp;mira</span><span class="font1"> possesses rudimentary appendages. The ovary is usually a&nbsp;large gland lying beside the stomach connected with a short oviduct&nbsp;which opens into the cloaca. The ova often present a reddish hue&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Philodina roseola, BraehionUS ηιbens),</span><span class="font1"> due doubtless, like the red&nbsp;colour of many Crustacean ova, to the presence of tetronerythrin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Up to the present our embryological knowledge of the group is very incomplete. Many Rotifers are known to lay winter and&nbsp;summer eggs of different character. The winter eggs are provided&nbsp;with a thick shell and probably require fertilization. Two or three&nbsp;of them are often carried about attached to the parent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Brachionus,&nbsp;Notommata),</span><span class="font1"> but they are usually laid and fall into the mud, there&nbsp;to remain till the following spring. The summer eggs are of two&nbsp;kinds, the so-called male and female ova, both of which are stated&nbsp;to develop parthenogenetically. They may be carried about in&nbsp;large numbers in the cloaca or oviduct or attached to the body of&nbsp;the parent. The female ova give rise to female and the male ova&nbsp;to male individuals. Male individuals are only formed in the&nbsp;autumn in time to fertilize the winter ova.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Habitat and Mode of Life.—</span><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font2"> are distributed all over the earth’s surface, inhabiting both fresh and salt water. The greater number of species inhabit&nbsp;fresh water, occurring in pools, ditches, and streams. A&nbsp;few species will appear in countless numbers in infusions&nbsp;of leaves, &lt;kc., but their appearance is generally delayed&nbsp;until the putrefaction is nearly over. Species of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifer&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Philodina</span><span class="font2"> appear in this way. A few marine forms&nbsp;only have been described—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Brachionus miilleri, B. heptatonus, Synchæta baltica,</span><span class="font2"> and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A few forms are parasitic. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Albertia</span><span class="font2"> lives in the intestine of the earthworm ; a form has been described as occurring&nbsp;in the body-cavity of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Synapta ; </span><span class="font2">a small form was also&nbsp;observed to constantly occur in the velar and radial canals&nbsp;of the freshwater jelly-fish, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Limnocodium. Notommata&nbsp;parasitica</span><span class="font2"> leads a parasitic existence within the hollow&nbsp;spheres of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Volvox globator,</span><span class="font2"> sufficient oxygen being given&nbsp;off by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Volvox</span><span class="font2"> for its respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many Rotifers exhibit an extraordinary power of resisting drought. Various observers have dried certain species upon the slide, kept them dry for a certain length of time,&nbsp;and then watched them come to life very shortly after the&nbsp;addition of a drop of water. The animal draws itself together, so that the cuticle completely protects all the softer&nbsp;parts and prevents the animal itself from being thoroughly&nbsp;dried. This process is not without parallel in higher&nbsp;groups ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font2"> many land snails will draw themselves far into&nbsp;the shell, and secrete a complete operculum, and can remain&nbsp;in this condition for an almost indefinite amount of time.&nbsp;The eggs are also able to withstand drying, and are probably blown about from place to place. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font2"> can&nbsp;bear great variations of temperature without injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Since their removal from among the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protozoa</span><span class="font2"> various attempts have been made to associate the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font2"> with&nbsp;one or other large phylum of the animal kingdom.&nbsp;Huxley, insisting upon the importance of the trochal disk,&nbsp;put forward the view that they were “ permanent Echino-derm larvæ,” and formed the connecting link between&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nemeriidæ</span><span class="font2"> and the Nematoid worms. Ray Lankester&nbsp;proposed to associate them with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chætopoda</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Arihropoda</span><span class="font2"> in a group </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Appendiculata,</span><span class="font2"> the peculiarities in&nbsp;the structure of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pedalion</span><span class="font2"> forming the chief reason for&nbsp;such a classification. There is, however, no proof that we&nbsp;thus express any genetic relationship. The well-developed&nbsp;cœlom, absence of metameric segmentation, persistence of&nbsp;the trochal disk in varying stages of development, and the&nbsp;structure of the nephridia are all characters which point to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font2"> as very near representatives of the common&nbsp;ancestors of at any rate the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mollusca, Arihropoda,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chætopoda.</span><span class="font2"> But the high development of the mastax,&nbsp;the specialized character of the lorica in many forms, the&nbsp;movable spines of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Polyarthra,</span><span class="font2"> the limbs of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pedalion,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;the lateral appendages of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Asplanchna,</span><span class="font2"> the existence of a&nbsp;diminutive male, the formation of two varieties of ova, all&nbsp;point to a specialization in the direction of one or other of&nbsp;the above mentioned groups. Such specialization is at&nbsp;most a slight one, and does not justify the definite association of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font2"> in a single phylum with any of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Classification.—</span><span class="font2">The following classification has been recently put forward by Dr C. T. Hudson </span><span class="font0">(19).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Class ROTIFERA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order I.—Rhizota.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fixedforms ; foot attached, transversely wrinkled, non-retractile truncate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fam. 1.' Flosculariadæ. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Floscularia, Stephanoceros.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fam. 2. Melicertadæ. t </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Melicerta, Cephalosiphon, Megalo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trocha, Lirnnias, Æcistes, Lacinularia, Conochilus.</span></p>
