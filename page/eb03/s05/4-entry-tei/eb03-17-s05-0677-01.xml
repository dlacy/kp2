in dioptrics, a machine conſiſting of two lenſes set in ſilver, horn, &amp;c. to aſſiſt the defects of the organ of sight. Old people, and others who have flat eyes, uſe convex ſpectacles, which cauſe the rays of light converge ſo as to meet upon the retina: whereas myopes, or ſhort-sighted people, uſe concave lenſes for ſpectacles, which cauſes the rays to diverge, and prevent their meeting ere they reach the retina. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> n⁰ 73.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ocular</hi> SPECTRA, images preſented to the eye after removing them from a bright object, or cloſing them. When any one has long and attentively looked at a bright object, as at the ſetting ſun, on cloſing his eyes, or removing them, an image, which reſembles in form the object he was attending to, continues firme time to be viſible. This appearance in the eye we ſhall call the ocular ſpectrum of that object.</p><p>Theſe ocular ſpectra are of four kinds : 1st, Such as are owing to a leſs ſenſibility of a defined part of the retina or ſpectra from defect of ſenſibility. 2d, Such as are owing to a greater ſenſibſlity of a defined part of the retina, or ſpectra from exceſs of ſenſibility. 3d, Such as reſemble their object in its colour as well as form ; which may be termed direct ocular spectra. 4tl1, Such as are of a colour contrary to that of their object, which may be termed reverſe ocular ſpectra.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
