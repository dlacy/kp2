(Thomas), a learned and reſpectable prelate of the church of England, was born, in 1693, at a village called <hi rend="italic">Sibthorp,</hi> in the vale of Belvoir, Nottinghamſhire. His father was a Proteſtant diſſenter, a pious, virtuous, and ſenſible man; who having a small paternal fortune, followed no profession. His mother was the daughter of Mr George Brough, a ſubſtantial gentleman farmer of Shelton in the ſame county. He received his education at ſeveral private ſchools and academies in the country, being obliged, by various accidents, to change his maſters frequently.</p><p>Notwithſtanding this diſadvantage, he had at the age of 19 not only made a conſiderable progreſs in Greek and Latin, and read the beſt writers in both languages, but had acquired a knowledge of French, Hebrew, Chaldee, and Syriac; had learned geography, logic, algebra, geometry, conic ſections, and gone through a courſe of lectures on Jewiſh antiquities and other points, preparatory to the critical ſtudy of the Bible. He had been deſtined by his father for orders among the Diſſenters. With this view, during the latter years of his education, his ſtudies were chiefly turned towards divinity, in which he had made ſuch quick advances, that by the time he was 23 he had carefully read over a great part of the Scriptures, particularly the New Teſtament, in the original, and the beſt comments upon it; Euſebius’s Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, The Apoſtolical Fathers, Whiſton’s Primitive Chriſtianity, and the principal writers for and againſt Miniſterial and Lay Conformity—- But though the reſult of theſe inquiries was a well- grounded belief of the Chriſtian revelation, yet not being at that time able to decide on ſome abſtruſe ſpeculative doctrines, nor to determine abſolutely what communion he ſhould embrace; he reſolved, like a wiſe and honeſt man, to purſue ſome profeſſion, which ſhould leave him at liberty to weigh thoſe things more maturely in his thoughts, and not oblige him to declare or teach publicly opinions which were not yet thoroughly ſettled in his own mind.</p><p>In 1716, therefore, he applied himſelf to the ſtudy of phyſic, and after gaining all the medical knowledge he<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0236.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0230"/>
could, by reading the uſual preparatory books, and attending the beſt lectures during that and the following winter in London, in order to improve himſelf farther, in January 1718-19 he went to Paris. There he lodged in the ſame houſe with the famous anatomiſt Mr Winſlow, whoſe lectures he attended, as he did thoſe of the materia medica, chemiſtry, and botany, at the king’s gardens. The operations of ſurgery he ſaw at the <hi rend="italic">Hotel Dieu,</hi> and attended alſo for ſome time M. Gregoire, the accoucheur, but without any deſign of ever practiſing that or any other branch of ſurgery. Here he became acquainted with Mr Martin Benſon, afterwards biſhop of Glouceſter, one of the moſt agreeable and virtuous men of his time; with whom he quickly became much connected, and not many years after was united to him by the ſtricteſt bonds of affinity as well as affection.</p><p>During the whole of Mr Secker's continuance at Paris, he kept up a conſtant correſpondence with Mr Joſeph Butler, afterwards biſhop of Durham, with whom he became acquainted at the academy of one Mr Tones, kept firſt at Glouceſter, and afterward at Tewkſhury. Mr Butler having been appointed preacher at the Rolls on the recommendation of Dr Clarke and Mr Edward Talbot, ſon to biſhop Talbot, he now took occaſion to mention his friend Mr Secker, without Secker’s knowledge, to Mr Talbot, who promiſed, in caſe he choſe to take orders in the church of England, to engage the biſhop his father to provide for him. This was communicated to Mr Secker in a letter from Mr Butler about the beginning of May 1720. He had not at that time come to any reſolution of quitting the ſtudy of phyſic; but he began to foreſee many obſtacles to his purſuing that profeſſion; and having never diſcontinued his application to theology, his former difficulties both with regard to conformity and ſome other doubtful points had gradually leſſened, as his judgment became ſtronger, and his reading and knowledge more extenſive. It appears alſo from two of his letters ſtill in being, written from Paris to a friend in England, (both of them prior to the date of Mr Butler’s above- mentioned), that he was greatly diſſatisfied with the diviſions and diſturbances which at that particular period prevailed among the Diſſenters.</p><p>In this ſtate of mind Mr Butler’s unexpected propoſal found him; which he was therefore very well diſpoſed to take into conſideration; and after deliberating on the ſubject of ſuch a change for upwards of two months, he reſolved at length to embrace the offer, and for that purpoſe quitted France about the beginning of Auguſt 1720.</p><p>On his arrival in England, he was introduced to Mr Talbot, with whom he cultivated a cloſe acquaintance; but it was unfortunately of very fhort duration; for in the month of December that gentleman died of the ſmall-pox. This was a great ſhock to all his friends, who had juſtly conceived the higheſt expectations of him; but eſpecially to an amiable lady whom he had lately married, and who was very near linking under ſo ſudden and grievous a ſtroke. Mr Secker, beſide ſharing largely in the common grief, had peculiar reaſon to lament an accident that ſeemed to put an end to all his hopes; but he had taken his reſolution, and he determined to perſevere. It was ſome encouragement to him to find that Mr Talbot had, on his death-bed, recommended him, together with Mr Benſon and Mr Butler, to his father’s notice. Thus did that excellent young man (for he was but 29 when he died), by his nice diſcernment of characters, and his conſiderate good nature, provide moſt effectually, in a few ſolemn moments, for the welfare of that church from which he himſelf was ſo prematurely ſnatched away; and at the ſame time raiſed up, when he leaſt thought of it, the trueſt friend and protector to his wife and unborn daughter; who afterwards found in Mr Secker all that tender care and aſſiſtance which they could have hoped for from the neareſt relation.</p><p>It being judged neceſſary by Mr Secker’s friends that he ſhould have a degree at Oxford; and having been informed, that if he ſhould previouſly take the degree of Doctor in Phyſic at Leyden, it would probably help him in-obtaining the other, he went over and took his degree there in March 1721: and, as part of his exerciſe for it, he compoſed and printed a diſſertation <hi rend="italic">de Medicina Statica.</hi> which is ſtill extant, and is thought by the gentlemen of that proſeſſion to be a ſenfible and learned performance.</p><p>In April the ſame year, he entered himſelf a gentleman commoner of Exeter college, Oxford; after which he obtained the degree of Bachelor of Arts, in consequence of the chancellor’s recommendatory letter to the convocation.</p><p>He now ſpent a conſiderable part of his time in London, where he quickly gained the eſteem of ſome of the moſt learned and ingenious men of thoſe days, particularly of Dr Clarke, rector of St James’s, and the celebrated dean Berkeley, afterwards biſhop of Cloyne, with whom he every day became more delighted, and more cloſely connected. He paid frequent viſits of gratitude and friendſhip to Mrs Talbot, widow of Mr Edward Talbot, by whom ſhe had a daughter five months after his deceaſe. With her lived Mrs Catharine Benſon, ſiſter to biſhop Benſon, whom in many reſpects ſhe greatly reſembled. She had been for ſeveral years Mrs Talbot’s inſeparable companion, and was of unſpeakable ſervice to her at the time of her huſband’s death, by exerting all her courage, activity, and good ſenſe (of which ſhe poſſeſſed a large ſhare), to ſupport her friend under ſo great an affliction, and by afterwards attending her ſickly infant with the utmoſt care and tenderneſs, to which, under Providence, was owing the preſervation of a very valuable life.</p><p>Biſhop Talbot being in 1721 appointed to the ſee of Durham, Mr Secker was in 1722 ordained deacon by him in St James’s church, and prieſt not long after in the ſame place, where he preached his firſt ſermon March 28. 1723. The biſhop’s domeſtic chaplain at that time was Dr Rundle, a man of warm fancy and very brilliant converſation, but apt ſometimes to be carried by the vivacity of his wit into indiſcreet and ludicrous expreſſions, which created him enemies, and, on one occaſion, produced diſagreeable conſequences.—. With him Mr Secker was ſoon after aſſociated in the biſhop’s family, and both taken down by his lordſhip to Durham in July 1723.</p><p>In the following year the biſhop gave Mr Secker the rectory of Houghton-le-Spring. This preferment putting it in his power to fix himſelf in the world, in a manner agreeable to his inclinations, he ſoon after made a propoſal of marriage to Mrs Benſon; which being ac-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0237.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0231"/>
cepted, they were married by biſhop Talbot in 1725. At the earneſt requeſt of both, Mrs Talbot and her daughter conſented to live with them, and the two families from that time became one.</p><p>About this time biſhop Talbot alſo gave preferments to Mr Butler and Mr Benſon, whoſe riſe and progreſs in the church is here interwoven with the hiſtory of Mr Secker. In the winter of 1725-6, Mr Butler firſt publiſhed his incomparable ſermons; on which, as Dr Beilby Porteous and Dr Stinton inform us, Mr Secker took pains to render the ſtyle more familiar, and the author’s meaning more obvious: yet they were at laſt by many called obſcure. Mr Secker gave his friend the ſame aſſiſtance in that noble work the Analogy of Religion, &amp; c.</p><p>He now gave up all the time he poſſibly could to his reſidence at Houghton, applying himſelf with alacrity to all the duties of a country clergyman, and ſupporting that uſeful and reſpectable character throughout with the ſtricteſt propriety. He omitted nothing which he thought would be of uſe to the ſouls and bodies of the people entruſted to his care. He brought down his converſation and his fermons to the level of their underſtandings; he viſited them in private, he catechiſed the young and ignorant, he received his country neighbours and tenants very kindly and hoſpitably, and was of great ſervice to the poorer ſort of them by his ſkill in phyſic, which was the only uſe he ever made of it. Though this place was in a very remote part of the world, yet the ſolitude of it perfectly ſuited his ſtudious diſpoſition, and the income ariſing from it bounded his ambition. Here he would have been content to live and die; here, as he has often been heard to declare, he ſpent ſome of the happieſt hours of his life; and it was no thought or choice of his own that removed him to an higher and more public ſphere; but Mrs Secker’s health, which now began to be very bad, and was thought to be injured by the dampneſs of the ſituation, obliged him to think of exchanging it for a more healthy one. Accordingly, an exchange was made through the friendly interpoſition of Mr Benſon (who generouſly ſacrificed his own intereſt on this occaſion, by relinquiſhing a prebend of his own to ſerve his friend) with Dr Finney, prebendary of Durham, and rector of Ryton; and Mr Secker was inſtſtuted to Ryton and the prebend June 3. 1727. For the two following years he lived chiefly at Durham, going every week to officiate at Ryton, and ſpending there two or three months together in the ſummer.</p><p>In July 1732 he was appointed chaplain to the king; for which favour he was indebted to Dr Sherlock, who having heard him preach at Bath, had conceived the higheſt opinion of his abilities, and thought them well worthy of being brought forward into public notice. From that time an intimacy commenced between them, and he received from that great prelate many ſolid proofs of eſteem and friendſhip,</p><p>His month of waiting at St James’s happened to be Auguſt, and on Sunday the 27th of that month he preached before the queen, the king being then abroad. A few days after, her majeſty ſent for him into her cloſet, and held a long and gracious converſation with him; in the courſe of which he took an opportunity of mentioning to her his friend Mr Butler. He alſo, not long after this, on Mr Talbot’s being made lord chancellor,</p><p>found means to have Mr Butler effectually recommended to him for his chaplain. The queen alſo appointed him clerk of her cloſet; from whence he roſe, as his talents became more known, to thoſe high dignities which he afterwards attained.</p><p>Mr Secker now began to have a public character, and ſtood high in the eſtimation of thoſe who were allowed to be the beſt judges of merit: he had already given proofs of abilities that plainly indicated the eminence to which he muſt one day riſe, as a preacher and a divine; and it was not long before an opportunity offered of placing him in an advantageous point of view. Dr Tyrrwhit, who ſucceeded Dr Clarke as rector of St James’s in 1729, ſound that preaching in ſo large a church endangered his health. Biſhop Gibſon, therefore, his father-in-law, propoſed to the crown that he ſhould be made reſidentiary of St Paul’s, and that Mr Secker ſhould ſucceed him in the rectory. This arrangement was ſo acceptable to thoſe in power, that it took place without any difficulty. Mr Secker was inſtituted rector the 18th of May 1733; and in the beginning of July went to Oxford to take his degree of Doctor of Laws, not being of ſufficient ſtanding for that of divinity. On this occaſion it was that he preached his celebrated Act Sermon, on the advantages and duties of academical education, which was univerſally allowed to be a maſterpiece of ſound reaſoning and juſt compoſition: it was printed at the deſire of the heads of houſes, and quickly paſſed through ſeveral editions. It is now to be found in the ſecond collection of Occaſional Sermons, publiſhed by himſelf in 1766.</p><p>It was thought that the reputation he acquired by this ſermon, contributed not a little toward that promotion which very ſoon followed its publication. For in December 1734, he received a very unexpected notice from biſhop Gibſon, that the king had fixed on him to be biſhop of Briſtol. Dr Benſon was about the ſame time appointed to the ſee of Glouceſter, as was Dr Fleming to that of Carliſle; and the three new biſhops were all conſecrated together in Lambeth Chapel, Jan. 19. 1734-5, the conſecration-ſermon being preached by Dr Thomas, afterwards biſhop of Wincheſter.</p><p>The honours to which Dr Secker was thus raiſed in the prime of life did not in the leaſt abate his diligence and attention to buſineſs; for which, indeed, there was now more occaſion than ever. His learned biographers, Meſſrs Porteous and Stinton, now relate the manner in which he ſet about the viſitation of his dioceſe, and the ceremony of confirmation, which he performed in a great number of places; he alſo preached in ſeveral churches, ſometimes twice a-day. The affairs of his pariſh of St James’s being likewiſe in great diſorder, he took extraordinary pains to regulate and adjuſt every thing, particularly the management of the poor; and thus became of ſignal ſervice to his pariſhioners, even in a temporal view. But, ſay our authors, “it was their ſpiritual welfare which engaged, as it ought to do, his chief attention. As far as the circumſtances of the times, and the populouſneſs of that part of the metropolis allowed, he omitted not even thoſe private admonitions and perſonal applications which are often attended with the happieſt effects. He allowed out of his own income a ſalary for reading early and late prayers, which had formerly been paid out of the offertory money. He held a confirmation once every year, and ex-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0238.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0232"/>
amined the candidates ſeveral weeks before in the veſtry, and gave them religious tracts, which he alſo diſtributed at other times very liberally to thoſe that needed them. He drew up, for the uſe of his pariſhioners, that admirable courſe of <hi rend="italic">Lectures on the Church Catechiſm</hi> which hath been lately publiſhed, and not only read them once every week on the uſual days, but alſo every Sunday evening, either at the church or one of the chapels belonging to it.”</p><p>The ſermons which at the ſame time, we are told, he ſet himſelf to compoſe, “were truly excellent and original. His faculties were now in their full vigour, and he had an audience to ſpeak before that rendered the Utmoſt exertion of them neceſſary. He did not, however, ſeek to gratify the higher part, by amuſing them with refined ſpeculations, or ingenious eſſays, unintelligible to the lower part, and unprofitable to both; but he laid before them all, with equal freedom and plainneſs, the great Chriſtian duties belonging to their reſpective ſtations, and reproved the follies and vices of every rank among them, without diſtinction or palliation. He ſtudied human nature thoroughly in all its various forms, and knew what ſort of arguments would have moſt weight with each claſs of men. He brought the ſubject home to their boſoms, and did not ſeem to be merely laying uſeful things in their preſence, but addreſſing himſelf perſonally to every one of them. Few ever poſſeſſed, in a higher degree, the rare talent of touching on the moſt delicate ſubjects with the niceſt propriety and decorum, of ſaying the moſt familiar things without being low, the plaineſt without being feeble, the boldeſt without giving offence. He could deſcend with ſuch ſingular eaſe and felicity into the minuteſt concerns of common life, could lay open with ſo much addreſs the various workings, artifices, and evaſions of the human mind, that his audience often thought their over particular caſes alluded to, and heard with ſurpriſe their private ſentiments and feelings, their ways of reaſoning and principles of acting, exactly ſtated and deſcribed. His preaching was, at the ſame time, highly rational, and truly evangelical. He explained with perſpicuity, he aſſerted with dignity, the peculiar characteriſtic doctrines of the goſpel. He inculcated the utility, the neceſſity of them, not merely as ſpeculative truths, but as actual inſtruments of moral goodneſs, tending to purify the hearts and regulate the lives of men; and thus, by God’s gracious appointment, as well as by the inſeparable connection between true faith and right practice, leading them to ſalvation.</p><p>“Theſe important truths he taught with the authority, the tenderneſs, the familiarity, of a parent inſtructing his children. Though he neither poſſeſſed nor affected the artificial eloquence of an orator who wants to amuſe or to miſlead, yet he had that of an honeſt man who wants to convince, of a Chriſtian preacher who wants to reform and to ſave thoſe that hear him. Solid argument, manly ſenſe, uſeful directions, ſhort, nervous, ſtriking ſentences, awakening queſtions, frequent and pertinent applications of ſcripture; all theſe following each other in quick ſucceſſion, and coming evidently from the ſpeaker’s heart, enforced by his elocution, his figure, his action, and above all by the correſponding ſanility of his example, ſtamped conviction on the minds of his hearers, and ſent them home with impreſſions not eaſy to be effaced. It will readily be</p><p>imagined that with theſe powers he quickly became one of the moſt admired and popular preachers of his time.”</p><p>In 1737 he ſucceeded to the ſee of Oxford, on the promotion of Dr Potter to that of Canterbury, then vacant by the death of Archbiſhop Wake.</p><p>In the ſpring of 1 748, Mrs Secker died of the gout in her ſtomach. She was a woman of great ſenſe and merit, but of a weak and ſickly conſtitution. The biſhop’s affection and tenderneſs for her was ſuited to his character. In 1750, he was inſtilled dean of St Paul’s, for which he gave in exchange the rectory of St James’s and his prebend of Durham. “It was no wonder (ſay our authors) that, after preſiding over ſo extenſive and populous a pariſh for upwards of 17 years, he ſhould willingly conſent to be releaſed from a burden which began now to grow too great for his ſtrength. When he preached his farewel ſermon, the whole audience melted into tears: he was followed with the prayers and good wiſhes of thoſe whom every honeſt man would be moſt ambitious to pleaſe; and there are numbers ſtill living who retain a ſtrong and grateful remembrance of his inceſſant and tender ſolicitude for their welfare. Having now more leiſure both to proſecute his own ſtudies and to encourage thoſe of others, he gave Dr Church conſiderable aſſiſtance in his <hi rend="italic">First and Second Vindication of the Miraculous Powers,</hi> &amp; c. againſt Dr Middleton, and he was of equal uſe to him in his <hi rend="italic">Analysis of Lord Bolingbroke’s Works.</hi> About the ſame time began the late Archdeacon Sharp’s controverſy with the followers of Mr Hutchinſon, which was carried on to the end of the year 1755.” Biſhop Secker, we are told, read over all Dr Sharp’s papers, amounting to three volumes 8vo, and corrected and improved them throughout. But the eaſe which this late change of ſituation gave him was ſoon diſturbed by a heavy and unexpected ſtroke, the loſs of his three friends, Biſhops Butler, Benſon, and Berkeley, who were all cut off within the ſpace of one year.</p><p>Our authors next give an account of the part which Dr Secker bore, in the Houſe of Lords, in reſpect to the famous repeal of the Jew bill; for which the duke of Newcaſtle moved, and was ſeconded by the Biſhop, in a ſpeech which, we are told, was remarkably well received. At length his diſtinguiſhed merit prevailed over all the political obſtacles to his advancement, and placed him, without any efforts or application of his own, in that important ſtation which he had ſhown himſelf ſo well qualified to adorn. On the death of archbiſhop Hutton, he was promoted to the ſee of Canterbury, and was confirmed at Bow-church, April 21. 1758; on which occaſion our authors obſerve, that in accepting this high and burdenſome ſtation, Dr Secker acted on that principle which influenced him through life; that he ſacriſiced his own eaſe and comfort to conſiderations of public utility; that the mere ſecular advantages of grandeur were objects below his ambition; and were, as he knew and felt, but poor compenſations for the anxiety and difficulties attending them. He had never once through his whole life aſked preferment for himſelf, nor ſhown any unbecoming eagerneſs for it; and the uſe he made of his newly acquired dignity very clearly ſhowed, that rank, and wealth, and power, had in no other light any charms for him, than as they enlarged the ſphere of his active and induſtrious benevolence.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0239.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0233"/>
He ſought out and encouraged men of real genius or extenſive knowledge; he expended 300 l. in arranging and improving the manuſcript library at Lambeth; and obſerving with concern, that the library of printed books in that palace had received no additions ſince the time of Archbiſhop Tenniſon, he made it his buſineſs to collect books in all languages from moſt parts of Europe at a very great expence, with a view of ſupplying that chaſm; which he accordingly did, by leaving them to the library at his death, and thereby rendered that collection one of the nobleſt and moſt uſeful in the kingdom.</p><p>All deſigns and inſtitutions which tended to advance good morals and true religion, he patronized with zeal and generoſity: he contributed largely to the maintenance of ſchools for the poor; to rebuilding or repairing parſonage houſes and places of worſhip; and gave no leſs than 600 l. towards erecting a chapel in the pariſh of Lambeth. To the ſociety for promoting Chriſtian knowledge he was a liberal benefactor; and to that for propagating the goſpel in foreign parts, of which he was the preſident, he paid much attention; was constant at all the meetings of its members, even ſometimes when his health would but ill permit, and ſuperintended their deliberations with conſummate prudence and temper.</p><p>Whenever any publications came to his knowledge that were manifeſtly calculated to corrupt good morals, or ſubvert the foundations of Chriſtianſty, he did his utmoſt to ſtop the circulation of them; yet the wretched authors themſelves he was ſo far from wiſhing to treat with any undue rigour, that he has more than once extended his bounty to them in diſtreſs. And when their writings could not properly be ſuppreſſed (as was too often the cafe) by lawful authority, he engaged men of abilities to anſwer them, and rewarded them for their trouble. His attention was everywhere. Even the falſehoods and miſrepreſentation of writers in the newſpapers, on religious or eccleſiaſtical ſubjects, he generally took care to have contradicted; and when they ſeemed likely to injure, in any material degree, the cauſe of virtue and religion, or the reputation of eminent and worthy men, he would ſometimes take the trouble of anſwering them himſelf. One inſtance of this kind, which does him honour, and deferves mention, was his defence of Biſhop Butler, who, in a pamphlet publiſhed in 1767, was accuſed of having died a Papiſt. The conduct which he obſerved towards the ſeveral diviſions and denominations of Chriſtians in this kingdom was ſuch as ſhowed his way of thinking to be truly liberal and catholic. The dangerous ſpirit of popery, indeed, he thought ſhould always be kept under proper legal reſtraints, on account of its natural oppoſition not only to the religious but the civil rights of mankind. He therefore obſerved its movements with care, and exhorted his clergy to do the same, eſpecially thoſe who were ſituated in the midſt of Roman Catholic families; againſt whoſe influence they were charged to be upon their guard, and were furniſhed with proper books or inſtructions for that purpoſe. He took all fit opportunities of combating the errors of the church of Rome in his own writings<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> See particularly his ſermons on the rebellion in 1745; on the Proteſtant working ſchools in Ireland; on the 5th of November; and a great number of occaſional paſſages to the ſame purpoſe, in various parts of his lectures, ſermons, and other works.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi>; and the beſt anſwers that were publiſhed to ſome of the late bold apologies for popery were written at his inſtance, and under his direction.</p><p>With the Diſſenters his Grace was ſincerely deſirous of cultivating a good underſtanding. He conſidered them, in general, as a conſcientious and valuable claſs of men. With ſome of the moſt eminent of them, Watts, Doddridge, Leland, Chandler, Lardner, he maintained an intercourſe of friendſhip or civility. By the moſt candid and conſiderate part of them he was highly reverenced and eſteemed; and to ſuch among them as needed help he ſhowed no leſs kindneſs and liberality than to thoſe of his own communion.</p><p>Nor was his concern for the Proteſtant cauſe confined to his own country. He was well known as the great patron and protector of it in various parts of Europe; from whence he had frequent applications for aſſiſtance, which never failed of being favourably received. To ſeveral foreign Proteſtants he allowed penſions, to others he gave occaſional relief, and to ſome of their univerſities was an annual benefactor.</p><p>In public affairs, his Grace acted the part of an honeſt citizen, and a worthy member of the Britiſh legiſlature. From his firſt entrance into the Houſe of Peers, his parliamentary conduct was uniformly upright and noble. He kept equally clear from the extremes of factious petulance and ſervile dependence; never wantonly thwarting adminiſtration from motives of party zeal or private pique, or perſonal attachment, or a paſſion for popularity; nor yet going every length with every miniſter from views of intereſt or ambition. He admired and loved the conſtitution of his country, and wiſhed to preſerve it unaltered and unimpaired. So long as a due regard to this was maintained, he thought it his duty to ſupport the meaſures of government; but whenever they were evidently inconſiſtent with the public welfare, he opposed them with freedom and firmneſs. Yet his oppoſition was always tempered with the utmoſt fidelity, reſpect, and decency, to the excellent prince upon the throne; and the moſt candid allowances for the unavoidable errors and infirmities even of the very beſt miniſters, and the peculiarly difficult ſituation of thoſe who govern a free and high-ſpirited people. He ſeldom ſpoke in parliament, except where the intereſts of religion and virtue ſeemed to require it; but whenever he did, he ſpoke with propriety and ſtrength, and was heard with attention and deference. Though he never attached himſelf blindly to any ſet of men, yet his chief political connections were with the late Duke of Newcaſtle and Lord Chancellor Hardwicke. To theſe he principally owed his advancement; and he had the good fortune to live long enough to ſhow his gratitude to them or their deſcendants.</p><p>During more than ten years that Dr Secker enjoyed the ſee of Canterbury, he reſided conſtantly at his archiepiſcopal houſe at Lambeth. A few months before his death, the dreadful pains he felt had compelled<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0240.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0234"/>
him to think of trying the Bath waters; but that deſign was ſtopped by the fatal accident which put an end to his life.</p><p>His Grace had been for many years ſubject to the gout, which, in the latter part of his life, returned with more frequency and violence, and did not go off in a regular manner, but left the parts affected for a long time very weak, and was ſucceeded by pains in different parts of the body. About a year and a half before he died, after a fit of the gout, he was attacked with a pain in the arm, near the ſhoulder, which having continued about <hi rend="italic">12</hi> months, a ſimilar pain ſeized the upper and outer part of the oppoſite thigh, and the arm ſoon became eaſier. This was much more grievous than the former, as it quickly diſabled him from walking, and kept him in almoſt continual torment, except when he was in a reclining poſition. During this time he had two or three fits of the gout; but neither the gout nor the medicines alleviated theſe pains, which, with the want of exerciſe, brought him into a general bad habit of body.</p><p>On Saturday July 30. 1768, he was ſeized, as he ſat at dinner, with a ſickneſs at his ſtomach. He recovered before night; but the next evening, while his phyſicians were attending, and his ſervants raiſing him on his couch, he ſuddenly cried out that his thigh-bone was broken. The ſhock was ſo violent, that the ſervants perceived the couch to ſhake under him, and the pain fo acute and unexpected, that it overcame the firmneſs he ſo remarkably poſſeſſed. He lay for ſome time in great agonies; but when the ſurgeons arrived, and diſcovered with certainty that the bone was broken, he was perfectly reſigned, and never afterwards aſked a queſtion about the event. A fever ſoon enſued. On Tueſday he became lethargic, and continued ſo till about five o’clock on Wedneſday afternoon, when he expired with great calmneſs, in the 75th year of his age.</p><p>On examination, the thigh-bone was found to be carious about four inches in length, and at nearly the ſame diſtance from its head. The diſeaſe took its riſe from the internal part of the bone, and had ſo entirely deſtroyed its ſubſtance, that nothing remained at the part where it was broken but a portion of its outward integument; and even this had many perforations, one of which was large enough to admit two fingers, and was filled with a fungous ſubſtance ariſing from within the bone. There was no appearance of matter about the caries, and the ſurrounding parts were in a ſound ſtate. It was apparent that the torture which he underwent during the gradual corroſion of this bone muſt have been inexpreſſibly great. Out of tenderneſs to his family he ſeldom made any complaints to them, but to his phyſicians he frequently declared his pains were ſo excruciating, that unleſs ſome relief could be procured he thought it would be impoſſible for human, nature to ſupport them long. Yet he bore them for upwards of ſix months with aſtoniſhing patience and fortitude; ſat up generally the greater part of the day, admitted his particular friends to ſee him, mixed with his family at the uſual hours, ſometimes with his uſual cheerfulneſs; and, except ſome very ſlight defects of memory, retained all his faculties and ſenſes in their full vigour till within a few days of his death. He was buried, purſuant to his own directions, in a covered paſſage, leading from a private door of the palace to the north door of Lambeth church; and he forbade any monument or epitaph to be placed over him.</p><p>By his will he appointed the Rev. Dr Daniel Burton, canon of Chriſt-church, and Mrs Catherine Talbot, already mentioned in the courſe of theſe memoirs, his executors; and left 13,000 1. in truſt to the Dr Porteous and Stinton, his chaplains; to pay the intereſt thereof to Mrs Talbot and her daughter during their joint lives, or the life of the ſurvivor; and after the deceaſe of both thoſe ladies, 11,000 l. of the ſaid 13,000 l. are to be transferred to charitable purpoſes; amongſt which are 1000 1. to the Society for the Propagation of the Goſpel, and 1000 1. to the ſame ſociety for a biſhop or biſhops in the king’s dominions in America.</p><p>The following deſcription is given of his perſon: He was tall and comely; in the early part of his life ſlender, and rather conſumptive; but as he advanced in years his conſtitution gained ſtrength, and his ſize increaſed, yet never to a degree of corpulency that was diſproportionate or troubleſome.</p><p>The dignity of his form correſponded with the greatneſs of his mind, and inſpired at all times reſpect and awe; but peculiarly ſo when he was engaged in any of the more ſolemn functions of religion, into which he entered with ſuch devout earneſtneſs and warmth, with ſo juſt a conſciouſneſs of the place he was in, and the buſineſs he was about, as ſeemed to raiſe him above himſelf, and added new life and ſpirit to the natural gracefulneſs of his appearance.</p><p>His countenance was open, ingenuous, and expreſſive of every thing right. It varied eaſily with his ſpirits and his feelings, ſo as to be a faithful interpreter of his mind, which was incapable of the leaſt diſſimulation. It could ſpeak dejection, and, on occaſion, anger, very ſtrongly; but when it meant to ſhow pleaſure or approbation, it ſoftened into a moſt gracious ſmile, and diffuſed over all his features the moſt benevolent and reviving complacency that can be imagined.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
