<p><span class="font2">RIO GRANDE DO SUL, or in full Säo Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul, a city of Brazil, in the province of the&nbsp;same name, near the mouth of the estuary of Rio Grande.&nbsp;Including the suburbs it is a place of from 30,000 to&nbsp;35,000 inhabitants (1880), with a considerable trade and&nbsp;various manufactures. The bar at the mouth of the&nbsp;“ Rio ” does not admit vessels of full 10-feet draught ;&nbsp;but dredging operations undertaken by the Government in&nbsp;1882 are considerably increasing the depth. In 1881-84&nbsp;a railway was constructed from Rio Grande do Sul to&nbsp;Bage, 125 miles inland. The average annual value of the&nbsp;imports in the six official years ending June 30, 1882,&nbsp;was about £589,043, reckoning the milreis at 2s. In&nbsp;1881 651 vessels (133,779 tons) crossed the bar inwards,&nbsp;and 555 (133,276) outwards. Among the foreign vessels&nbsp;the British are most numerous. The imports are very&nbsp;various, to supply the colonies of Germans, Italians, &amp;c.,&nbsp;settled throughout the province; the exports on the other&nbsp;hand are mainly hides, skins, bones, hair, tallow, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rio Grande do Sul was a long time the chief town of the captaincy of El Rei (which included both the present province of&nbsp;Rio Grande do Sul and that of Santa Catharina). It was first&nbsp;founded as an encampment of Portuguese troops in 1737 on the south&nbsp;side of the Rio Grande. The settlement was removed to its present&nbsp;site by Gomes Ereire d’Andrade in 174δ. The Spaniards occupied&nbsp;this part of the country from 1763 to 1776. In 1807 the two&nbsp;districts of Sào Pedro and Santa Catharina were united and erected&nbsp;into a province with Sào José de Porto Alegre for its chief town ;&nbsp;and, though Rio Grande was declared a city in 1809, Porto Alegre&nbsp;retained its position even after the separation into two comarcas in&nbsp;1812. The name of the province has been rendered familiar in&nbsp;Europe through the remarkable success which has attended the&nbsp;establishment of German and Italian agricultural colonies. In&nbsp;1872 there were 36,458 foreigners in the province to 330,564 freeborn Brazilians and 67,791 slaves ; and by 1882 it was estimated&nbsp;that the German population alone amounted to 102,000, while the&nbsp;Italians, who began to immigrate in 1875, were rapidly approaching&nbsp;50,000. The first German settlement was that of Sào Leopoldo on&nbsp;the Rio do Sino, founded by Dorn Pedro I. in 1825. By 1830 the&nbsp;inhabitants numbered 5000, and in 1854 the town was made a&nbsp;municipium. Others of the same nationality are Novo Mundo&nbsp;(1850), Nova Petropolis (1858), Santa Maria da Soledade, Marato,&nbsp;Sào Benedicto, Sào Salvador, Montenegro, Feliz, Teutonia (1858),&nbsp;Estrella (1856), Santa Cruz (1849), Mont Alverne, Germania, Sào&nbsp;Lorenzo (1858), Santa Clara, Säo Silvano, Domingos, &amp;c. The&nbsp;principal Italian colonies are Caxias, Conde d’Eu, Donna Isabel, and&nbsp;Sil viera Martins, which in 1884 had respectively 13,680, 6287, 9595,&nbsp;and 6000 inhabitants. The success of these colonies is one of the&nbsp;most important elements in the development of the Brazilian&nbsp;empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RIOM, a town of France, with 9590 inhabitants, at the head of an arrondissement in the department of Puy-de-Dôme, 8 miles north of Clermont-Ferrand on the railway&nbsp;to Paris, occupies an eminence on the left bank of the&nbsp;Ambène (a left-hand tributary of the Allier) rising above&nbsp;the fertile plain of Limagne. It is surrounded with boulevards and has wide streets, but the houses, being built of&nbsp;black lava, have a rather sombre appearance. Some date&nbsp;from the 15th and 16th centuries, with turrets and ancient&nbsp;carved work. The church of St Amable goes back to the&nbsp;12th century, but has suffered by repeated restorations.&nbsp;The old ducal palace (now occupied by the court of appeal,&nbsp;etc.) has a collection of portraits of Auvergne celebrities.&nbsp;A feature in the town is the fountains, of which some are&nbsp;of the Renaissance period. Riom trades in the products&nbsp;of Limagne—grain, wine, hemp, preserved fruits, and&nbsp;especially a conserve of apricots—and has a tobacco manufactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Riom </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Rieomagus</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rieomum</span><span class="font1"> of the Romans) was long the rival of Clermont. Along with Auvergne it was seized for the crown by&nbsp;Philip Augustus, and it was the capital of this province under&nbsp;the dukes of Berri and Bourbon. During the religious wars it&nbsp;long held with the League. Its courts of law, always famous, are&nbsp;associated with the memory of D’Aguesseau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIONERO IN VOLTURE, a city of Italy, in the province of Potenza, 4 miles from Atelia, is pleasantly situated at the foot of Monte Voiture, has the repute of being the&nbsp;best built and best kept of the towns of the Basilicata, and&nbsp;has long been distinguished by the industrious character&nbsp;of its inhabitants (11,383 in 1881). It does not seem to&nbsp;be older than the first half of the 17th century. In 1851&nbsp;it suffered severely from the earthquake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIOT is “an unlawful assembly which has actually begun to execute the purpose for which it assembled by a&nbsp;breach of the peace and to the terror of the public. A&nbsp;lawful assembly may become a riot if the persons assembled&nbsp;form and proceed to execute an unlawful purpose to the&nbsp;terror of the people, although they had not that purpose&nbsp;when they assembled ” (Stephen, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Digest of the Criminal&nbsp;Law,</span><span class="font2"> art. 73). The above is the definition of a riot at&nbsp;common law in England. The offence is the most grave&nbsp;kind of breach of the peace known to the law, short of&nbsp;treason. In its previous stages it may be an affray, an unlawful assembly, or a riot, according to circumstances, and&nbsp;it may, if carried far enough, become treason. An affray&nbsp;is the fighting of two or more persons in the public street.&nbsp;An unlawful assembly is an assembly of three or more&nbsp;persons λvith intent to commit a crime by force or carry out&nbsp;a common purpose, lawful or unlawful, in such a way as to&nbsp;give reasonable grounds for fearing a breach of the peace.&nbsp;A rout is an unlawful assembly which has made a motion&nbsp;towards the execution of its common purpose. If the&nbsp;unlawful assembly should begin to demolish a particular&nbsp;inclosure, that would be a riot ; if it should proceed to&nbsp;pull down all inclosures, that would be treason. It was&nbsp;considered as early as the 14th century that the common&nbsp;law gave an insufficient remedy against riot. In 1360 the&nbsp;statute of 34 Edw. III. c. 1 gave jurisdiction to justices&nbsp;to restrain, arrest, and imprison rioters. In 1393 the&nbsp;statute of 17 Rie. II. c. 8 conferred similar powers on the&nbsp;sheriff and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">posse comitαtus.</span><span class="font2"> Numerous other Acts extending the common law were passed, especially in the Tudor&nbsp;reigns (see Stephen, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Criminal Law,</span><span class="font2"> vol. i.&nbsp;p. 202). The effect of existing legislation is to constitute&nbsp;certain statutory offences similar to riot at common law.&nbsp;The earliest Act now in force is one commonly called the&nbsp;Riot Act, 1 Geo. I. st. 2, c. 5. That Act makes it the duty&nbsp;of a justice, sheriff, mayor, or other authority, wherever&nbsp;twelve persons or more are unlawfully, riotously, and&nbsp;tumultuously assembled together to the disturbance of the&nbsp;public peace, to resort to the place of such assembly&nbsp;and read the following proclamation :—“ Our Sovereign&nbsp;Lady the Queen chargeth and commandeth all persons&nbsp;being assembled immediately to disperse themselves, and&nbsp;peaceably to depart to their habitations or to their lawful&nbsp;business, upon the pains contained in the Act made in the&nbsp;first year of King George for preventing tumultuous and&nbsp;riotous assemblies. God save the Queen.” It is a felony&nbsp;punishable with penal servitude for life to obstruct the&nbsp;reading of the proclamation or to remain or continue&nbsp;together unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously for one&nbsp;hour after the proclamation was made or for one hour&nbsp;after it would have been made but for being hindered.&nbsp;The Act requires the justices to seize and apprehend all&nbsp;persons continuing after the hour, and indemnifies them</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
