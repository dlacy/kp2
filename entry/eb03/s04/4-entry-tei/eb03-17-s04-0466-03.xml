or SIPHANTO, an iſland of the Archipelago, to the west of Paros, to the north-eaſt of Milo, and to the ſouth-west of Serphanto. The air is ſo good here, that many of the inhabitants live to the age of 120; and their water, fruits, wild fowl, and poultry, are excellent, but more eſpecially the grapes. It abounds with marble and granite, and is one of the moſt fertile and beſt cultivated of theſe iſlands. The inhabitants employ themſelves in cultivating olive-trees and capers ; and they have very good silk. They trade in figs, onions, wax, honey, and ſtraw-hats ; and may be about 8000 in all. E. Long. 25. 15. N. Lat. 37. 9.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
