<p><span class="font0">and as such is crossed by the auditory columellar chain. The infra-temporal bridge or jugal arch is formed by the jugal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(qj</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;fig. 12), which joins the descending process of the squamosal,&nbsp;and the quadrato-jugal, which is very small and partly fused with&nbsp;the lateral side of the quadrate. Now, between the quadrate on&nbsp;the one side and the squamoso+quadrato-jugal+jugal on the&nbsp;other, is enclosed a gap, met with only in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> of recent&nbsp;reptiles. This fourth, or quadrato-squamosal foramen, with its&nbsp;squamoso-quadrato-jugal bridge, is, as a rule, not mcntloned,&nbsp;being too small to be obvious. The quadrate is very firmly&nbsp;fixed. On the ventral side of the cranium we notice the broad&nbsp;and long bony palate, the large vomers, and the pterygoids&nbsp;meeting in the middle fine; aside of the vomers are the long&nbsp;posterior nares; posteriorly the pterygoids diverge to rest upon&nbsp;short basi-sphenoid processes, and they articulate by short&nbsp;flanges with the quadrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">*The occipital condyle is kidney-shaped, triple, composed of the basi and the lateral occipitals. The dorsal median roof of the&nbsp;cranium is formed by the paired parietals, near their anterior&nbsp;symphysis with the large pineal foramen, the paired frontals,&nbsp;nasals and premaxillaries. The outer nares are surrounded&nbsp;by the premaxillaries, maxillaries and nasals. Prefrontals and&nbsp;postfrontals exist. There is a* complete cartilaginous, interorbital septum, and a cranial columella, a pair of upright&nbsp;buttresses arising in the alisphenoidal walls, connecting the&nbsp;parietals with the pterygoids. The hyoid apparatus consists of&nbsp;a narrow base, with three pairs of arches; of these the first&nbsp;or hyoid arch is variously connected with the cranium near the&nbsp;paroccipital process, or with the extracolumella (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Middle&nbsp;Ear,</span><span class="font0"> below) ; the others are a long and stout pair of first and a&nbsp;smaller pair of second branchial arches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodiles.—</span><span class="font0">The temporal region is still bridged over by three arches, dividing the whole fossa into three, very much as in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon.</span><span class="font0"> The supratemporal foramen is bordered by the&nbsp;parietal, postfrontal (postorbital absent) and squamosal. The&nbsp;posttemporal foramen is very much reduced, sometimes to a&nbsp;narrow passage between the parietal, occipitals and squamosal,&nbsp;because the latter bone forms an extensive suture with the&nbsp;paroccipital process. The infratemporal or lateral fossa is wide&nbsp;and rather shallow, bordered above by the postfrontal and&nbsp;squamosal, in front by the postfrontal and jugal, below by thc&nbsp;jugal and quadrato-jugal, behind by the latter, the quadrate,&nbsp;tip of the paroccipital and the squamosal. The quadrato-jugal&nbsp;being long and in an almost horizontal position, being wedged&nbsp;in between the jugal and nearly the whole length of the lateral&nbsp;edge of the quadrate, and there being no squamoso-quadrato-jugal bridge, the fourth foramen of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> is absent. The&nbsp;middle-ear cavity is reduced to a complicated system of narrow&nbsp;passages; one for the passage of the extra-columellar-mandi-bular string of the auditory chain (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ear,</span><span class="font0"> below), between the&nbsp;quadrate, paroccipital and lateral occipital bones; another&nbsp;passage </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Eustachian)</span><span class="font0"> opens in the roof of the mouth, between&nbsp;basioccipital and basisphenoid; a .third joins that of the other&nbsp;side and forms with it a median opening between the same&nbsp;bones, just behind the posterior pterygoid border of the choanae.&nbsp;These nares, being in the recent crocodiles shifted as far back&nbsp;as possible, communicate with the outer nostrils by very long&nbsp;passages, formed by the whole length of the pterygoids, palatines,&nbsp;maxillaries, vomers and pre-maxillaries, all of which form a long&nbsp;median suture. But this long bony palatal roof is interrupted&nbsp;by a pair of large palatal foramina, bordered usually by palatine,&nbsp;Pterygoid, ectopterygoid, or transverse bone and maxillary.&nbsp;On the dorsal side of the cranium we notice the parietals fused&nbsp;into an unpaired bone, without a pineal hole and the likewise&nbsp;unpaired frontal. There are a pair of postfrontals, prefrontals&nbsp;and Iacrymals perforated by the naso-lacrymal duct. The&nbsp;nasals vary much in length, mostly in conformity with that of&nbsp;the maxillaries; as a rule they reach the short premaxillaries;&nbsp;but not always the nasal groove. (For taxonomic detail see&nbsp;under Crocodile.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The occipital condyle is formed mainly by the basioccipital, which always borders part of the foramen magnum, but the&nbsp;lateral occipitals each send a flange to it, which in immature&nbsp;specimens still partakes of the articulation with the atlas. The&nbsp;opisthotic and epiotic bones fuse early with the lateral and with&nbsp;Supraoccipital bones; only the proötic remains longer as a&nbsp;separate element, anteriorly with a large hole for the exit of the&nbsp;third branch of the trigeminal nerve. The basisphenoid is&nbsp;scarcely visible, being overlaid by the pterygoids. The presphenoid is larger, continued forwards and upwards into the&nbsp;inter-orbital septum, which remains mostly cartilaginous. Near&nbsp;the anterior and upper margin of the pre-sphenoid is a large notch&nbsp;on either side for the passage of the optic nerve, the three eye-muscle nerves and the first branch of the trigeminal. The place&nbsp;of the Orbitosphenoids is taken by membrane or cartilaginous&nbsp;continuations of the interorbital septum, but the alisphenoids&nbsp;are large and abut upwards against the frontals and with a lateral&nbsp;flange against the postfrontals. These send down a conspicuous&nbsp;process which forms sutures with an upward process of the jugal&nbsp;and another of the ectopterygoid; it is this compound pillar&nbsp;which partly divides the orbit from the infratemporal or lateral&nbsp;fossa. The size of these and the upper temporal fossae stand in&nbsp;an inverse ratio to each other. The upper fossae are still&nbsp;comparatively large in the long-snouted </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gavialis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tomis-toma,</span><span class="font0"> whilst these holes almost completely disappear in the&nbsp;alligators, namely, in the broad- and short-snouted members of&nbsp;the order, which chew their prey. In extinct Crocodilians the&nbsp;upper fossae were the larger. The temporo-mandibular muscle&nbsp;which lifts or shuts the lower jaw arises from the walls of the&nbsp;upper fossa, passes beneath the jugal-arch and is inserted upon&nbsp;the supra-angular portion of the lower jaw. In the more recent&nbsp;crocodiles this muscle is more and more superseded by the&nbsp;pterygo-mandibular muscle, which, arising chiefly from the dorsal&nbsp;surface of the much-broadened pterygoid, fills the widened space&nbsp;between the latter and the quadrate, and is inserted into the outer&nbsp;surface of the angular bone. The arrangement of this muscle&nbsp;secures a more advantageous leverage of the jaw, and is capable&nbsp;of more powerful development than the other, which is consequently on the wane—a nice illustration of onward, ortho-genetic evolution. The dentary bones of the under jaw form a&nbsp;suture, later a symphysis; this is very long in the long-snouted&nbsp;genera, in which the splenials likewise form a long symphysis;&nbsp;in the others the mandibular symphysis is much shorter and the&nbsp;splenials remain widely separated. Thearticular bone is short,&nbsp;forms a transverse cup for the quadrate, or a saddle-shaped cup,&nbsp;and is perforated by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Siphonium</span><span class="font0"> (see below under </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ear).</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;angle is upturned, formed by the articular, angular and,&nbsp;laterally, by the supra-angular bone; the opercular or counterpart of the splenial lies on the outer side, forming part of the&nbsp;anterior border of the oval foramen in the jaw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Chelonian skull agrees in many important features with that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> and of the crocodiles, but it is composed of&nbsp;fewer bones, the ectopterygoids, Iacrymals and postorbitals&nbsp;being absent, often also the nasals, unless they are fused with the&nbsp;prefrontals. The vomer is unpaired and forms a septum between&nbsp;the nasal passages, which, except in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis,</span><span class="font0"> are ventrally&nbsp;roofed over to a variable extent by wings sent out by the&nbsp;palatines, joining the sides of the vomer. AIost of the configurations of the other cramai bones are well represented in the&nbsp;accompanying figures. The palatines form a continuous broad&nbsp;floor with the pterygoids, which are extensively and firmly&nbsp;joined to the quadrates and to tbe basisphenoid. There are no&nbsp;Eustachian tubes. The occipital condyle is distinctly triple and&nbsp;the basioccipital is frequently excluded from the foramen&nbsp;magnum. The lateral occipitals early send out a pair of stout&nbsp;wings, the ventral of which joins a stout Ventrilateral process&nbsp;of the basioccipital, both forming a thick knob especially in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone,</span><span class="font0"> and a dorsolateral wing, which broadly joins the large&nbsp;opisthotic bone. This connects the lateral occipital and the&nbsp;Supraoccipital with the upper portion of the quadrate. On the&nbsp;top of the quadrate and upon the lateral dorsal portion of this&nbsp;compound transverse process (which of course corresponds to&nbsp;the paroccipital process of crocodiles, &amp;c.) lies the squamosal,&nbsp;about which more presently. The two wings of the lateral</span></p>
