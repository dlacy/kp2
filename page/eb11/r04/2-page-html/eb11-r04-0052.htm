There are three of these&nbsp;which require special notice—each of them compiled from&nbsp;documentary sources of ante-Justinian law.

The Breviary&nbsp;exercised great influence in western Europe; and there is no question&nbsp;that, until the rise of the Bologna school in the end of the nth&nbsp;century, it was from it more than from, the books of Justinian that&nbsp;western Europe, other than Italy, acquired its scanty knowledge of&nbsp;Roman law.</span></p>
