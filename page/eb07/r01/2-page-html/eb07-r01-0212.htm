<p><span class="font0">quence on the imagination and the feelings. “ If the af- fections in themselves,” says Bacon, “ were pliant and obe- dient to reason, it were true there should be no great use of persuasions and insinuations to the will, more than of&nbsp;naked proposition and proofs. But in regard of the continual mutinies and seditions of the affections, reason would&nbsp;become captive and servile if eloquence of persuasions did&nbsp;not practise and win the imagination from the affections’ part,&nbsp;and contract a confederacy between the reason and imagination against the affections. For the affections themselves&nbsp;carry ever an appetite to good, as reason doth : the difference&nbsp;is, that the affection beholdeth merely the present ; reason&nbsp;beholdeth the future and sum of time. And therefore, the&nbsp;present filling the imagination more, reason is commonly&nbsp;vanquished : but after that the force of eloquence and persuasion hath made tilings future and remote appear as present, then upon the revolt of the imagination reason pre-vaileth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But this is a department in which rhetoric can aid the student less than in any other. As it is the field in which&nbsp;genius gathers its fairest harvest, so it is also that which she&nbsp;is called on chiefly to cultivate from her own resources.&nbsp;No rules, and no study or experience, will qualify one for&nbsp;attaining this loftiest stage of eloquence, unless the mind&nbsp;glows spontaneously with that warmth and depth of feeling&nbsp;which its exertions aim at communicating to the breasts of&nbsp;others. To the active and searching intellect, whose suggestions, operating on the stores of knowledge possessed by&nbsp;the writer or speaker, lead him to the sources and instruments of conviction in the argumentative part of his task,&nbsp;and whose acuteness and energy can be incalculably aided&nbsp;by philosophical and critical study, and by experimental&nbsp;practice,—to this foundation and groundwork of success&nbsp;must be added, for the acquisition of excellence in impassioned eloquence, natural powers to which external aids can&nbsp;minister but weakly. A very few observations, therefore,&nbsp;may suffice on this head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The philosophy of those regions of the human mind on which eloquence here seeks to work, must be learned, not&nbsp;from rhetoric, but from consciousness, observation, and the&nbsp;systematic study of the mental philosophy. It is most usual&nbsp;to consider the class of mental phenomena which are here&nbsp;brought into play as embracing only the active principles&nbsp;of human nature ; but the student will unquestionably gain&nbsp;many incidental hints which would otherwise have escaped&nbsp;his notice, and will probably find his general view over this&nbsp;province of the art made at once clearer and wider, if he&nbsp;investigates with reference to it the whole of that class of&nbsp;phenomena which Thomas Brown ranks together in his&nbsp;analysis of the emotions, in their three genera of the immediate, retrospective, and prospective, and their subdivision&nbsp;(still more valuable for the present purpose) into those&nbsp;which do, and those which do not, involve the feelings that&nbsp;form the criterion of the objects of the moral faculty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All advices which rhetoric can give on the subject are immediate corollaries from one part of the proposition laid&nbsp;down as our definition ; namely, that the emotion sought to&nbsp;be produced excludes the action of the discursive faculties.&nbsp;The moment an argument, or a hint towards one, is suggested by the impassioned portions of a discourse, the emotion begins to be chilled, and the effect is lost. The emo&nbsp;tion is generated through the excitement of the imagination ; and this fact, with the exclusion of argument, is nearly all that art can here teach. “ The first and most important point to be observed in every address to any passion, sentiment, feeling, &amp;c. is, that it should not be introduced as such, and plainly avowed.” This rule follows both&nbsp;from the principles just laid down, and from another consideration : if the feeling sought to be excited is wrong, the&nbsp;avowal of the intention is manifestly destructive : if it is&nbsp;right and honourable, the self-love of those whom we address is offended by having it hinted that they are deficient&nbsp;in it. Another rule, following from the instrumentality of&nbsp;the imagination, teaches us that conciseness, which in argument is a virtue if it does not degenerate into obscurity, is&nbsp;in the impassioned parts of a discourse always a positive,&nbsp;fault. The imagination is operated on, not by general,&nbsp;views, but by special circumstances, by pictures held up&nbsp;to it and brought close that they may be distinctly seen.&nbsp;On this, as on other questions connected with the impassioned parts of a discourse, Cicero, himself one of the greatest proficients in this branch, peculiarly attached to its study,&nbsp;and inclined to undervalue other sections of the art, has&nbsp;thrown out, in his attractively desultory fashion, hints that&nbsp;are extremely instructive. A third rule, nearly akin to the&nbsp;last, which may indeed be considered as a portion of it,&nbsp;prescribes an examination and knowledge of all those circumstances which are chiefly instrumental in affecting the&nbsp;feelings ; and Campbell has ably illustrated this precept,&nbsp;classing the most obvious of such circumstances under the&nbsp;seven heads of “ probability, plausibility” (which he considers as different from probability in kind, not in degree),&nbsp;“ importance, proximity of time, connection of place, relation of the actors or sufferers to the hearers or speaker, and&nbsp;interest of the hearers or speaker in the consequences.’’&nbsp;But, fourthly, such an examination will discover to us many-circumstances which tend to check the flow of feeling, and&nbsp;against which consequently we must guard. Among these,&nbsp;a prominent place is occupied by tediousness, a fault into&nbsp;which the second rule just propounded may entice those&nbsp;who want a complete apprehension of its principle. “ Nothing,” says an ancient critic, “ dries up more quickly than&nbsp;a tear ;” and what is thus true of the softer feelings, is equally so of the more vehement : none of them can be adequately supported by eloquence for more than a certain period,&nbsp;the length of which an impassioned orator must learn from&nbsp;his own consciousness and observation, being always, however, in danger of extending its limits too far, rather than of&nbsp;unduly restricting them. Appeals to the sense of the ludicrous by means of wit or humour may, if well supported, be&nbsp;responded to for a much longer time than the serious emotions, even although they should be conducted with little&nbsp;variety and intermission ; but no class of feelings is more&nbsp;completely inconsistent with the exercise of the reasoning&nbsp;faculties ; and a discourse which rests its strength solely&nbsp;or mainly on the use of ridicule, thereby shows that, whatever the author’s motives may be for the choice, he is at&nbsp;any rate disinclined to attempt reaching his end by any&nbsp;thing like pure conviction. Some of the instruments of&nbsp;the ludicrous, too, are apt to fail in their purpose with many&nbsp;people, from being misunderstood ; and against irony in particular, the sharpest of all the weapons of wit, dulness of&nbsp;heart or fancy cases very many in armour of proof. This&nbsp;truth has been remarkably experienced by Swift, who is&nbsp;perhaps the greatest master of irony in any language, but&nbsp;whose polemical dissertations, often clothed in an ironical&nbsp;dress from beginning to end, are thus, in many cases, as&nbsp;little appreciable by a large majority of his readers as if&nbsp;they had been written in an unknown language. As instances of this fault, we may cite two of his most severe satires ; the one his “ Argument against abolishing Christianity,” aimed both at the irreligion and the false religion of&nbsp;the times ; and the other, still more celebrated, the “ Modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people in&nbsp;Ireland from being a burden to their parents or country,&nbsp;and for making them beneficial to the public,” being the&nbsp;bitterest of all sarcastic invectives against the misgovernment of that unhappy island, whose miseries Swift professes&nbsp;to see no possible means of alleviating, except by devoting&nbsp;the superabundant population to the shambles. The only&nbsp;other questions connected with the inquiry which we shall&nbsp;allude to, are those which address themselves to the case</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
