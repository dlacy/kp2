in muſic, is when one of the parts dwells on a note, while another part makes two or more lesser notes equivalent to it, by conjoint degrees.</p><p>Suppoſition is defined by a late author the uſing of two ſuccessive notes, of the ſame value as to time ; the one whereof, being a diſcord, ſuppoſes the other a concord.</p><p>The harmony, Mr Malcolm obſerves, is always to be full on the accented parts of the bar or meaſure ; but, on the unaccented, diſcords may tranſiently paſs, without any offence to the ear. This tranſient uſe of diſcords, followed by concords, make what we, after the French, call su <hi rend="italic">pposition.</hi></p><p>Concords by ſuppoſition are thoſe where the continued baſs adds or ſuppoſes a new sound below the fundamental baſs ; whence ſuch concords always exceed the extent of the octave. Of theſe concords there are three sorts, all which are concords of the ſeventh : the firſt, when the added sound is a third below the fundamental found ; ſuch is the concord of the ninth : and if the concord of the ninth is formed by the mediant, added below the ſenſible concord in the minor mode, then the concord is called the s <hi rend="italic">upefluous fifth.</hi> The ſecond kind is, when the ſuppoſed found is a fifth below the fundamental sound, as in the concord of the fourth or eleventh ; and if the concord is ſenſible, and the tonic be ſuppoſed, this concord is called the su <hi rend="italic">pefluous ſeventh.</hi> The third kind is that where the ſuppoſed sound is below a concord of the diminiſhed ſeventh : if it is a fifth below, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> if the ſuppoſed sound be the mediant, the concord is called the concord of the <hi rend="italic">fourth</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ſuperfluous fifth :</hi> if it is a ſeventh below, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> if the ſuppoſed sound be the tonic, the concord is called the less <hi rend="italic">er sixth</hi> and su <hi rend="italic">perfluous seventh.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
