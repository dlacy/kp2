                <p><label>SANDOWAY</label>, a town and district in the Arakan division of Lower
                    Burma. The town (pop. 1901, 12,845) is very ancient, and is said to have been at
                    one time the capital of Arakan. The district has an area of 3784 sq. m.; pop.
                    (1901) 90,927, showing an increase of 16% in the decade. The country is
                    mountainous, the Arakan range sending out spurs which reach the coast. Some of
                    the peaks in the N. attain 400o and more ft. The streams are only mountain
                    torrents to within a few miles of the coast; the mouth of the Khwa forms a good
                    anchorage for vessels of from 9 to 10 ft. draught. The rocks in the Arakan range
                    and its spurs are metamorphic, and comprise clay, slates, ironstone and
                    indurated sandstone; towards the S., ironstone, trap and rocks of basaltic
                    character are common; veins of steatite and white fibrous quartz are also found.
                    The rainfall in 1905 was 230âˆ™49 in. Except a few acres of tobacco, all the
                    cultivation is rice. Sandoway was ceded to the British, with the rest of Arakan,
                    by the treaty of Yandabo in 1826.</p>
