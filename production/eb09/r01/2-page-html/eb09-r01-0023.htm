<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">into relations with the democratic leaders. It was in fact at this time the mainstay of the house of Hapsburg, while&nbsp;everything around the central government tottered; and,&nbsp;when the restoration of authority began, and the young&nbsp;emperor Francis Joseph ascended the throne that had been&nbsp;vacated by his imbecile predecessor, Radetzky gave to&nbsp;the new monarch the prestige of a crushing victory over&nbsp;his Italian enemies. The armistice was denounced by&nbsp;Charles Albert on the 12th of March 1819. On the 20th&nbsp;Radetzky crossed the Ticino at Pavia, and on the 23d he&nbsp;annihilated the Italian army at Novara. Peace followed&nbsp;this brief and decisive campaign, and for the next eight&nbsp;years Radetzky governed upper Italy. He retired from&nbsp;service in 1857, and died at the age of ninety-two in the&nbsp;following year. Radetzky was idolized by the Austrian&nbsp;army, but his reputation as a general has not survived him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RADHANPUR, a petty state of India, within the group of states under the supervision of the political superintendent of Palanpur; it is situated in the north-western corner&nbsp;of Gujarat, close to the Runn of Cutch, Bombay presidency,&nbsp;and lies between 23° 26' and 23° 58' N. lat. and between&nbsp;71° 28' and 72° 3' E. long. The country is an open plain&nbsp;without hills and with few trees, square in shape, and about&nbsp;35 miles across. Including the pergunnahs of Munjpur and&nbsp;Sami, it contains an area of 1150 square miles with a population (1881) of 98,129 (males 50,903, females 47,226),&nbsp;the majority being Hindus. Though subject to very great&nbsp;extremes of heat and cold, the climate is healthy. The&nbsp;estimated yearly revenue of the state is from £50,000 to&nbsp;£60,000. Its chief products are cotton, wheat, and all the&nbsp;common varieties of grain; the only manufacture of any&nbsp;importance is the preparation of a fine description of saltpetre. Radhanpur came under British protection in 1819,&nbsp;when the nawab applied for aid to check the raids of marauders. No tribute is exacted and its domestic relations&nbsp;are left entirely free.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Radhanpur, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">chief town of the state and the seat of the nawab, had a population of 14,722 in 1881. The nearest&nbsp;railway station is at Kharagoda, 40 miles distant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIATA. This term was introduced by Cuvier in 1812 to denote the lowest of his four great animal groups&nbsp;or “ embranchements.” He defined them as possessing&nbsp;radial instead of bilateral symmetry, and as apparently&nbsp;destitute of nervous system and sense organs, as having the&nbsp;circulatory system rudimentary or absent, and the respiratory organs on or coextensive with the surface of the&nbsp;body; he included under this title and definition five&nbsp;classes,—Echinodermata, Acalepha, Entozoa, Polypi, and&nbsp;Infusoria. Lamarck </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Hist. not. d. Anim. s. Vertebres</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">)&nbsp;also used the term, as when he spoke of the Medusae as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">radiata medusaria et anomala;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> but he preferred the&nbsp;term Radiaria, under which he included Echinodermata&nbsp;and Medusae. Cuvier’s term in its wide extension, however, passed into general use; but, as the anatomy of the&nbsp;different forms became more fully known, the difficulty of&nbsp;including them under the common designation made itself&nbsp;increasingly obvious. Milne-Edwards removed the Poly-zoa; the group was soon further thinned by the exclusion of the Protozoa on the one hand and the Entozoa&nbsp;on the other; while in 1848 Leuckart and Frey clearly&nbsp;distinguished the Ccelenterata from the Echinodermata as&nbsp;a separate sub-kingdom, thus condemning the usage by&nbsp;which the term still continued to be applied to these two&nbsp;groups at least. In 1855, however, Owen included under&nbsp;Lamarck’s term Radiaria the Echinodermata, Anthozoa,&nbsp;Acalepha, and Hydrozoa, while Agassiz also clung to the&nbsp;term Radiata as including Echinoder-mata, Acalepha, and&nbsp;Polypi, regarding their separation into Ccelenterata and&nbsp;Echinodermata as “an exaggeration of their anatomical&nbsp;differences” (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on Classification</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">, London, 1859).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">These attempts, however, to perpetuate the usage were finally discredited by Huxley’s important </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on Comparative Anatomy</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1864), in which the term was finally&nbsp;abolished, and the “radiate mob ” finally distributed among&nbsp;the Echinodermata, Polyzoa, Vermes (Platyhelminthes),&nbsp;Ccelenterata, and Protozoa. On radiate symmetry, see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Morphology. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Compare also </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Cuvier, Animal Kingdom,&nbsp;Echinodermata, Corals, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RADIATION </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">CONVECTION. 1. When a red-hot cannon ball is taken out of a furnace and suspended in the air it is observed to cool, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> to part with heat, and it&nbsp;continues to do so at a gradually diminishing rate till it&nbsp;finally reaches the temperature of the room. But the process by which this effect is produced is a very complex&nbsp;one. If the hand be held at a distance of a few inches&nbsp;from the hot ball on either side of it or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">below</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> it, the feeling&nbsp;of warmth experienced is considerable; but it becomes&nbsp;intolerable when the hand is held at the same distance&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">abeyve</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the ball. Even this rude form of experiment is&nbsp;sufficient to show that two processes of cooling are simultaneously at work,—one which apparently leads to the loss&nbsp;of heat in all directions indifferently, another which leads&nbsp;to a special loss in a vertical direction upwards. If the experiment is made in a dark room, into which a ray of sunlight is admitted so as to throw a shadow of the ball on a&nbsp;screen, we see that the column of air above the ball also&nbsp;casts a distinct shadow. It is, in fact, a column of air very&nbsp;irregularly heated by contact with the ball, and rising, in&nbsp;obedience to hydrostatic laws, in the colder and denser air&nbsp;around it. This conveyance of heat by the motion of&nbsp;the heated body itself is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">convection;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the process by&nbsp;which heat is lost indifferently in all directions is called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">radiation.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> These two processes are entirely different in&nbsp;their nature, laws, and mechanism ; but we have to treat&nbsp;of both in the present article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To illustrate how the third method by which heat can&nbsp;be transferred, viz., </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conduction</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Heat, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xi. p. 577),&nbsp;is involved in this process, let the cannon ball (which for&nbsp;this purpose should be a large one) be again heated and at&nbsp;once immersed in water until it just ceases to be luminous&nbsp;in the dark, and then be immediately hung up in the air.&nbsp;After a short period it again becomes red-hot all over, and&nbsp;the phenomenon then proceeds precisely as before, except&nbsp;that the surface of the ball does not become so hot as it&nbsp;was before being plunged in the water. This form of&nbsp;experiment, which requires that the interior shall be very&nbsp;considerably cooled before the surface ceases to be self-luminous, does not succeed nearly so well with a copper&nbsp;ball as with an iron one, on account of the comparatively&nbsp;high conductivity of copper. In fact, even when its surface&nbsp;is covered with lamp-black, to make the loss by radiation as great as possible, the difference of temperature&nbsp;between the centre and the surface of a very hot copper&nbsp;ball—which is only an inch or two in diameter—is inconsiderable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conduction there is passage of heat from hotter to&nbsp;colder parts of the same body; in convection an irregularly&nbsp;heated fluid becomes hydrostatically unstable, and each&nbsp;part carries its heat with it to its new position. In both&nbsp;processes heat is conveyed from place to place. But it is&nbsp;quite otherwise with radiation. That a body cools in consequence of radiation is certain; that other bodies which&nbsp;absorb the radiation are thereby heated is also certain;&nbsp;but it does not at all follow that what passes in the radiant&nbsp;form is heat. To return for a moment to the red-hot&nbsp;cannon ball. If, while the hand is held below it, a thick&nbsp;but dry ])late of rock-salt is interposed between the ball&nbsp;and the hand there is no perceptible diminution of warmth,&nbsp;and the temperature of the salt is not perceptibly raised&nbsp;by the radiation which passes through it.
