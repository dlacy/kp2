<p><span class="font2">RABIRIUS (C.) a Roman knight, who lent an im-menfe ſum of money to Ptolemy Auletes king of Egypt. The monarch afterwards not only refuſed to repay him,&nbsp;but even confined him, and endangered his life. Rabi-rius eſcaped from Egypt with difficulty ; but at his re-turn to Rome he was accuſed by the ſenate of having&nbsp;lent money to an African prince for unlawful purpoſes.&nbsp;He was ably defended by Cicero, and acquitted with&nbsp;difficulty.—There was a Latin poet of the ſame name&nbsp;in the age of Auguſtus. He wrote a poem on the&nbsp;victory which the emperor had gained over Antony at&nbsp;Actium. Seneca has compared him to virgil for ele-gance and majeſty ; but Quintilian is not fo favourable&nbsp;to his poetry. —And there was an architect in the reign&nbsp;of Domitian, called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rabirius.</span><span class="font2"> He built a celebrated&nbsp;palace for the emperor, of which the ruins are ſtill feen&nbsp;at Rome.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RACE, in general, ſignifies running with others in order to obtain a prize, either on foot, or by riding on&nbsp;horſeback, in chariots, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The race was one of the exerciſes among the an-cient Grecian games, which was performed in a courſe containing 125 paces; and thofe who cβntended in thefe&nbsp;foot-races were frequently clothed in armour. Chariot&nbsp;and horſe races alſo made a part of thefe ancient games.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Races were known in England in very early times. Fitz-Stephen, who wrote in the days of Henry IT.&nbsp;mentions the great delight that the citizens of London&nbsp;took in the diverfioι‰ But by his words, it appears&nbsp;not to have been deſigned for the purpoſes of gaming,&nbsp;but merely to have ſprung from a generous emulation&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">ſhowing a fuperior ſkill in horſemanſhip.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Races appear to have been in vogue in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and to have been carried to ſuch exceſs as to injure the fortunes of the nobility. The fa-mous George earl of Cumberland is recorded to have&nbsp;wafted more of his eſtate than any of his anceſtors ;&nbsp;and chiefly by his extreme love to horſe-races, tiltings,&nbsp;and other expenſive diverfions. It is probable that the&nbsp;parſimonious queen did not approve of it ; for races are&nbsp;not among the diverfions exhibited at Kennelworth by&nbsp;her favourite Leiceſter. In the following reign, were&nbsp;places allotted for the ſport: Croydon in the fouth, and&nbsp;Garterly in Yorkſhire, were celebrated courſes. Cam-den alſo fays, that in 1607 there were races near York,&nbsp;and the prize was a little golden bell. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Racing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RACINE (John), of the. French academy, trea-ſurer of France in the generality of Moulins, and fecretary to his majeſty, was born at Ferre-Milon in 1639. He had a fine genius for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Belles Lettres,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;became one of the firſt poets of the age. He produced&nbsp;his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Thebαide</span><span class="font2"> when but very young ; and afterwards&nbsp;other pieces, which met with great ſucceſs, though&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">they appeared when Corneille was in his higheſt repu</span><span class="font2">tation. In his career, however, he did not fail </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to meet&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">with all that oppoſition which envy and cabal are ever&nbsp;ready to ſet up againſt a ſuperior genius. It was partly owing to a chagrin from this circumſtance that he&nbsp;took a refolution to quit the theatre for ever ; although&nbsp;his genius was ſtill in full vigour, being not more than&nbsp;38 years of age. But he had alſo imbibed in his in-fancy a deep ſenſe of religion ; and this, though it had&nbsp;been ſmothered for a while by his connections with the&nbsp;theatre, and particularly with the famous actreſs Champ-melle, whom he greatly loved, and by whom he had </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">ſon, now at length broke out, and bore down all before it. In the ſirſt place, he reſolved not only to write&nbsp;no more plays, but to do a rigorous penance for thoſe&nbsp;he had written ; and he actually formed a deſign of be-coming a Carthuſian friar. His religious director, however, a good deal wiſer than he, adviſed him to think-more moderately, and to take meaſures more fuita⅛Ie&nbsp;to his character. He put him upon marrying, and-ſettling in the world : with which propoſal this humble&nbsp;and tractable penitent complied ; and immediately took&nbsp;to wife the daughter of a treaſurer of France for&nbsp;Amiens, by whom he had ſeven children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He had been admitted a member of the French academy in 1673, *<sup>n</sup> the <sup>room θ</sup>f La Mothe le vayer&nbsp;deceaſed ; but ſpoiled the ſpeech he had made upon&nbsp;that occaſion by pronouncing it with too much timidity.&nbsp;In 1677, he was nominated with Boileau, with whom&nbsp;he was ever in ſtrict friendſhip, to write the hiſtory of&nbsp;Louis XIV. ; and the public expected great things&nbsp;from two writers of their diſtinction, but were difappointed. Boileau and Racine, after having for ſome&nbsp;time laboured at this work, perceived that it was en*&nbsp;tirely oppoſite to their genius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He ſpent the latter years of his life in compoſing </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">hiſtory of the houſe of Port-Royal, the place of his&nbsp;education ; which, however, though finely drawn up,&nbsp;as many have aſſerted, has not bcen publiſhed. Too&nbsp;great ſenfibility, ſay his friends, but more properly an&nbsp;impotence of ſpirit, ſhortened the days of this poet.—-Though he had converſed much with the court, he had&nbsp;not learned the wiſdom, which is uſually learned there,&nbsp;cf diſguifing his real fentiments. Having drawn up </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">well-reafoned and well-written memorial upon the mife-ries of the people, and the means of relieving them, he&nbsp;one day lent it to Madam de Maintenon to read ; when&nbsp;the king coming in, and demanding what and whoſe it&nbsp;was, commended the zeal of Racine, but diſapproved&nbsp;of his meddling with things that did not . concern him :&nbsp;and faid with an angry tone, &quot; Becauſe he knows how&nbsp;to make .good verſes, does he think he knows every&nbsp;thing? And would he be a miniſter of ſtate, becauſe&nbsp;he is a great poct ?” Theſe words hurt Racine greatly : he conceived dreadful ideas of the king’s diſpleaſure ; and his chagrin and fears brought on a fever, of&nbsp;which he died the 2 2d of April 1699.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thc king, who was ſenſible of his great merit, and always loved him, ſent often to him in his illneſs ; and&nbsp;finding after his death that he had more glory than&nbsp;riches, ſettled a handſome penſion upon his family.—&nbsp;There is nothing in the French language written with .&nbsp;more wit and elegance than his pieces in proſe. Be-ſides his plays, ſeveral of his letters have been publiſhed-;&nbsp;he alſo wrote ſpiritual ſongs, epigrams, &amp;c. Racine’s</span></p>
