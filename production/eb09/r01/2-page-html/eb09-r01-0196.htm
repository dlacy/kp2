<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and Boccaccio, though they both held the mediaeval doctrine that literature should teach some abstruse truth beneath&nbsp;a veil of fiction, differed from Dante ·in this that their&nbsp;poetry and prose in the vernacular abandoned both allegory and symbol. In their practice they ignored their&nbsp;theory. Petrarch’s lyrics continue the Provençal tradition&nbsp;as it had been reformed in Tuscany, with a subtler and&nbsp;more modern analysis of emotion, a purer and more&nbsp;chastened style, than his masters could boast. Boccaccio’s&nbsp;tales, in like manner, continue the tradition of the fabliaux,&nbsp;raising that literary species to the rank of finished art,&nbsp;enriching it with humour, and strengthening its substance&nbsp;by keen insight into all varieties of character. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Canzoniere</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Decameron</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> distinguish themselves&nbsp;from mediaeval literature, not by any return to classical&nbsp;precedents, but by free self-conscious handling of human&nbsp;nature. So much had to be premised in order to make&nbsp;it clear in what relation humanism stood to the Renaissance, since the Italian work of Dante, Petrarch, and&nbsp;Boccaccio is sufficient to indicate the re-birth of the spirit&nbsp;after ages of apparent deadness. Had the Revival of&nbsp;Learning not intervened it is probable that the vigorous&nbsp;efforts of these writers alone would have inaugurated a new&nbsp;age of European culture. Yet, while noting this reservation of judgment, it must also be remarked that all three&nbsp;felt themselves under some peculiar obligation to the&nbsp;classics. Dante, mediaeval as his temper seems to us, chose&nbsp;Virgil for his guide, and ascribed his mastery of style to&nbsp;the study of Virgilian poetry. Petrarch and Boccaccio were,&nbsp;as we have seen, the pioneers of the new learning. They&nbsp;held their writings in the vernacular cheap, and initiated&nbsp;that contempt for the mother tongue which was a note of&nbsp;the earlier Renaissance. It may further be observed that&nbsp;Giovanni Villani, the first chronicler who used Italian for&nbsp;the compilation of a methodical history, tells us how he&nbsp;was impelled to write by musing on the ruins of Rome&nbsp;and thinking of the vanished greatness of the Latin race.&nbsp;We have therefore to recognize this fact that the four&nbsp;greatest writers of the 14th century, while the Revival&nbsp;of Learning was yet in its cradle, each after his own&nbsp;fashion acknowledged the vivifying touch upon their spirit&nbsp;of the antique genius. They seem to have been conscious&nbsp;that they could not give the desired impulse to modern&nbsp;literature and art without contact with the classics; and,&nbsp;in spite of the splendour of their achievements in Italian,&nbsp;they found no immediate followers upon that path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">! The fascination of pure study was so powerful, the Italians at that epoch were so eager to recover the past,&nbsp;’that during the 15th century we have before our eyes&nbsp;! the spectacle of this great nation deviating from the course&nbsp;of development begun in poetry by Dante and Petrarch, in&nbsp;prose by Boccaccio and Villani, into the channels of scholarship and antiquarian research. The language of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Canzoniere</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Decameron</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> was abandoned for revived Latin&nbsp;and discovered Greek. Acquisition supplanted invention ;&nbsp;imitation of classical authors suppressed originality of&nbsp;style. The energies of the Italian people were devoted to&nbsp;transcribing codices, settling texts, translating Greek&nbsp;books into Latin, compiling grammars, commentaries,&nbsp;encyclopædias, dictionaries, epitomes, and epliemerides.&nbsp;During this century the best histories—Bruno’s and&nbsp;Poggio’s annals of Florence, for example—were composed&nbsp;in Latin after the manner of Livy. The best dissertations,&nbsp;Landino’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Camaldunenses,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Valla’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Voluptate,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> were&nbsp;laboured imitations of Cicero’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tusculans.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> The best verses,&nbsp;Pontano’s elegies, Politian’s hexameters, were in like manner&nbsp;Latin ; public orations upon ceremonial occasions were&nbsp;delivered in the Latin tongue ; correspondence, official and&nbsp;familiar, was carried on in the same language ; even the&nbsp;fabliaux received, in Poggio’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Facetiae</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">, a dress of elegant</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Latinity. The noticeable barrenness of Italian literature at this period is referable to the fact that men of genius&nbsp;and talent devoted themselves to erudition and struggled&nbsp;to express their thoughts and feelings in a speech which&nbsp;was not natural. Yet they were engaged in a work of&nbsp;incalculable importance. At the close of the century the&nbsp;knowledge of Greece and Rome had been reappropriated and placed beyond the possibility of destruction;&nbsp;the chasm between the old and new world had been&nbsp;bridged; mediaeval modes of thinking and discussing had&nbsp;been superseded; the staple of education, the common&nbsp;culture which has brought all Europe into intellectual&nbsp;agreement, was already in existence. Humanism was&nbsp;now an actuality. Owing to the uncritical veneration for&nbsp;antiquity which then prevailed, it had received a strong&nbsp;tincture of pedantry. Its professors, in their revolt against&nbsp;the Middle Ages, made light of Christianity and paraded&nbsp;paganism. What was even worse from an artistic point of&nbsp;view, they had contracted puerilities of style, vanities of&nbsp;rhetoric, stupidities of wearisome citation. Still, at the&nbsp;opening of the 16th century, it became manifest what&nbsp;fruits of noble quality the Revival of Letters was about to&nbsp;bring forth for modern literature. Two great scholars,&nbsp;Lorenzo de’ Medici and Politian, had already returned to&nbsp;the practice of Italian poetry. Their work is the first&nbsp;absolutely modern work,—modern in the sense of having&nbsp;absorbed the stores of classic learning and reproduced those&nbsp;treasures in forms of simple, natural, native beauty.&nbsp;Boiardo occupies a similar position by the fusion of classic&nbsp;mythology with chivalrous romance in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orlando&nbsp;Innamorato.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> But the victor’s laurels were reserved for&nbsp;Ariosto, whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orlando Furioso</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> is the purest and most&nbsp;perfect extant example of Renaissance poetry. It was not&nbsp;merely in what they had acquired and assimilated from the&nbsp;classics that these poets showed the transformation effected&nbsp;in the field of literature by humanism. The whole method&nbsp;and spirit of mediaeval art had been abandoned. That of&nbsp;the Cinque Cento is positive, defined, mundane. The&nbsp;deity, if deity there be, that rules in it, is beauty.&nbsp;Interest is confined to the actions, passions, sufferings, and&nbsp;joys of human life, to its pathetic, tragic, humorous, and&nbsp;sentimental incidents. Of the state of souls beyond the&nbsp;grave we hear and are supposed to care nothing. In the&nbsp;drama the pedantry of the Revival, which had not injured&nbsp;romantic literature, made itself perniciously felt. Rules&nbsp;were collected from Horace and Aristotle. Seneca was&nbsp;chosen as the model of tragedy; Plautus and Terence&nbsp;supplied the groundwork of comedy. Thus in the plays&nbsp;of Rucellai, Trissino, Sperone, and other tragic poets, the&nbsp;nobler elements of humanism, considered as a revelation of&nbsp;the world and man, obtained no free development. Even&nbsp;the comedies of the best authors are too observant of Latin&nbsp;precedents, although some pieces of Macliiavelli, Ariosto,&nbsp;Aretino, Cecclii, and Gelli are admirable for vivid delineation of contemporary manners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The relation of the plastic arts to the revival of learning is similar to that which has been sketched in the case of&nbsp;poetry. Cimabue started with work which owed nothing&nbsp;directly to antiquity. At about the same time Niccola&nbsp;Pisano studied the style of sculpture in fragments of Graeco-Roman marbles. His manner influenced Giotto, who set&nbsp;painting on a forward path. Fortunately for the unimpeded expansion of Italian art, little was brought to&nbsp;light of antique workmanship during the 14th and&nbsp;15th centuries. The classical stimulus came to painters,&nbsp;sculptors, and architects chiefly through literature. Therefore there was narrow scope for imitation, and the right&nbsp;spirit of humanism displayed itself in a passionate study&nbsp;of perspective, nature, and the nude. Yet we find in the&nbsp;writings of Ghiberti and Alberti, we notice in the master</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
