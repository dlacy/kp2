<p><span class="font1">was attained. It is doubtful whether during the regal period a testamentary appointment of tutors by a husband&nbsp;or parent to wife or children was known in practice,—&nbsp;probably not. If so the office devolved upon the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> to&nbsp;which the deceased </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> belonged ; and it may&nbsp;reasonably be assumed that it delegated the duties to one&nbsp;of its members in particular, retaining in its collective&nbsp;capacity a right of supervision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Quiritiaη Law of Property.—</span><span class="font1">The distribution of land amongst the early Romans is one of the puzzling&nbsp;problems of their history. The Servian constitution classified the citizens and determined their privileges, duties,&nbsp;and burdens according to the extent of their freeholds;&nbsp;and yet we know very little with certainty of the way in&nbsp;which these were acquired.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> We have indeed a traditional&nbsp;account of a partition by Romulus of the little territory&nbsp;of his original settlement into three parts, not necessarily&nbsp;of equal dimensions, one of which was intended for the&nbsp;maintenance of the state and its institutions, civil and&nbsp;religious, the second </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ager publicus)</span><span class="font1"> for the use of the&nbsp;citizens and profit of the state, and the third </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ager prrvvatus)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">for subdivision among his followers. Varro and Pliny&nbsp;further relate that to each of them he assigned a homestead </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(heredium)</span><span class="font1"> of two jugers, equal to about an acre&nbsp;and a quarter, to be held by him and his heirs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(quae here-dem sequerentur),—</span><span class="font1">Pliny adding that to none did the king&nbsp;give more. There can be no doubt that a portion of the&nbsp;territory, gradually augmented through new conquests, was&nbsp;reserved as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ager publicus</span><span class="font1"> ; that is sufficiently attested by&nbsp;the complaints made for centuries by the plebeians of its&nbsp;monopolization by the patricians. But it is impossible to&nbsp;admit the accuracy of the account of the mode in which&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ager privatus</span><span class="font1"> was dealt with. The fact that the&nbsp;majority of the Servian local tribes bore the names of&nbsp;well-known patrician </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font1"> leads to the conclusion that&nbsp;many at least of the clans held tracts of land in their&nbsp;corporate capacity, and that their constituent families&nbsp;settled alongside each other, each with its own homestead&nbsp;in separate and independent right. It can hardly be&nbsp;assumed, however, that two and a half jugers was its&nbsp;maximum. Seven jugers, about 4∣ acres, seems to have&nbsp;been the normal extent of royal grants to plebeians, and&nbsp;a patrician’s freehold is not likely to have been less ;&nbsp;probably in the ordinary case it was larger, seeing the&nbsp;minimum qualification for the third Servian class was ten&nbsp;jugers, and for the first twenty.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> To enable him to make&nbsp;grants during pleasure to his clients he must have held&nbsp;more than seven. But he did not necessarily hold all his&nbsp;lands by gratuitous assignation either from the state or&nbsp;from his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> ; purchase from the former was by no means&nbsp;uncommon ; and it may have been on his purchased lands,&nbsp;outside his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heredium</span><span class="font1"> proper, that his clients were usually&nbsp;employed. Those dependants were also employed in large&nbsp;numbers upon those parts of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ager publicus</span><span class="font1"> which were&nbsp;occupied by the patricians under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">possessioηes,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and which really were the source of their wealth. These,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">however, were not the property of their occupant ; it was the lands acquired by assignation or purchase that were&nbsp;alone regarded as his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex jure Qrnmtium,—</span><span class="font1">what he held in&nbsp;independent ownership to him and his heirs according to&nbsp;the law and custom of the Quirites.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are some who maintain that in the regal period, anterior to the reign of Servius Tullius, there was no private property in movables. The proposition thus broadly&nbsp;stated is manifestly untenable. If no more be meant by&nbsp;it than this, that movables were not then recognized as&nbsp;objects of quiritarian right that could be vindicated as&nbsp;such by a real action </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per sacramentum,</span><span class="font1"> it may be admitted that down to the time of Servius, with exception&nbsp;perhaps of captured slaves and cattle, there was no property in movables. But, if it be meant to negative the&nbsp;right of a man to alienate by tradition what he held as&nbsp;his own, and to protect himself, or have protection from&nbsp;the authorities, against any attempt to deprive him of it&nbsp;by theft or violence, then the non-existence of ownership&nbsp;of movables must be emphatically denied. Theft was&nbsp;theft, though the stolen article had been acquired only by&nbsp;natural means,—by barter in the market, by the industry&nbsp;of the maker, or as the product of something already belonging to its holder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Quiritiaη Law of Succession.—</span><span class="font1">The legal order of succession in the regal period was extremely simple. It&nbsp;was this : on the death of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> his patrimony&nbsp;devolved upon those of his children </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font1"> who by&nbsp;that event became </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris,</span><span class="font1"> his widow taking an equal&nbsp;share with them, and no distinction being made between&nbsp;movables and immovables, personalty and realty; and,&nbsp;failing widow and children, it went to his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;notion that between the descendants and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> came&nbsp;an intermediate class under the name of agnates does not&nbsp;seem well founded as regards the regal period ; they were&nbsp;introduced by the XII. Tables to meet the case of the&nbsp;plebeians, who, having no </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes,</span><span class="font1"> were without legal heirs&nbsp;in default of children.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The later jurists more than once refer to the perfect equality of the sexes in the matter of succession in the ancient law.@@<sup>4</sup> But it&nbsp;was more nominal than real. A daughter who had passed into the&nbsp;hand of a husband during her father’s lifetime of course could have&nbsp;no share in the latter’s inheritance, for she had ceased to be a&nbsp;member of his family. One who was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font0"> at his death, and&nbsp;thereby became </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris,</span><span class="font0"> did become his heir, unless he had prevented such a result by testamentary arrangements. But even then&nbsp;it was in the hands of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> to prevent risk of prejudice to&nbsp;themselves : for she could not marry, and so carry her fortune into&nbsp;another family, without their consent as her guardians ; neither&nbsp;could she without their consent alienate any of the more valuable&nbsp;items of it ; nor, even with their consent, could she make a testament&nbsp;disposing of it in prospect of death. Her inheritance, therefore, was&nbsp;hers in name only ; in reality it was in the hands of her guardians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of primogeniture or legal preference of one member of the family over the others there is not the faintest trace. And yet we find&nbsp;record of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heredia</span><span class="font0"> remaining in a family not for generations merely&nbsp;but for centuries,—a state of matters that would have been impossible had every death of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> necessarily involved a&nbsp;splitting up of the family estate. It is conceivable that this was&nbsp;sometimes prevented by arrangement amongst the heirs themselves ;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the same time the writers of the empire frequently refer to&nbsp;the early </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heredium</span><span class="font0"> of seven jugers as having been amply sufficient for&nbsp;its frugal owner, content to till it himself with the aid of his sons.&nbsp;The case of Cincinnatus in the year 293 u.c. is often mentioned :&nbsp;having a freehold of just that extent, he had to sell three jugers&nbsp;to meet engagements for which he believed himself in honour responsible, and yet found the remaining four ample enough to maintain&nbsp;him with all the dignity of a man who had been consul and who became dictator.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is quite true, however, that from the first the order of succession was agnatic ; for it -was those only of a man’s children who&nbsp;were agnate as well as cognate that had any claim to his inheritance ;&nbsp;and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> was, theoretically at least, just a body of agnates. The&nbsp;supposed mention of agnates in a law attributed to Numa rests simply on a conjecture of I. G. Huschke’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Analecta litteraria,</span><span class="font0"> Leipsic,&nbsp;1826, p. 375). The law, which is preserved in narrative by Servius,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">In Virg. Eclog.,vt.</span><span class="font0"> 43, runs thus: “In Numae legibus cautum est,&nbsp;ut si quis imprudens occidisset hominem, pro capite occisi et natis ejus&nbsp;in cautione (Scalig., concione) offerret arietem.” Huschke’s substitution of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">agnatis</span><span class="font0"> for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">et natis</span><span class="font0"> is all but universally adopted ; but, even&nbsp;were it necessary, it need mean nothing more than his children </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;potestate</span><span class="font0"> or his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Voconian law of 585 u.c. avowedly introduced something&nbsp;new in prohibiting a man of fortune from instituting a woman, even his&nbsp;only daughter, as his testamentary heir ; but even it did not touch the&nbsp;law of intestacy.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
