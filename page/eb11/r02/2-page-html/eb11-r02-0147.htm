<p><span class="font1">attaches the two crico-arytenoid muscles and so is known as tbe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">muscular process.</span><span class="font1"> Above each arytenoid are two smaller&nbsp;cartilages known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cornicula laryngis</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cartilages of Santorini</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cuneiform cartilages,</span><span class="font1"> but they are not of any&nbsp;practical importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">epiglottis</span><span class="font1"> (see fig. 3), on the other hand, is a very important structure, since it forms a lid to the larynx in swallowing: only&nbsp;the box moves up to&nbsp;the lid instead of the&nbsp;lid moving down to&nbsp;the box. It is leafshaped, the stalk&nbsp;(thyro-epiglottid e a n&nbsp;ligament) being attached to the junction of the thyroid&nbsp;cartilages inside the&nbsp;larynx, while the&nbsp;anterior surface of&nbsp;the leaf is closely&nbsp;attached to the root&nbsp;of the tongue and&nbsp;body of the hyoid&nbsp;bone. The posterior&nbsp;or laryngeal surface&nbsp;is pitted for glands,&nbsp;and near the point&nbsp;where the stalk joins&nbsp;the leaf is a convexity which is&nbsp;known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cushion of the epiglottis.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">All the cartilages of&nbsp;the larynx are of&nbsp;the hyaline variety&nbsp;except fhe epiglottis, the corni-cula laryngis and&nbsp;the cuneiform cartilages, which are&nbsp;yellow elastic. The&nbsp;result is that all except these three tend to ossify as middle</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">age is approached.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">muscles of the larynx</span><span class="font1"> are: (1) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">crico-thyroids,</span><span class="font1"> which are attached to the lower border of the thyroid and the ^anterior&nbsp;part of the cricoid, by pulling up which they make the upper part&nbsp;of the signet, with the arytenoids attached to it, move back&nbsp;and so tighten the vocal cords. (2) The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">thyro-arytenoids</span><span class="font1"> (see&nbsp;fig. 4), which run back from the* junction of thé thyroid alae to&nbsp;the front of the arytenoids and side of the epiglottis; they pull&nbsp;the arytenoids toward the thyroid and so relax the cords.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arytenoideus</span><span class="font1"> muscle, which runs from the back of&nbsp;one arytenoid to the other and approximates these cartilages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lateral crico-arytenoids</span><span class="font1"> (see fig. 4) which draw the muscular&nbsp;processes of the arytenoids forward toward the ring of the&nbsp;cricoid and, by so doing, twist the vocal processes, with the&nbsp;cords attached, inward toward one another; and (5) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">posterior&nbsp;crico-arytenoids</span><span class="font1"> (see fig. 4) which run from the back of the signet&nbsp;part of the cricoid to the back of the muscular processes of the&nbsp;arytenoid and, by pulling these backward, twist the vocal&nbsp;processes outward and so separate the vocal cords. All these&nbsp;muscles are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve, except&nbsp;the crico-thyroid which is innervated by the external branch&nbsp;of the superior laryngeal (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nerves, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cranial).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mucous membrane of the larynx</span><span class="font1"> is continuous with that of the pharynx at the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">aryteno-epiglottidean folds</span><span class="font1"> which run from the&nbsp;sides of the epiglottis to the top of the arytenoid cartilages (see&nbsp;(fig· 3)· To the outer side of each fold is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sinus pyriformis&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pharynx).</span><span class="font1"> From the middle of the junction of the alae&nbsp;of the thyroid cartilage to the vocal processes of the arytenoids&nbsp;the mucous membrane is reflected over, and closely bound to,&nbsp;the true vocal cords which contain elastic tissue and, as has&nbsp;been mentioned, are the upper free edges of thc lateral parts&nbsp;of the crico-thyroid membrane. The chink between the two&nbsp;true vocal cords is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">glottis</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rima gloîtiais.</span><span class="font1"> Just above the&nbsp;true vocal cords is the opening into a recess on each side which&nbsp;runs upward and backward and is known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">laryngeal&nbsp;saccule;</span><span class="font1"> its opening is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">laryngeal sinus.</span><span class="font1"> The upper lip of&nbsp;this slit-like opening is called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">false vocal cord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The mucous membrane is closely bound down to the epiglottis and to the true vocal cords, elsewhere there is plenty of submucous tissue in which the products of inflammation may&nbsp;collect and cause “ oedema laryngis,” a condition which is&nbsp;mechanically prevented from passing the true vocal cords. In&nbsp;tbe upper part of the front and sides of the larynx and over the&nbsp;true vocal cords the mucous membrane is lined by squamous&nbsp;epithelium, but elsewhere the epithelium is of the columnar&nbsp;ciliated variety: it is supplied by the superior laryngeal branch&nbsp;of the vagus nerve and above the glottis is peculiarly sensitive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trachea</span><span class="font1"> or windpipe (see fig. 5) is the tube which carries the air between the larynx and the bronchi; it is from four to&nbsp;four and a half inches long and lies partly in the neck and partly&nbsp;in the thorax. It begins where the larynx ends at the lower&nbsp;border of the sixth cervical, and divides into its two bronchi&nbsp;opposite the fifth thoracic vertebra. The tube is kept always&nbsp;open by rings of cartilage, which, however, are wanting behind,&nbsp;and, as it passes down, it comes to lie farther and farther from&nbsp;the ventral surface of the body, following the concavity of the&nbsp;thoracic region of the spinal column. In the whole of its&nbsp;downward course it has the oesophagus close behind it, while in&nbsp;front are the isthmus of the thyroid, the left innominate vein,&nbsp;the innominate artery and the arch of the aorta. On each side&nbsp;of it and touching it is the vagus nerve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cervical part of the tube is not much more than an inch in length, but it can be lengthened by throwing back the head.&nbsp;This, of course, is the region in which tracheotomy is performed,&nbsp;and it should be remembered that in children, and sometimes&nbsp;in adults, the great left innominate vein lies above the level of&nbsp;the top of the sternum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In transverse section the trachea is rather wider from side to side than from before backward. In life the former measurement is said to be about 12-5 mm. and the latter n mm. It&nbsp;is made up of an external fibro-clastic membrane in which the&nbsp;cartilaginous rings lie, while behind, where these rings are&nbsp;wanting, is a layer of unstripcd muscle which, when it contracts,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
