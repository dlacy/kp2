        <p><span class="font0">essential element, and from “ Rout,” which may be described as a
                beginning or endeavour to create a riot. It was considered&nbsp;as early as the 14th
                century that the English common law gave&nbsp;an insufficient remedy against riot.
                In 1360 the statute of&nbsp;34 Edward III. gave jurisdiction to justices to
                restrain, arrest&nbsp;and imprison rioters. In 1393 the statute of 17 Richard
                II.&nbsp;conferred similar powers on the sheriff and </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">posse comitatus.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Numerous
                other acts extending the common law were passed,&nbsp;especially in the Tudor reigns
                (see Stephen, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of
                the&nbsp;Criminal Law,</span><span class="font0"> vol. i. p. 202). Both these acts
                above mentioned&nbsp;are still on the statute book, but the earliest act now in
                force&nbsp;of real importance as to this offence is the Riot Act (1716),&nbsp;which
                creates certain statutory offences for riot attended by&nbsp;circumstances of
                aggravation. That act makes it the duty of&nbsp;a justice, sheriff, mayor or other
                authority, wherever twelve&nbsp;persons or more are unlawfully, riotously and
                tumultuously&nbsp;assembled together, to the disturbance of the public peace,
                to&nbsp;resort to the place of such assembly and read the
                following&nbsp;proclamation: “Our Sovereign Lord the King chargeth
                and&nbsp;commandeth all persons being assembled immediately to disperse themselves,
                and peaceably to depart to their habitations&nbsp;or to their lawful business, upon
                the pains contained in the&nbsp;act made in the first year of King George for
                preventing&nbsp;tumultuous and riotous assemblies. God save the King.”&nbsp;It is a
                felony to obstruct the reading of the proclamation or to&nbsp;remain or continue
                together unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously for one hour after the proclamation
                was made or for one&nbsp;hour after it would have been made but for being
                hindered.&nbsp;The act requires the justices to seize and apprehend all
                persons&nbsp;continuing after the hour, and indemnifies them and those who&nbsp;act
                under their authority from liability for injuries caused&nbsp;thereby. The
                punishment for the felony is penal servitude&nbsp;for life or for a term of not less
                than three years, or imprisonment with or without hard labour for not more than two
                years.&nbsp;Prosecutions for an offence against the act must be
                commenced&nbsp;within twelve months after the offence.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">By s. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >h</span><span class="font0"> of the Malicious Damage Act 1861 (which is a
                reenactment of a similar provision made in 1827 in consequence of the frame-breaking
                riots), it is a felony for persons riotously&nbsp;and tumultuously assembled
                together to the disturbance of&nbsp;the public peace to unlawfully and with force
                demolish or&nbsp;begin to demolish or pull down or destroy any building,
                public&nbsp;building, machinery or mining plant. The punishment is&nbsp;the same as
                for a felony under the Riot Act. By s. 12 it is&nbsp;a misdemeanour to injure or
                damage such building, &amp;c. The&nbsp;punishment is penal servitude from three to
                seven years, or&nbsp;imprisonment as in the case of the two felonies above
                described.&nbsp;Under the Shipping Offences Act (1793) a riotous assemblage&nbsp;of
                three or more seamen, ship’s carpenters and other persons,&nbsp;unlawfully and with
                force preventing and hindering or obstructing the loading or unloading or the
                sailing or navigation of any&nbsp;vessel, or unlawfully and with force boarding any
                vesscl with&nbsp;intent to prevent, &amp;c., is punishable on a first conviction
                as&nbsp;a misdemeanour by imprisonment from six to twelve months,&nbsp;and on a
                second conviction as a felony by penal servitude from&nbsp;three to fourteen years.
                And under the Offences against the&nbsp;Person Act 1861 (s. 40) summary penalties
                are provided for&nbsp;forcible interference with seamen in the exercise of their
                lawful&nbsp;occupation.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Besides these enactments there are others aimed at similar offences,
                such as smuggling, forcible entry and detainer,&nbsp;tumultuous petitioning (1661,
                13 Charles II.), holding large&nbsp;political meetings within a certain distance of
                Westminster&nbsp;Hall during the sitting of parliament (Seditious Meetings
                Act&nbsp;1817). For these offences see Stephen, </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">Dig. Cr. Law,</span><span class="font0"> 6th
                ed.,&nbsp;arts. 81-87..</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">It is the duty of a magistrate at the time of a riot to assemble
                subjects of the realm, whether civil or military, for the purpose&nbsp;of quelling
                the riot. In this duty he Js aided by the common&nbsp;law, and a statute of 1414
                (Henry V.), under which all subjects&nbsp;of the realm are bound to assist on
                reasonable warning, and by&nbsp;various enactments enabling the authorities to call
                out the&nbsp;militia, yeomanry and reserve forces for the suppression of&nbsp;riot,
                and to close public-houses where a riot is apprehended&nbsp;(Licensing Act 1872). It
                is his duty to keep the peace; if&nbsp;the peace be broken, honesty of intention
                will not avail him if&nbsp;he has been guilty of neglect of duty. The question is
                whether&nbsp;he did all that he knew was in his power and which could&nbsp;be
                expected from a man of ordinary prudence, firmness and&nbsp;activity. The law as
                thus stated is gathered from the opinions&nbsp;of the judges on the trials of the
                lord mayor of London and&nbsp;the mayor of Bristol on indictments for neglect of
                duty at the&nbsp;time of the Gordon riots of 1780 and the Bristol riots in
                1831.@@1&nbsp;In addition to his liability to an indictment at common law,&nbsp;a
                defaulting magistrate is subject under the provisions of acts&nbsp;of 1411 (Henry
                IV.) and 1414 (Henry V.) to a penalty of £100&nbsp;for every default, the default to
                be inquired of by commission&nbsp;under the great seal. A matter of interest is the
                extent of the&nbsp;protection afforded by the Riot Act to soldiers acting
                under&nbsp;the commands of their officers. The question was dealt with&nbsp;by Lord
                Bowen and his fellow-commissioners in the report on&nbsp;the Featherstone riots
                (Pari. Paper, 1893-1894, c. 7234). The&nbsp;substance of their views is as
                follows:—</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">By the law of England every one is bound to aid in the suppression of
                riotous assemblages. The degree of force, however, which may be lawfully employed in
                their, suppression&nbsp;depends on the nature of each riot, for the force used
                must&nbsp;always be moderated and proportioned to the circumstances&nbsp;of the case
                and to the end to be attained. The taking of life&nbsp;can only be justified by the
                necessity for protecting persons or&nbsp;property against various forms of violent
                crime, or by the&nbsp;necessity of dispersing a riotous crowd which is
                dangerous&nbsp;unless dispersed, or in the case of persons whose conduct
                has&nbsp;become felonious through disobedience to the provisions of the&nbsp;Riot
                Act, and who resist the attempt to disperse or apprehend&nbsp;them. The necessary
                prevention of such outrage on person or&nbsp;property justifies the guardians of the
                peace in the employment&nbsp;against a crowd of even deadly weapons. Officers and
                soldiers&nbsp;are under no special privileges and subject to no special
                responsibilities as regards the principle of the law. A soldier for&nbsp;the purpose
                of establishing civil order is only a citizen armed&nbsp;in a particular manner. He
                cannot because he is a soldier be&nbsp;exonerated if without necessity he takes
                human life. The duty&nbsp;of magistrates and peace officers to summon or abstain
                from&nbsp;summoning the assistance of the military depends in like manner&nbsp;on
                the necessities of the case. A soldier can act only by using&nbsp;his arms. The
                weapons he carries are deadly. They cannot&nbsp;be employed at all without danger to
                life or limb, and in these&nbsp;days of improved rifles and perfected ammunition
                without&nbsp;some risk of danger to distant and possibly innocent
                bystanders.&nbsp;To call for assistance against rioters from those who can
                interfere&nbsp;only under such grave conditions ought, of course, to be the
                last&nbsp;expedient of the civil authorities. But when the call for help&nbsp;is
                made and a necessity for assistance from the military has&nbsp;arisen, to refuse
                such assistance is in law a misdemeanour.&nbsp;The whole action of the military when
                once called in ought&nbsp;from first to last to be based on the principle of doing,
                and&nbsp;doing without fear, that which is absolutely necessary to
                prevent&nbsp;serious crime, and of exercising care and skill with regard
                to&nbsp;what is done. No set of rules exists which governs every&nbsp;instance or
                defines beforehand any contingency that may arise.&nbsp;The presence of a magistrate
                is not essential, but is usual, and&nbsp;of the highest value to aid the commander
                of the troops by local&nbsp;knowledge. But his presence or absence has no legal
                effect on&nbsp;the duties or responsibilities of the military to use their
                arms&nbsp;when it becomes necessary to do so, and without recklessness&nbsp;or
                negligence and with reasonable care and caution; and where&nbsp;they have so acted
                the killing of a rioter is justifiable homicide,&nbsp;and the killing of an innocent
                bystander is homicide by misadventure. It is not usual to resort to extremities with
                rioters&nbsp;until after reading the proclamation under the Riot Act
            (1716),</span></p>
