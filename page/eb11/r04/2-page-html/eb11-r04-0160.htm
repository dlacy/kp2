<p><span class="font0">was recently published by Professor Camillo Re, who asserted it to be the first and most ancient that Rome had possessed.&nbsp;But the still more recent researches of Messrs La Mantia and&nbsp;Levi prove that Professor Re’s assertions were somewhat too&nbsp;bold. There is certain evidence of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">statutum senatus</span><span class="font0"> existing&nbsp;between 1212 and 1227, of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">statutum vel capitulare senatoris&nbsp;vel senatus</span><span class="font0"> of 1235, followed in 1241 by a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">statutum urbis.</span><span class="font0"> This&nbsp;brings us very near to the statute of 1246 mentioned by Vitale&nbsp;and others. So it is well ascertained that, in the first half&nbsp;of the 13th century, Rome possessed statutes at large composed&nbsp;of older limited statutes. The consuls of the trade gilds were&nbsp;from 1267 regular members of the councils; and the merchants’&nbsp;gild held general meetings in 1255. Its statutes were confirmed&nbsp;in 1296 by the senator Pandolfo Savelli, and the compilation of these, published in 1880 by Signor Gatti, refers to&nbsp;1317-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile the struggle between Frederick II. and the pope was once more renewed. The former sought to dominate&nbsp;Italy, separate the state from the church, and repress&nbsp;the republics. The latter, although really hostile to&nbsp;the Roman free government, joined it against the&nbsp;emperor, who on his side favoured the republic of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rome and the nobles most adverse to the pope. Thus the new nobility, composed, as we have seen, of two different elements,&nbsp;was again split into a Guelph party headed by the Orsini and&nbsp;a Ghibelline party under the Colonna. And in 1238 it was&nbsp;deemed advisable to elect two senators instead of one, in the&nbsp;hope of conciliating both factions by simultaneously raising&nbsp;them to power. Afterwards one only was elected, alternately&nbsp;an Orsini and a Colonna, then again two, and so on. But all&nbsp;these changes failed in their aims, since the struggle between&nbsp;emperor and pope exasperated party feeling in Rome. Frederick was king of southern Italy and emperor; had he been&nbsp;able to enforce the whole of his authority he would have been&nbsp;absolute master of all Italy, a state of things which the popes&nbsp;could not in any way tolerate. Hence the obstinate and uninterrupted struggle which proved injurious both to the papacy&nbsp;and the empire. The political genius of Frederick might&nbsp;have wrought great harm to the city had not his mind teemed&nbsp;with contradictory ideas. Although desirous to emancipate&nbsp;the state from the church, he was opposed to the communal&nbsp;democracy, which was then the chief strength of the secular&nbsp;state in Italy. While combating the church and persecuting&nbsp;her defenders, he yet sent heretics to the stake; although&nbsp;excommunicated, he undertook a crusade; he feasted at his&nbsp;table philosophers, sceptic and atheist poets, bishops and&nbsp;Mussulmans; he proclaimed anti-Christian the possession of&nbsp;wealth by the church, yet made lavish gifts to altar and monastery. Thus, although he had a strong party in Rome, it&nbsp;seemed to dissolve at his approach, inasmuch as all feared that&nbsp;he might abolish the statutes and liberties of the commune.&nbsp;In fact, when he advanced towards Rome on the death of&nbsp;Gregory IX. in 1241 he was energetically repulsed by the&nbsp;people, and later even by Viterbo, a city that had always been&nbsp;faithful to him. But after he had withdrawn, his adherents&nbsp;gained strength and put to flight his opponent, Innocent IV.&nbsp;(1243-54), the newly elected pope, who then from his asylum&nbsp;at Lyons hurled an excommunication against him. Frederick’s&nbsp;death in December 1250 determined the fall of the Ghibelline&nbsp;party and the close of the imperial epoch in Italy. The pope&nbsp;instantly returned to Rome with the set purpose of destroying&nbsp;the power of the Hohenstaufens. This was no longer difficult&nbsp;when, by the decease of Conrad IV. (1254), the child Conradin&nbsp;became the last legitimate representative of that line, and&nbsp;negotiations were already on foot for placing the Angevins on&nbsp;the Neapolitan throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The republic meanwhile preserved its independence against the pope, who, among other concessions, had entirely given up&nbsp;to it the right of coinage. Nevertheless, being much harassed&nbsp;by the factiousness of the nobility, it was obliged in X252 to&nbsp;decide on the election of an alien senator armed wdth ample&nbsp;powers, precisely as other communes gave the government into&nbsp;the hands of a podestà. Accordingly a Bolognese noble,&nbsp;Brancaleone degli Andalò, count of Casalecchio, and&nbsp;a Ghibelline of much energy and talent, was invited&nbsp;to Rome. But before accepting office he insisted on&nbsp;making definite terms. He desired to hold the&nbsp;government for three years; and this, although contrary to the statutes, was granted. Further, to ensure his personal safety, he demanded that many scions&nbsp;of the noblest Roman houses should be sent as hostages to&nbsp;Bologna; and to this also the republic consented. Then, in&nbsp;August 1252, he came with his judges and notaries, made oath&nbsp;to observe justice and the laws, and began to govern. He was&nbsp;head of the republic in peace and in war, supreme judge and&nbsp;captain in chief. He nominated the podestàs of subject territories, despatched ambassadors, issued coin, concluded treaties&nbsp;and received oaths of obedience. The pope, who was then at&nbsp;Perugia, was greatly afflicted by the arrival of this new master,&nbsp;but, despairing of aid from any quarter, was forced to make a&nbsp;virtue of necessity. Thus Brancaleone was able to seize the&nbsp;reins of power with a firm grasp. The parliament still met in&nbsp;the square of the Capitol, and the greater and lesser councils&nbsp;in the church of Ara Coeli. There were besides frequent assemblies of the college of Capitoline judges or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">assectamentum.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Unfortunately, no records having been preserved of the proceedings of the Roman councils and parliament, little can be said&nbsp;of the manner in which affairs were conducted. Certainly&nbsp;Brancaleone’s government was not very parliamentary. He&nbsp;convoked the councils as seldom as was possible, although he&nbsp;frequently assembled the people in parliament. The chief&nbsp;complaint made against him was of undue severity in the administration of justice. He rendered the clergy amenable to secular&nbsp;tribunals, subdued the neighbouring cities of Tivoli, Palestrina,&nbsp;&amp;c., and commanded in person the attacking force. But his&nbsp;greatest energy was directed to the repression of the more&nbsp;turbulent nobles who were opposed to him; and he soon made&nbsp;them feel the weight of his hand by hanging some, banishing&nbsp;others, and persecuting several more. But he too recognized&nbsp;the expediency of winning the popular favour. He was the&nbsp;first senator to add to his title that of captain of the people&nbsp;(“ Almae Urbis Senator 111: et Romani Populi Capitaneus ”).&nbsp;He befriended the people by promoting the organization of&nbsp;gilds after the manner of those of his native Bologna. There&nbsp;were already a few in Rome, such as the merchants’ gild and&nbsp;that of the agriculturists, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bobacteriorum</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">B ovattar i,</span><span class="font0"> who&nbsp;must have resembled the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mercanti di campagna</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;graziers of the present day, since no peasant gild existed&nbsp;in Italian republics. The merchants’ gild, definitely established in 1255 under Brancaleone’s rule, had four consuls&nbsp;and twelve councillors, held meetings and made laws. The&nbsp;other gilds, thirteen in all, were organized much on the same&nbsp;plan. The admission of their heads into the councils of the&nbsp;republic in 1267 shows how efficaciously their interests had&nbsp;been promoted by Brancaleone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The death of Innocent IV. and the election of Alexander IV. (1254-61), who was milder and less shrewd than his predecessor,&nbsp;were favourable events for Brancaleone; but he failed to check&nbsp;the growing discontent of the clergy and the more powerful&nbsp;nobles, who had received deadly injuries at his hands. And&nbsp;when, on the expiration of his three years’ term of office, his&nbsp;re-election was proposed, his enemies rose against him, accused&nbsp;him before the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sindacato,</span><span class="font0"> threw him into prison, and vehemently protested against the continuance of <sup>a</sup> foreign tyranny.”&nbsp;His life was only spared on account of the hostages sent to&nbsp;Bologna. The next senator chosen was a Brescian Guelph,&nbsp;Emanuele de Madio, a tool of the nobles, who were now masters&nbsp;of the situation. But soon afterwards, in 1257, the gilds rose&nbsp;in revolt, drove the nobles from power, put the pope to flight,&nbsp;and recalled Brancaleone for another three years’ term. He&nbsp;ruled more sternly than before, hung several nobles, and made&nbsp;alliance with Manfred, the representative of the Swabian party&nbsp;in Italy. This rendered him increasingly odious to the pope&nbsp;and procured his excommunication. But, disregarding the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
