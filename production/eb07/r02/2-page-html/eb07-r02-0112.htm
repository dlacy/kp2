<p><span class="font1">slaughter. At length the Sabine women who had been carried away, and who were now reconciled to their fate, rushed with loud outcries, outspread hands, and dishevelled locks, between the combatants, imploring their husbands&nbsp;and their fathers to spare on each side those who were now&nbsp;to them equally dear. Both parties paused ; a conference&nbsp;began, a peace was concluded, and a treaty framed, by&nbsp;which the two nations were united into one. The Sabines&nbsp;built a new city on the Quirinal and Capitoline hills, on the&nbsp;north and north-w<sup>r</sup>est of the Roman hill, the Palatine ; and&nbsp;Romulus and Tatius became the joint sovereigns of the&nbsp;combined people. But though united, each nation continued to be governed by its own king and senate; and in&nbsp;all that respected their common interest they met in the&nbsp;valley between the Palatine and Capitoline hills, in a place&nbsp;from that circumstance called the Comitium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the double sway of Romulus and Tatius, a war was undertaken against the Latin town of Cameria, which&nbsp;was taken and made a Roman colony, and its people admitted into the Roman state, as had been done with those whom&nbsp;Romulus previously subdued. Tatius was s∞n afterwards&nbsp;slain by the people of Laurentum, because he had refused to do them justice against his kinsmen, who had violated the laws of nations by insulting their ambassadors.&nbsp;The death of Tatius left Romulus sole monarch of Rome.&nbsp;He was soon again engaged in a war with Fidenæ, a Tuscan settlement on the banks of the Tiber. This people he&nbsp;likewise overcame, and placed in the city a Roman colony.&nbsp;This war extending the Roman frontier, led to a hostile&nbsp;collision with Veii, in which he was also successful, and de-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ê</span><span class="font1">rived Veii, at that time one of the most powerful cities in ,truι&gt;ia, of a large portion of its territories, though he found&nbsp;the city itself was too strong to be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The reign of Romulus now drew near its close. One day, while holding a military muster or review of his army&nbsp;on a plain near the lake Capra, the sky was suddenly overcast with thick darkness, the light of tbe sun was quenched,&nbsp;and a dreadful tempest of thunder and lightning arose. The&nbsp;people fled in dismay; and when the storm abated, Romulus, over whose head it had raged most fiercely, was no where&nbsp;to be seen. A rumour was circulated that during the tempest he had been carried to heaven by his father, the god&nbsp;Mars. This opinion was speedily confirmed by the report&nbsp;of Proculus Julius, who declared, that as he was returning&nbsp;by night from Alba to Rome, Romulus appeared to him in&nbsp;a form of more than mortal majesty, and bade him go and&nbsp;tell the Romans, that Rome was destined by the gods to be&nbsp;the chief city of the earth, that human power should never&nbsp;be able to withstand them, and tllat he would himself be&nbsp;their guardian god Quirinus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So terminates what may be termed the legend of Romulus, the founder and first king of Rome. That no person, bearing any resemblance in name and actions, to what is&nbsp;recorded of him, ever existed, it would be perhaps too hazardous to affirm ; while it is perfectly evident that the&nbsp;greater part of the narrative is entirely fabulous. The story&nbsp;of Æneas and his Trojans rests upon no better foundation,&nbsp;and has no better claim to be believed. Indeed the various&nbsp;accounts respecting the Trojan leader and colony, are so&nbsp;contradictory as completely to destroy the pretensions of&nbsp;any of them to credibility. All the accounts of the reigns&nbsp;of Ascanius and his successors at Alba Longa, are equally&nbsp;fabulous. The divine paternity, miraculous preservation,&nbsp;and early exploits of Romulus and Remus, are evident fables, of a daringly poetic cast. But that a small strength,&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ρώμη,</span><span class="font1"> may have been constructed on the Palatine hill, by&nbsp;some bold and skilful leader of a band of freebooters, about&nbsp;the period assumed for the foundation of Rome, is by no&nbsp;means improbable. A city so founded, by a band so formed, not only might, but evidently must, have passed through&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">series of contests with the neighbouring cities, similar to&nbsp;those related of Romulus and his people. There may,&nbsp;therefore, be perfect poetical truth, so to speak, in the narrative, though it should be in a great measure devoid of real&nbsp;historical truth. Discarding its miraculous passages, it is&nbsp;sufficiently natural and self-consistent to be received as a&nbsp;traditional account of the adventures, perils, and fluctuating fortunes of the early founders of Rome, of whatsoever&nbsp;race descended, and by whomsoever led.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Upon the death of Romulus an interregnum took place ; during which the senate is reported to have divided itself&nbsp;into ten Decuriæ, each of which governed the state by turns,&nbsp;during periods of five days. At length it was agreed that&nbsp;a king should be chosen out of the Sabine part of the united&nbsp;people, but that the choice should be left to the Romans.&nbsp;Their choice fell upon Numa Pompilius, who is said to have&nbsp;been a citizen of Cures, of noble birth, and greatly distinguished for his wisdom and piety. Upon his election to&nbsp;the sovereignty, he refused to accept it till he had inquired by augury whether it were the will of the gods that&nbsp;he should be king. The omens being favourable, he next&nbsp;laid before the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia curiata</span><span class="font1"> the proposal of an enactment&nbsp;by which he should be acknowledged as king, and intrusted&nbsp;especially with full military command. Having received&nbsp;this public and formal recognition of his sovereign power,&nbsp;he then applied himself to the consolidation of the new&nbsp;kingdom and people, by the enactment of laws, and the appointment of whatever pertained to religious worship. To&nbsp;him is ascribed the apportion ing of the public territory which&nbsp;had been gained by conquest, to the new people who had&nbsp;become freemen of the Roman state. He determined the&nbsp;extent of the lands to be held by private citizens, marked&nbsp;their boundaries, and fixed them by landmarks consecrated&nbsp;to the god Terminus. Instead of endeavouring to extend&nbsp;the territory of the state, he assigned it also a fixed boundary, restrained the aggressive spirit of the warlike Romans,&nbsp;and strove to mollify them by the cultivation of the arts of&nbsp;peace, and especially by the exact and constant observance&nbsp;of religious rites. He instituted the orders of the priesthood, and determined their respective offices. To the Pontifex Maximus he gave the supreme authority in matters of&nbsp;religion. He appointed the flaraens, or priests of the three&nbsp;great gods of the nation, Jupiter, Mars, and Quirinus. To&nbsp;the service of the goddess Vesta he consecrated four virgin&nbsp;priestesses, whose duty it was to tend the ever-burning tire&nbsp;in her temple. By him was formed the institution of the&nbsp;Salii, who honoured Mars Gradivus by solemn songs and&nbsp;dances on appointed festal days, and who were intrusted&nbsp;with the custody of the sacred shield </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ancile,</span><span class="font1"> which fell&nbsp;down from heaven. To him is also ascribed the institution&nbsp;of the college of augurs, whom he himself instructed in the&nbsp;observation of the greater auspices, which were drawn&nbsp;from lightning, and other signs in the heavens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But in the formation of these sacred institutions, Numa did not solely trust to his own wisdom. He was instructed,&nbsp;says the legend, by the nymph Egeria, who met him in a&nbsp;sacred grotto, and taught him the will of the gods. So&nbsp;highly did she honour, and so dearly did she love him, tllat&nbsp;she took him to be her husband. To confirm the authority&nbsp;of Numa, and to ratify the laws which he made, and the&nbsp;sacred rites which he taught, Egeria gave to the Romans a&nbsp;token and proof of their divine origin. While Numa was&nbsp;entertaining a party of distinguished citizens, witll a meal of&nbsp;homely fare, and served on earthen vessels, Egeria, at his&nbsp;word, changed it into a feast of the most delicious viands&nbsp;in vessels of gold. But though a favourite of the gods,&nbsp;Numa was still mortal. He died full of age and honours,&nbsp;beloved and lamented by all his people, and mourned with&nbsp;ever-flowing sorrow’ by the nymph Egeria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such is the peaceful and lovely legend of Numa Pompilius, said to have been the second king of Rome, and to bave reigned forty years. It is, however, so manifestly poeti</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
