<p><span class="font1">RAMSAY, SIR WILLIAM (1852- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), British chemist,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">nephew of Sir A. C. Ramsay, was born at Glasgow on the 2nd of October 1852. From 1866 to 1870 he studied in his native city,&nbsp;and then went to work under R. Fittig at Tübingen. Returning&nbsp;to Glasgow in 1872 he became assistant in the Young laboratory&nbsp;of technical chemistry at Anderson’s College, and from 1874&nbsp;acted as tutorial assistant in chemistry at the university. In&nbsp;1880 he was appointed to the chair of chemistry at University&nbsp;College, Bristol, becoming principal in the following year, and in&nbsp;1887 he succeeded A. W. Williamson as professor of chemistry&nbsp;at University College, London. His earlier work was mainly&nbsp;concerned with organic chemistry, and he published researches on&nbsp;picoline and its derivatives in 1876-78 and on quinine and&nbsp;its decomposition products in 1878-79. Later his attention was&nbsp;taken up with questions of physical and inorganic chemistry.&nbsp;With Sydney Young and others he investigated the critical&nbsp;state and properties of liquids and the relationship between their&nbsp;vapour pressures and temperature, and with John Shields he&nbsp;applied measurements of the surface tension of liquids to the&nbsp;determination of their molecular complexity. In 1894 he was&nbsp;associated with Lord Rayleigh in the discovery of argon, announced at that year’s meeting of the British Association in&nbsp;Oxford, and in the following year he found in certain rare&nbsp;minerals such as cleveite the gas helium which till that time had&nbsp;only been known on spectroscopic evidence as existing in the&nbsp;sun. In 1898 his work with Morris William Travers (b. 1872),&nbsp;who from 1894 had assisted him at University College, London,&nbsp;and in 1903 was appointed professor of chemistry at University&nbsp;College, Bristol, enabled him to announce the existence in the&nbsp;atmosphere of three new gases, neon, krypton and xenon.&nbsp;Turning to the study of radioactivity, he noticed its association&nbsp;with the minerals which yield helium, and in support of the&nbsp;hypothesis that that gas is a disintegration-product of radium&nbsp;he proved in 1903 that it is continuously formed by the latter&nbsp;substance in quantities sufficiently great to be directly recognizable&nbsp; in the spectroscope. Among the books written by Sir&nbsp;William Ramsay, who was created K.C.B. in 1902, are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">System&nbsp;of Chemistry,</span><span class="font1"> 1891, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Gases of the Atmosphere,</span><span class="font1"> 1896, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Chemistry,</span><span class="font1"> vol. i. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theoretical,</span><span class="font1"> vol. ii. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Systematic,</span><span class="font1"> 1901,&nbsp;and he edited a series of “Textbooks of Physical Chemistry.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMSAY, SIR WILLIAM MITCHELL </span><span class="font1">(1851- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), British</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">archaeologist, was born on the 15th of March 1851. He was educated at the universities of Aberdeen, Oxford and Göttingen,&nbsp;and was a fellow of Exeter College, Oxford (1882; honorary&nbsp;fellow 1898), and Lincoln College (1885; honorary 1899). In 1885&nbsp;he was elected professor of classical art at Oxford, and in the next&nbsp;year professor of humanity at Aberdeen. From 1880 onwards&nbsp;he travelled widely in Asia Minor and rapidly became the recognized authority on all matters relating to the districts associ-ated with St Paul’s missionary journeys and on Christianity in&nbsp;the early Roman Empire. He received the honorary degrees of&nbsp;D.C.L. Oxford, LL.D. St Andrews and Glasgow, D.D. Edinburgh,&nbsp;and was knighted in 1906. He was elected a member of learned&nbsp;societies in Europe and America, and has been awarded medals&nbsp;by the Royal Geographical Society, the Royal Scottish Geographical&nbsp; Society and the University of Pennsylvania. His&nbsp;numerous publications include: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Historical Geography of&nbsp;Asia Minor</span><span class="font1"> (1890); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Church in the Roman Empire</span><span class="font1"> (1893);&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia</span><span class="font1"> (2 vols., 1895, 1897);&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">St Paul the Traveller and the Roman Citizen</span><span class="font1"> (1895; Germ.&nbsp;trans., 1898); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Impressions of Turkey</span><span class="font1"> (1897); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Was Christ born&nbsp;at Bethlehem?</span><span class="font1"> (1898); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Commentary on Galatians&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1899); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Education of Christ</span><span class="font1"> (1902); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Letters io&nbsp;the Seven Churches of Asia</span><span class="font1"> (1905); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pauline and other Studies&nbsp;in Early Christian History</span><span class="font1"> (1906) ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in the History and&nbsp;Art of the Eastern Provinces of the Roman Empire</span><span class="font1"> (1906);&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Cities of St Paul</span><span class="font1"> (1907); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lucan and Pauline Studies&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1908) ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Thousand and One Churches</span><span class="font1"> (with Miss Gertrude L.&nbsp;Bell, 1909); and articles in learned periodicals and the 9th, 10th&nbsp;and nth editions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica.</span><span class="font1"> His wife,&nbsp;Lady Ramsay, granddaughter of Dr Andrew Marshall of Kirkintilloch, accompanied him in many of his journeys and is the&nbsp;author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Everyday Life in Turkey</span><span class="font1"> (1897) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Romance of&nbsp;Elisaυet</span><span class="font1"> (1899).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMSBOTTOM, an urban district in the Heywood parliamentary division of Lancashire, England, 4 m. N. of Bury, on the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire railway. Pop. (1901) 15,920.&nbsp;It has iron and brass foundries, machine factories and textile&nbsp;establishments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMSDEN, JESSE (1735-1800), English astronomical instrument maker, was born at Salterhebble near Halifax,&nbsp;Yorkshire, on the 6th of October 1735. After serving his&nbsp;apprenticeship with a cloth-worker in Halifax, he went in&nbsp;1755 to London, where in 1758 he was apprenticed to a mathe-matical instrument maker. About four years afterwards he&nbsp;started business on his own account and secured a great&nbsp;reputation with his products. He died at Brighton on the&nbsp;5th of November 1800. Ramsden’s speciality was divided&nbsp;circles, which began to supersede the quadrants in observatories&nbsp;towards the end of the 18th century. His most celebrated&nbsp;work was a 5-feet vertical circle, which was finished in 1789&nbsp;and was used by G. Piazzi at Palermo in constructing his&nbsp;well-known catalogue of stars. He was the first to carry out&nbsp;in practice a method of reading off angles (first suggested in&nbsp;1768 by the duke of Chaulnes) by measuring the distance of&nbsp;the index from the nearest division line by means of a micrometer screw which moves one or two fine threads placed in&nbsp;the focus of a microscope. Ramsden’s transit instruments&nbsp;were the first which were illuminated through the hollow&nbsp;axis; the idea was suggested to him by Prof. Henry Ussher&nbsp;in Dublin. He published a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Description of an Engine for dividing&nbsp;Mathematical Instruments</span><span class="font1"> in 1777.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMSEY, a market-town in the Northern or Ramsey parliamentary division of Huntingdonshire, England, on the&nbsp;south-western border of the Fen country, on branch lines&nbsp;of the Great Northern and the Great Eastern railways, 13 m.&nbsp;S.S.E. of Peterborough. Pop. of urban district (1901) 4823.&nbsp;The fine church of St Thomas à Becket is transitional between&nbsp;Norman and Early English, and has a beautiful Norman east&nbsp;end. The tower was built in 1672 of stone from Ramsey Abbey.&nbsp;An old oak lectern, dating from the middle of the 15th century,&nbsp;carries a chained copy, in a Tudor binding of brass, of Dean&nbsp;Comber’s (1655-99) book on the Common Prayer, and a&nbsp;black-letter copy of Erasmus’s Paraphrase of the Gospels.&nbsp;There are many interesting tombs in the churchyard, and&nbsp;the church register contains several entries relating to the&nbsp;Cromwell family, who removed hither from Huntingdon and&nbsp;owned the abbey estates till 1674. Of the ancient Benedictine&nbsp;abbey, the only remains are a part of a gateway, a lodge (a&nbsp;beautiful Perpendicular relic) and some buttresses, while some&nbsp;broken stone arches and walls remain of the conventual&nbsp;buildings. The modern mansion of Ramsey Abbey contains&nbsp;many documentary relics of the abbey, as well as an early&nbsp;monument representing the founder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to a 12th-century chronicle of one of the monks, the name Ramsey is derived from the words “ ram,” referring&nbsp;to the tradition of a solitary ram having taken up its abode&nbsp;here, and “ ey ’’ meaning an island. Ramsey, however,&nbsp;was not completely insulated, like some of the monasteries of&nbsp;the Fen district. The abbey was founded by Ailwin, earl of&nbsp;the East Angles, in 969, and a charter of King Edgar granted&nbsp;lands and privileges for the purpose. Ramsey Abbey was&nbsp;noted for the school established within its walls, and for its library of Hebrew works. Its abbot was mitred. The lands&nbsp;were granted after the dissolution to Sir Richard Cromwell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMSEY, a seaport and watering-place on the north-east coast of the Isle of Man, 15 m. N.N.E. of Douglas. Pop.&nbsp;(1901) 4729. It lies on the wide Ramsey Bay, at the mouth&nbsp;of the Sulby river, the estuary of which forms a small harbour.&nbsp;To the north and west the country is flat, but to the south the&nbsp;lower slopes of the North Ballure hill rise sharply. A creek of the Sulby river on the north side of the town is formed&nbsp;into a* picturesque lake. The Queen’s pier permits of the&nbsp;landing of passengers at all times, and Ramsey is served by</span></p>
