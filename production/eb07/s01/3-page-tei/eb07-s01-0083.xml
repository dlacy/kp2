From this place all our ancestors, even without waiting for sickness, have departed into Eden. It is useless, therefore, to give ourselves up to groans and complaints, or to put our relations to needless expenses, since we can easily follow the example of our fathers, who have all gone by the way of this rock.” When all these methods failed, and at last when Christianity had banished such barbarous practices, the disconsolate heroes consoled themselves by putting on complete armour as soon as they found their end approaching.</p><p>SCANNING, in <hi rend="italic">Poetry,</hi> the measuring of verse by feet, in order to see whether or not the quantities be duly observed. The term is chiefly used in Greek and in Latin verses. Thus an hexameter verse is scanned by resolving it into six feet ; a pentamcter, by resolving it into five feet ; and so of the rest.</p><p>SCANTLING, a measure, size, or standard, by which the dimensions of things are to be determined. The term is particularly applied to the dimensions of any piece of timber, with regard to its breadth and thickness.</p><p>SCAPE-GOAT, in Jewish antiquities, the goat which was set at liberty on the day of solemn expiation. Some say that a piece of scarlet cloth, in form of a tongue, was tied upon the forehead of the scape-goat. (Hoffmann, <hi rend="italic">Lex. Univ. </hi>in voc. <hi rend="italic">Lingua.)</hi> Many have been the disputes among the interpreters concerning the meaning of the word scapegoat, or rather of <hi rend="italic">Azazel</hi>, for which scape-goat is put in our version of the Bible. Spenser is of opinion that Azazel is a proper name, signifying the devil or evil dæmon. Among other things, he observes that the ancient Jews used to substitute the name <hi rend="italic">Sαmaël</hi> for Azazel ; and many of them have ventured to affirm, that at the feast of expiation they were obliged to offer a gift to Samaël to obtain his favour. Thus also the goat sent into the wilderness to Azazel, was understood to be a gift or oblation. Some Christians have been of the same opinion. But Spenser thinks that the genuine reasons of the ceremony were, that the goat loaded with the sins of the people, and sent to Azazel, might be a symbolical representation of the miserable condition of sinners ; that God sent the goat thus loaded to the evil dæmons, to show that they were impure, thereby to deter the people from any conversation or familiarity with them ; and that the goat sent to Azazel, sufficiently expiating all evils, the Israelites might the more willingly abstain from the expiatory sacrifices of the Gentiles.</p><p>SCAPEMENT, in clock-work, a general terra for the manner of communicating the impulse of the wheels to the pendulum. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Clock and Watch Work.</hi></p><p>SCAPULA, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi>, the reputed author of a Greek lexicon, studied at Lausanne. His name is recorded in the annals of literature, neither on account of his talents, nor learning, nor virtuous industry, but for a gross act of disingenuity and fraud which he committed against an eminent literary character of the sixteenth century. Being employed by Henry Stephens as a corrector of his press while he was publishing his <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Lingua Graca, </hi>Scapula extracted those words and explications which he reckoned most useful, comprised them in one volume, and published them as an original work, with his own name.</p><p>The compilation and printing of the Thesaurus had cost Stephens immense labour and expense; but it was so much admired by those learned men to whom he had shown it, and seemed to be of such essential importance to the acquisition of the Greek language, that he reasonably hoped his labour would be crowned with honour, and that the money he had expended would be repaid by a rapid and extensive sale. But before his work came abroad, Scapula’s abridgment appeared, which, from its size and price, was quickly purchased, while the Thesaurus itself lay neglected in the author’s hands. The consequence was a bankruptcy on the part of Stephens, while he who had occasioned it was</p><p>enjoying the fruits of his treachery. Scapula’s Lexicon was first printed in the year 1570, in 4to. It was afterwards enlarged, and published in folio; and it has gone through several editions, while the valuable work of Stephens has never been reprinted. Its success is, however, not owing to its superior merit, but to its moderate price and commodious size. Stephens charges the author with omitting a great many important articles. He accuses him of misunderstanding and perverting his meaning, and of tracing out absurd and trifling etymologies, which he himself had been careful to avoid. Dr Bushy, so much celebrated for his knowledge of the Greek language, and his success in teaching it, would never permit his scholars at Westminster school to make use of Scapula.</p><p>SCAPULAR, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Scapulary,</hi> a part of the habit of several religious orders in the Church of Rome, worn over the gown as a badge of peculiar veneration for the blessed Virgin. It consists of two narrow slips or breadths of cloth covering the back and the breast, and hanging down to the feet. The devotees of the scapulary celebrate its festival on the 10th of July.</p><p>SCARBOROUGH, a town on the shore of the German Ocean, in the lathe of Pickering, in the north riding of the county of York, and 216 miles from London. This town is distant about five leagues north-west from Flamborough Head. It has a harbour, which is dry at low water, and of late has been so improved as to afford shelter, in all gales of wind upon the coast, to vessels capable of bearing the ground. The ancient pier has been extended, and formed into a new harbour, which may be resorted to when the old harbour is crowded, and where are placed dolphins and mooring rings. A lighthouse has been erected upon the pier, which is kept burning from half flood to half ebb, as a direction to vessels entering in the night.</p><p>Though the harbour of Scarborough is thus useful as a protection for the smaller class of vessels, the trade of the port is not extensive. The chief exports consist of bacon hams, butter, and corn ; and the chief imports arc coals, timber, flax, and iron, with wine, gin, brandy, and rum, from the places of their growth, and groceries from London. The only manufactories are those connected with shipping, such as cordage and sail-cloth. The building of ships forms some occupation, but it is a fluctuating and precarious employment.</p><p>The chief importance of Scarborough arises from its being a most agreeable bathing-place, to which strangers repair in the summer. Besides the inducement to sea-bathing, many resort to it on account of its mineral springs, called the Spa.</p><p>The situation and view of Scarborough, either from the land or the sea, is striking and picturesque. The castle, on an extensive site, now in ruins, stands on a promontory running into the sea, and rising to the height of more than 300 feet above it. It was built in the reign of King Stephen, in 1136, and must have been then a place of unassailable strength, extending over an area of nineteen acres, the walls of which can be still traced, and having within it a copious well of water. The keep is at present in tolerable preservation. It is a square Norman building, ninety feet in height, and had formerly an embattled parapet. The walls are about twelve feet in thickness, cased with squared stones ; and the mortar having been, according to ancient custom, in a fluid state, has become more durable than even the stone of the building.</p><p>The town confers the title of earl upon the family of Lumley. It returns two members to the House of Commons, as heretofore. By the municipal reform law it is now divided into two wards, in which are chosen six aldermen and eighteen councillors. The population (taken in May, when no visiters are in the town) amounted in 1801 to 6409, in 1811 to 6710, in 1821 to 8188, and in 1831 to 8760.</p></body></text></TEI>
