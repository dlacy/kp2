<p><label>RAREFACTION</label>
    in phyſics, the act whereby a body is rendered rare ; that is, brought to poſſeſs more room, or appear under a larger bulk, without accession of any new matter. This is very frequently the effect of fire, as has long been univerſally allowed. In many caſes, however, philoſophers have attributed it to the action of a repulſive principle. However, irom the many diſcoveries concerning the nature and properties of the electric fluid and fire, there is the greateſt reaſon to believe, that this repulſive principle is no other than elementary fire.
