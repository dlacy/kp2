<p><span class="font0">the use of the horse in war (Job xxxix. 18-25), as did the Persians (Cyrus at the battle of Thymbra), Greeks and Romans.&nbsp;The Greeks and Romans, especially the former, were skilled&nbsp;horsemen, and feats on horseback were a feature of their games.&nbsp;They used no stirrup, but had both bridle and bit. They rode&nbsp;bareback, or on a cloth or skin strapped to the horse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When roads were poor and vehicles cumbersome horseback was almost the only method of travel for both sexes. With&nbsp;the introduction of steam-locomotion and the improvement of&nbsp;roads, however, riding has become to a large extent a sport,&nbsp;rather than a necessity. There are different styles of riding&nbsp;adapted to the different purposes for which horses are ridden—&nbsp;on the road, in the school, hunting, racing, steeple-chasing and&nbsp;in the cavalry service—just as there are different horses more&nbsp;suitable by conformation, breeding and training for each.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In western civilization there is a traditional difference between the riding of men and women, in this particular, that men ride&nbsp;astride and women on a side-saddle. But in the following&nbsp;observations we deal generally with the more important features&nbsp;of riding as practised astride.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After securing an animal of the right height, weight and disposition, with a saddle of a length of tree and a breadth of seat&nbsp;that fits the rider and that is lined to fit the back of the horse,&nbsp;with a bridle bitted to his mouth, the first step is to mount.&nbsp;Having taken up the reins, the rider should stand at his horse’s&nbsp;near (left) shoulder, facing towards the tail, and in that position&nbsp;hold the stirrup with his right hand for the reception of his left&nbsp;foot. By standing at the shoulder the rider is out of harm’s&nbsp;way in the event of the horse kicking while he mounts. Ladies&nbsp;generally have the aid of a block or a groom’s or escort’s hand&nbsp;beneath the left foot. But a woman should be able to mount&nbsp;without aid, by lowering her stirrup, so that she can reach it&nbsp;from the ground, and then raising it again when she is seated&nbsp;in the saddIe. Riding astride is sometimes recommended for&nbsp;women. The chief argument in its favour — symmetrical&nbsp;development of the figure—is, however, lost if the growing girl&nbsp;be taught to ride on a side-saddle of which the pommels can be&nbsp;shifted to the off side on alternate days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having gained the saddle, the necessity arises for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">seat</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hands.</span><span class="font0"> Here good instruction is imperative at the outset.&nbsp;The great desideratum in a seat on horseback is that it should&nbsp;be firm. A rider with an insecure seat is apt to be thrown by&nbsp;any unexpected movement the horse may make; and, without&nbsp;a firm seat, the acquirement of good hands is well-nigh hopeless,&nbsp;because, when the balance is once disturbed the insecure rider&nbsp;will have to depend on something else for the maintenance of&nbsp;his seat, and this generally takes the shape of “ riding on the&nbsp;horse’s mouth,” a practice as cruel as it is ugly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having gained the saddle, the rider should adjust the stirrups to the proper length, depending on the kind of riding, the length&nbsp;of his leg and the roughness of the horse’s trot. Sitting well&nbsp;in the middle of the saddle, the thighs turned in, and the heels&nbsp;drawn somewhat back, the stirrup leathers may be let out or&nbsp;taken up until the tread of the stirrup is on a level with the&nbsp;inner ankle bone, and at this length, when the rider stands up,&nbsp;his fork will easily clear the pommel of the saddle. For maintaining his seat the horseman should depend upon his thighs&nbsp;and knees only, and not upon the knee and calf; a proper seat&nbsp;should be a mixture of balance and grip; a man riding by balance&nbsp;only is sure to be thrown, while to grip with all one’s might&nbsp;during an hour’s ride is to undertake as much exertion as should&nbsp;last for a whole day. The position of the foot exercises much&nbsp;influence on the security of the seat; it should be opposite&nbsp;the girth, parallel with the barrel of the horse, with the heels&nbsp;depressed. A good seat on a horse should not be strong merely;&nbsp;it should be graceful; above the loins the body should be loose,&nbsp;so as readily to adapt itself to every motion of the horse, but&nbsp;it should be upright.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Beginners are advised to practise riding with and without stirrups; thus, let the pupil who has ridden half an hour in a&nbsp;saddle with stirrups have a cloth substituted for the saddle for&nbsp;about ten minutes, care being taken to observe the rules already&nbsp;laid down for the position of the legs; in this way the proper&nbsp;seat will be strengthened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The proper adjustment of the reins is the next thing to be attended to, and as the management of these depends so much&nbsp;upon the seat being firm and independent of the bridle the&nbsp;acquisition of a firm seat is certainly half-way towards the&nbsp;acquirement of good hands. An excellent way to start a pupil&nbsp;is on a sure-footed horse without bridle, the master governing&nbsp;him by a leading rein until the pupil has acquired a firm seat&nbsp;and can be trusted with reins. Assuming that a double-reined&nbsp;bridle is used, the third finger of the left hand should be first&nbsp;inserted between the snaffle reins; then the little, third and&nbsp;second fingers should be between the curb reins, the two outside&nbsp;reins being the curb, and the two inside ones the snaffle. In&nbsp;this manner of holding the reins the snaffle is not so likely to&nbsp;slip, while the curb can be easily slackened or drawn tighter.&nbsp;As military riders use the curb only the position of snaffle and&nbsp;curb as just explained is reversed in the cavalry service. The&nbsp;snaffle reins should be drawn up gently until the rider feels that&nbsp;he has an equal and light hold of his horse’s mouth on both&nbsp;sides, with just so much pressure that the slightest movement of&nbsp;the left or right rein would cause him to turn to the left or right&nbsp;respectively. The arms from the shoulder to the elbow should&nbsp;hang naturally, close to the sides, and the arms from elbow&nbsp;to wrist should be about parallel to the ground, the wrist being&nbsp;kept loose, so as to yield gently with every motion of the horse.&nbsp;The rider sitting in the position described, square to the front,&nbsp;with his shoulders well back, will be riding with fairly long reins,&nbsp;one of the secrets of good hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the horse is in motion the hands should not be held rigid, as the horse’s mouth would thereby become dead, and the&nbsp;horse would lean unpleasantly on the hand; but the rider&nbsp;should give and take, without, however, entirely relaxing the&nbsp;hold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In order to encourage the horse to walk the head must not be confined, but a light feeling of the horse’s mouth must be&nbsp;kept up. Should the horse, unasked, break into a trot, never&nbsp;snatch at his mouth, but restrain him gently. To trot, press&nbsp;the legs to the saddle, and raise the bridle hand a little, and,&nbsp;after a moment’s sitting close, begin to rise (“ pose ”) in cadence&nbsp;with the action of the horse. The rising to the trot should be&nbsp;performed easily; the legs must not swing backwards and&nbsp;forwards, nor should the hands be jerked up and down. To*&nbsp;start the canter, which should always be done from the walk&nbsp;and not the trot, take up the curb rein a little and turn the&nbsp;horse’s head slightly to the right, at the same time pressing the&nbsp;left leg behind the girth; the horse will then lead with the off&nbsp;(right) fore leg, which is generally preferred; but a well-broken&nbsp;hack should lead with either leg at command, and if he be&nbsp;cantered in a circle to the left he must lead with the near leg, as&nbsp;otherwise an ugly fall is likely to result from the leg being&nbsp;crossed. Galloping is a pace not to be generally indulged in&nbsp;by road or park riders; when it is, the hands should be kept&nbsp;low, the body thrown back, and an extra grip taken with the&nbsp;knees, as nearly all horses pull more or less when extended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hitherto only road or park riding has been considered. When a person has become a fair road rider he has made some&nbsp;progress towards being a hunting man. But if first principles&nbsp;are disregarded, and a follower of hounds believes in the system&nbsp;“it doesn’t matter how you ride so long as you stick on,” he&nbsp;will not only always be a “ sight ” but a menace in the hunting&nbsp;field. Few self-taught riders attain to excellence; they may&nbsp;keep a good place in hunting, if possessed of plenty of courage,&nbsp;and mounted on a bold and not too tender-mouthed horse,&nbsp;but they never will be riders in the proper sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hunting and Riding to Hounds.—</span><span class="font0">For practical purposes the chief difference between a park seat and a hunting seat consists&nbsp;in the shortening of the stirrups some two or three holes. The seat&nbsp;of the hunting man is the most important of any connected with&nbsp;amusement; he must sit firm, so as not to be thrown off when&nbsp;his horse leaps, or makes a mistake, and he must be able to save&nbsp;his horse under all circumstances, and to make as much of him&nbsp;as possible. As with road riding, so with hunting, the actual</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
