or the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's-day,</hi> a ſolemn feſtival obſerved by Chriſtians on the firſt day of every week, in memory of our Saviour’s reſurrection. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Sabbath.</hi></p><p>In the breviary and other offices we meet with Sundays of the firſt and ſecond claſs. Thoſe of the firſt claſs are, Palm, Eaſter, Advent, and Whitſunday, thoſe of Quasimodo and Q <hi rend="italic">uadragesima.</hi> Thoſe of the ſecond claſs are the common Sundays. Anciently each Sunday in the year had its particular name, which was taken from the introit of the day ; which cuſtom has only been continued to ſome few in lent ; as <hi rend="italic">Reminiscere, Oculi, Laetare, Judica.</hi></p><p>Some are of opinion that the Lord’s-day, mentioned in the Apocalypſe, is our Sunday ; which they believe was so early inſtituted by the apoſtles. Be this as it will, it is certain a regard was had to this day even in the earlieſt ages of the church ; as appears from the firſt apology of Justin Martyr, where he deſcribes the exerciſe of the day not much unlike to ours.</p><p>But it was Constantine the Great who firſt made a law for the proper observation of Sunday; and who, according to Euſebius, appointed it ſhould be regularly celebrated throughout the Roman empire. Before him, and even in his time, they obſerved the Jewiſh Sabbath as well as Sunday ; both to ſatisfy the law of Moſes and to imitate the apoſtles, who uſed to meet together on the firſt day.</p><p>By Conſtantine’s? laws, made in 321, it was decreed, that for the future the Sunday ſhould be kept a day of reſt in all cities and towns ; but he allowed the country people to follow their work. In 538, the council of Orleans prohibited country labour ; but becauſe there were ſtill many Jews in Gaul, and the people fell into many ſuperſtitious uſages in the cclebratiop of the new Sabbath, like thoſe of the Jews among that of the old, the council declares, that to hold it unlawful to travel with horſes, cattle, and carriages, to prepare food, or to do any thing neceſſary to the cleanlineſs and decency of houſes or perſons, favours more of Judaiſm than of Chriſtianity.
