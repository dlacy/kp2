<p><span class="font2">later times, when no <sup>a</sup> patrician magistrates ” were forthcoming to hold the elections for their successors, a procedure was&nbsp;adopted which was believed to represent the manner in which&nbsp;the early kings had been appointed.@@In this procedure the&nbsp;ancient privileges of the old </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font2"> and their elders, the&nbsp;importance of maintaining unbroken the continuity of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sacra,</span><span class="font2"> on the transmission and observance of which the welfare of the community depended, and thirdly the rights of&nbsp;the freemen, are all recognized. On the death of a king, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">auspicia,</span><span class="font2"> and with them the supreme authority, revert to the&nbsp;council of elders, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patres,</span><span class="font2"> as representing the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gentes.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">By the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patres</span><span class="font2"> an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">interrex</span><span class="font2"> is appointed, who in turn&nbsp;nominates a second; by him, or even by a third or fourth&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">interrex,</span><span class="font2"> a new king is selected in consultation with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patres.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The king-designate is then proposed to the freemen assembled&nbsp;by their curiae for their acceptance, and finally their formal&nbsp;acceptance is ratified by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patres,</span><span class="font2"> as a security that the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sacra</span><span class="font2"> of which they are the guardians have been respected.@@<sup>&nbsp;</sup>Thus the king is in the first instance selected by the representatives of the old </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gentes,</span><span class="font2"> and they ratify his appointment. In&nbsp;form he is nominated directly by a predecessor from whose&nbsp;hands he receives the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">auspicia.</span><span class="font2"> But it is necessary also that&nbsp;the choice of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patres</span><span class="font2"> and the nomination of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">interrex&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">should be confirmed by a solemn vote of the community.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is useless to attempt a precise definition of the prerogatives of the king when once installed in office. Tradition ascribes&nbsp;to him a position and powers closely resembling those of the&nbsp;heroic kings of Greece. He rules for life, and he is the sole&nbsp;ruler, unfettered by written statutes. He is the supreme judge,&nbsp;settling all disputes and punishing wrongdoers even with death.&nbsp;All other officials are appointed by him. He imposes taxes,&nbsp;distributes lands and erects buildings. Senate and assembly&nbsp;meet only when he convenes them, and meet for little else&nbsp;than to receive communications from him. In war he is&nbsp;absolute leader,@@and finally he is also the religious head of the&nbsp;community. It is his business to consult the gods on its behalf,&nbsp;to offer the solemn sacrifices and to announce the days of the&nbsp;public festivals. Hard by his house was the common hearth&nbsp;of the state, where the vestal virgins cherished the sacred fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">By the side of the king stood the senate, or council of elders. In the descriptions left us of the primitive senate, as in those&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rex,</span><span class="font2"> we can discover traces of a transition from&nbsp;an earlier state of things when Rome was only an assemblage of clans or village communities, allied indeed,&nbsp;but each still ruled by its own chiefs and headmen, to one in&nbsp;which these groups have been fused into a single state under&nbsp;a common ruler. On the one hand the senate appears as a&nbsp;representative council of chiefs, with inalienable prerogatives&nbsp;of its own, and claiming to be the ultimate depositary of&nbsp;the supreme authority and of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sacra</span><span class="font2"> connected with it.&nbsp;The senators are the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patres',</span><span class="font2"> they are taken from the leading&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gentes*,</span><span class="font2"> they hold their seats for life; to them the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">auspicia&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">revert on the death of a king; they appoint the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">interrex</span><span class="font2"> from&nbsp;their own body, are consulted in the choice of the new king@@&nbsp;and their sanction is necessary to ratify the vote of the assembled&nbsp;freemen. On the other hand, they are no longer supreme.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">They cannot appoint a king but with the consent of the community, and their relation to the king when appointed is one of subordination. Vacancies in their ranks are filled up by&nbsp;him, and they can but give him advice and counsel when he&nbsp;chooses to consult them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The popular assembly of united Rome in its earliest days was that in which the freemen met and voted by their curiae&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(comitia curiata<sup>@@5</sup>.</span><span class="font2"> The place of assembly was in&nbsp;the Comitium at the north-east end of the Forum<sup>@@5</sup>/&nbsp;at the summons and under the presidency of the king&nbsp;or, failing him, of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">interrex.</span><span class="font2"> By the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rex</span><span class="font2"> or the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">intcrrex&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the question was put, and the voting took place </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">curiatim,</span><span class="font2"> the&nbsp;curiae being called up in turn. The vote of each curia was&nbsp;decided by the majority of individual votes, and a majority of&nbsp;the votes of the curiae determined the final result. But the&nbsp;occasions on which the assembly could exercise its power must&nbsp;have been few. Their right to elect magistrates was apparently&nbsp;limited to the acceptance or rejection of the king proposed by&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">interrex.</span><span class="font2"> Of the passing of laws, in the later sense of the&nbsp;term, there is no trace in the kingly period. Dionysius’s statement<sup>@@7</sup> that they voted on questions of war and peace is improbable in itself and unsupported by tradition. They are&nbsp;indeed represented, in one instance, as deciding a capital case,&nbsp;but it is by the express permission of the king and not of right.<sup>@@8&nbsp;</sup>Assemblies of the people were also, and probably more frequently,&nbsp;convened for other purposes. Not only did they meet to hear&nbsp;from the king the announcement of the high days and holidays&nbsp;for each month, and to witness such solemn .religious rites as the&nbsp;inauguration of a priest, but their presence (and sometimes&nbsp;their vote) was further required to authorize and attest certain&nbsp;acts, which in a later age assumed a more private character.&nbsp;The disposal of property by will<sup>@@9</sup> and the solemn renunciation&nbsp;of family or gentile </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sacra<sup>@@10</sup></span><span class="font2">could only take place in the presence&nbsp;of the assembled freemen, while for adoption<sub>@@11</sub> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(adrogatio)</span><span class="font2"> not&nbsp;only their presence but their formal consent was necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A history of this early Roman state is out of the question. The names, dates and achievements of the first four kings are&nbsp;all too unsubstantial to form the basis of a sober&nbsp;narrative;<sup>@@12</sup> a few points only can be considered as&nbsp;fairly well established. If we except the long eventless reign ascribed to King Numa, tradition represents the first&nbsp;kings as incessantly at war with their immediate neighbours.&nbsp;The details of these wars are no doubt mythical; but the&nbsp;implied condition of continual struggle, and the narrow range&nbsp;within which the struggle is confined, may be accepted as true.&nbsp;The picture drawn is that of a small community, with a few&nbsp;square miles of territory, at deadly feud with its nearest neighbours, within a radius of some 12 m. round Rome. Nor, in&nbsp;spite of the repeated victories with which tradition credits&nbsp;’ Romulus, Ancus and Tullus, does there seem to have been&nbsp;any real extension of Roman territory except towards the sea.&nbsp;Fidenae remains Etruscan; the Sabines continue masters up to&nbsp;the Anio; Praeneste, Gabii and Tusculum are still untouched;&nbsp;and on this side it is doubtful if Roman territory, in spite of the&nbsp;possible destruction of Alba, extended to a greater distance&nbsp;than the sixth milestone from Rome.<sup>@@13</sup> But along the course</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
