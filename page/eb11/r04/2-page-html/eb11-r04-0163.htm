<p><span class="font0">Giovanni Janduno placarded the walls with insulting manifestoes against the pope, whom the Minorites stigmatized as a heretic&nbsp;and wished to depose. In April Louis twice assembled the&nbsp;parliament in St Peter’s Square, and, after obtaining its sanction&nbsp;to several anti-papal edicts, declared John XXII. degraded&nbsp;and deposed as a heretic. This was a very strange and novel&nbsp;spectacle, the more so that, as was speedily proved, the Romans&nbsp;were stirred by no anti-Catholic spirit, no yearning for religious&nbsp;reform. Jacopo Colonna, a canon of the Lateran, was able&nbsp;to make his way into Rome with four masked companions, to&nbsp;publicly read, at the top of his voice and before a great multitude,&nbsp;the excommunication launched against the emperor by the&nbsp;deposed pope, to traverse the entire city, and to withdraw unmolested to Palestrina. Meanwhile the emperor contented&nbsp;himself with decreeing that henceforth the popes must reside&nbsp;in Rome,—that if, when invited, they should fail to come&nbsp;they would be thereby held deposed from the throne. As a&nbsp;logical consequence, proceedings were immediately begun for&nbsp;the election of the new pope, Nicholas V., who on the 12th of&nbsp;May was proclaimed by the popular voice in St Peter’s Square,&nbsp;and received the imperial sanction. But this ephemeral&nbsp;drama came to an end when the emperor departed with his&nbsp;antipope on the 4th of August. This caused the immediate&nbsp;downfall of the democratic government. Bertoldo Orsini, who&nbsp;had returned to Rome with his Guelphs, and Stefano Colonna&nbsp;were elected senators, and confirmed in the office by Cardinal&nbsp;Giovanni Orsini in the name of the pope. A new parliament&nbsp;cancelled the emperor’s edicts, and had them burnt by the&nbsp;public executioner. Later, Nicholas, the antipope, went with&nbsp;a rope about his neck to make submission to John XXII., and&nbsp;Louis promised to disavow and retract all that he had done&nbsp;against the church, provided the sentence of excommunication&nbsp;were withdrawn. This, however, was refused. Never had&nbsp;the empire fallen so low. Meanwhile King Robert was again&nbsp;supreme in Rome, and, being re-elected senator, appointed&nbsp;vicars there as before. Anarchy reigned. The city was torn&nbsp;by factions, and the provinces rebelled against the French&nbsp;representatives of the pope, who, in their ignorance of Italian&nbsp;affairs, were at a loss how to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And after the election of Benedict XII. (1334-42) confusion reached so great a pitch that, on the expiration of Robert’s&nbsp;senatorial term, the Romans named thirteen heads of regions&nbsp;to carry on the government with two senators, while the king&nbsp;still sent vicars as before. The people, for the sake of peace,&nbsp;once more granted the supremacy of the senate to the pope,&nbsp;and he nominated two knights of Gubbio, Giacomo di Cante&nbsp;dei Gabrielli and Bosone Novello dei Gabrielli, who were&nbsp;succeeded by two other senators the following year. But in&nbsp;1339 the Romans attacked the Capitol, named two&nbsp;senators of their own choice, re-established a democratic government, and sent ambassadors to Florence&nbsp;to ask for the ordinances of justice </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ordinamenti&nbsp;della giustizia),</span><span class="font0"> by which that city had broken the power&nbsp;of the nobles, and also that a few skilled citizens should lend&nbsp;their help in the reconstitution of Rome. Accordingly some&nbsp;Florentines came with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ordinamenti,</span><span class="font0"> some portions of which&nbsp;may be recognized in the Roman statutes, and, after first rearranging the taxes, elected thirteen priors of the gilds, a gonfalonier of justice; and a captain of the people after the Florentine&nbsp;manner. But there was a dissimilarity in the conditions of the&nbsp;two cities. The gilds having Ettle influence in Rome, the&nbsp;projected reform failed, and the pope, who was opposed to it, reelected the senators. Thereupon public discontent swelled,&nbsp;and especially when, by the foundation of the papal palace of&nbsp;Avignon, it was evident that Benedict XII. had no intention of&nbsp;restoring the Holy See to Italy. This pope was succeeded in&nbsp;1342 by Clement VI. (1342-52), and King Robert in 1343 by&nbsp;his niece Joanna; and the latter event, while plunging the&nbsp;kingdom in anarchy, likewise aggravated the condition of Rome.&nbsp;For not only were the Neapolitan sovereigns still very powerful&nbsp;there, but the principal Roman nobles held large fiefs across</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the Neapolitan borders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Shortly before this another revolution in Rome had reestablished the government of the thirteen elders and the two senators. The people, being anxious to show&nbsp;their intention of respecting the papal authority, had&nbsp;despatched to Avignon as ambassador of the republic,&nbsp;in 1343, a man destined to make much noise in the world. This&nbsp;was Cola di Rienzi, son of a Roman innkeeper, a notary, and&nbsp;an impassioned student of the Bible, the fathers, Livy, Seneca,&nbsp;Cicero, and Valerius Maximus. Thoroughly imbued with a&nbsp;half pagan, half Christian spirit, he believed that he had a&nbsp;divinely inspired mission to revive the ancient glories of Rome.&nbsp;Of handsome presence, full of fantastic eloquence, and stirred&nbsp;to enthusiasm by contemplation of the ruined monuments of&nbsp;Rome, he harangued the people with a stilted oratory that enchanted their ears. He hated the nobles, because one of his&nbsp;brothers had been killed by them; he loved the republic, and&nbsp;in its name addressed a stately Latin speech to the astonished&nbsp;pope, and, offering him the supreme power, besought his instant&nbsp;return to Rome. He also begged him to allow the city to celebrate a jubilee every fifty years, and then, as a personal request,&nbsp;asked to be nominated notary to the urban chamber. The&nbsp;pope consented to everything, and Rienzi communicated this&nbsp;good news to Rome in an emphatically worded epistle. After&nbsp;Easter, in 1344, he returned to Rome, and found to his grief&nbsp;that the city was a prey to the nobles. He immediately began&nbsp;to admonish the latter, and then, draped in a toga adorned&nbsp;with symbols, exhibited and explained allegorical designs to&nbsp;the people, and announced the speedy restoration of the&nbsp;past grandeur of Rome. Finally he and a few burghers and&nbsp;merchants, whom he had secretly inflamed by his discourses,&nbsp;made a solemn vow to overthrow the nobility and consolidate the&nbsp;republic. The moment was favourable, owing to the anarchy&nbsp;of Naples, the absence of the pope, the weakness of the empire&nbsp;and the disputes of the barons, although the latter were still&nbsp;very potent and constituted, as it were, a separate government&nbsp;opposed to that of the people. Rienzi, having gained the pope’s&nbsp;ecclesiastical vicar to his side, passed in prayer the night of the&nbsp;19th of May 1347, placing his enterprise under the protection&nbsp;of the Holy Spirit, and the following day marched to the&nbsp;Capitol, surrounded by his adherents, convoked a parliament&nbsp;of the people, and obtained its sanction for the following proposals:—that all pending lawsuits should be at once decided;&nbsp;that justice should be equally administered to all; that every&nbsp;region should equip one hundred foot soldiers and twenty-five&nbsp;horse; that the dues and taxes should be rearranged; that the&nbsp;forts, bridges and gates of the city should be held by the rector&nbsp;of the people instead of by the nobility; and that granaries&nbsp;should be opened for the public use. On the same day, amid&nbsp;general homage and applause, Rienzi was proclaimed head of&nbsp;the republic, with the title of tribune and liberator of the Holy&nbsp;Roman Republic, “ by authority of the most merciful Lord&nbsp;Jesus Christ.” The nobles withdrew scoffing but alarmed.&nbsp;Rienzi engaged a body-guard of one hundred men, and assumed&nbsp;the command of thirteen hundred infantry and three hundred&nbsp;and ninety h’ght horse; he abolished the senators, retained the&nbsp;Thirteen and the general and special councils, and set the&nbsp;administration on a new footing. These measures and the&nbsp;prompt submission of the other cities of the state brought an&nbsp;instant increase of revenue to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This revolution, as will be noted, was of an entirely novel stamp. For its leader despatched envoys to all the cities&nbsp;of Italy, exhorting them to shake off the yoke of their tyrants,&nbsp;and send representatives to the parliament convoked for the&nbsp;1 st of August, inasmuch as the liberation of Rome also implied&nbsp;the “ liberation of the sacred land of Italy.” In Rienzi’s&nbsp;judgment the Roman revolution must be, not municipal, but&nbsp;national, and even in some points universal. And this idea&nbsp;was welcomed with general enthusiasm throughout the peninsula.&nbsp;Solemn festivals and processions were held in Rome; and,&nbsp;when the tribune went in state to St Peter’s, the canons met&nbsp;him on the steps chanting the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Veni, Creator Spiritus.</span><span class="font0"> Even&nbsp;the pope, willingly or unwillingly, accorded his approval to</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
