With great labour he fitted out a fleet, of which the Romans had been long deſtitute. With this he deſigned to paſs over into Africa ; but, it being ſurpriſed and burnt by the enemy, he himſelf was ſoon after murdered by one Ricimer a Goth, who had long governed every thing with an abſolute ſway. After the death of Marjorianus, one Anthemius was raiſed to the empire : but beginning to counteract Ricimer, the latter openly revolted, beſieged and took Rome ; where he committed innumerable cruelties, among the reſt putting to death the unhappy emperor Anthemius, and raiſing one Olybius to the empire. The tranſactions of his reign were very few, as he died ſoon after his acceſſion. On his death, one Glycerius uſurped the empire. He was depoſed in 474, and one Julius Nepos had the name of <hi rend="italic">emperor.</hi>  He was driven out the next year by his general Oreſtes, who cauſed his ſon Auguſtus or Auguſtulus to be proclaimed emperor. But the following year, 476, the barbarians who ſerved in the Roman armies, and were diſtinguiſhed with the title of allies, demanded, as a reward for their ſervices, the third part of the lands in Italy ; pretending, that the whole country, which they had ſo often defended, belonged of right to them. As Oreſtes refuſed to comply with this inſolent demand, they reſolved to do themſelves juſtice, as they called it ; and, openly revolting, choſe one Odoacer for their leader. Odoacer was, according to Ennodius, meanly born, and only a private, man in the guards of the emperor Auguſtulus, when the barbarians revolting, choſe him for their leader. However, he is ſaid to have been a man of uncommon parts, equally capable of commanding an army and governing a ſtate. Having left his own country when he was yet very young, to ſerve in Italy, as he was of</p><p>a ſtature remarkably tall, he was admitted among the emperor’s guards, and continued in that ſtation till the preſent year ; when, putting himſelf at the head of the barbarians in the Roman pay, who, though of different nations, had, with one conſent, choſen him for their leader, he marched againſt Oreſtes and his ſon Auguſtulus, who ſtill refuſed to give them any ſhare of the lands in Italy.</p><p>As the Roman troops were inferior, both in number and valour, to the barbarians, Oreſtes took refuge in Pavia, at that time one of the beſt fortified cities in Italy : but Odoacer, inveſting the place without loſs of time, took it ſoon after by aſſault, gave ſt up to be plundered by the ſoldiers, and then ſet fire to it; which reduced moſt of the houſes, and two churches, to aſhes. Oreſtes was taken priſoner, and brought to Odoacer, who carried him to Placentia, and there cauſed him to be put to death, on the 28th of Auguſt, the day on which he had driven Nepos out of Ravenna, and obliged him to abandon the empire. From Placentia, Odoacer marched ſtraight to Ravenha, where he found Paul, the brother of Oreſtes, and the young emperor Auguſtulus. The former he immediately put to death ; but ſparing Auguſtulus, in conſideration of his youth, he ſtripped him of the enſigns of the imperial dignity, and confined him to Lucullanum, a caſtle in Campania ; where he was, by Odoacer’« orders, treated with great humanity, and allowed an handſome maintenance to ſupport himſelf and his relations. Rome readily ſubmitted to the conqueror, who immediately cauſed</p><lb/><p>himſelſ to be proclaimed king of Italy, but would not aſſume the purple, or any other mark of the imperial dignity. Thus failed the very name of an empire in the Weſt. Britain had been long ſince abandoned by the Romans ; Spain was held by the Goths and Sue-vans ; Africa, by the Vandals ; the Burgundians, Goths, Franks, and Alans, had erected ſeveral te-trarchies in Gaul ; at length Italy itſelf, with its proud metropolis, which for ſo many ages had given law to the reſt of the world, was enilaved by a contemptible barbarian, whoſe family, country, and nation, are not well known to this day.</p><p>From this time, Rome has ceaſed to be the capital of an empire ; the territories of the pope, to whom the city is now ſubject, being inconſiderable. The origin of the pope’s temporal power, and the revolutions of Italy,are related under the article Italy; and a fl&lt;etch of the ſpiritual uſurpations of the popes may be ſeen under the articles History, ſect. ii. and Reformation ; and likewiſe under the various hiſtorical articles as they occur in the courſe of this work.</p><p>It is thought that the walls of modern Rome take in nearly the ſame extent of ground as the ancient ; but the difference between the number of buildings on this ſpot is very great, one half of modern Rome lying waſte, or occupied with gardens, fields, meadows, and vineyards. One may walk quite round the city in three or ſour hours at moſt, the circumference being reckoned about 13 Italian miles. With regard to the number of the inhabitants, modern Rome is alſo greatly inferior to the ancient : for, in 1709, the whole of theſe amounted only to 138,568 ; among which were 40 biſhops, 2686 prieſts, 3559 monks, 1814 nuns, 393 courteſans, about 8000 or 9000 Jews, and 14 Moors. In 1714, the number was increaſed to 143,cco. In external ſplendor, and the beauty of its temples and palaces, modern Rome is thought by the moſt judicious travellers to excel the ancient. There was nothing in ancient Rome to be compared with St Peter’s church in the modern. That Rome was able to recover itſelf after ſo many calamities and devaſtations, will not be matter of ſurpriſe, if we conſider the prodigious ſums that it has ſo long annually drawn from all countries of the Popiſh perſuafion. Theſe ſums, though ſtill conſiderable, have been continually decreaſing ſince the Reformation. The ſurface of the ground on which Rome was originally founded is ſurpriſingly altered. At preſent it is difficult to diſtinguiſh the ſeven hills on which it was firſt built, the low grounds being almoſt filled up with the ruins of the ancient ſtreets and houſes, and the great quantities of earth waſhed down from the hills by the violence of the rains. Anciently the ſuburbs extended a vaſt way on all ſides, and made the city appear almoſt boundleſs ; but it is quite otherwiſe now, the country about Rome being almbſt a deſert. To this and other cauſes it is owing, that the air is none of the moſt wholeſome, eſpecially during the ſummer heats, when few go abroad in the day-time. No city at preſent in the world ſurpaſſes, or indeed equals, Rome, ſor the multiplicity of fine fountains, noble edifices, antiquities, curioſities, paintings, ſtatues, and ſculptures. The city ſtands on the Tiber, 10 miles from the Tuſcan ſea, 380 from Vienna, 560 from Paris, 740 from Amſterdam, 810 from London, and 900 from Madrid. The Tiber is ſubject to fre-</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
