It was invented by Sir W. Skevington, lieutenant of the Tower in the reign of Henry VIII. It consisted of a wide iron hoop which by means of screws was tightened round the victim’s body until the blood was forced from the nose and ears, and sometimes even from the hands and feet.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
