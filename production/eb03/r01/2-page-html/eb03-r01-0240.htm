It was&nbsp;in the poſſeffion of the French, but reſtored to the&nbsp;archbiſhop of Cologne by the treaty of Utrecht. It&nbsp;is ſeated on the Rhine, in E. Long. 6. 39. N. Lat.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RHINEGAU, a beautiful diſtrict of the electorate of Mentz, is ſituated on the Rhine, about three miles&nbsp;from the clty of Mentz, and is fo populous that lt&nbsp;looks like one entire town intermixed with gardens and&nbsp;vineyards. The Rhine here grows aſtoniſhingly wide,&nbsp;and forms a kmd of ſea, near a mſle bioad, in wſuch&nbsp;are ſeveral well wooded little lſiands. I lie Rhmegau&nbsp;forms an amphitheatre, tlie beauties of whicli are beyond all deſeriptlon. At walluf, the very high hills&nbsp;come nearly down to the river ſide ; from thence they&nbsp;recede agam mto tlie country, formmg a kmd of half&nbsp;circle, the otlier end of which is'15 miles off at Rude-ſheim’ θη the banks of the Rhine. ſhe banks of&nbsp;the river, the hills wliicli form the circles, and the&nbsp;ſlopes oſ tlie great mountams, are thick ſown with vil&nbsp;lages and hamlets. The white appearance of the buildings, and the ſine blue ſlated roofs of the houſes playing&nbsp;amidſt the various green of the landſeape, have an admirable effect. In the ſpace of every mile, as you ſail&nbsp;down the river, you meet with a village which in any&nbsp;other place would paſs for a town, blany of the νιί-lages contain from 300 to 400 families ; and there are&nbsp;36 of them in a ſpace of 15 miles long and ſtx miles&nbsp;broad, which ls the width of this heautiful amphitheatre. The declivities of all the hills and mountains&nbsp;are planted thick with vineyards and fruit trees, and&nbsp;the thick wooded tops of the hills caſt a gloomy horror&nbsp;over the otherwiſe cheerful landſeape. Every now and&nbsp;then a row of rugged hills run directly down to the&nbsp;ſhore, and dommeer majcſtically over the leffer hills un-der them. On one of theſe great mountains, juſt about&nbsp;the middle of the Rhinegau, you meet with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Johannis-Berg,</span><span class="font1"> a village which produces ſome of the beſt Rhe-niſm Before this village is a pretty little riling, and&nbsp;near the banks oſ the river there is a very ſine old caſtle,&nbsp;which gives unſpeakable majeſty to the whole landſeape.&nbsp;Indeed, in every village, you meet with ſome or other&nbsp;large building, which contributes very much to the de-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">coration of the whole. This country is indebted for its&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">riches to this ſemicirci/ar hill, which protects it from&nbsp;the cold winds of the eaſt and north, at the ſame time&nbsp;that it leaves room enough for the ſun to exerciſe his&nbsp;benign influences. The groves and higher Hopes of&nbsp;the hills make excellent paſtures, and produce large&nbsp;quantities of dung, which, in a country of this fort, is&nbsp;of ineſtimable value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The bank of the Rhine, oppoſite to tbe Rhinegau, is exceedingly barren, and heightens tbe beauty of the&nbsp;proſpect on the other ſide by the contraſt it exhibits ;&nbsp;on this ſide, you hardly meet above three or four villages,&nbsp;and theſe are ſar diſtant from each other. The great&nbsp;interval between them is occupied by heaths and mea-dows, only here and there a thick buſh affords ſome&nbsp;ſhade, and a few corn fields among the viliages enliven&nbsp;the gloomy landſcape. The back ground of this coun-try is the moſt pictureſque part of it. It is formed by&nbsp;a narrow gullet of mountains, which diminiſh in perſpective between Rudeſheim and Bingen. Perpendicular&nbsp;mountains and rocks hang over the Rhine in this place,&nbsp;and ſeem to make it the dominion of eternal night. At&nbsp;a diſtance, the Rhine ſeems to come out of this land-ſeape through a hole under ground ; and it appears to&nbsp;run tediouſſy, in order to enjoy its courſe through a&nbsp;pleaſant country the longer. Amidſt the darkneſs&nbsp;which covers this back ground, the celebrated Monſe&nbsp;tower ſeems to fwim upon the river. In a word, there&nbsp;is not any thing in this whole tract that does not contribute ſomething to the beauty and magnificence </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">the&nbsp;whole ; or, if I may be permitted the expreffion, to&nbsp;make the paradiſe more welcome. As you ſail along&nbsp;the Rhine, between Mentz and Bingen, the banks ©f&nbsp;the river form an oval amphitheatre, which makes one&nbsp;of the richeſt and moſt pictureſquc landſcapes to be&nbsp;ſeen in Europe. The inhabitants of theſe regions arer&nbsp;ſome of them extremely rich, and ſome extremely poor.&nbsp;The happy middle ſtate is not for countries the chief&nbsp;product of which is wine ; ſor, beſides that the culti-vation of the vineyard is inſinitely more troubleſoma&nbsp;and expenſive than agriculture, it is ſubjected to revolutions, which in an inſtant reduce the holder of land&nbsp;to the condition of a day-labourer. It is a great miſ-fortune for this country, that, though reſtrained by law,,&nbsp;the nobility are, through connivance of the Elector,&nbsp;allowed to purchaſe as much land as they pleaſe. The&nbsp;peaſant generally begins by running in debt for his&nbsp;vineyard ; ſo that if it does not turn out well, he is reduced to day-labour, and the rich man extends his poſ-ſeffions to the great detriment of the conntry. There&nbsp;are ſeveral peaſants here, who having incomes of 30,&nbsp;50, or ιοο,οοο guilders a-year, have laid aſide the pea-ſant, and affumed the wine-merchant ; but, ſplendid as&nbsp;their ſituation is, it does not compenſatb, in the eyes of&nbsp;the humane man, for the ſight of ſo many poor people&nbsp;with which the villages ſwarm. In order to render a&nbsp;country of this kind proſperous, the ſtate ſhould ap-propriate a fund to the purpoſe of maintaining the pea-ſant in bad years, and giving him the aſſiſtance which&nbsp;his neceffities, and his want of ready money, may from&nbsp;time to time make convenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The inhabitants of the Rhinegau are a handſome and uncommonly ſtrong race of men. You ſee at the very&nbsp;ſirſt aſpect that their wine gives them merry hearts and&nbsp;ſound bodies. They have a great deal of natural wit,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and a vivacity and jocoſeneſs, which diſtinguiſhes them</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
