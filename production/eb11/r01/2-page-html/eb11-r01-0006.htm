<p><span class="font0">and the terrible mare. But there is no trace of the action or other characters of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0"> that was to be, nor is the manner&nbsp;of the piece in the least worthy of Rabelais. No one supposes&nbsp;that he wrote it, though it has been supposed that he edited&nbsp;it and that in reality it is older than 1532, and may be the&nbsp;direct subject of Bordigné’s allusion six years earlier. What&nbsp;does, however, seem probable is that the first book of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(the second of the whole work) was composed with a definite&nbsp;view to this chap book and not to the existing first book of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0">, which was written afterwards, when Rabelais dis-covered the popularity of his work and felt that it ought to&nbsp;have some worthier starting-point than the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grandes chroniques.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The earliest known and dated edition of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel</span><span class="font0"> is of 1533,&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0"> 1535, though this would not be of itself conclusive,&nbsp;especially as we actually possess editions of both which, though&nbsp;undated, seem to be earlier. But the definite description of&nbsp;Gargantua in the title as “ Père de Pantagruel, ” the omission&nbsp;of the words “ second livre ” in the title of the first book of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel</span><span class="font0"> while the second and third are duly entitled “ tiers ”&nbsp;and “ quart, ” the remarkable fact that one of the most important personages, Friar John, is absent from book ii., the&nbsp;first of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel</span><span class="font0">, though he appears in book i. (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and many other proofs show the order of publication clearly&nbsp;enough. There is also in existence a letter of Calvin, dated&nbsp;1533, in which he speaks of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel,</span><span class="font0"> but not of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">as having been condemned as an obscene book. Besides this,&nbsp;1533 saw the publication of an almanac, the first of a long&nbsp;series which exists only in titles and fragments, and of the&nbsp;amusing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prognostication Pantagrueline</span><span class="font0"> (still, be it observed,&nbsp;Pantagrueline, not Gargantuine). Both this and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">itself were published under the anagrammatic pseudonym&nbsp;of “ Alcofribas Nasier, ” shortened to the first word only in&nbsp;the case of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prognostication.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This busy and interesting period of Rabelais’s life was brought to a close apparently by his introduction or reintroduction to Jean du Bellay, who, in October 1533, passing through Lyons&nbsp;on an embassy to Rome, engaged Rabelais as physician. The&nbsp;visit did not last very long, but it left literary results in an&nbsp;edition of a description of Rome by Marliani, which Rabelais&nbsp;published in September 1534. It is also thought that the&nbsp;first edition of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0"> may have appeared this year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the spring of 1535 the authorities of the Lyons hospital, considering that Rabelais had twice absented himself without&nbsp;leave, elected Pierre de Castel in his room; but the documents&nbsp;which exist do not seem to infer that any blame was thought&nbsp;due to him, and the appointment of his successor was once&nbsp;definitely postponed in case he should return. At the end&nbsp;of 1535 Rabelais once more accompanied Jean du Bellay,&nbsp;now a cardinal, to Rome and stayed there till April in the&nbsp;next year. This stay furnishes some biographical documents&nbsp;of importance in the shape of letters to Geoffroy d’Estissac,&nbsp;of the already-mentioned </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Supplicatio pro Apostasia,</span><span class="font0"> and of&nbsp;the bull of absolution which was the reply to it. This bull&nbsp;not only freed Rabelais from ecclesiastical censure, but gave&nbsp;him the right to return to the order of St Benedict when he&nbsp;chose, and to practise medicine. He took advantage of this&nbsp;bull and became a canon of St Maur. In 1537 he took his&nbsp;doctor’s degree at Montpellier, lectured on the Greek text&nbsp;of Hippocrates, and next year made a public anatomical&nbsp;demonstration. During these two years he seems to have&nbsp;resided either at Montpellier or at Lyons. But in 1539 he&nbsp;entered the service of Guillaume du Bellay-Langey, elder&nbsp;brother of Jean, and would appear to have been with him&nbsp;(he was governor of Piedmont) till his death on 9th January&nbsp;1543. Rabelais wrote a panegyrical memoir of Guillaume,&nbsp;which is lost, and the year before saw the publication of an&nbsp;edition of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel,</span><span class="font0"> book i., together (both had&nbsp;been repeatedly reprinted separately), in which some dangerous&nbsp;expressions were cut away. Nothing at all is known of his&nbsp; life, whereabouts, or occupations till the publication of the&nbsp;third book, which appeared in 1546, “avec privilége du roi, ”&nbsp;which had been given in September 1545.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Up to this time Rabelais, despite the condemnation of the Sorbonne referred to above, had experienced nothing like&nbsp;persecution or difficulty. Even the spiteful or treacherous&nbsp;act of Dolet, who in 1542 reprinted the earlier form of the&nbsp;books which Rabelais had just slightly modified, seems to have&nbsp;done him no harm. But the storm of persecution which&nbsp;towards the end of the reign of Francis I. was fatal to Dolet&nbsp;himself and to Des Périers, while it exiled and virtually killed&nbsp;Marot, threatened him. There is no positive evidence of any&nbsp;measures taken or threatened against him; but it is certain&nbsp;that he passed nearly the whole of 1546 and part of 1547 at&nbsp;Metz in Lorraine as physician to the town at the salary of&nbsp;120 livres, and Sturm speaks of him as having been “cast&nbsp;out of France by the times ” (with the exclamation </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ϕϵυ</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">τωv&nbsp;χρόνων)</span><span class="font0"> in a contemporary letter, and says that he himself in&nbsp;another letter gives a doleful account of his pecuniary affairs&nbsp;and asks for assistance. At Francis’s death on 31st March&nbsp;1547 Du Bellay went to Rome, and at some time not certain&nbsp;Rabelais joined him. He was certainly there in February 1549,&nbsp;when he dates from Du Bellay’s palace a little account of the&nbsp;festivals given at Rome to celebrate the birth of the second&nbsp;son of Henry II. and Catherine de’ Medici. This account,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sciomachie</span><span class="font0"> as it is called, is extant. In the same year a&nbsp;monk of Fontevrault, Gabriel du Puits-Herbault, made in a&nbsp;book called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Theotimus</span><span class="font0"> the first of the many attacks on Rabelais.&nbsp;It is, however, as vague as it is violent, and it does not seem&nbsp;to have had any effect. Rabelais had indeed again made for&nbsp;himself protectors whom no clerical or Sorbonist jealousy could&nbsp;touch. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sciomachie</span><span class="font0"> was written to the cardinal of Guise,&nbsp;whose family were all-powerful at court, and Rabelais dedicated&nbsp;his next book to Odet de Chatillon, afterwards cardinal, a man&nbsp;of great influence. Thus Rabelais was able to return to France,&nbsp;and in 1550 was presented to the livings of Meudon and St&nbsp;Christophe de Jambet. It may, however, surprise those who&nbsp;have been accustomed to hear him spoken of as “ curé de&nbsp;Meudon, ” and who have read lives of him founded on legend,&nbsp;to find that there is very little ground for believing that he&nbsp;ever officiated or resided there. He certainly held the living&nbsp;but two years, resigning it in January 1552 along with his other&nbsp;benefice, and it is noteworthy that at the episcopal visitation&nbsp;of 1551 he was not present. To this supposed residence at&nbsp;Meudon and to the previous stay at Rome, however, are&nbsp;attached two of the most mischievous items of the legend,&nbsp;though fortunately two of the most easily refutable. It is&nbsp;said that Rabelais met and quarrelled with Joachim du Bellay&nbsp;the poet at Rome, and with Ronsard at Meudon and elsewhere,&nbsp;that this caused a breach between him and the Pléiade, that he&nbsp;satirized its classicizing tendencies in the episode of the Limousin&nbsp;scholar, and that Ronsard after his death avenged himself&nbsp;by a libellous epitaph. The facts are these. Nothing is&nbsp;heard of the quarrel with Du Bellay or of any meeting with&nbsp;him, nothing of the meetings and bickerings with Ronsard,&nbsp;till 1697, when Bernier tells the story without any authority.&nbsp;The supposed allusions to the Pléiade date from a time when&nbsp;Ronsard was a small boy, and are mainly borrowed from an&nbsp;earlier writer still, Geoffroy Tory. Lastly, the epitaph, read&nbsp;impartially, is not libellous at all, but simply takes up the&nbsp;vein of the opening scenes of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0"> in reference to&nbsp;Gargantua’s author. There is indeed no reason to suppose&nbsp;that either Ronsard or Du Bellay was a fervent admirer of&nbsp;Rabelais, for they belonged to a very different literary school;&nbsp;but there is absolutely no evidence of any enmity between them,&nbsp;and Du Bellay actually refers to Rabelais with admiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some chapters of Rabelais’s fourth book had been published in 1548, but the whole did not appear till 1552. The Sorbonne&nbsp;censured it and the parliament suspended the sale, taking&nbsp;advantage of the king’s absence from Paris. But it was soon&nbsp;relieved of the suspension. He died, it is said, on the 9th of&nbsp;April 1553, but actual history is quite silent save on the point&nbsp;that he was not alive in May of the next year, and the legends&nbsp;about his deathbed utterances—“ La farce est jouée, ” “ Je&nbsp;vais chercher un grand peut-être, ” &amp;c. — are altogether</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
