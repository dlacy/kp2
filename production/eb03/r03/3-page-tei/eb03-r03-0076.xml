Several other expedients have been adopted, which I ſhall not mention here, as the ſame defects equally appear in all.</p><p>“ Thus it was apparent, that ample room was left for the diſcovery of ſome more certain reſource than any of the former ; and the ſcheme which has ſuggeſted itſelf to me, will, I truſt, be found fully to anſwer the purpoſe intended.

His father James Ruddiman was a farmer, and ſtrongly attached to the houſe of Stuart.</p><p>Mr Ruddiman was inſtructed in the principles oſ Latin grammar at the pariſh-ſchool of Boyndie, where his application was fo vigorous, and his progreſs ſo rapid, that he quickly ſurpaſſed all his claſs-fellows. Hi« maſter George Moriſon, who was a ſkilful and attentive teacher, being unwilling to check his ardour for learning, permitted him to follow the impulſe oſ his genius, •and to advance without waiting the flow progreſs of the other boys.</p><p>The pleaſure which the youthful mind receives from vivid deſcription, though wild and romantic, approaches to ecſtacy, and often makes an impreſſion which remains indelible. While at ſchool, the firſt book which charmed the opening mind of Ruddiman was Ovid’s Meta-morphoſes ; nor did he ceaſe to reliſh the beauties of this author when his judgment was mature, for during the reſt of his life Ovid was his favourite poet.</p><p>At the age of ſixteen he became anxious to purſue his ſtudies at the univerſity ; but his father thinking him too young, oppoſed his inclination. Hearing of the competition trial, which was annually held at King’s College, Aberdeen, for a certain number of burſaries on the foundation of that univerſity, Ruddiman’s ambition was kindled. Without the knowledge of luε father, and with only a ſingle guinea in his pocket, which his fiſter had privately given him, he ſet out ſor that place. On the road he was met by a company of gypſeys, who robbed him of his coat, his ſhoes, his ſtcckings, and his guinea. This misfortune did not damp his en-terpriſing ſpirit : He continued his journey to Aberdeen, preſented himſelf before the profeffors as a candidate ; and though he had neither clothes to give him a decent appearance nor friendβ to recommend him, he gained the firſt prize.</p><p>After attending the univerſity four years, he obtained the degree of maſter of arts ; an honour of which he was always proud. The theſis ſays, the diſputation on this occaſion laſted <hi rend="italic">ab </hi><hi rend="italic">aurora uſque ad ve/perum,</hi>  i. e,</p><p>ſrom morning till night.” Tho’ Ruddiman was only twenty year« of age when he left the university, it ap. pears from a book intitled <hi rend="italic">Rhetomcorum Libri très,</hi>  com-poſed before this period, but never publiſhed, that he had then read the Roman claſſics with uncommon attention and advantage.</p><p>He was. ſoon after engaged as a tutor to the ſon of Robert Young, Eſq; of Auldbar, the great grandſon of Sir Peter Young, who under the direction of Buchanan had been preceptor of James Vi. His income here muſt have been very ſmall, or his ſituation unplea-ſant ; for within a year be accepted the office of ſchoolmaſter in the pariſh of Laurence-kirk The proſeſſion of ſchoolmaſter in a country-pariſh at that period could, open no field ſor ambition, nor proſpect of great emolument; for by an act of parliament paſſed in 1633<hi rend="sub">t </hi>the ſalary appropriated to this office could not be increaſed above 200 merks Scots, or L. 1 1 : 2 : 2∣∙ Sterling. In diſcharging the duties of this humble but important ſtation, it is probable that he uſed Simfon<hi rend="sup">,</hi>⅜ <hi rend="italic">Rudimenta Grammati&lt;a,</hi>  which was then generally taught in the northern ſchools, and by which he himſelf had been inſtructed in the principles of Latin grammar.</p><p>When Ruddiman had ſpent three years and a half in this employment, the celebrated Dr Pitcairne happening to paſs through Laurence-kirk, was detained in that village by a violent ſtorm. Pitcairne wanting amuſement, inquired at the hoſteſs if ſhe could procure any agreeable companion to bear him company at dinner. She replied, that the ſchoolmaſter, though young, was ſaid to be learned, and, though modeſt, ſhe waδ fore could talk. Pitcairne was delighted with the con-verſation and learning of his new companion, invited him to Edinburgh, and promiſed him his patronage.</p><p>When Ruddiman arrived in Edinburgh, the advocates library, which had been founded eighteen years before by Sir George Mackenzie, attracted his curio-ſity and attention, and he was ſoon after appointed aſ-ſiſtant-keeper under Mr Spottiſwoode the principal librarian. His ſalary for executing this laborious office was L. 8 : 6 : 8. He had befides a ſmall honorary preſent from thoſe who were admitted advocates for correcting their theſes : he was alſo paid ſor copying manuſcripts for the uſe of the library. And the faculty, before hc had held the office two years, were ſo highly pleaſed with his conduct, that they made him a preſent of 50 pounds Scots, or L. 4 : 3 : 4 Sterling.</p><p>During the fitting of the court of ſeſſion he attended the library from ten till three. But this confinement did not prevent him from engaging in other laborious duties : A part of his time was occupied in teaching young gentlemen the Latin language. Some he attended at their lodgings, ſome waited upon him, and ſome reſided in his own houſe. An exact lift of the names of thoſe who attended him, expreſſing the date of their entry, and the ſums which he was to receive from each, has been found in his pocket-book ; a curious relick, which is ſtill preſerved.</p><p>When Ruddiman’s merit as ä ſeholar became better known, his aſſiſtance was anxiouſly ſolicited by thoſe who were engaged in literary publications. Freebairne, a reſpectable bookſeller of that period, prevailed upon him to correct and prepare , for the preſs Sir Robert Sibbald’s <hi rend="italic">Introduttio ad hi/loriam rerum a Romanis gejla-</hi><hi rend="italic">rum in eα Borealis Britannia </hi><hi rend="italic">parte qua ultra murum</hi></p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
