<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROBERT IIL </span><span class="font1">(c. 1340-1406), king of Scotland, was the eldest son of King Robert II. by his mistress, Elizabeth Mure,&nbsp;and was legitimatized when his parents were married about&nbsp;1349. In 1368 he was created earl of Carrick, and he took&nbsp;somepart in the government of the kingdom until about 1387,&nbsp;when he was disabled by the kick of a horse. It was probably&nbsp;in consequence of this accident that his brother Robert, earl&nbsp;of Fife, and not the crown prince himself, was made guardian&nbsp;of the kingdom in 1389; but the latter succeeded to the throne&nbsp;on his father’s death in May 1390. At this time he changed&nbsp;his baptismal name of John, which was unpopular owing to&nbsp;its connexion with John de Bahol, for that of Robert, being&nbsp;crowned at Scone in August 1390 as King Robert III. Although he probably attended several parliaments the new&nbsp;king was only the nominal ruler of Scotland, the real power&nbsp;being in the hands of his brother, the earl of Fife. In 1399,&nbsp;however, owing to the king’s “ sickness of the body,” his elder&nbsp;son, David, duke of Rothesay, was appointed Ueutenant of the&nbsp;kingdom; but this event was followed by an EngUsh invasion&nbsp;of Scotland, by serious differences between Rothesay and his&nbsp;uncle, Robert, now duke of Albany, and finally in March 1402&nbsp;by Rothesay’s. mysterious death at Falkland. Early in 1406&nbsp;the king’s only surviving son, afterwards King James I., was&nbsp;captured by the EngUsh; and on the 4th of April 1406 Robert&nbsp;died, probably at Rothesay, and was buried at Paisley. He&nbsp;married AnnabeUa Drummond (c. 1350-1402), daughter of&nbsp;Sir John Drummond of StobhaU, and, in addition to the two&nbsp;sons already mentioned, had four daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROBERT I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(o'</span><span class="font1"> 865-923), king of France, or king of the Franks, was the younger son of Robert the Strong, count&nbsp;of Anjou, and the brother of Odo, or Eudes, who became king&nbsp;of the western Franks in 888. Appointed by Odo ruler of&nbsp;several .counties, including the county of Paris, and abbot </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;Commendam</span><span class="font1"> of many abbeys, Robert also secured the office&nbsp;of duke of the Franks, a miUtary dignity of high importance.&nbsp;He did not claim the crown of France when his brother died&nbsp;in 898; but recognizing the supremacy of the Carolingian&nbsp;king, Charles III., the Simple, he was confirmed in his offices&nbsp;and possessions, after which he continued to defend northern&nbsp;France from the attacks of the Normans. The peace between&nbsp;the king and his powerful vassal was not seriously disturbed&nbsp;until about 921. The rule of Charles, and especiaUy his partiality for a certain IIagano, had aroused some irritation;&nbsp;and, supported by many of the clergy and by some of the most&nbsp;powerful of the Frankish nobles, Robert took up arms, drove&nbsp;Charles into Lorraine, and was himself crowned king of the&nbsp;Franks at Reims on the 29th of June 922. CoUectingan army,&nbsp;Charles marched against the usurper, and on the 15th of June&nbsp;923, in a stubborn and sanguinary battle near Soissons, Robert&nbsp;was kiUed, according to one tradition in single combat with&nbsp;his rival. Robert left a son. Hugh the Great, duke of the&nbsp;Franks, and his grandson was Hugh Capet, king of France.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROBERT H. </span><span class="font1">(c. 970-ro3r), king of France, was a son of Hugh Capet, and was born at Orleans. Hewas educated at&nbsp;Reims under Gerbert, afterwards Pope SUvester II. As the&nbsp;ideal of medieval Christianity he won his surname of “ Pious ”&nbsp;by his humility and charity, but he also possessed some of the&nbsp;quaUtics of a soldier and a statesman. His father associated&nbsp;him with himself in the government of France, and he was&nbsp;crowned in December 987, becoming sole king on Hugh’s&nbsp;death in October 996. Robert’s reign is chiefly remembered&nbsp;for its dramatic side. In 988 he had married Rosala, or&nbsp;Susanna, widow of Arnold IL, count of Flanders. This lady,&nbsp;however, was much older than Robert, who repudiated her&nbsp;in 989, fixing his affections upon Bertha, daughter of Conrad&nbsp;the Peaceful, king of Burgundy, or Arles, and wife of Eudes L,&nbsp;count of Blois; and although the pair were related, and the&nbsp;king had been godfather to one of Bertha’s children, they were&nbsp;married in 996, a year after the death of Eudes. Pope Gregory&nbsp;V., whose favour Robert vainly sought to win by allowing&nbsp;Arnulf, the imprisoned archbishop, to return to his see of&nbsp;Reims and forcing Gcrbert to flee to the court of the emperor&nbsp;Otto III., excommunicated the king, and a council at Rome&nbsp;imposed a seven years’ penance upon him. For five years&nbsp;the king braved aU anathemas, but about 1002 he gave up&nbsp;Bertha and married Constance, daughter of a certain Count&nbsp;WiUiam, an intriguing and ambitious woman, who made life&nbsp;miserable for her husband, while the court was disturbed by&nbsp;quarrels between the partisans of the two queens. Still&nbsp;attached to Bertha, Robert took this lady with him to Rome&nbsp;in roro, but the pope refused to recognize their marriage, and&nbsp;the king was forced to return to Constance. By this wife&nbsp;Robert had four sons, and in 1017, the eldest of these, Hugh,&nbsp;(roo7~ro25), was crowned as his father’s coUeaguc and successor.&nbsp;After Hugh’s death the king procured the coronation of his&nbsp;second son, Henry, duke of Burgundy, afterwards king of&nbsp;France, a proceeding which displeased Constance, who wished&nbsp;her third son, Robert (d. 1075), afterwards duke of Burgundy,&nbsp;to receive the crown. Robert’s concluding days were troubled&nbsp;by a rising on the part of these two sons, and after a short war,&nbsp;in which he was worsted, the king died at Melun on the 20th&nbsp;of July i03r. The notable gain to France during this reign&nbsp;was the duchy of Burgundy, which Robert claimed on the&nbsp;death of his uncle, Duke Henry, in ioor. The other daimant,&nbsp;however, Otto WUliam, count of upper Burgundy, or Franche&nbsp;Comté, offered so stubborn a resistance that it was not until&nbsp;roi5 that the king secured the duchy, which he gave as an&nbsp;apanage to his son Henry. Nevertheless, Robert himself kept&nbsp;a close oversight over its government, and this was one reason&nbsp;which led to the revolt of .his sons in r030. Owring to family&nbsp;quarrels, he could not prevent the kingdom of Burgundy, or&nbsp;Arles, from passing into the hands of the emperor Conrad II.,&nbsp;and no serious results followed his interference in Flanders&nbsp;or in Lorraine. Robert added to the royal domains, and was&nbsp;greatly aided by the support of Richard II. and Richard III.,&nbsp;dukes of Normandy, the latter of whom was his son-in-law.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROBERT (1275-1343), king of Naples, was the son of Charles IL, duke of Anjou and king of Naples, and in his youth took&nbsp;part in several expeditions to Sicily with the object of wresting&nbsp;the island from Frederick III. of Aragon. But his efforts,&nbsp;like those of his father and grandfather, proved fruitless, and&nbsp;the Angevins were compelled at last to agree to the peace of&nbsp;CaltabeUotta (1302). On the death of Charles in 1309 Robert&nbsp;succeeded to the throne, although his nephew Caroberto (Carlo&nbsp;Roberto), son of his elder brother Charles Martel, who had&nbsp;died before his father, had a prior claim. Hewas crotvned by&nbsp;Pope Clement V. at Avignon, and on the descent into Italy&nbsp;of the emperor Henry VII. was appointed papal vicar in&nbsp;Romagna to resist the imperiaUsts; thenceforth he became&nbsp;the recognized leader of the Guelphs or papal faction in Italy&nbsp;and took part in aU the wars against the GhibelUnes. On various&nbsp;occasions he obtained for himself or his sons the suzerainty&nbsp;over Rome, Florence, and other cities, and was regarded as&nbsp;the most powerful Italian prince of his day. Pope John XXIL&nbsp;created him papal vicar in Italy against the emperor Louis&nbsp;the Bavarian. In r32o Robert summoned his kinsman PhiUpV.&nbsp;of France to Italy, and he waged war against Sicily once more&nbsp;from 1325 to rj4r, but failed to drive out the Aragonese.
