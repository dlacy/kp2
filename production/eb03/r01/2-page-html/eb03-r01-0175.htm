<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">years. The </span><span class="font1">tenant muſt alſo be made liable to be puniſhed for committing waſte ; and the uſual rent&nbsp;muſt be reſerved, or, where there has uſually been no&nbsp;rent, one-third of the clear yearly value. The misfor-'tune is, that this act was made too late, after almoſt&nbsp;every valuable poffeffion of the crown had been granted&nbsp;away for ever, or elfe upon very long leafes ; but may&nbsp;be of benefit to poſterity, when thoſe leaſes come to&nbsp;expire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">6. Hither might have been referred the advantages which were uſed to ariſe to the king from the profits&nbsp;of his military tenures, to which moſt lands in the&nbsp;kingdom were ſubject, till the ſtatute 12 Car. II. c. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">24.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which in great meaſure aboliſhed them all. Hither al-ſo might have been referred the profitable prerogative&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">purveyance and pre-emption : which was a right en-joyed by the crown of buying up proviſions and other&nbsp;fteceſſaries, by the intervention of the king’s purveyors,&nbsp;for the uſe of his royal houſehold, at an appraiſed va-luation, in preference to all others, and even without&nbsp;conſent of the owner : and alſo of forcibly impreſſing&nbsp;the carriages and horſes of the ſubject, to do the king’s&nbsp;buſinefs on the public roads, in the conveyance of tim-ber, baggage, and the like, however inconvenient to&nbsp;the proprietor, upon paying him a fettled price. A&nbsp;prerogative which prevailed pretty generally thrβugh-out Europe during the ſcarcity of gold and filver, and&nbsp;the high valuation of money confequential thereupon.&nbsp;In thoſe early times, the king’s houſehold (as well as&nbsp;thoſe of inferior lords) were ſupported by fpecific ren-ders of corn, and other victuals, from the tenants of&nbsp;the reſpective demeſnes; and there was alſo a continual&nbsp;market kept at the palace-gate to furniſh viands for&nbsp;the royal ufe. And this anſwered allpurpoſes, in thoſe&nbsp;ages of ſimplicity, fo long as the king’s court conti-nued in any certain place. But when it removed from&nbsp;one part of the kingdom to another (as was formerly&nbsp;very frequently done), it was found neceſſary to fend&nbsp;purveyors beforehand, to get together a ſufficient quantity of proviſions and other neceſſaries for the houſehold: and, leſt the unuſual demand ſhould raiſe them to&nbsp;an exorbitant price, the powers beforementioned were&nbsp;veſted in 'theſe purveyors ; who in proceſs of time very&nbsp;greatly abuſed their authority, and became a great oppreſſion to the ſubject, though of little advantage to&nbsp;the crown ; ready money in open market (when the&nbsp;royal reſidence was more permanent, and fpecie began&nbsp;to be plenty) being found upon experience to be the&nbsp;beſt proveditor of any. wherefore, by degrees, the&nbsp;powers of purveyance have declined, in foreign coun-tries as well as our own : and particularly were aboliſh-ed in Sweden by Guſtavus Adolphus, towards the be-ginningof the laſt century. And, with us in England,&nbsp;having fallen into diſuſe during the fuſpenſion of monarchy, King Charles, at his refloration, conſented, by&nbsp;the lame ſtatute, to reſign entirely thoſe branches of&nbsp;his revenue and power: and tb.e parliament, in part of&nbsp;recompenfe, fettled on him, his heirs, and ſucceſſcrs,&nbsp;for ever, the hereditary exciſe of 15d. per barrel on all&nbsp;beer and ale fold in the kingdom, and a proportionable&nbsp;ſum for certain Other liquors. So that this hereditary&nbsp;txcife now forms the ſixth branch of his majeſty’s or-dinary revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">7. A ſeventh branch might alſo be computed </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to have</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">arifen from wine-Iicences ; or the rents payable to the crown by ſuch perfems.as are licenſed to fell wine by&nbsp;retail throughout Britain, except in a few privileged&nbsp;places. Thefe were firſt fettled on the crown by die&nbsp;ſtatute 12 Car. II. c. 25. and, together with the hereditary exciſe, made up the equivalent in value for the&nbsp;loſs ſuſtaſhed by the prerogative in the abolition of the&nbsp;military tenures, and the right of pre-emption and&nbsp;purveyance : but this revenue was aboliſhed by the ſta-tute 30 Geo. II. c. 19∙ and an annual ſum of upwards&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">L. </span><span class="font1">7000 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per annum,</span><span class="font1"> iſſuing out of the ncw ſtamo-duties impofed on wine-licences, was fettled on the&nbsp;crown in its ſtead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An eighth branch of the king’s ordinary revenus&nbsp;is uſually reckoned to conſiſt in the profits ariſing ſrom&nbsp;his foreſts. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Forest.</span><span class="font1"> Theſe conſiſt principally&nbsp;in the amercements or fines levied for offences againſt&nbsp;the foreſhlaws. But as few, if any, courts of this kind&nbsp;for levying amercements have been held fince 1632,&nbsp;8 Char. I. and as, from the accounts given of the pro-ceedings in that court by our hiſtories and law-books,&nbsp;nobody would wiſh to ſee them again revived, it is need-leſs to purſue this inquiry any farther.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The profits ariſing from the king’s ordinary courts&nbsp;of juſtice make a ninth branch of his revenue. And&nbsp;theſe conſiſt not only in fines impoſed upon offenders,&nbsp;forfeitures of recognizances, and amercements levied&nbsp;upon defaulters ; but alſo in certain fees due to the&nbsp;crown in a variety of legal matters, as, for ſetting the&nbsp;great feal to charters, original writs, and other forenſic&nbsp;proceedings, and for permitting fines to be levied of&nbsp;lands in order to bar entails, or otherwiſe to inſure&nbsp;their title. . As none of thefe can be done without the&nbsp;immediate intervention of the king, by himſelf or his&nbsp;officers, the law allows him certain perquiſites and pro-fits, as a recompenfe for the trouble he undertakes for&nbsp;tlie public. Theſe, in proceſs of time, have been al-moſt all granted out to private perſons, or elſe appropriated to certain particular ufes : ſo that, thouoſh&nbsp;our law proceedings are ſtill loaded with their pΓy-ment, very little of them is now returned into the&nbsp;king s exchequer ; for a part of whofe royal maintenance they were originally intended. All future grants&nbsp;of them, however, by the ſtatute 1 Ann. ft. 2. c. 7.&nbsp;are to endure for no longer time than the prince’s life&nbsp;who grants them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tenth branch of the king's ordinary revenue,&nbsp;ſaid to be grounded on the conſideration of his guard,&nbsp;ing and protecting the feas. from pirates and robbers,&nbsp;is the right to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">royalfifih,</span><span class="font1"> which are whale andſturgeon:&nbsp;and theſe, when either thrown aſhore, or caught near&nbsp;the coaſts, are the property of the king, on account&nbsp;of their fuperior excellence. Indeed, our anceſtors&nbsp;feem to have entertained a very high notion of the im-portance of this right ; it being the prerogative of&nbsp;the kings of Denmark and the dukes of Normandy j&nbsp;and from one of theſe it was probably derived to our&nbsp;princes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another maritime revenue, and founded partly&nbsp;upon the ſame reaſon, is that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">shipwrecks.</span><span class="font1"> See&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">wreck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A twelfth branch of the royal revenue, the right&nbsp;to mines, has its original from the king’s prerogative&nbsp;of coinage, in order to ſupply </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">him with materials ; and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
