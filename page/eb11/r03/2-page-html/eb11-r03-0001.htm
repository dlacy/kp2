        <p><span class="font1">in China, he also devoted much time to answering the letters of the
                priests under him, a matter on which he spared no pains&nbsp;or detail. New converts
                had to be attended to—always&nbsp;welcomed, and never hustled away. Besides these
                came the&nbsp;composition of his Chinese books, the teaching of his people
                and&nbsp;the maintenance of the record of the mission history which had&nbsp;been
                enjoined upon him by the general of the order, and which&nbsp;he kept well up to
                date. Thus his labours were wearing and&nbsp;incessant. In May 1610 he broke down,
                and after an illness&nbsp;of eight days died on the nth of that month. His
                colleague&nbsp;Pantoja applied to the emperor for a burying-place outside
                the&nbsp;city. This was granted, with the most honourable official&nbsp;testimonies
                to the reputation and character of Ricci; and a&nbsp;large building in the
                neighbourhood of the city was at the same&nbsp;time bestowed upon the mission for
                their residence.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Ricci’s work was the foundation of the subsequent success attained by
                the Roman Catholic Church in China. When the&nbsp;missionaries of other Roman
                Catholic orders made their way&nbsp;into China, twenty years later, they found great
                fault with the&nbsp;manner in which certain Chinese practices had been dealt
                with&nbsp;by the Jesuits, a matter in which Ricci's action and policy had&nbsp;given
                the tone to the mission in China—though in fact that tone&nbsp;was rather inherent
                in the Jesuit system than the outcome of&nbsp;individual character, for
                controversies of an exactly parallel&nbsp;nature arose two generations later in
                southern India, between&nbsp;the Jesuits and Capuchins, regarding what were called “
                Malabar&nbsp;rites.” The controversy thus kindled in China burned
                for&nbsp;considerably more than a century with great fierceness.@@<sup>1</sup>
                The&nbsp;chief points were (1) the lawfulness and expediency of certain&nbsp;terms
                employed by the Jesuits in naming God Almighty, such as&nbsp;</span><span

                on which these&nbsp;terms were made use of;@@<sup>2</sup> (2) in respect to the
                ceremonial&nbsp;offerings made in honour of Confucius, and of personal
                ancestors,&nbsp;which Ricci had recognized as merely “ civil ” observances;&nbsp;(3)
                the erection of tablets in honour of ancestors in private&nbsp;houses; and (4), more
                generally sanction and favour accorded&nbsp;to ancient Chinese sacred books and

        <p><span class="font1">Some of the characteristics thus indicated may have suggested the
                bitterness of attacks afterwards made upon Ricci’s theology.&nbsp;An example of
                these is found in the work called </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Anecdotes sur&nbsp;Vêlai de religion dans la
                Chine</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1733-35), the author of&nbsp;which (Abbé
                Villers) speaks of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >T’icn-chu shih-i</span><span class="font1"> in this&nbsp;fashion: “The Jesuit was
                also so ill versed in the particulars&nbsp;of the faith that, as the holy bishop of
                Conon, Monsgr. Maigrot,&nbsp;says of him, one need merely read his book on the true
                religion&nbsp;to convince oneself that he had never imbibed the first
                elements&nbsp;of theology.” . . .</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Ricci’s pointed attacks on Buddhism, and the wide circulation of his
                books, called forth the opposition of the Buddhist clergy.&nbsp;One of the ablest
                who took their part was Chu-hang, a priest of&nbsp;Hang-chow, who had abandoned the
                literary status for the&nbsp;Buddhist cloister. He wrote three articles against the
                doctrine&nbsp;of the missionaries. These were brought to Ricci’s notice in
                an&nbsp;ostensible tone of candour by Yu-chim-he, a high mandarin at&nbsp;the
                capital. This letter, with Ricci’s reply, the three Buddhist&nbsp;declamations and
                Ricci’s confutation, were published in a&nbsp;collected form by the Christian
                Sen-Kwang-K’e.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Another work of Ricci’s which attracted attention was the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hsi-kuo fa,</span><span
                class="font1"> or “ Art of Memory as practised in the West.” Ricd&nbsp;was himself a

                the detailed&nbsp;history of the mission was drawn out by him, which after
                his&nbsp;death was brought home by P. Nicolas Trigault, and published&nbsp;at
                Augsburg, and later in a complete form at Lyons under the&nbsp;name </span><span

                centre of the world&nbsp;like the gem in a ring. Ricci, seeing their
                dissatisfaction, set&nbsp;about constructing a map of the hemisphere on a great
