<p><span class="font1">them at the proper time, he was unable to restrain others from making use of them. Engaging next in the manufacture of&nbsp;iron, he in 1760 established the ironworks which still exist at&nbsp;Carron, in Stirlingshire. There he introduced various improvements in the methods of production, including the conversion&nbsp;(patented in 1762) of cast iron into malleable iron “ by the action&nbsp;of a hollow pit-coal fire ” urged by a powerful artificial blast.&nbsp;His next enterprise was less successful. He leased a colliery&nbsp;at Bo’ness to supply coal to the Carron works, but in sinking&nbsp;for new seams encountered such quantities of water that the&nbsp;Newcomen engine which he used was unable to keep the pit&nbsp;clear. In this difficulty he heard of James Watt’s engine and&nbsp;entered into communication with its inventor. This engine,&nbsp;then at an early stage of its development, also proved inadequate, but Roebuck became a strong believer in its future&nbsp;and in return for a two-thirds share in the invention assisted&nbsp;Watt in perfecting its details. His troubles at the colliery,&nbsp;however, aggravated by the failure of an attempt to manufacture alkali, brought him into pecuniary straits, and he&nbsp;parted with his share in Watt’s engine to Matthew Boulton&nbsp;in return for the cancellation of a debt of £1200 which he owed&nbsp;the latter. Subsequently, though he had to give up his interest&nbsp;in the Bo’ness works, he continued to manage them and to&nbsp;reside at the neighbouring Kinneil House, where he occupied&nbsp;himself with farming on a considerable scale. He died on the&nbsp;17th of July 1794.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROEBUCK, JOHN ARTHUR (1801-1879), British politician, was born at Madras on the 28th of December 1801. After the&nbsp;death of his father, a civil servant, his mother’s second marriage&nbsp;transferred him to Canada, where he was chiefly brought up.&nbsp;He came to England in 1824, was called to the bar (Q.C. 1843),&nbsp;became intimate with the leading radical and utilitarian reformers, was elected M.P. for Bath in 1832, and took up that&nbsp;general attitude of hostility to the government of the day, be&nbsp;it what it might, which he retained throughout his life. At&nbsp;all times conspicuous for his eloquence, honesty and recalcitrancy, he twice came with especial prominence before the&nbsp;public—in 1838, when, although at the time without a seat in&nbsp;parliament, he appeared at the bar of the Commons to protest,&nbsp;in the name of the Canadian Assembly, against the suspension&nbsp;of the Canadian constitution; and in 1855, when, having overthrown Lord Aberdeen’s ministry by carrying a resolution for&nbsp;the appointment of a committee of inquiry into the mismanagement in the Crimean War, he presided over its proceedings.&nbsp;In his latter years his political opinions became greatly modified,&nbsp;but with one interruption he retained his seat for Sheffield,&nbsp;which he had won in 1849, until his death in London on the&nbsp;30th of November 1879.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROE-BUCK, the smallest of the British deer (a full-grown buck standing not more than 27 in. high at the shoulder),&nbsp;the typical representative of a genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Capreolus)</span><span class="font1"> in which the&nbsp;antlers lack a brow-tine and belong to what is characterized&nbsp;as the forked type, while the tail is rudimentary (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Deer).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The antlers are short, upright arid deeply furrowed, the beam&nbsp;forking at «about two-thirds of its length, and the upper prong&nbsp;again dividing, thus making.three points. The coat in summer&nbsp;is foxy red above and white below; in winter this changes&nbsp;to a greyish fawn, with a white rump-patch. The roe-buck&nbsp;or roe-deer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Capreolus caprea,</span><span class="font1"> or C. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">caprcolus)</span><span class="font1"> inhabits southern&nbsp;and temperate Europe as far east as the Caucasus, where, as&nbsp;in Syria, it is probably represented by another race or species.&nbsp;It frequents woods, preferring such as have a large growth of&nbsp;underwood and are in the neighbourhood of cultivated ground.&nbsp;The latter it visits in the evening in search of food; and where&nbsp;roe are numerous the damage done to growing crops is considerable. Pairing takes place in August, but the fawns are not&nbsp;born till the following AIay. According to one theory, the germ&nbsp;lies dormant until December, when it begins to develop; but&nbsp;it is now believed that this long gestation is due to slow rather&nbsp;than arrested development. Roe were formerly abundant in&nbsp;all the wooded parts of Great Britain, but were gradually exterminated, till a century and a half ago they were unknown</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">south of Perthshire. Since then the increase of plantations has led to the partial restoration of the species in the south&nbsp;of Scotland and the north of England; and it was reintroduced&nbsp;into Dorset early in the 19th century. These deer take readily&nbsp;to the water, and they have been known to swim across lochs&nbsp;more than half a mile in breadth. The Siberian roe (C. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pygar-gus),</span><span class="font1"> which is common in the Altai, is larger and paler than&nbsp;the type species, with shorter and more hairy ears, a larger&nbsp;white rump-patch, and small irregular snags on the inner border&nbsp;of the antlers. The Manchurian roe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Capreolus manchuricus)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is about the size of the European species, with antlers of the&nbsp;type of those of the Siberian roe, but more slender, and the&nbsp;coat shorter. Although described in 1889 as a local variety&nbsp;of the Siberian species, the AIanchurian roe really appears,&nbsp;both as regards stature, hairiness and the black and white&nbsp;markings on the muzzle, much more nearly related to the&nbsp;European animal. This is the more remarkable seeing that&nbsp;the habitats of the two are separated by such an enormous&nbsp;tract of country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(R. L.*)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROEDERER, PIERRE LOUIS, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Comte</span><span class="font1"> (1754-1835), French politician and economist, was bom at AIetz on the 15th of&nbsp;February 1754, the son of a magistrate. At the age of twenty-five he became councillor at the parlement of AIetz, and was&nbsp;commissioned in 1787 to draw up a list of remonstrances.&nbsp;His work advocating the suppression of internal customs&nbsp;houses </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Suppression des douanes intérieures),</span><span class="font1"> published the&nbsp;same year, is an elaborate treatise on the laws of commerce&nbsp;and on the theory of customs imposts. In 1788 he published&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Députation aux États généraux,</span><span class="font1"> a pamphlet remarkable for&nbsp;its bold exposition of liberal principles, and partly on the&nbsp;strength of this he was elected deputy to the statcs-general&nbsp;by the Third Estate of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bailliage</span><span class="font1"> of Aletz. In the Constituent Assembly he was a member of the committee of taxes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(comité des contributions),</span><span class="font1"> prepared a scheme for a new system&nbsp;of taxation, drew up a law on patents, occupied himself with&nbsp;the laws relating to stamps and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">assignats,</span><span class="font1"> and was successful&nbsp;in opposing the introduction of an income tax. After the&nbsp;close of the Constituent Assembly he was elected, on the&nbsp;nth of November 1791, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">procureur général syndic</span><span class="font1"> of the department of Paris. The directory of the department, of which&nbsp;the duc de la Rochefoucauld was president, was at this&nbsp;time in pronounced opposition to the advanced views that&nbsp;dominated the Legislative Assembly and the Jacobin Club,&nbsp;and Roederer was not altogether in touch with his colleagues.&nbsp;Thus he took no share in signing their protest against the&nbsp;law against the non-juring clergy, as a violation of religious&nbsp;liberty. But the directory did not long survive. With the&nbsp;growing anarchy of the capital many of its members resigned&nbsp;and fled, and their places could not be filled up. Roederer&nbsp;himself has left in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronique des cinquante jours</span><span class="font1"> (1832) an&nbsp;account of the pitiable part played by* the directory of the&nbsp;department in the critical period between the 20th of June&nbsp;and the 10th of August 1792. Seeing the perilous drift of&nbsp;things, he had tried to get into touch with the king; and it&nbsp;was on his advice that Louis, on the fatal 10th, took refuge&nbsp;in the Assembly. His conduct arousing suspicion, he went&nbsp;into hiding, and did not emerge again until after the fall of&nbsp;Robespierre. In 1796 he was made a member of the Institute,&nbsp;was appointed to a professorship of political economy, and&nbsp;founded the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Journal d’économie publique, de morale et de&nbsp;législation.</span><span class="font1"> Having escaped deportation at the time of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">coup d’état</span><span class="font1"> of 18 Fructidor, he took part in the revolution&nbsp;of 18 Brumaire, and was appointed by Napoleon member of&nbsp;the council of state and senator. Under the Empire, Roedcrer,&nbsp;whose public influence was very considerable, was Joseph&nbsp;Bonaparte’s minister of finance at Naples (1806), administrator&nbsp;of the grand duchy of Berg (1810), and imperial commissary&nbsp;in the south of France. During the Hundred Days he was&nbsp;created a peer of France. The Restoration government&nbsp;stripped him of his offices and dignities, but he recovered&nbsp;the title of peer of France in 1S32. He died on the 17th&nbsp;of December 1835. His son, Baron Antoine AIaric Roedcrcr</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
