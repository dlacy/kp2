the name of ſeveral poets celebrated in antiquity ; but by the Marbles it appears that the eldeſt and moſt illuſtrious of them was born in the 55th Olympiad, 538 years B. C. and that he died in his 90th year ; which nearly agrees with the chronology of Eu- ſebius. He was a native of Ceos, one of the Cyclades, in the neighbourhood of Attica, and the preceptor of Pindar. Both Plato and Cicero give him the character not only of a good poet and muſician, but ſpeak of him as a perſon oſ great virtue and wiſdom. Such longevity gave him an opportunity of knowing a great number of the firſt characters in antiquity with whom he was in ſome meaſure connected. It appears in Fabricius, from ancient authority, that Simonides was cotemporary and in friendſhip with Pittacus of Mitylene, Hipparchus tyrant of Athens, Pauſanias king of Sparta, Hiero tyrant of Syracuſe, with Themiſtocles, and with Alevades king of Theſſaly. He is mentioned by Herodotus ; and Xenophon, in his Dialogue upon Tyranny, makes him one of the interlocutors with Hiero king of Syracuſe. Cicero alleges, what has often been quoted in proof of the modeſty and wiſdom of Simonides, that when Hiero aſked him for a definition of God, the poet required a whole day to meditate on ſo important a queſtion : at the end of which, upon the prince putting the ſame queſtion to him a ſecond time, he aſked two days respite ; and in this manner always doubled the delay each time he was required to answer it ; till at length, to avoid offending his patron by more diſappointments, he frankly confessed that he found the queſtion to difficult, that the more he meditated upon it, the leſs was his hope of being able to ſolve it.</p><p>In his old age, perhaps from feeing the reſpect which money procured to ſuch as had lost the charms of youth and the power of attaching mankind by other means, he became ſomewhat mercenary and avaricious. He was frequently employed by the victors at the games to write panegyrics and odes in their praiſe, before his pupil Pindar had exerciſed his talents in their behalf : but Simonides would never gratify their vanity in this particular, till he had firſt tied them down to a ſtipulated ſum for his trouble ; and upon being upbraided for his<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0508.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0502"/>
meanneſs, he ſaid, that he had two coffers, in one of which he had for many years put his pecuniary rewards ; the other was for honours, verbal thanks, and promiſes ; that the firſt was pretty well filled, but the laſt remained always empty. And he made no scruple to confeſs, in his old age, that of all the enjoyments of life, the love of money was the only one of which time had not deprived him.</p><p>He was frequently reproached for this vice ; however, he always defended himſelf with good humour. Upon being aſked by Hiero’s queen, Whether it was moſt deſirable to be learned or rich ? he anſwered, that it was far better to be rich ; for the learned were always dependent on the rich, and waiting at their doors ; whereas, he never ſaw rich men at the doors of the learned. When he was accuſed of being ſo sordid as to ſell part of the proviſions with which his table was furniſhed by Hiero, he ſaid he had done it in order “ to diſplay to the world the magnificence of that prince and his own frugality.” To others he ſaid, that his reason for accumulating wealth was, that “ he would rather leave money to his enemies after death, than be troubleſome to his friends while living.”</p><p>He obtained the prize in poetry at the public games when he was fourſcore years of age. According to Suidas, he added four letters to the Greek alphabet ; and Pliny aſſigns to him the eighth ſtring of the lyre ; but theſe claims are diſputed by the learned.</p><p>His poetry was ſo tender and plaintive, that he acquired the cognomen of <hi rend="italic">Melicertes</hi> “ ſweet as honey ;” and the tearful eye of his muſe was proverbial. Dionyſius places him among thoſe poliſhed writers who excel in a ſmooth volubility, and flow on like plenteous and perennial rivers, in a courſe of even and uninterrupted harmony.</p><p>It is to Dionyſius that we are indebted for the preſervation of the following fragment of this poet. Danae being by her mercileſs father incloſed in a cheſt, and thrown into the ſea with her child, when night comes on, and a ſtorm ariſes which threatens to overſet the cheſt, ſhe, weeping and embracing the young Perſeus, cries out :</p><p>Sweet child ! what anguiſh does thy mother know,</p><p>Ere cruel grief has taught thy tears to flow !</p><p>Amidſt the roaring wind’s tremendous found,</p><p>Which threats deſtruction as it howds around ;</p><p>In balmy ſleep thou liest, as at the breaſt,</p><p>Without one bitter thought to break thy reſt.</p><p>The glimm’ring moon in pity hides her light,</p><p>And ſhrinks with horror at the ghaſtly fight.</p><p>Didſt thou but know, ſweet innocent ! our woes,</p><p>Not opiate’s pow’r thy eyelids now could cloſe.</p><p>Sleep on, ſweet babe ! ye waves in ſilence roll ;</p><p>And lull, O lull, to reſt my tortur’d soul !</p><p>There is a ſecond great poet of the name of Simonides recorded on the Marbles, ſuppoſed to have been his grandson, and who gained, in 478 B. C. the prize in the games at Athens.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
