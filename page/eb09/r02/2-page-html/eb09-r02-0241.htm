Tabulamm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There were provisions in them that were almost literal renderings from the legislation of Solon ; and others bore a remarkable correspondence to laws in observance in Greece, but there is no authority&nbsp;for saying they were directly borrowed. By far the greater proportion of them, however, were native and original,—not that they&nbsp;amounted to a general formularization of the hitherto floating&nbsp;customary law, for, notwithstanding Livy’s eulogium of them as&nbsp;the “ fountain of the whole law, both private and public, ” it seems&nbsp;clear that many branches of it were dealt with in the Tables only&nbsp;incidentally, or with reference to some point of detail. The institutions of the family, the fundamental rules of succession, the&nbsp;solemnities of such formal acts as mancipation, ηexum, and testaments, the main features of the order of judicial procedure, and so&nbsp;forth,—of all of these a general knowledge was presumed, and the&nbsp;decemvirs thought it unnecessary to define them. What they had&nbsp;to do was to make the law equal for all, to remove every chance of&nbsp;arbitrary dealing by distinct specification of penalties and precise&nbsp;declaration of the circumstances under which rights should be held&nbsp;to have arisen or been lost, and to make such amendments as were&nbsp;necessary to meet the complaints of the plebeians and prevent&nbsp;their oppression in the name of justice. Nothing of the customary&nbsp;law, therefore, or next to nothing, was introduced into the Tables&nbsp;that was already universally recognized, and not complained of as&nbsp;either unequal, indefinite, defective, or oppressive. Only one or&nbsp;two of the laws ascribed to the kings reappeared in them, and that&nbsp;in altered phraseology ; yet the omission of the rest did not mean&nbsp;their repeal or imply denial of their validity, for some of them&nbsp;were still in force in the empire, and are founded on by Justinian&nbsp;in his Digest. Neither were any of the laws of the republic anterior&nbsp;to the Tables embodied in them, although for long afterwards many&nbsp;a man had to submit to prosecution under them and to suffer the&nbsp;penalties they imposed. In saying, therefore, that for the most&nbsp;part the provisions of the decemviral code were of native origin,&nbsp;all that is meant is that they were the work of the decemvirs themselves, operating upon the hitherto unwritten law in the directions&nbsp;already indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The original Tables are said to have been destroyed when Rome was sacked and burned by the Gauls. But they were at once reproduced, and transcripts of them must have been abundant if, as&nbsp;Cicero says λvas still the case in his youth, the children were required&nbsp;to commit them to memory as an ordinary school task. This renders all the more extraordinary the fact that the remains of them&nbsp;are so fragmentary and their genuineness in many cases so debatable.&nbsp;They were embodied in the Tripertita of Sextus Ælius Pætus in&nbsp;the year 557 ; they must have formed the basis of all the writings&nbsp;on the jus civile down to the time of Servius Sulpicius Rufus (who&nbsp;first took the prætor’s edicts as a text); and they were the subjects&nbsp;of monographs by a number of authors of distinction, amongst them&nbsp;by M. Antistius Labeo in the early years of the empire and by Gaius&nbsp;probably in the reign of Hadrian. Yet a couple of score or so are&nbsp;all that can be collected of their provisions in what profess to be&nbsp;the ipsissima verba of the Tables,—though in a form in most cases&nbsp;more modern than what we encounter in other remains of archaic&nbsp;Latin. These are contained principally in the writings of Cicero,&nbsp;the Noctes Attieae of A ulus Gellius, and the treatise De verborum&nbsp;significations of Festus, the last two dealing with them rather as&nbsp;matters of antiquarian curiosity than as rules of positive law.&nbsp;There are many allusions to particular provisions in the pages of&nbsp;Cicero, Varro, Gellius, and the elder Pliny, as well as in those of&nbsp;Gaius, Paul, Ulpian, and other ante-Justinianian jurists ; but these&nbsp;are not implicitly to be relied on, as we have evidence that they&nbsp;frequently represent the (sometimes divergent) glosses of the interpreters rather than the actual provisions of the statute. Reconstruction has therefore been a work of difficulty, and the results&nbsp;far from satisfactory, that of the latest editor, Voigt, departing&nbsp;very considerably from the versions generally current during the&nbsp;last half century.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">In form the laws contained in the Tables were of remarkable brevity, terseness, and pregnancy, with something of a rhythmical&nbsp;cadence that must have greatly facilitated their retention in the&nbsp;memory. Here and there the rules they embodied were potestative ;&nbsp;but for the most part they were peremptory, running on broad lines,&nbsp;surmounting instead of removing difficulties. Their application&nbsp;might cause hardship in individual instances, as when a man was&nbsp;held to the letter of what he had declared in a nexum or mancipation, even though he had done so under error or influenced by&nbsp;fraudulent misrepresentations ; the decemvirs admitted no exceptions, preferring a hard-and-fast rule to any qualifications that&nbsp;might cause uncertainty. The system as a whole is one of jus as&nbsp;distinguished from fas. In the royal laws execration {saeratio&nbsp;capitis, sacer esto) was not an uncommon sanction ; but in the&nbsp;Tables it occurs only once pure and simple, and that with reference&nbsp;to an offence that could be committed only by a patrician,—material&nbsp;loss caused by a patron to his client (patrmιus, si clienti fraudem,&nbsp;faxsit, sacer esto). In all other cases the idea that a crime was an&nbsp;offence against public order, for which the community was entitled&nbsp;in self-protection to inflict punishment on the criminal, is as prominent as the older one that it was a sin against the gods, to be&nbsp;expiated by dedication of the sinner to the divinity more especially&nbsp;outraged by his offence. Hanging and beheading, flogging to&nbsp;death, burning at the stake, throwing from the Tarpeian rock,—&nbsp;such are the secular penalties that are met with in the Tables ; but&nbsp;often, though not invariably, the hanging and so forth is at the&nbsp;same time declared a tribute to some deity to whom the goods of&nbsp;the criminal are forfeited tponseerαtio bononιm).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is not unworthy of notice that traces remained in the Tables of the old system of self-help. The rnanus injeetio of the third&nbsp;Table—the execution done by a creditor against his debtor—was&nbsp;essentially the same procedure as under the kings, but with the&nbsp;addition of some regulations intended to prevent its abuse. Against&nbsp;a thief taken in the act something of the same sort seems still to&nbsp;have been sanctioned ; while it was still lawful to kill him on the&nbsp;spot if the theft was nocturnal, or even when it was committed&nbsp;during the day if he used arms in resisting his apprehension. According to Cicero there was a provision in these words—“si telum manu&nbsp;fugit magis quant jecit, arietem subicito”; this is just a re-enactment in illustrative language of the law attributed to Numa, that&nbsp;for homicide by misadventure—“ if the weapon have sped from the&nbsp;hand rather than been aimed”—a ram was to be tendered as a&nbsp;peace-offering to the kinsmen of him who had been slain. The&nbsp;original purpose must have been to stay the blood revenge, and it&nbsp;may even have been so with Numa ; but in the Tables it can only&nbsp;have been intended to stay the prosecution which it was incumbent&nbsp;on the kinsmen of a murdered man to institute. So with talionic&nbsp;penalties: “si membrum rupit,ni cum eo pacit, talio esto”—such,&nbsp;according to Gellius, were the words of one of the laws of the Tables,&nbsp;and they undoubtedly contain a reminiscence of a time when talion&nbsp;was recognized, “ an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth”; but in the&nbsp;mouths of the decemvirs they were nothidg more than a clumsy&nbsp;mode of enabling an injured man to exact the greatest money&nbsp;recompense he could, and to have it measured according to the&nbsp;position and fortune of the individual who had done him injury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The structure of the provisions of the Tables was not such as to enable the plain citizen to apply them to concrete cases, or know&nbsp;how to claim the benefit of them in the tribunals, without some&nbsp;sort of professional advice. Pomponius states that no sooner was&nbsp;the decemviral legislation published than the necessity was felt for&nbsp;its interpretation, and for the preparation by skilled hands of styles&nbsp;of actions by which its provisions might be made effectual. Both&nbsp;of these duties fell to the pontiffs as the oιdy persons who, in the&nbsp;state of civilization of the period, were well qualified to give the&nbsp;assistance required ; and Pomponius adds that the college annually&nbsp;appointed one of its members to be the adviser of private parties&nbsp;and of thejwe‰es in those matters. The interprétatif, commenced&nbsp;by the pontiffs and continued by the jurists during the republic,&nbsp;which, Pomponius says, was regarded as part of the civile,&nbsp;was not confined to explanation of the words of the statute, but&nbsp;was in some cases their expansion, in others their limitation, and&nbsp;in many the deduction of new doctrines from the actual jus scrip-turn, and their development and exposition. An event that did&nbsp;much to diminish the influence of the pontiffs in connexion with&nbsp;it was the divulgement in the year 450 by Cn. Flavius, secretary&nbsp;of Appius Claudius Cæcus, and probably at his instigation, of a&nbsp;formulary of actions and a calendar of lawful and unlawful days,&nbsp;which got the name of J<sup>r</sup>ris Flavianum. The practice adopted in&nbsp;the beginning of the 6th century by Tiberius Coruncanius, the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
