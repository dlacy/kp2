Even the Jacobins ſhemſelves, though neither timid nor cautious in the ſhedding of blood, be-gan to murmur when they ſaw that awful privilege confined excluſively within a few hands, or rather monopolized by an individual. In this, ſtate things remained for ſome time;, and it appeared how poffible it is for an individual to govern a great nation even while the whole of that nation is hoſtile to his power. The baniſhment or imprifonment of all foreigners, which had long been rigorouſſy practiſed, prevents us from poffeffing much accurate information concerning the internal ſtate of France at this period ; but it is certain, that one eircumftance in particular tendëd much to accelerate the fall of Robefpierre.. He had procured a decree to be paffed, authoriſing the committee of public ſafety to impriſon at its pleaſure, and bring to trial, any member oſ the convention. All the individuals of that body found themſelves placed by this decree in the hands oſ a man wlioſe ſevere and ſuſpicious temper they well knew. Still, however, they were ſo much ſurrounded’by ſpies, that it was difficult to form a party or plan oſ operations ; even the majority oſ the committee of public ſaſety were among the number oſ the diſcontented, but they dared not to withſtand their chief.. At laſt, on the 25th of July, the convention began to exhibit ſigns of agita-tion.. It was underſtood, that in the conrſe oſ a few day# Robefpierre would ſacriſice a number oſ the mem-bers to his ſuſpicions. On the following day the ſitting of the convention was ſtill more tempeſtuous. In a. long ſpeech Robefpierre defended his own conduct againſt thoſe who had reproached him with aſpiring to the dic-tatorfllip of France. He attacked the party whom he ſtyled <hi rend="italic">Moderates,</hi>  as. wiſhing ,to overturn the revolutionary government^ and to reſtore the feeble ſyſtem of the Briffotinesi The reſult of a long debate was, that Ro-beſpierre was apparently victorious, and his ſpeech was-ordered to be printed. On the 27th the convention, appeared ripe for a change : St Juſt, a member of the committee of public ſafety, in attempting to defend Robefpierre,. was repeatedly interrupted; and Billaud Varrennes ſtood forward and enumerated the crimes, and proclaimed the tyranny, of Robefpierre. The ſpeech was received with burſts of applauſe. Robe-ſpierre in vain attempted to defend himſelf ; he was filenced by ſhouts ©f execration from every part of the hall. Tallien ſeconded the former ſpeaker in . his ac-cuſation. The ſitting was declared permanent, and a decree of arreſt was paffed againſt Robefpierre and a younger brother of his, along with St Juſt, Couthon, and Lebas. Theſe men left the convention, and found? ſecurity in the hall of the commune of Paris ; where the municipal officers agreed to protect and ſtand by them. The tocſin was founded ; the armed force was under their command ; an infurrection was therefore attempted againſt the convention : but the ſections of Paris reſuſed their ſupport. Very few ef the troops· could be collected^ and thefe were, not ſirm ; the late tyranny had become odious. The hall of the commune was thereforeſpeedilyſurrounded; and about three o’clock in the morning of the 28th Robefpierre and his affoci</p><p>ates were made priſoners.« They had been· outlawed</p><p>by the convention on account of their reſlſtance. They were not therefore tried, unleft for the purpoſe of identifying their perſons ; and, in the courſe of that day, they were executed : 60 of the municipal officers were alſo executed <hi rend="italic">for</hi>  joining in their rebellion ; and in this way a ſtorm paſſed over, which at one time threatened to involve the French capital in ruin, and ſilled all Eu-rope with aſtoniſhment. Thus alſo terminated the career of the moſt extraordinary man that the French revolution had brought forward. His talents were undoubtedly confide rable, and his ambition knew no bounds^ bidding defiance to the ordinary feelings of humanity. Had Dumourier poſſeſſed his eoolneis and caution, or had lie poſſeffed the military talents of Dumourier, the convention would certainly have been overturned, and we ſhoul'd have ſeen a ſecond Cromwell on tile throne of his murdered ſovereign.</p><p>After the fall of Robeſpierre, the convention exhi-bited no ſmall change of appearance. Inſtead of that ſilence which formerly prevailed, all was buſtle and noiſe all accuſed each other. There was no longer any leader, and there was no formed party. Ί he foimer ſyſtem of terror was declared to be at an end, and a new ſyſtem of <hi rend="italic">moderatiſm</hi>  ſucceeded. This was carried to as great a height as tile fyſtem of terror had formerly been ; and all means were taken to render popular the fall of their late tyrant. The committees were or- ■ ganiſed anew, and their members ordered to be frequently changed. The correſpondence between the affiliated Jacobin clubs was prohibited, and at laſt the Jacobin club itſelf was aboliſhed. This laſt event was accompliſhed with eaſe ; and that ſociety which had been the great engine of the revolution, was itſelf without reſiſtance overturned. Seventy-one deputies of the Girondiſt party, who had been imprifoned ſince the 31ft of May 1793, were ſet at liberty. The name of Lyons was reſtored to it. Some of the agents of Robeſpierre were puniſhed, particularly the infamous Carrier, whoſe cruelties in La Vendee we formerly mentioned. Still, however, the convention appeared ſo little united and fo little decided with regard to objects of the ſirſt im~ portance, that in all probability they would not have conducted tlie important ſtruggle againſt the nations of Europe witli more ſucceſs than the Girondiſt party had formerly done, if the revolutionary government and the late fyſtem of terror had not already accumulated in their hands ſuch vaſt reſources, and traced out ſuch a plan of procedure, as rendered it an eaſy matter to preſerve their numerous armies in the train of ſuc~ ceſs to which they were now habituated, -</p><p>The allies in their retreat had left, ſtrang .garriſons in the French towns which had ſurrendered to them. Theſe were.Condé, Valenciennes, Queſnoi, and Lan-drecies. They now ſurrendered. to the republican ar-mies with ſo little reſiſtance, tliat the conduct of the emperor began to be-conſidered as ambiguous, and· he was ſuſpected of having entered · into ſome kind of com-promiſe with the French. This idea proved erroneous; and as ſuon as the army which had beſieged theſe towns was able to join the grand army under Pichegru ancl Jourdan, the. operations oſ the campaign were reſumed aſter a ſuſpenſion of almoſt two months. The French army divided itſelſ into two bodies. One oſ theſe un-» der Jourdan advanced againſt General Clairſait, who-had ſucceeded the prince of Cobourg in the command</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
