<p><span class="font1">dy theſe evils, and put it in execution, by enacting a law, enjoining all the Roman citizens to bring in an account in writing of their own names and ages, and&nbsp;of thoſe of their fathers, wives, and children. By the&nbsp;ſame law, all heads of families were commanded to deliver in upon oath a juſt eſtimate of their effects, and&nbsp;to add to it the places of their abode, whether in town&nbsp;or country. Whoever did not bring in an account of&nbsp;his effects, was to be deprived of his eſtate, to be beat&nbsp;with rods, and publicly ſold for a ſlave. Servius, ſrom&nbsp;theſe particular accounts, which might be pretty well&nbsp;relied on, undertook to eaſe the poor by burdening the&nbsp;rich, and at the ſame time to pleaſe the latter by increaſing their power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To this end, he divided the Roman people into ſix claſſes : the firſt claſs conſiſted of thoſe whoſe eſtates&nbsp;and effects amounted to the value of 10,000 drachmae,&nbsp;or 100,000 aſes of braſs; the firſt way of computing being uſed by the Greeks, and the latter by the Latins.&nbsp;This claſs was ſubdivided into 8o centuries, or companies of foot. To theſe Servius joined 18 centuries&nbsp;of Roman knights, who fought on horſeback ; and&nbsp;appointed this conſiderable body of horſemen to be at&nbsp;the head of the firſt claſs, becauſe the eſtates of theſe&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">X</span><span class="font1">knights, without all doubt, exceeded the ſum neceſſary&nbsp;to be admitted into it. However, the public ſupplied&nbsp;them with horſes ; for which a tax was laid upon widows, who were exempt from all other tributes. This&nbsp;firſt claſs, including infantry and cavalry, conſiſted of&nbsp;98 centuries. The ſecond claſs comprehended thoſe&nbsp;whoſe eſtates were valued at $700 drachmae, or 75,000&nbsp;aſes of braſs. It was ſubdivided into 20 centuries, all&nbsp;foot. To theſe were added two centuries of carpenters, ſmiths, and other artificers. In the third claſs&nbsp;were thoſe who were eſteemed worth 5000 drachmae,&nbsp;or 50,000 aſes. This claſs was ſubdivided into 20 centuries. The fourth claſs was of thoſe whoſe effects&nbsp;were rated at the value of 5co drachmæ, or 25,000&nbsp;aſes, and was divided into 20 centuries ; to which were&nbsp;added two other centuries of trumpets, and blowers of&nbsp;the horn, who ſupplied the whole army with this martial muſic. The fifth claſs included thoſe only whoſe&nbsp;whole ſubſtance did not amount to more than 1250&nbsp;drachmæ, or 12,500 aſes; and this claſs was divided&nbsp;into 30 centuries. The ſixth claſs comprehended all&nbsp;thoſe who w<sup>,</sup>ere not worth ſo much as thoſe of the fifth&nbsp;claſs : they exceeded in number any other claſs, but nevertheleſs were reckoned but as one century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The king drew from theſe regulations all the advantages he had expected. Levies ſor the army were no longer raiſed by tribes, nor were taxes laid at ſa&nbsp;much a head a3 formerly, but all was levied by centuries. When, for inſtance, an army of 20,000 men, or&nbsp;a large ſupply of money, was wanted for the war, each&nbsp;century furniſhed its quota both of men and money r&nbsp;ſo that the firſt claſs, which contained more centuries,&nbsp;though fewer men, than all the others together, furniſhed more men and more money for the public ſervſee&nbsp;than the whole Roman ſtate beſides. And by this&nbsp;means the Roman armies conſiſted for the moil part&nbsp;of the rich citizens of Rome ; who, as they had lands&nbsp;and effects to defend, fought w<sup>r</sup>ith more reſolution,&nbsp;while their riches enabled them to bear the expence&nbsp;of a campaign. As it was but juſt the king ſhould&nbsp;make the firſt </span><span class="font2">claſs </span><span class="font1">amends for the weight laid on it,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">he gave it almoſt the whole authority in ptιblic affairs ; changing the comitia by curiæ, in which every man&nbsp;gave his vote, into comitia by centuries, in which the&nbsp;majority was not reckoned by ſingle perſons, but by&nbsp;Centuries, how few ſoever there might be in a century.&nbsp;Hende the firſt claſs, which contained more centuries&nbsp;than the other five taken together, had every thing at&nbsp;its diſpoſal. The votes of this claſs were firſt taken ;&nbsp;and if the 98 centuries happened to agree, or only 97&nbsp;of them, the affair was determined ; becauſe theſe made&nbsp;the majority of the 193 centuries which compoſed the&nbsp;ſix claſſes. If they diſagreed, then the ſecond, the third,&nbsp;and the other claſſes in their order, were called to vote,&nbsp;though there was very ſeldom any occaſion to go ſo&nbsp;low as the fourth claſs for a majority of votes ; ſo that&nbsp;by this good order Servius brought the affairs of the&nbsp;ſtate to be determined by the judgment of the moſt&nbsp;conſiderable citizens, who underſtood the public intereſt much better than the blind multitude, liable to be&nbsp;impoſed upon, and eaſily corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And now the people being thus divided into ſeveral orders, according to the cenſus or valuation of their&nbsp;eſtates, Servius reſolved to ſolemnize this prudent regulation by ſome public act of religion, that it might&nbsp;be the more reſpected and the more laſting. Accordingly, all the citizens were commanded to appear, on&nbsp;a day appointed, in the Campus Martius, which was&nbsp;a large plain, lying between the city and the Tiber,&nbsp;formerly conſecrated by Romulus to the god Mars.&nbsp;Here the centuries being drawn up in battalia, a ſolemn&nbsp;luſtratiort or expiatory ſacriſice was performed in the&nbsp;name of all the people. The ſacriſice conſiſted of a ſow,&nbsp;a ſheep, and a bull, whence it took the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ſuove-taurilia.</span><span class="font1"> The whole ceremony was called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lujlrum, à&nbsp;luendo ;</span><span class="font1"> that is, from paying, expiating, clearing, or&nbsp;perhaps from the goddeſs Lua, who prefided over expiations, and to whom Servius had dedicated a temple.&nbsp;This wiſe king conſidering, that in the ſpace of five&nbsp;years there might be ſuch alterations in the fortunes of&nbsp;private perſons as to entitle ſome to be raiſed to an&nbsp;higher claſs, and reduce others to a lower, enjoined&nbsp;that the cenſus ſhould be renewed every five years. As&nbsp;the cenſus was uſually cloſed by the luſtrum, the Romans henceforth began to compute time by luſtrums,&nbsp;each luſtrum containing the ſpace of five years. However, the luſtrums were not always regularly obſerved,&nbsp;but often put off, though the cenſus had been made in&nbsp;the fifth year. Some writers are of opinion, that Servius at this time coined the firſt money that had ever&nbsp;appeared at Rome ; and add, that the circumſtances&nbsp;of the luſtrum probably led him to ſtamp the figures of&nbsp;the animals there ſlain on pieces of braſs of a certain&nbsp;weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The government of the city being thus eſtabliſhed in ſo regular a manner, Servius, touched with compaſ-fion for thoſe whom the misfortunes of an unſucceſsful&nbsp;war had reduced to ſlavery, thought that ſuch of them&nbsp;as had by long and faithful ſervices deſerved and obtained their feeedom, were much more worthy of being&nbsp;made Roman citizens, than untractable vagabonds from&nbsp;foreign countries, who were admitted without diſtinction. He therefore gave the freedmen their choice,&nbsp;either to return to their own country, or continue at&nbsp;Rome. Thoſe who choſe to continue there, he divided into four tribes, and ſettled them within the city ;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
