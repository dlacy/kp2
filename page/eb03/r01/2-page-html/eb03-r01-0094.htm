<p><span class="font1">of common ſenſe could receive it as authentic. He ſays it was death to touch the ark ! As ſuch an aſſertion was&nbsp;never heard oſ before, and as the ritual he was endeavouring to make them eſteem ſacred was opprcſſively&nbsp;multifarious ; ſurely ſome daring ſpirit would have ventured to put his veracity to the teſt by moving the ark&nbsp;and even offering ſacrifices ; and ſuch a teſt would at&nbsp;once have expofed the impoſture. The budding rod,&nbsp;too, and the hat of manna, which, though long preferved, were never before heard of', muſt have produced&nbsp;inquiries that could not fail to end in detection. Thefe&nbsp;books ſpeak likewiſe of weekly ſabbaths, daily ſacrifices,&nbsp;a yearly expiation, and monthly feſtivals, all to be kept&nbsp;in remembrance of great things particularly fpecified as&nbsp;done for the nation at an early period of its exiſtence.&nbsp;If this was not the caſe, could the forger of the books&nbsp;have perſuaded the people that it really was fo ? The&nbsp;enlightened reaſoners of this nation would be offended&nbsp;were we to compare them with the ancient Iſraelites ;&nbsp;but ſurely they will not ſay that we are partial to that&nbsp;people, if we bring them to a level with the moſt ſavage&nbsp;tribes of the Ruſſian empire, who profeſs Chriſtianity ?&nbsp;Now, were a book to be forged containing an account&nbsp;of many ſtrange things done a thouſand years ago in&nbsp;Siberia by an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apollonius,</span><span class="font1"> or any other philoſopher&nbsp;or hero, numbers of the barbarians inhabiting that&nbsp;country would, we doubt not, give implicit credit&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legend</span><span class="font1"> : But were the author, in confirmation of&nbsp;his narrative, to affirm, that all the Siberians had from&nbsp;that day to this kept ſacred the ſirſt day of the week in&nbsp;memory of his hero ; that they had all been baptized&nbsp;or circumciſed in his name ; that in their public judicatories they had fworn by his name, and upon that very&nbsp;book which they had never feen before ; and that the&nbsp;very ſame book was their law and their goſpel, by&nbsp;which for a thouſand years back the actions of the whole&nbsp;people had been regulated—ſurely the groffeſt favage&nbsp;among them would reject with contempt and indignation a forgery ſo palpable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If this reaſoning be concluſive, the books of Moſes muſt indubitably be authentic, and he himſelf muſt have&nbsp;been inſpired by the ſpirit of God. But this point being eſtabliſhed, the queſtion reſpecting the origin of the&nbsp;primaeval religion is completely anfwered. The writer&nbsp;of the book of Genelis informs us, that Adam and&nbsp;Noah received many revelations from the Author of&nbsp;their being, and that their religion was founded on the&nbsp;principles of the pureſt theiſm. How it degenerated&nbsp;among the greater part of their defcendants into the&nbsp;groſſeſt idolatry, has been ſhown at large in another&nbsp;place. See Polytheism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. Having thus anſwered the firſt queſtion propofed&nbsp;ſor diſcuſſion in the preſent article, we now proceed to&nbsp;conſider the ſecond, and to inquire whether and how far&nbsp;religious ſentiments have a tendency to injure or to pro-mote the welfare of fociety ? This is a ſubject of the&nbsp;utmoſt importance ; and if we prove ſucceſsful in our&nbsp;inquiries, we ſhall be enabled to determine whether the&nbsp;governors of mankind ought carefully to ſupport religious eſtabliſhments, or whether the philoſopher who&nbsp;calls himſelf a citizen of the world, and profeſſes to&nbsp;feel the moſt eager deſire to promote the intereſts of&nbsp;his ſpecies, acts conſiſtently when he labours to exterminate religion from among men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A celebrated French financier *, a man of abilities </span><span class="font1">and virtue, who has publiihed a book on the importance&nbsp;of religious opinions, labours to ſhow that religious eſta-bliſhrnents are indiſpenſably neceſſary for the maintenance&nbsp;of civil order., and demonſtrates how weak the influence&nbsp;of political inſtitutions is on the morals of mankind ;&nbsp;but he refuſes to review the hiſtory of paſt ages in order&nbsp;to diſcover how far religious opinions have actually been&nbsp;injurious or beneficial to the welfare of ſociety ; choo-ſing rather to content himſelf with the refult of a ſe«&nbsp;ries of metaphyfical diſquifitions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">we admire the ſpirit which induced a man who had ſpent a confiderable part of his life -amid the hurry of&nbsp;public bufinefs, to become the ſtrenuous advocate of re-ligion ; but we cannot help thinking that, notwithſtanding the eloquence, the acuteneſs, and the knowledge of&nbsp;mankind which he has diſplayed, his refuſing to admit&nbsp;the evidence of facts concerning the influence of reli-gion on ſociety may poſſibly be regarded by its enemies&nbsp;as a tacit acknowledgment that the evidence of facts&nbsp;would be unfavourable to the cauſe which he wiſhes to&nbsp;defend. The fallacy of general reaſonſhgs, and the inutility of metaphyfics for the purpoſes of life, are ſo uni-verſally acknowledged, that they have long been the&nbsp;theme of declamation. Though the abuſes oſ religion,&nbsp;as well as the abuſes of reaſon, the perverſion oi any&nbsp;of the principles of the human mind, and the miſap-plication of the gifts of providence, may have often&nbsp;produced effects hurtful to the virtue and the happineſs&nbsp;of mankind ; yet, after tracing religion to a divine ori-gin, we cannot, for a moment, allow ourſelves to think&nbsp;that the primary tendency of religion muſt be hoſtile&nbsp;to the intereſts of ſocicty, or that it is neceſſary to view&nbsp;it abſtractly in order that we may not behold it in an&nbsp;odious light, often has the fceptic attacked religion&nbsp;with artful malice ; but perhaps none of his attacks has&nbsp;been ſo ſkilfully directed as that which has firſt ridiculed the abſurdity of the moſt abſurd ſuperſtitions,&nbsp;and afterwards laboured to prove that the moſt abfurd&nbsp;ſyſtem of polytheiſm is more favourable to the intereſts&nbsp;of ſociety than the pureſt and moſt ſublime theiſm. In-ftances in which the abuſe of religion had tended to&nbsp;deprave the human heart, and had led to the moſt&nbsp;ſhocking crimes, have been aſſiduouſly collected, and&nbsp;diſplayed in all the aggravating colours in which elo-quence could array them, till at length even the friends&nbsp;of true religion have been abaſhed ; and it has become&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">faſhionable opinion, that nothing but ſelf-intereſt or&nbsp;bigotry can prompt men to repreſent religion as the&nbsp;friend of civil order. But let us try if, by a candid&nbsp;conſideration of what effects have reſulted to ſociety&nbsp;from religious principles, in general, without compa-ring theſe with regard to truth or falſehood, we can</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">advance any thing to vindicate the character of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Notions of Deity in general, of various orders of divinities, of their moral character, of their influence&nbsp;on human life, of a future ſtate, and of the immortality of the human foul, conſtitute the leading articles&nbsp;of religion. Let us view thefe together with the rites&nbsp;to which they have given jiſe ; and we may perhaps&nbsp;be enabled to form fome well-grounded notions on this&nbsp;important point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I. Having proved that the firſt religious principles entertained by men were derived from revelation, it is impoffible to ſuppoſe that they could produce effects in-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
