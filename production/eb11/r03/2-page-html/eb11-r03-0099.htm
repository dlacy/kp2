<p><span class="font1">RIVET (O. Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rivet,</span><span class="font1"> from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">river,</span><span class="font1"> to fix, fasten together, of unknown origin; Skeat compares Icel. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rifa,</span><span class="font1"> to stitch together),&nbsp;a metal pin or bolt used to fasten metal plates together. A&nbsp;rivet, made of wrought iron, copper or other malleable substance,&nbsp;is usually made with a head at one end, the other end being&nbsp;hammered out after passing through the plates so as to keep them&nbsp;closely fastened together. A “ bolt ” differs from a rivet in&nbsp;that one or both ends have screw-threads to hold a nut (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Shipbuilding).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIVlERA, the narrow belt of coast which Hes between the mountains and the sea all round the Gulf of Genoa in the&nbsp;north of Italy, extending from Nice on the W. to Spezia on&nbsp;the E. It is usually spoken of as Riviera di Ponente (“ the&nbsp;coast of the setting sun ”), the portion between Nice and the&nbsp;city of Genoa; and as Riviera di Levante (“ the coast of the&nbsp;rising sun ”), the portion from Genoa to Spezia. All this district,&nbsp;being open to the S. and sheltered from the N. and E. winds,&nbsp;enjoys a remarkably mild climate (winter mean, about 49°&nbsp;Fahr.); so much so that the vegetation in many places partakes of a subtropical character </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> the pomegranate, agave,&nbsp;prickly pear, date, palm and banana). Large numbers of&nbsp;flowers, especially roses, violets, hyacinths, &amp;c., are grown&nbsp;near Nice, Mentone, Bordighera and other towns, and sent&nbsp;to the London and Paris markets. Bordighera is particularly&nbsp;noted for its noble groves of date-palms, one of the few places&nbsp;in Europe where these trees grow. The uncommon mildness&nbsp;of the climate, conjoined with the natural beauty of the coast&nbsp;scenery,—the steep sea-crags, the ruined towers and the range&nbsp;of the Maritime Alps,—attracts thousands of invalids and&nbsp;convalescents to spend the winter in the chain of towns and&nbsp;villages which stretch from the one end of the Riviera to the&nbsp;other, while these resorts are frequented for sea-bathing in&nbsp;summer by the Italians. Proceeding from W. to E. the following&nbsp;are the places to which visitors principally resort: Nice, Monaco&nbsp;(an independent principality), Monte Carlo, Mentone (the&nbsp;last town on the French Riviera), VentimigUa, Bordighera,&nbsp;Ospedaletti, San Remo, Porto Maurizio, OnegUa, Diano Marina,&nbsp;Alassio, Arenzano, Pegli (in the Riviera di Ponente), and Nervi,&nbsp;Santa Margherita, Rapallo, Chiavari, Sestri Levante, Levanto,&nbsp;Spezia, and San Terenzo (Lerici) in the Riviera di Levante.&nbsp;The Riviera labours, however, under the grave drawback of&nbsp;being liable to earthquakes. In the 19th century there were&nbsp;four such visitations, in 1818, 1831, 1854 and 1887, which&nbsp;especiaUy affected the western Riviera. A railway runs -close&nbsp;along the shore all through the Riviera, the distance from&nbsp;Nice to Genoa being 116 m., and the distance from Genoa&nbsp;to Spezia 56 m. In the latter stretch the Une burrows through&nbsp;the many projecting headlands by means of more than eighty&nbsp;tunnels. The pearl of the eastern Riviera is the stretch (6 to&nbsp;7 m.) between Rapallo and Chiavari. Lord Byron and Shelley&nbsp;both lived and wrote on the shores of the Gulf of Spezia, and&nbsp;Dickens wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Chimes</span><span class="font1"> at Genoa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIVIERE, BRITON (1840- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), English artist, was born</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in London on the 14th of August 1840. His father, WilUam Riviere, was for some years drawing-master at Cheltenham&nbsp;College, and afterwards an art teacher at Oxford. IIe was&nbsp;educated at Cheltenham College and at Oxford, where he&nbsp;took his degree in 1867. For his art training he was indebted&nbsp;almost entirely to his father, and early in life made for himself a place of importance among the artists of his time. His&nbsp;first pictures appeared at the British Institution, and in 1857&nbsp;he exhibited three works at the Royal Academy, but it was&nbsp;not until 1863 that he became a regular contributor to the&nbsp;Academy exhibitions. In that year he was represented by&nbsp;“The Eve of the Spanish Armada,” and in 1864 by a “Romeo&nbsp;and Jul^t.” Subjects of this kind did not, however, attract&nbsp;him long, for in 1865 he began, with a picture of a “ Sleeping&nbsp;Deerhound,” that series of paintings of animal-subjects which&nbsp;has since occupied him almost exclusively. Among the most&nbsp;memorable of his productions are: “The Poacher’s Nurse”&nbsp;(1866), “Circe” (1871), “Daniel” (1872), “The Last of&nbsp;the Garrison” (1875), “Lazarus” (1877), “ PersepoUs ”&nbsp;(1878), “In Manus Tuas, Domine” (1879), “The Magician’s&nbsp;Doorway” (1882), “ Vae Victis ” (1885), “ Rizpah ” (1886),&nbsp;“ An Old-World VVanderer ” (1887), “ Of a Fool and his Folly&nbsp;there is no End ” (1889), “ A Niighty Hunter before the Lord ”&nbsp;(1891), “ The King’s Libation ” (1893), “ Beyond Man’s Footsteps ” (1894), now in the National GaUery of British Art;&nbsp;“Phoebus ApoUo ” (1895); “Aggravation” (1896), “St&nbsp;George” (1900), and “To the Hills” (1901). He has also&nbsp;painted portraits; and at the outset of his career made&nbsp;some mark as an illustrator, beginning with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Punch.</span><span class="font1"> He&nbsp;was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1878, and&nbsp;R.A. in 1881, and received the degree of D.C.L. at Oxford&nbsp;in 1891.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RIVINGTON, CHARLES (1688-1742), British publisher, was born at Chesterfield, Derbyshire, in 1688. Coming to London&nbsp;as apprentice to a bookseller, he took over in 1711 the publishing business of Richard ChisweU (1639-1711), and, at the sign&nbsp;of the Bible and the Crown in Paternoster Row, he carried on&nbsp;a business almost entirely connected with theological and&nbsp;educational Uterature. He also published one of Whitefield’s&nbsp;earliest works, and brought out an edition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Imitation&nbsp;of Christ.</span><span class="font1"> In 1736 Rivington founded the company of booksellers who called themselves the “ New Cbnger, ” in rivalry&nbsp;with the older association, the “ Conger,” dating from about&nbsp;1700.

James emigrated to America, and&nbsp;pursued his trade in New York (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Newspapers, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">U.S.A</span><span class="font1">.) ; John&nbsp;carried on the business on the lines marked out by his father,&nbsp;and was the great Church of England publisher of the day.&nbsp;In 1760 he was appointed publisher to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, and the firm retained the agency&nbsp;for over seventy years. Having admitted his sons Francis&nbsp;(1745-1822) and Charles (1754-1831) into partnership he&nbsp;undertook for the “ New Conger ” Association the issue of a&nbsp;standard edition of the works of Shakespeare, Milton, Locke&nbsp;and other British classics; also Cruden’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Concordance.</span><span class="font1"> John&nbsp;Rivington died on the 16th of January 1792. In 1810 John&nbsp;(1779-1841), the eldest son of Francis, was admitted a partner.&nbsp;In 1827 George (1801-1858) and Francis (1805-1885), sons of&nbsp;Charles Rivington, joined the firm. Rivington contracted&nbsp;further ties with the High Church party by the publication&nbsp;(1833, &amp;c.) of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tracts for the Times.</span><span class="font1"> John Rivington died on&nbsp;the 2 ist of November 1841, his son, John Rivington (1812-1886) having been admitted a partner in 1836. George Riving-ton died in 1858; and in 1859 Francis Rivington retired,&nbsp;leaving the conduct of affairs in the hands of John Rivington&nbsp;and his own sons, Francis Hansard (b. 1834) and Septimus&nbsp;(b. 1846). In 1890 the business was sold to Messrs Longmans&nbsp;(ç.t&gt;.). A business of the same character was, however, carried&nbsp;on from 1889 to 1893 by Mr Septimus Rivington and Mr John&nbsp;Guthrie Percival, as Percival &amp; Co. This was changed&nbsp;in 1893 to Rivington, Percival &amp; Co.; and in 1897 the, firm&nbsp;revived its earlier title of Rivington &amp; Co., maintaining its&nbsp;reputation for educational works and its connexion with the&nbsp;Moderate and High Church party.</span></p>
