a town of France, in the department of Loire Inférieure, and a port on the right bank of the Loire near its mouth. It has rapidly grown since the new docks rendered it the outport or detached harbour of <hi rend="smallcaps">NaNTES</hi> <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> from which it is distant 29 miles west-north-west by water and 40 by rail. Begun in 1845 and opened in 1857, the first basin has an area of 26 acres and 1 mile of quays ; and the depth varies from 20 to 25 feet. To the north of the first basin a new dock (Penhouet), 56 acres in extent and with 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> miles of quay, was constructed between 1864 and 1881, at a cost of nearly £1,000,000. It communicates with the older basin by a passage 82 feet wide and 673 long. The harbour can admit vessels of 23 feet draught at every tide, the depth of water on the sill varying from 26 to 30 feet at high tide, and never being less than 13. The town is the terminus of the General Transatlantic Company, whose steamers connect France with Mexico, the Antilles, and the Isthmus of Panama. The total imports and exports amount to about 1,600,000 tons annually, valued at £24,000,000. The staple articles</p><p>imported are coals from Great Britain (500,000 tons), grain, sugar, coffee, rice, timber (from the North), phosphates, and guano. Pit-props, salt, and preserved foods are exported. The town being of recent origin, its industries are only in process of development; but it already contains shipbuilding yards, large ironworks, artificial fuel factories, sawmills, a flour-mill, and extensive commercial warehouses. There are no edifices of historical or architectural note with the exception of a granite dolmen, 10 feet long and 5 broad, resting horizontally on two other stones sunk in the soil, above which they rise 6 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> feet. The population was 16,314 in 1881 (19,626 in the commune).</p><p>According to certain remains discovered on excavating the docks, St Nazaire seems to occupy the site of the ancient Corbilo, placed by Strabo among the more important maritime towns of Gaul, and probably founded by the Phoenicians. It was in the harbour of Corbilo that Crassus by Caesar’s order built the fleet by which, in 56 B.C., Brutus routed the 220 vessels of the Venetian insurgents. At the close of the 4th century the site of Corbilo was occupied by Saxons, and, their conversion to Christianity being effected one or two hundred years later by St Felix of Nantes, the place took the name of St Nazaire. It was still only a little “bourg” of 3000 inhabitants when it was chosen as the site of the new harbour for Nantes, because the ascent of the Loire was becoming more and more difficult. In 1868 the sub-prefecture was transferred to St Nazaire from Savenay.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
