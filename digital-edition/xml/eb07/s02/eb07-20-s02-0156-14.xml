a town of Kurdistan, in Asiatic Turkey, the ancient capital of Tigranes, which was plundered by the Romans under Lucullus, but retained its consequence till after the Saracen invasion. It is now only a large village, containing about 3000 inhabitants, partly Mahommedans and partly Armenian Christians, for whose accommodation there are three small mosques, a college, and an Armenian church. It is situated in a small plain, surrounded by mountains, and is washed by the river KabÏ…ur. The chief is a powerful feudal lord. It is seventy-five miles south-east of Diarbekir.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
