<p><span class="font1">that they elected a chief bearing the title </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">consul, senator, princeps Romano rum,</span><span class="font1"> who was officially recognized by the&nbsp;pope, as a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patricius</span><span class="font1"> presided over the tribunals, and was the&nbsp;head of the commune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Theophylact was one of the first to assume this dignity. His wife Theodora, known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">senatrix,</span><span class="font1"> was one of the women&nbsp;then dominating Rome by force of their charms and licentiousness. She was supposed to be the concubine of Pope John X.&nbsp;(914-28), whose election was due to her influence. Her&nbsp;daughter Marozia, in all things her worthy rival, was married to&nbsp;Alberic, a foreign mercenary of uncertain birth who rose to a&nbsp;position of great influence, and, although an alien, played a&nbsp;leading part in the affairs of the city. He helped to increase&nbsp;the power of Theophylact, who seemingly shared the rule of the&nbsp;city with the pope. In the bloody war that had to be waged&nbsp;against the Saracens of southern Italy, and at the defeat of the&nbsp;latter on the Garigliano (916), Theophylact and Alberic were&nbsp;the Roman leaders, and distinguished themselves by their&nbsp;valour. They disappeared from the scene after this victory,&nbsp;but Marozia retained her power, and bore a son, Alberic, who&nbsp;was destined to greater deeds. The pope found himself caught&nbsp;in this woman’s toils, and struggled to escape, but Marozia,&nbsp;gaining fresh influence by her marriage with Hugo, margrave&nbsp;of Tuscany, imprisoned the pontiff himself in the castle of St&nbsp;Angelo (928). This fortress was the property of Marozia and&nbsp;the basis of her strength. The unfortunate John died within&nbsp;its walls. Raised to the chair by Theodora, he was deposed&nbsp;and killed by her daughter. The authority of the latter reached&nbsp;its Culminating point in 931, when she succeeded in placing her&nbsp;son John XI. on the papal throne. On the death of her second&nbsp;husband she espoused Hugh of Provence, the same who in 928&nbsp;had seized the iron crown at Pavia, and now aspired to the&nbsp;empire. Dissolute, ambitious and despotic, he came to Rome&nbsp;in 932, and, leaving his army outside the walls, entered the&nbsp;castle of St Angelo with his knights, instantly began to play&nbsp;the tyrant, and gave a blow to Alberic his stepson, who detested&nbsp;him as a foreign intruder. This blow proved the&nbsp;cause of a memorable revolution; for Alberic rushed&nbsp;from the castle and harangued the people, crying that&nbsp;the time was come to shake off the tyrannous yoke of&nbsp;a woman and of barbarians who were once the slaves&nbsp;of Rome. Then, putting himself at the head of the&nbsp;populace, he closed the city gates to prevent Hugh’s&nbsp;troops from coming to the rescue, and attacked the&nbsp;castle. The king fled; Marozia was imprisoned, Alberic proclaimed lord of the Romans, and the pope confined to the&nbsp;Lateran in the custody of his own brother. Rome was again an&nbsp;independent state, a republic of nobles. Rid of the temporal&nbsp;dominion of emperor and pope, and having expelled the&nbsp;foreigners with great energy and courage, it chose Alberic for its&nbsp;chief with the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">princeps atque omnium Rom anorum senator.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The tendency of the Roman Republic to elect a supreme authority, first manifested in the case of Theophylact, was repeated&nbsp;in those of Alberic, Brancaleone, Crescenzio, Cola di Rienzo&nbsp;and others. One of the many causes of this tendency may be&nbsp;traced to the conception of the new empire of which Rome was&nbsp;the original and enduring fountainhead. As Rome had once&nbsp;transferred the empire from Byzantium to the Franks, so Rome&nbsp;was surely entitled to reclaim it. The imperial authority was&nbsp;represented by the office of patrician, now virtually assumed by&nbsp;Alberic. That he gave the name of Oct avian to his son is an&nbsp;additional proof of this fact. In the Eternal City the medieval&nbsp;political idea has always the aspect of a resurrection or transformation of classic antiquity. This is another characteristic</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of the history of the Roman commune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Alberic’s strength was due to his connexion with the nobility, to his father’s valiant service against the Saracens at the battle&nbsp;of Garigliano, and to the militia under his command, on which&nbsp;everything depended amid the internal and external dangers&nbsp;now threatening the new state. As yet no genuine municipal&nbsp;constitution was possible in Rome, where neither the people&nbsp;nor the wealthy burghers engaged in industry and commerce&nbsp;had any fixed organization. All was in the hands of the nobles,&nbsp;and Alberic. as their chief, frequently convened them in council,&nbsp;although obliged to use pressure to keep them united and avoid&nbsp;falling a prey to their disputes. Hence the whole power was&nbsp;concentrated in his grasp; he was at the head of the tribunals&nbsp;as well as of the army. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judices de clero</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judices de&nbsp;militia</span><span class="font1"> still existed, but no longer met in the Lateran or the&nbsp;Vatican, under the presidency of emperor and pope or their&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mis si.</span><span class="font1"> Alberic himself was their president; and, a still more&nbsp;significant fact, their sittings were often held in his private&nbsp;dwelling. There is no longer any mention of prefect or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patricius.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The papal coinage was inscribed with Alberic’s name instead of&nbsp;the emperor’s. His chief attention was given to the militia,&nbsp;which was still arranged in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">scholae,</span><span class="font1"> and it is highly probable that&nbsp;he was the author of the new division of the city into twelve&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regions,</span><span class="font1"> with a corresponding classification of the army in as&nbsp;many regiments under twelve flags and twelve </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi,</span><span class="font1"> one&nbsp;for every region. The organization of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">scholae</span><span class="font1"> could not&nbsp;have been very dissimilar, but doubtless Alberic had some&nbsp;important motive for altering the old method of classification.&nbsp;By means of the armed regions he included the people in the&nbsp;forces. It is certain that after his time we find the army much&nbsp;changed and far more democratic. It was only natural that so&nbsp;excellent a statesman should seek the aid of the popular element&nbsp;as a defence against the arrogance of the nobles, and it was&nbsp;requisite to reinforce the army in order to be prepared for the&nbsp;attacks threatened from abroad. This change effected, Alberic&nbsp;felt prepared for the worst, and began to rule with energy,&nbsp;moderation and justice. His contemporaries award him high&nbsp;praise, and he seems to have been exempt from the vices of his&nbsp;mother and grandmother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 933 Hugh made his first attack upon the city, and was repulsed. A second attempt in 936 proved still more unfortunate, for his army was decimated by a pestilence. Thoroughly&nbsp;disheartened, he not only made peace, but gave his daughter in&nbsp;marriage to Alberic, thus satisfying the latter’s desire to ally&nbsp;himself with a royal house. But this union led to no conciliation&nbsp;with Hugh. For Alberic, finding his power increased, marched&nbsp;at the head of his troops to consolidate his rule in the Cam-pagna and the Sabine land. On the death of his brother, Pope&nbsp;John XI., in 936, he controlled the election of several successive&nbsp;popes, quelled a conspiracy formed against him by the clergy&nbsp;and certain nobles instigated by Hugh, and brilliantly repulsed,&nbsp;in 941, another attack by that potentate. At last, however,&nbsp;this inveterate foe withdrew from Rome, being summoned to the&nbsp;north by the victories of his rival Berengarius. But' Alberic,&nbsp;after procuring the election of various popes who were docile&nbsp;instruments of his ’will, experienced a check when Agapetus II.&nbsp;(946-55), a man of firmness and resource, was raised to the&nbsp;papal throne. The fortunes of Berengarius were now in the&nbsp;ascendant. In 950 he had seized the iron crown, and ruled&nbsp;in the Pentapolis and the exarchate. This being singularly&nbsp;painful to the pope, he proceeded to make alliance with all&nbsp;those enemies of Berengarius preferring a distant emperor to a&nbsp;neighbouring and effective sovereign, with the Roman nobles&nbsp;who were discontented with Alberic, and with all who foresaw&nbsp;danger, even to Rome, from the extended power of Berengarius.&nbsp;And Agapetus recurred to the old papal policy, by making&nbsp;appeal to Otto I., whose rule in Germany was distinguished by a&nbsp;prestige almost comparable with that of Charlemagne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Otto immediately responded to the appeal and descended into Italy; but his envoys were indignantly repulsed by Alberic,&nbsp;and, being prudent as well as firm, he decided to wait a more&nbsp;opportune moment for the accomplishment of his designs.&nbsp;Meanwhile Alberic died in 954, and the curtain fell on the first&nbsp;great drama of the Roman Republic. He had reigned for&nbsp;twenty-two years with justice, energy and prudence; he had&nbsp;repelled foreign invaders, maintained order and authority. He&nbsp;seems, however, to have realized that the aspect of affairs was&nbsp;about to change, that the work he had accomplished would be&nbsp;exposed to new dangers. These dangers, in fact, had already&nbsp;begun with the accession of an enterprising pope to the Holy</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
