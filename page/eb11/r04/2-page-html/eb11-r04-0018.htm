<p><span class="font1">of presumptive evidence is against them; they have hitherto found little or no support from other Romanists, and they&nbsp;have, in our opinion, been sufficiently refuted on philological&nbsp;and other grounds by Girard<sup>@@1</sup> and others.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There were provisions in the Tables that were almost literal renderings from the legislation of Solon; and others bore a remarkable correspondence to laws in observance in Greece,&nbsp;but they may have been only indirectly borrowed.<sup>@@3</sup> By&nbsp;far the greater proportion of them, however, were native and&nbsp;original,—not that they amounted to a general formularization&nbsp;of the hitherto floating customary, law, for, notwithstanding Livy’s&nbsp;eulogium of them as the “ fountain of the whole law,.both private&nbsp;and public,” it seems clear that many branches of it were dealt&nbsp;with in the Tables only incidentally, or with reference to some&nbsp;point of detail. The institutions of the family, the fundamental&nbsp;rules of succession, the solemnities of such formal acts as mancipation, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nexum,</span><span class="font1"> and testaments, the main features of the order of&nbsp;judicial procedure, and so forth,—of all of these.a general knowledge was presumed, and the decemvirs thought it unnecessary to&nbsp;define them. What they had to do was to make the law. equal&nbsp;for all, to remove every chance of arbitrary dealing by distinct&nbsp;specification of penalties and precise declaration of the circumstances under which rights should be held to have arisen or been&nbsp;lost, and to make sucn amendments as were necessary to meet&nbsp;the complaints of the plebeians and prevent their oppression in&nbsp;the name of justice. Probably very little of the customary law,&nbsp;therefore, was introduced into the Tables, that was already universally recognized, and not complained of as either unequal, defective&nbsp;or oppressive. Only one or two of the laws ascribed to the kings&nbsp;(assuming their greater antiquity) reappeared in them; yet the&nbsp;omission of the rest did not mean their repeal or imply denial of&nbsp;their validity, for a few of them continued still in force during the&nbsp;Empire, and are founded on by Justinian in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digest.</span><span class="font1"> Neither&nbsp;apparently were any of the statutes of the Republic anterior to&nbsp;the Tables embodied in them, although for long afterwards many a&nbsp;man had to submit to prosecution under these laws and to suffer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the penalties they imposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The original Tables are said to have been destroyed when Rome was sacked and burned by the Gauls. But they were probably&nbsp;at once reproduced, and transcripts of them in more or&nbsp;less modernized language must have been abundant if,&nbsp;as Cicero says was still the case in his youth, the children were&nbsp;required to commit them to memory as an ordinary school task.&nbsp;This renders all the more extraordinary the fact that the remains&nbsp;of them are so fragmentary and their genuineness in many cases&nbsp;so debateable. They were embodied, as above mentioned, in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tripertita</span><span class="font1"> of. Sextus Aelius Paetus in the year 197 B.C., who probably republished them in somewhat modernized language and&nbsp;from whose work, it is thought, all. later writers took their contents.&nbsp;They must have formed the basis of all the writings on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus&nbsp;civile</span><span class="font1"> down to the time of Servius Sulpicius Rufus, who first took&nbsp;the praetor’s edicts as a text; and they were the subjects of monographs even by authors later than Sulpicius, amongst them by&nbsp;M. Antistius Labeo in the early years of the Empire, and by Gaius,&nbsp;probably in the reign of Antoninus Pius. Yet a couple of score&nbsp;or so are all that can be collected of their provisions in what profess to be the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ipsissima verba</span><span class="font1"> of the Tables, though in a form in&nbsp;most cases more modern than what we encounter in other remains&nbsp;of archaic Latin of the 4th century of the city. These are contained principally in the writings of Cicero, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nodes Atticae</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;Aulus Gellius, and the treatise </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De verborum signification#</span><span class="font1"> of Festus;&nbsp;the two latter dealing with them.rather as matters of antiquarian&nbsp;curiosity than as rules of positive law. There are also many&nbsp;allusions to particular provisions in the pages of Cicero, -Varro,&nbsp;Gellius and the elder Pliny, as well as in those of Gaius, Paul,&nbsp;Ulpian and other ante-Justinian jurists; but these are not to be&nbsp;implicitly relied on, as we have evidence that they frequently&nbsp;represent the (sometimes divergent) glosses of the interpreters&nbsp;rather than the actual provisions of the statute. Reconstruction&nbsp;has. therefore been a work of difficulty, and the results far from&nbsp;satisfactory, that of the latest editor, Voigt, departing very considerably from the versions generally current during the last half-</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In form the laws contained in the fables were of remarkable brevity, terseness and pregnancy, with something of a rythmical&nbsp;cadence that must have greatly facilitated their retention&nbsp;in the memory. Rarely, if ever, were the rules they&nbsp;embodied permissive; they were nearly all in the im-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">E</span><span class="font1">erative mood, sometimes entering into minute detail ut generally running on broad lines, surmounting instead of removing difficulties. Their application might cause hardship in&nbsp;individual instances, as when a man was held to the letter of what&nbsp;he had declared in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nexum qt</span><span class="font1"> mancipation, even though he had&nbsp;done so under error or influenced by fraudulent misrepresentations;&nbsp;the decemvirs admitted no exceptions, preferring a hard-and-fast rule&nbsp;to any qualifications that might cause uncertainty. The system&nbsp;as a whole is one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oi jus</span><span class="font1"> as distinguished from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fas.</span><span class="font1"> In the royal laws&nbsp;execration </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(sacratio capitis, sacer esto)</span><span class="font1"> was a. common sanction;&nbsp;but in the Tables it occurs only once pure.and simple, and that with&nbsp;reference to an offence that could be committed only by a patrician,—&nbsp;material loss caused by a patron to his client </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(patronus, si clients&nbsp;fraudem faxsit, sacer esto).</span><span class="font1"> In. all other cases the idea that a crime&nbsp;was an offence against public order, for which the community&nbsp;was entitled in self-protection to inflict punishment on the&nbsp;criminal, is prominent. Hanging and beheading, flogging to death,&nbsp;burning at the stake, throwing from the Tarpeian rock,—such are&nbsp;secular penalties that are met with in the Tables; but often, though&nbsp;not invariably, the hanging and so forth is at the same time declared&nbsp;a tribute to some deity to whom the goods of the criminal are&nbsp;forfeited </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(consecratio bonorum).</span><span class="font1"> The Tables also recognize the system&nbsp;of self-help.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus*injectio</span><span class="font1"> of the third Table—the.execution done by a creditor against his debtor—was probably in essence the same&nbsp;procedure as under the kings, but with the addition of some regulations intended to prevent its abuse. Against a thief taken in the act&nbsp;the same procedure seems to have been sanctioned; it w<sup>T</sup>as lawful&nbsp;to kill him.on the spofif the theft was nocturnal, or even when it&nbsp;was committed during the day if he used arms in resisting his&nbsp;apprehension. According to Cicero there was a provision in these&nbsp;words: “ si telum manu fugit magis quam jecit, arietem subicito&nbsp;this is perhaps just a re-enactment in illustrative language of the&nbsp;law attributed to Numa, that for homicide by misadventure—&nbsp;“ if the weapon have sped from the hand rather than been aimed ”—&nbsp;a ram was to be tendered as a peace-offering to the kinsmen of him&nbsp;who had been slain. The original purpose must have been to stay&nbsp;the blood revenge, but in the Tables it can only have been intended&nbsp;to stay the prosecution .which it was incumbent on the kinsmen&nbsp;of a murdered.man to institute. So with talionic penalties: “si&nbsp;membrum rupit ni cum eo pacit, talio esto ”—such, according&nbsp;to Gellius, were the words of one of the laws of the Tables, and they&nbsp;undoubtedly recognize talion, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a&nbsp;tooth while at the same time regulating it by enabling the&nbsp;injured man to bring an action and sanctioning a money recompense&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Wehrgeld)</span><span class="font1"> in lieu of it.<sup>@@5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The structure of the provisions of the Tables was not such as to enable the plain citizen to apply them to concrete cases, or to-know how to claim the benefit of them in the tribunals,&nbsp;without some sort of professional advice. Pomponius states&nbsp;that no sooner was the decemviral legislation published&nbsp;than the necessity was felt for its interpretation, and for the&nbsp;preparation by skilled hands of styles of actions by which&nbsp;its provisions might be made effectual. Both of these duties fell to-the pontiffs as the only persons who, in the state of civilization of the&nbsp;period, were well qualified to give the assistance required; and Pomponius adds that the college annually appointed one of its members to-be the adviser of private parties and of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judiccs</span><span class="font1"> in those matters.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">interpretatio,</span><span class="font1"> commenced by the pontiffs and continued by the&nbsp;jurists during the Republic, which, Pomponius says, was regarded as-part of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font1"> was not confined to explanation of the words of&nbsp;the statute, but was in some cases their expansion, in others their</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
