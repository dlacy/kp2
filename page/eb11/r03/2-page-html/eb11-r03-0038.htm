<p><span class="font1">that at first the grooves were made straight, with the object of admitting a tight-fitting bullet and relieving the effects of&nbsp;fouling, and that the virtue of spiral grooving was subsequently&nbsp;discovered by accident. But this theory is unsupported. The&nbsp;earliest known rifle barrels have spiral grooving. The amount&nbsp;of turn varied in old rifles from a half or three-quarters turn&nbsp;to one turn in two to three feet. The form and depth of the&nbsp;grooving and the number of grooves also greatly varied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Development of Military Rifles.—</span><span class="font1">For the chief infantry firearms that preceded the modern military rifle, see&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gun, Arms and Armour</span><span class="font1"> (firearms), </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arquebus, &amp;c.</span><span class="font1"> Rifles&nbsp;were at first used for amusement. There are, however, instances of their occasional employment in war in the 17th&nbsp;and 18th centuries. In 1631 the landgrave of Hesse had&nbsp;a troop of riflemen. Ten years later Maximilian of Bavaria&nbsp;had several troops armed with rifled arquebuses. Louis XIII.&nbsp;armed his bodyguard with rifles. Napoleon withdrew the rifle&nbsp;from those of his troops to whom it had been issued during the&nbsp;wars of the Republic, nor did the French make any considerable&nbsp;use of it again until 1830, when the Chasseurs dOrleans were&nbsp;armed with it for the invasion of Algeria. The British learnt&nbsp;the value of rifles during the American War of Independence,&nbsp;when the government subsidized continental </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jägers</span><span class="font1"> armed&nbsp;with rifles to oppose the American riflemen. After the war&nbsp;these corps disappeared, and though they are now represented&nbsp;by the 60th (King’s Royal) Rifles, the senior rifle corps in the&nbsp;British Army is the Rifle Brigade, raised in 1800 as the 95th Regiment and armed with a flint-lock weapon known as “ Baker’s&nbsp;Rifle, ” which weighed 9</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">j </span><span class="font0">lb</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">. </span><span class="font1">The barrel was 2 j ft. long, its&nbsp;calibre 20-bore, with seven grooves making a quarter-turn in&nbsp;its length. A small wooden mallet was at first supplied with&nbsp;this rifle to make the ball enter the barrel, and it was loaded&nbsp;with great difficulty. In 1826 Delvigne, a French infantry&nbsp;officer, invented a breech with abrupt shoulders on which the&nbsp;spherical bullet was rammed down until it expanded and filled&nbsp;the grooves. The objection was that the deformed bullet had&nbsp;an erratic flight. Delvigne’s system was subsequently improved&nbsp;upon by Thouvenin, who introduced into the breech an iron&nbsp;stem, upon which the bullet, now of conical form, rested, and&nbsp;was expanded by a sharp blow with the iron ramrod when&nbsp;loading. In William IV.’s reign the Brunswick percussion&nbsp;rifle@@<sup>1</sup> was introduced into the British rifle regiments. Its weight&nbsp;with bayonet was 11 lb 5I oz.; length of barrel, 2 ft. 6 in.,&nbsp;with two grooves making one turn in the Iengthofthebarrel;&nbsp;weight of spherical belted bullet, 557 grs.; diameter, 704 in.;&nbsp;charge of powder, 2 j drs. This rifle was not easily loaded, soon&nbsp;fouled, and shot wild beyond 400 yds.lenght  W. Greener produced a new expansive bullet, an oval&nbsp;ball, a diameter and a half in length, with a flat end, perforated,&nbsp;in which a cast metallic taper plug was inserted. The explosion&nbsp;of the charge drove the plug home, expanded the bullet, filled&nbsp;the grooves and prevented windage. A trial of the Greener&nbsp;bullet in August 1835 proved successful. The range and&nbsp;accuracy of the rifle were retained, while the loading was made&nbsp;as easy as with a smooth-bore musket. The invention was,&nbsp;however, rejected by the military authorities on the ground&nbsp;that the bullet was a compound one. In 1852 the Government&nbsp;awarded Minié, a Frenchman, £20,000 for a bullet of the same&nbsp;principle adopted into the British service. In 1857 Greener&nbsp;received a belated reward of £1000 for “ the first public suggestion&nbsp;of the principle of expansion. ” The Minie bullet contained an&nbsp;iron cup in a cavity at the base of the bullet. In 1851 a rifled&nbsp;musket of the Minie pattern was introduced into the British&nbsp;army, and, though not generally issued, was used in the Kaffir&nbsp;War of 1851, and in the Crimea. Its weight with bayonet&nbsp;was 10 Ib 81 oz., length of barrel 3 ft. 3 in., with four grooves&nbsp;making one turn </span><span class="font0">in</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">72 in.; diameter of bore -702 inch;</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup>The percussion principle, invented by the Rev. Alexander John Forsyth (1768-1843) in 1805, was not accepted for military arms&nbsp;until the introduction of this rifle. A small and belated money&nbsp;grant was made to Forsyth in 1843.

<p><span class="font1">charge of powder 2J drs., and sighted from 100 to 1000 yds The form of its bullet was at first conoidal, afteiwards changed&nbsp;to cylindro-conoidal, with a hemispherical iron' cup. In 1855&nbsp;the Enfield rifle, having in a series of trials competed favourably&nbsp;with the Minié and Lancaster rifles, was introduced into the&nbsp;British army; it was used during the latter part of the Crimean&nbsp;war, having there replaced the Minié rifle and the percussion&nbsp;musket,· and remained the general weapon of the er,tire infantry&nbsp;until the introduction of the breech-loader in the year 1867.&nbsp;This rifle weighed, with bayonet, 9 Ib 3 oz., barrel 39 in.;&nbsp;diameter of bore -577 in.; three-grooved, with one turn in&nbsp;78 in. It fired a bullet of cylindro-conoidal form with&nbsp;hollow base, weighing 530 grains, made up into cartridges and&nbsp;lubricated as for the Minié rifle, adapted to this rifle by Pritchett,&nbsp;who was awarded £1000 by the Government. This bullet was&nbsp;wrapped in greased paper round the cylindrical part half-way&nbsp;up its length. Short rifles of the same pattern, with five-grooved&nbsp;barrels 2 ft. 9 in. long and a sword bayonet, were supplied&nbsp;to the 60th Rifles and to the Rifle Brigade. Two small carbines&nbsp;of the same principle were at this time introduced for the cavalry&nbsp;and artillery, also a rifled pistol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1854, on the suggestion of General Lord Hardinge, Sir Joseph Whitworth, the first mechanician of the day, began to&nbsp;consider the subject of rifling, and after a long series of experiments the Whitworth rifle was produced with hexagonal bore,&nbsp;45-in. calibre, and with one turn in 20 in. It was tried at&nbsp;Hythe in 1857, and completely defeated the Enfield rifle up to&nbsp;1800 yds. upon a fixed rest. This trial and Whitworth’s experiments proved the advantages of a sharp twist, a smaller bore,&nbsp;and elongated projectile; but Whitworth’s rifle was never&nbsp;adopted into the Government service, probably because the&nbsp;hexagonal rifling wore badly, and owing to the difficulty of&nbsp;equal mechanical perfection in all similar rifles and ammunition.&nbsp;Several improvements were subsequently made in the sighting,&nbsp;grooving and some other details of the Enfield rifle. In 1855 a&nbsp;boxwood plug to the bullet was used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Between 1857 and 1861 four breech-loading carbines were experimentally introduced in the cavalry—viz. Sharp’s, Terry’s,&nbsp;Green’s, and Westley-Richards’. Sharp’s and other breechloading carbines and also Spencer repeating carbines were used&nbsp;by the Federal cavalry in the American Civil War. The gcneraI&nbsp;adoption of the breech-loading principle may be said to&nbsp;date from 1867. The Prussians were the first to see its great advantages, and adopted the celebrated needle-gun(q.va bolt-action weapon. In 1864</span></p>
