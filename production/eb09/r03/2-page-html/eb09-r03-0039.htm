        <p><span class="font1">and more inevitable. Under what circumstances and conditions the
                separation actually took place is not now known. We may be sure, however, that it
                was not brought about&nbsp;without violent internal commotions; it is probable
                even&nbsp;that the edict of Claudius itself may have had its occasion&nbsp;in these.
                The remark of Suetonius </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >(Claud.,</span><span class="font1"> 25) readily&nbsp;admits of being interpreted in
                such a sense: “Judaeos&nbsp;impulsore Chresto@@<sup>1</sup> assidue tumultuantes
                Roma expulit.”&nbsp;So interpreted, these words contain our first notice of
                the&nbsp;Christian Church in Rome; its earliest constitution must&nbsp;have taken
                place precisely then. For, as has already been&nbsp;seen, the edict of banishment
                was probably never carried&nbsp;out, or at all events did not continue long in
                force. Unfortunately, we do not know the date of it, but it must&nbsp;have belonged
                to the later years of Claudius, for in the&nbsp;beginning of his reign the
                disposition of that emperor&nbsp;towards the Jews was friendly (Jos., </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Antiq.,</span><span class="font1"> xix. 5).
                In&nbsp;its context also Acts xviii. 2 implies a late rather than an&nbsp;early
                date, say about 50-52 a.d. ; and there is nothing&nbsp;against this in the
                circumstance that the edict is mentioned&nbsp;by Dio Cassius towards the beginning
                of his account of&nbsp;that reign, for in that particular passage the author
                is&nbsp;characterizing his subject in a general way and not referring&nbsp;to events
                in their chronological sequence.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">If the foregoing suppositions are correct, Paul’s epistle to the
                church at Rome was written some six or eight years&nbsp;after its formation. Paul
                was staying in Corinth at the&nbsp;time, in the last month before the eventful
                journey to&nbsp;Jerusalem which led to his captivity (58 a.d.). The evidence that
                the epistle was written during this last sojourn&nbsp;in Greece, which is only
                briefly alluded to in Acts xx. 2, 3,&nbsp;is simple and conclusive. We know from the
                Epistles to&nbsp;the Corinthians that shortly before this stay the apostle&nbsp;had
                set on foot throughout the churches of Macedonia and&nbsp;Achaia a collection on
                behalf of the needy church at&nbsp;Jerusalem (1 Cor. xvi.; 2 Cor. viii.-ix.). This
                collection&nbsp;it was his wish to carry in person from Corinth (1 Cor.&nbsp;xvi.
                3-6; 2 Cor. i. 16; Acts xxiv. 17). But the Epistle&nbsp;to the Romans was written,
                as we learn from the author&nbsp;himself (Rom. xv. 21-28), when the collection had
                just&nbsp;been concluded and he was on the point of taking it with&nbsp;him to
                Jerusalem,—in other words, before his departure&nbsp;from Corinth, but not long
                before.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">We have now to inquire into the motive which led the apostle
                precisely at such a juncture to address a communication so full and elaborate as
                this to the Christian community at Rome, with which he had no personal acquaintance.
                In general terms we have it from himself at the&nbsp;beginning and end of the
                epistle (i. 8-15, xv. 14 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >sq.~).</span><span class="font1"> He&nbsp;had proclaimed the gospel in all the East
                from Jerusalem&nbsp;to Illyricum (xv. 19). He regarded his work in
                these&nbsp;quarters as for the present finished, and he felt impelled&nbsp;to preach
                Christ crucified also in the West. He was&nbsp;already looking towards Spain (Rom.
                xv. 24, 28). He&nbsp;wished first to take the collection to Jerusalem, and,
                that&nbsp;once accomplished, his labours in the West were to begin&nbsp;forthwith.
                But there, in Rome, the metropolis of the&nbsp;world, a community already existed
                which had come into&nbsp;being apart from any effort of his. For his activity in
                the&nbsp;West it was obviously of the utmost importance to secure&nbsp;the
                organization for himself and his message. Should its&nbsp;attitude be cold, he would
                be left without any secure base&nbsp;of operations. The purpose of the present
                epistle, then, is,&nbsp;to speak generally, this: to secure a connexion with
                the&nbsp;community at Rome, to gain it for himself and the gospel&nbsp;he carried.
                But had it hitherto been without that gospel </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">1&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The community was at
                any rate already a Christian one.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">And, if perhaps it was in need of fuller teaching, why did he not
                wait until he arrived in person in Rome in order&nbsp;to give it ? Surely he could
                have done this more effectually by word of mouth than by a written treatise.
                Why,&nbsp;then, did he send this written message before him ? There&nbsp;must have
                been some perfectly definite circumstances which&nbsp;led him to take this course.
                The nature of these will&nbsp;become clear to us when we seek to ascertain what at
                that&nbsp;juncture was the state of the Christian community in&nbsp;Rome.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Assuming that church to have arisen out of the midst of the Jewish
                community of the place, the most obvious&nbsp;conjecture is that at the period of
                the present letter it still&nbsp;continued to consist mainly of Jewish Christians,
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span
                class="font1"> that&nbsp;the majority of its members were Jews by birth who
                even&nbsp;after their conversion to Christ still continued to regard&nbsp;the Mosaic
                law in its totality as binding on them. This&nbsp;is the view which Baur in
                particular sought to establish,@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>as against the previously
                prevailing belief in the Gentile&nbsp;Christian character of the church in question.
                Baur’s&nbsp;position was adopted by many subsequent critics, the most&nbsp;careful
                and elaborate defence of it, though with many&nbsp;modifications in detail, being
                that of Mangold.@@<sup>3</sup> An intermediate position between the older view and
                that of Baur&nbsp;has been sought by Beyschlag,@@<sup>4</sup> who works out the
                theory&nbsp;that the Christian community in Rome may possibly have&nbsp;been Jewish
                Christian in its way of thinking, yet at the&nbsp;same time Gentile Christian in its
                origin. In direct&nbsp;opposition to Baur, on the other hand, Theodor
                    Schott@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>has again maintained the older view as to its
                Gentile&nbsp;character, and in all essential points this is also defended&nbsp;by
                    Weizsacker,@@<sup>6</sup> who, however, recognizes in Baur’s hypothesis certain
                elements of truth by which the older theory&nbsp;must be corrected and
                supplemented.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In presence of the facts we are compelled to adopt the view of
                Weizsacker as on the whole the right one. For&nbsp;the Jewish Christian character of
                the church Baur and&nbsp;Mangold, besides the argument from its presumable
                origin,&nbsp;have adduced a number of isolated texts. On the majority&nbsp;of these
                Mangold no longer lays any stress, since they&nbsp;admit of being otherwise
                interpreted. Thus when Paul&nbsp;designates Abraham as “our father” (top
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">irpoird.Topa
                rjpuov,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">iv. 1) he indeed includes his readers under
                the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rjpMV.</span><span
                class="font1"> But&nbsp;in 1 Corinthians, an epistle certainly addressed to a
                church&nbsp;of Gentile Christians, the fathers of Israel are also called&nbsp;“our
                fathers” (1 Cor. x. 1). The Christian Church is in&nbsp;point of fact the true
                Israel; hence the patriarchs of Israel&nbsp;are its “fathers.”@@<sup>7</sup> In
                another place (Rom. vii. 1) Paul&nbsp;addresses his readers as persons “who know the
                law.”&nbsp;But this holds true not of born Jews alone but of Gentile&nbsp;Christians
                as well, to whom also the Old Testament was a&nbsp;sacred book. Mangold finds an “
                irrefragable evidence of&nbsp;the Jewish Christian character of the community in
                Rome”&nbsp;in Rom. vii. 4 : “ye also, beloved brethren, have died to&nbsp;the law ”
                (k&lt;xi 7/xets </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">edavarud'qTe

                have&nbsp;died to it they must of course have once lived under it:&nbsp;so argues
                Mangold quite correctly. But the inference that</span></p>
