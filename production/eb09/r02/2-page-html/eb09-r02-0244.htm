<p><span class="font0">The writers who adopt this view are far from being unanimous as to details. But there seems to be enough to render it more than&nbsp;probable that, at an intermediate stage between the vera solida vis&nbsp;of ancient times and the vis civilis et festucaria which Gellius and&nbsp;Gaius depict, there was a procedure by appeal to the gods through&nbsp;means of oaths of verity sworn by the parties, in the manner and&nbsp;with the consequences that have been indicated. That in time it&nbsp;should have dropped out of the ritual is quite in the order of things.&nbsp;Its tendency was to become a mere form, imposing no real restraint&nbsp;on reckless litigation. The restraint was rather in the dread of&nbsp;forfeiture of the sacramental cattle, sheep, or money that would&nbsp;follow a verdict that an oath had been unjust. And it must have&nbsp;been felt besides that it was unfair to brand a man as a false-swearer, needing to expiate his offence by an offering to the gods,&nbsp;whose oath had been perfectly honest. That he should suffer a&nbsp;penalty for his imprudence in not having taken more care to ascertain&nbsp;his position, and for thus causing needless annoyance to others,&nbsp;was reasonable, but did not justify his being dealt with as one&nbsp;who had knowingly outraged the deity to whom he had appealed.&nbsp;So the oath — the original sacramentum—disappeared, the name&nbsp;passing by a natural enough process to the money which had been&nbsp;wont to be deposited before the oath was sworn, but which now&nbsp;ceased to be an offering in expiation by a false-swearer, and became&nbsp;a mere penalty of rash litigation (poena temere litigantis).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be assumed that in most cases the finding of the cen-tumvirs as to the justness or unjustness of the respective sacraments of the parties was the end of the case,—that it was at once accepted&nbsp;and loyally given effect to. Festus, however, preserves a law of the&nbsp;XII. Tables which, according to Mommsen’s rendering, declared&nbsp;that, when it turned out that interim possession had been awarded&nbsp;to the wrong party, it was to be in the latter’s power to demand&nbsp;the appointment of three arbiters who should ascertain the value&nbsp;of the object of vindication and its fruits, and assess the damages&nbsp;due for non-restitution at double the amount. This provision&nbsp;seems to have been intended to afford the wrongful interim possessor,&nbsp;who was not in a position to make specific restitution to his successful opponent, a means of avoiding the apprehension and imprisonment which were the statutory consequences of failure to implement a judgment. It is probable that in time this duplicated&nbsp;money payment came to be regarded as the satisfaction to which&nbsp;the successful party in a vindication was entitled in every case in&nbsp;which, no matter for what reason, he was unable to obtain the&nbsp;thing itself and its fruits from their interim possessor ; that consequently an arbitrium litis aestimandae, or reference to arbiters&nbsp;to assess their value, resulted in every such case ; and that it was&nbsp;to assure its payment that the prætor required the party to whom&nbsp;the interim possession was awarded to give to his opponent the&nbsp;sureties (precedes litis et vindiciarum) to whom Gaius alludes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After this explanation of the procedure in the sacramental action for vindication of land it is unnecessary to enter into any detail&nbsp;of what was done when it was a movable that was being vindicated,&nbsp;or when the action was a personal one for payment of money. The&nbsp;real action about a movable was of course simpler than that&nbsp;described ; for the thing was always in prαesentia. As regards personal actions, the ordinarily received opinion, which rests, however,&nbsp;on slender foundations, is that from the first the parties met on&nbsp;equal terms ; that, if it was a case of money debt, the creditor&nbsp;commenced the proceedings with the averment that the defendant&nbsp;owed him the sum in question,—“I say that you ought to pay me&nbsp;(dare oportere) 1000 asses” ; that this was met with a denial ; and&nbsp;that a sacramental challenge followed on either side. All are agreed&nbsp;that the remit was to a single judex after an interval of thirty&nbsp;days from the proceedings in jure ; that where the claim was for a&nbsp;definite sum the plaintiff had to establish his case to the letter ;&nbsp;and that his sacrament was necessarily declared unjust if he failed&nbsp;to prove his claim by a single penny. But there is considerable&nbsp;diversity of opinion as to whether by this form of process a claim&nbsp;of uncertain amount could be insisted on,—as, for example, for&nbsp;damages for breach of a warranty of acreage of lands sold, or of&nbsp;their freedom from burdens. If it could, then probably the question raised and dealt with Sacramento was the abstract one of&nbsp;liability,—Was the warranty given, and has it failed ? the sum due&nbsp;in respect of the breach being left to be dealt with in a subsequent&nbsp;arbitral process (arbitrium litis aestimandae').</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Legis Actio per Judicis Postulationem.</span><span class="font0">@@<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span class="font1">The defects of the Verona MS. have deprived us of Gaius’s account of&nbsp;this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio.</span><span class="font1"> There is little elsewhere that can with&nbsp;any certainty be said to bear upon it. The most important is a note in Valerius Probus—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T.PRH.A. V.P. V.D.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which is generally interpreted—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">te, praetor, judicem arbi-trumve postulo uti des.</span><span class="font1"> This petition to the magistrate&nbsp;—king, consul, prætor—to appoint a judge, arbiter, or&nbsp;arbiters (as the case might be) in all probability was part&nbsp;of the procedure in the action, and that from which it&nbsp;derived its distinctive name. Beyond this all is conjecture,&nbsp;alike as to the nature and form of the action and the&nbsp;cases to which it was applicable. Gaius says of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis&nbsp;actio Sacramento</span><span class="font1"> that it was general, and that it was the&nbsp;procedure that was to be resorted to where no other was&nbsp;prescribed by statute. The extant fragments of the XII.&nbsp;Tables contain no such indications as this would lead us&nbsp;to expect ; there is not a hint in them of an express&nbsp;instruction that proceedings in any particular case were to&nbsp;be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per judicis postulationem.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font0">While it is impossible with certainty to trace the history of this procedure to its first beginnings, yet the impression is general that&nbsp;it must have originated in the regal period. There were three different positions in which an appeal for aid might be made to a&nbsp;court of justice,—(1) when it was a question of civil right that had&nbsp;to be decided in terms directly affirmative or directly negative of&nbsp;the contention of the raiser of the action, and one in which questions of both law and fact were involved ; (2) when it was only a&nbsp;question of fact that had to be ascertained,—the legal result of the&nbsp;fact, if established, being known beforehand ; (3) when facts had to&nbsp;be set against facts, and a result arrived at that in the judgment&nbsp;of those who had to balance them was fair and reasonable in the circumstances. In the first case, as when the contention was meum&nbsp;esse or dari oportere (otherwise than under an obligationary nexum),&nbsp;the procedure was sαcramento and the reference originally (in all&nbsp;probability) to the pontiffs, although afterwards to the centumviral&nbsp;court or to a judex ; in the second, as when the question was—had&nbsp;or had not the defendant assaulted the plaintiff, and so incurred&nbsp;the invariable statutory penalty, the reference was probably to a&nbsp;judex without the intervention of a sacrament ; in the third, as&nbsp;when the matter in hand was the partitioning of an inheritance&nbsp;amongst co-heirs, or the determining whether operations of the defendant were interfering with the natural drainage of the plaintiff’s&nbsp;land and how the mischief was to be abated, or the assessment of&nbsp;damages for injury to property, or of the sum sufficient to relieve&nbsp;from talion or the statutory penalty of theft, the reference was to an&nbsp;arbiter or arbiters. In the procedure Sacramento the pleadings&nbsp;opened directly with an averment of right—“I say that this is&nbsp;mine,” “ I say that the defendant is bound to pay me so much ” ;&nbsp;but in that per judicis arbitrive postulatio there is reason to surmise&nbsp;that they commenced with an averment of fact, followed by the&nbsp;resulting demand of the plaintiff. The details, however, are quite&nbsp;uncertain, with the exception that in some arbitria the plaintiff&nbsp;expressly threw himself upon the discretion of the arbiters—quantum&nbsp;aeqius melius est ob cam rem mihi dari.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Legis Actio per Condictioηem.—</span><span class="font1">This the youngest “ action of the law ” was introduced, Gaius says, by the&nbsp;Silian law as a means of recovering a liquid money debt&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lperta pecunia),</span><span class="font1"> and afterwards made available by the Cal-purnian law for enforcing personal claims (as distinguished&nbsp;from real rights) for anything else definite and certain&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(pmηis res certa),</span><span class="font1"> and in both its forms, therefore, essentially an action of debt. The date of both enactments is&nbsp;matter of controversy, although there is no question that&nbsp;the Silian was the earlier. Gaius says of it that its purpose was far from obvious, as there was no difficulty in&nbsp;recovering money either by a sacramental action or one&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per judicis postulationem.</span><span class="font1"> He overlooks the fact that&nbsp;money due under a πexal contract was recoverable by&nbsp;neither of these processes, but by the much more summary&nbsp;one of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus injectio.</span><span class="font1"> By the Pœtilian law of 428 this&nbsp;was declared unlawful. We are disposed to regard the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Silia</span><span class="font1"> and the new procedure it authorized as a result&nbsp;of the change. To have put off a creditor for money lent&nbsp;either with a sacramental action or one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per judicis postulationem</span><span class="font1"> would have been to deprive him of the advantages&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus injectio</span><span class="font1"> to a greater extent than was called for.&nbsp;So it was provided by the Silian law that, when a man&nbsp;disputed his liability for what was called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia certa&nbsp;crédita,</span><span class="font1"> and forced his creditor to litigation, not only was&nbsp;the defendant bound in the first place either to deny his</span></p>
