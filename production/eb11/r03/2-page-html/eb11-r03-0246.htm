<p><span class="font0">the Empire was threatened by their projects of conquest beyond the Adriatic, projects which aimed at Constantinople itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Four great attempts against the Empire were made by the Normans; they were unsuccessful, but they heralded the Western&nbsp;conquest of 1204.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) Expedition of Robert Guiscard, 1081-85,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">repelled by Alexius with help of Venice (2) Bohemond's expedition, 1105-7. foiled by the able strategy of Alexius; (3) the invasion of Greece by Roger of Sicily, 1147; Venice supported&nbsp;Manuel Comnenus, and the Normans were driven from Corfu, 1149 ;&nbsp;(4) the expedition of William II. of Sicily, 1185, who succeeded in&nbsp;capturing Thessalonica; the invaders were defeated at Demetritsa,&nbsp;but they gained the islands of Cephallenia and Zacynthus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The two most important events in the reign of Alexius were the prices which he paid for help against his enemies. (1) He&nbsp;was obliged (1084) to grant to Venice (which had become&nbsp;independent of the Empire in the 9th century; see Venice),&nbsp;in return for her naval aid against the Normans, commercial&nbsp;privileges which practically made the Empire commercially&nbsp;dependent on the Republic. (2) He sought auxiliary forces in&nbsp;western Europe to help him against the Seljuks; the answer&nbsp;of the pope and Latin Christendom was the First Crusade—&nbsp;a succour very different from that which he desired. Through&nbsp;his tact and discretion, the state was safely steered through&nbsp;the dangers with which the disorderly hosts of barbarous allies&nbsp;menaced it, and the immediate results were salutary; large&nbsp;parts of Asia Minor, including Nicaea, were restored to the&nbsp;Empire, which was thus greatly strengthened in the East while&nbsp;the Turks were weakened (see Crusades). But for this help&nbsp;Byzantium might not have recovered the transient strength&nbsp;and brilliance which it displayed under Manuel. In Asia Minor&nbsp;the crusaders kept the terms of their agreement to restore to&nbsp;the emperor what had belonged to him; but on capturing&nbsp;Antioch (1098) they permitted the Norman Bohemond to retain&nbsp;it, in flagrant violation of their oaths; for to Antioch if to any&nbsp;place the emperor had a right, as it had been his a few years&nbsp;before. This was in itself sufficient to cause a breach between&nbsp;Byzantium and the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem (founded 1099).&nbsp;But otherwise the new political situation created by the Crusade&nbsp;was dangerous, ultimately fatal, to the Empire. For its lands&nbsp;and seas became a highway from western Europe to the Latin&nbsp;colonies in Syria; the Byzantine government was forced to&nbsp;take precautions to protect itself against the crusading expeditions which travelled to the Holy Land; and these precautions&nbsp;were regarded by the western powers as a hindrance to the&nbsp;sacred objects of the crusades. The bitter religious antagonism&nbsp;between the Greek and Latin Christians increased the mutual&nbsp;distrust and the danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The history of the new relations between East and West dating from the First Crusade is closely connected with the&nbsp;history of the futile attempts at bringing about a reunion&nbsp;between the Greek and Latin Churches, which had severed&nbsp;communion in 1054 (see below). To heal the schism and bring&nbsp;the Greek Churchunder the domination of Rome was a principal&nbsp;object of papal policy from GregoryVII. forward. The popes&nbsp;alternated between two methods for attaining this, as circumstances dictated: namely, a peaceful agreement—the policy of&nbsp;union; or an armed occupation of the Empire by some western&nbsp;power (the Normans)—the policy of conquest. Their views&nbsp;varied according to the vicissitudes of their political situation&nbsp;and their struggles with the western emperors. The eastern&nbsp;emperors were also constantly preoccupied with the idea of&nbsp;reconciliation, constantly negotiating with a view to union;&nbsp;but they did not care about it for its own sake, but only for&nbsp;political advantages which it might bring, and their subjects&nbsp;were bitterly opposed to it. Manuel Comnenus during the first&nbsp;part of his reign was the close friend and ally of the western&nbsp;emperor Conrad III., but after Conrad’s death, he formed the&nbsp;ambitious plan of realizing in Europe a sovereignty like that&nbsp;of Justinian, and hoped to compass it in conjunction with Rome,&nbsp;the enemy of the Hohenstaufen. His forward policy carried&nbsp;war into Italy; he seized Ancona. But his strength was&nbsp;unequal to such designs. His Latin sympathies, no less than&nbsp;his financial extravagance, made him highly unpopular at&nbsp;home; and the national lack of sympathy with his Western&nbsp;policy was exhibited—after the revolution which overthrew&nbsp;his son Alexius and raised his cousin Andronicus I. to the throne&nbsp;—by the awful massacre of the Latin residents at Constantinople in 1182, for which the expedition of William of Sicily (see&nbsp;above) and the massacre of the people of Thessalonica was the&nbsp;revenge. The short reign of the wicked and brilliant Andronicus&nbsp;was in all respects a reaction, prudent, economical and popular.&nbsp;His fall was due to the aristocracy against whom his policy&nbsp;’was directed, and the reign of Isaac Angelus undid his efforts&nbsp;and completed the ruin of the state. Oppressive taxation&nbsp;caused a revolt of the Bulgarian and Walachian population in&nbsp;the European provinces; the work of Zimisces and Basil was&nbsp;undone, and a new Bulgarian kingdom was founded by John&nbsp;Asen—a decisive blow to the Greek predominance which the&nbsp;Macedonian emperors seemed to have established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the fatal year 1204 the perils with which the eastward expansion of western Christendom (the Crusades, and the&nbsp;commercial predominance and ambitions of Venice) had long&nbsp;menaced the Empire, culminated in its conquest and partition.&nbsp;It was due to a series of accidents that the cloud burst at this&nbsp;moment, but the conditions of such a catastrophe had long&nbsp;been present. Isaac Angelus was dethroned by his brother&nbsp;Alexius III., and his son escaped (1201) to the west, where&nbsp;arrangements were being made for a new crusade, which Venice&nbsp;undertook to transport to the HolyLand. The prince persuaded&nbsp;Philip of Swabia (who had married his sister) and Boniface of&nbsp;'Montferrat to divert the expedition to Byzantium, in order to&nbsp;restore his father and himself to the throne, promising to furnish&nbsp;help to the Crusade and to reconcile the Greek Church with&nbsp;Rome; Venice agreed to the plan; but Pope Innocent III., the&nbsp;enemy of Philip, forbade it. Isaac and his son, Alexius IV.,&nbsp;were restored without difficulty in 1203, and the crusading&nbsp;forces were prepared to proceed to Palestine, if Alexius had&nbsp;performed his promises. But the manner of this restoration,&nbsp;under Latin auspices, was intensely unpopular; lie was not&nbsp;unwilling, but he was unable, to fulfil his pledges; and a few&nbsp;months later he was overthrown in favour of one who, if an&nbsp;upstart, was a patriot, Alexius V. Then the Crusaders, who&nbsp;were waiting encamped outside the city, resolved to carry out&nbsp;the design which the Normans had repeatedly attempted, and&nbsp;put an end to the Greek Empire. The leaders of the Fourth&nbsp;Crusade must be acquitted of having formed this plan deliberately before they started; it was not conceived before&nbsp;1204. They first arranged how they would divide the Empire&nbsp;amongst themselves (March); then they captured the city,&nbsp;which had to endure the worst barbarities of war. In partitioning the Empire, which was now to become the spoil of&nbsp;the conquerors, the guiding mind was the Venetian leader,&nbsp;the blind doge, Henry Dandolo. He looked to the interests of&nbsp;Venice from the narrowest point of view, and in founding the&nbsp;new Latin Empire, which was to replace the Greek, it was his&nbsp;aim that it should be feeble, so as to present no obstacles to&nbsp;Venetian policy. The Latin Empire of Romania was a feudal&nbsp;state like the kingdom of Jerusalem; the emperor was suzerain&nbsp;of all the princes who established themselves on Greek territory;&nbsp;under his own immediate rule were Constantinople, southern&nbsp;Thrace, the Bithynian coast, and some islands in the Aegean.&nbsp;But he was hampered from the beginning by dependence on&nbsp;Venice, want of financial resources, and want of a fleet; the&nbsp;feudal princes, occupied with their separate interests, gave him&nbsp;little support in his conflict with Greeks and Bulgarians; at&nbsp;the end of ten years the worthless fabric began rapidly to&nbsp;decline, and the efforts of the popes, for whom it was the means&nbsp;of realizing Roman supremacy in the East, were unavailing to&nbsp;save it from the extinction to which it was doomed in its cradle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The original Act of Partition (which gave } of the Byzantine territory to the future emperor, | to Venice, the remaining j to&nbsp;the Crusaders) could hardly be carried out strictly, as the territory&nbsp;was still to be won. . The most important vassal state was the&nbsp;kingdom of Ihessalonica, including Thessaly, which was assigned&nbsp;to Boniface of Montferrat. But it was conquered by the Greeks&nbsp;of Epirus Jn 1222. The chief of the territories taken by Venice</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
