<p><span class="font0">are the inlets ; and by their alternate contraction and relaxation, the air is swallowed and forced into the windpipe, so as to inflate the lungs. The tongue also contributes its&nbsp;share in carrying on this function. This organ is remarkable in its connection, being fixed very differently in these&nbsp;from what it is in most other animals. Its root is not situated deep down the throat, but is attached superficially&nbsp;at the fore-part of the lower jaw ; it is remarkably long,&nbsp;and instead of inclining forward, is turned backwards, extending down the throat, and so acts as a valve, affecting&nbsp;the entrance and exit of air from the lungs. If the mouth&nbsp;of the frog be forcibly kept open, it is suffocated, because&nbsp;it is deprived of the power of swallowing the required air ;&nbsp;and if the nostrils be closed, it in like manner can no longer&nbsp;breathe. Hence the frog and allied genera may be said&nbsp;rather to swallow air than to inhale it. Respiration, again,&nbsp;is not carried on, as in most animals, by the chest, but by&nbsp;the compression of the muscles of the abdomen ; and if these&nbsp;are in any way injured or destroyed, the breathing ceases,&nbsp;and the individual speedily dies. Nor is the function of&nbsp;respiration in the Batrachia confined to the lungs ; for the&nbsp;blood which circulates through the capillaries of the skin is&nbsp;likewise aerated by communication with the atmosphere.&nbsp;This kind of respiration, closely connected with the extraordinary perspiration for which these animals are celebrated,&nbsp;is of such importance to them, that if impeded by covering&nbsp;the skin with oil or other unctuous substance, death will&nbsp;take place almost as soon as if the lungs were removed ;&nbsp;and, on the other hand, the animal may be supported by it&nbsp;alone, for a considerable time, if the temperature be not&nbsp;too high,—a physiological fact which, we apprehend, goes&nbsp;a great way to account for the extraordinary power possessed by many of these creatures (to which we shall afterwards allude), of enduring, without detriment, a long&nbsp;protracted burial, enclosed in wood or stone</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reproductive act</span><span class="font0"> in these reptiles, somewhat intermediate between what occurs in terrestrial animals and fishes, is so remarkable that it must not be passed by. We&nbsp;shall borrow our illustration from what occurs in the frog,&nbsp;the genus by much the best known in the order. The&nbsp;embraces of the male occur only once a year, and in spring.&nbsp;As soon as the sun’s influence is felt in their wintry resorts,&nbsp;the black spongy knob at the base of the thumb of the&nbsp;male augments in size, and his abdomen swells. On finding his mate, he mounts on her back, extends his arms&nbsp;round her chest, and so locks the fingers of his hands into&nbsp;each other, that, from the peculiar structure, they cannot&nbsp;be separated. The two animals are thus inseparably joined, and so live and swim together for fifteen or twenty&nbsp;days, or even for a month. Ifj under these circumstances,&nbsp;the thumbs be cut off, the junction is at an end ; but if the&nbsp;animal be decapitated, the grasping apparatus still performs&nbsp;its mechanical office. During the period of this long embrace, the spawn, as in fish, escapes in long floating cords&nbsp;or chaplets, of a gclatinous fluid, crowded with the ova,&nbsp;which is bedewed with the milt of the male. When the&nbsp;spawning is completed, the male frog is able to dismount,&nbsp;the fingers Speedily regaining their flexibility, and the thumbs&nbsp;their ordinary form. The reproductive power is very great,&nbsp;the ova amounting to from 600 to upwards of 1000. Swammerdam once reckoned 1100 from a single individual, and&nbsp;Montbeiliard 1300.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is remarked that these animals live to a great age, if fortunate enough to escape the attacks of their enemies ;&nbsp;an instance will be given in the sequel, of an individual&nbsp;whose history was traced for forty years. Their foes,&nbsp;however, are very numerous. A number of quadrupeds,&nbsp;birds, reptiles, and fishes, live habitually at their expense. Serpents, pikes, vultures, and storks, destroy an immense&nbsp;number of them. Without the intervention of the last-named birds, Egypt, in particular, would swarm with frogs.&nbsp;In several countries, certain species are sought after by&nbsp;man ; and they are considered by competent judges as an&nbsp;agreeable and wholesome food. The Batrachia have no&nbsp;weapons either of offence or defence. Taken as an order,&nbsp;they are certainly as harmless to man as any tribe of animals ; and, as has been well remarked, though the forms&nbsp;of many of the species offend our notions of beauty, and&nbsp;their love-songs have gained them the character of “ horrible musicians,” there is certainly nothing to justify the&nbsp;aversion and distrust with which they are so usually regarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Batrachia generally feed upon the larvæ of aquatic insects, on worms, small mollusca, flies, &amp;c., and always&nbsp;choose a prey which is living and in motion. Dead and&nbsp;motionless animals are rejected by them. To obtain their&nbsp;prey, they often remain fixed in one situation, with wonderful patience, watching till they believe it is within their&nbsp;reach, and then darting at it with great rapidity, they at the&nbsp;same time protrude their lengthened tongue, bedewed all&nbsp;over with a viscid fluid. If we watch a frog when an insect&nbsp;has approached sufficiently near it, we are surprised to observe the insect suddenly disappear without our being able&nbsp;to perceive what has become of it. This arises from the&nbsp;frog having darted its tongue upon its victim with such&nbsp;extreme quickness, and again withdrawn it with the adhering insect, that it is scarcely possible for the eye to follow&nbsp;it in motion. Thus from the nature of their food, so far&nbsp;from being prejudicial, they are very useful in gardens, by&nbsp;extensively destroying those small slugs, &amp;c. which are so&nbsp;detrimental to plants of every kind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FAMILY RANIDÆ. @@<sup>1</sup> FROGS IN GENERAL.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the members of the frog family (corresponding to the great genus Rana of Linnæus), have in their perfect state&nbsp;four extremities and no tail. Their head is flat, their muzzle&nbsp;rounded, their mouth very large. In the greater number&nbsp;the tongue is not attached to the deeper part of the throat,&nbsp;but to the edge of the lower jaw, and thence proceeds backwards, and down the throat. Their front feet have only four&nbsp;toes, and their hind five, sometimes exhibiting the rudiments of a sixth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We cannot better bespeak a favourable conslderation for this despised group than in the words of an enthusiastic&nbsp;naturalist. “ We shall have considerable difficulty,” says&nbsp;the eloquent Lacépède, “ in assigning to frogs the place&nbsp;which they should occupy in the minds of our readers, such&nbsp;as it really is in nature ; but it is not less true, that if toads&nbsp;had never existed, if we had not before our eye this horrid&nbsp;object of comparison, which caricatures by its resemblance,&nbsp;as it defiles by its approach, the frog would appear to us as&nbsp;agreeable from its conformation, as distinguished by its qualities, and interesting from the phenomena it exhibits at the&nbsp;different periods of its existence. We would behold it as&nbsp;a useful animal, from which we have nothing to fear, whose&nbsp;instinct is harmless, which unites an elegant form with supple&nbsp;and slender limbs, and is adorned with pleasing colours,&nbsp;rendered more vivid from the kind of natural varnish with&nbsp;which the animal is constitutionally provided. And who&nbsp;can regard with pain a being whose form is light, whose&nbsp;movements are nimble, whose attitudes are graceful? Let&nbsp;us not deprive ourselves of an additional source of pleasure;</span></p>
