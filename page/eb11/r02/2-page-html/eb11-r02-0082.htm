<p><span class="font2">her firmly for a prolonged period, during which ova and spermatozoa are discharged simultaneously. Where internal fertilization occurs, there are usually special accessory organs. In the female, the terminal portion of the gonad-duct, or of the cloaca,&nbsp;is modified to receive the intromittent organ of the male, or to&nbsp;retain and preserve the seminal fluid. In the male, the terminal&nbsp;portion of the gonad-duct may be modified into an intromittent&nbsp;organ or penis, grooved or pierced to serve as a channel by which&nbsp;the semen is passed into the female. In arthropods, ordinary&nbsp;limbs may be modified for this purpose, or special appendages&nbsp;developed; in spiders, the terminal joints of the pedipalps, or&nbsp;second pair of appendages, are enlarged, and are dipped into the&nbsp;semen, which is sometimes shed into a special web, and are used&nbsp;as intromittent organs; in cuttlefish, one of the “ arms ” is&nbsp;charged with spermatozoa, is inserted into the mantle cavity&nbsp;of the female and there broken off. In many cases there is a&nbsp;temporary apposition of the apertures of the male and female,&nbsp;with an injection from the male without a special intromittent&nbsp;organ. The females are usually passive during coitus, and there&nbsp;are innumerable varieties of clasping organs developed by the&nbsp;male to retain hold of the female. Finally, the various secondary&nbsp;sexual characters which are developed in males and females and&nbsp;induce association between them by appeals to the senses, must&nbsp;be regarded as accessory reproductive organs and processes&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sex).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another set of accessory organs and processes are concerned with what may be termed in the widest sense of the phrase&nbsp;“ brood-care.” In many cases the relation between parent&nbsp;and offspring ceases with the extrusion of the fertilized ovum,&nbsp;whilst others display every possible grade of parental care. Many&nbsp;of the lower invertebrates choose special localities in which&nbsp;to deposit the ova or embryos, and glands, the viscid secretion&nbsp;of which serves to bind the ova together or to attach them to&nbsp;some external object, are frequently present. In many insects,&nbsp;elaborate preparations are made; special food-plants are&nbsp;selected, cocoons are woven, or, by means of the special organ&nbsp;known as the ovipositor, the eggs are inserted in the tissues&nbsp;of a living or dead host, or in other cases a supply of food is prepared and stored with the young larvae. The eggs or larvae&nbsp;may be attached to the parent and carried about with it, as&nbsp;in the gills of bivalves, the brood-pouches of the smaller Crustacea, the back of the Surinam toad, the vocal sacs of the frog&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhinoderma,</span><span class="font2"> the expanded ends of the oviducts or the marsupial pouch. In a large number of cases the young are nourished directly from the blood of the mother by some kind of&nbsp;placental connexion, as in some of the sharks, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anablebs,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">a bony fish, in some lizards and in mammals. In other cases,&nbsp;the young after birth or hatching are fed by the parents, by&nbsp;the special secretion of the mammary glands in the case of&nbsp;mammals, by regurgitated food in many birds and mammals,&nbsp;by salivary secretions or by food obtained and brought to the&nbsp;young by the parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reproductive Period.—</span><span class="font2">In a general way, reproduction begins when the limit of growth has been nearly attained, and the&nbsp;instances of paedogenesis, whether that be parthenogenetic&nbsp;as in midges, or sexual as in the axolotl, must be regarded as&nbsp;an exceptional and special adaptation. In lower animals,&nbsp;where the period of growth is short or indefinite, reproduction&nbsp;begins earlier and is more variable. But, in all cases, surrounding&nbsp;conditions play a great part in hastening or retarding the onset&nbsp;of reproduction. Increased temperature generaUy accelerates reproductive maturity, excess of food retards it, and&nbsp;sudden privation favours it. In a majority of cases it endures&nbsp;to the end of life, but in some of the higher forms, such as birds&nbsp;and mammals, there is a marked decrease or a cessation of&nbsp;reproductive activity, especially in the case of females, as&nbsp;life advances. In most animals, moreover, periods of reproductive activity alternate with periods of quiescence in&nbsp;a rhythmical series. In its simplest form, the rhythm is&nbsp;seasonal; but although at first associated with actual seasonal&nbsp;changes, it persists in the absence or alteration of these. Many&nbsp;animals brought to Europe from the southern hemisphere come&nbsp;into reproductive activity at the time of year corresponding&nbsp;to the spring or summer of their native home. “ Heat,”&nbsp;menstruation and ovulation in the higher mammals, including&nbsp;man, are rhythmical, and probably physiologically linked, but&nbsp;the ancestral meaning of the periodicity is unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reproduction and Increase of the Race.—</span><span class="font2">Two distinct factors are involved in this question—the potential fecundity of&nbsp;organisms, and the chances of the young reaching maturity.&nbsp;The first varies with ,the actual output of zygotes, and is&nbsp;determined partly by the reproductive drain on the individual,&nbsp;and especially the female in cases where the ova are provided&nbsp;with much food-yolk, partly on the duration of reproductive&nbsp;maturity, and partly on the various adaptive and environmental conditions which regulate the chances of the gametes&nbsp;meeting for fertilization. It is to be noted that as the gametes&nbsp;are simply cells proliferating from the germinal tissue,the potential number that can be produced is almost indefinite; and as&nbsp;it is found that in very closely allied forms the actual number&nbsp;produced varies within very wide limits, it may be assumed&nbsp;that potential fecundity is indefinite. The possibility of zygotes&nbsp;reaching maturity varies first with the individuation of the&nbsp;organism concerned—that is to say, the degree of complexity&nbsp;Ofitsstructure—and the duration of the period of its growth;&nbsp;and secondly, with the incidence of mortality on the eggs and&nbsp;immature young. It is plain that a parasite capable of living&nbsp;only on a particular host may give rise to myriads of progeny,&nbsp;and yet, from the difficulty of these reaching the only environment in which they can become mature, might not increase&nbsp;more rapidly than an elephant which carries a single foetus&nbsp;for about two years, and guards it for many years after birth.&nbsp;The probable adaptation of the variable reproductive processes&nbsp;to the average conditions of the race is discussed under the&nbsp;heading </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Longevity.</span><span class="font2"> It may be added here that the adaptation, in all successful cases, appears to be in excess of what&nbsp;would be required merely to replace the losses caused by death,&nbsp;and that there is ample scope for the Malthusian and Darwinian&nbsp;factors. The rate of reproduction tends to outrun the food-supply.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The various modes- in which plants reproduce their species may be conveniently classified into two groups, namely,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">v'egetalive propagation</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">true reproduction,</span><span class="font2"> the distinction&nbsp;between them being roughly this, that whereas in the former&nbsp;the production of the new individual may be effected by the&nbsp;most various parts of the body, in the latter it is always effected&nbsp;by means of a specialised reproductive cell.</span></p>
