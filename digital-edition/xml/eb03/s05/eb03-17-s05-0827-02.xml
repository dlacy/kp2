ςρατϓος in antiquity, an officer among the Athenians, whereof there were two choſen yearly, to command the troops of the ſtate.</p><p>Plutarch says, there was one choſen from out of each tribe ; but Pollux ſeems to ſay they were choſen indifferently out of the people. The people themſelves made the choice ; and that on the laſt day of the year, in a place called <hi rend="italic">Pnyx.</hi> The two st <hi rend="italic">rategy</hi> did not command together, but took their turns day by day ; as we find from Herodotus and Cornelius Nepos. Sometimes indeed, as when a perſon was found of merit vaſtly ſuperior, and exceedingly famed in war, the command was given to him alone : but it was ever a rule, not to put any person in the office but whoſe eſtate was in Attica, and who had children, that there might be ſome hoſtages and ſecurities for his conduct and fidelity. Conſtantine the Great, beſides many other privileges granted to the city of Athens, honoured its chief magiſtrate with the title of ϺεΓας ΣτϑαἸηος <hi rend="italic">Magnus Dux.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
