John was a nephew of Sir Philip Basset (d. 1271), the justiciar. He first appears as an official of Henry III. in Ireland and of Edward I. in both England and Ireland; he was appointed dean of St Patrick’s, Dublin, in 1275. In 1284 he was chosen archbishop of Dublin in succes-sion to John of Darlington; some, however, objected to this choice and Sandford resigned his claim; but was elected a second time while he was in Rome, and returning to Ireland was allowed to take up the office. In 1288, during a time of great confusion, the archbishop acted as governor of Ireland. In 1290 he resigned and returned to England. Sandford served Edward I. in the great case over the succession to the Scottish throne in 1292 and also as an envoy to the German king, Adolph of Nassau, and the princes of the Empire. On his return from Germany he died at Yarmouth on the 2nd of October 1294.</p><p>Sandford’s elder brother, Fulk (d. 1271), was also archbishop of Dublin. He is called Fulk de Sandford and also Fulk Basset owing to his relationship to the Bassets. Having been archdeacon of Middlesex and treasurer and chancellor of St Paul’s Cathedral, London, he was appointed archbishop of Duhlin by Pope Alexander IV. in 1256. He took some slight part in the government of Ireland under Henry III. and died at Finglas on the 4th of May 1271.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
