Here <hi rend="italic">aaa</hi>  is the framing ; <hi rend="italic">bbb,</hi>  sliver cans, mounted each in its frame <hi rend="italic">ccc,</hi>  which is furnished with a nipper at its upper bearing.</p><lb/><p>These can-frames run in brackets <hi rend="italic">dd, d'd',</hi>  fixed upon an upright spindle <hi rend="italic">ee ;</hi>  the bottom bracket <hi rend="italic">dd</hi>  is shown in the ground plan as a round plate, and the parts for the pivots of the can-frames to run in are raised upon it partly on each side. The spindle <hi rend="italic">ee</hi>  is made to revolve by means of a bevel-pinion <hi rend="italic">f</hi>  fixed upon it, which pinion gears into a wheel <hi rend="italic">gg</hi>  fixed upon the shaft <hi rend="italic">hh.</hi>  A belt from the pulley communicates motion to the main shaft <hi rend="italic">hh,</hi>  which carries a spur-pinion <hi rend="italic">h,</hi>  gearing into a wheel <hi rend="italic">l</hi>  fixed on the shaft mz«. Upon this shaft the cone <hi rend="italic">nn</hi>  is fixed, which by a belt drives the cone o, running loose upon the main shaft A. Upon the large end of this cone the bevel-wheel <hi rend="italic">p</hi>  is either cast or fixed ; and this gears into the pinion <hi rend="italic">q</hi>  fixed to the wheel <hi rend="italic">r,</hi>  the teeth of which are in its inner edge. This wheel with its pinion turns on the spindle <hi rend="italic">ee,</hi>  and its teeth gear into spur-pinions ss, fixed on the bottom of the can-frames. From the nippers at the top of the can-frame, each sliver is conducted to a separate hole near the top of the spindle ee ; these holes run upwards in an angular di</p><lb/><p>rection from under the bracket <hi rend="italic">i,</hi>  and meet in one which is carried to the top of the spindle, where is fixed a nipper similar to those of the can-frames. The roller <hi rend="italic">v</hi>  is for the purpose of pulling away the βtrand, cord, or rope, as it is formed ; and in this case is made slightly conical, so that by shifting it along its shaft, the speed with which it draws may be varied. The action of the machine will be easily comprehended. By the revolution of the spindle ee the can-frames are carried round a common centre ; and as they turn they receive a motion, each round its own axis, by means of the wheel <hi rend="italic">r</hi>  and the pinions ss. If sliver be put into the cans and carried through their nippers, they will be twisted into yarns between the nippers and the holes in the upright spindle, and by the revolution of the spindle they will be combined so as to form a strand or cord. If in place of slivers strands be used, the result will be a rope. The patentee further describes machinery for the formation of flat ropes, or bands for mines and the like purposes.</p><p>Having thus, as far as in our power, given an account of the progressive improvement of the art by the application of machinery, we shall conclude with a description of the most improved forms of machines and apparatus used in laying ropes in the present day.</p><p>When the yams have been spun upon Mr Lang’s or other spinning machines, or by hand, they are wound from the bobbins in a haul, upon a large octagonal reel about eight or nine feet diameter : the number of yarns in the haul are, of course, regulated by the conveniences of the manufactory. The haul is then passed from this reel through the tar-kettle, and, after undergoing the action of the nippers, is again wound upon a similar reel. From this reel the yams are wound singly upon the reels or bobbins to be used in the laying. The bobbins, with their yams, are then hung in frames, and the further machinery used is an improved form of Mr Chapman’s locomotive apparatus. The whole arrangement of these parts will be better understood from the drawings. In the drawings the connection of the different parts with the moving power is not shown. This may be steam, water, or any other power, and may be placed in any convenient situation, so as best to serve all the purposes of the establishment.</p><p>Figs. 25 and 26 show the general arrangement of the winding apparatus ; fig. 25</p><p>an end view, and fig. 26 a</p><p>back view, of a portion of</p><p>the winding-table, <hi rend="italic">aa,</hi>  reel</p><p>about eight feet diameter,</p><p>on which the haul is wound ;</p><p><hi rend="italic">bb,</hi>  frame containing eight</p><p>bobbins or reels <hi rend="italic">ccc,</hi>  fas</p><p>tened on vertical spindles</p><p><hi rend="italic">dd,</hi>  on the lower end of which the pulleys <hi rend="italic">ee</hi>  are fixed ; on the horizontal shaft a corresponding number of pulleys are fixed, to drive those of the vertical shaft by belts. One end of the horizontal shaft carries a fast and loose pulley <hi rend="italic">g,</hi></p></body></text></TEI>
