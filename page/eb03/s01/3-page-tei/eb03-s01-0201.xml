He had received repeated invitations to return to his allegiance: but all of them being rejected, he was proclaimed a traitor ; and the Scottiſh governor made a formal demand of him from king Henry. With this the latter not only refuſed to comply, but renewed his league with the lord of the iſles. He pretended alſo, that at this time he had intercepted ſome letters from the Scottiſh regency, which called him “a traitor in the higheſt degree;” and he alleged this as a reaſon why he protected not only the earl of March but the lord of the Iſles.</p><p>On the 25th of July 1400, the earl of March renounced his homage, fealty, and ſervice, to the king of Scotland, and transferred them to Henry by a formal indenture. For this the earl was rewarded with a penſion of 500 merks Sterling, and the manor of Clipeſtone in Sherwood foreſt. Henry now began to revive the claim of homage from the kings of Scotland, and even to meditate the conqueſt of the kingdom. He had indeed many reaſons to hope for ſucceſs; the principal of which were, the weakneſs of the Scottiſh government, the divided ſtate of the royal family, and the diſſenſions among the chief nobility. For this purpoſe he made great preparations both by ſea and land; but before he ſet out on his journey, he received a letter from the duke of Rotheſay, full of reproaches on account of the preſumptuous letters which Henry had addreſſed to Robert and his nobility. The letter was addreſſed by the duke to his adverſary of England, as the Scots had not yet recognized the title of Henry to the crown of England. Towards the end of it the duke, according to the cuſtom of the times, deſired Henry, in order to avoid the effuſion of Chriſtian blood, to fight him in perſon with two, three, or an hundred noblemen on a ſide. But this challenge produced no other anſwer from Henry, than that “he was ſurpriſed that the duke of Rotheſay ſhould conſider noble blood as not being <hi rend="italic">Christian,</hi> ſince he deſired the effuſion of the one, and not of the other.” Henry arrived at Leith on the very day in which he had appointed the Scottiſh nobility to meet him and pay their homage, and conclude a peace between the two crowns. In all probability, he expected to have been joined by great numbers of the diſcontented Scots; and he flattered the Engliſh with a promiſe of railing the power and glory of their country to a higher pitch than it had ever known. Under this pretext, he ſeized upon the sum of 350,000 pounds in ready money, beſides as much in plate and jewels, which had been left by Richard in the royal treaſury. He railed alſo vaſt contributions on the clergy and nobility, and likewiſe on the principal towns and cities. At laſt, finding that neither his vaſt preparations, nor the intereſt of the earl of March, had brought any of the Scots to his ſtandard, he formed the ſiege of Edinburgh caſtle, which was defended by the duke of Rotheſay, and, as ſome ſay, by the earl of Douglas. The duke of Albany, brother to king Robert, was then in the field with an army, and ſent a letter to king Henry, promiſing, that if he would remain where he was for ſix days, he would give</p><p>him battle, and force him to raiſe the ſiege, or loſe his life. When this was written, the duke was at Caldermuir; and Henry was ſo much pleaſed with the letter, that he preſented the herald who delivered it with his upper garment, and a chain of gold; promiſing, on his royal word, that he would remain where he was until the appointed day. On this occaſion, however, the duke forfeited his honour; for he ſuſſered ſix days to elapſe without making any attempt on the Engliſh army.</p><p>Henry, in the mean time, puſhed on the ſiege of Edinburgh caſtle; but met with ſuch a vigorous reſiſtance from the duke of Rotheſay, that the hopes of reducing it were but ſmall. At the ſame time he was informed that the Welſh were on the point of rebellion under the famous chieftain named <hi rend="italic">Owen Glendower. </hi>He knew alſo that many of the Engliſh were highly diſſatisfied with his title to the crown; and that he owed his peaceable poſſeſſion of it to the moderation of the earl of March, who was the real heir to the unfortunate Richard, but a nobleman of no ambition. For theſe reaſons he concluded it belt to raiſe the ſiege of Edinburgh caſtle, and to return to England. He then agreed to a truce for ſix weeks, but which was afterwards prolonged, probably for a year, by the commiſſioners of the two crowns, who met at Kelſo.</p><p>In 1401, Scotland ſuffered a great loſs by the death of Walter Trail, the archbiſhop of St Andrew’s, a moſt exemplary patriot, and a perſon of great influence. Archibald Douglas the Grim had died ſome time before, and his loſs was now ſeverely felt; for the king himſelf, naturally feeble, and now quite diſabled by his age and infirmities, was ſequeſtered from the world in ſuch a manner, that we know not even the place of his residence during the laſt invaſion of Scotland by the Engliſh. This year alſo queen Anabella died, ſo that none remained who might be able to heal thoſe diviſions which prevailed among the royal family. Robert duke of Albany, a man of great ambition, was an enemy to the duke of Rotheſay, the heir-apparent to the crown; and endeavoured, for obvious reaſons, to impreſs his father with a bad opinion of him. This prince, however, appears to have been chargeable with no miſdemeanour of any conſequence, excepting his having debauched, under promiſe of marriage, the daughter of William Lindſay of Roſſy. But this is not ſupported by any credible evidence; and, though it had been true, could never juſtify the horrid treatment he met with, and which we are now about to relate.</p><p>One Ramorgny, a man of the vileſt principles, but an attendant on the duke of Rotheſay, had won his confidence; and, perceiving how much he relented the conduct of his uncle the duke of Albany, had the villany to ſuggeſt to the prince the diſpatching him by aſſaſſination The prince rejected this infamous propoſal with ſuch horror and diſpleaſure, that the villain, being afraid he would diſcloſe it to the duke of Albany, informed the latter, under the ſeal of the moſt inviolable ſecrecy, that the prince intended to murder him; upon which the duke, and William Lindſay of Roſſy his aſſociate in the treaſon, reſolved upon the prince’s death. By practiſing upon the doating king, Lindſay and Ramorgny obtained a writ directed to the duke of Albany, impowering him to arreſt his ſon, and to keep him under reſtraint, in order for his amendment.
