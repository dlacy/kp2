<p><span class="font4">amount of correct pruning will improve a rose bush that has been badly planted or placed in a quite unsuitable position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Where dwarf beds of roses are required, a good plan is to peg down to within about 6 in. from the ground the strong one-year-old shoots from the root. In due time blooming shoots break out&nbsp;from nearly every eye, and masses of flowers are secured, while&nbsp;strong young shoots are thrown up from, the centre, the plant&nbsp;being on its own roots. Before winter sets in, the old shoots which&nbsp;have thus flowered and exhausted themselves, are cut away, and&nbsp;three or four or more of the strongest and best ripened young shoots&nbsp;are reserved for pegging down the following season, which should be&nbsp;done about February, fn the meantime, after the pruning, has been&nbsp;effected, plenty of good manure should have been dug in lightly&nbsp;about the roots. Thus treated, the plants never fail to produce&nbsp;plenty of strong wood for pegging down each succeeding season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The most troublesome fungoid pest of the rose is undoubtedly the mildew </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Sphaerotheca pannosa).</span><span class="font4"> The young shoots, leaves ana&nbsp;flower-buds frequently become covered with a delicate white&nbsp;mycelium, which by means of the suckers it sends into the underlying cells robs its host of considerable amounts of food, and causes&nbsp;the leaves to curl and fall early. The spores are produced in great&nbsp;abundance and carried by animals and the wind to other plants, and&nbsp;so the disease is rapidly spread. Later the mycelium increases and&nbsp;forms a thick velvety coating on the young shoots, and in this.the&nbsp;winter state of the fungus is produced. . Spraying with potassium&nbsp;sulphide (i oz. to 2 to 3 gallons of water) is the best means of checking the spread of the disease. The rose rust </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Phragmidium sub-corticatum)</span><span class="font4"> appears on both cultivated and wild roses in the spring,&nbsp;bursting through the bark in the form </span><span class="font3">of </span><span class="font4">copious masses of orange&nbsp;powder consisting of the spores of the fungus. These spores infect&nbsp;the leaves, and produce on them in the summer small.dots of an&nbsp;orange colour and, later, groups of spores that are able to live through&nbsp;the winter. The last, the teleutospores, are of a dark colour, and&nbsp;it is by these that the disease is started in the spring. It is therefore&nbsp;important that all the affected leaves should be destroyed in the&nbsp;autumn, and the bushes should be sprayed with Bordeaux mixture&nbsp;or ammoniacal copper carbonate in the spring to prevent the&nbsp;infection of the leaves by spores brought from a distance. Many&nbsp;other fungi attack the rose, but perhaps the only other one that&nbsp;merits mention here is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Actinonema Rosae.</span><span class="font4"> This attacks the leaves,&nbsp;forming large dark blotches upon them and frequently causing them&nbsp;to fall prematurely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A very large number of insect pests are found upon the rose, but the best known and most formidable on account of their great&nbsp;powers of reproduction are the aphides. More than one species is&nbsp;found upon the rose, though </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Aphis Rosae</span><span class="font4"> is the commonest. Their&nbsp;attack should be checked by the use of a spray made by boiling&nbsp;4 oz. quassia.chips for an hour or so in a gallon of soft water, straining&nbsp;off the solution and dissolving therein 4 oz. of soft soap while it is&nbsp;still warm, afterwards adding 1 or 2 gallons of soft water according&nbsp;to the age of the rose leaves that are to be sprayed. Any delay in&nbsp;dealing with the pest gives the opportunity for its increase, even&nbsp;a day being sufficient materially to augment their numbers. The&nbsp;larvae of some of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Tortrix</span><span class="font4"> moths fola the leaves almost as soon as&nbsp;they arc developed from the bud, and do considerable damage in&nbsp;this way and by devouring the leaves, while several ” looper ”&nbsp;caterpillars are also found feeding on the foliage. Many species of&nbsp;saw-fly larvae are also known to attack the rose, feeding either upon&nbsp;the leaves or devouring the young shoot. These larvae should be&nbsp;carefully searched for and destroyed whenever found. One of the&nbsp;leaf-cutting bees, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Megachile,</span><span class="font4"> cuts pieces out of the leaves with which&nbsp;to line its nest, materially reducing their effective surface. The&nbsp;bees may be caught in a butterfly net or traced to their nests, which&nbsp;should be destroyed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSEBERY, ARCHIBALD PHILIP PRIMROSE, 5TH </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Earl </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">of</span><span class="font4"> (1847“&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), British statesman, born in London on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">7th of May 1847, was the grandson and successor to the title of Archibald John Primrose, 4th earl of Rosebery (1783-1868),&nbsp;a representative peer of Scotland, who was in 1828 created a&nbsp;peer of the United Kingdom as Baron Rosebery, and was an&nbsp;active supporter of the Reform Bill. The Scottish earldom&nbsp;was first conferred in 1703 upon the 4th earl’s great-grandfather,&nbsp;Archibald Primrose of Dalmeny (1664-1723), a staunch Whig&nbsp;and a commissioner for the Union. The 5th earl’s mother was&nbsp;Catherine Lucy Wilhelmina, only daughter* of Philip Henry,&nbsp;4th Earl Stanhope; she was thus a sister of Earl Stanhope,&nbsp;the historian, and a niece of Lady Hester Stanhope, who was&nbsp;the niece of William Pitt. A celebrated beauty, a maid of&nbsp;honour and bridesmaid of Queen Victoria, she married, on the&nbsp;20th of December 1843, Archibald, Lord Dalmeny (1809-1851),&nbsp;member for the Stirling Burghs, who became a lord of the&nbsp;admiralty under Melbourne. After his death she became the&nbsp;wife of Harry George Vane, 4th duke of Cleveland, and died&nbsp;in 1901.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The young Lord Dalmeny was educated at Brighton and at Eton, where he had as slightly junior contemporaries Mr A. J.&nbsp;Balfour and Lord Randolph Churchill. He was described by&nbsp;the most brilliant Eton tutor of his day, William Johnson Cory&nbsp;(author of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ionica),</span><span class="font4"> as a “ portentously wise youth, not, however, deficient in fun.” He added that Dalmeny “ desired&nbsp;the palm without the dust.” In 1866 he matriculated at&nbsp;Christ Church, Oxford, but went down in 1868, by the request&nbsp;of the dean, rather than abandon the possession of a small&nbsp;racing stud. In the same year he succeeded to the earldom&nbsp;and to the family estates. In February 1871 he seconded the&nbsp;Address in the House of Lords; a more original effort followed&nbsp;in November 1871, when he delivered a remarkable essay on the&nbsp;Union of Scotland and England at the Edinburgh Philosophical&nbsp;Institution. Three years later he was elected president of the&nbsp;Social Science Congress at Glasgow, where, on the 30th of&nbsp;September, he gave a striking address upon the discovery of&nbsp;means for raising the condition of the working class as the&nbsp;“ true leverage of empire.” In the meantime he travelled&nbsp;in the south of Europe and in North America. On his return&nbsp;he acquired an English country house called The Durdans,&nbsp;Epsom, which he largely rebuilt and adorned with some of the&nbsp;finest turf portraits of George Stubbs. Following the example,&nbsp;as he declared, of Oliver Cromwell (for whom he showed an&nbsp;admiration in other respects—culminating in 1900 in the erection&nbsp;of a statue outside Westminster Hall, which was not appreciated&nbsp;either by the Irish Nationalist party or by others among his&nbsp;political associates), he took a pride in owning racehorses, and&nbsp;afterwards won the Derby three times, in 1894, 1895 and 1905.&nbsp;He was the first man to enjoy the distinction of winning the&nbsp;Derby while prime minister; but though this was popular&nbsp;enough among many classes, it did not please the Liberal Nonconformists so much, who considered a racehorse a mere&nbsp;gambling-machine. On the 20th of March 1878 Lord Rosebery&nbsp;married Hannah, only child of Baron Meyer Amschel de Rothschild, of Mentmore, Bucks. The newly married couple took a&nbsp;lease of Lansdowne House, which for several years was a salon&nbsp;for the Liberal party and a centre of hospitality for a much&nbsp;wider circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Though impeded in his political career by his exclusion from the House of Commons, Lord Rosebery’s reputation as a social&nbsp;reformer and orator was steadily growing. In 1878 he was&nbsp;elected Lord Rector of Aberdeen and in 1880 of Edinburgh&nbsp;University, where he gave an eloquent address upon Patriotism.&nbsp;In 1880 he entertained Mr Gladstone at Dalmeny, and during&nbsp;the “ Mid Lothian campaign ” he had much to do with the&nbsp;stage-management of the demonstrations. As was shown&nbsp;later, he imported into his view of politics a warm sentiment&nbsp;and an imaginative outlook; and he was an enthusiastic&nbsp;student of Lord Beaconsfield’s political novels, more particularly of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Sybil, </span><span class="font4">after the heroine in which he named&nbsp;one of his daughters. In August i88r he became undersecretary at the Home Office, his immediate chief being Sir&nbsp;William Harcourt. His work was practically confined to&nbsp;the direction of the Scottish department of the Office. A&nbsp;clamour was nevertheless' raised in regard to the incompatibility of the under-secretaryship with a position in the&nbsp;House of Lords, and Lord Rosebery resigned the post in June&nbsp;1883. He and his wife utilized the interval to make a trip&nbsp;round the world, being most warmly received in Australia, and&nbsp;returning by way of India. At the close of 1884 he resumed&nbsp;office as first commissioner of works with a seat in the cabinet,&nbsp;and his adherence carried with it a distinct accession of strength&nbsp;to the Liberal ministry, which was much discredited by the&nbsp;tragedy attached to the fate of Gordon. The attitude of the&nbsp;government on the Afghan question and generally in regard to&nbsp;Russia was held by many to have been perceptibly stiffened&nbsp;owing to Lord Rosebery’s influence.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
