<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ralſtaff.</span><span class="font1"> Nay, you ſhall hear, Maſter Brook, what I have buffer’d to bring this woman to evil for your&nbsp;good. Being thus cramm’d in the baſket, a couple of&nbsp;Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were call’d forth by their&nbsp;miſtreſs, to carry me in the name of foul clothes to&nbsp;Datchet-lane. They took me on their ſhoulders, met&nbsp;the jealous knave their maſter in the door, who aſk’d&nbsp;them once or twice what they had in their baſket. I&nbsp;quak’d ſor fear, left the lunatic knave would have&nbsp;ſearch’d it ; but Fate, ordaining he ſhould be a cuckold, held his hand. Well, on went he for a ſearch,&nbsp;and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the ſe-quel, Maſter Brook. I ſuffer’d the pangs of three&nbsp;egregious deaths : firſt, an intolerable fright, to be&nbsp;detected by a jealous rotten bell-weather ; next, to be&nbsp;compaſs’d like a good bilbo, in the circumference of&nbsp;a peck, hilt to point, heel to head ; and then to be&nbsp;ſtopt in, like a ſtrong diſtillation, with ſtinking clothes&nbsp;that fretted in their own greaſe. Think of that, a&nbsp;man of my kidney ; think of that, that am as ſubject&nbsp;to heat as butter ; a man of continual diſſolution and&nbsp;thaw ; it was a miracle to 'ſcape ſuffocation. And in&nbsp;the height of this bath, when I was more than half&nbsp;ſtew’d in greaſe, like a Dutch </span><span class="font0">diſli, </span><span class="font1">to be thrown into&nbsp;the Thames, and cool’d glowing hot, in that ſurge,&nbsp;like a horſe-ſhoe ; think of that ; hilſing hot ; think&nbsp;of that, Mr Brook.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RITE, among divines, denotes the particular </span><span class="font0">man</span><span class="font1">ner of celebrating divine ſervice in this or that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RITORNELLO, or Repeat, in muſic, the burden of a ſong, or the repetition of the firſt or other verſes&nbsp;of a ſong at the end of each couplet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RITTERHUSIUS (Conrad), a learned German civilian, born at Brunſwick in 1560. He was pro-feſſor of civil law at Altdorf, and publiſhed a variety&nbsp;of works, particularly as a civilian ; together with an&nbsp;edition of Oppian in Greek and Latin : he was moreover an excellent critic ; his notes upon many eminent&nbsp;authors having been inſerted in the heft editions of them.&nbsp;He died in 1613.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RITUAL, a book directing the order and manner to be obſerved in performing divine ſervice in </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">particular church, dioceſe, or the like. The ancient&nbsp;heathens had alſo their rituals, which contained their&nbsp;rites and ceremonies to be obſerved in building a city,&nbsp;conſecrating a temple or altar, in ſacriſicing, and deifying, in dividing the curiæ, tribes, centuries, and&nbsp;in general, in all their religious ceremonies. There&nbsp;are ſeveral paſſages in Cato’s books, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De re Raſtica,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which may give us ſome idea of the rituals of the ancients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIVAL, a term applied to two or more perſons who have the ſame pretenſions ; and which is properly&nbsp;applied to a competitor in love, and figuratively to an&nbsp;antagoniſt in any other purſuit.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><a name="caption1"></a><h1><span class="font4">RIVER,</span></h1>
<p><span class="font3">I</span><span class="font1">S a current of ſreſh water, flowing in a Bed or Channel from its ſource to the ſea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The term is appropriated to a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">conſiderable</span><span class="font1"> collection of waters, formed by the conflux of two or more Baooκs, which deliver into its channel the united&nbsp;ſtreams of ſeveral Rivulets, which have collected the&nbsp;ſupplies of many Rills trickling down from number-leſs ſprings, and the torrents which carry off from the&nbsp;ſloping grounds the ſurplus of every ſhower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rivers form one of the chief features of the ſurface of this globe, ſerving as voiders of all that is immediately redundant in our rains and ſprings, and alſo as&nbsp;boundaries and barriers, and even as highways, and&nbsp;in many countries as plentiful ſtorehouſes. They alſo&nbsp;fertiliſe our foil by laying upon our warm fields the&nbsp;richeſt mould, brought from the high mountains, where&nbsp;it would have remained uſeleſs for want of genial heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Being ſuch intereſting objects of attention, every branch acquires a proper name, and the whole acquires&nbsp;a ſort of perſonal identity, of which it is frequently&nbsp;difficult to find the principle ; for the name of the&nbsp;great body of waters which diſcharges itſelf into the&nbsp;ſea is traced backwards to one of the ſources, while&nbsp;all the contributing ſtreams are loſt, although their waters form the chief part of the collection. And ſometimes the feeder in which the name is preſerved is ſmall-er than others which are united to the current, and&nbsp;which like a rich but ignoble alliance loſe their name&nbsp;in that of the more illuſtrious family. Some rivers indeed are reſpectable even at their birth, coming at once&nbsp;in force from ſome great lake. Such is the Rio de la&nbsp;Plata, the river St Laurence, and the mighty ſtreams&nbsp;which iſſue in all directions from the Baical lake. But,&nbsp;like the ſons of Adam, they are all of equal deſcent,&nbsp;and ſhould take their name from one of the feeders of&nbsp;theſe lakes. This is indeed the caſe with a few, ſuch&nbsp;as the Rhone, the Rhine, the Nile. Theſe, after having mixed their waters with thoſe of the lake, reſume&nbsp;their appearance and their name at its outſet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But in general their origin and progreſs, and even the features of their character, bear ſome reſemblance&nbsp;(as has been prettily obſerved by Pliny) to the life of&nbsp;man. The river ſprings ſrom the earth ; but its origin&nbsp;is in heaven. Its beginnings are inſigniſicant, and its&nbsp;infancy is frivolous ; it plays among the flowers of </span><span class="font2">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">meadow ; it waters a garden, or turns a little mill.&nbsp;Gathering ſtrength in its youth, it becomes wild and&nbsp;impetuous. Impatient of the reſtraints which it ſtill&nbsp;meets with in the hollows among the mountains, it is&nbsp;reſtleſs and fretful ; quick in its turnings, and unſteady&nbsp;in its courfe. Now it is a roaring cataract, tearing&nbsp;up and overturning whatever oppoſes its progreſs, and&nbsp;it ſhoots headlong down from a rock ; then it becomes&nbsp;a ſullen and gloomy pool, buried in the bottom of </span><span class="font2">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">glin. Recovering breath by repoſe, ſt again daſhes&nbsp;along, till tired of the uproar and miſchief, ſt quits all&nbsp;that it has ſwept along, and leaves the opening of the&nbsp;valley ſtrewed with the rejected waſte. Now, quitting&nbsp;its retirement, it comes abroad into the world, journeying with more prudence and diforetion through cultivated fields, yielding to circumſtances, and winding&nbsp;round what would trouble it to overwhelm or remove.&nbsp;It paſſes through the populous cities and ail the buſy&nbsp;haunts of man, tendering its ſervices on every ſide, and&nbsp;becomes the ſupport and ornament of the country.&nbsp;Now increaſed by numerous alliances, and advanced</span></p>
