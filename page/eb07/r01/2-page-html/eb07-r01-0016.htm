<p><span class="font0">every other town throughout the whole tract of country, the inhabitants of which could avail themselves of the benefits of the railway, therefore, in using our figure, we&nbsp;must make the outer boundary lines (A), respectively&nbsp;curve right or left as the line of railway departs in either&nbsp;of those directions from the straight line (A). The values of&nbsp;(|i) may then be found and marked ready for use, as nearly&nbsp;as can be judged, by seeing where the stations would, it is&nbsp;presumed,be ultimately placed; then having ascertained the&nbsp;values of (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font0">) and (/() from the stamp-oflice returns, or any&nbsp;other equally authentic document, they may in each case be&nbsp;marked against the roads for all the towns which we may&nbsp;see fit to calculate upon for putting or not into the traffic&nbsp;returns, according as their inhabitants would gain or not by&nbsp;using the railway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will, on a very slight inspection, be self-evident, that for perhaps three-fourths of the whole space included within&nbsp;the lines (/&gt;) and (A), there will be no need of any calculation, ex-cept to shew the quantity of saving. In the earlier&nbsp;stages, therefore, if it is merely required to know the amount&nbsp;of traffic ; but only the doubtful places need be computed,&nbsp;and the rest may be deferred till it is desirable to complete&nbsp;the whole table. It must also be noted, that although a place&nbsp;may be actually without the boundary lines, yet there may&nbsp;not be a conveyance from it to either of the termini, as&nbsp;the case may be, and that the inhabitants, in order to be&nbsp;enabled to travel thither, may have to come to a place&nbsp;within the lines. They are then to be tried for as if they&nbsp;were themselves situated w-ithin-the lines, and, of course,&nbsp;all towns beyond the termini must benefit, when travelling&nbsp;towards the opposite end of the line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The effect of railways will be this: They can only be made upon main lines, because such lines will alone pay; the&nbsp;stage coaches will go off these lines when the railway has&nbsp;been a short time in operation, but the same coaches will&nbsp;be employed on cross country roads to feed the railway; and&nbsp;it is a curious fact, that through this operation one more&nbsp;coach was licensed at Liverpool and Manchester the year&nbsp;after the railway opened than there was the year before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the above rules be attended to, a tolerably correct knowledge of the traffic to be expected may be obtained, and it is sure notto be an exaggerated one. Whilst this has been going&nbsp;on, the engineer will have been employed in looking at the&nbsp;general features of the country preparatory to surveying&nbsp;and levelling it; and in most cases a man of a practised eye&nbsp;at this kind of work will be able at once to decide on all the&nbsp;principal points along which the line should go. During the&nbsp;same time the solicitor will have been feeling his way amongst&nbsp;the landowners and the occupiers, so that w here much dissent is manifested, that property may if possible be avoided.&nbsp;Landholders have been proverbially hostile to railways, and&nbsp;enormous in their demands for compensation, yet they have&nbsp;invariably found that their property has been benefited instead of being injured ; and when more land has been required from them, they have asked a higher price on account&nbsp;of that very railw ay running through their property, whose existence theyhadin the first instance declared to bea nuisance.&nbsp;This state of things cannot last much longer; but whilst it&nbsp;does, it must be met as far as possible in the above manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are many things to be taken into consideration before definitely fixing on the precise line in which a railroad is to run. Borings should be largely taken to obtain a correct geological knowledge of the various strata. A considerable subsequent expenditure may often be saved in this way.&nbsp;It is of no use to put a penny on our eyes to hinder us&nbsp;from seeing a guinea. Borings may be carried to any depth&nbsp;by sinking a well part of the way, and without this they&nbsp;have been worked to a depth of760 feet. The nature of the&nbsp;traffic must also be taken into consideration, so that when&nbsp;all other things are equal, the line may be run so as to include particular towns. The population of all the adjacent&nbsp;places should be ascertained and marked on a map; the nature of the various markets and fairs should be examined'&nbsp;into and the state of trade; the wants of persons connected&nbsp;with it ought also to be taken into account; the quantity&nbsp;and quality of the existing goods traffic, its nature, and the&nbsp;demands on it with reference to any probable increase ; and&nbsp;the capabilities of harbours, if any are w ithin reach of the&nbsp;line, their draught of water, the nature of the protection&nbsp;they afford, their present trade, and the effect of the railroad&nbsp;on that trade. In this, as well as in all other cases, the results&nbsp;of a transition from peace to w<sup>r</sup>ar, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa</span><span class="font0">, should be&nbsp;well considered, together w ith the effect of any future line&nbsp;of railway which may become a partially competing one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The more effectually these inquiries are made, and the more fully their results are honestly put before the proprietors, together with separate estimates for the engineering&nbsp;department and the managing department, so will their confidence in the undertaking increase; and it is a most essential point to place this confidence on a sure basis, so that&nbsp;if any little mishap, which none can avoid, take place, the&nbsp;shares may not be suddenly thrown on the market at a ruinous sacrifice, and the undertaking abandoned, through the&nbsp;projectors not having had the necessary information, to&nbsp;enable them to see that the result of their labours would&nbsp;be a profitable speculation, notwithstanding any trifling&nbsp;losses arising from causes against which perhaps no human&nbsp;foresight could provide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Railways with two lines of rails in very favourable si'ua</span><span class="font1">-1 </span><span class="font0">tions have been completed for L.10,000 per mile in Eng-i&nbsp;land. This however must be taken as the exception, and&nbsp;not the rule. Under very unfavourable circumstances they&nbsp;have cost L.50,000 per mile; and of course there will be&nbsp;found an expense per mile at all differences between these&nbsp;two, which may fairly be taken as the extreme limits. Now&nbsp;it is certain, that with a line 80 miles in length, a traffic of 75&nbsp;tons of goods per day from each end, or 120 passengers per&nbsp;day each way, or with 35 tons of goods and 60 passengers&nbsp;per day each way, the railway, if even constructed for&nbsp;L.12,000 per mile, which will rarely happen, would not afford a dividend of more than a quarter per cent, and (outnumbers throughout meaning daily each way) it would&nbsp;require 100 tons of goods, or 160 passengers, or 50 tons&nbsp;of goods and 80 passengers, to pay 1 per cent.; 125 tons&nbsp;of goods, or 200 passengers, or 62 tons of goods and 100&nbsp;passengers, would but little exceed If percent.; and it&nbsp;would take 200 tons of goods, or 320 passengers, or 100 tons&nbsp;of goods with 160 passengers, to pay 4j- per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Americans have such facilities for these constructions, that 1600 miles of railroad have been made in that country (a good deal of it, however, being only single line)&nbsp;at an average cost of only L.5081 per mile; whereas in England the mere permanent way alone would amount to L.4400&nbsp;per mile, if the rails were 45 lbs. to the yard, and laid upon&nbsp;longitudinal timbers ; L.4900 per mile, with rails 42 lbs.&nbsp;per yard, having chairs and cast-iron supports between&nbsp;them, on longitudinal timbers ; L.5300 per mile, with rails&nbsp;42 lbs. per yard, on blocks 3 feet apart; L.4800 per mile,&nbsp;with the same sized rails on wooden sleepers; L.5600 per&nbsp;mile for 62 lb. rails, on blocks 4 feet apart, and L.5100 for&nbsp;the same rails on wooden sleepers ; L.6000 per mile for&nbsp;rails of 75 lb. per yard on blocks 5 feet apart, and L.5500 per&nbsp;mile for the same on sleepers. These prices do not include&nbsp;laying the way, ballasting, and draining. Thus we see that&nbsp;the mere cost of the permanent way in the country, averaging L.5200 per mile, exceeds that of the whole expense&nbsp;of a complete railway in America; and 75 pound rails on&nbsp;blocksand sleepers, including laying, ballasting, sidings, turn-plates, and every expense, has exceeded L.8000 per mile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mean receipts forfive years on theLiverpool amlMan-chester line give the following proportions: Revenue 100,expenses 55, profits 45 ; and the expenses have been as high,</span></p>
