<p><span class="font0">Sage enlightens his whole narτative. It is a work which renders the reader pleased with himself and with mankind ;&nbsp;where faults are placed before him in the light of follies rather than vices ; and where misfortunes are so interwoven&nbsp;with the ludicrous, that we laugh in the very act of sympathizing with them. All is rendered diverting, both the&nbsp;crimes and the retribution which follows them.”@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though Le Sage rightly considered his characters as his chief object, he was well aware of the pleasing relief&nbsp;which might be given to his story by the judicious combination of the repose of landscape painting with the bustle&nbsp;of incident; and though he does not succeed in bringing&nbsp;before us, with the vividness of Cervantes, the sombre and&nbsp;parched plains or rugged mountain scenery of Spain, his&nbsp;work contains some country pictures, in a style of placid&nbsp;beauty, which are models of stillness, comfort, and serenity.&nbsp;To whom, for instance, does not that modest demesne at&nbsp;Lirias, watered by the Guadalaviar, with its mansion-house&nbsp;of four little pavilions, its garden bordered with orange trees,&nbsp;and ornamented with its basin of white marble, and the&nbsp;quaint, respectable, old Moorish furniture of the apartments,&nbsp;not to mention the olla podridas of Master Joachim, and&nbsp;the revenue of five hundred ducats a-year, rise up before&nbsp;the mind’s eye, as the very ideal of that happy rural retreat&nbsp;which, to each of us, is to be the Euthanasia of a life of&nbsp;carefulness and toil ; making us long for the time when we&nbsp;may be able to say with its fortunate possessor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Inveni portum ; spes et fortuna valete Sat me lusistis, ludite nunc alios.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is unnecessary to dwell long on the romances of the younger Crebillon, (1707—1777), as to which the only circumstance which is remarkable is, that so much frivolity of&nbsp;manner, and real poverty of invention, could have obtained a&nbsp;temporary popularity even by the licence in which they indulged ; yet that they were very popular for a time, we&nbsp;know ; for Sterne represents his fille de chambre inquiring, at a circulating library, for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Egarements du Cœur et&nbsp;de l’Esprit,</span><span class="font0"> in 1768. French writers, however, appear to&nbsp;recognise in his pictures some resemblance to the society&nbsp;ofthe time ; for D’Alembert says of him, “ he draws with&nbsp;a delicate and just pencil the refinement, the shades, and&nbsp;the graces of our vices.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Much higher talent, though, like Crebillon’s, stained by a shameful association with licentious and profligate pictures, appears in the romances of Diderot, (1713—1784).&nbsp;His talent as a narrator, in particular, was scarcely inferior&nbsp;to Voltaire’s. He had the picturesque particularity of Richardson, with a more condensed expression. It is not, however, in his larger and more notorious romances, such as&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Religeuse,</span><span class="font0"> that this talent is displayed. In these the&nbsp;tedium is as conspicuous as the indecency and impiety. It&nbsp;is in such short talcs as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ΐHistoire de Mademoiselle de la&nbsp;Chaux,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Deux Amis de la Bourbonne,</span><span class="font0"> short popular simple histories, contrasting strongly with that air of&nbsp;false simplicity, in reality tricked out with sentimental fard&nbsp;and tinsel, which Marmontel (1719—1798) has given to&nbsp;his amusing, but not very moral tales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The romances of Voltaire, (1694—1778), such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zadig, </span><span class="font0">the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Princess of Babylon, Bαbouh</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Candide,</span><span class="font0"> have but&nbsp;slender pretensions to the title. They are chiefly satirical&nbsp;fictions, or illustrations, in the form of a tale, of irreligious&nbsp;or antisocial opinions. Their wit, their biting irony, their&nbsp;familiarity with the baser parts of human nature, their&nbsp;power of rendering trifles pleasing by the art of narration,&nbsp;are undeniable; but we must not look in them for probable&nbsp;incident, for Voltaire generally chooses, as if on purpose,&nbsp;some extravagant oriental groundwork as his canvass, and&nbsp;borrows from Ariosto, from Gulliver, from the Arabian</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">Nights, or any source which suits his purpose ;—nor for the delineation of natural characters, for both the incidents and&nbsp;personages are merely made the instruments for working&nbsp;out the preconceived theorem. They produce their effect,&nbsp;such as it is, not by their fidelity to nature, but by the ingenious malice with which its features are distorted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the time of Marivaux downwards, the tendency of the French novel had been to narrow the province of incident, and to extend proportionally that of sentiment. With&nbsp;Rousseau, (1712—1778), this tendency reaches its height.&nbsp;The description of feelings, and particularly of such as,&nbsp;though often experienced, are seldom expressed in words,&nbsp;was his peculiar field. Invention, either of character or&nbsp;incident, he has none. To paint one strong passion, to&nbsp;invest vice with an air of insane but reasoning morality,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ To make matinées beautiful, and cast O’er erring deeds and thoughts a heavenly hue&nbsp;Of words like sunbeams, dazzling as they past</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">this is the main aim of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Julie,</span><span class="font0"> and the only one in which Rousseau has been at all successful. Even in this respect,&nbsp;too, the declamatory tone, the continued delirium of feeling, the total want of repose, which characterise the work,&nbsp;combined with the pedantry of its dissertations, become&nbsp;painful and oppressive. “ Ce sont des amans,” said Rousseau himself, speaking of his characters, “ et non pas des&nbsp;académiciens.” Never was an apology more misplaced. The&nbsp;real fault of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Julie</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">St. Preux</span><span class="font0"> is, that they have both too&nbsp;much of the academician in their composition, and too little&nbsp;of the lover, so far as the expression of natural passion in&nbsp;simple words is concerned. We have never been able, in&nbsp;reading the romance, to persuade ourselves that its real&nbsp;eloquence was not as dubious as its morality. It is not easy,&nbsp;indeed, in perusing Rousseau’s apostrophes to purity and&nbsp;virtue, to avoid thinking of the strange commentary which&nbsp;his practice furnished to his theory. It was said of Sterne&nbsp;with severity, but perhaps with some justice, that he could&nbsp;bestow upon a dead ass the pity which he denied to a living&nbsp;mother. And the man of nature and of truth, who expends&nbsp;his trembling sensibilities on paper, suffers a fellow-servant&nbsp;to be punished for the theft he had himself committed, and&nbsp;provides for his natural children in the foundling hospital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The total corruption of an exhausted society, tottering to its fall, with tile external varnish of gaiety and wit by&nbsp;which it tried to gild its decay, are aptly represented in the&nbsp;licentious romances of Louvet and La Clos ; its still more&nbsp;vulgar profligacy in the coarse and incoherent, but occasionally striking and original novels of Restif de la Bretonne,&nbsp;(1734—1806). The works of the two former writers are&nbsp;unfortunately but too well known ; the numerous and hasty&nbsp;productions of the eccentric printer, who was accustomed&nbsp;often to set up his strange compositions in type, without&nbsp;a manuscript, as the ideas occurred to him, are now almost&nbsp;completly forgotten. Yet Schiller and several eminent&nbsp;German critics, have spoken with high approbation of&nbsp;the vigour and talent which they evince in some parts,&nbsp;however defective or revolting in others. “ I have scarcely&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imagined</span><span class="font0"> any thing,” says Restif, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Drame dc la Vie;</span><span class="font0"> “ I&nbsp;have simply related ; my life has been so full of events, that&nbsp;I have made four-and-twenty volumes out of it.” Any one,&nbsp;indeed, who writes, as Laharpe says of Restif in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Correspondence Russe,</span><span class="font0"> under the persuasion, that all that he had&nbsp;seen, and thought, or learnt, deserved to be printed, and who&nbsp;acted faithfully on that principle, could hardly fail to produce compositions with very nearly the merits and demerits&nbsp;of the novels of Restif ; that is to say, with the coarseness of&nbsp;feeling which was natural to the man, with the disjointed air&nbsp;which a set of unconnected incidents from life must present,&nbsp;and yet with that degree of freslmess and truthfulness of&nbsp;painting, which sketches from life almost invariably possess,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
