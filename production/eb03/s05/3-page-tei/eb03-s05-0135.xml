One kind of clay resiſts the moſt violent action of the fire after being hardened to a certain degree, but is incapable of receiving a sufficient degree of hardneſs and ſolidity. A ſecond kind assumes a hardneſs reſembling that of flint, and ſuch a compactneſs that vessels made of it have a gloſſy appearance in their fracture reſembling porcelain. Theſe two ſpecies owe their peculiar properties of refitting heat without melting, to fand, chalk, gypſum or ferruginous earth, which they contain. A third ſpecies of clay begins to harden with a moderate fire, and melts entirely with a ſtrong fire. It is of the ſecond ſpecies that ſtone-ware is made.</p><p>The moſt famous manufactory of ſtone-ware, as well as of other kinds of pottery, is at Burſlem in Staffordſhire. This can be traced with certainty at leaſt two centuries back ; but of it3 first introduction no tradition remains.@@ In 1686, as we learn from Dr Plot’s Natural Hiſtory of Staffordſhire publiſhed in that year, only the coarſe yellow, red, black, and mottled wares, were made in this country ; and the only materials employed for them appear to have been the different coloured clays which are found in the neighbourhood, and which form ſome of the meaſures or ſtrata of the coal-mines. Theſe coarſe clays made the body of the ware, and the glaze was produced by powdered lead- ore, ſprinkled on the pieces before firing, with the addition of a little manganeſe for ſome particular colours. The quantity of goods manufactured was at that time ſo inconſiderable, that the chief ſale of them, the Doctor ſays, was “ to poor crate-men, who carried them on their backs all over the country.”</p><p>About the year 1690, two ingenious artiſans from Germany, of the name of Eller, fettled near Burſlem, and carried on a ſmall work for a little time. They brought into this country the method of glazing ſtone- ware, by caſting ſalt into the kiln while it is hot, and ſome other improvements of leſs importance ; but finding they could not keep their ſecrets to themſelves, they left the place rather in diſguſt. From this time various kinds of ſtone-ware, glazed by the fumes of ſalt in the manner above-mentioned, were added to the wares before made. The white kind, which afterwards became, and for many ſucceeding years continued, the ſtaple branch of pottery, is ſaid to have owed its origin to the following accident. A potter, Mr Aſtbury, travelling to London, perceived ſomething amiſs with one of his horſe’s eyes, an hoſtler at Dunſtable ſaid he could ſoon cure him, and for that purpoſe put a common black flint ſtone into the fire. The potter obſerving it, when taken out, to be of a fine white, immediately conceived the idea of improving his ware by the addition of this material to the whiteſt clay he could procure : accordingly he ſent home a quantity of the flint ſtones of that country, where they are plentiful among the chalk, and by mixing them with tobacco- pipe clay, produced a white ſtone-ware much ſuperior to any that had been ſeen before.</p><p>Some of the other potters ſoon diſcovered the ſource of this ſuperiority, and did not fail to follow his example. For a long time they pounded the flint ſtones in private rooms by manual labour in mortars ; but many of the poor workmen ſuffered ieverely from the duſt of the flint getting into their lungs, and producing dreadful coughs, conſumptions, and other pulmonary diſorders. Theſe diſaſters, and the increaſed demand for the flint powder, induced them to try to grind it by mills of various conſtructions ; and this method being found both effectual and ſafe, has continued in practice ever ſince. With theſe improvements, in the beginning of the preſent century, various articles were pro* duced for tea and coffee equipages. Soon after attempts were made to furniſh the dinner table alſo ; and before the middle of the century, utenſils for the table were manufactured in quantity as well for exportation as home conſumption.</p><p>But the ſalt glaze, the only one then in uſe for thia purpoſe, is in its own nature ſo imperfect, and the potters, from an injudicious competition among themſelves for cheapneſs, rather than excellence, had been so inattentive to elegance of form and neatneſs of work- manſhip, that this ware was rejected from the tables of perſons of rank; and about the year 1760, a white ware, much more beautiful and better glazed than ours, began to be imported In conſiderable quantities from France.</p><p>This inundation of a foreign manufacture, ſo much ſuperior to any of our own, muſt have had very bad effects upon the potteries of this kingdom, if a new one, ſtill more to the public taſte, had not appeared ſoon after. In the year 1763, Mr Joſiah Wedgwood, who had already introduced ſeveral improvements into this art, invented a ſpecies of earthen ware for the table quite new in its appearance, covered with a rich and brilliant glaze, bearing ſudden alternations of heat and cold, manufactured with eaſe and expedition, and con- ſequently cheap, and having every requiſite for the purpoſe intended. To this new manufacture the queen was pleaſed to give her name and patronage, commanding it to be called Queen's<hi rend="italic"> ware,</hi> and honouring the inventor by appointing him her majeſty’s potter.</p><p>The common clay of the country is uſed for the ordinary forts ; the finer kinds are made of clay from Devonſhire and Dorſetſhire, chiefly from Biddeford ; but the flints from the Thames are all brought rough by ſea, either to Liverpool or Hull, and ſo by Burton.
