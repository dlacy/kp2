<p><label>RÉMUSAT</label>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Abel</hi> (1788-1832), a distinguished Chinese scholar, was born at Paris, 5th September 1788. His father, a surgeon, superintended his early education in person and designed him for the medical profession. Jean Pierre Abel Rémusat graduated with distinction as M.D. in 1813, and for a short time held a hospital appointment, but his heart had long been in other studies. A Chinese herbal in the collection of the Abbé Tersan had attracted his attention when he was still a lad ; he taught himself to read by great perseverance and with very imperfect helps, and at the end of five years’ study he produced in 1811 an I <hi rend="italic">Essai sur la langue et la littérature Chinoises,</hi> and a paper on foreign languages among the Chinese, which procured him the patronage of De Sacy. In 1814a chair of Chinese was founded at the Collège de France, and Rémusat was ])laced in it. From this time he gave himself wholly to the languages of the Extreme East, and published a long series of useful works, among which his contributions from Chinese sources to the history of the Tartar nations claim special notice. Rémusat became an editor of the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Savants</hi> in 1818, and founder and first secretary of the Paris Asiatic Society in 1822 ; he held also in the courso of his life various honourable and lucrative Government appointments. He married in 1830, but had no children. He died at Paris, 4 th June 1832, and his <hi rend="italic">éloge</hi> was written by De Sacy.</p>
