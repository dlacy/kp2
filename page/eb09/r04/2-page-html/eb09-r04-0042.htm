        <p><span class="font1">styled the sixth great period of Russian legislation. The serfs,
                however, were not benefited by these changes. In&nbsp;1767 an ukaze forbade them to
                bring any complaints&nbsp;against their masters. The latter had the power of sending
                their serfs to Siberia as a punishment, or handing&nbsp;them over to be enlisted in
                the army. The public sale of&nbsp;serfs was not put an end to till the reign of
                Alexander I.&nbsp;The country was now divided into governments for the&nbsp;better
                administration of justice, each government being&nbsp;subdivided into </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uiezdi</span><span class="font1"> or
                districts. Catherine also took&nbsp;away from the monasteries their lands and serfs,
                and&nbsp;allotted them payments according to their importance from&nbsp;the state
                revenues. The plans of Peter I. were thus fully&nbsp;carried out, and the church
                became entirely dependent&nbsp;upon the state. In 1783 the Crimea was annexed
                to&nbsp;Russia. A second war with Turkey broke out in 1787;&nbsp;the Ottoman power
                had many grounds of complaint, but&nbsp;its suspicions were particularly aroused by
                the tour of&nbsp;Catherine through the southern provinces of Russia and&nbsp;her
                interviews with the emperor Joseph II. Turkey&nbsp;declared war that same year; and,
                to increase the embarrassed position of the empress, Sweden did the
                same,&nbsp;requiring from Russia the cession of the southern part of&nbsp;Finland
                which had been taken from her. But King&nbsp;Gustavus III., in spite of some petty
                successes, was unable&nbsp;to carry on the war, and soon signed the peace of
                Verela&nbsp;on the footing of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >status quo ante bellum.</span><span class="font1"> The empress met&nbsp;with equal
                good fortune in the south ; Potemkin took&nbsp;Otchakoff and Suwaroff Khotin. In
                1789 the latter general won the battles of Fokshani and Kimnik ; and in
                1790&nbsp;after a sanguinary engagement he took Ismail. By the&nbsp;treaty of Jassy
                in 1792 Catherine kept possession of Otch-akoff, and the shore between the Bug and
                Dniester.&nbsp;She was next occupied with the affairs of Poland, which&nbsp;have
                been described under that heading. In consequence of&nbsp;the demands of the
                confederates of Targovica,—men who&nbsp;were prepared to ruin their country for
                their own private&nbsp;ends,—eighty thousand Russians and twenty
                thousand&nbsp;Cossacks entered the Ukraine to undo the work of the&nbsp;confederates
                of Bar. In 1794 Suwaroff stormed Warsaw,&nbsp;and the inhabitants were massacred. In
                the following&nbsp;year Stanislaus Poniatowski laid down his crown, the
                third&nbsp;division of Poland took place, and the independence of&nbsp;that country
                was at an end. In spite of her correspondence and affected sympathies with Voltaire,
                Diderot, and&nbsp;many of the advanced French thinkers, Catherine showed&nbsp;great
                opposition to the principles of the French Revolution, and the policy of the latter
                part of her reign was&nbsp;reactionary. She died suddenly on November 17,
                1796.&nbsp;Her character has been amply discussed by foreign writers.&nbsp;It may
                suffice to say here that, whatever her private vices&nbsp;may have been, she was
                unquestionably a woman of great</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">genius, and the only sovereign worthy of Russia who had appeared
                since the days of Peter the Great. Hence the&nbsp;veneration with which her memory
                is regarded by the&nbsp;Russians to this day.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Paul, who had lived in retirement during the life of his mother, was
                an object of aversion to her. We are told that&nbsp;she had prepared a will by which
                he would be disinherited,&nbsp;and the succession conferred upon his son Alexander,
                but&nbsp;his friend Kurakin got hold of it immediately upon the&nbsp;death of the
                empress and destroyed it. The events of the&nbsp;reign of Paul (</span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">q.v.</span>) can be
            only briefly discussed here.&nbsp;He concluded an alliance with Turkey, and entered
            into&nbsp;a coalition against the French republic, which he regarded&nbsp;with horror.
            Suwaroff took the command of the united&nbsp;Russian and Austrian troops at Verona. In
            1799 he&nbsp;defeated the French general Moreau on the banks of the&nbsp;Adda, and made
            a triumphant entry into Milan. After&nbsp;this he won another victory over Macdonald on
            the Trebbia,</p>
        <p><span class="font1">and later the same year that of Novi over Joubert. He then crossed
                the Alps for the purpose of driving the French out&nbsp;of Switzerland, but he was
                everywhere hampered by the&nbsp;Austrians, and, after fighting his way over the Alps
                and&nbsp;suffering great losses, he reached his winter quarters between&nbsp;the
                Iller and the Lech, and soon afterwards he was recalled&nbsp;in disgrace. Paul now
                completely changed his tactics. Accusing England and Austria of having acted
                treacherously&nbsp;towards him, he threw himself into the arms of
                Bonaparte,&nbsp;who had won him over by skilful diplomacy, and, among&nbsp;other
                pieces of flattery, sent back the Russian prisoners&nbsp;newly clothed and armed.
                Paul then meditated joining him&nbsp;in a plan for conquering India ; but in the
                night between&nbsp;the 23d and 24th of March 1801 he was assassinated.
                The&nbsp;chief agents in this catastrophe were Plato Zuboff, Benning-sen, and
                Pahlen. The rule of Paul had become intolerable,&nbsp;and he was fast bringing on a
                national bankruptcy.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">He was succeeded by his eldest son, Alexander I. (1801-1825). One of
                the first acts of the new emperor&nbsp;was to make peace with England and France.
                He, however, soon changed his policy, and in 1805 joined the third&nbsp;coalition
                against France, to which Austria and England&nbsp;were parties. Events which belong
                to general European&nbsp;history, and are well known, need only be described
                briefly&nbsp;here. On December 2d of that year took place the battle&nbsp;of
                Austerlitz, in which the Russians lost 21,000 men, 133&nbsp;guns, and 30 flags. They
                accused their Austrian allies&nbsp;of treachery. The war was soon ended by the
                treaty of&nbsp;Pressburg. We now come to the fourth coalition against&nbsp;France
                (1806-7). In 1807 Napoleon engaged the Russian&nbsp;general Benningsen at Eylau. The
                battle was protracted&nbsp;and sanguinary, but not decisive ; both parties
                abandoned&nbsp;the field and retired into winter quarters. A defeat
                at&nbsp;Friedland in the same year was followed by the peace of&nbsp;Tilsit. By this
                treaty the Prussian king, Frederick William&nbsp;III., lost half his dominions.
                Nearly all his Polish possessions were to go to the king of Saxony under the name
                of&nbsp;the grand-duchy of Warsaw. By a secret treaty, it seemed&nbsp;as if
                Alexander and Napoleon almost aspired to divide the&nbsp;world, or at least Europe,
                between them. The terms, however, were received by a large party in Russia with
                disgust.&nbsp;The next important event in the reign of Alexander was&nbsp;the
                conquest of Finland. By the treaty of Frederikshamn,&nbsp;September 17, 1809, Sweden
                surrendered Finland, with the&nbsp;whole of East Bothnia, and a part of West Bothnia
                lying&nbsp;eastward of the river Torneâ. The Finns were allowed a&nbsp;kind of
                autonomy, which they have preserved to this day.&nbsp;The annexation of Georgia to
                Russia was consolidated at&nbsp;the beginning of this reign, having been long in
                preparation. It led to a war with Persia, which resulted in the&nbsp;incorporation
                of the province of Shirvan with the Russian&nbsp;empire in 1806.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In 1809 commenced the fifth coalition against Napoleon. Alexander,
                who was obliged by treaty to furnish assistance&nbsp;to the French emperor, did all
                that he could to prevent&nbsp;the war. A quarrel with Turkey led to its invasion by
                a&nbsp;Russian army under Michelsen. This war was terminated&nbsp;by a congress held
                at Bucharest in 1812. Russia gave up&nbsp;Moldavia and Wallachia, which she had
                occupied, but kept&nbsp;Bessarabia, with the fortresses of Khotin and
                Bender.&nbsp;Gradually an estrangement took place between Alexander&nbsp;and
                Napoleon, not only on account of the creation of the&nbsp;grand-duchy of Warsaw, but
                because Russia was suffering&nbsp;greatly from the Continental blockade, to which
                Alexander&nbsp;had been forced to give his adhesion. This led to the&nbsp;great
                invasion of Russia by Napoleon in 1812. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
