an island formed by the Cavery, opposite to Trichinopoly, in the Carnatic. The river separates into two branches, and about thirteen miles eastward these branches again approach ; but the northern, which is at this place twenty feet lower than the southern branch, is permitted to run waste into the sea, and is termed the Coleroon ; whilst the southern, which retains the name of Cavery, is led into a variety of channels to irrigate the province of Tan- jore. Near the east end of the island is formed an immense mound, to prevent the waters of the Cavery from descending into the Coleroon. This island is celebrated for two Hindu temples, the largest of which is situated about a mile from the western extremity of the island, and is surrounded by seven square enclosures built of brick, the walls of which are twenty-five feet in height and four feet in thickness. These enclosures are at the distance of 350 feet from each other, and have each four gates opposite the cardinal points. The outward wall is nearly four miles in circumference, and its gateway to the south is ornamented with pillars, several of which are single stones thirty-three feet in length and five in diameter. The British pay so much deference to the Hindu superstitions, that no European has yet entered this temple. It is resorted to from all parts of India by pilgrims seeking absolution for their sins. A tax is levied on them ; and this fund, besides supporting a number of dancing girls, who are prostitutes to the Brahmins, yields a revenue to the British government. In 1751, during the siege of Trichinopoly, the French and their allies took possession of the island of Seringham. In 1752, the French force was compelled to surrender to Major Laurence. The Hindu sanc</p><p>tuaries in these temples were respected by the troops of both nations, neither of whom sought access into the temples.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
