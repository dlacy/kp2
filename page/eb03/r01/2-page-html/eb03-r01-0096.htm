<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">often </span><span class="font2">diſpoſed to regard vice with a no leſs favourable eye than virtue, and who, though there be an eſtabliſhed order by which virtue is diſcriminated from vice,&nbsp;and right from wrong, yet ſcruple not to violate that&nbsp;order in their own conduct ; you cannot expect: them&nbsp;to require in you a degree of rectitude of which they&nbsp;themſelves appear incapable. A Mercury will not diſ-courage the thieviſh arts of the trader ; a Bacchus and&nbsp;a venus cannot frown upon debauchery ; Mars will behold with ſavage delight all the cruelties of war. The&nbsp;Thracians indeed, one of the moſt barbarous nations of&nbsp;antiquity, whoſe ferocity was little if at all inferior to&nbsp;that of the Indians who have been diſtinguiſhed as ca-nibals, was the favourite nation of Mars ; among whom&nbsp;ſtood his palace, to whieh he repaired when about to&nbsp;mount his chariot, and arm himſelf for battle. Even&nbsp;Jupiter, who had been guilty of ſo many acts of tyrannical caprice, had been engaged in fuch a multitude&nbsp;of amorous intrigues, and ſeemed to owe his elevated&nbsp;ſtation as monarch of the ſky, not to fuperior goodnefs&nbsp;or wifdom, but merely to a ſuperior degree of brutal&nbsp;force, could not be feared as the avenger of crimes, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">or&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">revered as the impartial rewarder of virtues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That this ſyſtem had a pernicious effect on morals, and that, as compared with.pure theiſm, it was injurious to ſociety, cannot be denied ; but yet, when contraſted with atheiſm, it was not without its favourable&nbsp;effects. It was ſo connected with the order of fociety,&nbsp;that, without its ſupport, that order could fcarce have&nbsp;been maintained. The young rake might perhaps juſtify himſelf by the example of Jupiter, or Apollo, or&nbsp;ſome other amorous divinity ; the frail virgin or matron&nbsp;might complain of Cupid, or boaſt of imitating venus ;&nbsp;and the thief might practiſe his craft under the patronage of Mercury : But if we take the whole fyſtem&nbsp;together, if we conſider with what views thoſe deities&nbsp;were publicly worſhipped, what temples were raiſed,&nbsp;wlιat rites inſtituted, what ſacrifices offered, and what&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">feri&lt;ε</span><span class="font2"> conſecrated ; we ſhall perhaps find it neeeffary to&nbsp;acknowledge that the general effects even of that mixed&nbsp;and incoherent ſyftem of polytheiſm whieh prevailed&nbsp;among the Greeks and Romans were favourable to fociety. To ſtate a particular inſtance ; the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ancilia</span><span class="font2"> of&nbsp;Mars and the fire of Veſta were thought to ſecure the&nbsp;perpetuity of the Roman empire. As long as the ſacred </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">andle,</span><span class="font2"> which had been dropped from heaven for&nbsp;that benevolent purpoſe, was ſafely preſerved in thoſe&nbsp;holy archives in which it had been depoſited ; and as&nbsp;long as the ſacred fire of Veſta was kept burning, without being once extinguiſhed, or at leaſt ſuffered to&nbsp;remain for an inſtant in that ſtate ; fo long was Rome&nbsp;to ſubſiſt and flouriſh. And, however ſimple and abfurd the idea which connected the profperity of a nation with the preſervation of a piece of wood in a certain place, or with the conſtant blazing of a flame upon&nbsp;an hearth ; yet no fact can be more certain, than that&nbsp;the patriotifm and enthuſiaſtic valour of the Romans,&nbsp;which we ſo much extol and admire, were, in many inſtances, owing in no inconfiderable degree to the veneration which they entertained for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ancilia</span><span class="font2"> and the&nbsp;veſtal ſire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font0">numerous ſeries of facts occur in the Roman, hiſtory, which ſhow the happy effects of their religious: opinions and ceremonies on their ſentiments concerning&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ſocial order and the public welfare. How powerful</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">was the influence of </span><span class="font2">the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſacramentum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> adminiſtered to </span><span class="font2">the ſoldiers when they enliſted in the ſervice of their&nbsp;country ? The promiſes made, the idea of the powers&nbsp;invoked, and the rites performed on that occaſion, pro-duced ſo deep and ſo awful an impreffion on their minds,&nbsp;that no danger, nor diſtreſs, nor difcontent, could&nbsp;prompt thcm to violate their engagements. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">re-</span><span class="font2">ſponſes of the oracles, too, thougſh the dictates of deceit and impoſture, were often of ſingular ſervice to&nbsp;thoſe to whom they were uttered ; when they inſpiretj&nbsp;the warrior, as he marched out to battle, with the con-fide∏ce of fucceſs, they communicated to him new vi-gour<sub>i</sub> and more heroic valour, by which he was actu-ally enabled to gain, or at leaſt to deſerve, the fucceſs&nbsp;which they prornifed. Again, when in times of pub.&nbsp;lic diſtrefs, the augur and the prieſt directed ſome games&nbsp;to be celebrated, certain facriſices to be offered, or ſome&nbsp;other ſolemnities to be performed, in order to appeaſe&nbsp;tbe wrath of the offended deities ; it is plain that the&nbsp;means were not at all ſuited to accompliſh the end pro-poſed by them ; yet ſtill they were highly bénéficiai*&nbsp;when the attention of the whole people was turned en-tirely to thoſe ſolemnities by which the wrath of hea-ven was to be averted, they were rouſed from that de-fpondency under which the ſenſe of the public diſtrei’s&nbsp;or danger might have otherwiſe cauſed them to ſink :&nbsp;the public union was at the ſame time more cloſely cemented, and the hearts of the people knit together ;&nbsp;and when perſuaded, that by propitiating the gods they&nbsp;had removed the cauſe of their diſtreſs, they acquired&nbsp;ſuch calmneſs and ſtrength of mind as enabled them to&nbsp;take more direct and proper meaſures for the fofety </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the ſtate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Could we view the ancient Greeks and Romans acting in public or in private life under the influence of that ſyſtem of ſuperſtition which prevailed among them ;&nbsp;could we perceive how much it contributed to the&nbsp;maintenance of civil order; could we behold Numa and&nbsp;Lycurgus eſtabliſhing their laws, which would otherwiſe have met with a very different reception under&nbsp;the fonction of divinities ; could we obſerve all the beneficial effects which aroſe to communities from the ce-lebration of religious ceremonies - we ſhould no longer&nbsp;hefitate to acknowledge, that thofe principles in the hu-man heart by which we are fuceptible<sup>,</sup> of religious fentiments, are ſo eminently calculated to promote the hap-pineſs of mankind, that even when· perverted and abuſed, their influence is ſtill favourable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ideas which prevailed among the nations of the heathen world concerning a future ſtate of retribution&nbsp;were, it muſt be confeffed,. not very correct. Some of&nbsp;the poets, we believe, have repreſented them in no unfair light : both Homer and virgil have conducted their&nbsp;heroes through the realms of Pluto, and have taken occaſion to unfold to us the ſecrets of thoſe dreary abodes-The ſcenes are wild and fanciful ; the rewards of the&nbsp;juſt and virtuous are of no very reſined or dignified nature : and of the puniſhments- inflicted on. the guilty, it.&nbsp;is often hard to ſay for what ends they could be inflicted ; whether to correct and improve, or for the gratification of revenge or whim : they are often ſo whim-ſical and unfuitable, that they cannot with any degree&nbsp;of propriety be afcribed to any cauſe but blind chance&nbsp;or wanton caprice.
