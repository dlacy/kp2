For he obſerved, that the general ſtream of a river is frequently compoſed of a ſort of boiling or tumbling motion, by which maſſes of water are brought up to the ſurface and again de-foend. Every perſon muſt recollect ſuch appearances in the ſreſhes of a muddy river ; and in this way Guglielmini was enabled to account in ſome meaſure for the diſagreement of his theory with obſervation.</p><p>Mariotte had obſerved the ſame obſtructions even in the ſmootheſt glaſs pipes. Here it could not be aſcribed to the checks occaſioned by tranſverſe motions. He therefore aſcribed it to friction, which he ſuppoſed to diminiſh the motion of fluid bodies in the ſame manner as of ſolids: and he thence concludes, that the filaments which immediately rub on the ſides of the tube have their velocity gradually diminiſhed ; and that the filaments immediately adjoining to theſe, being thus obliged to paſs over them or outſtrip them, rub upon them, and have their own velocity diminiſhed in like manner, but in a ſmaller degree; and that the ſucceeding filaments towards the axis of the tube ſuffer, ſimilar but ſmaller diminutions. By this means the whole ſtream may come to have a ſmaller velocity ; and at any rate the medium velocity by which the quantity diſcharged is determined, is ſmaller than it would have beea independent of friction.</p><p>Guglielmini adopted this opinion of Mariotte, and in his next work on the Motion of Rivers, conſidered this as the <hi rend="italic">chief</hi>  cauſe of the retardation ; and he added a third circumſtance, which he conſidered as of no leſs conſequence, the viſcidity or tenacity of water. He obſerves that ſyrup, oil, and other fluids, where this viſcidity is more remarkable, have their motions prodigi-ouſly retarded by it, and ſuppoſes that water differs from them only in the degree in which it poſſeſſes this quality : and he ſays, that by this means not only the particles which are moving more rapidly have their motions diminiſhed by thoſe in their neighbourhood which move flower, but that the filaments alſo which would have moved more ſlowly are accelerated by their more active neighbours ; and that in this, manner the ſuperficial and inferior velocities are brought nearer to an equality. But this will never account for the univerſal fact, that the ſuperficial particles are the ſwifteſt of all. The ſuperficial particles, ſays ſhe, acquire by this means a greater velocity than the parabolic law allows them ; the medium velocity is often in the middle of the depth ; the numerous obſtacles, continually multiplied and repeated, cauſe the current to loſe the velocity acquired by the fall ; the ſlope of the bottom then diminiſhes, and often becomes very ſmall, ſo that the force remaining is hardly able to overcome the obſtacles which are ſtill repeated, and the river is reduced almoſt to a ſtate of ſtagnation. He obſerves, that the Rheno, a river of the Milaneſe, has near its mouth a ſlope of no more than yo", which he conſiders as quite inadequate to the taſk ; and here he introduces another principle, which he conſiders as an effential part of the theory of open currents. This is, that there ariſes ſrom the very depth of the ſtream a propelling force which reſtores a part of the loſt velocity. He offers nothing in proof of this principle, but uſes it to account ſor and explain the motion of waters in horizontal canals. The principle has been adopted by the numerous Italian writers on hydraulics,</p><p>and, by various contrivances, ipterwoven with the para«</p><p>bolic theory, as it is called, of Guglielmini. Our reader may ſee it in various modifications in the <hi rend="italic">Idraſtatica e Idraulica</hi>  of P. Lecchi, and in the <hi rend="italic">Sperien%e Idrauliche </hi>of Michelotti. It is by no means diſtinct either in its origin or in the manner of its application to the explanation of phenomena, and ſeems only to ſerve for giving ſomething like conſiſtency to the vague and obſcure diſcuſſions which have been publiſhed on this ſubject- in Italy. We have already remarked, that in that country the ſubject is particularly intereſting, and has been much commented upon. But the writers of England, France, and Germany, have not paid ſo much attention to it, and have more generally occupied themſelves with the motion of water in cloſe conduits, which ſeem to admit of a more preciſe application of mathematical reaſoning. </p><p>Some of thoſe have conſidered with more attention the effects of friction and viſcidity. Sir Iſaac Newton, with his uſual penetration, had ſeen diſtinctly the manner in which it behoved theſe circumſtances to operate. He had occaſion, in his reſearches into the mechaniſm of the celeſtial motions, to examine the famous hypo-theſis of Deſcartes, that the planets were carried round the ſun by fluid vortices, and law that there would be no end to,uncertainty and diſpute till the <hi rend="italic">modus operandi </hi>of theſe vortices was mechanically conſidered. He therefore employed himſelf in the inveſtigation of the manner in which the acknowledged powers of natural bodies, acting according to the received laws of mechanics, could produce and preſerve theſe vortices, and re-ſtore that motion which was expended in carrying the planets round the ſun. He therefore, in the ſecond . book of the Principles of Natural Philofophy, gives a ſeries of beautiful propoſitions, viz. y I, 52, &amp;c. with: their corollaries, ſho wing how the rotation of acylinderor ſphere round its axis in the midſt of a fluid will excite a vortical motion in this fluid ; and he aſcertains with mathematical preciſion the motion of every filament of this vortex.</p><p>He ſets out from the ſuppofition that this motion is-excited in the ſurrounding ſtratum of fluid in confo-quence of a want of perfect lubricity, and affirmes as an hypotheſis, that the initial reſiſtance (or diminution of the motion of the cylinder) which ariſes from this want of lubricity, is proportional to, the velocity with which the ſurface of the cylinder is ſeparated from the contiguous ſurface of the ſurrounding fluid, and that the whole reſiſtance is proportional to the velocity with which the parts of the fluid are mutually ſeparated from each other. From this, and the equality of action and re-action, it evidently follows, that the velocity of any ſtratum of the vortex is the arithmetical medium between the velocities of the ſtrata immediately within and without it. For the intermediate ſtratum cannot be in equilibrio, unleſs it is as much preſſed forward by the ſuperior motion of the ſtratum within it, as it is kept back by the flower motion of the ſtratum without it.</p><p>This beautiful inveſtigation applies in the moſt perfect manner to every change produced in the motion of a fluid filament, in conſequence of the viſcidity and friction of the adjoining filaments; and a filament proceeding along a tube at ſome ſmall diſtance from the ſides has, in like manner, a velocity which is the medium between thoſe of the filament} immediately ſurrounding</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
