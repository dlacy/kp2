<p><span class="font1">armed </span><span class="font0">and moſtly ſoldiers, had greatly the advantage ; however, they were on the point of being op preſſed by&nbsp;numbers, when they fell upon the moſt cruel method&nbsp;of enſuring their ſucceſs that could be deviſed. This&nbsp;was by ſetting fire to the city in ſeveral places } and&nbsp;wſhile the diſtreſſed Ruſſians ran to ſave their families,&nbsp;the Poles fell upon them ſword in hand. In this confuſion upwards of iσo,ooo peop⅛ periſhed; but the&nbsp;event was, that the Roles were finally driven oüt, and&nbsp;loſt all footing in Ruffià.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The expnllion of the Poles was ſucceeded by the election of Tſheodorovitz Romanov, a young nobleman of 17 years of age, whoſe poſterity, till the acceſſion of the preſent Empreſs, continued to enjoy the fo-vereignty. He died in 1646, and was ſucceeded by his&nbsp;ſon Alexis ; whoſe reign was a continued ſcene of tumult and confuſion, being haraſſcd on all ſides by external enemies, and having his empire perpetually diſ-turbed by internal commotions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſources of theſe commotions were found in the multiplicity and inconſiſtency of the laws at that&nbsp;period, and in the jarring claims of the nobles on the&nbsp;borders. An </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emann∙y ukaſe,</span><span class="font0"> or personal order, which&nbsp;is an edict of the ſovereign, ſigned with his own hand,&nbsp;is the only law oſ Ruſſia. Theſe edicts are as various&nbsp;as the opinions, prejudices, paſſion-s, or whims of men ;&nbsp;and in the days of Alexis they produced endleſs contentions. To remedy this evil, he made a Election,&nbsp;from all the edicts of his predeceſſiors, of ſuch as had&nbsp;been familiarly current ſor a hundred years ; prtſuming&nbsp;that thoſe either were founded in natural juſtice, or during ſo long a currency had formed the minds of the&nbsp;people to conſider them as juſt. This digeſt, w hich he&nbsp;declared to be the common law of Ruſſia, and which is&nbsp;prefaced by a fort of inſtitute, is the ſtandard law-book&nbsp;at this day known by the title of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ulogeniè</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Selection;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and all edicts prior to it were declared to be obſolete.&nbsp;He ſoon made his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">novella,</span><span class="font0"> however, more bulky than tſhe&nbsp;Ulogeniè ; and the additions by his ſucceſſors are beyond&nbsp;enumeration. This was undoubtedly a great and uſe-ful work ; but Alexis performed another ſtill greater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though there are many courts of judicature in this widely extended empire, the emperor has always been&nbsp;lord paramount, and could take a cauſe from any court&nbsp;immediately before himſelf. But as ſeveral of the old&nbsp;nobles had the remains of principalities in their families,&nbsp;and held their own courts, the ſovereign or his mini-fters, at a diſtance up the country, frequently found it&nbsp;difficult to bring a culprit out of one of theſe heredita</span><span class="font1">ry </span><span class="font0">feudal juriſdictions, and try him by the laws of the&nbsp;empire. This was a very diſagreeable limitation of imperial power; and the more ſo, that ſome families claimed even a right to repledge. A lucky opportunity offered of ſettling this diſpute } and Alexis embraced it&nbsp;with great ability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some families on the old frontiers were taxed with their defence, for which they were obliged to keep regiments on foot ; and as they were but lcantily indemnified by the ſtate, it ſometimes required the exertion&nbsp;©f authority to make them keep up their levies. When&nbsp;the frontiers, by the conqueſt of Caſan, were ſar extended, thoſe gentlemen found the regiments no longer bur-denſome, becauſe by the help of falſe muſters, the&nbsp;former ſcanty allowance much more than reimburſed&nbsp;(them for </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font0">exnence </span><span class="font1">of the eſtabliſhment, The conſe-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">quence was, that diſputes aroſe among them about the right of guarding certain diſtricts, and law-ſuits were&nbsp;neceſſary to fettle their reſpective claims. Theſe were&nbsp;tedious and intricate. One claimant ſhowed the order&nbsp;of the court, iſſued a century or two back, to his an··&nbsp;&quot;ceſtor for the marching of his men, aâ a proof that thc&nbsp;right was then in his family. His opponent proved;&nbsp;that his anceſtors had been the real lords of the marches;&nbsp;but that, on account of their negligence, the court had&nbsp;iſſued an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emmansy ukaſe</span><span class="font0"> to the other, only at that particular period. The emperor ordered all the family archives to be brought to Moſcow; and all documents όή&nbsp;both ſides to be collected. A time was ſet for the&nbsp;examination; a fine wooden court-houſe was built ;&nbsp;every paper was lodged under a good guard ; the day&nbsp;was appointed when the court ſhould be opened and&nbsp;the claims heard ; but that morning the houſe, with&nbsp;all its contents, was in two hours conſumed by fire.&nbsp;The emperor then ſaid, “ Gentlemen, henceforward&nbsp;your-ranks, your privileges, and your courts, are thc&nbsp;nation’s, and the nation will guard itſelf. Your archives are unfortunately loſt, but thoſe of the nation&nbsp;remain. I am the keeper, and it is my duty to ad-miniſter juſtice ſor all and to all. Your ranks are not&nbsp;private, but national ; attached to the ſervices you are&nbsp;actually performing. Henceforward Colonel Buturlin&nbsp;(a private gentleman) ranks before Captain Viazemſky&nbsp;(an old prince).”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This conſtitution, which eſtabliſhed the different ranks of Ruſſia as they remain to this day, is by&nbsp;Voltaire aſcribed to Peter :. but it was the work of&nbsp;Alexis ; who, when the ſituation of himſelf and his&nbsp;country is conſidered, muſt be allowed to have been&nbsp;a great and a good man. He died in 1676, and was&nbsp;ſucceeded by his ſon Theodore Alexiovit⅜} who after&nbsp;an excellent reign, during the whole of which he exerted himſelf to the utmoſt for the good of his ſubjects,&nbsp;diedin 1682, having appointed his brother Peter I.&nbsp;commonly called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Peter the Great,</span><span class="font0"> his ſucceſſor. See&nbsp;PetEr I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theodore had another brother named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">John ;</span><span class="font1"> but as </span><span class="font0">he was ſubject to the fallſhg-ſickneſs, the Czar had preferred Peter, though very young, to the ſucceſſion. But&nbsp;through the intrigues of the princeſs Sophia, fiſter to&nbsp;Theodore, a ſtrong party was formed in favour of John;&nbsp;and ſoon after both John and Peter were proclaimed&nbsp;ſovereigns of Ruſſia under the adminiſtration of Soph⅛&nbsp;herſelf, who was declared regent. However, this adminiſtration did not continue long; for the princeſs regent&nbsp;having conſpired againſt Peter, and having the misfortune to be diſcovered, was confined for life in a convent.&nbsp;From this time alſo John continued to be only a nominal ſovereign till his death, which happened in 1696,&nbsp;Peter continuing to engroſs all the power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is to this emperor that Ruſſia is univerſally allowed to owe the whole of her preſent greatneſs. The private character of Peter himſelf ſeems to have been&nbsp;but very- indifferent. Though he had been married in&nbsp;his eighteenth year to a young and beautiful princeſs,&nbsp;he was not ſuſſiciently reſtrained by the ſolemn ties of&nbsp;wedlock ; and he was befides fo much addicted to Railing and drunkenneſs, the prevailing vice of his country,&nbsp;that nobody could have imagined him capable of effecting the reformation upon his ſubjects which he actually&nbsp;accompliſhed. In ſpite of all diſad vantages, however.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
