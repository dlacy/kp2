<p><span class="font0">obligation on a borrower to repay the money or corn advanced to him was made actionable, under the Silian and Calpurnian laws&nbsp;respectively, by a stipulation contemporaneous with the loan.&nbsp;With the rise of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span class="font0"> loan became actionable on its own&nbsp;merits—that is to say, the advance and receipt of money as a loan&nbsp;of itself laid the borrower under a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stricti juris</span><span class="font0"> obligation to repay it,&nbsp;even though no stipulatory engagement had intervened; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in this case the giving and receiving </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mutui causa—</span><span class="font0">completed the&nbsp;contract. The obligation that arose from it was purely unilateral,&nbsp;and enforceable, where the loan was.of money, by the same action—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">certae pecuniae creditae</span><span class="font0">—as stipulation and literal contract; and so&nbsp;strictly was it construed that interest on the loan was not claimable&nbsp;along with it, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res</span><span class="font0"> given and received being the full measure of the&nbsp;obligation of repayment. The other three—commodate, deposit&nbsp;and pledge—became independent real contracts much later than&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mutuum,</span><span class="font0"> possibly not all at the same time, and none of them apparently until very late in the Republic. All of them, of course, had&nbsp;been long known as transactions of daily life; the difficulty is to&nbsp;say when they first became actionable in the urban praetor’s court&nbsp;(for in transactions with peregrins actions </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in factum</span><span class="font0"> would doubtless&nbsp;be granted), and under what guise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is impossible within the space at our command to criticize the various theories entertained of their vicissitudes, for they necessarily vary to some extent in regard to each. We must content&nbsp;ourselves, therefore, with the simple statement that eventually,&nbsp;and within the period with which we are now dealing, they came&nbsp;to be recognized as independent real contracts, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res</span><span class="font0"> by which&nbsp;they were completed being the delivery of a thing by one person to&nbsp;another for a particular purpose, on the understanding that it was&nbsp;to be returned when that purpose was served. And it is to be noted&nbsp;that, while </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mutuum</span><span class="font0"> transferred the property of the money lent,&nbsp;the borrower being bound to return not the identical coins but&nbsp;only an equal amount, in pledge it was only the possession that&nbsp;passes, while in commodate and deposit the lender or depositor&nbsp;retained both property and (legal) possession, the borrower or depositary having nothing more than the natural detention. In all&nbsp;but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mutuum,</span><span class="font0"> therefore, there was trust; the holder was bound, to&nbsp;an extent varying according to circumstances, to care for what he&nbsp;held as if it were his own, and entitled to be reimbursed for outlay&nbsp;on its maintenance—bound to return it, yet excused if his failure&nbsp;to do so was due to a cause for which in fairness he could not be&nbsp;held responsible. Consequently the actions on these three, contracts, differing from that on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mutuum,</span><span class="font0"> were all </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidei,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;judge being vested with full.discretion to determine what was fair&nbsp;and equitable in each individual case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Praetorian Amendments on the Law of Succession.</span><span class="font0">—The most important change in the law of succession during the latter half of the Republic was due to the praetors. They introduced, under&nbsp;the technical name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio<sup>@@1</sup></span><span class="font0"> what was really&nbsp;beneficial enjoyment of the estate of a deceased person&nbsp;without the legal title of inheritance. There is much to&nbsp;lead to the conclusion that the series of provisions in&nbsp;regard to it which we find in the Julian consolidation of the Edict&nbsp;were the work of a succession of praetors, some of them probably&nbsp;not under the Republic but under the Empire; but it will be&nbsp;convenient to give here a general view of the subject as a whole,&nbsp;disregarding the consideration that some of its features may not</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">have been given to it within the period now under notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Justinian, speaking of the origin of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio,</span><span class="font0"> observes that in promising it to a petitioner.the praetors were not always&nbsp;actuated by the same motives; in some cases their object&nbsp;was to facilitate the application of the rules of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in some to amend their application according to what they&nbsp;believed to be the spirit of the XII. Tables, in others, again, to set&nbsp;them aside as inequitable.<sup>@@2</sup> It is not unreasonable to assume that&nbsp;it was with the purpose of aiding the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font0"> that the first step&nbsp;was taken in what gradually became a momentous reform; and&nbsp;it is probable that this first step was the announcement by some&nbsp;praetor that, where there was dispute as to an inheritance, and a&nbsp;testament was presented to him bearing not fewer seals than were&nbsp;required by law, he would give possession of the goods of the defunct&nbsp;to the heir named in it.<sup>@@3</sup> In this as it stands there is nothing but a&nbsp;regulation of possession of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bona</span><span class="font0"> of the inheritance pending the&nbsp;question of legal right. Just as between two parties contending&nbsp;about the ownership of a specific thing in a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rei vindicatio</span><span class="font0"> the praetor&nbsp;first settled the question of interim possession, so did he promise&nbsp;to do here when a question was about to be tried about the right&nbsp;to an inheritance (« </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de hereditate ambigitur).</span><span class="font0"> It was a provisional&nbsp;arrangement merely, and very necessary in view of the state of the&nbsp;law which permitted a third party, apart from any pretence of title,&nbsp;to step in and complete a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">usucapiopro herede</span><span class="font0"> by a year’s possession&nbsp;of the effects of the inheritance. Even at the time when the Edict&nbsp;was closed it was not necessarily more than a provisional grant;&nbsp;for, if heirs-at-law of the deceased appeared and proved that,&nbsp;although the testament bore on the outside the requisite number of&nbsp;seals, yet in fact some solemnity of execution, such as the /awi/tac&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">venditw</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">testamenti nuncupatio,</span><span class="font0"> had been omitted, the grantee&nbsp;had to yield them up the possession that had been given him pending&nbsp;inquiry. It was only by a rescript of Antoninus Pius that it w<sup>r</sup>as&nbsp;declared that a plea by the heir-at-law of invalidity of a testament&nbsp;on the ground of defect of formalities of execution might be defeated by an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">exceptio doli,</span><span class="font0"> on the principle that it was contrary&nbsp;to good faith to set aside the wishes of a testator on a technical&nbsp;objection that was purely formal. Thus was the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio&nbsp;secundum tabulas, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> in accordance with a testament, from being&nbsp;originally one in aid of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font0"> in course of time converted&nbsp;into one in contradiction of it. That the motives and purposes of&nbsp;the series of praetors who built up the law of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">must have varied in progress of years is obvious; and, once the&nbsp;machinery had been invented, nothing was easier than to apply it&nbsp;to new ideas. The praetor could not make a man heir—that he&nbsp;always disclaimed; but he could give a man, whether heir or not,&nbsp;the substantial advantages of inheritance, and protect him in&nbsp;their enjoyment by praetorian remedies. He gave him. possession&nbsp;of the goods of the deceased, with summary remedies for ingathering&nbsp;them, which, once in his hands, would become his in quiritarian&nbsp;right on the expiry of the period of usucaption; and subsequently,&nbsp;by interpolation into the formula of a fiction of heirship, he gave him&nbsp;effectual personal actions against debtors of the deceased, rendering&nbsp;him liable in the same way to the deceased’s creditors.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>For a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r£sum£</span><span class="font0"> of the principal theories (down to 1870) about the origin of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum'possessio^</span><span class="font0"> see Danz, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte d. rom. Rechts,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">vol. ii. § 176.

<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@3 </sup>Cic., </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">In Verr.</span><span class="font0"> 11. i. 45, § 117. He says (writing in 70 B.c.) that an edict to that effect was already </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tralaticium, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> had been adopted&nbsp;year after year by a series of praetors. Gaius (ii. 119) speaks of&nbsp;seven at least as the requisite number of seals; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> probably those of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">libripens and</span><span class="font0"> the five citizen witnesses, and that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">antestatus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">whose functions are not* well understood, but whose official designation appended to his seal recurs so regularly in inscriptions as to&nbsp;leave no doubt that his was originally the seventh.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">Another variety of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font0"> was that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">contra tabulas— </span><span class="font0">in opposition to the terms of a testament. If a testator had neither&nbsp;instituted nor expressly disinherited a son who was one of his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes,</span><span class="font0"> then his testament was a nullity, and the child&nbsp;passed over had no need of a praetorian remedy. Where&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes</span><span class="font0"> other than sons were passed over the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font0"> upheld the&nbsp;will but allowed them to participate with the instituted heirs by&nbsp;a sort of accrual. But the Edict went further; for, if the institute&nbsp;was a stranger, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> was not a person in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font0"> of the testator&nbsp;with the child passed over, then, on the petition of the latter, the&nbsp;praetor gave him and any other </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui</span><span class="font0"> concurring with him possession&nbsp;of .the whole estate, of tne deceased as on intestacy, the institute&nbsp;being left with nothing more than the empty name of heir. Another&nbsp;application of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio contra tabulas</span><span class="font0"> was to the case&nbsp;of emancipated children of the testator. By the Jus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">civile</span><span class="font0"> he was&nbsp;not required to institute or disinherit them; for by their emancipation they had ceased to be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes,</span><span class="font0"> and had lost that interest&nbsp;in the family estate which was the reason why they had to be&nbsp;mentioned in the testament of their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias.</span><span class="font0"> The praetors—&nbsp;although probably not until the empire, and when the doctrines&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale</span><span class="font0"> were being more freely recognized—put them&nbsp;on the same footing as unemancipated children, requiring that they&nbsp;also should be either instituted or disinherited, and giving them&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font0"> if they were not. It was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">contra tabulas</span><span class="font0"> in the&nbsp;sense that it displaced the instituted heirs either wholly or partially—&nbsp;wholly when the institutes were not children of the deceased, partially when they were. In the latter case, at least when </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui</span><span class="font0"> were&nbsp;affected by it, the grant of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font0"> was under the equitable&nbsp;condition that the grantees should collate or bring into partition&nbsp;all their own acquisitions since their emancipation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The third variety of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font0"> was that granted </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ab intestato.</span><span class="font0"> The rules of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font0"> in reference to succession on&nbsp;intestacy were, as we have seen, extremely strict and&nbsp;artificial. They admitted neither emancipated children&nbsp;nor agnates who had undergone </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio;</span><span class="font0"> they&nbsp;admitted no female agnate more remote than a sister; if the&nbsp;nearest agnate or agnates declined, the right did not pass to those&nbsp;of the next degree; mere cognates, kinsmen of the deceased who&nbsp;were not agnates , </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> grandchildren or others related to him&nbsp;through females and agnates </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">capite minuti,</span><span class="font0"> were not admitted at&nbsp;all; while a wife had no share unless she had been </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in manu</span><span class="font0"> of the&nbsp;deceased and therefore </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiae loco.</span><span class="font0"> All these rules the praetors&nbsp;amended, and so far paved the way for the revolution in the law&nbsp;of intestate succession which was accomplished by Justinian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They established four orders or classes of heirs, (i) Displacing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui heredes</span><span class="font0"> of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font0"> they gave the first place to descendants </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(liber i),</span><span class="font0"> including in the term all those whom the deceased&nbsp;would have been bound either by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font0"> or the Edict to&nbsp;institute or disinherit had he made a will, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> his wife </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in manu,</span><span class="font0"> sons&nbsp;and daughters of his body whether </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font0"> at his death or&nbsp;emancipated, the representatives of sons w’ho had predeceased him,&nbsp;and adopted children in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font0"> when he died.
