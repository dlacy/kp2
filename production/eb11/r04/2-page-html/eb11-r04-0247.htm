Ife was therefore charged with its defence&nbsp;against Napoleon, and took every means to rouse the population of the town and district against the invader. He has&nbsp;been generally charged with instigating the burning of Moscow&nbsp;the day after the French had made their entry; it is certain&nbsp;that the prisons were opened by his order, and that he took&nbsp;no means to stop the outbreak. He defended himself against&nbsp;the charge of incendiarism in a pamphlet printed in Paris&nbsp;in 1823, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Vérité sur V incendie de Moscou,</span><span class="font1"> but he subsequently&nbsp;made grave admissions. Shortly after the congress of Vienna,&nbsp;to which he had accompanied the Tsar Alexander, he was&nbsp;disgraced. He only returned to Russia in 1825, and died at&nbsp;Moscow on the 12th of February of the next year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROSTOV-ON-THE-DON, a seaport of Russia, in the territory of the Don Cossacks, well situated on the high right bank of the&nbsp;Don, 13 m. from its mouth in the Sea of Azov. In 1731 a small&nbsp;fort was erected on an island in the Don, near its mouth. Thirty&nbsp;years later the fortifications were transferred to the site now&nbsp;occupied by Rostov, 5 m. above the head of the first branch of&nbsp;the delta of the Don. The Don, which has here a breadth of&nbsp;230 to 250 yds., with a hardly perceptible current, offers an&nbsp;excellent roadstead. The navigation, however, is considerably&nbsp;impeded by the shallowness of the river. Dredging operations&nbsp;have but partially remedied this. Moreover, the river is frost-bound for more than one hundred days in the year. The&nbsp;population has grown rapidly: while in 1881 it was 70,700, in&nbsp;1897 it numbered 119,889, and in 1905 126,375, exclusive of&nbsp;the suburbs; if these, which comprise Nakhichevan (32,582 in&nbsp;1905) be included, the population is well over 160,000, a figure&nbsp;which is still further swollen in the summer by the influx of&nbsp;about 60,000 men, who find work in connexion with the shipment of grain for export. The permanent population includes&nbsp;15,000 Jews, 5000 Armenians, with Tatars, Poles, Germans and&nbsp;others. In Nakhichevan there are 20,500 Armenians. Owing&nbsp;to its situation on the navigable river Don and at the junction&nbsp;of three railways, radiating to north-western Russia, Caucasia&nbsp;and the Volga respectively, Rostov has become the chief seaport of south-eastern Russia, being second in importance on the&nbsp;Black Sea to Odessa only. It is the chief centre for the supply&nbsp;of agricultural machinery to the steppe governments of southeastern Russia. On an average, £3,000,000 to £4,000,000 worth&nbsp;of wheat, about £1,000,000 worth of rye, and over £1,500,000&nbsp;worth of barley are exported annually, besides oats, flax, linseed,&nbsp;rape seed, oilcake, bran, flour, vegetable oils, raw wool and&nbsp;caviare. The imports average between four and five millions&nbsp;sterling annually, and consist largely of agricultural machinery.&nbsp;There are a shipbuilding yard, flour-mills, tobacco factories,&nbsp;iron works, machinery works, distilleries, soap works, timber&nbsp;mills, bell foundries, paper mills and rope works. Rostov is&nbsp;the chief centre of steam flour-miUs for south-eastern Russia&nbsp;and Caucasia. Two fairs, one of which has considerable importance for the whole of south-eastern Russia, are held here&nbsp;yearly. Rostov has excellent fisheries. The town has a&nbsp;cathedral, a fine town hall (1897-99), navigation schools, technical schools, and a good municipal library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSTOV VELIKIY, a town of Russia, in the government of Yaroslavl, 35 m. by rail S.W. of the town of Yaroslavl, near&nbsp;Lake Rostov or Nero. Pop. (1897) 14,342. It has numerous&nbsp;cotton and linen mills. The great fair for which it was formerly&nbsp;famous has lost its importance, but the town remains the&nbsp;centre of a variety of domestic trades—tailoring, the manufacture of leather, and the making of boots and small enamelled&nbsp;ikons (sacred images) ; it is also famous for its kitchen gardening&nbsp;and the export of pickled and dried vegetables and medical&nbsp;herbs. Fishing is carried on. The restoration of the buildings&nbsp;(royal palace, archiépiscopal palace, and five churches) of the&nbsp;kreml or citadel was begun in 1901. The other public buildings&nbsp;include six 17th-century churches, a museum and a cathedral,&nbsp;consecrated in 1231 and having its interior walls covered with&nbsp;paintings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rostov was founded by Slavs in or before 862, and played so prominent a rôle in the history of that part of Russia that it used&nbsp;to be known as Rostov the Great. From the beginning of the&nbsp;nth century to the 13th it was the chief town of a territory&nbsp;which included large parts of the present governments of Yaroslavl, Vladimir and Novgorod. After the Mongol invasion of&nbsp;T239-42 it-rapidly declined, and in 1474 it was purchased by&nbsp;Ivan III. and annexed to Moscow. It was repeatedly plundered&nbsp;by Tatars, Lithuanians and Poles in the 15th, 16th and 17th&nbsp;centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSTRA@@<sup>1</sup> (“ beaks ”), in Roman antiquities, the orators’ platform, which originally stood between the comitium and&nbsp;the forum proper, opposite the curia. It is not known when it&nbsp;was erected, but in 338 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> it was decorated by Gaius Maenius&nbsp;with the prows of ships captured from the people of Antium&nbsp;(Livy viii. 14). From that time it was called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rostra,</span><span class="font1"> having&nbsp;previously been known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">templum</span><span class="font1"> (literally “ consecrated&nbsp;place ”), since it had been consecrated by the augurs (Cicero,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">In Vatinium, x.</span><span class="font1"> 24). Some, however, deny the identity of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">templum</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rostra.</span><span class="font1"> On the platform or hard by were exhibited&nbsp;the statues of famous Romans (Camillus, Caesar), and state&nbsp;documents and memorials (the laws of the Twelve Tables,&nbsp;the treaty with the Latins, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">columna rosirata</span><span class="font1"> of Duilius).&nbsp;Caesar had it pulled down, intending that it should be rebuilt&nbsp;on the west side of the forum, but it was left for Augustus&nbsp;(or Mark Antony) to carry out his plan. The term Rostra&nbsp;Vetera, often used by classical authors in connexion with&nbsp;funeral orations, makes it doubtful whether the old platform&nbsp;was entirely demolished, unless the name was simply transferred to the new rostra of Augustus. This consisted of a&nbsp;rectangular platform, 78 ft. long, 33 ft. broad and 11 ft. above&nbsp;the level of the forum pavement. It was reached by steps from&nbsp;the back; in front there was a marble balustrade with an&nbsp;opening in the centre where the speaker stood, possibly also&nbsp;intended for a staircase leading down into the forum. In the&nbsp;existing remains the holes in which the beaks of the ships&nbsp;were fastened, arranged in pairs, are visible. Behind these&nbsp;remains, close to the Clivus Capitolinus, a row of light low-arched cells has been found, which, owing to a certain resemblance to the earlier rostra as shown on the well-known coin of&nbsp;Lollius Palicanus, has been identified by Boni with the rostra&nbsp;removed by Julius Caesar, the other remains being attributed&nbsp;to the time of Domitian (for objections to this theory, see&nbsp;Hiilsen and Richter). In the time of Hadrian the side balustrades were decorated with marble slabs, on which were represented in relief the burning of the lists of the citizens who were&nbsp;in arrears to the fisc and the distribution of necessaries to the&nbsp;poorer citizens. Thêdenat explains the first as Domitian reassuring a deputation of citizens by burning the denunciatory&nbsp;reports of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">delatores,</span><span class="font1"> and the second (the scene of which&nbsp;he places at the Rostra Julia) as the promulgation of the law&nbsp;forbidding the mutilation of children. The erection of the arch&nbsp;of Severus necessitated considerable alterations, the most important of which was a triangular courtyard cut out of the&nbsp;north half of the rostra, to allow direct access to it from the&nbsp;side that faced the arch, its breadth being thereby reduced by&nbsp;a third. A later extension of the façade northwards is explained&nbsp;by a long inscription, recording that about the year 470, Ulpius&nbsp;Junius Valentinus, a city prefect, restored the structure (hence&nbsp;called Rostra Vandalica) after a naval victory over the Vandals.&nbsp;A relief on the arch of Constantine represents the emperor&nbsp;speaking from the rostra.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> The Lat. singular </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rostrum,</span><span class="font1"> a beak, the beak of a ship, is used in English of a platform, stand or pulpit from which a speaker addresses&nbsp;his audience. It is also used in its original meaning of a beak-like&nbsp;prolongation or process in zoology or botany.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
