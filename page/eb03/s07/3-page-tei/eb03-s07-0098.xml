The two predominant religions are Calviniſm and Popery. Of the former are the cantons of Zurich and Berne, the town of St Gall, Geneva, Muhlhauſen, and Biel, the principality of Neufchatel, the greater part of Baſil, Schaffhauſen, the country of the Grisons, the Thurgau, Toggenburg, Glaris, and the Rhine valley ; the frontiers of Appenzel, with a ſmall part of Solothurn, and ſome places in the countries of Baden and Sargans. The reſt of the Swiſs cantons, allies and dependents, are Popiſh. For the education of youth there is an univerſity at Baſil, and academies at Zurich, Berne, Lauſanne, and Geneva, beſides gymnaſiums and scholæ illuſtres, both in the Popiſh and Proteſtant cantons. There are alſo ſocieties among them for the improvement of the German language and the ſciences.</p><p>The principal manufactures are ſnuff and tobacco, linen of ſeveral sorts, lace, thread, ſilk, and worsted ſtockings, neckcloths, cotton stuffs, gloves, handkerchiefs, ſilks of ſeveral sorts, gold and ſilver brocades, a variety of woollen manufactures, hats, paper, leather of all sorts, earthen wares, porcelain, toys, watches, clocks, and other hardwares, &amp;c. The trade of Switzerland is greatly promoted by many navigable lakes and rivers. In ſome of the above manufactures, and in cheeſe, butter, ſheep, horſes, black cattle, hides, and skins, the exports are conſiderable ; and as the imports are chiefly grain and ſalt, with ſome American and Aſiatic goods, there is probably a large balance in their favour. In ſome parts of Switzerland dreſs is restrained by ſumptuary laws.</p><p>The public revenues are in general very inconſiderable, ariſing chiefly from the uſual regalia, appropriated everywhere to the ſovereign, the demeſnes, and public granaries, voluntary contributions, the ſale of ſalt, and a land-tax ; in the Protestant cantons, from the church-lands alſo that were ſeized at the Reformation. Except in Zurich, Berne, Baſil, and Schaffhauſen, where the people are more induſtrious, have a greater trade, and are richer than in the others, they defray the ordinary charges, and that is all.</p><p>The cantons never keep any standing troops, except for a few garriſons ; but their militia is reckoned to be the best regulated of any in Europe. Every male from 16 to 60 is enrolled, and about one-third of them regimented. They muſt all provide themſelves with arms, clothing, and accoutrements, and appear on the ſtated days for exerciſe ; and the ſeveral cantons and diſtricts muſt be furniſhed with a ſufficient train of artillery, and all the other implements of war. The Switzers of the ſeveral cantons are allowed to engage in the ſervice of ſuch foreign princes and ſtates as are in alliance with thoſe cantons, or with whom they have made a previous agreement. Such ſtates, paying an annual ſubſidy to the reſpective cantons, are allowed to make levies. Every man enliſts voluntarily, and for what number of years he pleaſes ; at the expiration of which he is at liberty to return home. A great many thus always returning from foreign ſervice, Switzerland is never unprovided with able and experienced officers and ſoldiers. With respect to their character, they are a brave, honeſt, hoſpitable, hardy people ; very true to their engagements, friendly, and humane. In ſhort, there is not a people in Europe whole national character is better. In their persons they are generally tall, robuſt, and well-made ; but their complexions are none of the beſt, and thoſe that live in the neighbourhood of the mountains are ſubject to wens. The women are ſaid to be generally handſome and well-ſhaped, ſenſible and modest, yet frank, easy, and agreeable in converſation. Few of the peaſants are miſerably poor ; many of them are rich, eſpecially in the Proteſtant cantons, and that of Berne in particular.</p><p>SWIVELS, a kind of ring made to turn round in a ſtaple, or other ring.

The trunnions of this piece are contained in a sort of iron crotch, of which the lower end terminates in a cylindrical pivot reſting in the socket, ſo as to ſupport the weight of the cannon. The socket is bored in a ſtrong piece of oak, reinforced with iron hoops, in order to enable it to ſuſtain the recoil. By means of this frame, which is called the s<hi rend="italic">wivel,</hi> and an iron handle on its caſe cable, the gun may be directed by the hand to any object. It is therefore very neceſſary in the tops, particularly when loaded with muſket-balls, to fire down on the upper decks of the adverſary in action.</p><p>SWOONING.

For or before a duke, the blade muſt decline from the head, and be carried between the neck and the right ſhoulder. For or before an earl, the blade is to be carried between the point of the ſhoulder and the elbow : and for or before a baron, the blade is to be borne in the bend of the arm.

He studied at Magdalen-hall, Oxford ; but left that univerſity when Oxford was garrisoned for king Charles I. and went to London : where, becoming acquainted with Dr Thomas Cox, an eminent phyſician, that gentleman persuaded him to apply himſelf to the ſtudy of phyſic ; accordingly, after the garrison was delivered up to the parliament, he retired again to Magdalen-hall, entered on the ſtudy of medicine, and in 1648 was created bachelor of phyſic. Soon after, he was made a fellow of All-Souls college, and continued there ſeveral years : when, leaving the university, he ſettled at Weſtminſter, became doctor of his faculty at Cambridge ; grew famous for his practice ; and was the chief phyſician in London from the year 1660 to 1670 ; at which period he began to be diſabled by the gout. He died in 1689. His works are highly eſteemed both at home and abroad.
