Honey-dew, a sweet sticky substance is also secreted by some members of the family. The females are always wingless, but are provided with antennae, legs and well-developed mouth-parts. In some cases these organs are retained, in some they are lost in the encysted con-dition. The males, on the contrary, although sometimes wingless, are, as a rule, provided with a pair of large forewings and greatly reduced hind wings; their antennae and legs are longer than in the other sex, but the mouth-parts are reduced and functionless (see Economic Entomology).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
