It is a place of great antiquity. The town is laid out on a regular plan, and consists of a square, from the four corners of which diverge so many streets. It has an ancient cathedral, embosomed in trees, which, with the wooded banks of the bay, forms a remarkably beautiful feature in the appearance of the town. The harbour is spacious, but of little use, in consequence of being blocked up by the sand. The population amounted in 1831 to 1522.</p><p>Ross, <hi rend="italic">New.</hi> See New Ross.</p>
