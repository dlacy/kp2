When the province was made shire-ground by Elizabeth, in 1569, Sligo formed one of the seven counties into which it was divided ; but so far from being thus rendered amenable to the jurisdiction of that queen, it became the theatre of several conflicts in the war against O’Heil, chieftain of Tyrone, in the latter part of her reign. The most remarkable of these was that with Sir Conyers Clifford, who, in attempting to pass into the county from Roscommon with a body of from 1500 to 2000 men, in order to relieve Bel- leek, was attacked in a defile of the Curlew mountains by O’Roark, chieftain of Breffney, was himself killed, and bis troops were driven back with considerable loss. During the civil wars of 1641, the Irish kept possession of the open country until nearly its close, when they were reduced to submission by the parliamentary forces under Ireton. In the subsequent war of 1688, the county was held by the forces of King James for some time, but ultimately yielded to the victorious arms of William III. The French force which landed at Killalla under General Humbert in 1798, had a severe skirmish at Colooney with the Limerick militia, commanded by Colonel Vereker, which ended in the retreat of the latter.</p><p>The county includes an extensive line of sea-coast along its northern border, in which are the bays of Classy- vaun and Milkhaven in the north, and Brown Bay, which branches into the smaller and less frequented indentations of Drumcliff, Sligo, and Ballysadare Bays. Killalla Bay, to the west of the coιmty, belongs also to Mayo. The island of Innismurray lies about five miles off the northern coast, being separated from the mainland by a passage dangerous, except in moderate weather, from the number of reefs under water. The island itself rises precipitously on the ocean side, but shelves gradually downwards on that of the land : there is but one practicable landing-place. The whole surface extends over 209 acres, of which about 120 are arable, affording pasturage to a few cattle and sheep. There is also a large extent of bog. The inhabitants depend chiefly on the fishery, which in most seasons is abundant. The place is peculiarly remarkable for a small chapel or cell, celebrated for an image of its patron, St. Molasse. Near the chapel is a singular relic, called the cursing-stone, so named from a superstitious opinion of its efficacy in punishing guilt if appealed to according to an established form. The island is also a favourite burial place : males and females are interred in separate cemeteries.</p><p>The land rises into mountains of considerable height in its northern extremity. The principal of these are Benbulben, 1722 feet high; King’s mountain, 1527; Cullogherboy, 1430; and Truskmore, part Of which is in Læitrim, 2072. In the west are the ranges of the Slieve, Gamph, and Ox mountains, the highest points of which are 1321 and 1446 feet respectively. In the east Kishcorrin and Carriskea rise to the heights of 1183 and 1062 feet. The Curlew mountains in the south-east, between Roscommon and Sligo, only rise to the height of 863 feet. The entire surface of the county contains 449,013 acres of land, of which about 272,000 are capable of cultivation, and the remainder mountain or waste, and 12,740 acres under water. The principal rivers are the Moy, which forms the western boundary, separating the county from Mayo, and emptying itself into Killalla Bay; it is navigable to Ballina, six miles inland, for vessels of ten feet draught ; the Tinned, the Easkey, the Ballybeg, the Dun- neill, the Ballysadare river, with its branches the Owen- more, Owenbeg, and Arrow, or Unshin, and the Garvogue, a short but rapid stream, rising in Lough Gill, and passing through Sligo town into the bay of the same name. All these rivers have their sources within the county. The lakes are numerous, and several of them large ard highly picturesque. Lough Gill, the most northern, spreads over 3130 acres, besides a small portion in Leitrim ; its western side is richly planted, and in it are ten islands, the largest of which are Church Island, 41 acres, and Cottage Island, 13. Lough Arrow, in the east, 3010 acres, is of very irregular form, and contains the islands of Annagowla, 34 acres, Muck, 21, and Inish, 20; Lough Gara, in the south-east, 3683 acres, contains the islands of Derrymore, 33 acres, Inchmore, 21, and the smaller islands of Inch, Inchbeg, Eagle, Crow, and Derrynatallan. Lough Talt, in a basin of the Ox mountains, surrounded by projecting cliffs, 300 acres, and 455 fret above sea level, is remarkable for its abundance of trout, which vary in shape and flavour in various parts of the lake. Lough Easkey, 337 acres, lies in the same mountain range; Templehouse lake contains 356 acres, Cloonacleigha, 177. Smaller lakes are numerous in all parts.</p><p>The carboniferous, or mountain limestone, including the lower limestone, calp or black shale series, and the upper limestone, forms the basis of by much the greater portion of the county. A small tract of the yellow sandstone and conglomerate shews itself in the extreme north, as also on the north and east of Lough Gara, whence it penetrates, extending into Mayo. The old red sandstone, and sandstone conglomerate, appears in two masses near Lough Arrow, the southern and larger portion plunging deeply into the adjoining county of Leitrim. A very small portion of the granite formation, which lies between Lough Conn and Foxford, enters the county, giving place to a broad belt of trap porphyry, bounded by a narrow fringe of old red sandstone, and stretching in a north-eastern direction, along the line of the Ox mountains to Ballysadare Bay ; a mass of granite protrudes through the middle of this formation. To the south of the same bay, and west of Ballysadare town, is a small field of quartz rock. The sandstone in some tracts assumes an appearance which gave rise to the opinion that coal existed under it, but, on making the experiment, the hopes of the speculator were always baffled. Iron was procured in large quantities, particularly at the base of the Ox mountains, until the timber used as fuel for smelting was exhasted. Sulphate of copper and iron pyrites are frequently found in small pieces ; and pure copper occasionally in the beds of some of the rivers. Manganese has also been found in various places, and amethysts of large size near Ballymote.</p><p>The climate, owing to the proximity of the sea and the lofty tracts of mountains with which the county is intersected, is moist, and the weather extremely variable, the atmospheric changes being so frequent and sudden, as often to render the barometer an unsatisfactory test of the weather. The soil, in the mountainous districts, is a light sandy loam on a freestone bottom, interrupted by large patches of bog, and often overspread with a thin coat of turf mould. In the low country it is rich and deep, resting on a substratum of limestone, and suitable to the growth of every kind of agricultural produce. In many parts a superior stratum, called by the people lac-leigh, or the grey flag, is found incumbent on the limestone bottom. It is principally composed of silicious marl, in a state so compact, as to be impenetrable to water ; thus, by preventing the drainage of the surface, opposing what was for some time deemed an insurmountable obstacle to the successful culture of the land. But it was afterwards discovered, that deep trenching, so as to cut through the adhesive layer, not only served to carry off the water effectually, which now passed freely through the subjacent limestone gravel, but to add to the fertility of the soil ; the marl, when broken up and mixed with the surface mould, proving a valuable compost. Timber was abundant, until destroyed by the consumption of it required for the iron works, and by its lavish use for domestic and agricultural</p></body></text></TEI>
