writer, whilst the title bears 1606, the colophon bears “ Appresso i Giunti, 1583.” Vol. iii. editions are of 1556, 1565, and 1606.1  There is no practical difference between the first two, but that of 1606 has forty-five pages of important new matter, which embraces the Travels of Cesare Fedrici or Federici in India, one of the most valuable narratives of the 16th century, and Three Voyages of the Hollanders and Zealanders to Nova Zembla and Groenland. Vol. iii. also contains (omitting maps and figures inserted in the text, or with type on the reverse) a two-page topographical view of Cuzco, a folding map of Terra Nova and Labrador, a two-page map of Brazil, a two-page map of Guinea, &c., a two - page map of Sumatra, a two-page pictorial plan of the town of Hochelaga in New France, and a general map of the New World in a hemisphere. Brunet’s statement mentions issues of vol. ii. in 1561, and of vol. iii. in 1613 ; but these seem to have no existence. It would thus appear that a set of Ramusio, to be as complete as possible, should embrace—for vol. i., 1563 or any subsequent edition ; for vol. ii., 1583 or 1606 ; for vol. iii., 1606.
Besides the circumstances to he gathered from the Navigalioni regarding the Ramusio family see the iserfatoni FeiteZe of Emanuele Cigogna. Tliere is also in the British Museum Monografia letta il lit Marzo 1883 ... by Guglielmo Carradori, Rimini, 1883 ; but hardly anything has been found in this except the inscription quoted at the beginning of this article.    (H.

RANDERS, a town of Denmark, at the head of an amt in the province of North Jutland (Norrejylland), on the Gudenaa, about 8 miles above its junction with Randers Fjord, an inlet of the Cattegat. It is situated on the railway that runs south by Aarhuus to Fredericia, and has a branch line (1875) to Grenaa on the coast. Though a place of considerable antiquity—being mentioned in 1086 as the meeting-place of insurgents against Knud, the saint —Randers has few remains of old buildings and bears the stamp of a compact modern manufacturing town that owes its importance to its distilleries, dye-works, carriage-factories, salt-works, weaving-factories, tan-works, Ac. St Morten’s church dates from the 14th century, but has been frequently altered and enlarged down to 1869-70. Other buildings are the town-house (1778, restored 1858), the court-house (1860-62), the infirmary (1870), the almshouse (1868), the Jewish synagogue (1858), and the high school (1858; the institution founded by Christian III.). The population was 11,354 in 1870 and 13,457 in 1880.
Randers is best known in history as the scene of the assassination of Count Geerts by Niels Ebbeson in 1340. In the Middle Ages it had six churches and four monastic establishments—the oldest a Benedictine nunnery (1170). The Grey Friars’ building was turned into a castle (Dronningborg) after the Reformation ; its church was burned down in 1698.
RANDOLPH, John (1773-1833), of Roanoke, American statesman, was descended from an influential and wealthy Virginian family, and was the third and youngest son of John Randolph of Cawsons, Chesterfield county, where he was born on 2d June 1773. His father having died in his infancy, his early years were passed under the care of his stepfather. He attended schools at Williamsburg and Princeton and for a short time studied at Columbia College, New York, but, although well read in modern works bearing on politics and philosophy, his own statement, “ I am an ignorant man, sir,” was in other respects not inaccurate. Both his religious and his political views were radical and extreme. At an early period he imbibed deistical opinions, which he promulgated with extreme eagerness. He was also so strongly opposed to the new constitution of the United States that he could not bear to hear Washington take the oath to support it. In order to assist in asserting the right of resistance to national laws, and to withstand the “ encroachments of the administration upon the indisputable rights” of Virginia, he was in 1799 elected as a democrat to Congress, where he sat, with the exception of two terms, till 1825. After the election of Jefferson as president in 1801 Randolph was elected chairman of the committee of ways and means. He took an active part in agitating for the reform of the judiciary, and in 1804 moved the impeachment of Judge Chase. The part he took in this matter tended to widen his breach with Jefferson, from whom he finally separated in 1806. Possessing considerable wit, great readiness, and a showy if somewhat bombastic eloquence, he would undoubtedly have risen to high influence but for his strong vein of eccentricity and his bitter and ungovernable temper. The championship of State rights was carried by him to an extreme utterly quixotic, inasmuch as he not only asserted the constitutional right of Virginia to interpose her protest against the usurpation of power at Washington but claimed that the protest should be supported by force. On account of his opposition to the war with England in 1812 he was not returned to Congress in 1813, but he was re-elected in 1815. In 1825 he was elected to the United States Senate, where he continued to sit till 1827. In 1830 he was for a short time minister to Russia. He was elected to Congress in 1832, but died of consumption at Philadelphia before he took his seat, 24th May 1833. His last will was disputed in the law courts, and the jury returned a verdict that in the later years of his life he was not of sane mind.

Among several biographies of Randolph mention may be made of that by Hugh A. Garland, New־ York, 1850 (11th ed., 1857), and that by Henry Adams, forming vol. i. of the series of American Statesmen, edited by J. T. Morse, junior, Boston, 1883.
RANDOLPH, Thomas (1605-1634), an English poet, was born in Northamptonshire in 1605. He was educated at Westminster and Cambridge, and soon gave promise as a writer of comedy. Ben Jonson, not an easily satisfied critic, adopted him as one of his “ sons.” The ease and melody of his verse and the quickness of his wit and fancy justify the favour with which the youth was received by the magnates of literature. Unhappily he died under thirty in 1634, before his powers had reached their maturity. His principal works are—The Muses’ Looking-Glass, a Comedy ״, Amyntas, or the Impossible Dowry, a pastoral acted before the king and queen ; Aristippus, or the Jovial Philosopher״, The Conceited Pedlar; The Jealous Lovers, a Comedy; Hey for Honesty, down with Knavery, a Comedy״, and several other poems. His w־orks have recently been edited by W. Carew Hazlitt.
RANGOON TOWN, a district in the Pegu division of the province of British Burmah, situated in 16° 47' N. lat. and 96° 13' E. long., on the left bank of the Hlaing or Rangoon river at its junction ■with the Pegu and Pu-zwon-doung streams, 21 miles from the sea. In 1880 the town was detached from the surrounding area of the old district of Rangoon and constituted a separate district, the remainder of the country being formed into a distinct jurisdiction under the title of Hanthawady. The soil of Rangoon in the mountains and elevated tracts is grey sandy clay, and in the plains it is mostly alluvial mixed with earth of reddish colour, well suited for the growth of rice, vegetables, and fruit trees. The Rangoon river flows from the junction of the Panlaing and Hlaing rivers to the sea; from the sea to Rangoon it is navigable during the monsoons by vessels of the largest draught, and in the dry season by vessels of 1000 tons. Pu-zwon-doung creek empties itself into the Rangoon river at Battery Point. It is navigable during the spring tides of the southwest monsoon for cargo boats of 100 tons; near its junction with the Rangoon river is a small rock, dangerous to large vessels. The only lake of any importance is the Kandaugyi or Royal Lake within the Dalhousie Park. The chief products of the district are grains and pulses (principally rice), cotton, timber, and cutch (catechu) and gambier. Rangoon comprises an area of 22 square miles, with a population in 1881 of 134,176 (males 91,504, females 42,672); Hindus numbered 35,871, Mohammedans 21,169, Christians 9741, and Buddhists 67,131.
