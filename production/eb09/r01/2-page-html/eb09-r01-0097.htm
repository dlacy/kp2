<p><span class="font2">consul, and the seat of a local governor nominated by the  sháh. It is the centre of the silk trade, which once&nbsp;flourished so greatly in Persia as to show an annual export&nbsp;of nearly a million and a half pounds in weight, valued at&nbsp;£700, 000. In 1882, however, the prevalence of disease&nbsp;among the silkworms caused many of the peasants of Gilan&nbsp;to abandon the culture of silk in favour of rice, which&nbsp;became largely exported to Russia. But the geographical&nbsp;position of Rasht gives it a world-wide reputation irrespective of trade. If the roads by Trebizond, Erzeroum,&nbsp;and Tabriz on the one hand and by Poti, Tiflis, and Tabriz&nbsp;on the other can still be considered the two “commercial&nbsp;highways” from Europe to Persia, the line of land and&nbsp;water communication by Astrakhan and the south-eastern&nbsp;shores of the Caspian has a good claim to be called the&nbsp;true modern highway for travellers and diplomatists moving&nbsp;in the same direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rasht was visited in 1739 by “two English gentlemen from Petersburg, ” whose narrative, published three years later, contains&nbsp;much interesting information on the existing relations of Gilan with&nbsp;Russia. It is noteworthy, but not astonishing, to find that in&nbsp;those days the shah (Nádir Κúli) was himself “in a manner the&nbsp;sole merchant or trader in all Persia. ” In 1744 Jonas Hanway&nbsp;came there also; but no fuller account of the capital of Gilan has&nbsp;perhaps ever been recorded than that of Samuel Gmelin in 1771,&nbsp;when Hidáiyat Khan ruled the province, and Karim Khan Zend&nbsp;was sovereign of Persia. Gmelin was received with extraordinary&nbsp;honours, as an imperial officer of Russia, and every opportunity&nbsp;was afforded him of observing the country, its features and produce,&nbsp;and of acquainting himself with the manners and customs of the&nbsp;inhabitants. In 1882 a concession for the construction of a railway&nbsp;from Rasht to Teheran, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">via</span><span class="font1"> Kazvin, was granted to a M. Boital.&nbsp;It is probable that no more practical effect will be given to this&nbsp;scheme than to that of Baron de Reuter some ten years before.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RASK, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rasmus Christian</span><span class="font2"> (1787-1832), an eminent scholar and philologist, was born at Brändekilde in the&nbsp;Island of Fünen or Fyen in Denmark in 1787. He&nbsp;studied at the university of Copenhagen, and early distinguished himself by singular talent for the acquisition&nbsp;of languages. In the year 1808 he was appointed assistant&nbsp;keeper of the university library, and some years after&nbsp;wards made professor of literary history. In 1811 he&nbsp;published, in Danish, his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Introduction to the Grammar of&nbsp;the Icelandic and other Ancient Northern Languages,</span><span class="font2"> from&nbsp;printed and MS. materials which had been accumulated&nbsp;by his predecessors in the same field of research. The&nbsp;reputation which Rask thus acquired recommended him to&nbsp;the Arna-Magnæan Institution, by which he was employed&nbsp;as editor of the Icelandic </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lexicon</span><span class="font2"> (1814) of Björn Haldor-son, which had long remained in manuscript. About the&nbsp;same time Rask paid a visit to Iceland, where he remained&nbsp;from 1813 to 18Î5, and made himself completely master&nbsp;of the language and familiarized himself with the literature, manners, and customs of the natives. To the interest&nbsp;with which they inspired him may probably be attributed&nbsp;the establishment at Copenhagen, early in 1816, of the&nbsp;Icelandic Literary Society, which was mainly instituted&nbsp;by his exertions, and of which he was the first president.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In October 1816 Rask left Denmark on a literary expedition, at the cost of the king, to prosecute inquiries&nbsp;into the languages of the East, and collect manuscripts&nbsp;for the university library at Copenhagen. He proceeded&nbsp;first to Sweden, where he remained two years, in the&nbsp;course of which he made an excursion into Finland, for&nbsp;the purpose of studying the language of that country.&nbsp;Here he published, in Swedish, his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anglo-Saxon Grammar&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">in 1817. In 1818 there appeared at Copenhagen, in&nbsp;Danish, an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on the Origin of the Ancient Scandinavian or Icelandic Tongue,</span><span class="font2"> in which he traced the affinity&nbsp;of that idiom to the other European languages, particularly to the Latin and the Greek. In the same year he&nbsp;brought out the first complete editions of Snorro’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Edda&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and Sæmund’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Edda,</span><span class="font2"> in the original text, along with&nbsp;Swedish translations of both </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eddas,</span><span class="font2"> the originals and the&nbsp;versions occupying each two volumes. From Stockholm&nbsp;he went in 1819 to St Petersburg, where he wrote, in&nbsp;German, a paper on “The Languages and Literature of&nbsp;Norway, Iceland, Sweden, and Finland, ” which was published in the sixth number of the Vienna </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jahrbücher.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">From Russia he proceeded through Tartary into Persia,&nbsp;and resided for some time at Tabriz, Teheran, Persepolis,&nbsp;and Shiraz. In about six weeks he made himself sufficiently master of the Persian to be able to converse&nbsp;freely in that language with the natives. In 1820 he&nbsp;embarked at Bushire for Bombay; and during his residence&nbsp;in the latter city he wrote, in English, “ A Dissertation on&nbsp;the Authenticity of the Zend Language” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Trans. Lit. Soc.&nbsp;of Bombay,</span><span class="font2"> vol. iii., reprinted with corrections and additions in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Trans. R.</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font2">. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Soc. </span><span class="font2">) From Bombay he proceeded&nbsp;through India to Ceylon, where he arrived in 1822, and&nbsp;soon afterwards wrote, in English, “A Dissertation respecting the best Method of expressing the Sounds of the&nbsp;Indian Languages in European Characters, ” which was&nbsp;printed in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions of the Literary and Agricultural&nbsp;Society of Colombo.</span><span class="font2"> Rask returned to Copenhagen in May&nbsp;1823, bringing with him a considerable number of Oriental&nbsp;manuscripts, Persian, Zend, Pali, Singalese, and others,&nbsp;which now enrich the collections of the Danish capital.&nbsp;He died at Copenhagen on 14th November 1832.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the period between his return from the East and his death Rask published in his native language a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spanish Grammar&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1824), a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Frisic Grammar</span><span class="font1"> (1825), an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on Danish Orthography&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1826), a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise respecting the Ancient Egyptian Chronology</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Italian Grammar</span><span class="font1"> (1827), and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ancient Jewish Chronology&nbsp;previous to Moses</span><span class="font1"> (1828). He likewise edited an edition of Schneider’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Danish Grammar for the use of Englishmen</span><span class="font1"> (1830), and superintended the English translation of his valuable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anglo-Saxon&nbsp;Grammar</span><span class="font1"> by Thorpe (1830). Rask’s services to comparative&nbsp;philology were very great. He was the first to point out the connexion between the ancient Northern and Gothic on the one hand,&nbsp;and of the Lithuanian, Sclavonic, Greek, and Latin on the other,&nbsp;and he also has the credit of being the real discoverer of the so-called “ Grimm’s Law ” for the transmutation of consonants in the&nbsp;transition from the old Indo-European languages to Teutonic,&nbsp;although he only compared Teutonic and Greek, Sanskrit being at&nbsp;the time unknown to him. Rask’s facility in the acquisition of&nbsp;languages was extraordinary; in 1822 he was master of no less&nbsp;than twenty-five languages and dialects, and is stated to have&nbsp;studied twice as many. His numerous philological manuscripts&nbsp;were transferred to the king’s library at Copenhagen. Rask’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anglo-Saxon, Danish,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Icelandic Grammars</span><span class="font1"> have been given&nbsp;to the English public by Thorpe, Repp, and Dasent respectively.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RASTATT, or </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rastadt,</span><span class="font2"> a small town in Baden, is situated on the Murg, 4 miles above its junction with&nbsp;the Rhine and 12 miles south-west of Carlsruhe. It&nbsp;is a fortress of great strength, commanding the passage&nbsp;through the Black Forest. The only notable building is&nbsp;the old palace of the margraves of Baden, a large Renaissance edifice in red sandstone, now partly used for military&nbsp;purposes and containing a collection of pictures, antiquities,&nbsp;and trophies from the Turkish wars. The industry of&nbsp;Rastatt is almost confined to local needs, and the town&nbsp;may be said to live on the garrison, which forms nearly&nbsp;half of its population (1880) of 12, 356. Two-thirds of&nbsp;the inhabitants are Roman Catholics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Previous to the close of the 17th century Rastatt was a place of no importance, but after its destruction by the French in 1689 it&nbsp;was rebuilt on a larger scale by Margrave Lewis, the well-known&nbsp;imperial general in the Turkish wars, and became the residence of&nbsp;the margraves of Baden down to 1771. In 1714 the preliminary&nbsp;articles of the peace between Austria and France, ending the War&nbsp;of the Spanish Succession, were signed here. The congress of&nbsp;Rastatt in 1797-99 had for its object the re-arrangement of the&nbsp;man of Germany by providing compensation for those princes who&nbsp;had relinquished to France territory on the left bank of the Rhine.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
