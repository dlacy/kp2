<p><span class="font0">Pannonia) laid the south-eastern Slavs under a deep debt by inventing the GIagolitie </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.), not</span><span class="font0"> the so-called “ Cyrillic ”&nbsp;alphabet (based on Greek cursive) and translating parts of the&nbsp;Scriptures into Slavonic (the dialect of the Slavs of Macedonia).&nbsp;The most brilliant period of the old Bulgarian kingdom was&nbsp;the reign of Simeon (893-927), who extended the realm westward to the shores of the Adriatic and took the title “ Tsar&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">li.e.</span><span class="font0"> Caesar] of Bulgaria and autocrator of the Romans.”&nbsp;The aggression against the Empire which marked his ambitious&nbsp;reign ceased under his successor Peter, who married a daughter&nbsp;of Romanus I., and the Bulgarian Patriarchate founded by&nbsp;Simeon was recognized at Byzantium. But the Byzantine&nbsp;rulers only waited for a favourable time to reduce this formidable Slavonic state. At length Zimisces subjugated eastern&nbsp;Bulgaria and recovered the Danube frontier. But while&nbsp;Basil II. was engaged in contending with rivals, the heroic&nbsp;Samuel (of the Shishmanid family) restored the Bulgarian&nbsp;power and reduced the Servians. After a long and arduous&nbsp;war of fourteen years Basil (called the “ Bulgar-slayer ”)&nbsp;subdued all Bulgaria Avestern and eastern (1018). He treated&nbsp;the conquered people with moderation, leaving them their&nbsp;political institutions and their autocephalous church, and to&nbsp;the nobility their privileges. Some Bulgarian noble families&nbsp;and members of the royal house were incorporated in the&nbsp;Greek nobility; there was Shishmanid blood in the families&nbsp;of Comnenus and Ducas. Greek domination was now&nbsp;established in the peninsula for more than 150 years. The&nbsp;Slavs of Greece had in the middle of the 9th century been&nbsp;brought under the control of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the reign of Basil II. the Russian question also was settled. The Russian state (sec </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Russia)</span><span class="font0"> had been founded before the&nbsp;middle of the 9th century by Norsemen from Sweden, who were&nbsp;known in eastern Europeas Russians (’Ρώΐ), with its centres at&nbsp;Novgorod and Kiev. They did for the eastern Slavs what the&nbsp;Bulgarians had done for the Slavs of Moesia. The Dnieper&nbsp;and Dniester gave them access to the Euxine, and the Empire&nbsp;was exposed to their maritime attacks (Constantinople was in&nbsp;extreme danger in 860 and 941), which recall the Gothic expeditions of the 3rd century. In 945 a commercial treaty was&nbsp;concluded, and the visit of the princess Olga to Byzantium&nbsp;(towards the end of the reign of the learned emperor Constantine VII., Porphyrogennetos) and her baptism seemed a pledge&nbsp;of peace. But Olga’s conversion had no results. Sviatoslav&nbsp;occupied Bulgaria and threatened the Empire, but was decisively&nbsp;defeated by Zimisces </span><span class="font1">(971), </span><span class="font0">and this was virtually the end of&nbsp;the struggle. In 988 Prince Vladimir captured Cherson, but&nbsp;.restored it to the emperor Basil, who gave him his sister Anna&nbsp;in marriage, and he accepted Christianity for himself and his&nbsp;people. After this conversion and alliance, Byzantium had&nbsp;little to fear from Kiev, which came under its influence. One&nbsp;hostile expedition (1043) indeed is recorded, but it was a failure.&nbsp;IvIuch about the same time that the Russians had founded&nbsp;their state, the Magyars (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hungary;</span><span class="font0"> the Greeks called them&nbsp;Turks) migrated westward and occupied the regions between&nbsp;the Dnieper and the Danube, while beyond them, pressing on&nbsp;their heels, were another new people, the Petchencgs (Patzinaks).&nbsp;The policy of Byzantium was to make use of the Magyars as a&nbsp;cheek on the Bulgarians, and so wc find the Romans (under&nbsp;Leo VI.) and the IVIagyars co-operating against the tsar Simeon.&nbsp;But Simeon played the same game more effectively by using&nbsp;the Petchenegs against the Magyars, and the result was that&nbsp;the Magyars before the end of the 9th century were forced to&nbsp;move westward into their present country, and their place was&nbsp;taken by the Petchenegs. From their new seats the Magyars&nbsp;could invade the Empire and threatened the coast towns of&nbsp;Dalmatia. The conquest of Bulgaria made the Petchcnegs&nbsp;immediate neighbours of the Empire, and during the nth&nbsp;century the depredations of these irreclaimable savages, who&nbsp;filtered into the Balkan peninsula, constantly preoccupied the&nbsp;government. In 1064 they were driven from the Dniester&nbsp;regions into Little Walachia by the Kumans (or PoIovtsi), a&nbsp;people of the same ethnical group as themselves. They were&nbsp;crushingly defeated by Alexius Comncnus in 1091, and exterminated by John Comncnus in 1123.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Macedonian period a grave domestic question troubled the government. This was the growth of the large estates of&nbsp;the rich nobles of Asia Minor, at the expense of small properties,&nbsp;to an excess which was politically and economically dangerous.&nbsp;The legislation against the evil began under Romanus I. and&nbsp;was directed to the defence of the poor against the rich, and&nbsp;to protecting the military organization which was based on&nbsp;holdings of land to which the obligation of military service was&nbsp;attached. There was also danger in the excessive influence of&nbsp;rich and powerful families, from which the great military&nbsp;officers were drawn, and which were extensively related by&nbsp;alliances among themselves. The danger was realized in the&nbsp;struggle which Basil II. had to sustain with the families of&nbsp;Sclerus and Phocas. Various kinds of legislation were attempted. Under Romanus I. alienation of property to the&nbsp;large landowners was forbidden. Niccphorus Phocas, whose&nbsp;sympathies were with the aristocracy to which he belonged,&nbsp;holding that there had been enough legislation in favour of the&nbsp;poor, sought to meet the difficulty of maintaining a supply of&nbsp;military lands in the future by forbidding further acquisitions&nbsp;of estates by the Church. Basil II. returned to the policy of&nbsp;Romanus, but, with much greater severity, resorting to confiscation of some of the immense private estates; and he endeavoured to keep down the aristocrats of Asia Minor by very&nbsp;heavy taxation. Through the recovery of the Balkan provinces&nbsp;he gained in Europe a certain political counterpoise to the&nbsp;influence of Asia Minor, which had been preponderant since the&nbsp;seventh century. Asia Minor meant the army, and opposition&nbsp;to its influence expressed itself in the nth century in a fatal&nbsp;anti-military policy, which is largely responsible for the conquests&nbsp;of a new enemy, the Seljuk Turks, who now entered into the&nbsp;inheritance of the Caliphs (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Caliphate </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ad fin,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Seljuks).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Constantinople was haunted by the dread of a military usurpation. An attempt of the military hero George Maniaccs (who&nbsp;had made a remarkable effort to recover Sicily) to wrest the&nbsp;crown f rom Constantine IX. had failed ; and when Isaac&nbsp;Comnenus, who represented the military aristocrats of Asia&nbsp;Minor, ascended the throne, he found himself soon compelled to&nbsp;abdicate, in face of the opposition. The reign of Constantine X.,&nbsp;of the rival family of Ducas, marked the culmination of this&nbsp;antagonism. The senate was filled with men of the lower&nbsp;classes, and the military budget was ruthlessly cut down. This&nbsp;policy reduced the army and stopped the supply of officers,&nbsp;since there was no longer hope of a profitable career. The&nbsp;emperor thought to meet dangers from external enemies by&nbsp;diplomacy. The successes of the Seljuks (after the fall of the&nbsp;great Armenian fortress of Ani in 1064) at length awoke the&nbsp;government from its dream of security. The general Romanus&nbsp;Diogenes was proclaimed emperor. He had to create an army&nbsp;and to train it; he did not spare himself, but it was too late.&nbsp;He was defeated and captured by Alp Arslan on the decisive&nbsp;field of Manzikert (1071). Released by the sultan, who honoured&nbsp;his bravery, he was deposed in favour of Michael Ducas, and&nbsp;falling into the hands of his enemies, was blinded. The east and&nbsp;centre of Asia Minor were thus lost; the Seljuk kingdom of&nbsp;Rum was founded; Nicaea was captured by the Turks in 10S0.&nbsp;The provinces which escaped the Seljuk occupation were&nbsp;thoroughly disorganized, a prey to foreign and native adventurers and usurpers (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Seljuks).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus in the ’seventies of the nth century the Empire seemed through incompetence and frivolity to have been brought te&nbsp;the verge of dissolution. The disorder was terminated by the&nbsp;accession of the extraordinarily able statesman Alexius Com-nenus (io8:), who effected a reconciliation with the rival family&nbsp;of Ducas, established a strong government and founded a&nbsp;dynasty. Hc had to deal with three great dangers—the Scljuks,&nbsp;the Pctehcnegs (see above), and in the west the Normans. The&nbsp;Normans had wrested from East Rome its possessions in South&nbsp;Italy (1041-71 ; sec </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Normans)</span><span class="font0">—succeeding where German&nbsp;emperors had failed—and throughout the Comnenian period</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
