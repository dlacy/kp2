The body was bulky and round, and from the ſhoulder ran a line, or fold, as in the ſingle-horned rhinoceros, though it was but faintly marked. There were ſeveral other folds and wrinkles on the body and legs ; and the whole gave rather the appearance of ſoftneſs : the legs were thick, ſhort, and remarkably ſtrong· ; the feet armed with three diſtinct hoofs, of a blackiſh colour, which ſurrounded half the foot, one in front, the others on each ſide.— The ſoles of the feet were convex, of a light colour, and the cuticle on them not thicker than that on the foot of a man who is uſed to walking ; the teſticles Hardly appeared externally ; the penis was bent backward, and opened about 18 inches below the anus. At its origin it was as thick as a man’s leg, and about two feet and a half long ; the bend in it occaſions the urine to be diſcharged backwards. The glans is very ſingular ; the opening of the urethra is like the mouth of a cup with its brim bending over a little and is about three quarters of an inch in diameter ; the glans here is about half an inch in diameter, and continues that thick-neſs for an inch and a half : it is then inſerted into another cup like the firſt, but three times as large ; the glans afterwards gradually becomes thicker, and at about nine inches from the opening of the urethra are placed two bodies on the upper part of the glans, very like the nipples of a milch-cow, and as large ; theſe become turgid when the penis is erected ; the whole of this is contained in the prepuce, and may be conſidered as glans. From the os pubis ariſes a ſtrong muſcle, which ſoon becomes tendinous : this tendon is continued along the back or upper part of the penis ; it is flattened, is about the ſize of a man’s little finger, and is inſerted into the upper part of the glans, near the end. The uſe of this muſcle is to ſtraiten the penis. On the under ſide of the penis there are two muſcles, antagoniſts to the above ; they ariſe from the os ifchium fleſhy, run along tlie lower ſide of the penis, on each ſide of the corpus ſpongioſum, and are inſerted fleſhy into the lower ſide of the glans ; the action of theſe muſcles will draw in the penis, and bend it. The male has two nipples, like the female, ſituated between the hind legs; they are about half an inch in length, of a pyramidal form, rounded at the end.</p><p>" The whole ſkin of the animal is rough, and covered very thinly with ſhort black hair. The ſkin was not more than one third of an inch in thickneſs at the ſtrongeſt part ; under the belly it was hardly a quarter of an inch ; any part of it might be cut through with eaſe by a common diſſecting knife. The animal had not that appearance of armour which is obſerved in the ſingle-horned rhinoceros. Since I diſſected the male, I have had an opportunity of examining a female, which was more of a lead colour : it was younger than the male, and had not ſo many folds or wrinkles in its ſkin; of courſe it had ſtill leſs the appearance of armour. The only external mark which diſtinguiſhes it from the male is the vagina, which is cloſe to the anus ; whereas in the male the opening for the penis is 18 inches below the anus.”</p><p>From the difference between this account and Spar-man’s, which in ſome particulars is conſiderable, and from the difference of ſhape, we are diſpoſed to think them varieties. Mr Bruce’s drawing of the rhinoceros bicornis is unqueſtionably a deception ; the body of the animal, as there repreſented, correſponds exactly with that of the unicornis except in its having two horns on its head. In the muſeum of the late Dr William Hunter, the two-horned animal was preſerved, agreeing exactly with the general accounts and figures we have of that animal, but differing eſſentially from Mr Bruce’s. For further particulars reſpecting theſe curious animals, we refer to Buffon, vol. vi. p. 92—117 ; Sparman's Voyage to the Cape, vol. ii. chap. 12.; and Bruce’s Travels, vol. iv. p. 296, &amp;c. and Appendix, p. 85, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="italic">RHINOCEROS-Bird.</hi>  See Buceros.</p><p>RHITΥΜΝΑ.

Theſe plants are natives of the Eaſt and weſt Indies, and often grow 40 or 50 feet high. They grow only in water and 011 the banks of rivers, where the tide flows up twice a-day. They preſerve the verdure of their leaves throughout the year. From the loweſt branches iffue long roots, which hang down to the water, and penetrate into the earth. In this poſition they reſemble ſo many arcades, from five to ten feet high, which ſerve to ſupport the body of the tree, and even to advance it daily into the bed of the water. Theſe arcades are ſo cloſely intertwiſted one with another, that they form a kind of natural and tranſparent terrace, raiſed with ſuch ſolidity over the water, that one might walk upon them, were it not that the branches are too much encumbered with leaves. The moſt natural way of propagating theſe trees, is to ſuffer the ſeveral ſlender ſmall filaments which iſſue from the main branches to take root in the earth.
