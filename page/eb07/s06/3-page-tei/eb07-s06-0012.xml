Castle Coll, which is situated on the east side of the county, on a stream that falls into the Brora, has an exterior circumference of fifty-four yards, with walls four yards and a half thick at the base, inclining inwards nine inches in every three feet in height ; and two small apartments on each side of the door-way, as if intended for guard-rooms. The highest part of the wall is now only eleven feet high, but old people remember it twice that height. Dun Dornadil is in the parish of Durness, on the northern side of the county. It is a building of the same character with the former, but still more dilapidated, and is celebrated in the ancient Gaelic ballads as a place of renown at a very early period. The ruins of Dornoch cathedral still display the original grandeur of that edifice, which is said to have been built in the eleventh century, and repaired and enlarged in the thirteenth. Circular cairns with subterraneous passages, tumuli, and some small forts, may yet be traced in various situations along the coast.</p><p>The county sends one member to parliament ; and the town of Dornoch joins with Cromarty, Dingwall, Tain, Wick, and Kirkwall, in electing one for the Scotish burghs.</p><p>The population, according to the census of 1801, was 23,117, in 1811 it amounted to 23,629, in 1821 to 23,840, and in 1831 to 25,518, of which 12,090 were males, and 13,428 were females. The families employed in agriculture were 3567, in trade and manufactures 409, in all other occupations 1029.</p><p>New Statistical Account of Scotland ; Henderson’s General View of the County of Sutherland ; Loch’s Account of the Improvements of the Marquis of Stafford in Sutherland ; and Cunningham’s Essay on the Geology of the County, in Quarterly Journal of Agriculture, No. xlvi.</p><p>SUTLER, one who follows the army, and furnishes the troops with provision. Sutlers pitch their tents or build their huts in the rear of each regiment, and about headquarters.</p><p>SUTTON-COLDFIELD, a town in the hundred of Hemlingford and county of Warwick, 112 miles from London. It is situated on a bleak hill in a very extensive parish. It has a good church, with a high square tower. The town is neat, and contains many comfortable residences. There is a market on Wednesday, and several fairs. The inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in the manufacture of articles connected with the Birmingham trade, amounted in 1821 to 3466, and in 1831 to 3684.</p><p>SUTULEGE, a celebrated river of Hindustan, and the easternmost of those five rivers which are called the Punjab. It has its rise in the lofty ridge of the Himalaya Mountains, and flows in a southerly direction, bounding to the east the country of Lahore, where it enters Hindustan at Bellaspoor. The stream is 100 yards wide when the waters are at the lowest. About the middle of its course it is joined by the Beyah or Hyphasis, in the latitude of 30. N., after which the united stream takes the name of Kirah. It falls into the Indus near the 29th degree, about eighty miles below Moultan. It is navigable 200 miles above its conflux with the lndus. The length of its course, including its windings, may be 600 miles.</p><p>SWAFFHAM, a town of the hundred of South Greenhoe, in the county of Norfolk, ninety-three miles from London. It is well built, in a pleasant and healthful district. The church is of the cathedral form, with an elegant turret and steeple. It is not a place of much trade, but has a good market on Saturday. In the market is a handsome cross erected at the expense of the earl of Orford. The number of inhabitants amounted in 1811 to 2350, in 1821 to 2836, and in 1831 to 3285.</p><p>SWALLY, a seaport of Hindustan, province of Gujerat, situated at the mouth of the Taptee river; twenty miles' west by south of Surat, of which it may be considered as the port.

E.</p><p>SWAMMERDAM, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi>, a celebrated natural philosopher, was the son of John James Swammerdam, an apothecary and naturalist of Amsterdam, and was born in 1637. His father intended him for the church, and with this view had him instructed in Latin and Greek ; but thinking himself unequal to so serious a vocation, he prevailed with his father to consent to his applying himself to physic. As he was kept at home till he should be properly qualified to engage in that study, he was frequently employed in cleaning his father’s curiosities, and putting every thing in its proper place. This inspired him with an early taste for natural history ; so that, not content with the survey of the curiosities which his father had purchased, he soon began to make a collection of his own, which he compared with the accounts given of them by the best writers. When grown up, he seriously attended to his anatomical and medical studies ; yet spent part of the day and the night in discovering, catching, and examining the flying insects proper to those times, not only in the province of Holland, but in those of Guelderland and Utrecht. Thus initiated in natural history, he went to the university of Leyden in 1651 ; and in 1653 was admitted a candidate of physic in that university. His attention being now engaged by anatomy, he began to consider how the parts of the body, prepared by dissection, could be preserved, and kept in constant order for anatomical dcmonstration ; and here he succeeded as he had done before in his nice contrivances for dissecting and managing the minutest insects. He afterwards made a journey into France, where he spent some time at Saumur, and where he became acquainted with several learned men. In 1667 he returned to Leyden, and took the degree of M. D. The next year the grand duke of Tuscany being in Holland in order to see the curiosities of thc country, came to view those of the father and the son ; and on this occasion Swammerdam made some anatomical dissections of insects in the presence of that prince, who was struck with admiration at his great skill in managing them, especially at his proving that the future butterfly lay with all its parts neatly folded up in a caterpillar, by actually removing the integuments that covered the former, and extricating and exhibiting all its parts, however minute, with incredible ingenuity, by means of instruments of inconceivable fineness. On this occasion the duke offered him 12,000 florins for his share of the collection, on condition of his removing them himself into Tuscany, and coming to live at the court of Florence ; but Swammerdam, who hated a court life, declined his highness’s proposal. In 1663, he published a General History of Insects. About this time, his father began to take offence at his inconsiderately neglecting the practice of physic, which might have supported him in affluence ; and would neither supply him with money nor clothes. This reduced him to some difficulties. In 1675 he published his History of the Ephemeras ; and his father dying the same year, left him a fortune sufficient for his support ; but he did not long survive him, for he died in 1682. Gaubius gave a translation of all his works from the orginal Dutch into Latin, from which they were translated into English, and published in folio, in 1758. Boerhaave wrote his life.</p><p>SWAN <hi rend="smallcaps">Isles,</hi> a cluster of small rocky islets, which lie between the north coast of Van Diemen’s Land and the south of New Holland. They are uninhabited.</p><p>SWANAGE, a town of the hundred of Rowbarrow, in the county of Dorset, on the isle of Purbeck, 127 miles from London. It stands on the sea-shore. A large quantity of stone is shipped from this place for London. The population amounted in 1811 to 1483, in 1821 to 1607, and in 1831 to 1734.</p></body></text></TEI>
