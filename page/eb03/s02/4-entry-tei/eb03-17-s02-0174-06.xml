 in botany: A genus of the angioſpermia order, belonging to the didynamia claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 40th order, <hi rend="italic">Perſonatae.</hi> The calyx is quinqueſid; the corolla almoſt globoſe, and reſupinated; the capſule bilocular. There are ſeveral ſpecies, of which the moſt remarkable are, 1. <hi rend="italic">Nodosa,</hi> or the common figwort, which grows in woods and hedges. The root is tuberous; the ſtalks are four or five feet high, and branched towards the top; the leaves are heart- ſhaped, ſerrated, and acute. The flowers are of a dark red colour, ſhaped like a cap or helmet; the lower lip greeniſh: they grow in looſe dichotomous ſpikes or <hi rend="italic">racemi</hi> at the top of the branches. The leaves have a fetid ſmell and bitter taſte. A decoction of them is ſaid to cure hogs of the meaſles. An ointment made of the root was formerly uſed to cure the piles and ſcrophulous sores, but is at preſent out of practice. 2. <hi rend="italic">Aquatica,</hi> water-figwort, or betony. The root is fibrous; ſtem erect, ſquare, about four feet high. The leaves are oppoſite, elliptical, pointed, ſlightly ſcalloped, on decurrent footſtalks. Flowers purple, in looſe naked ſpikes. It grows on the ſides of rivulets and other wet places, and has a fetid ſmell, though not ſo ſtrong as the preceding. The leaves are uſed in medicine as a corrector of ſena, and in powder to promote ſneezing. 3. <hi rend="italic">Scorodonia,</hi> or balm-leaved figwort. The ſtem is erect, ſquare, about two feet high. The leaves are oppoſite, doubly ſerrated. The flowers are duſky purple, in compoſite bunches. It grows on the banks of rivulets, &amp;c. in Cornwall. 4. V <hi rend="italic">ernalis,</hi> or yellow fig- wort. The ſtalks are ſquare, hairy, brown, about two feet high. The leaves are heart-ſhaped, roundiſh, hairy, indented, oppoſite. The flowers are yellow, on ſingle forked footſtalks from the alæ of the leaves. It grows in hedges in Surry.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
