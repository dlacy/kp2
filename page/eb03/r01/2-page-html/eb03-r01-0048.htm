<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pencil pf </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Rays,</span><span class="font2"> a number of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">rays </span><span class="font2">iſſuing from a point of an object, and diverging in the form of a&nbsp;cone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAZOR, a well-known inſtrument, uſed by fur-gcons, barbers, &amp;c. for (having off the hair from va-rious parts of the body.—As ſhaving to many people is a moſt painful operation, cutlers in different cotιn-tries have long applied their ſkill to remove that inconvenience. Some have invented ſoaps of a peculiar&nbsp;kind to make the operation more eaſy, and ſome have&nbsp;invented ſtraps. with reſpect to razors, ſome artiſts have&nbsp;ſucceeded rather by accident than from any fixed principle ; and therefore we have found great inequality in&nbsp;the goodnefs of razors made by the ſame artiſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A correſpondent aſſures us, that he has for 40 years paſt been at much pains to find out razors made by the&nbsp;beſt makers both in England and Scotland, and was fortunate enough, about 22 years ago, to diſcover a kind&nbsp;made by a Scotchman of the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Logan,</span><span class="font2"> which&nbsp;he called magnetical razors, becauſe they were directed&nbsp;to be touched with an artificial magnet before ufing.&nbsp;Theſe, our friend aſſures us, are moſt excellent razors,&nbsp;and he has uſed them for upwards of 20 years. He fays&nbsp;likewiſe that they continue in good order, without requiring to be ground ; but that the great draw-back&nbsp;on their being generally uſed, is the price, which is&nbsp;higher than moſt people are able or diſpoſed to give&nbsp;' for that jnſtrument. ‘ ûur correſpondent, who reſides&nbsp;in the vicinity of London, alio informs us, that lately&nbsp;the famous ſurgeon’s inſtrument-maker, Mr Savigny in&nbsp;Pall Mall, after numberleſs experiments, in the courſe&nbsp;of above 20 years, has at length brought razors to a&nbsp;degree of perfection never yet equalled ; and with ſuch&nbsp;certainty, that the purchaſer is in no danger of a diſappointment, though the price is very moderate. By&nbsp;theſe, we are told, the operation of ſtiaving is performed with greater eaſe, more perfectly, and more ex-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">peditiouſiy, than with any other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RE, in grammar, an inſeparable particle added to the beginning of words to double or otherwiſe modify their meaning ; as in re-action, re-move, τe-export,&nbsp;&amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RE-ACTION, in phyfiology, the refiſtance made by all bodies to the action or impulſe of others that&nbsp;endeavour to change its ſtate whether of motion or&nbsp;reſt, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">READING, the art of delivering written language with propriety, force, and elegance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; we muſt not judge ſo unfavourably of eloquence or good reading (ſays the illuſtrious Fenelon), as to&nbsp;reckon it only a frivolous art, that a declaimer uſes to&nbsp;impoſe upon the weak imagination of the multitude,&nbsp;and to ſerve his own ends. It is a very ſerious art,&nbsp;defigned to inſtruct people ; to ſuppreſs their paſſions&nbsp;and reform their manners ; to ſupport the laws, direct&nbsp;public councils, and to make men good and happy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reaſon and experience demonſtrate, that </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">delivery in reading ought to be leſs animated thaq in interefledſpeaking.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">In every exerciſe of the faculty of ſpeech, and thoſe expreſſions of countenance and geſture with which it is&nbsp;generally attended^ wε may be confidered to be always&nbsp;in one of the two following fituations : Firſt, delivering&nbsp;our </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">boſom fentiτnents</span><span class="font2"> on circumſtances which relate to&nbsp;ourſelves or others, or, ſecondly, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">repeating</span><span class="font2"> ſomething&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">that was ſpoken on a certain occaſion for the amuſe-</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ment or information of an auditor. Now, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">if we obſerve </span><span class="font2">the deliveries natural to theſe two ſituations, we ſſiall&nbsp;find, that the firſt may be accompanied with every degree of expreſſion which can manifeſt itſelf in us, from&nbsp;the loweſt of ſympathy to the moſt violent and energe-tic of the ſuperior paſſions ; while the latter, from the&nbsp;ſpeaker’s chief buiineſs being to repeat what he heard&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">with accuracy,</span><span class="font2"> diſcovers only a faint imitation of thoſe&nbsp;ſigns of the emotions which we ſuppoſe agitated him&nbsp;from whom the words were firſt borrowed.—The uſe&nbsp;and neceſſity of this difference of manner is evident ; .&nbsp;and if we are attentive to theſe natural figns of ex-preſſion, we ſliall find them conforming with the great-eſt nicety to the ſlighteſt and moſt minute movements&nbsp;of the breaſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This repetition of another’s words might be ſuppoſed. to paſs through the mouth oſ a ſecond or third perſon ;&nbsp;and in theſe caſes, ſince they were not ear and eye wit-neſſes of him who firſt ſpoke them, their manner oſ de-livery would want the advantage neceſſarily arifing from&nbsp;an immediate idea of the original one ; hence, on this&nbsp;account, this would be a ſtill lefs lively repreſentation than&nbsp;that of the firft </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">repeater.</span><span class="font2"> But as, from a daily obſervation&nbsp;of every variety of ſpeeeh and its aſſociated figns of emo-tion, mankind foon become pretty well acquainted with&nbsp;them, and this in different degrees, according to their&nbsp;diſcernment, ſenfibility, &amp;c. experience (hows us that&nbsp;theſe latter </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">repeaters</span><span class="font2"> (as we call them) might conceive&nbsp;and uſe a manner of delivery which, though lefs </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">charafie-rijlic</span><span class="font2"> perhaps, would on the whole be no way inferior to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3">fiiſt, </span><span class="font2">as to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">common</span><span class="font2"> natural expreſſion proper for&nbsp;their fituation. It appears, therefore, that repeaters </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of&nbsp;every degree</span><span class="font2"> may be eſteemed upon a level as to anima-tion, and that our twofold diſtinction above contains&nbsp;accurately enough the whole variety of ordinary delivery ;—we ſay </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ordinary,</span><span class="font2"> becauſe</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There is another very peculiar kind of delivery ſometimes uſed in the perſon of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">repeater,</span><span class="font2"> of which it will in this place be neceſſary to take ſome notice, what&nbsp;we mean here is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mimicry;</span><span class="font2"> an accompliſſiment whieh,&nbsp;when perfectly and properly diſplayed, never fails of&nbsp;yielding a high degree of pleaſure. But fince this&nbsp;pleaſure chiefly ’reſults from the principle of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">imitation&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">reſpecting </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">manner,</span><span class="font2"> and not from the purport of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">matter</span><span class="font2"> communicated ; fince, comparatively ſpeaking, it&nbsp;is only attainable by few perſons, and practiſed only&nbsp;on particular occafions;—on theſe accounts it muſt fie&nbsp;refuſed a place among the modes of uſeful delivery&nbsp;taught us by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">general</span><span class="font2"> nature, and eſteemed a qualifica-tion purely anomalous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe diſtinctions with regard to a ſpeaker’s ſituation of mind premiſed, let .us fee to which of them an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">author</span><span class="font0"> and his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reader</span><span class="font0"> may moſt properly </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font0">referred,&nbsp;and how they are circumſtanced. with regaιd to one&nbsp;another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The matter of all books is, either what the author ſays in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">own</span><span class="font2"> perſon, or an acknowledged recital of&nbsp;the words of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">others :</span><span class="font2"> hence an author may be eſteemed&nbsp;both an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">original</span><span class="font2"> fpeaker and a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">repeater,</span><span class="font2"> according as&nbsp;what he writes is ©f the firſt or fecond kind. Now a&nbsp;reader muſt be ſuppofed either actually to perſonate the&nbsp;author, or one whoſe office is barely to communicate&nbsp;what he has ſaid to an auditor. But in the firſt of theſe&nbsp;ſuppoſitions he<sub>β</sub>would, in the delivery of what is the au-thor’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">own, evidently commence, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">mimic;</span><span class="font2"> which being, as</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
