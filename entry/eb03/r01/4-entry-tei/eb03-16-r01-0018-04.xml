                <p><label>READING</label> the art of delivering written language with propriety,
                    force, and elegance.</p>
                <p>" we muſt not judge ſo unfavourably of eloquence or good reading (ſays the
                    illuſtrious Fenelon), as to reckon it only a frivolous art, that a declaimer
                    uſes to impoſe upon the weak imagination of the multitude, and to ſerve his own
                    ends. It is a very ſerious art, defigned to inſtruct people ; to ſuppreſs their
                    paſſions and reform their manners ; to ſupport the laws, direct public councils,
                    and to make men good and happy.”</p>
                <p>Reaſon and experience demonſtrate, that <hi rend="italic">delivery in reading
                        ought to be leſs animated thaq in interefledſpeaking.</hi> In every
                    exerciſe of the faculty of ſpeech, and thoſe expreſſions of countenance and
                    geſture with which it is generally attended^ wε may be confidered to be always
                    in one of the two following fituations : Firſt, delivering our <hi rend="italic"
                        > boſom fentiτnents</hi> on circumſtances which relate to ourſelves or
                    others, or, ſecondly, <hi rend="italic">repeating</hi> ſomething that was
                    ſpoken on a certain occaſion for the amuſe-</p>
                <p>ment or information of an auditor. Now, if we obſerve the deliveries natural to
                    theſe two ſituations, we ſſiall find, that the firſt may be accompanied with
                    every degree of expreſſion which can manifeſt itſelf in us, from the loweſt of
                    ſympathy to the moſt violent and energe-tic of the ſuperior paſſions ; while the
                    latter, from the ſpeaker’s chief buiineſs being to repeat what he heard <hi
                        rend="italic"> with accuracy,</hi> diſcovers only a faint imitation of
                    thoſe ſigns of the emotions which we ſuppoſe agitated him from whom the words
                    were firſt borrowed.—The uſe and neceſſity of this difference of manner is
                    evident ; . and if we are attentive to theſe natural figns of ex-preſſion, we
                    ſliall find them conforming with the great-eſt nicety to the ſlighteſt and moſt
                    minute movements of the breaſt.</p>
                <p>This repetition of another’s words might be ſuppoſed. to paſs through the mouth
                    oſ a ſecond or third perſon ; and in theſe caſes, ſince they were not ear and
                    eye wit-neſſes of him who firſt ſpoke them, their manner oſ de-livery would want
                    the advantage neceſſarily arifing from an immediate idea of the original one ;
                    hence, on this account, this would be a ſtill lefs lively repreſentation than
                    that of the firft <hi rend="italic">repeater.</hi> But as, from a daily
                    obſervation of every variety of ſpeeeh and its aſſociated figns of emo-tion,
                    mankind foon become pretty well acquainted with them, and this in different
                    degrees, according to their diſcernment, ſenfibility, &amp;c. experience
                    (hows us that theſe latter <hi rend="italic">repeaters</hi> (as we call them)
                    might conceive and uſe a manner of delivery which, though lefs <hi rend="italic"
                        > charafie-rijlic</hi> perhaps, would on the whole be no way inferior to
                    the fiiſt, as to the <hi rend="italic">common</hi> natural expreſſion proper
                    for their fituation. It appears, therefore, that repeaters <hi rend="italic">of
                        every degree</hi> may be eſteemed upon a level as to anima-tion, and that
                    our twofold diſtinction above contains accurately enough the whole variety of
                    ordinary delivery ;—we ſay <hi rend="italic">ordinary,</hi> becauſe</p>
                <p>There is another very peculiar kind of delivery ſometimes uſed in the perſon of
                    a <hi rend="italic">repeater,</hi> of which it will in this place be neceſſary
                    to take ſome notice, what we mean here is <hi rend="italic">mimicry;</hi> an
                    accompliſſiment whieh, when perfectly and properly diſplayed, never fails of
                    yielding a high degree of pleaſure. But fince this pleaſure chiefly ’reſults
                    from the principle of <hi rend="italic">imitation</hi> reſpecting <hi
                        rend="italic"> manner,</hi> and not from the purport of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> matter</hi> communicated ; fince, comparatively ſpeaking, it
                    is only attainable by few perſons, and practiſed only on particular
                    occafions;—on theſe accounts it muſt fie refuſed a place among the modes of
                    uſeful delivery taught us by <hi rend="italic">general</hi> nature, and
                    eſteemed a qualifica-tion purely anomalous.</p>
                <p>Theſe diſtinctions with regard to a ſpeaker’s ſituation of mind premiſed, let
                    .us fee to which of them an <hi rend="italic">author</hi> and his <hi
                        rend="italic"> reader</hi> may moſt properly be referred, and how they are
                    circumſtanced. with regaιd to one another.</p>
                <p>The matter of all books is, either what the author ſays in his <hi rend="italic"
                        > own</hi> perſon, or an acknowledged recital of the words of <hi
                        rend="italic"> others :</hi> hence an author may be eſteemed both an <hi
                        rend="italic"> original</hi> fpeaker and a <hi rend="italic">repeater,</hi> according as what he writes is of the firſt or fecond kind. Now a reader
                    muſt be ſuppofed either actually to perſonate the author, or one whoſe office is
                    barely to communicate what he has ſaid to an auditor. But in the firſt of theſe
                    ſuppoſitions he <hi rend="sub">β</hi> would, in the delivery of what is the
                    au-thor’sown, evidently commence, <hi rend="italic">mimic;</hi> which being,
                    as</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0019" facs="gri_33125011196389_0025.tif"/>
                <p>above obſerved, a character not acknowledged by gene-ral nature in this
                    department, ought to be rejected as generally improper. The other ſuppoſition
                    therefore muſt. be accounted right ; and then, as to the <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> matter of the book, the reader is found to be exactly in the
                    ſituation of a <hi rend="italic">repeater,</hi> ſave that he takes what he ■
                    delivers from the page before him inſtead of his memory. It follows then, in
                    proof of our initial propoſition, that, if we are directed by nature and
                    propriety, the manner of our delivery in reading ought to be inferior in warmth
                    and energy to what we fhould uſe, were the language before us the fpontaneous
                    effuſions of our own hearts in the circumftances of thoſe out of whoſe mouths it
                    is ſuppoſed to proceed.</p>
                <p>Evident as the purport of this reaſoning is, it has not ſo much as been glanced
                    at by the writers on the ſubject we are now entered upon, or any of its kindred
                    ones ; which has occaſioned a manifeſt want oſ accuracy in ſeveral of their
                    rules and obſervations. Among the reſt, this precept has been long reverberated
                    from author to author as a perfect ſtandard for propriety in reading. " Deliver
                    yourfelves in the ſame manner you would do, were the matter your own original
                    ſentiments uttered directly ſrom the heart.” As all kinds of delivery muſt have
                    many things in common, the rule will in many articles be undoubtedly right ;
                    but, from what has been ſaid above, it muſt be as certainly faulty in reſpect to
                    ſeveral others ; as it is certain nature never confounds by like ſigns two
                    things ſo very different, as a <hi rend="italic">copy</hi> and an <hi
                        rend="italic"> original,</hi> an emanation darted immediately from the ſun,
                    and its weaker appearance in the lunar reflection.</p>
                <p>The precepts we have to offer for improving the above-mentioned rule, ihall be
                    delivered under the heads of <hi rend="italic">accent, eτnphafis, modulation,
                        exprefiιon, pauſes,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>'1. <hi rend="italic">Accent.</hi> In attending to the affections of the Voice
                    when we ſpeak, it is eaſy to obſerve, that, independent of any other
                    conſideration, one part of it differs from another, in <hi rend="italic">βrefs,
                        energy,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">force</hi> of utterance. In words we
                    ſind one ſyllable differing from another with reſpect to this mode ; and in
                    ſentences one or more words as frequently vary from the reſt in a ſimilar
                    manner. This ſtreſs with regard to <hi rend="italic">ſyllables</hi> is called <hi rend="italic">accent,</hi> and contributes greatly to the variety and
                    harmony of language. Reſpecting <hi rend="italic">words,</hi> it is termed <hi
                        rend="italic"> emphaſis ;</hi> and its chief office is to aſſiſt the ſenſe,
                    force, or perſpicuity of the ſentence—of which more under tbe iιext head.</p>
                <p>" Accent (as defcr⅛ed in the Lectures on Elocu-tion) is made by us two ways;
                    either by dwelling longer upon one ſyllable than tbe reſt, or by giving it a
                    Γmarter percuſſion of the voice in utterance. Df the firſt of thefe we have
                    inſtances in the words <hi rend="italic">glory, father, holy ;</hi> of the
                    laſt in <hi rend="italic">bat’tie, hadit, bor'row.</hi> So that accent with
                    ‘us is not referred to tune, but to time ; to quantity, not quality ; to the
                    more equable or precipitate motion of the voice, not to the variation of the
                    notes or inflexions.”</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="italic">theatric declamation,</hi> in order to give it more pomp
                    and ſolemnity, it is ufual to dwell longer than common upon the unaccented
                    ſyllables ; and the author now quoted has endeavoured to prove (p. 51. 54.) the
                    practice faulty, and to ſſiow (p. 55.) that " though it (i. e. true folemnity)
                    may demand a flower utterance</p>
                <p>than uſual, yet (it) requires that the ſame proportion in point of quantity be
                    obſerved in the ſyllables, as there is in mufical notes when the ſame tune is
                    played in quicker or flower time.” But that this deviation from ordinary ſpeech
                    is not a fault, as our author afferts ; nay, that on the contrary it is a real
                    beauty when kept under proper regulation, the following obſervations it 13 hoped
                    will ſuſſiciently prove.</p>
                <p>(I.) It is a truth of the moſt obvious nature, that thoſe things which on their
                    application to their proper ſenſes have a power of raffing in us certain ideas
                    and emotions, are ever <hi rend="italic">differently</hi> modified in their
                    conſtituent parts when different effects are produced in the mind : and alſo
                    (II.) that, within proper bounds, were we to ſuppoſe theſe conftituent parts to
                    be proportionally in-creaſed or diminiſſied as to <hi rend="italic">quantity,</hi> this effect would ſtill be the ſame as to <hi rend="italic">quality.—</hi> For inſtance : The different ideas of ſtrength, ſwiftneſs, &amp;c.
                    which are raiſed in us by the ſame ſpecies of animals, is owing to the different
                    form of their correſponding parts; the different effects of muſic on the
                    paſſions, to the different airs and movements of the melody ; and the different
                    expreſſions of human ſpeech, to a difference in tone, fpeed, &amp;c. of the
                    voice. And theſe peculiar effects would ſtill remain the ſame, were we to
                    ſuppofe the animals above alluded to, to be <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lefjer,</hi> within their proper bounds ; the movement
                    of the muſic <hi rend="italic">quicker</hi> or <hi rend="italic">flower,</hi> provided it did not palpably interfere with that of fome other ſpecies ;
                    and the pitch of the voice <hi rend="italic">higher</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lower,</hi> if not carried out of the limits in which it is obſerved on
                    fimilar occafions naturally to move. Farther (III.) fince, reſpecting the
                    emotions more efpecially, there are no rules to determine <hi rend="italic">à
                        priori</hi> what effect any particular attribute or modification of an
                    object will have upon a percipient, our knowledge of this kind mnſt evidently be
                    gained from experience. Laſtly, (IV.) In every art imitating nature we are
                    pleaſed to fee the characteriſtic members of the pattern <hi rend="italic">heightened</hi> a little farther than perhaps it ever was carried in any
                    real example, provided it be not bordering upon ſome ludicrous and diſagreeable
                    provinces of exceſs.</p>
                <p>Now for the application of theſe premiffes.—To keep pace and be conſiſtent with
                    the z⅛∙∏ι(y of the tragic muſe, the delivery of her language ſſiould neceffarily
                    be dignified ; and this it is plain from obſervation (I.) cannot be accompliſhed
                    otherwiſe than by ſomething diffe-rent in the manner oſ it from that of ordinary
                    fpeech ; fince <hi rend="italic">dignity</hi> is effentially different from <hi rend="italic">familiarity.</hi> But how muſt we diſcover this
                    different manner ? By attending to nature : and in this caſe ſſie tells us, that
                    befides ufing a <hi rend="italic">βower</hi> delivery, and greater <hi
                        rend="italic"> diβinfinejs</hi> of the words (which every thing merely <hi
                        rend="italic"> grave</hi> requires, and gravity is a <hi rend="italic">concomitant</hi> of dignity, though not its <hi rend="italic">effence),</hi> we muft dwell a little <hi rend="italic">longer</hi> upon the <hi
                        rend="italic"> unaccented</hi> ſyllables than we do in common. As to what
                    our author obſerves io the above quotation, of <hi rend="italic">dignity’s</hi> only requiring a <hi rend="italic">βower</hi> utterance than ordinary,
                    while the proportion of the ſyllables as to quantity continues the fame; it is
                    apprehended the remark (II.) reſpecting <hi rend="italic">quicknefs</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jlownefs</hi> of movement, will ſhow it to be not
                    altogether true. For ſince the delivery is not altered in <hi rend="italic">form,</hi> its expreſſion muft be ftill of the fame kind, and perhaps what
                    may be rightly ſuggeſted by the term <hi rend="italic">gravely familiar.</hi></p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0020" facs="gri_33125011196389_0026.tif"/>
                <p>But ſomething farther may be yet ſaid in defence of this <hi rend="italic">artificial</hi> delivery, as our author calls it. Is not the movement of
                    any thing, of whatever ſpecies, when dignified or ſolemn, in general of an <hi
                        rend="italic"> equable</hi> and <hi rend="italic">deliberate</hi> nature
                    (as in the minuet, the military ſtep, &amp;c.) ? And in theatrical
                    declamation, is not the propenſity to introduce this <hi rend="italic">equab!enefs</hi> ſo ſtrong, that it is almoſt <hi rend="italic">ιm-poflible</hi> to avoid it wholly, were we ever ſo determined to do it ?
                    If thele two queries be anſwered in the affirmative (as we are perſuaded they
                    will), while the ſirſt ſupports our argument for the <hi rend="italic">propriety</hi> of the manner of delivery in queſtion, the ſecond diſcovers
                    a kind of ne- <hi rend="italic">cefiity</hi> for it. And that this manner may
                    be carried a little <hi rend="italic">farther</hi> in quantity on the <hi
                        rend="italic"> fiage</hi> than is uſual in <hi rend="italic">real life,</hi> the principle (IV.) of heightening nature will juſtify, provided faſlrion
                    (which has ever fomething to do in theſe articles) give it a fonction ; for the <hi rend="italic">precife</hi> quantity of ſeveral heightenings may be
                    varied by this great legiſlator almoſt at will.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="italic">Emphafis.</hi> As <hi rend="italic">emphafis</hi> is
                    not a thing annexed to particular words, as <hi rend="italic">accent</hi> is
                    to ſyllables, but owes its riſe chiefly to the <hi rend="italic">meaning</hi> of a paffage, and muſt therefore vary its feat according as that meaning varies,
                    it will be neceffary to explain a little farther the general idea given of it
                    above. ♦</p>

                <p>Suppoſing, in reference to the above well-known lines, that originally other
                    beings, beſides men, had diſ-obeyed the commands of the Almighty, and that the

                <p>of <hi rend="italic">man's</hi> ſirſt diſobedience, and the fruit, &amp;e.</p>
                <p>But if it were a notorious truth, that mankind had tranſgreffed in a peculiar
                    manner more than once, the <hi rend="italic">emphafis</hi> would fall on <hi

                <p>Brought <hi rend="italic">death</hi> into the world, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>But if we were to ſuppoſe mankind knew there was ſuch an evil as death in other

                <p>Brought death into the <hi rend="italic">world,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Now from a proper delivery of the above lines, with regard to any one of the
                    ſuppoſitions we have choſen, out of ſeveral others that might in the ſame manner
                    havc been imagined, it will appear that the <hi rend="italic">emphafis</hi> they illuſtrate is effected by a manifeſt <hi rend="italic">delay</hi> in the
                    pronunciation, and a tone ſomething <hi rend="italic">fuller</hi> and <hi

                    is ſolely to determine the meaning of a ſentence with reference to ſomething

                    remove an, ambiguity where a paffage is capable of having more ſenſes given it

                <p>But, ſuppoſing in the above example, that none of the ſenſes there pointed out
                    were preciſely the true one, and that the meaning of the lines were no other
                    than what is obviouſiy ſuggeſted by their ſimple conſtruction; in that cafe it
                    may be aſked, if in reading them there ſſiould be no word dignified with the
                    emphatical accom-panyments above deſcribed ?—The anſwer is, Not one with an

                        or ſentence, places modulation ſolely in the diverfification of the key-note

                    Every perſon muſt have obſerved, that, in ſpeaking, the voice is ſnbject to an
                    alteration of found, which in ſome meafure reſembles the movement of a tune.
                    Theſe founds, however, are evidently nothing like ſo much varied as thoſe that
                    are ſtrictly mufical ; and we have attempted to ſliow in the preceding chapter,
                    that, befides this, they have an effential difference in themfelves.

                    feveral terms in common; and the particular we have now to examine is in both of
                    them called <hi rend="italic">modulation.</hi> This affection of the voice,
                    being totally <hi rend="italic">arbitrary,</hi> is differently characterized
                    in different parts of the world; and, through the power of cuſtom,,every place
                    is in-cliπed to think their own the only one natural and agreeable, and the reſt
                    affected with ſome barbarous twang or ungainly variation<note anchored="true"

                        <p>From what accounts we have remaining of the modulation of the ancients,
                            it appears to have been highly ornamented, and apparently ſomething not
                            unlike our modern <hi rend="italic">recitative ;</hi> particularly
                            that of their theatric declamation was muſic in its ſtricteſt ſenſe, and
                            accompanied with inſtruments. In the courſe of time and the progreſs of
                            refinement, this modulation became gradually more and more ſimple, till
                            it has now loſt the genius of muſic, and is entirely regulated by taſte.
                            At home here, every one has heard the <hi rend="italic">fing-fong</hi> cant, as it is called, of</p>
                        <p>Ti ti dum dum, ti ti dum ti dum de,</p>

                        <p>which, though difguſtful now to all but mere rqſtics on account of its
                            being out of ſaſhion, was very probably the favourite modulation in
                            which heroic verſes were recited by our anceſtors. So fluctuating are
                            the taſte and practices of mankind ! But whether the power of language
                            over the paſſions has received any advantage from the change juſt
                            mentioned, will appear at leaſt very doubtful, when w <hi rend="sup">,</hi> e recollect the ſtories of its former triumphs-, and the inherent
                            charms of muſical founds.</p>
                    </note>. It maybe obſerved, however, that though there is a general uniform caſt
                    or faſlrion of modulation peculiar to every country, yet it by no means follows,
                    that there is or can be any thing fixed in its application to particular
                    paffages ; and therefore we find different people will, in any given inſtance,
                    ufe modulations fomething different, and nevertheleſs be each of them equally
                    agreeable.</p>
                <p>But, quitting thefe general remarks, we ſhall (as our purpoſe requires it)
                    confider the properties of modula -tion a little more minutely.</p>
                <p>Firſt, then, we may obſerve, that, in ſpeaking, there is a particular found (or <hi rend="italic">key-note,</hi> as it is often called) in which the

                    conceived to have a reference, like that which common muſic has to its key-note.
                    Yet there is this difference between the two kinds of modulation, that whereas
                    the ſirſt always concludes in the key-note, the other frequently concludes a
                    tittle below it<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="6">As
                        muſical founds have always an harmonical reference to a key or fundamental

                        would appear perfect, that did not close in it, and ſo naturally put an end
                        to expectation. But as the tones uſed in ſpeech are not muſical, and
                        therefore cannot refer harmonically to any other found, there can be no

                    the key at the cloſe of a ſentence or period, are called <hi rend="italic">cadenies.</hi> Theſe cadences, if we are accurate in our diſtinctions,
                    will, with reſpect to their offices, be found of two kinds ; though they meet ſo
                    frequently together, that ſt may be beſt to conceive them only as anſwerihg a
                    double purpoſe. Οηε of theſe offices is to aſſiſt the fenſe, and the other to
                    decorate the modulation. An account of the firſt may be ſeen in the ſection on <hi rend="italic">Pauſes ;</hi> and the latter will be found "to ſhow
                    itſelf pretty frequently in every thing grave and plaintive, or in poetic
                    deſcription and other highly ornamented language, where the mind is by its
                    influ-ence brought to feel a placid kind of dignity and ſatisſaction. Thefe two
                    cadences, therefore, may be conveniently diſtinguiſhed by applying to them
                    reſpective-ly the epithets <hi rend="italic">fignficaηt</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic"> ornamental.</hi></p>
                <p>we have already obſerved, that reading ſhould in ſome things differ from
                    ſpeaking ; and the particular under conſideration ſeems to be one rvhich ought
                    to va-ry a little in theſe arts. For,</p>
                <p>Modulation in reading ſerves a'twofold purpoſe. At the ſame time that it gives
                    pleaſure to the ear on the principles of harmony, it contributes through that
                    medium to preferve the attention. And ſince written lan-guage (when not purely
                    dramatical) is in general more elegant in its conſtruction, and muſical in its
                    periods, than the oral one ; and ſince many intereſting particulars are wanting
                    in reading, which are preſent in ſpeak-ing, that contribute greatly to fix the
                    regard oſ the hearer ; it ſeems reaſonable, in order to do juſtice to the
                    language, and in part to ſupply the incitements oſ attention juſt alluded to,
                    that in the former of theſe two articles a modulation ſhould be uſed ſomething
                    more harmonious and artificial than in the latter. Agreeably to this reaſoniug,
                    it is believed, we ſhall find every reader, on a narrow examination, adopt more
                    or leſs a mo-dulation thus ornamented : though, aſter all, it muſt be
                    acknowledged there arc better grounds to believe, that the practice has been
                    hitherto directed intuitively by nature, than that it was diſcovered by the
                    inductions of reaſon. we ſhall conclude this head with a rule for mo-.dulation
                    in reading. “ In every thing dramatic, colloquial, or of ſimple narrative, let
                    your modulation be the ſame as in ſpeaking ; but when the ſubject is flowery,
                    ſolemn, or dignified, add ſomething to its harmony,</p>
                <p>diverſify the Jcey-note, and increaſc the frequency of cadences in proportion to
                    the merit of the compofi tion.”</p>
                <p>It will readily be ſeen, that the precepts here drawn from a compariſon between
                    ſpeaking and reading, would be very inadequate, were they left deſtitute ol the
                    aſſiſtance of <hi rend="italic">tafie,</hi> and the opportunity of <hi
                        rend="italic"> frequently hearing and imitating mafierly readers.</hi> And
                    indeed, to theſe two great auxiliaries we might very properly have referred the
                    whole matter at once, as capable of giving ſufficient directions, had we not
                    remembered that our plan required us to found ſeveral of our rules as much on
                    the principles of a philofophical analyſis, as on thoſe more familiar ones which
                    will be found of greater efficacy in real practice.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Expreſfion.</hi> i. There is no compoſition in muſic,
                    however perfect as to key and melody, but, in order to do juſtice to the fubject
                    and ideas of the author, will require, in the performing, ſomething more than an
                    exact adherence to <hi rend="italic">tune</hi> and <hi rend="italic">time.</hi> This ſomething is of a nature, too, which perhaps can never be ade-quately
                    pointed out by any thing graphic, and reſults entirely from the taſte and
                    feeling of the performer. It is that which chiefly gives muſic its power over
                    the paſſions, and characteriſes its notes with what we mean by the words <hi
                        rend="italic"> ſweet, harſh, dull, lively, plaintive, joyous,</hi> &amp;c. for it is evident every found, conſidered ab-ſtractedly, without any
                    regard to the movement, or high and low, may be thus modified. Tn practical
                    muſic, this commanding particular is called <hi rend="italic">Exprejfioη ;</hi> and as we ſind certain tones analogous to it frequently coa-leſcing with
                    the modulation of the voice, which indi-eate our paffions and affections
                    (thereby more particu-larly pointing out the meaning of what we ſay), the term
                    is uſually applied in the fame fenſe to ſpeaking and reading.</p>
                <p>Theſe tones are not altogether peculiar to man.— Every animal, that is not dumb,
                    has a power of making ſeveral of them. And from their being able, un-affiſted by
                    words, to manifeſt and raife their kindred emotions, they conſtitute a kind of
                    language of them-ſelves. In this language of the heart man is eminently
                    converſant ; for we not only underſtand it in one another, but alſo in many of
                    the inferior creatures ſubject-ed by providence to our fervice.</p>
                <p>The expreffion here illuſtrated is one of the moſt eſſential articles in good
                    reading, ſince it not only gives a ſiniſhing to the ſenſe, but, on the
                    principles of ſympa-thy and antipathy, has alſo a peculiar efficacy in
                    intereſting the heart. It is likewiſe an article of moſt difficult attainment ;
                    as it appears from what follows, that a maſterly reader ought not only to be
                    able to incorporate it with the modulation properly as to <hi rend="italic">quality,</hi> but in any degree as to <hi rend="italic">quantity.</hi></p>
                <p>Every thing written being a proper imitation of ſpeech, expreſſive reading muſt
                    occasionally partake of</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0023" facs="gri_33125011196389_0029.tif"/>
                <p>alI its tones. But from what was faid above, of the difference between reading
                    and ſpeaking, it follows, that theſe ſigns of the emotions ihould be leſs
                    ftrongly characteriſed in the former article than in the latter. Again, as
                    ſeveral of tlieſe tones of expreſſion are in themſelves agreeable to the mind,
                    and raiſe in us agree-able emotions (as thoſe of <hi rend="italic">pity,
                        benevolence,</hi> or whatever indicates <hi rend="italic">happineſs,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">goodnefs</hi> of heart), and others diſagreeable (as
                    thoſe of a <hi rend="italic">boiflerous, malevolent,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic"> depraved</hi> nature, &amp;c.) it farther appears, ſince
                    reading is an art <hi rend="italic">improving</hi> and not <hi rend="italic">imitating</hi> nature, that, in what-ever degree we abate the expreſſions
                    of the tones above alluded to in the ſirſt caſe, it would be eligible to make a
                    greater abatement in the latter. But as to the quantities and proportional
                    magnitudes of theſe abate-ments, they, like many other particulars of the ſame
                    nature, muſt be left ſolely to the taſte and judgment of the reader.</p>
                <p>To add one more remark, which may be of ſervice on more accounts than in
                    ſuggeſting another reaſon for the doctrine above. Let it be remembered, that
                    tho’ in order to acquit himſelf agreeably in this article of expreſſion, it will
                    be neceffary every reader ihould <hi rend="italic">feel</hi> his ſubject as
                    well as <hi rend="italic">underjland</hi> it ; yet, that he may preſerve a
                    proper eaſe and mafterlineſs of delivery, it is alſo neceffary he ſſiould guard
                    againft diſcovering too much emotion and perturbation.</p>
                <p>From this reaſoning we deduce the following rule, for the tones which indicate
                    the paſſions and emotions*</p>
                <p>" In reading, let all your tones of expreſſion be bor-rowed from thoſe of common
                    ſpeech, but ſomething more faintly characteriſed. Let thoſe tones which ſignify
                    any diſagreeable paſſion of the mind, be ſtill more faint than thoſe which
                    indicate their contrary ; and pre-ſerve yourſelf ſo far from being affected with
                    the fub-ject, as to be able to proceed through it with that peculiar kind of
                    eaſe and maſterlinefs, which has its charms in this as well as every other art.”</p>
                <p>we ſſiall conclude this ſection with the following ob-ſervation, which relates
                    to ſpeaking as well as reading, when words fall in our way, whoſe " founds ſeem
                    an echo to the ſenſe,” as <hi rend="italic">ſquirr, buzz, hum, rattle, hfs,jar,</hi> &amp;c. we ought not to pronounce them in ſuch a manner as to heighten
                    the imitation, except in light and ludicrous ſubjects. For inftance, they
                    ſſiould not in any other caſe be founded <hi rend="italic">ſquir.r.r—buzz.z.z—hum.m.m— r.r.rattle,</hi> &amp;c. Οη the contrary,
                    when the imitation lies in the <hi rend="italic">movement,</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic"> flow andflrufiure of a whole paſſage</hi> (which frequently
                    happens in poetry), the delivery may always be allowed to give a heightening to
                    it with the greateſt propriety ; as in the following inſtances, out of a number
                    more which every experienced reader will .quickly recollect.</p>
                <p>In theſe deep folitudes and awful cells,</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Grey’s Elegy.</hi></p>
                <p>2. Beſides the particular tones and modifications of voice above deſcribed,
                    which always accompany and expreſs our inward agitations, nature has in theſe
                    caſes endowed us with another language, which, inſtead of the ear, addreffes
                    itſelf to the eye, thereby giving the communications of the heart a double
                    advantage over thofe of the underſtanding, and <hi rend="italic">us</hi> a
                    double chance to preſerve fo ineſtirnable a bleſſing. This language is what
                    ariſes from the different, almoſt involuntary movements and configurations of
                    the face and body in our emotions and paſſions, and which, like that' of tones,
                    every one is formed to underſtand by a kind of intuition.</p>
                <p>when men are in any violent agitation of mind, this co-operating <hi
                        rend="italic"> expreſfion</hi> (as it is called) of face and <hi
                        rend="italic"> geſture</hi> is very ſtrongly marked, and totally free from
                    the mixture of any thing which has a regard to gracefulnefs, or what appearance
                    they may make in the eyes of others. But in ordinary converſation, and where the
                    emotions are not fo warm, faſſiionable people are perpe-tually infinuatſhg, into
                    their countenance and action, whatever they imagine will add to the eaſe and
                    elegance of their deportment, or impreſs on the ſpectator an idea of their
                    amiableneſs and breeding. Now, though the above-mentioned natural organical
                    figns of the emotions ſhould accompany every thing fpoken, yet from what was
                    obſerved in the introductory part of this article (like the tones we have
                    juſt-treated upon), they ſhould in reading he much leſs ſtrongly expreffed, and
                    thoſe fuffer the greateſt diminution that are in themfeives the moſt ungainly.
                    And as it was in the laſt ſection re-commended tβ the reader to preſerve himſelf
                    as far from being affected in all paſſionate ſubjects as to be able to keep a
                    temperate command over the various affections oſ the voice, &amp;c. fo under
                    the ſanction of this ſubor-dinate feeling he may accompany his delivery more
                    frequently with any eaſy action or change of face, which will contribute to ſet
                    off his manner, and make it agree-able on the principles of art.</p>
                <p>As theſe calm decorations oſ action (as we may call them) are not altogether
                    natural, but have their rife ſrom a kind of inttitution, they muſt be modelled
                    by the practices of the polite. And though mankind differ from one another
                    ſcarce more in any particular than in that of talents for adopting the graceful
                    actions of the body, and hence nothing determinate can be ſaid of their nature
                    and frequency, yet even thoſe, moſt happily calculated to acquit themfelves well
                    in their uſe, might profit by confidering that it is better greatly to abridge
                    the diſplay, than to over-do it ever fo little; For the peculiar modeſty of
                    deportment with which the inhabitants of this kingdom are endowed, makes us in
                    common endeavour to ſuppreſs many figns of an agitated mind ; and in ſuch caſes
                    the bodily ones in par-tic ular are very ſparingly uſed. we have alfo a natural
                    and rooted diſlike to any kind of affectation ; and to no</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0024" facs="gri_33125011196389_0030.tif"/>
                <p>ſpectes, that we can recollect, a greater, than to that which is ſeen in a
                    perfon who pretends to mimicry and courtly geſture, without poffeffing the
                    advantages and talents they require ; and of which not many people,
                    comparatively fpeaking, have any remarkable ſſiare.</p>
                <p>The inference of this is too obvious to need drawing out, aud we would
                    particularly recommend it to tlie conſideration of thofe readers who think the
                    common occurrences of a newſpaper, &amp;c. cannot be properly delivered
                    without a good deal of elbow-room</p>
                <p>Although it is impoſſible to come to particulars in any directions of this kind,
                    yet there is one article of our preſent ſnbject on which a ſerviceable remark
                    may be made. Iu ordinary difcourſe, when we are parti-cularly preſſing and
                    earneſt in what we ſay, the eye is naturally thrown upon thoſe to whom we
                    addreſs our-ſelves : And in reading, a turn of this organ now and then upon the
                    hearers, when any thing-very remark-able or intereſting falls in the way, has a
                    good effect in gaining it a proper attention, &amp;c. But this ſſiould not
                    be too frequently uſed ; for iffo, befides its having a tendency to confound the
                    natural importance of different paffages, it may not be altogether agreeable to
                    ſome to have their own reflections broken in upon by a ſignal, which might be
                    interpreted to hint at their wanting regulation.</p>
                <p>o∏e obſervation more, and then we ſſiall attempt to recapitulate the ſubſtance
                    of this ſection in the form of a precept. Though it is, when ſtrictly examined,
                    inconfiſtent, both in ſpeaking and reading, to imitate with action what we are
                    deſcribing, yet as in any thing <hi rend="italic">comic</hi> ſuch a practice
                    may ſuggeſt ideas that will <hi rend="italic">accord</hi> with thofe oſ the
                    ſubject, it may there be now and then indulged in either of theſe articles.</p>
                <p>“ In a manner ſimilar to that directed with regard to tones, moderate your
                    bodily expreſſions of the ſigns of the emotions. And in order to fupply, as it
                    were, this deficiency, introduce into your carriage ſuch an eaſy gracefulnefs,
                    as may be confiſtent with your acquirements in thefe particulars, and the
                    neceffary dread which ſſiould ever be preſent of falling into any kind of
                    affectation or grimace.”</p>

                    di-ſtinct words, muſt naturally be liable (both from a kind of accident, and a
                    difficulty there may be in be-g’fining certain founds or portions of phraſes
                    immediately on the ending of certain others) to feveral fmalΓ intermiſſions of
                    voice ; of which, as they can have no meaning, nothing farther need here be
                    ſaid. There are, however, ſome pauſes, which the ſenſe neceffarily de-mands ;
                    and to theſe the ſubſtance of this ſection is di-τected.</p>
                <p>The panics are in part to diſtinguiſſi the members of ſentences from one
                    another, the terminations of complete periods, and to afford an opportunity for
                    taking breath. Beſides this, they have a very graceful effect in the modulation,
                    on the fame account they are ſo effential in muſic.—In both articles, like blank
                    fpaces in pictures, they ſet off and render more conſpicuous what-foever they
                    disjoin or terminate.</p>
                <p>Were language made up of nothing but ſhort colloquial ſentences, theſe paufes,
                    though they might do no harm, and would generally be graceful, would however be
                    ſuperſeded as to uſe by the completeneſs and <hi rend="italic">nar-rownefs,</hi> as we may ſay, of the meaning. But in more diffuſe language, compofed of
                    ſeveral detached ſentences, and which require fome degree of attention in order
                    to take in the ſenfe, the intermiſſions of voice under conſideration are of the
                    greateſt ſervice, by ſig-nifying to the mind the progrefs and completion of the
                    whole paffage. Now, though in extenſive and differently formed periods there may
                    be members whoſe completeneſs of fenſe might be conceived of various degrees,
                    aud hence might ſeem to require a ſet of pauſes equally numerous ; yet, ſince
                    the ſenſe does not altogether depend upon theſe intermiſſions, and their ratios
                    to one another, if capable of being properly defined, could 'not be accurately
                    obſerved, grammarians have ventured to conceive the whole claſs of pauſes as
                    reducible to the four or five kinds now in ufe, and whoſe marks and ratios are

                        The blank line ( — or —), and the <hi rend="italic">breaks</hi> between <hi rend="italic">paragraphs,</hi> intimate ſtill greater times ; and
                        by the ſame analogy may be reckoned a double and quadruple period
                        refpectively. Now and then theſe blank lines are placed immediately <hi
                            rend="italic"> after</hi> the ordinary points, and then they are
                        conceived only as ſeparating ſor the ¢y? the different.natures of the matter
                        ;—as .a queſtion from an anſwer,—precept from example,—premiſes from
                        inferences, &amp;c. in which caſe their import is evident. Bπt of late
                        ſome authors have not fcrupled to confound theſe diſtinctions ; and to make
                        a blank ſerve for all the pauſes univerſally, or the mark of an indefinite
                        reſt, the quantity of which is left to the determination of the reader’s
                        taſte. A practice, it. is imagined, too deſtructive of the intended
                        preciſion of thefe typical notices to be much longer adopted. </note>;
                    presuming that under the eye of taſte ; and with the aſſiſt-ance of a particular
                    to be next mentioned, they would not fail in all cafes to ſuggeſt intermiſſions
                    of voice ſuitable to the ſenfe. But in many of theſe extenfive and complex
                    periods, rounded with a kind of redundancy of matter, where the full ſenſe is
                    long ſuſpended, and the final words are not very important, there would be fome
                    hazard of a miſapprehenfion of the termina-tion, had we not more evident and
                    infallible notice of it than that which is given by the paufe. This notice is
                    the <hi rend="italic">cadence,</hi> referred to in the ſection on <hi
                        rend="italic"> Modulation ;</hi> which, as is there obſerved, befides the
                    orna-mental variety it affords, appears from theſe remarks to be a very
                    neceffary and ſerviceable article in perſpi-cuous delivery.</p>
                <p>As this cadence naturally accompanies the end of every entire ſenfe,
                    circumftanced as above-mentioned, it may ſometimes fall hefo∙re the <hi
                        rend="italic"> ſemicolon,</hi> but morè generally before the <hi
                        rend="italic"> colon,</hi> as well as the period : For theſe marks are
                    often found to terminate a complete ſenſe ; and in theſe cafes, the relation
                    what follows has to what went before, is signified to the mind by the relative
                    shortness of the ſtop, and the form of introducing the additional matter. Nor
                    can any bad conſe-</p>

                <p>quence ariſe from thus founding diſtinctions on ratios of time, which it may be
                    ſaid are too nice to be often rightly hit upon : for if a confuſion ſhould
                    happen between that of the <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> and <hi rend="italic">period,</hi> there is perhaps fo trifling a difference between the nature
                    of the paffages they ſucceed, as to make a ſmall inaccuracy of no con-ſequence.
                    And as to the reſts of the ſemicolon and period, it will not be eaſy to miſtake
                    about them, as their, ratio is that of two to one. Add to this the power which
                    the matter and introduction of-the ſub-ſequent paffages have to rectify any
                    flight errδr here made, and we ſhall be fully ſatisſied, that the pauſes as
                    uſually explained, with the cadence above defcribed, and a proper knowledge of
                    the language, will convey fufficient information to the underſtanding of the
                    con-ſtructive nature of the paffages after which they are found.</p>
                <p>It may be obſerved, that in natural fpeech, accord-ing to the warmth and
                    agitation of the ſpeaker, the reſts are often ſhort and injudiciouſly
                    proportioned, and hence that eveιy thing thus delivered cannot be ſo grace-ful
                    as it might have been from a proper attention to their magnitude and effects.</p>
                <p>Pauſes then, though chiefly ſubjected to the ſenſe, are, as was remarked at the
                    outſet, ſerviceable in beautifying the modulation, &amp;c.—And ſince books
                    are often inaccurately printed as to points, and peo-ple’s taſtes differ fome
                    little about their place and va-Iue, it appears, that, " although in reading
                    great attention ſhould be paid to the ſtops, yet a greater ihould be given to
                    the ſenſe, and their coreſpondent times occafionally lengthened beyond what is
                    uſual in common ſpeech which obſervation contains all that we ſhall pretend to
                    lay down by way of rule for the management of pauſes in the delivery of written
                    language.</p>
                <p>As there are two or three ſpecies of writing, which have ſomething ſingular in
                    them, and with regard to the manner in which they ſhould be read, a few <hi
                        rend="italic"> particular</hi> remarks ſeem neceffarily required, we ſhall
                    con-clude this article with laying them before the reader :</p>
                <p>1. of <hi rend="smallcaps">Plays,</hi> and ſuch like <hi rend="smallcaps">conversation-pièces.</hi> Writings of this kind maybe conſidered as
                    intended for two different purpoſes ; one to unfold ſubject matter for the
                    exercife of theatric powers ; and the other to convey amuſement, merely as fable
                    replete with pleaſing incidents and characteriſtic maimers. Hence there appears
                    to be great latitude for the diſplay of a <hi rend="italic">conſflent</hi> delivery of theſe performances : for while, on one hand, a good reader of very
                    inferior talents for mimicry may be heard with a tolerable degree of pleaſure ;
                    on the other, if any perſon is qualified to give a higher degree of life and
                    force to the dialogue and characters by delivering them as an actor, he muſt be
                    fully at liberty to ſtart from the confinement of a chair to a poſture and area
                    more ſuit-ed to his abilities ; and, if he be not deceived in himſelf,</p>
                <p>his hearers will be conſiderable gainers by the change._</p>
                <p>The next article is,</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Sermons</hi> or other <hi rend="smallcaps">orations,</hi> which in like man-tier may be conceived intended for a double purpoſe.
                    Firſt, as matter for the diſplay of oratorical powers ; aιwl, ſecondly, as
                    perſuaſive diſcourſes, &amp;c. which may be read like any other book.
                    Therefore it appears (for reaſons ſimilar to thoſe above) that according as
                    clergymen are poffeffed of the talents of elocution, they may conſiſtently
                    either rehearſe their fermons, in the manner of an extemporary harangue, or
                    deliver them in the more humble capacity of one -who is content to entertain and
                    inſtruct his hearers with reading to them his own or ſome other perſon’s written
                    diſcourſe.</p>
                <p>Ί hat either of theſe manners of delivery (or a mixture of them), in either of
                    the cafes above-mentioned, is agreeable, we find on a careful exa. ſination. For
                    this will ſhow us how frequently they run into one another; and that we are ſo
                    far from thinking ſuch tranſitions wrong, that, without a particular attention
                    that way, we fcarce ever perceive them at all.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Poetry</hi> is the next and laſt object of our prefent
                    remarks. This is a very peculiar kind of writing, and as much different from the
                    language of ordinary difcourſe as the movements of the dance are from common w.. <hi rend="sub">i</hi> k-ing. 1 o ornament and improve whatever is
                    ſubfervient to the pleaſures and amufements of life, is the delight of human
                    nature, we are alfo pleaſed with a kind o£ <hi rend="italic">excefi.</hi> in
                    any thing which has a power to amuſe the fart-cy, inſpire us with enthuſiaſm, or
                    awaken the ſoul to 3 conſciouſneſs of its own importance and dignity. Hence one
                    pleaſure, at leaft, takes its riſe, that we feel in con-templating the
                    performances of every art ; and hence the language", of poetry, conſiſting of a
                    meaſured ryth-mus, harmonious cadences, and an elevated pictureſqn¢ diction, has
                    been ſtudied by the ingenious, and found to have a powerful influence over the
                    human breaſt in every age and region. There is ſuch an affinity between this
                    language and muſic, that they were in the earlier ages never ſeparated; and
                    though modern refinement has in a great meaſure deſtroyed this union, yet it is
                    with fome degree of difficulty in rehearfing thefe divine compofitions we can
                    forget tlie finging of the muſe.</p>
                <p>From theſe confiderations (and ſome kindred ones mentioned in ſect. iii.) in
                    repeating verſes, they are ge-nerally accompanied with a modulation rather more
                    or-namented and mufical than is uſed in any other kind of writing. And
                    accordingly, as there ſeems to bc the greateſt propriety in the practice, the
                    rule for this par-ticular in the ſection juſt referred to, will allow any
                    lati∙&gt; tude in it that can gain the ſanction of taſte and pleaſure.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rhymes</hi> in the lighter and more ſoothing provinces of
                    poetry are found to have a good effect ; and hence (for reaſons like thoſe juſt
                    ſuggeſted) it is certainly abſurd to endeavour to {mother them by a feeble pro*
                    nuπciation, and running one line precipitately into another, as is often
                    affected to be done by many of our modern readers and ſpeakers. By this method
                    they not on» ly deftroy one ſource of pleaſure intended by the com-poſer (which
                    though not great is nevertheleſs genuine), but even often ſupply its place with
                    what is really diſa-greeable, by making the rhymes, as they are interruptedly
                    perceived, appear accidental blemiſhes of a different ſtyle, arifing from an
                    unmeaning recurrence of fimilar founds, with regard then to reading verſes
                    terminated with rhyme, the common rule, which directs to prδ-nounce the final
                    words <hi rend="italic">full,</hi> and to diſtinguiſh them by a flight pauſe
                    even where there is none required by the fen le, ſeems the moſt rational, and
