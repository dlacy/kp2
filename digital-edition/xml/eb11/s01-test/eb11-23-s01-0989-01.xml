an urban district in the Colne Valley parliamentary division of the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, 14 m. N.E. of Manchester, on the London &amp;amp; North Western railway. Pop. (1901) 12,320. It lies on the western side of the elevation of Stanedge, which here forms the watershed between streams flowing westward to the Irish Sea and eastward to the North Sea. Early earthworks and tumuli are numerous in the locality. The Huddersfield canal follows the valley, and, like the railway, is carried under Stanedge by a long tunnel.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
