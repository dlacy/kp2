<p><span class="font0">RICHERUS, a chronicler of the 10th century, son of Rodulf, a trusty councillor and captain of Louis IV.,&nbsp;studied at Rheims under Gerbert, afterwards Pope&nbsp;Silvester II. His intimacy with this famous man gave&nbsp;him many opportunities of knowing the history of his&nbsp;time, and when Gerbert became archbishop of Rheims he&nbsp;charged Richerus with the task of writing a history of the&nbsp;Gauls. This history in four books begins with Charles&nbsp;the Fat and Eudes, and goes down to the year 995. From&nbsp;969 onwards Richerus had no earlier history before him,&nbsp;and his work is the chief source for the period when the&nbsp;Capets superseded the Carlovingians. It was first edited&nbsp;in Pertz’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Monumenta Germaniæ,</span><span class="font0"> vol. iii., and there have&nbsp;since been several separate editions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHMOND, a town of Surrey, is situated on the south bank of the Thames, here crossed by a stone bridge of five&nbsp;arches, 8∣ miles west of Hyde Park Corner by road, and&nbsp;9f from the Waterloo station of the South-Western Railway. The town, anciently called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Syeηes</span><span class="font0"> and afterwards&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Schene</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sheen,</span><span class="font0"> until the name was in 1500 changed&nbsp;to Richmond by command of Henry VII., grew up round&nbsp;the royal manor house, which became a frequent residence&nbsp;of different sovereigns, but of which nothing more than&nbsp;a gateway now remains. Edward I. received the Scotch&nbsp;commissioners at his manor of Sheen in 1300. The&nbsp;palace was rebuilt by Edward III., who died there in 1377.&nbsp;It was frequently resided in by Richard IL, and here his&nbsp;wife Anne of Bohemia died, upon which he cursed the&nbsp;place and “caused it to be thrown down and defaced.”&nbsp;By Henry V. it was, however, rebuilt, and a great tournament was held at it in 1492 by Henry VII., who after its&nbsp;destruction by fire in 1499 restored it and named it Richmond. Henry VIII. gave it to Wolsey to reside in, after&nbsp;the latter presented him with the new palace of Hampton&nbsp;Court. James I. settled it on his son Henry, prince of&nbsp;Wales, who restored and embellished it at great expense.&nbsp;Charles I. added to it the new deer park generally known&nbsp;as Richmond Park, 2253 acres in extent, which is surrounded by a wall 11 miles in length. After the execution of the king, .the parliament presented the park to the&nbsp;citizens of London, who again presented it to Charles II.&nbsp;at the Restoration. Though partly dismantled, the palace&nbsp;was the residence of the queen dowager till 1665, and by&nbsp;J âmes II. it was used as a nursery for the young prince ;&nbsp;but, gradually falling into decay, it was, about 1720,&nbsp;parcelled into tenements. In the old deer park extending&nbsp;northwards from the site of the palace towards Kew an&nbsp;observatory was erected in 1769, occupying the site of a&nbsp;Carthusian convent founded by Henry V., and a dwelling&nbsp;house in which Swift for some time resided. To the&nbsp;south-east of the town, at the entrance to Richmond Park,&nbsp;is Richmond Hill, from which is the famous view of the&nbsp;Thames with the surrounding country to the west. The&nbsp;White Lodge in Richmond Park is usually the residence&nbsp;of some member of the royal family. The town itself is&nbsp;without special interest, and consists chiefiy of one long&nbsp;and irregular street running north and south. The church&nbsp;of St Mary Magdalen is of considerable antiquity, but has&nbsp;been almost entirely rebuilt ; it contains a large number&nbsp;of monuments to celebrated persons. The theatre, first&nbsp;established in 1719, was during his later years leased by&nbsp;Edmund Kean. The town has a Wesleyan theological&nbsp;college founded in 1834, a free public library, and public&nbsp;baths. The population of the urban sanitary district (area&nbsp;1210 acres) in 1871 was 15,113, and in 1881 it was&nbsp;19,066.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHMOND, a borough in the North Riding of Yorkshire, is finely situated on the Swale, at the terminus&nbsp;of the Richmond branch of the North-Eastern Railway, 44&nbsp;miles north-west of York and 15 south-west of Darlington.&nbsp;The interest of the town centres in the castle, said to have&nbsp;been founded by Alan Rufus, son of Hoel, count of&nbsp;Bretagne, who is also said to have rebuilt the town on his&nbsp;obtaining the estates of the Saxon Earl Edwin, embracing&nbsp;two hundred manors of Richmond and extending over&nbsp;nearly a third of the North Riding. When Henry VII.&nbsp;came to the throne these possessions reverted to the crown.&nbsp;Henry VIII. gave it to his son Henry by a daughter of Sir&nbsp;John Blount, and Charles II. bestowed the title of duke of&nbsp;Richmond on his son by the duchess of Portsmouth. The&nbsp;castle is situated on a perpendicular rock rising about 100&nbsp;feet above the Swale, and from its great strength was considered inaccessible. Originally it covered an area of 5 acres,&nbsp;but the only portions of it now remaining are the Norman&nbsp;keep, with pinnacled tower and walls 100 feet high by 11&nbsp;feet thick, and some other smaller towers. A portion of&nbsp;it is now occupied by the North York Rifles militia. The&nbsp;old church of St Mary, chiefly in the Gothic style, though&nbsp;with some traces of Norman, has been restored under the&nbsp;direction of Sir Gilbert Scott. For the free grammar&nbsp;school founded by Elizabeth a Gothic building was erected&nbsp;in 1850, in memory of the Rev. James Tate, a former&nbsp;master. The tower of the Franciscan abbey founded in&nbsp;1258 still remains. The chief modern buildings are the&nbsp;town-hall, the masonic hall, and the workmen’s hall. The&nbsp;principal trade is in agricultural produce, but there are a&nbsp;paper mill and an iron and brass foundry. The town&nbsp;received its first charter from Elizabeth. Under the&nbsp;Municipal Corporations Act it is governed by a mayor,&nbsp;four aldermen, and tw<sup>r</sup>elve councillors. Up to 1885, when&nbsp;it ceased to be separately represented, Richmond was a&nbsp;parliamentary borough, returning two members till 1868,&nbsp;and one after that date. The population of the municipal&nbsp;borough (area 2520 acres) in 1871 was 4443, and in 1881&nbsp;it was 4502.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHMOND, a city of the United States, the county seat of Wayne county, Indiana, is situated in a fine&nbsp;agricultural region on the east branch of the White&nbsp;Water River (a sub-tributary of the Ohio), 68 miles east&nbsp;of Indianapolis. It is an important railway junction, has&nbsp;a city park 135 acres in extent, manufactures machinery,&nbsp;agricultural implements, &amp;c., and contains a public library&nbsp;(15,000 volumes), a museum, two theatres, and two educational institutions (Earlham College, 1859) belonging to&nbsp;the Society of Friends, which is strongly represented in&nbsp;the city. The population was 9445 in 1870, and 12,742&nbsp;in 1880. The city obtained its charter in 1845.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHMOND, a city of the United States, the capital of Virginia, is situated in Henrico county, on the north&nbsp;side of the James River, at the point where the lower falls&nbsp;(100 feet in 6 miles) mark the limit of the tide ascending&nbsp;from Chesapeake Bay. On the other side of the river,&nbsp;and in the county of Chesterfield, but connected with&nbsp;Richmond by bridges, is Manchester. By rail the city is&nbsp;116 miles south-south-west of Washington. At mean&nbsp;high tides vessels drawing 14 feet of water can come up&nbsp;to Rocketts, as the lower district is called. The town&nbsp;proper occupies a group of hills—Gamble’s Hill, Shockoe&nbsp;Hill, Church Hill, &amp;c.—and looks down over the river,&nbsp;from which it is separated by a strip of flat ground.&nbsp;Main Street is a typical street after the old Southern style,&nbsp;the large portion burned in 1865 having been rebuilt in&nbsp;keeping with the remnant that escaped. By far the most&nbsp;conspicuous edifice in the city is the Capitol, on the&nbsp;summit of Shockoe Hill, designed by Thomas Jefferson,&nbsp;after the Maison Carrée of Nîmes.
