<p><span class="font0">Coronellidæ are numerous; so are Colubers, of which Pituopbis is the most characteristic. Freshwater Snakes abound, especially of&nbsp;the genus Tropidonotus. Of Tortricidæ three genera have been&nbsp;distinguished. No true Vipers occur, but Pit Vipers are represented&nbsp;by three genera, of which two are Rattlesnakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After what has been stated already, the affinities of this to other regions can be summed up in a few words. The&nbsp;Reptilian fauna of North and South America forms, with&nbsp;the exception of the Chelonians, a homogeneous whole by&nbsp;which the Neogean division proposed by Sclater for&nbsp;Passerine Birds is well characterized. On the other hand,&nbsp;the Chelonian fauna of North America is entirely distinct&nbsp;from that of South America, and most closely allied to&nbsp;that of India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">6. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Europa-Asiatic Region.—</span><span class="font1">Whilst the north of the western hemisphere has at least one order of Reptiles, the&nbsp;Chelonians, by which it is distinguished from the south,&nbsp;the temperate region of the eastern hemisphere possesses&nbsp;no important distinguishing type of Reptile. Its Reptilian&nbsp;fauna is merely an offshoot of those of the two adjoining&nbsp;tropical regions ; and, if we were to add the genera most&nbsp;characteristic of the Palæarctic fauna to either Africa or&nbsp;India, the character of neither would be modified or&nbsp;changed. Thus, so far as Reptiles are concerned, a Palæarctic region does not deserve to rank with the other&nbsp;primary regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Chelonians are represented by nine species only, viz. :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Testudo, ....................................................4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;species</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Emys, .......................................................3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Trionyx, ....................................................2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">—types which are only specifically distinct from those &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the two</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">southern tropical regions. The Land Tortoises are confined to the warmer districts of the western portion, penetrating into the centre&nbsp;of the Siberian sub-region, and entirely absent in the northern and&nbsp;eastern parts ; of Emys one species CE. lutaria) is still found in&nbsp;north-eastern Germany as far north as 54° N. lat.@@<sup>1</sup> ; and probably&nbsp;some other species will be found in similar latitudes in the little&nbsp;explored Amur country, where also a species of Trionyx ( T. maaekii)&nbsp;occurs. The second species of this latter genus which is referable&nbsp;to this region inhabits the Euphrates and Tigris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The recent discovery of an Alligator in central China is a highly interesting fact, but not surprising, when we remember the occurrence in China of not a few North-American types of Batrachians&nbsp;and Freshwater Fishes. The common African Crocodile still lingers&nbsp;in the Mediterranean district,—its presence in Syria having been&nbsp;placed beyond doubt, and its occurrence in Sicily having been&nbsp;asserted on very good authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Lacertilians include the only family type which this region has not derived from either Africa or India, viz., the Anguidæ. Two&nbsp;genera of this family, Anguis and Pseudopus,@@<sup>2</sup> are widely spread in&nbsp;Europe, and closely allied, the former to the South-American&nbsp;Ophiodes, and the latter to the North-American Ophiosaurus.&nbsp;Laeertidæ are abundant as in Africa, and Amphisbænidæ and&nbsp;Chamæleontidæ represented at least in the Mediterranean district.&nbsp;Towards the central parts of Asia the terrestrial Agamidæ are continued from north-western Africa, partly with but slight modifications, Phrynoeefihalus being a specifically Central-Asiatic genus. In&nbsp;the Manchurian sub-region these African types are replaced by some&nbsp;Indian forms, such as Gecko and Taehydromus. The northern range&nbsp;of Lizards in this region extends as far as Lapland (Lacerta υivipara&nbsp;and Anguis fragilis).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The most characteristic Ophidian genus of the region is Zamenis, a Colubrine form which is very widely spread, and includes more&nbsp;species (eleven) than any other Palæarctic genus. This genus&nbsp;extends over Arabia, and even into the island of Socotra, without&nbsp;being associated there so far as is known at present with Snakes of&nbsp;an either peculiarly African or Indian type. The total number of&nbsp;Palæarctic Snakes amounts to sixty, of which twelve are poisonous&nbsp;Snakes, viz., nine Vipérines and three Halys. The majority&nbsp;inhabit the Mediterranean district and western Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Four Typhlops and a single Stxnοstoma have been found in the Mediterranean district and Persia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the small number of Calamariidæ and Coronellidæ. Rhyncho∙</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">calamus, Psilοsomα, Lytorlιyηchus, and Ditypophis (Socotra) are genera not found beyond this region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Colubridæ are comparatively numerous, and show less affinity to African than Indian forms. Besides Zamenis, Coluber and&nbsp;Elaphis occur in four species each, and Rhineehis and Acontiophis&nbsp;(Afghanistan) are peculiar genera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Three or four species of Tropidcrnotus represent the groups of Freshwater Snakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Psammophidæ are well developed ; besides two species of Psammophis, Taρhrometopοη and Cœlopeltis are peculiar genera,&nbsp;but not extending into eastern Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is one species of Eryx.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One species of Naja reaches the Caspian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The three species of Halys are Central-Asiatic.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the nine species of Vipérines six belong to Vipera and Cerastes. Dαboia and Εchis may be considered to have their headquarters in this region, but they extend into southern India, and&nbsp;Eehis has spread east and west along the barren plains or deserts of&nbsp;North Africa and north-western India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">7. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hew Zealand.—</span><span class="font1">The southernmost parts of South America, Africa, and Australia are not inhabited by a&nbsp;sufficiently differentiated fauna to be separated from the&nbsp;tropical regions of which they are the continuation. None&nbsp;of the small oceanic islands south of 40° or Tierra del&nbsp;Fuego possess any Reptiles. On the other hand New&nbsp;Zealand is by the possession of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria,</span><span class="font1"> the sole living&nbsp;remnant of the extinct order </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhynehoeephalia</span><span class="font1"> (not to&nbsp;mention other scarcely less important parts of its fauna),&nbsp;so much distinguished from the other regions that it cannot be associated with any of them. Although the climate&nbsp;and other physical conditions seem to be well adapted for&nbsp;the existence of the Chelonian and Ophidian types, neither&nbsp;is represented ; and of Lizards only representatives of the&nbsp;ubiquitous Skinks and Geckos have reached its shores ; but&nbsp;some of the latter must have inhabited New Zealand for a&nbsp;long period, as they belong to a distinct genus, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Naultinus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which is peculiar to this group of islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the conclusion of this section it will be useful first to recapitulate the principal features of the Reptilian&nbsp;faunæ for each of the primary regions into which the&nbsp;land of the globe has been divided by zoologists, and which&nbsp;nearly coincide with the geographical divisions, and secondly&nbsp;to arrange the regions according to the natural relations as&nbsp;expressed by this class of animals. A division into zones&nbsp;comprising the corresponding parts of both hemispheres&nbsp;cannot be maintained for Reptiles, since the greater portion&nbsp;of the faunæ of the temperate are merely the offshoots of&nbsp;tropical faunæ, no peculiar types of a higher than generic&nbsp;rank being developed in them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Indian Region is characterized by Trionyeidæ and&nbsp;Emydidæ, but few Testudinulæ. Croeodilidæ, with Gavials. Lacertilians and Ophidians very numerous. Agamidæ chiefly arboreal&nbsp;(Draco), and Varanidæ. Pythonidæ and Lyeodontidæ. Ground&nbsp;Snakes, Colubers, Tree Snakes, and Freshwater Snakes abundant&nbsp;in genera. Tropidonotus. Poisonous Snakes in the proportion of&nbsp;species as 1 : 10, and comprising Crotalidæ and Elapidæ, but only&nbsp;two Viperidæ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The African Region (exclusive of Madagascar) is characterized&nbsp;by Land Tortoises, Trionyeidæ, and Chelydidæ. Species of Croeodi∙&nbsp;lus only. Lacertilians and Ophidians rather numerous. Agamûdæ&nbsp;chiefly terrestrial ; Laeertidæ and Varanidæ are well represented.&nbsp;Amphisbænidæ, Gerrhosauridæ, and ZonuriAæ are peculiar to the&nbsp;region. Chamæleontidæ. Pythonidæ and Lyeodontidæ. True&nbsp;Colubers and Tropidonotus almost absent. Psammophidæ. Poisonous Snakes in the proportion of 1 : 5, comprising Viperidæ and&nbsp;numerous venomous Colubrines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Evroγo-Asiatic Region is composed of a mixture of&nbsp;Indian and African generic and family types; and only a few&nbsp;peculiar genera have their centre of distribution in this part, such as&nbsp;Anguis, Pseudopus, Ρhryηoccphalus, Uromastyx, Stxnοdaetyhιs, Also-phylax, Cerαmodaxtylus, Scineus, Zamenis, Cœlopeltis, Taphrοnιeto-pon, Daboia, Eehis, Halys. The majority inhabit the sub-tropical&nbsp;and warmer parts abutting upon the neighbouring tropical regions,&nbsp;and are rapidly reduced in number in the more temperate portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Tropical Pacific Region possesses one of the terrestrial&nbsp;Chelonian types, Chelydidæ, and species of Crοeοdilus only.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emys lutaria is one of the Tortoises the range of which has&nbsp;become much restricted in post-Glacial times, its remains having been&nbsp;found in peat beds in Norfolk, Belgium, Denmark, and Sweden, where&nbsp;it is now completely extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The isolated occurrence of a species of Pseudopus in Khassia has&nbsp;been mentioned above.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
