<p><span class="font1">been able to eradicate this plant of native growth from the heart of man. The sentiment is congenial to his nature,&nbsp;and therefore it is universal; and we could almost appeal&nbsp;to the feelings of every reader, whether he does not perceive it in his own breast. Perhaps we may be mistaken&nbsp;in our opinion in the case of the corrupted inhabitants of&nbsp;the populous and busy cities, who are habituated to the&nbsp;fond contemplation of their own individual exertions as the&nbsp;sources of all their hopes. Give the shoemaker but leather&nbsp;and a few tools, and he defies the powers of nature to disappoint him; but the simpler inhabitants of the country,&nbsp;the most worthy and the most respectable part of every nation, after equal, perhaps greater exertion, both of skill and&nbsp;of industry, are more accustomed to resign themselves to&nbsp;the great ministers of Providence, and to look up to heaven&nbsp;for the “ early and the latter rains, ” without which all their&nbsp;labours are fruitless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">--Extrema per illos</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Numenque excedens terris vestigia fecit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And among the husbandmen and the shepherds of all nations and ages, we find the same fond attachment to their springs and rivulets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fortunate senex, hie, inter flumina nota Et fontes sacros, frigus captabis opacum,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">was the mournful ejaculation of poor Melib</span><span class="font0">œ</span><span class="font1">us. We hardly know a river of any note in our own country whose source&nbsp;is not looked on with some respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We repeat our assertion, that this worship was the offspring of affection and gratitude, and that it is giving a very unfair and false picture of the human mind to ascribe these&nbsp;superstitions to the working of fear alone. These would&nbsp;have represented the river-gods as seated on ruins, brandishing rooted-up trees, with angry looks, pouring out their&nbsp;sweeping torrents. But no such thing. The lively imagination of the Greeks felt, and expressed with an energy unknown to all other nations, every emotion of the human&nbsp;soul. They figured the Naiads as beautiful nymphs, patterns of gentleness and of elegance. These they represented as partially attached to the children of men; and their&nbsp;interference in human affairs is always in acts of kind assistance and protection. They resemble, in this respect;&nbsp;the rural deities of the northern nations, the fairies, but&nbsp;without their caprices and resentments. And if we attend&nbsp;to the descriptions and representations of their river-gods,&nbsp;beings armed with power, an attribute which slavish fear&nbsp;never fails to couple with cruelty and vengeance, we shall&nbsp;find the same expression of affectionate trust and confidence&nbsp;in their kind dispositions. They are generally called by&nbsp;the respectable but endearing name of</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> father.</span><span class="font1"> “ Da Tyberi&nbsp;pater. ” says Virgil. Mr Bruce says that the Nile at its&nbsp;source is called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">abay,</span><span class="font1"> or “ father. ” We observe this&nbsp;word, or its radix, blended with many names of rivers of the&nbsp;east; and think it probable that when our traveller got this&nbsp;name from the inhabitants of the neighbourhood, they applied to the stream what is meant to express the tutelar or&nbsp;presiding spirit. The river-gods are always represented as&nbsp;venerable old men, to indicate their being coeval with the&nbsp;world. But it is always a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cruda viridisque senectus,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;they are never represented as oppressed with age and decrepitude. Their beards are long and flowing, their looks&nbsp;placid, their attitude easy, reclined on a bank, covered, as&nbsp;they are crowned, with never-fading sedges and bulrushes,&nbsp;and leaning on their urns, from which they pour out their&nbsp;plentiful and fertilizing streams. Mr Bruce’s description of&nbsp;the sources of the Nile, and of the respect paid to the sacred&nbsp;waters, has not a frowning feature; and the hospitable old&nbsp;man, with his fair daughter Irepone, and the gentle priesthood which peopled the little village of Geesh, form a contrast with </span><span class="font2">the </span><span class="font1">neighbouring Galla (among whom a mili-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">tary leader was called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lamb,</span><span class="font1"> because he did not murder pregnant women), which very clearly paints the inspiring principle of this superstition. Pliny says (lib. viii. 81 that at the source of the Clitumnus there is an ancient&nbsp;temple highly respected. The presence and the power of&nbsp;the divinity are expressed by the fates which stand in the&nbsp;vestibule. Around this temple are several little chapels,&nbsp;each of which covers a sacred fountain; for the Clitumnus&nbsp;is the father of several little rivers which unite their streams&nbsp;with him. At some distance below the temple is a bridge&nbsp;which divides the sacred waters from those which are open&nbsp;to common use. No one must presume to set his foot in&nbsp;the streams above this bridge; and to step over any of them&nbsp;is an indignity which renders a person infamous. They can&nbsp;only be visited in a consecrated boat. Below the bridge&nbsp;we are permitted to bathe, and the place is incessantly occupied by the neighbouring villagers. See also Vibius Sequester Oberlini, p. 101-103, and 221-223; also Sueton.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caligula,</span><span class="font1"> c. 43; Virg. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Georg.</span><span class="font1"> ii. 146.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">What is the cause of all this? The Clitumnus, near its source, flows through the richest pastures, through which it&nbsp;was carefully distributed by numberless drains; and these&nbsp;nourished cattle of such spotless whiteness and extraordinary beauty that they were sought for with eagerness over&nbsp;all Italy, as the most acceptable victims in their sacrifices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Is not this superstition then an effusion of gratitude?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such are the dictates of kind-hearted nature in our breasts, before it has been vitiated by vanity and self-conceit, and&nbsp;we should not be ashamed of feeling the impression. We&nbsp;hardly think of making any apology for dwelling a little on&nbsp;this incidental circumstance of the superstitious veneration&nbsp;paid to rivers. We cannot think that our readers will be&nbsp;displeased at having agreeable ideas excited in their minds,&nbsp;being always of opinion that the torch of true philosophy&nbsp;will not only enlighten the understanding, but also warm&nbsp;and cherish the affections of the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With respect to the origin of rivers, we have very little to offer in this place. It is obvious to every person, that&nbsp;besides the torrents which carry down into the rivers what&nbsp;part of the rains and melted snows is not absorbed by the&nbsp;soil or taken up by the plants which cover the earth, they&nbsp;are fed either immediately or remotely by the springs. A&nbsp;few remarkable streams rush at once out of the earth in&nbsp;force, and must be considered as the continuation of subterraneous rivers, whose origin we are therefore to seek&nbsp;out; and we do not know any circumstance in which their&nbsp;first beginnings differ from those of other rivers, which are&nbsp;formed by the union of little streams and rills, each of&nbsp;which has its own source in a spring or fountain. This&nbsp;question, therefore, what is the process of nature, and what&nbsp;are the supplies which fill our springs? will be treated of&nbsp;under the word Spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Whatever be the source of rivers, it is to be met with in almost every part of the globe. The crust of earth with&nbsp;which the rocky framing of this globe is covered is generally stratified. Some of these strata are extremely pervious to water, having but small attraction for its particles,&nbsp;and being very porous. Such is the quality of gravelly&nbsp;strata in an eminent degree. Other strata are much more&nbsp;firm, or attract water more strongly, and refuse it passage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is the case with firm rock and with clay. When a stratum of the first kind has one of the other immediately&nbsp;under it, the water remains in the upper stratum, and bursts&nbsp;out wherever the sloping sides of the hills cut off the strata,&nbsp;and this will be the form of a trickling spring, because the&nbsp;water in the porous stratum is greatly obstructed in its passage towards the outlet. As this irregular formation of the&nbsp;earth is very general, we must have springs, and of course&nbsp;rivers or rivulets, in every corner where there are high&nbsp;grounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rivers flow from the higher to the low grounds. It is</span></p>
