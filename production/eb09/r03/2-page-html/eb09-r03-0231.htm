<p><span class="font1">of Seneca, the only copy of which is in the Print Room at the British Museum, anil a beautiful figure of St Catherine, we can&nbsp;admit none of the other plates, said to proceed from Rubens, as&nbsp;authentic. Rubens nevertheless exercised an immense influence&nbsp;on the art of engraving. Under his direct guidance Soutman,&nbsp;Vorstennan, Pontius, Witdoeck, the two Bolswerts, Peterde Jode<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>N. Lauwers, and many others of less note left an immense number&nbsp;of beautiful plates, reproducing the most celebrated of his paintings. To give an idea of what his influence was capable of accomplishing, Pictorially speaking, it might be sufficient to notice the&nbsp;transformation undergone by the Antwerp school of engraving&nbsp;under Kubens; even the modern school of engraving, in more than&nbsp;one respect, is a continuation of the style first practised in&nbsp;Antwerp. His influence is scarcely less apparent in sculpture,&nbsp;and the celebrated Luke Fayd’herbe was his pupil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Neither in name nor in fact did the Flemish school ever find a second Rubens. None of his four sons became a painter, nor did&nbsp;any of his three daughters marry an artist. According to Rubens’s&nbsp;will, his drawings were to belong to that one of his sons who might&nbsp;become a painter, or in the event of one of his daughters marrying&nbsp;a celebrated artist they were to be her portion. The valuable&nbsp;collection was dispersed only in 16δ9, and of the pictures sold in&nbsp;1640 thirty-two became the property of the king of Spain. The&nbsp;Madrid Gallery alone possesses a hundred of his works. Four years&nbsp;after her husband’s death Helena Fourment married J. B. Van&nbsp;Brouckhoven de Bergheyck, knight of St James, member of the&nbsp;privy council, &lt;kc. She died in 1673. In 1746 the male line of&nbsp;Rubens’s descendants was completely extinct. In the female line&nbsp;more than a hundred families of name in Europe trace their descent&nbsp;from him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The paintings of Rubens are found in all the principal galleries in Europe : Antwerp and Brussels, Madrid, Paris, Lille, Dresden,&nbsp;Berlin, Munich, Vienna, St Petersburg, London, Florence, Milan,&nbsp;Turin exhibit several hundreds of his works.

<p><span class="font2">RUBRUQUIS, the name which has most commonly</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">been given to William of Rubruk, a Franciscan friar and the author of a remarkable narrative of Asiatic travel in&nbsp;the 13th century. Nothing is known of him save what&nbsp;can be gathered from his own narrative, with the exception&nbsp;of a word from the pen of Roger Bacon, his contemporary&nbsp;and brother Franciscan, indicating personal acquaintance.&nbsp;The name of Rubruquis has adhered to him, owing to this&nbsp;form (<sup>u</sup>Willielmus de Rubruquis ”) being found in the&nbsp;imperfect copy of the Latin original printed by Hakluyt&nbsp;in his collection, and followed in his English translation,&nbsp;as well as in the completer issue of the English by&nbsp;Purchas. Writers, again, of the 16th and 17th centuries&nbsp;have called the traveller Risbroucke and Rysbrokius, for&nbsp;which there is no authority,—an error founded on&nbsp;the too hasty identification of his name of origin with&nbsp;Ruysbroeck in Brabant (a few miles south of Brussels).&nbsp;This error was probably promoted by the fame of John&nbsp;of Ruysbroeck or Rysbroeck (1294-1381), a Belgian&nbsp;mystic theologian, whose treatises have been reprinted&nbsp;as late as 1848 (see vol. xvii. p. 133). Our traveller&nbsp;is styled “,Guillaume de Rysbroeck ” and “ Ruysbroek ”&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Biographie Universelle</span><span class="font2"> and in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nouv. Biog.&nbsp;Générale.</span><span class="font2"> It is only within the last twenty years that&nbsp;attention has been called to the fact that Rubrouck&nbsp;is the name of a village and commune in what was&nbsp;formerly called French Flanders, belonging to the canton of&nbsp;Cassel in the department du Nord, and lying some 8⅜ miles&nbsp;north-east of St Omer. In the library of the latter city&nbsp;many mediæval documents exist referring expressly to</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rubrouck, and to persons in the 12th and 13th centuries styled as “de Rubrouck.”@@<sup>1</sup> It may be fairly assumed that&nbsp;Friar William came from this place; indeed, if attention&nbsp;had been paid to the title of the MS. belonging to Lord&nbsp;Lumley, which was published by Hakluyt </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Itiuerarium&nbsp;fratris Willielini de Rubruguis de Ordinefratrum Minorum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Galli, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anno Gratiæ 1253, cul partes Orientales),</span><span class="font2"> there need&nbsp;have been no question as to the traveller’s quasi-French&nbsp;nationality;@@<sup>2</sup> but this (erroneously) has always been treated&nbsp;as if it were an arbitrary gloss of Hakluyt’s own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Friar William went to Tartary under orders from Louis IX. (St Louis). That king, at an earlier date, viz.,&nbsp;December 1248, when in Cyprus, had been visited by&nbsp;certain persons representing themselves to be envoys from&nbsp;a great Tartar chief Elchigaday (Ilchikadai), who commanded the Mongol hosts in Armenia and Persia. The&nbsp;king then despatched a return mission consisting of Friar&nbsp;Andrew of Lonjumel and other ecclesiastics, who cnrried&nbsp;presents and letters for both Ilchikadai and the Great&nbsp;Khan. They reached the court of the latter in the winter&nbsp;of 1249-50, when there was in fact no actual khan on the&nbsp;throne ; but in any case they returned, along with Tartar&nbsp;envoys, bearing a letter to Louis, which was couched in&nbsp;terms so arrogant and offensive that the king repented&nbsp;sorely of having sent such a mission </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(li rois se repenti fort&nbsp;quant il y envoia,</span><span class="font2"> Joinville, § 492). These returned envoys&nbsp;reached the king when he was at Cæsarea, therefore between March 1251 and May 1252. It was, however, not&nbsp;very long after that the zealous king, hearing that a great&nbsp;Tartar prince called Sartak was a baptized Christian, felt&nbsp;strongly moved to open communication with him, and for&nbsp;this purpose deputed Friar William of Rubruk with companions. But it is evident that the former rebuff had&nbsp;made the king chary as to giving these emissaries the&nbsp;character of his royal envoys, and Friar William on every&nbsp;occasion, beginning with a sermon delivered in St Sophia’s&nbsp;(on Palm Sunday, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font2"> April 13, 1253), formally disclaimed&nbsp;that character, alleging that, though he was the bearer of&nbsp;the king’s letters and presents, he went simply in fulfilment&nbsp;of his duty as a Franciscan and preacher of the gospel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Various histories of St Louis, and other documents which have come down to us, give particulars of the&nbsp;despatch of the mission of Friar Andrew from Cyprus, but&nbsp;none mention that of Friar William; and the first dates&nbsp;given by the latter are those of his sermon at Constantinople, and of his embarkation from Sinope (May 7, 1253).&nbsp;He must therefore have received his commission at Acre,&nbsp;where the king was residing from May 1252 to June 29,&nbsp;1253; but he had travelled by way of Constantinople, as&nbsp;has just been indicated, and there received letters to some&nbsp;of the Tartar chiefs from the emperor, who was at this time&nbsp;Baldwin de Courtenay, the last of the Latin dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The narrative of the journey is everywhere full of life and interest, but we cannot follow its details. The vast conquests of&nbsp;Jenghiz Khan were still in nominal dependence on his successors,&nbsp;at this time represented by Mangu Khan, reigning on the Mongolian steppes, but practically those conquests were splitting up into&nbsp;several great monarchies. Of these the Ulûs of Jûjî, the eldest&nbsp;son of Jenghiz, formed the most westerly, and its ruler was Bâtû&nbsp;Khan, established on the Volga. Sartak is known in the history&nbsp;of the Mongols as Bâtû’s eldest son, and was appointed his successor, though he died immediately after his father (1255). The&nbsp;story of Sartak’s profession of Christianity may have had some&nbsp;kind of foundation ; it was currently believed among the Asiatic</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A detailed notice of such documents was published by M. Edm.&nbsp;Coussemaker of Lille. See remarks by M. D’Avezac in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bull, de la&nbsp;Sοe. de Geοg.,</span><span class="font1"> 2d vol. for 1868, pp. 569-570.</span></p>

William’s&nbsp;mother-tongue may probably have been Flemish. But this cannot be&nbsp;proved by his representation to Mangu Khan (p. 361) that certain&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Teutonici</span><span class="font1"> who had been carried away as slaves by a Tartar chief were&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nostrœ linguae,</span><span class="font1"> as Dr Franz Schmidt inclines to think.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
