Bridge.” For the Hôtel de&nbsp;Ville he executed “ The Pleasures of Life ” and “ The Rosetime&nbsp;of Youth.” Besides the pictures already mentioned, a vast&nbsp;number of his works are to be found in the public galleries of&nbsp;France. The museum of the Hôtel de Ville in Paris owns his&nbsp;“ National Fête at Paris in 1880 ”; the Cognac Museum,&nbsp;“ Labour, Works at Suresnes ”; the Luxembourg, his “ War ”&nbsp;and “ Manda Lametrie, farm-hand.” At Avignon Museum is&nbsp;the “Don Juan and Haidee at Laval Museum, “Halt!”;&nbsp;at Fontainebleau Palace, “In Normandy”; at Pau Museum,&nbsp;“ Roubey, cementer” ; and at the Museum of Geneva, “ Marianne&nbsp;Offrey, crieuse de vert.” In portraiture he is known by his&nbsp;“ Yves Guyot,” “ Coquelin cadet,” “ Jules Simon,” &amp;c., but&nbsp;his greatest success was the group of “ Fritz Thaulow and his&nbsp;Wife.” In 1905 he replaced Carolus-Duran as president of&nbsp;the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, of which he was one of&nbsp;the founders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROLL (O. Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rolle, roulle,</span><span class="font0"> mod. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rôle,</span><span class="font0"> Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rotulus,</span><span class="font0"> dim. of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rota, </span><span class="font0">wheel), something rolled or wound up in a cylindrical form on an&nbsp;axis, or something which “ rolls,” that is, moves or is moved&nbsp;along a service by a turning motion. Primarily the word is&nbsp;used of a piece of writing material, such as parchment or paper,&nbsp;rolled up for the purpose of convenient storage, handling, &amp;c.&nbsp;This is the meaning of the Med. Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r OtuJus,</span><span class="font0"> defined by Du&nbsp;Cangeas “ Scheda,charta in speciem Totulaeseurotaeconvoluta/'&nbsp;It was thus the convenient name for any document kept in&nbsp;this form as an official record, and hence for any register, record,&nbsp;catalogue or official list. “The Rolls ” was the name of the&nbsp;building where the records of the Chancery Court were kept,&nbsp;the keeper of which was the Master </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(ç.îj.)</span><span class="font0"> of the Rolls, now the&nbsp;title of the third member of the English Supreme Court of&nbsp;Judicature. Other familiar examples of the use of the word&nbsp;in this sense are the list of those admitted as qualified solicitors,&nbsp;whence the phrase “ to strike off the rolls, ” of removal by the&nbsp;court of a solicitor for offences or delinquencies. There are&nbsp;numerous applications of the word to other objects packed in&nbsp;a cylindrical form, such as tobacco, cloth, &amp;c., and particularly&nbsp;to a small loaf of bread rolled over before baking, the crust&nbsp;being thin and crisp and the crumb spongy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In architecture a “ roll ” or “ scroll ” moulding is a moulding resembling a section of a roll or scroll of parchment with the&nbsp;end overlapping; a “ roll and fillet ” moulding is a section of&nbsp;a cylindrical moulding with a square fillet running along the&nbsp;centre of the face (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Label).</span><span class="font0"> For the sense of an object that&nbsp;rolls, the word “ roller ” is more general, but “ roll ” is frequent&nbsp;in technical usage for revolving cylinders, especially when&nbsp;working in fixed bearings. For the rolling of steel see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rolling&nbsp;Mill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROLLAND, JOHN (fl. 1560), Scottish poet, appears to have been a priest of the diocese of Glasgow, and to have been known&nbsp;in Dalkeith in 1555. He is the author of two poems, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Court&nbsp;of Venus</span><span class="font0"> and a translation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seven Sages.</span><span class="font0"> The former,&nbsp;which was printed by John Ros in 1575, may have been written&nbsp;before 1560. The latter was translated from a Scots prose&nbsp;version at the suggestion of an aunt (“ ane proper wenche ”),&nbsp;who had found his treatment of the courtly allegory involved&nbsp;and uninteresting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Court of Venus</span><span class="font0"> was edited by Walter Gregor for the S.T.S. in 1884. See W. A. Craigie’s long list of corrections of that edition&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Language Quarterly</span><span class="font0"> (March 1898). The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seven Sages&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">was printed in 1578, and frequently during the earlier decades of&nbsp;the 17th century. It was reprinted by David Laing for the Banna-tyne Club (1837). Sibbald, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle OfScottish Poetry</span><span class="font0"> (iii. 287),&nbsp;hinted that Rqlland may be the author of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thrie Priestis of&nbsp;Peblis.</span><span class="font0"> There is not a scrap of evidence in support of this; and&nbsp;there are many strong reasons against the ascription.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROLLE DE HAMPOLE, RICHARD (d. 1349), EngUsh hermit and author, was bom near the end of the 13th century, at</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thornton (now Thornton Dale), near Pickering, Yorkshire. His father, William Rolle, was perhaps a dependant of the&nbsp;NeviUe family. Richard was sent to Oxford at the expense of&nbsp;Thomas de NeviUe, afterwards archdeacon of Durham. At&nbsp;Oxford he gave himself to the study of reUgion rather than to&nbsp;the subtleties of scholastic phUosophy, for which he professed&nbsp;a strong distaste. At the age of nineteen he returned to his&nbsp;father’s house, and, making a rough attempt at a hermit’s dress&nbsp;out of two kirtles of his sister’s and a hood belonging to his&nbsp;father, he ran away to foUow the reUgious vocation. At Dalton,&nbsp;near Rotherham, he was recognized by John de Dalton, who&nbsp;had been at Oxford with him. After satisfying himself of&nbsp;RoUe’s sanity, Dalton’s father provided him with food and&nbsp;shelter and a hermit’s dress. RoUe then entered on the contemplative Ufe, passing through the preliminary stages of purification and iUumination, which lasted for nearly three years,&nbsp;and then entering the stage of sight, the fuU revelation of the&nbsp;divine vision. He is very exact in his dates, and attained, he&nbsp;says, the highest stage of his ecstasy four years and three months&nbsp;after the beginning of his conversion. Richard belonged to no&nbsp;order and acknowledged no rule. He left the Daltons, and&nbsp;wandered from place to place, resting when he found friends&nbsp;to provide for his wants. He seems to have desired to form&nbsp;a rule of hermits, but met with much opposition. The pious&nbsp;compilers of his “ office ” evidently thought it necessary to&nbsp;defend him against the charge of mere vagrancy. He nowhere&nbsp;says himself that his preaching made many converts, but his&nbsp;example was foUowed by many recluses in the north of England.&nbsp;After some years of wandering he gave up his more energetic&nbsp;propaganda, contenting himself with advising those who sought&nbsp;him out. He began also to write the songs and treatises by&nbsp;which he was to exert his widest influence. He settled in&nbsp;Richmondshire, twelve mfles from the recluse Margaret Kirkby,&nbsp;whom he had cured of a violent seizure. To her some of his&nbsp;works are dedicated. FinaUy he removed to Hampole, near&nbsp;Doncaster, invited by an inmate of the Cistercian nunnery of&nbsp;St Mary. There he died on the 29th of September 1349. Many&nbsp;miracles were wrought at his shrine, and, in view of an expected&nbsp;canonization, an office was drawn up giving an account of his&nbsp;life and the legends connected with it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Richard RoUe had a great influence on his own and the next generation. In his exaltation of the spiritual side of&nbsp;reUgion over its forms, his enthusiastic celebration of the love&nbsp;of Christ, and his assertion of the individuaUst principle, he&nbsp;represented the best side of the influences that led to the Lollard&nbsp;movement. He was himself a faithful son of the church, and&nbsp;the poUtical activity of the Lollards was quite foreign to his&nbsp;teaching. The popularity of his devotional writings is attested&nbsp;by the numerous existing editions and by the many close&nbsp;imitations of them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A very full list of his Latin and English works is given (pp. 36-43) in Dr Carl Horstmann’s edition (1895-96) of his works in the Library&nbsp;of Early English Writers. Some of his works exist in both English&nbsp;and Latin, andJt is often not easy to say which is the original version.&nbsp;The most considerable of them are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Pricke of Conscience</span><span class="font0"> and his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Commentary on the Psalter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Pricke of Conscience</span><span class="font0"> is a long religious poem, in rhyming couplets, dealing with the beginning of man’s life, the instability&nbsp;of the world, why death is to be dreaded, of doomsday, of the pains&nbsp;of hell, and the joys of heaven, the two latter subjects being treated&nbsp;with uncompromising realism. Rolle wrote in the northern dialect,&nbsp;but. southern transcripts are also found, and the poem exists in a&nbsp;Latin version </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Stimulus Conscientiae).</span><span class="font0"> The sources of this work included the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Contemptu Mundi sive de miseria humanae Conditionis&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Pope Innocent III., and Rolle also showed a knowledge of&nbsp;Bartholomew Glanville, Thomas Aquinas and Honorius of Awlun.&nbsp;His English devotional commentary on the Psalms follows very&nbsp;closely his Latin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Expositio Psalterii,</span><span class="font0"> which he based partly on Peter&nbsp;Lombard’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Catena.</span><span class="font0"> It often agrees with the English metrical&nbsp;Psalter preserved in three MSS. in the British Museum (Cotton&nbsp;Vesp. D. vii., Egerton 614, and Harl. 1770). Dr R. F. Littledale&nbsp;in his edition (1873) of I. M. Neale’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Commentary on the Psalms&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">called it a “ terse mystical paraphrase, which often comes very little&nbsp;short in beauty and depth of Dionysius the Carthusian himself.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is no complete and accessible edition of his works. The best collection is by C. Horstmann, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Yorkshire Writers: Richard&nbsp;Rolle of Harnpole; An English Father of the Church and his Followers</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
