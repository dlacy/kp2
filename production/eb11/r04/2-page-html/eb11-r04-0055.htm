<p><span class="font3">A reform effected by Justinian by his 115th Novel ought not to pass unnoticed; for it rendered superfluous all the old rules about&nbsp;disherison and praeterition of a testator’s children, practically abolished </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio contra tabulas</span><span class="font3"> as regards&nbsp;freeborn persons and established the principle that a child&nbsp;had, as a general rule, an inherent and indefeasible right&nbsp;to be one of his father’s heirs in a certain share at all events of his&nbsp;succession, and that a parent had the same right in the succession&nbsp;of his child if the latter had died without issue. The enactment&nbsp;enumerated certain grounds upon which alone it should be lawful&nbsp;for a parent to disinherit his child or a child his parent, declaring&nbsp;that in every case of disherison the reason of it should be stated in&nbsp;the testament, but giving leave to the person disinherited to dispute&nbsp;and disprove the facts when the testament was opened. If a child&nbsp;who had not been disinherited-y-and one improperly disinherited&nbsp;was eventually in the same position—was not instituted to some&nbsp;share, however small, of his parent’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hereditas,</span><span class="font3"> he was entitled to&nbsp;have the testament declared, null in so far as the institutions in&nbsp;it were concerned, thus opening the succession to himself and the&nbsp;other heirs-at-law, but without affecting accessory provisions, such&nbsp;as bequests., nominations of tutors, &amp;c.; and if the share to which&nbsp;he was instituted was less than his legitim </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(legitima</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">debita portio)&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">he was entitled to an action in supplement. The legitim, which&nbsp;under the practice of the centum viral court had been one-fourth&nbsp;of the share to which the child would have been entitled </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ab intestato,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">had been raised by Justinian (by Novel 18) to one-third at least,&nbsp;and one-half where there were five or.more entitled to participate.&nbsp;He did not allow challenge of the will to be excluded, as in the&nbsp;earlier </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">querela inofficiosi testamentó,</span><span class="font3"> because the testator had made&nbsp;advances to his child during his life or left him a legacy which&nbsp;quantitatively equalled the legitim; his idea was that a child was&nbsp;entitled to recognition by his parent </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">as one of his heirs,</span><span class="font3"> and that to&nbsp;deny him that position without statutory grounds was to put upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">him an indignity which the law would not permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Amongst the other beneficial changes effected by Justinian may be mentioned the assimilation so far as possible of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hereditas</span><span class="font3"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio,</span><span class="font3"> so that the latter might be taken like&nbsp;the former without formal petition for a grant of it; the&nbsp;cquiparation of legacies and singular trust-gifts, and&nbsp;the application of some of their rules to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa</span><span class="font3"> donations; the&nbsp;extension of the principle of “ transmission ” to every heir without&nbsp;exception, so that, if he died within the time allowed him for considering whether or not he would accept </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(tempus deliberandi),</span><span class="font3"> his&nbsp;power of acceptance or declinature passed to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font3"> heirs, to be exercised&nbsp;by them within what remained 01 the period; the introduction of&nbsp;entry under inventory </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(cum beneficio inventarii),</span><span class="font3"> which limited the&nbsp;heir’s responsibilities and rendered unnecessary the nine or twelve&nbsp;months of deliberation; and the application of the principle of&nbsp;collation to descendants generally, so that they were bound to throw&nbsp;into the mass of the succession before its partition every advance</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Their Use in the Courts and in the Schools.—</span><span class="font3">Although the Institutes were primarily intended to serve as a text-book in the schools,&nbsp;it was expressly declared that it and the Digest and the&nbsp;Code should be regarded as just so many parts of one great&nbsp;piece of legislation and all of equal authority; and that,&nbsp;although Digest and Code were but collections of common&nbsp;law and legislation that had proceeded originally from many&nbsp;different hands, yet they were to be treated with the same respect&nbsp;as if they had. been the work of Justinian himself. But, while&nbsp;everything within them was to be held as law, nothing outside them&nbsp;was to be looked at, not even the volumes from which they had been&nbsp;collected; and so far did this go that, after the publication in 534&nbsp;of the revised Code, neither the first edition of it nor the Fifty&nbsp;Decisions were allowed to be referred to. If a case arose for which&nbsp;no precedent was to be found, the emperor was to be resorted to for&nbsp;his decision, as being outside his collections the only fountain of the&nbsp;law. To preserve the purity of the texts Justinian forbade the use&nbsp;of conventional abbreviations </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(sigla)</span><span class="font3"> in making transcripts, visiting&nbsp;an offender with the penalties of falsification </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(crimen falsi).</span><span class="font3"> Literal&nbsp;translations into Greek were authorized, and indeed were necessary&nbsp;for many of his subjects; so were indexes and 7rapáTtTÁa, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">summaries of parallel passages, texts or individual titles. Commentaries and general summaries were forbidden under heavy&nbsp;penalties, as an interference with the imperial prerogative of interpretation.<sup>@@1</sup> But these prohibitions do not seem to have been&nbsp;enforced, as we have accounts and. remains not only of translations&nbsp;but of commentaries, notes, abridgments, excerpts and general&nbsp;summaries even in Justinian’s lifetime. These, it. is true, were&nbsp;mostly by professors </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(antecessores),</span><span class="font3"> and their productions may have&nbsp;been intended primarily for educational purposes; but they soon&nbsp;passed into the hands of the practitioners and were used without&nbsp;scruple in the courts. A Greek </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Paraphrase of the Institutes,</span><span class="font3"> usually</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3">attributed to Theophilus, a professor in Constantinople and one of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">¿</span><span class="font3">ustinian’s commissioners, has been supposed to have been used y him in his prelections. It embodies much more. historical&nbsp;matter than is to be found in the Institutes; but .it contains a good&nbsp;many inaccuracies and its value has been very differently rated by&nbsp;different critics. Its latest editor, Ferrini, who puts a high estimate&nbsp;on it, is of opinion that the original of it was a reproduction in Greek&nbsp;of Gaius, drawn up at Beirut, which was remodelled after the plan&nbsp;of Justinian’s Institutes, and had the new matter of this latter work&nbsp;subsequently incorporated in order to adapt it to the altered conditions; but he denies that there is any sufficient authority for&nbsp;ascribing it to Theophilus. If he be right in assuming that it was&nbsp;really based on a redaction of Gaius, its historical explanations will&nbsp;be received with all the more confidence.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fate of the Justinianian Books in the Fast.'—</span><span class="font3">The literary work indicated in the preceding section was continued throughout the 6th&nbsp;century.

<p><span class="font3">an abstract of the. whole Justinianian law amended and rearranged; but it was repealed by Basil the Macedonian on&nbsp;account of its imperfections and its audacious departure from the&nbsp;law it pretended to summarize. The last-named emperor, followed&nbsp;by his son Leo the Philosopher, set themselves in the end of the 9th&nbsp;and beginning of the 10th centuries to the production of an authoritative Greek version of the whole of the Justinianian collections&nbsp;and legislation, omitting what had since become obsolete, excising&nbsp;redundancies, and introducing such of the post-Justinianian legislation as they thought merited preservation. The result was^the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Basilica</span><span class="font3"> (TA BaatXucA, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">sc. vAgtga), which was</span><span class="font3"> completed and published&nbsp;in the reign of Leo, though begun in the reign of Basil, who also&nbsp;published a sort </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font3">institutional work, entitled BpAxctpov, which was&nbsp;revised and republished by Leo under the name of ’Eira^ayory^ <sup>To</sup>^ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rtytov.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Basilica<sup>@@3</sup> </span><span class="font3">consists of sixty books, subdivided into titles, following&nbsp;generally the.plan of the Justinianian Code, but ynth the whole law&nbsp;on any particular subject arranged consecutively, whether, from&nbsp;Institutes, Digest, Code or Novels (seearticle </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Basilica).</span><span class="font3"> Leo’s son,&nbsp;Constantinus Porphyrogenitus, made an addition to it in the shape&nbsp;of an official commentary collected from the writings of the 6th-century jurists, the so-called IIapa7pa4&gt;at </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">twv</span><span class="font3"> iraAai&amp;r, which is&nbsp;now spoken of as the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">scholia</span><span class="font3"> to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Basilica,</span><span class="font3"> and has done good&nbsp;exegetical service for modern civilians.

The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Basilica</span><span class="font3"> retained its statutory authority until&nbsp;the fall of the Byzantine. Empire in 1453. But long before that&nbsp;it had fallen into neglect in practice; and though nearly the whole&nbsp;of it and a great part of its </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">scholia</span><span class="font3"> have come to us, yet not a. single&nbsp;complete copy of it exists. Its place was taken by epitomes&nbsp;and compendia, the last being the *E;A0i0Aos of Constantinus&nbsp;Harmenopoulos about 1345, “a miserable epitome of the epitomes&nbsp;of epitomes,” as Bruns calls it, which survived the vicissitudes of&nbsp;the centuries, and finally received statutory authority in the modern&nbsp;kingdom of Greece in the year 1835, in place of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Basilica,</span><span class="font3"> which&nbsp;had been sanctioned thirteen years before, in 1822.<sup>@@4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Their Fate in the West.—</span><span class="font3">Before the rise of the Bologna school it was to a much greater extent from the Romano-Barbarian codes than&nbsp;from the books of J ustinian that centrafand western Europe,&nbsp;apart from Italy, derived their acquaintance with Roman&nbsp;law.. Theoderic’s Edict can have had little influence after&nbsp;J ustinian's recovery of Italy, and the Roma no-Burgundian&nbsp;law was no doubt gradually displaced by Alaric’s Breviary after&nbsp;Burgundy had fallen into the hands of the Franks; but the Breviary&nbsp;itself found its way in all directions in France and Germany, penetrating even into England, mainly through the agency of the church.&nbsp;There must, however, have been other repertories of Roman law in&nbsp;circulation (and among others, probably either Gaius’s. Commentaries or Ulpian’s Rules), as witness a testament made ¡n Paris in&nbsp;the end of the 7th century, mentioned by Sa vigny as preserved by&nbsp;Mabillon, in which the testator uses the old formula of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,—&nbsp;“ ita do, ita lego, ita testor, ita vos Quirites testimonium mihi per-hibetote,”</span><span class="font3"> words that are not to be found either in the Visigothic or&nbsp;the Justinianian collections.
