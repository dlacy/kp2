                    Karnes, is a term appropriated to ſuch thoughts as are prompted by paſſion. It
                    differs from a perception ; for a perception ſigniſies the add by which we
                    become conscious of external objects. It differs from conſciouſnefs of an
                    internal action, ſuch as thinking, ſuſpending thought, inclining, reſolving,
                    willing, &amp; c. And it differs from the conception of a relation among objects
                    ; a conception of that kind being termed <hi rend="italic"
                        >opinion.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sentiments,</hi> in poetry. To
                    talk in the language of muſic, each paſſion hath a certain tone, to which every
                    ſentiment proceeding from it ought to be tuned with the greateſt accuracy :
                    which is no eaſy work, eſpecially where ſuch harmony ought to be ſupported
                    during the courſe of a long theatrical repreſentation. In order to reach ſuch
                    delicacy of execution, it is neceſſary that a writer aſſume the preciſe
                    character and paſſion of the personage repreſented ; which requires an uncommon
                    genius. But it is the only difficulty ; for the writer, who, annihilating
                    himſelf, can thus become another perſon, need be in no pain about the ſentiments
                    that belong to the aſſumed character : theſe will flow without the leaſt ſtudy,
                    or even preconception ; and will frequently be as delightfully new to himſelſ as
                    to his reader. But if a lively picture even of a ſingle emotion require an
                    effort of genius, how much greater the effort to compoſe a passionate dialogue
                    with as many different tones of paſſion as there are ſpeakers ? With what
                    ductility of feeling muſt that writer be endued, who approaches perfection in
                    ſuch a work ; when it is neceſſary to aſſume different and even oppoſite
                    characters and paſſions in the quickeſt ſucceſſion ? Yet this work, difficult as
                    it is, yields to that of compoſing a dialogue in genteel comedy, exhibiting
                    characters without paſſion. The reason is, that the different tones of character
                    are more delicate, and leſs in fight, than thoſe of paſſion ; and, accordingly,
                    many writers, who have no genius for drawing characters, make a ſhift to
                    represent, tolerably well, an ordinary paſſion in its ſimple movements. But of
                    all works of this kind, what is truly the moſt difficult, is a characteriſtical
                    dialogue upon any philofophical ſubject ; to interweave characters with
                    reaſoning, by ſuiting to the character of each ſpeaker a peculiarity not only of
                    thought but of expreſſion, requires the perfection of genius, taſte, and
                    judgment.</p><p>How difficult dialogue-writing is, will be evident, even without
                    reaſoning, from the miſerable compoſitions of that kind found without number in
                    all languages. The art of mimicking any ſingularity in geſture or in voice, is a
                    rare talent, though directed by sight and hearing, the acuteſt and moſt lively
                    of our external ſenſes : how much more rare muſt that talent be, of imitating
                    characters and internal emotions, tracing all their different tints, and
                    repreſenting them in a lively manner by natural ſentiments properly expressed ?
                    The truth is, ſuch execution is too delicate for an ordinary genius; and for
                    that reason the bulk of writers, inſtead of expressing a paſſion as one does who
                    feels it, content themſelves with deſcribing it in the language of a ſpectator.
                    To awake passion by an internal effort merely, without any external cauſe,
                    requires great ſenſibility ; and yet that operation is necessary, not leſs to
                    the writer than to the actor ; becauſe none but thoſe who actually feel a
                    paſſion can repreſent it to the life. The writer’s part is the more complicated
                    : he muſt add compoſition to paſſion : and muſt, in the quickeſt ſucceſſion,
                    adopt every different character. But a very humble flight of imagination may
                    ſerve to convert a<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0282.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0276"/> writer into a ſpectator, ſo as to figure, in
                    some obſcure manner, an action as paſſing in his sight and hearing. In that
                    figured ſituation, being led naturally to write like a ſpectator, he entertains
                    his readers with his own reflections, with cool deſcription, and florid
                    declamation ; inſtead of making them eye-witneſſes, as it were, to a real event,
                    and to every movement of genuine paſſion. Thus moſt of our plays appear to be
                    cast in the same mould ; perſonages without character, the mere outlines of
                    paſſion, a tireſome monotony, and a pompous declamatory ſtyle.</p><p>This
                    deſcriptive manner of repreſenting paſſion is a very cold entertainment ; our
                    ſympathy is not raiſed by deſcription ;. we muſt firſt be lulled into a dream of
                    reality, and every thing muſt appear as paſſing in our light. Unhappy is the
                    player of genius who acts a part in what may be termed a <hi rend="italic"
                        >deſcriptive tragedy ;</hi> after aſſuming the very paſſion that is to be
                    repreſented, how is he cramped in action, when he muſt utter, not the ſentiments
                    of the paſſion he feels, but a cold deſcription in the language of a byſtander ?
                    It is that imperfection, undoubtedly, in the bulk of our plays, which confines
                    our ſtage almoſt entirely to Shakeſpeare, notwithſtanding his many
                    irregularities. In our late Engliſh tragedies, we ſometimes find ſentiments
                    tolerably well adapted to a plain paſſion : but we muſt not in any of them
                    expect a ſentiment expreſſive of character ; and, upon that very account, our
                    late performances of the dramatic kind are for the moſt part intolerably
                    inſipid.</p><p>But it may be proper to illuſtrate this ſubject by examples. The
                    firſt examples ſhall be of ſentiments that appear the legitimate offspring of
                    paſſion ; to which ſhall be oppoſed what are deſcriptive only, and illegitimate
                    : and in making this compariſon, the inſtances ſhall be borrowed from <bibl>
                        Shakeſpeare </bibl> and <bibl> Corneille </bibl> , who for genius in

                <bibl> King Lear , act 3. sc. 5. </bibl><p>With regard to the French author, truth
                    obliges us to acknowledge, that he deſcribes in the ſtyle of a ſpectator,
                    inſtead of expreſſing paſſion like one who feels it ; which naturally betrays
                    him into a tireſome monotony, and a pompous declamatory ſtyle. It is ſcarce
                    neceſſary to give examples, for he never varies from that tone. We ſhall,
                    however, take two paſſages at a venture, in order to be confronted with thoſe
                    tranſcribed above. In the tragedy of <bibl> Cinna </bibl> , alter the conspiracy
                    was diſcovered, Æmilia, having nothing in view but racks and death to herſelf
                    and her lover, receives a pardon from Auguſtus, attended with the brighteſt
                    circumſtances of magnanimity and tenderneſs. This is a lucky ſituation for
                    repreſenting the paſſions of surpriſe and gratitude in their different ſtages,
                    which ſeem naturally to be what follow. Theſe paſſions, raiſed at once to the
                    utmoſt pitch, and being at firſt too big for utterance, muſt, for ſome moments,
                    be expreſſed by violent geſtures only : ſo ſoon as there is vent for words, the
                    firſt expreſſions are broken and interrupted : at laſt, we ought to expect a
                    tide of intermingled ſentiments, occaſioned by the fluctuation of the mind
                    between the two paſſions. Æmilia is made to behave in a very different manner :
                    with extreme coolness ſhe deſcribes her own ſituation, as if ſhe were merely a
                    ſpectator ; or rather the poet takes the taſk off her hands:</p><sp>

                    <l> Je recouvre la vûe auprès de leurs clartés. </l>
                    <l> Je connois mon forfait qui me sembloit juſtice ; </l>
                    <l> Et ce que n’avoit pû la terreur du supplice, </l>
                    <l> Je fens naître en mon ame un repentir puissant, </l>
                    <l> Et mon cœur en secret me dit, qu’il y consent. </l>
                    <l> Le ciel a resolu votre grandeur suprême ; </l>
                    <l> Et pour preuve, Seigneur, je n’en veux que moi-même. </l>

                    continue uniform any conſiderable time : they generally fluctuate, ſwelling and

            <p>Theſe ſentiments are certainly not the firſt that are ſuggeſted by the paſſion of
                reſentment. As the firſt movements of reſentment are always directed to its object,
                the very ſame is the caſe of grief. Yet with relation to the hidden and ſevere
                diſtemper that ſeized Alexander bathing in the river Cydnus, Quintus Curtius
                deſcribes the firſt emotions of the army as directed to themſelves, lamenting that
                they were left without a leader, far. from home, and had ſcarce any hopes of
                returning in ſafety : their king’s diſtreſs, which muſt naturally have been their
                firſt concern, occupies them but in the ſecond place according to that author. In
                the Aminta of Taſſo, Sylvia, upon a report of her lover’s death, which ſhe believed
                certain, inſtead of bemoaning the loss of her beloved, turns her thoughts upon

            <p>Theſe are the reflections of a cool ſpectator. A paſſion, while it has the aſcendant,

            <p>A fourth obſervation is, That nature, which gave us paſſions, and made them extremely
                beneficial when moderate, intended undoubtedly that they ſhould be ſubjected to the
                government of reaſon and conſcience. It is therefore againſt the order of nature,
                that paſſion in any case ſhould take the lead in contradiction to reaſon and
                conſcience : ſuctr a ſtate of mind is a fort of anarchy which every one is aſhamed
                of and endeavours to hide or diſſemble. Even love, however laudable, is attended
                with a conſcious ſhame when it becomes immoderate : it is covered from the world,
                and diſcloſed only to the beloved object :</p>
            <sp>
                <l> Et que l’amour ſouvent de remors combattu </l>

            <bibl> Two Gentlemen of Verona , act 1.sc. 3. </bibl>
            <p>Hence a capital rule in the repreſentation of immoderate paſſions, that they ought to
                be hid or diſſembled as much as poſſible. And this holds in an eſpecial manner with
                reſpect to criminal paſſions : one never counſels the commiſſion of a crime in plain
                terms ; guilt muſt not appear in its native colours, even in thought ; the propoſal
                muſt be made by hints, and by repreſenting the action in ſome favourable light. Of
                the propriety of ſentiment upon ſuch an occaſion, Shakespeare, in the <hi

                <l> What thou ſhouldſt be : the occaſion ſpeaks thee, and </l>

            <p>II. As things are beſt illuſtrated by their contraries, we proceed to faulty
                ſentiments, diſdaining to be indebted for examples to any but the moſt approved
                authors. The firſt claſs ſhall conſiſt of ſentiments that accord not with the
                paſſion ; or, in other words, ſentiments that the paſſion does not naturally
                ſuggeſt. In the ſecond claſs ſhall be ranged ſentiments that may belong to an
                ordinary paſſion, but unſuitable to it as tinctured by a ſingular character.
                Thoughts that properly are not ſentiments, but rather deſcriptions, make a third.
                Sentiments that belong to the paſſion represented, but are faulty as being
                introduced too early or too late, make a fourth, Vicious ſentiments expoſed in their
                native dreſs, inſtead of being concealed or diſguiſed, make a fifth. And in the laſt
                claſs shall be collected ſentiments ſuited to no character nor paſſion, and
                therefore unnatural.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> claſs contains faulty ſentiments of various kinds,
                which we ſhall endeavour to diſtinguiſh from each other.</p>
            <p>1. Of ſentiments that are faulty by being above the tone of the paſſion, the
                following may ſerve as an example :</p>
            <sp>
                <speaker> Othello. </speaker>
                <l> —O my soul’s joy ! </l>
                <l> If after every tempeſt come ſuch calms, </l>
                <l> May the winds blow till they have waken’d death : </l>
                <l> And let the labouring bark climb hills of ſeas </l>
                <l> Olympus high, and duck again as low </l>
                <l> As hell’s from heaven ? </l>

            <p>This ſentiment may be ſuggeſted by violent and inflamed paſſion ; but is not ſuited
                to the ſatisfaction, however great, that one feels upon eſcaping danger.</p>
            <p>2. Inſtance of ſentiments below the tone of the paſſion. Ptolemy, by putting Pompey
                to death, having incurred the diſpleaſure of Cæsar, was in the utmoſt dread of being
                dethroned : in that agitating ſituation, Corneille makes him utter a ſpeech full of
                cool reflection, that is in no degree expreſſive of the paſſion.</p>

                <l> Are not my eyes guilty alike with theirs, </l>
                <l> That thus can gaze, and yet not turn to ſtone ? </l>
                <l> —I do not weep ! The ſprings of tears are dry’d, </l>

            <p><bibl> Pope ’s elegy to the memory of an unfortunate lady </bibl> , expreſſes
                delicately the moſt tender concern and ſorrow that one can feel for the deplorable
                fate of a perſon of worth. Such a poem, deeply ſerious and pathetic, rejects with
                diſdain all fiction. Upon that account, the following passage deserves no quarter ;
                for it is not the language of the heart, but of the imagination indulging its
                flights at eaſe, and by that means is eminently diſcordant with the ſubject. It
                would be a ſtill more ſevere cenſure, if it ſhould be aſcribed to imitation, copying
                indiſcreetly what has been ſaid by others :</p>
            <lg>
                <l> What tho’ no weeping loves thy aſhes grace, </l>
                <l> Nor poliſh’d marble emulate thy face ? </l>
                <l> What though no ſacred earth allow thee room, </l>
                <l> Nor hallow’d dirge be mutter’d o’er thy tomb ? </l>
                <l> Yet ſhall thy grave with riſing flow’rs be dreſt, </l>
                <l> And the green turf lie lightly on thy breaſt : </l>
                <l> There ſhall the morn her earlieſt tears beſtow, </l>
                <l> There the firſt roſes of the year ſhall blow ; </l>
                <l> While angels with their ſilver wings o’erſhade </l>

            <p>5. Fanciful or finical ſentiments. Sentiments that degenerate into point or conceit,

                ſituation, underſtood to be dead, he is diſcovered by Erminia, who was in love with
                him to distraction. A more happy ſituation cannot be imagined, to raiſe grief in an
                inſtant to its higheſt pitch ; and yet, in venting her ſorrow, ſhe deſcends moſt
                abominably into antithesis and conceit even of the loweſt kind :</p>

            <p>The Lady Macbeth, projecting the death of the king, has the following ſoliloquy :</p>

                <l> —The raven himſelf’s not hoarse </l>
                <l> That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan </l>
                <l> Under my battlements. Come, all you ſpirits </l>
                <l> That tend on mortal thoughts, unſex me here, </l>
                <l> And fill me from the crown to the toe, top full </l>
                <l> Of direct cruelty ; make thick my blood, </l>
                <l> Stop up th’ acceſs and paſſage to remorſe, </l>
                <l> That no compunctious viſitings of nature </l>

            </sp>
            <bibl> Macbeth , act 1. ſc. 7. </bibl>
            <p>This ſpeech is not natural. A treacherous murder was never perpetrated even by the
                moſt hardened miſcreant without compunction : and that the lady here muſt have been
                in horrible agitation, appears from her invoking the infernal ſpirits to fill her
                with cruelty, and to stop up all avenues to remorſe. But in that ſtate of mind it is
                a never-failing artifice off ſelf-deceit to draw the thickeſt veil over the wicked
                action, and to extenuate it by all the circumſtances that imagination can ſuggeſt :
                and if the crime cannot bear diſguiſe, the next attempt is to thruſt it out of mind
                altogether, and to ruſh on to action without thought. This laſt was the huſhand’s
                method.</p>

            </sp>
            <bibl> Act 3. sc. 5. </bibl>
            <p>The lady follows neither of theſe courſes, but in a deliberate manner endeavours to
                fortify her heart in the commiſſion of an execrable crime, without even attempting
                to colour it. This, we think, is not natural ; we hope there is no ſuch wretch to be
                found as is here repreſented.</p>
            <p>The <hi rend="italic">last</hi> claſs comprehends ſentiments that are unnatural, as
                being ſuited to no character nor paſſion. Theſe may be ſubdivided into three
                branches : firſt, ſentiments unſuitable to the conſtitution of man, and to the laws
                of his nature ; second, inconsiſtent ſentiments ; third, ſentiments that are pure
                rant and extravagance.</p>
            <p>When the fable is of human affairs, every event, every incident, and every
                circumſtance, ought to be natural, otherwiſe the imitation is imperfect. But an
                imperfect imitation is a venial fault, compared with that of running croſs to
                nature. In the <bibl> Hippolytus of Euripides (act iv. ſc. 5.) </bibl> , Hippolytus,
                wiſhing for another ſelf in his own ſituation, “ How much (ſays he) ſhould I be
                touched with his misfortune !” as if it were natural to grieve more for the
                misfortune of another than for one’s own.</p>

            <p>The famous <bibl> epitaph on Raphael </bibl> is not leſs abſurd than any of the

            </lg>
            <p>Initiated by Pope, in his epitaph on Sir Godfrey Kneller:</p>
            <lg>
                <l> Living, great Nature fear’d he might outvie </l>
