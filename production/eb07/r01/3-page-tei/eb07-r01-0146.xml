They feed on insects, and scarcely equal the size of the gray lizard of Europe. They capture their prey with great alacrity ; and the different individuals are said to fight fiercely when they meet each other. We may mention as an example the red-throat lizard, called by Catesby the green lizard of Jamaica (Z. <hi rend="italic">bullaris,</hi>  Linn.). Its muzzle is short, speckled with brown, the eyelids projecting, and the prevailing colour a grassy green. It is common in Jamaica, where it frequents hedges and trees, but does not enter houses. When approached or angered it protrudes its gu-lar pouch, which speedily becomes as bright as a cherry. This peculiar change may be regarded as a kind of menace, to deter its enemy from closer quarters. It is incapable of inflicting the slightest injury by its bite or otherwise. Another species is Catesby’s green Carolina lizard <hi rend="italic">(An. Caro-Iinensis),</hi>  which is of a beautiful golden green, the muzzle flat and elongated. This kind is said by Catesby to be very common in Carolina, where it frequents houses, and becomes in a manner familiar, so as to sport about tables and windows, catching flies with great dexterity. It is seen chiefly in summer, retreating in winter into hollow trees, where it assumes the torpid state. Sometimes, when tempted by delusive sunshine, it re-appears, and on the return of chilly weather becomes enfeebled by the cold and dies. Its colour changes frequently from green to brown, according to the temperature.</p><p>FAMILY IV—GECKOTIDÆ.</p><p>This family consists of what may be termed the nocturnal lizards, all of which bear a strong resemblance to each other. Baron Cuvier regards them as constituting a single genus, divisible according to the form and structure of the toes, as after mentioned.</p><p>The genus Gecko may be characterized as consisting of Saurian reptiles, of not so lank a form as those of the preceding genera. They are rather of a flattened shape, especially about the head ; the feet are of medium size, and the toes of nearly equal length. Their gait is heavy and crawling. Their eyes are large, and the pupil extremely contractile under the influence of light, so that they usually keep themselves concealed throughout the day in dark or sombre places. Their eyelids are very short, and withdraw entirely between the eye and the orbit, which bestows on these animals a very peculiar physiognomy. Their tongue is fleshy, not extensile ; the jaws are furnished all around with a row of very small close-set teeth ; the palate is toothless. The skin is chagrined above with very small granular scales, among which some larger tubercles are often dispersed ; the under parts are covered by flat-tish scales scarcely so small, and imbricated. The pores on the thigh are not here regarded as a generic character, being absent in some and present in others. The tail is marked by circular folds, as in the genus <hi rend="italic">Anolis ;</hi>  but when mutilated, it has been noticed to renew itself without these folds. This genus is numerous and widely spread, occurring both in the old world and the new. @@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  The dull and doleful aspect of the geckoes, and a certain resemblance which they bear to toads and newts, render them liable to the imputation of poisonous properties,—an assumption without proof, and altogether against analogy.</p><p>The majority of the species have the toes enlarged for a greater or less extent, and furnished beneath with regular folds upon the skin, which, by some peculiar action, enable them to adhere to smooth surfaces, to ascend perpendicular walls, and even to creep in a reversed position along a ceiling. The claws are retractile in different ways, and preserve their points and cutting edges; and these characters, combined with the contractile nature of the pupil, has induced a comparison of the geckoes among reptiles to the feline tribes among carnivorous quadrupeds. The claws, however, vary in the different species, and in some are altogether wanting. It is in accordance with the particular structure of the toes in different species that the geckoes have been subdivided into several separate groups, which some authors regard as constituting so many distinct genera. @@<hi rend="sup">2</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect. L—Platydactyli. Toes widened throughout, and furnished beneath with transverse scales.</hi></p><p>In certain species of this section of the genus the nails are entirely wanting, and the thumb is very small. They are rather ornamental in their aspect, covered over by tubercles, and adorned by lively colours. They occur in the Isle of France. Some have no pores upon the thighs : such are <hi rend="italic">G. inunguis,</hi>  Cuv., of a violet colour above, white beneath, with a black line along the sides ; and <hi rend="italic">G. ocellatus, </hi>Oppel, of a gray hue, covered with brown spots, with white centres. Some possess the pores, as <hi rend="italic">G. Cepediensis,</hi>  a yellowish-red coloured species, marbled with blue, and marked with white along the sides.</p><p>In other platydactylous geckoes the nails are wanting only on the thumbs, and on the second and fifth toes of all the feet, and there are no pores upon the thighs. To this little group belongs the wall-gecko, a European species <hi rend="italic">(G.ftscicularis,</hi>  Daud.), called <hi rend="italic">Terrentola</hi>  by the Italians. It is of a deep-gray colour, with a rough head ; all the upper parts beset with tubercles, each of which is formed of three or four others of smaller size. It is a creature of a most unseemly aspect, which hides itself in the holes of walls, or beneath heaps of stones, and moreover covers its body with dust and ordure. It, however, delights also in sunshine, and is said not to occur in damp or very sombre situations. In winter it lies inert, but not torpid. It inhabits the countries around the Mediterranean, and ventures as far north as Provence and Languedoc. A nearly allied species occurs in Egypt and Barbary,—G. <hi rend="italic">Ægyp-tiacus,</hi>  Cuv. Its tubercles are round and simple, more projecting on the sides.</p><p>The greater number of the platydactylous species want the nails only on the four thumbs, and have a range of pores anterior to the anus. <hi rend="italic">G. guttatus,</hi>  Daud. has a reddish coloured body, spotted w ith white, and beset by round-</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1 </hi>The following table exhibits a view of the geographical distribution of the<hi rend="italic">Geckotidir,</hi>  so far as known at this time :</p><table><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Generic Groups.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Europe.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Asia.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Africa.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>America.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Australasia and Polynesia.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Locality</p><p>Unknown.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>ToUl</p><p>Species.</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Platydactylus......</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>......1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>5</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>5</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>I</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>∣7</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Heinidaetylus......</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>.......1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>5</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>I</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>12</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Ptyodactvlus......</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>......O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>4</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Phyllodactvlus....</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>......O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>8</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Splieriodactylus...</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>......O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Gymnodactvlus...</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>......O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>9</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Stenofiactylus......</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>.......O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>O</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>—</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>_</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>— </p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>——</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>——</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>—</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Totals.............</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>......2</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>13</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>12</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>12</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>12</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>4</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>55</p></cell></row></table><p>@@@ <hi rend="sup">2</hi> See<hi rend="italic">Erpitologie Giitirale,</hi>  iii. 290.</p></body></text></TEI>
