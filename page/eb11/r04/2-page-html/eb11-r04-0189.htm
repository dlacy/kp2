                The&nbsp;sanctuary dome differs in several&nbsp;respects from those of the
                nave.&nbsp;Unlike the latter, which seem to&nbsp;rest on the flat roofing of
                the&nbsp;church, the dome of the sanctuary&nbsp;emerges gradually out of - the
                substructure, the supporting walls on the&nbsp;north and south being kept down
                so&nbsp;as to give greater elegance to the&nbsp;eastern turrets. The apsidal
                termination of the choir in the east&nbsp;is covered in with a concrete
                vault&nbsp;surmounted by a timber roof, in&nbsp;striking contrast to the domes
                covering the other portions of the structure. Fig. 13 is a section through&nbsp;the
                nave showing how the domes&nbsp;are buttressed, fig. 14 is a section&nbsp;through
                the sanctuary dome, and&nbsp;figs. 15 ami 16 a section and part&nbsp;plan of the
                vaulting of the choir with&nbsp;its wood span roof above the concrete
            vault.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Covering Materials for Roofs,</span><span
                class="font0">—There are a. large number of different roof-covering materials in
                common use, of&nbsp;which short descriptions, giving the&nbsp;principal
                characteristics, may be useful.&nbsp;The nature of the material employed&nbsp;as the
                outer covering affects the details&nbsp;of roof construction very
                considerably.&nbsp;A light covering such as felt or corrugated iron can be safely
                laid upon a much&nbsp;lighter timber framing than is necessary&nbsp;for a heavy
                covering of tiles or slates.</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font0">Roofing felt is an inexpensive fabric of animal or
                    vegetable fibre treated with asphalt to make it capable of resisting the&nbsp;weather. It
                    is largely used&nbsp;as a roofing material for temporary buildings. When exposed
                    to the weather it should&nbsp;be treated with an application&nbsp;of a compound
                    of tar and&nbsp;slaked lime well boiled and&nbsp;applied hot, the surface
                    being&nbsp;sprinkled with sand before it&nbsp;becomes hard. Felt is
                    also&nbsp;used on permanent buildings&nbsp;as a good non-conductor of&nbsp;heat
                    under slating and other&nbsp;roof - covering materials. In&nbsp;this case it is
                    not tarred and&nbsp;sanded. It is supplied in rolls,&nbsp;containing from 25 to
                    35 yds.&nbsp;30 in. wide. The sheets should&nbsp;be laid with a lap of 2 in.
                    at&nbsp;the joints and secured to the&nbsp;boarding beneath by large-headed
                    clout-nails driven in&nbsp;about 2 in. apart.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">Corrugated iron is supplied either black or galvanized.
                    It&nbsp;is especially suited&nbsp;for the roofs of outbuildings and buildings of
                    a more or less&nbsp;temporary character. Being&nbsp;to a large extent
                    self-supporting, it requires a specially designed roof framework of
                    light&nbsp;construction. If, as is usually&nbsp;the case, the sheets are
                    laid&nbsp;with the corrugations running&nbsp;with the slope of the
                    root,&nbsp;they can be fixed directly on&nbsp;purlins spaced 5 ft. to 10
                    ft.&nbsp;apart according to the stiffness&nbsp;and length of the sheets.
