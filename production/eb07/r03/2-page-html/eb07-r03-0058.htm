<p><span class="font0">About this time an imperial ukase was published, granting to the Jews a complete emancipation from the shackles under which that devoted people had long groaned, and&nbsp;allowing them the privileges of educating their children in&nbsp;any of the schools and universities of the empire, or establishing schools at their own expense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For some time the genius of discord, which had again actuated the minds of the European sovereigns, failed to&nbsp;extend her baleful influence over the Russian empire ; but&nbsp;it was scarcely possible that the emperor should long remain an impartial spectator of the renewed disputes between his more powerful neighbours. An important change&nbsp;had, in the latter end of 1802, taken place in the ministry&nbsp;of the empire ; and Count Worontzoff, brother of the late&nbsp;ambassador at London, had been appointed great chan-cellor-in-chief of the department of foreign affairs, with&nbsp;Prince Adam Czartoryski for his assistant. How far this&nbsp;change in the councils of the empire influenced the political measures of the court of St Petersburg, it is not easy&nbsp;to determine ; but in the latter end of 1803, Alexander&nbsp;appeared to view with a jealous eye the presumption and&nbsp;violence exercised by France among the German states,&nbsp;and the encroachments which she appeared desirous of&nbsp;making on the freedom of the Baltic. Alexander had offered his mediation between Great Britain and France, but&nbsp;without effect ; and both these parties strove to bring over&nbsp;the Russian emperor to their alliance. France seems to&nbsp;have held out to the ambition of Alexander the bait of a&nbsp;partition of the Turkish territories, the dismemberment of&nbsp;which had long been a favourite object with his predecessors. At length, however, the court of London prevailed,&nbsp;and the Russian ambassador, by his master’s orders, took&nbsp;leave of the First Consul of the French republic, though&nbsp;without demonstrating any intentions of immediate hostility. A new levy of a hundred thousand men was immediately ordered, to recruit the Russian army ; and, to prevent&nbsp;any jealousy on the side of Turkey, assurances were given&nbsp;to the Sublime Porte of the amicable intentions of Russia&nbsp;towards that power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the Ilth of April 1805 a treaty of concert was concluded between Great Britain and Russia, in which the two governments agreed to adopt the most efficacious means&nbsp;for forming a general league of the states of Europe, to be&nbsp;directed against the power of France. From the terms of&nbsp;the treaty, its objects appear to have been, first, the evacuation of the country of Hanover and the north of Germany ; secondly, the establishment of the independence of&nbsp;the republics of Holland and Switzerland ; thirdly, the reestablishment of the king of Sardinia in Piedmont ; fourthly,&nbsp;the future security of the kingdom of Naples, and the complete evacuation of Italy, the island of Elba included, by&nbsp;the French forces ; fifthly, the establishment of an order of&nbsp;things in Europe, which might effectually guarantee the security and independence of the different states, and present&nbsp;a solid barrier against future usurpation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the prosecution of the great objects of this treaty, it was proposed by the first article that an army of five hundred thousand men should be levied ; but in a subsequent&nbsp;separate article, the contracting parties, after observing that&nbsp;it was more desirable than easy to assemble so large a&nbsp;force, agreed that the treaty should be carried into execution as soon as it should be possible to oppose to France&nbsp;an active force of four hundred thousand men. It was understood and stipulated that these troops should be provided&nbsp;by the powers of the continent who should become parties&nbsp;to the league, and subsidies should be granted by Great&nbsp;Britain in the proportion of L.l,250,000 sterling for every&nbsp;hundred thousand men, besides a considerable additional&nbsp;sum for the necessary expense occasioned in bringing them&nbsp;into the field.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About this time the occupation of Genoa by the French, on the pretence that that republic was too feeble to support itself against the attacks of Great Britain, was com-municated to the different courts of Europe, and excited in '&nbsp;every quarter the highest indignation. The Emperor Alexander, in particular, was incensed at this new outrage. Such&nbsp;an open violation of those principles which were justly regarded as essential to the general safety, committed not&nbsp;only during the peace of the continent, but when passports&nbsp;had been delivered to his ambassador, in order that a negotiation might be commenced for the purpose of providing for the permanent security and repose of Europe, he&nbsp;considered as an indecent insult to his person and crown.&nbsp;He issued immediate orders for the recall of M. Novosilt-zoff ; and the messenger despatbhed upon this occasion was&nbsp;commanded to repair with the utmost diligence to Berlin.&nbsp;M. Novosiltzoff had not yet left that city ; he immediately&nbsp;therefore returned his passports to the Prussian minister of&nbsp;state, Baron de Hardenberg, and at the same time delivered, by order of his court, a spirited memorial explanatory&nbsp;of the object of his mission, and of the circumstances which&nbsp;had led to its termination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The recall of the Russian envoy appeared to be the signal of hostilities on the part of Russia and Austria against France. These hostilities may be said to have commenced&nbsp;and terminated in the autumn of this year. The military&nbsp;operations that distinguished this short but bloody conflict,&nbsp;the rapid successes of the French, the capitulation of Ulm&nbsp;on the 17th of October, the occupation of Vienna by the&nbsp;French on the 12th of the same month, and the sanguinary&nbsp;battle of Austerlitz on the 27th of November, have been&nbsp;already noticed under the head of France. The consequences of these disastrous events were, first a cessation of&nbsp;hostilities, and at length a treaty of firm alliance between&nbsp;France and Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But before Alexander finally stooped to the imperial eagles of Napoleon, he was determined to make one more effort to preserve his independence. The Russian envoy at Paris, DOubril, had hastily concluded a preliminary treaty&nbsp;of peace between his master and the emperor of the French,&nbsp;which he signed at Paris on the 8th of July 1806, and instantly set out for St Petersburg to procure the ratification&nbsp;of his master. When the terms of this convention were&nbsp;laid before the privy council by Alexander, they appeared&nbsp;so derogatory to the interests of Russia, that the emperor&nbsp;refused them his sanction, and declared that the counsellor&nbsp;of state, DOubril, when he signed the convention, had not&nbsp;only departed from the instructions he had received, but&nbsp;had acted directly contrary to the sense and intention of&nbsp;the commission with which he had been intrusted. His&nbsp;imperial majesty, however, signified his willingness to renew&nbsp;the negotiations for peace, but only on such terms as were&nbsp;consistent with the dignity of his crown and the interests&nbsp;of his empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time the king of Prussia began, when it n<sup>τ</sup>as too late, to see the folly and imprudence of the neutrality&nbsp;which he had so long maintained, and he at length prepared to oppose his now feeble efforts to the growing power of&nbsp;France. He brought together in the summer of this year an&nbsp;army of at least two hundred thousand men, near Weimar&nbsp;and Jena, while the French myriads assembled in Franconia&nbsp;and on the frontiers of Saxony. Previously to the commencement of hostilities, his Prussian majesty issued a spirited manifesto, in which he explained his motives for abandoning his plan of neutrality, and appealed to Europe for the&nbsp;justice of his cause. He entered into an alliance with the&nbsp;Emperor Alexander, and with the king of Sweden ; and it&nbsp;was expected that these united forces would at length hurl&nbsp;the tyrant of Europe from his throne, or at least compel him&nbsp;to listen to equitable terms of pacification. These expectations were, however, miserably disappointed. The same&nbsp;extraordinary success was still to attend the arms of France,</span></p>
