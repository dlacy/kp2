or <hi rend="smallcaps">Solifuga,</hi> in natural hiſtory, the name given by the Romans to a ſmall venomous infect of the ſpider-kind, called by the Greeks <hi rend="italic">heliocentros ;</hi> both words ſignifying an animal which ſtings moſt in the country, and ſeaſons where the ſun is moſt hot. Solinus makes this creature peculiar to Sardinia ; but this is contrary to all the accounts given us by the ancients. It is common in Africa and ſome parts of Europe. Almoſt all the hot countries produce this venomous little creature. It lies under the sand to ſeize other insects as they go by ; and if it meet with any uncovered part of a man, produces a wound which proves very painful: it is ſaid that the bite is abſolutely mortal, but probably this is not true. Solinus writes the word <hi rend="italic">ſolifuga,</hi> and ſo do many others, erroneouſly deriving the name from the notion that this animal flies from the ſun’s rays, and buries itſelf in the fand.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
