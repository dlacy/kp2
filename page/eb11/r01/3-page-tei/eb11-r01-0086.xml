It is adapted for light, high-speed service, and noted for its simplicity, excellent riding qualities, low cost of maintenance, and high mechanical efficiency; but having limited adhesive weight it is unsuitable for starting and accelerating heavy trains.</p><p>(2)    “ Four-coupled ” type, 4-4-0, with leading bogie truck. For many years this was practically the only one used in America for all traffic, and it is often spoken of as the “ American ” type. In America it is still the standard engine for passenger traffic, but for goods service it is now employed only on branch lines. It has been extensively introduced, both in Great Britain and the continent of Europe, for passenger traffic, and is now the most numerous and popular class. lt is a safe, steady-running and trustworthy engine, with excellent distribution of weight, and it is susceptible of a wide range of adaptability in power requirements.</p><p>(3)    “ Four-coupled ” three-axle type, 2-4-0. Used to some extent in France and Germany and considerably in England for passenger traffic of moderate weight. Engines of this class, with 78-înch driving wheels and the leading axle fitted with Webb’s radial axle-box, for many years did excellent work on the London &amp; North-Western railway. The famous engine “ Charles Dickens ” was one of this class. Built in 1882, it had by the 12th of September 1891 performed the feat of running a million miles in 9 years 219 days, and it completed two million miles on the 5th of August 1902, having by that date run 5312 trips with express trains between London and Manchester.</p><p>(4)    “ Four-coupled ” three-axle type, with trailing axle, 0-4-2. Used on several English lines for fast passenger traffic, and also on many European railways. The advantages claimed for it arc: short coupling-rods, large and unlimited fire-box carried by a trailing axle, compactness, and great power for a given weight. Its critics, however, accuse it of lack of stability, and assert that the use of large leading wheels as drivers results in rigidity and produces destructive strains on the machinery and permanent way.</p><p>(5)    “ Four-coupled ” type, with a leading bogie truck and a trailing axle, 4-4-2. It is used to a limited extent both in England and on the continent of Europe, and is rapidly increasing in favour in the United States, where it originated and is known as the “ Atlantic ” type. It has many advantages for heavy high-speed service, namely, large and well-proportioned boiler, practically unlimited grate area, fire-box of favourable proportions for firing, fairly, low centre of gravity, short coupling-rods, and, finally, a combination of the safe and smooth riding qualities of the four-coupled bogie type, with great steaming capacity and moderate axle loads. Occasionally a somewhat similar type is designed with the bogie under the fire-box and a single leading axle forward under the smoke-box—an arrangement in favour for suburban tank engines. In still rarer cases both a leading and a trailing bogie have been fitted.</p><p>(6)    “ Six-coupled ” with bogie, or “ Ten-wheel ” type, 4-6-0. A powerful engine for heavy passenger and fast goods service. It is used to a limited extent both in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe, but is much more common in America. The design combines ample boiler capacity with large adhesive weight and moderate axle loads, but except on heavy gradients or for unusually large trains requiring engines of great adhesion, passenger traffic can be more efficiently and economically handled by four-coupled locomotives of the eight-wheel or Atlantic types.</p><p>(7)    “ Six-coupled ” total-adhesion type (all the weight carried on the drivers), 0-6-0. This is the standard goods engine of Great Britain and the continent of Europe. In America the type is used only for shunting. It is a simple design of moderate boiler power.</p><p>(8)    “ Six-coupled ” type, with a leading axle, 2-6-0. This is of American origin, and is there known as the “ Mogul. ” It is used largely in America for goods traffic. In Europe it is in considerable favour for goods and passenger traffic on heavy gradients. The type is, however, less in favour than either the ten-wheel or the eight-coupled “ Consolidation ” for freight traffic.</p><p>(9)    “ Eight-coupled " total-adhesion type, 0-8-0; now found on a good many English railways, and common on the continent of Europe for heavy slow goods traffic. In America it is comparatively infrequent, as total-adhesion types are not in favour.</p><p>(10)    “ Eight-coupled ” type, with a leading axle, 2-8-0. This originated in America, where it is termed the “Consolidation. ” In the United States it is the standard heavy slow-speed freight engine, and has been built of enormous size and weight. The type has been introduced in Europe, especially in Germany, where the advantages of a partial-adhesion type in increased stability and a larger boiler are becoming appreciated. Occasionally the American eight-coupled type has a bogie instead of a single leading axle (4-8-0), and is then termed a “ Twelve-wheeler, ” or “ Mastodon. ”</p><p>(11)    “Ten-coupled” type, with a leading axle, 2-10-0. This originated in America, where it is known as the “ Decapod. ” It is used to a limited extent for mountain-grade goods traffic, and has the advantage over the “ Consolidation” or eight-coupled type of lighter axle loads for a given tractive capacity.</p><p>In addition to the foregoing list, various special locomotive types have been developed for suburban service, where high rates of acceleration and frequent stops are required. These are generally tank engines, carrying their fuel and water on the engine proper.</p><p>Their boilers are of relatively large proportions for the train weight and average speed, and the driving wheels of small diameter, a large proportion of their total weight being “ adhesive. ” Other special types are in limited use for “ rack-railways, ” and operate either by engagement of gearing on the locomotive into a rack between the track rails, or by a combination of this and rail adhesion.</p><p>§ 20. <hi rend="italic">Current Developments. —</hi>The demand of the present day is for engines of larger power both for passenger and goods service, and the problem is to design such engines within the limitations fixed by the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge and the dimensions of the existing tunnels, arches, and other permanent works. The American engineer is more fortunately situated than his English brother with regard to the possibility of a solution, as will be seen from the comparative diagrams of construction gauges, figs. 23, 24, 25, 26. Fig. 23 shows the construction gauge for the London &amp; North-Western railway, fig. 24 that for the Great Western@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  railway, fig. 25 that for the Great Eastern railway, whilst fig. 26 gives a general idea of the American gauge in a particular case, generally typical, however, of the American limits. In consequence of this increasing demand for power, higher boiler pressures are being used, in some cases 225 ℔ per sq. in, for a simple two-cylinder engine, and cylinder volume is slightly increased with the necessary accompaniment of heavier loads on the coupled wheels to give the necessary adhesion. Both load and speed have increased so much in connexion with passenger trains that it is necessary to divide the weight required for adhesion between three-coupled axles, and the type of engine gradually coming into use in England for heavy express traffic is a six-coupled engine with a leading bogie, with wheels which would have been considered small a few years ago for the speed at which the engine runs. The same remarks apply to goods engines. There is a general increase in cylinder power, boiler pressure and weight, and in consequence in the number of coupled axles. Not only are the load and speed increasing, but the distances run without a stop are increasing also, and to avoid increasing the size of the tenders, water-troughs, first instituted by J. Ramsbottom on the London &amp; North-Western railway in 1859, have been laid in the tracks of the leading main lines of Great Britain. For local services where stoppages are frequent the demand is for engines capable of quickly</p><p>@@@At the beginning of 1908 the Great Western’s loading gauge on its main lines was widened to 9 ft. 8'in. from a height of 5 ft. above rail level.</p></body></text></TEI>
