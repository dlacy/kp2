in the civil law, the act of ſtipulating, that is, of treating and concluding terms und conditions to be inſerted in a contract. Stipulations were anciently performed at Rome, with abundance of ceremonies ; the first whereof was, that one party ſhould interrogate, and the other anſwer, to give his consent, and oblige himſelf. By the ancient Roman law, nobody couid stipulate but for himſelf ; but as the Tabelliones were public ſervants, they were allowed to stipulate for their maſters ; and the notaries ſucceeding the Tabelliones have inherited the ſame privilege.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
