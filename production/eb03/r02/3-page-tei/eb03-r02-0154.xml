Ç. Caius Gracchus, brother to him who had been formerly killed, not only undertook the revival of the Sempronian law, but propoſed anew one, granting the rights of Roman citizens to all the Italian allies, who could receive no ſhare of the lands divided in conſequence of the Sempronian law. The conſequences of this were much worſe than the former ; the flame ſpread through all Italy ; and the nations who had made war with the republic in its infancy again commenced enemies more formidable than before. Fregellæ, a city of the Volſci, revolted : but being ſuddenly attacked, was obliged to ſubmit, and was raſed to the ground ; which quieted matters for the preſent. Gracchus, however, ſtill continued his attempts to humble the ſenate and the reſt of the patrician body : the ultimate conſequence of which was, that a price was ſet on his head, and that of Fulvius his confederate, no leſs than their weight in gold, to any one who ſhould bring them to Opimius the chief of the patrician party. Thus the cuſtom of proſcription was begun by the patricians, of which they themſelves ſoon had enough. Gracchus and Fulvius were ſacrificed, but the diſorders of the republic were not ſo eaſily cured.</p><p>The inundation of the Cimbri and Teutones put a ſtop to the civil diſcords for ſome time longer ; but they being defeated, as related under the articles Ci με tu and Teutones, nothing prevented the troubles from being revived with greater fury than before, except the war with tl⅜e Sicilian ſlaves, which had again commenced with more dangerous circumſtances than ever. But this war being totally ended about 99 B. C. no farther obſtacle remained. Marius, the conqueror of Jugurtha * and the Cimbri, undertook the cauſe of the plebeians againſt the ſenate and patricians. Having aſſociated himſelf with Apuleius and Glaucia, two factious men, they caιτied their proceedings to ſuch a length, that an open rebellion commenced, and Marius himſelf was obliged to act againſt his allies. Peace* however, was for the preſent reſtored by the maſſacre of Apuleius and Glaucia, with a great number of their followers ; upon which Marius thought proper to leave the city.</p><p>While factious men thus endeavoured to tear the republic in pieces, the attempts of well-meaning people to heal thoſe diviſions ſerved only to involve the ſtate in calamities ſtill more grievous. The conſuls obſerved, that many individuals of the Italian allies lived at Rome, and falſely pretended to be Roman citizens. By means of them, it was likewiſe perceived, that the plebeian party had acquired a great deal of its power ; as the votes of theſe pretended citizens were always at the ſervice of the tribunes. The conſuls therefore got a law paſſed, commanding all thoſe pretended citizens to return home. This was ſo much reſented by the Italian ſtates, that an univerſal defection took place. A ſeheme was then formed by M. Livius Druſus, a tribune of the people, to reconcile all orders of men ; but this only made matters worſe, and procured his own aſ-ſaſſination. His death ſeemed a ſignal for war. The Marſi, Peligni, Samnites, Campanians, and Luea-nians, and in ſhort all the provinces from the river Li-ris to the Adriatic, revolted at once, and formed themſelves into a republic, in oppoſition to that of Rome.</p><p>The haughty Romans were now made thoroughly ſenſible that they were not invincible : they were defeated in almoſt every engagement ; and muſt ſoon have yielded, bad they pot fallen upon a method of dividing their enemies. A law was paſſed, enacting, that all the nations in Italy, whoſe alliance with Rome was indiſputable, ſhould enjoy the right of Roman citizens. This drew off ſeveral nations from the alliance ; and at the ſame time, Sylla taking upon him the command of the Roman armies, fortune ſoon declared in favour of the latter.</p><p>The ſucceſs of Rome againſt the allies ſerved only to bring greater miſeries upon herſelf. Marius and Sylla became rivals ; the former adhering to the people, and the'latter to the patricians. Marius aſſociated with one ot the tribunes named <hi rend="italic">Sulpitius ;</hi>  in conjunction with whom he raiſed ſuch diſturbances, that Sylla was forced to retire ſrom the city. Having thus driven off his rival, Marius got himſelf appointed, general againſt Mithridates f king of Pontus ; but the ſoldiers reſuſed to obey any other than Sylla. A civil war immediately enſued, in which Marius was driven out in his turn, find a price ſet upon his head and that of Sulpitius, with many of their adherents. Sulpitius was ſoon ſeized and killed ; but Marius made his eſcape. In the mean time, however, the cruelties of Sylla rendered him obnoxious both to the ſenate and people ; and Cin-na, a furious partiſan of the Marian faction, being choſen conſul, cited him to give an account of his conduct. Upon this Sylla thought proper to ſet out ſor Aſia : Marius was recalled from Africa, whither he had fled ; and immediately on his landing in Italy, was joined by a great number of ſhepherds, ſlaves, and men of deſperate fortunes ; ſo that he ſoon ſaw himſelf at the head of a conſiderable army.</p><p>Cinna, in the mean time, whom the ſenators had depoſed and driven out of Rome, ſolicited and obtained a powerful army from the allies ; and being joined by Sertorius, a moſt able and experienced general, the two, in conjunction with Marius, advanced towards the capital ; and as their forces daily increaſed, a fourth army was formed under the command of Papirius Carbo. The ſenate raiſed ſome forces to defend the city ; but the troops being vaſtly inferior in number, and likewiſe inclined to the contrary ſide, they were obliged to open their gates to the confederates. Marius entered at the head of a numerous guard, compoſed of ſlaves, whom he called his <hi rend="italic">Barcliceans,</hi>  and whom he deſigned to employ in revenging himſelf on his enemies. The firſt order he gave theſe aſſaſſins was, to murder all who came to ſalute him, and were not anſwered with the like civility. As every one was forward to pay his compliments to the new tyrant, this order proved the deſtruction of vaſt numbers. At laſt theſe Bardiæans abandoned themſelves to ſuch exccſſes in every kind of vice, that Cinna and 3ettorius ordered their troops to fall upon them ; which being inſtantly put in execution, they were all cut off to a man.</p><p>By the deſtruction of his guards, Marius was reduced to the neceſſity of taking a method of gratifying his revenge ſomewhat more tedious, though equally effectual. A conference was held between the four chiefs, in which Marius ſeemed quite frantic with rage. Sertorius endeavoured to moderate his fury ; but, besag</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
