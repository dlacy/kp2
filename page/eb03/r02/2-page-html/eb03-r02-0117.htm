<p><span class="font0">and though they were diſtinguiſhed from the plebeians by their old name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hberti,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſreedmen,</span><span class="font0"> yet they enjoyed all the privileges of free citizens. The ſenate&nbsp;took offence at the regard which the king ſhowed to&nbsp;fιιch mean people, who had but lately ſhaken off their&nbsp;fetters ; but Servius, by a moſt humane and judicious&nbsp;diſcourſe, entirely appeaſed the fathers, rvho paſſed his&nbsp;inſtitution into </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">law, which ſubliſted ever after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The wiſe king, having thus eſtabliſhed order among the people, undertook at laſt to reform the royal power&nbsp;itſelf ; his equity, which was the main ſpring of all his&nbsp;reſolutions, leading him to act contrary to his own intereſt, and to ſacriſice one half of the royal authority&nbsp;to the public good. His predeceſſors had reſerved to&nbsp;themſelves the cognizance of all cauſes both public and&nbsp;private ; but Servius, finding the duties of his office&nbsp;too much for one man to diſcharge well, committed the&nbsp;cognizance of ordinary ſuits to the ſenate, and reſerved&nbsp;that only of ſtate-crimes to himſelf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All things being now regulated at home, both in the city and country, Servius turned his thoughts abroad,&nbsp;and formed a ſeheme for attaching the Sabines and Latins to the Romans, by ſuch ſocial ties as ſhould be&nbsp;ſtrengthened by religion. He ſummoned the Latin&nbsp;and Sabine cities to ſend their deputies to Rome, to&nbsp;conſult about an affair of great importance. When&nbsp;they were come, he propoſed to them the building of a&nbsp;temple in honour of Diana, where the Latins and Sabines ſhould meet once a year, and join with the Romans in offering ſacrifices to that goddeſs ; that this&nbsp;feſtival ſhould be followed by a council, in which all&nbsp;diſputes between the cities ſhould be amicably determined ; that there proper meaſures ſhould be taken to&nbsp;purſue their common intereſt ; and, laſtly, in order to&nbsp;draw the common people thither, a fair ſhould be kept,&nbsp;at which every one might furniſh himſelf with what he&nbsp;wanted. The king’s deſign met with no oppoſition :&nbsp;the deputies only added to it, that the temple ſhould&nbsp;be an inviolable aſylum ſor the united nations ; and&nbsp;that all the cities ſhould contribute toward the expence&nbsp;of building it. It being left to the king to chooſe a&nbsp;proper place for it, he pitched upon the Aventine hill,&nbsp;where the temple was built, and aſſemblies annually&nbsp;held in it. The laws which were to be obſerved in&nbsp;theſe general meetings were engraved on a pillar of&nbsp;braſs, and were to be ſeen in Auguſtus’3 time, in the&nbsp;Latin tongue, but in Greek characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But now Servius was grown old ; and the ambition of Tarquin his ſon-in-law revived in proportion as the&nbsp;king advanced in years. His wife uſed her utmoſt endeavours to check the raſhneſs and fury of her huſhand,&nbsp;and to divert him from all criminal enterpriſes ; while&nbsp;her younger filter was ever inſtigating Arunx, who&nbsp;placed all his happineſs in a private life, to the moſt&nbsp;villanous attempts. She was continually lamenting her&nbsp;fate in being tied to inch an indolent huſhand, and&nbsp;wiſhing ſhe had either continued unmarried, or were&nbsp;become a widow. Similitude of temper and manners,&nbsp;formed, by degrees, a great intimacy between her and&nbsp;Tarquin. At length ſhe propoſed nothing leſs to him&nbsp;than the murdering of her father, ſiſter, and huſhand,&nbsp;that they two might meet and aſcend the throne together. Soon after, they paved their way to an ince-ſtuous marriage, he by poiſoning his wife, and ſhe her</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h4><span class="font1">huſhand ; and then had the aſſurance to aik the king’s</span></h4></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">and queen’s confent to their marriage. Servius arid Tarquinia, though they did not give it, were filent,&nbsp;through too much indulgence to a daughter in whom&nbsp;now was their only hope of poſterity. But theſe criminal nuptials were only the firſt ſtep towards a yet&nbsp;greater iniquity. The wicked ambition of the new-married couple firſt ſhowed itſelf againſt the king : for&nbsp;they publicly declared, that the crown belonged to&nbsp;them ; that Servius was an ufurpcr, who, being appointed tutor to Tarquin’s grandchildren, had deprived&nbsp;his pupils of their inheritance ; that it was high time&nbsp;for an old man, who was but little able to ſupport the '&nbsp;weight of public affairs, to give place to a prince who&nbsp;was of a mature age, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The patricians, whom Servius had takert great pleaſure in humbling during the whole time of his reign, were eaſily gained over to Tarquin’s party ; and, by&nbsp;the help of money, many of the poorer citizens were&nbsp;alſo brought over to his intereſt. The king, being informed of their treafonable practices, endeavoured to&nbsp;diſſuade his daughter and ſon-indaw from ſuch proceedings, which might end in their ruin ; and exhorted&nbsp;them to wait for the kingdom till his death. But they,&nbsp;deſpiſing his counſels and paternal admonitions, reſolved to lay their claim before the ſenate ; which Servius&nbsp;was obliged to ſummon : ſo that the affair came to a&nbsp;formal proceſs. Tarquin reproached his father-in-law&nbsp;with having aſcended the throne without a previous interregnum ; and with having bought the votes of the&nbsp;people, and deſpiſed the ſuffrages of the ſenate. He&nbsp;then urged his own right of inheritance to the crown,&nbsp;and injuſtice of Servius, who, being only his guardian,&nbsp;had kept poiſeſſion of it, when he himſelf was of an&nbsp;age to govern. Servius anſwered, that he had been&nbsp;lawfully elected by the people ; and that, if there&nbsp;could be an hereditary right to the kingdom, the ſons&nbsp;of Ancus had a much better one than the grandſons of&nbsp;the late king, who muſt himſelf have been an uſurper.&nbsp;He then referred the whole to an aſſembly of the people ; which being immediately proclaimed all over the&nbsp;city, the forum was ſoon filled ; and Servius harangued&nbsp;the multitude in ſuch a manner as gained all their affections. They all cried out with one voice, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Let Servius&nbsp;reign ; let him continue to make the Romans happy.</span><span class="font0"> A-midſt their confuſed clamours, theſe words were likewiſe heard : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Let Tarquin periſh ; let him die; let us kill&nbsp;him.</span><span class="font0"> This language frightened him ſo, that he retired&nbsp;to his houſe in great haſte ; while the king was conducted back to his palace with the acclamations of the&nbsp;people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ill ſucceſs of this attempt cooled Tarquin’s ardent deſire of reigning ; but his ambition made him act a new part. He undertook to regain the favour of his&nbsp;father-in-law by careſſes, ſubmiſſions, and proteſtations&nbsp;of a ſincere regard and affection for him ; inſomuch&nbsp;that the king, who judged of the policy of others from&nbsp;his own, was ſincerely reconciled to him, and tranquillity re-eſtabliſhed in the royal family. But it was not&nbsp;long ere Tarquin, rouſed hy the continual reproaches&nbsp;of his wife, began to renew his intrigues among the&nbsp;ſenators ; of whom he had no ſooner gained a conſider-able party, than he clothed himſelf in the royal robes,&nbsp;and cauſing the faſees to be carried before him by ſome&nbsp;of his domeſtics, croſſed the Roman forum, entered the&nbsp;temple where the ſenate uſed to meet, and ſeated him-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
