<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">by the emperor Maximilian I. took place, with the object of re-establishing the imperial supremacy in Italy,—an&nbsp;expedition which was in some respects the counterpart of&nbsp;that of Charles, and to which Julius II. opposed a vacillating policy not unlike that of his predecessor. To the&nbsp;expedition of Maximilian succeeded the league of Cambray,&nbsp;designed to humble the republic of Venice, and warmly&nbsp;supported by Julius II. as a means whereby to gratify his&nbsp;resentment at the resistance offered by that powerful state&nbsp;to the encroachments of the popedom. No sooner was&nbsp;Venice sufficiently humiliated than Julius proceeded to&nbsp;concert measures for carrying out the great object of his&nbsp;ambition,—the expulsion of the foreigner from Italy.&nbsp;Never before had the aims of the papacy seemed so&nbsp;completely in conflict with those of every European&nbsp;power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In France, Louis XII., on appealing to the representatives of the Gallican Church (council of Tours, September 1510), soon found that national feeling entirely prevailed&nbsp;over Ultramontane sympathies, and that he might count&nbsp;on their effectual support. Notwithstanding, therefore, the&nbsp;remonstrances of his devout consort, Anne of Brittany,&nbsp;he resolved upon a vigorous anti-papal policy. In concert&nbsp;with the emperor Maximilian, he revived the long-dormant&nbsp;demand for a general council; and a mimic assembly,&nbsp;consisting of four cardinals, twenty Gallican prelates, certain abbots and other dignitaries, was actually convened&nbsp;at Pisa in 1511. In this extremity Julius exhibited his&nbsp;usual fertility of resource by organizing the Holy League,&nbsp;and thus inducing Ferdinand of Aragon and the Venetians&nbsp;to combine with him in opposing the designs of schismatic&nbsp;France. The council, transferred to Milan, issued from&nbsp;thence in April 1512 an edict suspending Julius from all&nbsp;pontifical functions as a “ notorious disturber of the&nbsp;council, the author of schism, contumacious, incorrigible,&nbsp;hardened ” (Raynaldus, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sub ann.).</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The pontiff thereupon&nbsp;excommunicated Louis XII., who rejoined by a formal&nbsp;protest and by causing coins to be struck and circulated&nbsp;bearing the arms of France and the ominous inscription&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perdam Babylonis nomen.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> In the meantime the fifth&nbsp;Lateran council, the rival council convened by Julius,&nbsp;commenced its sittings (May 1512), and forthwith declared the acts of the assembly held at Milan to be those&nbsp;of a schismatical body, while it proceeded to confirm the&nbsp;papal censure on the king of France. The expulsion of&nbsp;the French from Italy, after the fall of their heroic leader,&nbsp;Gaston de Foix, seemed to threaten only a further widening&nbsp;of the schism, when the death of Julius in 1513 opened the&nbsp;door for negotiation—an opportunity of which Louis eagerly&nbsp;availed himself—while the pliant disposition of the new&nbsp;pontiff, Leo X. (1513-1521), afforded additional facilities&nbsp;for arriving at an agreement. The French monarch now&nbsp;disavowed the proceedings of the council which he had&nbsp;before supported, and acknowledged the validity of the&nbsp;acts of the council at the Lateran. Other points were still&nbsp;under discussion when Louis died and was succeeded by&nbsp;Francis I., January 1515.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the following year the Catholic king Ferdinand of Aragon died. The relations of Spain to the papacy during&nbsp;. his reign and before that time had been very far from&nbsp;representing a policy of complete subserviency. By a&nbsp;concordat made in the year 1482 Pope Sixtus IV. had&nbsp;conceded to the sovereigns of Castile and Aragon the right&nbsp;of nominating to the higher ecclesiastical offices, although&nbsp;he had reserved to himself a corresponding power in connexion with the inferior benefices,—a privilege which soon&nbsp;resulted in the customary abuses and rendered the papal&nbsp;supremacy for a time scarcely more popular in Spain than&nbsp;in Germany. At nearly the same time the institution of&nbsp;the Inquisition in the former country is generally supposed&nbsp;to have first taken place (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Inquisition),</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—an event&nbsp;which must not, however, be construed into a proof of the&nbsp;ascendency of papal influence. In its earlier stage the&nbsp;Inquisition was quite as much a civil as an ecclesiastical&nbsp;tribunal, being especially directed against the exclusive&nbsp;privileges and immunities claimed by the hereditary&nbsp;nobility; and, although under Cardinal Ximenes the repression of heresy became one of its chief functions, it&nbsp;was long regarded with no friendly feelings by Rome.&nbsp;The Roman doctrine and discipline were rigorously imposed on the Spanish population, but Ferdinand himself&nbsp;showed little disposition to submit to the dictation of&nbsp;the Roman pontiff. In the year 1508 he sharply rebuked&nbsp;his viceroy, the count of Rivarzoga, for allowing a papal&nbsp;bull to be promulgated in the provinces without having&nbsp;previously obtained his sanction, and declared that if the&nbsp;bull were not forthwith withdrawn he would withdraw&nbsp;the two crowns from the obedience of the holy see.&nbsp;Five years later Cardinal Xinienes, in a like spirit, openly&nbsp;denounced the abuses that accompanied the traffic in&nbsp;indulgences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The tone that Germany at this period w<sup>r</sup>as able to! assume was very different. The several states and princi- *&nbsp;palities, feebly protected by the imperial authority, which <sup>1&nbsp;</sup>could no longer be asserted as of yore, yielded an easy&nbsp;prey to the extortion of the papal emissaries. The national&nbsp;clergy, perhaps more corrupt than in any other Teutonic&nbsp;country, showed themselves completely subservient to the&nbsp;worst malpractices of Rome. It was from the laity at&nbsp;large that the first warning came that either reform or&nbsp;revolution must before long ensue. In the year 1511&nbsp;a notable document, purporting to emanate from the&nbsp;German people at large, was laid before the emperor.&nbsp;Drawn up in the form of a petition, it enumerated and&nbsp;described the various abuses associated with the prevailing&nbsp;ecclesiastical practice and suggested the remedies. Foremost among the specified grievances it placed the utter&nbsp;want of good faith shown by successive pontiffs in the&nbsp;manner in which they were accustomed altogether to disregard (often at the instance of most unworthy favourites)&nbsp;the privileges and immunities solemnly granted by their&nbsp;predecessors. It complained of the frequent nullifying of&nbsp;the elections of prelates canonically elected by their respective chapters, of a like disregard for such elections even&nbsp;in cases where large sums had been paid to the Curia by&nbsp;the chapters in order to secure the ratification of their&nbsp;choice, of the manner in which all the richest benefices&nbsp;were reserved for cardinals and proto-notaries, of the frequent anticipation of reversions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(expectativse gratise</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">) and&nbsp;of the concentration of numerous benefices in the hands&nbsp;of single individuals, of the incessant lawsuits generated&nbsp;by these malpractices and the consequent waste of considerable sums both on the lawsuits themselves and on&nbsp;the obtaining of bulls which eventually proved inoperative,&nbsp;—“so that,” said the petitioners, “it has become a common&nbsp;saying that, on obtaining a reversion from Rome, one&nbsp;ought to lay by one or two hundred gold pieces wherewith to defend the actions to which the maintenance of&nbsp;one’s rights will infallibly give rise.” Other matters of&nbsp;complaint were the frequency with which annates were&nbsp;demanded; the bestowal of livings on those utterly incompetent for the discharge of their duties,—“ fitter,” in&nbsp;fact, “to be muleteers than to be the instructors of their&nbsp;fellow-men”; the frequent issuing of new indulgences and&nbsp;revocation of the old, notwithstanding the repeated remonstrances of the laity; the levying of tenths under pretext of an expedition against the Turks when no such&nbsp;expedition was designed ; and the petition closed with the&nbsp;complaint, which had been rife almost ever since the days&nbsp;of Hilary of Arles, of the continual summoning of suits</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
