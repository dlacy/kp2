<p><span class="font0">quire into the truth of the charges brought against it by the historian of New Spain ; and this he appears to have done&nbsp;with a becoming attention to the importance of the facts&nbsp;that are controverted, and to the common interests of truth.&nbsp;The result he published in 1788, under the title of “ Additions and Corrections to the former Editions of Dr Robertson’s History of America.” In many of the disputed&nbsp;passages, he fully answered Clavigero and vindicated himself ; in others he candidly submitted to correction, and thus&nbsp;gave additional value to his own work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The literary labours of Dr Robertson appear to have been terminated in 1791, by the publication of “ An Historical&nbsp;Disquisition concerning the Knowledge which the Ancients&nbsp;had of India, and the Progress of Trade with that country&nbsp;prior to the Discovery of the Passage to it by the Cape of&nbsp;Good Hope ; with an Appendix, containing Observations&nbsp;on the Civil Polity, the Laws, and Judicial Proceedings,&nbsp;the Arts, the Sciences, and Religious Institutions of tbe&nbsp;Indians.” The perusal of Major Rennell’s Memoir, for illustrating his map of Hindustan, suggested to Robertson&nbsp;the design of examining more fully than he had done in&nbsp;his History of America, into the knowledge which the ancients had of India, and of considering what is certain, what&nbsp;is obscure, and what is fabulous, in their accounts of that&nbsp;remote country. Of his various performances, this is not&nbsp;that of which the design is the most extensive, or the execution the most elaborate ; but in his historical disquisition&nbsp;we perceive the same patient assiduity in collecting his&nbsp;materials, the same discernment in arranging them, the&nbsp;same perspicuity of narrative, and the same power of illustration, which so eminently distinguish his other writings,&nbsp;and which have long rendered them the delight of the British reader at home, and an honour to British literature&nbsp;abroad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His truly useful life was closed on the 11th of June 1793, at Grange-House near Edinburgh, after a lingering&nbsp;illness, which be endured with exemplary fortitude and resignation. He had attained the age of seventy-two. It&nbsp;may be justly observed of him, that no man lived more respected, or died more sincerely lamented. Indefatigable in&nbsp;his literary researches, and possessing from nature a sound&nbsp;and vigorous understanding, he acquired a store of useful&nbsp;knowdedge, which afforded ample scope for the exertion of&nbsp;his extraordinary abilities, and raised him to the most distinguished eminence in the republic of letters. As a minister of the gospel, he was a faithful pastor, and justly merited&nbsp;the esteem and veneration of his flock. In a word, he may&nbsp;be pronounced to be one of the most perfect characters of&nbsp;the age ; and his name will be a lasting honour to the island&nbsp;that gave him birth. His conversation was cheerful, entertaining, and instructive ; his manners affable, pleasing, and&nbsp;endearing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The account of his Life and Writings, published by Mr Dugald Stewart, is one of the noblest pieces of biography&nbsp;that any language can boast of. It was published in a separate form, and likewise accompanies the later editions of&nbsp;his works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dr Robertson left a widow and a numerous family in prosperous circumstances. In 1751 he had married Mary&nbsp;the daughter of Mr Nisbet, one of the ministers of Edinburgh, and this domestic union had been productive of&nbsp;much happiness. His eldest son, the late Lord Robertson,&nbsp;was for many years a judge of the Court of Session. Two&nbsp;of his sons belonged to the military profession. His eldest&nbsp;daughter was the wife of Mr Brydone the celebrated traveller, and the mother of the present Countess of Minto.&nbsp;Another daughter married John Russell, Esq. writer to the&nbsp;signet. Lord Brougham is the grandson of Dr Robertson’s&nbsp;sister.</span></p>

It is observed by&nbsp;the Abbé Gallois, that the method of transforming figures&nbsp;which is explained at the end of RobervaΓs treatise of Indivisibles, was the same with that afterwards published by&nbsp;James Gregory in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geometria Universalis,</span><span class="font0"> and also by&nbsp;Dr Barrow in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lectiones Geornetricœ ;</span><span class="font0"> and that it appears&nbsp;from Torricelli’s letter, that Roberval was the inventor of&nbsp;this method of transforming figures, by means of certain&nbsp;lines called by Torricelli, for that reason, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rοbervallian lines.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The same author adds, that J. Gregory probably first learned this method at Padua in the year 1668 ; for the method&nbsp;was known in Italy in 1646, although the book was not published till 1692. David Gregory endeavoured to refute this&nbsp;account, in vindication of bis uncle James. His answer&nbsp;appeared in the Philosophical Transactions for 1694, and&nbsp;Gallois rejoined in the Memoirs of the French Academy&nbsp;for 1703 ; so that it remains in a state of uncertainty to&nbsp;which of the two we are to ascribe the invention.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROBINS, Benjamin, an ingenious mathematician, was born at Bath in 1707. His parents were Quakers of low&nbsp;condition, and consequently were unable to have him much&nbsp;instructed in human learning ; but his own propensity to&nbsp;science having procured him a recommendation to Dr Pemberton at London, by his assistance, while he attained the&nbsp;sublimer parts of mathematical knowledge, he commenced&nbsp;teacher of the mathematics. But the business of teaching,&nbsp;which required confinement, not suiting his active disposition, he gradually declined it, and engaged in business that&nbsp;required more exercise. Hence he tried many laborious&nbsp;experiments in gunnery, from the persuasion that the resistance of the air has a much greater influence on swift&nbsp;projectiles than is generally imagined. Hence also he was&nbsp;led to consider the mechanic arts that depend on mathematical principles ; as the construction of mills, the building of bridges, the draining of fens, the rendering of rivers&nbsp;navigable, and the making of harbours. Among other arts,&nbsp;fortification much engaged his attention ; and lie met with&nbsp;opportunities of perfecting himself by viewing the principal&nbsp;strong places of Flanders, in some tours which he made with&nbsp;persons of distinction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon his return from one of these excursions, he found the learned amused with Dr Berkeley’s work entitled “ The&nbsp;Analyst,” in which an attempt was made to explode the&nbsp;method of fluxions. Mr Robins was therefore advised to&nbsp;clear up this subject by giving a distinct account of Sir Isaac&nbsp;Newton’s doctrines, in such a manner as to obviate all the&nbsp;objections that had been made, w ithout naming them. Accordingly he published, in 1735, “A Discourse concerning&nbsp;the Nature and Certainty of Sir Isaac Newton’s Method of&nbsp;Fluxions ;” and, some exceptions being made to his manner&nbsp;of defending Newton, he afterwards wrote two or three additional discourses. In 1738, he defended the same great&nbsp;philosopher against an objection contained in a note at the&nbsp;end of Baxter’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Matho, sive Cοsmotheoria puerilis ;</span><span class="font0"> and the&nbsp;following year printed Remarks on Euler’s Treatise of Motion, on Dr Smith’s System of Optics, and on Dr Jurin’s&nbsp;Discourse of distinctand indistinct Vision, annexed to Smith’s&nbsp;work. In the mean while, Mr Robins did not solely confine himself to mathematical subjects; for in 1739 he published, without his name, three pamphlets on political affairs. Two of them, relating to the convention and négociation with Spain, were so highly esteemed as to occasion&nbsp;his being employed in a very honourable post : on a committee being appointed to examine into the past conduct&nbsp;of Sir Robert Walpole, he was chosen their secretary.</span></p>
