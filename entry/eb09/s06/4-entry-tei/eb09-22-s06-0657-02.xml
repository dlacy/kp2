<hi rend="smallcaps">Robert Spencer, Second Earl of</hi> (1640-1702), was the eldest son of Henry, the first earl, and Lady Dorothy Sidney, eldest daughter of Robert, second earl of Leicester. He was born in 1640 and succeeded his father (who was killed at Newbury) in the title on 20th September 1643.

It was during this period of his life that he acquired that suppleness of feeling and love of finesse which may be traced throughout his subsequent career. From February I679 to January I68I, a period when the country was rent in twain by real or fancied dangers to the Protestant faith, he held the post of secretary of state for the northern department ; but his conduct in office was not marked by discretion. He voted for the exclusion of the duke of York from the succession to the throne, and the ill-feeling which this action created in the mind of Charles II. was augmented by the overtures which Sunderland made to the prince of Orange, whilst differences of opinion on the subject of the Exclusion Bill brought about a fierce quarrel between Sunderland and Halifax, the head of the “trimmers.” Early in I683, having been reconciled to the duke of York and having secured a warm friend in the duchess of Portsmouth, Sunderland regained his place as secretary for the northern department. When James II. succeeded to the throne, Sunderland became secretary for the southern department, from March I685 to 27th October I688, for most of which period he held the additional post of president of the council, and was a member of the high commission for ecclesiastical causes. He afterwards claimed that he had used his influence to mitigate the proceedings of this obnoxious body, but he went sufficiently far with his royal master to sign the warrant for the committal of the bishops and to appear as a witness against them. Though Lord Sunderland was in sympathy, if not in actual communion, with Roman Catholicism, he hesitated to commit himself entirely to the acts of the fierce devotees who surrounded James II., and through their opposition he was dismissed in disgrace and sought security in Holland. He had been too much engaged in the acts of James II. to find a place among the advisers of William and Mary. <,p>  The visit which William paid to Althorp in Northamptonshire, the country seat of Sunderland, in I695 was the prelude of a reconciliation between the king and his ambitious subject and of Sunderland’s recall into public affairs. From April to December I697 he discharged the duties of lord chamberlain of the household and for the greater part of that time he was also lord justice of England ; but he finally retired from active life in the close of I697 through disgust at the check which William received in the retention of a standing army. The rest of his life was passed in strict seclusion at Althorp, and there he died on 28th September I7O2. <,p>  Lord Sunderland possessed a keen intellect and was consumed by intense restlessness ; but his character was wanting in steadfastness, and he yielded too easily to opposition. His adroitness in intrigue and his fascinating manners were exceptional even in an age when such qualities formed part of every statesman’s education ; but the characteristics which ensured him success in the House of Lords and in the royal closet led to failure in his attempts to understand the feelings of the mass of his countrymen. Consistency of conduct was not among the objects which he aimed at, nor did he shrink from thwarting in secret a policy which he supported in public. A large share of the discredit attaching to the measures of James II. must be assigned to the earl of Sunderland. <,p>
