the principal magiſtrate or governor of the Seven United Provinces. This office is now aboliſhed by the republican influence of France ; but as the prince of Orange is in alliance with this country, our readers will probably not be ill pleaſed with a short account of his ſeveral powers and claims. To render that account the more intelligible, we ſhall trace the office of Stadtholder from its origin.</p><p>The Seven Provinces of the Low Countries were long governed by princes invested with the ſovereignty, though limited in their powers, and under various titles ; as <hi rend="italic">Counts of Holland, Dukes of Guelder, Bishop of Utrecht, &amp;c.</hi> When theſe countries fell to the princes of the houſe of Burgundy, and afterwards to thoſe of Austria, who had many other dominions, the abſence of the ſovereign was ſupplied by a ſtadtholder or governor, vested with very ample powers. Theſe ſtadtholders or lieutenants had the adminiſtration of the government, and preſided in the courts of juſtice, whole juriſdiction was not at that time confined merely to the trial of causes, but extended to affairs of ſtate. The ſtadt- holders ſwore allegiance to the princes at their inauguration, jointly with the states of the provinces they governed. They likewiſe took an oath to the states, by which they promiſed to maintain their fundamental laws and privileges.</p><p>It was upon this footing that William the Firſt, prince of Orange, was made governor and lieutenant- general of Holland, Zealand, and Utrecht, by Philip the Second, upon his leaving the Low Countries to go into Spain. The troubles beginning ſoon after, this prince found means to bring about an union, in 1576, between Holland and Zealand ; the states of which two provinces put into his hands, as far as was in their power, the ſovereign authority (for ſo long time as they ſhould remain in war and under arms), upon the ſame footing as Holland had intruſted him with in the year before. In 1581 the ſame authority was again renewed to him by Holland, as it was ſoon after by Zealand likewiſe ; and in 1584, being already elected count of Holland, upon certain conditions he would have been formally invested with the ſovereignty, had not a wretch, hired and employed by the court of Spain, put an end to his life by a horrid aſſaſſination.</p><p>In the preamble of the inſtruments by which the states in 1581 conferred the ſovereign authority upon prince William the Firſt, we find theſe remarkable words, which are there ſet down as fundamental rules :</p><p>That all republics and communities ought to preſerve, maintain, and fortify themſelves by unanimity ; which being impossible to be kept up always among ſo<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0725.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0719"/>
many members, often differing in inclinations and ſentiments, it is conſequently neceſſary that the government ſhould be placed in the hands of one single chief magistrate.” Many good politicians, and the greateſt part of the inhabitants of theſe provinces, have, ſince the eſtabliſhment of the republic, looked upon the ſtadtholderian government as an eſſential part of her constitution ; nor has ſhe been without a stadtholder but twice, that is to ſay, from the end of 1650 to 1672, and again from March 1702 till April 1747. The provinces of Frieſland and Groningen, with Ommelands, have always had a ſtadtholder without interruption : their inſtructions, which are now no longer in force, may be ſeen in Aitzema ; but formerly the powers of the ſtadtholder of theſe provinces were confined within narrower bounds, and till William the Fourth there was no ſtadtholder of the ſeven provinces together.</p><p>The ſtadtholder cannot declare war nor make peace, but he has, in quality of captain-general of the union, the command in chief of all the forces of the ſtate<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> In times of war, however, the ſtates have always named deputies for the army, t accompany the ſtadt-holders in the field, and to ſerve them as counſellors in all their enterpriſes, particularly in the moſt important affairs, ſuch as giving battle, or undertaking a ſiege, &amp;c. This was always practiſed till the acceſſion of king. William the Third to the crown of Great Britain, and after his death was continued with regard to the general in chief of the army of the republic. In 1747 and 1748 there were likewiſe deputies with the army, but with more limited power.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a) ;</hi> and military perſons are obliged to obey him in every thing that concerns the ſervice. He is not limited by instructions, but he has the important power of giving out orders for the march of troops, and the diſpoſition of all matters relative to them. He not only directs their marches, but provides for the garriſons, and changes them at pleaſure. All military edicts and regulations come from him alone ; he conſtitutes and authorizes the high council of war of the United Provinces, and, as captain-general of every province, diſpoſes of all military offices, as far as the rank of colonel incluſively. The higher poſts, ſuch as thoſe of velt-marſhals, generals, lieutenant-generals, major-generals, are given by the states-general, who chooſe the perlons recommended by his highneſs. He make; the governors, commandants, &amp;c. of towns and ſtrong places of the republic, and of the barrier. The perſons nominated preſent their inſtruments of appointment to their high mightineſſes, who provide them with commiſſions. The ſtates-general have likewiſe great regard to the recommendation of the prince ſtadtholder in the diſpoſition of thoſe civil employments which are in their gift.</p><p>The power of the ſtadtholder as high-admiral, extends to every thing that concerns the naval force of the republic, and to all the other affairs that are here within the juriſdiction of the admiralty. He preſides at theſe boards either in perſon or by his repreſentar tives ; and as chief of them all in general, and of every one in particular, he has power to make their orders and inſtructions be obſerved by themſelves and others. He beſtows the poſts of lieutenant-admiral, vice-admiral, and rear-admiral, who command under him ; and he makes likewiſe poſt-captains.</p><p>The ſtadtholder grants likewiſe letters of grace, pardon, and abolition, as well for the crime called <hi rend="italic">Communia Delicta,</hi> as for military offences. In Holland and Zealand theſe letters are made out for crimes of the firſt fort, in the name of the ſtates, with the advice of his highneſs. In military offences he conſults the high council of vzar, and upon the <hi rend="italic">communia delicta</hi> he takes the advice of the courts of juſtice, of the counſellors, committees of the provinces, of the council of ſtate, and the tribunals of juſtice in the reſpective towns, according to the nature of the caſe.</p><p>In the provinces of Holland and Zealand, the ſtadtholder elects the magiſtrates of the towns annually, out of a double number that are returned to him by the towns themſelves.</p><p>When any of thoſe offices become vacant, which, at the time there was no governor, were in the diſpoſal of the ſtates of Holland, or as formerly in that of the chamber of accounts, the ſtadtholder has his choice of two, or, in ſome caſes, of three candidates, named by their noble and great mightineſſes. He chooſes likewiſe the counſellors, inspectors of the dykes of Rynland, Delſland, and Scheeland, out of three perſons preſented to him by the boards of the counſellors inſpectors ; which boards are of very ancient eſtabliſhment in Holland.</p><p>His highneſs preſides in the courts of Holland, and in the courts of juſtice of the other provinces ; and his name is placed at the head of the proclamations and acts, called in Dutch <hi rend="italic">Mαndamenten,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Provisien van Justitie.</hi> In Overyſſel and in the province of Utrecht the poſſeſſors of fiefs hold of the prince ſtadtholder. He is ſupreme curator of the univerſities of Guelder, Frieſland, and Groningen ; grand foreſter and grand veneur in Guelder, in Holland, and other places. In the province of Utrecht, his highneſs, by virtue of the regulation of 1674, diſpoſes of the provoſtſhips and other benefices which remain to the chapters, as alſo of the canonical prebends that fall in the months which were formerly the papal months.</p><p>By the firſt article of the council of ſtate of the United Provinces, the ſtadtholder is the firſt member of it, and has a right of voting there, with an appointment of 25,090 guilders a-year. He aſſiſts alſo as often as he thinks it for the ſervice of the ſtate, at the deliberations of the ſtates-general, to make propoſitions to them, and ſometimes alſo at the conferences which the deputies of their high mightineſſes hold in their different committees, in conſequence of their ſtanding orders. He likewiſe aſſiſts at the affemblies of the ſtates of each particular province, and at that of the counſellors committees. In Guelder, Holland, and Utrecht, his highneſs has a ſhare of the ſovereignty, as chief or preſident of the body of nobles ; and in Zealand, where he poſſesſes the marquiſate of Veer and Fluſhing, as firſt noble, and repreſenting the whole nobility. In his abſence he has in Zealand his repreſentatives, who have the firſt place and the firſt voice in all, the councils, and the firſt of whom is always firſt deputy from the province to the aſſembly of their high mightineſſes.</p><p>In 1749 the prince ſtadtholder was created by ths<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0726.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0720"/>
ſtates-general, governor-general and ſupreme director of the Eaſt and West India companies ; dignities which give him a great deal of authority and power, and which bad never been conferred upon any oſ his predeceſſors, nor have they hitherto been made hereditary. He has his repreſentatives in the ſeveral chambers of the company, and chooſes their directors out of a nomination of three qualified perſons. The prince enjoyed this prerogative in Zealand from the time of his elevation to the ſtadtholderate.</p><p>The revenues of the ſtadtholderate of the ſeven United Provinces are reckoned (including the 25,000 guilders which the prince enjoys annually as the firſt member of the council of ſtate, and what he has from the India company’s dividends) to amount to 300,000 guilders a-year. As captain-general of the union, his serene highnecſs has 120,000 guilders <hi rend="italic">per annum,</hi> besides 24,000 from Frieſland, and 12,000 from Groningen, in quality of captain-general of thoſe provinces. In times of war the ſtate allows extraordinary ſums to the captaingeneral for the expence of every campaign.</p><p>To all theſe powers and privileges the prince of Orange has a legal and conſtitutional right ; but he has been diveſted of them by a faction which ſeems determined to fell to the cruel and arbitrary republic of France that country which his anceſtors redeemed from Auſtrian ſlavery, at the hazard of loſing every thing dear to them but liberty and honour.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
