                the machine guns on the Wall prevented them from leaving the&nbsp;parallel. At
                Chi-Kuan Fort the terreplein of the fort had been&nbsp;covered with entanglements
                defended by machine guns on the gorge&nbsp;parapets, and the Japanese could make no
                way. Briefly, there was&nbsp;a furious fight all along the line, and nothing gained.
                On the 27th&nbsp;cf November, after losing 12,000 men, the assault was
                abandoned.&nbsp;On the north front the Japanese returned to mining.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">But so urgent was the necessity of speedy victory that the fighting
                had to continue elsewhere. And at last, after every other point&nbsp;had been
                attempted, the weight of the attack was directed&nbsp;on 20^-Metre Hill. A battery
                of 11-inch howitzers was&nbsp;established only one mile away. On the 28th of
                November&nbsp;assaults were made and failed. On the 30th of November an&nbsp;attack
                with fresh troops failed again. On the 1st of December there&nbsp;was a heavy
                bombardment by the big howitzers, which obliged the&nbsp;Russians to take shelter in
                rear of the ruined works. On the 2nd&nbsp;of December the Russians tried a
                counter-attack. During the next&nbsp;two days the artillery were busy. The engineers
                sapped up to the&nbsp;ruins of the western work, saw the shelters on the reverse
                slope and&nbsp;directed artillery fire by telephone. Thirty-six guns swept
                the&nbsp;ground with shrapnel. Finally on the 5th of December the
                Japanese&nbsp;attacked successfully. Their losses in the last ten days at 203-Metre
                Hill had been probably oyer 10,000. Those of the Russians</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">were about 5000, chiefly from artillery fire.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">This was the turning-point of the siege. At once the 1 i-inch
                howitzers, assisted by telephone from 203-Metre, opened upon the Russian ships; a
                few days later these were wholly</span><span class="font1"

                at&nbsp;the capitulation only a few destroyers were in a condition to
                escape.&nbsp;The siege was now pressed with vigour by the construction
                of&nbsp;batteries at and around 203 Metre, by an infantry advance against&nbsp;the
                main western defences, and by renewed operations against the&nbsp;eastern forts. The
                escarp of Chi-Kuan wa&amp; blown up, and at the&nbsp;cost of 800 men, General
                Sameyeda (nth division), personally leading his stormers, captured the great fort on
                the 19th of December.&nbsp;The escarp of Ehr-Lung was also blown up, and the ruins
                of the fort&nbsp;were stormed by the 9th division on the 28th of December,
                though&nbsp;a mere handful of the defenders prolonged the fighting for
                eight&nbsp;hours and the assailants lost 1000 men. Sung-Shu suffered a
                worse&nbsp;fate on the 31st, the greater part of the fort and its defenders
                being&nbsp;blown up, and on this day the whole defence of the eastern
                front&nbsp;collapsed. The Japanese 7th and 1st divisions were now&nbsp;advancing on
                the western main line; the soul of the&nbsp;defence, the brave and capable General
                Kondratenko,&nbsp;had been killed on the 15th of December, and though the</span></p>

                Stessel surrendered on the 2nd of January 1905, with 24,000 effective and slightly
                wounded and 15,000 wounded and sick men, the remnant of his&nbsp;original 47,000.
                The total losses of the 3rd Japanese Army during&nbsp;the siege were about 92,00b
                men (58,000 casualties and 34,000 sick).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Meanwhile the Japanese navy had scored two important successes. After
                months of blockade and minor fighting, the Russian Port&nbsp;Arthur squadron had
                been brought to action on the 10th of&nbsp;August. Admiral Vitheft, Makarov’s
                successor, had put to&nbsp;sea shortly after the appearance of the 3rd Army on
                the&nbsp;land front of Port Arthur. The battle opened about noon,&nbsp;20 m. south
                of the harbour; the forces engaged on each&nbsp;side varied somewhat, but Togo
                finally had a superiority. Admiral&nbsp;Vitheft was killed. As the Russians became
                gradually weaker,&nbsp;the Japanese closed in to within 3 m. range, and Prince
                Ukhtomsky&nbsp;(who succeeded to the command on Vitheft’s fall) gave up
                the&nbsp;struggle at nightfall. The Russians scattered, some vessels
                heading&nbsp;southward, the majority with the admiral making for Port
                Arthur,&nbsp;whence they did not again emerge. All the rest were either
                forced&nbsp;into neutral ports (where they were interned) or destroyed,
                among&nbsp;the latter being the third-class cruiser “ Novik,” which nad
                already&nbsp;earned a brilliant reputation for daring, and now steamed
                half&nbsp;round Japan before she was brought to action and run ashore.&nbsp;The
                victors blockaded Port Arthur, until near the close of the siege,&nbsp;when, after
                going ashore and examining the remnant of the Russian&nbsp;fleet from 203-Metre
                Hill, Togo concluded that it would be safe to&nbsp;return to Japan and give his
                ships a complete refit. Kaimura’s&nbsp;squadron, after various adventures, at last
                succeeded on the 14th&nbsp;of August in engaging and defeating the Russian
                Vladivostok&nbsp;squadron (Admiral Jessen). Thus the Russian flag
                disappeared&nbsp;from the Pacific, and thenceforward only the Baltic fleet could
                hope</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">seriously to challenge the supremacy of the Japanese navy.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The remainder of the war on land, although it included two battles on
                a large scale and numerous minor operations, was&nbsp;principally a test of
                endurance. After Liao-Yang there were&nbsp;no extended operations, the area of
                conflict being confined to the&nbsp;plain of the coast side of the Hun-ho and the
                fringe of the&nbsp;mountains. Japan had partially accomplished her task,
                but&nbsp;had employed all her trained men in this partial accomplishment. It was
                questionable, even in October 1904, whether she&nbsp;could endure the drain of men
                and money, if it were prolonged&nbsp;much further. On the other hand, in Russia
                opposition to the&nbsp;war, which had never been popular, gradually became
                the&nbsp;central feature of a widespread movement against
                irresponsible&nbsp;government. Thus while the armies in Manchuria faced
                one&nbsp;another with every appearance of confidence, behind them&nbsp;the situation
                was exceedingly grave for both parties. A state&nbsp;of equilibrium was established,
                only momentarily disturbed&nbsp;by Kuropatkin's offensive on the Sha-ho in October,
                and by&nbsp;the Sandepu incident in the winter, until at last Oyama fought&nbsp;a
                battle on a grand scale and won it. Even then, however, the&nbsp;results fell far
                short of anticipation, and the armies settled down&nbsp;into equilibrium
                again.</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font1">After the battle of Liao-Yang Kuropatkin reverted for a moment to
                    the plan of a concentration to the rear at Tieling. Politically,&nbsp;however,
                    it was important to hold Mukden, the Manchurian capital,&nbsp;and since the
                    Japanese, as on previous occasions, reorganized&nbsp;instead of pursuing, he
                    decided to stand his ground, a resolution&nbsp;which had an excellent effect on
                    his army. Moreover, growing&nbsp;in strength day by day, and aware that the
                    Japanese had outrun&nbsp;their powers, he resolved, in spite of the despondency
                    of many of&nbsp;his senior officers, to take the offensive. He disposed of
                    about&nbsp;200,000 men, the Japanese had about 170,000. The latter
                    lay&nbsp;entrenched north of Liao-Yang, from a point 9 m. west of the railway,
                    through Yentai Station and Yentai Mines, to the hills farther&nbsp;east. There
                    had been a good deal of rain, and the ground was heavy.&nbsp;Kuropat kin’s
                    intention was to work round the Japanese right on&nbsp;the hills with his
                    eastern wing (Stakelberg), to move his western&nbsp;wing (Bilderling) slowly
                    southwards, entrenching each strip of ground&nbsp;gained, and finally with the
                    centre—i.e. Bilderling’s left—and&nbsp;Stakelberg, to envelop and crush the 1st
                    Army, which formed the</span></p>

                    (Nozu) and the 2nd Army Oku) in countenance by means of Bilderling’s main body.
                    The&nbsp;manoeuvre began on the 5th of October, and by the evening of
                    the&nbsp;10th, after four days of fairly heavy advanced-guard
                    fighting,&nbsp;chiefly between Bilderling and Nozu, Stakelberg was in his
                    assigned</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">^</span><span class="font1">jsition in the mountainous country,
                    facing west towards Liao-ang, with his left on the Taitseho. The advance of
                    Bilderling, however, necessarily methodical and slow in any case, had
                    taken&nbsp;more time than was anticipated. Still, Bilderling crossed
                    the&nbsp;Sha-ho and made some progress towards Yentai, and
                    the&nbsp;demonstration was so far effectual that Kuroki’s warnings were almost
                    disregarded by the Japanese headquarters. The&nbsp;commander of the 1st Army,
                    however, took his measures well, and&nbsp;Stakelberg found the greatest trouble
                    in deploying his forces for&nbsp;action in this difficult country. Oyama became
                    convinced of the&nbsp;truth on the 9th and 10th, and prepared a great
                    counter-attack.&nbsp;Kuroki with only a portion of the 1st Army was left to
                    defend at least&nbsp;15 m. of front, and the entire 2nd and 4th Armies and the
                    general&nbsp;reserves were to be thrown upon Bilderling. On the nth the
                    real&nbsp;battle opened. Kuroki displayed the greatest skill, but he was
                    of&nbsp;course pressed back by the four-to-one superiority of the
                    Russians.&nbsp;Still the result of Stakelberg’s attack, for which he was unable
                    to&nbsp;deploy his whole force, was disappointing, but the main
                    Japanese&nbsp;attack on Bilderling was not much more satisfactory, for the
                    Russians&nbsp;had entrenched every step of their previous advance, and
                    fought&nbsp;splendidly. The Russian commander-in-chief states in his
                    work&nbsp;on the war that Bilderling became engaged </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">d fond</span><span class="font1"> instead of
                    gradually withdrawing as Kuropatkin intended, and at any rate it
                    is&nbsp;unquestioned that in consequence of the serious position of
                    affairs&nbsp;on the western wing, not only did Stakelberg use his reserves
                    to&nbsp;support Bilderling, when the 12th division of Kuroki’s army
                    was&nbsp;almost at its last gasp and must have yielded to fresh pressure,
                    but&nbsp;Kuropatkin himself suspended the general offensive on the 13th
                    of&nbsp;October. In the fighting of the I3th-i6th of October the
                    Russians&nbsp;gradually gave back as far as the line of the Sha-ho, the
                    Japanese&nbsp;following until the armies faced roughly north and south on
                    parallel&nbsp;fronts. The fighting, irregular but severe, continued.
                    Kuropatkin&nbsp;was so far averse to retreat that he ordered a new offensive,
                    which&nbsp;was carried out on the 16-17th. Putilov and Novgorod
                    hills,&nbsp;south of the Sha-ho, were stormed by the Russians, and the
                    Japanese&nbsp;made several efforts to retake these positions without
                    success.&nbsp;Kuropatkin wished to continue the offensive, but his corps
                    commanders offered so much opposition to a further offensive that he&nbsp;at
                    last gave up the idea. The positions of the rival armies from&nbsp;the 18th of
                    October, the close of the battle of the Sha-ho, to the 26th&nbsp;of January
                    1905, the opening of the battle of Sandepu (Heikoutai)—&nbsp;a period almost
                    entirely devoid of incident—may be described by&nbsp;the old-fashioned term “
                    winter quarters.” The total losses of&nbsp;the Russians are stated as 42,000
                    men, but this is very considerably&nbsp;exaggerated; the Japanese acknowledged
                    20,000 casualties.</span></p>
