<p><span class="font1">an axis </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e f</span><span class="font1"> of ſtiff-tempered ſteel-wire, ſo that the fur-face on which the fluid is to act may be inclined to the ſtream in the preciſe angle we deſire. Let this&nbsp;axis have hooks at its extremities, which are hitched&nbsp;into the loops of four equal threads, ſuſpeuded fιom the&nbsp;hooks </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a, b,</span><span class="font1"> c, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cl ;</span><span class="font1"> and let He be a ſilth thread, ſuſpended from the middle of the line joining the points of&nbsp;fuſpenſion </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a, b.</span><span class="font1"> Let HIK be a graduated arch, whole&nbsp;centre is H, and whoſe plane is in the direction of the&nbsp;ſtream. It is evident that the impulle on the body </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">G&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">will be meaſured (by a proceſs well known to every&nbsp;mathematician) by the deviation of the thread He from&nbsp;the vertical line HI ; and this will be done without any&nbsp;intricacy of calculation, or any attention to the centres&nbsp;of gravity, of oſcillation, or of percuſſion. Theſe muſt&nbsp;be accurately afcertained with reſpect to that form in&nbsp;which the pendulum has always been employed for&nbsp;meafuring the impulſe or velocity of a ſtream. Theſe&nbsp;advantages ariſe from the circumſtance, that the axis&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cſ</span><span class="font1"> remains always parallel to the horizon, we may&nbsp;be allowed to obſerve, by the by, that this would have&nbsp;been a great improvement of the beautiful experiments&nbsp;of Mr Robins and Dr Hutton on the velocities of&nbsp;cannon-ſhot, and would have ſaved much intricate calculation, and been attended with many important ad-vantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The great difficulty is, as we have obſerved, to mea-fure the velocity of the ſtream. Even this may be done in this way w<sup>τ</sup>ith fome preciſion. Let two floating bo-dies be dragged along the ſurface, as in the experiments&nbsp;of the academy, at fome diſtance from each other late-rally, ſo. that the water between them may not be ſen-ſibly diſturbed. Let a horizontal bar be attached to&nbsp;them, tranſverſe to the direction of their motion, at a&nbsp;proper height above the furface, and let a ſpherical pen-duλum be iuſpended from this, or let it be ſuſpended&nbsp;from four points, as here deſcribed. Now let the deviation of this pendulum be noted in a variety of velo-cities. This will give us the law of relation between&nbsp;the velocity and the deviation of the pendulum. Now,&nbsp;in making experiments on the refiſtance of bodies, let&nbsp;the velocity of the ſtream, in the very filament in which&nbsp;the refiſtance is meafnred, be determined by the devia-t.ion of this pendulum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It were greatly to be wiſhed that ſome more palpable argument could be found for the exiſtence of a quantity&nbsp;of ſtagnant fluid at the anterior and poſterior patts of&nbsp;tlie body. The one already given, derived from the&nbsp;confideration that no motion changes either its velocity&nbsp;or direction by finite quantities in an inſtant, is unex-ceptionable. But it gives us little information. The&nbsp;finalleit conceivable extent of the curve FM in fig. 16.&nbsp;will anſwer this condition, provided only that it touch-es the axis in ſome peint F, and the body in ſome point&nbsp;M, fo as not to make a finite angle with either. But&nbsp;ſurely there are circumſtances which rigorouſiy determine the extent of this ſtagnant fluid. And it appears&nbsp;without doubt, that if there were no coheſion or fric-tion, this ſpace will have a determined ratio to the fize&nbsp;of the body (the figures of the bodies being ſuppoſed&nbsp;ſimilar).. Suppoſe a plane ſurfaee AB, as in ſig. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">io.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">there can be no doubt but that the figure A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> D </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1"> B&nbsp;will in every caſe be ſimilar. But if we ſuppoſe an&nbsp;adheſion or tenacity which is conſtant, this may make&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">θ </span><span class="font1">change </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">both </span><span class="font1">in its </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">extent and its form : ſor its con-</span><span class="font1">ſtancy oſ form depends on the diſturbing forces being&nbsp;alwayβ as the ſquares of the velocity ; and this ratio oſ&nbsp;the diſturbing forces is preſerved, while the inertia of&nbsp;the fluid is the only agent and patient in the proceſs.&nbsp;But when we add to this the conſtant (that is, invariable) diſturbing force of tenacity, a change of form and&nbsp;dimenlions muſt happen. In like manner, the friction,&nbsp;or ſomething analogous to friction, which produces an&nbsp;effect proportional to the velocity, muſt alter this ne-ceſlhry ratio of the whole diſturbing forces. We may&nbsp;conclude, that the effect of both theſe circumſtances&nbsp;will be to diminiſh the quantity of this ſtagnant fluid,&nbsp;by licking it away externally ; and to this we muſt&nbsp;afcribe the fact, that the part FAM is never perfectly&nbsp;ſtagnant, but is generally diſturbed with a whirling motion. we may alſo conclude, that this ſtagnant ſiuid.&nbsp;will be more ineurvated between F and M than it would,&nbsp;have been, independent of tenacity and friction ; and&nbsp;that the arch LR. will, on the contrary, be leſs incur-vated.—And, laſtly, we may conclude, that there will&nbsp;be ſomething oppoſite to preffure, or ſomething which&nbsp;we may call </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">abjtra£lion,</span><span class="font1"> exerted on the poſterior part of&nbsp;the body which moves in a tenacious fluid, or is expo-fed to the ſtream of ſuch a fluid ; lor the ſtagnant&nbsp;ſtuid LCR adheres to the ſurfaee LC ; and the paſ-ſing ſtuid tends to draw it away both by its tenacity&nbsp;and by its friction. This mnſt augment the apparent&nbsp;impulſe of the ſtream on fuch a body ; and it muſt&nbsp;greatly augment the reſiſtance, that is, the motion loſt&nbsp;by this body in its progrefs through the tenacious fluid :&nbsp;for the body muſt drag along with it this ſtagnant fluid,&nbsp;and drag it in oppoſition. to the tenacity and friction </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the ſurrounding fluid. The effect of this is moſt remarkably ſeen in the reſiſtances to the motion of pen-dulums : and the chevalier Boat, in his examination of&nbsp;Newton’s experiments, clearly ſhows that this conſti-tutes the greateſt part of the reſiſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This moſt ingenious writer has paid great attention to this part of the proceſs of nature, and has laid the&nbsp;foundation of a theory of reſiſtance entirely different&nbsp;from all the preceding. We cannot abridge it ; and it&nbsp;is too imperfect in its preſent condition to be offered as&nbsp;a body βf doctrine : but we hope that the ingenious au-thor wiſl proſecute the ſubject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">WE cannot conclude this differtation (which we acknowledge to be very unſatisfactory and imperfect) better, than by giving an account of ſome experiments&nbsp;of the chevalier Buat, which ſeem of immenſe conſequence, and tend to give us very new views of the fub-ject. Mr Buat obſerved the motion of water iffuing&nbsp;from a glaſs cylinder through a narrow ring formed by&nbsp;a bottom of ſmaller diameter ; that is, the cylinder was&nbsp;open at both ends, and there was placed at its lower&nbsp;end a circle of ſmaller diameter, by way of bottom,&nbsp;which left a ring all around. He threw ſome powdered ſealing wax into the water, and obſerved with great&nbsp;attention the motion of its ſmall particles. He law&nbsp;thoſe which happened to be in the very axis of the cylinder deſcend along the axis with a motion pretty&nbsp;uniform, till they came very near the bottom from<sub>i&nbsp;</sub>this they continued to deſcend very ſlowly, till they were&nbsp;almoſt in contact with the bottom ; they then deviated from the centre, and approached the orifice in.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
