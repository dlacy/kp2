Starting thus, Sarrazin speedily obtained employment from Cardinal Aldobrandini at Frascati, where he won the friendship of Domenichino, with whom he afterwards worked on the high altar of St Andrea della Valle. His return to Paris, where he married a niece of Simon Vouet, was signalized by a series of successes which attracted the notice of Sublet des Noyers, who entrusted to him the work by which Sarrazin is best known, the decoration of the great portal and the dome of the western façade of the interior court of the Louvre. The famous Caryatides of the attic show the profound study of Michelangelo’s art to which Sarrazin had devoted all the time he could spare from bread-winning whilst in Rome. He now executed many commissions from the queen, and was an active promoter of the foundation of the Academy. The mausoleum for the heart of the prince de Condé in the Jesuit church of the Rue Saint Antoine was his last considerable work (see Lenoir, <hi rend="italic">Musée des monuments français,</hi> v. 5); he died on the 3rd of December 1660, whilst it was in progress, and the crucifix of the altar was actually completed by one of his pupils named Gros.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
