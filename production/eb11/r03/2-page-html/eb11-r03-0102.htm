<p><span class="font1">consolidate properly without admixture; indeed they became more intractable the more they were abraded by rolling. G. F.&nbsp;Deacon of Liverpool advocated a binding composed of large&nbsp;chips of trap rock or else of siliceous gravel from the size of&nbsp;three-quarters of an inch down to that of a pin's head, together&nbsp;with about one-fourth part of macadam sweepings obtained&nbsp;in wet weather. This will enable the roller to consolidate the&nbsp;road-metal in a third of the time required for broken stone&nbsp;alone. The harder materials here suggested differ essentially&nbsp;from the sand and dirt formerly used for binding, since they fill&nbsp;up all the vacant spaces and cannot be washed down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A new road is preferably finished by rolling, since in that way the materials are consolidated with less waste, and wear&nbsp;and tear of vehicles is saved. A 15-ton steam-roller, 7 ft.&nbsp;wide, giving upwards of 2 tons weight per foot can thoroughly&nbsp;consolidate 1000 to 2000 sq. yds. of newly laid materials per&nbsp;day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A pitched foundation, as used by Telford, consists of flat stones set on edge in courses across the road with the broader&nbsp;edges downwards. All inequalities must be knocked off,&nbsp;and small stones and chips must be firmly pinned into the&nbsp;interstices with a hammer, so as to form a regular convex&nbsp;surface with every stone fixed firmly in place. A foundation&nbsp;of cement concrete 6 in. thick was used by Sir J. Macneill on&nbsp;the Highgate Archway (London) road on a bad clay bottom,&nbsp;and common lime concrete was subsequently used elsewhere.&nbsp;A bed of lias lime concrete 12 in. thick was laid as a foundation&nbsp;in Southwark Street and on the Thames Embankment, but it&nbsp;is too expensive for a macadamized road under ordinary circumstances. Foundations of large and rough hard-core should&nbsp;be rolled down to a surface close enough to keep the finer pieces&nbsp;of road-metal from dropping down, so as to create hollows&nbsp;which, though they may escape the roller, will be detected&nbsp;by the laden wheel and by the pounding of the heavy hoof.&nbsp;But there is </span><span class="font0">no </span><span class="font1">foundation equal to sand, which has the property of spreading pressure over an enlarged area. A 12-in.&nbsp;bed of sand rolled down to 8 in. has been recommended, but&nbsp;military engineers have found that a layer of so little as 3 or&nbsp;4 in. is sufficient as a foundation for macadam in very bad&nbsp;ground that has been rolled, or on an embankment that has&nbsp;had time to settle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tar Macadam.—</span><span class="font1">Broken stone mixed with some bituminous composition has been found very suitable for suburban roads,&nbsp;and for towns where the nature of the traffic requires smooth&nbsp;roadways reasonably free from noise and dust. Xn its simplest&nbsp;form, tar macadam is made from a good hard limestone broken&nbsp;into the usual sizes, the fine chips being used for top-dressing.&nbsp;In a shed a large hearth is formed of stone flagging, under which&nbsp;the flues of a furnace are constructed, and upon the hearth the&nbsp;broken stone is spread in a layer just as thick as the heat may&nbsp;be able to penetrate, to dry off the moisture and make the&nbsp;stones distinctly hot. The load of an ordinary barrow is&nbsp;tipped on an iron plate and gas tar is poured over it (from&nbsp;8 to 12 gals, per cubic yard), while a couple of men with&nbsp;shovels turn it over exactly as they would turn concrete. No&nbsp;more tar should be used than is required completely to blacken&nbsp;the whole surface of every stone; and when this has been&nbsp;done, the stone can be thrown upon the heap, where it may be&nbsp;kept for one or two months, under cover, to allow the volatile&nbsp;oils to evaporate. Fine siftings are treated in the same way.&nbsp;When it has been properly seasoned, the mass should assume&nbsp;a greenish lustre; and when cut into by a shovel, the particles&nbsp;will cling together and creep down slowly so that the heap is&nbsp;said to be “ alive.” In that state it may be used. The tar&nbsp;ought to be boiled, and if too thin, a little pitch may be added&nbsp;to it, though not enough to make the heap consolidate. A&nbsp;mixture of tar with pitch and creosote oil is used by more&nbsp;precise makers, one formula being 12 gals, tar, ξ cwt. pitch&nbsp;and 2 gals, creosote oil to a ton of stone. But these ingredients&nbsp;differ considerably in their chemical composition, and the proportions have to be varied according to experience. Moreover,&nbsp;as regards the tar and pitch used in the manufacture of pavements, the varieties that come directly from a vegetable source&nbsp;are liable to melt in hot and to become brittle in cold weather;&nbsp;coal tar is only moderately proof against these extremes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tar macadam must be put down in dry weather. If the material seems too dry, hot tar may be applied as before, but&nbsp;only as an expedient, and with great economy, so that the&nbsp;pavement may not soften in the sun. Upon a well-rolled&nbsp;foundation of hard material a layer of the coarser macadam&nbsp;should be put and rolled, then a layer of the smaller grade.&nbsp;For a road of light traffic a coat of the fine siftings may be put&nbsp;down and heavily rolled to a finished surface. For a road of&nbsp;heavier traffic the second coat should be dressed before rolling&nbsp;with tarred stone of a gauge of three-quarters of an inch to an&nbsp;inch and a quarter, and rolled first with a roller of not more&nbsp;than 10 or 12 cwt., then with one of 30 cwt. After the traffic&nbsp;has been turned on the road for a few days it should again be&nbsp;rolled as heavily as may be necessary to restore any parts that&nbsp;have been disturbed. But such roads are often consolidated&nbsp;by steam-rollers of 10 or 15 tons. For refacing an old road&nbsp;the prongs attached to a steam-roller will easily lift the old&nbsp;layer. Small depressions may be well tarred and levelled up&nbsp;with fine stuff, and the whole surface may be dressed every&nbsp;three years with tar and a fresh coat of fine chips. If the&nbsp;surface of the road is irregular, water will hang upon it, and&nbsp;frost may cause it to become slippery. The lack of affinity&nbsp;between granite and bitumen prevents the use of tar macadam&nbsp;upon roads of heavy traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Concrete Macadam.—</span><span class="font1">Rocks like granite and syenite may be used in combination with Portland cement. The ingredients&nbsp;are mixed in about the proportion of four parts of broken stone&nbsp;that has first been well wetted, one and a quarter or two parts&nbsp;of clean sharp sand, and one of cement put on in two layers,&nbsp;the second being rolled by hand to the required shape and to *&nbsp;a good surface. It should remain for two or three weeks to&nbsp;dry and set. Want of elasticity may be urged against concrete&nbsp;macadam, and it is productive of dust, but in some cases it has&nbsp;proved satisfactory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gravel Roads.—</span><span class="font1">Smooth rounded gravel is unsuitable for roads unless a large proportion of it is hroken, and about an&nbsp;eighth part of ferruginous clay added for binding. Rough&nbsp;pit gravel that will consolidate under the roller may be applied&nbsp;in two or more layers, but each must be of similar composition,&nbsp;or the smaller stuff will work downwards. A gravel road&nbsp;should be always under inspection, and repairs should be done&nbsp;without delay. A track for equestrian exercise should be&nbsp;made of hoggin or fine gravel, that will remain soft when raked&nbsp;or harrowed and watered. It should be well drained. A&nbsp;foundation of rough hard core will let the hoggin pass down into&nbsp;it, so that the hard core will appear at the surface. The best&nbsp;material is rough chalk sufficiently rolled to stop the gravel&nbsp;while draining off the surface water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stone Pavements.—</span><span class="font1">Early pitched roadways consisted of pebbles or rounded boulders (“ cobblestones ”) bedded in the&nbsp;natural surface or in sand or gravel. The next step in advance&nbsp;was to employ roughly squared blocks; but the wide and&nbsp;irregular joints admitted the water to the subsoil, and the mud&nbsp;worked up and the stones sank irregularly under the traffic.&nbsp;Telford, who was called upon to report on the street pavements&nbsp;of the parish of Hanover Square in 1824, saw the necessity of&nbsp;cutting off all connexion between the subsoil and the paving&nbsp;stones. He recommended a bed of about 6 in. of clean river&nbsp;ballast, rendered compact by being travelled upon for some&nbsp;time before the paving was laid, but he subsequently considered&nbsp;that nothing short of 12 in. of broken stone, put on in layers&nbsp;4 in. thick and completely consolidated by carriages passing&nbsp;over them, would' answer the purpose. He recommended&nbsp;paving stones of considerable depth and of from 4I to 6 or&nbsp;71 in. in breadth for the greatest thoroughfares, and he pointed&nbsp;out the importance of working the stones flat on the face and&nbsp;square on all sides, so as to joint close and preserve the bed&nbsp;or base as nearly as possible of the same size as the face, and&nbsp;of carefully placing together in the same course stones of equal</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
