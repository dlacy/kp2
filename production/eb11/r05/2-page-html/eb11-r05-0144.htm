<p><span class="font0">the men of Rfis, or Variags, as they were sometimes called, were simply the hardy Norsemen or Normans who at that&nbsp;time, in various countries of Europe, appeared first as armed&nbsp;marauders and then lived in the invaded territory as a dominant&nbsp;military caste until they were gradually absorbed by the native&nbsp;population. Lake Ilmen and the river Volkhov, on which&nbsp;stands Novgorod, Rurik’s capital, formed part of the great&nbsp;waterway from the Baltic to the Black Sea, and we know&nbsp;that by this route travelled from Scandinavia to Constantinople&nbsp;the tall fair-haired Northmen who composed the famous&nbsp;Varangian bodyguard of the Byzantine emperors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The new rulers did not long confine their attention to the tribes who had invited them. They at once began to conquer&nbsp;the surrounding country in all directions, and before&nbsp;two centuries had passed they had established themselves firmly at Kiev on the Dnieper, invaded&nbsp;Byzantine territory, threatened Constantinople with&nbsp;a fleet of small craft, obtained as consort for one&nbsp;of their princes, Vladimir I, (?.v.), a sister of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Byzantine emperor on condition of the prince becoming a Christian, adopted Christianity for themselves and their&nbsp;subjects, learned to hold in check the nomadic hordes of the&nbsp;steppe, and formed matrimonial alliances with the reigning&nbsp;families of Poland, Hungary, Norway and France. In short,&nbsp;they became a considerable power in eastern Europe, and&nbsp;might be regarded as one of the claimants for the inheritance&nbsp;of the decrepit East Roman Empire. Unfortunately for the&nbsp;political future of this new state, its internal consolidation did&nbsp;not keep pace with its territorial expansion. In theory the&nbsp;whole Russian land was a gigantic family estate belonging to&nbsp;the Rurik dynasty, and each member of that great family&nbsp;considered himself entitled to a share of it. It had to be&nbsp;divided, therefore, into a number of independent principalities,&nbsp;but it continued to be loosely held together by the dynastic&nbsp;sentiment of the descendants of Rurik and by the patriarchal&nbsp;authority—a sort of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font0">—of the senior member of&nbsp;the family, called the grand-prince, who ruled in Kiev, “ the&nbsp;mother of Russian cities?’ His administrative authority was&nbsp;confined to his own principality, but when territorial disputes&nbsp;arose between two or more of his relations, his paternal influence&nbsp;was exercised in the interests of peace and justice. What&nbsp;added to the practical difficulties of this arrangement was that&nbsp;the post of grand-prince was not an hereditary dignity in the&nbsp;sense of descending from father to son, but was always to be&nbsp;held by the senior member of the dynasty; and in the subordinate principalities the same principle of succession was&nbsp;applied, so that reigning princes had to be frequently shifted&nbsp;about from one district to another, according as they could&nbsp;establish the strongest claim to vacant principalities. What&nbsp;constituted in this primitive system of inheritance the strength&nbsp;of a claim was often not easily determined, and even when&nbsp;the legal question was clear enough the law was not always&nbsp;respected by the contending parties. Hence family quarrels&nbsp;became very frequent. These princes were, in fact, men of&nbsp;like passions with ourselves, and acted as powerful men generally&nbsp;do in a rude state of society. Instead of conforming to abstract&nbsp;principles of public law and hereditary succession, they strove&nbsp;to enlarge their territories at the expense of their rivals, and&nbsp;to leave them at their death to their sons rather than to their&nbsp;brothers, nephews and more distant relations. In these&nbsp;circumstances, the traditional authority of the grand-prince,&nbsp;never very great, rapidly deefined, and the compEcated law&nbsp;of succession, never scrupulously respected, was gradually&nbsp;replaced by “ the good old rule, the simple plan, that he&nbsp;should take who has the power, and he should keep who can.”&nbsp;Yaroslav, sumamed the Great, a man of commanding person-aEty, was the last grand-prince who upheld vigorously the old&nbsp;system. After his death in 1054 the process of disintegration went&nbsp;on apace and the family feuds multipHed at an alarming rate.&nbsp;During the next 170 years (1054-1224) no less than 64 princi-paEties bad a more or less ephemeral existence, 293 princes put&nbsp;forward succession-claims, and their disputes led to 83 civil wars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During these interminable struggles of rival princes, Kiev, which had been so long the residence of the grand-prince and&nbsp;of the metropoEtan, was repeatedly taken by storm and&nbsp;ruthlessly pillaged, and finally the* whole vaUey of the Dnieper&nbsp;feU a prey to the marauding tribes of the steppe. Thereupon&nbsp;Russian colonization and poEtical influence retreated northwards, and from that time the continuous stream of Russian&nbsp;history is to be sought in the land where the Vikings first&nbsp;settled and in the adjoining basin of the upper Volga. Here&nbsp;new principaEties were founded and new agglomerations of prin-cipaEties came into existence, some of them having a grand-prince who no longer professed allegiance to Kiev. Thus&nbsp;appeared the grand-prince of.Suzdal or Vladimir, of Tver,&nbsp;of Ryazan and of Moscow—aU irreconcilable rivals with little&nbsp;or no feeEng of blood-relationship. The more ambitious and&nbsp;powerful among them aspired not to succeed but to subdue the&nbsp;others and to take possession of their territory, and the armed&nbsp;retainers, who were wont formerly to wander about as free&nbsp;lances, gave up their roving mode of Efe, settled down permanently in one principaEty, became landed proprietors, and&nbsp;sought to share as boyars the princes’ authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among the principaEties of that northern region the first place was long held by Novgorod. Since the days when Rurik&nbsp;had first chosen it as his headquarters, the little town&nbsp;on the Volkhov had grown into a great commercial&nbsp;city and a member of the Hanseatic league, and it had&nbsp;brought under subjection a vast expanse of territory, stretching from the shores of the Baltic to the Ural Mountains, and&nbsp;containing several subordinate towns, of which the principal&nbsp;were Pskov, Nizhniy-Novgorod and Vyatka. UnEke the&nbsp;ordinary Russian principaEties, it had a repubEcan rather than&nbsp;a monarchical form of government. Indeed, it was not so much&nbsp;a principaEty as a municipal repubEc of the Venetian type. It&nbsp;always had a prince, no doubt, but he was engaged by formal&nbsp;contract without much attention being paid to hereditary&nbsp;rights, and he was merely leader of the troops, while all the&nbsp;poEtical power remained in the hands of the civil officials and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vetche,</span><span class="font0"> a popular assembly which was called together in the&nbsp;market-place, as occasion required, by the tolEng of the great&nbsp;bell. Descendants of Rurik, impregnated with the pride of&nbsp;a dominant military caste, did not much like serving those&nbsp;truculent, wilful burghers, and some of them, after a time,&nbsp;voluntarily laid down their office and retired to more congenial&nbsp;surroundings. Those of them who tried to have their own way&nbsp;and came into conflict with the authorities had always to yield&nbsp;in the long run, and they were Eable to be treated very unceremoniously, so that the vulgar adage, “ If the prince is bad, into&nbsp;the mud with him!” became a maxim of state poEcy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There was here in the Russian land the germ of republicanism or constitutional monarchy, but it was not destined to be&nbsp;developed. The principaEty which was to become the nucleus&nbsp;of the future Russian empire was not Novgorod with its democratic institutions, but its eastern neighbour Moscow, in which&nbsp;the popular assembly played a very insignificant part, and the&nbsp;supreme law was the will of the prince. The opposition which&nbsp;he encountered came not from the burghers but from the boyars&nbsp;and the nobles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">II. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Mongol or Tatar Domination, 1238-1462.—</span><span class="font0">Between Moscow and Novgorod there was a long and bitter rivalry,&nbsp;breaking out occasionally into armed conflicts, and&nbsp;among the princes of the other principaEties the old&nbsp;struggle for precedence and territory w<sup>r</sup>ent on unceasingly until it was suddenly interrupted, in the&nbsp;first half of the thirteenth century, by the unexpected irruption&nbsp;of an irresistible foreign foe coming from the mysterious&nbsp;regions of the Far East. “ For our sins,” says the Russian&nbsp;chronicler of the time, “ unknown nations arrived. No one&nbsp;knew their origin or whence they came, or what reEgion they&nbsp;practised. That is known only to God, and perhaps to wise&nbsp;men learned in books.” The Russian princes first heard of&nbsp;them from the wild nomadic Polovtsi, who usually pillaged&nbsp;the Russian settlers on the frontier but who now preferred</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
