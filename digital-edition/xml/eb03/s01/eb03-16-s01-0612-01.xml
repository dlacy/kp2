the capital of the county of Wiltſhire in England, ſituated in W. Long. I. 55. N. Lat. 51. 3. This city owed its firſt rife to its cathedral, which was begun in 1219, and finiſhed in 1258. According to an eſtimate delivered in to Henry III. it coſt forty thouſand merks. It is a Gothic building, and is certainly the moſt elegant and regular in the kingdom. The doors and chapels are equal in number to the months, the windows to the days, and the pillars and pilaſters to the hours in a year. It is built in the form of a lantern, with a ſpire in the middle, and nothing but buttreſſes and glaſs windows on the outſide. The ſpire is the higheſt in the kingdom, being 410 feet, which is twice the height of the monument in London. The pillars and pilaſters in the church are of ſuſile marble; the art of making which is now either entirely loſt or little known. This magnificent church has lately undergone moſt beautiful alterations; with an addition of two fine windows, and an organ preſented by the king. The roof of the chapter-houſe, which is 50 feet in diameter and 150 in circumference, bears all upon one ſlender pillar, which is ſuch a curioſity as can hardly be matched in Europe. The turning of the weſtern road through the city in the reign of Edward III was a great advantage to it. The chancellorſhip of the moſt noble order of the garter, which is annexed to this fee, was firſt conferred on biſhop Richard Beauchamp. The hoſpital of St Michael’s, near this city, was founded by one of its biſhops. Dr Seth Ward, biſhop of this fee in the reign of Charles II. contributed greatly to the making the river Avon navigable to Chriſt-church in Hampſhire. The fame prelate, in 1683, built an hoſpital for the entertainment of the widows of poor clergymen. There are three other churches beſides the cathedral, which is without the liberty of the city, and a greater number of boarding ſchools, eſpecially for young ladies, than in any other town in England. Here is a manufacture of druggets, flannels, bonelace, and thoſe cloths called <hi rend="italic">Saliſbury whites;</hi> in conſideration of which, and its fairs, markets, aſſiſes, boarding-ſchools, and clergy, the city may be juſtly ſaid to be in a flouriſhing condition. It was incorporated by Henry III. and is governed by a mayor, high-ſteward, recorder, deputy-recorder, 24 aldermen, and 30 aſſiſtants or common-council men. The number of fouls is about 10, 000. A new council chamber is juſt now (June 1794) building here with proper courts of juſtice, by the earl of Radnor; to which Mr Huſſey is alſo a great benefactor. That quarter called the <hi rend="italic">cloſe,</hi> where the canons and prebendaries live, is like a fine city of itſelf. Here is an aſſembly for the ladies every Tueſday, and coaches ſet out from hence to London every day. In this town are ſeveral charity-ſchools; the expence of one of them</p><p>is entirely defrayed by the biſhop. The city gives title of earl to the noble family of Cecil.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SALISBURY Plain,</hi> the extenſive downs in Wiltſhire, which are thus denominated, form in ſummer one of the moſt delightful parts of Great Britain for extent and beauty. It extends 28 miles weſt of Weymouth, and 25 eaſt to Wincheſter; and in ſome places is near 40 miles in breadth. That part about Saliſbury is a chalky down, and is famous for feeding numerous flocks of ſheep. Conſiderable portions of this tract are now encloſing, the advantages of which are ſo great, that we hope the whole will undergo ſo beneficial an alteration.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
