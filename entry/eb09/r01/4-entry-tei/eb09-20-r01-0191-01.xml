                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Rab Ābā b. Yoseph b. Hāmā</hi> (Hōmō)—was, like his teacher
                    Rabbāh and his fellow-pupil Abayye, a scion of the house of Eli, on whom rested
                    the double curse of poverty and that none of them should reach old age (1 Sam.
                    ii. 31-36). According to T. B., <hi rend="italic">Rosh Hasshanah,</hi> 18a,
                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> See <hi

                            Hullin,</hi> 133a, catchwords </note> he sought to remove this curse, if
                    not by sacrifices and offering then by the study of the Law, while Abayye also
                    practised works of charity. Rābā was rabbi and judge of the congregation and
                    head of the school <hi rend="italic">(methibtā)</hi> of Maḥūzā. He lived in the
                    middle of the 4th Christian century, and became on the death of his fellow-pupil
                    Abayye head of the famous academy of Pum-badithā, which was only closed in 1040.
                    He was noted, like his predecessor, for his genius ; and the discussions between
                    them (and similar ones of others) are known in the Babylonian Talmud as the <hi
                        rend="italic">Havayoth de-Abayye ve-Rābā (Sukkah,</hi> 28a). Rābā was also
                    noted for the liberality of his religious decisions (T. B., <hi rend="italic"
                        >Berakhoth,</hi> 22b ; <hi rend="italic">Pesahim,</hi> 30a, and elsewhere).
                    Being a man of considerable wealth, he showed, in accordance with Scriptural
                    truth (Prov. xviii. 23), his independence in every way. Thus he hesitated not to
                    include the exquisites of the congregation of Maḥūzā, who were noted for their
                    luxurious style of living, among the candidates for Gehenna, whose faces would
                    one day become as dark as the sides and the bottom of a sauce-pan (T. B., <hi
                        rend="italic">Rosh Hasshanah,</hi> 17a), whilst he most un gal-lantly
                    applied to their idle wives the passage of Amos iv. 1 (T. B., <hi rend="italic"
                        >Shabbath,</hi> 32b). Rābā was in fact the Abraham a Sancta Clara of his
                    day, minus the cloister life of the latter. He was married to one of the
                    beautiful, accomplished, and amiable daughters of his teacher, R. Hisdä, whom he
                    so dearly loved that he was ready to forgive Bar Hadyä (an interpreter of dreams
                    who had much vexed him by his adverse interpretations) everything except the
                    interpretation of a dream foreboding her death. Rābā, relying on Gen. xli. 12,
                    13, believed that the fulfilment of dreams within certain limits was influenced
                    by the interpretation given to them (T. B., <hi rend="italic">Berakhoth,</hi>
                    55b). (s. M. s.-s.)</p>            </div>
