In 1668 he was admitted archdeacon of Canterbury, upon the king’s presentation. In 1677, being now prolocutor of the convocation, he was unexpectedly advanced to the archbishopric of Canterbury. In 1687 he was committed to the Tower, with six other bishops, for presenting a petition to the king against reading the declaration of indulgence. Upon King James II.'s withdrawing himself, he concurred with the lords in a declaration to the Prince of Orange for a free parliament, and due indulgence to the Protestant dissenters. But when that prince and his consort were declared king and queen, his grace refused to take the oath to their majesties, and was suspended and deprived. He lived in a very private manner till his death, which took place in 1693. His learning, integrity, and piety, made him an exalted ornament of the church. He published a volume in 12mo, entitled Modern Politics, taken from Machiavelli and other select authors ; and also Familiar Letters to Mr North. Three of his sermons were printed together after his death.</p><p>SANCTIFICATION, the act of sanctifying, or rendering a thing holy. The reformed divines define sanctification to be an act of God’s grace, by which a person’s desires and affections are alienated from the world ; and by which he is made to die to sin, and to live to righteousness, or, in other words, to feel an abhorrence of all vice, and a love of religion and virtue.</p><p>SANCTION, the authority given to a judicial act, by which it becomes legal and authentic.</p><p>SANCTORIUS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sanctorio,</hi> an ingenious and learned physician, was professor in the university of Padua in the beginning of the seventeenth century. He contrived a kind of statical chair, by means of which, after estimating the aliments received, and the sensible discharges, he was enabled to determine with great exactness the quantity of insensible perspiration, as well as what kind of victuals and drink increased or diminished it. On these experiments he erected a curious system, which he published under the title of <hi rend="italic">De Medicina Statica,</hi> and which has been translated into English by Dr Quincy. Sanctorius published several other treatises, which showed great abilities and learning.</p><p>SANCTUARY, among the Jews, called also <hi rend="italic">Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> or Holy of Holies, was the holiest and most retired part of the temple of Jerusalem, in which the ark of the covenant was preserved, and into which none but the high priest was allowed to enter, and that only once a year, to intercede for the people.</p><p>Some distinguish the sanctuary from the <hi rend="italic">Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> and maintain that the whole temple was called the sanctuary.</p><p>To try and examine any thing by the weight of the sanctuary, is to examine it by a just and equal scale ; because among the Jews it was the custom of the priests to keep stone weights, to serve as standards for regulating all weights by, though these were not at all different from the royal or profane weights.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sanctuary,</hi> in the Roman Catholic church, is also used for that part of the church in which the altar is placed, being encompassed with a rail or balustrade.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sanctuary,</hi> according to our ancient customs, is the same with asylum.</p><p>SAND, in <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> properly denotes small particles of siliceous stones.

In agriculture it seems to be the office of sand to render unctuous or clayey earths fertile, and fit to support vegetables, by making them more open and loose.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SAND-Stone,</hi> a compound stone, of which there are numerous varieties, arising not only from a difference of external appearance, but also from the nature and proportions of the constituent parts.

It is likewise the name of a sort of slipper worn by several congregations of reformed monks. This last consists of no more than a mere leathern sole, fastened with latches or buckles, all the rest of the foot being left bare. The Capuchins wear sandals, and the Recollects clogs ; the former being of leather, and the latter of wood.</p><p>SANDANAH <hi rend="smallcaps">Cape,</hi> the point of the high land that forms the north-eastern end of the island of Java, and the northern entrance of Baly Straits, on the west and northwest side.
