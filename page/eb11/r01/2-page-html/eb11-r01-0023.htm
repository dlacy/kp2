<p><span class="font1">derived from a theory, namely, that of the ordinary electrodynamic equations, which considers the velocity of the matter, or rather of the electrons associated with it, to be so small corn-pared with that of radiation that the square of the ratio of these&nbsp;velocities can be neglected. The formula above obtained is of&nbsp;general application, and shows that for high values of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">υ</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;pressure must fall off. It has been urged as an objection to&nbsp;the thermodynamic reversibility of a ray (§ 8) that the work&nbsp;of the radiant pressure exerted at its front is lost, as there is no&nbsp;obstacle to sustain it; but on an obstacle moving with the.&nbsp;velocity of the wave-front the pressure would vanish, so that&nbsp;this objection does not now hold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In every such case of an advancing perfect reflector the aggregate amplitude of the superposed incident and reflected&nbsp;wave-trains, of different wave-lengths and periods, will be&nbsp;represented by&nbsp;thus the appearance presented will be that of a train of waves&nbsp;each of length (1-υ∕c)2τ∕w, and progressing with the velocity&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">υ</span><span class="font1"> of the reflector, which travels at one of the nodes of the train.&nbsp;This slowly travelling wave-train corresponds to the stationary&nbsp;train which would be produced by a stationary perfect reflector;&nbsp;but the amplitude is now a varying quantity which, once&nbsp;uniform vibration has been fully established along any path,&nbsp;may itself be described as running on after the manner of a&nbsp;superposed wave-train of very great wave-length (c∕υ-1)2π∕</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font1">&nbsp;and of very great velocity </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c<sup>2</sup>∕υ. A</span><span class="font1"> somewhat similar state of&nbsp;things arises when a wave-train is incident on a stationary&nbsp;reflector very nearly normally, as may sometimes be seen with&nbsp;incoming rollers along a shelving beach; the visible disturbance at a reflecting ridge, arising from each single wave-crest,&nbsp;then rushes along the ridge at a speed which is at first sight&nbsp;surprising, as it is enormously in excess of the speed possible&nbsp;for any simple train of waves travelling into quiescent aether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3.  </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wien's</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Law. —Let</span><span class="font1"> us consider a spherical enclosure filled&nbsp;with radiation, and having walls of ideal perfectly reflecting&nbsp;quality so that none of the radiation can escape. If there is&nbsp;no material body inside it, any arbitrarily assigned constitution&nbsp;of this radiation will be permanent. Let us suppose that the&nbsp;radius </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a of</span><span class="font1"> the enclosure is shrinking with extremely small&nbsp;velocity </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">υ</span><span class="font1">. A ray inside it, incident at angle ι, will always be&nbsp;incident on the walls in its successive reflexions at the same&nbsp;angle, except as regards a negligible change due to the motion&nbsp;of the reflector (§ 2); and the length of its path between successive&nbsp;reflexions is 2</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> cos </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ι.</span><span class="font1"> Each undulation on this ray will thus&nbsp;undergo reflexion at intervals of time equal to 2</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> cos ι </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">∕c,</span><span class="font1"> where&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1"> is the velocity </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">light, and it is easily verified that on each&nbsp;reflexion it is shortened by the fraction 2</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">υ</span><span class="font1"> cos </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ι∣c</span><span class="font1"> of itself: thus&nbsp;in the very long time T required to complete the shrinkage it is&nbsp;shortened by the fraction </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">υ</span><span class="font1">T</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1">, which is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">δa∣a</span><span class="font1"> where </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">δa</span><span class="font1"> is the&nbsp;total shrinkage in radius, and is independent of the value of ι.&nbsp;The wave-length of each undulation in the radiation inside the&nbsp;enclosure is therefore reduced in the same ratio as the radius.&nbsp;Now suppose that the constitution of the enclosed radiation&nbsp;corresponded initially to a definite temperature. During the&nbsp;shrinkage thermal equilibrium must be maintained among its&nbsp;constituents; otherwise there would be a running down of&nbsp;their energies towards uniformity of temperature, if material&nbsp;radiating bodies are present, which would be superposed on the&nbsp;mechanical operations belonging to the shrinkage, and the process&nbsp;could not be reversible. Such a state of affairs is not possible,&nbsp;for it would land us in processes of the following type. Expand&nbsp;the enclosure, gaining the mechanical work of the radiant&nbsp;pressure against its walls, whatever that may be. Then equalize&nbsp;the intensities of the constituent radiations to those corresponding to a common temperature, by taking advantage of the&nbsp;absorptions of material bodies at the actual temperatures of&nbsp;these radiations; when this is done, as it may actually be to&nbsp;some extent by aid of the sifting produced by partitions which&nbsp;transmit some kinds of radiation more rapidly than others, a&nbsp;further gain of work can be obtained at the expense of the&nbsp;radiant energy. Then contract the remaining radiant energy&nbsp;to its previous volume, which requires an expenditure of less&nbsp;work on the walls of the enclosure than the expansion of the&nbsp;greater amount of radiation originally afforded; and, finally,&nbsp;gain still more work by again equalizing the temperatures of&nbsp;its constituents. The energy now remaining, being of smaller&nbsp;amount and under similar conditions, must have a temperature&nbsp;lower than the initial one. This process might be repeated&nbsp;indefinitely, and would constitute an engine without an extraneous refrigerator, violating Carnot’s principle by deriving&nbsp;an unlimited supply of mechanical work from thermal sources&nbsp;at a uniform temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus, independently of any knowledge of the intensity of the mechanical pressure of radiation, or indeed of whether such&nbsp;a pressure exists at all, it is established that the shrinkage of the&nbsp;enclosure must directly transform the contained radiation to&nbsp;the constitution which corresponds to some definite new temperature. Now we have seen that the wave-lengths of its constituents&nbsp;are all reduced in the same ratio by this process. If, then, we&nbsp;can prove that the intensities of these constituents are also all&nbsp;changed in a common ratio by the reflexions at the shrinking&nbsp;envelope, it will follow that the distributions of the radiation&nbsp;among the various wave-lengths arc, at these two temperatures,&nbsp;and therefore at any two temperatures, homologous, in the sense&nbsp;that the intensity curves, after the wave-lengths in one of them&nbsp;have been reduced in a ratio depending definitely on the two&nbsp;temperatures, differ only in the absolute scale of magnitude&nbsp;of the ordinates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This procedure modifies Wien’s argument by employing a uniformly shrinking spherical enclosure (cf. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brit. Assoc. Report,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1900). If the enclosure is not spherical, the angles of incidence&nbsp;at successive reflexions of the same ray will differ by finite&nbsp;amounts; we must then estimate the average effect of the&nbsp;shrinkage. In the form of enclosure here employed all rays are&nbsp;affected alike, and no averaging is required; while by the&nbsp;principle of Stewart and Kirchhoff what is established for any&nbsp;one form is of general validity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pressure of Natural Radiation. —</span><span class="font1">The question reserved&nbsp;above has now to be settled. At first sight it might have&nbsp;appeared that the reflexion is simply total; but, as has been seen&nbsp;in § 2, the advancing perfect reflector does work against the&nbsp;pressure of the radiation, and this work must be changed into&nbsp;radiant energy and thus go to increase the intensity of the&nbsp;reflected ray. Considering electric radiation incident at angle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ι,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the tangential electric force is annulled at the reflector; hence&nbsp;the amplitude of the electric vibration is conserved on reflexion,&nbsp;though its phase is reversed. As already seen, the wave-length&nbsp;is shortened approximately by the fraction 2</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">υ</span><span class="font1"> cos </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ι/c</span><span class="font1"> in each&nbsp;reflexion; thus, just as in § 2, the energy transmitted per unit&nbsp;time per unit area is increased in the same ratio; and allowing&nbsp;for the factor cos </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ι</span><span class="font1"> of foreshortening, there is therefore a radiant&nbsp;pressure equal to the total density of radiant energy in front of&nbsp;the reflector multiplied by cos<sup>2</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ι</span><span class="font1">. This argument, being independent of the wave-length, applies to each constituent of the&nbsp;radiation in this direction separately; thus their energies arc&nbsp;all increased in the same ratio by the reflexion, as was to be&nbsp;proved. When we are dealing with the natural radiation in an&nbsp;enclosure, which is distributed equally in all directions, this&nbsp;factor cos<sup>2</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ι</span><span class="font1"> must be averaged; and we thus attain Boltzmann’s&nbsp;result that the radiant pressure is then one-third of the density&nbsp;of radiant energy in front of the reflector, this statement holding&nbsp;good as regards each constituent of the natural radiation taken&nbsp;separately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">5.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adiabatic Relations. —</span><span class="font1">Consider the enclosure filled with&nbsp;radiation of energy-density E at volume V, of any given constitution but devoid of special direction, and let it be shrunk to&nbsp;volume V-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">δ</span><span class="font1">V against its own pressure; if the density thereby&nbsp;become E - δE, the conservation of the energy requires</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">EV+⅓EδV=(E-δE)(V-δV), so that <sup>4</sup>/<sub>3</sub>EδV+VδE = 0, or E varies as V<sup>-⅘</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Again—but now with a restriction to radiation with its energy</span></p>
