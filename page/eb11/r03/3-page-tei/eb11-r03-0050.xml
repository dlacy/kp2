Rigaud, although he had obtained the Grand Prix, followed this advice, and for sixty-two years painted at the rate of thirty to forty portraits a year, all carried through with infinite care by his own hand. His portraits of himself, of the sculptor Desjardins (Louvre), of Mignard and of Le Brun (Louvre) may be cited as triumphs of a still more attractive, if less imposing, character than that displayed in his grand representations of Bossuet (Louvre) and Louis XIV. (Louvre), while his beautiful portraits of his mother, Marie Serre (Louvre), must for ever remain amongst the masterpieces of French art. Rigaud, although the great successes to which he owed his fame were won without exception in portraitpainting, persisted in pressing the Academy to admit him as an historical painter. This delayed his reception, and it was not until January 1700 that he succeeded in obtaining his desire. He presented as his diploma works a St Andrew (Louvre) and the portrait of Desjardins already mentioned, exhibited at the salon of 1704, and filled in turn all the various posts of academical distinction. He died on the 27th of December 1743, having never recovered from the shock of losing his wife in the previous year. He had many pupils, and his numerous works had the good fortune to be reproduced by the greatest of French engravers—Edelinck, Drevet, Wille, Audran and others.</p><p>RIGBY, RICHARD (1722-1788), English politician, was the only son of Richard Rigby (d. 1730) of Mistley Hall, Essex, a merchant who made a fortune through his connexion with the South Sea Company. Young Rigby became an associate of Frederick, prince of Wales, and entered parliament in 1745. He is chiefly known to fame through his connexion with John Russell, 4th duke of Bedford, and the “ Bloomsbury gang,” his audacity earning for him the title of the “ brazen boatswain ” of the “ crew.” In 1758 he became secretary to Bedford, who was lord lieutenant of Ireland, and in the following year he was given the sinecure office of master of the rolls for Ireland. Following the political fortunes of the duke he became vicetreasurer of Ireland in 1765, and in 1768 he obtained the lucrative position of paymaster-general of the forces. Rigby often spoke in parliament, and in 1769 he shared in the opposition to Wilkes. In 1784 he was obliged to resign his position as paymaster-general, and he was somewhat surprised and embarrassed when he was requested to pay over the large sum of public money which was in his possession. He left a great fortune when he died at Bath on the 8th of April 1788. A rapacious and unscrupulous politician, Wraxall says Rigby “ possessed talents for addressing a popular assembly which were sustained by a confidence that nothing could abash.”</p><p>RIGG, JAMES HARRISON (1821-1909), English Nonconformist divine, was born at Newcastle-On-Tyne on the 16th of January 1821. His father was a Wesleyan minister and sent his son to the Old Kingswood School, Bristol, where he subsequently became an assistant teacher. In 1845 he entered the Wesleyan ministry, and during the agitation of 1849-52 wrote successfully in exposition and defence of the polity of Methodism. In 1857 he published <hi rend="italic">Modern Anglican Theology, </hi>an acute criticism of the writings of Coleridge, Hare, Maurice, Kingsley and Jowett. The book was timely and well received, and though Kingsley at first resented the criticism he afterwards became a cordial friend of the writer. Rigg had now become a leading figure in his own church, and in 1868 was appointed Principal of the Westminster Wesleyan Training College for day-school teachers, a post which he held with growing distinction for 35 years. In 1870 he was elected on the first School Board for London, one of the most remarkable assemblies of modern times, and tool an important part in providing the syllabus of religious instruction and framing the religious settlement for teachers.</p><p>In 1873 he wrote <hi rend="italic">National EAttcation in its Social Conditions and Aspects.</hi>  A resolute opponent of secular education, he maintained that the state ought not to compete with the churches, but welcome their aid in the work of national education. He was also strongly against the adoption of a rigid universal code. In 1886 he sat on the Royal Commission of Education, and was brought into close contact with Matthew Arnold, and with Dean Stanley, Bishop Temple and other Anglican prelates, who held him in high esteem. In 1877 he became chairman of the second London district of Methodism, and for fourteen years helped to make the history of his church in the home counties. In 1878 he was elected president of conference— and again in 1892. From 1881 he was ministerial treasurer of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, taking an active part in its work. He resigned his principalship in 1903 and died at Brixton on the 17th of April 1909. Dr Rigg was universally honoured as the Nestor of Wesleyan Methodism, in the development of which he had taken a foremost part for over 60 years. His <hi rend="italic">Connexional Economy</hi>  is a standard work, and his <hi rend="italic">Living Wesley</hi>  a most discriminating study of the character and work of its subject. His <hi rend="italic">Oxford High Anglicanism</hi>  (1895) showed how keenly he followed modern developments in the Church of England. His lifelong principle was that Methodism is “ a church friendly to all, but owing allegiance to none.”</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>  by John Telford (London, 1909). </p><p>RIGGING (A.S. <hi rend="italic">wrigan</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">wrihan,</hi>  to clothe), the general term, in connexion with ships, for the whole apparatus of spars (including both masts and yards), sails and cordage, by which the force of the wind is utilized to move the hull against the resistance, and with the support, of the water. (See also <hi rend="smallcaps">Ship</hi>  and <hi rend="smallcaps">Shipbuilding).</hi>  The word is often used as meaning the cordage only, but this is a too limited, and even an irrational, use of the term. A ship is not rigged until she is provided with all the spars, sails and cordage required to move and control the hull. The straight or curved pieces of wood or metal, called davits, from which the boats carried along the bulwarks are hung, belong to the rigging. All are  fastened directly or indirectly to the huU, and allare required to complete her “clothing.” Vessels of aU classes,from the smallest sailing-boat up to the largest ship, are classed according to the particular combination of their spars, sails and cordage. “ Cutter,” “ brig,” or “ ship,” are only convenient abbreviations for “ cutter-rigged,” “ brig-rigged,” or “ ship-rigged.” They are of such or such a “ rig.” It is strictly correct to speak of the rigging of a mast or a yard, or of a boom, when all that is meant is the special set of ropes, of whatever size or material, required to keep them in their place, or withdraw them from it, when they have to be moved in the ship. In such cases the part is looked upon as a whole, and is mentally abstracted from the total of the vessel’s rigging.</p><p>The basis of all rigging is the mast (ç.r.), whether it be composed of one or of many pieces of wood or metal. The mast is held up and controlled by ropes, which are classed together as the “ standing rigging,” because they are “ that part (of the whole rigging) which is made fast, and not hauled upon ” (Admiral Smyth, <hi rend="italic">Sailors Word-Book).</hi>  This must be understood subject to the restriction that in the case of a mast composed of several parts, including topmast and topgallant mast, these subdivisions may be, and often are, lowered. The backstays, and other ropes which keep the top and topgallant masts in place, are therefore only “ comparative fixtures. ” The bowsprit, though it does not rise from the deck but projects from the bow, is in fact a mast. The masts, including the bowsprit, support all the sails, whether they hang from the “ yards,” which are spars slung to the mast, or from “ gaffs,” which are spars projecting from the mast, or, as in the case of the “ jibs,” are triangular sails, travelling on ropes called “ stays,” which go from the foremast to the bowsprit and suspended by halliards.The bowsprit is subdivided like other masts. The bowsprit proper corresponds to the lower fore-, main- or mizzenmast. The jib-boom, which is movable and projects beyond the bowsprit, corresponds to a topmast; the flying jib-boom, which also is movable and projects beyond the jib-boom, answers to a topgallant mast. The whole body of ropes by which the yards, booms and sails are manipulated</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
