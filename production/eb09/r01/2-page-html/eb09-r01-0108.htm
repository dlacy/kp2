<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the Etrurians, called in their Umbrian neighbours and eventually departed, leaving the city to their allies. Throughout the valley&nbsp;of the Po the Gauls took the place of the Etrurians as a conquering power ; but Ravenna may possibly have retained its Umbrian&nbsp;character until, about the year 191 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c., </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">by the conquest of the&nbsp;Boii the whole of this region passed definitely under the dominion&nbsp;of Rome. Either as a colonia or a municipium, Ravenna remained&nbsp;for more than two centuries an inconsiderable city of Gallia Cis-alpina, chiefly noticeable as the place to which Caesar during his&nbsp;ten years’ command in Gaul frequently resorted in order to confer&nbsp;with his friends from Rome. At length under Augustus it suddenly&nbsp;rose into importance, when that emperor selected it as the station&nbsp;for his fleet on “the upper sea.” Two hundred and fifty ships,&nbsp;said Dion (in a lost passage quoted by Jordanes), could ride at&nbsp;anchor in its harbour. Strabo, writing probably a few years after&nbsp;Ravenna had been thus selected as a naval arsenal, gives us a&nbsp;description of its appearance which certainly corresponds more&nbsp;closely with modern Venice than with modern Ravenna. “It is&nbsp;the largest of all the cities built in the lagunes, but entirely composed of wooden houses, penetrated in all directions by canals,&nbsp;wherefore bridges and boats are needed for the wayfarer. At the&nbsp;flow of the tide a large part of the sea comes sweeping into it, and&nbsp;thus, while all the muddy deposit of the rivers is swept away, the&nbsp;malaria is at the same time removed, and by this means the city&nbsp;enjoys so good a sanitary reputation that the Government has&nbsp;fixed on it as a place for the reception and training of gladiators.”&nbsp;On the other hand, good water was proverbially difficult to obtain&nbsp;at Ravenna,—dearer than wine, says Martial, who has two epigrams&nbsp;on the subject. And Sidonius, writing in the 5th century, complains bitterly of the “feculent gruel” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(cloacalis puls)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> which filled&nbsp;the canals of the city, and which gave forth fetid odours when&nbsp;stirred by the poles of the bargemen. The port of Ravenna,&nbsp;situated about 3 miles from the city, was named Classis. A long&nbsp;line of houses called Caesarea connected it with Ravenna, and in&nbsp;process of time there was such a continuous series of buildings that&nbsp;the three towns seemed like one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The great historical impoi־tance of Ravenna begins early in the 5th century, when Honorius, alarmed by the progress of Alaric in&nbsp;the north of Italy, transferred his court to the city in the lagunes.&nbsp;From this date (c. 402) to the fall of the Western empire in 476&nbsp;Ravenna was, though not the exclusive, the chief residence of the&nbsp;Roman emperors and the centre of the elaborate machinery of the&nbsp;state. Here Stilicho was slain ; here Honorius and his sister&nbsp;Placidia caressed and quarrelled ; here Valentinian III. spent the&nbsp;greater part of his useless life; here Majorian w<sup>r</sup>as proclaimed;&nbsp;here the Little Romulus donned his purple robe ; here in the pine-wood@@<sup>1</sup> outside the city his uncle Paulus received his decisive defeat&nbsp;from Odoacer. Through all these changes Ravenna maintained its&nbsp;character as an impregnable “city in the sea,” not easily to be&nbsp;attacked even by a naval power on account of the shallowness and&nbsp;devious nature of the channels by which it had to be approached.&nbsp;On becoming supreme ruler of Italy Odoacer, like the emperors&nbsp;who had gone before him, made Ravenna his chief place of&nbsp;residence, and here after thirteen years of kingship he shut himself&nbsp;up when Theodoric the Ostrogoth had invaded Italy and defeated&nbsp;him in two battles. Theodorie’s siege of Ravenna lasted for three&nbsp;years (489-492) and was marked by one bloody encounter in the&nbsp;pine-wood on the east of it. The Ostrogoth collected a fleet and&nbsp;established a severe blockade, which at length caused Odoacer to&nbsp;surrender the city. The terms, arranged through the intervention&nbsp;of John, archbishop of Ravenna, were not observed by Theodoric,&nbsp;who, ten days after his entry into the city, slew his rival at a&nbsp;banquet in the palace of the Laurel Grove (15th March 493).&nbsp;Ravenna was Theodoric’s chief place of residence, and the thirty-three years of the reign of the great Ostrogoth (493-526) may probably be considered the time of its greatest splendour. In the&nbsp;eastern part of the city he built for himself a large palace, which&nbsp;probably occupied about a sixth of the space now enclosed within&nbsp;the city walls, or nearly the whole of the rectangle enclosed by&nbsp;Strada di Porta Alberoni on the south, Strada Nuova di Porta&nbsp;Serrata on. the west, and the line of the city walls on the north&nbsp;and east. There still remains close to the first-named street and&nbsp;fronting the Corso Garibaldi a high wall built of square Roman&nbsp;bricks, with pillars and arched recesses in the upper portion, which&nbsp;goes by the name of Palazzo di Teodorico. Freeman, on account of&nbsp;the Romanesque character of the architecture, thinks it probable&nbsp;that it really belongs to the time of the Lombard kings; but at&nbsp;any rate it is of the very early mediré val period, and it marks the&nbsp;spot where part of the Ostrogothic palace once stood. A more&nbsp;memorable and clearly authentic monument of Theodoric is furnished by his tomb, a massive mausoleum in the style of the tomb&nbsp;of Hadrian at Rome, which stands still perfect outside the walls&nbsp;near the north-east corner of the city. It is of circular shape and&nbsp;surmounted by an enormous monolith, brought from the quarries&nbsp;of Istria and weighing more than 300 tons. In this mausoleum&nbsp;Theodoric was buried, but his body was cast forth from it, perhaps&nbsp;during the troublous times of the siege of Ravenna by the imperial&nbsp;troops, and the Rotunda (as it is now generally called) was converted into a church dedicated to the Virgin.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> The great pine-wood to the east of the city, which, though injured by an unusually severe winter and threatened by a projected railway,&nbsp;is still one of the great glories of Ravenna, must therefore have been&nbsp;in existence already in the 5th century. Byi-on’s description,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">“ [The] immemorial wood Rooted where once the Adrian wave flowed o’er,”&nbsp;is probably true ; but there is no evidence that it was in historic time&nbsp;that this change took place. Our conjecture is that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pineta</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">grew&nbsp;on a large peninsula somewhat resembling the Lido of Venice.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Nine years after the death of Theodoric Justinian sent an army to Italy, nominally in order to avenge the murder of Theodoric’s&nbsp;daughter Amalasuntlia, but in fact to destroy the Gothic monarchy&nbsp;and restore Italy to the empire. Long after the Goths had lost&nbsp;Rome they still clung to Ravenna, till at length, weary of the&nbsp;feebleness and ill-success of their own kin״, Vitiges, and struck&nbsp;with admiration of their heroic conqueror, they offered to transfer&nbsp;their allegiance to Belisarius on condition of his assuming the&nbsp;diadem of the Western empire. Belisarius dallied with the proposal until he had obtained an entrance for himself and his troops&nbsp;within the walls of the capital, and then threw off the mask and&nbsp;proclaimed his inviolable fidelity to Justinian. Thus in the year&nbsp;540 was Ravenna re-united to the Roman empire. Its connexion&nbsp;with that empire—or, in other words, its dependence upon Constantinople—lasted for more than 200 years, during which period,&nbsp;under the rule of Narses and his successors the exarchs, Ravenna&nbsp;was the seat of Byzantine dominion in Italy. In 728 the Lombard&nbsp;king Luitprand took the suburb Classis ; about 752 the city itself&nbsp;fell into the hands of his successor Aistulf, from whom a few years&nbsp;after it was wrested by Pippin, king of the Franks. By this time&nbsp;the former splendour of the city had probably in great measure&nbsp;departed ; the alteration of the coast-line and the filling up of the&nbsp;lagunes which make it now practically an inland city had probably&nbsp;commenced, and no historical importance attaches to its subsequent&nbsp;fortunes. It formed part of the Frankish king’s donation to the&nbsp;pope in the middle of the 8th century. It was an independent&nbsp;republic, generally taking the Guelf side in the 13th century,&nbsp;subject to rulers of the house of Polentani in the 14th, Venetian in&nbsp;the 15th (1441), and papal again in the 16th,—Pope Julius II.&nbsp;having succeeded in wresting it from the hands of the Venetians.&nbsp;From this time (1509) down to our own days, except for the interruptions caused by the wars of the French Revolution, Ravenna&nbsp;continued subject to the papal see and was governed by a cardinal&nbsp;legate. In 1859 it w<sup>r</sup>as one of the first cities to give its vote in&nbsp;favour of Italian unity, and it has since then formed a part of the&nbsp;kingdom of Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">At the beginning of the period thus rapidly sketched Charles the Great visited the city and carried off the brazen statue of Theodoric&nbsp;and the marble columns of his palace to his own new palace at Aix-la-Chapelle. More than five centuries later (1320) Dante became&nbsp;the guest of Guido Novello di Polenta, lord of Ravenna, and here&nbsp;he died on the 14th September of the following year. The marble&nbsp;urn containing the body of the poet still rests at Ravenna, where&nbsp;■what Byron calls “a little cupola more neat than solemn” has&nbsp;been erected over it. In 1512 the French army under Gaston de&nbsp;Foix fought a fierce báttle with the Spanish, Venetian, and papal&nbsp;troops on the banks of the Ronco about 2 miles from Ravenna.&nbsp;The French were victorious, but Gaston fell in the act of pursuing&nbsp;the enemy. His death is commemorated by the Colonna dei&nbsp;Frances! erected on the spot where he fell. Lord Byron resided at&nbsp;Ravenna for eighteen months in 1820-21, attracted by the charms&nbsp;of the countess Guiccioli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Literature.—</span><span class="font1">The most important authority for the history of Ravenna is Bishop Agnellus, who wrote about 840, in very bad Latin, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Liber Pontificalis&nbsp;Ecclesix Ravennatis.</span><span class="font1"> It is printed in vol. ii. of Muratori’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Per. Ital. Scriptores,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">but much the best edition is that by Holder-Egger in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Monumenta Germanise&nbsp;Histórica</span><span class="font1"> (1878). Rubeus </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Hist. Ravennatum IAhri Decern,</span><span class="font1"> Venice, 1599) seems&nbsp;to have had access to some authorities besides Agnellus which are now&nbsp;lost. Ciampini </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Vetera Monumenta,</span><span class="font1"> 1690-99, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Synopsis Histórica,</span><span class="font1"> 1693) gives&nbsp;some fair representations of the mosaics, and Quast’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ravenna</span><span class="font1"> (Berlin, 1842) is&nbsp;a careful and well-illustrated monograph. Dr Ricci, in a popular guide, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ravenna e i tntoi Dintorni</span><span class="font1"> (187S), has included some of the results of a very careful&nbsp;study of the antiquities of his native city. Professor Freeman’s essay </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Goths at Ravenna</span><span class="font1"> is the best account in English of the city in its historical&nbsp;connexion, and Mr J. A. Symonds in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sketches in Italy and Greece</span><span class="font1"> has gracefully touched on its picturesque qualities and literary associations.

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAVENSBURG, an industrial town of Wiirtemberg, is pleasantly situated amid vine-clad hills on the small&nbsp;river Scliussen, 12 miles to the north of Friedrichshafen&nbsp;on the Lake of Constance. Its aspect is quaint and&nbsp;mediaeval, and above its houses rise nine picturesque&nbsp;towers, the most prominent of ־which, dating from the&nbsp;15th century, is known as the “ Mehlsack ” or sack oi&nbsp;flour. The town-house is also a 15th-century building.&nbsp;The industrial products of Ravensburg are varied, includ-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
