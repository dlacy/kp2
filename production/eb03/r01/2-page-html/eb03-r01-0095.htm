<p><span class="font3">jurions to </span><span class="font2">ſociety. If religion oſ any kind has ever Ieſſened the virtue or diſturbed the peace oſ men, it&nbsp;muſt have been that religion which ſprings from a belief in a multitude of ſuperior powers actuated by paf-fιons, and of whom fome were conceived as benevolent&nbsp;and others as malicious beings. That fuch ſentiments&nbsp;ſhould have produced vices unknown in ſocieties where&nbsp;pure theiſm is profeſſed, will be readily admitted. Even&nbsp;the few </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">atheifis</span><span class="font2"> who live in Chriſtian or Mahometan&nbsp;countries are reſtrained by the laws, by a deſire to promote the honour of the ſect, and by many other confiderations, from indulging in practices which the ex-ample of the falſe gods of antiquity ſanctioned in their&nbsp;votaries. But in determining the preſent queſtion, we&nbsp;muſt not compare the virtues of the pagan world with&nbsp;thoſe of individual atheiſts in modern Europe, but with&nbsp;thoſe of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nations</span><span class="font2"> profeſſing atheiſm ; and ſuch nations&nbsp;are nowhere to be found. We can however eaſily conceive, that in a ſociety unawed by any notions of God&nbsp;or a future ſtate, no ſuch laws would be enacted as&nbsp;thoſe which reſtrain the ſenſual appetites ; of which the&nbsp;criminal indulgence was one of the greateſt ſtigmas on&nbsp;the pagan worſhip of antiquity. In ſuch ſocieties,&nbsp;therefore, thoſe vices would be practiſed conſtantly to&nbsp;which paganiſm gave only an occaſional ſanction ; and&nbsp;many others, in ſpite of the utmoſt vigilance of human&nbsp;Iaws, would be perpetrated in ſecret, which the moſt&nbsp;profligate pagans viewed with horror. Conſcience,&nbsp;though acting with all her energy, would not be able&nbsp;to command any regard to the laws of morality :&nbsp;No virtue would be known ; focial order would be nowhere obſerved; the midnight aſſaffin would every where&nbsp;be found ; and in the general ſcramble mankind would&nbsp;be exterminated from the face of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The worſt ſpecies of paganifm, even that which pre-vails among ſavages who worſhip evil ſpirits, affords greater ſecurity than this. It is indeed ſhocking to&nbsp;think that demons ſhould be Worſhipped, while deities,&nbsp;who are regarded as being all benevolence, are treated&nbsp;with contempt: And it has been aſked, If the influence&nbsp;of ſuch religious ſentiments on the moral practice of&nbsp;the idolaters muſt not naturally be, to cauſe them to&nbsp;treat their friends and benefactors with ingratitude, and&nbsp;to humble themſelves with mean ſubmiſſion before a&nbsp;powerful enemy ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They do not appear to have produced ſuch effects </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">on </span><span class="font2">the morality of the ſavages by whom they were entertained. The benevolent deities were neglected, only&nbsp;becauſe their benevolence was neceſſary. A voluntary&nbsp;iavour merits a grateful return : a deſigned injury provokes reſentment. But when you become, by accident,&nbsp;the inſtrument of any man’s good fortune, the world&nbsp;will ſcarce conſider him as owing you any obligation :&nbsp;the ſtone which bruiſes your foot excites only a momentary emotion of reſentment. Thoſe gods who could&nbsp;not avoid doing good to men might not receive a pro-fuſion of thanks for their ſervices ; and yet a favohr&nbsp;conferred by an human benefactor commands the warm-</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">eft </span><span class="font2">gratitude. But thoſe rude tribes appear to have had&nbsp;fo much wiſdom âs to confer a lefs abſolute malice on&nbsp;their malcvolent deities, than the benevolence which&nbsp;-they attributed to their more amiable order of ſuperior&nbsp;beings : though the latter could not poffibly do them&nbsp;any thing but good, and that conſtantly ; yet the former were not under an equally indifpenſable neceffity of&nbsp;perſevering in depreſſing them under calamities. On&nbsp;their malevoIent deities they conferred a freedom of&nbsp;agency which they denied to the benevolent. No won-der, then, that they were more afliduous in paying their&nbsp;court to the one than to the other. They might with&nbsp;as much propriety have thought of being grateful to&nbsp;the boar or ſtag whoſe fleſh fupported them, as to deities who were always benevolent, becaufe they could&nbsp;not poſſibly be otherwiſe. Though negligent of ſuch.&nbsp;deitiete, this can ſcarce be thought to have had any ten»&nbsp;dency to render them ungrateful to benefactors like&nbsp;themfelves. And yet, it muſt not be diſſembled, thafc&nbsp;the American Indians, among whom ſuch religion»&nbsp;ſentiments have been found to prevail, are ſaid to be&nbsp;very little ſenſible to the emotions of gratitude. Ait&nbsp;Indian receives a preſent without thinking of making&nbsp;any grateful acknowledgments to the beſtower. He&nbsp;pleaſes his fancy or gratifies his appetite with what you&nbsp;have givcn, without feeming to conſider himſeif as under the ſmalleſt obligation to you for the gift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Tt may be doubted, however, whether this ſpirit of ingratitude originates from, or is only collateral with,&nbsp;that indifference which refuſes adoration and worſhip to&nbsp;the benevolent divinities. If the former be actually the&nbsp;cafe, we muſt acknowledge that thoſe religious notion's&nbsp;which we now conſider, though preferable to general&nbsp;atheiſm, are in this reſpect unfriendly to virtue. But&nbsp;if the Indians may be thought to owe the ingratitude&nbsp;for which they are diſtinguiſhed to the opinion which&nbsp;they entertain of the exiſtence of a benevolent order of&nbsp;deities, whofe benevolence is neceffary and involuntary,&nbsp;their ideas of the nature of their malevolent demons do&nbsp;not appear to have produced equal effects on their moral ſentiments. However ſubmiffive to thoſe dreaded&nbsp;beings, they are far from ſhowing the fame tame and&nbsp;cowardly fubmiſſion to their human enemies : towards&nbsp;them they ſeem rather to adopt the ſentiments of their&nbsp;demons. Inveterate rancour and brutal fury, inhuman&nbsp;cruelty and inconceivable cunning, are diſplayed in the&nbsp;hoſtilities of tribes at war ; and we know not, after all,&nbsp;if even theſe ſentiments do not owe ſomewhat of their&nbsp;force to the influence of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Yet let us remember that thefe fame Indians have not been always repreſented in ſo unamiable a light ;&nbsp;or, at leaſt, other qualities have been aſcribed to them&nbsp;which ſeem to be inconſiſtent with thoſe barbarous diſpoſitions. They have been deſcribed as peculiarly ſuſceptible of conjugal and parental love; and he who is&nbsp;ſo cannot be deſtitute of virtue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. But leaving the religion of ſavages, of which very little is known with certainty, let us proceed to examine what is the natural influence of that mixed ſyſtem&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">theology which repreſents to the imagination of men&nbsp;a number of fuperior and inferior divinities, actuated&nbsp;by the fame paſſions and feelings with themſelves, and&nbsp;often making uſe of their ſuperior power and knowledge&nbsp;for no other purpoſe but to enable them to violate the&nbsp;laws of moral order with impunity. This is the cele-brated polytheiſm of the Greeks and Romans, and moſt&nbsp;other nations of antiquity (ſee Polytheisλm). Could&nbsp;its influence be favourable to virtue ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At a firil view every perſon will readily declare, that ſuch a ſyſtem muſt have been friendly to profligacy. If&nbsp;you commit the government of the univerſe, and the&nbsp;inſpection </span><span class="font3">of </span><span class="font2">human ſociety, to a ſct </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">beings who are</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
