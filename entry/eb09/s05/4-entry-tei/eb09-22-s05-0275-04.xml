(See Feance, vol. ix. p. 513; Paris, vol. xviii. p. 281; and Universities.) The Sorbonne owes its origin and its name to Robert de Sorbon, a poor priest of Champagne, who, arriving in Paris about the beginning of the reign of St Louis, attained high repute by his sanctity and eloquence, and was appointed by the king to be his chaplain. Assisted by royal liberality, he built upon Mont Sainte-Geneviève a modest establishment in which were accommodated seven priests charged with the duty of teaching theology gratuitously; to this he added a college of preparatory studies, all under the direction of a provisor, under whom was an annual prior who had the actual management. The new institution was authorized by letters patent of 1255, and canonically sanctioned by Pope Alexander IV. in 1259. Destined originally for poor students, the Sorbonne soon became a meeting-place for all the students of the university of Paris, who resorted thither to hear the lectures of the most learned theologians of the period,—Guillaume de Saint Amour, Eudes de Douai, Laurent l’Anglais, Pierre d’Ailly. At the close of the century it was organized into a full faculty of theology, and under this definitive form it conferred bachelor’s, licentiate’s, and doctor’s degrees, and the severity of its examinations gave an exceptional value to its diplomas. The so-called “ thèse Sorbonique, ” instituted towards the beginning of the 14th century, became the type of its order by the length and difficulty of its tests. Ultimately the professors of the Sorbonne came to be resorted to, not only for lectures and examinations, but also for dogmatic decisions and judgments in canon law; the clergy of France and of the whole Catholic world had recourse to them in difficult cases, and the Curia Romana itself more than once laid its doubts before them, giving them the title of “ Concilium in Gallia subsistens. ” The Sorbonne took a leading part in the religious discussions which agitated France during the 16th and 18th centuries, and its influence thus inevitably extended to political questions. During the insanity of Charles VI. it helped to bring about the absolution of Jean Sans-Peur for the assassination of the duke of Orleans. Shortly afterwards it demanded and supported the condemnation of Joan of Arc; during the Reformation it was the animating spirit of all the persecutions directed against Protestants and unbelievers : without having advised the massacre of St Bartholomew, it did not hesitate to justify it, and it inflamed the League by its vigorous anathemas against Henry III. and the king of Navarre, hesitating to recognize the latter even after his abjuration. From this point dates the beginning of its decadence, and, when Richelieu in 1629 ordered the reconstruction of its church and buildings, the following prophetic couplet was circulated—</p><p>Instaurata ruet jamjam Sorbona. Caduca Dum fuit, inconcussa stetit ; renovata peribit.</p><p>The declaration of the clergy in 1682, which it subscribed, proved fatal to its authority with the Curia Romana ; it revived for a short time under Louis XV. during the struggle against Jansenism, but this was its last exploit ; it was suppressed like the old universities in 1790. To the Sorbonne belongs the glory of having introduced printing into France in 1469 : within its precincts it assigned quarters for Ulric Gering and two companions in which to set up their presses.</p><p>When the university of France was organized in 1808 the Sorbonne became the seat of the <hi rend="italic">académie</hi> of Paris ; and between 1816 and 1821 the faculties of theology, science, and literature were installed there with their libraries. All the great university functions are held within its great amphitheatre. Since 1861 there has annually been held in the Sorbonne at Easter an official congress in which are represented the learned societies of the departments ; there are five sections—those of archeology, history, the moral and political sciences, the physical sciences, geography,—which hold separate sittings. The fine arts form a sixth section, with a special organization.</p><p>A reconstruction of the buildings of the Sorbonne, pro</p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s05-0276" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0294.jp2"/><p>jected by Napoleon III., was begun in 1884, under the architectural direction of Nénot. The old church containing the tomb of Richelieu is to be retained on account of its artistic merit.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
