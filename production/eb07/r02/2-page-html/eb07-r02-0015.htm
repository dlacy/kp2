<p><span class="font1">√rf, for different channels, and should be a constant √&lt;Z</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">quantity in every case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Our author was aware, however, of a very specious objection to the close dependence of the resistance on the extent of the border, and that it might be said that a double border did not occasion a double resistance, unless the&nbsp;pressure on all the parts was the same. For it may be naturally, and it is generally, supposed, that the resistance will&nbsp;be greater when the pressure is greater. The friction, or&nbsp;resistance analogous to friction, may therefore be greater&nbsp;on an inch of the bottom than on an inch of the sides ; but&nbsp;M. d’Alembert and many others have demonstrated, that the&nbsp;paths of the filaments will be the same whatever be the pressures. This might serve to justify our ingenious author ;&nbsp;but he was determined to rest every thing on experiment.&nbsp;He therefore made an experiment on the oscillation of water&nbsp;in syphons, which we have repeated in the following form,&nbsp;which is affected by the same circumstances, and is susceptible of much greater precision, and of more extensive and&nbsp;important application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The two vessels ABCD, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">abed</span><span class="font1"> were connected by the&nbsp;syphon EFG</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gfe</span><span class="font1">, which turned round in the short tubes&nbsp;E and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font1"> without allowing&nbsp;any water to escape ; the&nbsp;axis of these tubes being in&nbsp;one straight line. The vessels were about ten inches&nbsp;deep, and the branches FG,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">/7 of the syphon were about five feet long. The vessels&nbsp;were set on two tables of&nbsp;equal height, and (the hole&nbsp;e being stopped) the vessel&nbsp;ABCD, and the whole syphon, were filled with water,&nbsp;and water was poured into&nbsp;the vessel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">abed</span><span class="font1"> till it stood at a certain height LM. The&nbsp;syphon was then turned into a horizontal position, and the&nbsp;plug drawn out of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font1">, and the time carefully noted which&nbsp;the water employed in rising to the level HK </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kh</span><span class="font1"> in both&nbsp;vessels. The whole apparatus was now inclined so that&nbsp;the water ran back into ABCD. The syphon was now put&nbsp;in a vertical position, and the experiment was repeated.&nbsp;No sensible or regular difference was observed in the time.&nbsp;Yet in this experiment the pressure on the part </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gg</span><span class="font1"> of the&nbsp;syphon was more than six times greater than before. As&nbsp;it was thought that the friction on this small part (only six&nbsp;inches) was too small a portion of the whole obstruction,&nbsp;various additional obstructions were put into this part of the&nbsp;syphon, and it was even lengthened to nine feet ; but still&nbsp;no remarkable difference was observed. It was even thought&nbsp;that the times were less when the syphon was vertical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus Du Buat’s opinion is completely justified ; and he may be allowed to assert, that the resistance depends&nbsp;chiefly on the relation between the section and its border ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:line-through;">&quot;fr</span><span class="font1"> should be a constant quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">∙y∕ ll</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To ascertain this point was the object of the next series of experiments ; to see whether this quantity was really&nbsp;constant, and, if not, to discover the law of its variation,&nbsp;and the physical circumstances which accompanied the variations, and may therefore be considered as their causes&nbsp;A careful comparison of a very great number of experiments, made with the same slope, and with very different&nbsp;channels and velocities, showed that √</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mg</span><span class="font1"> did not follow&nbsp;the proportion of √</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d,</span><span class="font1"> nor of any power of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vd.</span><span class="font1"> This&nbsp;quantity </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">V mg</span><span class="font1"> increased by smaller degrees in proportion&nbsp;as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vd</span><span class="font1"> was greater. In very great beds V<sup>,</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mg</span><span class="font1"> was nearly&nbsp;proportional to √&lt;Z,∙ but in smaller channels, the velocities&nbsp;diminished much more than √</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1"> did. Casting about for&nbsp;some way of accommodation, Du Buat considered, that some&nbsp;approximation at least would be hail by taking off from&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">√d</span><span class="font1"> some constant small quantity. This is evident : for&nbsp;such a diminution will have but a trifling effect when </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">^Zd&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is great, and its effect will increase rapidly when √&lt;Z is&nbsp;very small. He therefore tried various values for this subtraction, and compared the results with the former experiments ; and he found, that if in every case √</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1"> be diminished by one tenth of an inch, the calculated discharges would&nbsp;agree very exactly with the experiment. Therefore, instead&nbsp;of √&lt;Z, he makes use of √rf—0∙1, and finds this quantity&nbsp;always proportional to √</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mg,</span><span class="font1"> or finds that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- <sup>18 a</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">constant quantity, or very nearly so. It varied from 297 to 287 in all sections, from that of a very small pipe to that&nbsp;of a little canal. In the large sections of canals and rivers&nbsp;it diminished still more, but never was less than 256.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This result is very agreeable to the most distinct notions that we can form of the mutual actions of the water and its&nbsp;bed. We see that when the motion of water is obstructed&nbsp;by a solid body, which deflects the passing filaments, the&nbsp;disturbance does not extend to any considerable distance&nbsp;on the two sides of the body. In like manner, the small&nbsp;disturbances, and imperceptible curvilineal motions, which&nbsp;are occasioned by the infinitesimal inequalities of the channel, must extend to a very small distance indeed from the&nbsp;sides and bottom of the channel. We know, too, that the&nbsp;mutual adhesion or attraction of water for the solid bodies&nbsp;which are moistened by it extends to a very small distance,&nbsp;which is probably the same, or nearly so, in all cases. Du&nbsp;Buat observed, that a surface of twenty-three square inches,&nbsp;applied to the surface of stagnant water, lifted 1601 grains;&nbsp;another of 5½ square inches lifted 365 ; this was at the rate&nbsp;of sixty-five grains per inch nearly, making a column of&nbsp;about one sixth of an inch high. Now this effect is very&nbsp;much analogous to a rcal contraction of the capacity of the&nbsp;channel. The water may be conceived as nearly stagnant&nbsp;to this small distance from the border of the section. Or,&nbsp;to speak more accurately, the diminution of the progressive&nbsp;velocity occasioned by the friction and adhesion of the sides&nbsp;decreases very rapidly as we recede from the sides, and&nbsp;ceases to be sensible at a very small distance.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
