From this habit is derived the German name <hi rend="italic">Rinder Staren, </hi>They are alſo accuſed of feeding on the carcaſes that are exposed on gibbets ; but it is probably in ſearch only of insects. They live ſeven or eight years, or even longer, in the domestic ſtate. The wild ones cannot be decoyed by the call, becauſe they regard not the ſcream of the owl. A method has been diſcovered of taking entire families, by fixing to the walls and the trees where they lodge pots of earthen ware of a convenient form, which the birds often prefer to place their neſts in. Many are alſo caught by the gin and draw-net. In ſome parts of Italy it is common to employ tame weaſels to drag them out of their neſts, or father their holes ; for the artifice of man conſiſts in employing one enslaved race to extend his dominion over the rest.</p><p>The ſtare, it is ſaid, can be taught to ſpeak either French, German, Latin, Greek, &amp;c. and to pronounce phraſes of ſome length. Its pliant throat accommodates itſelf to every inflection and every accent. It can readily articulate the letter R, and acquires a fort of warbling which is much ſuperior to its native ſong. This bird is ſpread through an extensive range in the ancient continent. It is found in Sweden, Germany, France, Italy, the Iſle of Malta, the Cape of Good Hope, arid is everywhere nearly the ſame ; whereas thoſe American birds which have been called ſtares, preſent a great diverſity of appearance.</p><p>STYE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Stythe,</hi> in the eye.

It is a picture of the ideas which rise in his mind, and of the order in which they are there produced.</p><p>The qualities of a good ſtyle may be ranked under two heads ; perspicuity and ornament. It will readily be admitted, that perſpicuity ought to be eſſentially connected with every kind of writing ; and to attain it, attention muſt be paid, firſt to single words and phraſes, and then to the conſtruction of ſentences. When conſidered with reſpect to words and phraſes, it requires theſe three qualities ; purity, propriety, and preciſion. When conſidered with regard to ſentences, it requires a clear arrangement of the words and unity in the ſenſe ; to which, if ſtrength and harmony be added, the ſtyle will become ornamented.</p><p>One of the moſt important directions to be obſerved by him who wiſhes to form a good ſtyle, is to acquire clear and preciſe ideas on the ſubject concerning which he is to write or ſpeak. To this muſt be added frequency of compoſition, and an acquaintance with the ſtyle of the beſt authors. A ſervile imitation, however, of any author is carefully to be avoided ; for he who copies, can hardly avoid copying faults as well as beauties. A ſtyle cannot be proper unleſs it be adapted to the ſubject, and likewiſe to the capacity of our hearers, it we are to ſpeak in public. A ſimple, clear, and unadorned ſtyle, ſuch as that of Swift, is fitteſt for intricate diſquiſition ; a ſtyle elegant as Addiſon’s, or impetuous like Johnson's, is moſt proper for fixing the attention on truths, which, though known, are too much neglected. We muſt not be inattentive to the ornaments of ſtyle, if we wiſh that our labours ſhould be read and admired : but he is a contemptible writer, who looks not beyond the dress of language, who lays not the chief ſtreſs upon his matter, and who does not regard ornament as a ſecondary and inferior recommendation.

The eyes are fixed on cylindrical pillars which lie cloſe together. The roſtrum, or narrow part which is terminated by the mouth, is connected to the back part of the head by a flexible leathery duplicature, which permits it either to be extended in ſuch a manner that the mouth points directly upwards, or to fall back ſo as to be received into a sort of caſe, formed by the upper part of the head. There are three pairs of branchiae lituate under tire throat.@@ The pectoral fins are ſmall; the dorſal fin runs from the head to within about an inch and a half of the tail ; the caudal fin is ſhort, and is furniſhed with five remarkable ſpines. The body is extremely long, and compreſſed very much, and gradually diminishes as it approaches the tail, which terminates in a proceſs or ſtring of an enormous length, and finiſhes in a very fine point. This ſtring, or caudal proceſs, ſeems to be ſtrengthened throughout its whole length, or at leaſt as far as the eye can trace it, by a fort of double fibre or internal part. The ſtylephorus chordatus is a native of the West Indian Sea. It was taken between the iſlands of Cuba and Martinico, near a ſmall duller of little iſlands about nine leagues from ſhore, and was ſeen ſwimming near the ſurface. The whole length of this uncommon animal from the head to the extremity of the caudal proceſs is about thirty-two inches, of which the proceſs itſelf meaſures twenty-two.</p><p>STYLET, a ſmall dangerous kind of poniard which may be concealed in the hand, chiefly uſed in treacherous aſſaſſinations.
