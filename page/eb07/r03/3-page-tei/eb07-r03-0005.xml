The town consists of three wide and airy streets; and as the situation, from being screened by lofty hills from the north and east winds, is favourable to invalids, and the Coquet is well adapted for trout-fishing, many persons resort thither during the summer months, for health and amusement. The rectory is one of the richest livings in the county. The church is an ancient structure. The population in 1831 amounted to 1014.</p><p>ROTHENBURG, a city of the kingdom of Bavaria, and the capital of the bailiwick of the same name, in the circle of the Rezat. It is situated on the river Tauber, and is surrounded by ancient walls and thirty-three towers. It is built in the antique German style, comprehends a fine council-house, with eight churches, and contains 1160 houses, with 6400 inhabitants. Its chief trade is in the productions of its vicinity.

It is the seat of the Catholic hierarchy of the whole kingdom, with six churches of that sect, and contains 620 houses, with 5450 inhabitants. It has some trade in paper, leather, and breweries.</hi></p><p>ROTHENFELS, a town of the kingdom of Bavaria, in the circle of the Lower Maine, and in a patrimonial bailiwick of the mediatized prince Lowenstein. It extends over eighty-four square miles, inhabited by 8500 persons. The town is situated on the river Maine, and contains 240 houses, with 1520 inhabitants, who are chiefly occupied in the cultivation of vines, and in making wine.</p><p>ROTHERHAM, a market-town of the west riding of the county of York, in the wapentake of Stratforth and Tickhill, 158 miles from London, and six from Sheffield. It is situated at the conflux of the rivers Rother and Don, which are navigable to Hull. There is a good market, which is held on Thursday. It is a considerable place for iron manufactures of the heavier kind. The population of the town amounted in 1801 to 3070, in 1811 to 2950, in 1821 to 3548, and in 1831 to 4083; but the parish contains eight other townships or hamlets, and the whole inhabitants, amounted in 1831 to 10,417.</p><p>ROTHSAY, a town in the island and county of Bute, in Scotland. See Bute.</p><p>ROTHWELL, or sometimes called Rowell, a town of the county of Northampton, in the hundred of the same name, seventy-nine miles from London. It has lost its market. The population amounted in 1801 to 1409, in 1811 to 1451, in 1821 to 1742, and in 1831 to 1875.</p><p>ROTONDO, or Rotundo, in <hi rend="italic">Architecture,</hi>  an appellation given to any building that is round both within and without, whether it be a church, a saloon, or the like. The most celebrated rotundo of the ancients is the Pantheon at Rome.</p><p>ROTTERDAM, a city of the kingdom of Holland, and the capital of the circle of its own name. It is situated on the right bank of the river Maese, which here receives the waters of the river Rotte. It is a well-built city, in an antique style, with abundance of fine and large houses, many of them five or six stories in height. The Boomjee, a row of houses facing the river, with a broad quay between, planted with trees, is perhaps one of the finest promenades in Europe. The city is intersected with canals, and by means of them the goods from ships are brought to the warehouses of the merchants, which are at the backs of their houses ; and by the same means the productions intended for exportation are brought to the several places of deposit.</p><p>The markets also are supplied from the country by means of these canals; and on the market-days, instead of the roads being filled with carts and waggons, the canals are crowded with country barges. These barges are drawn . more by men than horses, and indeed horses are rarely seen in the streets. Many of the public buildings are of a magnificent appearance. Amongst these, that of the defunct East India Company, now added to the customhouse, may be viewed with admiration. The house of the assembly of the ancient states of Zealand was built at an early period of the establishment of the independence of the United States. It is spacious, being in the most sumptuous style of the architecture of that age ; and when Bonaparte assumed the sovereignty of the country, it was decorated and furnished for his residence at the expense of the city. The ancient stadthouse has been appropriated to other than its original purpose ; atad a new modern building has been erected, whose portico, although massive, is elegant, as far as regards the pillars that support it. The ecclesiastical buildings belonging to the Calvinists are the most ancient and the largest, particularly the church of St Lawrence. It has an organ, lately erected, of the greatest power of any in existence, and said to contain eight hundred pipes more than the celebrated organ of Harlem. The Lutheran church is a large and fine building. There are three churches where the service is in English ; one for the Episcopalian, one for the Kirk of Scotland, and one for Independents, in the latter of which the celebrated Hugh Peters once officiated.</p><p>The trade of Rotterdam is very extensive. That to the West Indies, has declined of late years, but that to the East Indies, chiefly to Batavia, has been recently very beneficial ; and its commerce for the last fifteen years has increased more rapidly than that of any town in the kingdom. The fishery is an extensive source of employment and wealth. The trade with the Baltic employs much shipping, and affords moderate-priced corn for the distillers of gin. The business of ship-building employs many persons, both in the government arsenal and in the private docks; and the vessels now built are admirably constructed and equipped. The supply of colonial produce to the interior of Germany by the Rhine is very beneficial. The population of the city amounted in 1832 to 72,294. Long. 4. 29.14. E. Lat. 51. 55. 9. N.</p><p>ROTTINGDEAN, a village of the county of Sussex, in the hundred of Youngsmere, and rape of Lewes, fifty-six miles from London, and four from Brighton. It is situated on the sea-shore, between two cliffs, and is much resorted to in the summer season by bathing visitors who wish for retirement. The population amounted in 1801 to 543, in 1811 to 559, in 1821 to 772, and in 1831 to 880.</p><p>ROUBAIX, a large market-town of France, in the department of the North, and the arrondissement of Lisle. It is a place of extensive manufactories, formerly of woollens, but of late years almost exclusively of cottons. There are several mills for spinning; and a great quantity of quiltings, dimities, nankeens, and other cotton articles, are made, and of good quality. The town, in 1836, contained 18,187 inhabitants.</p><p>ROUEN, an arrondissement of the department of the Lower Seine, in France. It extends over 506 square miles, and comprehends fifteen cantons, divided into 155 communes, which, in 1836, contained 238,805 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name, situated in a valley on the banks of the Seine, over which there is a bridge of boats leading to the suburb St Sever. The river Robec passes through a part of the city, and falls into the Seine, and in its progress gives power to several mills and other machinery. It is not a well-built town, having many large but antique houses, and others of wood, with narrow and crooked streets. It is the see of an archbishop, whose cathedral, as</p></body></text></TEI>
