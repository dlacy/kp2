Religious opinions may lead the great body of the community to reverence ſome particular fet of inſtitutions, ſome individual, or ſome family, which are repreſented to them as peculiarly connected with the gods whom they adore. Under this ſanction ſome form ©f government is eſta-hliſhed ; they are taught to perform ſocial duties, and rendered capable of ſocial enjoyments. Not only Numa and Lycurgus, but almoſi every legiſlator who has fought to civilize a rude people, and reduce them under the reſtraints of legal government, have endeavoured to impreſs their people with an idea that they acted with the approbation, and under the immediate direction, of ſuperior powers, we cannot but allow that the rude ſuperſtitions of early ages are productive of theſe advantages to ſociety ; but we have already acknowledged, and it cannot be denied, that they are al-ſo attended with many unhappy effects, when we view the abſurdities intermixed with thc ſyſtems of religion which prevailed among moſt of the nations of antiquity, we cannot help lamenting that ſo noble a principle of human nature as our religious ſentiments ihould be liable to ſuch groſs perverfιon ; and when we view the effects which they produce on the morals of mankind, and the forms of ſociety, though we allow them to have been upon the whole rather beneficial than hurtful, yet we cannot but obſerve, that their unfavourable effects are by far more numerous than if they had been better directed, what unhappy effects, for inſtance,· have been produced by falſe notions concerning the condition of human ſouls in a future Rate, various nations have imagined that the ſcenes and objects of the world of ſpirits are only a ſhadow; repreſentation of the things of the prefent world. Not only the fouls of men, according to them, inhabit thoſe regions ; all the inferior animals and vegetables, and even inanimate bodies that are killed or deſtroyed here, are ſuppofed to paſs into that vifionary world ; and, exiſting there in unſubftantial forms, to execute the ſame functions, or feιve the ſame purpoſes, as on earth. Such are the ideas of futurity that were entertained by the inhabitants of Guinea. And by thefe ideas they were induced, when a king or great man died among them, to provide for his comfortable accommodation in the world • of ſpirits, by burying with him meat and drink ſor his fubſiſtence, ſtaves to attend and ſerve him, and wives with whom he might ſtill enjoy the pltaſures of love. His faithful ſubjects vied with each other in offering,</p><p>one a ſervant, another a wife, a third a ſon or daughter, to be ſent to the other world in company with the monarch, that they might there be employed in his 'ſervice. In New Spain, in the iſland cf Java, in the kingdom of Benen, and among the inhabitants of Is-doſtan, ſimilar practices on the ſame occaſion, owing no doubt to ſimilar notions of futurity, have been prevalent. But fuch practices as theſe cannot be viewed with greater contempt on account of the opinions ■which have given riſe to them, than horror on account of their unhappy effects on the condition of thole among whom they prevail. A lively impreffion of the cnjoyments to be obtained in a future ftate, together with fome very ſalfe or incorrect notions concerning the qualities or actions which were to entitle the departing ſoul to admiſſion into the ſcene of thoſe enjoyments, is ſaid to have produced equally ùnhappÿ effects among the Japaneſe. They not only bribed their prieſts to ſolicit for them ; but looking upon the enjoyments of the preſent life with diſguſt or contempt, they uſed to daſh themſelves from precipices, or cut their throats, in order to get to paradſſe as ſoon as poffible. Various other ſuperſtitions ſubſiſting among rude πa-tions might here be enumerated, as inſtances of the perverſion of the religious principles of the human heart, which render them injurious to virtue and happinefs. The auſterities which have been practiſed, chiefly among rude nations, as means of propitiating ſuperior powers, are eſpecially worthy of notice.— when the favourite idol of the Banians is carried in folemn proceſſion, fome devotees proſtrate themfelve‰ on the ground, that the chariot in which the idol is carried may run over them ; others, with equal enthu-ſtaſm, daſh themſelves on ſpikes faſtened on purpoſe to the car. Innumerable are tbe ways of torture which have been invented and practiſed on themielves by men ignorantly ſtriving to recommend themſelves to the favour of heaven. Theſe we lament as inſtances in which religious ſentiments have been ſo ill directed by the in-ſluence of imagination, and unenlightened erring reaſon, as to produce unfavourable effects on the human character, and oppofe the happineſs of ſocial life.·— Though we have argued, that even the moſt abſurd fy~ ſtems of religion that have prevailed in the world, have been upon the whole rather beneficial than injurious t¢f the dignity and happineſs of human nature ; yet if it ſtiall not appear, as we proceed farther in our comparative view of the effects of religion on ſociety, that others have been attended with happier effects than theie ſuperſtitions which belong to the rude ages of ſociety, we may ſcarce venture to brand the infidel with the ap-peliation of <hi rend="italic">fool,</hi>  for refuſing to give his affent to religious doctrines, or to act under their influence.</p><p>2d, The polytheſſm of the Greeks and Romans,, and cither heathen nations in a ſimilar ſtate oſ civilization, we have already conſidered as being, upon the whole, rather favourable than unfavourable to virtue; but we muſt not partially conceal its defects. The vicious characters of the deities which they worſhipped, the incorrect notions which they entertained concerning the moral government cf the univerſſe and a future re-tribution, the abſurdity of their rites and ceremonies,, and the criminal practices which were intermixed with them, muſt have altogether had a tendency to pervert both the reaſoning and the moral principles of the human mind. The debaucheries of the monarch of the gods, and the fdelity with which his example in that reſpect was followed by the whole crowd of the inferior deities, did, we know, diſpoſe the devout heathen, when he felt the ſame paſſions which had afferted thejr power over the gods, to gratify them without ſcruple. It is a truth, however, and we will not attempt to deny or conceal it, that tire genius of the polytheiſm of the Greeks and Romans was friendly to the arts ; to ſuch of them eſpecially as are raifed to excellence by the vi-goιous exertion of a fine imagination; muſic, poetry, ſeulpture, architecture, and pa ntmg, all of theſe arts appear to have been confiderably indebted for that perfection to whic∩ they attained, elpecially among the. Greeks, to the fplendid and fanciful ſyſtem of mytholo-gy. which was received among, that ingenious people. —</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
