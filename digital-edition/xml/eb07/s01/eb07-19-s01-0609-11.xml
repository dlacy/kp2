a town in the Burmese dominions, situated on the Irrawaddy, opposite to Ava, the capital. It is a large, straggling place, where the houses are of a mean description, and thinly scattered among groves of fruit-trees, with temples and monasteries innumerable. A considerable portion of the inhabitants are Cassay captives or their descendants. On the river face it has a brick-wall, which extends for about half a mile ; it is not above ten feet in height, but has a parapet and embrasures. To each flank of the brick-<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_665.jpf" xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0610"/>
wall there is a stockade of a paltry description. Inland it is quite defenceless. The town extends along the Irrawaddy about a mile and a half, but its breadth is inconsiderable. Over the site of the town and its environs arc innumerable temples, many of them ruinous and old, and also modern.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
