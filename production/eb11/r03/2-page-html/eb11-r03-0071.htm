<p><span class="font0">importance on the Quarahim river opposite the Uruguayan town of Santo Eugenio, and surrounded by a rich grazing country&nbsp;which supports one of the largest </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saladeros</span><span class="font0"> in the state; Sao&nbsp;Leopoldo; Santa Maria da Bocca do AIonte; and Uruguayana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The territory was first settled along the Uruguay river by the Jesuits when they were compelled to abandon their missions&nbsp;on the upper Paranâ. Between 1632 and 1707, they founded on&nbsp;the E. side of the Uruguay seven missions—all under Spanish&nbsp;jurisdiction—which became highly prosperous, and at the time&nbsp;of their transfer from Spanish to Portuguese rule by a treaty&nbsp;of 1750 had an aggregate population of about 14,000, living&nbsp;in villages and possessing large herds of cattle and many&nbsp;horses. A joint effort of the two powers in 1753 to enforce&nbsp;the treaty, remove the Indians to Spanish territory, and mark&nbsp;the boundary line, led to resistance and a three years’ war,&nbsp;which ended in the capture and partial destruction of the&nbsp;missions. On the coast the first recognized settlement—a&nbsp;military post at Estreito, near the present city of Rio Grande—&nbsp;was made in 1737. Before this, and as early as 1680, according&nbsp;to some chroniclers, the region S. of Santa Catharina was&nbsp;occupied by settlements, or penal colonies, of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">degradados&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(banished men) and immoral women from Santos, Sao Vicente&nbsp;and Sao Paulo, and was known as the “ Continente de Säo&nbsp;Pedro.” In 1738 the territory (which included the present&nbsp;state of Santa Catharina) became the Capitania d’El Rei and&nbsp;was made a dependency of Rio de Janeiro. Territorial disputes between Spain and Portugal led to the occupation by&nbsp;the Spanish of the town of Rio Grande (then the capital of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">capitania)</span><span class="font0"> and neighbouring districts from 1763 to 1776, when&nbsp;they reverted to the Portuguese. The capture of Rio Grande&nbsp;in 1763 caused the removal of the seat of government to Viamao&nbsp;at the head of Lagôa dos Patos; in 1773 Porto dos’Cazaes, renamed Porto Alegre, became the capital. In 1801 news of&nbsp;war between Spain and Portugal led the inhabitants of Rio&nbsp;Grande to attack and capture the seven missions and some&nbsp;frontier posts held by the Spaniards since 1763; since 1801&nbsp;the boundary fines established by treaty in 1777 have remained unchanged. The districts of Santa Catharina and&nbsp;Rio Grande had been separated in 1760 for military convenience,&nbsp;and in 1807 the latter was elevated to the category of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">capitania-geral,</span><span class="font0"> with the designation of “ Sao Pedro do Rio Grande,”&nbsp;independent of Rio de Janeiro, and with Santa Catharina as a&nbsp;dependency. In 1812 Rio Grande and Santa Catharina were&nbsp;organized into two distinct </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comarcas,</span><span class="font0"> the latter becoming an&nbsp;independent province in 1822 when the empire was organized.&nbsp;In 1835 a separatist revolution broke out in the province and&nbsp;lasted ten years. It was reduced more through the use of&nbsp;money and favours than by force of arms; but the province had&nbsp;suffered terribly in the struggle and did not recover its losses&nbsp;for many years. An incident in this contest was the enlistment of Garibaldi for a short time with the forces of the separatists. In 1865 a Paraguayan army invaded the state and on&nbsp;the 5th of August occupied the town of Uruguayana. On the&nbsp;18th of September following, the Paraguayan general (Esti-garribia) surrendered without a fight—an unusual occurrence&nbsp;in the remarkable war that followed. Political agitations have&nbsp;been frequent in Rio Grande do Sul, whose people have something of the temperament of their Spanish neighbours, but no&nbsp;important revolution occurred after the “ ten years’ war ”&nbsp;(1835-45) until the presidency at Rio de Janeiro of General&nbsp;Floriano Peixoto, whose ill-considered interference with the&nbsp;state governments led to the revolt of 1892-94, under Gumers-indo Saraiva. In this struggle the revolutionists occupied&nbsp;Santa Catharina and Paranâ, capturing Curityba, but were&nbsp;eventually overthrown through their inability to obtain&nbsp;munitions of war. An incident in this struggle was the death&nbsp;of Admiral Saldanha da Gama, one of the most brilliant officers&nbsp;of the Brazilian navy and one of the chiefs of the naval revolt&nbsp;of 1893-94, who was killed in a skirmish on the Uruguayan&nbsp;frontier at the close of the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIO GRANDE DO SUL, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sao Pedro do Rio Grande do Sul </span><span class="font0">(sometimes </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sao Pedro</span><span class="font0"> and commonly Rio </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Grande),</span><span class="font0"> a city and&nbsp;port of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, on the western&nbsp;side of the Rio Grande (as the outIet of the Lagôa dos Patos is&nbsp;called), about 6 m. from its mouth and nearly 780 m. S.W. of&nbsp;Rio de Janeiro, in lat. 32° 7' S., long. 52° 8' W. Pop. (1890)&nbsp;of the municipio (area, about 656 sq. m.) 24,653; of the city,&nbsp;including its suburbs, 20,193; (1900, estimate) of the city,&nbsp;22,000, and of the city and its suburbs, 30,000. Rio Grande&nbsp;is the coast terminus of the Rio Grande to Bage railway, which&nbsp;now forms part of the railway system of the state leased to&nbsp;the Belgian Compagnie Auxiliare de Chemin de Fer au Brésil.&nbsp;Some of the principal streets are served by tramways, and&nbsp;the Rio Grande to Bage railway has an extension to its shipping&nbsp;wharf called “ Estaçào AIaritima ” (1 j m.), a branch to some&nbsp;points on the river (1 j m.), and a branch to Costa do Alar, on&nbsp;the ocean coast (11 m.). The city is a port of call for several&nbsp;steamship fines, and has direct communication with European&nbsp;ports. The bar at the mouth of the river, however, restricts&nbsp;traffic to vessels of fight draught, not exceeding 12 to 15 ft. Extensive improvements, at an estimated cost of about 13J&nbsp;millions of dollars, were undertaken in 1908 for deepening&nbsp;the bar to admit vessels of 30 ft. draught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The city is built on a low sandy peninsula, barely 5 ft. above sea-level, formed by two arms of the Rio Grande projecting&nbsp;westward from the main channel, the peninsula being part of&nbsp;a large sandy plain extending southward along the coast to&nbsp;Lagôa Alirim. The level of the plain is broken by ranges of&nbsp;sand dunes, some of which rise not far from the city on the&nbsp;southland south-east. The openness of the surrounding country&nbsp;and the proximity of the sea give to Rio Grande unusually&nbsp;healthy conditions, which, however, are largely counteracted by&nbsp;defective sanitary arrangements. Not infrequently the deaths&nbsp;exceed the births, and epidemics of contagious diseases make&nbsp;deadly inroads upon the population. The city has been developed irregularly, but the streets are for the most part broad,&nbsp;and the principal ones are well paved. Gas fighting was&nbsp;introduced about 1871, and in 1908 acetylene was used for&nbsp;public lighting. In one of the public squares is a shaft commemorating the abolition of slavery, and said to be the only&nbsp;monument in Brazil of that character. There is a notable&nbsp;scarcity of shade trees in the streets and squares, though fiowers,&nbsp;shrubbery and some kinds of fruit trees are grown. In pleasing&nbsp;contrast to the drifting sands which surround the city is the&nbsp;fertile Ilha dos AIarinheiros (Sailor’s Island) lying directly in&nbsp;front of the port; it is highly cultivated and supplies the&nbsp;market with fruit and vegetables. The water-front has been&nbsp;improved by substantial stone walls, which permit the mooring&nbsp;of light-draught vessels alongside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among noteworthy public buildings and institutions are the municipal palace, the parochial church of Sao Pedro, dating from&nbsp;the 18th century, the modern church of N.S. de Bomfim, the beautiful Protestant Episcopal church (Gothic), the public hospital&nbsp;(Hospital de Caridade), the hospital of the Beneficencia Portugueza,&nbsp;the public library (Bibliotheca Riograndense), created and maintained by private effort and containing al&gt;out 30,000 volumes, the&nbsp;old custom-house and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quartel-geral</span><span class="font0"> (military, barracks). Rio&nbsp;Grande is wholly a commercial and industrial city. Its exports&nbsp;include salted jerked beef </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{carne secca.</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">xarque),</span><span class="font0"> preserved meats,&nbsp;tongues, hides, horns, hoofs, woollen fabrics, Paraguay tea, beans,&nbsp;onions, fruit, flour, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">farinha de mandioca</span><span class="font0"> (cassava flour), lard, soap,&nbsp;candles and leather. Its manufactures include cotton, woollen&nbsp;and jute fabrics, wheat flour, biscuits, cigars and cut tobacco, beer,&nbsp;artificial drinks, boots, shoes and sandals </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{alpergatas),</span><span class="font0"> soap and&nbsp;candles, fireworks, ice, earthenware, hats, cast-iron and leather.&nbsp;The pioneer woollen factory in Brazil, and one of the largest in the&nbsp;country, is in Rio Grande.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rio Grande was founded in 1737 by José da Silva Paes, who built a fort on the river near the site of the present city&nbsp;and called it Estreito. In 1745 the garrison and settlement&nbsp;was removed by Gomes Freire d’Andrade to its present site,&nbsp;which became a “ villa,” in 1751, with the name of Sao Pedro do&nbsp;Rio Grande, and a “ cidade ” (city) in 1807. It was the capital&nbsp;of the captaincy down to 1763, when it was captured by a&nbsp;Spanish force from Buenos Aires under the command of its&nbsp;governor, Don Pedro Zeballos, the seat of government being&nbsp;then removed to Viamao at the northern end of Lagôa dos</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
