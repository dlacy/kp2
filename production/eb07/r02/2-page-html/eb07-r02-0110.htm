<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rome, a city of Italy, formerly the capital of the greatest empire in the world, and still remarkable as the chief seat&nbsp;of the papal power, is situated on the river Tiber, in east long.&nbsp;13°, and north lat. 41° 45'.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To trace, even briefly, the rise and progress of this mighty city towards universal empire, would demand a voluminous&nbsp;history, especially were we to enter into disquisitions respecting the views which have been adopted in this article;&nbsp;but as our limits forbid such an attempt, we must content&nbsp;ourselves in a great measure with the statement of general&nbsp;results, with such occasional references as may enable our&nbsp;readers to investigate the subject at greater length ; and we&nbsp;think it fortunate, that many of the views which were held&nbsp;as mere paradoxes when first proposed by Niebuhr, may&nbsp;now be regarded as firmly established, and without hesitation followed as essentially correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the history of the various tribes, which, when united under the Roman name, formed one mighty nation, we must&nbsp;refer to the different heads under which, in other parts of&nbsp;this work, they are mentioned. The chief of these were&nbsp;the Oscan, probably the most ancient race that inhabited&nbsp;Italy ; the Pelasgian, under which designation may also be&nbsp;comprised the Tyrrhenian,@@<sup>1</sup> with its numerous branches ;&nbsp;and the Etrurian, which was marked by various features distinguishing it from both the other races, being also probably&nbsp;less ancient than either. From all that appears in history&nbsp;or tradition, the Oscan, Opican, Auruncan, and Ausonian,&nbsp;were the same race of people, and the earliest inhabitants of&nbsp;that part of Italy contained between Oenotria and Tyrrhenia, or the country of the Etruscans;@@<sup>2</sup> in a word, they were&nbsp;the original stock whence sprung several of the most powerful nations of Italy, as the Sabines or Sabellians, the Samnites, and others. The Pelasgi@@<sup>3</sup> appear to have been a branch&nbsp;of that once mighty race of whom traces may be discovered&nbsp;from the river Strymon, along the coast of Ionia, throughout Greece and its islands, and along the maritime shores of&nbsp;Italy. It was from their Pelasgic ancestors that the Romans derived the radical affinities which are found to connect the Italian language with that of Greece, both having had, at some remote period, a common origin. The&nbsp;Pelasgi seem to have driven the Oscan nations from the seacoast, back to the mountains, and in their turn to have been&nbsp;overpowered in part of their acquired territory by the Etruscans. The origin of this latter people is involved in obscurity hitherto impenetrable.@@<sup>4</sup> They display many traces of an&nbsp;oriental, or, as some think, of an Egyptian origin. We incline, for many reasons, to believe them of Phœnician extraction ; not merely the peculiarities of their alphabet, but&nbsp;those also of their religious rites, bearing a very close resemblance to the most ancient forms of the Phœnician language&nbsp;and religion. Itis probable that a careful investigation into tlle&nbsp;customs, laws, and religion of the ancient Etrusci, or rather</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Raseni, to use their own name, will ultimately prove them to have belonged to a race more ancient still than even the&nbsp;Phoenicians, that is, to the ancient oriental race whence the&nbsp;Phœnicians themselves derived their origin, their language,&nbsp;and religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Respecting the institutions of these primitive races, very little is known ; yet from that little, important conclusions&nbsp;may fairly be drawn. Both the Osci and the Pelasgi seem&nbsp;to have lived under the patriarchal form of government;&nbsp;the origin of which is to be traced to the paternal sway&nbsp;which a father naturally exercises over his household, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">tlle </span><span class="font1">head of a tribe, or number of households, over the whole&nbsp;collectively. The Etrusci, on tile other hand, appear to&nbsp;have adopted the system of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">castes,</span><span class="font1"> and especially to have&nbsp;been very much under the influence of a sacerdotal caste,&nbsp;which was of course hereditary, and which possessed almost&nbsp;unbounded influence over tlle rest of the nation. The effect of the combination of these natrons, and their peculiar&nbsp;institutions, in forming the character of the Roman people,&nbsp;will soon appear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rome itself is said to have been founded in the year 753b .c. This date, therefore, we shall assume as the most probable,&nbsp;if not absolutely authentic, and shall make it the basis of&nbsp;all subsequent chronological statements.@@<sup>5</sup> According to the&nbsp;fabulous accounts preserved by Livy, the founders and earliest inhabitants of Rome were of Trojan descent. Æneas&nbsp;is said to have led a colony of Trojans, after the destruction of Troy, through a series of perilous voyages and adventures, to the shores of Italy, near the mouth of the Tiber. Here he formed an alliance with Latinus, king of the&nbsp;adjoining country, received his daughter Lavinia in marriage,&nbsp;and built a town, called, from her name, Lavinium. A war,&nbsp;which soon afterwards arose between the new settlers and&nbsp;the Rutulians, terminated in the death of their king, Turnus,&nbsp;who was slain in battle by Æneas. Another war ensued&nbsp;between the Trojans and Mezentius, king of the Etruscans&nbsp;of Caere. In this war Æneas himself perished, having been&nbsp;drowned in the Numicius, into which he was forced in a&nbsp;disastrous battle, and was succeeded by his son Ascanius, or&nbsp;lulus. On the banks of the river where he disappeared,&nbsp;an altar was built in honour of him, and he was worshipped&nbsp;under the name of Jupiter Indiges. Mezentius soou afterwards fell by the hand of Ascanius, who thus obtained undisputed possession of the territory formerly held by Latinus. The Trojan settlers became completely incorporated&nbsp;with the people of the land, and from king Latinus they derived the common name of Latins. The thirty years had&nbsp;now elapsed dining which it had been predicted that the&nbsp;Trojan race were to inhabit their first town, Lavinium. They&nbsp;removed to a more propitious situation, and built a new&nbsp;town on a lofty ridge farther inland, which overlooks all the&nbsp;land around it, and to their new abode they gave the name&nbsp;of Alba Longa. Of the Latian confederacy, this became&nbsp;the chief city ; and hither the thirty confederate cities of&nbsp;Latium resorted to offer common sacrifices to the gods of&nbsp;the Pelasgic nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The traditionary legends proceed to state, that Lavinia, fearing some injustice from Ascanius, had sought shelter in&nbsp;tbe woods, where she gave birth to a son, named from that&nbsp;circumstance, and from his lather, Æneas Sylvius. Ascanius, however, took no unfair advantage of his position, and&nbsp;was succeeded by Sylvius. For an uncertain period, the&nbsp;sceptre was swayed by successive monarchs of the Sylvian&nbsp;race and name, till the death of Procas. This king left two&nbsp;sons, Numitor and Amulius, but by birthright the throne&nbsp;belonged to Numitor. Amulius, however, seizing the&nbsp;government in defiance of his brother’s right, caused Nu-mitor’s only son to be put to death, and made his daugh</span></p><div>
