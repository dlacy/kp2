<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">and liis unbroken friendship for Boileau are the sole points of his life which are entirely creditable to him. His conduct to Molière&nbsp;and to Nicole cannot be excused ; his attitude towards his critics&nbsp;and his rivals was querulous and spiteful ; his relation to Corneille&nbsp;contrasts strikingly with the graceful position which young men of&nbsp;letters, sometimes by no means his inferiors, have often taken up&nbsp;towards the surviving glories of a past generation ; his “ conversion,” though there is no just cause for branding it as hypocritical,&nbsp;appears to have been a singularly accommodating one, enabling him&nbsp;to tolerate adultery, to libel his friends in secret, and to flatter&nbsp;greatness unhesitatingly. None of these things perhaps are very&nbsp;heinous crimes, but they are all of the class of misdoing which,&nbsp;fairly or unfairly, mankind are apt to regard with greater dislike&nbsp;than positive misdeeds of a more glaring but less unheroic character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">The personality of an author is, however, by all the laws of the saner criticism, entirely independent of the rank to be assigned to&nbsp;his work, and, as in other cases, the strongest dislike for the character of Racine as a man is compatible with the most unbounded&nbsp;admiration of his powers as a writer. But here again his injudicious&nbsp;admirers have interposed a difficulty. There is a theory common&nbsp;in France, and sometimes adopted out of it, that only a Frenchman,&nbsp;and not every Frenchman, can properly appreciate Racine. The&nbsp;charm of his verse and of his dramatic presentation is so esoteric and&nbsp;delicate that foreigners cannot hope to taste it. This is of course&nbsp;absurd, and if it were true it would be fatal to Racine’s claims as a&nbsp;poet of the highest rank. Such poets, such writers, are not parochial or provincial, and even the greatest nations are but provinces&nbsp;or parishes in the realm of literature. Homer, Shakespeare, Dante,&nbsp;even Molière, Rabelais, Goethe, are not afraid to challenge the&nbsp;approval of the whole world, and the whole world is not found incom-</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">E</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">etent or unwilling to give it. Nor need Racine in reality avail imself of this unwise pretension. J udged by the common tests of&nbsp;literature he is a consummate artist, but he is scarcely a great poet,&nbsp;for his art, though unsurpassed in its kind, is narrow in range and&nbsp;his poetry is neither of the highest nor of the most genuine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">He may be considered from two very different points of view,— (1) as a playwright and poetical artificer, and (2) as a dramatist&nbsp;and a poet. From the first point of view there is hardly any praise&nbsp;too high for him. He did not invent the form he practised, and&nbsp;those who, from want of attention to the historical facts, assume&nbsp;that he did are unskilful as well as ignorant. When he came upon&nbsp;the scene the form of French plays was settled, partly by the&nbsp;energetic efforts of the Pléiade and their successors, partly by the&nbsp;reluctant acquiescence of Corneille. It is barely possible that the&nbsp;latter might, if he had chosen, have altered the course of French&nbsp;tragedy ; it is nearly certain that Racine could not. But Corneille,&nbsp;though he was himself more responsible than any one else for the&nbsp;acceptance of the single-situation tragedy, never frankly gave&nbsp;himself up to it, and the inequality of his work is due to this. His&nbsp;heart was, though not to his knowledge, elsewhere, and with Shakespeare. Racine, in whom the craftsman dominated the man of&nbsp;genius, worked with a will and without any misgivings. Every&nbsp;advantage which the Senecan tragedy adapted to modern times was&nbsp;capable of he gave it. He perfected its versification ; he subordinated its scheme entirely to the one motive which could have free&nbsp;play in it,—the display of a conventionally intense passion ; he set&nbsp;himself to produce in verse a kind of Ciceronian correctness. The&nbsp;grammar criticisms of Yaugelas and the taste criticisms of Boileau&nbsp;produced in him no feeling of revolt, but only a determination to&nbsp;play the game according to these new rules with triumphant&nbsp;accuracy. And he did so play it. He had supremely the same&nbsp;faculty which enabled the rhétoriqueurs of the 15th century to&nbsp;execute apparently impossible tours de force in ballades couronnées,&nbsp;and similar tricks. He had besides a real and saving vein of truth&nbsp;to nature, which preserved him from tricks pure and simple. He&nbsp;would be and he was as much a poet as prevalent taste would let&nbsp;him be. The result is that such plays as </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Phèdre</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Andromaque&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">are supreme in their own way. If the critic will only abstain from&nbsp;thrusting in tierce, when according to the particular rules he ought&nbsp;to thrust in quart, Racine is sure to beat him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">But there is a higher game of criticism than this, and this game Racine does not attempt to play. He does not even attempt the&nbsp;highest poetry at all. His greatest achievements in pure passion—&nbsp;the foiled desires of Hermione and the jealous frenzy of Phèdre&nbsp;—are cold, not merely beside the crossed love of Ophelia and the&nbsp;remorse of Lady Macbeth, but beside the sincerer if less perfectly&nbsp;expressed passion of Corneille’s Cléopâtre and Camille. In men’s&nbsp;parts he fails still more completely. As the decency of his stage&nbsp;would not allow him to make his heroes frankly heroic, so it would&nbsp;not allow him to make them utterly passionate. He had, moreover,&nbsp;cut away from himself by the adoption of the Senecan model all&nbsp;the opportunities which would have been offered to his remarkably&nbsp;varied talent on a freer stage. It is indeed tolerably certain that&nbsp;he never could have achieved the purely poetical comedy of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">As You&nbsp;Like It</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> or the </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vida cs Sueno,</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> but the admirable success of </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Les&nbsp;Plaideurs</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> makes it at least probable that he might have done something in a lower and a more conventional style. From all this,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">however, he deliberately cut himself off. Of the whole world which is subject to the poet he took only a narrow artificial and conventional fraction. Within these narrow bounds he did work which&nbsp;no admirer of literary craftsmanship can regard without admiration.&nbsp;But at the same time no one speaking with competence can deny&nbsp;that the bounds are narrow. It would be unnecessary to contrast&nbsp;his performances with his limitations so sharply if those limitations&nbsp;had not been denied. But they have been and are still denied by&nbsp;persons whose sentence carries weight, and therefore it is still necessary to point out the fact of their existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nearly all Racine’s works are mentioned in the above notice. There is here no room for a bibliographical account of their separate appearances. The first&nbsp;collected edition was in 1675-76, and contained the nine tragedies which had&nbsp;then appeared. The last and most complete which appeared in the poet’s lifetime (1697) was revised by him, and contains the dramas and a few miscellaneous works. Like the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">editio princeps,</span><span class="font3"> it is in 2 vols. 12mo. The posthumous&nbsp;editions are innumerable and gradually became more and more complete. The&nbsp;most noteworthy are the Amsterdam edition of 1722 ; that by Abbé cfOlivet,&nbsp;also at Amsterdam, 1743 ; the Paris quarto of 1760 ; the edition of Luneau de&nbsp;Boisjermain, Paris and London, 1768 ; the magnificent illustrated folios of 1805&nbsp;(Paris) ; the edition of Germain Gamier with La Harpe’s commentary, 1807 ;&nbsp;Geoffroy’s of the next year ; Aimé Martin’s of 1820 ; and lastly, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">grands&nbsp;écrivains</span><span class="font3"> edition of Paul Mesnard (Paris, 1865-73). This last contains almost&nbsp;all that is necessary for the study of the poet, and has been chiefly used in&nbsp;preparing the above notice. Louis Racine’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font3"> was first published in 1747.&nbsp;Translations and imitations of Racine are innumerable. In English the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Distressed Mother</span><span class="font3"> of Philips and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Phaedra and Hippolytus</span><span class="font3"> of Smith, both composed&nbsp;more or less under Addison’s influence, are the most noteworthy. (G. SA.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">RACKETS. Like tennis, this game of ball is of French origin, and its name is derived from “ raquette,” the French&nbsp;term for the bat used in the pastime. In the United&nbsp;Kingdom it is not so universally pursued as cricket and&nbsp;football, and is essentially an indoor game, which is played&nbsp;only in prepared and covered courts. Such buildings have&nbsp;been erected at many of the large public schools, at the&nbsp;universities, and in garrison towns, where will be found the&nbsp;chief exponents of rackets, a game which requires active&nbsp;running powers, quick eyesight, and dexterity of hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The old “ open ” courts, which merely consisted of a plain wall without any side walls, are now almost obsolete&nbsp;and need not be&nbsp;further mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The usual dimensions of a “close” court are 80 feet by&nbsp;40 feet for four-handed matches,&nbsp;whilst 60 feet by 30&nbsp;feet are sufficient&nbsp;for a single match.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">Sometimes courts are built of an intermediate size so&nbsp;as to be available&nbsp;for either single&nbsp;or double matches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">The front wall of a court should be 40&nbsp;feet high, the back&nbsp;one 14 feet, the&nbsp;space over the latter&nbsp;being utilized by a&nbsp;gallery for spectators, umpire, and&nbsp;marker. The side&nbsp;walls are 40 feet&nbsp;high throughout, in&nbsp;order to support the&nbsp;roof. This must be&nbsp;well lit with skylights carried on&nbsp;light iron girders&nbsp;and protected inside with wire-work in order to ward&nbsp;off damage from the balls. Bricks make the best walls,&nbsp;which must be plastered inside with Boman cement or&nbsp;plaster of Paris, set to a perfectly level surface in order&nbsp;that the balls may rebound evenly. In the military officers’&nbsp;courts in India this plaster is painted white for the sake of</span></p>
