<p><span class="font2">Let </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font2"> be the distance of any filament from the horizontal line AB. ⅛n element of the orifice, therefore (for we may&nbsp;give it this name), is Zdx. The velocity of this element is&nbsp;√2G*, or √2G × </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x^.</span><span class="font2"> The discharge from it is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font2"> √2Ga^ da·,&nbsp;and the integral of this differential or D = </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">∕I</span><span class="font2">√2G </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x<sup>ι</sup></span><span class="font2"> d∙r</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">= ½Z√2G a-; +C. To determine the constant quantity C, observe that Du Buat found by experiment that 1F was&nbsp;in all cases ½ BF. Therefore D must be nothing when&nbsp;a∙ = ½Aj consequently C = — ½Z√2G(<sub>i</sub>y)^, and the complete integral will be D = </span><span class="font1">∣</span><span class="font2">Z√2G [-J —</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Now make </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x — h,</span><span class="font2"> and we have D=½Z√2G [A<sup>i</sup>-(^)*] =⅝Z^2G [l-(½)<sup>ι</sup>J A’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But 1 —(½)<sup>i</sup> = 0-64645, and § of this is 0∙43L Therefore, finally, D = 0∙43l Z √2G A<sup>1</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If we now put 26∙49 or 26½ for √2G, or the velocity with which a head of water of one inch will impel the water over&nbsp;a weir, and multiply this by 0∙43l, we get the following&nbsp;quantity, 11-4172, or, in numbers of easy recollection, ll½,&nbsp;for the cubic inches of water per second, which runs over&nbsp;every inch of a wasteboard when the edge of it is one inch&nbsp;below the surface of the reservoir ; and this must be multiplied by A’, or by the square root of the cube of the head&nbsp;of water. Thus, let the edge of the wasteboard be four inches&nbsp;below the surface of the water. The cube of this is 64, of&nbsp;which the square root is eight. Therefore a wasteboard of this&nbsp;depth under the surface, and three feet long, will discharge&nbsp;every second 8 × 36 X 11½ cubic inches of water, or 1⅛ cubic feet, English measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following comparisons will show how much this theory may be depended on. The first column shows the depth&nbsp;of the edge of the board under the surface, the second&nbsp;shows the discharge by theory, and the third the discharge&nbsp;actually observed. The length of the board was l8∙4 inches.&nbsp;The numbers in Du Buat’s experiments are here reduced to English measure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">D. D. Tlιeor. D. Exp. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1∙778 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;506&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;524&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;28∙5</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3∙I99 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1222&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1218&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;66∙2</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4∙665 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2153&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2155&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;117-1</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">6-753 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3750&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3771&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;204∙9</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The last column is the cubic inches discharged in a second by each inch of the wasteboard. The correspondence is undoubtedly very great. The greatest error is in the&nbsp;first, which may be attributed to a much smaller lateral&nbsp;contraction under so small a head of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But it must be remarked, that the calculation proceeds on two suppositions. The height FI is supposed ½ of BI ;&nbsp;and 2G is supposed 702. It is evident, that by increasing&nbsp;the one and diminishing the other, nearly the same answers&nbsp;may be produced, unless much greater variations of A be&nbsp;examined. Both of these quantities are matters of considerable uncertainty, particularly the first ; and it must be&nbsp;farther remarked, that this was not measured, but deduced&nbsp;from the uniformity of the experiments. We presume that&nbsp;Du Buat tried various values of G, till he found one which&nbsp;gave the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ratios</span><span class="font2"> of discharge which he observed. We beg&nbsp;leave to observe, that in a set of numerous experiments&nbsp;which we had access to examine, BI was uniformly much&nbsp;less than ½ ; it was very nearly £ ; and the quantitv discharged was greater than what would result from Du Buat’s&nbsp;calculation. It was further observed that IF depended very&nbsp;much on the form of the wasteboard. When it was a very&nbsp;thin board of considerable depth, IF was very considerably&nbsp;greater than if the board was thick, or narrow, and set on&nbsp;the top of a broad dam-head, as in fig. 21.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It may be proper to give the formula a form which will correspond to any ratio which experience may discover between BF and IF. Thus, let IF be — BF. The formula</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">n</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">will be D = ⅞ Z √2G (l — &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>5</sup>)∕Λ</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meantime this theory of Du Buat is of great value to the practical engineer, who at present must content himself&nbsp;with a very vague conjecture, or take the calculation of the&nbsp;erroneous theory of Guglielmini. By that theory, the board&nbsp;of three feet, at the depth of four inches, should discharge&nbsp;nearly 3 J<sub>j</sub> cubic feet per second, which is almost double of&nbsp;what it really delivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We presume, therefore, that the following table will be acceptable to practical engineers, who are not familiar with&nbsp;such computations. It contains, in the first column, the depth&nbsp;in English inches from the surface of the stagnant water of&nbsp;a reservoir to the edge of the wasteboard. The second&nbsp;column is the cubic feet of water discharged in a minute&nbsp;by every inch of the wasteboard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Depth. Discharge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depth. Discharge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... 0-403 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.........12∙748</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... 1140 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11.........14-707</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... 2∙095 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12.........16∙758</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... 3-225 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.........18-895</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... 4-507 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.........21-117</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">6 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... 5-925 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15.........23-419</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">7 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... 7-466 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.........25-800</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">8 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;......... 9-122 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.........28-258</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">9 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.........10-884 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.........30-786</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When the depth does not exceed four inches, it will not be exact enough to take proportional parts for the fractions&nbsp;of an inch. The following method is exact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If they be odd quarters of an inch, look in the table for as many inches as the depth contains quarters, and take the&nbsp;eighth part of the answer. Thus, for 3¼ inches, take the&nbsp;eighth part of 23-419, which corresponds to 15 inches.&nbsp;This is 2-927.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the wasteboard is not on the face of a dam, but in a running stream, we must augment the discharge by multiplying the section by the velocity of the stream. But&nbsp;this correction can seldom occur in practice ; because in&nbsp;this case the discharge is previously known, and it is A that&nbsp;we want, which is the object of the next problem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We only beg leave to add, that the experiments which we mention as having been already made in this country,&nbsp;give a result somewhat greater than this table, viz. about</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">à</span><span class="font2">. Therefore, having obtained the answer by this table, d to it its 16th part, and we apprehend that it will be extremely near the truth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When, on the other hand, we know the discharge over a wasteboard, we can tell the depth of its edge under the&nbsp;surface of the stagnant water of the reservoir, because we&nbsp;have A = (∩τy) * <sup>vel</sup>7 nearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We are now in a condition to solve the problem respecting a weir across a river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prob. II. The discharge and section of a river being given, it is required to determine how much the water will&nbsp;he raised by a weir of the whole breadth of the river, discharging the water with a clear fall, that is, the surface of&nbsp;the water in the lower channel being below the edge of&nbsp;the weir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this case we have 2G = 731 nearly, because there</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
