There are alſo ſearchers of leather, &amp;c. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Alnager.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Searcher,</hi> in ordnance, is an iron ſocket with branches, from four to eight in number, a little bent outwards, with ſmall points at their ends; to this ſocket is fixed a wooden handle, from eight to twelve feet long, of about an inch and a quarter diameter. After the gun has been fired, this ſearcher is introduced into it, and turned round, in order to diſcover the cavities within. The diſtances of theſe cavities, if any be found, are then marked on the outſide with chalk, when another ſearcher that has only one point, about which a mixture of wax and tallow is put, is introduced to take the impreſſion of the holes; and if there be any hole, a quarter of an inch deep, or of any conſiderable length, the gun is rejected as unſerviceable.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
