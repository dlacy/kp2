<p><span class="font1">All this is remarkable, manifesting a spirit very different from that which animated the common law of testaments. True, it was&nbsp;a principle with the jurists of the classical period that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">voluntatis&nbsp;ratio</span><span class="font1"> was to be given effect to in the interpretation of testamentary&nbsp;writings; but that was on the condition that the requirements of&nbsp;law as to form and substance had been scrupulously observed. But&nbsp;in the military testament positive rules were made to yield to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">voluntas</span><span class="font1"> in all respects: the will was almost absolutely unfettered.&nbsp;Roman law in this matter gave place to natural law. One would&nbsp;have expected the influence of so great a change to have manifested&nbsp;itself by degrees in the ordinary law of testaments; yet it is barely&nbsp;visible. In a few points the legislation of Constantine, Theodosius II.&nbsp;and Justinian relaxed the strictness of the old rules; but there&nbsp;was never any approach to the recognition of the complete supremacy of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">voluntas.</span><span class="font1"> In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Juris</span><span class="font1"> the contrast between the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">testamentum paganum</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">testamentum militare</span><span class="font1"> was almost as&nbsp;marked as in the days of Trajan. The latter was still a privileged&nbsp;deed, whose use was confined to a soldier actually on service, and&nbsp;if he received an honourable discharge, for twelve months after his&nbsp;retirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">peculium castrense</span><span class="font1"> had a wider influence; for it was the first of a series of amendments that vastly diminished the importance&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font1"> on its patrimonial side. It had&nbsp;its origin in a constitution </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">Augustus granting to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiifamilias</span><span class="font1"> on service the right to dispose by testament&nbsp;of what they had acquired in the active exercise of their profession&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{quod in castris adquisterant).<sup>@@1</sup> </span><span class="font1">But it soon went much further.&nbsp;Confined at first to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiifamilias</span><span class="font1"> on actual service, the privilege was&nbsp;extended by Hadrian to those who had obtained honourable discharge.&nbsp;The same emperor allowed them not merely to test on their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">peculium&nbsp;castrense,</span><span class="font1"> but to manumit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter vivos</span><span class="font1"> slaves that formed part of it;&nbsp;and by a little step further the classical jurists recognized their right&nbsp;to dispose of it onerously or gratuitously </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter vtvos.</span><span class="font1"> In the 3rd&nbsp;century the range of it was extended so as to include not only&nbsp;the soldier’s pay and prize, but all that had come to him, directly&nbsp;or indirectly, in connexion with his profession—his outfit, gifts&nbsp;made to him during his service, legacies from comrades and so on.&nbsp;All this was in a high degree subversive of the doctrines of the&nbsp;common law. It may almost be called revolutionary; for it involved in the first place the recognition of the right of. a person&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">alieni juris</span><span class="font1"> to make a testament as if he were </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris,</span><span class="font1"> and in&nbsp;the second place the recognition of a separate estate in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfami-lias</span><span class="font1"> which he might deal with independently of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which could not be touched by the latter’s creditors, and which he&nbsp;was not even bound to collate (or bring into hotch-pot) on claiming a&nbsp;share of his father’s succession. The radical right of the parent,&nbsp;however, was rather suspended than extinguished; for, if the&nbsp;' soldier son died intestate, the right of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias.</span><span class="font1"> revived:&nbsp;he took his son’s belongings, not as his heir appropriating an in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">heritance, but as his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> reclaiming a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">peculium.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Family.</span><span class="font1">—The legislative efforts of Augustus to encourage marriage, to which persons of position showed a remarkable distaste,&nbsp;have already been mentioned. The relation of husband&nbsp;and wife still in law required no more for its creation&nbsp;than deliberate interchange of nuptial consent, although&nbsp;in.certain cases some act indicative of change of life, such as the&nbsp;bride’s home-coming to her husband’s house, was regarded as&nbsp;the criterion of completed marriage.<sup>@@3</sup> But it was rarely accompanied with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus.</span><span class="font1"> So repugnant was such subjection to patrician&nbsp;ladies that they declined to submit to confarreate nuptials; and so&nbsp;great consequently became the difficulty of finding persons qualified&nbsp;by confarreate birth to fill the higher priesthoods that early in the&nbsp;Empire it had to be decreed that confarreation should in future be&nbsp;productive of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font1"> only </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quoad sacra,</span><span class="font1"> and should not make the&nbsp;wife a member of her husband’s family. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Manus</span><span class="font1"> by a year’s uninterrupted cohabitation was long out of date in the time of Gaius;&nbsp;and, although that by coemption was still in use in his time, it&nbsp;was almost unknown by the end of the period. Husband and&nbsp;wife therefore had their separate estates, the common establishment being maintained by the husband, with the assistance of the&nbsp;revenue of the wife's dowry </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(dos)—</span><span class="font1">-an institution which received&nbsp;much attention at the hands of the jurists, and was to some extent&nbsp;regulated by statute. Divorce (either of common consent or by&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">repudium</span><span class="font1"> by either spouse) was unfortunately very common; it&nbsp;was lawful even without any assignable cause; when blame attached&nbsp;to either spouse, he or she suffered deprivation to some extent of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">nuptial provisions, but there were no other penal consequences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not only in the case of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> who had adopted a military career, but in all directions, there was manifested a strong&nbsp;tendency to place restrictions on the exercise of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">This was due in a great degree to the hold that the principles of&nbsp;natural law were gaining within the Roman system, perhaps due</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">to the-fact that the emperors, having succeeded to the censorial </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regimen morum,</span><span class="font1"> allowed these principles freely to influence their&nbsp;edicts and rescripts. Exposure of an infant was still apparently&nbsp;allowed; but a parent was no longer permitted, even in the character&nbsp;of household judge, to put his son to death or cruelly ill-treat him;&nbsp;in fact his prerogative was limited to moderate chastisement, the&nbsp;law.requiring, in the case of a grave offence that merited severer&nbsp;punishment, that he should bring his child before the comi&gt;etent&nbsp;magistrate. His right of sale, in like manner, was permitted only&nbsp;when.he .was in great poverty and unable to maintain them, while&nbsp;their impignoration by him was prohibited under pain of banishment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Except in the solitary case of a son who was a soldier, a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font1"> was still recognized as in law the owner of all the earnings and other.acquisitions of his children </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate;</span><span class="font1"> but the old rule&nbsp;still remained that for their civil debts he was not liable beyond&nbsp;the amount of the fund he had advanced them to deal with as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de&nbsp;facto</span><span class="font1"> their own </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{peculium profecticium),</span><span class="font1"> except when he had derived&nbsp;advantage from their contract or had expressly or by implication&nbsp;authorized them to enter into it as his agents. To the party with&nbsp;whom he had contracted a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> was himself liable as fully&nbsp;as if he had been a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias,</span><span class="font1"> with one exception, namely, when&nbsp;his debt was for borrowed money; in that case, with some very&nbsp;reasonable qualifications, it was declared by the well-known Macedonian scnatusconsult (of the time of Vespasian) that.the lender&nbsp;should not be entitled to recover payment, even after his borrower&nbsp;had become </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris</span><span class="font1"> by his father’s death. Between a father and&nbsp;his emancipated son there was, and always had been, perfect freedom of contract; but so was there now between a father and his&nbsp;soldier son in any matter relating to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">peculium castrense,</span><span class="font1"> even&nbsp;though the son was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate.</span><span class="font1"> What is still more remarkable is&nbsp;that, the new sentiment which was operating on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">admitted the possibility of natural obligation between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> even in reference to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">peculium profecticium,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which, though incapable of direct enforcement by action, was yet&nbsp;to some extent recognized and given effect to indirectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the matter of guardianship, while the tutory of pupils was carefully maintained and the law in regard to it materially amended&nbsp;during the period under review (particularly by a senatusconsult&nbsp;generally referred to as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oratio divi Severi,</span><span class="font1"> prohibiting alienation of the ward’s property without judicial authority), that of&nbsp;women above the age of pupillarity gradually disappeared.<sup>@@4</sup> The&nbsp;guardianship or curatory </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{cura)</span><span class="font1"> of minors above pupillarity owed&nbsp;its establishment as a general doctrine to Marcus Aurelius. The&nbsp;Plaetorian law<sup>@@5</sup> of the middle of the 6th century of the city had&nbsp;indeed imposed penalties on those taking undue advantage of the&nbsp;inexperience of minors, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> persons </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris</span><span class="font1"> under the age of twenty-five; and from that time the praetors were in the habit of granting&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">restitutio in integrum</span><span class="font1"> in cases of lesion and appointing curators to act&nbsp;with such persons for the protection of their interests in particular&nbsp;affairs. But it was Marcus Aurelius that first made curatory a&nbsp;general permanent office, to endure in the ordinary case until the&nbsp;ward attained majority. The powers, duties ana responsibilities&nbsp;of such curators became a matter for careful and. elaborate definition and regulation by the jurists, whose exposition indeed of the&nbsp;law of guardianship generally, whether by tutors or curators, has&nbsp;found wide acceptance in modern systems of jurisprudence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Law of Succession and particularly Testamentary Trusts.— </span><span class="font1">There were far more positive changes in the law of succession than&nbsp;in either that of property or that of obligation. The rise&nbsp;and progress of the military testament has already been&nbsp;explained. The testament of the common law was still&nbsp;ostensibly that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram;</span><span class="font1"> but the practice of&nbsp;granting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio secundum tabulas</span><span class="font1"> to the persons named&nbsp;as heirs in any testamentary instrument, that bore outside the&nbsp;requisite number of seals led, from the time of Antoninus Pius,&nbsp;to the frequent neglect of the time-honoured formalities of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae mancipatio</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nuncupatio testamenti.</span><span class="font1"> It was his rescript,&nbsp;formerly mentioned, declaring that an heir-at-law should no longer&nbsp;be entitled to dispute the last wishes of a testator on the technical&nbsp;ground of non-compliance with the purely formal requirements&nbsp;of the law, that practically established what Justinian calls the&nbsp;praetorian testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the commonest provisions in the testaments of the period was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fideicommissum,</span><span class="font1">—a request by the testator to his heir to&nbsp;enter on the inheritance and thereafter denude wholly or partially&nbsp;in favour of a third party. It was introduced in the time, of&nbsp;Augustus by (it is said by Thcophilus) a testator who had married&nbsp;a peregrin wife, and desired thus indirectly to give to his peregrin&nbsp;children the succession which, as not being citizens, they could&nbsp;neither take </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab intestato</span><span class="font1"> nor as his direct testamentary heirs.<sup>@@6</sup> He&nbsp;probably soon found imitators, and their number must have rapidly&nbsp;multiplied once the emperor, shocked at the perfidy of a trustee</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
