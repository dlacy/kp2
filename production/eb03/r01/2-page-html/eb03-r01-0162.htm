<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ter grounds </span><span class="font2">than any of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">your*a : our Lord has declared </span><span class="font2">it in expreſs terms ; and whether the ſoul be immortal&nbsp;or not, we can eaſily believe what he ſaid is true, as we&nbsp;know him whom we have truſted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Theſe, with Plato, ſuppoſe, that the foul is here as in prifon ; though how or at what time it ſhould ſirſt have&nbsp;come into this dungeon they have not determined. They&nbsp;have only agreed, that upon its enlargement all its&nbsp;faculties are to receive an increaſe cf power ; and &quot; ha-&gt;i(ig already equipped it ſo exquiſitely with conſciouſneſs,&nbsp;activity, and perception in and of itſelf, and put it into ſo&nbsp;complete a capacity for happinefs and miſery in a ſeparate ſtate,” their hypotheſis does not require them to&nbsp;admît the leaſt occaſion for a reſurrection ; which accordingly is ſaid to have been an article of Baxter’s&nbsp;creed (o).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A third opinion, which extends likewife to every ſpe-cies of plant and animal, is, that all ſouls were created at once with bodies of ether; that theſe bodies, occupying&nbsp;only </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">very ſmall ſpace, were packed up in their firſt&nbsp;progenitors, and there left to be afterwards evolved and&nbsp;clothed with matter of a groſſer kind by acts of gene-ration and confequent nutrition. For the proof of this&nbsp;theory we are referred to the ſmall animals ſeen through&nbsp;the microſcope, and likewiſe to thoſe which are ſuppo-ſed to eſcape even microſcopic obſervation ; but, above&nbsp;all, to the eggs of infects, which, though ſcarcely per-ceptſhle, yet contain in embryo a future caterpillar&nbsp;and all its coats, and within theſe </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">future butterfly&nbsp;with its legs and wings. Theſe philoſophers can per-haps account for the general taint of original tin in fome&nbsp;other way than has hitherto been done, we have only&nbsp;to add, that on their fcheme the reſurrection is not a&nbsp;matter that feems to be indifferent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The next thing that falls to be conſidered is the place of the dead. From a natural enough aſſociation of&nbsp;ideas, an opinion had very early prevailed, that the ſpirit continued near to the body; and the offerings therefore intended for the dead were by moſt nations pre-ſented at the grave ; and that on which the departed&nbsp;ſpirit is ſuppoſed to reſt is always placed near the grave&nbsp;in China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the dreams of the night and the natural tendency of the fancy to work and to ſummon up ſpectres when the world around us is involved in darkneſs, it&nbsp;has alſo been imagined, that theſe ſpirſts delight in the&nbsp;night and ſhadow of death (p),or have been prohibited&nbsp;from enjoying the exhilarating beams of day. And&nbsp;hence we are told,</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0">That in the difmal regions of the dead</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Th’ infernal king once rais’d his horrid head ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Leap’d from his throne, leſt Neptune’s arm ſhould lay</span></p><h3><span class="font0">H is dark dominions open to the day,</span></h3><h3><span class="font0">And pour in light.</span></h3><h3><span class="font0">The nations, therefore, who have fancied a generaI receptacle for the dead, have thus been induced to</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">place it in the </span><span class="font2">weſt (qJ,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> where the night </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">begins and </span><span class="font2">the day ends. That part of the world which, in the&nbsp;diviſion of his father’s dominions, fell to Pluto the in-fernal god, and where, according to Lactantius, Satan&nbsp;holds the empire of darknefs, the Friendly Iſlanders&nbsp;have placed to the weſtward of a certain iſland which&nbsp;they call </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tejee. ;</span><span class="font2"> ſome tribes of American Indians, in&nbsp;a country beyond the weſtern mountains ; and Homer,&nbsp;ſomewhere to the weſtward of Greece at the boundaries&nbsp;of the ocean,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">where in a lonely land and gloomy cells</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The duſky nation of Cimmeria dwells ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">'ſ'he ſun ne’er views th’ uncomfortable feats when radiant he advances nor retreats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Unhappy race ! whom endlefs night invades,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Clouds the dull air, and wraps them round in ſhades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another opinion entertained by the Greeks and fome other nations was, that the place of departed ſpirits is&nbsp;under the earth. This opinion is frequently mentioned&nbsp;in Homer, in virgil, and ; Jaded to by the Jewiſh prophets. As for the prophets, we know the circumſtance&nbsp;from which they borrowed it : it was borrowed from&nbsp;thofe ſubterraneous vaults where their chiefs were bu-ried, and which have been deſcribed by modern travellers» In the ſides of theſe caverns there is ranged a&nbsp;great number of cells; and in theſe cells the mighty lay&nbsp;in a fort of ſtate, with their weapons of war and their&nbsp;ſwords at their head. To thefe kinds of Egyptian cemeteries Ezekiel alludes, when he ſays, &quot; that they ſhall&nbsp;not lie with the mighty that are fallen of the uncircum-cifed, who are gone down to hell with their weapons of&nbsp;war, and they have laid their ſwords under their head.”&nbsp;And Iſaiah, when thus ſpeaking of the prince of Ba-bylon, &quot; Thou ſhalt be brought down to hell, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">to&nbsp;the ſides of the pit.</span><span class="font2"> Hell from beneath is moved for&nbsp;thee, to meet thee at thy coming ; it ſtirreth up the&nbsp;dead for thee, even all the chief ones of the earth ; it&nbsp;hath raiſed up from their thrones all the kings of the&nbsp;nations. All the kings of the nations, even all of&nbsp;them, lie in glory, every one in his own houſe.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many of the ancient fathers of the church aſſerted only, that the dead are now </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in abditis receptaculis,</span><span class="font2"> or in&nbsp;certain hidden and concealed places.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">orpheus, o∏gen, and forne others of the fathers, with the ancient Caledonian bard oſſian, and the learn-ed Dodwell among the moderns, imagined that the&nbsp;fouI, when it left the body, went into the air, and&nbsp;reſided ſomewhere between the furfacc of the earth and&nbsp;the moon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thoſe who believed in a tranſmigration cauſed the ſoul at death only to enter a new body, and kept the&nbsp;departed always with the living. This creed has been&nbsp;found in India, in Egypt, in Mexico, and in all thoſe&nbsp;countries where picture-writing has been much uſed.&nbsp;In this ſpecies oſ writing, the ſame picture is on&nbsp;fancied analogy transferred by metaphor to ſignify ei-</span></p><div>
