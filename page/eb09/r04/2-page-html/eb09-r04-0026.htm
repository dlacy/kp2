                    such foreign markets as the countries which first attained an industrial
                    development. Her colonies are deserts, and in the home&nbsp;markets the
                    manufacturer only finds 80 millions of poverty-stricken&nbsp;people, whoso wants
                    are nearly all supplied by their petty domestic&nbsp;industries.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">These, that is, the domestic industries which are carried on by
                    the peasants in conjunction with their agricultural pursuits during&nbsp;the
                    long days of idleness imposed by the climate and by the reduced allotments of
                    land, continue, not only to hold their ground&nbsp;side by side with the large
                    manufactures, but to develop and to&nbsp;compete with these by the cheapness of
                    their products. Extensive&nbsp;inquiries are now being made into these domestic

                    unexpected&nbsp;variety of industries, and a still more unexpected technical
                    development in several of them, have been disclosed by these
                    researches.&nbsp;Thie yearly production of the 855,000 kustari who have been
                    registered reaches 218,414,000 roubles; while the total number of&nbsp;Jieasants
                    engaged in the industries, mostly in Great Russia and&nbsp;northern Caucasia, is
                    estimated at a minimum of 7,500,000 persons,&nbsp;with a yearly production of at
                    least 1,800,000,000 roubles, or more&nbsp;than double the aggregate production
                    of the manufactures proper.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Of course the machinery they use is very primitive, and the wages
                    for a day of twelve to sixteen hours exceedingly low. But the&nbsp;industries
                    are capable of being improved, and it has been brought&nbsp;out that “ Paris ”
                    silk hats and “ Vienna ” house furniture sold by&nbsp;substantial foreign firms
                    at Moscow are really manufactured in the&nbsp;neighbourhood of the capital by
                    peasants who still continue to till&nbsp;their fields. All these industries
                    suffer very much from want of&nbsp;credit, and the Producers become the prey of
                    intermediaries. But&nbsp;their continued existence and their progress under most
                    unfavourable conditions show that they meet a real want, which is itself
                    the&nbsp;consequence of the peculiar conditions under which Russia, the
                    last&nbsp;to come into the international market, has to develop.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">In those very governments where two-thirds of the textile
                    manufactories of Russia are concentrated domestic weaving (for the market, not
                    for domestic use) employs about 200,000 hands, whose&nbsp;yearly production is
                    valued at 45,000,000 roubles. In Stavropol on&nbsp;Caucasus it has so rapidly
                    developed that 42,400 looms are now at&nbsp;work, with a yearly production of
                    2,007,700 roubles. But no adequate idea could be given of the petty industries
                    of Russia without&nbsp;entering into greater detail than the scope of the
                    present article permits. Suffice it to say that there is no branch of the
                    industries in&nbsp;textiles, leather, woodwork, or metal work, provided it needs
                    no&nbsp;heavy machinery, which is not successfully carried on in
                    the&nbsp;villages. Nearly all the requirements of nine-tenths of the population
                    of Russia are met in this way.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The aggregate production of industries within the empire,
                    inclusive of mining, was stated in 1882 as follows :—European Russia,
                    1,126,033,000 roubles; Poland, 147,309,000; Finland, 15,130,000.&nbsp;The chief
                    manufactures in European Russia (apart from Poland and&nbsp;Finland), and their
                    yearly production in 1882 in millions of roubles,&nbsp;were as follows :—cotton
                    yarn and cottons, 208<sup>-</sup>6 ; other textile&nbsp;industries, 103&quot;5 ;
                    metal wares and machinery, 107'9; chemicals,&nbsp;6 &quot;6 ; candles, soap,
                    glue, leather, and other animal Jiroducts, 61<sup>,</sup>4 ;&nbsp;distillery
                    products, 156.0 ; other liquors, 39.0; sugar, 140.9 ; flour,&nbsp;74.0. The
                    remainder are of minor importance. It must be observed,&nbsp;however, that these
                    figures are much below those given for 1879,&nbsp;when the aggregate production
                    of Russian manufactures was computed at 1,102,949,000 roubles, without the
                    mining and related&nbsp;industries, the distillery products, and the
                    flour.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The geographical distribution of manufactures in Russia is very
                    unequal. The governments of Moscow and St Petersburg, with a&nbsp;yearly
                    production of 173 and 134 million roubles respectively, represent together
                    two-fifths of the aggregate production of Russia. If&nbsp;we add Vladimir
                    (91,766,000 roubles), Kieff (73,300,000), Perm&nbsp;(50,500,000), Livonia,
                    Esthonia, Kharkoff, and Kherson (from 30 to&nbsp;35 millions each), we have all
                    the principal manufacturing centres.&nbsp;In fact, Moscow’, with portions of the
                    neighbouring governments,&nbsp;contains half the Russian manufactures exempted
                    from excise duties,&nbsp;while the south-west governments of Kieff, Podolia, and
                    Kherson&nbsp;contain two-thirds of those not so
                exempted.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The main wealth of Russia consisting in raw produce, the trade of
                    the country turns chiefly on the purchase of this for export, and&nbsp;the aale

            <p><span class="font1">traffic is in the hands of a great number of middlemen,—in the
                    west Jews, and elsewhere Russians,—to whom the peasants are for the&nbsp;most
                    part in debt, as they purchase in advance on security of subsequent payments in
                    corn, tar, wooden wares, &amp;c. A good deal of&nbsp;the internal trade is
                    carried on by travelling merchants (</span><span class="font1"

            <p><span class="font1">The fairs are very numerous ; the minor ones numbered 6500 in
                    1878, and showed sales amounting to an aggregate of 305 million&nbsp;roubles.
                    Those of Nijni-Novgorod, with a return of 400 million&nbsp;roubles, of Irbit and
                    Kharkoff (above 100 million roubles each), of&nbsp;Romny, Krestovskoye in Perm,
                    and Menzelinsk in Ufa (55 to 12&nbsp;million roubles), have considerable
                    importance both for trade and&nbsp;for home manufactures. The total value of the
                    internal trade, which&nbsp;is in the hands of 681,116 licensed dealers, is
                    roughly estimated at&nbsp;more than seven milliards of roubles.</span></p>

            <p><span class="font1">The chief article of export is grain—wheat, oats, and rye—
                    (24,870,000 quarters, 321,042,000 roubles in 1882), to which the&nbsp;increase
                    of exports is mainly due. This increase, however, does not&nbsp;correspond to an
                    increase of crops, only 10 per cent, of which were&nbsp;exported in 1870 and
                    about 20 per cent, in 1882. Next to grain&nbsp;come flax, hemp, linseed, and
                    hempseed (129,370,000 roubles in&nbsp;1882) ; oil-yielding grains (441,000
                    quarters) ; wool, tallow, hides,&nbsp;bristles, and bone (31,120,000 roubles).
                    If we add to these timber&nbsp;(35,044,000 roubles) and furs (4,147,000
                    roubles), 95 per cent, of all&nbsp;Russian exports are accounted for, the
                    remainder consisting of&nbsp;linen, ropes, and some woollen stuffs and metallic
                    wares (7,172,000&nbsp;roubles to western Europe, 2,888,000 to Finland, and
                    5,763,000 to&nbsp;Asia).</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The chief imports from Europe were in 1882 as follows:—Tea
                    (48,091,000 roubles), liquors (16,124,000 roubles), salt, fish,
                    rice,&nbsp;fruits, and colonial wares (38,446,000 roubles), various raw textile
                    wares (127,986,000 roubles—cotton 72,417,000), raw metals&nbsp;(32,630,000
                    roubles), chemicals (57,894,000 roubles), and stuffs&nbsp;(22,428,000 roubles).
                    The imports from Asia—chiefly tea—in the&nbsp;same year reached 32,853,000
                    roubles. The chief imports were from&nbsp;Germany (214,000,000 roubles) and
                    Great Britain (124,700,000),&nbsp;the chief exports to Great Britain
                    (210,000,000), Germany&nbsp;(178,000,000), and France (54,000,000). Even in her
                    trade with&nbsp;Finland Russia imports more than she exports,—the chief
                    imports&nbsp;being paper, cotton, iron, and butter ; Prohibitory tariffs were
                    imposed on Finnish wares in 1885.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">During 1882 the ports of the empire were visited by 13,638
                    foreign ships (5,337,000 tons), of which number 1436 were to&nbsp;Asiatic ports
                    (391,200 tons). Of the above total only 2489 vessels&nbsp;(628,000 tons) were
                    under the Russian flag (mostly Finnish), while&nbsp;the British alone showed a
                    tonnage of 2,258,000 and the German&nbsp;639,000. The coasting trade was
                    represented by 35,083 vessels&nbsp;(6,040,000 tons) entering the ports, chiefly
                    those of the Black Sea.&nbsp;The mercantile marine of Russia in 1882 numbered
                    6383 vessels&nbsp;(727,000 tons), including 604 steamers ; of the total number
                    1593&nbsp;(254,000 tons) were Finnish. The chief ports are St
                    Petersburg,&nbsp;Odessa, Riga, Taganrog, Libau, and Reval. Baku has
                    recently&nbsp;acquired some importance in consequence of the naphtha
                        trade.<sup>@@3</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The rivers of the empire, mostly connected by canals, play a very
                    important part in the inland traffic. The aggregate length of&nbsp;navigable
                    waters reaches 21,510 miles (453 miles of canals), and&nbsp;12,600 miles more
                    are available for floating rafts. In 1882 51,407&nbsp;boats, with cargoes
                    amounting to 153,250,000 cwts., valued at&nbsp;186,480,000 roubles, left the
                    ports on Russian rivers and canals.</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
