<p><span class="font0">being now overthrown, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tribunitia potestas</span><span class="font0"> alone should invite the emperor to make his triumphal entry into the&nbsp;Capitol, and receive his authority from the people of Rome.&nbsp;This conception of the Roman power will now be seen to&nbsp;become more and more definite until finding its last&nbsp;expression in Cola di Rienzo. Pope Clement, resigning&nbsp;himself to necessity, acknowledged the new government&nbsp;under the energetic rule of Arlotti. The latter now joined&nbsp;the Ghibellines of the Campagna against the Orsini and&nbsp;the Neapolitans, subdued Velletri, and gave it a podestà.&nbsp;But then the Gaetani, who were Guelfs, united with the&nbsp;Orsini and the Neapolitans, and, giving battle to the&nbsp;Ghibellines in the Campagna, routed them in such wise as&nbsp;to put an end to the popular government. The nobles&nbsp;forced their way into the city, attacked the Capitol, made&nbsp;Arlotti their prisoner, and re-elected the senators Sciarra&nbsp;Colonna and Francesco Orsini. Close upon these reverses&nbsp;came the death of Henry VIL (24th August 1313) at&nbsp;Buonconvento near Siena, which put an end to the Ghibel-Iine party in Italy. Thereupon King Robert of Naples,&nbsp;being named senator by the pope, immediately appointed&nbsp;a vicar in Rome. Clement likewise profited by the vacancy&nbsp;of the imperial throne to name the king imperial vicar&nbsp;in Tuscany. And he died on the 20th April 1314, well&nbsp;content to have witnessed the triumphs of the Guelfs in&nbsp;Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Affairs took a fresh turn under Pope John XXII. (1316-34). Rome was still ruled by the vicars of King&nbsp;Robert ; but, owing to the continued absence of the popes,&nbsp;matters grew daily worse. Trade and industry declined,&nbsp;revenue diminished, the impoverished nobles were exceedingly turbulent, deeds of murder and violence occurred on&nbsp;all sides ; even by day the streets of the city were unsafe.&nbsp;Hence there was universal discontent. Meanwhile Louis&nbsp;the Bavarian, who in 1314 had been crowned king of the&nbsp;Romans, having overcome his German enemies at Mühldorf in 1322, turned against the pope, one of his fiercest&nbsp;opponents. ∙ Louis was surrounded by Minorite friars,&nbsp;supporters of the poverty of the church, and consequently&nbsp;enemies to the temporal power. They were men of the&nbsp;stamp of William of Occam, Marsilio of Padua, Giovanni&nbsp;Janduno, and other philosophers favourable to the rights&nbsp;of the empire and the people. Accordingly the Italian&nbsp;Ghibellines hailed Louis as they had previously hailed&nbsp;Henry. Even the Roman people were roused to action,&nbsp;and, driving out the representatives and partisans of&nbsp;King Robert, in the spring of 1327, seized on Castle St&nbsp;Angelo, and again established a democratic government.&nbsp;“Nearly all Italy was stirred to new deeds,” says G. Villani,&nbsp;“ and the Romans rose to arms and organized the people ”&nbsp;(bk. x. c. 20). Regardless of the reproofs of the pope,&nbsp;they elected a haughty Ghibelline, Sciarra Colonna, captain&nbsp;of the people and general of the militia, with a council of&nbsp;fifty-two </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">popolani,</span><span class="font0"> four to each region. Then, ranged&nbsp;under the standards of the militia, the Romans gave chase&nbsp;to the foes of the republic, and Sciarra, returning victorious,&nbsp;ascended to the Capitol and invited Louis the Bavarian&nbsp;to Rome. Thesummons was obeyed; on the 7th January&nbsp;1328 the king was already encamped in the Neronian&nbsp;Fields with five thousand horse and a considerable number&nbsp;of foot soldiers, and, with better fortune than Henry VII.,&nbsp;was able to enter the Vatican at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Encircled by a crowd of heretics, reformers, and Minorite brethren, he convoked a parliament on the&nbsp;Capitol, asking that the imperial crown might be conferred&nbsp;upon him by the people, from whom alone he wished to&nbsp;receive it. And the people proclaimed him their captain,&nbsp;senator, and emperor. On the 17th January his coronation took place in St Peter’s. But, as he had neither money&nbsp;nor practical sense, his method of taxation and the excesses&nbsp;committed by himself and his over-excited philosophers&nbsp;speedily aroused the popular discontent. His ecclesiastical&nbsp;vicar, Marsilio of Padua, and Giovanni Janduno placarded&nbsp;the walls with insulting manifestoes against the pope,&nbsp;whom the Minorites stigmatized as a heretic and wished&nbsp;to depose. In April Louis twice assembled the parliament&nbsp;in St Peter’s Square, and, after obtaining its sanction to&nbsp;several anti-papal edicts, declared John XXII. degraded&nbsp;and deposed as a heretic. This was a very strange and&nbsp;novel spectacle, the more so that, as was speedily proved,&nbsp;the Romans were stirred by no anti-Catholic spirit, no&nbsp;yearning for religious reform. Jacopo Colonna, a canon&nbsp;of the Lateran, was able to make his way into Rome with&nbsp;four masked companions, to publicly read, at the top&nbsp;of his voice and before a great multitude, the excommunication launched against the emperor by the deposed&nbsp;pope, to traverse the entire city, and to withdraw unmolested to Palestrina. Meanwhile the emperor contented&nbsp;himself with decreeing that henceforth the popes must&nbsp;reside in Rome,—that if, when invited, they should fail to&nbsp;come they would be thereby held deposed from the throne.&nbsp;As a logical consequence, proceedings were immediately&nbsp;begun for the election of the new pope, Nicholas V., who&nbsp;on the 12th May was proclaimed by the popular voice in&nbsp;St Peter’s Square, and received the imperial sanction.&nbsp;But this ephemeral drama came to an end when the&nbsp;emperor departed with his antipope on the 4th August.&nbsp;This caused the immediate downfall of the democratic&nbsp;Government. Bertoldo Orsini, who had returned to Rome&nbsp;with his Guelfs, and Stefano Colonna were elected senators,&nbsp;and confirmed in the office by Cardinal Giovanni Orsini in&nbsp;the name of the pope. A new parliament cancelled the&nbsp;emperor’s edicts, and had them burnt by the public executioner. Later, Nicholas, the antipope, went with a rope&nbsp;about his neck to make submission to John XXII., and&nbsp;Louis promised to disavow and retract all that he had&nbsp;done against the church, provided the sentence of excommunication were withdrawn. This, however, was refused. Never had the empire fallen so low. Meanwhile&nbsp;King Robert was again supreme in Rome, and, being reelected senator, appointed vicars there as before. Anarchy&nbsp;reigned. The city was torn by factions, and the provinces&nbsp;rebelled against the French representatives of the pope,&nbsp;who, in their ignorance of Italian affairs, were at a loss&nbsp;how to act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And after the election of Benedict XII. (1334-42) confusion reached so great a pitch that, on the expiration of Robert’s senatorial term, the Romans named thirteen heads&nbsp;of regions to carry on the government with two senators,&nbsp;while the king still sent vicars as before. The people, for&nbsp;the sake of peace, once more granted the supremacy of the&nbsp;senate to the pope, and he nominated two knights of&nbsp;Gubbio, Giacomo di Cante dei Gabrielli and Bosone&nbsp;Novello dei Gabrielli, who were succeeded by two other&nbsp;senators the following year. But in 1339 the Romans&nbsp;attacked the Capitol, named two senators of their own&nbsp;choice, re-established a democratic Government, and sent&nbsp;ambassadors to Florence to ask for the ordinances of&nbsp;justice </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iprdinamenti della giustizia),</span><span class="font0"> by which that city&nbsp;had broken the power of the nobles, and also that a few&nbsp;skilled citizens should lend their help in the reconstitution of Rome. Accordingly some Florentines came with&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ordinamenti,</span><span class="font0"> some portions of which may be recognized in the Roman statutes, and, after first rearranging&nbsp;the taxes, elected thirteen priors of the guilds, a gonfalonier of justice, and a captain of the people after the&nbsp;Florentine manner. But there was a dissimilarity in the&nbsp;conditions of the two cities. The guilds having little&nbsp;influence in Rome, the projected reform failed, and the&nbsp;pope, who was opposed to it, re-elected the senators.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
