<p><span class="font0">the wagons is necessary to get them into station order this is effected </span><span class="font1">on </span><span class="font0">the same principle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Push-and-pull shunting is simple, but it is also slow, and therefore efforts have been made at busy yards where great numbers of trains are dealt with to introduce more expeditious methods. One&nbsp;of these, employed in America, is known as “poling. ” Alongside&nbsp;the tracks on which stand the trains that are to be broken up and&nbsp;from which the sidings diverge subsidiary tracks are provided for&nbsp;the use of the shunting engines. These engines have a pole projecting horizontally in front of them, or are attached to a “ pole-car ” having such a pole. The method of working is for the pole&nbsp;to be swung out behind a number of wagons; one engine is then&nbsp;started and with its pole pushes the wagons in front of it until their&nbsp;speed is sufficient to carry them over the points, where they are&nbsp;diverted into any desired siding. It then runs back to the train&nbsp;to repeat the operation, but while it is doing so a second engine&nbsp;similarly equipped has poled away a batch of wagons on the opposite&nbsp;side. In this way a train is distributed with great rapidity, especi-ally if the points giving access to the different sidings are worked&nbsp;by power so that they can be quickly manipulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another method, which was introduced into America from Europe about 1890, is that of the summit or “ hump. ” The wagons are&nbsp;pushed by an engine at their rear up one slope of an artificial mound,&nbsp;and as they run down the other slope by gravity are switched into&nbsp;the desired siding. Sometimes a site can be found for the sorting&nbsp;sidings where the natural slope of the ground is sufficiently steep&nbsp;to make the wagons run down of themselves. One of the earliest&nbsp;and best known of such “ gravity ” yards is that at Edgehill, near&nbsp;Liverpool, on the London &amp; North-Western railway, which was&nbsp;established in 1873. Here, at the highest level, there are a number&nbsp;of “ upper reception lines ” converging to a single line which leads&nbsp;to a group of “ sorting sidings ” at a lower level. These in turn&nbsp;converge to a pair of single lines which lead </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">to</span><span class="font0"> two groups of marshalling sidings, called “ gridirons ” from their shape, and these again&nbsp;converge to single lines leading to “ lower reception and departure&nbsp;lines” at the bottom of the slope. The wagons from the upper&nbsp;reception lines are sorted into trains on the sorting sidings, and then,&nbsp;in the gridirons, are arranged in the appropriate order and marshalled&nbsp;ready to be sent off from the departure lines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Locomotive Power</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The term “ power ” is used in technical sense to mean the rate at which work is done against a resistance, and is measured&nbsp;in units of energy expended per unit of time. The unit of power&nbsp;commonly used by engineers is the horse-power, and this unit&nbsp;corresponds to a rate of working of 550 foot-℔ of work per second.&nbsp;The problems arising out of the special consideration of the&nbsp;power required to propel a railway train against the resistances&nbsp;opposing its motion, the way the power is applied to trains, the&nbsp;agent by means of which the power is exerted, are conveniently&nbsp;grouped together under the general heading of Locomotive&nbsp;Power. There are certain fundamental relations common to&nbsp;all tractive problems, and these are briefly considered in §§ 1 and&nbsp;2, after which the article refers particularly to steam locomotives,&nbsp;although §§4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 have a general application to all&nbsp;modes of traction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">§ I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fundamental Relations. —</span><span class="font1">The resistance against which a train is moved along a railway is overcome by means of&nbsp;energy obtained from the combustion of fuel, or in some few&nbsp;cases by energy obtained from a waterfall. If the total resist-ance against which the train is maintained in motion with an&nbsp;instantaneous velocity of V feet per second is R, the rate at&nbsp;which energy is expended in moving the train is represented by&nbsp;the product RV, and this must be the rate at which energy is&nbsp;supplied to the train after deducting all losses due to transmission&nbsp;from the source of power. Thus if R is equal to 10, 000 ℔ when&nbsp;the velocity is 44 ft. per second, equivalent to 30 m. per hour,&nbsp;the rate of working against the resistance is 440, 000 foot-℔ per&nbsp;second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In whatever form energy is produced and distributed to the train it ultimately appears as mechanical energy applied&nbsp;to turn one or more axles against the resistance to their rotation&nbsp;imposed by the weight on the wheels and the motion of the&nbsp;train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rate at which work is done on a particular axle is measured by the product Tω, where T is the torque or turning moment&nbsp;exerted on the axle by the motor or mechanism applied to it for&nbsp;this purpose, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ω</span><span class="font0"> is the angular velocity of the axle in radians&nbsp;per second. Hence if all the energy supplied to the train is utilized&nbsp;at one axle there is the fundamental relation</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tω = RV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Continuing the above arithmetical illustration, if the wheels to the axle of which the torque is applied are 4 ft. diameter, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ω =</span><span class="font0"> 44/2 =22&nbsp;radians per second, and therefore T = 440, 000/22 = 20, 000 ℔ ft.&nbsp;If the energy supplied is distributed between several axles the&nbsp;relation becomes</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">T<sub>1</sub>ω<sub>1</sub>+T<sub>2</sub>ω<sub>2</sub>+T<sub>3</sub>ω<sub>3</sub>... =RV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(2)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">where T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c. are the torques on the axles whose respective angular velocities arc ω<sub>1</sub>, ω<sub>2</sub>, ω<sub>3</sub>, &amp;c</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fundamental condition governing the design of all tractive machinery is that the wheels belonging to the axles to which&nbsp;torque is applied shall roll along the rails without slipping, and&nbsp;exert a tractive force on the train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fundamental relation between the applied torque and the tractive force F will be understood from fig. 16, which shows in a&nbsp;diagrammatic form a wheel and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">axle connected to the framework</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of a vehicle, in the way adopted</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">for railway trains. The journal</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the axle A, is carried in a bear-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ing or axle-box B, which is free</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to move vertically in the wide</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">vertical slot G, formed in the frame</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and called generally “ the horns; ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">under the control of the spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The weight W<sub>1</sub> carried by the part</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the frame supported by the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">wheel (whose diameter is D) is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">transmitted first to the pins P<sub>1</sub>, P<sub>2</sub>,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which are fixed to the frame, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">then to the spring links L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub>,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which are jointed at their respective ends to the spring S, the centre of which rests on the axle-box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"> Let a couple be applied to the axle tending to turn it in the direction shown by the arrow. This couple, we may assume, will be equally divided between the two wheels, so that the torque acting&nbsp;on each will be ½T. Assuming the wheels to roll along the rail&nbsp;without slipping, this couple will be equivalent to the couple formed&nbsp;by the equal opposite and parallel forces, F<sub>1</sub> acting in the direction&nbsp;shown, from the axle-box on to the frame, and F<sub>1</sub>=</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">μ0</span><span class="font0">, acting along&nbsp;the rail. The torque corresponding to this couple is F<sub>1</sub> × ½D = ½μW<sub>1</sub>D,<sub>&nbsp;</sub>and hence follows the fundamental relation, ½T = ½F<sub>1</sub>D = ½μW<sub>1</sub>D,&nbsp;or if W now represents the weight supported by the axle, F will be&nbsp;the tractive force exerted on the frame by the two axle-boxes to&nbsp;propel the vehicle, and the more convenient relation is established,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">T = ½FD = ½μWD &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (3)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If T has a greater value than this relation justifies the wheels will slip. F is called the “ tractive force ” at the rail. The coefficient&nbsp;of friction µ is a variable quantity depending upon the state of the&nbsp;rails, but is usually taken to be ⅙. This is the fundamental equation between the forces acting, however the torque may be applied.&nbsp;Multiplying through by ω we obtain</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tω = ½FωD = ½μWωD = RV &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is a fundamental energy equation for any form of locomotive in which there is only one driving-axle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The couple T is necessarily accompanied by an equal and opposite couple acting on the frame, which couple endeavours to turn the&nbsp;frame in the opposite direction to that in which the axle rotates.&nbsp;The practical effect of this opposite couple is slightly to tilt the frame&nbsp;and thus to redistribute slightly the weights on the wheels carrying&nbsp;the vehicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If there are several driving-axles in a train, the product Tω must be estimated for each separately; then the sum of the products&nbsp;will be equal to RV. In equation (4) there is a fixed relation&nbsp;between ω, V and D given by the expression</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ω = 2V∕D &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Here D is in feet, V in feet per second and ω in radians per second, If the speed is given in miles per hour, S say,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">V = 1∙466S &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The revolutions of the axle per second, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font0">, are connected with the radians turned through per second by the relation</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">n=ω∕2π = ω∕6∙38 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(7)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">§ 2. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Methods of Applying Locomotive Power. —</span><span class="font1">By locomotive</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">power is to be understood the provision of power to maintain the rates of working on the driving-axles of a train indicated by&nbsp;the relation (4). The most usual way of providing this power is&nbsp;by the combustion of coal in the fire-box of a boiler and the&nbsp;utilization of the steam produced in a steam-engine, both boiler&nbsp;and engine being carried on a frame mounted on wheels in such&nbsp;a way that the crank-shaft of the steam-engine becomes the&nbsp;driving-axle of the train. From equation </span><span class="font0">(3) </span><span class="font1">it is clear that the&nbsp;wheels of the driving-axle must be heavily loaded in order that&nbsp;F may have a value sufficiently great to propel the train. The&nbsp;maximum weight which one pair of wheels are usually allowed to&nbsp;carry on a first-class track is from 18 to 20 tons. If a larger</span></p>
