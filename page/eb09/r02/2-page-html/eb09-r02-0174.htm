<p><span class="font1">the corner turrets of which have been surmounted with trophies since 1746. The cathedral of La Rochelle (St&nbsp;Louis or St Bartholomew) is a heavy Grecian building&nbsp;(1742-1862) with a dome above the transept, erected on&nbsp;the site of the old church of St Bartholomew, destroyed&nbsp;in the 16th century and now represented by a solitary&nbsp;tower dating from the 14th century. Externally the&nbsp;town-house (1486-1607) has the appearance of a fortress&nbsp;in the Gothic style and internally that of a Renaissance&nbsp;palace. The belfries are beautifully decorated with carved&nbsp;work, and the council-chamber, where the mayor Guiton&nbsp;presided during the siege, is now adorned by his statue.&nbsp;In the old episcopal palace (which was in turn the residence of Sully, the prince of Condé, Louis XIII., and Anne&nbsp;of Austria, and the scene of the marriage of Alphonso VI.&nbsp;of Portugal with a princess of Savoy) accommodation has&nbsp;been provided for a library of 25,000 volumes, a collection&nbsp;of records going back to the 13th century, and a museum&nbsp;founded in 1842 by the society of the Friends of the Arts.&nbsp;Other buildings of note are an arsenal, an artillery museum,&nbsp;a large hospital, a special Protestant hospital, a military&nbsp;hospital, and a lunatic asylum for the department. In&nbsp;the public gardens there is a museum of natural history.&nbsp;Mediæval and Renaissance houses still give a peculiar&nbsp;character to certain districts of the town : several have&nbsp;French, Latin, or Greek inscriptions of a moral or religious&nbsp;turn and in general of Protestant origin. Of these old&nbsp;houses the most interesting is that of Henry II. or Diana&nbsp;of Poitiers. The parade-ground, which forms the principal&nbsp;public square, occupies the site of the castle, demolished in&nbsp;1590. Some of the streets have side-arcades ; the public&nbsp;wells are fed from a large reservoir in the Champ de Mars ;&nbsp;and among the promenades are the Cours des Dames with&nbsp;the statue of Admiral Duperré (1869), and, outside, the&nbsp;tree-planted ramparts and the Mail, a beautiful piece of&nbsp;greensward. In this direction are the sea-bathing establishments. La Rochelle, besides a celebrated manufactory&nbsp;of barrels, contains saw-mills, copper and iron foundries,&nbsp;and factories for patent fuel made out of coal dross. In&nbsp;1882 465 vessels (225,449 tons) entered and 431 (215,820)&nbsp;cleared. Coals from England and iron-ore from Spain are&nbsp;among the staple imports. In the neighbourhood the&nbsp;principal industries are getting salt from the marshes and&nbsp;rearing oysters and mussels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">La Rochelle existed at the close of the 10th century under the name of Rupella. In 1199 it received a communal charter from&nbsp;Eleanor, duchess of Guienne, and it was in its harbour that John&nbsp;Lackland disembarked when he came to try to recover the domains&nbsp;seized by Philip Augustus. Captured by Louis VIII. in 1224, it&nbsp;was restored to the English in 1360 by the treaty of Brétigny, but&nbsp;it shook off the yoke of the foreigner when Duguesclin recovered&nbsp;Saintonge. During the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries La Rochelle,&nbsp;then an almost independent commune, was one of the great maritime&nbsp;cities of France. From its harbour iu 1402 Jean de Béthencourt&nbsp;set out for the conquest of the Canaries, and its seamen were the&nbsp;first to turn to account the discovery of the New World. The salt-tax provoked a rebellion at Rochelle which Francis I. had to come&nbsp;to repress in person ; in 1568 the town secured exemption by the&nbsp;payment of a large sum. At the Reformation La Rochelle early&nbsp;became one of the chief centres of Calvinism, and during the religious wars it armed privateers which preyed on Catholic vessels in&nbsp;the Channel and the high seas. In 1571 a synod of the Protestant&nbsp;churches of France was held within its walls under the presidency&nbsp;of Beza for the purpose of drawing up a confession of faith. After&nbsp;the massacre of St Bartholomew, La Rochelle held out for six&nbsp;and a half months against the Catholic army, which was ultimately&nbsp;obliged to raise the siege after losing more than 20,000 men. The&nbsp;peace of 24th June 1573, signed by the people of La Rochelle in&nbsp;the name of all the Protestant party, granted the Calvinists full&nbsp;liberty of worship in several places of safety. Under Henry IV.&nbsp;the town remained quiet, but under Louis XIII. it put itself again&nbsp;at the head of the Huguenot party. Its vessels blockaded the&nbsp;mouth of the Gironde and stopped the commerce of Bordeaux, and&nbsp;also seized the islands of Ré and Oléron and several vessels of the&nbsp;royal fleet. It was then that Richelieu resolved to subdue the town&nbsp;once for all. In spite of the assistance rendered by the English&nbsp;troops under Buckingham and in spite of the fierce energy of their&nbsp;mayor Guiton, the people of La Rochelle were obliged to capitulate&nbsp;after eight months’ siege (October 1628). During this investment&nbsp;Richelieu raised the celebrated mole which cut off the town from&nbsp;the open sea. La Rochelle then became the principal port for the&nbsp;trade between the mother-country of France and the colony of&nbsp;Canada. But the revocation of the Edict of Nantes deprived it of&nbsp;3000 of its most industrious inhabitants, and the loss of Canada by&nbsp;France completed the ruin of its commerce. Its privateers, however,&nbsp;still maintained a vigorous struggle with the English during the&nbsp;republic and the empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROCHESTER, an episcopal city and municipal and parliamentary borough of Mid-Kent, is situated on the&nbsp;Medway, on the Medway Canal, and on the London, Chatham, and Dover and the South-Eastern railway lines, 33&nbsp;miles east of London, contiguous to Chatham and Strood.&nbsp;Here the river is crossed by a railway bridge and by an iron&nbsp;swing bridge for carriage traffic, erected to take the place&nbsp;of a stone bridge destroyed in 1856. The present bridge&nbsp;occupies the site of that which spanned the Medway before&nbsp;the Conquest. On the eminence overlooking the right bank&nbsp;of the river and commanding a wide view of the surrounding country are the extensive remains of the Norman castle&nbsp;which is generally supposed to have been built by Gun-dulph, bishop of Rochester, towards the close of the llth&nbsp;century, and which was besieged by King John, by Simon&nbsp;de Montfort in the reign of Henry III., and in the reign of&nbsp;Richard II. by a party of rebels during the insurrection&nbsp;of Wat Tyler. It was repaired by Edward IV., but soon&nbsp;afterwards fell into decay, although the massive keep is&nbsp;still in good preservation. The cathedral was originally&nbsp;founded by Augustine in 604, but was partially destroyed&nbsp;by the Danes, and was rebuilt by Bishop Gundulph in the&nbsp;beginning of the 12th century. Though a comparatively&nbsp;small building, being only 310 feet in length and 68 in&nbsp;breadth at the nave, it is of considerable architectural&nbsp;interest, the most remarkable feature being the Norman&nbsp;west front with a richly sculptured door. There is a large&nbsp;number of monuments of great antiquity. In the garden&nbsp;of the deanery there are portions of the wall of St Andrew’s&nbsp;priory, founded about the same time as the cathedral.&nbsp;Among the principal public buildings of a secular character&nbsp;are the town-hall (1687), the corn exchange (1871), the&nbsp;county court offices (1862), the working men’s institute&nbsp;(1880), and the Richard Watts’s almshouses, in the Tudor&nbsp;style. Besides these almshouses there are a number of&nbsp;other charities. The principal schools are the cathedral&nbsp;grammar-school, founded in the reign of Henry VIII., and&nbsp;the Williamson mathematical school, formerly for the sons&nbsp;of freemen, but now open to all. The oyster fishing is&nbsp;of some importance, and there is a considerable shipping&nbsp;trade, a quay and landing-place having been erected by&nbsp;the corporation at great expense. In 1883 the number&nbsp;of vessels that entered the port was 5969 of 855,019 tons&nbsp;burden, and the number that cleared 5496 of 709,040 tons.&nbsp;There is a large steam-engine manufactory. Rochester&nbsp;returned two members to parliament down to 1885, when&nbsp;it was deprived of one. The population of the borough&nbsp;(area,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> 2909 acres) in 1871 was 18,352, and in 1881 it&nbsp;was 21,307 ; this includes 5395 persons in the town of&nbsp;Strood, situated on the opposite side of the Medway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rochester was the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Durobrivæ</span><span class="font0"> of the Romans, and was intersected by the Roman Watling Street from Canterbury.
