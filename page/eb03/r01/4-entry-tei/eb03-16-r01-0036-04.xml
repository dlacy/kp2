Οηε of them has ſcarce any branches ; but is furniſhed with numerous leaves^ which are narrow, ſmooth, channelled on the upper ſurſace ; and the plant is about 11 feet high. The Egyptians make ropes of the leaves. They lay them in water like hemp, and then make them into good ſtrong cables. Theſe, with the bark of the date-tree, form almoit tlie only cable uſed in the Nile. The other fort is of great con-ſequence. It is a ſmall reed, about two or three feet high, full branched, with ſhort, ſharp, lancet-ſhaped leaves. The roots, which are as thick as the ſtem, creep and mat themſelves together to a conſiderable dr-ſtance. This plant ſeems uſeleſs in common life : but to it, continues the learned author, is the very foil of Egypt owing : for the matted roots have ſtopped the earth which floated in the waters, and thus formed, out of the ſea, a country that is habitable.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Fire-RKEDs.</hi> See <hi rend="italic">FiRE-Ship.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Reed,</hi> a term in the weſt of England for the ſtraw uſed by thatchers, which is wheat ſtraw finely combed, conſiſting of ſtiff, unbruiſed, and unbroken ſtalks of great length, carefully ſeparated from the ſtraw uſed for fodder by the threſher, and bound in ſheaves or nitches, each of which weighs 28 lb. and are fold from 21 s. to 31 s. per hundred nitches, according to the ſeaſon. This is a great improvement in the art of thatching, as it gives a finiſh to the work which- cannot be attained by ſtraw, rough and tumbled together, without any ſeparation of the long and ſhort : it alſo is a readier mode of working.</p>
