<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">urbis).</span><span class="font2"> Rutilius boasts his career to have been no less distinguished than his father’s, and particularly indicates&nbsp;that he had been secretary of state </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">[magister officiorum)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and governor of the capital (i. 157, 427, 467, 561). It is&nbsp;probable that a certain Namatius named in the Theodosian&nbsp;Code (6, 27, 15) as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">magister officiorum</span><span class="font2"> of the year 412 is&nbsp;no other than our poet. The true literary man is apt to&nbsp;be inordinately proud of political distinction, and Rutilius&nbsp;celebrates his own praises in a style worthy of Cicero or&nbsp;Pliny. At all events, he had lived long in the great world&nbsp;of the Western empire, and knew much of the inner history&nbsp;of his time. After reaching manhood, he had passed&nbsp;through the tempestuous period that stretches between the&nbsp;death of Theodosius (395) and the fall of the usurper&nbsp;Attalus, which occurred near the date when our poem was&nbsp;written. He had witnessed the chequered career of Stilicho&nbsp;as actual, though not titular, emperor of the West ; he had&nbsp;seen the hosts of Radagaisus rolled back from Italy, only&nbsp;to sweep over the helpless provinces of Gaul and Spain,&nbsp;the defeats and triumphs of Alaric, the three sieges and&nbsp;final sack of Rome, followed by the marvellous recovery of&nbsp;the city, Heraclian's vast armament dissipated by a breath,&nbsp;and the fall of seven pretenders to the Western diadem.&nbsp;Undoubtedly the sympathies of Rutilius were with those&nbsp;who during this period dissented from, and, when they&nbsp;could, opposed, the general tendencies of the imperial policy.&nbsp;We know from himself that he was the intimate of distinguished men who belonged to the circle of the great&nbsp;orator Symmachus,—men who had scouted Stilicho’s compact with the Goths, and had led the Roman senate to&nbsp;support the pretenders Eugenius and Attalus in the&nbsp;vain hope of reinstating the gods whom Julian had failed&nbsp;to save.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While making but few direct assertions about historical characters or events, the poem, by its very texture and spirit and&nbsp;assumptions, forces on us important conclusions concerning the&nbsp;politics and religion of the time, which are not brought home to&nbsp;us with the same directness by any other authority. The attitude&nbsp;of the writer towards paganism is remarkable. The whole poem&nbsp;is intensely pagan, and is penetrated by the feeling that the world&nbsp;of literature and culture is and must remain pagan, that outside&nbsp;paganism lies a realm of barbarism. The poet wears an air of&nbsp;exalted superiority over the religious innovators of his day, and&nbsp;entertains a buoyant confidence that the future of the ancient gods&nbsp;of Rome will not belie their glorious past. Invective and apology&nbsp;he scorns alike, nor troubles himself to show, with Claudian, even&nbsp;a suppressed grief at the indignities put upon the old religion by&nbsp;the new. As a statesman, he is at pains to. avoid offending those&nbsp;politic Christian senators over∙ whom pride in their country had at&nbsp;least as great power as attachment to their new religion. Only&nbsp;once or twice does Rutilius speak directly of Christianity, and&nbsp;then only to attack the monks, whom the temporal authorities&nbsp;had hardly as yet recognized, and whom, indeed, only a short&nbsp;time before, a Christian emperor had forced by thousands into&nbsp;the ranks of his army. Judaism Rutilius could assail without&nbsp;wounding either pagans or Christians, but he intimates, not&nbsp;obscurely, that he hates it chiefly as the evil root whence the&nbsp;rank plant of Christianity had sprung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We read in Gibbon that “ Honorius excluded all persons who were adverse to the catholic church from holding any office in the&nbsp;state,” that he “obstinately rejected the service of all those who&nbsp;dissented from his religion,” and that “the law was applied in&nbsp;the utmost latitude and rigorously executed.” Far different is&nbsp;the picture of political life impressed upon us by Rutilius. His&nbsp;voice is assuredly not that of a partisan of a discredited and over-borne faction. We see by the aid of his poem a senate at Rome&nbsp;composed of past office-holders, the majority of whom were&nbsp;certainly pagan still. We discern a Christian section whose&nbsp;Christianity was political rather than religious, who were Romans&nbsp;first and Christians afterwards, whom a new breeze in politics&nbsp;might easily have wafted back to the old religion. Between these&nbsp;two sections the broad old Roman toleration reigns. Some&nbsp;ecclesiastical historians have fondly imagined that after the sack&nbsp;of Rome the bishop Innocent returned to a position of practical&nbsp;predominance. No one who fairly reads Rutilius can cherish&nbsp;this idea. The air of the capital, perhaps even of Italy, was&nbsp;still charged with paganism. The court was far in advance of&nbsp;the people, and the persecuting laws were in large part incapable&nbsp;of execution.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps the most interesting lines in the whole poem are those in which Rutilius assails the memory of “dire Stilicho,” as he&nbsp;names him. Stilicho, “fearing to suffer all that had caused&nbsp;himself to be feared,” annihilated those defences of Alps and&nbsp;Apennines which the provident gods had interposed between the&nbsp;barbarians and the Eternal City, and planted the cruel Goths, his&nbsp;“skin-clad” minions, in the very sanctuary of the empire. His&nbsp;wile was wickeder than the wile of the Trojan horse, than the wile&nbsp;of Althæa or of Scylla. May Nero rest from all the torments of&nbsp;the damned, that they may seize on Stilicho, for Nero smote his&nbsp;own mother, but Stilicho, the mother of the world !</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We shall not err in supposing that we have here (what we find nowhere else) an authentic expression of the feeling entertained by&nbsp;a majority of the Roman senate concerning Stilicho. He had but&nbsp;imitated the policy of Theodosius with regard to the barbarians ;&nbsp;but even that great emperor had met with passive opposition from&nbsp;the old Roman families. The relations, however, between Alaric&nbsp;and Stilicho had been closer and more mysterious than those&nbsp;between Alaric and Theodosius, and men who had seen Stilicho&nbsp;surrounded by his bodyguard of Goths not unnaturally looked&nbsp;on the Goths who assailed Rome as Stilicho’s avengers. It is&nbsp;noteworthy that Rutilius speaks of the crime of Stilicho in terms&nbsp;far different from those used by Orosius and the historians of the&nbsp;lower empire. They believed that Stilicho was plotting to make&nbsp;his son emperor, and that he called in the Goths in order to climb&nbsp;higher. Rutilius holds that he used the barbarians merely to save&nbsp;himself from impending ruin. The Christian historians assert&nbsp;that Stilicho designed to restore paganism. To Rutilius he is&nbsp;the most uncompromising foe of paganism. His crowning sin&nbsp;(recorded by our poet alone) was the destruction of the Sibylline&nbsp;books—a sin worthy of one who had decked his wife in the spoils&nbsp;of Victory, the goddess who had for centuries presided over the&nbsp;deliberations of the senate. This crime of Stilicho alone is&nbsp;sufficient in the eyes of Rutilius to account for the disasters that&nbsp;afterwards befell the city, just as Merobaudes, a generation or two&nbsp;later, traced the miseries of his own day to the overthrow of the&nbsp;ancient rites of Vesta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With regard to the form of the poem, Rutilius handles the elegiac couplet with great metrical purity and freedom, and&nbsp;betrays many signs of long study in the elegiac poetry of the&nbsp;Augustan era. The Latin is unusually clean for the times, and is&nbsp;generally fairly classical both in vocabulary and construction. The&nbsp;taste of Rutilius too is comparatively pure. If he lacks the genius&nbsp;of Claudian, he also lacks his overloaded gaudiness and his large&nbsp;exaggeration, and the directness of Rutilius shines by comparison&nbsp;with the laboured complexity of Ausonius. It is common to call&nbsp;Claudian the last of the Roman poets. That title might fairly be&nbsp;claimed for Rutilius, unless it be reserved for Merobaudes. At&nbsp;any rate in passing from Rutilius to Sidonius no reader can fail to&nbsp;feel that he has left the region of Latin poetry for the region of&nbsp;Latin verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the many interesting details of the poem we can only mention a few. At the outset we have an almost dithyrambic address to&nbsp;the goddess Roma, whose glory has ever shone the brighter for&nbsp;disaster, and who will rise once more in her might and confound&nbsp;her barbarian foes. The poet shows as deep a consciousness as any&nbsp;modern historian that the grandest achievement of Rome was the&nbsp;spread of law. Next we get incidental but not unimportant&nbsp;references to the destruction of roads and property wrought by the&nbsp;Goths, to the state of the havens at the mouths of the Tiber and&nbsp;the general decay of nearly all the old commercial ports on the coast.&nbsp;Most of these were as desolate then as now. Rutilius even exaggerates&nbsp;the desolation of the once important city of Cosa in Etruria,&nbsp;whose walls have scarcely changed from that day to ours. The&nbsp;port that served Pisæ, almost alone of all those visited by Rutilius,&nbsp;seems to have retained its prosperity, and to have foreshadowed the&nbsp;subsequent greatness of that city. At one point on the coast the&nbsp;villagers everywhere were “ soothing their wearied hearts with holy&nbsp;merriment,” and were celebrating the festival of Osiris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All existing MSS. of Rutilius are later than 1494, and are copies from a lost copy of an ancient MS. once at the monastery of Bobio<sub>1</sub> which disappeared about&nbsp;1700. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">editiο princeps</span><span class="font0"> is that by J. B. Pius (Bologna, 1520), and the principal editions since have been those by Barth (1623), P. Burman (1731, in his edition&nbsp;of the minor Latin poets), Wernsdorf (1778, part of a similar collection), Zumpt&nbsp;(1840), and the critical edition by Lucian Miiller (Teubner, Leipsic, 1870). MiilIer&nbsp;writes the poet’s name as Claudius Rutilius Namatianus, instead of the usual&nbsp;Rutilius Claudius Namatianus-; but if the identification of the poet’s father with&nbsp;the Claudius mentioned in the Theodosian Code be correct, Miiller is probably&nbsp;wrong. Rutilius receives more or less attention from all writers on the history&nbsp;or literature of the times, but a lucid chapter in Beugnot, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de lα Destruction du Paganisme en Occident</span><span class="font0"> (1835), may be especially mentioned. It should be&nbsp;noted that in using the passage concerning Stilicho we have ventured to read the&nbsp;line at ii. 45 thus—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hiacae cladis détérioré dolo;</span><span class="font0"> the change from the MSS.&nbsp;reading </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Illatae cladis Hberiore dolo</span><span class="font0"> (preserved in all editions) seems demanded&nbsp;by the context, as well as by the sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J.
