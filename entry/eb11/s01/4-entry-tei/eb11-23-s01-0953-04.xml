                <p><label>SAAR</label>, a river of Germany, a right-bank tributary of the Mosel. It
                    rises in the Donon, an eminence of the Vosges, close to the Franco-German
                    frontier, and flows at first north, then north-west and finally north again to
                    its junction with the Mosel</p>

                <p>at Konz. Its length is 143 m. The middle part of its valley is an important
                    industrial district, with coal-mines and a variety of manufactures; the Saar
                    wines are also well known. The principal towns on the Saar are Saargemünd,
                    Saarbrücken and St Johann (which face each other across the river), Saarlouis
                    and Saarburg. The river is navigable up to Saargemünd, a distance of 75 m. From
                    here there is connexion with the Rhine-Marne canal by way of the Saar canal,
                    built in 1862, and 40 m. in length, following the Saar valley upwards for about
                    half that distance.</p>
