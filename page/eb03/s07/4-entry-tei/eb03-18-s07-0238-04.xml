 in botany : A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">decandria,</hi> and to the order of <hi rend="italic">monogynia ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem arranged under the 54th older, <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneae.</hi> The calyx is quinquefid. There are five petals ; the nectarium is cylindrical, ſupporting the antheræ with its mouth. The caplule is five-celled, woody, and opening at the mouth. The ſeeds are imbricated and winged, There is only one ſpecies, the mahagoni, which is a native of the warmeſt parts of America, and grows alſo<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0245.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0239"/>
in the iſland of Cuba, Jamaica, Hiſpaniola, and the Bahama iſlands. It abounded formerly in the low lands of Jamaica, but it is now found only on high hills and places difficult of acceſs.</p><p>It thrives in moſt ſoils, but varies in texture and grain according to the nature of the ſoil. On rocks it is of a ſmaller ſize, but very hard and weighty, of a cloſe gram, and beautifully ſhaded ; while the produce of the low and richer lands is obſerved to be more light and porous, of a paler colour and open grain ; and that of mixed ſoils to hold a medium between both. The tree grows very tall and ſtraight, and is uſually four feet in diameter ; the flowers are or a reddiſh or ſaffron colour, and the fruit of an oval form, and about the ſize of a turkey’s egg.</p><p>The wood is generally hard, takes a fine poliſh, and is found to anſwer better than any other sort in all kinds of cabinet ware. It is now univerſally eſteemed, and tells at a good price ; but it is pity that it is not cultivated in the more convenient waste lands of Jamaica. It is a very ſtrong timber, and anſwers very well in beams, joiſts, plank, boards, and ſhingles ; and has been frequently put to thoſe uſes in Jamaica in former times. It is laid to be uſed ſometimes in ſhip-building ; a purpoſe for which it is remarkably adapted, if not too coſtly, being very durable, capable of refilling gun-ſhots, and burying the ſhots without ſplintering.</p><p>The ſeed-veſſels are of a curious form, conſiſting of a large cone splitting into five parts, and diſcloſing its winged ſeeds, diſpoſed in the regular manner of thoſe of an apocynum. The ſeeds being winged, are diſperſed on the ſurface of the ground, where ſome falling into the chinks of the rocks, ſtrike root ; then creep out on the ſurface of it, and ſeek another chink, into which they creep and ſwell to ſuch a ſize and ſtrength, that at length the rock ſplits, and is forced to admit of the root’s deeper penetration ; and with this little nutriment the tree increaſes to a ſtupendous ſize in a few years.</p><p>The first uſe to which mahogany was applied in England, was to make a box for holding candles. Dr Gibbons, an eminent physician in the latter end of the laſt and beginning of the preſent century, had a brother, a West India captain, who brought over ſome planks of this wood as ballaſt. As the Doctor was then building him a houſe in King-ſtreet, Covent-Garden, his brother thought they might be of ſervice to him. But the carpenters, finding the wood too hard for their tools, they were laid aſide for a time as uſeleſs. Soon after, Mrs Gibbons wanting a candle-box, the Doctor called on his cabinet maker (Wollaſton in Long-Acre) to make him one of ſome wood that lay in his garden. Wollaſton alſo complained that it was too hard. The Doctor laid he muſt get stronger tools. The candle-box was made and approved ; inſomuch, that the Doctor then inſiſted on having a bureau made of the ſame wood, which was accordingly done; and the fine colour, poliſh, &amp;c. were ſo pleaſing, that he invited all his friends to come and ſee it. Among them was the ducheſs of Buckingham. Her Grace begged ſome of the same wood of Dr Gibbons, and employed Wollaſton to make her a bureau alſo ; on which the same of mahogany and Mr Wollaſton was much raiſed, and things of this sort became general. This account was given by Henry Mill, Eſq; a gentleman of undoubted veracity.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
