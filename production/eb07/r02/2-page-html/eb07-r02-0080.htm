<p><span class="font1">in Teutonic song as those of Arthur and of Charlemagne in France and Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As in all other cases of the kind, a real conqueror, the fame of whose exploits survived in tradition, was adopted&nbsp;as the central object, around whom were to be assembled a&nbsp;set of champions, and with whose history was to be interwoven the various feats of courage which they performed,&nbsp;and the adventures which they underwent. Theodorick&nbsp;King of the Goths, called in these romantic legends Dide-rickof Bern </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(be.</span><span class="font1"> Verona,) was selected for this purpose by&nbsp;the German Minnesingers. Among the principal personages introduced are Ezzel, King of the Huns, who is no&nbsp;other than the celebrated Attila ; and Gunter, King of Burgundy, who is identified with a Guntacher of history who&nbsp;really held that kingdom. The good knight Wolfram von&nbsp;Eschenbach seems to have been the first who assembled&nbsp;the scattered traditions and minstrel tales concerning these&nbsp;sovereigns into one large volume of German verse, entitled&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heldenbuch,</span><span class="font1"> or the Book of Heroes. In this the author&nbsp;has availed himself of the unlimited licence of a romancer ;&nbsp;and has connected with the history of Didcrick and his chivalry a number of detached legends which had certainly a&nbsp;separate and independent existence. Such is the tale of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sigurd the Horny,</span><span class="font1"> which has the appearance of having originally been a Norse saga. An analysis of this singular&nbsp;piece was published by Mr. Weber, in a work entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrations of Northern Antiquities from the earlier Teutonic and Scandinavian Romances;</span><span class="font1"> and the subject has been&nbsp;fully illustrated by tlle publications of the learned Von der&nbsp;Hagen in Germany, and those of </span><span class="font0">tlle </span><span class="font1">Hon. William Herbert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is here only necessary to say, that Theodorick, like Charlemagne and Arthur, is considered in the romance as&nbsp;a monarch more celebrated for the valorous achievements&nbsp;of the brotherhood of chivalry whom he has drawn around&nbsp;him, than for his own, though neither deficient in strength&nbsp;nor courage. His principal followers have each their discriminatory and peculiar attributes. Meister Hildebrand,&nbsp;the Nestor of the band, is, like the Maugis of Charlemagne’s&nbsp;heroes, a magician as well as a champion. Hogan, or Hagan, begot betwixt a mortal and a sea-goblin, is the fierce&nbsp;Achilles of the confederation. It is the uniform custom of&nbsp;the romancers to conclude by a general and overwhelming&nbsp;catastrophe, which destroys the w<sup>,</sup>hole ring of chivalry&nbsp;whose feats they had commemorated. The ruin which&nbsp;Roncesvalles brought to the Paladins of Charlemagne, and&nbsp;the fatal battle of Camlan to the Knights of the Round Table, fell upon the warriors of Diderick through the revengeful treachery of Crimhilda, tlle wife of Ezzel ; who, in revenge for the death of her first husband, and in her inordinate desire to possess the treasures of the Niflunga or&nbsp;Burgundians, brought destruction on all those celebrated&nbsp;champions. Mr. Weber observes that these German fictions differ from the romances of French chivalry, in the&nbsp;greater ferocity and less refinement of sentiment ascribed&nbsp;to the heroes ; and also in their employing to a great extent&nbsp;the machinery of the Duergar, or dwarfs, a subterranean&nbsp;people to whom the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heldenbuch</span><span class="font1"> ascribes much strength&nbsp;and subtilty, as well as profound skill in the magic art, and&nbsp;who seem, to a certain extent, the predecessors of the European fairy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Italy, so long the seat of classical learning, and where tllat learning was first revived, seems never to have strongly embraced the taste for the Gothic romance. They received, indeed, the forms and institutions of chivalry, but the&nbsp;Italians seem to have been in a considerable degree strangers to its spirit, and not to have become deeply enamoured of its literature. There is an old romance of chivalry&nbsp;proper to Italy, called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guerino the Wretched,</span><span class="font1"> but we doubt&nbsp;if even this be of indigenous growth. Indeed, when they&nbsp;did adopt from the French the fashionable tales of Charlemagne and his Paladins, these did not attract the attention&nbsp;of the classical Italians, until Boiardo, Bemi, Pulci, and,&nbsp;above all, the divine Ariosto, condescended to use them as&nbsp;thc basis of their well-known romantic poems ; and thus&nbsp;the fictitious narratives originally composed in metre, and&nbsp;afterwards rewritten in prose, were anew decorated with the&nbsp;honours of verse. The romantic poets of Italy did not even&nbsp;disdain to imitate the rambling, diffuse, and episodical style&nbsp;proper to the old romance ; and Ariosto, in particular, although he torments the reader’s attention, by digressing&nbsp;from one adventure to another, delights us, upon frequent&nbsp;perusals, by the extreme ingenuity with which he gathers&nbsp;up the broken ends of his narrative, and finally weaves them&nbsp;all handsomely together in the same piece. But the merits&nbsp;and faults of romantic poetry form themselves the fruitful&nbsp;subject of a long essay. We here only notice the origin of&nbsp;those celebrated works, as a species of composition arising&nbsp;out of the old romance, though surpassing it in regularity,&nbsp;as well as in all the beauties of style and diction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With Spain the idea of romance was particularly connected ; and the associations which are formed upon perusing the immortal work of Cervantes, induce us for a long time to believe that the country of Don Quixote must be&nbsp;the very cradle of romantic fiction. Yet, if we speak of&nbsp;priority of date, Spain was amongst the last nations in Europe with whom romance became popular. It was not indeed possible that, among a people speaking so noble and&nbsp;poetical a language, engaged in constant wars, which called&nbsp;forth at once their courage and their genius, there should&nbsp;not exist many historical and romantic ballads descriptive&nbsp;of their rencounters with the Moors. But their native poets&nbsp;seem to have been too much engaged with the events of&nbsp;their own age, and of that which had just preceded it,&nbsp;to permit of their seeking subjects in the regions of pure&nbsp;fiction ; and we have not heard of a Spanish metrical romance, unless the poems describing the adventures of the&nbsp;Cid should be supposed to have any affinity to that class&nbsp;of composition. The Penineula, however, though late in&nbsp;adopting tlle prevailing taste for romantic fiction, gave origin to one particular class, which was at least as popular as&nbsp;any which had preceded it. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis de Gaul,</span><span class="font1"> the production, it would seem, of Vasco de Lobeira, a Portuguese&nbsp;knight, who lived in the fourteenth century, gave a new&nbsp;turn to the tales of chivalry, and threw into the shade the&nbsp;French prose romances, which, until the appearance of this&nbsp;distinguished work, had been the most popular in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amadis,</span><span class="font1"> in order, perhaps, to facilitate the other changes which he introduced, and to avoid rushing against preconceived ideas of events or character, laid&nbsp;aside the worn-out features of Arthur and Charlemagne,&nbsp;and imagined to himself a new dynasty both of sovereigns&nbsp;and of heroes, to whom he ascribed a style of manners much&nbsp;more refined, and sentiments much more artificial, than had&nbsp;occurred to the authors of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perceval</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perceforest.</span><span class="font1"> Lobeira had also taste enough to perceive, that some unity of&nbsp;design would be a great improvement on the old romance,&nbsp;where one adventure is strung to another with little connection from the beginning to the end of the volume ; which&nbsp;thus concluded, not because the plot was winded up, but because the author’s invention, or the printer’s patience, was&nbsp;exhausted. In the work of the Portuguese author, on the&nbsp;contrary, he proposes a certain end, to advance or retard&nbsp;which all the incidents of the work have direct reference.&nbsp;This is the marriage of Amadis with Oriana, against w hich&nbsp;a thousand difficulties are raised by rivals, giants, sorcerers,&nbsp;and all the race of evil powers unfavourable to chivalry ;&nbsp;whilst these obstacles are removed by the valour of the&nbsp;hero, and constancy of the heroine, succoured on their part&nbsp;by those friendly sages, and blameless sorceresses, whose&nbsp;intervention gave so much alarm to the tender-conscienccd&nbsp;De la Noue. Lobeira also displayed considerable attention&nbsp;to the pleasure which arises fπ m the contrast of character ;</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
