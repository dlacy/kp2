<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of the question, How the disadvantages arising from the abolition of trade guilds might be removed. His memoir,&nbsp;greatly enlarged, was published in 1816 under the title&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ueber </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">das Zunftxoesen xtnd die Foi gen seiner A ufhebung.</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">He&nbsp;was then favourable to the continued existence of trade&nbsp;corporations on a reformed basis, but afterwards abandoned&nbsp;this view. In the same year appeared his </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Primx lineæ&nbsp;historic ]*)litices.</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In .1818 he became professor at Erlangen. He competed successfully in 1820 for a prize offered&nbsp;by the academy of Haarlem for the best essay on the causes&nbsp;of poverty ; and in the same year he published a translation, characterized by Roscher as “free, but very good,” of&nbsp;Storch’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cours d’Économie Politique,</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">with notes and additions of his own. In 1822 he was called to the chair of&nbsp;political economy at Heidelberg, where the rest of his life&nbsp;was spent, in the main, in teaching and research. He&nbsp;took some part, however, in public affairs : in 1837 he was&nbsp;nominated a member of the first chamber of the duchy of&nbsp;Baden, and did good service in that capacity ; and in 1851&nbsp;he was one of the commissioners sent to England on the&nbsp;part of the Zollverein to study the Industrial Exhibition.&nbsp;A result of this mission was his account of the agricultural&nbsp;implements exhibited at London </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(Die </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">landwirthschaftlichen&nbsp;Gerathe </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">der Londoner </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ausstellung,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1853). He was elected&nbsp;a corresponding member of the French Institute in 1856.&nbsp;After a useful and honourable career he died at Heidelberg on 18th March 1870.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">His principal work is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lchrbuch dcr politischen Oelconomic </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1826-37), an encyclopaedia of the economic knowledge of his&nbsp;time, written with a special view to the guidance of practical men.&nbsp;The doctrines are, in the main, those of Smith and Say ; hut they&nbsp;are treated in an independent manner, and the conclusions of his&nbsp;predecessors are modified, especially by giving larger scope to the&nbsp;action of the state. The three volumes are respectively occupied&nbsp;with (1) political economy, properly so called, or the theory of&nbsp;wealth, (2) administrative science ( </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Volksxmrthschaftspolitik),</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and (3)&nbsp;finance. The two last he recognizes as necessarily admitting of&nbsp;variations in accordance with the special circumstances of different&nbsp;countries, whilst the first is more akin to the exact sciences, and&nbsp;is in many respects capable of being treated, or at least illustrated,&nbsp;mathematically. This threefold division marks his close relation&nbsp;to the older German cameralistic writers, with whose works he was&nbsp;familiarly acquainted. It is a consequence in part of his conformity&nbsp;to their method and his attention to administrative applications&nbsp;that his treatise was found peculiarly adapted for the use of the&nbsp;official class, and long maintained its position as their special textbook. He was the economic teacher, says Roscher, of the well-governed middle states of Germany from 1815 to 1848. The book&nbsp;has passed through many editions ; in that of 1870 by Adolf Wagner&nbsp;it was transformed into a new book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the earlier part of his scientific life Rau tended strongly towards the relative point of view and an historical method in&nbsp;economics. But, though in his great work he kept clear of the&nbsp;exaggerated abstraction of the Ricardians and rejected some of&nbsp;their </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a priori</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> assumptions, he never joined the historical school.&nbsp;To the end he occupied a somewhat indeterminate position with&nbsp;respect to that school ; on the whole, however, he more and more&nbsp;subordinated historical investigation to immediate practical interests, and in his economic politics moved in the direction of&nbsp;limiting rather than extending the sphere of state action. His&nbsp;general merits are thoroughness of treatment, accuracy of statement, and balance of judgment ; he shows much industry in the&nbsp;collection and skill in the utilization of statistical facts ; and his&nbsp;exposition is orderly and clear. Roscher finds in his earlier works&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">spirituel</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> charm which disappears in the later.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Besides the publications already mentioned, he was author of the following:—</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ueber den Luxus,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1817 ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ansichten der Staatswirth-schaft 'init besonderer Beziehung auf Deutschland,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1820 ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Malthus&nbsp;und Say iiber die Ursachen der jetzigen Handelsstockung,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1821 ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gruxidriss der Kameralwissenschaft oder Wirthschaftslchre,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1823 ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ueber die Kameralwissenschaft, Entwickelung ihres JVesens und&nbsp;ihrer Theile,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1825 ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ueber die Landwirthschaft der Bheinpfalz,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1830; an academic oration </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">De vi naturae in rempublica.m,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1831 ;&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Geschichte des Pfluges,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1845.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rau founded in 1834 the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Archiv der politischen Oekonomie und Polizeiwissenschaft,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> in which he wrote a number of articles, afterwards issued in separate form : amongst them may be named, those&nbsp;on the debt of Bauen, on the accession of Baden to the Zollverein,&nbsp;on the crisis of the Zollverein in the summer of 1852, on the&nbsp;American banks, on the new English poor law, on List’s national</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">system of political economy, and on the minimum size of a peasant property. This enumeration will give an idea of the extent and&nbsp;variety of his researches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAUCH, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Christian Daniel </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1777-1857), one of the most celebrated sculptors of modern times, was born at&nbsp;Arolsen in the principality* of Waldeck on the 2d of&nbsp;January 1777. The opening career of the young artist&nbsp;was attended with considerable difficulty, his parents being&nbsp;poor and unable to place him under efficient masters.&nbsp;His first instructor taught him little else than the art of&nbsp;sculpturing grave-stones, and Professor Ruhl of Cassel&nbsp;could not give him much more. A wider field of improvement opened up before him when he removed to Berlin in&nbsp;1797 ; but poverty still hampered all his efforts. He was&nbsp;obliged to earn a livelihood by becoming a royal lackey,&nbsp;and to reserve the prosecution of his favourite art for his&nbsp;spare hours. The genius of Rauch, however, soon forced&nbsp;itself into notice and recommended him to several persons&nbsp;of influence who were able to give him assistance. Queen&nbsp;Louisa, surprising him one day in the act of modelling her&nbsp;features in wax, sent him to study at the Academy of Art.&nbsp;Not long afterwards, in 1804, Count Sandrecky gave him&nbsp;the means to complete his education at Rome, where&nbsp;William von Humboldt, Canova, and Thorwaldsen befriended him. Under such patronage the young sculptor&nbsp;made rapid progress. Among other works, he executed&nbsp;bas-reliefs of Hippolytus and Phaedra, Mars and Venus&nbsp;wounded by Diomede, and a Child praying. In 1811&nbsp;Rauch entered upon the eminent part of his career, when&nbsp;he Avas commissioned to execute a monument for Queen&nbsp;Louisa of Prussia. The statue, representing the queen&nbsp;in a sleeping posture, was placed in a mausoleum in the&nbsp;grounds of Charlottenburg, and procured great fame for&nbsp;the artist. Commissions for portraits came pouring in&nbsp;upon him. The consummate tact with which he seized&nbsp;individual characteristics and the artistic manner in which&nbsp;he treated them at once established his reputation. The&nbsp;erection of nearly all public statues came to be entrusted to&nbsp;him. He began to execute that long series of representations of great Germans in which his genius is exhibited to&nbsp;full advantage. In course of time almost every important&nbsp;town throughout the country possessed a bust of some&nbsp;eminent statesman, patriot, or man of genius from his&nbsp;chisel. There were, among others, Blücher at Breslau,&nbsp;Maximilian at Munich, Francke at Halle, Dürer at Nuremberg, Luther at Wittenberg, and the grand-duke Paul&nbsp;Frederick at Sch Averin. At length, in 1830, he commenced, along Avith Schinkel the architect, the models for&nbsp;a colossal monument at Berlin to Frederick the Great.&nbsp;This Avork was inaugurated with great pomp in May 1851,&nbsp;and has ever since been regarded as one of the masterpieces&nbsp;of modern sculpture. On a granite pedestal 25 feet in&nbsp;height stands the colossal equestrian statue of the king.&nbsp;His plain pinched features and his grotesque costume are&nbsp;given Avith historical exactness Avithout impairing the&nbsp;artistic effect. An air of resistless majesty ennobles the&nbsp;mean countenance, and a bold and skilful treatment hides&nbsp;the absurdity of the garb. The excellence of his masterpiece was recognized throughout the Avorld. Princes decorated him with honours. The academies of Europe&nbsp;enrolled him among their members. Especially did his&nbsp;OAvn sovereign and countrymen regard him with proud&nbsp;affection and respect. A statue of Kant for Königsberg&nbsp;and a statue of Thaer for Berlin occupied his attention&nbsp;during some of his last years; and he had just finished a&nbsp;model of Moses praying betAveen Aaron and Hur Avlien he&nbsp;was attacked by his last illness. He died on 3d December&nbsp;1857.</span></p>
