(James), a polite and learned cardinal of the Romiſh church, born at Modena in 1477. Leo X. made him and Peter Bembus his ſecretaries, an office for which they were both well qualified; and Sadolet was ſoon after made biſhop of Carpentras, near Avignon: he was made a cardinal in 1536 by Paul III. and employed in ſeveral negociations and embaſſies. He died in 1547, not without the ſuſpicion of poiſon, for correſponding too familiarly with the Proteſtants, and for teſtifying too much regard for ſome of their doctors. His works, which are all in Latin, were collected in 1607 at Mentz, in one volume 8vo. All his contemporaries ſpoke of him in the higheſt terms.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SAFE-guard,</hi> a protection formerly granted to a ftranger who feared violence from ſome of the king’s ſubjects for ſeeking his right by courſe of law.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SAFE-Conduct,</hi> is a ſecurity given by a prince under the great ſeal, to a ſtranger for his <hi rend="italic">ſafe-coming</hi> into and paſſing out of the realm; the form whereof is in <hi rend="italic">Reg.
