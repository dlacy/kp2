in eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, a modern ſect that originated in Scotland about the year 1728; where it is at this time diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi rend="italic">Glaſſites,</hi> after its founder Mr John Glaſs, who was a miniſter of the eſtabliſhed church in that kingdom; but being charged with a deſign of ſubverting the national covenant, and ſapping the foundation of all national eſtabliſhments by the kirk judicatory, was expelled by the ſynod from the church of Scotland. His ſentiments are fully explained in a tract publiſhed at that time, intitled, “The Teſtimony of the King of Martyrs, ” and preſerved in the firſt volume of his works. In conſequence of Mr Glaſs’s expulſion, his adherents formed themſelves into churches, conformable in their inſtitution and diſcipline to what they apprehended to be the plan of the firſt churches recorded in the New Teſtament. Soon after the year 1755, Mr Robert Sandeman, an elder in one of theſe churches in Scotland, publiſhed a ſeries of letters addreſſed to Mr Hervey, occaſioned by his Theron and Aſpaſio; in which he endeavours to ſhow, that his notion of faith is contradictory to the ſcripture account of it, and could only ſerve to lead men, profeſſedly holding the doctrines commonly called <hi rend="italic">Cαlviniſticic,</hi> to eſtabliſh their own righteouſneſs upon their frames, inward feelings, and various acts of faith. In theſe letters Mr Sandeman attempts to prove, that faith is neither more nor leſs than a ſimple aſſent to the divine teſtimony concerning Jeſus Chriſt, recorded in the New Teſtament; and he maintains, that the word <hi rend="italic">ſaith,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">belief,</hi> is conſtantly uſed by the apoſtles to ſignify what is denoted by it in common diſcourſe, viz. a perſuaſion of the truth of any propoſition, and that there is no difference between believing any common teſtimony, and believing the apoſtolic teſtimony, except that which reſults from the nature of the teſtimony itſelf. This led the way to a controverſy, among thoſe who were called <hi rend="italic">Calvinists,</hi> concerning the nature of juſtifying faith; and thoſe who adopted Mr Sandeman’s notion of it, and who took the denomination of <hi rend="italic">Sαηde- manians,</hi> formed themſelves into church order, in ſtrict fellowſhip with the churches in Scotland, but holding no kind of communion with other churches. The chief opinions and practices in which this ſect differs from other Chiſtians, are, their weekly adminiſtration of the Lord’s Supper; their love-feaſts, of which every member is not only allowed but required to partake, and which conſiſt of their dining together at each other’s houſes in the interval between the morning and afternoon ſervice; their kiſs of charity uſed on this occaſion, at the admiſſion of a new member, and at other times, when they deem it to be neceffary or proper; their weekly collection before the Lord’s Supper, for the ſupport of the poor, and defraying other expences; mutual exhortation; abſtinence from blood and things ſtrangled; waſhing each other’s feet, the precept concerning which, as well as other precepts, they</p><p>underſtand literally; community of goods, ſo far as that every one is to conſider all that he has in his poſſeſſion and power as liable to the calls of the poor and church; and the unlawfulneſs of laying up treaſures on earth, by ſetting them apart for any diſtant, future, and uncertain uſe. They allow of public and private diverſions, ſo far as they are not connected with circumſtances really ſinful; but apprehending a lot to be ſacred, diſapprove of playing at cards, dice, &amp;c. They maintain a plurality of elders, pallors, or biſhops, in each church; and the neceſſity of the preſence of two elders in every act of diſcipline, and at the adminiſtration of the Lord’s Supper. Jn the choice of theſe elders, want of learning, and engagements in trade, &amp;c. are no ſufficient objection but ſecond marriages diſqualify for the office; and they are ordained by prayer and failing, impoſition of hands, and giving the right hand of fellowſhip. In their diſcipline they are ſtrict and ſevere; and think themſelves obliged to ſeparate from the communion and worſhip of all ſuch religious ſocieties as appear to them not to profeſs the ſimple truth for their only ground of hope, and who do not walk in obedience to it. We ſhall only add, that in every church tranſaction, they eſteem unanimity to be abſolutely neceſſary. From this abſtract of the account which they have publiſhed of their tenets and practices, it does not ſeem to be probable that their number ſhould be very conſiderable.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
