<p><span class="font0">and vigour, before the ſuccours which he apprehended were coming from Europe, obliged him to raiſe the&nbsp;ſiege. Achmed inſtantly obeyed, railed a battery of&nbsp;17 large cannon againſt the baſtion of Italy, and quickly after made himſelf maſter of it, obliging the garriſon&nbsp;to retire farther into the city. Here the grand-maſter&nbsp;was forced to demoliſh two of the churches, to prevent&nbsp;the enemy’s ſeizing on them; and, with their materials,&nbsp;cauſed ſome new works and entrenchments to be made&nbsp;to hinder their proceeding farther.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Turks, however, gained ground every day, though they ſtill loſt vaſt numbers of their men: at&nbsp;length the 30th of November came, when the grand-maſter, and both the beſiegers and beſieged, thought&nbsp;the laſt aſſault was to be given. The baſhaw Pyrrus,&nbsp;who commanded it, led his men directly to the entrenchments; upon which the bells of all the churches&nbsp;ſounded the alarm. The grand-maſter, and his few&nbsp;knights, troops, and citizens, ran in crowds, and in a&nbsp;confuſed diſorderly manner, to the entrenchments, each&nbsp;fighting in his own way, or rather as his fear directed&nbsp;him. This attack would have proved one of the moſt&nbsp;deſperate that had yet been felt, had not a moſt vehement rain intervened, which carried away all the earth&nbsp;which the enemy had reared to ſerve them as a rampart&nbsp;againſt the artillery of the baſtion of Auvergne; ſo that&nbsp;being now quite expoſed to their continual fire, they&nbsp;fell in ſuch great numbers, that the baſhaw could no&nbsp;longer make them ſtand their ground, but all precipitately fled towards their camp. This laſt repulfe threw&nbsp;the proud ſultan into ſuch a fury, that none of his officers dared to come near him; and the ſhame of his having now ſpent near ſix whole months with ſuch a numerous army before the place, and having loſt ſuch myriads of his brave troops with ſo little advantage, had&nbsp;made him quite deſperate, and they all dreaded the&nbsp;conſequences of his reſentment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pyrrus at length, having given it time to cool, ventured to approach him, and propoſe a new project to him, which, if approved, could hardly fail of ſucceſs;&nbsp;which was, to offer the town a generous capitulation;&nbsp;and he obſerved, that in caſe the ſtubborn knights ſhould&nbsp;reject it, yet being now reduced to ſo ſmall a number,&nbsp;as well as their forces and fortifications almoſt deſtroyed,&nbsp;the citizens, who were moſt of them Greeks, and leſs&nbsp;ambitious of glory than ſolicitous for their own preſer-vation, would undoubtedly accept of any compoſition&nbsp;that ſhould ſecure to them their lives and effects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This propoſal being reliſhed by the ſultan, letters were immediately diſperſed about the city in his name,&nbsp;exhorting them to ſubmit to his government, and&nbsp;threatening them at the fame time with the moſt&nbsp;dreadful effects of his reſentment if they perſiſted in&nbsp;their obſtinacy. Pyrrus likewiſe diſpatched a Genoeſe&nbsp;to approach as near as he could to the baſtion of Auvergne, and to intreat the knights to take pity of ſo&nbsp;many of their Chriſtian brethren, and not expoſe them&nbsp;to the dreadful effects which muſt follow their refuſal&nbsp;of a capitulation, ſo generouſly offered them at their&nbsp;laſt extremity. Other agents were likewiſe employed&nbsp;in other places: to all of whom the grand-maſter ordered ſome of his men to return this anſwer, That his&nbsp;order never treated with infidels but with ſword in&nbsp;hand. An Albanian was ſent next with a letter from&nbsp;the ſultan to him, who </span><span class="font1">met </span><span class="font0">with the </span><span class="font1">fame </span><span class="font0">repulſe;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">after which, he ordered his men to fire upon any that ſhould preſent themſelves upon the ſame pretence;&nbsp;which was actually done. But this did not prevent&nbsp;the Rhodians from liſtening to the terms offered by&nbsp;the Turks, and holding frequent cabals upon that ſub-ject; in which the general maſſacre of a town taken by&nbsp;aſſault, the dreadful ſlavery of thoſe that eſcaped, the&nbsp;rape of their wives and daughters, the deſtruction of&nbsp;their churches, the profanation of their holy relics&nbsp;and ſacred utenſils, and other dire conſequences of an&nbsp;obſtinate refuſal, being duly weighed againſt the ſul-tan’s offers, quickly determined them which party to&nbsp;take. The grand-maſter, however, proving inexorable&nbsp;to all their intreaties, they applied to their Greek metropolitan, who readily went and repreſented all theſe&nbsp;things to him in the moſt pathetic terms: Yet he met&nbsp;with no better reception; but was told, that he and&nbsp;his knights were determined to be buried under the&nbsp;ruins of the city if their ſwords could no longer defend it, and he hoped their example would not permit them to ſhow leſs courage on that occaſion. This&nbsp;anſwer produced a quite contrary effect; and, as the&nbsp;citizens thought delays dangerous at ſuch a juncture,&nbsp;they came in a body to him by the very next morning,&nbsp;and plainly told him, that if he paid no greater regard to their preſervation, they would not fail of taking the moſt proper meaſures to preſerve the lives&nbsp;and chaſtity of their wives and children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This reſolution could not but greatly alarm the grand-maſter; who thereupon called a council of all&nbsp;the knights, and informed them himſelf of the condition of the place. Theſe all agreed, particularly the&nbsp;engineer Martinengo, that it was no longer defenſible,&nbsp;and no other reſource left but to accept the ſultan’s&nbsp;offers; adding, at the ſame time, that though they were&nbsp;all ready, according to the obligations of their order,&nbsp;to fight to the laſt drop of their blood, yet it was no leſs&nbsp;their duty to provide for the ſafety of the inhabitants,&nbsp;who, not being bound by the ſame obligations, ought&nbsp;not to be made a ſacrifice to their glory. It was&nbsp;therefore agreed, with the grand-maſter’s conſent, to&nbsp;accept of the next offers the ſultan ſhould make. He&nbsp;did not let them wait long: for the fear he was in of&nbsp;a freſh ſuccour from Europe, the intrepidity of the&nbsp;knights, and the ſhame of being forced to raiſe the&nbsp;ſiege, prevailed upon him to hang out his pacific flag,&nbsp;which was quickly anſwered by another on the Rhodian ſide; upon which the Turks, coming out of their&nbsp;trenches, delivered up the ſultan’s letter for the grand-maſter, to the grand-prior of St Giles, and the engineer Martinengo. The terms offered in it by Soly-man appeared ſo advantageous, that they immediately&nbsp;exchanged hoſtages; and the knights that were ſent&nbsp;to him had the honour to be introduced to him, and&nbsp;to hear them confirmed by his own mouth, though not&nbsp;without threats of putting all to fire and ſword in caſe&nbsp;of refuſal, or even delay. Two ambaſſadors were&nbsp;forthwith ſent to him, to demand a truce of three&nbsp;days to ſettle the capitulation and intereſts of the inhabitants, who were part Greeks and part Latins;&nbsp;but this was abfolutely refuſed by the impatient monarch, out of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">ſuſpicion of the rumoured ſuccour being near, and that the truce was only to gain time till&nbsp;it was come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He therefore ordered the hoſtilities to be renewed</span></p>
