By this means the filament EF, which would have ſtruck the ſurface in G, is deflected <hi rend="italic">before it arrives at</hi>  the ſurface, and deſcribes a curved path EFIHK, continuing its rectilineal motion to I, where it is inter-cepted by a filament immediately adjoining to EF, on the fide of the middle filament DC. The different particles of DC may be ſuppoſed to impinge in fucceſſion at C, and to be deflected at right angles ; and gliding along CB, to eſcape at B. Each filament in ſucceſſion, outwards from DC, is deflected in its turn ; and being hindered from even touching the ſurface C B, it glides off in a direction parallel to it ; and thus EF is deflected in I, moves parallel to CB from Ito H, and is again deflected at right angles, and deſcribes H K parallel to DC. The ſame thing may be ſuppoſed to happen on the other ſide of DC.</p><p>And thus it would appear, that except two filaments immediately adjoining to the line DC, which bifects the ſurface at right angles, no part of the fluid makes any impulſe on the furface AB. All the other filaments are merely preffed againſt it by the lateral filaments without them, which they turn aſide, and prevent from ſtriking the ſurface.</p><p>In like manner, when the fluid ſtrikes the edge of a priſm or wedge ACB (fig. 7.), it cannot be ſaid-that any real impulfe is made. Nothing hinders us from fuppoſing C a mathematical angle or indiviſible point, not fufceptibiè of any impulſe, and ſerving merely to di-vide the ſtream. Each filament EF is effectually pre-vented from impinging at G in the line of its. direction, and with the obliquity of incidence EGC, by the filaments between EF and DC, which glide along the furface CA ; and it may be ſuppoſed to be deflected when it comes to the line CF which bifects the angle DCA, and again deflected and rendered parallel to D C at I. The lame thing happens on the other ſide of DC ; and we cannot in this caſe affert that there is any impulſe.</p><p>we now ſee plainly how the ordinary theory muſt be totally unfit for furniſhing principles of naval architec-ture, even although a formula could be deduced from fueh a feri.es of experiments as thoſe. of the French Aca-demy. Although we ſhould know preciſely the im-pulſe, or, to ſpeak now more cautiouſly, the action, of the fluid on a furface G L (fig8.) of any obliquity, when it is alone, detached from all others, we cannot' in the ſmalleſt degree tell what will be the action of <hi rend="italic">part</hi>  of a ſtream of ſtuid advancing towards it, with the fame obliquity, when it is preceded by an adjoining fur-face CG, having a different inclination ; for the ſtuid will not glide along G L in the ſame manner as if it made part of a more extenfive furface having the ſame inclination. The previous deflexions are extremely different in theſe two caſes ; and the previous deflections are the only changes which we can obſerve in the motions of the fluid, and the only cauſes of that pfeffure which we obferve the body to ſuſtain* and which we call the impulfe on it. This theory muſt, therefore, be quite unfit for afcertaining the action on a curved furface, which may be confidered as made up of an indeſi-n∙ite number of ſucceſſive planes.</p><p>We now feewit⅛ equal evidence how it happens that</p><p>the action of fluids on ſolid bodies may and muſt be oppoſed by preffures, and may be compared with and mea-ſured by the preffure of gravity, we are not compa-ring forces of different kinds&gt; percuſſions with-preffwesj but preffures with each other. Let us ſee whether this view of the ſubject will afford us any method ol compariſon or abſolute meafurement.</p><p>when a filament cf fluid, that is, a row- of corpuſcles, are turned out of their courſe EF (ſig. 6. ), and forced to take another courſe IH, force is required to produce this change of direction. The filament is prevented from proceeding by other filaments which lie between it and the body, and which deflect it in the ſame manner as if it were contained in a bended tube, and it will prefs on the concave filament next to it as it would prefs on the concave ſide of the tube. Suppoſe ſuch a bend-ed tube ABE (ſig. 9.), and that a ball A is projected along it with any velocity, and moves in it without fric∙ tron : it is demonftrated, in elementary mechanics, that the ball will move with undiminilhed velocity, and will preſs on every point, fuch as B, of the concave ſide of the tube, in a direction BF perpendicular to the plane CBD, which touches the tube in the point B* This preffure on the adjoining filament, on the concave ſide of its path, muſt be withſtood by that filament which deflects it ; and it muſt be propagated aeroſs that Alarment to the next, and thus augment the preffure upon that next filament already preffed by the deflection of the intermediate filament and thus there is a preffure towards the middle filament, and towards the body, ari-ſing from the deflection of all the outer filaments ; and their accumulated ſum muſt be conceived as immediate* ly exerted on the middle filaments and on the body, be* cauſe a perfect ſiuid tranſmits every preffure undimi» niſhed.</p><p>The preffure BF is equivalent to the two BH, BG, one of which is· perpendicular, and. tlie other parallel, to the direction, of the original motion. By the ſirſt (taken in any point of the curvilineal motion of any filament), the two halves of the ſtream are preffed together ; and in the caſe of ſig. 6. and 7. exactly balance each other.. But the preffures, ſuch as BG, muſt be ultimately withſtood by the ſurface ACB ; and it is by theſe accumulated preffures that the ſolid body is urged down the ſtream ;.and it is theſe accumulated preffures which we obſerve and meafure in our experiments. WC ſhall anticipate a little, and ſay that ibis moſt eaſily de-monſtrated, that when a ball A (ſig. 9. ) moves with un-diminiſhed velocity in a tube ſo incurvated that its axis at E is at right angles to its axis at A, the accumulated action of the preii’ures, ſuch as&lt; B G-, taken for every point of the path, is preciſely equal to the force which would produce or extinguiſh the original motion.</p><p>This being the caſe, it follows moſt obvioufly, that if the. two motions oſ the filaments are ſuch as we have de-ſcribed and repreſented by fig. 6. the whole preffure in the direction of the ſtream, that is, the whole preffure which can be obſerved on the ſurface, is equal to the weight of a column of fluid having the ſarface for its baſe, and twice the fall productive of the velocity for its height, pre-ciſely as Newtcn deduced it from other conſiderations ; and it feems to make no odds whether the fluid be elaſ-tic or unelaſtic, if the deflections and velocities are the fame.
