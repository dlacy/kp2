Yet the loſs of property may be eaſily repaired; the loſs of honour is irreparable! It is vain to plead in alleviation of this guilt, that women ſhould be on their guard againſt the arts of the ſeducer. Moſt unqueſtionably they ſhould; but arts have been uſed which hardly any degree of caution would have been ſufficient to counteract. It may as well be ſaid that the trader ſhould be on his guard againſt the arts of the forger, and accept of no bill without previouſly conſulting him in whoſe name it is written. Caſes, indeed, occur in trade, in which this caution would be impoſſible; but he muſt be little acquainted with the workings of the human heart, who does not know that ſituations like- wiſe occur in life, in which it is equally impoſſible for a girl of virtue and tenderneſs to reſiſt the arts of the man who has completly gained her affections.</p><p>The mentioning of this circumſtance leads us to conſider another ſpecies of ſeduction, which, though not ſo highly criminal as the former, is yet far removed from innocence; we mean the practice which is too prevalent among young men of fortune of employing every art in their power to gain the hearts of heedleſs girls whom they reſolve neither to marry nor to rob of their honour. Should a man adhere to the latter part of this reſolution, which is more than common fortitude can always promiſe for itſelf, the injury which he does to the object of his amuſement is yet very great, as he raiſes hopes of the moſt ſanguine kind merely to diſappoint them, and diverts her affections perhaps for ever from ſuch men as, had they been fixed on one of them, might have rendered her completely happy. Diſappointments of this kind have ſometimes been fatal to the unhappy girl; and even when they have neither deprived her of life, nor diſordered her reaſon, they have often kept her wholly from marriage, which, whatever it be to a man, is that from which every woman expects her chief happineſs. We cannot therefore conclude this article more properly than with warning our female readers not to give up their hearts haſtily to men whoſe ſtation in life is much higher than their own; and we beg leave to aſſure every one of them, that the man who ſolicits the laſt favour under the moſt ſolemn promiſe of a ſubſequent marriage, is a baſe ſeducer, who prefers a momentary gratification of his own to her honour and happineſs through life, and has no intention to fulfil his promiſe. Or, if he ſhould by any means be compelled to fulfil it, ſhe may depend upon much ill treatment in return for her premature compliance with his baſe deſires.</p><p>SEDUM, <hi rend="smallcaps">orpine,</hi> in botany: A genus of the pentagynia order, belonging to the decandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 13th order, <hi rend="italic">Succulenta.</hi> The calyx is quinqueſid; the corolla is pentapetalous, pointed, and ſpreading; there are five nectariferous ſquamæ or ſcales at the baſe of the germen. The capſules are five.</p><p>The ſpecies are 20 in number. 1. The Verticillatum; 2. Telephium; 3. Anacampſeros; 4. Aizoon; 5. Hybridum; 6. Populifolium; 7. Stellatum; 8. Cepaea; 9. Libanoticum; 10.

The following ſpecies are the moſt remarkable.</p><p>1. The telephium, common orpine, or live-long, hath a perennial root, compoſed of many knobbed tubercles, ſending up erect, round, ſucculent ſtalks, branching half a yard or two feet high, garniſhed with oblong, plane, ſerrated, ſucculent leaves, and the ſtalks terminated by a leafy corymbus of flowers, of different colours in the varieties. This ſpecies is an inhabitant of woods and dry places in England, &amp;c. but has been long a reſident of gardens for variety and medical uſe. 2. The anacampſeros, or decumbent evergreen Italian orpine, hath a fibrous perennial root, decumbenti or trailing ſtalks, wedge-ſhaped entire leaves, and the ſtalks terminated by a corymbus of purple flowers. 3. The rupeſtre, rock ſedum, or ſtone-crop of St Vincent’s rock, hath ſlender, trailing, purple ſtalks; ſhort, thick, awl- ſhaped, ſucculent, glaucous leaves in clutters, quinqueſariouſly imbricated round the ſtalks, and the ſtalks terminated by roundiſh cymoſe bunches of bright yellow flowers. It grows naturally on St Vincent’s rock near Briſtol, and other rocky places in Europe. 4. The aizoon, or Siberian yellow orpine, hath a tuberculate, fibrous, perennial root; many upright, round, ſucculent, ſtalks, a foot high; lanceolated, plane, ſerrated, thickiſh leaves; and the ſtalks terminated by a cloſe-fitting cymoſe cluſter of bright yellow flowers. 5. The reflexum, reflexed ſmall yellow ſedum, or prick-madam, hath a ſlender fibrous perennial root; ſmall trailing ſucculent ſtalks, garniſhed with thick, awl-ſhaped, ſucculent leaves ſparſedly, the lower ones recurved, and the ſtalks terminated by reflexed spikes of bright yellow flowers. It grows naturally on old walls and buildings in England, &amp;c. 6. The acre, acrid ſedum, common ſtone-crop of the wall, or wall-pepper, hath ſmall ſibry roots, very ſlender ſucculent ſtalks four or five inches high, very ſmall, ſuboval, gibbous, erect, alternate leaves, cloſe together, and the ſtalks terminated by trifid cymoſe bunches of ſmall yellow flowers. This fort grows abundantly on rocks, old walls, and tops of buildings, almoſt everywhere, which often appear covered with the flowers in ſummer. 7. The ſexangulare, or ſexangular ſtone-crop, hath a fibry perennial root; thick, ſhort, ſucculent ſtalks; ſmall, ſuboval, gibbous, erect leaves cloſe together, arranged fix ways imbricatim, and the ſtalks terminated by bunches of yellow flowers. It grows on rocky and other dry places in England, &amp;c<hi rend="italic">. </hi>8. The album, or white ſtone-crop, hath ſibry perennial roots; trailing ſlender ſtalks, ſix or eight inches long; oblong, obtuſe, ſeſſile, ſpreading leaves; and the ſtalks terminated by branchy cymoſe bunches of white flowers. This grows on old walls, rocks, and buildings, in England, &amp;c. 9. The hiſpanicum, or Spaniſh ſedum, hath</p><p>fibrous perennial roots, crowned with cluſters of taper, acute, ſucculent leaves; ſlender ſucculent ſtalks, four or five inches high, garniſhed alſo with taper leaves, and terminated by downy cymoſe cluſters of white flowers.</p><p>All theſe ſpecies of ſedum are hardy herbaceous ſucculent perennials, durable in root, but moſtly annual in ſtalk, &amp;c. which, riling in ſpring, flower in June, July, and Auguſt, in different ſorts; the flowers confiſting univerſally of five ſpreading petals, generally crowning the ſtalks numerouſly in corymboſe and cymoſe bunches and ſpikes, appearing tolerably conſpicuous, and are</p></body></text></TEI>
