<p><span class="font0">and the empire, and a profound conviction, derived from the Vaudois and Paterinc doctrines, that the church could only&nbsp;be purified by the renunciation of temporal wealth. Finding&nbsp;Rome already revolutionized in accordance with his own ideas,&nbsp;he immediately began to preach there. His mystic exhortations against the riches of the church had an inflammatory&nbsp;effect, while his classical reminiscences aroused the enthusiasm of the Romans, and his suggestion that they should imitate&nbsp;the republican institutions of upper Italy met the necessities&nbsp;of the time that had created the revolution. He urged the&nbsp;reconstitution of the ancient senate and senatorial order, which&nbsp;indeed was already partially accomplished, and of the ancient&nbsp;equestrian order, and the reconstruction and fortification of the&nbsp;Capitol. His proposed senate was a body somewhat resembling&nbsp;the communal councils of upper Italy, his equestrian order a&nbsp;mounted force composed of the lesser nobility, since at Rome,&nbsp;as elsewhere, the lower classes had neither time nor means to&nbsp;form part of it. All his suggestions were accepted; the citizens&nbsp;laboured strenuously on the fortification of the Capitol. The&nbsp;pope soon beheld the revolution spread beyond the walls, and&nbsp;several cities of the state proclaimed their independence. The&nbsp;barons of the Campagna profited by the opportunity to act as&nbsp;independent sovereigns. Thus the whole domain of the church&nbsp;was threatened with dissolution. The pope marched towards&nbsp;Rome with his newly gathered army, but hoped to come to&nbsp;terms. The Romans in fact recognized his authority, and&nbsp;he in his turn recognized the republic. The office of patrician&nbsp;was abolished, and seems to have been replaced by that&nbsp;of gonfalonier, and the prefect, answering to the podestà&nbsp;of the other republics, was revived. The senators received&nbsp;investiture from the pope, who returned to Rome at Christmas&nbsp;1145- <sup>!</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There public now seems to have been fully constituted. The senate was drawn from the lower classes and the petty nobility,&nbsp;and this was the special characteristic of the new revolution.&nbsp;In 1144 there were fifty-six senators, probably four to each of&nbsp;the fourteen regions, but the number often varied. By the few&nbsp;existing documents of the period we notice that the senators&nbsp;were divided into </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">senator es consiliarii</span><span class="font0"> and ordinary senators.&nbsp;The former constituted a smaller council, which, like the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">credenza</span><span class="font0"> or lesser council found in other cities, consulted with&nbsp;the head or heads of the republic on the more urgent and secret&nbsp;affairs of the state. And, conjointly with the rest of the&nbsp;senators, it formed the greater council. Thus classic traditions&nbsp;were identified with new republican usages, and the commonwealth of Rome resembled those in other parts of Italy. But,&nbsp;of course, every republic had special local customs of its own.&nbsp;So the Roman senate had judicial as well as political attributes,&nbsp;and there was a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curia senatus</span><span class="font0"> composed of senators and legal&nbsp;experts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As was easily to be foreseen, the agreement with the pope was of short duration. The revolution could not be checked;&nbsp;the Romans desired independence, and their spiritual lord fled&nbsp;to France, whence, in 1147, he proclaimed a new crusade, while&nbsp;the Romans were employed in demolishing Tivoli, banishing its&nbsp;inhabitants, and waging war on other cities. Giordano Pier-leone was gonfalonier and head of the republic, and Arnold,&nbsp;supported by the popular favour and the enthusiasm of the&nbsp;lower clergy,- was preaching with even greater fervour than&nbsp;before. But the pope now re-entered Italy, proclaimed Arnold&nbsp;a schismatic, and then advancing to Tusculum assembled an&nbsp;army in order to attack Rome. In this emergency the Romans&nbsp;applied to Conrad III., the first emperor of the house of Hohcn-staufen; and their urgent letters are clearly expressive of&nbsp;Arnold's theories and his medley on ancient and modern, sacred&nbsp;and profane, ideas. “ Rome,” so they said, “ is the fountain&nbsp;of the empire confided to you by the Almighty, and we seek to&nbsp;restore to Rome the power possessed by her under Constantine&nbsp;and Justinian. For this end we conquered and destroyed the&nbsp;strongholds of the barons who, together with the pope and the&nbsp;Normans, sought to resist us. These are now attacking us on&nbsp;all sides. Haste to Rome, the capital of the world, thus to&nbsp;establish thy imperial sway over the Italian and German&nbsp;lands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After long hesitation the king of the Romans at last replied to these appeals, stating that he would come “ to re-establish&nbsp;order, reward the faithful, and punish the rebellious.” These&nbsp;words promised ill. In fact Conrad had already arranged terms&nbsp;with the pope; but his fife came to an end on the 15th of&nbsp;February 1152.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was succeeded by Frederick I. surnamed Barbarossa, who took no notice of the numerous letters urging him to come and&nbsp;receive the empire from the Roman people, which&nbsp;alone had the right of conferring it. In accordance&nbsp;with his design of subduing all the independent cities,&nbsp;he made an agreement with the pope, in which he vowed to give&nbsp;no truce to the Romans, but subject them to their spiritual&nbsp;lord, whose temporal power should be restored. The pope, on&nbsp;his side, promised to crown him emperor. Thereupon the&nbsp;people again rose to arms, and Arnold broke off aU negotiations&nbsp;with Eugenius III. The senate was reorganized, formed of&nbsp;one hundred members, and, according to the old Roman precedent, had two consuls, one for internal and the other for&nbsp;external affairs. Frederick was a daring statesman, a valiant&nbsp;soldier in command of a powerful army, and was no friend of&nbsp;half measures. Accordingly the nobles ventured on reaction.&nbsp;Finally, to increase the gravity of the situation, an English jx&gt;pe,&nbsp;Adrian IV., was elected (1154-59), who was also a man of strong&nbsp;and resolute temper. In fact, even before being able to take&nbsp;possession of the Lateran, he requested the Romans to banish&nbsp;Arnold, who, with greater eloquence than ever, was directing&nbsp;his thunders against the papacy. These utterances increased&nbsp;the wrath of Adrian, who, encouraged by the knowledge that&nbsp;Frederick and his host were already in Italy, at last launched an&nbsp;interdict against Rome. It was the first time that a pope had&nbsp;ventured to curse the Eternal City. The interdict put a summary stop to the religious life of the inhabitants. Men's minds&nbsp;were seized with a sudden terror, and a fierce tumult broke out.&nbsp;Thereupon the senators, whose opposition to the pope was less&nbsp;courageous than that of the fallen magnates, prostrated themselves at his feet and implored pardon. But Adrian demanded&nbsp;the expulsion of Arnold before consenting to raise the interdict.&nbsp;Arnold was therefore obliged to leave Rome. After having for&nbsp;nine years preached successfully in favour of liberty, after having&nbsp;been the moving spirit of the new revolution, the new constitution, he was now abandoned by all, and forced to wander&nbsp;from castle to castle, in the hope of reaching some independent&nbsp;city capable of shielding him from the fierce enmity of the pope.&nbsp;Meanwhile Frederick I. had achieved his first victories in Lop-bardy, and, leaving ruined cities and bloodshed in his track,&nbsp;was rapidly advancing towards central Italy. The pope sent&nbsp;three cardinals to him, with a request for the capture and consignment of Arnold, who had taken refuge in the castle of the&nbsp;Visconti of Gampagnatico. Frederick without delay caused&nbsp;one of the Visconti to be seized and kept prisoner until Arnold&nbsp;was given up, and then consigned the latter to the papal legates.&nbsp;The pope in his turn gave the reformer into the hands of the&nbsp;prefect, Pietro di Vico, who immediately hanged his&nbsp;prisoner, burnt his body at the stake and cast his&nbsp;ashes into the Tiber. The execution took place in June&nbsp;1155. The exact date and place of it are unknown; we only know&nbsp;that Arnold met his fate with great serenity and firmness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the Romans who had so basely deserted their champion would not give up their republic. Their envoys went to meet&nbsp;Frederick near Sutri, and made an address in the usual fantastic&nbsp;style on the privileges of the Roman people and its sole right to&nbsp;confer the imperial crown. But Frederick indignantly cut short&nbsp;their harangue, and they had to depart full of rage. He then&nbsp;continued his march, and, entering Rome on the 18th of June&nbsp;1155, was forthwith crowned in St Peter’s by the pope. Thereupon the Romans rushed to arms, and made a furious attack on&nbsp;the Leonine city and the imperial camp. A desperate battle&nbsp;went on throughout the day; and the knights proved that the&nbsp;equestrian order instituted at Arnold's suggestion was no empty</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
