(anc. geog.), a people of Gallia Celtica, ſituated on the Sequana to the ſouth of the Pariſii, near the confluence of the Jeauna or Yonne with the above-mentioned river. Their moſt conſiderable exploit was their invaſion of Italy, and taking and burning <hi rend="smallcaps">Rome,</hi> as related under that article. This was done by a colony of them long before tranſported into Italy, and ſettled on the Adriatic. Their capital, Agendicum in Gaul, was in the lower age called <hi rend="italic">Senones,</hi> now <hi rend="italic">Sens.</hi> In Italy the Senones extended themſelves as far as the river Aeſis; but were afterwards driven beyond the Rubicon, which became the boundary of Gallia Ciſalpina, (Polybius, Strabo.)</p></div></body></text></TEI>
