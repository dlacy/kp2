the capital of Bolivia, formerly known as Chuquisaca, but renamed in honour of General Sucre, the first president of the republic. Lying in 19° 2' 45" S. lat. and 65° 17' W. long., at a height of 9183 feet above the sea, in a valley which drains southwards to the Pilcomayo (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Plate River),</hi> it enjoys an agreeable climate and has its markets well supplied with fruits and vegetables. The city is the seat of the archbishopric of La Plata and Char- cas, founded in 1609, and contains a magnificent cathedral and several imposing churches and convents. For a long time the university and colleges of Chuquisaca were among the most frequented in South America, and they are still of some note. The inhabitants, who are mainly of Indian origin, are variously stated to number 24,000 (Ondarza) and 12,000 <hi rend="italic">(Almanac de Gotha).</hi></p><p>The Spanish city of Chuquisaca was founded in 1539 on the site of a Peruvian town, whose original name survived the Spanish designation of Ciudad la Plata. It became in 1609 the seat of tho supreme court of justice for the South American colonies—“Real Audiencia de la Plata y Charcas”—Charcas being the name of a native tribe often given to the Chuquisaca district, and even to the city (Maria de las Charcas).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
