<p><span class="font0">more or less spindle-shaped, never transversely placed. The walls of the stomach are thrown into longitudinal folds which&nbsp;contain the specific gastric glands, whilst glands are absent in&nbsp;the oesophagus, excepting scattered and very simple slime&nbsp;glands. The circular muscular fibres of the stomach are much&nbsp;stronger than the longitudinal fibres. The end of the stomach&nbsp;is generally marked by a pyloric valve. The walls of the mid&nbsp;gut arc said to be devoid of glands. The end gut, marked by&nbsp;a circular valve, is considerably wider and there is a caecum,&nbsp;mostly left-sided, largest in leaf-eating lizards, rarely absent, as,&nbsp;for instance, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis.</span><span class="font0"> The absorbent portion of the rectum&nbsp;is always strongly marked off from the cloaca by a circular fold&nbsp;or sphincter, which projects into the widened coprodaeum of the&nbsp;cloaca. In those lizards which, like </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Varanns,</span><span class="font0"> have no urinary&nbsp;bladder, there are two successive sphincters, marking off two&nbsp;chambers, one, the upper or innermost, for the reception of the&nbsp;faeces, the lower for that of the urine. In adult crocodiles the&nbsp;stomach is transformed into a gizzard; it is more or less oval,&nbsp;with a wide fundus and with two opposite apo-neurotic or&nbsp;tendinous disks whence radiate the muscular fibres. The&nbsp;muscular walls remain, however, comparatively thin, like those&nbsp;of birds of prey. There is a distinct pyloric stomach and then&nbsp;follows the pylorus. The inner lining of the stomach is velvetlike with numerous gastric glands which form groups with net-like interstices. There is a distinct duodenal loop which contains&nbsp;the pancreas. The more convoluted mid gut is lined with net-like&nbsp;meshes which farther back assume a longitudinal zigzag arrangement; .towards the end gut the walls become quite smooth,&nbsp;but in the end gut the walls again show a very narrow-meshed&nbsp;structure. None of these folds of the mid and hind gut is said&nbsp;to contain digestive glands; they seem to be entirely absorbent.&nbsp;The oesophagus of most tortoises shows longitudinal folds with&nbsp;very numerous mucous glands. In the Chelonidac the pharynx&nbsp;and adjoining part of the gullet are covered with little tubercles&nbsp;upon each of which opçns a small gland. Farther down they&nbsp;give way to large, more or less conical papillae, which assume a&nbsp;considerable size, point backwards, and are covered with a&nbsp;somewhat homy epithelium. SimiUr conical, homy papillae&nbsp;exist also in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis,</span><span class="font0"> in which the oesophagus, moreover, makes&nbsp;a long loop half round the stomach before passing into it, an&nbsp;absolutely unique feature. The transition into the stomach&nbsp;is quite gradual. The latter is strongly muscular, partly&nbsp;transversely placed, and possesses often a very distinct pyloric&nbsp;stomach. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone</span><span class="font0"> conical papillae extend into the cardiac&nbsp;portion. In the majority of tortoises the inner lining shows&nbsp;longitudinal folds with numerous small glands, mucous and&nbsp;gastric, but their distribution differs much in the various&nbsp;families and even genera. The Iming of the mid gut shows&nbsp;either longitudinal folds or a network, without glands, except&nbsp;in some cases, Lieberkühn crypts, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx,</span><span class="font0"> not in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone.</span><span class="font0"> The hind gut begins suddenly, but there is no&nbsp;caecum; its inner walls contain numerous glands in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo,&nbsp;Emys,</span><span class="font0"> not in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelys, Trionyx, Cinosternum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the snakes the oesophagus is very thin-walled and passes imperceptibly into the stomach, which continues in a longitudinal&nbsp;direction, scarcely wider in the middle. Its muscular coating&nbsp;is surprisingly weak. There is a small pyloric portion. Mucous&nbsp;and especially long-bodied gastric glands are numerous. The&nbsp;wall of the mid gut carries numerous papillae variably arranged,&nbsp;velvet-like, or densely crowded little blades supported by&nbsp;longitudinal or by meshy folds. The hind gut is short, often&nbsp;constricted into several successive chambers, mostly smooth&nbsp;inside; there is a short, rather wide caecum which seems best&nbsp;developed in Viperidae; sometimes absent. The total length&nbsp;of the snakes’ gut is always short, there being only short folds&nbsp;possible or necessary in the body cavity, which itself is of extraordinary length. Yet, while in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typldops</span><span class="font0"> the gut is almost&nbsp;straight, it forms numerous convolutions in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tortrix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whilst in all other reptiles the gut, at least stomach, liver and mid gut, are suspended by the mesentery from the vertebral&nbsp;column and hang free into the body cavity, in some snakes,&nbsp;especially often described in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Boa</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Python,</span><span class="font0"> the body cavity&nbsp;is cut up into numerous spaces, by peritoneal folds which connect&nbsp;neighbouring twists of the canal into bundles and attach them&nbsp;to the ventral surface of the body-wall. Probably the gut is&nbsp;thereby secured against dislocations in adaptation to the&nbsp;peculiar twisting contortions of the body, especially in the act&nbsp;of climbing. The mesentery of reptiles is remarkable for the&nbsp;possession of smooth, non-striated, muscular fibres. In most&nbsp;lizards, not in other orders, the peritoneum so far as it covers&nbsp;the abdominal cavity shows a deep black pigmentation; this&nbsp;pigment is situated in the connective tissue, not in the epithelial&nbsp;layer; it stops suddenly towards the thorax. In some lizards,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis,</span><span class="font0"> thc black pigment extends, more or less scattered,&nbsp;upon the mesentery and thence upon the intestines. The same&nbsp;pigment colours the pharynx with its recesses entirely black in&nbsp;many lizards. There is no compensating correlation between&nbsp;this internal pigment and that in the outer skin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Liver</span><span class="font0"> of lizards is more or less bilobed; more so in crocodiles; while in tortoises the broad right and left lobes are&nbsp;connected by a narrow isthmus. In the snakes it is much&nbsp;elongated and extends from the heart backwards along the right&nbsp;side of the oesophagus, closely connected in its long course&nbsp;with numerous short branches into, or from, the inferior vena&nbsp;cava and thc portal vein. A gall bladder is always present.&nbsp;The ducts into and from the cyst sometimes form a complicated&nbsp;network, for instance in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Varanus</span><span class="font0"> (F. E. Beddard); the bile is&nbsp;carried by one or more ducts into the duodenal portion of the&nbsp;mid gut. The microscopic structure of the reptilian liver has&nbsp;been compared with that of monotremes by M. Fürbringer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pancreas</span><span class="font0"> is a compact body attached to the duodenal region, which surrounds it by a loop ri the crocodiles, as is the&nbsp;case in birds and mammals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cloaca</span><span class="font0"> of the reptiles shows a great advance upon the simple batrachian arrangement. ■ It is no longer one common&nbsp;chamber, but consists of three successive chambers with the&nbsp;further tendency of separating the temporary retention and the&nbsp;passage of the faecal, urinary and genital products from each&nbsp;other. The arrangement is simplest and most typical in the&nbsp;lizards. There is first the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proclodaeum</span><span class="font0"> or vestibulum of the&nbsp;cloaca, epiblastic in origin. ' Its outer boundary is formed by&nbsp;the cloacal lips, covered so far by the usual scaly integument.&nbsp;Just within this chamber arise the paired copulatory organs,&nbsp;and, when they are present, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphcnodon</span><span class="font0"> and snakes, the&nbsp;two anal glands. Secondly, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">urodaeum,</span><span class="font0"> middle or urino-genital chamber, hypoblastic in origin. It is separated from&nbsp;the proctodaeum by a more or less circular fold which is provided with sphincter muscles, which form the true vent, and&nbsp;this is always round; whilst the outermost opening in lizards&nbsp;and snakes is a transverse slit. Farther inwards, headwards,&nbsp;the urodaeum is shut off by another circular fold, generally very&nbsp;well marked, especially in its dorsal half, which is higher and&nbsp;. thicker. Into the dorsal, and innermost, recess of this urodaeum&nbsp;open the genital and urinary ducts; on the ventral side arises&nbsp;the urinary bladder. The whole chamber is always empty,&nbsp;being only a passage room, and in the female the copulatory&nbsp;chamber. The urine is of course collected in the bladder;&nbsp;when this is absent the fluid is pressed into the third chamber,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coprodaeum,</span><span class="font0"> which is often subdivided into two, or even&nbsp;three, successive rooms by circular folds. This coprodaeum&nbsp;serves for the temporary storage of the faeces, eventually mixed&nbsp;with the urine. Micturition and defaecation are in most&nbsp;lizards two successive separate acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The snake’s arrangement is a side-departure of that prevailing in lizards. The urodaeum is transformed into a dorsal recess&nbsp;into which open above the oviducts, while the ureters open&nbsp;below, in the caudal comer. A horizontal fold imperfectly&nbsp;shuts off the wide urino-genital chamber or recess from the&nbsp;ventral half of the original urodaeum. The coprodaeum is&nbsp;marked above and below by strong sphincters. There is no&nbsp;urinary bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In crocodiles the protodaeum is rather shallow, but long; from its ventral wall arises the unpaired copulatory organ,&nbsp;the basal investing membranes of which continue into the ventral</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
