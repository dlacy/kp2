They returned two answers to Scaliger, dated in the year of the Hejira 998. These were preserved in the French king’s library, translated into Latin by Father Morin, and printed in England in the collection of that father’s letters, in 1682, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Antiquitates Ecclesiæ Orientalis.</hi></p><p>There are still some Samaritans at Shechem, which is otherwise called Naplous ; and they have priests there, who say they are of the family of Aaron. They have a high priest, who resides at Shechem, or at Gerizim, who offers sacrifices there, and who declares the feast of the passover, and all the other feasts, to all the dispersed Samaritans. Some of them are to be found at Gaza, others at Damascus, and others at Grand Cairo.</p><p>SAMAVAT, a town of the Syrian desert, to the west of the Euphrates, once a considerable city, but now only containing 300 Arabs, who levy exorbitant contributions on all pilgrims who take this route to the holy city. It is ninety miles west of Meshed Ali.</p><p>SAMBACCA, a town of the island of Sicily, in the province of Mazzara, and fifty miles from Palermo. It is in a healthy situation on a hill, eight miles from the sea-shore, and contains 9600 inhabitants.</p><p>SAMBAH, a town of Hindustan, in the Sikh territories, and province of Lahore, situated on the eastern side of the small river Deeg, fifty-five miles north-north-east from the city of Lahore. Long. 74. 8. E. Lat. 32. 34. N.</p><p>SAMBAR <hi rend="smallcaps">Point,</hi> the south-west point of the large island of Borneo.</p><p>SAMBASS, a town and river on the west coast of the island of Borneo. The town is about forty miles up the river. It is built, as the seaport towns in Borneo generally are, of timber and bamboos, and is raised on wooden stalks and piles, on low swampy morasses. The river is wide at its entrance, which is in long. 109. 5. E. and lat. 1. 12. N. The inhabitants here, as in other towns on the coast, were much addicted to piracy. They were in the practice of darting out on defenceless vessels, so that it became quite unsafe for the European trader to venture near so dangerous a coast. It was on account of these piracies that the place was attacked by the British in 1812, who were repulsed with loss, and suffered still more severely from the pestilential effects of the climate. In 1813, a second attack was made by a British armament, which proved completely successful.</p><p>SAMBAYA, a river on the north coast of the island of Java, which is navigable in the rainy season as far as the residence of the Emperor of Solo ; and a recent survey, made by Captain Colebrooke, shows that the impediments to its further navigation might be easily removed.</p><p>SAMBELONG <hi rend="smallcaps">Islands</hi>, two or three islands among the Nicobar Islands, a little to the north of the Great Nicobar. Long. 100. 36. E. Lat. 41. 20. N.</p><p>SAMBER, a Rajpoot town of Hindustan, in the province of Ajmeer, and district of Jyepoor.

Long. 109. 50. E. Lat. 2. 52. S.</p><p>SAMBOANGAN, a Spanish fortress and settlement on the south-west extremity of the island of Magindanao. The town is situated on the banks of a small rivulet which flows into the sea, and contains a thousand inhabitants, including officers, soldiers, and their respective families. Here are erected, on posts twelve feet high, small look-out houses, in</p><p>all of which a constant guard is kept by the Spaniards, against the inroads of the natives, with whom they are in a state of perpetual hostility. The military force consists of 150 to 200 soldiers, natives of Manilla, who have no discipline. To this place criminals are sent into banishment from the Philippines. The adjacent country is extremely fertile, and cattle have multiplied everywhere in the woods. Pirates swarm in the neighbourhood, and frequently plunder and cut off vessels richly laden, while lying in the harbour. They frequently make descents close to the fort, and carry off the inhabitants, whom they sell into slavery. Long. 122. 10. E. Lat. 6. 45. N.</p><p>SAMBOR, a circle of the Austrian kingdom of Gallicia, extending over 2050 square miles, comprising ten cities and towns, and 352 villages, with 250,700 inhabitants, about one fifth of whom are Jews.

(Consult Athenaeus, 1. 4 and 1. 14.)</p><p>SAMGAUM, a town of Hindustan, in the province of the Carnatic, and district of Nelloor, situated on the north bank of the Pennar river. Long. 70. 44. E. Lat. 14. 33. N.</p><p>SAMMAN, a town in the interior of Lasha, in Arabia, fifty miles west-north-west of El Katif.</p><p>SAMOGITIA, a province of Poland, bounded on the north by Courland, on the east by Lithuania, on the west by the Baltic Sea, and on the south by Regal Prussia, being a hundred and seventy-five miles in length and a hundred and twenty-five in breadth.</p><p>SAMOIEDA, a country of the Russian empire, between Asiatic Tartary and Archangel, lying along the sea-coast as far as Siberia.

The tides run very strong, and occasion ripplings, which have the appearance of breakers.</p><p>SAMOS, a Greek island on the shore of Asia Minor, from which it is separated by a very narrow and crooked channel called the Little Boghaz, near to which are the ruins of Ephesus and the celebrated Cape Mycale. It is celebrated as the birthplace of Pythagoras, and was the most powerful and important of the Ionian Islands, distinguished by the number and skill of its seamen, who, 566 years before the Christian era, navigated the Mediterranean to the pillars of Hercules, and are said to have ascended the river Guadalquivir in Spain. Some degree of independence was maintained until the reign of the Emperor Vespasian, about the year 70. Up to that time it had been celebrated for being a great school of statuary, and for preparing bronze images, in which art Rhoekos, and his two sons Theodoros and Telekles, were distinguished masters. In the middle ages the island was successively governed by Arabs, Venetians, Genoese, and Turks, and continued a portion of the empire of the latter till the recent Grecian revolution broke out. The islanders on that occasion took part with their countrymen as soon as the news reached them of the execution of their patriarch. Fortifications were erected towards the channel of the Boghaz, which rendered an invasion from the continent of Anatolia too hazardous for</p></body></text></TEI>
