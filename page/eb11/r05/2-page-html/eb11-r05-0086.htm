<p><span class="font0">Nicholas. A few days later two secret envoys arrived at Bucharest, the one M. de Nelidov, to negotiate on the part of&nbsp;the Russian government for the passage of their army through&nbsp;Rumania, the other Ali Bey, to arrange on behalf of the sultan&nbsp;a combination with Rumania against Russia. Prince Charles&nbsp;cleverly temporized with both powers. Negotiations with&nbsp;Russia were continued, and Bratianu was sent to Constantinople&nbsp;to put pressure upon Turkey to secure certain rights and&nbsp;privileges which would practically have made Rumania independent, except that it would still have paid a fixed tribute;&nbsp;but the conference of the powers assembled at that capital came&nbsp;to a definite end on the 19th of January 1877, when the Turkish&nbsp;government declined every proposal of the conference. Meanwhile the Porte, in issuing Midhat Pasha’s famous scheme of&nbsp;reforms, had greatly irritated Rumanian politicians by including their country in the same category as the other privileged&nbsp;provinces, and designating its inhabitants as Ottoman subjects.&nbsp;A secret convention was signed between Russia and Rumania&nbsp;on the 16th of April, by which Rumania allowed free passage&nbsp;to the Russian armies, the tsar engaging in return to maintain&nbsp;its political rights and to protect its integrity, while all matters&nbsp;of detail connected with the passage of the Russian troops were&nbsp;to be regulated by a special treaty. On the 23rd of April&nbsp;Russia declared war against Turkey, and the grand duke Nicholas&nbsp;issued a proclamation to the Rumanian nation, announcing&nbsp;his intention of entering their territory in the hope of finding&nbsp;the same welcome as in former wars. The Rumanian government made a platonic protest against the crossing of the frontier,&nbsp;and the Rumanian troops fell back as the Russians advanced;&nbsp;provisions and stores of all kinds were supplied to the invading&nbsp;army against cash payments in gold, and the railways and&nbsp;telegraphs were freely placed at its disposal. The Rumanian&nbsp;chambers were assembled on the 26th of April, and the convention with Russia was sanctioned. The Ottoman government immediately broke off diplomatic relations with Rumania,&nbsp;and on the nth of May the chambers passed a resolution that&nbsp;a state of war existed with Turkey. (For a detailed account of&nbsp;the subsequent campaign, in which Prince Charles and the&nbsp;Rumanian army contributed greatly to the success of the&nbsp;Russian arms, see Russo-Turkish Wars, and Plevna.) The&nbsp;fall of Plevna left the Russian army free to march on Constantinople, and on the 31st of January 1878 the preliminaries of&nbsp;peace were signed at Adrianople. They stipulated that&nbsp;Rumania should be independent and receive an increase of&nbsp;territory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Peace between Russia and Turkey was signed at San Stefano on the 3rd of March. On the 29th of January the Rumanian&nbsp;agent at St Petersburg was officially informed of the&nbsp;intention of the Russian government to regain possession of the Rumanian portion of Bessarabia, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> that&nbsp;portion which was ceded to Moldavia by Russia after&nbsp;the Crimean War. Rumania was to be indemnified at&nbsp;the expense of Turkey by the delta of the Danube and&nbsp;the Dobrudja as far as Constantza. The motive assigned was&nbsp;that this territory had not been ceded to Rumania, but to&nbsp;Moldavia, and had been separated from Russia by the almost&nbsp;obsolete treaty of Paris (1856). But the proposed exchange&nbsp;of territory aroused the most bitter indignation at Bucharest.&nbsp;Bratianu and Cogalniceanu were sent to Berlin to endeavour&nbsp;to prevail on the representatives of the Powers there assembled&nbsp;in June 1878 to veto the cession of Bessarabia to Russia; but&nbsp;the Rumanian delegates were not permitted to attend the&nbsp;sittings of the congress until the Powers had decided in favour&nbsp;of the Russian claim. The treaty of Berlin in dealing with&nbsp;Rumania decided to recognize its independence, subject to two&nbsp;conditions: First (Art. xlv.), that the principality should&nbsp;restore to the emperor of Russia that portion of the Bessarabian&nbsp;territory detached from Russia by the treaty of Paris in 1856,&nbsp;bounded on the west by the mid-channel of the Pruth, and on&nbsp;the south by the mid-channel of the Kilia branch and the&nbsp;Staryi Stambul mouth. Second (Art. xliv.), that absolute&nbsp;freedom of worship should be granted to all persons in Rumania;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">that no religious beliefs should be a bar to the enjoyment of any political rights; and, further, that the subjects of all the&nbsp;powers should be treated in Rumania on a footing of perfect&nbsp;equality. Article xlvi. declared that the islands forming the&nbsp;delta of the Danube, the Isle of Serpents, and the province of&nbsp;Dobrudja, as far as a line starting from the east of Silistria and&nbsp;terminating on the Black Sea south of Mangalia, should be added&nbsp;to Rumania. Other articles defined the international position of&nbsp;Rumania, while Article liii. decreed that it should have a representative on the European commission of the Danube. Bratianu&nbsp;wrote with some truth that the Great Powers by sacrificing&nbsp;Rumania were able to obtain more concessions for themselves&nbsp;from Russia, and Lord Beaconsfield was constrained to&nbsp;admit that “ in politics ingratitude is often the reward of&nbsp;the greatest services. ” The Rumanians submitted reluctantly&nbsp;to the retrocession of Bessarabia; and the Dobrudja was&nbsp;occupied by Rumanian troops on the 26th of November&nbsp;1878.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But Article xliv. of the treaty of Berlin caused tremendous agitation throughout the country, and almost provoked a&nbsp;revolution. Article vii. of the constitution of 1866 laid&nbsp;down that “ only Christians can become citizens of&nbsp;Rumania ”—in other words, all Jews were excluded&nbsp;from the rights of citizenship; and as no foreigner could own&nbsp;land in Rumania outside the towns, no Jew could become a&nbsp;country proprietor. Public opinion in Rumania rendered it&nbsp;almost impossible for any government to carry out the wishes&nbsp;of the Berlin tribunal. To do so involved a change in the&nbsp;constitution, which could only be effected by a specially elected&nbsp;constituent assembly. This body met on the 3rd of June,&nbsp;and sat through the entire summer. The irritation of the&nbsp;powers at the unexpected delay was so great that Great Britain&nbsp;proposed a collective note on the subject, to be executed by&nbsp;the Austrian cabinet; while Prince Bismarck threatened,&nbsp;if the Berlin proposition were not carried out, to refer to the&nbsp;suzerain power at Constantinople. At last, however, on the&nbsp;18th of October, Article vii. was repealed, and it thus became&nbsp;possible for Rumanian Jews to become naturalized and to hold&nbsp;land. It was further decided to admit to naturalization the 883&nbsp;Jewish soldiers who had served in the war; but with all other&nbsp;Jews individual naturalization was required, and this was&nbsp;hedged about by so many difficulties, a special vote of the legislature being required, with a two-thirds majority in each&nbsp;individual case, that although the compromise thus effected&nbsp;was accepted by the powers, the actual result was that, from&nbsp;1880 to 1884, out of 385 persons who were naturalized in&nbsp;Rumania, only 71 were Rumanian Jews. As the process of&nbsp;naturalization has never been accelerated, the 300,000 Jews&nbsp;said to inhabit Rumania are still regarded as foreigners; and&nbsp;although liable to military service and to the payment of taxes,&nbsp;are unable to own rural land or possess electoral or other civil&nbsp;rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Italy was the first of the Powers to notify its recognition of Rumanian independence (December 1879); but Bismarck&nbsp;succeeded in prevailing on the Western Powers not&nbsp;to give official recognition until Rumania should have&nbsp;purchased the railways from their German owners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This unpopular measure caused some delay; but Great Britain, France and Germany formally recognized&nbsp;the independence of the country on the 20th of February 1880.&nbsp;Early in 1881 it was generally felt that the time had arrived&nbsp;for Rumania to be created a kingdom. On the 13th of March&nbsp;the tsar Alexander II. was assassinated, and the Rumanian&nbsp;opposition chose this occasion to accuse the Liberal government&nbsp;of aiming at republican and anti-dynastic ideals. To refute&nbsp;this charge, the ministry proposed the elevation of the Rumanian&nbsp;principality into the kingdom of Rumania. The prince accepted&nbsp;the resolution; within ten days the new kingdom was recognized by all the Great Powers, and the coronation took place&nbsp;at Bucharest on the 22nd of May 1881. The royal crown was&nbsp;constructed of steel made from Turkish cannon captured at&nbsp;Plevna.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
