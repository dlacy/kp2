              <p>               <label>RAS-SEM</label>, a city of Tripoli in Barbary, concerning which a number
                    of fables were told by the Tripoline ambaſſador, all of which were believed in
                    England and other parts of Europe in the beginning of this century. (See <hi
                        rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Petrified-City). </hi></hi> Mr Bruce
                    informs us, that it is ſituated about five days journey ſouth from Bengazi;-but
                    has no water excepting one fountain, which has a diſagreeable taſte, and ſeems
                    to be impregnated with -alum. Hence it has obtained the name of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Ras-Sem,</hi> or the fountain of poiſon. The only remains of
                    antiquity in this place conſiſt of the ruins of a tower or fortification, which,
                    in the opinion of Mr Bruce, is as late as the time of the vandals ; but he ſays
                    he cannot imagine what ufe they made of the water, and they had no other within
                    two days journey of the place.— Here our traveller ſaw many of the animals
                    called <hi rend="italic">jerboa,</hi> a kind of mice ; which, he fays, ſeem to
                    partake as much of the nature oſ a bird as of a quadruped.</p>            </div>
