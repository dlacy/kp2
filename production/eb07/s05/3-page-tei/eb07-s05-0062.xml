Of this kind Borlase thinks the great <hi rend="italic">Quoit</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Karn-lehau,</hi> in the parish of Ty widnek, to be. It is thirty-nine feet in circumference, and four feet thick at a medium, and stands on a single pedestal. There is also a remarkable stone of the same kind in the island of St Agnes in Scilly. The under rock is ten feet six inches high, forty-seven feet round the middle, and touches the ground with no more than half its base. The upper rock rests on one point only, and is so nicely balanced that two or three men with a pole can move it. It is eight feet six inches high, and forty-seven in circumference. On the top there is a basin hollowed out, three feet eleven inches in diameter at a medium, but wider at the brim, and three feet deep. From the globular shape of this upper stone, it is highly probable that it was rounded by human art, and perhaps even placed on its pedestal by human strength. In Sithney parish, near Helston, in Cornwall, stood the famous logan or rocking stone, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Men Amber,</hi> q. d. <hi rend="italic">Men an Bar,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">top-slone.</hi> It was eleven feet by six, and four high, and so nicely poised on another stone that a little child could move it, and all travellers who came this way desired to see it. But Shrubsall, Cromwell’s governor of Pendennis, with much ado caused it to be undermined, to the great grief of the country. There are some marks of the tool on it, and, from its quadrangular shape, it was probably dedicated to Mercury.</p><p>That the rocking stones are monuments erected by the Druids, has by some writers been taken for granted ; but tradition has not informed us for what purpose they were intended. Mr Toland thinks that the Druids made the people believe that they alone could move them, and that by a miracle ; and that by this pretended miracle they condemned or acquitted the accused, and brought criminals to confess what could not otherwise be extorted from them. How far this conjecture is right, we shall leave to those who are deeply versed in the knowledge of antiquities to determine.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sonorous </hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Stone,</hi> a kind of stone remarkable for emitting an agreeable sound when struck, and much used in China for making musical instruments w<hi rend="superscript">r</hi>hich they call <hi rend="italic">king. </hi>The various kinds of sonorous stones known in China differ considerably from one another in beauty, and in the strength and duration of their tone ; and what is very surprising is, that this difference cannot be discovered either by the different degrees of their hardness, weight, or fineness of grain, or by any other qualities which might be supposed to determine it. Some stones are found remarkably hard, which are very sonorous ; and others exceedingly soft, which have an excellent tone ; some extremely heavy emit a very sweet sound ; and there are others as light as pumice-stone which have also an agreeable sound.</p><p>STONEHENGE, a celebrated monument of antiquity, stands in the middle of a flat area near the summit of a hill six miles distant from Salisbury. It is enclosed by a circular double bank and ditch near thirty feet broad, after crossing which we ascend thirty yards before we reach the work. The whole fabric consisted of two circles and two ovals. The outer circle is about 108 feet in diameter, consisting, when entire, of sixty stones, thirty uprights and thirty imposts, of which remain only twenty-four uprights, seventeen standing and seven down, three and a half feet asunder, and eight imposts. Eleven uprights have their five imposts on them by the grand entrance. These stones are from thirteen to twenty feet high. The smaller circle is somewhat more than eight feet from the inside of the outer one, and consisted of forty smaller stones (the highest six feet), of which only nineteen remain, and only eleven standing: the walk between these two circles is 300 feet in circumference. The adytum or cell is an oval formed of ten stones (from sixteen to twenty-two feet high), in pairs, with imposts, which Dr Stukeley calls <hi rend="italic">trilithons,</hi> and above thirty feet high, rising in height as they go round, and each pair separate, and not connected as the outer pair ; the highest eight feet. Within these are nineteen smaller single stones, of which only six are standing. At the upper end of the adytum is the altar, a large slab of blue coarse marble, twenty inches thick, sixteen feet long, and four broad ; pressed down by the weight of the vast stones that have fallen upon it. The whole number of stones, uprights, imposts, and altar, is exactly 140. The stones are far from being artificial, but were most probably brought from those called the <hi rend="italic">Gray Weathers,</hi> on Marlborough Downs, fifteen or sixteen miles off; and if tried with a tool, they appear of the same hardness, grain, and colour, generally reddish. The heads of oxen, deer, and other beasts, have been found on digging in and about Stonehenge ; and human bones in the circumjacent barrows. There are three entrances from the plain to this structure, the most considerable of which is from the north-east, and at each of them were raised on the outside of the trench two huge stones, with two smaller within, parallel to them.</p><p>It has been long a dispute among the learned, by what nation and for what purpose these enormous stones were collected and arranged. The first account of this structure we meet with is in Geoffrey of Monmouth, who, in the reign of King Stephen, wrote the history of the Britons in Latin. He tells us that it was erected by the counsel of Merlin the British enchanter, at the command of Aurelius Ambrosius, the last British king, in memory of 460 Britons who were murdered by Hengist the Saxon. The next account is that of Polydore Virgil, who says that the Britons erected this as a sepulchral monument of Aurelius Ambrosius. Others suppose it to have been a sepulchral monument of Boadicea, the famous British queen. Inigo Jones is of opinion that it was a Roman temple; from a stone sixteen feet long and four broad, placed in an exact position to the eastward, altar-fashion. Dr Charlton attributed it to the Danes, who were two years masters of Wiltshire. A tin tablet, on which were some unknown characters, supposed to be Punic, was digged up near it in the reign of Henry VIII., but is lost ; probably that might have given some information respecting its founders. Its common name, <hi rend="italic">Stonehenge,</hi> is Saxon, and signifies a “ stone gallows,” to which these stones, having transverse imposts, bear some resemblance. It is also called in Welch <hi rend="italic">choir gour,</hi> or “ the giants’ dance.”</p><p>Mr Grose thinks that Dr Stukeley has completely proved this structure to have been a British temple, in which the Druids officiated. He supposes it to have been the metropolitan temple of Great Britain, and translates the words <hi rend="italic">choir gour “</hi> the great choir or temple.” The learned Mr Bryant is of opinion that it was erected by a colony of Cuthites, probably before the time of the Druids ; because it was usual with them to place one vast stone upon another for a religious memorial ; and these they often placed so equably, that even a breath of wind would sometimes make them vibrate. Of such stones one remains at this day in the pile of Stonehenge. The ancients distinguished stones erected with a religious view by the name of <hi rend="italic">amber;</hi> by which was signified any thing solar and divine. The Grecians called them <hi rend="italic">πετϑαι αμϐϑοσιαι</hi>, <hi rend="italic">petrœ ambrosia.</hi> Stonehenge, according to Mr Bryant, is composed of these amber Stones : hence the next town is denominated <hi rend="italic">Ambresbury ; </hi>not from a Roman Ambrosius, for no such person ever existed, but from the <hi rend="italic">Ambrosia petrœ,</hi> in whose vicinity it stood. Some of them were rocking stones ; and there was a wonderful monument of this kind near Penzance in Cornwall, which still retains the name of <hi rend="italic">main-amber,</hi> or the sacred stones. Such a one is mentioned by Apollonius Rhodius, supposed to have been raised in the time of the Argonautæ, in the island Tenos, as the monument of the</p></body></text></TEI>
