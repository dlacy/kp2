a city of Spain, in the kingdom of Arragon, with an archbiſhop’s ſee, an univerſity, and a court of inquiſition It is ſaid to have been built by the Phoenicians; and the Romans ſent a colony here in the reign of the emperor Auguſtus, whence it had the name of <hi rend="italic">Caesar Augustus,</hi> which by corruption has been changed into Saragoſſa. It is a large, handſome, and well-built town. The ſtreets are long, broad, well-paved, and very clean, and the houſes from three to ſix ſtories high. It is adorned with many magnificent buildings; and they reckon 17 large churches, and 14 handſome monaſteries, not to mention others leſs conſiderable. The river Ebro runs croſs the place, dividing it into two; and on its banks is a handſome quay, which ſerves for a public walk. The Holy-ſtreet is the largeſt, and ſo broad that it may be taken for a ſquare; and here they have their bull-fights: in this ſtreet there are ſeveral noblemens families, particularly that of the viceroy. The convents are handſome and richly adorned, as well as the churches. The cathedral church is a ſpacious building, after the Gothic taſte; but the fineſt church is that of Nueſtra Signora del Pilar, ſeated on the ſide of the Ebro, and is a place of the greateſt devotion in Spain. They tell us the Virgin appeared to St James, who was preaching the goſpel, and left him her image, with a handſome pillar of jaſper: it is ſtill in this church which they pretend is the firſt in the world built to her honour. This image ſtands on a marble pillar, with a little Jeſus in her arms; but the place is ſo dark, that it cannot be ſeen without the aſſiſtance of</p><p>lamps, which are 50 in number, and all of ſilver. There are alſo chandeliers and baluſtrades of maſſy ſilver. The ornaments of this image are the richeſt that can be imagined, her crown being full of precious ſtones of an ineſtimable price; in ſhort, there is ſcarce any thing to be ſeen but gold and jewels, and a vaſt number of people come in pilgrimage hither. The town-houſe is a ſumptuous ſtructure, adorned with fine columns: in the hall are the pictures of all the kings of Arragon; and in a corner of it St George on horſeback, with a dragon of white marble under him. It is ſeated in a very large plain, where the Ebro receives two other rivers; and over it are two bridges, one of ſtone and the other of wood, which laſt has been thought the moſt beautiful in Europe. A victory was obtained here over the French and Spaniards in 1710, but it was abandoned by the allies ſoon after. It is 97 miles well by north of Tarragona, 137 weſt of Barcelona, and 150 north-eaſt of Madrid. W. Long. 0. 48. N. Lat. 41. 47.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
