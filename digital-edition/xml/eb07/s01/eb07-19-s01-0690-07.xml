a city, the capital of the grand duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, in Germany. It is finely situated, part being on the side of the lake of Schwerin, and part on an island on that lake, the two parts being connected by bridges. It contains the palace of the grand duke, with gardens, which exhibit more taste than the residence. It is fortified, but very imperfectly. It contains one Catholic and three Lutheran churches, the various appendages of a capital for a small state, 1100 houses, and 12,880 inhabitants, who have various manufactures adequate to the domestic consumption. Long. 11. 26. E. Lat. 54. 43. N.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
