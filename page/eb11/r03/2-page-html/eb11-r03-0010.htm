<p><span class="font0">perfect and sincere observance of religion for upwards of thirty-years. In 1400 Richard was in the infirmary of the abbey, where he died in the following year. His only known extant&nbsp;work is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum Historiale de Gestis Regum Angliae, 447-1066.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The MS. of this is in the university library at Cambridge, and&nbsp;has been edited for the Rolls Series (No. 30) by Professor&nbsp;J. E. B. Mayor (2 vols., London, 1863-69). It is in four books,&nbsp;and at the conclusion of the fourth book Richard expresses&nbsp;his intention of continuing his narrative from the accession of&nbsp;William I., and incorporating a sketch of the Conqueror’s career&nbsp;from his birth. This design he does not, however, appear to&nbsp;have carried into effect. The value of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Spectdum</span><span class="font0"> as a contribution to our historical knowledge is but slight, for it is&nbsp;mainly a compilation from other writers; while even in transscribing these the compiler is guilty of great carelessness. He&nbsp;gives, however, numerous charters relating to Westminster&nbsp;Abbey, and also a very complete account of the saints whose&nbsp;tombs were in the abbey church, and especially of Edward the&nbsp;Confessor. The work was, however, largely used by historians&nbsp;and antiquaries, until, with the rise of a more critical spirit,&nbsp;its value became more accurately estimated. Besides the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum</span><span class="font0"> Richard also wrote, according to the statement of William&nbsp;of Woodford in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Answer</span><span class="font0"> to Wycliffe (Edward Brown, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fasciculus&nbsp;Rerum expetendarum,</span><span class="font0"> p. 193), a treatise </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Officiis',</span><span class="font0"> and there&nbsp;was formerly in the cathedral library at Peterborough&nbsp;another tractate from his pen, entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Super Symbolum.</span><span class="font0"> Of&nbsp;neither of these works, however, does any known copy now&nbsp;exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum</span><span class="font0"> affords the most conclusive proof of the spuriousness of another work attributed to Richard and long accepted by the learned world as his. This was the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Situ Britanniae</span><span class="font0"> an&nbsp;elaborate forgery relating to the antiquities of Roman Britain,&nbsp;which first appeared at Copenhagen in the year 1747. It was&nbsp;printed with the works of Gildas and Nennius, under the editorship&nbsp;of Charles Julius Bertram, professor of English in the academy of&nbsp;Copenhagen in the middle of the 18th century, with the following&nbsp;special title: “ Richardi Corinensis monachi Westmonasteriensis&nbsp;de situ Britanniae Hbri duo. E. Codici MS. descripsit, Notisque&nbsp;et Indice adornavit Carolus Bertram.&quot;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This forgery was accepted as genuine by a well-known antiquary of the 18th century, Dr William Stukeley, and under the sanction&nbsp;of his authority continued for a long time to be regarded in the&nbsp;same light by numerous scholars and antiquaries, including Gibbon&nbsp;and Lingard. On the other hand, critics of a later date gave&nbsp;expression, on various grounds, to a contrary conclusion. All doubt&nbsp;on the subject may, however, be held to have been effectually set&nbsp;at rest by the masterly exposure of the whole fraud drawn up by&nbsp;Professor Mayor in the preface to the edition above referred to of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum.</span><span class="font0"> He has there not only demonstrated, from the&nbsp;external and internal evidence alike, the spuriousness of the whole&nbsp;treatise, but in a collation (extending to nearly a hundred pages)&nbsp;of numerous passages with corresponding passages in classical&nbsp;medieval authorities, has also traced out the various sources whence&nbsp;Bertram derived the terminology and the facts which he reproduced&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Situ.</span><span class="font0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. B. M.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHARD OF DRVIZES (fl. 1191), English chronicler, was a monk of St Swithin’s house at Winchester. His birthplace&nbsp;is probably indicated by his surname, but of his life we know&nbsp;nothing. He is credited by Bale with the composition of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Annales de Wintonia</span><span class="font0"> which are edited by Luard in the second&nbsp;volume of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Annales Monastici.</span><span class="font0"> If this statement be correct,&nbsp;then the chronicler survived King Richard I. But the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicon&nbsp;de rebus geslis Ricardi Primi</span><span class="font0"> by which Richard of Devizes is&nbsp;chiefly known, only covers the first three years of that king’s&nbsp;reign; it is practically an account of events in England and&nbsp;the Holy Land during the Third Crusade. For the events of&nbsp;the crusade itself, Richard is a poor authority. But his account&nbsp;of the preparations for the crusade, and of English affairs in the&nbsp;king’s absence, is valuable, in spite of some inaccuracies. The&nbsp;author is intensely conservative, steeped in the prejudices of&nbsp;his order, and particularly hostile to the Jews and to the&nbsp;chancellor, William Longchamp. He-writes in a vivid and&nbsp;epigrammatic style; his Latin shows the effect of the 12th-century renaissance in its polish and in its reminiscences of&nbsp;classical poets.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RICHARD OF HEXHAM (fl. 1141), English chronicler, became prior of Hexham about 1141, and died between 1163 and 1178.&nbsp;He wrote </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Brevis Annotatio</span><span class="font0"> a short history of the church of&nbsp;Hexham from 674 to 1138, for which he borrowed from Bede,&nbsp;Eddius and Simeon of Durham. This is published by J. Raine&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Priory of Hexham its Chroniclers, Endowments and Annals&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(Durham, 1864-65). More important is his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hisloria de gestis&nbsp;regis Slephani et de bello Standardii,</span><span class="font0"> very valuable for the history&nbsp;of the north of England during the earlier part of the reign of&nbsp;Stephen, and especially for the battle of the Standard. This&nbsp;history, which is a contemporary one, covers the period from&nbsp;the death of Henry I. in 1135 to early in 1139. It lias been&nbsp;edited for the Rolls Series by R. Howlett in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chroniclers of&nbsp;the Reigns of Stephen, Henry II. and Richard I.,</span><span class="font0"> vol. iii.

<p><span class="font0">RICHARD OF ILCHESTER (d. 1188), English statesman and prelate, was born in the diocese of Bath, where he obtained&nbsp;preferment. Early in the reign of Henry II., however, he is&nbsp;found acting as a clerk in the king’s court, probably under&nbsp;Thomas Becket, and he was one of the officials who assisted&nbsp;Henry in carrying out his great judicial and financial reforms. In 1162, or 1163, he was appointed archdeacon of Poitiers, but&nbsp;he passed most of his time in England, although in the next two&nbsp;or three years he visited Pope Alexander III. and the Emperor&nbsp;Frederick I. in the interests of the EngHsh king, who was then&nbsp;engaged in his struggle with Becket. For promising to support&nbsp;Frederick against Alexander he was excommunicated by Becket&nbsp;in 1166. Before this event, however, Richard had been appointed a baron of the exchequer, his great industry and&nbsp;exceptional abilities as an accountant being recognized by&nbsp;giving him a special seat at the exchequer table, and from 1168&nbsp;until his death he frequently acted as one of the itinerant&nbsp;justices. Although totally immersed in secular business he&nbsp;received several rich ecclesiastical offices, and in May 1173 he&nbsp;was elected bishop of Winchester, being consecrated at Canterbury in October 1174. Richard still continued to serve Henry&nbsp;II. In 1176 he was appointed justiciar and seneschal of&nbsp;Normandy, and was given full control of all the royal business&nbsp;in the duchy. He died on the 21st or 22nd of December 1188,&nbsp;and was buried in Winchester cathedral. Richard owes his&nbsp;surname, to the fact that Henry II. granted him a mill at&nbsp;Ilchester; he is also called Richard of Toclyve.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RICHARD OF ST VICTOR (d. 1173), theologian and mystic of the 12th century. Very Httle is known of his life; he was&nbsp;born in Scotland or in England, and went to Paris, where he&nbsp;entered the abbey of St Victor and was a pupil of the great&nbsp;mystic, Hugh of St Victor. He succeeded as prior of this house&nbsp;in 1162, and was continually contesting the tyrannical authority&nbsp;of the abbot Ervisius. His writings, some of which are still&nbsp;in manuscript, are very numerous, the best known being his&nbsp;mystical treatises: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De statu hominis interims, De praeparatione&nbsp;animi ad Contemplationem, De gratia Contemplationis De gradibus&nbsp;Caritatis, De area nuptica,</span><span class="font0"> and his two works on the Trinity:&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De irinitate libri sex. De tribus appropriatis personis in Trinitate.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">As is the case with all the Victorines, his mysticism was a&nbsp;reaction against the philosophy of the schools of his time, a&nbsp;perpetual justification of contemplation as opposed to logical&nbsp;reasoning. According to him, six steps lead the soul to contemplation: (1) contemplation of visible and tangible objects;&nbsp;(2) study of the productions of nature and of art; (3) study of&nbsp;character; (4) study of souls and of spirits; (5) entrance to the&nbsp;mystical region which ends in (6) ecstasy. His theory of the&nbsp;Trinity is chiefly based on the arguments of Anselm of Canterbury, although a certain deification of the social sense is evident.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
