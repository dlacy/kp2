<p><span class="font0">ing the progreſſive motion of an open ſtream, whoſe ſurface is not level, it is quite enough that we ſee that&nbsp;ſuch a motion muſt obtain, and that we ſee that&nbsp;there are propelling forces ; and that thoſe forces&nbsp;ariſe </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſolely</span><span class="font0"> from the want of a level ſurface, or from&nbsp;the ſlope of the ſurſace ; and that, with reſpect to any&nbsp;one particle, the force acting on it is proportional to&nbsp;the difference of level between each of the two columns&nbsp;(one on each ſide of the particle) which produce it.&nbsp;Were the ſurface level, there would be no motion ; if it&nbsp;is not level, there will be motion ; and this motion will&nbsp;be proportional to the want of level or the declivity of&nbsp;the ſurface </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ι</span><span class="font0"> it is of no conſequence whether the bottom be level or not, or what is its ſhape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hence we draw a fundamental principle, that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the motion of rivers depends entirely on the ſlope of the ſur-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f<sup>ace</sup>'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The slope or declivity of any inclined plane is not properly expreſſed by the difference of height alone of&nbsp;its extremities ; we muſt alſo conſider its length : and&nbsp;the meaſure of the ſlope muſt be ſuch that it may be&nbsp;the ſame while the declivity is the ſame. It muſt therefore be the ſame over the whole of any one inclined&nbsp;plane. We ſhall anſwer theſe conditions exactly, if we&nbsp;take for the meaſure of a ſlope the fraction which ex-preſſes the elevation of one extremity above the other</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">divided by the length of the plane. Thus will AF</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">expreſs the declivity of the plane AF.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the water met with no reſiſtance from the bed in which it runs, if it had no adheſion to its ſides and bottom, and if its fluidity were perfect, its gravity would&nbsp;accelerate its courſe continually, and the earth and its&nbsp;inhabitants would be deprived of all the advantages&nbsp;which they derive from its numberleſs ſtreams. They&nbsp;would run off ſo quickly, that our fields, dried up as&nbsp;ſoon as watered, would be barren and uſeleſs. No ſoil&nbsp;could reſiſt the impetuoſity of the torrents ; and their&nbsp;accelerating force would render them a deſtroying&nbsp;ſcourge, were it not that, by kind Providence, the reſiſtance of the bed, and the viſcidity of the fluid, become a check which reins them in and ſets bounds to&nbsp;their rapidity. In this manner the friction on the ſides,&nbsp;which, by the viſcidity of the water, is communicated&nbsp;to the whole maſs, and the very adheſion of the particles to each other, and to the ſides of the channel, are&nbsp;the cauſes which make the reſiſtances bear a relation to&nbsp;the velocity ; ſo that the reſiſtances augmenting with&nbsp;the velocities, come at laſt to balance the accelerating&nbsp;force. Then the velocity now acquired is preſerved,&nbsp;and the motion becomes uniform, without being able&nbsp;to acquire new increaſe, unleſs ſome change ſucceeds&nbsp;either in the ſlope or in the capacity of the channel.&nbsp;Hence ariſes the ſecond maxim in the motion of rivers,&nbsp;that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">when a ſtream moves uniformly, the reſiſtance is equal&nbsp;to the accelerating force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As in the efflux of water through orifices, we pafs over the very beginnings of the accelerated motion, which&nbsp;is a matter of ſpeculative curioſity, and conſider the&nbsp;motion in a ſtate of permanency, depending on the head&nbsp;of water, the area of the orifice, the velocity, and the&nbsp;expence ; ſo, in the theory of the uniform motion of&nbsp;rivers, we conſider the ſlope, the tranſverſe fection or&nbsp;area of the ſtream, the uniform velocity, and the ex</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">pence. It will be convenient to affix preciſe meanings </span><span class="font0">to the terms which we ſhall employ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The section of a ſtream is the area of a plane per* pendicular to the direction of the general motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The reſiſtances ariſe ultimately from the action of the water on the internal ſurſace of the channel, and muſt&nbsp;be proportional </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">( firteris paribus )</span><span class="font0"> to the extent of the&nbsp;action. Therefore if we unfold the whole edge of this&nbsp;ſection, which is rubbed as it were by the paſſing water,&nbsp;we ſhall have a meaſure of the extent of this action. In&nbsp;a pipe, circular or priſmatical, the whole circumference&nbsp;is acted on; but in a river or canal ACDQ (fig. 6.)&nbsp;the horizontal line </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> O </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font0"> which makes the upper boundary of the ie&lt;5tiυn </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> Cl) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font0"> is free from all action. The&nbsp;action is confined to the three lines </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> C, CD, D </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">We ſhall call this line </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> CD </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> the border of the ſection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mean velocity is that with which the whole ſection, moving equally, would generate a ſolid equal&nbsp;to the expence of the ſtream. This velocity is to be&nbsp;found perhaps but in one filament of the ſtream, and&nbsp;we do not know in which filament it is to be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since we are attempting to eſtabliſh an empirical theory of the motion of rivers, founded entirely on experiment and palpable deductions from them ; and ſince&nbsp;it is extremely difficult to make experiments on open&nbsp;ſtreams which ſhall have a preciſion ſufficient for ſuch&nbsp;an important purpoſe—it would be a moil deſirable&nbsp;thing to demonſtrate an exact analogy between the&nbsp;mutual balancing of the acceleration and reſiſtance irι&nbsp;pipes and in rivers ; for in thoſe we can not only make&nbsp;experiments with all the deſired accuracy, and admitting preciſe meaſures, but we can make them in a number of caſes that are almoſt impracticable in rivers. We&nbsp;can increaſe the ſlope of a pipe from nothing to the&nbsp;vertical poſition, and we can employ every deſired degree of preſſure, ſo as to aſcertain its effect on the velocity in degrees which open ſtreams will not admit.&nbsp;The Chevalier de Buat has moſt happily ſucceeded in&nbsp;this demonſtration;-and it is here that his good fortune&nbsp;and his penetration have done ſo much ſervice to practical ſcience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let AB (fig. 7.) be a horizontal tube, through which the water is impelled by the preſſure or head&nbsp;DA. This head is the moving power ; and it may be&nbsp;conceived as conliſting of two parts, performing two&nbsp;diſtinct offices. One of them is employed in impreſ-ſing on the water that velocity with which it </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actually&nbsp;moves</span><span class="font0"> in the tube. Were there no obſtructions to this&nbsp;motion, no greater head would be wanted ; but there&nbsp;are obſtructions ariſing from friction, adheſion, and&nbsp;viſcidity. This requires force. Let this be the office&nbsp;of the reſt of the head of water in the reſervoir. There&nbsp;is but one allotment, appropriation, or repartition, of&nbsp;the whole head which will anſwer. Suppoſe E to be&nbsp;the point of partition, ſo that DE is the head neceſſary for impreſſing the actual velocity on the water&nbsp;(a head or preſſure which has a relation to the form or&nbsp;circumſtance of the entry, and the contraction which&nbsp;takes place there). The reſt EA is wholly employed&nbsp;in overcoming the ſimultaneous reſiſtances which take&nbsp;place along the whole tube AB, and is in equilibrio&nbsp;with this reſiſtance. Therefore if we apply at E a&nbsp;tube EC of the ſame length and diameter with AB,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
