an island of the Archipelago, to the west of My- tilene, to the north-east of Negropont, and to the southeast of Sciati. It is fifteen miles in length and eight in breadth. The vines form the beauty of the island, and the wine is excellent ; nor do the natives want wood. There is but one village, and that is built on a rock, which runs up like a sugar-loaf, and is ten miles from the harbour of St George. The inhabitants are Greeks.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
