<p><span class="font0">the whole of the parliamentary register. The occupier lists are consequently there made out in two divisions only, the names which&nbsp;would elsewhere appear in division 2 being placed in division 1.&nbsp;The lists of freehold and burgage tenants in Bristol, Exeter, Norwich&nbsp;and Nottingham are to be made out and signed by the same date.&nbsp;The overseers have also to make out and sign a list of persons&nbsp;qualified as occupiers to be elected aldermen or councillors, but as&nbsp;non-residents disqualified from being on the local government&nbsp;register. By the same date also the clerks of the livery companies&nbsp;are to make out, sign and deliver to the secondary (who performs&nbsp;in the City of London the registration duties which elsewhere fall&nbsp;on the town clerk) the lists of liverymen entitled as such to the&nbsp;parliamentary vote; and the town clerks are to make out and sign&nbsp;the lists of freemen so entitled in towns where this franchise exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 1st of August all the above lists are to be published, the livery lists by the secondary, lists of freemen by the town clerks&nbsp;and the rest by the overseers. In addition the overseers may have&nbsp;to publish a list of persons disqualified by having been found guilty&nbsp;of corrupt or illegal practices; this list they will receive, when it&nbsp;exists, from the clerk of the county council or town clerk with the&nbsp;precept. Publication of lists and notices by overseers is made by&nbsp;affixing copies on the doors of the church and other places of worship&nbsp;of the parish (or, if there be none, in some public or conspicuous&nbsp;situation in the parish), and also, with the exception to be mentioned, in the case of a parish wholly or partly within a municipal&nbsp;borough or urban district, in or near every public or municipal or&nbsp;parochial office and every post and telegraph office in the parish.&nbsp;The exception is that lists and notices relating to ownership electors&nbsp;need not be published at the offices mentioned when the parish is&nbsp;within a parliamentary borough. Publication by the secondary is&nbsp;made by affixing copies outside the Guildhall and Royal Exchange ;&nbsp;publication by town clerks is. made by affixing copies outside their&nbsp;town hall, or, where there is none, in some public or conspicuous&nbsp;place in their borough. From the 1st to the 20th of August inclusive&nbsp;is allowed for the sending in of claims and objections. Those whose&nbsp;names have been omitted from the occupier or reserved rights lists,&nbsp;or the non-resident list, or whose names, place of abode or particulars of qualification have been incorrectly stated in such lists, may&nbsp;send in claims to have their names registered; lodgers who are not&nbsp;qualified as old lodgers, or who have omitted to claim as such, may&nbsp;claim as new lodgers; persons whose names are on the corrupt and&nbsp;illegal practices list may claim to have them omitted. Any person&nbsp;whose name is on the list of parliamentary’, local government. or&nbsp;parochial electors for the same parliamentary county, administrative&nbsp;county, borough or parish, may object to names on the same lists.&nbsp;Notices of claim and objection in the case of liverymen and freemen are&nbsp;to be sent to the secondary and town clerk, and in other cases to the&nbsp;overseers ; and notices of objection must also in all cases be sent to the&nbsp;person objected to. All notices must be sent inby the 20th of August,&nbsp;and on or before the 25th of August the overseers, secondary and town&nbsp;clerks are to make out, sign and publish lists of the claimants and&nbsp;persons objected to. It remains to be added that any person on a&nbsp;Fist of voters </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font0"> on one of the lists published on the 1st of August)&nbsp;may make a declaration before a magistrate or commissioner for&nbsp;oaths correcting the entry relating to him. In the case of ownership&nbsp;electors the correction can only deal with the place of abode; in the&nbsp;case of other lists it extends to all particulars stated, and is. useful&nbsp;inasmuch as it enables the revising barrister to make corrections as&nbsp;to the qualification which he could not make in the absence of a&nbsp;declaration. The declarations must be delivered to the clerk of the&nbsp;county council or town clerk on or before the 5th of September.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next stage is the revision of the lists. For this, purpose revising barristers are appointed yearly. The period within which&nbsp;revision courts can be held is from the 8th of September&nbsp;to the 12th of October, both days inclusive. The clerk of&nbsp;the county council attends the first court held for each&nbsp;parliamentary division of his county, and the town clerk&nbsp;the first court held for his city or borough; and they respectively&nbsp;produce all lists, notices and declarations in. their custody, and&nbsp;answer any questions put to them by the revising, barrister. The&nbsp;overseers also attend the courts held for their parish, produce the&nbsp;rate books, original notices of claim and objection, &amp;c., and answer&nbsp;questions. The claimants, objectors and persons objected to appear&nbsp;personally or by representative to support their several contentions. Any person qualified to be an objector may also appear&nbsp;to oppose any claims, upon giving notice to the barrister before such&nbsp;claims are reached. The powers of the revising barristers are as&nbsp;follows: As regards persons whose names are on the lists of voters&nbsp;published on the ist of August, he is to expunge the names, whether&nbsp;objected to or not, of those who are dead or subject to personal incapacity, such as infants and aliens, and for parliamentary purposes&nbsp;peers and women. If an entry is imperfect, the name must be&nbsp;removed, unless the particulars necessary for completing it are&nbsp;supplied to the barrister. All names marginally objected to by overseers must be expunged, unless the voters prove to the barrister that&nbsp;they ought to be retained. Objections made by other objectors&nbsp;must be supported by prima facie proof, and if this is not rebutted&nbsp;the name is struck out. Claimants must be ready to support their&nbsp;claims. The declaration attached to a lodger claim is indeed prima&nbsp;facie proof of the facts stated in it, but other claimants require&nbsp;evidence to make out even a prima facie case, and if they fail to&nbsp;produce it their claims will be disallowed. The barrister is required&nbsp;to correct errors in the lists of voters, and has a discretion to rectify&nbsp;mistakes in claims and objections upon evidence produced to him,&nbsp;although his power in this respect is limited. Lastly, the barrister&nbsp;has to deal with duplicates, as a voter is entitled to be on the register&nbsp;once, but not more than once, as a parliamentary voter for each&nbsp;parliamentary county or borough, as a burgess for each municipal&nbsp;borough, as a county elector Jor each electoral division, and as a&nbsp;parochial elector for each parish in which he holds a qualification.&nbsp;Consequently, he deals with duplicate entries by expunging or transferring them to separate parochial, lists. The decision of the revising barrister is final and conclusive on all questions of fact ; but&nbsp;an appeal lies from him on questions of law at the instance of any&nbsp;person aggrieved by the removal of his name from a list of voters, by&nbsp;the rejection of his claim or objection or by the allowance of a claim&nbsp;which he has opposed. Notice of the intention to appeal must be&nbsp;given to the barrister in writing on the day when nis decision is&nbsp;given. The barrister may refuse to state a case for appeal ; but if&nbsp;he does so without due cause he may be ordered by the High Court&nbsp;to state a case. The appeal is heard by a divisional court, from&nbsp;whose decision an appeal lies (by leave either of the divisional court&nbsp;or of the court of appeal) to the court of appeal, whose decision is&nbsp;final.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the completion of the revision the barrister hands the county and borough lists (every page signed and every alteration initialled&nbsp;by him) to the clerk of the county council and the town clerk respectively, to be printed. With the following exceptions the revised&nbsp;lists are to be made up and printed by the 20th of December, and&nbsp;come into force as the register for all purposes on the ist of January.&nbsp;In the boroughs created by the London Government Act 1899, the&nbsp;whole register is to be made up and printed by the 20th of October,&nbsp;and to come into force for the purpose of borough elections under&nbsp;the act on the ist of November. In boroughs subject to the Municipal Corporations Acts, divisions 1 and 3 of the occupiers’ list are&nbsp;to be made up and printed by the 20th of October, and come into&nbsp;force for the purpose of municipal and county council elections on&nbsp;the ist of November. Corrections ordered in consequence of a&nbsp;successful appeal from a revising barrister are to be made by the&nbsp;officers having the custody of the registers, but a pending appeal&nbsp;does not affect any right of voting. The register in its final form&nbsp;will consist of the lists published on the ist of August as corrected,&nbsp;with the claims which have been allowed on revision incorporated&nbsp;with them. It is printed in. such form that each list and each&nbsp;division of a list for. every parish can be separated from the rest for&nbsp;the purpose of making up the parliamentary, local government and&nbsp;parochial registers respectively. The alphabetical order is followed,&nbsp;except in London and some other large towns, where street order is&nbsp;adopted for all except the ownership lists and lists of liverymen and&nbsp;freemen. The parliamentary register for a parliamentary county&nbsp;will consist of the ownership lists for all parishes in the county, and&nbsp;of the lodger, lists and divisions 1 and 2 of the occupier lists for&nbsp;parishes within the county and not within a parliamentary borough.&nbsp;The parliamentary register for a parliamentary borough will consist&nbsp;of the lodger lists, of the lists of freehold and burgage tenants (if&nbsp;any), and of divisions 1 and 2 of the occupier lists for all parishes&nbsp;within the borough, and also of the borough lists (if any) of liverymen&nbsp;or freemen. The local government register for an administrative&nbsp;county will consist of divisions 1 and 3 of the occupier lists for all&nbsp;parishes in the county, and the burgess roll for a municipal borough&nbsp;of divisions i and 3 of the occupier lists for all parishes in the borough.&nbsp;It will be seen, therefore, that, except in county boroughs, the&nbsp;burgess roll, is also a part of the local government register of the&nbsp;administrative county within which the borough is situate. The&nbsp;register of parochial electors consists of the complete set of lists for&nbsp;each parish; but this does not include the lists of liverymen and&nbsp;freemen, which, as has been stated, are not parish lists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No one whose name is not on the register can vote at an election. The. fact that a. man’s name is on the register is now so far conclusive of his right that the returning officer is bound to receive&nbsp;his vote. Only two questions may be asked of him when he&nbsp;tenders his vote, namely, whether he is the person whose name is&nbsp;on the register, and whether he has voted before at the election.&nbsp;The Reform Act 1832 allowed him to be asked at parliamentary&nbsp;elections whether he retained the qualification for which he had&nbsp;been registered; but the Registration Act 1843 disallowed the&nbsp;question, and. made the register conclusive as to the retention of&nbsp;the qualification. When, however, a petition is presented against&nbsp;an election, the register, although conclusive as to the retention&nbsp;of the qualification, does not prevent the court from inquiring&nbsp;into the existence of personal incapacities, arising in connexion&nbsp;with the election or otherwise, and striking off on scrutiny the&nbsp;votes of persons subject thereto, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> aliens, infants, or in parliamentary elections peers, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The City of London is not within the Municipal Corporations Acts, and is not subject to the general registration law in the&nbsp;formation of its roll of citizens for municipal purposes. But a&nbsp;register of parliamentary, county and parochial electors is made in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
