Limited as it is, it is highly valuable, becauſe derived from the true principles of hydraulics.</p><p>He hoped to render it more extenfive and applicable to oblique impulfes, when the axis AC of the vein (fig. 13. n<hi rend="sup">0</hi> 2.) is inclined to the plane in an angle ACN. But here all the ſimplicity of the caſe is gone, and we are now obliged to aſcertain the motion of each filament. It might not perhaps be impoſſible to determine what muſt happen in the plane of the figure, that is, in a plane paſſing through the axis of the vein, and perpendicular to the plane MN. Bat even in this cafe it would be extremely difficult to determine how much of the fluid will go in the direction EKG, and what will go in the path FLH, and to aſcertain the form of each filament, and the velocity in its different points. But in the real ſtate of the caſe, the water will diffipate from the centre C on every ſide ; and we cannot tell in what proportions. Let us however eon-ſider a little what happens in the plane of the figure, and ſuppofe that all the water goes either in the courſe EKG or in the courſe FLH. Let the quantities of water which take theſe two eourfes have the proportions of<hi rend="italic">p</hi>  aud <hi rend="sup">π</hi>. Letv<hi rend="sup">z</hi>  2α be the velocity at A, <hi rend="italic">fTb</hi>  be the velocity at G, and <hi rend="italic">*∕ 2 β</hi>  be the velocity at H. ACG and ACH are the two changes of di-rection, of which let <hi rend="italic">c</hi>  and —¢ be the coſines. Then, adopting the former reaſoning, we have the preſſure of the watery plate GKEACM on the plane in the di-<hi rend="italic">p--</hi></p><p>rectιon AC = ~~— ×2 <hi rend="italic">a—lc b,</hi>  and the preffure of the ? + n    &lt; <hi rend="sup">r</hi></p><p>∏--</p><p>,ate HLFACN = —r—,× <hi rend="italic">2a</hi>  4- <hi rend="italic">2cβ,</hi>  and their ſum</p><p>pi _ <hi rend="underline">∕+<hi rend="sup">π</hi></hi></p><p>∕&gt;×2a-2r5+∏×2a-t-2c^    .    .    <hi rend="sub">1</hi> . ,. ,.</p><p>= ----’ <hi rend="sup">w</hi>h'<hi rend="sup">c</hi>*<hi rend="sup">1</hi> being multiplied by</p><p>the fine of ACM or *∕ 1—c<hi rend="sup">1</hi>, gives the preſſure perpendicular to the plane MN-    --—^~^^<hi rend="sup">π</hi></p><p>1_ ’ ∕+<hi rend="sup">π</hi></p><p>+ 2f∕3    .-<hi rend="sub">r</hi></p><p>But there remains a preſſure in the direction- perpendicular to the axis of the veiu, which is not balanced, as in the former caſe, by the equality on oppofite ſides ot the axis.

If indeed we fuppoſe the velocity in G and H are equal to that at A, then <hi rend="italic">b-β<hi rend="sub">t</hi>  z=a,</hi>  and the whole impulſe is 2aV<hi rend="sup">z</hi>  1—&lt;<hi rend="sup">z</hi>, as is commonly ſup-poted. But this cannot be. Both the velocity and quantity at H are leſs than thote at G. Nay, frequent-ly there is no efflux on the fide H when the obliquity is very great, we may conclude in general, that the oblique impulte will always bear to the direct impulſe a greater proportion than that of the fine of incidence to radius. If the whole water eſcapes at G, and none goes off laterally, the preſſure will be<hi rend="italic">2a+2ac—2bcX,</hi></p><p>1 —Λ The experiments of the Abbé Boſſut ſhow in the plaineſt manner that the preſſure of a vein, ſtriking obliquely on a plane which receives it wholly, diminiſhes faſter than in the ratio of the ſquare of the fine of incidence ; whereas, when the oblique plane is wholly immerted in the ſtream, the impulfe is much greater than in this proportion, and in great obliquities is nearly as the fiue.</p><p>Nor will this propoſition determine the impulfe of a fiuid on a plane wholly immerted in it, even when the impulfe is perpendicular to the plane. The circumſtance is now wanting on which we can eſtabliſh a calculation, namely, the angle of final deflection. Could this be afcertained for each filament, and the velocity of the filament, the principles are completely adequate to an accurate folution of the problem. In the experiments which we mentioned to have been made under the inſpection of Sir Charles Knowles, a-cylinder of fix inches diameter was expoſcd to the action of a ſtream moving precitely one foot per ſecond ; and when certain deductions were made for the water which was held adhering to the poſterior baſe (as will be noticed afterwards), the impulte was found equal to 3∣ ounces avoirdupois. There were 36coloured filaments diſtributed on the ſtream, in fuch ſituations as to give the moſt ufefal indications of their curvature. If was found neceſſary to have ſome which paſſed under the body and ſome above it ; for the form of theſe filaments, at the ſame diſtance from the axis of the cylinder, was conſiderably. different : and thoſe filaments which were ſituated in planes neither horizontal nor vertical took a double curvature» In ſhort, the curves were ail’traced with great care, and the deflecting forces were computed for each, and reduced to the direction of the axis ; and they were ſnmrned up in ſuch' a manner as to give the impuite of the whole ſtream. The deflections were marked as far a-head of the cylinder as they could be aſſuredly ob-ſerved. By this method the impulſe was computed to be 2J-¾∙ ounces,, differing from obtervation √<hi rend="sub">δ</hi>- of an ounce, or about <hi rend="sub">τ</hi>⅛ of the whole; a difference which may moſt reaſonably be afcribed to the adheſion of the water, which muſt be moſt ſenfible in ſuch ſmall velo-citiee. T∩ete experiments may therefore be confidered as giving all the confirmation that can be deſired of the jiiſtnefs of the principles.· This indeed hardly admits of a doubt :, but, alas ! it gives us but fmall’aſſiſtance ; for all this is empirical, in as far as it leaves us in every caſe the taſk of obſerving the form of the curves and the velocities in their different points. To derive fer-vice from this moſt judicious method of Daniel Bernoulli, we muſt diſcover feme method of determining,-»</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
