<p><span class="font4">picions of suicide having at the time and since been frequent. On the whole the theory of a natural death due to a fit of apoplexy and perhaps to injuries inflicted accidentally during that fit seems most probable. He had always&nbsp;sufiered from internal and constitutional ailments not&nbsp;unlikely to bring about such an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rousseau’s character, the history of his reputation, and the </span><span class="font1">intrin si </span><span class="font3">P. value of his literary work are all subjects of much&nbsp;interest. There is little doubt that for the last ten or fifteen years&nbsp;of his life, if not from the time of his quarrel with Diderot and&nbsp;Madame d’Épinay, he was not wholly sane—the combined influence&nbsp;of late and unexpected literary fame and of constant solitude and&nbsp;discomfort acting upon his excitable temperament so as to overthrow&nbsp;the balance, never very stable, of his fine and acute but unrobust&nbsp;intellect. He was by no means the only man of letters of his time&nbsp;who'had to submit to something like persecution. Freron on the&nbsp;orthodox side had his share of it, as well as Voltaire, Helvétius,&nbsp;Diderot, and Montesquieu on that of the innovators. But&nbsp;Rousseau had not, like Montesquieu,.a position which guaranteed&nbsp;him from serious danger ; he was not wealthy like Helvétius ; he had&nbsp;not the wonderful suppleness and trickiness which even without&nbsp;his wealth would probably have defended Voltaire himself; and he&nbsp;lacked entirely the “bottom” of Fréron and Diderot. When he&nbsp;was molested </span><span class="font4">he </span><span class="font3">could only shriek at his enemies and suspect his&nbsp;friends, and, being more given than any man whom Iiistorymentions&nbsp;to this latter weakness, lie suffered intensely from it. His moral&nbsp;character was undoubtedly weak in other ways than this, but it is&nbsp;fair to remember that but for his astounding </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions</span><span class="font3"> the more&nbsp;disgusting parts of it would not have been known, and that these&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Confesswns</span><span class="font3"> were written, if not under hallucination, at any rate in&nbsp;circumstances entitling the self-condemned criminal to the benefit&nbsp;of very considerable doubt. If Rousseau had held his tongue, he&nbsp;might have stood lower as a man of letters ; he would pretty&nbsp;certainly have stood higher as a man. He was, moreover, really&nbsp;sinned against, if still more sinning. The conduct of Grimm to&nbsp;him was certainly very bad ; and, though Walpole was not his&nbsp;personal friend, a worse action than his famous letter, considering&nbsp;the well-known idiosyncrasy of the subject, would be difficult to&nbsp;find. It was his own fault that he saddled himself with the Le&nbsp;Vasseurs, but their conduct was probably if not certainly ungrateful&nbsp;in the extreme. Only excuses can be made for him ; but the excuses&nbsp;for a man born, as Hume after the quarrel said of him, “ without&nbsp;a skin ” are numerous and strong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It was to be expected that his peculiar reputation would increase rather than diminish after his death ; and it did so. During his&nbsp;life his personal peculiarities and the fact that his opinions were&nbsp;nearly as obnoxious to the one party as to the other worked against&nbsp;him, but it was not so after his death. The men of the Revolution&nbsp;regarded him with something like idolatry, and his literary merits&nbsp;conciliated many who were very far from idolizing him as a&nbsp;revolutionist. His style was taken up by Bernardin de Saint&nbsp;Pierre and by Chateaubriand. It was employed for purposes quite&nbsp;different from those to which he had himself applied it, and the&nbsp;reaction triumphed by the very arms which had been most powerful&nbsp;in the hands of the Revolution. Byron’s fervid panegyric enlisted on his side all who admired Byron—that is to say, the&nbsp;majority of the younger men and women of Europe between 1820&nbsp;and 1850—and thus different sides of his tradition were continued&nbsp;for a full century after the publication of his chief books. His&nbsp;religious unorthodox}* was condoned because he never scoffed ; his&nbsp;political heresies, after their first effect was over, seemed harmless&nbsp;from the very want of logic and practical spirit in them, while part&nbsp;at least of his literary secret was the common property of almost&nbsp;everyone who attempted literature. At the present day persons as&nbsp;different as M. Renan and Mr Ruskin are children of Rousseau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is therefore important to characterize this influence which was and is so powerful, and there are three points of view—those of&nbsp;religion, politics, and literature—which it is necessary to take in&nbsp;doing this. In religion Rousseau was undoubtedly what he has&nbsp;been called above—a sentimental deist ; but no one who reads him&nbsp;with the smallest attention can fail to see that sentimentalism was&nbsp;the essence, deism the accident of his creed. In his time orthodoxy at once generous and intelligent hardly existed in France.&nbsp;There were ignorant persons who were sincerely orthodox; there were&nbsp;intelligent persons who pretended to be so. But between the time&nbsp;of Massillon and D’Aguesseau and the time of Lamennais and Joseph&nbsp;de Maistre the class of men of whom in England Berkeley, Butler,&nbsp;and Johnson were representatives simply did not exist in France.&nbsp;Little inclined by nature to any but the emotional side of religion,&nbsp;and utterly undisciplined in any other by education, course of life,&nbsp;or the general tendency of public opinion, Rousseau naturally took&nbsp;refuge in the nebulous kind of natural religion which was at once&nbsp;fashionable and convenient. If his practice fell very far short even&nbsp;of his own very arbitrary standard of morality as much may be said&nbsp;of persons far more dogmatically orthodox.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In politics, on the other hand, there is no doubt that Rousseau was a sincere and, as far as in him lay, a convinced republican. He&nbsp;had no great tincture of learning, he was by no means a profound&nbsp;logician, and he was impulsive and emotional in the extreme—&nbsp;characteristics which in political matters undoubtedly predispose&nbsp;the subject to the preference of equality above all political&nbsp;requisites. He saw that under the French monarchy the actual&nbsp;result was the greatest misery of the greatest number, and he did&nbsp;not look much further. The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Contrat Social</span><span class="font3"> is for the political&nbsp;student one of the most curious and interesting books existing.&nbsp;Historically it is null ; logically it is full of gaping flaws ; practically&nbsp;its manipulations of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">volonté de tous</span><span class="font3"> and the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">volonté générale&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">are clearly insufficient to obviate anarchy. But its mixture of real&nbsp;eloquence and apparent cogency is exactly such as always carries a&nbsp;multitude with it, if only for a time. Moreover, in some minor&nbsp;branches of politics and economics Rousseau w<sup>,</sup>as a real reformer.&nbsp;Visionary as his educational schemes (chiefly promulgated in&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Émile}</span><span class="font3"> are in parts, they are admirable in others, and his protest&nbsp;against mothers refusing to nurse their children hit a blot in&nbsp;French life which is not removed yet, and has always been a source&nbsp;of weakness to the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But it is as a literary man pure and simple—that is to say, as an exponent rather than as an originator of ideas—that Rousseau is&nbsp;most noteworthy, and that he has exercised most influence. The&nbsp;first thing noticeable about him is that he defies all customary and&nbsp;mechanical classification. He is not a dramatist—his work as such&nbsp;is insignificant—nor a novelist, for, though his two chief works&nbsp;except the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions</span><span class="font3"> are called novels, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Émile</span><span class="font3"> is one only in name,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">La Nouvelle Héloïse</span><span class="font3"> is as a story diffuse, prosy, and awkward to&nbsp;a degree. He was perfectly without command of poetic form, and&nbsp;he could only be called a philosopher in an age when the term w<sup>,</sup>as&nbsp;used with such meaningless laxity as was customary in the 18th&nbsp;century. If he must be classed, he w<sup>τ</sup>as before all things a describer&nbsp;—a describer of the passions of the human heart and of the beauties&nbsp;of nature. In the first part of his vocation the novelists of his own&nbsp;youth, such as Marivaux, Richardson, and Prévost, may be said to&nbsp;have shown him the way, though he improved greatly upon them ;&nbsp;in the second he was almost a creator. In Combiningthe two and&nbsp;expressing the effect of nature on the feelings and of the feelings&nbsp;on the aspect of nature he was absolutely without a forerunner or&nbsp;a model. And, as literature since his time has been chiefly&nbsp;differentiated from literature before it by the colour and tone&nbsp;resulting from this combination, Rousseau may be said to hold, as&nbsp;an influence, a place almost unrivalled in literary history. The&nbsp;defects of all sentimental writing—occasional triviality and exaggeration of trivial things, diffuseness, overstrained emotion, false&nbsp;sentiment, disregard of the intellectual and the practical—are of&nbsp;course noticeable in him, but they are excused and palliated by&nbsp;his wonderful feeling, and by what may be called the passionate&nbsp;sincerity even of his insincere passages. Some cavils have been&nbsp;made against his French, but none of much weight or importance.&nbsp;And in such passages as the famous “Voila de la pervenche” of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions,</span><span class="font3"> as the description of the isle of St Pierre in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rêveries,</span><span class="font3"> as some of the letters in the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Nouvelle Hetowe</span><span class="font3"> and others,&nbsp;he has achieved the greatest success possible—that of absolute&nbsp;perfection in doing what he intended to do. The reader, as it has&nbsp;been said, may think he might have done something else with&nbsp;advantage, but he can hardly think that he could have done this&nbsp;thing better.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The dates of most of Rousseau’s works published during Iiislifetime have been given above. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rêveries,</span><span class="font0"> which, read in private, had given much&nbsp;umbrage to persons concerned, and which the author did not intend to be&nbsp;published until the end of the century, appeared at Geneva in 1782. In the same&nbsp;year and the following appeared a complete edition in forty-seven small volumes.&nbsp;There have been many since, the most important of them being that of SIusset-Pathay (Paris, 1823). Some unpublished works, chiefly letters, were added by&nbsp;Bosscha (Paris, 1858) and Streckcisen SIoultou (Paris, 1861). The most convenient edition is perhaps that of Didot in 4 vols, large 8vo, but a handsome and&nbsp;well-edited collection is still something of a desideratum. Works on Rousseau&nbsp;are innumerable. The chief are—in French that of Saint SIarc Girardin (1874),&nbsp;in English the excellent book of Sir John SIorley.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G. SA.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">ROUSSEAU, </span><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Théodore</span><span class="font4"> (1812-1867), a distinguished landscape painter, was born at Paris, and studied in the&nbsp;Ecole des Beaux-Arts, after which he spent some time in&nbsp;travelling and making studies of landscape and sky effects.&nbsp;He first exhibited at the Salon in 1834, obtained gold&nbsp;medals in 1849 and 1854, and in 1852 received the&nbsp;Legion of Honour. His paintings became very popular in&nbsp;France, and Rousseau grew to be the acknowledged&nbsp;founder of the modern realistic school of landscape. He&nbsp;was largely influenced in style by Constable and Turner,&nbsp;the former of whom was perhaps more thoroughly appreciated in France than in England. The influence of Turner&nbsp;is clearly seen in some of Rousseau’s pictures, with striking&nbsp;effects of cloud or storm,—as, for example, in his Effet&nbsp;de Soleil and Après la Pluie (1852), in the Matinée</span></p>
