(Dr Robert), an eminent divine, was the ſon of Mr William South a merchant of London, and was born at Hackney near that city in 1633. He ſtu- died at Weſtminſter ſchool, and afterwards in Chriſt- church college, Oxford. In 1654, he wrote a copy of Latin verſes to congratulate Cromwell upon the peace concluded with the Dutch ; and the next year a Latin poem, intitled <hi rend="italic">Musica Incantans.</hi> In 1660 he was elected public orator of the univerſity ; and the next year became domeſtic chaplain to Edward earl of Clarendon, lord-high chancellor of England. In 1663 he was inſtalled prebendary of Weſtminſter, admitted to the degree of doctor of divinity, and had a ſinecure beſtowed on him in Wales by his patron the earl of Clarendon ; after whoſe retirement into France in 1667 he became chaplain to the duke of York. In 1670 he was inſtalled canon of Chriſt-church in Oxford ; and in 1676 attended as chaplain to Laurence Hyde, Eſq; ambaſſador extraordinary to the king of Poland. In 1678 he was preſented to the rectory of Islip in Oxfordſhire ; and in 1680 rebuilt the chancel of that church, as he afterwards did the rectory-houſe belonging to it. After the revolution he took the oath of allegiance to king William and queen Mary, though he excuſed himſelf from accepting a great dignity in the church, vacated by the perſonal refuſal of that oath.

cline ſeveral years before his death, which happened in 1716. He was interred in Weſtminſter Abbey, where a monument is erected to his memory. He publiſhed, I. Animadverſions on Dr Sherlock’s Vindication of the Holy and Ever Bleſſed Trinity. 2. A Defence of his Animadverſions. 3. Sermons, 8 vols 8vo. And after his deceaſe were publiſhed his <hi rend="italic">Opera Posthuma Latina,</hi> and his poſthumous Engliſh works. Dr South was remarkable for his wit, which abounds in all his writings, and particularly in his sermons ; but at the ſame time they equally abound in ill-humour, ſpleen, and ſatire. He was remarkable for being a time-ſerver. During the life of Cromwell he was a ſtaunch Preſbyterian, and then railed againſt the Independents : at the Reſtoration he exerted his pulpit-eloquence againſt the Preſbyterians ; and in the reign of Queen Anne, was a warm advocate for Sacheverel.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">South,</hi> one of the four cardinal points from which the winds blow.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> South</hi> <hi rend="italic">Sea,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pacific Ocean,</hi> is that vaſt body of water interpoſed between Aſia and America. It does not however, ſtrictly ſpeaking, reach quite to the continent of Aſia, excepting to the northward of the peninſula of Malacca : for the water interpoſed between the eaſtern coaſt of Africa and the peninſula just mentioned has the name of the <hi rend="italic">Indian Ocean.</hi> The South Sea then is bounded on one ſide by the weſtern coaſt of America, through its whole extent, from the unknown regions in the north to the ſtraits of Magellan and Terra del Fuego, where it communicates with the ſouthern part of the Atlantic. On the other ſide, it is hounded by the coaſt of Aſia, from the northern promontory of Tſchukotſkoi Noss, to the peninſula of Malacca already mentioned. Thence it is bounded to the ſouth- ward by the northern coaſts of Borneo, Celebes, Macassar, New Guinea, New Holland, and the other iſlands in that quarter, which divide it from the Indian Ocean. Then, waſhing the eaſtern coaſt of the great iſland of New Holland, it communicates with that vaſt body of water encompaſſing the whole ſouthern part of the globe, and which has the general name of the <hi rend="italic">Southern Ocean</hi> all round. Thus does this vaſt ocean occupy almoſt the ſemicircumference of the globe, extending almoſt from one pole to the other, and about the equatorial parts extending almoſt 180⁰ in longitude, or 12,500 of our miles.</p><p>The northern parts of the Pacific Ocean are entirely deſtitute of land ; not a ſingle iſland having yet been diſcovered in it from the latitude of 40⁰ north and upwards, excepting ſuch as are very near the coaſt either of Aſia or America ; but in the ſouthern part there arc a great number.</p><p>Till very lately the South Sea was in a great meaſure unknown. From the great extent of ice which covers the ſouthern part of the globe, it was imagined that much more land exiſted there than in the northern regions : but that this could not be juſtly inferred merely from that circumſtance, is plain from what has been advanced under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">America,</hi> n⁰ 3—24; and the ſouthern continent, long known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Terra Australis,</hi> has eluded the ſearch of the moſt expert navigators ſent out from Britain and France by royal authority.
