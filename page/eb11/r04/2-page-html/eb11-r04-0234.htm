<p><span class="font0">it properly belongs. The largest and most beautiful of the many freshwater lakes is Loch Maree (?.v.), but a few of the&nbsp;others are interesting. In the far north-west, 243 ft. above&nbsp;the sea, lies Loch Skinaskink, a lake of such irregularity of&nbsp;outline that it has a shore-line of 17 m. It contains several&nbsp;islands covered with rich woods affording a shelter to deer,&nbsp;and drains into Enard Bay by the Polly. Lochan Fada (the&nbsp;“ long loch ”), 1005 ft. above the sea, is 3} m. in length, has a&nbsp;greatest breadth of ? m., covers an area of 1</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">J </span><span class="font0">sq. m., and is 248 ft.&nbsp;deep, with a mean depth of 102 ft. Once drained by the Muic,&nbsp;it has been tapped a little farther west by the Fhasaigh, which&nbsp;has lowered the level of the lake sufficiently to behead the&nbsp;Muic. Other lakes are, north of Loch Maree, Loch Fionn&nbsp;(the “ white ” or “ clear ” lake), 8 m. long by 1 m. wide, famous&nbsp;for its heronries; towards the centre of the shire, Loch Luichart&nbsp;(5 m. long by from | ra. to nearly 1 m. wide), fringed with&nbsp;birches and having the shape of a crescent; the mountain-girt Loch Fannich (7 m. long by 1 m. wide); and the wild&nbsp;narrow lochs Monar (4 m. long) and Mullardoch (5 m. long),&nbsp;on the Inverness-shire boundary. Of the straths or valleys&nbsp;the more important run from the centre eastwards, such as&nbsp;Strathconon (12 m.), Strathbran (10 m.), Strathgarve (8 m.),&nbsp;Strathpeffer (6 m.) and Strathcarron (r4 m.). Excepting&nbsp;Glen Orrin (13 m.), in the east central district, the longer glens&nbsp;lie in the south and towards the west. In the extreme south&nbsp;Glen Shiel (9 m.) runs between fine .mountains to its mouth&nbsp;on Loch Duich. General Wade’s road passes down the glen.&nbsp;Farther north are Glen Elchaig (9 m.), Glen Carron (12 m.),&nbsp;in the latter of which the track of the Dingwall &amp; Skye&nbsp;railway is laid, and Glen Torridon (6 m.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geology.</span><span class="font0">—The central portion of this county is occupied by the younger highland schists or Dalradian series. These consist of&nbsp;quartzites, mica-schists, garnetiferous mica-schists and gneisses, all&nbsp;with a gentle inclination towards the S.E. On the eastern side of&nbsp;the county the Dalradian schists are covered unconformably by the&nbsp;Old Red Sandstone; the boundary runs southward from Edderton on&nbsp;Dornoch Firth, by Strathpeffer, to the neighbourhood of Beauly.&nbsp;These rocks comprise red flags and sandstones, grey bituminous&nbsp;flags and shales. An anticlinal fold with a S.W.-N.E. axis brings up&nbsp;the basal beds of the series about the mouth of Cromarty Firth and&nbsp;exposes once more the schists in the Sutors guarding the entrance&nbsp;to the firth. The western boundary of the younger schist is formed&nbsp;by the great pre-Cambrian dislocation, line which traverses the&nbsp;county in a fairly direct course from Elphin on the north by Ullapool&nbsp;to Glencarron. Most of the area west of the line of disturbance is&nbsp;covered by Torridonian Sandstone, mainly dark reddish sandstones,&nbsp;grits and shales, resting unconformably on the ancient Lewisian&nbsp;gneiss with horizontal or slightly inclined bedding. The unconformity is well exposed on the shores of Gairloch, Loch Maree and&nbsp;Loch Torridon. These rocks, which attain a considerable thickness&nbsp;and are divisible into three sub-groups, build up tht mountain&nbsp;districts about Applccross, Coigach and elsewhere. Within the&nbsp;Torridonian tract the older, Lewisian gneiss occupies large areas&nbsp;north of Coigach, on the east of Enard Bay, between Gruinard&nbsp;Bay and Loch Maree; between the last named and Gairloch, on&nbsp;both sides of middle Loch Torridon and at many other spots&nbsp;smaller patches are to be found. The Lewisian gneiss is everywhere penetrated by basic dikes, generally with a N.W.-S.E.&nbsp;direction; some of these are of great breadth. The Torridonian&nbsp;rocks are succeeded unconformably by a series of Cambrian strata&nbsp;which is confined to a variable but, on the whole, narrow belt lying&nbsp;west of the line of main thrusting. This belt of Cambrian rocks has&nbsp;itself suffered an enormous amount of subordinate thrusting. It is&nbsp;composed of the following subdivisions in ascending order: false-bedded quartzite, “Pipe Rock” quartzite, fucoid beds and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Olenellus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">band, serpulite grit, Durness dolomite and marble, Durness dqlomite&nbsp;and limestone: but these are not always visible at any one spot. So&nbsp;great has been the disturbance in the region of thrusting that in&nbsp;some places, as in the neighbourhood of Loch Kishorn and elsewhere, the rocks have been completely overturned and the ancient&nbsp;gneiss has been piled upon the Torridonian. On the shore of Moray&nbsp;Firth at Rathie a small patch of Kimeridge shale occurs; and&nbsp;beneath the cliffs of Shandwick there is a little Lower Oolite with a&nbsp;thin seam of coal. Glacial striae are found upon the mountains up to&nbsp;heights of 3000 ft., and much boulder clay is found in the valleys and&nbsp;spread over large areas in the eastern districts. Raised beaches&nbsp;occur at 100, 50 and 25 ft. above the present sea-level; they are well&nbsp;seen in Loch Carron. Lewis, on Long Island, is made almost entirely&nbsp;of ancient “ Lewisian gneiss.“ but a little Torridonian occurs about&nbsp;Stornoway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Climate and Agriculture.</span><span class="font0">—On the west coast the rainfall is excessive, averaging for the year 50-42 in. at Loch Broom and&nbsp;62 in. at Strome Ferry (autumn and winter being the wettest&nbsp;seasons), but on the east coast the annual is only mean 27 in. The&nbsp;temperature for the year is 46-5° F., for January 38° F. and for&nbsp;July 57° F. The most fertile tracts lie on the eastern coast, especially in Easter Ross and the Black Isle, where the soil varies from a&nbsp;light sandy gravel to a rich deep loam. Among grain crops oats is&nbsp;that most generally cultivated, but barley and wheat are also raised.&nbsp;Turnips and potatoes are the chief green crops. On the higher&nbsp;grounds there is a large extent of good pasturage which carries&nbsp;heavy flocks of sheep, blackfaced being the principal breed. Most&nbsp;of the horses, principally half-breds between the old garrons (hardy,&nbsp;serviceable, small animals) and Clydesdales, are maintained for the&nbsp;purposes of agriculture. The herds of cattle, mainly native Highland&nbsp;or crosses, are large, many of them supplying the London market.&nbsp;Pigs are reared, though in smaller numbers than formerly, most&nbsp;generally by the crofters. Owing partly to the overcrowding of the&nbsp;island of Lewis and partly to the unkindly nature of the bulk of the&nbsp;surface—which offers no opportunity, for other than patchwork&nbsp;tillage—the number of small holdings.is enormous. Sutherlandshire&nbsp;alone amongst Scottish counties showing an even Larger proportion&nbsp;of holdings under 5 acres; while the average size of all the holdings&nbsp;throughout the shire does not exceed 20 acres. About 800,000 acres&nbsp;are devoted to deer forests, a greater area than in any other county&nbsp;in Scotland, among the largest being Achnashellach (50,000 acres),&nbsp;Fannich (20,000), Kinlochluichart (20,600), Braemore (40,000), Inch-bae (21,000) and Dundonnell (23,000). At one time the area&nbsp;under wood must have been remarkable, if we accept the common&nbsp;derivation of the word “Ross“ as from the Irish </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ros,</span><span class="font0"> “a wood,“&nbsp;and there is still a considerable extent of native woodland, principally fir, oak, ash and alder. The fauna is noteworthy. Red and&nbsp;roe deer abound, and foxes and alpine hares are common, while&nbsp;badgers and wild cats are occasionally trapped. Winged game are&nbsp;plentiful, and amongst birds of prey the golden eagle and osprey&nbsp;occur. ’ Waterfowl of all kinds frequent the sea lochs; many rivers&nbsp;and lakes are rich in salmon and trout, and the pearl mussel is&nbsp;found in the bed of the Conon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Other Industries.—</span><span class="font0">Apart from agriculture, the fisheries are the only considerable industry, the county containing two fishery&nbsp;districts—Stornoway and Cromarty—and portions of two others—&nbsp;Loch Broom (the remainder belonging to Sutherlandshire) and Loch&nbsp;Carron (which includes part of Inverness-shire) Herring, cod and&nbsp;ling form the principal catch, while salmon are taken in large&nbsp;quantities in the bays and. at the mouth of rivers. Distilleries are&nbsp;found near Dingwall, Tain and some other places, and there are&nbsp;manufactures, on a very limited scale, of woollens, chemical&nbsp;manures and aerated waters, besides some sandstone quarrying and&nbsp;flour mills. At Muir of Ord, in the parish of Urray, are held great&nbsp;horse, cattle and sheep markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Highland railway entering the county to the north of Beauly runs northwards to Dingwall, and then strikes off to the north-east&nbsp;by Invergordon and Tain, where it bends to the west by north,&nbsp;leaving the shire at Culrain, having largely followed the coast&nbsp;throughout. At Muir of Ord it sends off the Black Isle branch and&nbsp;at Dingwall a branch to Strathpeffer, as well as a line to Strome&nbsp;Ferry and Kyle of. Lochalsh. on the.south-western shore. Coaches&nbsp;connect various districts with stations on the Dingwall &amp; Skye&nbsp;railway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Population and Administration.</span><span class="font0">—The population of the county in 1891 was 78,727, and in 1901 that of the mainland&nbsp;was 47,501, and of the islands 28,949, an aggregate of 76,450&nbsp;or 25 to the sq. m. Thus Ross and Cromarty, though the&nbsp;third largest in size, is the least populated county in Scotland,&nbsp;excepting Sutherland, Inverness and Argyll. In 1901 there&nbsp;were 12,171 persons who spoke Gaelic only (of whom 9928&nbsp;belonged to the islands) and 39,392 speaking Gaelic and English&nbsp;(of whom 15,990 were insular). The chief towns and villages&nbsp;are Stornoway (pop. 2854), Dingwall (2485), Fortrose (1322),&nbsp;Tain (2067), Cromarty (1242), Invergordon (1085). Ullapool&nbsp;is a small fishing port near the mouth of Loch Broom. For&nbsp;administrative purposes the county is divided into six districts,&nbsp;namely, Black Isle (pop. 6271), Easter Ross (12,192), Lewis&nbsp;(28,760), Mid Ross (12,953), South-Western Ross (4103) and&nbsp;Western Ross (5394)* The county returns one member to&nbsp;parliament, and Cromarty, Dingwall and Tain belong to the&nbsp;Wick group of parliamentary burghs, and Fortrose to the&nbsp;Inverness group. Excepting Cromarty, these are royal burghs,&nbsp;and Dingwall is the- county town. Ross and Cromarty forms&nbsp;a sheriffdom with Sutherlandshire, and there are resident&nbsp;sheriffs-substitute at Dingwall and Stornoway, the former&nbsp;also sitting at Tain and Cromarty. The shire is under school-board control, and there are academies at Tain, Dingwall&nbsp;and Fortrose, while several schools earn grants for higher&nbsp;education. The county council gives the “ residue ” grant</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
