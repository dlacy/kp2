<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">what </span><span class="font1">is above laid down, will enable us to deter-miiie a very important queftion concerning emotions raiſed by the fine arts, viz. whether ought ſimilar&nbsp;emotions to ſucceed each other, or diſſimilar ? The&nbsp;emotions raiſed by the fine arts are for the moft part&nbsp;too nearly related to make a figure by reſemblance ;&nbsp;and for that reafon their fucceſſion ought to be regu-latcd as much as poſſible by contrail. This holds&nbsp;confcffedly in epic and dramatic compoſitions ; and the&nbsp;belt writers, led perhaps by taſte more than by rea-foning, have generally aimed at that &quot;beauty. It holds&nbsp;equally in muſic : in the ſame cantata all the variety of&nbsp;emotions that are within the power of muſic, may not&nbsp;only be indulged, but, to make the greateſt figure,&nbsp;ought to be contraſted. In gardening, there is an ad-ditional reaſon for the rule : the emotions raiſed by&nbsp;that art, are at beſt ſo faint, that every artifice ſirould&nbsp;be employed to give them their utmoſt vigour : a field&nbsp;may be laid out in grand, ſweet, gay, neat, wild, melancholy ſcenes ; and when theſe are viewed in ſucceſ</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ſion, grandeur ought to be contraſted with neatnefs, regularity with wildneſs, and gaiety with melancholy,&nbsp;ſo as that each emotion may fucceed its oppoſite :&nbsp;nay, it is an improvement to intermix in the fucceſſion&nbsp;rude uncultivated ſpots as well as unbounded views,&nbsp;which in themſelves are diſagreeable, but in ſucceſſion&nbsp;heighten the feeling of the agreeable object ; and we&nbsp;have nature for our guide, which in her moſt beautiful&nbsp;landſcapes often intermixes rugged rocks, dirty marſties,&nbsp;and barren ſtony heaths. The greateſt maſters of mu-ſic have the ſame view in their compoſitions : the fecond&nbsp;part of an Italian ſong ſeldom conveys any ſentiment :&nbsp;and, by lts harſhneſs, ſeems purpoſely contrived to&nbsp;give a greater reliſli for the interefting parts of the&nbsp;compoſition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A ſmall garden, comprehended under a fingle view, affords little opportunity for that embelliſhment. Diſſi-milar emotions require different tones of mind ; and&nbsp;therefore in conjunction can never be pleaſant : gai-ety and ſweetneſs may be combined, or wildneſs and&nbsp;gloomineſs ; but a compoſition of gaiety and gloomi-neſs is diſtaſteſul. The rude uncultivated compartment&nbsp;of furze and broom in Richmond garden, hath a good&nbsp;effect in the fucceſſion of objects ; but a ſpot of that&nbsp;nature would be inſufferable in the midſt of a poliſhed&nbsp;parterre or flower-plot. A garden, therefore, if not of&nbsp;great extent, admits not diſſimilar emotions ; and in&nbsp;ornamenting a ſmall garden, the ſafeſt courſe is to&nbsp;confine it to a ſingle expreſſion. For the ſame reafon,&nbsp;a landſcape ought alſo to be confined to a fingle ex-preſſion ; and accordingly it is a rule in painting, that&nbsp;if the ſubject be gay, every figure ought to contribute&nbsp;to that emotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It follows from the foregoing train of reaſoning, that a garden near a great city ought to have an air of ſolitude. The folitarineſs, again, of a waſte country ought&nbsp;to be contraſted in forming a garden ; no temples, no&nbsp;obfcure walks ; but </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jets d’eau,</span><span class="font1"> caſcades, objects active,&nbsp;gay, and ſplendid.. Nay, fuch a gat den ſhould in ſome&nbsp;meaſure avoid imitating nature, by taking on an ex-traordſhary appearance of regularity and art, to ſhow&nbsp;the buſy hand of man, which in a waſte country has a&nbsp;fine effect by contraſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">wit and ridicule make not an agreeable mixture</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">with grandeur, Diſſimilar emotions have a fine effect in a flow ſucceſſion ; but in a rapid ſucceſſion, which&nbsp;approaches to co-exiſtence, they will not be reliſhed.&nbsp;In the midſt of a laboured and elevated deſcription of&nbsp;battle, virgil introduces a ludicrous image, which is&nbsp;certainly out of its pla&quot;ce :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">obvius ambuſtum torrem Chorinæus ab ara Corripit, ct veπienti Ebυfo plagamque ferenti&nbsp;occupai os fiammis : illi ingens barba relûxit,&nbsp;Nidoremque ambuſta dédit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'Æn.</span><span class="font1"> xii. 298,</span></p>

This poem&nbsp;doth not always ſoar above the clouds : it admits great&nbsp;variety ; and upon occafion can deſcertd even to the&nbsp;ground without finking. In its more familiar tones, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ludicrous ſcene may be introduced without impropriety. This is done by virgil * in a foot-race : the cir</span></p>

After a fit of merriment,&nbsp;we are, it is true, the leſs difpoſed to the ferious and&nbsp;fublime : but then, a ludicrous ſcene, by unbending&nbsp;the mind from ſevere application to more intereſting&nbsp;ſubjects, may prevent fatigue, and preſerve our reliſli&nbsp;entire.</span></p>

By revenge, the inflicting&nbsp;of pain upon the perfon who has injured or offended&nbsp;us, farther than the juſt ends of puniſhment or reparation require. Anger prompts to revenge ; but it is&nbsp;poſſible to ſuſpend the effect when we cannot altogether quell the principle, we are bound alfo to endeavour to qualify and correct the principle itfelf.
