Believe me, my Lord, I look upon you as a ſpirit entered into another life, as one just upon, the edge of immortality, where the paſſions and affections muſt be much more exalted, and where you ought to deſpiſe all little views and all mean retroſpects. Nothing is worth your looking back ; and therefore look forward, and make (as you can) the world look after you ; but take care it be not with pity, but with eſteem and admiration.

They flourished at the revival of learning, and contributed a great deal towards dispelling. the cloud of ignorance which had ſo long overſhadowed Europe. Some of the claſſics before the 16th century were in a great meaſure loſt, and all of them were exceedingly corrupted. By their abilities and indefatigable induſtry theſe defects were ſupplied, and the learned were furnished with beautiful and correct editions oſ the Greek and Roman authors. Thus the world was not only ſupplied with an inexhauſtible fund of amuſement and inſtruction in theſe ancient writings ; but it is to the ardour which they inſpired, and to the model of elegance which they diſplayed, that the preſent advanced ſtate of literature is in a great meaſure owing.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Henry Stephens,</hi> the firſt of theſe illuſtrious men, was born in France, ſoon after the diſcovery of printing, perhaps about the year 1465. He ſettled as a printer at Paris, and was probably patronized by Louis XII. A great proportion of the books which he publiſhed were Latin : They are printed in the Roman letter, and are not inelegant, though ſome of them abound rather too much in contractions. He died about the year 1520, and left behind him three ſons, Francis, Robert, and Charles.

In his youth he made great proficiency in the Roman, Greek, and Hebrew languages, and at the age of 19 had acquired ſo much knowledge, that his father-in-law entruſted him with the management of his press. An edition of the New Teſtament was published under his inſpection, which gave great offence to the Paris divines, who accuſed him of hereſy, and threatened to prevent the ſale of the book. Soon after he began busineſs himſelf, and married Perrete the daughter of Jodocus Badius, a printer and an author. She was a woman of learning, and underſtood Latin, which indeed was the neceſſary conſequence of her situation. Her husband always entertained a number of learned men as correctors of the prefs : Being foreigners, and of different nations, they made uſe of no other language but Latin ; which Perrete being accuſtomed to hear, was able in a short time not only to underſtand, but even to ſpeak with tolerable eaſe.</p><p>In 1531 he publiſhed his Latin “ Theſaurus ;” a work of great importance, which he laboured at for two years.
