a county of England, bounded on the ſouth by Worceſterſhire, by Cheshire and Derbyſhire on the north, by Warwickſhire and Derbyſhire on the eaſt, and Shropshire and Cheſhire on the well. The length is reckoned 62 miles, the breadth 33, and the circumference 180. It contains 5 hundreds, 150 pariſhes, 810,000 acre's, and 18 market towns. The air, except in thoſe parts that are called the Moorlands and Woodlands, and about the mines, is good, eſpecially upon the hills, where it is accounted<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0728.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0722"/>
very fine. The soil in the northern mountainous parts is not fertile ; but in the middle, where it is watered by the Trent, the third river in England, it is both fruitful and pleaſant, being a mixture of arable and meadow grounds. In the ſouth, it abounds not only with corn, but with mines of iron and pits of coal. The principal rivers of this county, beſides the Trent, which runs almoſt thro’ the middle of it, and abounds with ſalmon, are the Dove and Tame, both of which are well ſtored with fiſh. In this county are alſo a great many lakes, or meres and pools, as they are called ; which, having ſtreams either running into them or from them, cannot be ſuppoſed to be of any great prejudice to the air ; they yield plenty oſ fish. In divers parts of the county are medicinal waters, impregnated with different sorts of minerals, and consequently of different qualities and virtues ; as thoſe at Hints and Breſsford- houſe, which are mixed with bitumen ; thoſe at Ingeſtre, Codſalwood, and Willough-bridge park, which are ſulphureous. Of the ſaline kind are the Brine-pits at Chertley, Epſom, Penſnet-cloſe, of which very good ſalt is made. There is a well at Newcaſtle-under-Line that is ſaid to cure the king’s evil; another called <hi rend="italic">Elder- well</hi> near Blemhill, ſaid to be good for sore eyes ; and a third called the <hi rend="italic">Spa,</hi> near Wolverhampton.</p><p>Great flocks of sheep are bred in this county, eſpecially in the moorlands, or mountains of the northern part of it ; but the wool is ſaid to be ſomewhat coarſer than that of many other counties. Of this wool, however, they make a variety of manufactures, particularly felts. In the low grounds along the rivers are rich paſtures for black cattle ; and vaſt quantities of butter and cheeſe are made. In the middle and ſouthern parts not only grain of all kinds, but a great deal of hemp and flax are raised. This county produces alſo lead, copper, iron ; marble, alabaſter, millſtones, limeſtone ; coal, ſalt, and marks of ſeveral forts and colours; brickearth, fullers earth, and potters-clay<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* See STONE-Wear.</p></note> *, particularly a sort uſed in the glaſs manufacture at Amblecot, and sold at ſeven-pence a buſhel ; tobacco pipe-clay ; a sort of reddiſh earth called <hi rend="italic">flip,</hi> uſed in painting divers vessels; red and yellow ochres ; fire-ſtones for hearths of iron furnaces, ovens, &amp;c. ; iron-ſtones of ſeveral sorts; blood- stones, or haematites, found in the brook Tent, which, when wet a little, will draw red lines like ruddle ; quarry-stones, and grind-stones. For fuel the county is well supplied with turf, peat, and coal of ſeveral forts, as cannel-coal, peacock coal, and pit-coal. The peacockcoal is ſo called, becauſe, when turned to the light, it diſplays all the colours of the peacock’s tail ; but it is fitter for the forge than the kitchen. Of the pit-coal there is an inexhauſtible ſtore : it burns into white ashes, and leaves no ſuch cinder as that of the New- caſtle coal. It is not uſed for malting till it is charred, and in that ſtate it makes admirable winter-fuel for a chamber.</p><p>This county is in the dioceſe of Litchfield and Coventry, and the Oxford circuit. It sends ten members to parliament ; namely, two for the county, two for the city of Litchfield, two for Stafford, two for Newcaſtle-under-Line, and two for Tamworth.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
