Upon the whole, it is a noble and commodious ſtructure; and being plaſtered white, is a uſeful day- mark to all ſhips coming from the ſouthward. The keeper of this light-houſe has a ſalary from the Trinity- houſe at Deptford of 40 1. a-year, with a dwelling-houſe and ground for a garden. His aſſiſtant has 20 1. a-year. It is ſupplied with coals by an annual ſhip; and the carriage of theſe coals from the ſea-ſide to the light-houſe is looked on as a conſiderable benefit to the poor inhabitants. They have a neat little church, built by the Godolphin family. There are at preſent 50 houſeholds in the iſland, which yield the proprietor 40 1. a-year.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Brehar,</hi> or, as pronounced, <hi rend="italic">Bryer iſland,</hi> lies north- weſt of St Mary’s, and to the weſt of Treſcaw, to which, when the ſea is very low, they ſometimes paſs over the ſand. It is very mountainous, abounds with ſea and land fowls, excellent ſamphire, and a great variety of medical herbs. There are at preſent thirteen families, who have a pretty church, and pay 301. a-year to the proprietor.</p><p>South from hence, and weſt from Treſcaw, ſtands the iſland of <hi rend="italic">Samſon,</hi> in which there is not above one family, who ſubſiſt chiefly by the making of kelp. To the weſtward of theſe there lie four iſlands, which contain in the whole 360 acres of meadow and arable land. The <hi rend="italic">eastern isles,</hi> ſo denominated from their poſition in reſpect to St Mary’s, contain 123 acres; and there are alſo ſeven other rocky and ſcattered ſlands, that have each a little land of ſome uſe; and beſides theſe, innumerable rocks on every ſide, among which we muſt reckon <hi rend="italic">Sally,</hi> now nothing more than a large, ill-ſhaped, craggy, inacceſſible iſland, lying the fartheſt north-weſt of any of them, and consequently the neareſt to the continent.</p><p>The air of theſe iſlands is equally mild and pure; their winters are ſeldom ſubject to froſt or ſnow. When the former happens, it laſts not long; and the latter never lies upon the ground. The heat of their ſummers is much abated by ſea-breezes. They are indeed frequently incommoded by ſea fogs, but theſe are not unwholeſome. Agues are rare, and fevers more ſo. The moſt fatal diſtemper is the ſmall-pox; yet thoſe who live temperately ſurvive commonly to a great age, and are remarkably free from diſeaſes. The  ſoil is very good, and produces grain of all ſorts (except wheat, of which they had anciently plenty) in large quantities. They ſtill grow a little wheat, but the bread made of it is unpleaſant. They eat, for this reaſon, chiefly what is made of barley; and of this they have ſuch abundance, that though they uſe it both for bread and beer, they have more than ſuffices for their own conſumption. The uſe of potatoes is a new improvement; and they proſper to ſuch a degree, that in ſome places there are two crops in a-year. Roots of all ſorts, pulſe, and ſalads, grow well; dwarf fruit-trees, gooſe- berries, currants, raſpberries, and every thing of that kind, under proper ſhelter, thrive exceedingly; but they have no trees, though formerly they had elder; and porthelik, i. e. the harbour of willows, proves they  had theſe likewiſe; and with a little care, no doubt, great improvements might be made. The ranunculus, anemone, and moſt kinds of flowers, are ſucceſsfully  cultivated in their gardens. They have wild fowl of all</p><p>ſorts, from the ſwan to the ſnipe; and a particular kind called the <hi rend="italic">hedge chicken,</hi> which is not inferior to the ortolan: alſo tame fowl, puffins, and rabbits, in great numbers. Their black cattle are generally ſmall, but very well taſtled, though they feed upon ore-weed. Their horſes are little, but ſtrong and lively. They have alſo large flocks of fine ſheep, whoſe fleeces are tolerably good and their fleſh excellent. There are no venomous creatures in theſe iſlands.</p><p>We muſt now paſs to the ſea, which is of more conſequence to theſe isles than that ſmall portion of land which is diſtributed amongſt them. St Mary’s harbour is very ſafe and capacious, having that iſland on the ſouth; the eaſtern iſlands, with that of St Martin, on the eaſt; Treſcaw, Brehar, and Samſon, to the north; St Agnes and ſeveral ſmall iſlands to the weſt. Ships ride here in three to five fathom water, with good anchorage. Into this harbour there are four inlets, viz. Broad Sound, Smith’s Sound, St Mary’s Sound, and Crow Sound: ſo that hardly any wind can blow with which a ſhip of 150 tons cannot ſafely ſail through one or other of them, Crow Sound only excepted, where they cannot paſs at low water, but at high there is from 16 to 24 feet in this paſſage. Beſides theſe there are two other harbours; one called <hi rend="italic">New Grynſey,</hi> which lies between Brehar and Treſcaw, where ſhips of 300 tons may ride ſecurely. The other is called <hi rend="italic">Old Grynſey,</hi> and lies between Treſcaw, St Helen’s, and Theon, for ſmaller ſhips. The former is guarded by the batteries at Oliver’s Caſtle; the latter by the Blockhouſe, on the eaſtern ſide of Treſcaw, called <hi rend="italic">Dover.</hi> Small coaſters bound to the northward have more convenient outlets from theſe little harbours than from St Mary’s, where, at the weſt end of Hugh Town, there is a fine pier built by the preſent earl of Godolphin, 430 feet long, 20 feet wide in the narroweſt part, and 23 feet in height, with 16 feet of water at a ſpring, and 10 at a neap tide; ſo that under the ſhelter of this pier, veſſels of 150 tons may lie ſecurely, not only cloſe to the quay, but all along the ſtrand of the town.</p><p>In this harbour, and in all the little coves of the ſeveral iſles, prodigious quantities of mackerel may be caught in their ſeaſon; alſo ſoal, turbot, and plaiſe, remarkably good in their kind; and ling, which from its being a thicker fiſh, mellower, and better fed, is very juſtly preferred to any caught nearer our own coaſts. Salmon, cod, pollock, are in great plenty, and pilchards in vaſt abundance. To theſe we may add the alga marina, fucus, or ore-weed, which ſerves to feed both their ſmall and great cattle, manures their lands, is burned into kelp, is of uſe in phyſic, is ſometimes preſerved, ſometimes pickled, and is in many other reſpects very beneficial to the inhabitants, of whom we are next to ſpeak.</p><p>The people of Scilly in general are robuſt, handſome, active, hardy, induſtimus, generous, and good- natured; ſpeak the Engliſh language with great propriety; have ſtrong natural parts (though for want of a good ſchool they have little education), as appears by their dexterity in the ſeveral employments to which they are bred. They cultivate moſt of their lands as well as can be expected under their preſent circumſtances. They are bred from their infancy to the management of their boats, in which they excel; are good</p></body></text></TEI>
