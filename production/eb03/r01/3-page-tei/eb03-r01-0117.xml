There are 11 ſpecies ; of which the moſt remarkable is the hιteola or common dyer’s weed, growing naturally in waſte places in many parts of Britain. The young leaves are often undulated ; the ſtalk is a-yard high, or more, terminated with along naked ſpike of yellowiſh-green flowers : the plant is cultivated and much uied for dying lilk and wool of a yellow colour. The great recommendation of the plant is, that it will grow with very little trouble, without dung, and on the very worſt foils. For this reaſon it is commonly ſown with, or immediately after, barley or oats, without any additional care, except drawing a buſh over it to harrow it in. The reaping of the corn does it little or no hurt, as it grows but little the firſt year ; and the next ſummer it is pulled and dried like flax. Much care and nicety, however, is requiiite, ſo as not to injure either the feed or ſtalk; or, which ſometimes happens, damaging both, by letting it ſtand too long, or pulling it too green. To avoid theſe inconveniences, a better method of culture has been deviſed. This new method is to plough and harrow the ground very fine,, without dung, as equally as poſſible, and then ſowing about a gallon of ſeed, which is very ſmall, upon an acre, ſome time in the month of Auguſt. In about two months it vzill be high enough to hoe, which muſt be carefully done, and the plants left about fix inches aſunder. Tn March it is to be hoed again, and this labour is to be repeated a third time in May. About the cloſe of June, when the flower is in full vigour, and the ſtalk is become of a greeniſh-yellow, it ſhould be pulled ; a ſufficient quantity of ſtems being left growing for ſeed till September. By this, means the flower and ſtalk, both of them being carefully dried, will lell at a good price to tlie dyers, who employ it conſtantly, and in large quantities ; add to this, tirat the ſeed being ripe and in perfect order, will yield a very confiderable profit. In a tolerable year, when the ſeaſons have not been unfavourable, the advantages derived from this vegetable will anſwer very well ; but if the ſummer ſhould be remarkably fine, and proper care is taken in getting it in, there will be a very large produce upon an acre. The crop being, as has been ſhown, ſo early removed, the ground may be conveniently prepared for growing wheat the next year. Upon the whole, weld is in its nature a very valuable commodity in many reſpects, as it ſerves e-qually for woollen, linen, or filk ; dyeing not only a rich and laſting yellow, but alſo, properly managed, all the different ſhades of yellow with brightneſs and beauty ; and if theſe be previouſly dipped blue, they are by the weld changed into a very pleafing green, which our artiſts can alſo diverfify into a great variety of ſhades.</p><p>RESEMBLANCE, ««//Dissimilitude, the rela-tions of likeneſs and difference among objects. See Comparison.</p><p>The connection that man hath with the beings around him, requires ſome acquaintance with their nature, their powers, and their qualities, for regulating his conduct. For acquiring a branch of knowledge ſo effential to our well-being, motives alone of reaſon and intereſt are not ſuſſicient : nature hath providentially ſuperadded curio-ſity, a vigorous propenſity, which never is at reſt. This propenfity alone attaches ns to every new object -j- ; and incites us to compare objects, in order to difcover their differences and reſemblances.</p><p>Reſemblance among objects of the ſame kind, and diſſimilitude among objects of different kinds, are too obvious and familiar to gratify our curiofity in any de-gree : its· gratification lies in diſcovering differences among things where reſemblance prevails, and reſem-blances where difference prevails. Thus a difference, in individuals of the ſame kind of plants or animals, is deemed a diſcovery, while the many particulars in which they agree are neglected ; and in different kinds, any reſemblance is greedily remarked, without attending to the many particulars in which they differ,.</p><p>A compariſon of the former neither tends to gratify our curiofity, nor to ſct the objects compared in a ſtronger light : two apartments in. a palace, fimilar in ſhape, fize, and furniture, make feparately as good a figure as when compared ; and the lame obſervation is applicable to, two fimilar compartments in a garden ; on the other hand, oppoſe a regular building to a fall of water, or a good picture to.a towering hill, or even a little dog to a large horſe, and the contraſt will produce no effect. But a reſemblance between objects of different kinds, and a difference between objects of' the ſame kind, have remarkably an enlivening effect. Thc poets, filch of them as have a juft taſte, draw all their ſtmilies from things that in the main differ widely from the principal ſubject ; and they never attempt a contraſt, but where the things have a common ge-nus, and a reſemblance in the capital circumſtances : place together a large and a ſmall-ſized animal of the fame ſpecies, the one will appear greater, the other leſs, than when viewed feparately : when we oppoſe beauty to deformity, each makes a greater figure by the compariſon. λVe compare the drefs of different nations with curiofity, but without ſurpriſe becauſe, they have no ſuch refemblance in · the capital'parts as to pleaſe us. by contraſting the fmaller parts. But a new cut of a ∩eeve, or of a pocket, enchants by its novelty ; and, in oppoſition to the former faſhion, raiſes ſome degree of ſurpriſe.</p><p>That reſemblance and diſſimilitude have an enliven-</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
