<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Woodhouselee, Robertson, Home, Ferguson, and Dugald Stewart were resident in Edinburgh, and they were all,&nbsp;along with a host of others less celebrated, immortalized&nbsp;on the painter’s canvas. Of his fully matured manner we&nbsp;could have no finer examples than his own portrait and&nbsp;that of the Rev. Sir Henry Moncreiff Wellwood, the bust&nbsp;of Dr Wardrop of Torbane Hill, the two full-lengths of&nbsp;Adam Rolland of Gask and that of William Macdonald&nbsp;of St Martin’s. It was commonly believed that Raeburn&nbsp;was less successful in his female than in his male portraits,&nbsp;but the exquisite full-length of his wife, the smaller likeness of Mrs R. Scott Moncrieff in the Scottish National&nbsp;Gallery, and that of Mrs Robert Bell are sufficient to&nbsp;prove that he could on occasion portray all the grace and&nbsp;beauty of the gentler sex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Raeburn spent his life in Edinburgh, rarely visiting the metropolis, and then only for brief periods, thus preserving&nbsp;his own sturdy individuality, if he missed the opportunity&nbsp;of engrafting on it some of the fuller refinement and&nbsp;delicacy of the London portraitists. His leisure was employed in athletic sports, in his garden, and in architectural&nbsp;and mechanical pursuits, and so varied were the interests&nbsp;that filled his life that his sitters used to say of him, “You&nbsp;would never take him for a painter till he seizes the&nbsp;brush and palette.” Professional honours fell thick upon&nbsp;him. In 1812 he was elected president of the Society of&nbsp;Artists in Edinburgh, in 1814 associate, and in the following&nbsp;year full member of the Royal Academy. In 1822 he&nbsp;was knighted by George IV. and appointed His Majesty’s&nbsp;limner for Scotland. He died at Edinburgh on the 8th&nbsp;of July 1823.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In his own day the portraits of Raeburn were excellently and voluminously engraved, especially by the last members of the&nbsp;great school of English mezzotint. In 1876 a collection of over&nbsp;300 of his works was brought together in the Royal Scottish&nbsp;Academy galleries ; in the following year a series of twelve of his&nbsp;iinest portraits was included in the winter exhibition of the Royal&nbsp;Academy, London ; and a volume of photographs from his paintings&nbsp;has been edited by Dr John Brown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Raeburn possessed all the necessary requirements of a popular and successful portrait-painter. He had the power of producing&nbsp;a telling and forcible likeness ; his productions are distinguished&nbsp;by breadth of effect, by admirable force of handling, by execution&nbsp;of the swiftest and most resolute sort. Wilkie has recorded that,&nbsp;while travelling in Spain and studying the works of Velazquez,&nbsp;the brash-work of that master reminded him constantly of the&nbsp;“square touch” of Raeburn. But the portraits of Velazquez are&nbsp;unsurpassable examples of tone as well as of handling, and it is&nbsp;in the former quality that Raeburn is distinctly wanting. The&nbsp;colour of his portraits is sometimes crude and out of relation,&nbsp;inclining to the use of positive and definite local pigments, and too&nbsp;little perceptive of the changeful subtilties and modifications of&nbsp;atmospheric effect. His draperies frequently consist of little more&nbsp;than two colours—the local hue of the fabric and the black which,&nbsp;more or less graduated, expresses its shadows and modelling. In&nbsp;his flesh, too, he wants—in all but his very best productions—&nbsp;the delicate refinements of colouring which distinguish the works&nbsp;of the great English portrait-painters. His faces, with all their&nbsp;excellent truth of form and splendid vigour of handling, are often&nbsp;hard and bricky in hue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAFF, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Joseph Joachim </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1822-1882), composer and orchestral conductor, was born near Zurich on 27th May&nbsp;1822 and educated chiefly at Schwyz. Here, under the&nbsp;care of the Jesuit fathers, he soon became an excellent&nbsp;classical and mathematical scholar, but received scarcely&nbsp;any instruction in his favourite art, in which, nevertheless,&nbsp;he made extraordinary progress through sheer force of&nbsp;natural genius, developed by persevering study which no&nbsp;external obstacles could induce him to discontinue. So&nbsp;successful were his unaided efforts that, when in 1843 he&nbsp;sent some MSS. to Mendelssohn, that warm encourager of&nbsp;youthful talent felt justified in at once recommending him&nbsp;to Breitkopf &amp; Hartel of Leipsic, who published a large&nbsp;selection of his early works. Soon after this he became&nbsp;acquainted with Liszt, who gave him much generous</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">encouragement. He first became personally acquainted with Mendelssohn at Cologne in 1846, and gave up all&nbsp;his other engagements for the purpose of following him&nbsp;to Leipsic, but his intention was frustrated by the great&nbsp;composer’s death in 1847. After this cruel disappointment he remained for some time at Cologne, where his&nbsp;attention was alternately devoted to composition and to&nbsp;the ¡)reparation of critiques for the well-known periodical&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cacilia.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Thus far he must be regarded as, in every sense&nbsp;of the word, a self-taught artist ; but he felt the need of&nbsp;systematic instruction so deeply that, retiring for a time&nbsp;from public life, he entered at Stuttgart upon a long&nbsp;course of severe and uninterrupted study, and with so&nbsp;great success that in 1850 he appeared before the world&nbsp;in the character of an accomplished and highly-cultivated&nbsp;musician. Raff now settled for a time in Weimar in&nbsp;order to be near Liszt. Hans von Biilow had already&nbsp;brought him into notice by playing his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Concertstiick</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> for&nbsp;pianoforte and orchestra in public, and the favour with&nbsp;which this fine work was everywhere received encouraged&nbsp;him to attempt a greater one. During his stay in Stuttgart he had begun the composition of an opera entitled&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">K'&amp;nig Alfred</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, and had good hope of securing its performance at Dresden; but the political troubles with which&nbsp;Germany was then overwhelmed rendered its production in&nbsp;the Saxon capital impossible. At Weimar he was more&nbsp;fortunate. In due time </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">K'&amp;nig Alfred</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> was produced there&nbsp;under Liszt’s able direction with complete success ; it is&nbsp;still frequently performed at the court theatre, as is also&nbsp;his second opera, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dame Kobold</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, written for the same&nbsp;theatre in 1870. His third opera, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Samson</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, has not yet,&nbsp;we believe, been publicly represented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Raff remained at Weimar until 1856, when he obtained a large </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">clientèle</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> at Wiesbaden as a teacher of the pianoforte.&nbsp;In 1859 he married Doris Genast, an actress of high repute,&nbsp;and thenceforward devoted himself with renewed energy&nbsp;to the work of composition, displaying an inexhaustible&nbsp;fertility of invention tempered by an amount of technical&nbsp;skill which stamped even his lightest works with the&nbsp;dignity to which the union of natural talent with high&nbsp;artistic cultivation can alone give birth. He resided&nbsp;chiefly at Wiesbaden till 1877, when he was appointed&nbsp;director of the Hoch-Conservatorium at Frankfort, an&nbsp;office which he retained until his death, 25th June 1882.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Raff’s compositions are almost innumerable. More than 200 have been published, including ten symphonies—undoubtedly his&nbsp;finest works—quartets, concertos, sonatas, songs, and examples of&nbsp;nearly every known variety of style ; yet he never repeats himself.&nbsp;Notwithstanding his strong love for the- romantic school, he is&nbsp;never guilty of extravagance, and, if in his minor works he is&nbsp;sometimes a little commonplace, he never descends to vulgarity.&nbsp;His symphonies </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lenore</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Im Walde</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> are truly wonderful examples&nbsp;of musical painting, and replete with poetry in every bar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAFFLES, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Sir Thomas Stamford </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1781-1826), the son of a captain in the West India trade, was born at sea&nbsp;off the coast of Jamaica on 5tli July 1781. Returning&nbsp;with his mother to England, he was placed in a boarding-school at Hammersmith, where he remained till the&nbsp;age of fourteen, when he entered the East India House as&nbsp;an extra clerk. While employed there he occupied his&nbsp;leisure hours in particularly studying languages, for which&nbsp;he possessed great facility. In 1805 the directors of the&nbsp;India House having resolved to found a new trading&nbsp;settlement at Penang, Raffles was appointed assistant-secretary, and on his voyage out he acquired the Malay&nbsp;language. Owing to the illness of the chief secretary,&nbsp;he soon had to undertake the entire administrative labour&nbsp;of the new government. In 1808 he had to visit Malacca&nbsp;to recruit his shattered strength ; here he enjoyed large&nbsp;opportunity of mingling with a very varied population,&nbsp;and, in company with the two Orientalists Marsden and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
