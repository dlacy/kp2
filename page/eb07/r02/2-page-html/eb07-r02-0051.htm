<p><span class="font0">of the World at the Appearance of Jesus Christ.” The ingenuity with which a multiplicity of detached circumstances are there collected, and shown to tend to one single point,&nbsp;afforded a fair promise of those peculiar powers which he so&nbsp;conspicuously displayed in his historical works. This sermon, which was immediately published, did great honour&nbsp;to the author ; and it is probably to the reputation which&nbsp;he thus acquired, that we are to attribute the unanimity&nbsp;with which he was called to be one of the ministers of&nbsp;Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1759, he published, in two volumes quarto, “ The History of Scotland during the reigns of Queen Mary, and of King James VI. till his accession to the Crown of England,&nbsp;with a Review of the Scots History previous to that period.”&nbsp;This work, in its structure, is one of the most complete of&nbsp;all modern histories. It is not a dry jejune narrative of&nbsp;events, destitute of ornament ; nor is it a mere frothy relation, all glow and colouring. The historian discovers&nbsp;sufficient powers of imagination to engage the reader’s attention, with a due proportion of judgment to check the&nbsp;exuberance of fancy. The arrangement of his work is admirable, and his descriptions are animated. His style is&nbsp;copious, nervous, and correct. He has displayed consummate skill in rendering such passages of our history as are&nbsp;familiar to our recollection agreeable and entertaining. He&nbsp;has embellished old materials with all the elegance of modern dress. He has very judiciously avoided too circumstantial a detail of trite facts. His narratives are succinct&nbsp;and spirited ; his reflections copious, frequent, and generally pertinent. His sentiments respecting the guilt of Mary&nbsp;have indeed been warmly controverted by Tytler, Stuart,&nbsp;and Whitaker ; and, till the publication of Mr Laing’s&nbsp;Dissertation on the same subject, the general opinion&nbsp;seemed to be that their victory was complete. Dr Robertson was no rancorous or malignant enemy of the unfortunate queen. While relating what he doubtless believed,&nbsp;he makes every possible allowance for Mary from the circumstances in which she was placed ; and his history will&nbsp;be read with pleasure by candid men of all parties as long&nbsp;as the language in which it is composed shall continue to&nbsp;be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1769, Dr Robertson published, in three volumes quarto, “ The History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V. with&nbsp;a View of the Progress of Society in Europe from the Subversion of the Roman Empire to the beginning of the sixteenth century.” The vast and general importance of the&nbsp;period which this history comprises, together with the reputation which the historian had deservedly acquired, cooperated to raise such high expectations in the public, that&nbsp;no work perhaps was ever more impatiently expected, or&nbsp;perused with greater avidity. The first volume, which&nbsp;contains an able and eloquent view of the progress of society, is a very valuable part of the work ; for it serves not&nbsp;only as a key to the pages that follow, but may be considered as a general introduction to the stu&lt;ly of the history of&nbsp;that period, in which the several powers of Europe were&nbsp;formed into one great political system, in which each took&nbsp;a station, in which it long remained, with less alterations&nbsp;than could have been expected, after the shocks occasioned&nbsp;by so many internal revolutions and so many foreign wars.&nbsp;Of the history itself, it may be sufficient to observe, that it&nbsp;has secured to the author a place among the greatest historians of modern times. It is distinguished by elegance of&nbsp;expression, depth of discernment, and correctness of judgment. The characters are drawn with singular skill. They&nbsp;are not contrasted by a studied antithesis, but by an opposition which results from a very acute and penetrating insight into the real merits of each character, fairly deduced&nbsp;from the several circumstances of his conduct exemplified&nbsp;in the history. For this work the author received L.4500&nbsp;sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1779, Dr Robertson published “ The History of America,” in two volumes quarto. This celebrated work may with great propriety be considered as a sequel to the preceding history. From the close of the fifteenth century we&nbsp;date the most splendid era in the annals of modern times.&nbsp;Discoveries were then made, the influence of which descended to posterity ; and events happened that gave a&nbsp;new direction to the spirit of nations. To the inhabitants&nbsp;of Europe, America was in every respect a new world.&nbsp;There the face of the earth changed its appearance. The&nbsp;plants and trees and animals were strange, and nature&nbsp;seemed no longer the same. A continent opened that appeared to have recently come from the hands of the Creator, and which showed lakes, rivers, and mountains on a&nbsp;grander scale, and the vegetable kingdom in greater magnificence, than in the other quarters of the globe, but the&nbsp;animal tribes in a state of degradation, few in number, degenerated in kind, imperfect, and unfinished. The human&nbsp;species in the earliest stage of its progress, vast and numerous nations in the rudest form of the savage state which&nbsp;philosophers have contemplated, and tw<sup>,</sup>o great empires in&nbsp;the lowest degree of civilization which any records have&nbsp;transmitted to our review, presented to the philosophic eye&nbsp;at this period the most fruitful subject of speculation that&nbsp;was to be found in the annals of history. The discovery of&nbsp;the New World, moreover, was not only a curious spectacle&nbsp;to the philosopher, but, by the change which it effected, an&nbsp;interesting spectacle to the human race. When Columbus&nbsp;set sail for unknown lands, he little expected that he was&nbsp;to make a revolution in the system of human affairs, and&nbsp;to influence the future destiny of Europe. The importance&nbsp;and celebrity therefore of the subject bad attracted the attention of philosophers and historians. Views and sketches&nbsp;of the New World had been given by able writers, and&nbsp;splendid portions of the American story had been adorned&nbsp;with all the beauties of eloquence. But previously to the&nbsp;appearance of Dr Robertson’s history, no author had bestowed the mature and profound investigation which such&nbsp;a subject required, or had exhibited that complete narration and perfect whole which it is the province of the historian to transmit to posterity. And as the subject upon&nbsp;which the author entered was grand, his execution was&nbsp;masterly. The character of his former works was immediately discerned in this. They had been read with uncommon admiration. When the History of Scotland was&nbsp;first published, and the author altogether unknown, Lord&nbsp;Chesterfield pronounced it to be equal in eloquence and&nbsp;beauty to the production of Livy, the purest and most classical of all the Roman historians. His literary reputation&nbsp;w as not confined to his own country : the testimony of Europe was soon added to the voice of Britain. It may indeed be mentioned, as the characteristic quality of the author’s manner, that he possessed in no common degree that&nbsp;supported elevation which is suitable to compositions of&nbsp;the higher class ; and in his History of America he displayed that happy union of strength and grace which becomes the majesty of the historic muse. In the fourth book&nbsp;of his first volume, which contains a description of America&nbsp;when first discovered, and a philosophical inquiry into the&nbsp;manners and policy of its ancient inhabitants, he displays&nbsp;moreover so much patient investigation and sound philosophy, abounds in such beautiful or interesting description,&nbsp;and exhibits such variety and copiousness of elegant writing,&nbsp;that future times will probably refer to it as that part of his&nbsp;works which gives the best idea of his genius, and is the&nbsp;most finished of all his productions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1787 appeared a translation of Clavigero’s History of Mexico ; in which work the author hazarded various reflections, tending in several instances to impeach the credit&nbsp;of Dr Robertson’s History of America. This attack induced the learned historian to revise his work, and to in-</span></p>
