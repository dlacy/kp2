<p><span class="font1">Obſerve farther, that if the whole figure be inverted, and ſtrings be ſubſtituted for props, and props for&nbsp;ſtrings, the equilibrium will ſtill obtain : for by comparing fig. </span><span class="font2">5. </span><span class="font1">with fig. 6. we ſee that the vertical line&nbsp;through the centre of gravity will paſe through the in-terſection of the two ſtrings or props.; and this is all&nbsp;that is lſeceſſary for the equilibrium : only it muſt be&nbsp;obſerved in the ſubſtſtution of props for threads, and&nbsp;of threads for props, that </span><span class="font2">it </span><span class="font1">it be done without inverting the whole figure, a ſtable equilibrium becomes a&nbsp;tottering one, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vice verſa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is a moſt uſeſul propoſition, eſpecially to the unlettered artiſan, and enables him to make a practical life of problems which the greateſt mechanical geniuſes&nbsp;have found no eaſy taſk to ſolve. An inſtance will&nbsp; ſhow the extent and utility of it. Suppoſe it were required to make a manſard or kirb roof whoſe width is&nbsp;AB (fig. 7.), and conſiſting of the four equal rafters&nbsp;AC, CD, DE, EB. There can be no doubt but that&nbsp;its beſt form is that which will put all the parts in equilibrio, ſo that no ties or ſtays may be neceſſary for oppoſing the unbalanced thruſt of any part of it. Make&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">chain </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a c d e b</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 8.) of four equal pieces, looſely&nbsp;connected by pin-joints, round which the parts are perfectly moveable. Suſpend this from two pins </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a, b,</span><span class="font1"> fixed in a horizontal line. This chain or feſtoon will arrange itſelf in ſuch a form that its parts are in equilibrio.

If the proportion of the height </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d f</span><span class="font1"> to the width </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a, b</span><span class="font1"> is not ſuch as&nbsp;pleaſes, let the pins </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1"> be placed nearer or more diſtant, till a proportion between the width and height is&nbsp;obtained which pleaſes, and then make the figure&nbsp;ACDEB fig. 7. ſimilar to it. It is evident that this&nbsp;propoſition will apply in the ſame manner to the determination of the form of an arch of a bridge ; but this is&nbsp;not a proper place for a farther diſcuſſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are now able to compute all the thruſts and other preſſures which are exerted by the parts of a roof on&nbsp;each other and on the walls.

<p><span class="font1">It cannot be diſputed that, if ſtrength alone be conſidered, the proper form of a roof is that which puts the whole in equilibrio, ſo that it would remain in that&nbsp;ſhape although all the joints were perfectly looſe or&nbsp;flexible. If it has any other ſhape, additional ties or&nbsp;braces are neceſſary for preſerving it, and the parts are&nbsp;unneceſſarily ſtrained. When this equilibrium is obtained, the rafters which compoſe the roof are all acting&nbsp;on each other in the direction of their lengths ; and by&nbsp;this action, combined with their weights, they ſuſtain&nbsp;no ſtrain but that of compreſſion, the ſtrain of all others&nbsp;that they are the moſt able to reſiſt. We may conſider&nbsp;them as ſo many inflexible lines having their weights&nbsp;accumulated in their centres of gravity. But it will allow an eaſier inveſtigation of the ſubject, if we ſuppoſe&nbsp;the weights to be at the joints, equal to the real vertical preſſures which are exerted on theſe points. Theſe&nbsp;are very easily computed: for it is plain, that the weight&nbsp;of the beam AB (fig. 9.) is to the part of this weight&nbsp;that is ſupported at B as AB to AG. Therefore, if&nbsp;W repreſent the weight of the beam, the vertical preſ-</span></p>
