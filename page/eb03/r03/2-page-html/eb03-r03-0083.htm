They are rounded at their baſe, where'they&nbsp;-are ſlightly indented, but end in acute points. From&nbsp;the joints of the ſtalks come out alternately long foot-ſtalks, which ſuſtain the ſpikes of flowers, which grow&nbsp;in ſmall whorls round the ſtalks, at about an inch diftant.</span></p>

He gave proofs of his bravery at the age&nbsp;of T 3 ; and in 1642 came over into England, and offered his ſervice to king Charles I. his uncle, who gave&nbsp;him a command in his army. At Edgehiſl he charged&nbsp;with incredible bravery, and made a great ſlaugſhter of&nbsp;the parliamentarians. In 1643 he ſeized the town of&nbsp;Cirenceiter ; obliged the governor of Litchfield to flirrender ; and having joined his brother prince Maurice,&nbsp;reduced Briſtol in three days, and paffed to the relief&nbsp;of Newark. In 1644 he marched to relieve York,&nbsp;wſhere he gave the parliamentarians battle, arſd entirely&nbsp;defeated their right wing ; but Cromwell charged the&nbsp;marquis of Newcaſtle with ſuch an irreſiſtible force,&nbsp;that prince Rupert was entirely defeated. Atter this&nbsp;the prince put himſelf into Briſtol, which furrendered&nbsp;to Fairfax after a gallant refiſtance. The king was ſo&nbsp;enraged at the lofs of this city, ſo contrary to his expectation, that he recalled all prince Rupert’s commrſ-ſions, and ſent him a paſs to go out of the kingom In&nbsp;1648 he went to France, was highly complimented by&nbsp;that court, and kindly received by king Charles II.&nbsp;who ſojourned there for the time.
