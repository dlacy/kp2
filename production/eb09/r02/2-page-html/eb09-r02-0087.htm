<p><span class="font1">History.—The numerous poetical legends current among the Greeks with respect to Rhodes bear testimony to the importance&nbsp;which it attained in very early times. Of these the most familiar&nbsp;is that celebrated by Pindar in one of the most beautiful of his&nbsp;odes (Ok vii.), according to which the island was raised from the&nbsp;depths of the sea by Helios, the god of the sun, who always continued to be its tutelary deity, and whose image is found upon all&nbsp;its coins. The poet as usual derives its name from a nymph&nbsp;Rhoda, but there is no doubt that it was really derived from&nbsp;f&gt;6Sοv, a rose, the symbol that invariably accompanies the head of&nbsp;Helios on its coins. Another set of legends connected it with the&nbsp;Telchines, a mythical people celebrated for their skill as workers&nbsp;in bronze and other metals, while another version of the same tale&nbsp;represented these Telchines as themselves expelled by the Heliadæ,&nbsp;who became the first introducers of civilization. It is not&nbsp;improbable that both traditions had some reference to the&nbsp;Phoenicians, who may well have been the first to establish settlements in an island that lay so directly on their way to the Ægean.&nbsp;But the first record that can claim anything like an historical&nbsp;character is that of the occupation of the island by a body of Doric&nbsp;emigrants from the Peloponnesus, who founded the three cities of&nbsp;Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus, which long continued to divide the&nbsp;island among them, and together with those of Cos, Cnidus, and&nbsp;Halicarnassus formed the Doric Hexapolis or league of six cities.&nbsp;These cities, like the more important Ionic confederacy, had a&nbsp;common sanctuary on the Triopian Promontory near Cnidus, but&nbsp;they do not appear to have formed a political union, though the&nbsp;distinct predominance in them all of the Doric element would&nbsp;naturally lead to a community of interest as well as of feeling.&nbsp;Nothing is known of their history for several centuries, during&nbsp;which they appear to have developed a remarkable amount of maritime power and enterprise, and became the founders of numerous&nbsp;colonies in distant parts of the Mediterranean, including Gela in&nbsp;Sicily, as well as Rhoda on the coast of Spain, and Salapia on the&nbsp;Adriatic coast of Italy. Towards the east also they were the recognized founders of Corydallaand Phaselis in Lyciaand Soli in Cilicia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Notwithstanding these evidences of early prosperity and power, we meet with very scanty notices of the Rhodian cities in the first</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">E</span><span class="font1">eriod of Greek history. After the Persian War they appear to ave passed into the condition of tributaries to Athens, and were&nbsp;compelled as such to join in the Athenian expedition to Sicily, but&nbsp;in 412 B.C. they deserted the Athenian cause and joined that of the&nbsp;Peloponnesians. It was shortly after this (in 408) that they adopted&nbsp;a resolution which became the foundation of their future greatness,&nbsp;the inhabitants of the three cities having agreed to abandon their&nbsp;homes and found a new city on the site which has ever since continued to be the capital of the island.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The architect was Hippodamus of Miletus, who had planned and embellished the Piræus at Athens ; and the new city soon became&nbsp;one of the most splendid in the world, adorned with magnificent&nbsp;buildings and exquisite works of art. When Conon and his fleet&nbsp;restored the Athenian power by his victory off Cnidus (394 B.c.),&nbsp;Rhodes again embraced the victorious cause ; but her fidelity during&nbsp;the subsequent contests was not very great. Sparta afterwards&nbsp;received the allegiance of the island ; and in the Social War (357-5)&nbsp;it joined the alliance against Athens, and, with the assistance of&nbsp;the Carian monarch Mausolus, succeeded in achieving independence. But, finding the power of that king dangerous to their&nbsp;liberties, the Rhodians once more sued for the Athenian protection,&nbsp;which they obtained through the eloquence of Demosthenes. But&nbsp;neither they nor the rest of Greece could resist the overwhelming&nbsp;power of Macedonia, though Memnon, a Rhodian, was one of the&nbsp;ablest generals under the last Persian king, and attempted to check&nbsp;the career of Alexander. Rhodes received a Macedonian garrison ;&nbsp;but it was expelled after the death of Alexander, and a resolute&nbsp;resistance was begun to the Macedonian power. This formed one&nbsp;of the most illustrious periods in the history of the island. The&nbsp;capital was besieged in 304 b. c. by Demetrius Poliorcetes, with a&nbsp;large army and a complete train of the artillery of that age.&nbsp;Although a breach was effected in the walls, the desperate valour&nbsp;of the defenders foiled all the attempts to carry it by assault, and&nbsp;cost the besiegers the lives of some of their generals and a great&nbsp;number of their soldiers. This heroic resistance obtained for the&nbsp;Rhodians great renown ; and the period which followed was one of&nbsp;the most brilliant in the history of the city. They enjoyed the&nbsp;friendship of Rome, and obtained possession of some of the adjacent&nbsp;islands and coasts, including a considerable district on the mainland which was known as the Rhodian I’eræa. For arts as well as&nbsp;arms the island was then renowned ; the Rhodian laws, especially&nbsp;on maritime affairs, were reckoned the best in antiquity, and&nbsp;many of them adopted into the Roman code. Æscliines, who had&nbsp;contended in eloquence with the greatest of orators, opened a&nbsp;school of rhetoric here, which became the parent of a new school of&nbsp;oratory, regarded by the ancients as possessing a Græco-Asiatic&nbsp;character. Protogenes embellished the city λvith his paintings,&nbsp;and Chares of Lindus with the celebrated colossal statue. The&nbsp;Colossus, erroneously supposed to have occupied a position striding&nbsp;over the entrance to the harbour, stood for fifty-six years, till an&nbsp;earthquake prostrated it in 224 b.c. Its enormous fragments continued to excite wonder in the time of Pliny, and were not removed&nbsp;till 656 A.n., when Rhodes was conquered by the Saracens, who sold&nbsp;the remains for old metal to a dealer who employed nine hundred&nbsp;camels to carry them away. Besides this not less than three&nbsp;thousand statues are said to have adorned the city, which was said&nbsp;by Strabo to surpass all others in beauty and ornamental character.&nbsp;Being the sovereigns of the seas, the Rhodians by their fleets rendered good service to Rome, with w<sup>,</sup>hom they were in alliance, and&nbsp;retained their independence for a long time. The severest blow&nbsp;they suffered was from Cassius in 42 B.c., who plundered the island&nbsp;even to the bare temple walls in the nominal cause of liberty, for it&nbsp;had embraced the side of Cæsar. Under the empire the liberty of&nbsp;Rhodes was repeatedly permitted and withdrawn according to the&nbsp;caprice of the sovereign ; but ultimately it became a part of the&nbsp;Roman empire, and, after its partition, of the Eastern, till 616&nbsp;a.d., when Chosroes the Persian obtained possession of it for a&nbsp;short time. It was subsequently conquered by Moawiyah, one&nbsp;of Othman’s generals ; but, recovered by the Byzantine empire, it&nbsp;proved the last of their Asiatic possessions that succumbed to the&nbsp;infidel. In 1308 it was granted by the emperor Emmanuel to the&nbsp;Knights of St John, who soon after resisted a siege by the sultan&nbsp;Othman. They strengthened the natural advantages of the place&nbsp;by skilful fortifications, and by discipline and equipments made&nbsp;themselves nearly a match for the superior numbers of the Turks.&nbsp;Nor did the knights restrict their efforts to self-defence ; they&nbsp;conquered Smyrna, and established an outpost there in 1344, and&nbsp;at a later period formed a league against the common enemy of&nbsp;Christendom. But in 1401 Smyrna was taken by Timur ; in&nbsp;1480 Mohammed II. besieged Rhodes with a vast train of artillery;&nbsp;and, though then averted by the courage of its few defenders, the&nbsp;downfall of the place could not long be delayed. The last and&nbsp;most famous siege of Rhodes took place in 1522, when, after a&nbsp;desperate resistance for four months to the overwhelming numbers&nbsp;of the Ottomans, the knights, being left unassisted by all the&nbsp;European pow<sup>τ</sup>ers, capitulated on honourable terms, and evacuated&nbsp;the island. On the first day of 1523 »Villiers de Lisle Adam, the&nbsp;grandmaster, embarked the last of the small band, carrying away&nbsp;all the property of the order, and leaving the ruins of their city to&nbsp;the enemy. The knights subsequently settled in Malta, where&nbsp;they also gained great renown. Rhodes has since been in the possession of the Turks, and is now the residence of the pasha of the&nbsp;Archipelago. The sites of Lindus, Ialysus, and Camirus, which in&nbsp;the most ancient times were the principal tow<sup>τ</sup>ns of the island, are&nbsp;clearly marked, and the first of the three is still occupied by a&nbsp;small town with a mediæval castle, both of them dating from the&nbsp;time of the knights, though the castle occupies the site of the&nbsp;ancient acropolis, of the w<sup>τ</sup>alls of which considerable remains are&nbsp;still visible. There are no ruins of any importance on the site of&nbsp;either Ialysus or Camirus, but excavations at the latter place have&nbsp;produced valuable and interesting results in the way of ancient&nbsp;vases and other antiquities, which are now in the British Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The population of the island is estimated at about 27,000, of whom 6000 are Turks, 3000 Jews, and the remainder Greeks. Of&nbsp;these nearly 20,000 are cortained in the city and its suburbs ;&nbsp;the rest of the island is very thinly peopled, though numerous&nbsp;small villages are scattered over its whole extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A large mass of matter relating to the ancient history and institutions of Rhodes are collected by Meursius in his dissertation </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Opera,</span><span class="font0"> vol. iii.)∙, the present condition of the island, and the objects of interest still visible there, are fully&nbsp;described by Ross </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Reisen auf den Griechischen Inseln,</span><span class="font0"> vol. iii., Stuttgart, 1840)&nbsp;and Newton </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Travels and Discoveries in the Levant,</span><span class="font0"> vol. i., London, 1865). The&nbsp;inscriptions that have been discovered there, which are very numerous, have unfortunately been published in a very irregular manner, and are scattered through&nbsp;a number of works, many of them not easy of access. By far the most complete collection of all that relates to the ancient condition of the island, as well&nbsp;as its history and antiquities, will be found in a treatise by Mr C. Torr, entitled&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodes in Ancient Times,</span><span class="font0"> which is passing through the Cambridge University&nbsp;Press while this article has been in preparation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E.
