Here it is obvious that the slowest rate and smallest power will be most economical ; but it should be remembered that the great purposes of steam are generally of a different nature from the mere generation of motion through a quiescent fluid. The force of adverse winds and waves is to be opposed, stream-tides and currents are to be stemmed ; and it is the success of steam in conquering those obstacles, and obtaining regularity and speed in spite of them, which constitutes its superiority over wind or animal power in navigation.</p><p>Now, if we take a simple case of one of these, we shall soon find that a higher proportion of power to tonnage may be essential, not only to speed, but even to economy. Suppose a steam-boat with a small proportion of power, capable of propelling the vessel at the velocity of three miles an hour through still water, to be applied to stem a current of three miles an hour, is it not plain that the vessel would make no head way, and thus a low proportion of power would burn an immense quantity of coal in doing nothing but standing still ?</p><p>Let ns again suppose that the same vessel, capable of steaming three miles an hour, meets with a moderately strong breeze opposed to her, such as prevents her from making any progress at all against it; then it is plain that by the continuation of this breeze, the vessel burning a continual supply of fuel would consume an indefinite quantity of coal in standing still. This extreme case of too little power, shows that there is at least one proportion of power, which is too small for economy of fuel ; viz , that proportion which, being very economical of fuel in fine weather, is brought up altogether by adverse winds. In this case, the consumption of fuel is rendered indefinite, and the useful effect of fuel completely annihilated by too small a proportion of power.</p><p>As, then, we have plainly established the existence of a limit to diminution of power, in the vicinity of which it must be followed by extravagant consumption of fuel, we may now proceed to investigate the question of best proportion, or the point where the attainment of high speed is accompanied by absolute saving of fuel as compared to lower velocity. For this purpose, we merely take it for granted that the speed through the water will be nearly as the square root of the power, according to the general law of the resistance of fluids ; that the resistance offered by bad weather or adverse winds has been ascertained and is determined on a particular station : that is, that it is known that on a given station a given vessel with a given power makes a voyage in adverse circumstances in, suppose, double the time of her most prosperous voyage; say her most prosperous voyage is in fourteen days, and her adverse voyage in twenty-four days, being a retarding power of ton days out of twenty-four ; we take this retardation of ten days as the measure of the retarding power of adverse weather in the given circumstances. And further, let the following quantities be thus represented :—</p><p>Let <hi rend="italic">h</hi> be the power, <hi rend="italic">v</hi> the velocity, <hi rend="italic">f</hi> the fuel consumed, <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the time in good weather,</p><p>Let <hi rend="italic">h'</hi> be the power, <hi rend="italic">v'</hi> the velocity, <hi rend="italic">f'</hi> the fuel consumed, i' the time in bad weather, } In a given vessel, on a given situation.</p><p>Let <hi rend="italic">h"</hi> be the power, <hi rend="italic">v''</hi> the velocity, <hi rend="italic">f"</hi> the fuel consumed, <hi rend="italic">t"</hi> the time in good weather,</p><p>Let <hi rend="italic">h'"</hi> be the power, <hi rend="italic">v"</hi> the velocity, <hi rend="italic">f'''</hi> the fuel consumed, <hi rend="italic">f'</hi> the time in bad weather,  } In another vessel of greater power on the same station.</p><p>Also, let <hi rend="italic">k</hi> represent the consumption of fuel per horsepower per hour, and <hi rend="italic">s</hi> the length of the voyage or distance performed.
