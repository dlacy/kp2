Dalmatius, the emperor’s brother, was ſent to defend thoſe parts that bordered upon the Goths ; and Annibalianus, his nephew, had the charge of Cappadocia and Armenia Minor. This dι-vilion of the empire ſtiſl farther contributed to its downfall: for the united ſtrength of the ſtate being no longer brought to repreſs invaſions, the barbarians fought with ſuperior numbers ; and conquered at laſt, though often defeated. Conſtantine, however, did not live to feel theſe calamities. The latter part of hie reign was peaceful and ſplendid ; ambaſſadors from the remoteſt Indies came to acknowledge his authority ; the Perſians, who were ready for freſh inroads, upon finding him prepared to oppoſe, ſent humbly to deſire his friendſhip and forgivenneſs. He was above 60 years old, and had reigned above 30 years, when he found bis health began to -decline. To obviate the effects of bis diſorder, which was an intermitting fever, he made uſe of the warm baths of the city ; but receiving no benefit from thence, he removed for change of air to Helenopolis, a city which he had built to the memory of his mother. His diſorder increaſing, he changed again to Nicomedia ; where finding himſelf without hopes of recovery, he cauſed himſelf to be Baptized ; and having ſoon after received the fâcrament, he expired, after a memorable and active reign of 32 years. This monarch’s character is repreſented to us in very different lights : the Chriſtian writers of that time adorning it with every ſtrain of panegyric ; the heathens, on the contrary, loading it with all the virulence of invective. He eſtabliſhed a religion that continues the bleſſing of mankind ; but purſued a ſeheme of politics that deſtroyed the empire.</p><p>From the time of Conſtantine to the diviſion of the empire between Valentiniaa and his brother Valens, the hiſtory of Rome is related under the article Constantinople, where alſo that of the eaſtern part is carried down to the final deſtruction of that city by the Turks. In the beginning of the reign of Valentinian, the province of Libya Tripolitana was grievouſly oppreſſed by the barbarians of the deſert, and almoſt equally ſo by Ro-manus its own governor. His conduct was ſo exceedingly oppreſſive, that the inhabitants ſent a deputation to Valentinian, complaining of their unhappy ſituation, and deſiring redreſs. Palladius was accordingly ſent to inquire into the ſtate of the province ; but being gained over by Romanus, he made a falſe report to the emperor ; and thus the unhappy province was leſt a prey to the mercileſs invaders and rapacious governor. During the reſt of this reign the barbarians continued their inroads into the empire ; and among others, we find the Saxons now putting in for a ſhare of the ſpoils of the ruined empire : however, their army was at this time entirely cut off. At laſt Valentinian himſelf took the field againſt theſe northern barbarians ; and entering the country of the Quadi, deſtroyed all with fire and ſword. The barbarians on this were fain to ſue for peace in a very humble manner ; but Valentinian, falling into a great paſſion while ſpeaking to them, threatened to extirpate the whole nation at once. His fury on this occaſion produced an apoplexy, or ſome ocher mortal diſorder ; for he ſuddenly ſell down, and being conveyed by his attendants into his chamber, he was ſeized with violent convulſive fits and contortions of all his limbs, in the agonies of which he expired,</p><lb/><p>in the year 375, the 55‘th of his age, and 12th of his reign.</p><p>After the death of Valentinian, his ſon Gratian took upon him the imperial dignity ; ſoon after becoming maſter of the whole empire by the death of Valens. The tranſactions of his reign, and thoſe of his partner Ttieodoſius, are related under the article Constantinople, n<hi rend="sup">0</hi> 77—89. The death of Theodoſius gave the finiſhing ſtroke to the Roman affairs ; his ſon Ho-norius, to whom he left the weſtern empire, being poſſeſſed of no abilities whatever, and indeed ſeeming to have been but very little removed from an idiot. The barbarians appear to have been abundantly ſenſible of the advantages offered them by the death of Theodofius. He expired in the month of January ; and before the acceſſion of ſpring, the Goths were in arms. The barbarian auxiliaries alſo now declared their independency ; and along with their countrymen, furiouſly aſſailed the declining empire. The Goths were now headed by an experienced commander, their celebrated king Alaric ; who would have proved formidable even in better times of the empire. He firſt over-ran Greece, which he accompliſhed without oppoſition, through the treachery of the governor, who commanded the troops that defended the paſs at Thermopylæ to retire at the approach of the enemy. Athens, Corinth, Argos, Sparta, yielded without reſiſtance ; and the whole country was ravaged and deſtroyed by the blood-thirſty barbarians. At laſt, in the year 397, he was oppoſed by Stilicho, the general of Honorius, a man of great valour and experience in war. The Goths were defeated with great loſs, and afterwards beſieged in their camp ; but through miſtake or negligence in the Roman commander, they were ſuffered to eſcape, and make themſelves maſters of the province of Epirus. Alaric then, having found means to conclude a treaty with the miniſters of Conſtantinople, Stilicho was obliged to retire.</p><p>Not long after this, Alaric invaded Italy itſelf. The emperor, ſtruck with terror, would have abandoned the country and fled into Gaul : but this diſgracefui and pernicious meaſure was oppoſed by Stilicho ; who propoſed to the court of Honorius, at that time at Milan, that if they would maintain their ground during his abſence, he would ſoon return with an army capable of oppoſing the barbarians. This being agreed to, Stilicho immediately ſet out for Rhætia, where the •moſt conſiderable body of the Roman forces at that time was, and collected his troops with the utmoſt diligence. But in the mean time Honorius was in the greateſt danger ; having been obliged to take refuge in the town of Aſta in Piedmont. To this place the Goths inſtantly laid ſiege, and a capitulation had been propoſed, when the drooping ſpirits of Honorius were at once revived by the arrival of Stilicho, whom he had ſo long expected. The Goths were now beſieged in their turn, and obliged to come to a deciſive battle at Pollentia. The engagement laſted the whole day ; but at laſt the Goths were compelled to retreat. Their camp was inſtantly inveſted ; their entrenchments forced with great ſlaughter; the wife of Alaric was taken, with all the wealth which had been amaſſed in plundering Greece ; while many thouſands of Roman priſoners were releaſed from the moſt deplorable ſlavery. The victory, however, was not ſo deciſive but that A ;</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
