<p><span class="font0">kindle ſedition among the people. Theſe letters, however, were intercepted by the centurion’s friends, who ſent him down a full relation of the deſign laid againſt&nbsp;the liberty and the honour of his only daughter. Virginius, upon this, pretending the death of a near relation, got permiffioH to leave the camp, and flew to&nbsp;'Rome, inſpired with indignation and revenge. Ac-cordingly, the next day he appeared before the tribu</span><span class="font1">ne<sup>1</sup>, </span><span class="font0">to the aftoni(hment of Appius, leading his weeping daughter by the hand, both habited in the deepeſt&nbsp;mourning. Claudius, the accuſer, was alſo there, and&nbsp;began by making his demand. Virginius next ſpoke&nbsp;in turn : he repreſented that his wiſe had many children ; that ſhe had been ſeen pregnant by numbers ;&nbsp;that, if he had intentions of adopting a ſuppoſititious&nbsp;child, he would have fixed upon a boy rather than a&nbsp;girl ; that it was notorious to all, that his wiſe had herſelf ſuckled her own child ; and that it was ſurpriſing&nbsp;ſſuch a claim ſhould be now revived, after a 15 years&nbsp;diſeontinuance. While the father ſpoke this with a&nbsp;ſtern air, Virginia ſtood trembling by, and, with looks&nbsp;of perſuaſive innocence, added Weight to all his remon-ſtrances. The people ſeemed entirely ſatisfied of the&nbsp;hardſhip of his caſe, till Appius, fearing what he ſaid&nbsp;might have dangerous effects upon the multitude, interrupted him, under a pretence of being ſufficiently inſtructed in the merits of the cauſe, and finally adjudged&nbsp;her to Claudius, ordering the lictors to carry her off.&nbsp;The lictors, in obedience to his command, ſoon drove&nbsp;off the throng that preſſed round the tribunal ; and now&nbsp;they ſeized upon Virginia, and were delivering her up&nbsp;into the hands of Claudius, when Virginius, who found&nbsp;that all was over, ſeemed to acquieſce in the ſentence.&nbsp;He therefore mildly intreated Appius to be permitted&nbsp;to take a laſt farewel of one whom he had long conſidered as his child ; and ſo ſatisfied, he would return&nbsp;to his duty with freſh alacrity. With this the decemvir complied, but upon condition that' their endearments ſhould paſs in his preſence. Virginius, with the&nbsp;moſt poignant anguiſh, took his almoſt expiring' daughter in his arms, for a while ſupported her head upon&nbsp;his breaft, and wiped away the tears that rolled down&nbsp;her lovely viſage ; and happening to be near the ſhops&nbsp;that ſurrounded the forum, he ſnatched up a knife that&nbsp;lay on the ſhambles, and buried the weapon in her&nbsp;breaſt ; then holding it up, reeking with the blood of&nbsp;his daughter, “ Appius (he cried) by this blood of&nbsp;innocence, I devote thy head to the infernal gods.”&nbsp;Thus ſaying, with the bloody knife in his hand, and&nbsp;threatening deſtruction to whomſoever ſhould oppoſe&nbsp;him, he ran through the city, wildly calling upon the&nbsp;people to ſtrike for freedom, and from thence went to&nbsp;the camp, in order to ſpread a like flame through the&nbsp;army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He no ſooner arrived at the camp, followed hy a number of his friends, but he informed the army of all&nbsp;that was done, ſtill holding the bloody knife in his&nbsp;hand. He allied their pardon, and the pardon of the&nbsp;gods, for having committed ſo raſh an action, but af-cribed it all to the dreadful neceſſity of the times. The&nbsp;army, already prediſpoſed, immediately with ſhouts&nbsp;echoed their approbation ; and decamping, left their&nbsp;generals behind, to take their ſtation once more upon&nbsp;mount Aventine, whither they had retired about 40</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">years before. The other army, which had been to oppoſe the Sabines, ſeemed to feel a like reſentment, and came over in large parties to join them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Appius, in the mean time, did all he could to quell the diſturbances in the city ; but finding the tumult&nbsp;incapable of controul, and perceiving that his mortal&nbsp;enemies, Valerius and Horatius, were the moſt active&nbsp;in oppoſition, at firſt attempted to find ſafety by flight;&nbsp;nevertheleſs, being encouraged by Oppius, who waâ&nbsp;one of his colleagus, he ventured to aſſemble the ſenate, and urged the puniſhment of all deſerters. The&nbsp;ſenate, however, were far from giving him the relief&nbsp;he ſought for ; they foreſaw the dangers and miſeries&nbsp;that threatened the ſtate, in caſe of oppoſing the incenſed army ; they therefore diſpatched meſſengers to&nbsp;them, offering to reſtore their former mode of government. To this propoſal all the people joyfully aſſent-ed, and the army gladly obeyed. Appius and Oppius,&nbsp;one of his colleagues, both died by their own hands in&nbsp;priſon. The other eight decemvirs went into voluntary&nbsp;exile ; and Claudius, the pretended maſter of Virginia,&nbsp;was driven out after them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tribunes now grew more turbulent : they propoſed two laws ; one to permit plebeians to intermarry with patricians ; and the other, to permit them to be admitted to the conſulſhip alſo. The ſenators received theſe propoſals with indignation, and ſeemed reſolved to undergo the utmoſt extremities rather than&nbsp;ſubmit to enact them. However, finding their reſiſtance only increaſe the commotions of the ſtate, they&nbsp;at laſt conſented to paſs the law concerning intermarriages, hoping that this conceſſion would ſatisfy thç.&nbsp;people. But they were to be appeaſed but for a very&nbsp;ſhort time : for, returning to their old cuſtom of refu-fing to enliſt upon the approach of an enemy, the conſuls were forced to hold a private conference with the&nbsp;chief of the ſenate ; where, after many debates, Claudius propoſed an expedient as the moſt probable means&nbsp;of ſatisfying the people in the preſent conjuncture.&nbsp;This was, to create fix or eight governors in the room&nbsp;of conſuls, whereof one half at leaſt ſhould be patricians.&nbsp;This project was eagerly embraced by the people ; yet&nbsp;ſo fickle were the multitude, that though many of the&nbsp;plebeians ſtood, the choice wholly fell upon the patricians who offered themſelves as candidates. Theſe&nbsp;new magiſtrates were called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">military tribunes ;</span><span class="font0"> they were&nbsp;at firſt but three, afterwards they were increaſed to&nbsp;four, and at length to fix. They had the power and&nbsp;enſigns of conſuls ; yet that power being divided among&nbsp;a number, each fingly was of leſs authority. The firſt&nbsp;that were choſen only continued in office about three&nbsp;months, the augurs having found ſomething amiſs in the&nbsp;ceremonies of their election.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The military tribunes being depoſed, the conſuls once more came into office ; and, in order to lighten&nbsp;the weight of buſineſs which they were obliged to ſuſtain, a new office was erected, namely, that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cenſors,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">to be choſen every fifth year. Their buſineſs was to&nbsp;take an eſtimate of the number and eſtates of the&nbsp;people, and to diſtribute them into their proper claſſes;&nbsp;to inſpect into the-lives and manners of their fellow-citizens ; tö degrade ſenators for miſconduct ; to diſmount&nbsp;knights ; and to turn down plebeians fiom their tribes&nbsp;into an inferior, in caſe of miſdemeanour.
