                lines MN, NY will be equal to that of the frame formed by the curve <hi
                    rend="italic">Ma </hi>D Y ; and the frame formed by the ſtraight lines will for
                the moſt part be always more ſuſceptible of receiving a bow that will eaſily divide
                the fluid. It is alſo evident, that the cargo or ballaſt, being lower in the frame
                formed of ſtraight lines than in the other, it will therefore be more advantageouſly
                placed, and will enable the ſhip to carry more ſail @@(c); ſo that having a bow
                equally well or better formed, ſhe will ſail faſter.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prob.</hi> VI. To deſcribe a ſtern having aſquaretuck.</p>
            <p>Let AB (fig. <hi rend="smallcaps">ii.)</hi> be the middle line of the poſt, and let

                Make CE equal to the height of the lower part of the ſaſhion- piece above the keel :
                make CT equal to the height of the extremity G of the tranſom above the plane of the

                to above one-ninth or one-tenth of GT, and deſcribe the arch GH, the centre of which
                will be in BA produced : make EK equal to five-twelfths of ET ; through K draw KL
                perpendicular to CD, and equal to EK ; and with an extent equal to EL deſcribe the
                arch EL. Make GI equal to the half of ET, and from the centre I deſcribe the arch
                GM, and draw the reconciling curve ML.— Let the curve of the faſhion-piece be
                produced upwards to the point repreſenting the upper height of breadth, as at O.
                Make ON equal to the height of the top- timber, and BN equal to the half breadth at
                that place, and join ON. Through N and the upper part of the counter, let arches be
                deſcribed parallel to GH, The tafferel, windows, and remaining part of the ſtern,
                may be finiſhed agreeable to the fancy of the artiſt.</p>
            <p>In fig. 12. the projection of the ſtern on the plane of elevation is laid down, the
                method of doing which is obvious from inſpection.</p>
            <p>If the tranſom is to round aft, then ſince the ſaſhion pieces are always ſided
                ſtraight, their planes will interſect the ſheer and floor planes in a ſtraight line.
                Let G <hi rend="italic">g</hi> (fig. 14.) be the interſection of the plane of the
                faſhion-piece with the floor plane. From the point <hi rend="italic">g </hi>draw <hi

                meet the line <hi rend="italic">k W</hi> in the points a, <hi rend="italic">s,
                    b,</hi> and draw the perpendiculars aa, ss, hh<hi rend="italic">.</hi> From the

                From the points G, 3, 2, 1 in the floor plane draw lines perpendicular to <hi

                3, 2, 1 ; and through theſe points deſcribe the curve G 3 2 1 <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> ; and WG 3 2, 1 <hi rend="italic">k</hi> will be the projection of the
                plane of the faſhion- piece on the ſheer plane. Through the points G, 3, 2,</p>
            <p>1 (fig. 13.) draw the lines GF, 3 A, 2 S, 1 H, perpendicular to W <hi rend="italic"

                    >k</hi> will be the true form of the plane of the aft side of the faſhion-piece.
                When it is in its proper poſition, the line WF will be in the ſame plane with the
                ſheer line ; the line <hi rend="italic">a</hi> A in the same plane with the water
                line <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 3 ; the line <hi rend="italic">s</hi> S in the ſame

                perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">g</hi> M, and curved lines being drawn from theſe
                points to G, 3, 2, 1 (fig. 14.) reſpectively, will give the form and dimenſions of
                the tuck at the ſeveral water lines.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prob.</hi> VII. To bevel the faſhion-piece of a ſquare tuck by
                water-lines-</p>
            <p>As the faſhion-piece both rakes and cants, the planes of the water-lines will
                therefore interſect it higher on the aft than on the fore-ſide : but before the
                heights on the fore-side can be found, the breadth of the timber muſt be determined
                ; which let be <hi rend="italic">bn</hi> (fig. 15.) Then, as it cants, the breadth
                in the direction of the waterline will exceed the true breadth. In order to find the
                true breadth, form the aft-ſide of the faſhion-piece as directed in the laſt
                problem.</p>
            <p>Let <hi rend="italic">t</hi> 5 (fig. 13.) be the aft-ſide of the rabbet on the
                outſide of the poſt, WM the common section of the plan of the faſhion-piece and the
                ſheer-plan. Before this laſt line can be determined, the ſeveral water-lines 1, 2,
                3, 4, and 5, muſt be drawn parallel to the keel, which may repreſent ſo many
                tranſoms.— Let theſe water lines be formed and ended at the aft- ſide of the rabbet,
                as in ſig. 14. where the rounds aft of the ſeveral tranſoms are deſcribed, limiting
                the curves of the water lines. Now the line WM muſt rake ſo as to leave room for
                half the thickneſs of the poſt, at the tuck : in order to which, produce Wg to <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> ; make <hi rend="italic">rg </hi>half the thickneſs of the
                poſt ; through <hi rend="italic">r</hi> draw a line parallel to <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> M to intersect G in <hi rend="italic">b</hi> : then with the radius <hi
                    rend="italic">r b,</hi> from .v the point of the tuck as a centre, deſcribe an
                arch, and draw the line WM juſt to touch the back of that arch.</p>
            <p>The linc WM being drawn, let any point <hi rend="italic">k</hi> in it be aſſumed at
                pleaſure : from <hi rend="italic">k</hi> draw <hi rend="italic">k</hi> y
                perpendicular to gM : through y draw y <hi rend="italic">f</hi> (fig. 14.) parallel
                to g G, intersecting the line M f drawn perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">g</hi> M
                in the point f<hi rend="italic">.</hi> From M draw M <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">yf,</hi> and from y draw y <hi rend="italic"
                    >n</hi> perpendicular to WM (rig. 13.) Make Μ n (fig. 15.) equal to Mi (fig.
                14.) ; then MI (fig. 15. ) being equal toy <hi rend="italic">k</hi> (fig. 13 ), join
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> 1, and the angle 1 n M will be the bevelling to the
                horizontal plane. Again, make Mz, Mf(fig. 15. ) reſpectively equal to yn (fig. 13.)
                and Mf (fig. 14.), and join <hi rend="italic">z J</hi> ; and the angle Mzf will be
                the bevelling to the ſheer plane.</p>
            <p>The bevelling being now found, draw the line <hi rend="italic">a b </hi>(fig. 15.)
                parallel to <hi rend="italic">z n, a z</hi> or <hi rend="italic">b n</hi> being the
                ſcantling of the timber. Then <hi rend="italic">n x</hi> will be the breadth of the
                timber on the horizontal plane, and <hi rend="italic">z e</hi> its breadth on the
                ſheer plane, and <hi rend="italic">a c</hi> what it is within a ſquare.</p>
