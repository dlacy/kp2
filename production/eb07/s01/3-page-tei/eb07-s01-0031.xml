It is more unhealthy than Bombay, the jungle being thicker and more shut in. In its present uncultivated state, it scarcely produces the hundredth part of what it might supply. Notwithstanding its present desolate state, Salsette contains numerous mythological antiquities, and the remains of reservoirs with flights of steps round them, and the ruins of temples, which indicate that it was formerly in a greater state of prosperity, and had a more numerous population. Among the most remarkable curiosities, are the caverns at Kennere, which are very extraordinary excavations. The largest resembles that at Carli, but is not equal to it in size and elegance. It contains two gigantic figures of Boodh, nearly twenty feet in height, and each filling one side of the vestibule. They are exactly alike, and in complete preservation, the Portuguese having adopted them and painted them red, and converted the temple into a Christian church. The manufacture of salt is carried on at the sea-shore, where extensive enclosures are levelled and divided into partitions of about twenty feet square, which are filled by the overflowing of the sea, and contain six or eight inches of water. The moisture is exhaled by the heat of the sun before the next tide, and the salt is gathered from the bottom of the enclosure. The first account we have of this island is dated in 1330, and was written by a friar named Oderic. It was taken possession of by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century, and from them by the Mahrattas in 1750. In 1773, during a rupture with that nation, the Company’s troops obtained possession of it ; and it was formally ceded by the Mahrattas, at the treaty of Poorbun- der, in 1776, and subsequently confirmed at the peace of 1782—83, when all the small islands in the gulf formed by Bombay and Salsette were also ceded.</p><p>SALT, one of the great divisions of natural bodies. The characteristic marks of salt have usually been reckoned its power of affecting the organs of taste, and its being soluble in water. But this will not distinguish salt from quicklime, which also affects the sense of taste, and dissolves in water ; yet quicklime has been universally reckoned an earth, and not a salt. The only distinguishing property of salts, therefore, is their crystallization in water. But this does not belong to all salts ; for the nitrous and marine acids, though allowed on all hands to be salts, are yet incapable of crystallization, at least by any method hitherto known. Several <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the imperfect neutral salts, such as combinations of the nitrous, muriatic, and vegetable acids, with some kinds of earths, also crystallize with very great difficulty. However, by the addition of spirit of wine, or some other substances which absorb part of the water, and keeping the liquor in a warm place, all of them may be reduced to crystals of one kind or other. Salt, therefore, may be defined a substance affecting the organs of taste, soluble in water, and capable of crystallization, either by itself or in conjunction with some other body ; and, universally, every salt capable of being reduced into a solid form is also capable of crystallization <hi rend="italic">per se.</hi> Thus the class of saline bodies will be sufficiently distinguished from all others ; for quicklime, though soluble in water, cannot be crystallized without addition either of fixed air or of some other acid ; yet it is most commonly found in a solid state. The precious stones, though supposed to be formed by crystallization, are nevertheless distinguished from salts by their insipidity and insolubility in water.</p><p>But acids and alkalis, and combinations of both, when in a concrete form, are salts, and of the purest form. Hence we conclude, that the bodies to which the name of salts more properly belongs are the concretions of those substances, which are accordingly called acid salts, alkaline salts, and neutral</p><p>salts. These last are combinations of acid and alkaline salts, in such proportion as to render the compounds neither sour nor alkaline to the taste. This proportional combination is called saturation. Thus common kitchen salt is a neutral salt, composed of muriatic acid and soda combined together to the point of saturation. The appellation of neutral salts is also extended to denote all those combinations of acids, and any other substance with which they can unite, so as to lose, wholly or in a great measure, their acid properties.</p><p>But although this general definition of salts is commonly received, yet there are many writers, especially mineralogists, who confine the denomination of salts in the manner we first mentioned, viz. to those substances only which, besides the general properties of salts, have the power of crystallizing, that is, of arranging their particles so as to form regularly-shaped bodies, called crystals, when the water superfluous to their concrete existence has been evaporated.</p><p><hi rend="italic">common </hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Salt,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sea-Salt,</hi> the name of that salt extracted from the waters of the ocean, which is used in greater quantities for preserving provisions, and other domestic</p><p>purposes.</p><p>It is a perfect neutral salt, composed of marine or muriatic acid, saturated with mineral alkali. It has a saline but agreeable flavour. It requires about four times its weight of cold water to be dissolved, and nearly the same quantity of boiling water, according to Macquer ; but according to Kirwan, it only’ requires 2·5 its weight of water to be dissolved in the temperature of sixty degrees of Fahrenheit. This salt always contains some part formed with a calcareous base ; and, in order to have it pure, it must be dissolved in distilled water. Then a solution of mineral alkali is to be poured into it until no white precipitation appears ; and by filtrating and evaporating the solution, a pure common salt is produced. Its figure is perfectly cubic, and those hollow pyramids, as well as the parallelopipeds formed sometimes in its crystallization, consist all of a quantity of small cubes, disposed in those forms. Its decrepitation on the fire, which has been reckoned by some as a characteristic of this salt, although the vitriolated tartar, nitrous lead, and other salts, have the same property, is owing chiefly to the water, and perhaps also to the air of its crystallization.</p><p>Its specific gravity is 2·120 according to Kirwan. The acid of tartar precipitates nothing from it. One hundred parts of common salt contain thirty-three of real acid, fifty of mineral alkali, and seventeen of water. It is commonly found in salt water and salt springs, in the proportion of even thirty-six per cent. It is found also in coals, and in beds of gypsum. This salt is unalterable by fire, though it fuses and becomes more opaque. Nevertheless a violent fire, with the free access of air, causes it to evaporate in white flowers, which adhere to the neighbouring bodies. It is only decomposed, as Macquer affirms, by the sulphuric and nitric acids, and also by the boracic or sedative salt. But although nitre is very easily decomposed by arsenic, this neutral marine salt is nowise decomposed by it. According to Monge, the fixed vegetable alkali, when caustic, decomposes all this marine salt. It preserves from corruption almost all sorts of animal food much better for use than any other salt, as it does so without destroying their taste and qualities ; but when applied in too small a quantity, it then promotes putrefaction.</p><p>Of this most useful commodity there are ample stores on land as well as in the ocean. There are few countries indeed which do not afford vast quantities of rock or fossil salt. Mines of it have long been discovered and wrought in England, Spain, Italy, Germany, Hungary, Poland, and other countries of Europe. In several parts of the world there are huge mountains which wholly consist of fossil salt. Of this kind are two mountains in Russia, near Astracan ; several in the kingdoms of Tunis and Algiers, in Africa ; some also in Asia ; and the whole island of Ormus, in the</p></body></text></TEI>
