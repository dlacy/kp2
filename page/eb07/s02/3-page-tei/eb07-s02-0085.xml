Next to the Tweed, the most considerable waters are the Ettrick and the Yarrow, which receive, in the first instance, nearly all the other streams that tτaverse this district. Both have been celebrated in song, and have given their names to some plaintive melodies of great beauty and feeling. The scenery on the Yarrow is exceedingly romantic and delightful. Soon after its rise, it passes through two lakes, the Loch of the Lows, and St Mary’s Loch ; the latter, which is separated from the former only by a narrow neck of level ground, and is three miles long, having its banks partly covered with cop-</p><p>pice-wood, is the finest piece of water in the south of Scot- and. From thence the Yarrow flows for eight or nine miles, through sheep-walks, without wood or cultivation ; but afterwards the sides of the lofty hills in its course are covered with wood to a considerable height, and its valley is embellished with a variety of bushes and wild flowers. Ettrick, the larger stream, has a wider and more cultivated valley ; and a little before it receives the Yarrow, natural wood begins to appear on its banks. It afterwards flows for four miles through a rich tract, sheltered by plantations on the hills, till it loses its name in the Tweed. From this river the whole district has been sometimes called Ettrick Forest ; but the name of Forest here, as elsewhere, has long since ceased to denote the existence of extensive woodlands, of which, whatever may have been the case formerly, scarcely any traces now remain. Besides the two lakes we have mentioned, a great many smaller ones are scattered over the east and south-east quarters, of which the more considerable are Loch Alemoor, the principal source of the Ale, and Loch Oakermoor, noted for the vast quantity of marl which it contains.</p><p>This county is deficient in coal, limestone, and sandstone, and it lies under the same disadvantages as Roxburghshire, from the great distance at which it lies from markets where coal and lime are to be had. It is fortunate, however, that in the lakes and mosses there is a great deal of marl, which serves as excellent manure for the arable land in their vicinity. The arable land lies on an elevation of from 280 to 800 feet, and does not much exceed one twentieth of the whole county. It is light, dry, and easily cultivated ; and it produces wheat, oats, barley or bear, turnips, and potatoes. Wheat is regularly grown in the lower parts of the county, and even in the higher it has been raised at the height of 700 feet, yielding a good return ; and it may be said that agriculture is as well understood and followed out in this as in any other of the Scotch counties. The rotation in crops is generally on the five-shift system of husbandry ; although, near the towns, where land is high and manure can be easily had, the four-shift is too often followed. This has increased the disease of the turnip crop, called fingers- and-toes, and has proved very injurious to the red clover.</p><p>The average rent of land is, on the arable farms, from one pound four shillings to three pounds an acre ; and on the pastoral farms from two shillings and sixpence to five shillings and sixpence an acre. The grazing of an ox or cow throughout the year is about five pounds. In Ettrick it is from two pounds to two pounds five shillings ; and that of a sheep is from four shillings and sixpence to six shillings and sixpence. The wages paid to farm-servants and shepherds</p><p>are nearly the same as in Roxburghshire. The following summary of the produce and value of the parishes of Selkirk, Galashiels, Yarrow, and Ettrick, as stated in the New Statistical Account of Scotland, will more fully explain the value of the county.</p><table><row><cell>PARISH.</cell><cell>Square Miles in extent.</cell><cell cols="5">Acres.</cell><cell>Total yearly Value of Raw Produce raised.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell/><cell>Cultivated, or occasionally in Tillage.</cell><cell>Uncultivated.</cell><cell>Capable of being cultivated with a profit</cell><cell>In undivided Common.</cell><cell>Under Wood.</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Selkirk	</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>3000</cell><cell>2,300</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>1000</cell><cell>£10,681 18 0</cell></row><row><cell>Galashiels.</cell><cell>15</cell><cell>3000</cell><cell>6,000</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>500</cell><cell>10,809 10 0</cell></row><row><cell>Yarrow....</cell><cell>111</cell><cell>2740</cell><cell>67,800</cell><cell>260</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>610</cell><cell>28,606 0 0</cell></row><row><cell>Ettrick	</cell><cell>08</cell><cell>217</cell><cell>43,086</cell><cell>163</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>270</cell><cell>12,745 0 0</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>204</cell><cell cols="2">8957    l19,186</cell><cell>423</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>2380</cell><cell>£62,902	8 6</cell></row></table><p>The leases of the farms on the Buccleuch estates are for nine years ; but this is almost no drawback, as the occupiers are rarely removed. On other estates the leases run generally for nineteen years.</p><p>The rest of the county is almost exclusively occupied by sheep, which are now, for the most part, of the Cheviot breed, though not often pure, and scarcely in any instance equal to those of Roxburghshire. The black-faced or forest breed are better adapted for the greater part of the pasturage than the Cheviots ; but their wool is coarse, and not well adapted for manufacture. Yet it is generally allowed, that if proper care were taken to cross the ewes with Cheviot rams, and never allow them to recross, a stock of sheep suitable to the range of pasture, and with improved wool, would soon increase, and take the place of the present breed. The number of sheep usually in pasture amounts to 55,000, of which 3000 or 4000 are of the black-faced, 4000 Leicesters, and the remainder Cheviots. The cows are mostly of the short-horned, or of the Ayrshire breeds. Small farmers and feuars prefer the latter, as being more easily brought up, and affording more milk. Highland stots have been introduced, within these few years, to pasture among the sheep, as it has been found that from the complete draining of the district, the overflow of succulent grasses is such, that without a mixture of cattle with the sheep, the grass is totally lost. The greater number of cattle a farmer keeps on his pasture, according to its extent, from May to the middle of August, the more sheep he is able to feed during winter. The valued rent of the county is L.80,307. 15s. 6d. Scotch, and the real rent of the lands and houses in 1812 was L.4l,l62. 10s. sterling. The annual value of real property, as assessed in April 1815, was L.43,584. Two fifths of the whole property are held under entail. The principal proprietors are the Duke of Buccleuch, who possesses about one half of the extent, and about one third of the rental ; the Earl of Traquair, Lords Elibank and Napier, Johnston of Alva, with fifteen other proprietors, whose lands stand valued in the cess-books from L.1000 to L.2000 Scotch.</p><p>Selkirk, the county town, and the town of Galashiels, contain nearly all that part of the population which is not employed in agriculture. A considerable portion of the wool of the county finds a ready market at Galashiels. An inkle-work and some tanneries are the only other branches carried on for sale out of the county ; so that its exports consist chiefly of raw produce, of which its sheep and wool are by far the most considerable articles.</p><p>(See Douglas’ Survey of Selkirkshire ; the New Statistical Account of Scotland, No. 1 ; and the Quarterly Journal of Agriculture, No. 18.)</p><p>Selkirkshire returns a member to parliament.
