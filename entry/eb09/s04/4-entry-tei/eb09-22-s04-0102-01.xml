It consisted of a frame through which passed four rods ; attached to the frame was a handle. When shaken the rods rattled and produced the sound. After the introduction of Egyptian worships into Italy the Romans became familiar with the sistrum. It is described by Apuleius <hi rend="italic">(Metam.,</hi> xi. 4). An ancient sistrum formerly existed in the library of Ste Genevi√®ve at Paris. In paintings found at Portici a priest of Isis and a woman are represented rattling the sistrum. The instrument is said to be still in use in Nubia and Abyssinia.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
