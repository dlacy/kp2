<p><span class="font0">hospital on the Coelian. The rebuilding of the Palazzo del Parlamento is only second to the enormous monument of Victor&nbsp;Emanuel II. The majority of the buildings erected </span><span class="font1">by </span><span class="font0">individuals and corporations since 1870 present no original or characteristic features, and the best of them are copies or imitations&nbsp;of well-known models. The Cassa del Risparmio, in the Corso,&nbsp;reproduces a Florentine palace; the Palazzo Negroni, near the&nbsp;Piazza Nicotia, is modelled on the Cancelleria and the Palazzo&nbsp;Giraud; many of the large residences in the new quarters&nbsp;beyond the Tiber arc fairly good copies of palaces in the Florentine style, though the magnificent carved stone of earlier&nbsp;centuries is disadvantageous^ replaced by stucco, a material&nbsp;5vhich lasts tolerably well in the mild climate of Rome. Opposite&nbsp;the beautiful and severe Palazzo di Venezia, what might have&nbsp;been a faultless reproduction of it is marred by tasteless ornament. Finally, so far as the construction of new streets is concerned, which lovers of the picturesque so greatly deplore, it&nbsp;must be admitted that they have been rendered necessary by&nbsp;the great increase of traffic and population, and it should be remembered that after the 16th century the wisest of the popes&nbsp;did their best to open up the city by widening and straightening&nbsp;the thoroughfares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Municipal Administration.—</span><span class="font0">After the taking of Rome, those persons who remained loyal to Pius IX. took no part whatever&nbsp;in public affairs, and the municipal administration was entirely&nbsp;in the hands of the monarchists. The expression <sup>a</sup> ne eletti&nbsp;n£ elettori,” meaning that Catholics are to be neither voters&nbsp;nor candidates, which came to be regarded as a sort of rule&nbsp;of the party, was invented at that time by an epigrammatic&nbsp;journalist, and it seems at first to have been applied also to&nbsp;municipal matters, whereas it was later understood to refer&nbsp;only to parliamentary elections. Leo XIII. encouraged the&nbsp;formation of a Catholic party in the municipal administration,&nbsp;and the municipal government drifted largely into the hands&nbsp;of Catholics, though circumstances make it necessary that&nbsp;the Syndic (Mayor) should always be a royalist. Between&nbsp;1870 and the end of the century the socialist party had no&nbsp;great influence in Rome, which can never be a city of manufacturing interests. For purposes of municipal government the&nbsp;division of the city into districts has been modified, but the&nbsp;old division into fourteen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rioni</span><span class="font0"> is adhered to in principle, the&nbsp;new quarters of Castro Pretorio and the Esquiline having been&nbsp;included in the first Rione, which still bears the name of “ Monti.”&nbsp;The municipality consists of a mayor and eighty communal&nbsp;councillors, of whom a large proportion were for many years members of the aristocracy. Later, however, the three democratic&nbsp;parties, known as the monarchist, socialist and republican,&nbsp;united to form a popular coalition, and succeeded in completely&nbsp;excluding the conservative, aristocratic and Catholic elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poprdation.—</span><span class="font0">The population in 1870 was 226,022, as against 462,743 in 1901 (communal population). It therefore more&nbsp;than doubled in thirty years. The increase, however, did not&nbsp;take place at a regular rate, owing to the changes in the rates&nbsp;of immigration and emigration. The largest increase was in&nbsp;1870, reaching 22,186; the next most important in 1884, 1885,&nbsp;1886, 1887, in which years it constantly remained near 20,000.&nbsp;The least increase in later years was 4417 in 1891. The garrison&nbsp;of Rome is about 10,000 men. Careful inquiry has placed it&nbsp;beyond doubt that there are in Rome aboqt the same number&nbsp;of ecclesiastics of all orders, including about 1500 students in&nbsp;the theological seminaries. The average birth-rate is lower&nbsp;in Rome than in the majority of great cities. The number of&nbsp;births increased after 1870 very nearly in proportion with the&nbsp;increase of population.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Climate and Hygiene.—</span><span class="font0">The climate of Rome is mild and sunny, but the variation in temperature between day and night&nbsp;is very great. December and February appear to be the coldest&nbsp;months, the thermometer then averaging 47° F.; the greatest&nbsp;heat, which averages 75°, is felt in July and August. The surrounding Campagna is still not all habitable during the summer,&nbsp;though the dangerous malaria has been checked by the planting&nbsp;of numerous eucalyptus trees. A remarkable instance of the&nbsp;effect produced upon the marshy soil by these plantations&nbsp;may be studied at the Trappist monastery of the Tre Fontane,&nbsp;situated on the Via Ardcatina, about 4 m. from Rome. Whereas&nbsp;in former times it was almost always fatal to spend the whole&nbsp;summer there, the monks have so far dried the soil by means&nbsp;of the eucalyptus that they reside in the monastery throughout&nbsp;the year. The municipality has everywhere made strenuous&nbsp;efforts to reduce the mortality due to malaria; in 1890, 14%&nbsp;of all the deaths in Rome and the Campagna were attributed&nbsp;to this cause; in 1905 the proportion had dropped to 3%.&nbsp;Very large sums have been expended in a scientific system of&nbsp;drainage and sub-drainage on both sides of the Tiber, and the&nbsp;use of wire gauze mosquito nets for the doors and windows&nbsp;of the humblest habitations in the Campagna has contributed&nbsp;much to the present satisfactory result. The hygienic conditions of Rome itself have greatly improved, largely through&nbsp;the ceaseless efforts of Commendatore Baccelli, a distinguished&nbsp;man of science, who repeatedly held office in the Italian&nbsp;Ministry. The publication of exceedingly accurate graphic&nbsp;tables in February 1900 shows the following facts. Ninety per&nbsp;1000 deaths occurred in 1871 from typhoid (the so-called “ Roman&nbsp;fever ”), and the average has now fallen to a low constant.&nbsp;Deaths from small-pox, formerly of alarming frequency, can&nbsp;be said not to occur at all, and their numbers diminished&nbsp;suddenly after the introduction of compulsory vaccination..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Charities and Education.—</span><span class="font0">A great number of small charitable institutions for children and old people have been founded, which&nbsp;are organized on the most modern principles, and in many of these&nbsp;charitable persons of the upper classes give their individual assistance to the poor. There are also private hospitals for diseases of the&nbsp;eye, in which poor patients are lodged and treated without payment.&nbsp;There are two hospitals entirely maintained by private resources,&nbsp;where infants are treated whose mothers fear to send them to a&nbsp;public hospital, or in cases refused by the latter as not being serious&nbsp;enough for admission. Of course, the numbers of the poor greatly&nbsp;increased with the growth of population, especially after the failure&nbsp;of building speculations between 1888 and 1890, though great&nbsp;efforts were made by the municipality to send all persons then&nbsp;thrown out of employment back to their homes. One of the difficulties under which Rome labours is that w'hile it attracts the&nbsp;population of the country, as other capitals do, it possesses no great&nbsp;mechanical industries in which the newcomers can be employed.&nbsp;Efforts to create small industries in the populous quarters of the&nbsp;poor met with little success. Before 1870 a society was formed, which&nbsp;lias since greatly developed as an intelligent private enterprise, to&nbsp;provide the poor with sanitary tenements; but its success.is much&nbsp;hampered by the absence of employment, which again is partly&nbsp;due to the heavy taxation of small industries. A number of trade&nbsp;schools are also maintained by private funds, such as the Instituto&nbsp;degli Artigianelli, managed by the Fratelli della Dottrina Cristiana,&nbsp;and the Ricovero pei Fanciulli Abbandonati (home for friendless&nbsp;children), which is under lay management and has flourishing workshops. The character of official charities has certainly improved in&nbsp;principle, so far as their educational and moral scope are concerned ;&nbsp;for whereas in former times the limited number of the poor made&nbsp;individual and almost paternal relief possible, that form of charity&nbsp;had a pauperizing influence. If anything, the present tendency is&nbsp;to go too far in the opposite direction, and to require too many&nbsp;formalities before any relief is granted; and while the union of&nbsp;the principal charities under a central management on advanced&nbsp;theories improved the methods of administration, it destroyed&nbsp;numerous small sources of immediate relief on which the poor had&nbsp;a traditional right to count, and was in that way productive of&nbsp;hardship. At the same time, however, mutual benefit societies&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{società di mutuo soccorso)</span><span class="font0"> have been organized in great numbers&nbsp;by the different crafts and professions, and are chiefly distinguishable by the political parties to which they belong. It is characteristic of the modern Roman people that the most widely different&nbsp;elements subsist without showing any signs of amalgamating, yet&nbsp;without attacking each other. Some of these societies have an&nbsp;exclusively clerical character, others are merely conservative, some&nbsp;consist of monarchists, and some of avowed republicans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Popular educat ion.is principally in the hands of the municipality, but besides the public schools there are numerous religious institutions attended by the children of the lower classes; they follow&nbsp;the curriculum prese rii led by the government, and are under the&nbsp;constant supervision of municipal inspectors, both as regards their&nbsp;teaching and their hygiene. The pope also expends large sums in&nbsp;the maintenance of the people’s schools, managed entirely by laymen, and also under government inspection. For education of the&nbsp;higher grade, besides the regular lyceums and gymnasiums, there&nbsp;are many private schools similarly designated from which pupils&nbsp;can present themselves for the regular government examinations,</span></p>
