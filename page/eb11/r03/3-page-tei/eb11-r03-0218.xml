This principle has even been carried to the extent of recognizing several bishops having jurisdiction over the adherents of various rites in the same see; thus there are three uniat patriarchs of Antioch (Graeco-Melchite, Maronite and Syrian).</p><p>Exact statistics of the membership of the Churches of the Oriental rite are almost impossible to obtain; the numbers of their adherents, moreover, are apt to vary suddenly with the shifting currents of political forces in the East, for political factors have always played a considerable part in these movements towards reunion or the reverse. In 1908 their numbers were estimated at approximately 5,500,000. The Churches of the Oriental rite fall under four main divisions: Greek, Armenian, Syrian, Coptic; and—with the exception of the Armenian—these are again subdivided according to nationality or to peculiarities of cult or language. The Churches may be further grouped according to the character of their constitution, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>  (1) those having their own rite only in a restricted sense, since they have no hierarchy of their own but are subordinate to Latin bishops, <hi rend="italic">i.e,</hi>  the Greeks in Italy <hi rend="italic">(Italograeci), </hi>the scattered Bulgarian Uniats, the Abyssinians, some of the Armenians and the “Christians of St Thomas”; (2) those having their own bishops and sometimes their own metropolitans, as in Austria-Hungary; (3) the Eastern patriarchates.</p><p>Geographically, the Uniat Churches may be grouped as follows:—</p><p>(A) <hi rend="smallcaps">Europe,</hi>  where their association with the Roman Church is at once the oldest and the most intimate. .</p><p>(1)    The <hi rend="italic">Itolograeci.</hi>  These are distributed in scattered groups throughout ltaly, but are most compact in Apulia and Sicily, and number in all some 50,000. They are under the jurisdiction of the Latin diocesan bishops, but their priests are ordained by bishops of their own rite specially appointed by the pope.</p><p>(2)    The Uniat Churches of Austria-Hungary. With the exception of the Armenian, these are all of the Greek rite, but are divided according to nationality and ritual language Intothefollowinggroups: —(a) <hi rend="italic">Ruthenian Church.—</hi>This, though still the most important numerically of all the Uniat Churches, is but a fragment of the Church which proclaimed its union with Rome at the synod of Brest in Lithuania in 1596, a union which, after long and bitter resistance, was completed by the submission of the dioceses of Lemberg and Luzk in 1700 and 1702. The Church was broken up by the successive partitions of Poland, and those parts of it which fell to Russia were, notably under Catherine II. and Nicholas I., forcibly absorbed into the Orthodox Church.. The Church, however, still numbers some 3,000,000 adherents in Galicia, and 500,000 in Hungary. In Galicia it has an independent organization under the Greek-Catholic archbishop of Lemberg, with two suffragan sees: Przemysl, for West Galicia, and Stanislawov for East Galicia. In Hungary there are two bishoprics, Munkacz and Eperies, under the Latin primate of Hungary, the archbishop of Gran. The Serb bishopric of Kreutz in Croatia, under the Latin archbishop, of Agram, may be also grouped with the Ruthenian Church, since the rite is identical. Its adherents number from 15,000 to 20,000. The liturgical language of the Uniat Slav Churches is Old Slavonic, and, so far as their rite is concerned, they differ from the Orthodox Slav Churches only in using the Glagolitic instead of the Cyrillic alphabet, <hi rend="italic">(ft) Rumanian Church-This</hi>  numbers about 1,000,000 adherents and has its own organization under the metropolitan of FogaVasch or Alba Jul ia<hi rend="sub">;</hi>  with* three suffragan sees: Lugos<hi rend="sub">1</hi>  Gross-Wardein and Szamoe-Uvj âr. It has had its own ritual language since the 17th century, (c)<hi rend="italic">Armenian Church.—</hi>This numbers in Austria-Hungary only some 4000 to 5000 members, lt has an archbishopric at Lemberg, which has jurisdiction also over the Uniat Armenians at Venice.</p><p>(3)    Uniat Churches in Russia and Turkey in Europe, <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi>  In Russia the Uniat Ruthenian Church (see above) ceased to. exist with the incorporation* of the little Polish diocese of Chlem in the Orthodox Russian Church under Alexander II. in 1875. The Holy See, however, has never withdrawn its claim to jurisdiction over it, nor have the Ruthenians ever been wholly reconciled to their absorption in the Russian Church. The <hi rend="italic">ukaz</hi>  of Nicholas II. (Easter, 1905), granting liberty of worship, produced a movement in the direction of Rome; but this appears to have been, checked by the refusal of the government, even now, to recognize in Russia a Roman Catholic Church of the Greek rite. Converts to Rome have, therefore, to accept the Latin rite (see Prince Max of Saxony, <hi rend="italic">Vorlesungen über aie orientalischen Kirchenfragen<hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  1907). The scattered communities of the Uniat Armenian Church in Russia are subordinate to Latin vicars apostolic. The Uniat Armenian Church in the Caucasus, however, is under the jurisdiction of the patri</p><lb/><p>archate of Cilicia, <hi rend="italic">(b)</hi>  In European Turkey the Uniat Churches are represented by tiny groups, scattered about the Balkan Peninsula, attached to Latin ” missions.” The movement in favour of the union of the Bulgarian Church with Rome,, which grew up in i860, was the outcome of the national opposition to the Greeks, and with the establishment of the Bulgarian exarchate in 1872 it died away. There are not more, than 10,000 to 15,000 Uniat Bulgarians, who have been ruled since 1883 by three vicars apostolic. The Uniat Armenians and Melchites in Constantinople belong to the Eastern patriarchates.</p><p>(B) <hi rend="smallcaps">Asia and Africa.</hi>—The Uniat Churches in Asia and Africa occupy a peculiar position in so far as Rome has recognized the traditional rights of the patriarchates (see, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>  Leo XIll.*s encyclical <hi rend="italic">Praeclara gratulationis</hi>  of June 1894), and they therefore enjoy almost complete autonomy; thus the patriarchs nominate their own suffragans and have the right to summon synods for specific purposes (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Patriarch).</hi></p><p>There are six Uniat Patriarchates :—</p><p>(1)    The <hi rend="italic">Patriarchatus . Ciliciae Arrnenorurn.</hi>  The Armenian patriarch, whose jurisdiction embraces the Catholic Armenians in the Balkan Peninsula, in Russian Armenia and in Asiatic Turkey, formerly resided in Lebanon, but has had his seat since 1867 at Constantinople. Under him are 19 dioceses, including a small one in Persia. The number of Catholic Armenians under his jurisdiction is, roughly, 100,000 (sec <hi rend="smallcaps">Armenian Church).</hi></p><p>(2)    The three patriarchates of Antioch, (a) The Melchite <hi rend="italic">CPatri-archatus Antiochcnus Graeco-Melchitarum).</hi>  The patriarch resides in the monastery of Ain-Traz in the Lebanon ana has jurisdiction over all the Uniats of Greek nationality in the Turkish Empire, who number about 120,000.

The number of Christians of St Thomas in the obedience of Rome is said to be about 100,ooo.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>· (W. A.

But the term is inoffensive to Roman Catholics, since it advertises their claim that communion with the see of Rome is of the essence of Catholicity, and to Protestants, since it serves to emphasize the fact that the religion of modern Rome differs widely in many important respects from that of the undivided medieval Church. The change has brought both good and evil. Protestant controversialists have some show of reason on their side when they argue that Luther saved the Roman Church by forcing it to put an end to many intolerable abuses. On the other hand, under stress of his revolt the papacy could not but develop in a strongly anti-Protestant direction, laying exaggerated emphasis on every point he challenged. The more fiercely he denounced 'infallibility, the confessional, the sacramental system, the larger these things bulked in the eyes of Rome.</p><p>Not that this cçnsequence showed itself at once.
