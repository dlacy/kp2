               <p>                   <label>ROSSE, WILLIAM PARSONS</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">3rd Earl of
                        (1800-1867), Irish astronomer and telescope constructor, was born at York on
                        the 17th of June 1800, a son of the 2nd earl (see above). Until his father’s
                        death he was known as Lord Oxmantown. Entered at Trinity College, Dublin, in
                        1818, he proceeded to Magdalen College, Oxford, in 1821, and in the same
                        year he was returned as M.P. for King’s County, a seat which he resigned in
                        1834. He was Irish representative peer from 1845, president of the British
                        Association in 1843, president of the Royal Society from 1849 to 1854, and
                        chancellor of the university of Dublin from 1862. From 1827 he devoted
                        himself to the improvement of reflecting telescopes; in 1839 he mounted a
                        telescope of 3 ft. aperture at his seat, Birr Castle, Parsons town; and in
                        February 1845 his celebrated 6-foot reflector was finished. Owing to the
                        famine and the disturbed state of the country, which demanded his attention
                        as a large landowner and lieutenant of King’s County (from 1831), the
                        instrument remained unused for nearly three years, but since 1848 it has
                        been in constant use, chiefly for observations of nebulae, for which it was
                        particularly suited on account of its immense optical power, nominally 6000.
                        Lord Rosse died at Monkstown on the 31st of October 1867. He had four sons.
                        The eldest, Lawrence Parsons, 4th earl of Rosse, and Baron Oxmantown, born
                        on the 17th of November 1840, succeeded to the title on his father’s death,
                        and made many investigations on the heavenly bodies, particularly on the
                        radiation of the moon and related physical questions; the youngest, the Hon.
                        Charles Algernon Parsons, born oh the 13th of June 1854, is famous for his
                        commercial development of the steam turbine.</hi>
               </p>               <p>The first constructor of reflecting telescopes on a large scale, Wiliam
                    Herschel, never published anything about his methods of easting and polishing
                    specula, and he does not appear to have been very successful beyond specula of
                    18 in. diameter, his 4-foot speculum (“ the 40-foot telescope ”) having been
                    little used by him (see discussion between Sir J. Herschel and Robinson in <hi
                        rend="italic">The Athenaeum,</hi> Nos.. 831-36, 1843). Lord Rosse had
                    therefore no help towards his brilliant results. His speculum metal is composed
                    of four atoms of copper (126*4 parts) and one of tin (58*9 parts), a brilliant
                    alloy, which resists tarnish better than any other compound tried. Chiefly owing
                    to the brittleness of this material, Lord Rosse’s first larger specula were
                    composed of a number of thin plates of speculum metal (sixteen for a 3-foot
                    mirror) soldered on the back of a strong but light framework made of a peculiar
                    kind of brass (2*75 of copper to 1 of zinc), which has the same expansion as his
                    speculum metal. In Brewster’s <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Journal of
                        Science</hi> for 1828 he described his machine for polishing the speculum,
                    which in all essential points remained unaltered afterwards. It imitates the
                    motions made in polishing a speculum by hand by giving both a rectilinear and a
                    lateral motion to the polisher, while the speculum revolves slowly; by shifting
                    two eccentric pins the course of the polisher can be varied at will from a
                    straight line to an ellipse of very small eccentricity, and a true parabolic
                    figure can thus be obtained. The speculum lies face upwards in a shallow bath of
                    water (to preserve a uniform temperature), and the polisher fits loosely in a
                    ring, so that the rotation of the speculum makes it revolve also, but more
                    slowly. Both the grinding and polishing tools are grooved, to obtain a uniform
                    distribution of the emery used in the grinding process and of the rouge employed
                    in polishing, as also to provide for the lateral expansion of the pitch with
                    which the polisher is coated. In September 1839 a 3-foot speculum was finished
                    and mounted on an altazimuth stand similar to Herschel’s; but, though the
                    definition of the images was good (except that the diffraction at the joints of
                    the speculum caused minute rays in the case of a very bright star), and its
                    peculiar skeleton form allowed the speculum to follow atmospheric changes of
                    temperature very quickly, Lord Rosse decided to cast a solid 3-foot speculum.
                    Hitherto it had been felt as a great difficulty in casting specula that the
                    solidification did not begin at one surface and proceed gradually to the other,
                    the common sand mould allowing the edges to cool first, so that the central
                    parts were subject to great straining when their time of cooling came, and in
                    large castings this generally caused cracking. By forming the bottom of the
                    mould of hoop iron placed on edge and closely packed, and the sides of sand,
                    while the top was left open, Lord Rosse overcame this difficulty, and the hoop
                    iron had the further advantage of allowing the gas developed during the cooling
                    to escape, thus preventing.the speculum from being full of pores and cavities.
                    This invention secured the success of the casting of a solid 3-foot speculum in
                    1840, and encouraged Lord Rosse to make a speculum of 6 ft. diameter in 1842. In
                    the beginning of 1845 this great reflector was mounted and ready for work. The
                    instrument has a focal length of 54 ft. and the tube is about 7 ft. in diameter;
                    owing to these large dimensions it cannot be pointed to every part of the
                    heavens, but can only be moved a short distance from the meridian and very
                    little to the north of the zenith; these restrictions have, however, hardly been
                    felt, as there is almost at any moment a sufficient number of objects within its
                    reach.</p>               <p>From 1848 to 1878 it was but with few interruptions employed for observations of
                    nebulae (see Nebula); and many previously unknown features in these objects were
                    revealed by it, especially the similarity of “ annular ” and “ planetaiy ”
                    nebulae, and the remarkable “ spiral ” configuration prevailing in many of the
                    brighter nebulae. A special study was made of the nebula of Orion, and the
                    resulting large drawing gives an extremely good representation of this
                    complicated object. (See Telescope.)</p>               <p>Lord Rosse gave a detailed account of the experiments which step by step had led
                    to the construction of the 3-foot speculum in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philosophical Transactions</hi> for 1840. In the same publication for 1844
                    and 1850 he communicated short descriptions and drawings of some of the more
                    interesting nebulae, and in the volume for 1861 he published a paper “ On the
                    Construction of Specula of 6-ft. Aperture, and a Selection from the Observations
                    of Nebulae made with them,” with numerous engravings. The accounts'of the
                    observations given in these papers, however, were fragmentary; but in 1879-80 a
                    complete account of them was published by the present earl (“ Observations of
                    Nebulae and Clusters of Stars made with the 6-foot and 3-foot Reflectors at Birr
                    Castle from 1848 to 1878 ”) in the <hi rend="italic">Scient. Trans. R. Dublin
