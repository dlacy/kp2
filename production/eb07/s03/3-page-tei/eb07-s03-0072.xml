on the clenches, the clenches always gave way ; but with the forelocks it as frequently occurred that the forelock was cut off as that the bolt broke ; and in the cases of the bolt breaking, it was invariably across the forelock hole. According to the tables, the security of a forelock is about half that of a clench.</p><p>“ It appears an anomaly that the strength of a clench on copper should be equal to that of one on iron. But, in consequence of the greater ductility of copper, a better clench is formed on it than on iron. Generally the thickness of the fractured clench in the copper was double that in the iron. With rings of the usual width for the clenches, the wood will break away under the ring, and the ring be imbedded for two or more inches before the clench will give way.</p><p>“With the inch copper bolts, all the rings under the clenches turned up into the shape of the frustum of a cone, and allowed the clench to slip through at the weights specified.</p><p>“ Experiments with ring-bolts were made to ascertain the strength of the rings in comparison with the clenches. The rings were of the usual size, viz. the iron of the ring one eighth inch less in diameter than that of the bolt. It was found that the rings always carried away the clenches, but that they were drawn into the form of a link with perfectly straight sides. The rings bore, before any change of form took place, not quite one half the weight which tore off the clenches. It appears that the rings are well proportioned to the strength of the clenches.</p><p><hi rend="italic">“ Table of the Transverse Strength of Treenails of English Ooh used as fastening for Plonks of three and of six inches in thickness, and subjected to a Strain, as shown to be applied in fig.</hi> 58.</p><table><row><cell>Number of the Experiment.</cell><cell cols="16">Diameter of the Treenails.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell cols="4">1 Inch.</cell><cell cols="4">1¼ Inch.</cell><cell cols="4">1½ Inch.</cell><cell cols="4">1¾ Inch.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell cols="16">Thickness of the Plank.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell cols="2">3 In.</cell><cell cols="2">6 In.</cell><cell cols="2">3 in.</cell><cell cols="2">6 In.</cell><cell cols="2">3 In.</cell><cell cols="2">6 In.</cell><cell cols="2">3 In.</cell><cell cols="2">6 In.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>T.</cell><cell>C.</cell><cell>T.</cell><cell>C.</cell><cell>T.</cell><cell>C.</cell><cell>T</cell><cell>C<hi rend="italic">.</hi></cell><cell>T.</cell><cell>C.</cell><cell>T.</cell><cell>C.</cell><cell>T.</cell><cell>C.</cell><cell>T.</cell><cell>C.</cell></row><row><cell>1</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>7</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>14</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>12</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>10</cell></row><row><cell>2</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>7</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>15</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>2</cell><cell><hi rend="italic">2</hi></cell><cell>2</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>13</cell></row><row><cell>3</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>17</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>19</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>15</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>0</cell></row><row><cell>4</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>5½</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>12</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>5</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>12</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>15</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>18</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>0</cell></row><row><cell>6</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>7</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>9</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>7</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>7</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>12</cell></row><row><cell>8</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>7</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>13</cell></row><row><cell>9</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>12</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>13</cell></row><row><cell>10</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>15</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>0</cell></row><row><cell>11</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>7</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>9</cell><cell><hi rend="italic">2</hi></cell><cell>18</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>o</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>8</cell></row><row><cell>12</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>7</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>5</cell><cell>0</cell></row><row><cell>13</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>16</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>17</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>0</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>18</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>5</cell></row><row><cell>Average</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>11</cell><cell>1</cell><cell>13</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>6</cell><cell><hi rend="italic">2</hi></cell><cell>6</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>16</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>2</cell><cell>3</cell><cell>10</cell><cell>4</cell><cell>6</cell></row></table><p>“ In all these experiments on treenails, when the treenails were evidently good, they gave way gradually. In some of the rejected experiments, however, the treenails certainly did break off suddenly, but then they were evidently on examination either had or over-seasoned treenails. It is no uncommon remark in caulking down the bottom of a vessel, that the caulkers break off the treenails by caulking, and that they hear them crack or break off suddenly. Now I do not believe that this cracking of the treenails takes place so frequently as it is supposed. What the men hear is the starting of the plank on the different fastenings. It has been asserted that the treenails made from the Sussex oak are much stronger than those made from the New Forest timber, or any other English oak. To ascertain the truth of this assertion, some experiments were made with Sussex and New Forest treenails of all sizes ; and the result was, that there was not the least difference in them, the New Forest were on experiment quite as strong as the Sussex.</p><p>“ In the experiments on treenails, the plank generally moved about half an inch previous to the fracture of the treenail.”	<hi rend="smallcaps">(b. z.)</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SHIPSTON-on-Stour,</hi> a town of the hundred of Oswaldslow, in the county of Worcester, but detached from it, and surrounded by Gloucestershire.
