<p><span class="font0">In the bamboo-rats, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhizomys,</span><span class="font0"> from the Indo-Malay countries, China and Tibet, as well as in the closely allied East African&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tachyoryctes,</span><span class="font0"> the eyes are, however, functional, and the head is&nbsp;rounded. (See Mole-Rat.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to the arrangement here followed, the burrowing zokors may be placed in this family, although they have teeth like&nbsp;those of the vole group in the Muridae. The first representative&nbsp;of this sub-group is the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Siphneus</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Myotalpa),</span><span class="font0"> of which&nbsp;some five Central and North Asiatic species are known. They&nbsp;are characterized by the mole-like form and long, powerful, front&nbsp;claws (fig. io). In the true zokors </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ellobius),</span><span class="font0"> on .the other hand,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the claws are short and the general form more vole-like. Of three named species, one extends from South Russia to Siberia, while&nbsp;two others are respectively from Kurdistan and Afghanistan. A&nbsp;third type, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prometheomys,</span><span class="font0"> from the Caucasus, is represented by a&nbsp;species of the size of a small water-rat, chestnut-brown in colour,&nbsp;with lighter feet, and the minute eyes covered with skin. The teeth&nbsp;are nearest to those of the true zokors </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ellobius).</span><span class="font0"> The single&nbsp;example was taken under flowering anemones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Malagasy Rats.</span><span class="font0">—On account of certain structural peculiarities, the rats of Madagascar, which have a dentition like that of the&nbsp;ericetine Muridae, are separated as a distinct family, Ncsomyidae.&nbsp;They are the only rodents in that island. Of these, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hypogeomys</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;a large, long-tailed, fawn-coloured rat, with large ears and feet;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nesornys</span><span class="font0"> is a red species, with long hair; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Brachytarsornys</span><span class="font0"> is shortfooted and long-tailed, with velvety fawn fur; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hallomys</span><span class="font0"> has&nbsp;elongated hind feet, as has also </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Macrotarsomys; Gymnuromys</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;naked-tailed; and the several species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eliurus</span><span class="font0"> are dormouselike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mouse Tribe.—</span><span class="font0">The characteristics of the Muridae are those of the Myoidea generally, as given above under the heading of the&nbsp;Spalaeidae. With the exception of Madagascar, the family, which&nbsp;may be divided into six sub-families, has a cosmopolitan distribution,&nbsp;and the genera are so numerous that only some of the most important can be even mentioned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first group is that of the hamsters, or cricetines (Cricetinae), in which the molars are rooted and tuberculated, with the cusps of&nbsp;the upper ones arranged in two longitudinal rows (fig. 13, B);&nbsp;in the upper teeth the outer cusps and in the lower the inner ones are&nbsp;the higher, and when worn the crown surfaces show oblique dentine-areas; in shape the third molar is like the second, but it is smaller.&nbsp;The infra-orbital foramen is generally narrow, and the tympanic&nbsp;bulla hollow. The humerus has a foramen at the lower end. The&nbsp;tail is short. The group is typified by the European hamster </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Cricetus&nbsp;vulgaris</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. Cricetus),</span><span class="font0"> to which a separate article is devoted (see&nbsp;Hamster); the genus includes a number Ofspeciesrangedunder&nbsp;several sub-genera, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mesocricetus, Cricetutus,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Urocricetus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">widely. spread in Western and Central Asia, the last-mentioned,&nbsp;which is from Tibet, being distinguished by its relatively long tail.&nbsp;The hamsters all possess cheek-pouches, which are, however, absent&nbsp;in many of the following genera. Africa claims only a single&nbsp;representative of the group, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mystromys,</span><span class="font0"> with one southern and one&nbsp;eastern species. Persia is the home of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Calomyscus</span><span class="font0"> (with one species),&nbsp;a near relative of the American </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Peromyscus.</span><span class="font0"> In America, where&nbsp;the more typical kinds are known as white-footed, or deer, mice,&nbsp;the cricetines absolutely swarm, and include a host of genera, the&nbsp;majority of which are North American, although others are peculiar&nbsp;to Central and South America. Among these may .be named&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Onychomys, Peromyscus, Rhipidomys, Holochilus</span><span class="font0"> (which is South&nbsp;American and includes the largest species), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sigrnodon</span><span class="font0"> (typified by the&nbsp;North American rice-rat, 5. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hispidus), Oryzomys, Rhithrodontamys&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(with grooved incisors), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyomys</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anotomys</span><span class="font0"> (fish-eating,&nbsp;aquatic forms, from the mountains of South America), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acodon,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the North American wood-rats, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Neotoma,</span><span class="font0"> in which the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">molars have a structure simulating that of the under-mentioned Microtinae. A distinct sub-family, Lophiomyinae, is represented by&nbsp;the Central African arboreal spiny rats, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lophiomys,</span><span class="font0"> of which there,&nbsp;are two or three species. Although agreeing with the Cricetinae in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the hollow tympanic bullae, they have the clavicles imperfect, the first front toe opposable to the rest, the temporal region of the&nbsp;skull roofed with bone, and the crowns of the molars with cusps&nbsp;arranged in rows but eventually covered by a layer of enamel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The third sub-family is that of the Mierotinae, or voles, which are distributed all over Europe, Northern Asia and North America, and&nbsp;are characterized by the tympanic bulla of the skull being filled with&nbsp;honey-combed bony tissue, the small size of the infra-orbital foramen,&nbsp;and the deep pterygoid fossa on the palatal aspect. The humerus&nbsp;lacks a foramen at the lower end; and the molar teeth, as explained&nbsp;and IllustratedinthearticleVoLE </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> consist of two Iongit udinalrows&nbsp;of triangular alternating vertical prisms, and may be either rootless&nbsp;or rooted. Voles, as typified by the water-rat and the tailed field-mouse, are stouter built and shorter-nosed rodentsthan the typical rats&nbsp;and mice, with smaller ears and eyes and shorter tails; all being good&nbsp;burrowers. In the circumpolar </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evotomys</span><span class="font0"> (represented in England&nbsp;by the red-backed field-mouse) and the nearly allied North American&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phenacomys,</span><span class="font0"> the molars develop roots in old age; but in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Microtus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(which includes the water-rat, and is circumpolar) they are rootless&nbsp;throughout life, the genus being one of the largest in the mammalian&nbsp;class (see Vole). </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fiber—</span><span class="font0">the muskrats—is a North American aquatic&nbsp;type (see Muskrat), characterized by the compression of the tail.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Synaptomys</span><span class="font0"> is also North American, and characterized by the grooved</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">upper incisors and the presence of distinct enamel-loops on the outer side of the lower molars. The circumpolar lemmings of the genera&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lemmus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dicrostonyx</span><span class="font0"> are noticed in the article Lemming.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ellobius,</span><span class="font0"> which many naturalists place in this group, has been&nbsp;mentioned among the Spalaeidae.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
