                <p><label>SAFETY-LAMP</label>, a form of lamp, used especially in mines, which is so
                    constructed that it will burn without igniting a gaseous explosive mixture by
                    which it is surrounded. To effect this end, the flame is encircled with a
                    protecting metal case which is perforated with numerous small holes. Through
                    these air for feeding the flame can enter freely and the products of combustion
                    escape; but the flame or gases cannot pass out at a sufficiently high
                    temperature to cause the ignition of the explosive mixture outside, because on
                    arriving at the perforations they give up much of their heat to the large
                    metallic surface they encounter, by which it is conducted away. In 1816 Sir
                    Humphry Davy discovered the suitability of wire gauze as the material of the
                    metal case, when the substance of the wire was rightly proportioned to the size
                    of the aperture. The standard adopted as the limit for safety at that time was a
                    gauze of 28 iron wires to the linear inch, having 784 apertures per square inch,
                    but in some lamps the apertures are occasionally made still smaller.</p>
                <p>The common safety or Davy lamp consists of a small cylindrical oil lamp, covered
                    with a cylinder of wire gauze about 6 in. long and 1 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="sub">2</hi> in. in diameter, with a flat gauze top. The upper part of
                    the gauze is doubled to prevent it from being worn into holes by the products of
                    combustion, and the air for feeding the flame enters round the wick. The gauze
                    is mounted in a cage, consisting of three upright wires, screwed into a flat
                    brass ring at each end. A handle is attached to the upper ring, while the lower
                    one screws on to a collar on the oil-vessel of the lamp. When the two parts are
                    screwed together the lamp is locked by a bolt passing through both parts, which
                    is screwed down flush with or below the surface of the outer ring, so that the
                    gauze cannot be removed without the use of a key.</p>
                <p>In Stephenson's safety-lamp, generally known as the “ Geordie ” from its inventor
                    George Stephenson, the light is covered by a glass chimney, surrounded by an
                    outer casing and top of wire gauze. The feed air is admitted through numerous
                    small holes in a copper ring a little below the level of the wick. This is one
                    of the safest forms of lamp, but requires considerable care in use, especially
                    in keeping the small feed holes clear from dust and oil; the glass protects the
                    gauze from becoming overheated, and when the air is dangerously charged with gas
                    the light is extinguished.</p>
                <p>In the lamp invented by Dr W. Reid Clanny (1776-1850) about the same time as
                    those of Davy and Stephenson, a glass cylinder is substituted for the lower
                    portion of the wire gauze. The air for supplying the flame, entering at the
                    bottom of the gauze and passing down the inner side of the glass, protects the
                    latter to some extent from becoming overheated, but a large amount of light is
                    lost by absorption in the glass, so that there is no great advantage over the
                    ordinary Davy lamp to compensate for the extra weight and cost, especially as
                    the safety property of the lamp depends upon the glass cylinder, which may be
                    readily broken when subjected to the ordinary accidents of working. A more
                    perfect form of lamp of the same character is that of Mueseler, which is
                    extensively used in Belgium. It differs from Clanny’s lamp by the addition of a
                    conical chimney above the flame, which produces a rapid draught, and
                    consequently a more perfect cooling of the glass cylinder by the downflow of
                    feed air for the flame.</p>
                <p>The safety of the Davy lamp is endangered by exposure to a current of gas moving
                    at more than 6 ft. a second, as the flame is then liable to be forced through
                    the gauze, and the Clanrty and Stephenson lamps are not safe in currents
                    exceeding 8 and 10 ft. respectively. These early forms have therefore been
                    improved and modified to meet the requirements of safety in air-currents
                    travelling at a high velocity. In the Hepplewhite-Gray lamp there is a conical
                    glass surrounding the light, with a gauze chimney, pro-tected by an outer metal
                    cylinder; the air supply to the flame is carried downwards through three tubes
                    forming the standards of the cage. This lamp, in addition to giving a good light
                    overhead owing to the shape of the glass, is peculiarly sensitive to gas, and
                    therefore valuable in testing for fire-damp. Other approved lamps arc the
                    Deflector and those of Marsaut and Mueseler when specially bonneted to resist
                    extra high-speed currents. The illuminant now generally used in Great Britain is
                    a mixture of rape oil with half its volume or more of petroleum, which is more
                    suitable than vegetable or animal oil alone. In Germany, and also in America,
                    Wolf’s lamp, burning benzoline or petroleum spirit upon an asbestos wick, is
                    very popular as giving a much better light than oil. Special care is, however,
                    required in filling, so that no free liquid may be left in the holder; the
                    spirit must be entirely absorbed by a filling of sponge, and any superfluous
                    quantity poured off. Portable electric lamps, supplied by accumulators or dry
                    batteries, have been introduced into coal-mines; but owing to the weight and
                    cost their use is as yet very restricted.</p>
                <p>The ordinary safety-lamp affords indications of the presence of fire-damp (marsh
                    gas) in the air of a mine. When the amount exceeds 2 or 2 <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                    / <hi rend="sub">2</hi> %, it may be detected by reducing the flame till it is
                    practically non-lumionous, when a pale blue flame or luminous cap will be seen
                    above the ordinary flame. This varies in size with the percentage of fire-damp,
                    until when there is about 10% the blue flame fills the whole interior of the
                    gauze cylinder. If the lamp is allowed to remain too long in such a fiery
                    atmosphere, it becomes dangerous, because the gauze, becoming heated to redness,
                    may fire the external gas. For detecting the presence of fire-damp in amounts
                    less than 2 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> / <hi rend="sub">2</hi> %, special lamps with
                    non-luminous flames are adopted. In Pieler’s lamp, which is of the ordinary Davy
                    form, alcohol is burned on a silk wick, and a screen is provided so that the
                    flame can be hidden. When exposed in air containing <hi rend="sup">1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="sub">4</hi> % a cap of 1⅜ in. is formed, which increases to 2 in. with
                        <hi rend="sup">1</hi> / <hi rend="sub">2</hi> %, and with 1 <hi rend="sup"
                        >1</hi> /4 % the lamp is filled with a deep blue glow. Another and more
                    useful method is that of Dr F. Clowes, who uses a hydrogen flame o∙4 in. long,
                    obtained by attaching a cylinder containing compressed hydrogen to an ordinary
                    safety-lamp. When used for gas testing the hydrogen is turned into the oil
                    flame, which is for the time extinguished, and relighted when the observation is
                    finished. So small a proportion as o∙2 % of gas can be detected by this
                    method.</p>
                <p>The locking of safety-lamps, so as to render them incapable of being opened by
                    the miners when at work, is a point that has given play to a large amount of
                    ingenuity. One of the most favourite devices is a combination of the wick-holder
                    with the locking bolt, so that the latter cannot be withdrawn without lowering
                    the wick and extinguishing the flame. Another method consists in the use of a
                    lead rivet, uniting the two parts of the lamp, impressed with a seal, which
                    cannot be removed without defacing the device. All this class of contrivances
                    have the defect of only being efficacious when the miners are not provided with
                    matches or other means of obtaining a light. A more physically perfect method is
                    that adopted by Bidder, where the locking bolt is magnetized and held in place
                    by a force which can only be overcome by the application of a battery of heavy
                    and powerful steel magnets. These are kept in the lamp cabin at the pit bottom,
                    where the lamps are cleaned and served out lighted to the miners at the
                    commencement of the shift, and are collected before they return to the çurface.
