<p><span class="font0">RUSCIUD, a small river of Persia, which falls into the Persian Gulf, forty-eight miles west of Ormus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSCSUK, or Rusdschuk, a city of Turkey in Europe, and of the district of Silistria. It is situated on the river&nbsp;Danube, at the point where the Kara Lom falls into that&nbsp;great stream. It is fortified, and has extensive suburbs,&nbsp;a fortress, nine mosques, several Greek and Armenian&nbsp;churches, some Jewish synagogues, and a great number of&nbsp;baths. It has 6000 houses, and is supposed to contain&nbsp;30,000 inhabitants, who make linen, woollen, cotton, and&nbsp;silk goods, and carry on extensive trade by the river. Lat.&nbsp;43. 51. 3.

<p><span class="font0">RUSH, Benjamin, a celebrated American physician, born on the 5th of January 1745, near Bristol, in Pennsylvania, was descended from a family who were originally Quakers, and who had accompanied Penn, in 1683, to his infant colony.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He lost his father at an early age, and having been first placed by his mother at a school kept by the Rev. S. Finley,&nbsp;he proceeded to finish his classical education at the college&nbsp;of Princeton, and there took a degree of bachelor of arts before he was sixteen. He then determined to make the profession of physic the pursuit of his life, and went to study it,&nbsp;first under the care of Dr Redman of Philadelphia, and then&nbsp;at Edinburgh, where he was created a doctor of physic in&nbsp;1768. At the time of his return from Europe, a new school&nbsp;of medicine was about to be founded in Philadelphia, and&nbsp;he became professor of chemistry immediately upon his&nbsp;arrival. In 1776, he began to take an active part, with the&nbsp;rest of his countrymen, in the political struggle of the day,&nbsp;and he was chosen a member of congress for the state of&nbsp;Pennsylvania ; in 1777 he was appointed surgeon-general to&nbsp;the army, and not long afterwards became physician-general. He also contributed his best efforts to the improvement&nbsp;of the internal government of the state which he represented. But he soon withdrew his attention from political affairs, in order to devote it exclusively to medical and literary subjects ; and he continued to be actively engaged in&nbsp;the practice of physic for the remainder of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1776 he married Miss Julia Stockton of New Jersey. He had by her thirteen children, nine of whom survived&nbsp;him in respectability and prosperity. In 1791, when the&nbsp;two medical colleges of Philadelphia were incorporated into&nbsp;a single university, he was appointed professor of the institutes of medicine, and of clinical practice. In 1793, he&nbsp;greatly distinguished himself by the new and apparently&nbsp;successful modes of practice that he introduced in the epidemic yellow fever, which was then causing great mortality&nbsp;throughout the United States ; and which, shortly before&nbsp;his death, he was induced to believe not contagious, but&nbsp;derived from some general causes independently of the previous existence of the disease. He died on the 13th of&nbsp;April 1813, after an illness of five days, of a typhus fever,&nbsp;with some pulmonary symptoms. He had for a considerable part of his life been threatened with consumption, but&nbsp;had combated its attacks with unusual success. The number of his writings is considerable in proportion to their&nbsp;bulk ; the times and the state of society in which he lived&nbsp;being such as to produce rather hasty and spirited than&nbsp;highly finished compositions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His inaugural dissertation was entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De concoctione ciborum in ventricule,</span><span class="font0"> and contained an explanation&nbsp;of the opinions relating to digestion, which he had learned&nbsp;from Dr Cullen. Edinburgh, 1768.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inquiry into the Causes and Cure of Pulmonary&nbsp;Consumption, in his Medical Inquiries and Observations, i.&nbsp;Phil. 1788. His grand object, in the cure of consumption, is to recommend exercise, and every thing which&nbsp;will enable the patient to take exercise ; anticipating a&nbsp;practice which has become somewhat fashionable in England of late years, from its frequent success as a temporary&nbsp;palliative. The subject is continued in the second volume&nbsp;of the Inquiries, published in 1793 ; and bleeding is very&nbsp;strongly recommended in the earlier and only curable stages.&nbsp;Consumption, he observes, is common in America, though&nbsp;scrofula scarcely ever occurs ; and it has sometimes been&nbsp;known to be clearly communicated by infection to the negroes belonging to a family, who had, of course, no consanguinity that could account for a similarity of constitution. Five volumes, in the whole, of this collection, appeared from 1788 to 1798 ; a second edition was published in 1804, in four volumes 8vo ; a third in 1805, revised&nbsp;and enlarged, with a continuation of the Histories of the&nbsp;Yellow Fever from 1793 to 1809 ; a Defence of Bloodletting as a Remedy for Certain Diseases ; A View of the&nbsp;State of Medicine in Philadelphia ; An Inquiry into the&nbsp;Sources of the Usual Forms of Summer and Autumnal&nbsp;Diseases in the United States ; and the recantation of his&nbsp;opinion of the contagious nature of the yellow fever, already&nbsp;mentioned.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Essays, Literary, Moral, and Philosophical, 1798, 8vo,&nbsp;containing a republication of the last article, together with&nbsp;the author’s Eulogiums on Dr Cullen and on Professor Rit-tenhouse, delivered in 1790 and 1796, and with some other&nbsp;miscellaneous papers of less moment. 1806.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;History of the Yellow Fever, 1794. This celebrated work has been translated into French and Spanish. At&nbsp;the time of its publication, an almost superstitious dread&nbsp;was entertained by medical men of the use of the lancet&nbsp;in idiopathic fever ; and few books have ever had so powerful and extensive an effect in altering the general treatment of a disease as this history had produced in every&nbsp;part of the world. Probably, indeed, it may have carried a&nbsp;number of the younger and bolder practitioners into an&nbsp;opposite extreme ; but, with respect to the author’s claims</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
