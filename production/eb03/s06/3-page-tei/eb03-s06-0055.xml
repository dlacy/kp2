It is not improbable that it was known to the ancient Jews ; for there is ſome reaſon to ſuppoſe, that the Hebrew word קנה, which occurs frequently in the Old Teſtament, and is by our tranſlators rendered ſometimes <hi rend="italic">calamus</hi> and ſometimes <hi rend="italic">ſweet-cane,</hi> does in fact mean the sugar-cane. The firſt paſſage in which we have obſerved it mentioned is Exod. xxx. 23. where Moſes is commanded to make an ointment with myrrh, cinnamon, kené, and caſſia. Now the kené does not appear to have been a native of Egypt nor of Judea; for in Jeremiah vi. 20. it is mentioned as coming from a fat country. “ To what purpoſe cometh there to me incenſe from Sheba and the ſweet-cane from a far country ?” This is not true of the calamus aromaticus, which grows ſpontaneouſly in the Levant, as well as in many parts of Europe. If the cinnamon mentioned in the paſſage of Exodus quoted above was true cinnamon, it muſt have come from the Eaſt Indies, the only country in the world from which cinnamon is obtained. There is no difficulty therefore in ſuppoſing, that the ſugar-cane was exported from the ſame country. If any credit be due to etymology, it confirms the opinion that kené denotes the ſugar-cane ; for the Latin word <hi rend="italic">canna</hi> and the Engliſh word <hi rend="italic">cane</hi> are evidently derived from it. It is also a curious fact, that sachar or <hi rend="italic">ſkeker</hi> @@*, in Hebrew, ſignifies <hi rend="italic">inebriation,</hi> from which the Greek word σαϰχαρ “ ſugar ’ is undoubtedly to be traced.</p><p>The ſugar cane was firſt made known to the weſtern parts of the world by the conqueſts of Alexander the Great. Strabo@@* relates that Nearchus his admiral found it in the Eaſt Indies in the year before Chriſt 325. It is evidently alluded to in a fragment of Theophraſtus, preſerved in Photius. Varro, who lived A. C. 68, deſcribes it in a fragment quoted by Iſidorus @@* as a fluid preſſed from reeds of a large ſize, which was ſweeter than honey@@*. Dioſcorides, about the year 35 before Chriſt, ſays “ that there is a kind of honey called <hi rend="italic">ſaccharon,</hi> which is found in India and Arabia Felix. It has the appearance of ſalt, and is brittle when chewed. If diſſolved in water, it is beneficial to the bowels and ſtomach, is uſe ul in diſeases of the bladder and kidneys, and, when ſprinkled on the eye, removes thoſe ſubſtances that obscure the ſight.<hi rend="superscript">-</hi>” This is the firſt account we have of its medical qualities. Galen often preſcribed it as a medicine. Lucan relates, that an oriental nation in alliance with Pompey uſed the juice of the cane as a common drink.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Quique bibunt tenera dulces ab arundine ſuccos.</hi></p><p>Lib. iii. 237.</p><p>Pliny ſays it was produced in Arabia and India, but that the beſt came from the latter country. It is alſo mentioned by Arrian, in his Periplus of the Red Sea, by the name of Σαχαϑ (sachar) as an article of commerce from India to the Red Sea. AElian @@*, Tertullian @@*, and Alexander Aphrodisaeus @@*, mention it as a ſpecies of honey procured from canes @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p><p>That the ſugar-cane is an indigenous plant in ſome parts of the Eaſt Indies, we have the ſtrongeſt reaſon to believe ; for Thunberg found it in Japan, and has accordingly mentioned it as a native of that country in his <hi rend="italic">Flora Japonica, </hi>published in. 1784. Oſbeck alſo found it in China in 1751. It may indeed have been tranſplanted from ſome other country ; but as it does not appear ſrom hiſtory that the inhabitants of Japan or China ever carried on any commerce with remote nations, it could only be conveyed from ſome neighbouring country. Marco Polo, a noble Venetian, who travelled into the Eaſt about the year 1250, found ſugar in abundance in Bengal. Vaſco de Gama, who doubled the Cape of Good Hope in 1497, relates, that a conſiderable trade in ſugar was then carried on in the kingdom of Calicut. On the authority of Dioſcorides and Pliny, too, we ſhould be diſpoſed to admit, that it is a native of Arabia, did we not find, on conſulting Niebuhr’s Travels, that that botaniſt has omitted it when enumerating the moſt valuable plants of that country. If it be a ſpontaneous production of Arabia, it muſt ſtill flouriſh in its native soil. Mr Bruce found it in Upper Egypt. If we may believe the relation of Giovan Lioni, a conſiderable trade was carried on in ſugar in Nubia in 1500 : it abounded alſo at Thebes, on the Nile, and in the northern parts of Africa, about the ſame period.</p><p>There is reaſon to believe that the ſugar-cane was introduced into Europe during the crusades ; expeditions which however romantic in their plan, and unſucceſsful in their execution, were certainly productive of many advantages to the nations of Europe. Albertus Aquenſis, a monkiſh writer, obſerves, that the Chriſtian ſoldiers in the Holy Land frequently derived refreſhment and ſupport during a ſcarcity of proviſions by ſucking the canes. This plant flouriſhed alſo in the Morea, and in the iſlands of Rhodes and Malta ; from which it was tranſported into Sicily. The date of this tranſaction it is not eaſy to aſcertain ; but we are ſure that ſugar was cultivated in that iſland previous to the year 1166 ; for Lafitau the Jeſuit, who wrote a hiſtory of the Portugueſe diſcoveries, mentions a donation made that year to the monaſtery of St Bennet, by William the ſecond king of Sicily, of a mill for grinding ſugar-canes, with all its rights, members, and appurtenances.</p><p>From Sicily, where the ſugar-cane ſtill flouriſhes on the ſides of mount Hybla, it was conveyed to Spain, Madeira, the Canary and Cape de Verd iſlands, ſoon after they were diſcovered in the 15th century@@.</p><p>An opinion has prevailed, that the ſugar-cane is not a native of the weſtern continent, or its adjacent iſlands the West Indies, but was conveyed thither by the Spaniards or Portugueſe ſoon after the diſcovery of America by Columbus. From the teſtimony of Peter Martyr, in the third book of his firſt decade, compoſed during Columbus’s ſecond voyage, which commenced in 1493 and ended in 1497, it appears, that the ſugar-cane was known at that time in Hiſpaniola. It may be ſaid, that it was brought thither bv Columbus ; but for this aſſertion we have found no direct evidence; and though we had direct evidence, this would not prove that ths ſugar-cane was not an indigenous plant of the West Indies. There are authors of learning who, after inveſtigating this ſubject with attention, do not hesitate to maintain, that it is a native both of the iſlands and of the continentof America.</p><p>P. Labat has ſupported this opinion with much appearance of truth @@*; and, in particular, he appeals to the teſtimony of Thomas Gage, an Engliſhman, who viſited New Spain in 1625. Gage enumerates sugar-canes among the proviſions with which the Charaibes of Guadaloupe ſupplied his ſhip. “ Now (ſays Labat) it is a fact that the Spaniards had never cultivated an inch of ground in the Smaller Antilles. Their ſhips commonly touched at thoſe iſlands indeed ſor wood and water ; and they left swine in the view of ſupplying with freſh proviſions such of their countrymen as might call there in future ; but it would be abſurd in the</p><p>@@@[m]*שבד</p><p>@@@[m]* Lib. xv.</p><p>@@@[m]* Lib xvii. cap. 7.</p><p>@@@[m]* Mattbioli Dios. cap. lxxv.</p><p>@@@[m]* Nat.
