                hesitation in answering that, as transactions of daily life, they&nbsp;must all have
                been more or less familiar. It does not follow, however, that they were already
                regulated by law and protected by the&nbsp;ordinary tribunals. The historical
                jurists are pretty well agreed&nbsp;that not only the real contracts of loan
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(mutuum</span><span
                class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >commodatum),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">deposit, and pledge, but also the
                consensual ones of sale, location,&nbsp;partnership, and mandate, and the verbal one
                of suretyship, were&nbsp;as yet very barely recognized by law. Sale was the
                offspring of&nbsp;barter,—of instant exchange of one thing for another. With
                such&nbsp;instant exchange there was no room for obligation to deliver
                on&nbsp;either side, even when the ware </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">(merx)</span><span class="font0"> given by one of the
                parties&nbsp;was so much rough copper weighed in the scales. The
                substitution&nbsp;of coined money for the raw metal can hardly have effected
                any&nbsp;radical change: the ordinary practice of those early times must&nbsp;still
                have been ready-money transaction,—an instant exchange of&nbsp;ware for price ; and
                it can only have been when, for some reason&nbsp;or other, the arrangement was
                exceptionally for delivery or payment at a future date, say next market day, that
                obligation was&nbsp;held to have been created. Was that obligation enforcible by
                the&nbsp;civil tribunals ? Some jurists hold that it was,—that at no time&nbsp;were
                the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span
                class="font0"> contracts outside the protection of judicial&nbsp;remedies, although
                by a simpler procedure than that resorted to for&nbsp;enforcement of the contracts
                of the jus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">civile.</span><span
                class="font0"> But two provisions&nbsp;in the XII. Tables seem to prove very clearly
                that it was not so&nbsp;enforcible. The first is one recorded by Justinian,— that,
                where&nbsp;a thing was sold and delivered, the property, nevertheless, was
                not&nbsp;to pass until the price had been paid or sureties </span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(nodes)</span><span class="font0"> for it
                accepted&nbsp;by the vendor. Far from being a recognition of the
                obligatory&nbsp;nature of the transaction, this provision is really a recognition of
                the&nbsp;inability of the law to enforce payment of the price by the vendee
                ;&nbsp;it is a declaration that, on the latter’s failure to pay, the
                vendor,&nbsp;unprotected by any personal action, should be entitled to get
                back&nbsp;the thing sold as still his own, no matter in whose hands he
                found&nbsp;it. The second related to the case of a person who had bought
                a&nbsp;victim for sacrifice, but had failed to pay for it. A real action
                for&nbsp;its revindication by the seller after it had been consumed on
                the&nbsp;altar was out of the question ; so he was authorized by the Tables,&nbsp;by
                the process of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pignoris capio
                (supra,</span><span class="font0"> p. 686), at his own hand to&nbsp;appropriate in
                satisfaction a sufficient equivalent out of the belongings of the purchaser, against
                whom he had no personal action.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It was a principle of the law of Rome through the whole of its
                history, though in course of time subject to&nbsp;an increasing number of
                exceptions, that mere agreement&nbsp;between two persons did not give him in whose
                favour it&nbsp;was conceived a right to demand its enforcement. To&nbsp;entitle a
                man to claim the intervention of the civil tribunals to compel implement of an
                engagement undertaken by another, it was necessary (subject to those exceptions)
                either that it should be clothed in some form&nbsp;prescribed or recognized by the
                law, or that it should be&nbsp;accompanied or followed by some relative act which
                rendered it something more than a mere interchange of consent.&nbsp;Under the
                jurisprudence of the XII. Tables the formalities&nbsp;required to elevate an
                agreement to the rank of contract&nbsp;and make it civilly obligatory sometimes
                combined ceremonial act and words of style, sometimes did not go beyond&nbsp;words
                of style, but ill all cases took place before witnesses.&nbsp;</span><span

        <p><span class="font1">frequent in Rome during the first two centuries of the republic are
                more frequently attributed by the historians&nbsp;to the abuses of the law of debt
                than to any other cause,&nbsp;social or political. The circumstances of the poorer
                plebeians were such as to make it almost impossible to avoid&nbsp;borrowing. Their
                scanty means were dependent on the&nbsp;regular cultivation of their little acres,
                and on each operation of the agricultural year being performed in
                proper&nbsp;rotation and at the proper season. But this was every&nbsp;now and again
                interfered with by wars which detained&nbsp;them from home at seed-time or harvest,
                practically rendering their farms unproductive and leaving them and
                their&nbsp;families in straits for the commonest necessaries of life.&nbsp;A poor
                peasant, in such a case, had no alternative but to&nbsp;apply to a capitalist for a
                loan. But it was not to be had&nbsp;without security, and rarely without interest.
                It was not&nbsp;that the lender doubted the borrower’s honesty and willingness to
                repay his debt; it was rather that there was every&nbsp;chance that next year a
                fresh war might again interfere&nbsp;with the latter’s agricultural operations,
                leave him again&nbsp;without a crop, and thus render repayment impossible.&nbsp;And
                so, while interest accumulated and was periodically&nbsp;added to capital, new loans
                had year after year to be contracted as long as any acres remained that could serve
                as&nbsp;a security; failing all things, the debtor had to impledge&nbsp;or

                borrower who failed in repayment. How&nbsp;Servius subjected it to much the same

                witnesses for their testimony. Unfortunately this formula is nowhere preserved.

                speaker,&nbsp;formulate it thus—“ quod ego tibi mille libras hoc aere&nbsp;aeneaque
