            <p>In this way we might amplify examples, and it should not escape notice that we have
                to deal chiefly with substantives, with few adjectives and hardly any verbs.@@<hi
                    rend="sup">1</hi></p>
            <p>In precisely the same way the Spanish vocabulary must have been seamed with traces of
                Iberian elements. But the process of elimination took place more rapidly and
                thoroughly in this case, so that the number of Iberian or Celtic-Iberian words that
                have resisted time and change is small. On a Latin inscription from Spain we find
                    <hi rend="italic">Faramus<hi rend="sub">t</hi></hi> “ plain,” and <hi
                    rend="italic">paramo</hi> occurs to this day in this sense. As the lberian does
                not know the sound <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the word cannot be Iberian, and must be
                Celtic.</p>
            <p>In Isidore we find <hi rend="italic">baia,</hi> “ bay,” which should be read <hi
                    rend="italic">baia, </hi>as Sp. and Port, <hi rend="italic">bahia</hi>
                prove—doubtless an Iberian word, since Fr. <hi rend="italic">baie</hi> and Ital.
                δα/aare forms quite recently borrowed from Spanish. This <hi rend="italic">baia</hi>
                is perhaps somehow connected with the place-name Bayona. Again, 'the <hi
                    rend="italic">lapides lausiae</hi> of the Lex Metalli Vipascensis are Celtic
                rather than lberian (cf. Sp. <hi rend="italic">losa,</hi> Port, <hi rend="italic"
                    >lousa,</hi> as well as Prov. <hi rend="italic">lausa,</hi> Piedm. <hi
                    rend="italic">losa). .</hi> Considering our ignorance of Iberian, and the
                pronounced colouring of Basque by Spanish words, it is not often easy to decide on
                which side the indebtedness lies when we meet with a word in Spanish and Basque
                whose etymology is still uncertain.</p>
            <p>Much discussion centres round the question as to how far the pre-Romanic nations
                influenced the phonology of the Romans in the process of their assimilation.
                Opinions are strongly divergent. While G. I. Ascoli has repeatedly assumed
                influences of this kind on a large scale, the present writer is very sceptical.@@<hi
                    rend="sup">2 </hi>It may be well to give the essential points.</p>
            <p>Plautus uses <hi rend="italic">distennite</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dispennite</hi>.
                instead of <hi rend="italic">distendite</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >dispendite—iorrns</hi> he imported from his native Umbria. And like the
                Umbrians, the Oscans too pronounced <hi rend="italic">nn</hi> instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">nd. </hi>Later we find this same change throughout the whole of
                south and central Italy, and even in Rome, whereas it is not observed in Tuscany,
                north Italy and other Romanic countries. We may therefore confidently assume that
                this is due to a reaction of the Oscan-Umbrian dialects. Similarly it is in
                accordance with Umbrian pronunciation to convert breathed plosives into voiced after
                nasals, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> IMewga = Lat. <hi rend="italic">fuvenca*,</hi>
                and similarly we have <hi rend="italic">Hngue</hi> in central and south Italy beside
                Tusc. <hi rend="italic">cinque (quinque). </hi>But even in this particular the
                change affects not only the regions of ancient Umbria, but also those of the Oscans
                and Messapians, though again it must be admitted that we do not know what
                the pronunciation of the ancient Messapians was. And finally, we find the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> represented in Umbrian between vowels by a sound which has
                a separate sign in the national alphabets and which in Latin is reproduced as <hi
                    rend="italic">-rs.</hi> And since the Paelignan alphabet too has a sign for a
                modified <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> one may perhaps assume that in these districts
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> had a specialized sound as <hi rend="italic">th,</hi>
                or <hi rend="italic">r;</hi> and this view agrees with the fact that in the dialects
                of central and southern Italy <hi rend="italic">d</hi> was pronounced sometimes like
                r, sometimes like <hi rend="italic">th.</hi> And probably this sums up all we can
                say with certainty.</p>
            <p>It has always been maintained that French <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (pronounced as
                German w), derived from <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> Js due to the influence of Gallic.
                    The <hi rend="italic">u</hi> (with modern sound) is identified with the whole
                area of the French language except part of the Walloon, part of French Switzerland,
                and Piedmont, Genoa, Lombardy, the Grisons, Tirol and the northern part of the
                Emilia, but not Friuli, Venetia and Istria. On the other hand, the ancient <hi
                    rend="italic">ü</hi> became <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in Cymric, to which w must
                be regarded as an intermediary step, that may therefore have existed in Gallic. But
                in the first place we must observe that Greek writers always render the Gallic <hi
                    rend="italic">u</hi> by <hi rend="italic">ου,</hi> never by r; that the Romans
                too write w, never <hi rend="italic">y</hi> ; and further, that over a large part
                of the area <hi rend="sup">j</hi>W came in comparatively recently. Secondly, in
                Gallic inscriptions the combination CT is frequently replaced by XT, so that the
                Irish pronunciation<hi rend="italic">cht</hi> (Ir. <hi rend="italic">nocht, “</hi>
                night ”) is as old as Ancient Gallic. /Xnd since the preliminary stage of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Fr. fait Horn factum, nuit</hi> from <hi rend="italic">node,</hi>
                is likewise <hi rend="italic">cht,</hi> it is natural to suppose a relation between
                these facts, and all the more because the Iberian Peninsula on the one hand, and a
                large part of the western and central area of upper Italy on the other, show an
                identical process; but in Venetian, central and southern Italy <hi rend="italic"
                    >ct</hi> became <hi rend="italic">tt.</hi> Thirdly, nasalized vowels are in
                evidence chiefly in the ancient seats of the Celts—in northern and southern France,
                in Piedmont, Genoa, Lombardy and partly in Raetia, also in Portugal, but not as far
                as southern Emilia. At this point again evidence from the Gallic fails completely.
                Finally, an attempt has been made to trace back the general characteristics of the
                French and the Gallo-Romanic dialects of Italy to the peculiarities of the Gallic
                accent. It is assumed that there was a decided stress-accent, which brought about an
                over-emphasis of the stressed syllable at the expense of the unaccented ones, with
                the result of a marked weakening of the unaccented vowels, and particularly of those
                following the stressed syllable. Here again we can only say that Gallic itself
                affords no evidence for this assumption, and that, on the contrary, this peculiar
                accentuation maybe due to other reasons, unknown to us. To turn to morphology, the
                method of enumerating—as we find it, for example, in Fr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >quatre-vingts, &amp;c.— </hi>would seem to be Gallic, since it is common to all
                the Celts.</p>
            
            <p>But even if we admit certain regional variations, all these-were overlaid by an “
                Average Latin ” which presents a number of essential features uniformly over the
                whole area, and which differed from the literary language. These characteristics (in
                historical sequence) are as follows: (i) Loss of final <hi rend="italic">m</hi> in
                polysyllabic words (which we find exemplified in the very oldest inscriptions); (2)
                loss of-the <hi rend="italic">h-</hi> sound, a loss which outside, the towns was of
                great antiquity (cf. <hi rend="italic">anser),</hi> and at the beginning of imperial
                times was fairly common; (3) loss of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> before <hi
                    rend="italic">s</hi> coupled with the lengthening of the vowel, for which Varro
                is evidence in his alternations of <hi rend="italic">mensa</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">mesa</hi> ; (4) the assimilation of <hi rend="italic">rs</hi> to
                    <hi rend="italic">ss—e.g. sussum </hi>from <hi rend="italic">sursum</hi> (Ital.
                    <hi rend="italic">suso,</hi> O..Fr. <hi rend="italic">sus.</hi> Mod. Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">dessus).</hi> Toward the end of the Republic <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> is lost before <hi rend="italic">u—e.g. </hi><hi rend="italic">vius</hi>
                instead of <hi rend="italic">vivus, rius</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic"
                    >rivus</hi> (Ital. Sp. <hi rend="italic">rio), anticus</hi> instead of <hi
                    rend="italic">antiquus </hi>(ltal. <hi rend="italic">antico).</hi> In the. first
                century a.d. <hi rend="italic">b</hi> became <hi rend="italic">v</hi> between
                vowels, thus merging itself into the. latter sound, so that in examining the Romance
                languages it is impossible to decide whether the original was <hi rend="italic"
                    >v</hi> or <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> And this change spreads in sentences to
                the initial δ (as in the inscription <hi rend="italic">manduca vibe lude e beni at
                    me),</hi> which leads in some cases to some uncertainty in the use of <hi
                    rend="italic">v</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b. </hi>And lastly, we have the case
                of <hi rend="italic">cl</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tl—e.g. veclus</hi> (Ital. <hi
                    rend="italic">vecchio, </hi>Fr. <hi rend="italic">vieil,</hi> Sp. <hi
                    rend="italic">viefo.</hi> Port, <hi rend="italic">velha,</hi> Rum. <hi
                    rend="italic">viechvu)</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">Vetulus*,</hi>
                the reduction of <hi rend="italic">di</hi> before vowels, of <hi rend="italic">j,
                    g</hi> before <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> /, and of <hi rend="italic">z</hi> to a
                single sound <hi rend="italic">j,</hi> or rather <hi rend="italic">dj,</hi> in
                consequence of which we have <hi rend="italic">diurnum </hi>(Ital. <hi rend="italic"
                    >giorno,</hi> Fr. <hi rend="italic">jour) ; juvenis</hi> (Ital. <hi
                    rend="italic">giovane, Fr. jeune)*, gêner</hi> (Ital. gewero, Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">gendre)*, Zelosus</hi> ’(Ital. <hi rend="italic">geloso</hi>, Fr.
                    <hi rend="italic">jaloux),</hi> all represented by the same initial.</p>
            <p>To turn to vowels, we must first notice that, according to Varro, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ae</hi> was pronounced <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in the country, but that in the
                cities the diphthong was maintained at first, while the simple sound was only
                admitted during the course of the ist century a.d. If this is an instance of an
                early spreading of a rustic pronunciation, we have in another case a victory for
                that of the bourgeoisie and aristocracy. <hi rend="italic">O</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">au</hi> belongs, to Umbrian, Volscian and vulgar Latin,
                which explains why Appius Claudius Pulcher changed his name to Clodius when he
                deserted the. patricians and went over to the plebeians. And there is other evidence
                of this change of sound. But in the inscriptions of the Empire <hi rend="italic"
                    >0</hi> for <hi rend="italic">au</hi> is very rare, save in proper names, and
                the Romance languages have partly preserved the <hi rend="italic">au</hi> to
                this day with little or no change (cf. Rum. <hi rend="italic">auzt,</hi> Prov. <hi
                    rend="italic">auzir,</hi> Port. <hi rend="italic">ouvir</hi> from <hi
                    rend="italic">audire),</hi> or only changed it to <hi rend="italic">0</hi> at a
                later stage (cf. Fr. <hi rend="italic">chose,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">ch</hi>
                could only have arisen before <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> not <hi rend="italic"
                    >0),</hi> so that one may assume that the “ Average Latin ” always preserved the
                    <hi rend="italic">au.</hi></p>
            <p>Then, without entering into detail, we must mention the prothesis of <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> before.j/, <hi rend="italic">sp, sc, a</hi> phenomenon
                which arose, judging from the inscriptions, in the 2nd century A.D. We find it at
                the beginning of the sentence, and also within it after consonants, but not
                after vowels; <hi rend="italic">e.g. illa spata,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">illas
                    ispatas*, istâre, istâ,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">tu istâs,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Most important of all are the modifications that affect the accented vowels, which
                give a new look to the language as a whole. In Old Latin and even towards the end of
                the Republican age, vowels varied solely according to their quantity, <hi
                    rend="italic">e.g. ä</hi> was longer than <hi rend="italic">a, e </hi>longer
                than <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> but the vowel sound was the same, or at any rate
                the difference in quality between long and short must have been quite insignificant,
                seeing that Cicero and Quintilian wished the word <hi rend="italic">divisio</hi> to
                be avoided in speech from motives of decorum, because of the likeness in sound to
                    <hi rend="italic">Vissio. </hi>Quantity was not influenced by the number of.the
                consonants following: <hi rend="italic">actus</hi> was pronounced with factus with
                    <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> &amp;c. . In the course of the ist
                century approximately quality was differentiated in addition to quantity in all
                vowels except <hi rend="italic">a—</hi>short vowels being pronounced with an
                open, long ones with a close, sound. The written language expresses this change by
                writing ae for <hi rend="italic">e, i</hi> for <hi rend="italic">e, e</hi> for 1,
                    <hi rend="italic">u</hi> for <hi rend="italic">0, 0</hi> for u. In
                addition there are statements of the grammarians, though they mention only the
                double pronunciation of <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">0,</hi> not
                that of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u.</hi> It was probably in
                the course of the 4th century that the further change took place, by which all
                vowels were lengthened before a single consonant, and shortened before two or more,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g. sitis </hi>became <hi rend="italic">sltis,</hi> while <hi
                    rend="italic">tectum</hi> became <hi rend="italic">tectum.</hi> But the older
                qualitative variations were maintained so that even now <hi rend="italic">sltis</hi>
                and <hi rend="italic">vitis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tectum</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">lfâum</hi> did not contain the same vowel-sound, the former having
                a close, the latter an open, vowel. (Cf. Ital. <hi rend="italic">sete, vite,</hi>
                    Fr. <hi rend="italic">soif, vis,</hi> Sp <hi rend="italic">sed, vid\</hi> or
                Ital. <hi rend="italic">tgtto</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lgtta,</hi> Fr. <hi
                    rend="italic">toit</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lit.)</hi> It is at the end. of
                the 4th century that Augustine says: <hi rend="sup">u</hi>Afrae aures de corruptionc
                vocalium vcl productione non judicant,” and the uncertain.practice of the poets in
                the matter of quantity points to the breaking down oFthe old conditions. This was
                not the end of the process of development; but the most important stages
                were already accomplished. In this, too, we are concerned with changes affecting the
                whole Romance region. The final step was taken when open <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and
                close <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> open wand close <hi rend="italic">0,</hi>
                Werereduced to one sound which may. be called close <hi rend="italic">e</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">o).</hi> This step was not taken by the eastern regions, excepting
                as to <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> and Sardinia remained completely unaffected <hi
