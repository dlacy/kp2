<p><span class="font2">staff; and the system under which the records are left in local repositories and the staff is centralized. There are of course&nbsp;countries which cannot be brought under either of these formulae. But for the most part it will be found that the second&nbsp;system has prevailed; there arc a central office for records of&nbsp;state, provincial offices for legal records and those of local&nbsp;administration, town offices for municipal records, and a staff&nbsp;of archivists depending more or less strictly upon the central&nbsp;office. In England the first system has been preferred ; almost all&nbsp;the records that can be collected have been gathered into the&nbsp;central office. In the future, indeed, it is inevitable that collections of administrative records should grow up for each county;&nbsp;but there is at present no means of ensuring their arrangement and preservation. Many towns possess old and valuable&nbsp;collections of municipal archives, and over these also the central&nbsp;office has no control. It would be absurd to affirm that such&nbsp;control is needed for the preservation of the documents; but it is&nbsp;a curious fact that the English government, which has centralized&nbsp;records more freely than any other, should have refrained from&nbsp;establishing any system of administration for records in general.&nbsp;The following article is intended to give a full account of the&nbsp;administration and nature of the records of Great Britain, and&nbsp;brief notices of those of other countries concerning which information is obtainable. It may be noticed that the directory of the&nbsp;learned world published by Triibner at Strassburg under the&nbsp;title </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Minerva</span><span class="font2"> will be found a useful guide to the situation and&nbsp;staff of repositories of records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most important repository of English records is the Public Record Office, Chancery Lane, London, established under the&nbsp;Act 1 &amp; 2 Vict., c. 94. The head of the office is the Master of&nbsp;the Rolls for the time being; and the staff consists of the deputy-keeper, secretary, assistant-keepers and clerks, with a subordinate&nbsp;staff.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Until the establishment of this office, the records of the various courts of law and government offices were stored in separate&nbsp;places, mostly of an unsuitable nature, whose contents were&nbsp;inaccessible and unknown. The Tower of London contained the&nbsp;records of the Chancery, which were kept in fair order; the records&nbsp;of the Exchequer were scattered in many places, chiefly unsuitable;&nbsp;and other collections were almost as unfortunately bestowed: the&nbsp;only attempt to provide a special place of custody was made in the&nbsp;17th century, when the State Paper Office was set up as a place of&nbsp;deposit for the papers of the secretaries of state. From time to&nbsp;time efforts were made, chiefly by means of committees of the&nbsp;House of Lords, to procure reforms in the custody of documents&nbsp;whose value was well understood. In the reign of Queen Anne,&nbsp;an attempt was made by Thomas Rymer to publish in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">such documents as could be found bearing upon foreign politics;&nbsp;and this drew fresh attention to the question of custody. In&nbsp;1731 the disastrous fire in the Cottonian Library produced a&nbsp;committee of the House of Commons and another report. But&nbsp;it was not until 1800 that any serious steps were taken. In that&nbsp;year a committee of the House of Commons presented a valuable&nbsp;report dealing with all the public records in repositories in England&nbsp;and Scotland. The result of this committee was the appointing&nbsp;of a royal commission charged with the arrangement and publication of the public records and the control of all public repositories.&nbsp;This commission was renewed from year to year and did not expire&nbsp;until 1837. It fell partly because of internal dissensions, but&nbsp;principally owing to gross extravagance and almost complete&nbsp;neglect of its duty, so far as the arrangement and custody of the&nbsp;records was concerned. The publications sanctioned by it are often&nbsp;badly designed and badly executed; but their most prominent&nbsp;characteristic was their expense. To this commission succeeded&nbsp;the Public Record Office, whose constitution has already been&nbsp;described. The first duty of the new office was the establishment&nbsp;of a central repository into which the scattered collections of records&nbsp;could be gathered; and the preparation of manuscript inventories&nbsp;of the documents so obtained. In 1851 the construction of the&nbsp;central repository was begun; and with the completion of each&nbsp;portion ot it further groups of records were brought in. At first&nbsp;only those collections specified in the act of parliament were dealt&nbsp;with; but in 1852 the State Paper Office was placed under the&nbsp;control of the Master of the Rolls, and its contents removed to the&nbsp;Public Record Office. Other government departments in turn&nbsp;transferred to the same keeping papers not in current use; and&nbsp;at present the only important collections of papers not so treated&nbsp;are those of the India Office and the Privy Council Office, which&nbsp;are still kept apart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The publications of the Record Office are of three kinds: reports, lists and indexes, and calendars. The reports are the annual&nbsp;reports of the Deputy Keeper, and now deal merely with the&nbsp;administrative work of the office; up to 1889 they also contained,&nbsp;in the form of appendices, inventories and detailed descriptions of&nbsp;various classes of records. In the present article these reports are&nbsp;referred to by number. The lists and indexes are either inventories&nbsp;of special classes with more or less detail, or indexes to the contents&nbsp;of certain documents grouped for that purpose; they are here&nbsp;cited by their number. The calendars are volumes containing full&nbsp;abstracts intended to make the consultation of the original document unnecessary except for critical purposes; they are equipped&nbsp;with full indexes. The contents of the Record Office are classified&nbsp;for the most part under the collections in which they were found.&nbsp;For a general account of the whole, see S. R. Scargill-Bird’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Handbook to the Public Records</span><span class="font1"> (3rd ed. 1908). No student can afford&nbsp;to neglect C. Gross's </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sources and Literature of English History&nbsp;from the Earliest Times to about 1485, </span><span class="font1">which contains much information&nbsp;as to books and articles based upon English records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We may now turn to the documents themselves, under the following heads:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exchequer Records.—The records of the administrative and judicial sides of the Exchequer (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font1">) are here described under its&nbsp;several divisions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1) Upper Exchequer, or Exchequer of Audit.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer’s Office, </span><span class="font1">οr office of final audit. The result of the final audit is recorded in duplicate on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pipe</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chancellor's Rolls.</span><span class="font1"> These consist of a solitary </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Pipe)</span><span class="font1"> roll for 31 Henry I.,&nbsp;and a duplicate series extending from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2</span><span class="font1"> Henry II. to 2 William IV.&nbsp;The Record Commission has printed the following rolls: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pipe&nbsp;Rolls,</span><span class="font1"> 31 Henry I., 2-4 Henry II., 1 Richard I.; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chancellor's Rolls,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">3 John. The Pipe Roll Society has printed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pipe Rolls</span><span class="font1"> for&nbsp;5-24 Henry II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Rolls or Rolls of Accounts.</span><span class="font1">—These contain the records of the preliminary audit of accounts other than county accounts&nbsp;of the sheriffs; they run from 42 Edward III. to modern times:&nbsp;closely connected with them are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enrolled Accounts,</span><span class="font1"> which dcaI&nbsp;with the more important accountants separately. It should be noted&nbsp;that the final audit is not recorded upon either </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foreign Rolls</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Enrolled Accounts,</span><span class="font1"> but must be sought on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pipe Roll,</span><span class="font1"> unless the&nbsp;accountant is found to be quit or to have a balance due to him.&nbsp;The Record Office has published a classified list (No. XI.) of the&nbsp;Foreign and Enrolled Accounts taken from all the foregoing rolls&nbsp;of audit, but omitting the accounts of Customs and Subsidies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Declared Accounts.—</span><span class="font1">A list (No. II.) of these records with an introduction has been published by the Record Office. The series&nbsp;begins in the 16th century, and from the 17th century is fairly&nbsp;complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Originalia Rolls</span><span class="font1"> (20 Henry III. to 1837), or extracts from the Chancery Rolls communicated to the Exchequer for its information&nbsp;and guidance. Latin abstracts of the rolls from Henry III. to&nbsp;Edward III. were printed by the Record Commission as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abbreviatio&nbsp;Rotulorum Originalium (2</span><span class="font1"> vols, folio).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer's Memoranda Rolls.—</span><span class="font1">These contain the letters received and issued by the Exchequer and&nbsp;notes of the general business of the department. They run from&nbsp;1 Henry III. to 1848. Edward Jones’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Index to the Records&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">contains a few scattered references to them; and many extracts&nbsp;will be found in the notes to Thomas Madox’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the&nbsp;Exchequer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Judicial.</span><span class="font1">—The only judicial proceedings on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer's</span><span class="font1"> side are in cases connected directly with the&nbsp;revenue. These are enrolled upon the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoranda Rolls;</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;for the period 35 Charles II. to William IV. there are Order </span><span class="font0">Books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(b) King's Remembrancer's Office,</span><span class="font1"> or office of preliminary audit. The most important financial records of this branch of&nbsp;the Exchequer are the class known as “ Exchequer K. R. accounts,&nbsp;&amp;c.,” which comprise vouchers and audited accounts of expenditure. Of similar accounts relating to receipts, the Escheator’s&nbsp;accounts have been listed in the 10th Report; but the inquisitions&nbsp;there described as filed with the accounts as vouchers are now&nbsp;kept separately, and are described with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chancery Inquisitions&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in the calendars. Accounts and vouchers relating to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Subsidies&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Customs</span><span class="font1"> are at present only described in manuscript (sec below&nbsp;under Special Collections).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">King's Remembrancer's Memoranda Rolls</span><span class="font1"> (1 Henry III. to 13 Victoria).—These run parallel with those of the Lord Treasurer&nbsp;and to a large extent contain the same matter. Adam Martin’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Index to Exchequer Records</span><span class="font1"> contains a certain number of references&nbsp;to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the reign of Edward VI., returns were made into the Exchequer by commissioners appointed to take inventories of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Church Goods.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Volumes of these for several counties are being published by the&nbsp;Alcuin Club (sec Mély et Bishop, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliographie générale des inventaires imprimés,</span><span class="font1"> vol. i. p. 245).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Judicial.</span><span class="font1">—The court of Exchequer on the King’s Remembrancer’s side was a court of equity held before the lord treasurer, the chancellor of the exchequer and the barons. The usual records of a&nbsp;court of equity. Bills and Answers, Decrees and Orders, Affidavits&nbsp;and other subsidiary documents exist for it. Martin’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Index to&nbsp;Exchequer Records</span><span class="font1"> contains references to the Decrees and Orders.</span></p>
