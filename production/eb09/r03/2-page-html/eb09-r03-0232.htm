        <p><span class="font2">Christians, and it is alleged by Armenian writers that he had been
                brought up and baptized among the Russians.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Rubruk and his party landed at Soldaia, or Sûdàk, on the Crimean
                eoast, a port which was then the chief seat of the communication between the
                Mediterranean states and what is now&nbsp;southern Russia. Equipped with horses and
                carts for the steppe,&nbsp;they travelled successively to the courts of Sartak and
                of Batû,&nbsp;respectively on the hither and further banks of the Volga,
                bandied&nbsp;from one to the other, and then referred to the Great Khan himself, an
                order involving the enormous journey to Mongolia. The&nbsp;actual travelling of the
                party from the Crimea to the khan’s court&nbsp;near Karakorum cannot have been, on a
                rough calculation, less&nbsp;than 5000 miles, and the return journey to Ayas in
                Cilicia would&nbsp;be longer by 500 to 700 miles. The chief dates to be gathered
                from&nbsp;the narrative are as follows :—embark on the Euxine, May 7, 1253
                ;&nbsp;reach Soldaia, 21 ; set out thence, June 1 ; reach camp of Sartak,&nbsp;July
                31 ; begin journey from camp of Bâtû eastward across steppe,&nbsp;September 16 ;
                turn south-east, November 1 ; reach Talas river,&nbsp;8 ; leave Cailac@@<sup>1</sup>
                (south of Lake Balkash), 30 ; reach camp of&nbsp;Great Khan, December 27 ; leave
                camp of Great Khan on or&nbsp;about July 10, 1254 ; reach camp of Bâtû again,
                September 16 ;&nbsp;leave Sartak’s camp, November 1 ; at the Iron Gate
                (Derbend)&nbsp;13 ; Christmas spent at Nakhshivan (under Ararat) ; reach Antioch
                (from Ayas, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">via</span><span
                class="font2"> Cyprus), June 29, 1255 ; reach Tripoli,&nbsp;August 15.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The camp of Batn was reached near the northernmost point of his
                summer marches, therefore about Ukek near Saratoff (see&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marco Polo,</span><span class="font2">
                Prol., chap. iii. note 4). Before the camp was left&nbsp;they had marched with it
                five weeks down the Volga. The point&nbsp;of departure would lie on that river
                somewhere between 48° and 50°&nbsp;N. lat. The route taken lay eastward by a line
                running north of&nbsp;the Caspian and Aral basins ; then from about 70° E. long,
                south&nbsp;(with some easting) to the basin of the Talas river ; thence
                across&nbsp;the passes of the Kirghiz Ala-tau and south of the Balkash Lake&nbsp;to
                the Ala-kul and the Baratula Lake (Ebi-nûr). From this the&nbsp;travellers struck
                north across the Barluk, or the Orkochuk&nbsp;Mountains, and thence, passing south
                of the modern Kobdo, to&nbsp;the valley of the Jabkan river, whence they emerged on
                the plain&nbsp;of Mongolia, coming upon the Great Khan’s camp at a spot
                ten&nbsp;days’ journey from Karakorum and bearing in the main south from&nbsp;that
                place, with the Khangai Mountains between.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">This route is of course not thus defined in the narrative, but is a
                laborious deduction from the facts stated therein. The key to&nbsp;the whole is the
                description given of that central portion intervening between the basin of the Talas
                and the Lake Ala-kul,&nbsp;which enables the topography of that region, including
                the passage&nbsp;of the Hi, the plain south of the Balkash, and the Ala-kul
                itself,&nbsp;to be identified past question.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The return journey, being made in summer, after retraversing the
                Jabkan valley,@@<sup>3</sup> lay much farther to the north, and passed&nbsp;north of
                the Balkash, with a tolerably straight course probably,&nbsp;to the mouths of the
                Volga. Thence the party travelled south by&nbsp;Derbend, and so by Shamakhi to the
                Araxes, Nakhshivan, Erzingan,&nbsp;Sivas, and Iconium, to the coast of Cilicia, and
                eventually to the&nbsp;port of Ayas, where they embarked for Cyprus and Syria.
                St&nbsp;Louis had returned to France a year before.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">We have alluded to Roger Bacon’s mention of Friar William of Rubruk.
                Indeed, in the geographical section of the </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Opus Majus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(c. 1262) he
                cites the traveller repeatedly and copiously, describing&nbsp;him as “frater
                Wilhelmus quem dominus rex Franciae misit ad&nbsp;Tartaros, Anno Domini 1253 ....
                qui perlustravit regiones&nbsp;orientis et aquilonis et Ioca in medio his annexa, et
                scripsit haec&nbsp;praedicta illustri régi ; quem Iibrum diligenter vidi et cum

                >(Opus Majus,</span><span class="font2"> ed. Jebb, 1733, pp. 190-191). Add&nbsp;to
                this William’s own incidental particular as to his being (like&nbsp;his precursor,
                Friar John of Pian Carpine, see vol. v. p. 132) a&nbsp;very heavy man </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(ponderosus valde),</span><span
                class="font2"> and we know no more of his&nbsp;personality except the abundant
                indications of character afforded&nbsp;by the story itself. These paint for us an
                honest, pious, stouthearted, acute, and most intelligent observer, keen in the
                acquisition of knowledge, the author in fact of one of the best narratives&nbsp;of
                travel in existence. His language indeed is Latin of the most&nbsp;un-Ciceronian
                quality,—dog-Latin we fear it must be called ; but,&nbsp;call it what we may, it is
                in his hands a pithy and transparent&nbsp;medium of expression. In spite of all the
                difficulties of communi-</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">cation, and of the badness of his </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">turgcmannus</span><span class="font2"> or
                    dragoman,@@<sup>4</sup> he gathered a mass of particulars, wonderfully true or
                near the truth,&nbsp;not only as to Asiatic nature, geography, ethnography,
                and&nbsp;manners, but as to religion and language. Of his geography a&nbsp;good
                example occurs in his account of the Caspian (eagerly caught&nbsp;up by Roger
                Bacon), which is perfectly accurate, except that he&nbsp;places the hill country
                occupied by the Mulahids, or Assassins, on&nbsp;the eastern instead of the southern
                shore. He explicitly corrects&nbsp;the allegation of Isidore that it is a gulf of
                the ocean : “ non est</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">verum quod dicit Ysidorus.....nusquam enim tangit oceanum,</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">sed undique circumdatur terra ” (265).@@<sup>5</sup> Of his interest
                and acumen in matters of language we may cite examples. The language of&nbsp;the
                Pascatir (or Bashkirds) and of the Hungarians is the same, as&nbsp;he had learned
                from Dominicans who had been among them (274).@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>The language of
                the Ruthenians, Poles, Bohemians, and Slavonians&nbsp;is one, and is the same with
                that of the Wandals, or Wends (275).&nbsp;In the town of Equius (immediately beyond
                the Ili, perhaps&nbsp;Aspara)@@<sup>7</sup> the people were Mohammedans speaking
                Persian, though&nbsp;so far remote from Persia (281). The Yugurs (or Uigurs) of
                the&nbsp;country about Cailac (see note above) had formed a language
                and&nbsp;character of their own, and in that language and character
                the&nbsp;Nestorians of that tract used to perform their office and write
                their&nbsp;books’ (281-2). The Yugurs are those among whom are found
                the&nbsp;fountain and root of the Turkish and Comanian tongue (289).&nbsp;Their
                character has been adopted by the Moghals. In using it&nbsp;they begin writing from
                the top and write downwards, whilst line&nbsp;follows line from left to right (286).
                The Nestorians say their&nbsp;service, and have their holy books, in Syriac, but
                know nothing of&nbsp;the language, just as some of our monks sing the mass
                without&nbsp;knowing Latin (293). The Tibet people write as we do, and&nbsp;their
                letters have a strong resemblance to ours. The Tangut&nbsp;people write from right
                to left like the Arabs, and their lines&nbsp;advance upwards (329). The current
                money of Cathay is of cotton&nbsp;paper, a palm in length and breadth, and on this
                they print lines&nbsp;like those of Mangu Khan’s </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">seal :—<sup>(i</sup> imprimunt lineas</span><span
                class="font2"> sicut est&nbsp;Sigillum Mangu ”—a remarkable expression. They write
                with a&nbsp;painter’s pencil and combine in one character several letters, forming
                one expression :—“ faciunt in una figura plures Iiteras compre-Iiendentes unam
                dictionem,”—a still more remarkable utterance,&nbsp;showing an approximate
                apprehension of the nature of Chinese&nbsp;writing (329).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Yet this sagacious and honest observer is denounced as an ignorant
                and untruthful blunderer by Isaac Jacob Schmidt (a man&nbsp;no doubt of useful
                learning, of a kind rare in his day, but narrow&nbsp;and wrong-headed, and in
                natural acumen and candour far inferior&nbsp;to the 13th-century friar whom he
                maligns), simply because the&nbsp;evidence of the latter as to the Turkish dialect
                of the Uigurs&nbsp;traversed a pet heresy, long since exploded, which Schmidt
                entertained, viz., that the Uigurs were by race and language
                Tibetan.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The narrative of Rubruk, after Roger Bacon’s copious use of it, seems
                to have dropped out of sight. It has no place in the famous collections of the
                14th&nbsp;century, nor in the earlier </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">Speculum Historiale</span><span class="font0"> of Vincent
                of Beauvais, which&nbsp;gives so many others of the Tartarian ecclesiastical
                itineraries. It first appeared&nbsp;imperfectly in Hakluyt (1600), as we have
                mentioned. But it was not till 1839&nbsp;that any proper edition of the text was
                published. In that year the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Recueil de&nbsp;Voyages</span><span class="font0"> of the Paris Geographical
                Society, vol. iv., contained a thorough edition&nbsp;of the Latin text, and a
                collation of the few existing MSS., put forth by M.&nbsp;D'Avezac, with the
                assistance of two young scholars, since of high distinction,&nbsp;viz.,
                Francisque-Michel and Thomas Wright. But there is no commentary, such&nbsp;as M.
                D’Avezac attached, in his own Incomparablefashion, to the edition of Friar&nbsp;John
                of Pian Carpine in the same volume ; nor has there ever been any
                properly&nbsp;annotated edition of a traveller so worthy of honour. Richthofen in

                class="font0">i. 602-604, has briefly but justly noticed the narrative of Rubruk. A

                instead of the Ctiu, which is a much smaller stream ;&nbsp;and other amendments have
                been derived from Dr F. M. Schmidt (see below).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the present writer interprets
                what Rubruk says :—“ Our going was in&nbsp;winter, our return in summer, and that by
                a way lying very much farther north,&nbsp;only that for a space of fifteen days’
                journey in going and coming we followed a&nbsp;certain river between mountains, and
                on these there was no grass to be found&nbsp;except close to the river.” The
                position of the Chagan Takoi or upper Jabkan&nbsp;seems to suit these facts best ;
                but Mr Schuyler refers them to the upper Irtish,&nbsp;and Dr F. Schmidt to the
