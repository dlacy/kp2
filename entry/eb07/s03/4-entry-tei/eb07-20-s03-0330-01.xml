. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Transylvania.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SIENNA</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Siena,</hi> a district of Italy, still called a duchy, though now a part of the grand duchy of Tuscany. It is mostly situated on the Apennines, and was an independent state, till it was subdued and united with Tuscany in 1557. The capital is the city of that name, on the great road from Florence to Rome. It is surrounded with walls, and, when approached from Rome, has a magnificent appearance, but, on the side towards Florence, the view of it is hidden by woods and gardens. The city is old and rather ill built, but it contains many fine palaces belonging to noble families. It is the see of an archbishop, the cathedral, 330 feet in length, is celebrated for its fine cupola. There is a spacious market-place, with a council house and theatre, that are ornamental. It contains twenty-three churches, several of which are adorned with the finest paintings in fresco. The university, founded in 1321, once enjoyed the greatest fame of any in Italy, but at present has not more than two hundred and sixty students, though it still retains its museum, an anatomical theatre, a library, and other similar institutions. Its manufactures are a few woollen cloths, hats, strings for musical instruments, paper, and objects formed of marble or of ivory. Its population is 24,500 persons. Lat. 43. 22. Long. 11. 5.
