<p><span class="font1">ROTIFERA. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotatoria)</span><span class="font1"> form a small, in many respects well-defined, but somewhat isolated class&nbsp;of the animal kingdom. They are here treated of separately, partly on account of the difficulty of placing them&nbsp;in one of the large phyla, partly on account of their&nbsp;special interest to microscopists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now familiarly known as “ wheel animalcules ” from the wheel-like motion produced by the rings of cilia which&nbsp;generally occur in the head region, the so-called rotatory&nbsp;organs, they were first discovered by Leeuwenhoek (I),@@<sup>1</sup> to&nbsp;whom we also owe the discovery of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bacteria</span><span class="font1"> and ciliate&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Infusoria.</span><span class="font1"> Leeuwenhoek described the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifer vulgams</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;1702, and he subsequently described </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Melicerta mngens</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;other species. A great variety of forms were described&nbsp;by other observers, but they were not separated as a class&nbsp;from the unicellular organisms </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Protozoa)</span><span class="font1"> with which&nbsp;they usually occur until the appearance of Ehrenberg’s&nbsp;great monograph (2), which contained a mass of detail&nbsp;regarding their structure. The classification there put&nbsp;forward by Ehrenberg is still widely adopted, but numerous observers have since added to our knowledge of the&nbsp;anatomy of the group (3). At the present day few groups&nbsp;of the animal kingdom are so well known to the micro-scopist, few groups present more interesting affinities to&nbsp;the morphologist, and few multicellular animals such a&nbsp;low physiological condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">General Anatomy.—</span><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifera</span><span class="font1"> are multicellular animals of microscopic size which present a coelom. They&nbsp;are bilaterally symmetrical and present no true metameric&nbsp;segmentation. A head region is generally well marked,&nbsp;and most forms present a definite tail region. This tail&nbsp;region has been termed the “pseudopodium.” Itvaries&nbsp;very much in the extent to which it is developed. It&nbsp;attains its highest development in forms like </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philodina,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which affect a Ieech-Iike method of progression and use it&nbsp;as a means of attachment. We may pass from this through&nbsp;a series of forms where it becomes less and less highly&nbsp;developed. In such forms as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brachionus</span><span class="font1"> it serves as a&nbsp;directive organ in swimming, while in a large number of&nbsp;other forms it is only represented by a pair of terminal&nbsp;styles or flaps. In the sessile forms it becomes a contractile pedicle with a suctorial extremity. A pseudopodium is entirely absent in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Asplanxhna, Tmarthra,&nbsp;Polyarthra,</span><span class="font1"> and a few other genera. The pseudopodium,&nbsp;when well developed, is a very muscular organ, and it may&nbsp;contain a pair of glands (fig. 2, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gl)</span><span class="font1"> which secrete an adhesive material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The surface of thebody is covered by a firm homogeneous structureless cuticle. This cuticle may become hardened&nbsp;by a further development of chitin, but no calcareous&nbsp;deposits ever take place in it. The cuticle remains softest&nbsp;in those forms which live in tubes. Among the free-living&nbsp;forms the degree of hardening varies considerably. In&nbsp;some cases contraction of the body merely throws the&nbsp;cuticle into wrinkles </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Notornmata, Asjdanchna)</span><span class="font1"> ; in others&nbsp;definite ring-like joints are produced which telescope into&nbsp;one another during contraction ; while in others again it&nbsp;becomes quite firm and rigid and resembles the carapace&nbsp;of one of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Entomostraxa</span><span class="font1"> ; it is then termed a “ Iorica. ”&nbsp;The Iorica may be prolonged at various points into spines,&nbsp;which may attain a considerable length. The surface may&nbsp;be variously modified, being in some cases smooth, in others</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

The curved spines of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philodina aculeata</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 1, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">g)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and the long rigid spines of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tmarthra</span><span class="font1"> are further developments in this direction. The so-called setæ of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Polyarthra</span><span class="font1"> on&nbsp;the other hand are more complex in nature, and are moved&nbsp;by muscles, and thus approach the “ limbs ” of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pedalion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Several genera present an external casing or sheath or tube which is termed an “ urceolus.” In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eloscularia</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stejohanxceros</span><span class="font1"> the urceolus is gelatinous and perfectly&nbsp;hyaline ; in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Conocfiilus</span><span class="font1"> numerous individuals live in such a&nbsp;hyaline urceolus arranged in a radiating manner.
