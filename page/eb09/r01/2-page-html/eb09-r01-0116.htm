The&nbsp;rudiments of the conceptions of tenure and of the crown&nbsp;as lord paramount were found in the old English system,&nbsp;and lænland was an antici]:&gt;ation of the limited interests&nbsp;which afterwards became of such importance.@@<sup>1</sup> The connexion of political privileges with the ownership of land&nbsp;is not peculiar to the pre-Conquest or any other period.&nbsp;It runs through the whole of English history. Originally&nbsp;all freeholders seem to have voted in the county court.&nbsp;Finally the Reform Acts of this century, however they&nbsp;may have lowered the qualification, still require (except&nbsp;in the case of the university vote) the vote to be derived&nbsp;from an interest in land. No amount of consols will give&nbsp;a vote at a parliamentary election. A qualification from&nbsp;land is also necessary in the case of sheriff, justices of the&nbsp;peace, and other public officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The elements of feudalism so far existed in England under the Anglo-Saxon and Danish kings as to make it&nbsp;easy to introduce it in full at the Norman Conquest.&nbsp;Feudalism was not so much a distinct and separate creation,&nbsp;developed at once in its maturity, as a collection of institutions whose origin was to be found in unconnected sources.&nbsp;What the Norman Conquest did was not to change all&nbsp;at once allodial into feudal tenure, but to complete the&nbsp;association of territorial with personal dependence in a&nbsp;state of society already prepared for it.@@<sup>2</sup> “Nulle terre sans&nbsp;seigneur” was one of the fundamental axioms of feudalism.&nbsp;There might be any number of infeudations and subinfeudations to mesne lords, but the chain of seigniory was&nbsp;complete, depending in the last resort upon the king as&nbsp;lord paramount. Land was not owned by free owners&nbsp;owing only necessary militia duties to the state, but was&nbsp;held of the king by military service of a far more onerous&nbsp;nature. The folkland became the king’s land ; the soldier&nbsp;was a landowner instead of the landowner being a soldier.&nbsp;Free owners tended to become tenants of the lord, the&nbsp;township to be lost in the manor.@@<sup>3</sup> The common land&nbsp;became in law the waste of the manor, its enjoyment resting upon a presumed grant by the lord. On the other&nbsp;hand, the whole of England did not become manorial ; the&nbsp;conflict between the township and the manor resulted in a&nbsp;compromise, the result of which affects English tenure to&nbsp;this day. But it was a compromise much to the advantage&nbsp;of the privileged class, for in England more than in any&nbsp;other country the land law is the law of the nobility and&nbsp;not of the people. One reason of this is that, as England&nbsp;was never so completely feudalized as were some of the&nbsp;Continental states, the burden of feudalism was not so&nbsp;severely felt, and has led to less agitation for reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The land forfeited to the Conqueror was regranted by him to be held by military service due to the king, not&nbsp;to the mesne lord as in Continental feudalism. In 1086&nbsp;at the council of Salisbury all the landholders swore fealty&nbsp;to the crown. In the full vigour of feudalism the inhabitants of England were either free or not free. The free&nbsp;inhabitants held their lands either by free tenure </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(liberum&nbsp;tenementum,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> franktenement) or by a tenure which was&nbsp;originally that of a non-free inhabitant, but attached to&nbsp;land in the possession of a free man. Franktenement was</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">either military tenure, called also tenure in knight service or chivalry (including barony, the highest tenure known to&nbsp;the law, grand serjeanty and the special forms of escuage,&nbsp;castle-guard, cornage, and others), or socage (including&nbsp;burgage and petit serjeanty), or frankalmoign </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(libera elee-mosyna</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">) or divine service, by which ecclesiastical corporations generally held their land.@@<sup>4</sup> The non-free inhabitants&nbsp;were in Domesday Book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">servi, cotarii,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bordarii,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> later&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nativi</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">villani,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the last name being applied to both free&nbsp;men and serfs. All these were in a more or less dependent&nbsp;condition. The free tenures all exist at the present day,&nbsp;though, as will appear later, the military tenures have&nbsp;shrunk into the unimportant and exceptional tenure of&nbsp;grand serjeanty. The non-free tenures are to a certain&nbsp;extent represented by </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Copyhold </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The most important difference between the military and socage tenures&nbsp;was the mode of descent. Whether or not a feudal benefice&nbsp;was originally hereditary, it had certainly become so at the&nbsp;time of the Conquest, and it descended to the eldest son.&nbsp;This applied at once in England to land held by military&nbsp;service as far as regarded the capital fief. The descent&nbsp;of socage lands or lands other than the capital fief for&nbsp;some time followed the old pre-Conquest rule of descent.&nbsp;Thus in the so-called “ Laws of Henry I. ” the lands other&nbsp;than the capital fief, and in Glanvill, who wrote in the&nbsp;time of Henry II., socage lands, if anciently partible&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(antiquitus divisum</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">), were divided among all the sons&nbsp;equally. But by the time of Bracton (Henry III.) the&nbsp;course of descent of lands held by military service had so&nbsp;far prevailed that, though it was a question of fact&nbsp;whether the land was partible or not, if there was no&nbsp;evidence either way descent to the eldest son was presumed. Relics of the old custom still remain in the case&nbsp;of gavelkind (see below). The military tenant was subject to the feudal incidents, from which the tenant in&nbsp;socage was exempt. These incidents, especially wardship&nbsp;and marriage, were often of a very oppressive nature.&nbsp;Alienation of lands by will, except in a few favoured&nbsp;districts, became impossible; alienation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter vivos</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> was&nbsp;restrained in one direction in the interests of the heir, in&nbsp;another in the interests of the lord. At the time of Glanvill a tenant had a greater power of alienation over land&nbsp;which he had purchased </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(terra acquietatd)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> than over land&nbsp;which he had inherited. But by the time of Bracton the&nbsp;heir had ceased to have any interest in either kind of land.&nbsp;The lords were more successful. It was enacted by Magna&nbsp;Charta that a free man should not give or sell so much of&nbsp;his land as to leave an amount insufficient to perform his&nbsp;services to his lord. In spite of this provision, the rights&nbsp;of the lords were continually diminished by subinfeudation&nbsp;until the passing of the Statute of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quia Emptores.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Alienation by a tenant in chief of the crown without licence&nbsp;was a ground of forfeiture until 1 Edw. III. st. 2, c. 12,&nbsp;by which a fine was substituted. The modes of conveyance at this time were only two, feoffment with livery&nbsp;of seisin for corporeal hereditaments, grant for incorporeal&nbsp;hereditaments. Livery of seisin, though public, was not&nbsp;officially recorded like the old English transfer of property.&nbsp;The influence of local custom upon the land law must have&nbsp;become weakened after the circuits of the judges of the&nbsp;King’s Court were established by Henry II. Jurisdiction&nbsp;over litigation touching the freehold was taken away from&nbsp;the lords’ courts by 15 Ric. II. c. 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The common law as far as it dealt with real estate had in the main assumed its present aspect by the reign of&nbsp;Henry III. The changes which have been made since&nbsp;that date have been chiefly due to the action of equity</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
