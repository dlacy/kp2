<p><span class="font1">the House of Commons for plotting in the interests of the king in 1641, Henry Wilmot served Charles I. well during the&nbsp;Civil War, being responsible for the defeats of Sir William&nbsp;Waller at Roundway Down in July 1643 and <sup>at</sup> Cropredy&nbsp;Bridge in June 1644. In 1643 he was created Baron Wilmot&nbsp;of Adderbury. Wilmot was on bad terms with some of the&nbsp;king’s friends and advisers, including Prince Rupert, and in&nbsp;1644 he is reported to have said that Charles was afraid of peace&nbsp;and to have advised his supercession by his son, the prince of&nbsp;Wales. Consequently he was deprived of his command, and&nbsp;after a short imprisonment was allowed to cross over to France.&nbsp;He was greatly trusted by Charles II., whose defeat at Worcester&nbsp;and subsequent wanderings be shared, and during this king’s&nbsp;exile he was one of his principal advisers, being created by him&nbsp;carl of Rochester in 1652. In the interests of Charles he visited&nbsp;the emperor Ferdinand III., the duke of Lorraine, and the&nbsp;elector of Brandenburg, and in March 1655 he was in England,&nbsp;where he led a feeble attempt at a rising on Marston Moor, near&nbsp;York; on its failure he fled the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Born at Ditchley in Oxfordshire on the 10th of April 1647, John Wilmot, who succeeded bis father as 2nd earl in 1658,&nbsp;was educated at Wadham College, Oxford, and in 1661, although&nbsp;he was only fourteen years of age, received the degree of M.A.&nbsp;On leaving Oxford he travelIed in France and Italy with a tutor&nbsp;who encouraged his love of literature, and moreover advocated&nbsp;principles of temperance which, however, bore little fruit. He&nbsp;returned in 1664, and at once made his way to Charles II.’s&nbsp;court, where his youth, good looks and 'wit assured him of a&nbsp;welcome. In 1665 he joined the fleet serving against the Dutch&nbsp;as a volunteer, and in the following year distinguished himself&nbsp;by carrying a message in an open boat under fire. This reputation for courage was afterwards lost in private quarrels in which&nbsp;he seems to have shirked danger. He became gentleman of the&nbsp;bedchamber to Charles II., and was the confidant of his various&nbsp;exploits. According to Anthony Hamilton, banishment from&nbsp;court for lampooning the king or his mistresses was with Rochester an almost annual occurrence, but his disgrace was never&nbsp;of long duration. Charles seems to have found his company&nbsp;too congenial to be long dispensed with, and Pepys says that all&nbsp;serious men were disgusted by the complaisance with which&nbsp;he passed over Rochester’s insolence </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Diary,</span><span class="font1"> 17th Feb. 1669).&nbsp;In order to restore his rapidly vanishing fortune he became a&nbsp;suitor to Elizabeth Malet. In spite of the king’s support of&nbsp;Rochester’s suit, Miss Malet refused to marry the earl, who&nbsp;thereupon had her seized (1665) from her uncle’s coach. Rochester was pursued, and Charles, who was very angry, sent him&nbsp;to the Tower. Miss Malet, however, married him in 1667.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not content with making or unmaking the reputation of the maids of honour and the courtiers by his squibs and songs,&nbsp;Rochester aspired to be a patron of poetry and an arbiter of&nbsp;taste, but he was vain and capricious, tolerating no rivals in his&nbsp;capacity of patron. Dryden dedicated to him his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marriage-a-la-Mode</span><span class="font1"> (1672) in a preface full of effusive flattery, at the close&nbsp;of which, however, occurs a passage that may be taken to&nbsp;indicate that he already had misgivings. “ Your lordship has&nbsp;but another step to make,” he says, “ and from the patron of&nbsp;wit, you may become its tyrant; and oppress our little reputations with more ease than you now protect them.” Dryden had&nbsp;another patron in Lord Mulgrave (afterwards duke of Buckingham and Normanby), to whom he dedicated (1675) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aurcngzebe.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Mulgrave had engaged in a duel with Rochester, who had refused to fight at the last minute on the ground of ill-health.&nbsp;ISIulgrave allowed this story to spread, and Rochester, who&nbsp;apparently thought him too dangerous an opponent, revenged&nbsp;himself on Dryden as Mulgrave’s protégé by setting up as his&nbsp;rivals, first Elkanah Settle, and then John Crowne. By his&nbsp;influence Settle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emperor of Morocco</span><span class="font1"> was played at Whitehall,&nbsp;and Crowne was employed, in direct infringement of Dryden’s&nbsp;province as laureate, to write a masque for the court. Both&nbsp;these poets were discarded in turn for Nathaniel Lee and Thomas&nbsp;Otway. In 1679 Mulgrave began to circulate his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on&nbsp;Satire</span><span class="font1"> in which Rochester was singled out for severe criticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rochestcr chose to pretend that this was Dryden’s work, not Mulgrave’s, and by his orders a band of roughs set on the poet&nbsp;in Rose Alley, Covcnt Garden, and beat him. He obviously felt&nbsp;no shame for this infamous attack, for in his “ Imitation of the&nbsp;First Satire of Juvenal ” he says, “ Who’d be a wit in Dryden’s&nbsp;cudgelled skin?” His health was already undermined, and in&nbsp;the spring of 1680 he retired to High Lodge, Woodstock Park.&nbsp;He began to show signs of a more serious temper, and at his own&nbsp;request was visited (July 20th to July 24th) by Bishop Burnet,&nbsp;who attested the sincerity of his repentance. He died, however,&nbsp;two days after the bishop left him. When his son Charles, the&nbsp;3rd earl, died on the 12th of November 1681, his titles became&nbsp;extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As a poet Rochester was a follower of Abraham Cowley and of Boileau, to both of whom he was considerably indebted. His&nbsp;love lyrics are often happy, but his real vigour and ability is&nbsp;best shown in his critical poems and satires. The political&nbsp;satires are notable for their fierce exposure of Charles II.’s weakness, his ingratitude, and the slavery in which he was held by&nbsp;his mistresses. They show that Rochester had it in him to be a&nbsp;very different man from the criticizing courtier and the “ very&nbsp;profane wit ” who figures in contemporary memoirs.</span></p>

After the restoration of Charles II.&nbsp;he sat as member of parliament, first for Newport in Cornwall&nbsp;and afterwards for the university of Oxford, from 1660 to&nbsp;1679. In 1661 he was sent on a complimentary embassy to&nbsp;Louis XIV. of France, while he held the court post of master&nbsp;of the robes from 1662 to 1675. In 1665 he married Henrietta&nbsp;(d. 1687), daughter of Richard Boyle, earl of Burlington and&nbsp;Cork. When his father was impeached in 1667, Lawrence&nbsp;joined with his elder brother, Henry, in defending him in parliament, but the fall of Clarendon did not injuriously affect the&nbsp;fortunes of his sons. They were united with the royal family&nbsp;through the marriage of their sister, Anne, with the duke of&nbsp;York, afterwards James II., and were both able and zealous&nbsp;royalists.

In April 1681 he was created Viscount&nbsp;Hyde of Kenilworth, and in November following earl of&nbsp;Rochester. He was compelled to join in arranging the treaty of&nbsp;1681, by which Louis XIV. agreed to pay a subsidy to Charles,&nbsp;at the very moment when he was imploring William, prince of&nbsp;Orange, to save Europe from the ambitions of the French&nbsp;monarch. The conflict between his wishes and his interests&nbsp;may have tended to sour a temper never very equable; at all&nbsp;events the earl made himself so unpleasant to his colleagues&nbsp;that in August 1684 be was removed from the treasury to the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
