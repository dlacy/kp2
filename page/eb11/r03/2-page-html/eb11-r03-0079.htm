<p><span class="font1">RISTORI, ADELAIDE (1822-1906), Italian actress, was born at Cividale del Friuli on the 30th of January 1822, the daughter&nbsp;of strolling players. As a child she appeared upon the stage,&nbsp;and at fourteen made her first success as Francesca da Rimini in&nbsp;Silvio Pellico<sup>r</sup>S tragedy. She was eighteen when for the first&nbsp;time she played Mary Stuart in an Italian version of Schiller’s&nbsp;play. She had been a member of the Sardinian company and&nbsp;also of the Ducal company at Parma for some years before her&nbsp;marriage (1846) to the marchese Giuliano Capranica del GrilIo&nbsp;(d. 1861); and after a short retirement she returned to the stage&nbsp;and played regularly in Turin and the provinces. It was not&nbsp;until 1855 that she paid her first professional visit to Paris, where&nbsp;the part of Francesca was chosen for her </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">début.</span><span class="font1"> In this she was&nbsp;rather coldly received, but she took Paris by storm in the title&nbsp;rôle of Alfieri’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Myrrha.</span><span class="font1"> Furious partisanship was aroused by&nbsp;the appearance of a rival to the great Rachel. Paris was divided&nbsp;into two camps of opinion. Humble playgoers fought at gallery&nbsp;doors over the merits of their respective favourites. The two&nbsp;famous women never actually met, but the French actress seems&nbsp;to have been convinced that Ristori had no feelings towards her&nbsp;but those of admiration and respect. A tour in other countries&nbsp;was followed (1856) by a fresh visit to Paris, when Ristori&nbsp;appeared in Montanelli<sup>r</sup>S Italiantranslation of Legouve<sup>r</sup>S </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Medea.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">She repeated her success in this in London. In 1857 she visited&nbsp;Madrid, playing in Spanish to enthusiastic audiences, and in 1866&nbsp;she paid the first of four visits to the United States, where she&nbsp;won much applause, particularly in Giacometti’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elizabeth,</span><span class="font1"> an&nbsp;Italian study of the English sovereign. She finally retired from&nbsp;professional life in 1885, and died on the 9th of October 1906&nbsp;in Rome. She left a son, the marchese Georgio Capranica del&nbsp;Grillo. Her </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Studies and Memoirs</span><span class="font1"> (1888) provide a lively account&nbsp;of an interesting career, and are particularly valuable for the&nbsp;chapters devoted to the psychological explanation of the&nbsp;characters of Mary Stuart, Elizabeth, Myrrha, Phaedra and&nbsp;Lady Macbeth, in her interpretation of which Ristori combined high dramatic instinct with the keenest and most critical&nbsp;intellectual study.</span></p>

He went into business,&nbsp;and in 1874 was returned to parliament as Conservative member&nbsp;for the Tower Hamlets. In 1885 he was made Secretaryto the&nbsp;Admiralty, and from 1886 to 1892 president of the Local Government Board, in Lord Salisbury’s administration, sitting as&nbsp;member for St George’s in the East. He was responsible for the&nbsp;Local Government Act of 1888, instituting the county councils;&nbsp;and a large section of the Conservative party always owed him a&nbsp;grudge for having originated the London County Council. In&nbsp;Lord Salisbury’s later ministries, as member for Croydon, he was&nbsp;president of the Board of Trade (1895-1900), and home secretary&nbsp;(1895-1900); and when Sir MichaelHicks-Beach retired in 1902,&nbsp;he became chancellor of the exchequer in Mr Balfour’s cabinet.&nbsp;Though in his earlier years he had been a “ fair-trader,” he was&nbsp;strongly opposed to Mr Chamberlain’s movement for a preferential tariff (see the articles on </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Balfour<sub>j</sub>A.</span><span class="font1"> J., and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chamber-lain,</span><span class="font1"> J.), and he resigned office in September 1903.

<p><span class="font1">RITSCHL, ALBRECHT (1822-1889), German theologian, was bom at BerUn on the 25th of March 1822. His father,&nbsp;Georg Karl Benjamin Ritschl (1783-1858), became in 1810&nbsp;pastor at the church of St Mary in Berlin, and from 1827 to 1854&nbsp;was general superintendent and evangelical bishop of Pomerania.&nbsp;Albrecht RitschI studied at Bonn, Halle, Heidelberg and&nbsp;Tübingen. At Halle he came under Hegelian influences through&nbsp;the teaching of Julius Schaller (1810-1868) and J. H. Erdmann&nbsp;(b. 1805). In 1845 he was entirely captivated by the Tübingen&nbsp;school, and in his work </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Das Evangelium Marcions und das&nbsp;kanonische Evangelium des Lukas,</span><span class="font1"> pubUshed in 1846, he appears&nbsp;as a disciple of F. C. Baur. This did not last long with him,&nbsp;however, for the second edition (1857) of his most important&nbsp;work, on the origin of the old CathoUc Church </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Die Entstehung&nbsp;der alt-kathol. Kirche),</span><span class="font1"> shows considerable divergence from&nbsp;the first edition (1850), and reveals an entire emancipation&nbsp;from F. C. Baur’s method. Ritschl was professor of theology&nbsp;at Bonn (extraordinarius 1852; Ordinarius 1859) and Göttingen&nbsp;(1864; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Consistorialrath</span><span class="font1"> also in 1874), his addresses on reUgion&nbsp;delivered at the latter university showing the impression made&nbsp;upon his mind by his enthusiastic studies of Kant and Schleier-macher. Finally, in 1864, came the influence of Rudolf Lotze.&nbsp;He wrote a large work on the Christian doctrine of justification&nbsp;and atonement, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Christliche Lehre von der Rechtfertigung und&nbsp;Versöhnung,</span><span class="font1"> pubUshed during the years 1870-74, and in 1880-86&nbsp;a history of pietism </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Die Geschichte des Pietismus).</span><span class="font1"> His system&nbsp;of theology is contained in the former. He died at Gottingen&nbsp;on the 20th of March 1889.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His son, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Otto Ritschl</span><span class="font1"> (b. i860), after studying at Gottingen, Bonn and Giessèn, became professor at Kiel (extraordinarius)&nbsp;in 1889 and afterwards at Bonn (extraordinarius 1894; Ordinarius 1897). He has pubUshed, amongst other works,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Schleiermachers Stellung zum Christentum in seinen Reden über&nbsp;die Religion</span><span class="font1"> (1888), and a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> of his father (2 vols., 1829-96).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ritschl daims to carry on the work of Luther and Schleier-macher, especially in ridding faith of the tyranny of scholastic philosophy. His system shows the influence of Kant’s destructive criticism of the claims of Pure Reason, recognition of the&nbsp;value of moraUy conditioned knowledge, and doctrine of the&nbsp;kingdom of ends; of Schleiermacher<sup>r</sup>S historical treatment&nbsp;of Christianity, regulative use of the idea of reUgious feUowsbip,&nbsp;emphasis on the importance of reUgious fecUng; and of Lotze’s&nbsp;theory of knowledge and treatment of personaUty. RitschFs&nbsp;work made a profound impression on German thought and&nbsp;gave a new confidence to German theology, while at the same&nbsp;time it provoked a storm of hostile criticism: his school has&nbsp;grown with remarkable rapidity. This is perhaps mainly due&nbsp;to the bold religious positivism with which he assumes that&nbsp;spiritual experience is real and that faith has not only a legitimate but even a paramount claim to provide the highest interpretation of the world. The life of trust in God is a fact, not&nbsp;so much to be explained as to explain everything else. RitschFs&nbsp;standpoint is not that of the individual subject. The objective&nbsp;ground on which he bases his system is the religious experience of the Christian community. The “ immediate object of&nbsp;theological knowledge is the faith of the community,” and&nbsp;from this positive religious datum theology constructs a “ total&nbsp;view of the world and human life.” Thus the essence of&nbsp;RitschFs work is systematic theology. Nor does he painfully&nbsp;work up to his master-category, for it is given in the knowledge</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
