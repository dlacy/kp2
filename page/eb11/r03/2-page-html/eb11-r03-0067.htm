<p><span class="font0">Street of that name, belonging to a fraternity of negroes and once occupied by the episcopal chapter; and the prettily situated&nbsp;octagonal Gloria church on a hill of that name overlooking the&nbsp;lower bay. Another church of the same name faces on the Largo&nbsp;do Machado and shows the peculiar combination of aGreek temple&nbsp;surmounted by a modern spire. The British residents have an&nbsp;unpretentious chapel in Rua Evaristo da Veiga, the Methodists a&nbsp;more modern structure on the Largo do Cattete and the Presbyterians a chapel near Praça Tiradentes. There is religious toleration in Brazil, but down to the organization of the republic no&nbsp;non-Catholic church or chapel was permitted to have a spire or&nbsp;other outward symbol of a place of worship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among public buildings of an official character the following are noteworthy. The old city palace facing on Praça 15 de Novembro<sub>l&nbsp;</sub>dates from 1743 and was the residence of the royal governors and&nbsp;Dom Joao VI., but is now used by the national telegraph offices.&nbsp;The Sao Christoväo palace, in the suburb of that name, was the&nbsp;residence of the Emperor Dom Pedro II. It is a rambling structure&nbsp;now occupied by the National Museum. The Cattete palace, on the&nbsp;StreetGfthatname<sub>t</sub>OriginalIyaprivateresidcnce, is now the official&nbsp;residence of the President, richly decorated within and partly surrounded by a handsome park. The Itamarâty palace near the&nbsp;Praça da Republica, a typical private residence of the better class,&nbsp;was purchased for and occupied by the first presidents and is now&nbsp;occupied by the ministry of foreign affairs. The palace of justice,&nbsp;on Rua Pnmeiro de Março, is one of the finest edifices in the city;&nbsp;and the ministry of industry and public works, on the south side of&nbsp;the Praça 15 de Novembro may be noticed. The ministry of war&nbsp;has its offices in the immense military </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quartel</span><span class="font0"> (barracks) on the&nbsp;north side of the Praça da Republica<sub>1</sub> and the ministry of marine&nbsp;in the naval arsenal at the foot of Sao Bento Hill. The ministry&nbsp;of finance is in the Treasury building, on Rua do Sacramento—an&nbsp;immense structure of no special architectural merit. The Senate&nbsp;occupies a plain unattractive building on the west side of the Praça&nbsp;da Republica, and the Chamber of Deputies an ugly colonial&nbsp;building in Rua da Misericordia, originally used as a city hall and&nbsp;jail. A new legislative palace is designed to occupy the block&nbsp;on the west side of the Praça Tiradentes. There are a number of&nbsp;theatres, but the city had no large theatre of architectural merit&nbsp;previous to the construction of the Municipal Theatre at the intersection of the Avenida Central with Rua 13 de Maio, with an elegant&nbsp;marble façade in the French Renaissance style. Bull-fights have&nbsp;never been popular in Rio de Janeiro, but horse-racing is a favourite&nbsp;sport, and the Jockey Club maintains a racecourse in the Sao Francisco Xavier suburb. . Other notable buildings are the. ornate&nbsp;Monroe palace at the intersection of the Central and Beira-Mar&nbsp;avenues, the Praça do Commercio (Commercial Exchange) on Rua&nbsp;1<sup>0</sup> de Março, the Caixa da Amortizaçâo on the Avenida Central, the&nbsp;custom-house with its extensive warehouses, the terminal station&nbsp;of the Central railway at the N.W. angle of the Praça da Republica,&nbsp;and the library building of the Gabinete Portuguez da Leitura with&nbsp;its exquisite “ Manuelino ” façade of Lisbon marble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Education.—</span><span class="font0">Although much money is given to hospitals and asylums, Rio de Janeiro has no great educational institutions either public or private. The Medical School may be&nbsp;considered the only distinctively professional school in the&nbsp;city. The Polytechnic School, occupying an interesting old&nbsp;building on the Largo de Sao Francisco de Paula, is chiefly&nbsp;devoted to civil engineering. The Gymnasio NacionaI, formerly&nbsp;the Collegio D. Pedro II., is a boys' college of a high school&nbsp;grade, located on Rua Floriano Peixoto, with an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iniernato</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;boarding-school in Rua de S. Francisco Xavier. The college&nbsp;dates from 1735, when it was founded as an asylum for orphan&nbsp;boys destined for the Church. In 1837 it became a state&nbsp;institution and took the name of the Emperor Dom Pedro II.&nbsp;One of the most noteworthy schools of the city is the Lycen de&nbsp;Artes e Officios, located on Rua 13 de Maio, opposite the opera-house; it dates from 1858 and has been the means of giving&nbsp;instruction to a multitude of clerks, artisans and others,&nbsp;through its night classes. Another important school, partly&nbsp;of this class, is the Instituto Benjamin Constant, located in&nbsp;a fine new edifice on the Praia da Saudade, Botafogo. The&nbsp;public schools of Rio de Janeiro are defective both in organization and administration; the non-attendance of children from&nbsp;the higher classes, and the antagonism of the Church to schools&nbsp;under purely secular administration, must be held responsible&nbsp;for the backwardness of these schools. The episcopal seminary&nbsp;on Castle Hill, called the “ Seminario Episcopal de Sao José,”&nbsp;founded in 1739 and devoted exclusively to the education of&nbsp;priests, is the best classical school in the city. There are a&nbsp;number of charitable institutions devoted to the education of&nbsp;orphans, the blind and the deaf and dumb, which are admirably&nbsp;equipped and administered. Among other educational institutions arc a conservatory of music, school of fine arts,&nbsp;normal school, a national library with upwards of 260,000&nbsp;volumes and a large number of manuscripts, maps, medals&nbsp;and coins, the national observatory on Castle Hill, the national&nbsp;museum now domiciled in the Säo Christoväo palace in the&nbsp;midst of a pretty park, a ZoologicaIgarden in the suburb of&nbsp;Villa Isabel, and the famous Botanical Garden founded by Dom&nbsp;Joao VI. in 1808 and now a horticultural experiment station.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hospitals, &amp;c.—</span><span class="font0">Rio de Janeiro is well provided with hospitals, asylums and. benevolent institutions. Chief of these is the Miseri-cordia Hospital, i&gt;opularly known as the &quot; Santa Casa,” belonging&nbsp;to a religious brotherhood dating from 1591. In addition to a large&nbsp;income from rentals, the Santa Casa receives the product of certain&nbsp;port taxes in return for opening its wards to the crews of all vessels&nbsp;in port. Other public hospitals are a lepers' hospital in Säo Christoväo, the military and naval hospitals, the Säo.Sebastiao hospital&nbsp;and the isolation and contagious diseases hospitals in Jurujuba.&nbsp;There are also a number of private hospitals maintained by church&nbsp;brotherhoods and charitable associations; among them are the&nbsp;Portuguese hospital in Rua de Santo Amaro and the Strangers'&nbsp;Hospital (American and British) in Botafogo. Most prominent&nbsp;among the asylums is the Hospicio Nacional for the insane,&nbsp;on the Praia da Saudade, Botafogo, which, was erected 1842-52,&nbsp;and is one of the most completely equipped institutions of its class&nbsp;in the world. There are two public cemeteries: Sao Francisco&nbsp;de Xavier, in Säo Christoväo, and Säo Joao Baptista, in Botafogo,&nbsp;the former having an unconsecrated section for Protestants. Besides these there are five private cemeteries, the one belonging to&nbsp;the British colony being on a hill overlooking the Gambôa shoreline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Harbour, Communications and Commerce.</span><span class="font0"> —The port and harbour of Rio de Janeiro arc the largest and most important&nbsp;in the republic. The entrance is open to vessels of the largest&nbsp;draught, and there is sufficient deep-water anchorage inside for&nbsp;the navies of the world. The lower anchorage, where the officers&nbsp;of health visit vessels, is below Ilha Fiscal, and the upper, or&nbsp;commercial anchorage, is in the broad· part of the bay above&nbsp;Ilha das Cobras, the national coasting vessels occupying the&nbsp;shallower waters near the Saùde and Gambôa districts. The&nbsp;custom-house occupies a considerable part of the shore-line in&nbsp;front of the old city, and has a protected basin for the discharge&nbsp;of lighters. The new port works, under construction since&nbsp;1903, consist of a new water-front for the Saude, Gambôa and&nbsp;Sacco de Alferes districts, in which the shipping interests are&nbsp;centred, and a continuation of the sea-wall across the shallow&nbsp;Säo Christoväo bay to the Ponta do Cajû, the large reclaimed&nbsp;area to be filled in by the removal of some small hills. The&nbsp;commercial quays are built in deep water and permit the&nbsp;mooring alongside of the largest vessels. The total length of&nbsp;the commercial quays is about 3800 yds. Railway and tramway connexions are provided and both electric and hydraulic&nbsp;power are available. Special surtaxes are levied on imports&nbsp;to meet the interest and redemption charges on the loans&nbsp;raised for the execution of these important works. Another&nbsp;improvement is the extension of the sea-wall southward from&nbsp;the ferry-slips (Praça 15 de Novembro) to the Ponta do Cala-bouço (war arsenal), providing protected basins for the arsenal&nbsp;and enclosing small reclaimed · areas. With the completion&nbsp;of these improvements the water-front of the city will consist&nbsp;entirely of deep-water walls from Botafogo to the Ponta do&nbsp;Caju, with the exception of a short section between the Ponta&nbsp;do Calabouço and the Avenida Central. The port is in regular&nbsp;communication with the principal ports of Europe and America.&nbsp;The coastwise service is good, though rates are high. Railway&nbsp;communication with the interior is maintained by the Central&nbsp;do Brazil (formerly the Dom PedroII.), Leopoldina and Melhora-mentos lines, besides which there is a short passenger line up&nbsp;to the Corcovado about 2J m. long, an electric line to Tijuca,&nbsp;and a narrow-gauge line running out to the Rio do Ouro waterworks. There is daily communication with Petropolis by a&nbsp;branch line of the LeopoIdina system, and also by a steamer&nbsp;to the head of the bay and thence by rail up the serra. Ferryboats cross the bay to Nicthcroy at intervals of 20 minutes, and&nbsp;smaller craft provide communication with the islands of Gober-nador and Paqueta.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
