The queen-dowager, imagining that the lords were fled, conceived great hopes of being able to cruſh the reformed at once. Her ſanguine hopes, however, were ſoon checked, on receiving certain intelligence that queen Elizabeth was reſolved to give them aſſiſtance. She now took the beſt meaſures poſſible, as circumſtances ſtood; and determined to cruſh her enemies before they could receive any aſſiſtance from England. Her French troops took the road to Stirling, and waſted in their march all the grounds which belonged to the favourers of the reformation. After renewing their depredations at Stirling, they paſſed the bridge there; and proceeding along the ſide of the river, exerciſed their cruelties and oppreſſions in a diſtrict which had diſtinguiſhed itſelf by an ardent zeal againſt popery. While the terror of their arms was thus diffuſing itſelf, they reſolved to ſeize the town and caſtle of St Andrew’s, which they conſidered as an important military ſtation, and as a convenient place of reception for the auxiliaries they expected from France.</p><p>But the lord James Stuart employed himſelf to interrupt their progreſs and retard their attempts; and it was his object at the ſame time, to keep the force of the Congregation entire, to hazard no action of importance, and to wait the approach of the Engliſh army. A ſmall advantage was obtained by the French at Petticur; and they poſſeſſed themſelves of Kinghorn. The lord James Stuart, with 500 horſe and 100 foot, entered Dyſart. With this inconſiderable ſtrength he propoſed to act againſt an army of 4000 men. His admirable ſkill in military affairs, and his heroic courage, were eminently diſplayed. During 20 days he prevented the march of the French to St Andrew’s, intercepting their proviſions, haraſſing them with ſkirmiſhes, and intimidating them by the addreſs and the boldneſs of his ſtratagems.</p><p>Monſieur d’Oyſel, enraged and aſhamed to be diſconcerted and oppoſed by a body of men ſo diſproportioned to his army, exerted himſelf with vigour. The lord James Stuart was obliged to retire. Dyſart and Wemyſs were given to the French troops to be pillaged; and when d’Oyſel was in full march to St Andrew’s, he diſcovered a powerful fleet bearing up the frith. It was concluded, that the ſupplies expected from France were arrived. Guns were fired by his ſoldiers, and their joy was indulged in all its extravagance. But this fleet having taken the veſſels which contained their proviſions, and the ordnance with which they intended to improve the fortifications of the caſtle at St Andrew’s, a period was put to their rejoicings. Certain news was brought, that the fleet they obſerved was the navy of England, which had come to ſupport the Congregation. A conſternation, heightened by the giddineſs of their preceding tranſports, invaded them. Monſieur d’Oyſel perceived now the value and merit of the ſervice which had been performed by the lord James Stuart; and thinking no more of St Andrew’s and conqueſt, fled, to Stirling, in his way to Leith, from which he dreaded to be intercepted; but he reached that important ſtation after a march of three days.</p><p>A formal treaty was now concluded between the lords of the Congregation and queen Elizabeth; and in the mean time the queen-dowager was diſappointed in her expectations from France. The violent adminiſtration of the houſe of Guiſe had involved that nation in troubles and diſtreſs. Its credit was greatly  ſunk, and its treaſury was nearly exhauſted. Perſecutions, and the ſpirit of Calviniſm, produced commotions and conſpiracies; and amidſt domeſtic and dangerous intrigues and ſtruggles, Scotland failed to engage that particular diſtinction which had been promiſed to its affairs. It was not, however, neglected altogether. The count De Martigues had arrived at Leith with 1000 foot and a few horſe. The marquis D’Elbeuf had embarked for it with another body of ſoldiers; but, after loſing ſeveral ſhips in a furious tempeſt, was obliged to return to the haven from which he had ſailed.</p><p>In this ſad reverſe of fortune many forſook the queen- dowager. It was now underſtood that the Engliſh army was upon its march to Scotland. The Scottiſh lords who had affected a neutrality, meditated an union with the Proteſtants. The earl of Huntley gave a ſolemn aſſurance that he would join them. Proclamations were iſſued throughout the kingdom, calling upon the ſubjects of Scotland to aſſemble in arms at Linlithgow, to re-eſtabliſh their ancient freedom, and to aſſiſt in the utter expulſion of the French ſoldiery.</p><p>The Engliſh fleet, meanwhile, under Winter the vice-admiral, had taken and deſtroyed ſeveral ſhips, had landed ſome troops upon Inchkeith, and diſcomſited a body of French mercenaries. Upon the foundation of theſe acts of hoſtility, the princes of Lorraine diſpatched the chevalier de Seure to queen Elizabeth, to make repreſentations againſt this breach of the peace, and to urge the recal of her ſhips. This ambaſſador affected likewiſe to negociate concerning the evacuation of Scotland by the French troops, and to propoſe methods by which the king of France might quarter the arms of England without doing a prejudice to queen Elizabeth. But to prevent the execution of vigorous reſolutions againſt the queen-dowager, and to gain time, were the only objects he had in view. With ſimiliar intentions, John Monluc biſhop of Valence, a man of greater addreſs and ability, and equally devoted to the houſe of Guiſe, was alſo ſent at this time to the court of England. Queen Elizabeth, however, and her miniſters, were too wiſe to be amuſed by artifice and dexterity. The lord Grey entered Scotland with an army of 1200 horſe and 6000 foot; and the lord Scroop, Sir James Croft, Sir Henry Percy, and Sir Francis Lake commanded under him. By an inclement policy, the queen- dowager had already wafted all the country around the capital. But the deſolation ſhe had made, while it was ruinous to the Scottiſh peaſants, affected not the army of England. The leaders of the Congregation did not want penetration and foreſight, and had provided themſelves againſt this difficulty. The duke of Chatelherault, the earls of Argyle, Glencairn, and Menteith, the lord James Stuart, and the lords Ruthven, Boyd, and Ochiltree, with a numerous and formidable force, joined the Engliſh commander at Preſton.</p><p>Struck with the ſad condition of her affairs, deſpairing of a timely and proper ſuccour from France, and reminded by ſickneſs of her mortality, the queen-dowager</p></body></text></TEI>
