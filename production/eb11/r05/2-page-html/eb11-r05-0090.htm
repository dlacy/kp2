<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Literature</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The intellectual development of Rumania has never until modern times been affected by Latin culture, but it has been&nbsp;profoundly influenced first by Slavonic literature, then by&nbsp;the Greek or Byzantine literature, and last, by the Western,&nbsp;notably French and Italian novels. The history of Rumanian&nbsp;literature can be divided into three distinct periods: the&nbsp;Slavonic, from the beginnings of Rumanian literature in the&nbsp;middle of the 16th century down to 1710; the Greek, from&nbsp;1710-1830, corresponding with the era of Phanariote rule;&nbsp;and the modern period, from 1830 to the present. The change&nbsp;from Slavonic to Rumanian was very gradual. Slavonic had&nbsp;been the language of the Church from the early middle ages,&nbsp;and was therefore hallowed in the eyes of the people and the&nbsp;clergy; through the political connexion with the Slavonic&nbsp;kingdoms of the south, Bulgaria and Servia, it had also been&nbsp;* the language of the chancelleries and of the court. Even&nbsp;when the Rumanian language at last supplanted the Slavonic,&nbsp;it did not emancipate itself from the original; the new was&nbsp;merely a translation from the old, and at the beginning it was&nbsp;as literal as possible. We have therefore in the first period a&nbsp;medieval literature transplanted to Rumania and consisting&nbsp;of translations from the Slavonic. The reason of the change&nbsp;from Slavonic into Rumanian is to be sought in the influence&nbsp;the Reformation had among the Rumanian inhabitants of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Transylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second period is marked by a complete waning of Slavonic influence, through the literary activity of the Greek hospodars.&nbsp;The Slavonic kingdoms of the south had lost their independence;&nbsp;they had ceased to produce anything worth having, whilst the&nbsp;Greeks brought with them the old literature from Byzantium&nbsp;and thus drove out the last remnants of Slavonic. They also&nbsp;treated Rumanian as an uncouth and barbarian language, and&nbsp;imposed upon the Church their own Greek language, Greek&nbsp;literature and Greek culture. This literature may be taken&nbsp;to represent the period of the Renaissance in the West; but&nbsp;when the yoke of the Phanariotes was shaken off, the link that&nbsp;connected Rumanian literature with Greek was also broken,&nbsp;and under modem influences began the romantic movement&nbsp;which has dominated Rumanian literature since 1830.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Much of the Rumanian literature of the first two periods has been preserved only in MSS.; few of these have been&nbsp;investigated, and a still smaller number have been compared&nbsp;with their original. The Rumanian Academy keeps jealous&nbsp;watch over the treasures it has accumulated, and few have&nbsp;had access to the riches entombed in its archives; nor has&nbsp;any private or public collection been catalogued. An exhaustive history of Rumanian literature is, for the time being,&nbsp;a pious wish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">First Period: c. 1550-1710.—</span><span class="font0">Rumanian literature begins, like all modern European literature, with translations from the Bible.&nbsp;The oldest of these are direct translations from Slavonic texts,&nbsp;following, the original word for word, even in its grammatical&nbsp;construction. The first impetus towards the printing of .the Rumanian translations came from the princes and judges in Transylvania. It is under their orders ana often at their expense that&nbsp;the first Slavonic printing-presses were established in places like&nbsp;Kronstadt (Brashov) Ora§tia, Sasz-Shebesh and Belgrad (Alba&nbsp;Julia, in Transylvania)where Slavonic and Rumanian books appeared.&nbsp;The foremost printer and translator was a certain Diakonus Koresi,&nbsp;of Greek origin, who had emigrated to Walachia and thence to&nbsp;Transylvania. He was assisted in his work by the “ popes ”&nbsp;(parish priests) of those places where he worked. The very first&nbsp;book published in Rumanian is the Gospels printed in Kronstadt&nbsp;between 1560 and 1561. An absolutely identical Slavonic text of&nbsp;the Gospels appeared in the same year, or one year earlier, which&nbsp;no doubt was the original for the Rumanian translation. Following&nbsp;up the list of publications of the books of the Bible in chronological&nbsp;order, we find Diakonus Koresi immediately afterwards—&nbsp;the date has not yet been definitely ascertained—printing&nbsp;a Rumanian translation of the Acts of the Apostles; in&nbsp;1577 he printed at Sasz-Shebesh a Psalter in both Slavonic and&nbsp;Rumanian; the Rumanian follows the Slavonic verse for verse.&nbsp;A MS. Psalter more recently discovered shows close affinity to this&nbsp;edition, and, in spite of the opinions held by some critics, must be&nbsp;considered as a copy of it . made about 1585; it even reproduces&nbsp;the printer’s errors of Koresi’s edition. To the 16th centuiy belong&nbsp;also the first attempts to translate the historical books of the Old&nbsp;Testament which appeared in Orastia in 1582, under the title </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Palia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The example thus set could not fail to react upon the Rumanians&nbsp;in Walachia, with whom the Transylvanians stood in close commercial&nbsp;and political connexion. The Slavonic language still.reigned supreme&nbsp;in the Church; yet once the example had been set in Transylvania,&nbsp;and the influence of the Slavonic nations had begun to slacken, it&nbsp;was inevitable that the Rumanian language should sooner or later&nbsp;come to its own. It was in Transylvania that the first complete&nbsp;Rumanian translation of the New Testament appeared. (Belgrad,&nbsp;1648). This translation was based upon the Slavonic original., but&nbsp;the text had been verified and corrected, by comparison with a&nbsp;Calvinistic translation, and had been collated with the Greek.&nbsp;The chief author of this translation, which may be termed classical,&nbsp;seems to have been a certain Hieromonach Sylvestre who lived in&nbsp;Walachia and who had undertaken, by order of.the prince Betlen-gabor of Transylvania. (1613-20), a translation of the. whole&nbsp;Bible. Upon this version, no aoubt, are based the editions of&nbsp;Iordache Cantacuzene(Bucharest, 1682), and that of §erban Greceanu&nbsp;(1693), in which for the first time the Greek text is printed side by&nbsp;side with the Rumanian; and the edition of Anthim the Iberian&nbsp;(1703). In these may. also be traced a few reminiscences of the&nbsp;older version by Koresi, of which a copy, made by Radu Gramatik&nbsp;(1574), and once the property of Peter Cercel, is now in the British&nbsp;Museum. Sylvestre also prepared a new edition of the Psalter as&nbsp;part of his Bible (Belgrad, 1651), verifying the text by reference to&nbsp;the Hebrew and Greek originals. The first edition of the complete&nbsp;Bible was published (1688) by order of Prince Ioan Serban Canta-cuzene, by Radu Greceanu, assisted by his brother §erban and by&nbsp;Metrofan the bishop of Buzeu. This may be considered as the&nbsp;supreme monument of Rumanian literature in Walachia in the&nbsp;17th century. No other Rumanian translation approaches it in&nbsp;style and diction, although the authors, as they own, utilized the&nbsp;older translations, and for the New Testament and the Psalter they&nbsp;utilized Sylvestre’s work. At least a hundred years had to pass&nbsp;ere a new edition of the whole Bible was undertaken, nor was the&nbsp;Bible used for private reading, except such passages as were included&nbsp;in the lessons read in church. These were translated independently&nbsp;by Dositheiu under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pirimiar</span><span class="font0"> (Jassy, 1683), and were&nbsp;almost the last work that came from his prolific -pen. As far back&nbsp;as 1600 Dositheiu had made a new translation of the Psalter from&nbsp;the Slavonic and printed it in both languages (Jassy, 1680). Upon&nbsp;this translation he based the rhymed Psalter.at which he had worked&nbsp;from 1660-73, when it appeared in Uniev. This is the first&nbsp;example of rhymed psalms in Rumanian, the author following the&nbsp;Polish rhymed version of Ian Kohanowski. Albert Molnar had&nbsp;translated a French rhymed. Psalter into Hungarian (1607) and&nbsp;this served as the basis for a literal translation made by Ianos Viski&nbsp;(1697). About the same time Theodor Korbea attempted to versify&nbsp;the Psalter and dedicated his work to Peter the Great of Russia.&nbsp;A new translation of the Psalter from Slavonic, with a commentary,&nbsp;the first of its kind, was made in 1697 by Alexander Dascalul&nbsp;(Alexander Preceptor Polonus). All these last-mentioned Psalters&nbsp;are still, in MS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Turning from the Bible to homilies and the liturgy, we find the ancient collections of homilies in Rumania to be due to the same&nbsp;proselytizing movement. Almost the first book printed&nbsp;by Koresi (at the expense of the magistrate of Kronstadt,&nbsp;Foro.Miklaus, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font0"> 1570), seems to have been a translation from some&nbsp;Calvinistic compilation of homilies, one for every Sunday in the year.&nbsp;A Slavonic original sent by the metropolitan Serafim of Walachia&nbsp;served as the basis for a second collection of homilies known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evangelie invd$toare</span><span class="font0"> (1580^ It differs from the former in language&nbsp;and tendency and proves that Koresi was only a translator and&nbsp;printer. The first collection of homilies, henceforth known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cazanii,</span><span class="font0"> appeared in Dlugopole, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> Cfimpulung, in Walachia, in&nbsp;1642. It was compiled by a certain Melchisedec and contained thirteen homilies. Very voluminous is the next collection, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Evangelie&nbsp;invdfttoare tdlcuitd,</span><span class="font0"> ^translated from the Russian by Sylvestre&nbsp;(Govora, 1643). One year later appeared the first book printed in&nbsp;Moldavia, the collection of homilies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Carte romdneased de invdfdturd&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(Jassy, 1643). It is a volume of 1000 folio pages, of which the first&nbsp;half is absolutely identical with Sylvestre’s collection. A similar&nbsp;unacknowledged loan was made by Meletie the Macedonian, compiler&nbsp;of the homilies which appeared at Deal in 1644. Of special interest</span></p>
