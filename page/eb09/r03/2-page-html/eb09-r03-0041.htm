<p><span class="font1">from the outset the community had not been in the habit of observing the Mosaic law. At most it was observed&nbsp;in isolated details, and as new members continued to be&nbsp;added from the outer heathen world these relics of Jewish&nbsp;custom received less and less prominence, fading away&nbsp;in presence of the faith in Jesus as the Redeemer. It is&nbsp;possible that influences from Pauline circles may also have&nbsp;come into play, but of this we cannot be sure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If such were the circumstances in which the majority of the community in Rome had been brought to their attitude&nbsp;of freedom towards the law, that attitude was one of fact&nbsp;rather than of principle. The law was not observed ; but&nbsp;there was no clear consciousness that it had no obligatory&nbsp;force. A community thus placed had no firm basis from&nbsp;which to withstand a Judaizing agitation when it should&nbsp;arise. In such an event there was the greatest danger to&nbsp;its very existence. It is here, then, that we must look for&nbsp;the real occasion of the present epistle. Paul was afraid&nbsp;that the Judaizers who had wrought with such effect within&nbsp;the churches founded by himself in Galatia and Corinth&nbsp;might also lay hold on that at Rome. Perhaps they had&nbsp;already arrived there and the apostle knew it. At all&nbsp;events he perceived a threatening danger. He was unwilling to delay till he could visit the church personally, and&nbsp;accordingly sent forthwith an elaborate document in establishment and vindication of the gospel as free from the&nbsp;law, so that the Roman Christians might be confirmed in&nbsp;their free practice and might be strengthened to withstand&nbsp;the agitations of Judaizers. This is the explanation of the&nbsp;fact that a letter addressed to a Gentile Christian church,&nbsp;not in bondage to the law, is yet almost entirely devoted&nbsp;to the refutation of the Judaistic positions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The genuineness of the epistle is practically undisputed ; not so, however, its integrity. Baur (as had already been&nbsp;done by Marcion in ancient times) disputed the genuineness of the last two chapters (xv., xvi.), chiefly on the&nbsp;ground that in them a spirit of concession towards the&nbsp;weak is urged in a wholly un-Pauline manner. Luclit@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>has sought to separate out the genuine from the spurious&nbsp;in these chapters in a very complicated manner, but&nbsp;substantially on the lines of Baur’s criticism. The most&nbsp;thorough discussion of Baur’s and Lucht’s views is that of&nbsp;Mangold,@@<sup>2</sup> who has very convincingly shown that there is&nbsp;no real ground for refusing to attribute to the apostle the&nbsp;chapters in question. All the exhortations to concession&nbsp;do not, after all, go beyond the principle acted on by Paul&nbsp;himself (1 Cor. ix. 20),—“to the Jews I became as a Jew&nbsp;that I might win the Jews.” In two points, however, the&nbsp;defence does not hold : (1) the doxology at the close&nbsp;(Rom. xvi. 25-27) appears certainly to be from a later&nbsp;hand;@@<sup>3</sup> (2) ch. xvi. 3-20 seems to be genuinely Pauline&nbsp;indeed, but not to belong to the present epistle. Not&nbsp;only is the large number of salutations in a letter addressed&nbsp;to a community personally unknown to the apostle in&nbsp;itself strange ; but salutations also occur addressed to persons whom one would expect to find rather at Ephesus than&nbsp;at Rome (ver. 3, Aquila and Priscilla; ver. 5, Epaenetus)&nbsp;and in districts where the apostle had resided and laboured&nbsp;(xvi. 7, 9, 13). Not without reason, therefore, is it conjectured that here we have a fragment of an epistle to the&nbsp;Ephesians which by mistake has come to be incorporated&nbsp;with that to the Romans.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROMANUS I. (Lecapenus), who shared the imperial throne with </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Constantine</span><span class="font1"> VII. (&lt;/.v.) and exercised all&nbsp;the real power from 919 to 944, was admiral of the Byzantine fleet on the Danube when, hearing of the defeat&nbsp;of the army at Achelous (17th August 917), he resolved&nbsp;to sail for Constantinople. Popular caprice as well as&nbsp;his influence over his sailors aided his ambition, and,&nbsp;after the marriage of his daughter Helena to Constantine,&nbsp;he was first proclaimed “ basileopater ” in April 919 and&nbsp;afterwards crowned colleague of his son-in-law on 17th&nbsp;December of the same year. His reign, which was undistinguished and uneventful, was terminated by his own&nbsp;sons Stephen and Constantine, who in 944 carried him&nbsp;off to the island of Prote and compelled him to become a&nbsp;monk. He died in 948.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROMANUS II., emperor of the East, succeeded his father Constantine VII. in 959 at the age of twenty-one,&nbsp;and died—poisoned, it was believed, by his wife, Theophano&nbsp;—in 963. He was a pleasure-loving sovereign, but showed&nbsp;judgment in the selection of his ministers. The great&nbsp;event of his reign was the conquest of Crete by Nicephorus&nbsp;Phocas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROMANUS III. (Argyrus), emperor of the East, was an accomplished but otherwise undistinguished member of&nbsp;the Byzantine aristocracy when, summoned to the palace&nbsp;of the dying Constantine VIII., he was informed that ho&nbsp;had been selected to marry one of the imperial princesses&nbsp;and succeed the emperor. His hesitation as already a&nbsp;married man was removed by his wife, who generously&nbsp;took the veil; and his union with Zoe and their joint&nbsp;coronation were celebrated on 19th November 1028. Two&nbsp;days later Constantine died. A serious defeat which&nbsp;Romanus sustained in person at Azaz in Syria, when&nbsp;marching to take possession of Aleppo, considerably impaired the popularity among his subjects which he had&nbsp;sought to purchase by lavish concession to various classes,&nbsp;and soon afterwards he began to show symptoms of disease,&nbsp;attributed by many to slow poison administered by connivance of the empress. His death took place on 11th&nbsp;April 1034, and he was forthwith succeeded by </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Michael&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">IV. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROMANUS IV. (Diogenes), emperor of the East from 1068 to 1071, was a member of a distinguished Cappadocian family and had risen to distinction in the army&nbsp;when he was convicted of treason against the sons of Constantine X. While waiting execution he was summoned&nbsp;into the presence of their mother, Eudocia Macrembolitissa,&nbsp;the empress regent, whom lie so fascinated that she granted&nbsp;him a free pardon and shortly afterwards married him.&nbsp;Taking the field soon after his coronation, he carried on&nbsp;three campaigns against the Saracens and Seljuk Turks&nbsp;without achieving any decisive success, and in a fourth he&nbsp;was disastrously defeated by Alp Arslan on the banks of&nbsp;the Araxes and taken prisoner. Released from captivity&nbsp;after promising to pay a large ransom and concluding a&nbsp;treaty of peace, he returned homewards only to find revolution in full flood, and after a second defeat of his arms by&nbsp;the troops of Michael VII. he was compelled to resign the&nbsp;empire and retire to the island of Prote, where he soon&nbsp;died in great misery. It was during this reign that by&nbsp;the surrender of Bari (15th April 1071) the Byzantine&nbsp;empire lost its last hold upon Italy.</span></p>
