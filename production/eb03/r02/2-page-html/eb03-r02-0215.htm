<p><span class="font0">rennis; who in oppreſſion and cruelty ſeems to have been nothing inferior to thoſe of the moſt tyrannical&nbsp;emperors. During the firſt part of the reign of Commodus, he ruled with an abſolute ſway; but at laſt was&nbsp;torn in pieces by the enraged ſoldiery, whom he had&nbsp;offended by his too great ſeverity. He was ſucceeded&nbsp;in his place by a freedman named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cleander;</span><span class="font0"> for the emperor himſelf was ſo much taken up with his plea-lures, that he could not beſtow even a moment on the&nbsp;affairs of ſtate. The new miniſter abuſed his power&nbsp;in a more flagrant manner than even his predeceſſor&nbsp;lutd done. By him all things were openly ſet to ſale;&nbsp;offices, provinces, public revenues, juſtice, and the lives&nbsp;of men both innocent and guilty. The miniſter, who&nbsp;ruled the emperor without controul, infuſed ſuch terrors into his timorous mind, that he changed the captains of his guards almoſt continually. One Niger enjoyed the dignity only fix hours; another only five&nbsp;days; and ſeveral others a ſtill ſhorter ſpace. Moſt of&nbsp;thoſe officers loſt their lives along with their employments; being accuſed of treaſon by Cleander, who continually ſolicited, and at laſt obtained, that important&nbsp;poſt for himſelf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the year 187 happened a remarkable revolt. One Maternus, a common ſoldier, having fled from his colours, and being joined by many others guilty of the&nbsp;ſame crime, grew in a ſhort time ſo powerful, the banditti flocking to him from all parts, that he over-ran&nbsp;and plundered great part of Gaul and Spain ; ſtormed&nbsp;the ſtrongeſt cities ; and ſtruck the emperor and people&nbsp;of Rome with ſuch terror, that troops were raiſed, and&nbsp;armies diſpatched againſt him. Peſcennius Niger was&nbsp;ſent to make head againſt him in Gaul, where he became very intimate with Severus, who was then governor of Lyons, and who wrote a letter to the emperor,&nbsp;commending the prudent and gallant behaviour of Niger in purſuing the rebels. Maternus, finding himſelf&nbsp;reduced to great ſtraits, divided his men into ſeveral&nbsp;ſmall bands, and marched privately with them by different ways into Italy ; having nothing leſs in view than&nbsp;to murder the emperor during the ſolemnity which was&nbsp;kept annually in honour of the mother of the gods,&nbsp;and on his death to ſeize upon the empire for himſelf.&nbsp;They all arrived at Rome undiſcovered ; and ſeveral of&nbsp;his men had already mixed themſelves with the emperor’s guards, when others of his own party betrayed&nbsp;him. He was immediately ſeized and executed ; and&nbsp;his death put an end to the diſturbances which ſome of&nbsp;his followers had begun to raiſe in other provinces.&nbsp;In the ſame year broke out the moſt dreadful plague,&nbsp;ſays Dio Caſſius, that had been known. It laſted two&nbsp;or three years ; and raged with the greateſt violence at&nbsp;Rome, where it frequently earned off 2000 perſons&nbsp;a-day. The following year a dreadſul fire, which conſumed a great part of the city, was kindled by lightning ; and at the ſame time the people were afflicted&nbsp;with a dreadſul famine, occaſioned, according to ſome&nbsp;authors, by Cleander, who, having now in view nothing&nbsp;leſs than the ſovereignty itſelf, bought up underhand&nbsp;all the corn, in order to raiſe the price of it, and gain&nbsp;tire affections of the ſoldiery and people by diſtributing it among them. Others tell us, however, that&nbsp;Papirius Dionyſius, whoſe province it was to ſupply&nbsp;the city with profilions, 'contributed towards the famine, in order to make the people riſe againſt Clean</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">der. ' Be this as it will, the populace aſeribed all their calamities to this hated miniſter; and one day,&nbsp;while the people were celebrating the Circaſſian games,&nbsp;a troop of children, having at their head a young woman of an extraordinary ſtature and fierce aſpect, entering the circus, began to utter aloud many bitter invectives and dreadful curſes againſt Cleander ; which&nbsp;being for ſome time anſwered by the people with other&nbsp;invectives and curſes, the whole multitude roſe all of a&nbsp;ſudden, and flew to the place where Cleander at that&nbsp;time reſided with the emperor. There, renewing their&nbsp;invectives, they demanded the head of the miniſter who&nbsp;had been the occaſion of ſo many calamities. Hereupon Cleander ordered the prætorian cavalry to charge&nbsp;the multitude ; which they did accordingly, driving&nbsp;them with great ſlaughter into the city. But the populace diſeharging ſhowers of ſtones, bricks, and tiles,&nbsp;lrom the tops of the houſes and from the windows,&nbsp;and the city-guards at the ſame time taking part with&nbsp;the people, the prætorian horſe were ſoon obliged to '&nbsp;ſave themſelves by flight : nor was the ſlaughter ended&nbsp;till the emperor, appriſed of the tumult, cauſed the head&nbsp;of Cleander to be ſtruck off and thrown out to the enraged populace. The emperor himſelf did not long ſurvive Cleander ; being cut off' by a conſpiracy of Marcia&nbsp;his favourite concubine, Lætus captain of the guards,&nbsp;and Eclectus his chamberlain..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No ſooner was the death of Commodus known, than the ſenate aſſembled, and declared him a public enemy,&nbsp;loading him with curſes, ordering his ſtatues to be broken to pieces, and his name to be raſed out of all public&nbsp;inſeriptions ; and demanded his body, that it might be&nbsp;dragged through the ſlreets, and thrown into the Tiber. But Helvius Pertinax, whom the conſpirators&nbsp;had previouſly deſigned for the empire, and who had&nbsp;already aſſumed it, prevented ſuch an outrage, by letting the ſenators know that Commodus was already&nbsp;buried. This extraordinary perſonage had paſſed&nbsp;through many changes of fortune. He was originally&nbsp;the ſon of an enfranchiſed ſlave, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ælius,</span><span class="font0"> who&nbsp;only gave him ſo much learning as to qualify him for&nbsp;keeping a little ſhop in the city. He then became </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſchoolmaſter, afterwards ſtudied the law, and after&nbsp;that became a ſoldier; in which ſtation his behaviour&nbsp;was ſuch as cauſed him to be ſoon made Captain of&nbsp;a cohort againſt the Parthians. Being thus introduced to arms he went through the uſual gradation of&nbsp;military preferment in Britain and Mæfia, until he became the commander of a legion under Aurelius. In&nbsp;this ſtation he performed ſuch excellent ſervices againſt&nbsp;the barbarians, that he was made conſul, and ſucceſe&nbsp;ſively governor of Dacia, Syria, and Aſia Minor. In&nbsp;the reign of Commodus he was baniſhed; but ſoon after&nbsp;recalled, and font into Britain to reform the abuſes in&nbsp;the army. In this employment his uſual extraordinary&nbsp;fortune attended him : he was oppoſed by a ſedition&nbsp;among the legions, and left for dead among many&nbsp;others that were ſlain. However, he got over this&nbsp;danger, ſeverely puniſhed the mutineers, and eſtabliſhed regularity and diſcipline among the troops he was&nbsp;ſent to command. From thence he was removed into&nbsp;Africa, where the ſedition of the ſoldiers had like to&nbsp;have been as fatal to him as in his former government.&nbsp;Removing from Africa, and fatigued with an active&nbsp;liſe, he betook himſelf to retirement : but Commodus, </span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
