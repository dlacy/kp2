For about eight years a sort of uneasy peace continued between the two rival emperors, Licinius feeling, and hating to feel, the natural superiority of Constantine. Another open rupture was unavoidable; and both parties now made preparations for a contest, the issue of which should be final. Thetwo hostile armies met on thebanksof the Hebrus, near Adrianople. Licinius had taken up a strong and advantageous position, in which he waited the attack of his adversary. For some days the two armies lay and watched each other’s evolutions. At last Constantine with great skill drew his enemy from his position, and forced him to an encounter on equal terms. The battle was fierce, obstinate, and sanguinary ; but the commanding genius, and heroic courage of Constantine secured him a complete victory. The spirit of Licinius was still unbroken. The siege of Byzantium detained Constantine, and allowed his antagonist to muster all his remaining strength, in order to strike one more blow for life and empire. Chrysopolis was the scene of the decisive conflict. But the raw levies of Licinius could not withstand the conquering veterans of Constantine; the struggle produced rather a carnage than a battle, and the utter annihilation ofhis last army left to Licinius no resource but unconditional submission. He was deprived of his imperia, honours, and permitted to retire to Thessalonica, there to pass the remainder ofhis days in obscurity and inglorious ease. But the life of a dethroned monarch is not usually long. He was accused of tampering with the barbarians, and conspiring with their aid to rekindle the flames of war. Such an accusation was of itself enough to cause sentence of death to be pronounced; it was immediately put in execution, and the empire was once more transmitted to the sway of a single emperor.</p><p>Constantine, thus possessed of supreme power, immediately put in force some of those important purposes which had long engaged his thoughts. He issued several edicts for the suppression of idolatry ; and at the same time restored to the Christians both the churches and the property of which they had been deprived during the last persecution. We have not sufficient information to enable us to judge accurately respecting the intentions of Constantine, or respecting the power of circumstances in obliging him to modify his own schemes, so as to adapt them to certain events which he could not altogether mould. But it is scarcely possible to ascribe too much to the deep policy of this emperor. He was well aware of the characters of the two conflicting religions, Christianity and Paganism. He had also marked with discriminating eye the deep degeneracy of Rome and its inhabitants. Neither had the consequences of the partition of the empire by Diocletian escaped his politic observation; and if the hope of preventing its final dissolution was to be cherished, he saw it to be indispensably necessary to attempt a reconstruction of the empire, upon an arrangement entirely new. The whole fabric of the ancient constitution of republican Rome had been pervaded by its religious worship and institutions. It was natural for him to determine that the new constitution of the renovated empire, should be pervaded by the worship and the institutions of Christianity. And as these had already attained a considerable degree of maturity, he adopted them as they were, partly perhaps because he durst not venture to offend the Christians by any attempted reformation, or reconstruction ; partly because the state of his own religious knowledge, so far as we have any means of judging, was very inadequate and imperfect.</p><p>Being resolved to give a new constitution to the Roman empire, and to make Christianity its basis and ruling principle ; being at tlle same time aware of the inveterate force</p><lb/><p>of the associations connecting every thing in Rome with its ancient idolatrous worship, enhancing immensely the difficulty of making any immediate and thorough change there; and having before him the example of Diocletian, Constantine resolved to change the seat of empire, in order to facilitate his change of the imperial constitution. The most formidable enemies of the empire had for a considerable time been the Goths and the Persians ; and the necessity of being nearer to the scene of danger, may have led to the idea of selecting an eastern situation for the new seat of government. The siege of Byzantium, which Constantine had formerly conducted in person, probably directed his attention to that city, as the most eligible situation ; and it must be owned that it possesses advantages almost unequalled, as the seat of an empire both European and Asiatic. On it accordingly the emperor fixed his choice ; and receiving from him immense additions and embellishments, together with a new name, it became <hi rend="italic">Constantinople,</hi>  the new imperial city.</p><p>Previously, however, to this great change in the seat of government, there had been held a general council of the Christian teachers at Nice, for the purpose of determining the Arian controversy, which the emperor attended in person ; and where he obtained the opportunity of making such enactments respecting the civil constitution of the church, as he either deemed it expedient, or found himself enabled to make. But the controversies which at that time, and for a long period afterwards, divided the church, furnished unhappily the means, and set the precedent, of persecutions conducted by one body of Christians against another ; and in which both were too ready to sacrifice their spiritual independence, for the purpose of obtaining the aid of the civil power in crushing their antagonists.</p><p>In the arrangements of his new imperial constitution, Constantine adopted much of the pomp and ceremony of an Asiatic court. A complete disjunction between civil and military authorities took place ; and all the great officers of state were modelled anew, with new titles suited to tile new arrangements, as officers of the court, of the army, and of the civil department. The officers of the court and of state, were chiefly the lords or counts of the bed-chamber and the palace <hi rend="italic">(comites cubiculi, et palatii),</hi>  and tlle ministers of the interior, of the finances, of justice, of the crown-treasury, and of the household troops, or body guards. The officers cf the army were the general-in-chief, and the generals of cavalry and of infantry ; the next class were the counts and dukes <hi rend="italic">(comites ct duces)</hi>  of the army. The civil department was divided into four great <hi rend="italic">prefectures,</hi>  each had its <hi rend="italic">diocese,</hi>  and each diocese its <hi rend="italic">province,</hi>  administered by <hi rend="italic">profecti prœtorio, vicarii,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">rectores provinciarum, </hi>which officers had no military authority, as the military and state officers had no civil power. A new system of taxation was also established, consisting chiefly of a land-tax, a tax upon trade, and the obligatory enforcement of what had formerly been a free gift to the emperor upon extraordinary occasions. Such is a very brief outline of the new constitution given by Constantine to the empire, obviously more Oriental than European or Roman in its character.</p><p>Notwithstanding the Asiatic aspect thus imparted to his government, Constantine retained hisability and readiness for war, when enemies dared to insult his dominions. Several defeats repressed the hostile invasions of the Sarmatians and Goths, who had renewed their attempts upon Thrace ; and the Persian monarch did not venture to provoke the power of an emperor equally renowned for his military and for his civil virtues. Disease atlength assailed a frame that had been long and severely tried by the toils, cares, and indulgences of imperial state ; and after being openly admitted by baptism into that church of which he had been so long an</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
