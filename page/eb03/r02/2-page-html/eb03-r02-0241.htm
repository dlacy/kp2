<p><span class="font1">RONSARD (Peter de) was born at the caſtle of Poiſfoniere in Vendomoιs in 1524. He was deſeended&nbsp;of a noble family, and was educated at Paris in the college of Navarre. Academical purſuits not ſuiting his&nbsp;genius, he left college, and became page to the. duke&nbsp;of Orleans, who reſigned him to James Stuart, king of&nbsp;Scots, married to Magdalene of France. Ronſard continued in Scotland with King James upwards of two&nbsp;years, and afterwards went to Fiance, where he was&nbsp;employed by the duke of Orleans in ſeveral négociations.&nbsp;He accompanied Lazarus de Baiſ to the diet of Spires.&nbsp;Having from the converſation of this learned man imbibed a paſſion for the belles-lettres, he ſtudied the&nbsp;Greek language with Baif’s ſon under Dorat. It is&nbsp;reported of Ronſard, that his practice was to ſtudy till&nbsp;two o’clock in the morning ; and when he went to bed,&nbsp;to awaken Baif, who reſumed his place. The muſes&nbsp;poſſeſſed in' his eyes an infinity of charms ; and he cultivated them with ſuch ſucceſs, that he acquired the appellation of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prince of the Poets</span><span class="font1"> of his time. Henry II. Francis II. Charles IX. and Henry III. loaded&nbsp;him with favours. Having gained the firſt prize of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jeux Flocaux,</span><span class="font1"> they thought the reward promiſed below&nbsp;the merit of the work, and the reputation of the poet.&nbsp;The city of Toulouſe cauſed a Minerva of maſſy ſilver&nbsp;of conſiderable value to be made and ſent to him. This&nbsp;preſent was accompanied with a decree, declaring him&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The French Poet,</span><span class="font1"> by way of diſtinction. Ronſard afterwards made a preſent of his Minerva to Henry II.&nbsp;and this monarch appeared as much elated with this&nbsp;mark of the poet’s eſteem for him, as the poet himſelf&nbsp;could have been had he received the preſent from his&nbsp;ſovereign. Mary, the beautiful and unfortunate queen&nbsp;of Scots, who was equally ſenſible of his merit with the&nbsp;Touloneſe, gave him a very rich ſet of table-plate,&nbsp;among which was a veſſel in the form of a roſe-buſh,&nbsp;repreſenting Mount Parnaſſus, on the top of which was&nbsp;a Pegaſus with this inſcription :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Ronſard, Γ Apollon de la ſource des muſes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the above two anecdotes of him may eaſily be inferred the reputation in which he was held, and&nbsp;which he continued to keep till Malherbe appeared.&nbsp;His works poſſeſs both invention and genius ; but his&nbsp;affectation of everywhere thruſting in his learning, and&nbsp;of forming words from the Greek, the Latin, and the&nbsp;different provincialiſrfts of France, has rendered his ver-ſification diſagreeable and often unintelligible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ronſard, dit Deſpréaux, par une autre méthode, Réglant tout, brouilla tout, jit uη art à la mode ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ft toutefois long temps eut un heureux dejlin ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mais ſa muſe, en François parlant Grec et Latin,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fit dans /’ age ſuivant, par un retour groteſque, Tomber de ſes grands mots le faße pedantejque.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He wrote hymns, odes, a poem called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Franciad, </span><span class="font1">eclogues, epigrams,, ſonnets, &amp;c. In his odes he takes&nbsp;bombaſt for poetical raptures. He wiſhes to imitate&nbsp;Pindar ; and by labouring too much for lofty expreſſions, he lofes himſelf in a cloud of words. He is obſcure and harſh to the laſt degree : faults whieſh he&nbsp;might eaſily have avoided by ſtudying the works of&nbsp;Marot, who had before he wrote brought French poetry very near to perfection. “ Marotſe turn and ſtyle</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">of compoſition are ſuch (ſays Bruyere), that he ſeems to have written after Ronſard : there is hardly any difference, except in a few words, between Marot and us.&nbsp;Ronſard, and the authors his contemporaries, did more&nbsp;diſſervice than good to ſtyle : they checked its courſe&nbsp;in the advances it was making towards perfection, and&nbsp;had like to have prevented its ever attaining it. It&nbsp;is ſurpriſing that Marot, wlioſe works are ſo natural&nbsp;and eaſy, did not make Ronſard, who was fired with&nbsp;the ſtrong enthuſiaſm of poetry, a greater poet than&nbsp;either Ronſard or Marot.” But what could be expected from a man who had ſo little taſte, that he called&nbsp;Marot’s works ‘ a dunghill, from which rich grains of&nbsp;gold by indullrious working might be drawn ?’ As a&nbsp;ſpecimen of our author’s intolerable and ridiculous affectation of learning, which we have already cenſured,&nbsp;Boileau cites the following verſe of Ronſard to his&nbsp;miſtreſs : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eßes-vouGpas mα jeιde entelechie? <sup>i</sup></span><span class="font1"> are not you&nbsp;my only entelechia </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">V</span><span class="font1"> Now </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">entelechia</span><span class="font1"> is a word peculiar to the peripatetic philoſophy, the ſenſe of which&nbsp;does not appear to have ever been fixed. Hermalaus&nbsp;Barbarus is ſaid to have had recourſe to the devil, in&nbsp;order to know the meaning of this new term uſed by&nbsp;Ariſtotle ; but he did-not gain the information he&nbsp;wanted, the devil, probably to conceal his ignorance,&nbsp;ſpeaking in a faint and whiſpering </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ort of voice. What&nbsp;could Ronſard’s miſtreſs therefore, or even Ronſard&nbsp;himſelſ, know of it ; and, what can excuſe in a man of&nbsp;real genius the low affectation of uſing a learned term,&nbsp;becauſe in truth nobody could underſtand it. He has,&nbsp;however, ſome pieces not deſtitute of real merit ; and&nbsp;there are perhaps few effuſions of the French muſe'&nbsp;more truly poetical than his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Four Seaſons of the Tear,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">where a moſt fertile imagination diſplays all its riches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ronſard, though it is doubtful whether he ever was in orders, held ſeveral benefices in commendam; and he&nbsp;died at Saint-Coſme-les-Tours, one of theſe, December&nbsp;27. 1585, being then 61 years of age. He appeared&nbsp;more ridiculous as a man than as a poet : he was particularly vain. He talked of nothing but his family and&nbsp;his alliances with crowned heads. In his panegyrics,&nbsp;which he addreſſes to himſelf without any ceremony, he&nbsp;has the vanity to pretend,, that from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ronſard</span><span class="font1"> is derived&nbsp;the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roſignol,</span><span class="font1"> to denote both a mu</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ician and a poet&nbsp;together- He was born the year after the defeat of&nbsp;Francis I. before Pavia: “Juſt as heaven (ſaid he)&nbsp;wiſhed to indemnify France for the loſſes it had ſuſtained at that place.” He bluſhed not to tell of his intrigues. All the ladies ſought after him ; but he never ſaid that any of them gave him a denial of their favours. His immoderate indulgence in pleaſure, joined&nbsp;to his literary labours, ſerved to haften his old age.&nbsp;In his 50th year he was weak and valetudinarv, and&nbsp;ſubject to attacks off the gout. He retained his wit,&nbsp;&quot;his vivacity, and his readineſs at poetic compoſition, to.&nbsp;his laſt moments. Like all thoſe who aſpire after public eſteem, he had a great number of admirers and ſome&nbsp;enemies. Though Melin de Saint-Gelais railed at him.&nbsp;continually, Rabelais was the perſon whom he moſt&nbsp;dreaded. He took always care to inform himſelf where&nbsp;that jovial rector of Meudon went, that he mi Tit not&nbsp;be found in the ſame place with him. It is reported,&nbsp;that Voltaire acted a ſimilar part with regard to Peron*,&nbsp;of whoſe extemporary ſallies and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bon mots</span><span class="font1"> he was much</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
