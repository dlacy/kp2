He enjoyed a long courſe of uninterrupted health ; but towards the cloſe of life ſuffered from an acute diſeaſe, and was obliged to employ an aſſiſtant in his profeſſional labours for a few years preceding his death, which happened in 1768, at the age of 81. He left to the univerſity his valuable library, which is now arranged apart ſrom the reſt of the books, and the public uſe of it is limited by particular rules. It is conſidered as the moſt choice collection of mathematical books and manuſcripts in the kingdom, and many of them are rendered doubly valuable by Dr Simfon’s notes.</p><p>SIN, a breach or tranſgreſſion of ſome divine law or command.</p><p>SINAI, or SI<hi rend="smallcaps">να,</hi> a famous mountain of Arabia Petræa, upon which God gave the law to Moſes. It ſtands in a kind of peninſula, formed by the two arms of the Red Sea, one of which ſtretches out towards the north, and is called the <hi rend="italic">Gulph of Kolſum;</hi> the other extends towards the eaſt, and is called the <hi rend="italic">Gulph of Elan, </hi>or the <hi rend="italic">Elanih Sea.</hi> At this day the Arabians call Mount Sinai by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tor,</hi> that is, the “ mountain,’  way of excellence ; or <hi rend="italic">Gibel</hi> or J<hi rend="italic">ibel Mouſa, </hi>“ the mountain oſ Moſes.” It is 260 miles from Cairo, and generally it requires a journey of ten days to travel thither. The wilderneſs of Sinai, where the Israelites continued incamped for almoſt a year, and where Moſes erected the tabernacle of the covenant, is conſiderably elevated above the reſt oſ the country ; and the aſcent to it is by a very craggy way, the greateſt part of which is cut out oſ the rock ; then one comes to a large ſpace of ground, which is a plain ſurrounded on all ſides by rocks and eminences, whoſe length is nearly 12 miles. Towards the extremity of this plain, on the north side, two high mountains ſhow themſelves, the higheſt of which is called <hi rend="italic">Sinai</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic">Horeb.</hi> The tops of Horeb and Sinai have a very ſteep aſcent, and do not ſtand upon much ground, in cempariſon to their extraordinary height : that of Sinai is at leaſt one-third part higher than the other, and its aſcent is more upright and difficult.</p><p>Two German miles and a half up the mountain ſtands the convent of St Catharine. The body of this monaſtery is a building 120 feet in length and almoſt as many in breadth. Before it ſtands another ſmall building, in which is the only gate of the convent, which remains always ſhut, except when the bishop is here. At other times, whatever is introduced within the convent, whether men or provisions, is drawn up by the roof in a baſket, and with a cord and a pulley. The whole building is of hewn ſtone ; which, in ſuch a defert, muſt have coſt prodigious expence and pains. Near this chapel issues a fountain of very good fresh water ; it is looked upon as miraculous by ſome who cannot conceive how water can flow from the brow of ſo high and barren a mountain. Five or six paces frona it they ſhow a ſtone, the height oſ which is four or five feet, and breadth about three, which, they ſay, is the very ſtone whence Moſes cauſed the water to guſh out. Its colour is of a ſpotted grey, and it is as it were ſet in a kind of earth, where no other rock appears. This ſtone has 12 holes or channels, which are about a foot wide, whence it is thought the water came forth for the Israelites to drink.</p><p>Much has been ſaid of the writings to be ſeen at Sinai and in the plain about it ; and ſuch were the hopes oſ diſcoveries reſpecting the wanderings of the Iſraelites from theſe writings, that Dr Clayton biſhop of Clogher offered L. 500 Sterling to defray the expences of journey to any man of letters wſho would undertake to copy them. No man, we believe, undertook this taſk : and the accurate Daniſh traveller Niebuhr found no writings there but the names of perſons who had visited the place from curiosity, and of Egyptians who had choſen to be buried in that region.</p><p>SINAPIS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mustard,</hi> in botany: A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">tetradynamia,</hi> and to the order of <hi rend="italic">ſiliquoſa ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem ranged under the 39th order, <hi rend="italic">Siliquoſae.</hi> The calyx conſiſts of four expanding ſtrap-ſhaped deciduous leaves ; the ungues or baſes of the petals are ſtraight ; two glandules between the ſhorter ſtamina and piſtillum, alſo between the longer and the calyx. There are 17 ſpecies ; the arvenſis, orientalis, brassicata, alba, nigra, pyrenaica, pubeſcens, chinenſis, juncea, erucoides, allioni, hiſpanica, millefolia, incana, laevigata, cernua, and japonica. Three of theſe are natives of Britain ; the alba, nigra, and arvenſis.</p><p>1.	The alba, or white muſtard, which is generally cultivated as a ſalad herb for winter and ſpring uſe. This riſes with a branched hairy ſtalk two feet high ; the leaves are deeply jagged on their edges and rough. The flowers are diſpoſed in looſe ſpikes at the end of the branches, ſtanding upon horizontal footſtalks; they have four yellow petals in form of a croſs, which are ſucceeded by hairy pods, that end with long, compreſſed, oblique beaks ; the pods generally contain four white ſeeds.</p><p>2.	The nigra, or common muſtard, which is frequently found growing naturally in many parts of Britain, but is alſo cultivated in fields for the seed, of which the sauce called <hi rend="italic">mustard</hi> is made. This riſes with a branching ſtalk four or five feet high ; the lower leaves are large, rough, and very like thoſe of turnip ; the upper leaves are ſmaller and leſs jagged. The flowers are ſmall, yellow, and grow in ſpiked cluſters at the end of the branches ; they have four petals placed in form oſ a croſs, and are ſucceeded by smooth four-cornered pods.</p><p>3.	The arvenſis, grows naturally on arable land in many parts of Britain. The feed of this is commonly fold under the title of <hi rend="italic">Durham mustard-seed.</hi> Of this there are two varieties, if not diſtinct ſpecies; the one with cut, the other with entire leaves. The ſtalks riſe two ſeet high ; the leaves are rough; in the one they are jagged like turnip-leaves ; in the other they are long and entire. The flowers arc yellow ; the pods are turgid; angular, and have long beaks.</p><p>Muſtard, by its acrimony and pungency, ſtimulates the ſolids, and attenuates viſcid juices; and hence ſtands deſervedly recommended for exciting appetite, aſſiſting digeſtion, promoting the fluid ſecretions, and for the other purpoſes of the acrid plants called <hi rend="italic">antiſcorbutic</hi> It imparts its taſte and smell in perfection to aqueous liquors, and by distillation with water yields an essential oil of great acrimony. To rectified ſpirit its ſeeds give out very little either oſ their ſmell or taſte. Subjected to the preſs, they yield a conſiderable quantity of mild inſipid oil, which is as free from acrimony as that</p></body></text></TEI>
