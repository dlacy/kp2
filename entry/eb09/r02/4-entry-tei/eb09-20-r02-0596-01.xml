<p><label>ROBERT</label>
of Gloucester, an English antiquary and historical writer, who lived in the second half of the 13th century, was a monk of the abbey at Gloucester, and is supposed by Hearne, the editor of his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi> to have been sent to preside over the foundation at Oxford (afterwards Worcester College), where the younger members of the abbey were partly educated. This, however, is mere conjecture. The evidence which establishes his claim to be the author of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> (by which he is best known) is also extremely slight. In the Harleian MS. 201 (from which Hearne printed his edition) there occurs (fol. 159b to 160) an account of the battle of Evesham. The narration implies that the writer was living at that time (1265), for he describes the dark and dismal weather that pre vailed on the day of the battle, adding, “ This isci Roberd, That verst this boc made,”—a passage, however, which may possibly have reference not to the versifier but to the original compiler of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle.</hi> <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> There were others known by the same name ; see Hearne, Pref., p. 58. </note> <hi rend="italic"/> The period at which the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> was composed was evidently late in the 13th or early in the 14th century, as it contains a reference to the canonization of St Louis, king of France, which took place on lltlι August 1297. From an historical point of view, however, the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> is of but little value. The internal evidence shows it to have been a translation from the French and the original in turn to have been a mere compilation. The narrative commences with a description of Britain, taken from Henry of Huntingdon ; the material is next derived mainly from Geoffrey of Monmouth, and then, again, from William of Malmesbury, special information being supplied, here and there, from Henry of Huntingdon, Ailred of Rievaulx, and the Annals of Winchester.</p><p>On the other hand, the value of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> as an illustration of the versification and language of the period is considerable. Λs a writer of English verse Robert comes first in order, being prior to both Robert of Brunne and Laurence Minot, and he has accordingly been styled the Ennius of English literature. His diction, again, affords many interesting points of comparison with that known as Old English on the one hand and the language of Chaucer and William Tyndale on the other. In his verses we first find the term “Saxons” used in opposition to Normans (Hearne, p. 363), although “English” is the term by which, throughout the <hi rend="italic">Chronide,</hi> the original population is more generally designated. Of the English tongue itself, however, he says <hi rend="italic">Cb.,</hi> p. 125) that “]je Saxones speche it was, and ]&gt;orw hem ycome yt ys.” Many of the most noteworthy peculiarities of his diction will be found pointed out in Mr. Kingdon Oliphant’s <hi rend="italic">Old and Middle English,</hi> pp. 430-439.</p><p>Other compositions attributed to Robert of Gloucester are—a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of St Alban in verse (MS. Ashmole, 43), a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of St Patrick, also in verse (MS. Tanner, 17), a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of St Bridget (MS. C.C.C. Camb., 145), and a <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of St Alphege (MS. Cott. Julius, D. ix.).</p><p>The only complete edition of the <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> is that edited by Thomas Heamb (Oxford, 1724), 2 vols. Svo, partly from the Harleian MS. 201, and partly from the Cottonian MS. Calig. A. xi., and reprinted at London in 1810, 2 vols. 8vo. This, however, is extremely defective, Hearne's collation of the important MS. in the library of the college of Arms being very imperfect. For further information see Hardy’s <hi rend="italic">Descriptive Catalogue of ΜSS.,</hi> iii. 181-189, i. 25, 68, iii. 623.</p>
