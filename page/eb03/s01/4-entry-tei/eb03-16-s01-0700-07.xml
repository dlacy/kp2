or <hi rend="smallcaps">Schech,</hi> among the Arabs, is a name applied to their nobles. “Among the Bedouins, ” ſays Niebuhr, “it belongs to every noble, whether of the higheſt or the loweſt order. Their nobles are very numerous, and compoſe in a manner the whole nation; the plebeians are invariably actuated and guided by the ſchiechs, who ſuperintend and direct in every tranſaction. The ſchiechs, and their ſubjects, are born to the life of ſhepherds and ſoldiers. The greater tribes rear many camels, which they either ſell to their neighbours, or employ them in the carriage of goods, or in military expeditions. The petty tribes keep flocks of ſheep. Among thoſe tribes which apply to agriculture, the ſchiechs live always in tents, and leave the culture of their grounds to their ſubjects, whoſe dwellings are wretched huts. Schiechs always ride on horles or dromedaries, inſpecting the conduct of their ſubjects, viſiting their friends, or hunting. Traverſing the deſert, where the horizon is wide as on the ocean, they perceive travellers at a diſtance. As travellers are ſeldom to be met with in thoſe wild tracts, they eaſily diſcover ſuch as paſs that way, and are tempted to pillage them when they find their own party the ſtrongeſt. ”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
