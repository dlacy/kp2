A man of high rank humbles the byſtanders even to annihilate them in their own opinion : Cæfar, beholding the ſtatue of Alexander, was greatly mortified, that now, at the age of 32, when Alexander died, he had not performed one memorable action.</p><p>Ο11Γ opinions alſo are much influenced by companion. A man whoſe opulence exceeds the ordinary ſtandard is reputed richer than he is in reality ; and wiſdom or weakneſs, if at all remarkable in an individual, is generally carried beyond the truth.</p><p>The opinion a man forms of his preſent diſtreis is heightened by contraſting it with his former happi-neſs :</p><p>______Could I forget</p><p>what I have been, I might the better bear IVhat Γm deſtin’d to.

A ſhip toſ-ſed about in a ſtorm, makes the ſpectator reflect upon his own eaſe and ſecurity, and puts theſe in the ſtrong-eſt light.</p><p>A man in grief cannot bear mirth ; it gives him a more lively notion of his unhappineſs, and of courſe makes him more unhappy. Satan, contemplating the heauties of the terreſtrial paradiſe, has the following exclamation :</p><p>with what delight could I have walk’d thee round,</p><p>If I could joy in ought, ſwect interchange Οί hill and valley, rivers, woods, and plains,</p><p>Now land, now fea, and ſhores with foreſt crown’d, Rocks, dcns, and caves ! but I in none of theſe Find place or refuge ; and the more I ſee Pleaſures about me, ſo much more I feel Torment within me, as from the hateful ſtege Qf contraries : all good to me becomes Bane, and in heav’n much worſe would be my ſtate.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Paradiſe Loβ, book</hi>  9. ∕. 114,</p><p>The appearance of danger gives ſometimes pleafure, ſometimes pain. A timorous perſon upon the battlements of a high tower, is ſeized with fear, which even the conſciouſnefs of ſecurity cannot diffipate. But upon one of a firm head, this ſituation has a contrary effect : the appearance of danger heightens, by oppoſition, thc conſciouſnefs of ſecurity, and conſequently the fatisfaction that ariſes from ſecurity ; here the feeling reſem-bles that above-mentioned, occaſioned by a ſhip labouring in a ſtorm.</p><p>The effect of magnifying or leſſening objects by means oſ compariſon is to be attributed to the in-ſtuence of paſſion over our opinions. This will evidently appear by reflecting in what manner a ſpectator is affected, when a very large animal is for the firſt time pla-ced befide a very ſmall one of the ſame ſpecies. The ſtrſt thing that ſtrikes the mind is the difference between the two animals, which is ſo great as to occaſion ſurpriſe ; and this, like other emotions, magnifying its object, makes ns conceive the difference to be the greateſt that can be : we ſee, or ſeem to ſee, the one animal extremely little, and the other extremely large. The emotion of ſurpriſe ariſing from any unuſual reſemblance, ſerves equally to explain, why at ſirſt view we are apt to think fuch reſemblance more entire than it is in reality. And it muſt be obſerved, that the circumſtances of more and lefs, which are the proper ſubjects of compariſon, raife a perception ſo indiſtinct and vague as to facilitate the effect defcribed ; we have no mental ſtandard of great and little, nor of the feveral degrees of any attribute ; and the mind, thus· unreſtrained, is naturally diſpoſed to indulge its furprife to the utmoſt extent.</p><p>In exploring the operations of the mind, ſome of which are extremely nice and ſlippery, it is ncceffary</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
