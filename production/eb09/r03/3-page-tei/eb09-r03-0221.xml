                                                  long been established, and the Norman dukes, like

                                                  their constable. After the Conquest the ducal

                                                  thenceforth held by the grantees and their
                                                  descendants as grand-serjeanties of the crown. The

                                                  steward and chamber-lain of the household. The
                                                  marshal of England took the place of the constable
                                                  of England in the royal palace, and was associated
                                                  with him in the command of the royal armies. In

                                                  the constableship became hereditary, and, although
