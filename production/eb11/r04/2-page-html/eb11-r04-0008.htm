                for men on earth, much of it regulative of ceremonial,&nbsp;but a by no means
                insignificant part embodying rules&nbsp;of conduct. It appears to have had a wider
                range&nbsp;than Jus. It forbade that a war should be undertaken without&nbsp;the
                prescribed fetial ceremonial, and required that faith should&nbsp;be kept even with
                an enemy when a promise had been made&nbsp;to him under sanction of an oath. It
                enjoined hospitality to&nbsp;foreigners, because the stranger guest was presumed,
                equally&nbsp;with his entertainer, to be an object of solicitude to a
                higher&nbsp;power. It punished murder, for it was the taking of a god-given life;
                the sale of a wife by her husband, for she had&nbsp;become his partner in all things
                human and divine; the lifting&nbsp;of a hand against a parent, for it was subversive
                of the first&nbsp;bond of society and religion,—the reverence due by a child&nbsp;to
                those to whom he owed his existence; incestuous connexions,&nbsp;for they defiled
                the altar; the false oath and the broken vow,&nbsp;for they 'were an insult to the
                divinities invoked; the displacement of a boundary or a landmark, not so much
                because&nbsp;the act was provocative of feud, as because the
                march-stone&nbsp;itself, as the guarantee of peaceful neighbourhood, was
                under&nbsp;the guardianship of the gods. Some breaches of </span><span class="font0"
