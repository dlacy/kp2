<p><span class="font1">Lacertilia. Thc zygomatic arch of the Mammalia is formed (cf. also Agamidae) out of the supratemporal arch of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">after the loss of the postorbital element and of the quadrato-jugal, the squamosal gaining connexion with the upper, not posterior and ventral, branch of the jugal or malar bone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The mandibular halves form a complete osseous symphysis, the only instance in reptiles; all the other elements retain their&nbsp;sutures. The articular portion of the articular bone forms&nbsp;several shallow cups and a slight anterior knob, best developed&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone.</span><span class="font1"> The angular bone does not help to form the posterior&nbsp;upper angle. The coronoid, or complementary element, is&nbsp;often small; the supra-angular and the splenial or opercular&nbsp;are always present, mostly also a pre-splenial wanting in&nbsp;Testudinidae (cf. G. Baur).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The hyoid apparatus is well developed, and sometimes assumes large dimensions, especially in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelys. </span><span class="font1">The two pairs&nbsp;of “ horns ” are the first and second branchial arches, whilst&nbsp;the hyoid arches are reduced to a pair of small, frequently only&nbsp;cartilaginous nodules, attached near the anterior corners of the&nbsp;basis linguae, which generally fuses with the os entoglossum in&nbsp;the tip of the tongue. In Chelydidae the long median basal or&nbsp;copular piece forms a semi-canal for the reception of the trachea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the skull of the Lacertilia the arcades over the temporal region vary much in composition and numbers. There are at&nbsp;most two arcades and two windows. First the posttemporal&nbsp;arcade, enclosing the posttemporal fenestra, which is. framed&nbsp;mainly by the large paroccipital process below and the long&nbsp;parietal process above, both meeting distally, and the quadrate&nbsp;is carried by the paroccipital process. In the corner, in front,&nbsp;where the three bones meet, lies the squamosal, connecting&nbsp;parietal and quadrate. This squamosal, when not too much</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">reduced, has an upper parietal and an anterior horizontal arm ; the latter is essential for the formation of the second horizontal&nbsp;arcade, which makes the lower border of the supra-temporal&nbsp;window. The infra-temporal arcade, namely a quadrato-jugal&nbsp;+jugal arch, is absent in all Laccrtilians owing to the complete&nbsp;absence of the quadrato-jugal element.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Heloderma</span><span class="font1"> and Geckos the posttemporal is the only arcade. In the Amphisbaenids and in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aniella,</span><span class="font1"> practically also in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anelytropsis,</span><span class="font1"> all the arcades are lost. All thc other families&nbsp;of lizards and the chameleons have two arcades. We begin the&nbsp;description of the horizontal arcade with those families in which&nbsp;it is most complete, and most like that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon.</span><span class="font1"> In&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Varanus</span><span class="font1"> it is formed by four bones. The postfrontal is short;&nbsp;to it is attached the postorbital, which sends a long horizontal&nbsp;process to join the squamosal@@<sup>1</sup> splint, and this connects with the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> There is a much-debated question of the homologies, of the one or two elements, both apparently membrane bones, which connect&nbsp;the upper end of the quadrate with the parietal and with the supra-temporal arch. The question becomes acute in the snakes, whether&nbsp;the single element connecting skull and quadrate has to be called&nbsp;squamosal or supratemporal. Space forbids here to expound the&nbsp;matter, which has been very ably reviewed by S. W. .WilIiston&nbsp;(“ Temporal Arches in the Reptiha,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Biolog. Bulletin,</span><span class="font0"> vii. No. 4,&nbsp;1904, pp. 175-192;\:f. also F. W. Thyng, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tufts College Studies,</span><span class="font0"> II.&nbsp;2, 1906). About ten different names have been applied to these two&nbsp;elements, and two, namely, squamosal and supratemporal, are&nbsp;being used quite promiscuously. When only one element is present,&nbsp;the present writer uses the term squamosal, and there are reasons&nbsp;making it probable that this element is the squamosum of mammals.&nbsp;When both elements are present, the more ventral or lateral of the&nbsp;two is termed squamosal, that which always helps to form the</span></p>
