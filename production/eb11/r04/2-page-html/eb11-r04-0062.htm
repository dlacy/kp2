<p><span class="font1">report; they do not imply the presence of friends upon the spot who kept him supplied with information. On the other hand,&nbsp;the circle of people addressed in xvi. 1-23, with its wealth of&nbsp;individual colour and personal detail, presupposes a sphere&nbsp;where Paul had worked for long. He can appeal to these&nbsp;Christians. He can speak sharply with authority to them.&nbsp;Now, as he wrote from Corinth, the only other city which&nbsp;answers to this description is Ephesus, the centre of Paul’s&nbsp;long Asiatic mission. With that city and district several of the&nbsp;names in xvi. 1-23 are more or less directly connected, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Epaenetus (5), Aquila and Priscilla (3), who were at Ephesus&nbsp;immediately before Romans was written (Acts xviii. 18, 26; cf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cor. xvi. 19), and apparently were there (cf. 2 Tim. iv. 19) not&nbsp;long afterwards. These are the first people mentioned in the&nbsp;note, nor is there any likelihood that they or the rest of Paul’s&nbsp;friends<sup>@@1</sup> had made a sudden migration to the capital. Doubtless, there was fairly constant communication between Rome&nbsp;and the provinces, and in the course of time these friends may&nbsp;have gradually followed the apostle thither. Hence it is not&nbsp;remarkable that almost all the names mentioned in this note&nbsp;have been found by archaeologists (cf. Lightfoot’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philippians,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">pp. 171 f.) within the Roman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Inserìptionum.</span><span class="font1"> Most of&nbsp;them, anyhow, are fairly common throughout the Roman world&nbsp;(cf. Lietzmann, p. 73), whilst half are to be found in the Greek&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus Inscriptionum</span><span class="font1"> for Asia Minor </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Epaenetus, Hermes,&nbsp;Hermas).<sup>@@2</sup> Furthermore, the sharp warning against errorists&nbsp;and heretics (xvi. 17-20) suits Rome at this period much less&nbsp;aptly than Ephesus (cf. 1 Cor. xvi. 8-9; Acts xx. 29 f.; Rev. ii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;f.), where trouble of this kind was in the air. Controversy&nbsp;against false teachers is conspicuously absent from Romans.&nbsp;Nor is it possible to regard (with Zahn) such counsels as merely&nbsp;prophylactic; they are too definite and pointed. They imply&nbsp;the existence of a community with which Paul was personally&nbsp;acquainted, and to which he felt himself bound and free to&nbsp;address keen, authoritative reproaches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The textual phenomena of the doxology (xvi. 25-27), which occurs in some MSS. after xiv. 23, are sufficiently strange;&nbsp;they suggest that the epistle must have passed through a&nbsp;certain process of editing, during the 2nd century, previous&nbsp;to its final incorporation in the canon of the epistles.<sup>@@3</sup> It may&nbsp;further be conjectured that the epistle does not lie before the&nbsp;modern reader in the precise shape in which it left Paul and his&nbsp;amanuensis at Corinth. Opinions, indeed, vary on the doxology.&nbsp;Either it is authentic but irrelevant, added by Paul as a post-scriDt. or it is unauthentic<sup>@@4</sup> due to some copyist who added it as</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">a suitable finale at the close. In the Pauline canon Romans originally occupied the last place. It would therefore be&nbsp;natural that a note like that of xvi. 1-23 should be put in here,&nbsp;especially if this canon was drawn up at Rome, whither Phoebe&nbsp;probably travelled eventually. The doxology would then be&nbsp;shifted from after xiv. 23 or inserted for the first time for ecclesiastical purposes. The material conditions of such a process are&nbsp;lucidly stated by Dr C. R. Gregory in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Canon and Text of the&nbsp;New Testament</span><span class="font1"> (1907), PP- 3<sup>J</sup>9 f-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The problems presented by the structure of these chapters<sup>@@5 </sup>cannot be solved adequately by the mere hypothesis, worked&nbsp;out variously by critics like Paulus, Griesbach </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Curarum in&nbsp;historiam lextus Graeci epistolarum Pauli spec.</span><span class="font1"> i. pp. 45 f.),&nbsp;Eichhorn and Flatt, that they are a series of postscripts or&nbsp;afterthoughts, much less by the conjecture that, in whole&nbsp;or in part, they are unauthentic (Baur, Volkmar, &amp;c.). The&nbsp;only tenable line of argument, in the present state of criticism,&nbsp;is to regard their phenomena as due to compilation, at the&nbsp;time when the canon (perhaps of Paul’s epistles) was first&nbsp;formed. If the hypothesis already outlined is set aside, it is&nbsp;open to the critic to regard large portions of the canonical&nbsp;Romans as having originally occupied a separate setting,<sup>@@6</sup>&nbsp;or to ascribe the textual variations to the exigencies of church&nbsp;reading after the formation of the canon (which might explain&nbsp;the absence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kv</span><span class="font1"> ’Pw/xg in i. 7, 15, and the duplicate position&nbsp;of the doxology).<sup>@@7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The uncertainty as to the literary structure of the epistle naturally renders it hazardous to infer the character of the&nbsp;Christians who are addressed, but it may be said that the&nbsp;results of the long debate on this point are converging upon&nbsp;the belief that the predominant class in the local church or&nbsp;churches were Gentile Christians, while proselytes must have&nbsp;swelled the ranks to no inconsiderable degree. Since Weiz-sacker wrote, the older view of Baur (cf. his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paul,</span><span class="font1"> Eng. tr.&nbsp;i. pp. 321 f.) has steadily lost ground. Zahn is now its main&nbsp;supporter, and his contentions are not convincing. Even&nbsp;were ix.-xi. taken as the kernel of the epistle, its obvious&nbsp;motive is to be found in the need of explaining to Gentile&nbsp;Christians the reasons for Israel’s apparent rejection, and&nbsp;passages like i. 5 f., 13, xi. 13, xv. 15 f., are, if not decisive, at&nbsp;any rate superior to any references which can be urged fairly&nbsp;on the opposite side. To a church of this kind, in the capital&nbsp;of the Empire, Paul writes out his gospel more fully than in&nbsp;any other of his extant epistles. It is the essence of the&nbsp;gospel that he treats, and that is the revelation of God’s&nbsp;righteousness to man by faith in Jesus Christ. Neither&nbsp;sacraments nor organization come within his purview. Even&nbsp;eschatology lies quite in the background. Paul writes of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

The point&nbsp;of such hypotheses is to explain how the note came to be attached&nbsp;to Romans, but this can be shown otherwise (cf. Deissmann’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Licht vom Osten,</span><span class="font1"> 1908, pp. 164, 201). Eichhorn </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Einleit, in das N.T.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">iii. 243 f.) regarded xvi. 1-20 as addressed to Corinth, while Schenkel&nbsp;viewed it as designed for all the churches which Phoebe was to visit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2</sup> In the Ephesian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Acta Johannis (c. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 160) the house, of Andronicus (Rom. xvi. 7?) is one centre of Christian activity.&nbsp;E.

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@3 </sup>The most recent and radical analyses are those of Spitta </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Urchristentum,</span><span class="font1"> iii. 1902) and Völter </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Paulus u. seine Briefe,</span><span class="font1"> 1905).&nbsp;The former detects a short letter written (xii.-xv. 7, xvi. 1-20) after&nbsp;Acts xxviii. 30, during a tour of the Gentile churches </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 63-64),&nbsp;and another (i.-xi. 10, xv. 14-33) written to believing Jews in order&nbsp;to justify the Gentile mission and afterwards edited for Gentile,&nbsp;readers with the addition of xi. 11 f., xv. 8-13, &amp;c, Völter (pp. 135 f.)&nbsp;distinguishes an original letter (in i. 1, 5^-7, 8-17, v. 1-12, 15-19,&nbsp;21, vi. 1-13, ifi-23, xii.-xv. 6, xv. 14-16, 23ZH-33, xvi. 21-24) f<sup>fOm&nbsp;</sup>editorial additions, and also from still later accretions in ii. 14-15,&nbsp;iii. 23-26, vii. 256, xi. 11 f., xv. 7-13, 17-230, xvi. 17 f., 25 f.
