<p><span class="font0">Secondary and higher education are also free. There are gymnasia, or grammar schools of four classes, roughly corresponding with the German sub-gymnasia ; and lyceums of eight classes, which&nbsp;answer to the German gymnasia. Up to the fourth class all pupils&nbsp;are. taught alike in the lyceums; in the fifth, however, they are&nbsp;divided into a literary or “ humanist ” section, and a scientific or&nbsp;“ realist ” section. The four upper classes are taught French and&nbsp;German.; English and Italian being added for the “ realists,” Greek&nbsp;and Latin for the “ humanists.” Technical instruction is given in&nbsp;the agricultural schools; in various arts and crafts institutes, such&nbsp;as those of Bucharest and Jassy; in the veterinary and engineering&nbsp;colleges of Bucharest; in numerous commercial schools, and in&nbsp;schools of domestic economy for girls. In 1909-10 there were four&nbsp;ecclesiastical seminaries, seven training schools for teachers and&nbsp;eight military schools. The cost of education is largely borne by&nbsp;the communes, as well as by the state. At Bucharest and Jassy&nbsp;there are universities with faculties of law, philosophy, science and&nbsp;medicine and theology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Antiquities.</span><span class="font0">—The history of primitive civilization in Rumania can be traced back to the Neolithic Age; numerous remains of this period&nbsp;have been found at Vodastra in the Romanatzi department. Roman&nbsp;rule left a deep imprint on the. country. The following .Roman&nbsp;towns have been identified.: (1) in the Dobrudja, Cius (Hirsovab&nbsp;Troësmis (Iglitza), Arrubium (Machin)., .Viodunum (lsakcha),&nbsp;Istrus (Karaharman), Tropaeum (Adam Klissi), Kallatis(Mangalia),&nbsp;Tomi (Constantza) ; (2) in Moldavia, Dinogetia (Tiglina); (3) in&nbsp;Walachia, Drobetae (Turnu Severin), Malya (Celeiu), Castra Nova&nbsp;(Craiova), Romula (Resca), Sori.um (Roshiori de Vedc), Pelendava&nbsp;(Bradesci), Acidava (Jenuseshti), Rusidâva (Draga^ani), Castra&nbsp;Traiana (Râmnicu Vâlcea), Arutela (Bivolari), Pons Vetus. (Caineni),&nbsp;Komidava (Petroasa), Ramidava (Buzeu). A great military road&nbsp;encircled the Dobruaja hills and skirted the Bulgarian shore of the&nbsp;Danube. It was linked by a ferry at. Celeiu to two lesser roads; one&nbsp;striking northwards into Transylvania, up the Olt valley, the other&nbsp;bending westwards until it reached the Jiu, and there diverging&nbsp;southwards to Turnu Severin, and northwards to the Vulcan Pass.&nbsp;The plains near the Olt and Jiu estuaries are rich in Roman remains,&nbsp;notably in the towns of Caracal, Grodjibod and Islaz. Ruins and&nbsp;inscriptions may be seen at.Resca, a temple at Slaveni., villas and a&nbsp;statue of the emperor Commodus (a.d. 161-92) at Celeiu. All these&nbsp;lie within a radius of 60 m. Two ramparts, known as Trajan’s&nbsp;wall, can be discerned, one on either side of the railway from&nbsp;Cernavoda to Constantza; and there were bridges over the Danube&nbsp;at Turnu Severin and Turnu Magurele. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tropaeum Trajani,</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;Adam Klissi monument (found near Rassova in the Dobrudja and&nbsp;removed to Bucharest museum), is a round stone structure of 100 ft.&nbsp;circumference and 40 ft. high, carved in low relief with scenes representing Trajan’s conquest of Dacia. (See G. Tocilescu, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Das Monument von Adam Klissi,</span><span class="font0"> Vienna, 1895.) Few monuments were left&nbsp;by the barbarian invaders who ravaged Rumania from the 3rd&nbsp;century to the 14th save some vestiges of Gothic culture at Buzeu,&nbsp;and at Petroasa, close by. The celebrated treasure of Petroasa&nbsp;(commonly written Petrossa), preserved in Bucharest museum,&nbsp;consists of embossed and jewelled gold plate, and probably dates&nbsp;from the 6th century (see Plate). Medieval tapestries, with&nbsp;ecclesiastical vestments, ornaments and some fine pieces of early&nbsp;woodwork, are also preserved in Bucharest museum. The attempt&nbsp;to create a national style of architecture, based on Greek and&nbsp;Byzantine models, began under Stephen the Great of Moldavia&nbsp;(1457-1504), lasting until the 17th century, when it was arrested,&nbsp;first by political disorders, and, later, by the commercial development which caused a demand for cheap and rapid building. Its&nbsp;chief accomplishment is the cathedral of Curtea de Argesh (g.r.).&nbsp;Painting and sculpture, like modern Rumanian architecture, are&nbsp;still in their infancy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">History</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Introduction.—</span><span class="font0">The earliest record of the lands which&nbsp;constitute the kingdom of Rumania begins with the period&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dacia</span><span class="font0"> immediately preceding their conquest by the Romans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For information upon this period, and upon the subsequent centuries of Roman or Byzantine rule, see</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dacia. From the 6th to the 12th century, w</span><span class="font0"><sup>T</sup>ave after wave of barbarian conquerors, Goths, Tatars, Slavs and. others,&nbsp;passed over the country, and, according to one school of&nbsp;historians, almost obliterated its original Daco-Roman population; the modern Vlachs, on this theory, representing a later&nbsp;body of immigrants from Transdanubian territory. According&nbsp;to others, the ancient inhabitants were, at worst, only submerged for a time, and their direct descendants are the Rumans&nbsp;of to-day. Each of these conflicting views is supported by&nbsp;strong evidence; and the whole controversy, too large and&nbsp;too obscure for discussion here, is considered under the heading&nbsp;Vlachs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Towards the close of the 13th century, Walachia and Moldavia were occupied by a mixed population, composed partly of&nbsp;Vlachs, but mainly of Slavs and Tatars; in Great Walachia,@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>also called Muntenia, the Petchenegs and Cumanians&nbsp;predominated. Rumanian historians have striven, by&nbsp;piecing together the stray fragments of evidence which&nbsp;survive, to prove that their Vlach ancestors had not,&nbsp;as sometimes alleged, been reduced to a scattered community of nomadic shepherds, dwelling among the Carpathians&nbsp;as the serfs of their more powerful neighbours. The researches&nbsp;of Ila^dcu, Xenopol and other historians tend to show the&nbsp;existence of a highly organized Vlach society in Transylvania,&nbsp;Oltland and certain districts of Hungary’ and Moldavia; of&nbsp;a settled commonalty, agricultural rather than pastoral; and&nbsp;of a hereditary feudal nobility, bound to pay tribute and render&nbsp;military service to the Hungarian crown, but enjoying many&nbsp;privileges, which were defined by a distinct customary law </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(jus&nbsp;valahicum).</span><span class="font0"> Although the characteristic titles of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">voivode, knez&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ban</span><span class="font0"> (all implying military as well as civil authority) are&nbsp;of Slavonic origin, and perhaps derived from the practice of&nbsp;the later Bulgarian (or Bulgaro-Vlachian) empire, the growth&nbsp;of Vlach feudal institutions is attributed to German influences,&nbsp;which permeated through Hungarian channels into the Vlach&nbsp;world, and transformed the primitive tribal chiefs into a feudal&nbsp;aristocracy of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">boiars</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">boyards@@<sup>2</sup> </span><span class="font0">(nobles).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the 13th century, at latest, begins the authentic political history of the Vlachs in Rumania, but it is not the history of&nbsp;a united people. The two principalities of Walachia&nbsp;and Moldavia developed separately, and each has its&nbsp;separate annals. About the year 1774 it first&nbsp;becomes possible to trace the progress of these&nbsp;Danubian Principalities in a single narrative, oving to&nbsp;the uniform system of administration adopted by the&nbsp;Turkish authorities, and the rapid contemporary growth of&nbsp;a national consciousness among the Vlachs. At last, in 1859,&nbsp;the two principalities were finally united under the name of&nbsp;Rumania. The subjoined history of the country is arranged&nbsp;under the four headings: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Walachia, Moldavia,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Danubian&nbsp;Principalities</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rumania,</span><span class="font0"> in order to emphasize this historical development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Walachia.—</span><span class="font0">Tradition, as embodied in a native chronicle&nbsp;of the 16th century, entitled the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Ruman Land since&nbsp;the arrival of the Rumans (Istoria lieret Romdntscl de&nbsp;c&amp;ndu au desedlieata Romdnil),</span><span class="font0"> gives a precise account&nbsp;of the founding of the Walachian state by Radu Negru,&nbsp;or Rudolf the Black (otherwise known as Negru Voda,&nbsp;the Black Prince), voivode of the Rumans of Fogaras in&nbsp;Transylvania, who in 1290 descended with a numerous people&nbsp;into the Transalpine plain and established his capital first&nbsp;at C&amp;mpulung and then at Curtea de Argesh. Radu dies in&nbsp;1310, and is succeeded by a series of voivodes whose names and&nbsp;dates are duly given; but this early chapter of Walachian&nbsp;history has been rudely handled by critical historians. A&nbsp;considerable body of Vlachs doubtless emigrated from Hungary&nbsp;at this time, and founded in Walachia a principality dependent</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2 </sup>In later Rumanian history there arose a class who obtained their rank by merit or favour, and did not necessarily .bequeath it to their&nbsp;heirs. But the hereditary aristocracy also survived, and feudalism&nbsp;remained characteristic of Rumanian society up to i860.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
