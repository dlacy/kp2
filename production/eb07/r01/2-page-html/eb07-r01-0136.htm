<p><span class="font0">There still remain two other true crocodiles, described by M. Graves, @@<sup>1</sup> and which he regards as new ; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. Gra-vesii</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jtmrnei</span><span class="font0"> of Bory de St Vincent. Both of them are&nbsp;in the Bordeaux museum. The habitat of the former is&nbsp;believed to be the Congo, and of the latter America. All&nbsp;the bones of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gravesii</span><span class="font0"> are as if pierced with small holes,&nbsp;a character they possess in common with some of the alligators. Its head is of the shape of a slender isosceles triangle ; the extremity of the snout is rounded, and its surface covered with great obtuse tubercles, having no regular arrangement. The ninth, tenth, and eleventh teeth of&nbsp;the lower jaw are received into a furrow, as well as the&nbsp;fourth. The colour of the upper part is a dark deep brown,&nbsp;that of the lower a dull yellow. The snout of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Journei&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is very slender, approaching to that of the gavials ; it is convex as well as long, and near its extremity is almost cylindrical. The back of this species is of a deep yellowish&nbsp;green ; the flanks are yellowish, and the belly yellow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Genus Alligator, Cuv. The alligators are by far the most common representatives of this group in the new&nbsp;world ; although, as we have already seen, there are true&nbsp;crocodiles in St Domingo, and probably in many other localities. In most parts of America they are known by the&nbsp;title of cayman, a name apparently of African origin, and&nbsp;applied by the negroes, not to the alligators only, but indifferently to every species of the group. It does not seem&nbsp;to be yet ascertained whether any true caymans are found&nbsp;in the old world. Adanson thought he discovered one&nbsp;in the Senegal ; M. de Beauvais states that he saw one in&nbsp;Guinea ; and Cuvier thinks it most probable that they have&nbsp;their representatives in our hemisphere. They possess all&nbsp;the power and ferocity of the true crocodiles, and in many&nbsp;places are found in astonishing numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The head of the alligators is not so oblong as that of the true crocodiles ; the snout is broad and obtuse ; the teeth&nbsp;are somewhat unequal, the number ranging from nineteen&nbsp;to twenty-two on each side of each jaw ; the fourth of the&nbsp;under jaw is received, not into a lateral furrow of the upper&nbsp;one, but into a distinct foramen. Their feet are only semi-palmated, and are not denticulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A. lucius,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv.; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Croc. Cuvieri,</span><span class="font0"> Leach. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pike-muzzled alligator.</span><span class="font0"> This is peculiarly the alligator of the southern&nbsp;parts of North America, including Carolina, the Floridas,&nbsp;and Louisiana. In the Mississippi it ascends as far as the&nbsp;thirty-second degree north, a higher latitude than any species reaches in the old world. In these countries they frequent the muddy banks, and quite bury themselves in the&nbsp;cold season, falling into a lethargic state before the setting&nbsp;in of the frost. @@<sup>2</sup> This sleep is so profound that they may&nbsp;be almost cut to pieces without manifesting any sign of life ;&nbsp;when the warm weather returns, they are soon roused into activity. According to Bosc, their eggs are white, and&nbsp;not larger than those of the turkey. They are good eating, and are prized by the natives, though they partake of&nbsp;the musky smell of the animal. As soon as they escape,&nbsp;the young betake themselves to the water ; but the vast&nbsp;majority become the prey of turtles, fish, and amphibious&nbsp;animals, not excluding the older of their own species.&nbsp;During the first year they feed upon insects and very young&nbsp;fish. Bosc states that he preserved a brood of fifteen.&nbsp;They ate only living insects ; and never captured them except when moving, upon which they darted at them with&nbsp;great velocity. They appeared quite gentle when he took&nbsp;them in his hand. At the end of the first year they are&nbsp;still very feeble creatures; during the second they acquire their formidable teeth. The duration of their existence is not precisely ascertained, but is supposed to equal</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">that of man. They never cast their skin ; and on acquiring their full size, few animals can injure them. They can fast&nbsp;long. They live on frogs, fish, aquatic birds, on dogs, hogs,&nbsp;cattle, and any animal they can catch ; when these go to&nbsp;the river to drink, they seize them by the muzzle or leg,&nbsp;and draw them into the water to drown them. “ I used&nbsp;often,” adds the traveller last named, “ to amuse myself,&nbsp;bringing them from their retreats by making my dog bark.&nbsp;Sometimes I used to advance and strike them with my stick,&nbsp;at which they were little disturbed. They never thought&nbsp;of attacking me, and deliberately retired when they found&nbsp;their hunting promised no success.” Though slow on land,&nbsp;they swim with great velocity. In Carolina they make deep&nbsp;burrows, where they pass the whole winter, and even the&nbsp;entire day in summer. Though usually met with on the&nbsp;edges of rivers and lakes, they are sometimes also found in&nbsp;ponds in woods. Bosc often attempted to take them with&nbsp;every kind of strong snare ; but these were invariably broken&nbsp;to pieces. They are commonly taken with a strong hook&nbsp;bated with a bird or small quadruped, and connected by a&nbsp;chain to a tree. The Indians eat the tail only. At the&nbsp;time of reproduction they fight furiously with each other,&nbsp;and bellow as loud as bulls. They avoid the salt water and&nbsp;proximity to the sea, because they are there exposed to the&nbsp;attacks of sharks and the great turtle. In very warm districts in the Floridas, the rivers are sometimes quite crowded w'ith them, so that they almost interrupt the navigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The specific characters of the pike-headed alligator are a flat snout, the sides of which are nearly parallel, uniting&nbsp;in front in a regular curve. There are eighteen transverse&nbsp;rows of scales on the back. The colour above is a deep&nbsp;greenish brown, beneath white tinged with green, and the&nbsp;flanks are regularly striated with the two colours. Catesby&nbsp;has seen them fourteen feet long. Its hide, except at particular spots, resists a musket ball ; it is most vulnerable at&nbsp;the inferior part of the belly, and round the eye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The great alligator of North America certainly forms one of the most remarkable features in the zoology of the United&nbsp;States. Whatever may be said of the African or South&nbsp;American species, this huge reptile is usually neither shy&nbsp;nor dangerous. Its ordinary motion on land is slow and&nbsp;sluggish, a kind of laboured crawling, which leaves the track&nbsp;of a lengthened trail upon the mud, like the keel of a small&nbsp;vessel. When met with at any distance from the water, it&nbsp;immediately squats, that is, lies as flat as it can, with its nose&nbsp;upon the ground, and staring around with rolling eyes.&nbsp;“ Should a man approach them,” says that accurate and admirable describcr Audubon, “ they do not attempt either&nbsp;to make away or attack, but merely raise their body from&nbsp;the ground for an instant, swelling themselves, and issuing&nbsp;a dull blowing sound, not unlike that of a blacksmith’s bellows. Not the least danger need be apprehended ; you&nbsp;either kill them with ease, or leave them.” As if conscious&nbsp;of their incapacity of self-defence, they seldom travel except during the night, being then less subject to disturbance, besides “ having a better chance to surprise a litter&nbsp;of pigs, or of land-tortoises, for prey.” “ In Louisiana,’’ Mr&nbsp;Audubon observes, “ all our lagoons, bayous, creeks, ponds,&nbsp;lakes, and rivers, are well stocked with them ; they are&nbsp;found wherever there is a sufficient quantity of water to&nbsp;hide them, or to furnish them with food ; and they continue thus in great numbers as high as the mouth of the Arkansas river, extending east to North Carolina, and as far&nbsp;west as I have penetrated. On the Red River, before it&nbsp;was navigated by steam-vessels, they were so extremely&nbsp;abundant, that to see hundreds at a sight along the shores,&nbsp;or on the immense rafts of floating or stranded timber, was</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
