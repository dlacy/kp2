<p><span class="font0">Thereupon public discontent swelled, and especially when, by the foundation of the papal palace of Avignon, it was&nbsp;evident that Benedict XII. had no intention of restoring&nbsp;the Holy See to Italy. This pope was succeeded in 1342&nbsp;by Clement VI. (1342-52), and King Robert in 1343 by&nbsp;his niece Joanna ; and the latter event, while plunging the&nbsp;kingdom in anarchy, likewise aggravated the condition of&nbsp;Rome. For not only were the Neapolitan sovereigns still&nbsp;very powerful there, but the principal Roman nobles held&nbsp;large fiefs across the Neapolitan borders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Shortly before this another revolution in Rome had re-established the government of the Thirteen and the&nbsp;two senators. The people, being anxious to show their&nbsp;intention of respecting the papal authority, had despatched&nbsp;to Avignon as ambassador of the republic, in 1343, a man&nbsp;destined to make much noise in the world. This was&nbsp;Cola di Rienzo, sou of a Roman innkeeper, a notary, and&nbsp;an impassioned student of the Bible, the fathers, Livy,&nbsp;Seneca, Cicero, and Valerius Maximus. Thoroughly&nbsp;imbued with a half pagan half Christian spirit, he believed&nbsp;that he had a divinely inspired mission to revive the&nbsp;ancient glories of Rome. Of handsome presence, full&nbsp;of fantastic eloquence, and stirred to enthusiasm by&nbsp;contemplation of the ruined monuments of Rome, he&nbsp;harangued the people with a stilted oratory that enchanted&nbsp;their ears. He hated the nobles, because one of his&nbsp;brothers had been killed by them ; he loved the republic,&nbsp;and in its name addressed a stately Latin speech to the&nbsp;astonished pope, and, offering him the supreme power,&nbsp;besought his instant return to Rome. He also begged him&nbsp;to allow the city to celebrate a jubilee every fifty years,&nbsp;and then, as a personal request, asked to be nominated&nbsp;notary to the urban chamber. The pope consented to&nbsp;everything, and Rienzi communicated this good news to&nbsp;Rome in an emphatically worded epistle. After Easter, in&nbsp;1344, he returned to Rome, and found to his grief that&nbsp;the city was a prey to the nobles. He immediately began&nbsp;to admonish the latter, and then, draped in a toga adorned&nbsp;with symbols, exhibited and explained allegorical designs&nbsp;to the people, and announced the speedy restoration of&nbsp;the past grandeur of Rome. Finally he and a few&nbsp;burghers and merchants, whom he had secretly inflamed&nbsp;by his discourses, made a solemn vow to overthrow the&nbsp;nobility and consolidate the republic. The moment was&nbsp;favourable, owing to the anarchy of Naples, the absence&nbsp;of the pope, the weakness of the empire, and the disputes&nbsp;of the barons, although the latter were still very potent and&nbsp;constituted, as it were, a separate government opposed to&nbsp;that of the people. Rienzi, having gained the pope’s ecclesiastical vicar to his side, passed in prayer the night of&nbsp;the 19th May 1347, placing his enterprise under the protection of the Holy Spirit, and the following day marched&nbsp;to the Capitol, surrounded by his adherents, convoked a&nbsp;parliament of the people, and obtained its sanction for the&nbsp;following proposals :—that all pending lawsuits should&nbsp;be at once decided ; that justice should be equally&nbsp;administered to all ; that every region should equip one&nbsp;hundred foot soldiers and twenty-five horse ; that the dues&nbsp;and taxes should be rearranged ; that the forts, bridges,&nbsp;and gates of the city should be held by the rector of the&nbsp;people instead of by the nobility; and that granaries&nbsp;should be opened for the public use. On the same day,&nbsp;amid general homage and applause, Rienzi was proclaimed&nbsp;head of the republic, with the title of tribune and liberator&nbsp;of the Holy Roman Republic, “ by authority of the most&nbsp;merciful Lord Jesus Christ.” The nobles withdrew&nbsp;scoffing but alarmed. Rienzi engaged a body-guard of&nbsp;one hundred men, and assumed the command of thirteen&nbsp;hundred infantry and three hundred and ninety light&nbsp;horse ; he abolished the senators, retained the Thirteen&nbsp;and the general and special councils, and set the administration on a new footing. These measures and the prompt&nbsp;submission of the other cities of the state brought an&nbsp;instant increase of revenue to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This revolution, as will be noted, was of an entirely novel stamp. For its leader despatched envoys to all&nbsp;the cities of Italy, exhorting them to shake off the&nbsp;yoke of their tyrants, and send representatives to the&nbsp;parliament convoked for the 1st August, inasmuch as the&nbsp;liberation of Rome also implied the “ liberation of the&nbsp;sacred land of Italy.” In Rienzi’s judgment the Roman&nbsp;revolution must be, not municipal, but national, and even&nbsp;in some points universal. And this idea was welcomed&nbsp;with general enthusiasm throughout the peninsula.&nbsp;Solemn festivals and processions were held in Rome ; and,&nbsp;when the tribune went in state to St Peter’s, the canons&nbsp;met him on the steps chanting the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Veni, Creator Spimtus.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Even the pope, willingly or unwillingly, accorded his&nbsp;approval to Rienzi’s deeds. The provincial cities did&nbsp;homage to Rome and her tribune, and almost all the rest&nbsp;of Italy gave him its enthusiastic adherence. The ancient&nbsp;sovereign people seemed on the point of resuscitation. And&nbsp;others besides the multitude were fascinated and carried&nbsp;off their feet. Great men like Petrarch were transported&nbsp;with joy. The poet lauded Cola di Rienzo as a sublime&nbsp;and supernatural being, the greatest of ancient and modern&nbsp;men. But it was soon evident that all this enthusiasm&nbsp;was mainly factitious. On the 26th of July a new parliament was called, and this decreed that all the rights and&nbsp;privileges granted to the empire and church must now be&nbsp;vested in the Roman people, from whom they had first&nbsp;emanated. But on the convocation of the national parliament few representatives obeyed the summons and the&nbsp;scheme was a failure. All had gone well so long as&nbsp;principles only were proclaimed, but when words had to&nbsp;be followed by deeds the municipal feeling awoke and&nbsp;distrust began to prevail. Nevertheless, on the 1st&nbsp;August Rienzi assumed the spurs of knighthood and passed&nbsp;a decree declaring that Rome would now resume her old&nbsp;jurisdiction over the world, invoking the Holy Spirit upon&nbsp;Italy, granting the Roman citizenship to all her cities, and&nbsp;proclaiming them free in virtue of the freedom of Rome.&nbsp;This was a strange jumble of the ancient Roman idea&nbsp;combined with the mediæval. It was a dream of Rienzi’s&nbsp;brain, but it was also the dream of Dante and Petrarch.&nbsp;The conception of the empire and the history of Italy,&nbsp;particularly that of ancient and mediæval Rome, were&nbsp;inevitably preparing the way for the national idea. This&nbsp;Rienzi foresaw, and this constitutes the true grandeur of&nbsp;his character, which in other respects was not exempt&nbsp;from pettiness and infirmity. He pursued his course,&nbsp;therefore, undismayed, and had indeed gone too far to&nbsp;draw back. On the 15th August he caused himself to be&nbsp;crowned tribune with great pomp, and confirmed the&nbsp;rights of Roman citizenship to all natives of Italy. But&nbsp;practical matters had also to be taken into account, and it&nbsp;was here that his weakness and lack of judgment were&nbsp;shown. The nobles remained steadily hostile, and refused&nbsp;to yield to the charm of his words. Hence conflict was&nbsp;unavoidable ; and at first Rienzi succeeded in vanquishing&nbsp;the Gaetani by means of Giovanni Colonna. He next&nbsp;endeavoured to suppress the Guelf and Ghibelline factions,&nbsp;and to restore Italy to “ holy union ” by raising her from&nbsp;her present abasement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pope, however, was weary of toleration, and, coming to terms with the nobles, incited them to war. They&nbsp;accordingly moved from Palestrina, and on the 30th&nbsp;November were encamped before Rome. Rienzi now&nbsp;put forth his energy. He had already called the militia&nbsp;to arms, and a genuine battle took place in which eighty</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
