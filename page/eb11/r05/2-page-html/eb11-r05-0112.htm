<p><span class="font0">During the interval of peace that followed he accompanied the prince of Wales to the Nile, Constantinople, the Crimea and&nbsp;Greece in 1868, and published an account of the tour in the&nbsp;following year, when he also contested the borough of Chelsea&nbsp;unsuccessfully in the Conservative interest. On the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870, Russell was with the&nbsp;crown prince from the battle of Worth, 6th of August, and&nbsp;Sedan, 12th of September, till the capitulation of Paris. His&nbsp;account appeared in 1874 under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">My Diary during&nbsp;the Last Great War.</span><span class="font0"> His description of the burning of Paris&nbsp;by the Communards was not the least of his journalistic&nbsp;triumphs. In 1875-76 he was honorary private secretary to&nbsp;the prince of Wales during his tour through India, of which&nbsp;he published an account in 1877. When Lord Wolseley was&nbsp;sent to quell the Zulu rebellion in 1879, Russell was attached&nbsp;to his staff as correspondent. In 1881 he went with the duke&nbsp;of Sutherland’s party for a tour in the United States and Canada,&nbsp;described in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hesperothen,</span><span class="font0"> and in 1882 he was again with Lord&nbsp;Wolseley in the Egyptian campaign. In 1895 he published a&nbsp;personal retrospect entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Great War with Russia.</span><span class="font0"> Russell&nbsp;was knighted in May 1895, and was the recipient of numerous&nbsp;war medals and various foreign orders. He married twice,&nbsp;first in 1846 Miss Burrowes, who died not long afterwards, and&nbsp;secondly in 1884 the Countess A. Malvezzi. He died on the&nbsp;nth of February 1907.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUSSELL, LORD WILLIAM </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(1639^1683),</span><span class="font0"> English politician, was the third son of the 1st duke of Bedford and was born&nbsp;on the 29th of September 1639. About 1654 he was sent to&nbsp;Cambridge with his elder brother Francis (on whose death in&nbsp;1678 he obtained the courtesy title of Lord Russell). On&nbsp;leaving the university, the two brothers travelled abroad, visiting Lyons and Geneva, and residing for some while at Augsburg.&nbsp;William’s account of his impressions is spirited and interesting.&nbsp;He was at Paris in 1658, but had returned to Woburn in December&nbsp;1659. At the Restoration he was elected for the family borough&nbsp;of Tavistock. For a long time he appears to have taken no&nbsp;part in public affairs, but rather to have indulged in the follies&nbsp;of court life and intrigue; for both in 1663 and 1664 he was&nbsp;engaged in duels, in the latter of which he was wounded. In&nbsp;1669 he married Rachel (1636-1723), second daughter of the&nbsp;4th earl of Southampton, and widow of Lord Vaughan, thus&nbsp;becoming connected with Shaftesbury, who had married Southampton’s niece. With his wife Russell always lived on terms&nbsp;of the greatest affection and confidence. She corresponded&nbsp;with Tillotson and other distinguished men, and a collection of&nbsp;her admirable letters was published in 1773.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was not until the formation of the <sup>a</sup> country party,” in opposition to the policy of the Cabal and Charles’s French-Catholic plots, that Russell began to take an active part in&nbsp;affairs. He then joined Cavendish, Birch, Hampden, Powell,&nbsp;Lyttleton and others in vehement antagonism to the court.&nbsp;With a passionate hatred and distrust of the Catholics, and an&nbsp;intense love of political liberty, he united the desire for ease&nbsp;to Protestant Dissenters. His first speech appears to have been&nbsp;on the 22nd of January 1673, in which he inveighed against&nbsp;the stop of the exchequer, the attack on the Smyrna fleet, the&nbsp;corruption of courtiers with French money, and <sup>a</sup> the ill ministers&nbsp;about the king.” He also supported the proceedings against&nbsp;the duke of Buckingham. In 1675 he moved an address to the&nbsp;king for the removal of Danby (see Leeds, Duke of) from&nbsp;the royal councils, and for his impeachment. On the 15th of&nbsp;February 1677, in the debate on the fifteen months’ prorogation,&nbsp;he moved the dissolution of parliament; and in March 1678 he&nbsp;seconded the address praying the king to declare war against&nbsp;France. The enmity of the country party against Danby and&nbsp;James, and their desire for a dissolution and the disbanding&nbsp;of the army, were greater than their enmity to Louis. The&nbsp;French king therefore found it easy to form a temporary alliance with Russell, Hollis and the opposition leaders, by which&nbsp;they engaged to cripple the king’s power of hurting France and&nbsp;to compel him to seek Louis’s friendship,—that friendship, however, to be given only on the condition that they in their turn&nbsp;should have Louis’s support for their cherished objects. Russell&nbsp;in particular entered into close communication with the marquis&nbsp;de Ruvigny (Lady Russell’s maternal uncle), who came over with&nbsp;money for distribution among members of parliament. By the&nbsp;testimony of Barillon, however, it is clear that Russell himself&nbsp;utterly refused to take any part in the intended corruption.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the wild alarms which culminated in the Popish Terror Russell appears to have been affected more completely than his&nbsp;otherwise sober character would have led people to expect. He&nbsp;threw himself into the party which looked to Monmouth as the&nbsp;representative of Protestant interests, a grave political blunder,&nbsp;though he afterwards was in confidential communication with&nbsp;Orange. On the 4th of November 1678 he moved an address&nbsp;to the king to remove the duke of York from his person and&nbsp;councils. At the dissolution of the pensionary parliament, he&nbsp;was, in the new elections, returned for Bedfordshire. Danby&nbsp;was at once overthrown, and in April 1679 Russell was one of the&nbsp;new privy cpuncil formed by Charles on the advice of Temple.&nbsp;Only six days after this we find him moving for a committee&nbsp;to draw up a bill to secure religion and property in case of a&nbsp;popish successor. He does not, however, appear to have taken&nbsp;part in the exclusion debates at this time. In June, on the&nbsp;occasion of the Covenanters’ rising in Scotland, he attacked&nbsp;Lauderdale personally in full council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In January 1680 Russell, along with Cavendish. Capell, Powell, Essex and Lyttleton, tendered his resignation to the&nbsp;king, which was received hy Charles “ with all my heart.”&nbsp;On the 16th of June he accompanied Shaftesbury, when the&nbsp;latter indicted James at Westminster as a popish recusant;&nbsp;and on the 26th of October he took the extreme step of moving&nbsp;“how to suppress popery and prevent a popish successor”;&nbsp;while on the 2nd of November, now at the height of his influence,&nbsp;he went still further by seconding the motion for exclusion in its&nbsp;most emphatic shape, and on the 19th carried the bill to the&nbsp;House of Lords for their concurrence. The limitation scheme he&nbsp;opposed, on the ground that monarchy under the conditions&nbsp;expressed in it would be an absurdity. The statement, made&nbsp;by Echard alone </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Hist, of England,</span><span class="font0"> ii.), that he joined in opposing&nbsp;the indulgence shown to Lord Strafford hy Charles in dispensing&nbsp;with the more horrible parts of the sentence of death—an&nbsp;indulgence afterwards shown to Russell himself—is entirely&nbsp;unworthy of credence. On December 18 he moved to refuse&nbsp;supplies until the king passed the Exclusion Bill. The prince&nbsp;of Orange having come over at this time, there was a tendency&nbsp;on the part of the opposition leaders to accept his endeavours to&nbsp;secure a compromise on the exclusion question. Russell, however, refused to give way a hair’s-breadth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 26th of March 1681, in the parliament held at Oxford, Russell again seconded the Exclusion Bill. Upon the dissolution he retired into privacy at his country seat of Stratton in&nbsp;Hampshire. It was, however, no doubt at his wish that his&nbsp;chaplain -wrote the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Julian the Apostate,</span><span class="font0"> in reply to Dr&nbsp;Hickes’s sermons, in which the lawfulness of resistance in extreme&nbsp;cases was defended. In the wild schemes of Shaftesbury after&nbsp;the election of Tory sheriffs for London in 1682 he had no share;&nbsp;upon the violation of the charters, however, in 1683, he began&nbsp;Seriously to consider as to the best means of resisting the government, and on one occasion attended a meeting at which treason,&nbsp;or what might be construed as treason, was talked. Monmouth,&nbsp;Essex, Hampden, Sidney and Howard of Escrick were the&nbsp;principal of those who met to consult. On the breaking out of&nbsp;the Rye House Plot, of which neither he, Essex, nor Sidney had&nbsp;the slightest knowledge, he was accused by informers of promising his assistance to raise an insurrection and compass the&nbsp;death of the king. Refusing to attempt to escape, he was&nbsp;brought before the council, when his attendance at the meeting&nbsp;referred to was charged against him. He was sent on the&nbsp;26th of June 1683 to the Tower, and, looking upon himself as&nbsp;a dying man, betook himself wholly to preparation for death.&nbsp;Monmouth offered to appear to take his trial, if thereby he&nbsp;could help Russell, and Essex refused to abscond for fear of&nbsp;injuring his friend’s chance of escape.
