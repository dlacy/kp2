<p><span class="font1">to pursue, the storm broke. Kuropatkin had drawn together seven divisions on the left rear of the XVII. Corps, the strength of&nbsp;the whole being about 90,000. On the extreme left was Orlov’s&nbsp;brigade of all arms at Yen tai Mines, then came the I. Siberian&nbsp;Corps (Stakelberg), then the X. Corps, then the XVII. But&nbsp;Orlov, perplexed by conflicting instructions and caught in&nbsp;an unfavourable situation by a brigade of the 12th division&nbsp;which was executing the proposed “ pursuit/* gave way—part&nbsp;of his force in actual rout—and the cavalry that was with him&nbsp;was driven back by the Kobi (reserve army) brigade of the&nbsp;Guard. The fugitives of Orlov’s command disordered the&nbsp;on-coming corps of Stakelberg, and the outer flank of the great&nbsp;counterstroke that was to have rolled up Kuroki’s thin line&nbsp;came to an entire standstill. Meantime the X. Corps furiously&nbsp;attacked Okasaki on the Manjuyama, and though its first assault&nbsp;drove In a portion of Okasaki’s line, a second and a third, made&nbsp;in the night, failed to shake the constancy of the 15th brigade.&nbsp;Misunderstandings and movements at cross-purposes multiplied&nbsp;on the Russian side, and at midnight Kuropatkin at last obtained&nbsp;information of events on the side of Yentai Mines. This was&nbsp;*to the effect that Orlov was routed, Stakelberg’s command much&nbsp;shaken, and at the same time Zarubayev in Liao-Yang, upon&nbsp;whom Oku and Nozu had pressed a last furious attack, reported&nbsp;that he had only a handful of troops still in reserve. Then&nbsp;Kuropatkin’s resolution collapsed, although about three divisions&nbsp;were still intact, and he gave the order to retreat on Mukden.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus the Japanese had won their great victory with inferior forces, thanks “ in the first instance to the defeat of General&nbsp;Orlov. But at least as large a share in the ruin of the Russian&nbsp;operations must be attributed to the steadfast gallantry of the&nbsp;15th brigade on Manjuyama.” The losses of tbe Japanese&nbsp;totalled 23,000, those of the Russians 19,000. Coming,&nbsp;as it did, at a moment when the first attacks on Port&nbsp;Arthur had been repulsed with heavy losses, this&nbsp;brilliantly successful climax of the four months* campaign more than restored tbe balance. But it was not the&nbsp;expected Sedan. Had the two divisions still kept in Japan&nbsp;been present Kuroki would have had the balance of force on his&nbsp;side, the Russian retreat would have been confused, if not&nbsp;actually a rout, and the war would have been ended on Japan’s&nbsp;own terms. As it was, after another day’s fighting, Kuropatkin&nbsp;drew off the whole of his forces in safety, sharply repulsing an&nbsp;attempt at pursuit made by part of the 12th division on the&nbsp;4th of September. The railway still delivered 30,000 men a&nbsp;month at Mukden, and Japan had for a time outrun her resources. At St Petersburg the talk was not of peace but of&nbsp;victory, and after a period of reorganization the Russians&nbsp;advanced afresh to a new trial of strength. But the remainder&nbsp;of the Manchurian campaign, like the second half of the war of&nbsp;1859, was nothing more than a series of violent and resultless&nbsp;encounters of huge armies—armies far larger than those which&nbsp;had fought out the real struggle for supremacy at Liao-Yang and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Magenta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At this time the siege of Port Arthur had only progressed so far that the besiegers were able to realize the difficulties before them.&nbsp;Nogi landed on the 1st of June, and his army (1st and 1 ith divisions)&nbsp;gradually separated itself from Oku’s and got into position for&nbsp;the advance on Port Arthur. Dalny, the commercial harbour, was&nbsp;seized without fighting, and a month was spent in preparing a base&nbsp;there. But so far from retiring within his fort-line Stessel&nbsp;took up a strong position outside. Dislodged from this on&nbsp;the 26th of June, the Russians checked Nogi’s further&nbsp;advance on July 3-4 by a fierce, though unsuccessful,&nbsp;counterstroke. Having been reinforced by the 9th division&nbsp;and two extra brigades of. infantry, Nogi advanced again on the&nbsp;26th. The Russians, having had. a month wherein to intrench&nbsp;themselves, held out all along the line; but after two days and one&nbsp;night of fighting amongst rocks and on precipitous hill-sides, the&nbsp;Japanese broke through on the night of July 27-28. Stessel then&nbsp;withdrew in good order into.Port Arthur, which in the two months&nbsp;he had gained by his fighting manœuvre had been considerably</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">strengthened. Nogi had already lost 8000 men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The defences of Port Arthur, as designed by the Russians in 1900, and owing to the meagre allotment of funds only partially carried&nbsp;out before the war, had some tincture, but no more, of modern&nbsp;continental ideas. There was a continuous enceinte of plain trace&nbsp;round the Old Town, at a distance of 1000 to 2000 yds. from it,&nbsp;which had not and could not have had any influence on the issue&nbsp;of the siege. The main line of defence followed the outer edge of&nbsp;the amphitheatre of hills surrounding the harbour.. These hills&nbsp;had their greatest development on the N.E. side, their outer crests&nbsp;being some 4000 yds. from the Old Town. West of the Lun&nbsp;river the defensive line offered by the hills is less defined, and&nbsp;the line adopted for the permanent works was on the north only&nbsp;3000 yds. from the harbour and 2000 yds. from the New Town.&nbsp;Running S.W. and S. back to the coast, it gradually draws in quite&nbsp;close to the S.W. end of the harbour. The total length of this line&nbsp;from sea to sea is some 12 m. Its most obvious weakness is&nbsp;that 5000 yds. N.W. of the harbour and New Town the now famous&nbsp;“ 203-Metre Hill ” overlooks both. Here it had been intended to&nbsp;construct permanent works, but considerations of expenditure had&nbsp;caused this to be deferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On this main line of defence some seven, or eight permanent works had been disposed (it is.difficult to define with accuracy, as some of the&nbsp;concreted works were little better than semi-permanent in character).&nbsp;Some of these had been prepared with interior parapets and platforms of concrete for medium guns. Fort Erh-Lung was of this&nbsp;character. The general design appears to have been grounded on&nbsp;the French detached forts of the ’seventies (see Fortification),&nbsp;as the front parapet was designed for infantry and the interior,&nbsp;10 ft. higher, for guns. The ditch, 30 ft. deep, excavated in the rock,&nbsp;was flanked by counterscarp galleries. The living casemates w-ere&nbsp;under the gorge parapet. A grave defect in the design was that&nbsp;there was no covered communication between these casemates&nbsp;and the parapets. Fort Chi-Kuan had no artillery parapet. The&nbsp;ditch, 12 to 15 ft. deep, was defended by counterscarp&nbsp;galleries. The casemates in the gorge, partially cut&nbsp;off from the terreplein by a couple of deep sunk yards&nbsp;or areas, could be defended in the fast resort as a keep. In&nbsp;addition to this the terreplein was retrenched. In both of these forts&nbsp;there was an apparently meaningless projection at. the gorge. It&nbsp;is possible that these were embryonic “ batteries traditores ” to flank&nbsp;the intervals. Fort Sung-Shu was of the same type as Chi-Kuan.&nbsp;These three were the only permanent forts seriously attacked.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The permanent works were supplemented before the siege began by a prodigious development of semi-permanent works and trenches.&nbsp;Every knoll had its redoubt or battery, and the trenches were&nbsp;arranged line behind line, to give supporting, cross and enfilade&nbsp;fire in every direction. Thus on the north front, from Chi-Kuan&nbsp;battery to Sung-Shu, a distance of about two miles, there were three&nbsp;permanent forts and seven semi-permanent works and batteries.&nbsp;Behind these was the &quot; Chinese Wall,” and behind that more&nbsp;batteries and trenches. On the north-west front, 203-Metre Hill, in&nbsp;advance of the main line, was occupied by strong semi-permanent&nbsp;works, with trenches and redoubts to either flank; and 174-Metre&nbsp;Hill, 1500 yds. beyond it, was also held. The Lun-Ho valley&nbsp;where it cut through the line was closed by entanglements and&nbsp;fougasses, and swept by batteries on each side. In front of the&nbsp;centre, the Waterworks Redoubt, a semi-permanent work covering&nbsp;the Port Arthur water supply, and connected by trenches with the&nbsp;four Temple Redoubts a mile away to the west, formed a strong&nbsp;advanced position. Wire entanglements were disposed in repeated&nbsp;lines in front of the defences, but they were not of. a strong type.&nbsp;The Russians, with the resources of the fleet at their disposal (just&nbsp;as at Sevastopol), used great numbers of machine guns and electric&nbsp;lights, and the available garrison at first was probably, including&nbsp;sailors, 47,000 men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such were the defences that the Japanese attacked, with a force at the outset (30th of July) little more than superior numerically to the&nbsp;defenders, and an entirely inadequate siege train (18 6-in. howitzers,&nbsp;60 4’7-in. guns and howitzers, and about 200 field and mountain guns).&nbsp;They were imperfectly informed of the strength of the garrison&nbsp;and the nature of the defences. Recollections of their easy.triumph&nbsp;in 1894 and perhaps thoughts of Sevastopol, German theories of the&nbsp;“ brusque attack,” the fiery ardour of the army, and above all the&nbsp;need of rapidly crushing or expelling the squadron in harbour,&nbsp;combined to suggest a bombardment and general. assault. The&nbsp;bombardment began on the 19th of August and continued for three&nbsp;days, while the infantry was spreading along the front and gaining&nbsp;ground where it could. The real assault was made on the night of&nbsp;the 21 st on the two Pan-Lung forts (semi-permanent) on the centre&nbsp;of the north-eastern front. The fighting was of the utmost severity,&nbsp;and continued through the 22nd; and although the stormers captured&nbsp;the two forts they were absolutely unable to make any further progress under the fire of the permanent forts Erh-Lung and Chi-Kuan&nbsp;on either side of, and the Wan-tai fort behind, Pan-Lung. Every&nbsp;attempt to bring up supports to the captured positions failed, and&nbsp;the Russians concentrated on the spot from ail quarters. On the&nbsp;night of the 23rd-24th, just as the assault was being renewed, Stessel&nbsp;delivered a fierce counter-attack against the lost positions, and the&nbsp;result of an all-night battle was that though the forts were not&nbsp;recaptured, the assault was repulsed with over 5000 casualties, and&nbsp;the.Japanese in Pan-Lung were isolated. This sortie raised the&nbsp;spirits of the Russians to the highest pitch. They seemed indeed&nbsp;to have broken the spell of defeat. On the Japanese side 15,000</span></p>
