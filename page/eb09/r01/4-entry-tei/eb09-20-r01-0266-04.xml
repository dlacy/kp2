                <p><label>RÁMPUR</label>, capital of the above state, stands on the left bank of the
                    Kosila in 28° 48' N. lat. and 79° 4' E. long.; it is surrounded by a belt of
                    bamboo trees and brushwood, with a low ruined parapet, and is the residence of the nawab, who
                    represents the Rohilla chieftains of Rohilkhand. A lofty mosque stands in the
                    marketplace ; the streets are densely crowded together and principally built of
                    mud. The population of the town in 1881 numbered 74,250 (males 36,355, females
                    37,895); it is famous for fine shawls and damask, which are exported to all
                    parts of India.</p>
