He had no other paſſion but a very great love for learning. He uſed to ſay, that he would rather renounce his crown than his ſtudy. His court ſoon became the ſanctuary of the ſciences, which he encouraged equally by his example and his bounty. This prince was verſed in theology, juriſprudence, philoſo-phy, mathematics, and medicine. Bocace ſays, “ that ſince the days of Solomon we have not ſeen ſo wiſe a prince upon the throne.” For a great part of his life he had no taſte for poetry; he even deſpiſed it, as, in his opinion, unworthy of a man of learning. A con-verſation which he had with Petrarch, however, undeceived him ; he retained this poet at his court, and attempted himſelf to write ſome poems, which are ſtill extant. He was forced to engage a little in war, for which he poſſeſſed no great talents : alluding to which, may be ſeen on his tomb a wolf and a lamb drinking ôut of the ſame veſſd. Philip of Valois refrained from giving battle in 1339, by the repeated advice which this prince gave him, who was a great friend to France, both from inclination and intereſt. He deteſted quarrels among Chriſtian princes, and had ſtudied the ſci-ence of aſtrology, not ſo much to know the courſe of the ſtars, as to learn by this chimerical ſcience the hidden things of futurity. He believed that he read in the grand book of heaven a very great misfortune which would befal France if Philip hazarded a battle againſt the Engliſh.</p><p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert the Firfl,</hi></hi>  called the Magnificent, duke of</p><p>Normandy, ſecond ſon of Richard II. ſucceeded in 1 208 his brother Richard III. whom it is reported he poiſoned. He had early in his reign to ſuppreſs frequent rebellions of ſeveral of the great vaſſals. He re-eſtabliſhed in his eſtates Baudouin IV. count of Flanders, who had been unjuſtly ſtript of his poſſeſſions by his own ſon. He forced Canute king of Denmark, who was alſo king of England, to divide his poſſeſſions with his couſins Alfred and Edward. In the year 1035, he undertook barefooted a journey to the Holy Land ; on his return from which he died, being' poiſoned at Nice inBithynia, leaving as his ſucceſſor William his natural ſon, afterwards king of England, whom he had cauſed before his departure to be publicly acknowledged in an aſſembly of the ſtates of Normandy.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Rupert,</hi>ſurnamed the Short and the</p><p>Mild, elector Palatine, ſon of Robert the Niggardly, was born in 1352, and elected emperor of Germany in 14co, after the depoſition of the cruel Wenceſlas. In order to gain the affection of the Germans, he wiſhed to reſtore Milanès to the empire, which Wenceſlas had taken from it ; but his attempts in this reſpect were unſucceſsful. His attachment to the anti-pope Gre-gory XII. entirely alienated the affections of the German princes. To ſuch a degree were they incenſed againſt him, that they entered into a conſpiracy to cut him off; but his death, which happened on the 18th of May 1410, being then 58 years old, put a ſtop to their machinations. Robert began to ſettle the ſovereignty of the German princes. The emperors had formerly retained in their own hands the power of life and death, within the territories of a great many of the nobles ; but he yielded them this right by his letters patent.— The chief fault imputed to this prince was an exceſs of</p><lb/><p>lenity. But, if we conſider the plots which he had to detect, the conſpiracies which he had to fruſtrate, the ſecret and powerful enemies he had to deal with ; if we inquire alſo into the commotions which the wicked ad-miniſtration of Wenceſlas had excited, the irruptions and devaſtations of plunderers and highway robbers, which the nobles countenanced, and the diſtreſſed ſituation in which he found Germany, we muſt without heſitation conclude, that his lenity indicated his prudence, in reſtoring by (low degrees the empire to its original tranquillity. Robert had his virtues, he loved his ſubjects, and governed them with wiſdom. Poſſeſſed of much political knowledge for the age in which he lived, he wanted nothing but talents for war to make him an accompliſhed prince. He was twice married. The name and rank of his firſt wiſe is unknown ; he had by her a fon, who died before him. His ſecond wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Frederic burgrave of Nuremberg, by whom he had five ſons and three daughters. The three daughters were, Margaret married to Charles duke of Lorrain ; Agnes to Adolphus duke of Cleves ; Elizabeth to Frederic duke of Auſtria. His ſons were, Louis the firſt of the electoral branch, which became extinct in 1559; John father of Chriſtopher king of Denmark ; Frederic who died without iſſue ; Otho count of Sintſheim ; laſtly, Stephen, from whom deſeended the elector, and the other counts palatine of the Rhine, who are extant at this day.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi>  (of Bavaria), prince palatine of the Rhine, and duke of Cumberland, the ſon of Frederic, elector palatine, by Elizabeth, daughter of James I. king of England, diſtinguiſhed himſelf by his valour as a general and admiral; firſt in the Dutch, and. then in the Engliſh ſervice. He was unſucceſsful in the cauſe of his uncle Charles I. againſt the parliament forces; but under Charles II. he defeated the Dutch fleet, and was made lord high admiral of England in 1673.
