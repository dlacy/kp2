At the requeſt of Mr Spottiſwoode librarian, for L. 5 Sterling he contributed his aid to the publication of Sir Robert Spottiſwoode’a Practiques of the Laws of Scotland.</p><p>In 1707 he commenced auctioneer, an employment not very ſuitatle to the dignified character of a man of letters : but to this occupation he was probably impelled by neceſſity ; for upon balancing his accounts at the end of the preceding year, the whole ſurplus was L. 28, 2s. with proſpects of L. 236 : 7 : 6 Scots. Ruddiman had a family ; and ſeems to have been a ſtranger to that fooliſh pride which has ſeduced ſome literary men into the opinion, that it is more honourable to ſtarve than have recourſe to an occupation which men of rank and opulence are accuſtomed to deſpiſe. The fame year he publiſhed an edition of <hi rend="italic">Voluſeni de  Animi Tranquillitate Dialogue,</hi>  to which he prefixed the life of Voluſenus. Voluſenus or Wilſon was a learned Scotſman, and had the honour to be patroniſed by Cardinal Wolſey (ſee Wilson). In 1709 he publiſhed  <hi rend="italic">Johnſtoni Cantici Solomonis Paraphraſis Poetica,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Johnſtoni Cantica</hi>  with, notes, which he dedicated in verſe to his friend and patron Dr Pitcairne. The edition conſiſted of 200 copies. The expence of printing  amounted to L. 5, 10s. Sterling, and he ſold them at a ſhilling each copy.</p><p>The philological talents of Ruddiman were next directed to a more important object, in which they became more conſpicuous and uſeful. Freebairne the bookſeller propoſed to publiſh anew edition of the Scot-tiſh tranſlation of Virgil’s Æneid by Gawin Douglas biſhop of Dunkeld. Of the contributions which ſome eminent characters of the age preſented, the moſt valuable were ſupplied by Ruddiman. Freebairne acknowledged in general terms this obligation, but has not done him the juſtice to inform the reader what theſe valuable contributions were, and Ruddiman’s modeſty reſtrained him from publicly aſſerting his claim. From the pocket-book which has been already mentioned, it appears that Ruddiman corrected the work and wrote the gloſſary ; and there is ſtrong reaſon to believe that he was the author of the 42 general rules for aſſiſting the reader to underſtand the language of Douglas. To thoſe who wiſh to be acquainted with the ancient language of this iſland, the gloſſary will be a treaſure, as it forms a compendious dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon. For this elaborate work Ruddiman was allowed L 8 : 6 : 8 Sterling.</p><p>The reputation of Ruddiman had now extended to a diſtance. He was invited by the magiſtrates of Dundee to be rector of the grammar-ſchool of that town ; but the faculty of advocates, anxious to retain him, augmented his ſalary to. L. 30 : 6 : 8 Sterling, and he declined the offer.</p><p>In 1711 he aſſiſtcd Biſhop Sage in publiſhing Drummond of Hawthornden’s works ; and performed the fame favour to Dr Abercrombie, who was then preparing for the preſs his Martial Atchievements.</p><p>In 1713 he was deprived of his friend Dr Pitcairne. On this occaſion he teſtified all the reſpect which friend-ſhip could inſpire to the memory of his deceaſed patron and ſurviving family. He compoſed Pitcairne’s epitaph, and conducted the ſale of his library, which was dilpoſed of to Peter the Great.</p><p>In 1714 the Rudiments of the Latin tongue were publiſhed. Eighteen or nineteen Latin grammars, compoſed by Scotchmen, had appeared before This period ; yet ſuch is the intrinſic value of this little treatiſe, that it ſoon ſuperſeded all other books on the ſubject, and is now taught in all the grammar-ſchools in Scotland. It has alſo been tranſlated into other languages.</p><p>He was next called upon to publiſh the works of Buchanan. The value of theſe he enhanced much by an elaborate preface, his <hi rend="italic">Tabula Regum Scotia Chronologica,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Propriorum Nominum Interpretalio.</hi>  The interpretation of proper names was highly requiſite ; for Buchanan has ſo diſguiſed them in the Roman dreſs, that the original name is ſcarcely diſcernible ; and the preface puts the reader on his guard againſt the chronological errors and factious ſpirit of the hiſtory. Ruddiman alſo added a learned diſſertation, intitled <hi rend="italic">De Metris Buchananais Libellas,</hi>  and ſubjoined annotations critical and political on the Hiſtory of Scotland. As he eſpouſed the caufe of Queen Mary, he raiſed againſt himſelf an hoſt of enemies, and gave occaſion to that celebrated controverſy which has been carried on with much keenneſs and animoſity, and with little intermiſſion, even to the preſent times. For this work Ruddiman was promiſed L. 40 Sterling.</p><p>He had now been ſo long accuſtomed to ſuperintend the preſs, that he was led to form the plan of erecting a printing-office himſelf @@(a). Accordingly, in the year 1715, he commenced printer in partnerſhip with his brother Walter, who had been regularly bred to the bufineſs. Some years after he was appointed printer to the univerſity, along with James Davidſon book-ſeller.</p><p>The firſt literary ſociety formed in Scotland was inſtituted in the year 1718. It probably derived its origin from the factious and turbulent ſpirit of the times. The learned, anxious perhaps to find ſome reſpite from the political diſſenfions of the day,. endeavoured to procure it in elegant amuſement; for one of the fundamental articles of the new aſſociation was, that the “ affaire of church and ſtate ſhould not be introduced.” Ruddiman and the maſters of the high-ſchool had the honour to found this ſociety. They were afterwards joined by Lord Kaimes.</p><p>In 1725 the firſt part of his <hi rend="italic">Grammatica Latina Inſtitutiones,</hi>  which treated of etymology, was publiſhed. The ſecond part, which explained the nature and principles of ſyntax, appeared in 1731. He alſo wrote a third part on proſody, which is laid to be more copious and correct than any other publication on the ſubject. When urged to give it to the public, he ſaid dryly, “ The age has ſo little taſte, the ſale would not pay the expence.” Of this work, he publiſhed an abridge-</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a) It has long been an object of curio</hi>ſity to aſcertain the time at which the art of printing was introduced into Scotland. Mr Robertſon, the keeper of the records, has lately diſcovered a patent of King James IV. which renders it certain that a printing-preſs was firſt eſtabliſhed at Edinburgh during the year 1507, 30 years after Caxton had brought it into England.
