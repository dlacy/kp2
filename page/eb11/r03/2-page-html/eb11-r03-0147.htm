<p><span class="font1">ROCAMADOUR, a village of south-western France, in the department of Lot, 36 m. N.N.E. of Cahors by road. Pop.&nbsp;(1906) 296. Rocamadour, a famous place of pilgrimage, is&nbsp;most strikingly situated. Its buildings rise in stages up the side&nbsp;of a cliff on the right bank of the Alzou, which here runs between&nbsp;rocky walls 400 ft. in height. Flights of steps ascend from the&nbsp;lower town to the churches—a group of massive buildings&nbsp;half-way up the cliff. The chief of them is the church of Notre-Dame (1479) j containing the wooden figure of the Madonna&nbsp;reputed to have been carved by St Amadouf. The church&nbsp;opens on to a terrace called the Plateau of St Michel, where there&nbsp;is a broken sword said to be a fragment of “ Durandal,” once&nbsp;wielded by the hero Roland. The interior walls of the church&nbsp;of St Sauveur are covered with paintings and inscriptions&nbsp;recalling the pilgrimages of celebrated persons. The subterranean church of St Amadour (1166) extends beneath&nbsp;St Sauveur and contains relics of the saint. On the summit&nbsp;of the cEff stands the chateau built in the middle ages to&nbsp;defend the sanctuaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rocamadour owes its origin to St Amadour or Amateur, who, according to tradition, chose the place as a hermitage for his&nbsp;devotions to the Virgin Mary. The saint is identified with&nbsp;Zacchaeus the publican and disciple of Jesus, who is said to&nbsp;have journeyed to Gaul to preach the gospel. The renown&nbsp;of Rocamadour as a place of pilgrimage dates from the early&nbsp;middle ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROCAMBOLE, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Allium Scorodoprasum,</span><span class="font1"> a hardy bulbous perennial occurring in a wild state in sandy pastures and waste&nbsp;places throughout Europe, but not common in the south; in&nbsp;Britain it is rare, and found in the north of England and the&nbsp;south of Scotland. Its cultivation does not appear to be of&nbsp;ancient date; it is not mentioned by Greek and Roman authors,&nbsp;and there are only a small number of original common names&nbsp;among ancient pcoples (A. de Candolle, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Origin of Cultivated&nbsp;Plants,</span><span class="font1"> p. 72). The plant is grown for its bulbs, which are&nbsp;smaller and milder than those of garlic, and consist of several&nbsp;cloves chiefly produced at the roots. The cloves arc planted&nbsp;about the end of February or in March, and treated like garlic&nbsp;or. shallot. When mature, the bulbs are taken up, dried and&nbsp;stored for use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROCH, ST (Lat. Rochus; Ital. Rocco; Span. Roque; Fr. Roch) (d. 1327), a confessor whose death is commemorated&nbsp;on the 16th of August; he is specially invoked against the&nbsp;plague. According to his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Acta,</span><span class="font1"> he was born at Montpellier,&nbsp;France, about 1295. He early began to manifest strict asceticism and great] devoutness, and on the death of his parents in&nbsp;his twentieth year he gave all his substance to the poor. Coming&nbsp;to Italy during an epidemic of plague, he was very diligent in&nbsp;tending the sick in the public hospitals at Aquapendente,&nbsp;Cesena and Rome, and effected many miraculous cures by&nbsp;prayer and simple contact. After similar ministries at Tiacenza&nbsp;he himself fell ill. He was expelled from the town, and withdrew into the forest, where he would have perished had not&nbsp;a dog belonging to a nobleman named Gothardus supplied him&nbsp;with bread. On his return to Montpellier he was arrested as&nbsp;a spy and thrown into prison, where he died on the 16th of&nbsp;August 1327, having previously obtained from God this favour&nbsp;—that all plague-stricken persons invoking him should be&nbsp;healed. His cult spread through Spain, France, Germany,&nbsp;Belgium and Italy. A magnificent temple was raised to him&nbsp;at Venice, where his body is believed to lie, and numerous&nbsp;brotherhoods have been instituted in his honour. He is usually&nbsp;represented in the garb of a pilgrim, with a wound in his thigh,&nbsp;and with a dog near him carrying a loaf in its mouth.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROCHAMBEAU, JEAN BAPTISTE DONATIEN DE VIMEUR, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Comte de</span><span class="font1"> (1725-1807), French soldier, was born at Vendôme&nbsp;(Loir-et-Cher) on the ist of July 1725. He was originally&nbsp;destined for the church and was brought up at the Jesuit&nbsp;college at Blois, but after the death of his elder brother he&nbsp;entered a cavalry regiment, served in Bohemia and Bavaria&nbsp;and on the Rhine, and in 1747 had attained the rank of colonel&nbsp;He took part in the siege of Maestricht in 1748, became governor&nbsp;of Vendôme in 1749, and after distinguishing himself in 1756&nbsp;in the Minorca expedition was promoted brigadier of infantry.&nbsp;In 1757 and 1758 he fought in Germany, notably at Crefeld,&nbsp;received several wounds in the battle of Clostercamp (1760),&nbsp;was appointed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">maréchal de camp</span><span class="font1"> in 1761 and inspector of&nbsp;cavalry and was frequently consulted by the ministers on&nbsp;technical points. In 1780 he was sent, with the rank of lieutenant-general, in command of 6000 French troops to help&nbsp;the American colonists under Washington against the English.&nbsp;He landed at Newport, Rhode Island, on the 10th of July,&nbsp;but was held here inactive for a year, owing to his reluctance&nbsp;to abandon the French fleet, which was blockaded by the&nbsp;British in Narragansett Bay. At last, in July 1781, Rocham-beau’s force was able to leave Rhode Island and, marching&nbsp;across ConnecticutJoined Washington on the Hudson. Then&nbsp;followed the celebrated march of the combined forces to Yorktown, where on the 22nd of September they formed a junction&nbsp;with the troops of Lafayette; as the result Cornwallis was&nbsp;forced to surrender on the 19th of October. Throughout,&nbsp;Rochambeau had displayed an admirable spirit, placing himself&nbsp;entirely under Washington’s command and handling his troops&nbsp;as part of the American army. In recognition of his services,&nbsp;Congress voted him and his troops the thanks of the nation and&nbsp;presented him with two cannon taken from the English. These&nbsp;guns, which Rochambeau took back to Vendôme, were requisitioned in 1792. On his return to France he was loaded&nbsp;with favours by Louis XVI. and was made governor of Picardy.&nbsp;During the Revolution he commanded the Army of the North&nbsp;in 1790, but resigned in 1792. He was arrested during the&nbsp;Terror, and narrowly escaped the guillotine. He was subsequently pensioned by Bonaparte, and died at Thore (Loir-et-Cher) on the 10th of May 1807.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A statue of Rochambeau by Ferdinand Hamar, the gift of France to the United States, was unveiled in Lafayette Square,&nbsp;Washington, by President Roosevelt on the 24th of May 1902.&nbsp;The ceremony was made the occasion of a great demonstration&nbsp;of friendship between the two nations. France was represented&nbsp;by her ambassador, M. Cambon, Admiral Fournier and General&nbsp;Brugère, a detachment of sailors and marines from the warship&nbsp;“ Gaulois ” being present. Representatives of the Lafayette&nbsp;and Rochambeau families also attended. Of the many speeches&nbsp;perhaps the most striking was that of Senator Henry C. Lodge,&nbsp;who, curiously enough in the circumstances, prefaced his&nbsp;eloquent appreciation of the services rendered to the American&nbsp;cause by France by a brilliant sketch of the way in which&nbsp;the French had been driven out of North America by England&nbsp;and her colonists combined. General Brugère, in his speech,&nbsp;quoted Rochambeau’s words, uttered in 1781: “ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Entre vous.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
