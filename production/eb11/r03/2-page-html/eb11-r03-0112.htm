Dante was perhaps&nbsp;too severe on Robert, whom he described as a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">re da sermone&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(word king), and contemporary critics accused him of covetousness, a fault partly excused by his pressing need of money to&nbsp;pay the expenses of his perpetual wars. In spite of his power&nbsp;and influence, his position as a leader of the Guelphs was greatly&nbsp;shaken during the latter years of his reign, while at home he&nbsp;was never able completely to subjugate his rebellious barons.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROBERT, the name of two dukes of Normandy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robekt</span><span class="font1"> I. (d. 1035), called Robert the Devil, was the younger son of Richard II., duke of Normandy (d. 1026), who bequeathed&nbsp;to him the county of Exmes. In 1028 he succeeded his brother,&nbsp;Richard III., whom he was accused of poisoning, as duke of&nbsp;Normandy. His time was mainly spent in fighting against&nbsp;his rebellious vassals. At his court Robert sheltered the&nbsp;exiled English princes, Edward, afterwards King Edward the&nbsp;Confessor, and his brother Alfred, and fitted out a fleet for&nbsp;the purpose of restoring them to their inheritance, but this&nbsp;was scattered by a storm. When returning from a pilgrimage&nbsp;to Jerusalem, he died at Nicaea on the 22nd of July 1035. His&nbsp;successor as duke was his natural son, William the Conqueror,&nbsp;afterwards king of England. In addition to winning for him&nbsp;his surname, Robert’s strength and ferocity afforded material&nbsp;for many stories and legends, and he is the subject of several&nbsp;poems and romances (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robert the Devil</span><span class="font1"> below).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robert</span><span class="font1"> II. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.</span><span class="font1"> 1054-1134) was the eldest son of William the Conqueror. Although recognized in boyhood as his father’s&nbsp;successor in Normandy, he was soon dissatisfied with his&nbsp;position, and about 1078, following a quarrel between his&nbsp;brothers and himself, he revolted. He was obliged to fly&nbsp;from his own country, but after a period of exile he returned,&nbsp;raised some troops, and began to harry the duchy, wounding&nbsp;his father during a skirmish at Gerberoi early in 1079. He&nbsp;was, however, quickly forgiven, and passed two or three years&nbsp;in England and in Normandy until 1083, when he entered upon&nbsp;a second term of exile. When the Conqueror died in September&nbsp;1087 Robert became duke of Normandy, but not king of England;&nbsp;although he received offers of help, he took no serious steps&nbsp;to displace his younger brother, King William II. In Normandy&nbsp;his rule was weak and irresolute. He lost the county of Maine,&nbsp;which for some years had been united with Normandy, and he&nbsp;was soon at variance with his brothers, the younger of whom,&nbsp;Henry, he seized and put into prison. In 1089 his duchy&nbsp;was invaded by William II., who soon made peace with Robert,&nbsp;the two agreeing to dispossess their brother Henry of his lands&nbsp;in Normandy. This peace lasted until 1094, when occasions&nbsp;of difference again arose and another struggle began, Robert&nbsp;being aided by King Philip I. of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This warfare ended in 1096, when Robert set out on the first crusade, having raised money for this purpose by pledging his&nbsp;duchy to William for 10,000 marks. With his followers he&nbsp;journeyed to Constantinople; then he took part in the siege&nbsp;of Nicaea, the battle of Dorylaeum, and the famous battle&nbsp;under the walls of Antioch in June 1098. He shared in the&nbsp;siege of Jerusalem and other exploits of the crusade, while one&nbsp;account says that he was offered and refused the crown of&nbsp;the new Latin kingdom. Having won a great reputation both&nbsp;for valour and for generosity, the duke left Palestine and&nbsp;arrived in Normandy in September 1100.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">William Rufus died while Robert was on his homeward way, and in Italy the Norman duke was greeted as king of England;&nbsp;but when he reached Normandy he learned that the English&nbsp;throne was already in the possession of Henry I. In July&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">hoi</span><span class="font1"> he crossed over to England, intending to contest his&nbsp;brother’s title, but Henry met him near Alton, in Hampshire,&nbsp;and an amicable arrangement was made between them. Having&nbsp;received presents and the promise of a pension, Robert went&nbsp;quietly home. But the fraternal strife was not allayed. Henry&nbsp;had interests in Normandy in addition to the county of Evreux,&nbsp;which Robert ceded to him about 1102. Visits were exchanged,&nbsp;but no lasting peace was made, and in 1106 the English king&nbsp;crossed over to Normandy, where Robert was in great extremities. At the battle of Tinchebrai, fought on the 28th of&nbsp;September 1106, Henry took his brother prisoner and carried&nbsp;him to England. For twenty-eight years the unfortunate duke&nbsp;was a captive, first in the Tower of London, and later in the&nbsp;castles of Devizes and Cardiff, but the evidence goes to show&nbsp;that he was not treated with cruelty. He died probably at&nbsp;Cardiff on the 10th of February 1134. Robert had a son,&nbsp;William, called the Clito, and several natural children. He&nbsp;was called Curthose, and also Gambaron, his figure being short&nbsp;and stout. Although wanting in decision of character, he was&nbsp;a skilled and able warrior, and the chroniclers tell many stories,&nbsp;some of them obviously legendary, of his exploits in the Holy&nbsp;Land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The chief sources for the life of Robert II. are Ordericus Vitalis, William of Malmesbury and other chroniclers of the time. See&nbsp;E. A. Freeman, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Norman Conquest</span><span class="font1"> (1870-76), and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Reign of Rufus</span><span class="font1"> (1882).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBERT GUISCARD [i.e. “the resourceful”] (c. 1015-1085), the most remarkable of the Norman adventurers who conquered southern Italy. From 1016 to 1030 the Normans&nbsp;were pure mercenaries, serving either Greeks or Lombards,&nbsp;and then Sergius of Naples, by installing the leader Rainulf&nbsp;in the fortress of Aversa in 1030, gave them their first pied-à-terre and they began an organized conquest of the land. In&nbsp;1030 there arrived William and Drogo, the two eldest sons of&nbsp;Tancred of Hauteville, a petty noble of Coutanccs in Normandy.&nbsp;The two joined in the organized attempt to wrest Apulia from&nbsp;the Greeks, who by 1040 had lost most of that province. In&nbsp;1042 Melfi was chosen as the Norman capital, and in September&nbsp;of that year the Normans elected as their count William “Iron&nbsp;Arm,” who was succeeded in turn by his brothers Drogo,&nbsp;“ comes Normannorum totius Apuliae et Calabriae,” and&nbsp;Humfrey, who arrived about 1044. In 1046 arrived Robert,&nbsp;the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville. His tall stature,&nbsp;blonde colouring and powerful voice are strikingly described&nbsp;by Anna Comnena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Guiscard soon rose to distinction. The Lombards turned against their allies and Leo IX. determined to expel the Norman&nbsp;freebooters. The army which he led towards Apulia in 1053&nbsp;was, however, overthrown at Civitate on the Fortore by the&nbsp;Normans united under Humfrey, Guiscard and Richard of&nbsp;Aversa. In 1057 Robert succeeded Humfrey as count of&nbsp;Apulia and, in company with Roger his youngest brother,&nbsp;carried on the conquest of Apulia and Calabria, while Richard&nbsp;conquered the principality of Capua. The Papacy, foreseeing&nbsp;the breach with the emperor over investitures, now resolved&nbsp;to recognize the Normans and secure them as allies. Therefore at Melfi, on the 23rd of August 1059, Nicholas II. invested&nbsp;Robert with Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, and Richard with&nbsp;Capua. Guiscard “ by Grace of God and St Peter duke of&nbsp;Apulia and Calabria and future lord of Sicily ” agreed to hold&nbsp;by annual rent of the Holy See and to maintain its cause.&nbsp;In the next twenty years he made an amazing series of conquests. Invading Sicily with Roger, the brothers captured&nbsp;Messina (io6r) and Palermo (1072). Bari was reduced (April&nbsp;1071) and the Greeks finally ousted from southern Italy.&nbsp;The territory of Salerno was already Robert’s; in December&nbsp;1076 he took the city, expelling its Lombard prince Gisulf,&nbsp;whose sister Sikelgaita he had married. The Norman attacks&nbsp;on Benevento, a papal fief, alarmed and angered Gregory VII.,&nbsp;but pressed hard by the emperor, Henry IV., he turned again&nbsp;to the Normans, and at Ceprano (June 1080) reinvested Robert,&nbsp;securing him also in the southern Abruzzi, but reserving&nbsp;Salerno. Guiscard’s last enterprise was his attack on the&nbsp;Greek Empire, a rallying ground for his rebel vassals. He</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
