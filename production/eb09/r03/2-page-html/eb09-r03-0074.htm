        <p><span class="font1">of runaway slaves, outlaws, brigands, and impoverished peasants. By
                the'end of 73 he had 70,000 men under&nbsp;his command, had twice defeated the Roman
                troops, and&nbsp;was master of southern Italy. In 72 he advanced on&nbsp;Rome, but,
                though he again routed the legions led against&nbsp;him by the consuls in person, he
                abandoned his scheme&nbsp;and established himself in the now desolate country
                near&nbsp;Thurii, already the natural home of brigandage. At&nbsp;length in 71 the
                prætor Crassus, who had been sent&nbsp;against him with no less than six legions,
                ended the war.&nbsp;Spartacus was defeated and slain in Apulia. In Rome&nbsp;itself
                the various classes and parties hostile to the&nbsp;Sullan system had, ever since
                Sulla’s death in 78, been&nbsp;incessantly agitating for the repeal of his most
                obnoxious&nbsp;laws, and needed only a leader in order successfully to&nbsp;attack a
                government discredited by failure at home and&nbsp;abroad. With the return of Pompey
                from Spain their&nbsp;opportunity came. Pompey, who understood politics
                as&nbsp;little as Marius, was anxious to obtain—what the senate&nbsp;was more than
                likely to refuse to give him, and what he&nbsp;was not legally entitled to—a
                triumph, the consulship for&nbsp;the next year (70), and as the natural consequence
                of this&nbsp;an important command in the East. The opposition&nbsp;wanted his name
                and support, and a bargain was soon&nbsp;struck. Pompey and with him AIarcus
                Crassus, the conqueror of Spartacus, were elected consuls, almost in
                the&nbsp;presence of their troops, which lay encamped outside the&nbsp;gates in
                readiness to assist at the triumph and ovation&nbsp;granted to their respective
                leaders. Pompey lost no time&nbsp;in performing his part of the agreement. The
                tribunes&nbsp;regained their prerogatives.@@<sup>1</sup> The “ perpetual
                courts”&nbsp;were taken out of the hands of the senatorial judices, who&nbsp;had
                outdone the equestrian order in scandalous corruption,@@<sup>2</sup> and finally the
                censors, the first since 86 </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font1"> purged&nbsp;the
                senate of the more worthless and disreputable of
                    Sulla’s&nbsp;partisans.@@<sup>3</sup> The victory was complete ; but for the
                future&nbsp;its chief significance lay in the clearness with which it&nbsp;showed
                that the final decision in matters political lay with&nbsp;neither of the two great
                parties in Rome, but with the&nbsp;holder of the military authority. The recognition
                of this&nbsp;fact was fatal to the dignity of politics in the city.
                In&nbsp;proportion as the mass of the Roman community in Italy,&nbsp;and able
                aspirants to power, like Cæsar, became conscious&nbsp;of the unreality of the old
                constitutional controversies,&nbsp;they became indifferent to the questions which
                agitated&nbsp;the forum and the curia and contemptuously ready to&nbsp;alter or
                disregard the constitution itself, when it stood in&nbsp;the way of interests nearer
                to their hearts. Of this growing indifference to the traditional politics of the
                republic,&nbsp;against which Cicero struggled in vain, Pompey is an&nbsp;excellent
                example. He was absolutely without interest in&nbsp;them, except in so far as they
                led up to important military&nbsp;commands, and, though he was never revolutionary
                in&nbsp;intention, his own career, in its quiet defiance of all the&nbsp;established
                rules of the constitution, did almost more than&nbsp;the direct attacks of others to
                render the republic impossible.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">AVhen his consulship ended, Pompey impatiently awaited at the hands
                of the politicians he had befriended the&nbsp;further gift of a foreign command. He
                declined an ordinary</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">province, and from the end of 70 to 67 he remained at Rome in a
                somewhat affectedly dignified seclusion.@@<sup>4</sup> But&nbsp;in 67 and 66 the
                laws of Gabiuius and Alanilius gave him&nbsp;all and more than all that he expected.
                The ravages of&nbsp;the pirates, encouraged in the first instance by the
                inactivity&nbsp;which had marked Roman policy in the East after 167,&nbsp;and by the
                absence of any effective Roman navy in the&nbsp;Alediterranean, had now risen to an
                intolerable height, and&nbsp;the spasmodic efforts made since 81 had done little
                to&nbsp;check them. The trade of the AIediterranean was paralysed, and even the
                coasts of Italy were not safe from their&nbsp;raids.@@<sup>5</sup> Aulus Gabinius, a
                tribune, and a follower of&nbsp;Pompey, now proposed to the people to entrust
                Pompey&nbsp;with the sole command against the pirates.@@<sup>6</sup> His command was
                to last for three years. He was to have supreme&nbsp;authority over all Roman
                magistrates in the provinces&nbsp;throughout the Alediterranean and over the coasts
                for 50&nbsp;miles inland. Fifteen Iegati, all of prætorian rank, were&nbsp;assigned
                to him, with two hundred ships, and as many&nbsp;troops as he thought desirable.
                These powers were still&nbsp;further enlarged in the next year by the Alanilian
                law,&nbsp;which transferred from Lucullus and Glabrio to Pompey&nbsp;the conduct of
                the Alithradatic war in Asia, and with it the&nbsp;entire control of Roman policy
                and interests in the East.@@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>The unrepublican character of the
                position thus granted to&nbsp;Pompey, and the dangers of the precedent
                established,&nbsp;were clearly enough pointed out by such moderate men as&nbsp;Q.
                Lutatius Catulus, the “ father of the senate,” and by&nbsp;the orator Hortensius—but
                in vain. Both laws were supported, not only by the tribunes and the populace,
                but&nbsp;by the whole influence of the “ ρublicani ” and “ nego-tiatores,” whose
                interests in the East were at stake.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Pompey left Rome in 67, and did not return to Italy till towards the
                end of 62. The interval was marked in&nbsp;Rome by the rise to political importance
                of Cæsar and&nbsp;Cicero, and by Catiline’s attempt at revolution. AVhen in
                7O&nbsp;the removal of the restrictions placed upon the tribunate&nbsp;restored to
                the popular party their old weapons of attack,&nbsp;Cæsar was already a marked man.
                In addition to his&nbsp;patrician birth, and his reputation for daring and
                ability,&nbsp;he possessed, as the nephew of AIarius and the son-in-law&nbsp;of
                Cinna, a strong hereditary claim to the leadership of the&nbsp;popular and AIarian
                party. He had already taken part&nbsp;in the agitation for the restoration of the
                tribunate ; he&nbsp;had supported the AIanilian law ; and, when
                Pompey’s&nbsp;withdrawal left the field clear for other competitors, he&nbsp;stepped
                at once into the front rank on the popular side.@@<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>He took upon
                himself, as their nearest representative, the&nbsp;task of clearing the memory and
                avenging the wrongs of&nbsp;the great popular leaders, AIarius, Cinna, and
                Saturninus.&nbsp;He publicly reminded the people of Alarius’s services,&nbsp;and set
                up again upon the Capitol the trophies of the&nbsp;Cimbric AVar. He endeavoured to
                bring to justice, not&nbsp;only the ringleaders in Sulla’s bloody work of
                proscription,&nbsp;but even the murderers of Saturninus, and vehemently&nbsp;pleaded
                the cause of the children of the proscribed. AVhile&nbsp;thus carrying on in genuine
                Roman fashion the feud of&nbsp;his family, he attracted ∙the sympathies of the
                Italians by&nbsp;his efforts to procure the Roman franchise for the
                Latin&nbsp;communities beyond the Po, and won the affections of&nbsp;the populace in
                Rome and its immediate neighbourhood&nbsp;by the splendour of the games which he
                gave as curule&nbsp;ædile (65), and by his lavish expenditure upon the
