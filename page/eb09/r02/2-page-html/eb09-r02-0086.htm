<p><span class="font0">Constitution,” under whose provisions it was claimed that Thomas Wilson Dorr was chosen governor. Later in the year&nbsp;1842 a convention called by the regularly constituted authorities&nbsp;adopted the present constitution, under whose provisions the State&nbsp;government was organized in 1843. The governor (chosen annually) has no veto power. The legislative body, known as the&nbsp;General Assembly, comprises a senate and a house of representatives, each one of the thirty-six cities and towns choosing a single&nbsp;senator. The General Assembly begins its annual sessions in May&nbsp;at Newport, adjourning, after a few days, for a much more extended&nbsp;session at Providence beginning in the following January. The&nbsp;judicial body consists of one supreme court, with subordinate courts&nbsp;for the respective counties, the justices being chosen by vote of the&nbsp;General Assembly. The suffrage is a limited one, a property&nbsp;qualification being required in certain instances. The State is&nbsp;represented in the national Congress by two senators and two&nbsp;representatives. In the quadrennial election of president, Rhode&nbsp;Island has four votes in the “electoral college.” In the Civil&nbsp;War of 1861-65 Rhode Island took an active part, furnishing for&nbsp;the defence of the Union 24,042 men.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. E. F.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHODES, an island in the Ægean Sea, belonging to the Turkish empire, lying off the south-west coast of Asia&nbsp;Minor, between 35° 52' and 36° 28' N. lat. and 27° 40' and&nbsp;28° 15' E. long., about 10 miles south of Cape Alepo. Its&nbsp;length is about 45 niiles from north-east to south-west, its&nbsp;greatest breadth 22 miles, and its area nearly 424 square&nbsp;miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The island is diversilied in its surface, and is traversed from north to south by an elevated mountain range, the&nbsp;highest point of which, named in ancient times Atabyris&nbsp;or Atabyrium, and still called Atairo, rises to an elevation&nbsp;of 4560 feet. It commands a view of the elevated coast&nbsp;of Asia Minor towards the north, and of the Archipelago,&nbsp;studded with its numerous islands, on the north-west ;&nbsp;while on the south-west is seen Mount Ida in Crete, often&nbsp;veiled in clouds, and on the south and south-east the vast&nbsp;expanse of waters which wash the African shore. The&nbsp;rest of the island is occupied in great part by ranges of&nbsp;moderately elevated hills, on which are found extensive&nbsp;woods of ancient pines, planted by the hand of nature.&nbsp;These forests were formerly very thick, but they are now&nbsp;greatly thinned by the Turks, who cut them down and&nbsp;take no care to plant others in their place. Beneath these&nbsp;hills the surface of the island falls lower, and several hills&nbsp;in the form of amphitheatres extend their bases as far as&nbsp;the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rhodes was famed in ancient times for its delightful climate, and it still maintains its former reputation. The&nbsp;air is pure and salubrious, and it is said that there is&nbsp;hardly a day throughout the year in which the sun is not&nbsp;visible. The winds are liable to little variation ; they&nbsp;blow from the west, often with great violence, for nine&nbsp;months in the year, and at other times from the north ;&nbsp;and they moderate the summer heats, which are chiefly&nbsp;felt during the months of July and August, when the hot&nbsp;winds blow from the coast of Anatolia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rhodes, in addition to its fine climate, is blessed with a fertile soil, and produces a variety of the finest fruits&nbsp;and vegetables. Numerous streams and rivulets, which&nbsp;take their rise in the central range, water the surrounding plains and valleys of the island. The inhabitants&nbsp;have a great taste for gardens ; and around the villages&nbsp;are extensive cultivated fields and orchards, containing&nbsp;fig, pomegranate, and orange trees. On the sloping hills&nbsp;carob-trees, and others both useful and agreeable, still grow&nbsp;abundantly ; the vine also holds its place, and produces a&nbsp;species of wine which was highly valued by the ancients,&nbsp;though it seems to have degenerated greatly in modern&nbsp;times. The valleys afford rich pastures, and the plains&nbsp;produce every species of grain ; the wheat is of an excellent quality ; and, but for the extortions of its barbarian&nbsp;rulers, the island might be the seat of agriculture as well&nbsp;as commerce, and might export large quantities of corn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The commerce of the island has been of late years increasing at a rapid rate. Many British manufactures are imported by indirect routes, through Smyrna, Constantinople, Beyrout, and other places. Cotton stuffs, calicoes,&nbsp;and grey linen are among the goods most in demand. It&nbsp;is not so much, however, the peasantry of the island who&nbsp;use these British goods, for they prefer their own homemade stuffs ; but they are exported to the neighbouring&nbsp;coast of Anatolia, between Budrum and Adalia, and thence&nbsp;conveyed into the interior. The expansion of the trade&nbsp;has been very much owing to the establishment of steam&nbsp;navigation direct to the island, which is now visited regularly by French and Austrian steamers, as well as by some&nbsp;from England to Smyrna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The only town of any importance in the island is the capital, Rhodes, which stands at the north-east extremity.&nbsp;It rises in an imposing manner from the sea, on a gentle&nbsp;slope in the form of an amphitheatre. It is surrounded&nbsp;with walls and towers, and defended by a large moated&nbsp;castle of great strength. These fortifications are all the&nbsp;work of the Knights of St John. Above them rise the&nbsp;domes and minarets of the mosques, and the tufted stems&nbsp;of the palm trees, which adorn this like most other Oriental&nbsp;towns. The interior of the city does not correspond to its&nbsp;outward appearance. No trace exists of the splendour of&nbsp;the ancient city, with its regular streets, well-ordered plan,&nbsp;and numerous public buildings. The modern city of&nbsp;Rhodes is in general the work of the Knights of St John,&nbsp;and has altogether a mediæval aspect, the streets being&nbsp;for the most part narrow and winding, though the houses,&nbsp;as well as the public edifices, are in general solidly built&nbsp;of stone, and present at almost every step some memorial&nbsp;of the past in the escutcheons and coats of arms with&nbsp;which they are adorned. The picturesque fortifications&nbsp;also by which 'the city is surrounded remain almost&nbsp;unaltered as they were in the 15th century, and it has&nbsp;been remarked by numerous travellers that scarcely any&nbsp;city of western Europe has preserved its mediæval aspect&nbsp;so unchanged as this last refuge of European civilization&nbsp;in the East. The principal buildings which remain are&nbsp;the church of St John, which is become the principal&nbsp;mosque ; the hospital, whence the charity of the knights&nbsp;was liberally dispensed to the faithful from all quarters of&nbsp;the world, and which has been transformed into public&nbsp;granaries ; the palace of the grand master, now the residence of the pasha ; and the senate-house, which still contains some marbles and ancient columns. Of the streets,&nbsp;the best and widest is a long street which is still called&nbsp;the Street of the Knights. It is perfectly straight, and&nbsp;formed of old houses, on which remain the armorial bearings&nbsp;of the members of the order. On some of these buildings&nbsp;are still seen the arms of the popes and of some of the&nbsp;royal and noble houses of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The only relics of classical antiquity are the numerous inscribed altars and bases of statues, as well as architectural&nbsp;fragments, which are found scattered in the courtyards&nbsp;and gardens of the houses in the extensive suburbs which&nbsp;now surround the town, the whole of which were comprised&nbsp;within the limits of the ancient city. The foundations&nbsp;also of the moles that separate the harbours are of&nbsp;Hellenic work, though the existing moles were erected by&nbsp;the Knights of St John.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rhodes has at present two harbours. The least of these lies towards the east, and its entrance is obstructed by a&nbsp;barrier of rocks, so as to admit the entrance of but one ship&nbsp;at a time. It is sufficiently sheltered, but by the negligence&nbsp;of the Turks the sand has been suffered to accumulate&nbsp;until it has been gradually almost choked up. The other&nbsp;harbour is larger, and also in a bad condition ; here frigates&nbsp;of thirty guns may anchor, and are sheltered from the west</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
