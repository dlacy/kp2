<p><span class="font0">Rubinstein’s fame as one of the greatest of pianists will live in history. His technique bore comparison with that of Liszt;&nbsp;he possessed a power for interpreting the most different kinds&nbsp;of music which has not been surpassed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His brother Nikolaus (1835-1881) was also a remarkable pianist, and a marvellous teacher of music. He founded the&nbsp;conservatorium of music at Moscow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUBRUQUIS (or Rubrouck), WILLIAM OF (c. 1215-1270; fl. 1253-55), Franciscan friar, one of the chief medieval travellers&nbsp;and travel-writers. Nothing is known of him save what can&nbsp;be gathered from his own narrative, and from Roger Bacon, his&nbsp;contemporary and brother Franciscan. The name of Rubruquis&nbsp;(“ Fratris Willielmi de Rubruquis ”) is found in the imperfect&nbsp;MS. printed by Hakluyt in his collection, and followed in his&nbsp;Engh’sh translation, as well as in the completer issue of the&nbsp;English by Purchas. Writers of the 16th, 17th and 19th&nbsp;centuries have called the traveller </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Risbroucke</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rysbrokius&nbsp;(Rysbroeck</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ruysbroek</span><span class="font0"> in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Biographie universelle</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nouv. biog. générale)—</span><span class="font0">an error founded on the identification&nbsp;of his name of origin with Ruysbroeck in Brabant (a few miles&nbsp;south of Brussels) and perhaps promoted by the fame of John of&nbsp;Ruysbroeck or Rysbroeck (1294-1381), a Belgian mystic, whose&nbsp;treatises have been reprinted as late as 1848. It is only within&nbsp;the last twenty years that attention has been called to the fact&nbsp;that Rubrouck is the name of a village and commune in old&nbsp;(medieval) French Flanders, belonging to the canton of Cassel&nbsp;in the department du Nord, and lying some 8j m. N.E., of&nbsp;St Omer. In the library of the latter city many medieval&nbsp;documents exist referring expressly to de Rubroucks@@<sup>1</sup> of the&nbsp;12th and 13th centuries. It may be fairly assumed that Friar&nbsp;William came from this place;@@<sup>2</sup> thus Hakluyt’s conclusion is&nbsp;justified, as expressed in the title he gives to Lord Lumley’s&nbsp;MS. printed by him, now in the British Museum, MSS. Reg.,&nbsp;14 C. xiii. fol. 225 r.-3Ô r. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Itinerarium fratris Willielmi de&nbsp;Rubruquis de ordine fratrum Minorum,</span><span class="font0"> Galli, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anno gratie 1253, ad&nbsp;parles Orientales.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Friar William went to Tartary under orders from Louis IX. (St Louis). That king, at an earlier date, viz. December&nbsp;1248, when in Cyprus, had been visited by alleged envoys from&nbsp;Elchigaday (Ilchikadai, Ilchikdai), who commanded the Mongol&nbsp;hosts in Armenia and Persia. The king then despatched a&nbsp;return mission consisting of Friar Andrew of Longjumeau or&nbsp;Lonjumel and other ecclesiastics, who carried presents and&nbsp;letters for both Ilchikadai and the Great Khan. They reached&nbsp;the court of the latter in the winter of 1249-50, when there&nbsp;was no actual khan on the throne; and they returned, along&nbsp;with Tatar envoys, bearing a letter to Louis from the Mongol&nbsp;regent-mother which was couched in terms so arrogant that the&nbsp;king repented sorely of having sent such a mission (“ li rois se</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">repenti fort quant il y envoia,” Joinville, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de Saint Louis, </span><span class="font0">pp. 148-49, in Paris edition of 1858 by F. Michel, Paulin Paris&nbsp;and F. Didot). These returned envoys reached the king when&nbsp;he was at Caesarea, therefore between March 1251 and May&nbsp;1252. But not long after the king, hearing that the Tatar&nbsp;prince Sartak, son of Batu, was a “ baptized Christian,” felt&nbsp;moved to open communication with him, and for this purpose&nbsp;deputed Friar William of Rubrouck. The former rebuff had&nbsp;made the king chary of sending formal embassies, and Friar&nbsp;William on every occasion, beginning with a sermon delivered&nbsp;in St Sophia’s on Palm Sunday </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font0"> April 13th) 1253, disclaimed that character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Various histories of St Louis, and other documents, give particulars of the despatch of the mission of Friar Andrew from&nbsp;Cyprus, but none mention that of Friar William; and the first&nbsp;dates given by the latter are those of his sermon at Constantinople, and of his entrance into the Black Sea (May 7th, 1253).&nbsp;He must therefore have received his commission at Acre, where&nbsp;the king was residing from May 1252 to the 29th of June&nbsp;1253; but he had travelled by way of Constantinople, as has&nbsp;just been indicated, and there received letters to some of the&nbsp;Tatar chiefs from the emperor, who was at this time Baldwin de&nbsp;Courtenay, the last of the Latin dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The narrative of the journey is everywhere full of life and interest. The vast conquests of Jenghiz Khan were still in&nbsp;nominal dependence on his successors, at this time represented&nbsp;by Mangu Khan, reigning on the Mongolian steppes, but practically these conquests were splitting up into several great&nbsp;monarchies. Of these the Ulus of Juji, the eldest son of&nbsp;Jenghiz, formed the most westerly, and its ruler was Batu Khan,&nbsp;established on the Volga. Sartak is known in the history&nbsp;of the Mongols as Batu’s eldest son, and was appointed his&nbsp;successor, though he died immediately after his father (1256).&nbsp;The story of Sartak’s Christianity seems to have had some&nbsp;foundation; it was currently believed among Asiatic Christians, and it is alleged by Armenian writers that he had been&nbsp;brought up and baptized among the Russians. Pope Innocent&nbsp;IV. (August 29, 1254) refers with enthusiasm to Sartak’s&nbsp;baptism, of which he had just heard from a priest whom the&nbsp;khan had sent as envoy to the papal court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubrouck and his party landed at Soldaia, or Sudak, on the Crimean coast, then a centre of intercourse between the *&nbsp;Mediterranean world and what is now S. Russia. Equipped&nbsp;with horses and carts for the steppe, they travelled successively to the courts </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the nomad camps) of Scacatai (Kadan?),&nbsp;Sartak and Batu, thus crossing the Don and arriving at the&nbsp;Volga: of both these rivers Friar William gives vivid and&nbsp;interesting sketches. Batu kept the travellers for some time&nbsp;in suspense, and then referred them to the Great Khan himself,&nbsp;an order involving the enormous journey to Mongolia. The&nbsp;actual travelling of the party from the Crimea to the khan’s&nbsp;court near Karakorum cannot have been, on a rough calculation, less than 5000 m., and the return journey to Lajazzo&nbsp;in Cilicia would be longer by 500 to 700 m. The chief dates&nbsp;to be gathered from the narrative are as follows: the envoys&nbsp;embark on the “ Euxine,” May 7th, 1253; reach Soldaia,&nbsp;May 21st; set out thence, June 1st; reach the camp of Sartak,&nbsp;July 31st; begin the journey from the camp of Batu E. across&nbsp;the steppes, September 16th; turn S.E., November 1st; reach&nbsp;the Talas river, November 8th; leave Cailac@@<sup>3</sup> (S. of Lake&nbsp;Balkash), November 30th; reach the camp of the Great Khan,&nbsp;December 27th; leave the camp of the Great Khan on or about&nbsp;July 10th, 1254; reach camp of Batu again, September 16th;&nbsp;leave Batu’s camp at Sarai, November 1st; arrive at the Iron&nbsp;Gate (Derbent), November 13th; Christmas spent at Nakh-shivan or Nakhichevan (under Ararat); reach Antioch (from&nbsp;Lajazzo, Layes, or Ayas, of Cilicia, via Cyprus), June 29th, 1255;&nbsp;reach Tripoli, August 15th.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@3</sup> Cailac, where Rubrouck halted twelve days, is undoubtedly the Kayalik of the historians of the Mongols, the position of which is&nbsp;somewhat indefinite. The narrative of Rubrouck shows that it must&nbsp;have been near the modern Kopal.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
