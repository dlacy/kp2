<p><span class="font5">a conference at Marpurg, Luther and Zuinglius, toge-ther with ſeveral other of the more eminent doctors who adhered to the reſpective parties of theſe contending&nbsp;chiefs : but this meaſure was not attended with the ſa-lutary effects which were expected from it. The divines&nbsp;diſputed for four days in preſence of the landgrave. Lu-ther attacked oecolampadius, and Zuinglius was attack-ed by Melancthon. Zuinglius was accuſed of hereſy,&nbsp;not only on account of his explanation of the nature aud&nbsp;deſign of the Lord’s Supper, but alfo in confequence&nbsp;of the falfe notions he was fuppoſed to have adopted&nbsp;concerning the divinity of Chriſt, the efficacy of the&nbsp;divine -word, original </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">fin, </span><span class="font5">and ſome other parts of the&nbsp;Chriſtian doctrine. This illuſtrious reformer, however,&nbsp;cleared himfelf from the greateſt part of thefe charges&nbsp;whh the moſt triumphant evidence, and in fuch a manner as appeared fatisfactory even to Luther himfelf : but&nbsp;their diſſenſion concerning the manner of Chriſt’s preſence in the euchariſt ſtill remained ; nor could either&nbsp;of the contending parties be perſuaded to abandon, or&nbsp;even to modify, their opinions on that matter. The&nbsp;only advantage, therefore, which reſulted from the&nbsp;meeting was, that the jarring doctors formed a kind of&nbsp;truce, by agreeing to a mutual toleration of their fentiments, and leaving to the diſpoſal of Providence the cure&nbsp;of their diviſions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In the mean time news were received that the emperor deſigned to come into Germany, with a view to terminate all religious differences at the approaching diet&nbsp;of Augſhurg. Having foreſeen fome of the conſequences </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font5">thoſe diſputes, and, beſides, taken the advice of&nbsp;men of wiſdom, ſagacity, and experience, he became at&nbsp;certain times more cool in his proceedings, and more&nbsp;impartial in his opinions both of the contending parties and the merits of the cauſe. He, therefore, in&nbsp;an interview with the pope at Bologna, inſiſted, in&nbsp;the moſt ſerious and urgent manner, on the neceſſity&nbsp;of a general council. His remonſtrances and expo-ſtulations, however, could not move the pontiff ; who&nbsp;maintained with zeal the papal prerogatives, reproached&nbsp;the emperor with an ill-judged clemency, and alleged&nbsp;that it was the duty of that prince to ſupport the church,&nbsp;and to execute ſpeedy vengeance upon that obitinate&nbsp;heretical faction who dared to call in queſtion the au-thority of Rome and its pontiff. To this diſcourſe the&nbsp;emperor paid no regard ; looking upon it as a moſt iniquitous thing, and a meaſure directly oppoſite to the&nbsp;laws of the empire, to condemn unheard a ſet of men&nbsp;who had always approved themfelves good citizens, and&nbsp;deſerved well of their country in ſeveral reſpects. Hitherto indeed it was not eaſy for the emperor to form a&nbsp;clear idea of the matters in debate, ſince there was no&nbsp;regular ſyſtem as yet compoſed, by which it might be&nbsp;known with certainty what were the true cauſes of Luther's oppoſition to the pope. The elector of Saxony,&nbsp;therefore, ordered Luther, and other eminent divines,&nbsp;to commit to writing the chief articles of their religious&nbsp;ſyſtem, and the principal points in which they differed&nbsp;from the church of Rome. Luther, in compliance with</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">this order, delivered to the elector at Torgaw 17 articles which had been agreed upon in a conference at Sultzbach in 1529 ; from whence theſe received the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">the articles oſ Torgaw.</span><span class="font5"> But though theſe were&nbsp;deemed by Luther a ſufficient declaration of the ſenti-jκιents of the reformers, yet it was judged proper to en</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font5">large them, J∏ order to give perſpicuity </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">their argu</span><span class="font5">ments, and ſtrength to their cauſe. </span><span class="font5" style="font-weight:bold;">In </span><span class="font5">this work Melancthon was employed ; in which he ſhowcd a proper deference to the counſels of Luther, and expreſſed his&nbsp;fentiments and doctrine with the greateſt elegance and&nbsp;perſpicuity ; and thus came forth to view the famous&nbsp;</span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Confeffion oſ Augsburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Οη the 15th of June 1530, Charles arrived at Augſ. burg, and the diet was opened live days after. The&nbsp;Proteſtants received a formal permiſſion to preſent an&nbsp;account of their tenets to the diet on the 25th of the&nbsp;ſame month ; in conſequence of which, at the time ap-pointed, Chriſtian Bayer, chancellor of Saxony, read,&nbsp;in the German language, before the emperor and the&nbsp;princes affembled, the confeſſion of Augſhurg above-mentioned. It contained 28 chapters, of which </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">21&nbsp;</span><span class="font5">were employed in repreſenting the religious opinions of&nbsp;the Proteſtants, and the other feven in pointing out the&nbsp;errors and fuperſtitions of the church of Rome. The&nbsp;princes heard it with the deepeſt attention and recollection of mind : it confirmed ſome in the principles they&nbsp;had embraced ; ſurpriſed others ; and many, who be-fore this time had little or no idea of the religious ſentiments of Luther, were now not only convinced of&nbsp;their innocence, but delighted with thcir purity and&nbsp;fimplicity. The copies of this Confeſſion, which after&nbsp;being read were delivered to the emperor, were ſigned&nbsp;by John elector of Saxony, George marquis of Bran-denburg, Erneſt duke of Lunenburg, Philip landgrave&nbsp;of Heife, Wolfgang prince of Anhalt, and by the im-perial cities of Nuremberg and Reutlingen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The creatures of the church of Rome who were pre* fent at this diet employed John Faber, afterw<sup>τ</sup>ards biſhop&nbsp;of vienna, together with Eckius, and another doctor&nbsp;named </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Cockdœus,</span><span class="font5"> to draw up a refutation of the Protef-tant confeſſion : which refutation having been publicly&nbsp;read, the emperor required the Proteſtant members to&nbsp;acquiefce in it, and put an end to tbe religious diſputes&nbsp;by an unlimited ſubmiſſion to the opinions and doctrines&nbsp;contained in this anſwer. But this demand was far from&nbsp;being complied with. The Proteſtants declared on the&nbsp;contrary, that they were by no means ſatisfied with the&nbsp;reply of their adverſaries ; and earneſtly defired a copy&nbsp;of it, that they might more fully demonſtrate its extreme&nbsp;infufficiency and weakneſs. But this reaſonable requeſt&nbsp;was refuſed by the emperor ; who interpoſed his ſupreme authority to prevent any farther proceedings in&nbsp;this matter, and ſolemnly prohibited the publication of&nbsp;any new writings or declarations that might contribute&nbsp;to lengthen out theſe religious debates. This, however,&nbsp;did not reduce the Proteſtants to ſilence. The divines&nbsp;of that communion, who had been preſent at the diet,&nbsp;endeavoured to recollect the arguments and objections&nbsp;employed by Faber, and had again recourſe to the pen&nbsp;of Melancthon, who refuted them in an ample and ſa-tisfactory manner in a piece which was preſented to thc&nbsp;emperor on the 2 2d of September, but which Charles&nbsp;refnſed to receive. This anſwer was afterwards enlarged&nbsp;by Melancthon, when he had obtained a copy of Faber’s&nbsp;reply ; and was publiſhed in the year 1531, with the&nbsp;other pieces that related to the doctrine and difeipline&nbsp;of the Lutheran church, under the title of </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">A Defence of&nbsp;the Cοnfijfiοn oſ Augsburg.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font1">Matters now began to draw towards a criſis.
