        <p><span class="font1">pauper population in the towns, and the denudation and desolation of
                the country districts. His strong hand carried&nbsp;out the scheme so often proposed
                by the popular leaders&nbsp;since the days of Gaius Gracchus, the colonization
                of&nbsp;Carthage and Corinth. Allotments of land on a large&nbsp;scale were made in
                Italy ; decaying towns were reinforced&nbsp;by fresh drafts of settlers ; on the
                large estates and cattle&nbsp;farms the owners were required to find employment for
                a&nbsp;certain amount of free labour ; and a slight and temporary&nbsp;stimulus was
                given to Italian industry by the reimposition of harbour dues ιxpon foreign
                    goods.@@<sup>1</sup> To these&nbsp;measures must be added his schemes for the
                draining of&nbsp;the Fucine Lake and the Pomptine Marshes, for a new
                road&nbsp;across the Apennines, and for turning the course of
                    the&nbsp;Tiber.@@<sup>2</sup> It is true that these vigorous efforts to
                revive&nbsp;the agrarian prosperity of Italy were made along the old&nbsp;lines laid
                down eighty years before by the Gracchi, and&nbsp;that their final success was no
                greater than that of preceding efforts in the same direction, but they are a proof
                of&nbsp;the spirit in which Cæsar understood the responsibilities&nbsp;of absolute
                power, and their failure was due to causes&nbsp;which no legislation could remove.
                The reform of the&nbsp;calendar, which has been described elsewhere,@@<sup>3</sup>
                completes&nbsp;a record of administrative reform which entitles Cæsar to&nbsp;the
                praise of having governed well, whatever may be&nbsp;thought of the validity of his
                title to govern at all. But&nbsp;how did Cæsar deal with what was after all the
                greatest&nbsp;problem which he was called upon to solve, the establishment of a
                satisfactory government for the empire? One&nbsp;point indeed was already
                settled—the necessity, if the&nbsp;empire was to hold together at all, of placing
                the army,&nbsp;the provinces, and the control of the foreign policy in&nbsp;more
                vigorous hands than those of a number of changing&nbsp;magistrates independent of
                each other, and only very&nbsp;imperfectly controlled by the senate at home.
                Some&nbsp;centralization of the executive authority was indispensable,&nbsp;and this
                part of his work Cæsar thoroughly performed.&nbsp;From the moment when he seized the
                moneys in the&nbsp;treasury on his first entry into Rome@@<sup>4</sup> down to the
                day of&nbsp;his death he recognized no other authority but his&nbsp;throughout the
                empire. He alone directed the policy of&nbsp;Rome in foreign affairs ; the legions
                were led, and the&nbsp;provinces governed, not by independent magistrates,
                but&nbsp;by his “legates;”@@<sup>5</sup> and the title “imperator” which
                he&nbsp;adopted was intended to express the absolute and unlimited&nbsp;nature of
                the “ imperium ” he claimed, as distinct from&nbsp;the limited spheres of authority
                possessed by republican&nbsp;magistrates.@@<sup>6</sup> In so centralizing the
                executive authority&nbsp;over the empire at large, Cæsar was but developing
                the&nbsp;policy implied in the Gabinian and Manilian laws, and&nbsp;the precedent he
                established was closely followed by his&nbsp;successors. It was otherwise with the
                more difficult&nbsp;question of the form under which this new
                executive&nbsp;authority should be exercised and the relation it should&nbsp;hold to
                the republican constitution. We must be content&nbsp;to remain in ignorance of the
                precise shape which Cæsar&nbsp;intended ultimately to give to the new system.
                The&nbsp;theory that he contemplated a revival of the old
                    Roman&nbsp;kingship@@<sup>7</sup> is supported by little more than the
                popular&nbsp;gossip of the day, and the form under which he actually</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">wielded his authority can hardly have been regarded by so sagacious a
                statesman as more than a provisional arrangement. This form was that of the
                dictatorship ; and in&nbsp;favour of the choice it might have beeu urged that
                the&nbsp;dictatorship was the office naturally marked out by&nbsp;republican
                tradition as the one best suited to carry the&nbsp;state safely through a serious
                crisis, that the powers it&nbsp;conveyed were wide, that it was as dictator that
                Sulla had&nbsp;reorganized the state, and that a dictatorship had been&nbsp;spoken
                of as the readiest means of legalizing Pompey’s&nbsp;protectorate of the republic in
                53-52. The choice nevertheless was a bad one. It was associated with those
                very&nbsp;Sullan traditions from which Cæsar was most anxious to&nbsp;sever himself
                ; it implied necessarily the suspension for&nbsp;the time of all constitutional
                government ; and, lastly, the&nbsp;dictatorship as held by Cæsar could not even
                plead that it&nbsp;conformed to the old rules and traditions of the
                office.&nbsp;There was indeed a precedent in Sulla’s case for a&nbsp;dictator “
                reipublicae Constituendae causa,” but Cæsar was&nbsp;not only appointed in an
                unusual manner, but appointed&nbsp;for an unprecedentedly long period,@@<sup>8</sup>
                and the “ perpetual&nbsp;dictatorship ” granted him after his crowning victory
                at&nbsp;Munda (45) was a contradiction in terms and a repudiation of constitutional
                government which excited the&nbsp;bitterest animosity.@@<sup>9</sup> The
                dictatorship served well enough&nbsp;for the time to give some appearance of
                legality to&nbsp;Cæsar’s autocratic authority, but it was not—even, it
                is&nbsp;probable, in his own eyes—a satisfactory solution of
                the&nbsp;problem.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">A second question, hardly less important than the establishment and
                legalization of a strong central executive authority over the army and the
                provinces, was that of&nbsp;the position to be assigned to the old constitution, by
                the&nbsp;side of this new power. So far as Cæsar himself was&nbsp;concerned, the
                answer was for the time sufficiently clear.&nbsp;The old constitution was not
                formally abrogated. The&nbsp;senate met and deliberated ; the assembly passed laws
                and&nbsp;elected magistrates ; there were still consuls, prætors,&nbsp;ædiles,
                quæstors, and tribunes ; and Cæsar himself, like his&nbsp;successors, professed to
                hold his authority by the will of&nbsp;the people. But senate, assembly, and
                magistrates were&nbsp;all alike subordinated to the paramount authority of
                the&nbsp;dictator ; and this subordination was, in appearance at&nbsp;least, more
                direct and complete under the rule of Cæsar&nbsp;than under that of Augustus. Cæsar
                was by nature as&nbsp;impatient as Augustus was tolerant of established forms
                ;&nbsp;and, dazzled by the splendour of his career of victory and&nbsp;by his
                ubiquitous energy and versatility, the Roman&nbsp;public, high and low, prostrated
                themselves before him and&nbsp;heaped honours upon him with a reckless profusion
                which&nbsp;made the existence of any authority by the side of his&nbsp;own an
                    absurdity.@@<sup>10</sup> Hence under Cæsar the old constitution was repeatedly
                disregarded, or suspended in a way&nbsp;which contrasted unfavourably with the more
                respectful&nbsp;attitude assumed by Augustus. For months together&nbsp;Rome was left
                without any regular magistrates, and was&nbsp;governed like a subject town by
                Cæsar’s prefects.@@<sup>11</sup> At&nbsp;another time a tribune was seen exercising
                authority outside the city bounds and invested with the “ imperium ”&nbsp;of a
                    prætor.@@<sup>12</sup> At the elections, candidates appeared before</span></p>
