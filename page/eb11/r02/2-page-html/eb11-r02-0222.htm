<p><span class="font0">that only a small portion of Southern Rhodesia is under 3000 ft. The eastern boundary, along Portuguese East Africa,&nbsp;forms the edge of the tableland; the height of the edge is&nbsp;accentuated by a series of ridges, so that the country here&nbsp;assumes a mountainous appearance, the grass-clad heights&nbsp;being reminiscent of the Cheviot Hills of Scotland or the lower&nbsp;Alps of Switzerland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geology.—</span><span class="font1">The geology of this region is very imperfectly known. Metamorphic rocks extend over immense areas, but these and the&nbsp;other formations are to a great extent hidden beneath superficial&nbsp;deposits. Conglomerates and banded ironstone rocks are found&nbsp;in the metamorphic areas around Bulawayo and the borders of&nbsp;Katanga; but to what extent these represent the different formations older than the Karroo and newer than the Swaziland schists&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Transvaal)</span><span class="font1"> has not been satisfactorily determined. Certain&nbsp;gold-bearing conglomerates are regarded as the equivalents of&nbsp;the Witwatersrand series, but the main sources of gold are the&nbsp;veins of quartz and igneous rocks developed in the metamorphic&nbsp;series. The Karroo formation is well represented, and covers&nbsp;extensive areas in the Zambezi basin. The Dwyka conglomerate</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">appears to be developed in the Tuli district. The coal-bearing strata of Tuli and Wankies are certainly of Karroo age. They have&nbsp;yielded the fossil remains of fishes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acrolepis molyneuxi,</span><span class="font1"> the freshwater mollusc </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Palaeornutcla,</span><span class="font1"> a few reptilian bones, and species of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Glossopteris</span><span class="font1"> among, plants..</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The age of a widely distributed series Of red-white sandstones, named by Molyneux the Forest Sandstone, remains uncertain.&nbsp;Molyneux considers them Tertiary, but it is not improbable that&nbsp;sandstones of various ages from Karroo to those of Recent date are&nbsp;represented. They contain numerous interbedded sheets of basalt,&nbsp;but it is doubtful if any of these are of so recent a date as Tertiary.&nbsp;Rocks of Karroo age occur round Lake Bangweulu, and contain&nbsp;numerous fossil plants and a few small shells. The age of the&nbsp;wide, thick sheet of basalt, through which the Zambezi has cut the&nbsp;Batoka. gorge between the Victoria Falls and Wankies,. remains&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">uncertain.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Climate.—</span><span class="font1">As Southern Rhodesia extends between 16<sup>0</sup> S. and 22° S., and is thus within the tropics, it might be expected that the&nbsp;climate would be trying for Europeans, but owing to the elevation&nbsp;of the country the temperature is rarely too high for comfort.&nbsp;Another factor that renders the climate equable is that the rainy&nbsp;season coincides with the summer months, and the winter months&nbsp;are dry. The. nights are always cool, so that the climate approximates to the ideal. On the high tableland which forms the great&nbsp;proportion of the country the temperature in the shade rarely&nbsp;reaches </span><span class="font0">ioo° </span><span class="font1">and there is just sufficient frost in the winter to be&nbsp;useful to farmers. The winter months are June, July and August,&nbsp;and the hottest months are the spring months of September,&nbsp;October and November, just before the rains begin. A temperature&nbsp;of ( io° is sometimes reached in the low-lying district of Tuli&nbsp;(elevation 1890 ft.) and in the Zambezi valley. There is a striking&nbsp;difference, between the minimum temperatures on the ground and&nbsp;those registered 4 ft. from the ground. The latter rarely reach&nbsp;freezing-point, but the ground temperature is sometimes as low&nbsp;as 24°. Hoar frost is most noticeable in the vleis and low-lying&nbsp;areas. The period known as the rainy season extends from September to March, but the greatest amount falls in the last three&nbsp;months of that period. The mean annual rainfall for various&nbsp;stations in the eastern half of Rhodesia ranges&nbsp;from 24 to 44 in., the greatest rainfall being&nbsp;along the eastern border. For the western half&nbsp;the mean ranges from 19 to 27 in., but in the&nbsp;south-w'est corner it is much drier, the rainfall so&nbsp;far recorded never reaching 18 in. There is a&nbsp;sufficiency of rain for all summer crops, but winter&nbsp;crops, .such as wheat, must be. assisted by irrigation.&nbsp;Malaria is prevalent in certain districts during the&nbsp;wet season, but this is now preventable and the&nbsp;country is very healthy, children, especially in towns&nbsp;and on the high veld, growing sturdily. The&nbsp;death-rate amongst Europeans is only about 15&nbsp;per 1000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fauna.—</span><span class="font1">Rhodesia is rich in the larger graminivorous animals, especially in antelope, which number about twenty-five varieties, including&nbsp;kudu, eland, hartebeeste, roan, sable, wilde-beeste and impala. The most common are the&nbsp;duiker, the stembok and the rietbok. Other&nbsp;herbivorous animals found in the country are&nbsp;the buffalo, giraffe, zebra, elephant, hippopotamus,&nbsp;rhinoceros (black and white), warthog, and various&nbsp;baboons and monkeys. The buffalo is now rare,&nbsp;having been almost exterminate^ by the rinderpest in 1896. The carnivora include the lion,&nbsp;leopard, cheetah, and various wild cats, foxes,&nbsp;wolves, jackals and dogs. There are at least&nbsp;five varieties · of the mongoose. Amongst the&nbsp;rodents are squirrels, dormice, rats (eleven kinds),&nbsp;the porcupine, the Cape hare and the rock hare^&nbsp;Of insectivora the ant-eater, the ant-bear, the&nbsp;hedgehog and various shrews may be mentioned.&nbsp;Bats number eleven varieties. Snakes are numerous, the most important being the python, thé&nbsp;puff-adder and the cobra. Crocodiles and iguanas&nbsp;are found in most of the rivers, and chameleons&nbsp;and lizards are ve ry common. Rhodesia abounds&nbsp;in beetles, butterflies and moths, and new varieties&nbsp;are frequently discovered in the wet season. Mention ought to be made of white ants (termites)&nbsp;and locusts. The ants are a serious pest, attacking all cut timber resting in or on the ground.&nbsp;They gradually envelop the dead wood in à&nbsp;mound of earth and consume it wholly, so that all poles and&nbsp;house-timber have to be carefully protected either by chemical&nbsp;preparations or by raising them clear from contact with the&nbsp;earth. The mounds which the white ants erect often reach a&nbsp;height of many feet. There are several kinds, the black-headed&nbsp;nipper ant, chiefly found in the west, being the most destructive.&nbsp;Locusts are particularly dreaded in their wingless state, when&nbsp;they clean off every green leaf, every bit of vegetation, as they&nbsp;■ march on in their hundreds of thousands. The rivers are not very&nbsp;plentiful in fish, but occasional sport is afforded by barbel, bream&nbsp;and tiger-fish.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;· *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;’</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Birds to the number of about 400 varieties have been found in Rhodesia. The largest of these are the ostrich, the secretary-bird/&nbsp;the paauw, the koorhaan, cranes (three varieties), storks (four),&nbsp;vultures (six) and eagles (eight). The chief birds that attract-sportsmen, besides The paauw and the koorhaan already mentioned, are the guinea-fowl (three kinds), partridge and francolin&nbsp;(seven kinds), wild goose, duck and teal. Some of the most interesting birds are the weaver-birds (eighteen), the ox-peckers,&nbsp;which find their food on the backs of cattle, the kingfishers (eight),&nbsp;the hornbills (five), the parrots, lovebirds, the polygamous widow&nbsp;birds—whose females are of insignificant appearance, but. whose&nbsp;males develop a brilliant plumage and lengthy tails during the</span></p><div>
