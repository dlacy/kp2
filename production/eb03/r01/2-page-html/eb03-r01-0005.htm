The moſt celebrated races of that time were called be’l-courſes, the prize of the conqueror being a bell:&nbsp;hence, perhaps, the phraſe of </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">bearing the bell,</span><span class="font1"> when applied to excellence, is derived In the latter end of&nbsp;Charles I.’s reign, races were performed in Hyde-Park.&nbsp;Newmarket was alfo a place for the ſame purpoſe,&nbsp;though it was ſirſt uſed for hunting. Racing was re-vived ſoon after the Reſtoration, and much encouraged&nbsp;by Charles II. who appointed races for his own amuſe-mcnt at Datchet Mead, when he reſided at windſor.&nbsp;Newmarket, however, now became the principal place.&nbsp;The king attended in perſon, eſtabliſhed a houfe for&nbsp;his own acconſmodation, and kept and entered horſes in&nbsp;his own name. Inſtead ©f bells, he gave a filver bowl&nbsp;or cup value 100 guineas ; on which prize the exploits&nbsp;and pedigree of the fucceſsful horſe were generally en-graved. Inſtead of the cup or bowl, the royal gift is&nbsp;now a hundred guineas, william III. not only added&nbsp;to the plates, but even founded an academy for riding ;&nbsp;and Queen Anne continued the bounty of her anceſ-tors, adding ſeveral plates herfelf. George I. towards&nbsp;the end of his reign, diſcontinued the plates, and gave&nbsp;in their room a hundred guineas.

<p><span class="font1">RACK (Edmund), a perſon well known in the literary world by his attachment to, and promotion of, agricultural knowledge ; he was a native of Norfolk, a&nbsp;Quaker. His education was common, and he was ap-prenticed originally to a ſhopkeeper : his ſociety was&nbsp;ſelect in this ſituation, and by improving himſelf in&nbsp;learning, his converſation was enjoyed by a reſpectable&nbsp;acquaintance. He wrote many eſſays, poems, and letters, and ſome few controverſial tracts. At length he&nbsp;ſettled, about his 40th ye&amp;r, at Bath in 1775, and was&nbsp;ſoon introduced to the molt eminent literati of that&nbsp;place, among whom Dr wilſon and Mrs Macaulay&nbsp;highly eſteemed him for his integrity and abilities. In&nbsp;1777 hc publiſhed </span><span class="font6" style="font-style:italic;">Msator<sup>,</sup>s Letters,</span><span class="font1"> a moral work,&nbsp;which has run through many editions. But this year&nbsp;he gained great celebrity by his plan of an agricultural&nbsp;ſociety, which was ſoon adopted by four counties. He&nbsp;ſtill further advanced his fame by his papers in the Far-,&nbsp;mer’s Magazine, and his communications in the Bath So-ciety’s papers ; a work remarkable for its ingenuity and'&nbsp;ſpirit. His laſt engagement was in the Hiſtory of So-merſetſhire, where the topographical parochial furveys&nbsp;were his. Thia work, in 3 vols 4to, was publiſhed in&nbsp;1791, by his colleague the Reverend Mr Collinſon.—.&nbsp;Mr Rack died </span><span class="font3">of </span><span class="font1">an aſthma in February 1787,&nbsp;aged 52.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rack,</span><span class="font1"> an engine of torture, furniſhed with pulleys, cords, &amp;c. for extorting confeffion from criminals.—&nbsp;The trial by rack is utterly unknown to the law of&nbsp;England ; though once, when the dukes of Exeter&nbsp;and SuffoIk, and other miniſters of Henry VL had laid&nbsp;a deſign to introduce the civil law into this kingdom as&nbsp;the rule of government ; for a beginning thereof they&nbsp;erected a rack for torture, which was caffed in deriſion&nbsp;the duke of Exeter’s daughter, and ſtill remains in the&nbsp;I ower of London, where it was occafionally ufed aa&nbsp;an engine of ſtate, not of law, more than once in the&nbsp;reign of Queen Elizabeth. But when, upon the aſſaf-ſination orVilliers duke of Buckingham, by Felton, it&nbsp;was propoſed in the privy council to put the aſſaffin to&nbsp;the rack, in order to diſcover his acccomplices} the&nbsp;judges, being conſulted, declared unanimouſly, to their&nbsp;own honour and the honour of the EngIiſh law, that&nbsp;no ſuch proceeding was allowable by the laws of Eng-land, it ſeems aſtoniſhing that this ufage of admink&nbsp;ſtering the torture ſhould be ſaid to ariſe from a tenderneſs to the lives of men ; and yet this is the reaſon&nbsp;given for its introduction in the civil lav/, and its ſubſequent, adoption by the French and other foreign na»&nbsp;tions, viz. becauſe the laws cannot endure that any man&nbsp;ſhould die upon the evidence of a falſe, or even a ſingle&nbsp;witnef⅛, and therefore contrived this method that inno-cence ſhould manifeſt itſelf by a ſtout denial, or guilt&nbsp;by a plain confeffion : thus rating a man's virtue by the&nbsp;hardineſs of his conſtitution, and his guilt by the ſenſi-bility of his nerves, The Marquis Beccaria, in an ex-quifite. piece of raillery, has propoſed this problem, with&nbsp;a gravity and precifion that are truly mathematical :</span></p>
