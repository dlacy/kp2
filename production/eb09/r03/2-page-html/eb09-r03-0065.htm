            <p><span class="font2">was made the pretext for a more emphatic assertion of Roman
                    ascendency. All those suspected of Macedonian&nbsp;leanings were removed to
                    Italy, as hostages for the loyalty&nbsp;of their several
                        communities,@@<sup>1</sup> and the real motive for the&nbsp;step was made
                    clear by the exceptionally severe treatment&nbsp;of the Achæans, whose loyalty
                    was not really doubtful,&nbsp;but whose growing power in the Peloponnese and
                    growing&nbsp;independence of language had awakened alarm at Rome.&nbsp;A
                    thousand of their leading men, among them the historian&nbsp;Polybius, were
                    carried off to Italy (see </span><span class="font2"
                    style="font-variant:small-caps;">Polybius).</span><span class="font2">
                    In&nbsp;Ætolia the Romans connived at the massacre by their so-called friends of
                    500 of the opposite party. Acarnania&nbsp;was weakened by the loss of Leucas,
                    while Athens was&nbsp;rewarded for her unambitious loyalty by the gift of
                    Delos&nbsp;and Samos.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">But this somewhat violent experiment only answered for a time. In
                    148 the Achæans rashly persisted, in&nbsp;spite of warnings, in attempting to
                    compel Sparta by force&nbsp;<sup>,</sup> of arms to submit to the league. λVhen
                    threatened by&nbsp;Rome with the loss of all that they had gained
                    since&nbsp;Cynoscephalæ, they madly rushed into war.@@<sup>2</sup> They
                    were&nbsp;easily defeated, and a “commission of ten,” under the&nbsp;presidency
                    of L. Mummius, was appointed by the senate&nbsp;thoroughly to resettle the
                    affairs of Greece.@@<sup>3</sup> Corinth, by&nbsp;orders of the senate, was
                    burnt to the ground, and its&nbsp;territory confiscated. Thebes and Chalcis were
                    destroyed,&nbsp;and the walls of all towns which had shared in the
                    last&nbsp;desperate outbreak were razed to the ground. All the&nbsp;existing
                    Cpnfederaciesweredissolved; no “commercium”&nbsp;was allowed between one
                    community and another. Everywhere an aristocratic type of constitution,
                    according to the&nbsp;invariable Roman practice, was established, and the
                    payment of a tribute imposed. Into Greece, as into Macedonia&nbsp;in 167, the
                    now familiar features of the provincial system</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">were introduced—disarmament, isolation, and taxation. The Greeks
                    were still nominally free, and no separate&nbsp;province with a governor of its
                        own@@<sup>4</sup> was established, but&nbsp;the needed central control was
                    provided by assigning to&nbsp;the neighbouring governor of Macedonia a general
                    supervision over the affairs of Greece. From the Adriatic to&nbsp;the Ægean, and
                    as far north as the river Drilo and Mount&nbsp;Scardus, the whole peninsula was
                    now under direct Roman&nbsp;rule.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Beyond the Ægean the Roman protectorate worked no better than in
                    Macedonia and Greece, and the demoralizing recriminations, quarrels, and
                    disorders which flourished&nbsp;under its shadow were aggravated by its longer
                    duration,&nbsp;and by the still more selfish view taken by Rome of
                    the&nbsp;responsibilities connected with it.@@<sup>6</sup> At one period
                    indeed,&nbsp;after the battle of l<sup>λ</sup>ydna, it seemed as if the
                    more&nbsp;vigorous, if harsh, system then initiated in Macedon and&nbsp;Greece
                    was to be adopted farther east also. The levelling policy pursued towards
                    Macedon and the Achæans&nbsp;was applied with less justice to Rome’s two
                    faithful and&nbsp;favoured allies, Rhodes and Pergamum. The former
                    had&nbsp;rendered themselves obnoxious to Rome by their independent tone, and
                    still more by their power and commercial prosperity. On a charge of complicity
                    with Perseus&nbsp;they were threatened with war, and though this danger&nbsp;was
                        averted@@<sup>7</sup> they were forced to exchange their equal&nbsp;alliance
                    with Rome for one which placed them in close</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font2">dependence upon her, and to resign the lucrative possessions in
                    Lycia and Caria given them in 189. Finally, their commercial prosperity was
                    ruined by the establishment of a free port at Delos,@@<sup>8</sup> and by the
                    short-sighted&nbsp;acquiescence of Rome in the raids of the Cretan
                    pirates.&nbsp;With Eumenes of Pergamum no other fault could be found&nbsp;than
                    that he was strong and successful ; but this was&nbsp;enough. His brother
                    Attalus was invited, but in vain, to&nbsp;- become his rival. His turbulent
                    neighbours, the Galatæ,&nbsp;were encouraged to harass him by raids. Pamphylia
                    was&nbsp;declared independent, and favours were heaped upon&nbsp;Prusias of
                    Bithynia. These and other annoyances and&nbsp;humiliations had the desired
                    effect. Eumenes and his&nbsp;two successors—his brother and son, Attalus H.
                    and&nbsp;Attalus III.—contrived indeed by studious humility and&nbsp;dexterous
                    flattery to retain their thrones, but Pergamum&nbsp;ceased to be a powerful
                    state, and its weakness, added to&nbsp;that of Rhodes, increased the prevalent
                    disorder in Asia&nbsp;Minor. During the same period we have other indications of
                    a temporary activity on the part of Rome. The&nbsp;frontier of the protectorate
                    was pushed forward to the&nbsp;confines of Armenia and to the upper Euphrates
                    by&nbsp;alliances with the kings of Pontus and Cappadocia beyond&nbsp;the Halys.
                    In Syria, on the death of Antiochus Epiphanes&nbsp;(164), Rome intervened to
                    place a minor, Antiochus&nbsp;Eupator, on the throne, under Roman
                        guardianship.@@<sup>9</sup> In&nbsp;168 Egypt formally acknowledged the
                    suzerainty of,&nbsp;Rome,@@<sup>10</sup> and in 163 the senate, in the exercise
                    of this new ,&nbsp;authority, restored Ptolemy Philometor to his throne,
                    but&nbsp;at the same time weakened his position by handing over&nbsp;Cyrene and
                    Cyprus to his brother Euergetes.@@<sup>11</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">But this display of energy was short-lived. From the death of
                    Eumenes in 159 down to 133 Rome, secure <sub>i&nbsp;</sub>in the absence of any
                    formidable power in the East, and&nbsp;busy with affairs in Macedonia, Africa,
                    and Spain, relapsed&nbsp;into an inactivity the disastrous results of which
                    revealed&nbsp;themselves in the next period, in the rise of Mithradates&nbsp;of
                    Pontus, the spread of Cretan and Cilician piracy, and&nbsp;the advance of
                    Parthia. To the next period also belongs&nbsp;the conversion, on the death of
                    Attalus III., of the&nbsp;kingdom of Pergamum into the Roman province of
                    Asia.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Both the western and eastern Mediterranean now acknowledged the
                    suzerainty of Rome, but her relations&nbsp;with the two were from the first
                    different. The West fell&nbsp;to her as the prize of victory over Carthage, and,
                    the&nbsp;Carthaginian power broken, there was no hindrance to the&nbsp;immediate
                    establishment in Sicily, Sardinia, Spain, and&nbsp;finally in Africa, of direct
                    Roman rule. To the majority,&nbsp;moreover, of her Western subjects she brought
                    a civilization&nbsp;as well as a government of a higher type than any
                    before&nbsp;known to them. And so in the West she not only formed&nbsp;provinces
                    but created a new and wider Roman world.&nbsp;To the east, on the contrary, she
                    came as the liberator of&nbsp;the Greeks ; and it was only slowly that in this
                    part of&nbsp;the empire her provincial system made way. In the
                    East,&nbsp;moreover, the older civilization she found there
                    obstinately&nbsp;held its ground. Her proconsuls governed and her
                    legions&nbsp;protected the Greek communities, but to the last the
                    East&nbsp;remained in language, manners, and thought Greek and&nbsp;not
                    Roman.</span></p>
