<p><span class="font0">This almost complete effacement of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font0"> was largely due to the fact that they had ceased to represent anything but&nbsp;the populace of Rome, and the comparatively greater&nbsp;vitality shown by the old magistracies is mainly&nbsp;attributable to the value they continued to possess&nbsp;in the eyes of the Roman upper class. But, though&nbsp;they were eagerly sought (Plin. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epp.</span><span class="font0"> ii. 9, vi. 6), and conferred&nbsp;on their holders considerable social distinction, the magistrates&nbsp;ceased, except in name, to be the popularly chosen executive&nbsp;officers of the Roman state. In the administration of the&nbsp;empire at large they had no share, if we except the subordinate&nbsp;duties still assigned to the quaestor in a province. In Rome,&nbsp;to which their sphere of work was limited, they were overshadowed by the dominant authority of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps,</span><span class="font0"> while their&nbsp;range of duties was increasingly circumscribed by the gradual&nbsp;transference of administrative authority, even within the city,&nbsp;to the emperor and his subordinate officials. And their dependence on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font0"> was confirmed by the control he&nbsp;exercised over their appointment. For all candidates the&nbsp;approval, if not the commendation, of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font0"> became&nbsp;the indispensable condition of success, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font0"> on&nbsp;his side treated these ancient offices as pieces of preferment with&nbsp;which to reward his adherents or gratify the ambition of Roman&nbsp;nobles. The dignity of the office, too, was impaired by the&nbsp;practice* begun by Caesar and continued by Augustus and his&nbsp;successors, of granting the insignia to men who had not&nbsp;held the actual magistracy itself.@@<sup>1</sup> The consulship was&nbsp;still the highest post open to the private citizen, and consular&nbsp;rank a necessary qualification for high office in the provinces;@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>but the actual consuls have scarcely any other duties than those&nbsp;of presiding in the senate and occasionally executing its decrees,&nbsp;while their term of office dwindles from a year to six and finally&nbsp;to two months.@@<sup>3</sup> In the age of Tacitus and the younger Pliny,&nbsp;the contrast is striking between the high estimate set on the&nbsp;dignity of the office and the frankness with which its limited&nbsp;powers and its dependence on the emperor are&nbsp;acknowledged.@@<sup>4</sup> The praetors continued to exercise&nbsp;their old jurisdiction with little formal change down&nbsp;at least to the latter half of the second century, but only as&nbsp;subordinate to the higher judicial authority of the&nbsp;emperor.@@<sup>5</sup> The aediles retained only such petty police&nbsp;duties as did not pass to one or another of the imperial&nbsp;prefects and commissioners. The tribunate fared&nbsp;still worse, for, by the side of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tribunicia potestas&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">wielded by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps,</span><span class="font0"> it sank into insignificance.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The quaestorship suffered less change than any other of the old offices. It kept its place as the first step on the ladder&nbsp;of promotion, and there was still a quaestor attached to&nbsp;each governor of a senatorial province, to the consuls</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">in Rome, and to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font0"> himself.@@<sup>7 </sup>The senate alone among republican institutions retained</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">some importance and influence, and it thus came to be regarded as sharing the government of the Empire with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font0"> himself. It nominally controlled the administration of Italy and of the “ public provinces,” whose governors</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">it appointed. It is to the senate, in theory, that the supreme power reverts in the absence of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps.</span><span class="font0"> It is by decree of&nbsp;the senate that the new </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font0"> immediately receives his&nbsp;powers and privileges,@@<sup>8</sup> though he is still supposed to derive&nbsp;them ultimately from the people. After the cessation of all&nbsp;legislation by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comitia,</span><span class="font0"> the only law-makh:g authority, other&nbsp;than that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font0"> by his edicts, was that of the senate by&nbsp;its decrees.@@<sup>9</sup> Its judicial authority was co-ordinate with that&nbsp;of the emperor, and at the close of the 1st century we find&nbsp;the senators claiming, as the emperor's “ peers,” to be exempt&nbsp;from his jurisdiction.@@<sup>10</sup> But in spite of the outward dignity&nbsp;of its position, and of the deference with which it was frequently&nbsp;treated, the senate became gradually almost as powerless in&nbsp;reality as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font0"> and the magistracies. The senators&nbsp;continued indeed to be taken as a rule from the ranks of the&nbsp;wealthy, and a high property qualification was established&nbsp;by Augustus as a condition of membership; but this merely&nbsp;enabled the emperors to secure their own ascendancy by subsidizing those whose property fell short of the required standard,&nbsp;and who thus became simply the paid creatures of their imperial&nbsp;patrons.@@<sup>11</sup> Admission to the senate was possible only by favour&nbsp;of the emperor, both as controlling the elections to the magistracies, which still gave entrance to the curia, and as invested&nbsp;with the power of directly creating senators by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">adlectio,</span><span class="font0"> a power&nbsp;which from the time of Vespasian onwards was freely used.@@<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>As the result, the composition of the senate rapidly altered.&nbsp;Under Augustus and Tiberius it still contained many representatives of the old republican families, whose prestige and&nbsp;ancestral traditions were some guarantee for their independence.&nbsp;But this element soon disappeared. The ranks of the old&nbsp;nobility were thinned by natural decay and by the jealous fears&nbsp;of the last three Claudian emperors. Vespasian@@<sup>13</sup> flooded the&nbsp;senate with new men from the municipal towns of Italy and&nbsp;the Latinized provinces of the West. Trajan and Hadrian, both&nbsp;provincials themselves, carried on the same policy, and by&nbsp;the close of the 2nd century even the Greek provinces of the&nbsp;East had their representatives in the senate. Some, no doubt,&nbsp;of these provincials, who constituted the great majority of the&nbsp;senate in the 3rd century, were men of wealth and mark, but&nbsp;many more were of low birth, on some rested the stain of a&nbsp;servile descent, and all owed alike their present position and&nbsp;their chances of further promotion to the emperor.@@<sup>14</sup> The procedure of the senate was as completely at the mercy of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font0"> as its composition. He was himself a senator and&nbsp;the first of senators;@@<sup>15</sup> he possessed the magisterial prerogatives&nbsp;of convening the senate, of laying business before it, and of&nbsp;carrying </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">senatus consult a;@@<sup>16</sup></span><span class="font0"> above all, his tribunician power&nbsp;enabled him to interfere at any stage, and to modify or reverse&nbsp;its decisions. The share of the senate in the government was&nbsp;in fact determined by the amount of administrative activity&nbsp;which each </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">princeps</span><span class="font0"> saw fit to allow it to exercise, and this&nbsp;share became steadily smaller. The jurisdiction assigned it&nbsp;by Augustus and Tiberius was in the 3rd century limited to&nbsp;the hearing of such cases as the emperor thought fit to send&nbsp;for trial, and these became steadily fewer in number. Its&nbsp;control </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font0"> the state treasury, as distinct from the imperial&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fiscus,</span><span class="font0"> was in fact little more than nominal, and became increas-inslv unimportant as the great bulk of the revenue passed</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
