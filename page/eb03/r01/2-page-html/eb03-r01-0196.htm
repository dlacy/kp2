<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">not to he fitting at </span><span class="font1">the time, he was </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">bound to let the enemy advance without oppoſition till he had convened&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">his orators, diſpcrſed over </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">24,000 ſquare leagues, and&nbsp;liſtened to their metaphyſical quibbles in Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the 19th June, a very ſingular farce was acted in the Aſſembly. A Pruſſian refugee, who called himſelf Anacharſis Clouts, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">who </span><span class="font1">was ſtruggling hard </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">bring himſelf into public notice, on an evening fitting&nbsp;(which, it is to be obſerved, was generally ill attended&nbsp;by the perfons of the higheſt rank), introduced to the&nbsp;Aſſembly a number of perſons dreffed in the different&nbsp;habits of all the different .countries that could he thought&nbsp;of. In a formal harangue, he told the Aſſembly that&nbsp;lie was come, as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">orator oſ the human race,</span><span class="font1"> at the&nbsp;head of the reprefentatives of all nations, to congratulate them upon the formation ©f their new conſtitution.&nbsp;He was anſwered by the Preſident with abundance of&nbsp;ſolemnity, and retired with his motley groupe. This&nbsp;fantaſtical piece of folly, which in any other country&nbsp;than France would ſcarcely, perhaps, have excited a&nbsp;ſmile, was treated by the Aſſembly in a ferions light.&nbsp;Alexander Lameth propoſed, that the figures of different nations exhibited in chains at the feet of Louis&nbsp;XIV. ſhould be dellroyed as an inſult upon mankind.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">M. </span><span class="font1">Lamhel, a lawyer, at this moment propofed the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">abolition oſ all hereditary titles.</span><span class="font1"> He was iιιpported by&nbsp;La Fayette, St Fargeau, and the viſcount de Noailles.&nbsp;The decree was paffed, along with another ſuppreſſing&nbsp;all armorial bearings. It is our intention at preſent rather to ſtate facts than to hazard any political opinion&nbsp;concerning the wiſdom or folly of the tranſactions which&nbsp;we record. It may here, however, be remarked, that&nbsp;no part of the proceedings of the French National Aſſembly was received by perſons of rank upon the Continent of Europe with ſo much indignation as this.—&nbsp;'I'he feudal ſyſtem had been overturned, and the property of the church wreſted from it, with little comparative notice ; but when thoſe nominal diſtinctions&nbsp;were attacked which antiquity had ſanctioned, and perſonal vanity rendered dear, the ſurrounding nations were&nbsp;inſtantly alarmed, and beheld with terror the levelling&nbsp;precedent, we may likewiſe add, that no part of&nbsp;their proceedings was more inimical to rational and practical freedom. To preferve a perfect equality of ranks&nbsp;is impoffible. In a commercial nation, induſtry will&nbsp;procure wealth, and wealth will every where procure&nbsp;dependents. Now nothing more contributes to keep&nbsp;within ſome tolerable bounds the inſolence of newly&nbsp;acquired wealth, than the rank attached to birth and nobility, which time and prejudice have conſpired to make&nbsp;reſpectable. It is not a little remarkable, that of all the&nbsp;King’s miniſters, Neckar alone, a plebeian, a republican, born and bred in a democracy, adviſed his Majeſty&nbsp;to refuſe his affent to this fooliih decree, as a violent&nbsp;but uſeleſs encroachment upon the prejudices of a&nbsp;powerful order of the ſtate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, the capital was entirely engroſſed by hurry and buſtle. M. Bailly had propoſed a plan&nbsp;for commemorating the anniverſary of the taking of&nbsp;the Baſtile. It was adopted, becaufe it flattered the&nbsp;vanity of the people, by preſenting them with a fplendid fpectacle in commemoration of their own exertions.&nbsp;—The army had been much diſorganized ; and it was&nbsp;reſolved to attempt to unite all its branches, as well as&nbsp;She whole departments of the ſtatc, ia onc common at-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">tachment to </span><span class="font1">the new order of things, by collecting </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">into </span><span class="font1">one place deputations, for the purpoſe of ſwearing· fidelity to the new conſtſtution. In the middle of the&nbsp;Champ de Mars an altar was erected, at which the civic oath, as it was called, was to be taken. Around&nbsp;the akar an amphitheatre was thrown </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font1">capable of containing </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">400,000 </span><span class="font1">ſpectators; </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2000 </span><span class="font1">workmen were employed in this operation ; and the people of Paris, fear</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ing </span><span class="font1">left die plan might not be completed, affiiſted </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the labour. All ranks of perſons, thc nobles, clergy,&nbsp;and even ladies, with the eagerneſs for novelty ſo pe-culiar to that people, united their efforts. Crowds of&nbsp;foreigners as well as natives hurried to the capital to be&nbsp;preſent at this ſolemnſty, which was called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Confederation.</span><span class="font1"> The long-expected 14th of July at length arrived. At fix o’clock in the morning the prυceffion&nbsp;was aπanged on the Boulevards, and conſiſted of the&nbsp;electors of the city of Paris, the reprefentatives of the&nbsp;commons, the adminiſtrators of the municipality, a bat-talion of children, with </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">ſtandard, infcribed &quot; The&nbsp;hopes -of the nation deputies from the troops of&nbsp;France wherever quartered, and of every order, along&nbsp;with deputies from all the departments ; to theſe were&nbsp;added immenfe detachments of the military, and of the&nbsp;na<sup>t</sup>ional guards, along with an almoſt infinite multitude&nbsp;oſ drums, trumpets, and muſical inſtruments. The pro-ceffion was extremely fplendid, as every diſtrict had its&nbsp;peculiar decorations. The national affembly paffed&nbsp;through a grand triumphal arch, and the king and&nbsp;queen, attended by the foreign miniſters, were placed&nbsp;in a ſuperb box. After a ſolemn invocation to God,&nbsp;the King approached the altar, and, amidſt the deepeſt&nbsp;ſilence, took the following oath : &quot; I the King of the&nbsp;French do ſwear to the nation, that I will employ the&nbsp;whole power delegated to me by the conſtitutional law&nbsp;of the ſtate, to maintain the conſtitution, and enforce&nbsp;the execution of the law.” The preſident of the national affembly then went up to the altar, and took the&nbsp;civic oath, “ I ſwear to be faithful to the nation, the&nbsp;law, and the king ; and to maintain with all my powers&nbsp;the conſtitution decreed by the national affembly, and&nbsp;accepted by the king.” Every member of the affembly&nbsp;handing up, ſaid, “ That I fwear.” La Fayette then&nbsp;advancing, took the oath for himfclf ; the other deputies of the national guards pronouncing after him,&nbsp;&quot; That I ſwear and theſe words were ſolemnly pronounced byevery individual of this immenfe affembly. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Te&nbsp;Deum</span><span class="font1"> was then fung. The performance was ſublime&nbsp;beyond the powers of defcriptiυn. Never perhaps be-fore was there hιch an orcheſtra, or ſuch an audience :&nbsp;their numbers baffled the eye to reckon, and their ſhouts&nbsp;in full chorus rent the ſkies. It is impoffible to enumerate ail the means which were employed to add fpleh-dυr to this day. It ended with a general illumination,&nbsp;and no accident diſturbed the public tranquillity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The aſſembly now proceeded in the formation of the conſtitution with conſiderable tranquillity; which, however, was diſturbed by au unhappy event at Nancy.&nbsp;Moil of the officers of the army were unfriendly to&nbsp;the late revolution, and every means had been employed&nbsp;by them to difguſt the loldiers with it. At Nancy.,&nbsp;in particular, neceffaries had been &lt;lenied them, and their&nbsp;pay was kept back, under pretence that this was the&nbsp;will of thc national aſſembly. Driven to deſpair, the&nbsp;regiments in garrifon threw off their allegiance, and de-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
