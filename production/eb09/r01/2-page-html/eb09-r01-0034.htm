<p><span class="font1">the same may be said in regard to low-lying marshy meadows, in most of which it is in season always to be&nbsp;heard, while in others having a close resemblance to them&nbsp;it is never met with. The nest is on the ground, generally&nbsp;in long grass, and therein from nine to eleven eggs are&nbsp;commonly laid. These are of a cream-colour, spotted and&nbsp;blotched with light red and grey. The young when&nbsp;hatched are thickly clothed with black down, as is the case&nbsp;in nearly all species of the Family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Water-Rail,</span><span class="font1"> locally known as the Skiddy or Bill-cock, is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ballus aquaticus</span><span class="font1"> of Ornithology, and seems to be less abundant than the preceding, though that is in&nbsp;some measure due to its frequenting places into which from&nbsp;their swampy nature men do not often intrude. Having&nbsp;a general resemblance to the Land-Rail,@@<sup>1</sup> it can be in a&nbsp;moment distinguished by its partly red and much longer&nbsp;bill, and the darker coloration of its plumage—the upper&nbsp;parts being of an olive brown with black streaks, the&nbsp;breast and belly of a sooty grey, and the flanks dull black&nbsp;barred with white. Its geographical distribution is very&nbsp;wide, extending from Iceland (where it is said to preserve&nbsp;its existence during winter by resorting to the hot springs)&nbsp;to China; and though it inhabits Northern India, Lower&nbsp;Egypt, and Barbary, it seems not to pass beyond the tropical&nbsp;line. It never affects upland districts as does the Land-Rail, but always haunts wet marshes or the close vicinity&nbsp;of water. Its love-note is a loud and harsh cry, not continually repeated as is that of the Land-Rail, but uttered&nbsp;at considerable intervals and so suddenly as to have been&nbsp;termed “explosive.” Besides this, which is peculiar to&nbsp;the cock-bird, it has a croaking call that is frog-like. The&nbsp;eggs resemble those of the preceding, but are more&nbsp;brightly and delicately tinted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The various species of Rails, whether allied to the former or latter of those just mentioned, are far too numerous to be here noticed.&nbsp;Hardly any part of the world is without a representative of the&nbsp;genera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crex</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rallus,</span><span class="font0"> and every considerable country has one or&nbsp;perhaps more of each—though it has been the habit of systematists&nbsp;to refer them to many other genera, the characters of which are&nbsp;with difficulty found. Thus in Europe alone three other species&nbsp;allied to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crex pratensis</span><span class="font0"> occur more or less abundantly ; but one of&nbsp;them, the Spotted Rail or Crake, has been made the type of a so-called genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Porzana,</span><span class="font0"> and the other two, little birds not much&nbsp;bigger than Larks, are considered to form a genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zctpornia.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;first of these, which used not to be uncommon in the eastern part&nbsp;of England, has a very near representative in the Carolina Rail or&nbsp;Sora, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crex Carolina, of</span><span class="font0"> North America, often there miscalled the&nbsp;Ortolan, just as its European analogue, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. porzana,</span><span class="font0"> is in England&nbsp;often termed the Dotterel. But, passing over these as well as&nbsp;some belonging to genera that can be much better defined, and&nbsp;other still more interesting forms of the Family, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aphanapteryx&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Birds, vol. iii. p. 733), Coot (vol. vi. p. 341), Moor-Hen (vol.&nbsp;xvi. p. 808), and Ocydrome (vol. xvii. p. 722), a few words must&nbsp;be said of the more distant group formed by the South-American&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hcliornis,</span><span class="font0"> and the African and Indian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Podica,</span><span class="font0"> comprising four or&nbsp;five species, to which the name ‘ ‘ Finfoots ” has been applied —&nbsp;from the lobes or flaps of skin that fringe their toes. Though for a&nbsp;long while placed among the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poclicipcdidie </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Grebe, vol. xi. p. 79),&nbsp;their osteology no less than their habits appear to indicate their&nbsp;alliance with the Rails, if they be not members of the Family&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ralliclae</span><span class="font0">; but they seem to shew the extreme modification of that&nbsp;type in adaptation to aquatic life. Then again the curious genus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mesites</span><span class="font0"> of Madagascar, whose systematic place has been so long in&nbsp;doubt, has been referred by Prof. Alph. Milne-Edwards (rt?i?i. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sc.&nbsp;Naturclle,</span><span class="font0"> ser. 6, vii. art. 2) to the neighbourhood of the Rails,&nbsp;though offering some points of resemblance to the Herons. On&nbsp;the other hand the Jacanas (vol. xiii. p. 531) or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Parridse,</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;from their long toes were once thought to belong to the Rails, are&nbsp;now generally admitted to be Limicoline, while the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aramus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">—the Courlan or Limpkin of the Southern United States—still&nbsp;occupies a very undetermined position. On the whole the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rallidae&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">constitute a group of birds which, particularly as regards their&nbsp;relations to some other remarkable forms, of which the Sun-Bittern,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eurypyga,</span><span class="font0"> and Kagu, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhinochetus,</span><span class="font0"> may especially be named, well&nbsp;deserve greater attention from the systematist, and any ornithologist in want of a subject could hardly find one more likely to&nbsp;reward his labours if he were only to carry them out in a judicious&nbsp;way. Based on the safe ground of anatomy, but due regard being&nbsp;also had to the external characters, habits, and other peculiarities&nbsp;of this multifarious group, a monograph might be produced of surpassing interest, and one that in its bearings on the doctrine of&nbsp;evolution would be likely to prove a telling record.

<p><span class="font3">R</span><span class="font1">AILWAYS had their origin in the tramways which were laid more than two hundred years ago in the&nbsp;mineral districts of England for the conveyance of coal to&nbsp;the sea. In those days, before Macadam, roads bearing&nbsp;heavy traffic were with difficulty kept in repair. This led&nbsp;to the plan of laying planks or timbers at the bottom of&nbsp;the ruts as a better contrivance than filling in with stones,&nbsp;and then to laying rails of timber on the level surface. In&nbsp;1676 tramways consisted of rails of timber laid “from the&nbsp;colliery to the river, exactly straight and parallel, and bulky&nbsp;carts were made with four rollers fitting the rails, whereby&nbsp;the carriage was so easy that one horse would draw down&nbsp;four or five chaldron of coals.” The rails originally were&nbsp;formed of scantlings of good sound oak, and were connected by sills or cross timbers of the same material pinned&nbsp;together with oak trenails. By and by an additional or&nbsp;wearing rail, which could be easily renewed when worn, was&nbsp;placed above the supporting rail, and it was then possible&nbsp;to cover the cross pieces or sleepers with earth to protect&nbsp;them from the horses’ feet. These ways, laid by permission of local proprietors, were called “way-leaves.” It&nbsp;became a common practice to nail down bars of wrought&nbsp;iron on the surfaces of the ascending inclines of the road.&nbsp;These bars or rails were about 2 inches wide and half an&nbsp;inch thick, and were fastened to the wood rails by countersunk spikes. But the iron bars, not being stiff enough,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">were considerably bent when the trucks were loaded, and the resistance was reduced but slightly below that of a&nbsp;well-constructed double wooden tramway.@@<sup>2</sup> Nevertheless,&nbsp;while the regular load of coals for one horse on the common&nbsp;road was but 17 cwt., on the tramway the horse could&nbsp;regularly take a load of 42 cwt. Cast-iron was first tried&nbsp;incidentally as a material for</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rails in 1767 by the Coal-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">brookdale Iron Company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The iron rails were cast in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">lengths of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">5</span><span class="font1"> feet, 4 inches</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">wide, and 1^ inches thick,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">formed with three holes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">through which they were</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">fastened to the oak rails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tramway was developed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">into the railway by the em</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ployment of cast-iron flange</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rails (fig. 1) to replace the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">wooden rails ; the continuous</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">flange or ledge on their inner</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">edge kept the wheels on the track. The roads were then called tram-roads, probably as an abbreviation of&nbsp;trammel-roads, the flanges of the rails being in reality&nbsp;trammels to gauge the road and confine the wheels to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> Formerly it seems to have been a popular belief in England that the Land-Rail in autumn transformed itself into a Water-Rail, resuming&nbsp;its own characters in spring. The writer has met with several persons&nbsp;who had serious doubts on the subject!</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> The earliest system of way on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and other railroads in the United States was a simple reproduction of&nbsp;this compound of wood and iron. As the ends of the bars became loose&nbsp;and turned upwards they were known as “suakes’ heads.” Occasionally they pierced the floors of the carriages and injured passengers.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
