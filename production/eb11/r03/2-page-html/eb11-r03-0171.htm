<p><span class="font0">dependent on its maritime trade, especially its exports to Constantinople. It is the administrative centre of a district&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(sanjak)</span><span class="font0"> producing and exporting barley, oats, spelt and canary&nbsp;seed, and largely planted with mulberry trees, on which silkworms are fed. White cocoons are exported to western Europe&nbsp;(394 cwt. in 1901), silkworms* eggs to Russia and Persia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rodosto is the ancient </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhaedestus</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bisanthe,</span><span class="font0"> said to have been founded by Samians, ln Xenophon’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anabasis</span><span class="font0"> it is mentioned as&nbsp;in the kingdom of the Thracian prince Seuthes. Its restoration&nbsp;by Justinian in the 6th century a.d. is chronicled by Procopius.&nbsp;In 813 and again in 1206 it was sacked by the Bulgarians, but it&nbsp;continues to appear as a place of considerable note in later&nbsp;Byzantine history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RODRIGUEZ (officially </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rodrigues),</span><span class="font0"> an island in the Indian Ocean in 19° 41' S., 63° 23' E.; the most important dependency&nbsp;of the British colony of Mauritius, from which it is distant 344&nbsp;nautical miles. It is a station on the “ all-British ” cable route&nbsp;between South Africa and Australia, telegraphic communication&nbsp;with Mauritius being established in 1902. With a length of&nbsp;13 m. E. and W., and a breadth of 3 to 6 m. N. and S., it has an&nbsp;area estimated at 42 j sq. m. On all sides it is surrounded by a&nbsp;fringing reef of coral, studded with islets. This reef, only 100&nbsp;yds. wide at the eastern end of the island, extends westward&nbsp;3 m., and both N. and S. forms a flat area partly dry&nbsp;at low water. Two passages through the reef are available&nbsp;for large vessels—these leading respectively to-Port Mathurin&nbsp;on the N. coast and to Port South-East.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The island was at one period believed to consist of granite overlaid with limestone and other modern formations, and its supposed formation caused it to be regarded as a remnant of the hypothetical&nbsp;continent of Lemuria. The investigations made by an expedition&nbsp;sent by the British government in 1874 showed, however, that the&nbsp;island is a mass of volcanic rock, mainly a doleritic lava, rich in&nbsp;olivine. The land consists largely of a series of hills. The main&nbsp;ridge, which runs parallel to the longest diameter, rises abruptly&nbsp;on the east, more gradually on the west, where there is a wide plain&nbsp;of coralline limestone, studded with caves, some Stalactitic. Of&nbsp;several peaks on the main ridge the highest is Mt. Limon, 1300 ft.&nbsp;above the sea. The ridge is deeply cut by ravines, the upper parts&nbsp;of which show successive belts of lava separated by thin beds of&nbsp;cinders, agglomerate and coloured clays. In places the cliffs rise&nbsp;300 ft. and exhibit twelve distinct lava flows. The climate is like&nbsp;thatof Mauritius, but Rodriguez is more subject than Mauritius to&nbsp;hurricanes during the north-west monsoon (November to April).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Flora and Fauna.—</span><span class="font0">When discovered, and down into the 17th century, Rodriguez was clothed with fine timber trees; but goats,&nbsp;cattle and bush-fires have combined to destroy the great bulk of&nbsp;the old vegetation, and the indigenous plants have in many cases&nbsp;been ousted by intrusive foreigners. Parts are, however, still&nbsp;well wooded, and elsewhere there is excellent pasturage. The&nbsp;sweet potato, manioc, maize, millet., the sugar-cane, cotton,&nbsp;coffee and rice grow well. Tobacco is also cultivated. Wheat&nbsp;is seldom seen, mainly because of the parakeets and the Java&nbsp;sparrows. Beans </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Phaseolus lunatus),</span><span class="font0"> lentils, gram ( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cicer arietinum),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">dholl </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Cajanus indiens)</span><span class="font0"> and ground-nuts arc all grown to a certain&nbsp;extent in spite of ravages by rats. Mangoes, bananas, guavas, pineapples, custard-apples, and especially oranges, citrons and limes&nbsp;flourish. Of the timber trees the most common are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Blaeodendron&nbsp;orientale,</span><span class="font0"> much used in carpentry and for pirouges, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Latania&nbsp;Verschaffelti</span><span class="font0"> (Leguat’s planta ne). At least two species of screw-pine&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pandanus heterocarpus,</span><span class="font0"> Balf. fit, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">P. tenuifolius)</span><span class="font0"> occur freely&nbsp;throughout the island. The total number of known species, according to Professor I. B. Balfour, is 470, belonging to 85 families and&nbsp;293 genera. The families represented by the greatest number of&nbsp;species are Gramineae, Leguminosae, Convolyulaceae, Malvaceae,&nbsp;Rubiaceae, Cyperaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Liliaceae, Compositae.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mathurina Penduliflora</span><span class="font0"> (Turneraceae) is interesting, as its nearest&nbsp;congener is in Central America. Of 33 species of mosses 17 are&nbsp;peculiar. Variability of species and heterophylly are characteristic&nbsp;of the flora to quite an unusual degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At present the only indigenous mammal, is a species of. fruiteating bat </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pteropus rodericensis),</span><span class="font0"> and the introduced species are familiar creatures as deer, pig, rabbit, rat, mouse, &amp;c.; but down&nbsp;to a recent period the island was the home of a very large land-tortoise </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Testudo Vosmaeri</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rodericensis),</span><span class="font0"> and its limestone caves&nbsp;have yielded a large number of skeletons of the dodo-like solitaire&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pezophaps solitarius),</span><span class="font0"> which still built its mound-like nest in the&nbsp;island in the close of the 17th century, but is now extinct (see Dodo).&nbsp;Deer, once plentiful, had become very scarce by the beginning of&nbsp;the 20th century, having been indiscriminately hunted by the&nbsp;inhabitants. Of indigenous birds 13 species have been registered.&nbsp;The guinea-fowl (introduced) has become exceedingly abundant,&nbsp;partly owing to a protective game-law;, and a · francolin (F.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ponticerianns).</span><span class="font0"> popularly a “ partridge,” is also common. The&nbsp;marine fish-fauna docs not differ from that of Mauritius, and the&nbsp;freshwater species, with the exception of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mugil rodericensis</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Myxus caecuticus,</span><span class="font0"> are common to all the Mascarenes. Thirty-five&nbsp;species of crustaceans are known. The insects (probably very&nbsp;imperfectly registered) comprise 60 species of Coleoptcra, 15 Hymen&nbsp;optera, 21 Lepidoptera, 15 Orthoptera, and 20 Hcmiptera. Forty-nine species of coral have been collected, showing a close affinity&nbsp;to those of Mauritius, Madagascar and the Seychelles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font0">Rodriguez or Diego Ruy’s Island was discovered by the Portuguese in 1645. In 1690 Duquesne prevailed on the&nbsp;Dutch Government to send a body of French Huguenots to the&nbsp;Island of Bourbon, at that time, he believed, abandoned by the&nbsp;French authorities. As the refugees, however, found the French&nbsp;in possession, they proceeded to Rodriguez, and there eight of&nbsp;their number were landed on the 30th of April 1691 with a&nbsp;promise that they should be visited by their compatriots within&nbsp;two years. The two years were spent without misadventure,&nbsp;but, instead of waiting for the arrival of their friends, the seven&nbsp;colonists (for one had meanwhile died) left the isjand on the&nbsp;8th of May 1693 and made their way to Mauritius, where they&nbsp;were treated with great cruelty by the governor. The account&nbsp;of the enterprise by Francis Leguat—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Voyages et aventures&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(London, 1708), or, as it is called in the English translation, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;New Voyage to the East Indies</span><span class="font0"> (London, 1708)—is a garrulous&nbsp;and amusing narrative, and was for a long time almost the only&nbsp;source of information about Rodriguez. His description of the&nbsp;solitaire is unique.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the Dutch the island passed to the French, who colonized it from Mauritius. Large estates were cultivated, and the islanders enjoyed considerable prosperity. In 1809-10 Rodriguez was seized by the British, in whose possession it has since&nbsp;remained. The abolition of slavery proved disastrous to the&nbsp;prosperity of the island, and in 1843 the population had sunk to&nbsp;about 250. Since that time there has been a gradual recovery&nbsp;in the economic condition and a steady increase in population.&nbsp;In 1881 the inhabitants numbered 1436; in 1904 the total had&nbsp;risen to 3681. In 1907 the total population was 4231. The&nbsp;inhabitants are mainly of African origin, being descendants of&nbsp;slaves introduced by the French and negro immigrants direct&nbsp;from Africa. There are a few families of European descent&nbsp;(besides the comparatively large staff maintained by the Eastern&nbsp;Telegraph Company) and a small colony of Indians and Chinese.&nbsp;The bulk of the people are French-speaking and Roman&nbsp;Catholics. There are two small settlements, Port Mathurin,&nbsp;the capital, and Gabriel, in the centre of the island. The chief&nbsp;industries are fisheries and cattle-rearing. Salt fish is the&nbsp;principal export, next in importance coming goats, pigs and&nbsp;horned cattle and tobacco. The value of the exports for the&nbsp;four years 1903-06 was £50,894; of the imports for the same&nbsp;period, £54,710. The island is administered by a magistrate&nbsp;appointed by the governor of Mauritius, and the laws are&nbsp;regulations issued by the governor in executive council. The&nbsp;revenue, some £1000 a year, is about half the expenditure incurred, the balance being furnished from the Mauritian treasury.&nbsp;The government maintains a hospital and schools, and pays the&nbsp;salary of a Roman Catholic priest.</span></p>
