is a Saxon word signifying a division; but a county, <hi rend="italic">comitatus,</hi> of the same import, is plainly derived from <hi rend="italic">comes,</hi> the count of the Franks ; that is, the earl or al- derman, as the Saxons called him, of the shire, to whom the government of it was intrusted. This he usually exercised by his deputy, still called in Latin <hi rend="italic">vi</hi> c <hi rend="italic">e comes,</hi> and in English the sheriff, shrieve, or shire-reeve, signifying the officer of the shire ; upon whom, in process of time, the civil administration of it totally devolved. In some coun- ties there is an intermediate division between the shire and the hundred ; as lathes in Kent and rapes in Sussex, each of them containing about three or four hundred a piece. These had formerly their lathe-reeves and rape-reeves, acting in subordination to the shire-reeve. Where a county is divided into three of these intermediate jurisdictions, they are called trythings, which were anciently governed by a trything-reeve. These trythings still subsist in the large county of York, w here, by an easy corruption, they are denominated <hi rend="italic">ridings ;</hi> namely, the north, the east, and the west ridings.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
