<p><span class="font1">amplified by succeeding sovereigns. The governing charter until 1835 was that of Charles I. (1639) incorporating the town&nbsp;under the title of the mayor, aldermen and burgesses. Reading&nbsp;returned two members to parliament from 1295 to 1885, when it&nbsp;was deprived of one; until 1832 the Scot-and-Lot franchise&nbsp;was used. The town surrendered to the parliamentary troops,&nbsp;after a siege, in 1643; it was occupied subsequently by the&nbsp;forces of both parties: in 1688 a skirmish took place in the&nbsp;town between some Irish soldiers of James II. and the troops of&nbsp;William of Orange. The market, chiefly held on Saturday, can&nbsp;be traced to the reign of Henry III.; four fairs granted by the&nbsp;charter of 1562 are still held, that on the 25th of July dating&nbsp;originally from a grant of Henry II. to Reading abbey.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">READING, a city and the county-seat of Berks county, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., in the S.E. part of the state, on the&nbsp;E. bank of the Schuylkill river, and about 58 m. N.W.&nbsp;of Philadelphia. Pop. (1880) 43,278; (1890) 58,661; (1900)&nbsp;78,961, of whom 5940 were foreign-born; (1910, census) 96,071.&nbsp;Reading is served by the Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia&nbsp;&amp; Reading railways, by the Schuylkill Canal, which carries&nbsp;freight to Philadelphia, and by electric railways to several&nbsp;villages in Berks county. The city occupies an irregular&nbsp;tract of land gradually descending from the base of Mt. Penn&nbsp;westward to the Schuylkill river, anà therefore possesses&nbsp;excellent drainage facilities. The river, which is unnavigable&nbsp;and winding at this point, forms the western boundary of the&nbsp;city for more than 4 m., and is spanned by three public bridges&nbsp;and a number of railway bridges. Neversink Mountain (878 ft.&nbsp;high), lying to the S. of the city, and Mt. Penn (800 ft.), are&nbsp;pleasure resorts in the neighbourhood. On the neighbouring&nbsp;mountains are several summer hotels and sanatoria. Within&nbsp;the city is Penn Common, containing 50 acres, reserved by the&nbsp;Penns for the use of the town when it was first laid out, and&nbsp;since 1878 used as a public park. Mineral Spring Park, containing 63 acres, lies on the outskirts of the city. Other parks&nbsp;are maintained by the street railway companies. In Penn&nbsp;Common are a monument erected to the “First Defenders,”&nbsp;to commemorate the fact that the “Ringgold Light Infantry,&quot; the first volunteer company to report at Washington for&nbsp;service in the Civil War, came from this city; a monument to President McKinley, and one to the volunteer fire&nbsp;companies of the city. Among interesting landmarks are&nbsp;the Federal Inn (1763), in which President Washington was&nbsp;entertained in 1794, and which has been used as a banking&nbsp;house since 1814; the old county gaol (1770), used as such&nbsp;until 1848; and the site of the “ Hessian Camp,” where some&nbsp;of the prisoners captured during the War of Independence&nbsp;were confined. Charitable institutions are numerous; among&nbsp;them are the Reading Hospital (1867), St Joseph’s Hospital&nbsp;(1873), Homoeopathic Hospital (1891), the Home for Widows&nbsp;and Single Women (1875), the Hope Rescue Mission (1897) for&nbsp;homeless men, the Home for Friendless Children (1888), St&nbsp;Catharine’s Female Orphan Asylum (1872), St Paul’s Orphan&nbsp;Asylum for Boys, and the House of the Good Shepherd (1889).&nbsp;Other institutions: are the public library, which from 1808 to&nbsp;r898 was a subscription library; the Berks County Law&nbsp;Library; the Berks County Historical Society; and the&nbsp;Harmonie Maennerchor, organized in 1847 and one of the&nbsp;oldest singing societies in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lying within the rich agricultural region of the Lebanon and Schuylkill valleys and near vast fields of anthracite coal and&nbsp;iron ore, Reading possesses unusual business and industrial&nbsp;advantages. The chief industry is the manufacture of iron&nbsp;and steel. There are large shops of the Philadelphia &amp;&nbsp;Reading railway here. The total value of factory products in&nbsp;1905 was $30,848,175 (in 1900 it had been $32,682,061), and&nbsp;the most important of these were the products of steel-works&nbsp;and rolling-mills; the products of railway repair shops;&nbsp;foundry and machine-shop products; hardware, hosiery and&nbsp;knitted goods; cigars and cigarettes, and felt hats. Other&nbsp;important manufactures are bicycles, brick and other clay&nbsp;products, brooms, brushes, and cotton and woollen goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reading was surveyed and laid out as a town in 1748, in accordance with the plans of Thomas and Richard Penn, sons&nbsp;of William Penn, and was named Reading after the county&nbsp;town of Berkshire, England. The first settlers were mostly&nbsp;Germans, but the direction of municipal affairs until the outbreak of the War of Independence was in the hands of the&nbsp;English-speaking inhabitants. As the latter were largely of&nbsp;Loyalist sympathies during the war, the control of the local&nbsp;government then fell into the hands of the German inhabitants.&nbsp;German was long used in Reading; Pennsylvania German (or&nbsp;“ Dutch ’’) is still spoken in the surrounding country; and&nbsp;several German periodicals are published in the city, including&nbsp;among them the weekly </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adler</span><span class="font1"> since 1796. During the War of&nbsp;Independence Reading was an inland depôt for supplies for&nbsp;the American army, and prisoners of war were sent here in&nbsp;large numbers. The development of the town dates from the&nbsp;opening in 1824 of the Schuylkill Canal, from Reading to&nbsp;Philadelphia. This was followed in 1828 by the Union Canal,&nbsp;running westward to Lebanon and Middletown, and in 1838&nbsp;by the entrance into Reading of the Philadelphia &amp; Reading&nbsp;railway. The establishment of these means of communication&nbsp;hastened the development of the natural resources of the&nbsp;region, and Reading early became an industrial centre. A&nbsp;system of water-works, established in 1821, was acquired by&nbsp;the municipality in 1865. Reading was incorporated as a&nbsp;borough in 1783, and was chartered as a city in 1847.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">READYMONEY, SIR COWASJI JEHANGIR (1812-1878), “ the Peabody of Bombay.’’ Early in the 18th century three&nbsp;Parsee brothers moved from Nowsari, near Surat, in Gujarat,&nbsp;to Bombay, and became the pioneers of a lucrative trade with&nbsp;China. They gained the sobriquet of “ Readymoney, ” which&nbsp;they adopted as a surname. Only Hirji Jewanji Readymoney&nbsp;left issue, two daughters, the elder of whom married a Banaji,&nbsp;and the younger a Dady Sett. The son of the former, Jehangir&nbsp;Hirji, married Mirbae, the daughter of the latter, and was&nbsp;made the heir not only of his grandfather, but of his two granduncles. The younger òf their two sons was Cowasji Jehangir.&nbsp;His only English education was at the then well-known school&nbsp;kept by Serjeant Sykes in the Fort of Bombay. At the age of&nbsp;15 he entered the firm of Duncan, Gibb &amp; Co. as “ godown&nbsp;keeper,” or warehouse clerk. In 1837 he was promoted to&nbsp;the responsible and lucrative appointment of “ guarantee&nbsp;broker ’’ to two of the leading European firms of Bombay. In&nbsp;1846 he was ahle to begin trading on his own account. He was&nbsp;made a J.P. for the town and island of Bombay, and a member&nbsp;of the board of conservancy; and in 1866 was appointed a&nbsp;commissioner of income tax, his tactful management being&nbsp;largely responsible for the fact that this tax, then new to Bombay&nbsp;and unpopular, was levied with unexpected financial success.&nbsp;He was made C.S.I. in 1871; and in 1872 he was created a&nbsp;Knight Bachelor of the United Kingdom, and his statue, by&nbsp;T. Woolner, R. A., was erected in the town hall. His donations&nbsp;to the institutions of Bombay amounted to close on £200,000.&nbsp;His health broke down in 1871, and he died in 1878, being&nbsp;succeeded by his son, Sir J. Cowasji Jehangir [Readymoney],&nbsp;who was created a Knight Bachelor in 1895, and a Baronet in&nbsp;1908.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">See J.
