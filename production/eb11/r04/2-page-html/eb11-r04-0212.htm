<p><span class="font2">ROS, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">De Ros,</span><span class="font2"> the name of a noble English family. Robert de Ros (d. 1227), a son of Everard de Ros (d. 1191) of Helmsley,&nbsp;or Hamlake, in Yorkshire, possessed lands in Yorkshire, including Ros, or Ross, in Holdemess, and also in Normandy.&nbsp;He served King John in several ways, both in England and&nbsp;abroad, and obtained lands in Northumberland, where he&nbsp;built a castle at Wark, or Werke. About 1215, however, he&nbsp;deserted the king and became one of the leaders of the baronial&nbsp;party, being one of the twenty-five executors of Magna Carta&nbsp;and fighting against John when he repudiated this engagement.&nbsp;He submitted to Henry III. and became a monk before he died&nbsp;in 1227. His wife was Isabella, daughter of William the Lion,&nbsp;king of Scotland, by whom he had two sons, William and&nbsp;Robert. Robert de Ros the younger (d. 1274), was an itinerant&nbsp;justice under Henry III., but later he was one of the barons&nbsp;who fought against this king. He passed much of his time,&nbsp;however, in Scotland, where he held a barony and where he&nbsp;was one of the guardians of Margaret, the English bride of&nbsp;King Alexander III. His son Robert was summoned to parliament as Lord Ros de Werke in 1295; just afterwards he revolted&nbsp;against Edward I. and his lands were forfeited. William de&nbsp;Ros (d. 1258), the elder son of the executor of Magna Carta,&nbsp;had a son Robert (d. 1285), who was summoned to parliament&nbsp;as a baron by Simon de Montfort in 1264; he was also summoned&nbsp;to parliament by Edward I. His son William, 2nd baron&nbsp;Ros of Helmsley, or Hamlake (d. 1317), obtained Belvoir Castle&nbsp;in Leicestershire through his mother Isabel, daughter of William&nbsp;d’Albini. He was one of the minor claimants for the crown of&nbsp;Scotland in 1292, and soon afterwards he obtained the lands&nbsp;in Northumberland which had been taken from his traitorous&nbsp;cousin Robert de Ros. His second son, John de Ros (d. 1338),&nbsp;was a courtier under Edward II. Later he joined Edward’s&nbsp;queen, Isabella, was summoned to parliament by Edward III.,&nbsp;and distinguished himself on the sea. Another John de Ros&nbsp;(d. 1332), bishop of Carlisle from 1325 to 1332, was doubtless&nbsp;a member of this family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The second baron’s descendants retained the barony of Ros until the death of Edmund de Ros, the nth baron, in October&nbsp;1508. Edmund’s nephew Sir George Manners (d. 1513), of&nbsp;Belvoir and Helmsley, then claimed it, and was called Lord&nbsp;Ros, or Roos. His son, Thomas Manners, the 13th baron&nbsp;(d. 1543), was created earl of Rutland in 1525, but the barony&nbsp;was separated from the earldom when Thomas’s grandson&nbsp;Edward died in 1587, leaving an only child, Elizabeth (d. 1591),&nbsp;who, as heir general of the family, became Baroness Ros, or&nbsp;Roos. Elizabeth married into the Cecil family, and when her&nbsp;only child, William Cecil, died in 1618, the barony reverted&nbsp;to the Manners family, Francis Manners, 6th earl of Rutland&nbsp;(1578-1632), becoming the 18th baron. On his death the&nbsp;barony again passed to a female, his daughter Katherine,&nbsp;through whom it came to the family of Villiers. Then in 1806,&nbsp;after a long abeyance, Charlotte (1769-1831), daughter of the&nbsp;Hon. Robert Boyle, and a descendant of the Manners family,&nbsp;was declared Baroness Ros, or Roos. She married Lord Henry&nbsp;Fitzgerald, and their son, Henry William Fitzgerald-de-Ros&nbsp;(1793-1839), became the 22nd baron on his mother’s death.&nbsp;In 1907, on her father’s death, Mary Frances, wife of the Hon.&nbsp;Anthony Dawson, became Baroness Ros, or rather, De Ros,&nbsp;which is the present form of the title. For a long time after&nbsp;they had ceased to hold the barony the earls and dukes of&nbsp;Rutland continued to style themselves Lords Roos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROS, SIR RICHARD (b. 1429), English poet, son of Sir Thomas Ros, lord of Hamlake (Helmsley) in Yorkshire and of Belvoir&nbsp;in Leicestershire, was born on the 8th of March 1429. In&nbsp;Harl. MS. 372 the poem of “La Belle Dame sanz Mercy, ” first&nbsp;printed in W. Thynne’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chaucer</span><span class="font2"> (1532), has the ascription&nbsp;“ Translatid out of Frenche by Sir Richard Ros.” “ La Belle&nbsp;Dame sanz Mercy” is a long and rather dull poem from the French&nbsp;of Alain Chartier, and dates from about the middle of the&nbsp;15th century. It is written in the Midland dialect, and is&nbsp;surprisingly modern in diction. The opening lines—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; llalf in a dreme, not fully wel a waked,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The golden sleep me wrapped under his wing,”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">have often been quoted, but the dialogue between the very long-suffering lover and the cruel lady does not maintain this&nbsp;high level.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROSA, CARL AUGUST NICHOLAS (1843-1889), English musical impresario, was bom at Hamburg, his family name&nbsp;(which he subsequently changed) being Rose. He started as&nbsp;a solo violinist, studying at Leipzig and Paris, and also had&nbsp;considerable success as a conductor both in England and&nbsp;America; and it was at New York in 1867 that he met and&nbsp;married the famous operatic soprano Madame Parepa (1836-1874), at whose death he afterwards endowed a Parepa-Rosa&nbsp;scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music in London. In&nbsp;1875 he started the Carl Rosa Opera Company, for producing&nbsp;the best operas in English versions, and both during his own&nbsp;life and after bis death this company had much to do with&nbsp;popularizing good music in England, encouraging native composers and training a number of excellent singers. Carl Rosa&nbsp;married a second time in 1881, and died in Paris on the 30th&nbsp;of April 1889.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSA, MONTE, the name of a great glacier-clad mountain mass (the name comes from the Aostan patois word </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">roese,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">meaning a glacier) which rises S.E. of Zermatt, and on the&nbsp;frontier between Switzerland (canton of the Valais) and Italy.&nbsp;Ten summits in this huge mass are distinguished by name, of&nbsp;which four (the Nordend, 15,132 ft., the Zumsteinspitze, 15,004’&nbsp;ft., the Signalkuppe or Punta Gnifetti, 14,965 ft., and the&nbsp;Parrotspitze, 14,643 ft.) rise on the frontier. The five lower&nbsp;summits are on the Italian slope, but the highest of all, the&nbsp;Dufourspitze, 15,217 ft. (so named by the Swiss government&nbsp;in honour of General Dufour, the head of the great survey which&nbsp;first accurately fixed the position of these points), rises W. of&nbsp;the frontier ridge, on a buttress, and is thus entirely in Switzerland, of which it is the culminating peak (and not, as often&nbsp;stated, the Dorn, 14,942 ft., in the Mischabel group). The&nbsp;loftiest point of the Dufourspitze was first attained in 1855 by&nbsp;a large English party, which included Messrs G. and C. Smyth,&nbsp;C. Hudson, Birkbeck and Stevenson. The Zumsteinspitze&nbsp;was first climbed in r82o, the Signalkuppe (on top of which&nbsp;there is now a club hut) in 1842, the Nordend in 1861 and the&nbsp;Parrotspitze in 1863. The ascent of all the points named is not&nbsp;difficult from the Swiss side, but excessively dangerous on the&nbsp;east or Italian side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. A. B. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSA, SALVATOR (1615-1673), Italian painter of the Neapolitan school, was born in Arenella, in the outskirts of Naples, in 1615: the precise day is given as the 20th of June, and also&nbsp;as the 21st of July. His father, Vito Antonio de Rosa, a land&nbsp;surveyor, was bent upon making the youth a lawyer, or else a&nbsp;priest, and sent him to study in the convent of the Somaschi&nbsp;fathers. Here Salvator began showing a turn for art: he w<sup>r</sup>ent&nbsp;in secret to his maternal uncle Paolo Greco to learn the practice&nbsp;of painting, but soon found that Greco had little pictorial lore&nbsp;to impart, so he transferred himself to his own brother-in-law&nbsp;Francesco Fracanzaro, a pupil of Ribera, and afterwards had&nbsp;some practice under Ribera himself. Above all he went to&nbsp;nature, frequenting the Neapolitan coast, and keeping his eyes&nbsp;open and his hand busy. At the age </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">seventeen he lost his&nbsp;father; the widow was left unprovided for, with at least five&nbsp;children, and Salvator found himself immersed in a sea of&nbsp;troubles and perplexities, with nothing for the while to stem&nbsp;them except a buoyant and adventurous temperament. He&nbsp;obtained some instruction under the battle-painter Aniello&nbsp;Falcone, but chiefly painted in solitude, haunting romantic</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
