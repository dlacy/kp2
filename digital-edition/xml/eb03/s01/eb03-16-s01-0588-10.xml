(Andrea), a celebrated painter, born at Rome in 1594. He was the diſciple of Franciſco Albano, whom he afterwards ſurpaſſed in taſte and cor- rectness. He diſtinguiſhed himſelf in a very eminent degree by his paintings in freſco; and a ſtrong emulation ſubſiſting between him and Pietro de Cortona, they each arrived at a degree of perfection that neither of them might have known without ſuch a competition. The works of Sacchi have ſuch intrinfic merit, and are finiſhed with ſuch uncommon care and ſkill, as will always ſecure the applauſe of the judicious, and preſerve their true value. He died in 1668.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
