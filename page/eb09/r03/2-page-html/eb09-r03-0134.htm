                lig. 15). It consisted of a&nbsp;circular cella, surrounded by eighteen columns,
                with screens between them ; the circular podium, about 10 feet high, still

                (0&lt;Z., i. 2, 13) of the destruction of the temple&nbsp;by a Tiber flood caused
                the mistaken notion that the similar round&nbsp;temple still existing near the exit
                of the Cloaca Maxima was the&nbsp;Ædes Vestæ ; but the flood of 1877 showed that the
                waters of the&nbsp;river could still reach this point in the Forum. Its position
                near&nbsp;the temple of Castor is mentioned by Martial (i.

        <p><span class="font2">The Regia (see fig. 16), or residence of the pontifex maximus, was on

                Numa, and used as his dwelling-house ; it was</span></p>

                class="font2">c. by the Gauls, and was again burnt in 210 b.c. (Liv., xxvi. 27),
                when the temple of Vesta narrowly escaped. Julius&nbsp;Cæsar, as pontifex maximus,
                resided here ; and when Augustus&nbsp;succeeded to this office in 12 </span><span
                class="font1">B.c. </span><span class="font2">he gave the Regia to the
                vestals,&nbsp;having built himself a large house on the Palatine. When
                the&nbsp;Atrium Vestæ or house of the vestals was rebuilt on an enlarged&nbsp;scale
                the Regia was nulled down and its site partly occupied by</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">the new atrium. Ovid ( </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Trist.,</span><span class="font2"> iii. 1, 28) describes
                this end of the Forum thus—</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">“ Hæc est a sacris quæ via nomen habet,</span></p>

        <p><span class="font2">The excavations of the last few years have laid bare remains of this
                very interesting building, and show that it was a large house&nbsp;extending close
                up to the temple of Vesta,—0μoτotχos, as Dion&nbsp;Cassius (lvi. 27)
                    says.@@<sup>3</sup> It was set at a quite different angle from the&nbsp;Atrium
                and other later buildings which were built over its foundations ; this angle shows
                the original line of the Sacra Via, which in&nbsp;later tunes was diverted into a
                different direction. The existing&nbsp;remains are of several dates,—first, walls of
                soft tufa, part possibly&nbsp;of the earliest building ; second, walls of hard tufa,
                of rather&nbsp;later date ; and lastly, concrete walls faced with brick,
                decorated&nbsp;with painted stucco, and columns of travertine, also stuccoed
                    and&nbsp;painted,@@<sup>4</sup> witlι a large quantity of fine mosaic of that
                early sort&nbsp;which has very small tesseræ put together with great
                accuracy.&nbsp;This last part probably belongs to the rebuilding by
                Domitius&nbsp;Calvinus in 35 b.c. (Dion Cass., xliii. 42). These valuable
                remains&nbsp;were preserved in spite of the erection of later buildings over
                them&nbsp;because the levels of the later floors were higher than those of
                the&nbsp;Regia, and thus covered and protected the mosaics and lower parts&nbsp;of
                the walls and columns (see fig. 16). Besides being a dwelling-house, the Regia
                contained a sacrarium, in which were preserved&nbsp;the sacred spears of Mars (Aul.
                Gell., iv. 6), and also the shrine of&nbsp;the Dea Ops Consiva, only entered by the
                vestals and the sacerdos&nbsp;publicus (Varro, </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">KK,</span><span class="font2"> vi. 21).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The Atrium Vestæ or house of the vestals, like the temple, was many
                times burnt and rebuilt ; the existing building, which was&nbsp;excavated in
                1883-84, is of the time of Hadrian, as is shown by the&nbsp;brick stamps. It
                consists of a large atrium or quadrangle with&nbsp;columns of cipollino. At one end
                is the tablinum, with three&nbsp;small rooms on each side of it,—probably for the
                six vestals. A&nbsp;bathroom, bakehouse, servants’ offices, and some rooms lined
                with&nbsp;rich marbles extend along the south-west side. This
                extensive&nbsp;building is set against the side of the Palatine, which is cut
                away&nbsp;to admit the lower story. Thus the level of the first upper floor&nbsp;is
                nearly the same as that of the Nova Via, on which it faces, about&nbsp;23 feet above
                the ground floor. The upper floor is in part well&nbsp;preserved ; it contains a
                large suite of bath and other rooms, which&nbsp;were probably the sleeping
                apartments of the vestals. All the&nbsp;better rooms and the baths are lined with
                polished marbles, many&nbsp;of great beauty and rarity ; the floors are mostly
                mosaic of tesselated&nbsp;work. The paving of the tablinum was a beautiful specimen
                of&nbsp;inlay in porphyry and marble. In many places alterations and&nbsp;clumsy
                patchings of the 4th and 5th centuries are apparent. A&nbsp;number of statues of the
                chief vestal, or virgo vestalis maxima,&nbsp;with inscribed pedestals, were found in
                the atrium, mostly of the&nbsp;3d century, though a few are earlier ; these are of
                especial interest&nbsp;as illustrating the sacerdotal dress of the
                    vestals.@@<sup>5</sup> Nothing but&nbsp;the Nova Via separates the Atrium Vestæ
                from the palace of&nbsp;Caligula (see Plin., </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Ep.,</span><span class="font2"> vii. 19 ; Aul. Gell., i.
                12), which extends&nbsp;over the site of the Lucus Vestæ,—“ qui a Palatii radice in
                Novam&nbsp;Viam devexus est” (Cic., </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">De Div.,</span><span class="font2"> i. 45). A curious
                octagonal&nbsp;structure in the middle of the atrium (see fig. 16) looks very
                much&nbsp;like a border for flower-beds ; and it is possible that this
                miniature&nbsp;garden was made by the vestals when Caligula built over their
                extensive grove on the slopes of the Palatine. By the main entrance&nbsp;from the
                Forum stood a small ædicula,—a large pedestal at the&nbsp;angles of which were
                columns supporting an entablature.@@<sup>6</sup> It may&nbsp;have contained a statue
                of Vesta, there being none within the&nbsp;temple. It is of the time of Hadrian. The
                last of the vestals is&nbsp;mentioned by Zosimus (v. 38) as being alive in 394 ; but
                the Atrium&nbsp;continued to be partly inhabited for many centuries
                    later.@@<sup>7</sup> In&nbsp;September 1884 a road was discovered leading up
                past the tablinum&nbsp;end of the Atrium from the Sacra Via to the Nova Via (see
                fig.&nbsp;16). In about the 4th century this road appears to have been&nbsp;blocked
                up at the Nova Via end by a building which adjoined&nbsp;the Atrium
            Vestæ.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">At the east corner of the Forum stood the arch of Q. Fabius Maximus,
