<p><span class="font1">the central hall stands Houdon’s marble life-size statue of Washington in the uniform of a pre-Revolutionary American general, and in the esplanade near the west gates of&nbsp;Capitol Square is Crawford’s famous bronze equestrian&nbsp;statue of the same hero (1858), surrounded by bronze&nbsp;figures of Patrick Henry, Thomas Jefferson, John Marshall,&nbsp;George Mason, Thomas Nelson, and Andrew Lewis.&nbsp;North of the Capitol stands Foley’s bronze statue of&nbsp;General “ Stonewall ” Jackson, the gift of English admirers of that great Confederate leader. A governor’s&nbsp;house, a State penitentiary, a custom-house and post&nbsp;office, a city-hall and almshouse, and two market-houses&nbsp;are among the principal public buildings. Libby prison,&nbsp;in which thousands of Federal prisoners were confined&nbsp;during the Civil War, was originally a disused tobacco&nbsp;factory, and is now scarcely distinguishable from the&nbsp;other dilapidated brick warehouses in its vicinity. St&nbsp;John’s Episcopal church on Church Hill was, in 1775, the&nbsp;meeting-place of the Virginia convention to which Patrick&nbsp;Henry addressed his famous “ Give me liberty or give me&nbsp;death,” and in 1788 of another convention summoned&nbsp;to discuss the ratification of the Federal Constitution.&nbsp;Monumental Church (Episcopal) commemorates the disastrous burning in 1811 of the theatre which then occupied&nbsp;the site. The State Library, the Virginia Historical&nbsp;Society, Southern Historical Society, Richmond College,&nbsp;and the Medical College (1838) are institutions of note.&nbsp;Holywood Cemetery, occupying a district of great natural&nbsp;beauty to the west of the city, contains the graves of&nbsp;thousands of Confederate soldiers and the monuments of&nbsp;President Monroe and General J. E. B. Stuart, and the&nbsp;Confederate soldiers’ monument. Previous to the Civil&nbsp;War Richmond was the commercial capital of the South&nbsp;and a great entrepot for the produce of the Southern&nbsp;States, Cuba, South America, and Great Britain. Its&nbsp;clipper ships made fast voyages to the Pacific for tea, silk,&nbsp;and other Eastern wares. Its auction sales (monthly or&nbsp;even fortnightly) drew buyers from every part of the&nbsp;Union, even from the northern cities which now supply it&nbsp;with the very commodities they then visited it to purchase. When the war was over Richmond was without&nbsp;ships, merchants, or capital. The tea trade had gone to&nbsp;London, the South-American to New York and Boston,&nbsp;In recent years, however, a new period of commercial prosperity appears to have set in, and, while several of the old&nbsp;sources of wealth have disappeared, the city still remains&nbsp;the natural centre of some of the principal trades of the&nbsp;South. Before the war more tobacco was sold in Richmond than perhaps in any city of the Union (fifty-six&nbsp;manufacturers were numbered in 1857), and this still&nbsp;remains an important staple. The flour trade is also of&nbsp;great extent. There are a large number of iron works,&nbsp;including those of the Tredegar Company ; and granite&nbsp;quarries are worked in the vicinity of the city. In&nbsp;1857 the real estate of Richmond was assessed at&nbsp;$18,259,816, and the personal property at $10,287,278.&nbsp;By 1885 the corresponding figures were $34,502,903 and&nbsp;$15,000,000. The city is the owner of both gas and&nbsp;water works. The population, which was only 5737&nbsp;in the beginning of the century, has increased as&nbsp;follows:—9785 in 1810; 12,067 in 1820; 16,060 in&nbsp;1830; 20,153 in 1840; 27,570 in 1850; 37,910 in&nbsp;1860; 51,038 in 1870; 63,600 in 1880 (27,832 coloured).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first settlement on part of the site of Richmond is said to date from 1609 ; and Fort Charles was erected as a defence against&nbsp;the Indians in 1644-45. But the real origin of the town, which was&nbsp;incorporated in 1745, was Byrd’s warehouse, erected by Colonel&nbsp;William Byrd in the close of the 17th century. It was still a small&nbsp;village when in 1779 it was made the capital of the State of&nbsp;Virginia. From May 1861 till April 1865, when it was occupied&nbsp;by the Federal army, Richmond was the seat of government of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Confederate States. On the capture of Petersburg by General Grant the Confederate leaders thought it impossible to hold the city,&nbsp;in spite of the strength of its fortifications ; and Ewell, who commanded the rear-guard of the retreating army, set the great tobacco&nbsp;factories and Hour-mills and the arsenal on fire ; the conflagration lasted till the evening of the following day. In September&nbsp;1870 part of the city was laid under water by the floods of the&nbsp;James river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHMOND, Legh (1772-1827), writer of tracts, was born 29th January 1772 at Liverpool, where his father&nbsp;was a physician. He was educated at Trinity College,&nbsp;Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1794 and M.A.&nbsp;in 1797. In 1798 he was appointed to the joint curacies&nbsp;of Brading and Yaverland in the Isle of Wight. Through&nbsp;the perusal of Wilberforce’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Practical View</span><span class="font1"> an evangelical bias was given to his mind, which led him to devote&nbsp;himself with great earnestness to the reclamation of&nbsp;the masses. He took a prominent interest in the&nbsp;British and Foreign Bible Society, the Church Missionary&nbsp;Society, and various other institutions of a similar&nbsp;kind. In 1805 he became chaplain to the Lock Hospital, London, and in the same year was presented to&nbsp;the rectory of Turvey, Bedfordshire, where he remained&nbsp;till his death, 8th May 1827. He was also appointed&nbsp;chaplain to the duke of Kent. The best known of the&nbsp;tracts of Legh Richmond is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dairymanhs Daughter,</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;which as many as four millions in nineteen languages&nbsp;were circulated before 1849. A collected edition of his&nbsp;tracts was first published in 1814 under the title of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annals of the Poor.</span><span class="font1"> He was also the author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Domestic&nbsp;Portraiture,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of his Three Children·,</span><span class="font1"> and he&nbsp;edited a series of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fathers of the English Church.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RICHTER, Ernst Friedrich Eduard (1808-1879), writer on musical theory and composition, was born at&nbsp;Grosschönau in Saxony, on October 24, 1808. He first&nbsp;studied music at Zittau, and afterwards at Leipsic, where&nbsp;he attained so high a reputation that in 1843 he was&nbsp;appointed professor of harmony and counterpoint at the&nbsp;conservatorium of music, then newly founded by Mendelssohn. On the death of Hauptmann, January 3,&nbsp;1868, he was elected cantor of the Thomasschule, which&nbsp;office he retained until his death, April 9, 1879. He is&nbsp;best known by three theoretical works — </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lehrbτwh der&nbsp;Harmonie, Lehre vom Contrapunct,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lehre von der&nbsp;Fuge—</span><span class="font1">originally written for the use of his pupils at the&nbsp;Conservatorium, but now everywhere accepted as valuable&nbsp;text-books, and well known to English students through&nbsp;the excellent translation by Mr Franklin Taylor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHTER, Johann Paul Friedrich (1763-1825), usually called Jean Paul, the greatest German humorist,&nbsp;was born at Wunsiedel, in Bavaria, on the 21st March 1763.&nbsp;His father was a schoolmaster and organist at Wunsiedel,&nbsp;but in 1765 he became a pastor at Joditz, and in 1776 at&nbsp;Schwarzenbach, where he died in 1779. Having attended&nbsp;the gymnasium at Hof for two years, Richter went in&nbsp;1780 to the university of Leipsic. His original intention&nbsp;was to enter his father’s profession, but theology did not&nbsp;interest him, and he soon devoted himself wholly to the&nbsp;study of literature. Unable to maintain himself at&nbsp;Leipsic, he secretly left it in 1784 and lived with his&nbsp;mother at Hof. From 1787 to 1789 he served as a tutor&nbsp;at Töpen, a village near Hof ; and afterwards he taught&nbsp;the children of several families at Schwarzenbach. During&nbsp;all these years he had to struggle with extreme poverty,&nbsp;but he never lost the buoyancy of his temper, nor did he&nbsp;doubt for a moment that his genius would in the end be&nbsp;generally recognized. His hardships left no trace of&nbsp;bitterness on his frank and manly spirit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Richter began his career as a man of letters by writing the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gronldndisehe Processe</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Auswahl aus des Teufels</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
