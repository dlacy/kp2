<p><span class="font1">Within the limits of Rajputana the Rajputs form a vast body of kindred, and any Rajput can marry any Rajput woman who&nbsp;does not belong to his own clan. The most numerous of the&nbsp;clans is the Rahtor, to which the chiefs of Marwar, Bikanir and&nbsp;Kishangarh belong. Its strength in 1901 was 122, 160. Next&nbsp;comes the Kachwaha clan, which is strong in Jaipur and Alwar,&nbsp;both chiefs belonging to its members. It numbers 100, 186.&nbsp;The Chauhan follows with an aggregate of 86, 460, among whom&nbsp;are the chiefs of Bundi, Kotah and Sirohi. The Jadu or Jadon,&nbsp;which includes in its ranks the chiefs of Karauli and Jaisalmer,&nbsp;numbers 74, 666. The Sisodhyias, who include the ancient and&nbsp;illustrious house of Udaipur, number 51, 366. The Ponwar clan,&nbsp;to which Vikramaditya, the celebrated king of Ujjain, from whom&nbsp;the Hindu Era is named, is said to have belonged, numbers&nbsp;43, 435. The Solanki and Parihar clans, once powerful, are now&nbsp;only 18, 949 and 9448 respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAJPUTANA, a collection of native states in India, under the political charge of an agent to the governor-general, who&nbsp;resides at Abu in the Aravalli Hills. It lies between 23° and&nbsp;3o° N. and between 69<sup>0</sup> 30' and 75° 15' E., and includes&nbsp;18 states and 2 estates or chiefships. For political purposes&nbsp;these are subdivided into eight subordinate groups, consisting&nbsp;of three residencies and five agencies. These are as follow:&nbsp;(1) Mewar residency, with headquarters at Udaipur, comprising&nbsp;the states of Udaipur (Mewar), Dungarpur, Partabgarh and&nbsp;Banswara; (2) Jaipur residency, with headquarters at Jaipur,&nbsp;comprising the states of Jaipur and Kishangarh, with the estate&nbsp;of Lawa; (3) Western Rajputana states residency, with head-quarters at Jodhpur, comprising the states of Jodhpur, Jaisalmer&nbsp;and Sirohi; (4) Bikanir agency, with headquarters at Bikanir;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(s) </span><span class="font1">Alwar agency, with headquarters at Alwar; (6) Eastern&nbsp;Rajputana states agency, with headquarters at Bharatpur,&nbsp;comprising the states of Bharatpur, Dholpur, and Karauli;&nbsp;(7) Haraoti-Tonk agency, with headquarters at Deoli, corn-prising the states of Tonk and Bundi, with the estate of Shah-pura; (8) Kotah-Jhalawar agency, with headquarters at&nbsp;Kotah, comprising the states of Kotah and Jhalawar. All of&nbsp;these states are under Rajput rulers, except Tonk, which is&nbsp;Mahommedan, and Bharatpur and Dholpur, which are Jat.&nbsp;The small British province of Ajmere-Merwara is also included&nbsp;within the geographical area of Rajputana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Physical Features. —</span><span class="font0">The total area of Rajputana is about 127, 541 sq. m. It is bounded on the west by Sind, and on the north-west&nbsp;by the Punjab state of Bahawalpur. Thence its northern and northeastern frontier marches with the Punjab and the United Provinces&nbsp;until it touches the river Chambal, where it turns south-eastward&nbsp;for about 200 m., dividing the states of Dholpur, Karauli, Jaipur&nbsp;and Kotah from Gwalior. The southern boundary runs in a very&nbsp;irregular line across the central region of India, dividing the Rajputana&nbsp;states from a number of native states in Central lndia and Gujarat.&nbsp;The most striking physical feature is the Aravalli range of mountains,&nbsp;which intersects the country almost from end to end in a line running&nbsp;from south-west to north-east. Mount Abu is at the south-western&nbsp;extremity of the range, and the north-eastern end may be said to&nbsp;terminate near Khetri in the Shaikhawati district of Jaipur, although&nbsp;a series of broken ridges is continued in the direction of Delhi. About&nbsp;three-fifths of Rajputana lies north-west of the range, leaving two-fifths on the east and south. The tract lying to the north-west&nbsp;contains the states of Bikanir, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur. With the&nbsp;exception of the sub-montane districts of Jodhpur, which lie im-mediately below the Aravallis, this division is sandy, ill-watered&nbsp;and unproductive, improving gradually from a desert in the north-west and west to comparatively fertile land on the east. The&nbsp;country to the east and south-east of the Aravallis affords a striking&nbsp;contrast to the sandy plains on the north-west of the range, and is&nbsp;blessed with fertile lands, hill-ranges and long stretches of forest,&nbsp;where fuel and fodder are abundant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief rivers of Rajputana are the Lum, the Chambal and the Banas. The first of these, the only river of any consequence&nbsp;in the north-western division, flows for 200 m. from the Pushkar&nbsp;valley, close to Ajmere, to the Runn of Cutch. In the southeastern division the river system is important. The Chambal is&nbsp;by far the largest river in Rajputana, through which it flows for&nbsp;about one-third of its course, while it forms its boundary for another&nbsp;third. The source of the river is in the highlands of the Vindhyas, upwards of 2000 ft. above the sea; it soon becomes a considerable&nbsp;stream, collecting in its course the waters of other rivers, and finally&nbsp;discharging itself into the Jumna after a course of 560 m. Next&nbsp;in importance ranks the Banas, which rises in the south-west near</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Kankroli in Udaipur. It collects nearly all the drainage of the Udaipur plateau with that of the eastern slopes and hill-tracts of&nbsp;the Aravallis, and joins the Chambal a little beyond the north-eastern extremity of the Bundi state, after a course of about 300 m.&nbsp;Other rivers are the W. Banas and the Sabarmati, which rise among&nbsp;the south-west hills of Udaipur and take a south-westerly course.&nbsp;The river Mahi, which passes through the states of Partabgarh and&nbsp;Banswara, receiving the Som, drains the south-west corner of&nbsp;Rajputana through Gujarat into the Gulf of Cambay. Rajputana&nbsp;possesses no natural freshwater lakes, but there are several important&nbsp;artificial lakes, all of which have been constructed with the object&nbsp;of storing water. The only basin of any extent is the Sambhar&nbsp;salt lake, of about 50 m. in circuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geology. —</span><span class="font0">Geologically considered, the country may be divided into three regions—a central, and the largest, comprising the whole&nbsp;width of the Aravalli system, formed of very old sub-metamorphic&nbsp;and gneissic rocks; an eastern region, with sharply defined boundary,&nbsp;along which the most ancient formations are abruptly replaced by&nbsp;the great basin of the Vindhyan strata, or are overlaid by the still&nbsp;more extensive spread of the Deccan trap, forming the plateau of&nbsp;Malwa; and a western region, of very ill-defined margin, in which,&nbsp;besides some rocks of undetermined age, it is more or less known&nbsp;or suspected that Tertiary and Secondary strata stretch across from&nbsp;Sind, beneath the sands of the desert, towards the flanks of the&nbsp;Aravallis. Rajputana produces a variety of metals. Ore of cobalt&nbsp;is obtained in no other locality in India, and although zinc blende&nbsp;has been found elsewhere it is known to have been extracted only&nbsp;in this province. Copper and lead are found in several parts of&nbsp;the Aravalli range and of the minor ridges in Alwar and Shaikhawati, and iron ores abound in several states. Alum and blue&nbsp;vitriol (sulphate of copper) are manufactured from decomposed&nbsp;schists at Khetri in Shaikhawati. Good building materials are&nbsp;obtained from many of the rocks of the country, among which the&nbsp;Raialo limestone (a fine-grained crystalline marble) and the Jaisalmer&nbsp;limestone stand pre-eminent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Climate. —</span><span class="font0">The climate throughout Rajputana is very dry and hot during the summer; while in the winter it is much colder in&nbsp;the north than in the lower districts, with hard frost and ice on&nbsp;the Bikanir borders. The rainfall is very unequally distributed: in&nbsp;the western part, which comes near to the limits of the rainless&nbsp;region of Asia, it is very scanty, and scarcely averages more than&nbsp;5 in.; in the south-west the fall is more copious, sometimes exceeding 100 in. at Abu; but, except in the south-west highlands of the&nbsp;Aravallis, rain is most abundant in the south-east. Notwithstanding all its drawbacks, Rajputana is reckoned one of the&nbsp;healthiest countries in India, at least for the native inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Population. —</span><span class="font1">In 1901 the population was 9, 723, 301, showing a decrease of 20% in the decade owing to the great famines&nbsp;of 1897-1898 and 1900-1901. The greatest mortality was caused&nbsp;by virulent malarial fever, which raged during the autumn&nbsp;months of 1900 and the early months of 1901. Epidemics of&nbsp;cholera, which occurred during the years of scarcity and famine,&nbsp;also swept away large numbers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is commonly supposed that, because nearly the whole country is ruled by Rajputs, therefore the population consists&nbsp;mainly of Rajput tribes; but these are merely the dominant&nbsp;race, and the territory is called Rajputana because it is politic-ally possessed by Rajputs. The whole number of this race&nbsp;is 620, 229, and nowhere do they form a majority of the whole&nbsp;population in a state; but they are strongest, numerically,&nbsp;in the northern states and in Udaipur. By rigid precedence&nbsp;the Brahmans occupy the first rank; they are numerous and&nbsp;influential, and with them may be classed the peculiar and&nbsp;important caste of Bhats, the keepers of secular tradition and&nbsp;of the genealogies. Next come the mercantile castes, mostly&nbsp;belonging to the Jain sect; these are followed by the powerful&nbsp;cultivating tribes, such as the Jats and Gujars, and then come&nbsp;the so-called aboriginal tribes, chief of whom are the Minas,&nbsp;Bhils and Meos. Rajasthani is the chief language of the&nbsp;country, one or other of its dialects being spoken by 7, 035, 093&nbsp;persons or more than 72 % of the total population. The gross&nbsp;revenue of all the states is estimated at 2¼ millions sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The mass of the people are occupied in agriculture. In the large towns banking and commerce flourish to a degree beyond what&nbsp;might be expected. In the north the staple products for export&nbsp;are salt, grain, wool and cotton, in the south opium and cotton;&nbsp;while the imports consist of sugar, hardware and piece goods.&nbsp;Rajputana is very poor in industrial production. The principal&nbsp;manufactures are cotton and woollen goods, carvings in ivory&nbsp;and working in metals, &amp;c., all of which handicrafts are chiefly&nbsp;carried on in the eastern states. The system of agriculture is</span></p>
