<p><span class="font2">RAYNALD OF CHÂTILLON (d. 1187), a knight in the service of Constance, princess of Antioch, whom she chose for her&nbsp;husband in 1153, four years after the death of her first husband,&nbsp;Raymund </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.υ.).</span><span class="font2"> One of Raynald’s first acts was a brutal&nbsp;assault on the patriarch of Antioch; while two years later he&nbsp;made an unjustifiable attack on Cyprus, in the course of which&nbsp;the island was ravaged. The act brought its punishment in&nbsp;1159, when he had to humiliate himself before the emperor&nbsp;Manuel, doing homage and promising to accept a Greek&nbsp;patriarch; and when Manuel came to Antioch in the same&nbsp;year, and was visited there by Baldwin III., Raynald led his&nbsp;horse into the city. Later in the year he was captured by the&nbsp;Mahommedans, during a plundering raid against the Syrian&nbsp;and Armenian peasants of the neighbourhood of Marash, and&nbsp;confined at Aleppo. His captivity lasted seventeen years.&nbsp;Released in 1176, he married Stephanie, the widow of Humphrey&nbsp;of Toron, and heiress of Krak and Mont Royal, to the S.E. of the&nbsp;Dead Sea—fortresses which controlled the trade-routes between&nbsp;Egypt and Damascus, and gave him access to the Red Sea.&nbsp;In November 1177, at the head of the army of the kingdom, he&nbsp;won a victory over Saladin, who only escaped with difficulty&nbsp;from the pursuit. But in 1181 the temptation of the caravans&nbsp;which passed by his fortress proved too strong, and in spite of&nbsp;a truce between Saladin and Baldwin IV. he began to plunder.&nbsp;Saladin demanded reparations from Baldwin IV. Baldwin&nbsp;could only reply that he was unable to coerce his unruly vassal.&nbsp;The result was a new outbreak of war between Saladin and the&nbsp;Latin kingdom (1182). In the course of the hostilities Raynald&nbsp;launched ships on the Red Sea, partly for buccaneering, partly,&nbsp;it seems, with the design of attacking Mecca, and of challenging&nbsp;Mahommedanism in its own holy place. His ships were&nbsp;captured by one of Saladin’s officers; and at the end of the year&nbsp;Saladin himself attacked Raynald in his fortress of Krak, at a&nbsp;time when a number of guests were assembled to celebrate the&nbsp;marriage of his stepson, Humphrey of Toron. The siege was&nbsp;raised, however, by Count Raymund of Tripoli; and till 1186&nbsp;Raynald was quiet. In that year he espoused the cause of&nbsp;Sibylla and Guy de Lusignan against Count Raymund, and his&nbsp;influence contributed to the recognition of Guy as king of&nbsp;Jerusalem. His policy at this crisis was not conceived in the&nbsp;best interests of the kingdom; and a step which he took at the&nbsp;end of the year was positively fatal. Hearing of a rich caravan,&nbsp;in which the sister of Saladin was travelling, he swooped down&nbsp;from his fortress upon it. Thus, for the second time, he broke&nbsp;a truce between the kingdom and Saladin. Guy could not&nbsp;extort from him the. satisfaction which Saladin demanded:&nbsp;Raynald replied that he was lord in his lands, and that he had&nbsp;no peace with Saladin to respect. Saladin swore that Raynald&nbsp;should perish if ever he took him prisoner; and next year he&nbsp;was able to fulfil his oath. He invaded the kingdom, and, at the&nbsp;battle of Hittin, Raynald along with King Guy and many others&nbsp;fell into his hands. They were brought to his tent; and Saladin,&nbsp;after rebuking Raynald strongly for his treachery, offered him&nbsp;his life if he would become a Mahommedan. He refused, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Saladin either slew him with his own hands or caused him to be slain (for accounts differ) in the presence of his companions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The death of Raynald caused him to be regarded as a martyr; his life only shows him to have been a brigand of great capacity.&nbsp;He is the apotheosis of the feudal liberty which the barons of the&nbsp;Holy Land vindicated for themselves; and he shows, in his reckless&nbsp;brigandage, the worst side of their character. Stevenson, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crusades&nbsp;in the East</span><span class="font1"> (Cambridge, 1907), takes a most favourable view of&nbsp;Raynald’s career: cf. especially pp. 240-241. But his whole life&nbsp;seems to indicate a self-willed and selfish temper.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(E. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Br.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAYNAUD’S DISEASE, a malady first described by P. Edouard Raynaud in 1862 in a paper on “ Local Asphyxia and&nbsp;Symmetrical Gangrene of the Extremities.” The condition is&nbsp;said to be of central nervous origin, and cold, fright, or emotional&nbsp;disturbances are predisposing causes. It is a disease of childhood or early adult life, and females are more frequently affected&nbsp;than males. Raynaud attributed the symptoms to an arrest&nbsp;of the passage of blood to the affected parts, and considered&nbsp;this due to a spasm of the arterioles. If the spasm be sufficiently prolonged and intense to completely close the arterial&nbsp;channels gangrene of the part may be the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The local symptoms are divided into three well-marked stages. The first is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">local syncope,</span><span class="font2"> in which the affected parts&nbsp;become temporarily bloodless, white, cold, and anaesthetic.&nbsp;The condition is familiar in what is termed a “ dead finger,&quot;&nbsp;and is usually bilateral. After a variable time the circulation&nbsp;may become restored with a tingling sensation, or the disease&nbsp;may progress to the second stage, that of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">local asphyxia.</span><span class="font2"> In&nbsp;this condition some part of the body, usually a finger, toe, or&nbsp;the whole hand or foot, becomes painful to the touch and is&nbsp;noticed to be dusky in colour, or bluish-purple or even mottled,&nbsp;and the surface is cold. This discoloration may deepen until&nbsp;the skin is almost black, the tactile sense being lost. After&nbsp;several hours the pain may subside, the attack of lividity pass&nbsp;off, and warmth return to the skin. Such attacks of local&nbsp;asphyxia may return every day for a time. Sometimes severe&nbsp;abdominal pain is present, accompanied by haematuria. The&nbsp;frequency of haematuria in this connexion was first noticed by&nbsp;Hutchinson in 1871. In the third stage, that of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">local gangrene,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the involved areas assume a black and shrivelled appearance,&nbsp;livid streaks marking the course of the arteries; blebs may&nbsp;form containing bloody fluid. The degree of destruction varies&nbsp;from the detachment of a patch of soft tissue down to the loss&nbsp;of even a whole limb, the part becoming separated by a line of&nbsp;demarcation as in senile gangrene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In Raynaud’s disease the patients have been noticed to be very susceptible to cold and low temperatures; every effort&nbsp;should be made to keep the extremities warm; woollen&nbsp;underclothing and stockings should be worn, and the activity&nbsp;of the circulation roused by douches and exercise; by these&nbsp;means an attack may be prevented. Should local asphyxia&nbsp;have taken place, one of the best treatments to lessen pain and&nbsp;obtain the return of the natural colour is the application of the&nbsp;constant current. Sir T. Barlow directs its application, the&nbsp;limb being placed in a bath of warm salt and water. Cushing’s&nbsp;method of inducing active hyperaemia has been attended with&nbsp;much success. This treatment is only applicable when the&nbsp;vascular spasm affects the extremities,. and consists in the&nbsp;artificial constriction of the limb by the application of a tourniquet or Esmarch’s bandage for a few minutes daily. This is&nbsp;followed by hyperaemia and increased surface temperature,&nbsp;and affords much relief to the pain of the stage of asphyxia.&nbsp;Drugs which dilate the peripheral vessels, such as amyl nitrite&nbsp;and trinitrine, have also been recommended. When gangrene&nbsp;occurs in the affected part it should be well wrapped in absor-bent cotton and kept dry, and all active treatment should cease&nbsp;until a line of demarcation has formed and the gangrenous&nbsp;portion separated. The disease tends towards recovery with&nbsp;more or less loss of tissue if the stage of gangrene has been&nbsp;reached</span></p>
