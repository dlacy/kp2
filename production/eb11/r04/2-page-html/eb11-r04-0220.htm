<p><span class="font1">was further subdivided by Sir Henry Sydney, and was assigned its present limits. All the old proprietors were dispossessed&nbsp;at the Cromwellian settlement, except the O’Conor family&nbsp;headed by the O’Conor Don. The most interesting antiquarian&nbsp;remains within the county are the ruins of Crogan, the ancient&nbsp;palace of the kings of Connaught. The principal ancient&nbsp;castles are the old stronghold of the McDermotts on Castle&nbsp;Island, Lough Key, the dismantled castle of the McDonoughs&nbsp;at Ballinafad, and the extensive fortress at Roscommon rebuilt&nbsp;by John d’Ufford, justiciary of Ireland in 1268. There are&nbsp;fragments of a round tower at Oran. The abbey of Boyle is in&nbsp;remarkably good preservation, and exhibits fine specimens of&nbsp;the Norman arch. The other monastic remains within the&nbsp;county, with the exception of the abbey of Roscommon, are of&nbsp;comparatively small importance. The Irish bard Carolan, who&nbsp;died in 1738, is buried by the ruined church of Kilronan, in the&nbsp;extreme north of the county. The bishopric of Elphin was&nbsp;united with Kilmore and Ardagh in 1833, and the former&nbsp;cathedral and episcopal buildings are largely modernized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSCOMMON, a market town and the county town of Co. Roscommon, Ireland, situated on rising ground in a bare plain&nbsp;in the centre of the county, on the Mayo line of the Midland&nbsp;Great Western railway, i8{ m. N.W. by N. from Athlone. Pop.&nbsp;(1901) 1891. It contains the county buildings, and has&nbsp;Protestant and Roman Catholic churches, the latter of which&nbsp;is a fine building completed in 1903. An extensive trade is&nbsp;carried on in agricultural produce and live stock. A castle,&nbsp;dating from 1268, when it was founded by John d’Ufford,&nbsp;justiciary of Ireland, stands, an imposing mass of ruins, but far&nbsp;gone in decay, overlooking the plain. It fell to besiegers in&nbsp;1566, 1642 and 1652, and was partially burned after the battle of&nbsp;Aughrim in 1691. There are also remains of a Dominican priory&nbsp;of the middle of the 13th century, founded by Felim O’Conor,&nbsp;king of Connaught, and exhibiting fine, though mutilated,&nbsp;details of the style of that period. The name of the town,&nbsp;signifying St Coman’s wood, is derived from the saint who&nbsp;founded the monastery of Canons Regular here in the 6th&nbsp;century. The town received charters from Edward I. and James&nbsp;I. Two m. N,E. are small remains of the abbey of Deerane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSCREA, a market town near the north-western border of Co. Tipperary, Ireland, pleasantly situated on undulating&nbsp;ground connecting the Devil’s Bit and the Slieve Bloom mountains. Pop. (1901) 2325. It is 77 m. W.S.W. from Dublin&nbsp;on the Ballybrophy and Limerick branch of the Great Southern&nbsp;&amp; Western railway. A branch line runs northward to Birr&nbsp;or Parsonstown. Flour-milling and tanning are industries,&nbsp;and monthly cattle fairs are held. There is a branch here of&nbsp;the Trappist Monastery of Mount Melleray in Co. Waterford.&nbsp;The antiquarian remains are of interest. These include portions&nbsp;of an Augustinian abbey, founded by St Cronan, early in the&nbsp;7th century, which are incorporated into the church. Out of&nbsp;this abbey a diocese grew, to be united with that of Killaloe&nbsp;in the 12th century. Here also was produced the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Book of&nbsp;Dimma,</span><span class="font1"> consisting of the gospels and accompanied by a brazen&nbsp;shrine, ornamented with silver and tracery, and preserved in&nbsp;the library of Trinity College, Dublin. A cross and a shrine&nbsp;of St Cronan are in the churchyard. There are also a round&nbsp;tower, 80 ft. in height, but lacking the upper storeys, and a&nbsp;Franciscan friary (1490); while a circular tower, and a square&nbsp;keep (occupied as barracks), mark strongholds, the one built&nbsp;by King John and the other by the Ormondes, and testify to&nbsp;the former importance of the town, which was doubtless accentuated by its physical position in a passway between the&nbsp;neighbouring mountain ranges. Leap Castle, about 4 m. N., is&nbsp;another fortified mansion, which is still inhabited;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSE, the name of a distinguished family of German chemists. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Valentine Rose</span><span class="font1"> the elder was born on the 16th of August 1736&nbsp;at Neu-Ruppin, and died on the 28th of April 1771 at Berlin,&nbsp;where he was an apothecary and for a short time before his&nbsp;death assessor of the Ober Collegium Medicum. He w<sup>T</sup>as the&nbsp;discoverer of “ Rose’s fusible metal ” (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fusible Metal).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">His son, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Valentine Rose</span><span class="font1"> the younger, bom on the 31st of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">October 1762 at Berlin, was also an apothecary in that city and assessor of the Ober Collegium Medicum from 1797. It was he&nbsp;who in 1800 proved that sulphuric ether contains no sulphur. He&nbsp;died in Berlin on the 10th of August 1807, leaving four sons,&nbsp;one of whom, Heinrich, was a distinguished chemist, and&nbsp;another, Gustav, a crystallographer and mineralogist. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Heinrich Rose,</span><span class="font1"> born at Berlin on the 6th of August 1795, began to&nbsp;learn pharmacy in Danzig, where, during the siege of 1807,&nbsp;he nearly lost his life from typhus. Like his brother he served&nbsp;in the campaign of 1815. During the summer of the following&nbsp;year he studied at Berlin under M. H. Klaproth, a devoted&nbsp;friend of the family, and in the autumn entered a pharmacy at&nbsp;Mitau. In 1819 he went to Stockholm, where he spent a year&nbsp;and a half with J. J. Berzelius, and in 1821 he graduated at&nbsp;Kiel. Returning to Berlin he became a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Privatdozent</span><span class="font1"> in the&nbsp;university in 1822, extraordinary professor of chemistry in 1823&nbsp;and ordinary professor in 1835, and there he died on the 27th&nbsp;of January 1864. He devoted himself especially to inorganic&nbsp;chemistry and the development of analytical methods, and the&nbsp;results of his work are summed up in the successive issues of his&nbsp;classical work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ausjuhrliches Handbuch der analytischen Chemic,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of which he published the first edition at Berlin in 1829, and&nbsp;the sixth, practically a new work in French, at Paris in 1861.&nbsp;He was the discoverer of antimony pentachloride, and mentioq&nbsp;may also be made of his researches on the influence of the&nbsp;mass-action of water in many reactions, carried out before&nbsp;the investigations of Guldberg and Waage in 1867. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gustav&nbsp;Rose,</span><span class="font1"> born at Berlin on the 18th of March 1798, began his&nbsp;career as a mining engineer, but soon turned his attention to&nbsp;theoretical studies. A pupil of Berzelius like his brother, he&nbsp;graduated in 1820 at Berlin University where he became&nbsp;successively </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Privatdozent</span><span class="font1"> (1823), extraordinary professor of&nbsp;mineralogy (1826) and ordinary professor (1839). In 1856 he&nbsp;succeeded to the directorship of the Royal Mineralogical Museum&nbsp;at Berlin, and he helped to found the German Geological Society,&nbsp;of which he was president from 1863 until the end of his life.&nbsp;He made many journeys in different parts of Europe for the&nbsp;sake of mineralogical study, and in 1829 with A. von Humboldt&nbsp;and C. G. Ehrenberg (1795-1876), professor of medicine at&nbsp;Berlin, took part in an expedition to the Ural and Altai mountains and the Caspian Sea, which yielded information of primary&nbsp;importance concerning the mineralogy of the Russian Empire.&nbsp;His work covered every branch of mineralogy, including crystallography and the artificial formation of minerals. The science&nbsp;of petrography, according to Gerhard vom Rath, originated&nbsp;with him. He was the first in his own country to use the reflecting goniometer for the measurement of the angles of crystals,&nbsp;and to teach the method of studying rocks by means of microscopic sections. He also devoted special attention to meteorites&nbsp;and to the problem presented by the different structure of the&nbsp;stony matter in them and in the crust of the earth, and just&nbsp;before his death, which took place at Berlin on the 15th of July&nbsp;1873, he was engaged in investigating the formation of the&nbsp;diamond. In addition to many scientific memoirs he published&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elemente der Krystallographie</span><span class="font1"> (1830); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Miner alogischgeognostlsche&nbsp;Reise nach dem Ural, dem Altai und dem Kaspische Meere&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1837) vol. i.; (1S42) vol. ii.; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Das Krystallo-chemische Mineral-system</span><span class="font1"> (1852); and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Beschreibung und Eintkeilung der Meteoriten&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1863).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSE, GEORGE (1744-1818), British politician, was born on the 17th of June 1744, and was educated at Westminster school,&nbsp;afterwards entering the navy, a service which he left in 1762&nbsp;after he had taken part in some fighting in the West Indies.&nbsp;He then obtained a position in the Civil Service, becoming joint&nbsp;keeper of the records in 1772 and secretary to the board of taxes&nbsp;in 1777. In 1782 he gave up the latter appointment to become&nbsp;one of the secretaries to the treasury under Lord Shelburne,&nbsp;though he did not enter parliament. He left office with his&nbsp;colleagues in April 1783, but in the following December he&nbsp;returned to his former position at the treasury in Pitt’s ministry,&nbsp;being henceforward one of this minister’s most steadfast&nbsp;supporters.
