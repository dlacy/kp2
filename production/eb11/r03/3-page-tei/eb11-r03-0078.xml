The emperor hoped to obtain money. EHzabeth Farnese hoped to secure the Italian duchies for her sons, and some vague stipulations were made that Charles VI. should give his aid for the recovery by Spain of Gibraltar and Minorca. When Ripperda returned to Madrid at the close of 1725 he asserted that the emperor expected him to be made prime minister. The Spanish sovereigns, who were overawed by this quite unfounded assertion, allowed him to grasp the most important posts under the crown. He excited the violent hostility of the Spaniards, and entered into a complication of intrigues with the French and English governments. His career was short. In 1726 the Austrian envoy, who had vainly pressed for the payment of the promised subsidies, came to an explanation with the Spanish sovereigns. It was discovered that Ripperda had not only made promises that he was not authorized to make, but had misappropriated large sums of money. The sovereigns who had made him duke and grandee shrank from covering themselves with ridicule by revealing the way in which they had been deceived. Ripperda was dismissed with the promise of a pension. Being in terror of the hatred of the Spaniards, he took refuge in the English embassy. To secure the favour of the English envoy, Colonel William Stanhope, afterwards Lord Harrington, he betrayed the secrets of his government. Stanhope could not protect him, and he was sent as a prisoner to the castle of Segovia. In 1728 he escaped, probably with the connivance of the government, and made his way to Holland. His last years are obscure. It is said that he reverted to Protestantism, and then went to Morocco, where he became a Mahommedan and commanded the Moors in an unsuccessful attack on Ceuta. But this story is founded on his so-called <hi rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi>  which are in fact a Grub-street tale of adventure published at Amsterdam in 1740. AU that is really known is that he did go to Morocco, and that he died at Tetuan in 1737.</p><p>See Arnold Ritter von Arneth, <hi rend="italic">Prinz Eugen von Savoyen </hi>(Vienna, 1864), for the negotiations of 1725, and Gabriel S^veton, <hi rend="italic">Une Cour et un aventurier au XVIIP siècle</hi>  (Paris, 1896).

He received his early training in Hamburg and Bremen; after studying theology at Rinteln and Rostock, he became in 1633 private tutor in a family of Heide, and two years later (1635) was appointed pastor of the village of Wedel on the Elbe, where he laboured until his death on the 31st of August 1667. Rist first made his name known to the literary world by a drama, <hi rend="italic">Perseus</hi>  (1634), which he wrote while at Heide, and in the next succeeding years he produced a number of dramatic works of which the allegory <hi rend="italic">Das friedewünschende Teutschland</hi>  (1647) and <hi rend="italic">Das friedejauchzende TeutschlanA</hi>  (1653) (new ed. of both by H. M. Schletterer, 1864) are the most interesting. Rist soon became the central figure in a school of minor poets, and honours were showered upon him from every side. The emperor Ferdinand III. crowned him laureate in 1644, ennobled him in 1653, and invested him with the dignity of a Count Palatine, an honour which enabled him to crown, and to gain numerous poets for the Elbschwanen order, a literary and poetical society which he founded in 1656. He had already, in 1645, been admitted, under the name “ Daphnis aus Cimhrien,” to the literary order of Pegnitz, and in 1647 he became, as “ Der Rüstige,” a member of the Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft. It is, however, as a writer of church hymns (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hymns)</hi>  that Rist is best known to fame. Among these several are still retained in the evangelical hymn book: <hi rend="italic">e.g. O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">ErmunFre dich, mein schwacher Geist.</hi>  Collections of his poems appeared under the titles <hi rend="italic">Musa Teutonica</hi>  (1634) and <hi rend="italic">Himmlische Lieder </hi>(1643)· ....</p><p>Selections of Rist’s writings have been published by W. Muller in vol. viii. of his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothek deutscher Dichter des //. Jahrh.</hi>  (1822-1838), and by K. Goedeke and E. Goeze (1885). See T.

He was educated at Belgrade, Heidelberg, Berlin and Paris. After failing to obtain a professorship in the high school of Belgrade, he was appointed in 1861 Servian diplomatic agent at Constantinople. His reputation was enhanced by the series of negotiations which ended in the withdrawal of the Turkish troops from the Servian fortresses in 1867. On his return from Constantinople he was offered a ministerial post by Prince Michael, who described him as “ his right arm,” but declined office, being opposed to the reactionary methods adopted by the prince’s government. He had already hecome the recognized leader of the Liberal party. After the assassination of Prince Michael in 1868, he was nominated member of the council of regency, and on the 2nd January 1869 the first Servian constitution, which was mainly his creation, was promulgated. When Prince Alilan attained his majority in 1872, Ristitch became foreign minister; a few months later he was appointed prime minister, but resigned in the following autumn (1873). He again became prime minister in April 1876, and conducted the two wars against Turkey (July 1876-March 1877 and December 1877-March 1878). At the congress of Berlin he laboured with some success to obtain greater advantages for Servia than had been accorded to her by the treaty of San Stefano. The provisions of the treaty of Berlin, however, disappointed the Servians, owing to the obstacles now raised to the realization of the national programme; the Ristitch government became unpopular, and resigned in 1880. In 1887 King Milan (who had assumed the royal title in 1882), alarmed at the threatening attitude of the Radical party, recalled Ristitch to power at the bead of a coalition cabinet; a new constitution <hi rend="sup">K</hi>was granted in 1888, and in the following year the king abdicated in favour of his son, Prince Alexander. Ristitch now became head of a council of regency, entrusted with power during the minority of the young king, and a Radical ministry was formed. In 1892, however, Ristitch transferred the government to the Liberal party, with which he had always been connected. This step and the subsequent</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
