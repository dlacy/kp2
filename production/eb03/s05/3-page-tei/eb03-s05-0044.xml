The provinces of Frieſland and Groningen, with Ommelands, have always had a ſtadtholder without interruption : their inſtructions, which are now no longer in force, may be ſeen in Aitzema ; but formerly the powers of the ſtadtholder of theſe provinces were confined within narrower bounds, and till William the Fourth there was no ſtadtholder of the ſeven provinces together.</p><p>The ſtadtholder cannot declare war nor make peace, but he has, in quality of captain-general of the union, the command in chief of all the forces of the ſtate @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(a) ; </hi>and military perſons are obliged to obey him in every thing that concerns the ſervice. He is not limited by instructions, but he has the important power of giving out orders for the march of troops, and the diſpoſition of all matters relative to them. He not only directs their marches, but provides for the garriſons, and changes them at pleaſure. All military edicts and regulations come from him alone ; he conſtitutes and authorizes the high council of war of the United Provinces, and, as captain-general of every province, diſpoſes of all military offices, as far as the rank of colonel incluſively. The higher poſts, ſuch as thoſe of velt-marſhals, generals, lieutenant-generals, major-generals, are given by the states-general, who chooſe the perlons recommended by his highneſs. He make; the governors, commandants, &amp;c. of towns and ſtrong places of the republic, and of the barrier. The perſons nominated preſent their inſtruments of appointment to their high mightineſſes, who provide them with commiſſions. The ſtates-general have likewiſe great regard to the recommendation of the prince ſtadtholder in the diſpoſition of thoſe civil employments which are in their gift.</p><p>The power of the ſtadtholder as high-admiral, extends to every thing that concerns the naval force of the republic, and to all the other affairs that are here within the juriſdiction of the admiralty. He preſides at theſe boards either in perſon or by his repreſentar tives ; and as chief of them all in general, and of every one in particular, he has power to make their orders and inſtructions be obſerved by themſelves and others. He beſtows the poſts of lieutenant-admiral, vice-admiral, and rear-admiral, who command under him ; and he makes likewiſe poſt-captains.</p><p>The ſtadtholder grants likewiſe letters of grace, pardon, and abolition, as well for the crime called <hi rend="italic">Communia Delicta,</hi> as for military offences. In Holland and Zealand theſe letters are made out for crimes of the firſt fort, in the name of the ſtates, with the advice of his highneſs. In military offences he conſults the high council of vzar, and upon the <hi rend="italic">communia delicta</hi> he takes the advice of the courts of juſtice, of the counſellors, committees of the provinces, of the council of ſtate, and the tribunals of juſtice in the reſpective towns, according to the nature of the caſe.</p><p>In the provinces of Holland and Zealand, the ſtadtholder elects the magiſtrates of the towns annually, out of a double number that are returned to him by the towns themſelves.</p><p>When any of thoſe offices become vacant, which, at the time there was no governor, were in the diſpoſal of the ſtates of Holland, or as formerly in that of the chamber of accounts, the ſtadtholder has his choice of two, or, in ſome caſes, of three candidates, named by their noble and great mightineſſes. He chooſes likewiſe the counſellors, inspectors of the dykes of Rynland, Delſland, and Scheeland, out of three perſons preſented to him by the boards of the counſellors inſpectors ; which boards are of very ancient eſtabliſhment in Holland.</p><p>His highneſs preſides in the courts of Holland, and in the courts of juſtice of the other provinces ; and his name is placed at the head of the proclamations and acts, called in Dutch <hi rend="italic">Mαndamenten,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Provisien van Justitie.</hi> In Overyſſel and in the province of Utrecht the poſſeſſors of fiefs hold of the prince ſtadtholder. He is ſupreme curator of the univerſities of Guelder, Frieſland, and Groningen ; grand foreſter and grand veneur in Guelder, in Holland, and other places. In the province of Utrecht, his highneſs, by virtue of the regulation of 1674, diſpoſes of the provoſtſhips and other  benefices which remain to the chapters, as alſo of the canonical prebends that fall in the months which were formerly the papal months.</p><p>By the firſt article of the council of ſtate of the United Provinces, the ſtadtholder is the firſt member of it, and has a right of voting there, with an appointment of 25,090 guilders a-year. He aſſiſts alſo as often as he thinks it for the ſervice of the ſtate, at the deliberations of the ſtates-general, to make propoſitions to them, and ſometimes alſo at the conferences which the deputies of their high mightineſſes hold in their different committees, in conſequence of their ſtanding orders. He likewiſe aſſiſts at the affemblies of the ſtates of each particular province, and at that of the counſellors committees. In  Guelder, Holland, and Utrecht, his highneſs has a ſhare of the ſovereignty, as chief or preſident of the body of nobles ; and in Zealand, where he poſſesſes the marquiſate of Veer and Fluſhing, as firſt noble, and repreſenting the whole nobility. In his abſence he has in Zealand his repreſentatives, who have the firſt place and the firſt voice in all, the councils, and the firſt of whom is always firſt deputy from the province to the aſſembly of their high mightineſſes.</p><p>In 1749 the prince ſtadtholder was created by ths</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a)</hi> In times of war, however, the ſtates have always named deputies for the army, t accompany the ſtadt-holders in the field, and to ſerve them as counſellors in all their enterpriſes, particularly in the moſt important affairs, ſuch as giving battle, or undertaking a ſiege, &amp;c. This was always practiſed till the acceſſion of king. William the Third to the crown of Great Britain, and after his death was continued with regard to the general in chief of the army of the republic. In 1747 and 1748 there were likewiſe deputies with the army, but with more limited power.</p></body></text></TEI>
