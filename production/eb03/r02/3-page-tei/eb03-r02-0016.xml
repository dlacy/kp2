The female calyx is tripartite; there is no corolla, but three bifid ſtyles, with a trilocular capſule, and a ſingle ſeed. There are three ſpecies, of which the moſt remarkable is the communis, or common palma Chriſti. This tree is of ſpeedy growth, as in one year it arrives at its full height, which ſeldom exceeds 20 feet. The trunk is ſubligneous; the pith is large; the leaves broad and palmated; the flower ſpike is ſimple, and thickly ſet with yellow bloſſoms in the ſhape of a cone; the capſules are triangular and prickly, containing three ſmooth gray mottled ſeeds. When the bunches begin to turn black, they are gathered, dried in the ſun, and the ſeeds picked out. They are afterwards put up for uſe as wanted, or for exportation.</p><p>Caſtor oil is obtained either by expreſſion or by decoction. The firſt method is practiſed in England; the latter in Jamaica. It is common firſt to parch the nuts or feeds in an iron pot over the fire; but this gives the oil an empyreumatic taſte, ſmell, and colour; and it is beſt prepared in this manner: A large iron pot or boiler is firſt prepared, and half filled with water. The nuts are then beaten in parcels in deep wooden mortars, and after a quantity is beaten it is thrown into the iron veſ-ſel. The fire is then lighted, and the liquor is gently boiled for two hours, and kept conſtantly ſtirred. About this time the oil begins to ſeparate, and ſwims on the top, mixed with a white froth, and is ſkimmed off till no more riſes. The ſkimmings are heated in a ſmall iron pot, and ſtrained through a cloth. When cold, it is put up in jars or bottles for uſe.</p><p>Caſtor oil, thus made, is clear and well flavoured, and if put into proper bottles will keep ſweet for years. The expreſſed caſtor oil ſoon turns rancid, becauſe the mucilaginous and acrid parts of the nut are ſqueezed out with the oil. On this account the preference is given to well prepared oil by decoction. An Engliſh gallon of the ſeeds yield about two pounds of oil, which is a great proportion.</p><p>Before the diſturbances in America, the planters imported train oil ſor lamps and other purpoſes about ſu-gar works. It is now found that the caſtor oil can be procured as cheap as the fiſh oil of America: it burns clearer, and has not any offenſive ſmell. This- oil, too, is fit for all the purpoſes of the painter, or for the apothecary in ointments and plaſters. As a medicine, it purges without ſtimulus, and is ſo mild as to be given to infants ſoon after birth, to purge off the meconium. All oils are noxious to infects, but the caſtor oil kills and expels them. It is generally given as a purge after uſing the cabbage bark ſome days. In conſtipation and belly-ach this oil is uſed with remarkable ſucceſs. It ſits well on the ſtomach, allays the ſpaſm, and brings about a plentiful evacuation by ſtool, eſpecially if at the ſame time fomentations, or the warm bath, are uſed. — Belly-ach is at preſent leſs frequent in Jamaica than formerly, owing to ſeveral cauſes. The inhabitants, in general, live better, and drink  better liquors; but the</p><lb/><p>exceſſive drinking of new rum ſtill makes it frequent amongſt ſoldiers, ſailors, and the lower order of white people. It has been known to happen too from viſceral obſtructions after intermittents, or marſh fevers, in Jamaica.</p><p>The ricinus Americanus grows as tall as a little tree, and is ſo beautiful that Millar ſays it deſerves a place in every curious garden, and he planted it himſelf at Chelſea. It expands into many branches; the leaves are ſometimes two feet in diameter; and the ſtem as large as a middle-ſized broom ſtaff; towards the top of the branch it has a cluſter of flowers, ſomething reſem-bling a bunch of grapes; the flowers are ſmall and ſta-minous, but on the body of the plant grow bunches of rough triangular huſks, each containing three ſpeckled ſeeds, generally ſomewhat leſs than horſe beans; the ſhell is brittle, and contains white kernels of a ſweet, oily, and nauſeous taſte. From this kernel the oil is extracted, and if the medicine ſhould become officinal, the ſeeds may be imported at a reaſonable rate, as the plant grows wild and in great plenty in all the Britiſh and French American iſlands.

They are propagated by ſeeds ſown on a hotſhed, and require the ſame treatment as other tender exotics-.</p><p>RICKETS, in medicine.

Belidor, and firſt uſed at the ſiege of Ath in 1697. This mode of firing out of mortars was firſt tried in 1723 at the military ſchool at Straſhourg, and with ſucceſs. At the battle of Roſ-bach, in 1757, the king of Pruſſia had ſeveral 6-inch mortars made with trunnions, and mounted on travelling -carriages, which fired obliquely on the enemy's lines, and amongſt their horſe, loaded with 8 ounces of powder, and at an elevation of one degree 15 minutes, which did great execution; for the ſhells rolling along the lines, with burning fuzes, made the ſtouteſt of the enemy not wait for their burſting.</p><p>RICOTIA, in botany: A genus of the ſiliquoſa order, belonging to the tetradynamia claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 39th order, <hi rend="italic">Siliquoſ</hi><hi rend="italic">æ</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>  The ſiliqua is unilocular, oblong, and com-preſſed, with plain valvules.</p><p>RIDGE, in agriculture; a long piece of riſing land between two furrows.
