We cannot divine what has cauſed Mr Buffon to ſay that the courſe of moſt riverg is from eaſt to weſt or from weſt to eaſt. No phy∩cal point of his ſyſtem ſeems to require it, and it needs only that we look at his own map to fee its falſity. We ſhould naturally expect: to find the <hi rend="italic">general</hi>  courſe of rivers nearly perpendicular to the line of ſea-coaſt; and we find it ſo ; and the chief exceptions are in oppoſi-tion to Mr Buffon’s aſſertion. The ſtructure of America is ſo particular, that <hi rend="italic">very few</hi>  of its rivers have their general courſe in this direction. We proceed now to conſider the motion of rivers ; a ſubject which naturally reſolves itſelf into two parts, <hi rend="italic">theoretical</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">practical.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Part</hi>  I. THEORY or <hi rend="smallcaps">the</hi>  MOTION <hi rend="smallcaps">of</hi>  RIVERS <hi rend="smallcaps">and</hi>  CANALS.</p><p>THE importance of this ſubject needs no commentary. Every nation, every country, every city, is intereſted in it. Neither our wants, our comforts, nor our pleaſures, can diſpenſe with an ignorance of it. We muſt conduct their waters to the centre of our dwellings ; we muſt ſecure ourſelves againſt their ravages ; we muſt employ them to drive thoſe machines which, by compenſating for our perſonal weakneſs, make a few able to perform the work of thouſands ; we employ them to water and fertilize our fields, to decorate our manſions, to cleanſe and embelliſh our cities, to preſerve or extend our demeſnes, to tranſport from county to county every thing which neceſſity, convenience, or luxury, has rendered precious to man : for theſe purpoſes we muſt confine and govern the mighty rivers, we muſt preſerve or change the beds of the ſmaller ſtreams, draw off from them what ſhall water our fields, drive our machines, or ſupply our houſes. We muſt keep up their waters for the purpoſes of navigation, or ſupply their places by canals ; we muſt drain our fens, and defend them when drained ; we muſt underſtand their motions, and their mode of ſecret, flow, but un-ceaſing action, that our bridges, our wharfs, our dikes, may not become heaps of ruins. Ignorant how to proceed in theſe daily recurring caſes, bow often do we ſee projects of high expectation and heavy expence fail of their object, leaving the ſtate burdened with works not</p><p>only uſeleſs but frequently hurtful ?</p><p>This has long been a moſt intereſting ſubject of ſtudy in Italy, where the fertility of their fields is not more indebted to their rich foil and happy climate, than to their numerous derivations from the rivers which traverse them : and in Holland and Flanders, where their very exiſtence requires unceaſing attention to the waters, which are every moment ready to ſwallow up the inhabitants ; and where the inhabitants, having once fob -dued this formidable enemy, have made thoſe very waters their indefatigable drudges, tranſporting through every corner of the country the materials of the moſt extenſive commerce on the face of this globe.</p><p>Such having been our inceſſant occupations with moving waters, we ſhould expect that while the operative artiſts are continually furniſhing facts and experiments, the man of ſpeculative and ſcientiſic curioſity, excited by the importance of the ſubject, would ere now have made conſiderable progreſs in the ſcience ; and that the profeſſional engineer would be daily acting from eſtabliſhed principle, and be ſeldom diſappointed in his expectations. Unfortunately the reverſe of this is nearly the true ſtate of the caſe ; each engineer is obliged to collect the greateſt part of his knowledge from his own experience, and by many dear-bought leſſons, to direct his future operations, in which he ſtill proceeds with anxiety and heſitation : for we have not yet acquired principles of theory, and experiments have not yet been collected and publiſhed, by which an empirical practice might be ſafely formed. Many experiments of ineſtimable value are daily made ; but they remain with their authors, who ſeldom have either leiſure, ability, or generoſity, to add them to the public ſtock.</p><p>The motion of waters has been really ſo little inveſ-tigated as yet, that hydraulics may ſtill be called a new ſtudy. We have merely ſhimmed over a few common notions concerning the motions of water ; and the mathematicians of the firſt order ſeem to have contented themſelves with ſuch views as allowed them to entertain themſelves with elegant applications of calculus. This, however, has not been their fault. They rarely had any opportunity of doing more, for want of a knowledge of facts. They have made excellent uſe of the few which have been given them j but it required much labour, great variety of opportunity, and great expence, to learn the multiplicity of things which are combined even in the ſimpleſt caſes of water in motion. Theſe are ſeldom the lot of the mathematician ; and he is without blame when he enjoys the pleaſures within his reach, and cultivates the ſcience of geometry in its moſt abſtracted form. Here he makes a progreſs which is the boaſt of human reaſon, being almoſt inſured from error by the intellectual ſimplicity of his ſubject. But when we turn our attention to material objects, and without knowing either the ſize and ſhape of the elementary particles, or the laws which nature has preſcribed for their action, preſume to foreſee their effects, calculate their exertions, direct their actions, what muſt be the conſequence ? Nature ſhows her independence with reſpect to our notions, and, always faithful to the laws which are injoined, and of which we are ignorant, ſhe never fails to thwart our views, to diſconcert our projects, and render uſeleſs all our efforts.</p><p>To wiſh to know the nature of the elements is vain, and our groſs organs are infoſſicient for the ſtudy. To ſuppoſe what we do not know, and to fancy ſhapes and ſizes at will ; this is to raiſe phantoms, and will produce a ſyſtem, but will not prove a foundation, for any ſcience. But to interrogate Nature herſelf, ſtudy the laws which ſhe ſo faithfully obſerves, catch her, as we ſay, in the fact, and thus wreſt from her the ſecret; this is the only way to become her maſter, and it is the only procedure conſiſtent with good ſenſe. And we ſee, that ſoon after Kepler detected the laws of the planetary motions, when Galileo diſcovered the uniform acceleration of gravity, when Paſchal diſcovered the pref≈ fore of the atmoſphere, and Newton diſcovered the laws of attraction and the track of a ray of light; aſtronomy, mechanics, hydroſtatics, chemiſtry, optics, quickly be</p></body></text></TEI>
