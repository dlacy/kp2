<p><span class="font1">RICE (Greek ὸpύςa, Latin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oryza,</span><span class="font1"> French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">riz,</span><span class="font1"> Italian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">riso, </span><span class="font1">Spanish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arros,</span><span class="font1"> derived from the Arabic), a well-known cereal,&nbsp;botanical name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oryza saliva.</span><span class="font1"> According to Roxburgh, the&nbsp;great Indian botanist, the cultivated rice with all its numerous&nbsp;varieties has originated from a wild plant, called in India&nbsp;Newaree or Nivara, which is indigenous on the borders of lakes&nbsp;in the Circars and elsewhere in India, and is also native in tropical&nbsp;Australia. The rice plant is an annual grass with long linear&nbsp;glabrous leaves, each&nbsp;provided with a long&nbsp;sharply pointed ligule.&nbsp;The spikelets are borne&nbsp;on a compound or&nbsp;branched spike, erect&nbsp;at first but afterwards&nbsp;bent downwards.&nbsp;Each spikelet contains&nbsp;a solitary flower with&nbsp;two outer small barren&nbsp;glumes, above which&nbsp;is a large tough, compressed, often awned,&nbsp;flowering glume, which&nbsp;partly encloses the&nbsp;somewhat similar&nbsp;pale. Within these&nbsp;are six stamens, a&nbsp;hairy ovary surmounted&nbsp;by two feathery styles&nbsp;which ripens into the&nbsp;fruit (grain), and which&nbsp;is invested by the&nbsp;husk formed by the&nbsp;persistent glume and&nbsp;pale. The cultivated&nbsp;varieties are extremely&nbsp;numerous, some kinds&nbsp;being adapted for&nbsp;marshy land, others&nbsp;for growth on the hillsides. The cultivators&nbsp;make two principal&nbsp;divisions according· as&nbsp;the sorts are early or late. Rice has been cultivated&nbsp;from time immemorial in tropical countries. According to&nbsp;Stanislas Julien a ceremonial ordinance was established in China&nbsp;By the emperor Chin-nung 2800 years </span><span class="font0">B.C., </span><span class="font1">in accordance with&nbsp;which the emperor sows the rice himself while the seeds of four&nbsp;other kinds may be sown by the princes of his family. This fact,&nbsp;joined to other considerations, induced Alphonse de Candolle&nbsp;to consider rice as a native of China. It was very early cultivated&nbsp;in India, in some parts of which country, as in tropical Australia,&nbsp;it is, as we have seen, indigenous. It is not mentioned in the&nbsp;Bible, but its culture is alluded to in the Talmud. There is&nbsp;proof of its culture in the Euphrates valley and in Syria four&nbsp;hundred years before Christ. Crawfurd, on philological grounds,&nbsp;considers that rice was introduced into Persia from southern&nbsp;India. The Arabs carried the plant into Spain. Rice was&nbsp;first cultivated in Italy near Pisa in 1468. It was not introduced&nbsp;into S. Carolina until 1700, and then, it is said, by accident,&nbsp;although at one time the southern United States furnished a&nbsp;large proportion of the rice introduced into commerce. Rice&nbsp;sports into far more varieties than any of the corns familiar&nbsp;to Europeans; for some varieties grow in the water and some on&nbsp;dry land; some come to maturity in three months, while others&nbsp;take four and six months to do so. A very full account of the&nbsp;cultivation of rice in India will be found in Sir George Watt’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of the Economic Products of India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rice constitutes one of the most important articles of food in all tropical and subtropical countries, and is one of the most prolific&nbsp;of all crops. The rice yields best on low lands subject to occasional&nbsp;inundations, and thus enriched by alluvial deposits. An abundant&nbsp;rainfall during the growing season is also a desideratum. Rice is&nbsp;sown broadcast, and in some districts is transplanted after a fortnight or three weeks. No special rotation is followed: indeed the&nbsp;soil best suited for rice is ill adapted for any other crop. In some&nbsp;cases little manure is employed, but in others abundance of manure&nbsp;is used. No special tillage is required, but weeding and irrigation&nbsp;are requisite. Ricc in the husk is known as ” paddy.” On cutting&nbsp;across a grain of rice and examining it under the microscope, first the&nbsp;flattened and dried cells of the husk arc seen, and then one or two&nbsp;layers of cells elongated in a direction parallel to the length of the&nbsp;seed, which contain the gluten or nitrogenous matter. Within&nbsp;these, and forming by far the largest part of the seed, arc large&nbsp;polygonal cells filled with very numerous and very minute angular&nbsp;starch grains. Ricc is not so valuable as a food as some OthercereaIs<sub>l&nbsp;</sub>inasmuch as the proportion of nitrogenous matter (gluten) is less.&nbsp;Payen gives only 7% of gluten in nee as compared with 22% in&nbsp;the finest wheat, 14 in oats and 12 in maize. The percentage of&nbsp;potash in the ash is as 18 to 23 in wheat. The fatty matter is also&nbsp;less in proportion than in other cereals. Rice, therefore, is chiefly&nbsp;a farinaceous food, and requires to be combined with fatty and&nbsp;nitrogenous substances, such as milk or meat gravy, to satisfy&nbsp;the requirements of the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A large proportion of the rice brought to Europe is used for starch-making, and some is taken by distillers of alcohol. Rice&nbsp;is also -the source of a drinking spirit in India, known as arrack,&nbsp;and the national beverage of Japan—saké—-is prepared from the&nbsp;grain by means of an organic ferment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICE PAPER. The substance' which has received this name in Europe, through the mistaken notion that it is made&nbsp;from rice, consists of the pith of a small tree, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aralia papyrifera,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which grows in thc swampy forests of Formosa. The cylindrical&nbsp;core of pith is rolled on a hard flat surface against a knife, by&nbsp;which it is cut into thin sheets of a fine iVory-ljke texture.&nbsp;Dyed in various colours, rice paper is extensively used for the&nbsp;preparation of artificial flowers, while the white sheets are&nbsp;employed by native artists for water-colour drawings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RICH, BARNABE </span><span class="font1">(c. 1540-1617), English author and soldier, was a distant relative of Lord Chancellor Rich. He fought in&nbsp;the Low Countries, rising to the rank of captain, and afterwards&nbsp;served in Ireland. He shared in the colonization of Ulster,&nbsp;and spent the latter part of his life near Dublin. In the intervals&nbsp;of his campaigns he produced many pamphlets on political&nbsp;questions and romances. In 1606 he was in receipt of a pension&nbsp;of half a crown a day, and in 1616 he was presented with a gift&nbsp;of £100 as being the oldest captain in the service. He died on&nbsp;the roth of November 1617. Hjp best-known work is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Riche&nbsp;his Farewell to Militarie Profession Conteining verie pleasauni&nbsp;discourses fit for a peaceable tyme</span><span class="font1"> (1581). Of the eight stories&nbsp;contained in it, five, he says, “ are forged only for delight, neither&nbsp;credible to be believed, nor hurtful to be perused.” The three&nbsp;others are translations from the Italian. He claims as his&nbsp;own invention the story of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apolonius and Silla<sub>9</sub></span><span class="font1"> the second in&nbsp;the collection, from which Shakespeare took the plot of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Twelfth&nbsp;Night.</span><span class="font1"> It is, however, founded on the tale of Nicuola and&nbsp;Lattantio as told by Matteo Bandello. The eighth, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phylotus&nbsp;and Emilia,</span><span class="font1"> a complicated story arising from the likeness and&nbsp;disguise of a brother and sister, is identical in plot with the&nbsp;anonymous play, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philotus<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font1"> printed in Edinburgh in 1603. Both&nbsp;play and story were edited for the Bannatjme Club in 1835.&nbsp;In the conclusion to his collection Rich tells a story of a devil&nbsp;named Balthaser, who posscsses a king of Scots, prudently&nbsp;changed after the accession of James I. to the “ Grand Turk.”&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Strange and Wotiderful Adventures of Don Simonides</span><span class="font1"> (1581),&nbsp;with its sequel (1584), is written in imitation of Lyly. Among&nbsp;his -other romances should be mentioned </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of&nbsp;Brusanus, prince of Hungaria</span><span class="font1"> (1592). His authenticated works&nbsp;number twenty-four, and include works on Ireland, the troubles&nbsp;of which were, according to him, due to the religion of the&nbsp;people and to the lack of consistency and firmness on the part&nbsp;of the English government. Such are: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Allarme to England&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1578); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A New Description of Irelatui</span><span class="font1"> (1610); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Irish Hubbub,&nbsp;or the English Hue and Crie</span><span class="font1"> (1617), in which he also inveighs&nbsp;against the use of tobacco.</span></p>
