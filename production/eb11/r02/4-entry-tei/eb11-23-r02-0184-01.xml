                <p><label>RESPIRATORY SYSTEM</label> . (1). <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy</hi> —The
                    respiratory tract consists of the nasal cavities, the pharynx, the larynx, the
                    trachea, the bronchi and the lungs, but of these the two first parts have been
                    treated in separate articles (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Olfactory System</hi> and
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Pharynx).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">larynx</hi> is the upper part of the air tube which is
                    specially modified for the production of notes of varying pitch, though it is
                    not responsible for the whole of the voice. Its framework is made up of several
                    cartilages which are moved on one another by muscles, and it is lined internally
                    by mucous membrane which is continuous above with that of the pharynx and below
                    with that of the trachea or windpipe. The larynx is situated in the front of the
                    neck and corresponds to the. fourth, fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. For its
                    superficial anatomy see <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">thyroid cartilage</hi> (see fig. 1) is the largest, and
                    consists of two plates or <hi rend="italic">alae</hi> which are joined in the
                    mid-ventral line. At the upper part of their junction is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >thyroid notch</hi> and just below that is a forward projection, the <hi
                        rend="italic">pomum Adami,</hi> best marked in adult males. From the upper
                    part of the posterior border of each ala the <hi rend="italic">superior
                        cornu</hi> rises up to be joined to the tip of the great cornu of the hyoid
                    bone by the <hi rend="italic">lateral thy r ο-hy oid ligament,</hi> while from
                    the lower part of the same border the <hi rend="italic">inferior cornu</hi>
                    passes down to be fastened to the cricoid cartilage by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >crico-thyroid</hi> capsule. From the upper border of each ala the <hi
                        rend="italic">thyro-hyoid membrane</hi> runs up to the hyoid bone, while
                    near the back of the outer surface of each the <hi rend="italic">oblique line
                        of</hi>
               </p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">the thyroid cartilage</hi>
               </p>
               <p>runs downward and</p>
               <p>forward.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">cricoid cartilage</hi> (see figs, i and 2) is something
                    like a signet ring with the seal behind; its lower border, however, is
                    horizontal.</p>
               <p>To the mid-ventral part of its upper border is attached the mesial part of the
                        <hi rend="italic">crico - thyroid membrane,</hi> which attaches it ,to the
                    lower border? of the thyroid cartilage though the lateral parts of this membrane
                    pass up internally to the thyroid cartilage and their upper free edges form the
                    true <hi rend="italic">vocal cords.</hi> On the summit of the signet part of the
                    cricoid are placed the two <hi rend="italic">arytenoid cartilages</hi> (see fig.
                    2), each of which forms a pyramid with its apex upward and with an anterior
                    posterior and internal or mesial surface. The base articulates with the cricoid
                    by a concave facet, surrounded by the <hi rend="italic">crico-arytenoid
                        capsule,</hi> and the two arytenoids are able to glide toward or away from
                    one another, in addition to which each can rotate round a vertical axis. From
                    the front of the base a delicate process projects which, as it is attached to
                    the true vocaI cord, is called the <hi rend="italic">vocal process,</hi> while
                    from the outer part of the base another stouter process</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0185" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0208.jp2"/>
               <p>attaches the two crico-arytenoid muscles and so is known as tbe <hi
                        rend="italic">muscular process.</hi> Above each arytenoid are two smaller
                    cartilages known as the <hi rend="italic">Cornicula laryngis</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">cartilages of Santorini</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >cuneiform cartilages,</hi> but they are not of any practical importance.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">epiglottis</hi> (see fig. 3), on the other hand, is a very
                    important structure, since it forms a lid to the larynx in swallowing: only the
                    box moves up to the lid instead of the lid moving down to the box. It is
                    leafshaped, the stalk (thyro-epiglottid e a n ligament) being attached to the
                    junction of the thyroid cartilages inside the larynx, while the anterior surface
                    of the leaf is closely attached to the root of the tongue and body of the hyoid
                    bone. The posterior or laryngeal surface is pitted for glands, and near the
                    point where the stalk joins the leaf is a convexity which is known as the <hi
                        rend="italic">cushion of the epiglottis.</hi> All the cartilages of the
                    larynx are of the hyaline variety except fhe epiglottis, the corni-cula laryngis
                    and the cuneiform cartilages, which are yellow elastic. The result is that all
                    except these three tend to ossify as middle</p>
               <p>age is approached.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">muscles of the larynx</hi> are: (1) the <hi rend="italic"
                        >crico-thyroids,</hi> which are attached to the lower border of the thyroid
                    and the ^anterior part of the cricoid, by pulling up which they make the upper
                    part of the signet, with the arytenoids attached to it, move back and so tighten
                    the vocal cords. (2) The <hi rend="italic">thyro-arytenoids</hi> (see fig. 4),
                    which run back from the* junction of thé thyroid alae to the front of the
                    arytenoids and side of the epiglottis; they pull the arytenoids toward the
                    thyroid and so relax the cords.</p>
               <p>(3) The single <hi rend="italic">arytenoideus</hi> muscle, which runs from the
                    back of one arytenoid to the other and approximates these cartilages.</p>
               <p>(4) The <hi rend="italic">lateral crico-arytenoids</hi> (see fig. 4) which draw
                    the muscular processes of the arytenoids forward toward the ring of the cricoid
                    and, by so doing, twist the vocal processes, with the cords attached, inward
                    toward one another; and (5) the <hi rend="italic">posterior
                        crico-arytenoids</hi> (see fig. 4) which run from the back of the signet
                    part of the cricoid to the back of the muscular processes of the arytenoid and,
                    by pulling these backward, twist the vocal processes outward and so separate the
                    vocal cords. All these muscles are supplied by the recurrent laryngeal nerve,
                    except the crico-thyroid which is innervated by the external branch of the
                    superior laryngeal (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Nerves,</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Cranial).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">mucous membrane of the larynx</hi> is continuous with that
                    of the pharynx at the <hi rend="italic">aryteno-epiglottidean folds</hi> which
                    run from the sides of the epiglottis to the top of the arytenoid cartilages (see
                    (fig· 3)· To the outer side of each fold is the <hi rend="italic">sinus
                        pyriformis</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pharynx).</hi> From the middle of
                    the junction of the alae of the thyroid cartilage to the vocal processes of the
                    arytenoids the mucous membrane is reflected over, and closely bound to, the true
                    vocal cords which contain elastic tissue and, as has been mentioned, are the
                    upper free edges of the lateral parts of the crico-thyroid membrane. The chink
                    between the two true vocal cords is the <hi rend="italic">glottis</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">rima gloîtiais.</hi> Just above the true vocal cords is the
                    opening into a recess on each side which runs upward and backward and is known
                    as the <hi rend="italic">laryngeal saccule;</hi> its opening is the <hi
                        rend="italic">laryngeal sinus.</hi> The upper lip of this slit-like opening
                    is called the <hi rend="italic">false vocal cord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The mucous membrane is closely bound down to the epiglottis and to the true
                    vocal cords, elsewhere there is plenty of submucous tissue in which the products
                    of inflammation may collect and cause “ oedema laryngis,” a condition which is
                    mechanically prevented from passing the true vocal cords. In tbe upper part of
                    the front and sides of the larynx and over the true vocal cords the mucous
                    membrane is lined by squamous epithelium, but elsewhere the epithelium is of the
                    columnar ciliated variety: it is supplied by the superior laryngeal branch of
                    the vagus nerve and above the glottis is peculiarly sensitive.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Trachea</hi> or windpipe (see fig. 5) is the tube which
                    carries the air between the larynx and the bronchi; it is from four to four and
                    a half inches long and lies partly in the neck and partly in the thorax. It
                    begins where the larynx ends at the lower border of the sixth cervical, and
                    divides into its two bronchi opposite the fifth thoracic vertebra. The tube is
                    kept always open by rings of cartilage, which, however, are wanting behind, and,
                    as it passes down, it comes to lie farther and farther from the ventral surface
                    of the body, following the concavity of the thoracic region of the spinal
                    column. In the whole of its downward course it has the oesophagus close behind
                    it, while in front are the isthmus of the thyroid, the left innominate vein, the
                    innominate artery and the arch of the aorta. On each side of it and touching it
                    is the vagus nerve.</p>
               <p>The cervical part of the tube is not much more than an inch in length, but it
                    can be lengthened by throwing back the head. This, of course, is the region in
                    which tracheotomy is performed, and it should be remembered that in children,
                    and sometimes in adults, the great left innominate vein lies above the level of
                    the top of the sternum.</p>
               <p>In transverse section the trachea is rather wider from side to side than from
                    before backward. In life the former measurement is said to be about 12-5 mm. and
                    the latter n mm. It is made up of an external fibro-clastic membrane in which
                    the cartilaginous rings lie, while behind, where these rings are wanting, is a
                    layer of unstripcd muscle which, when it contracts,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0186" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0209.jp2"/>
               <p>draws the hind ends of the rings together and so diminishes the calibre of the
                    tube. Inside these is plentiful submücous tissue</p>
               <p>containing mucous glands and quantities of lymphoid tissue, while the whole is
                    lined internally by columnar ciliated epithelium.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Bronchi</hi> (see fig. 5) are the two tubes into which the
                    trachea divides, but, since the branches, which these tubes give off later, are
                    also called bronchi, it may be clearer to speak of primary, secondary and
                    tertiary bronchi. Each primary bronchus runs downward and outward, but the right
                    one is more in a line with the direction of the trachea than the left. The right
                    primary bronchus has also a greater calibre than the left because the right lung
                    is the larger, and for these two reasons when a foreign body enters the trachea
                    it usually enters the right bronchus.</p>
               <p>The first secondary bronchus comes off about an inch from the bifurcation of the
                    trachea on the right side and, as it lies above the level of the pulmonary
                    artery, it is known as the <hi rend="italic">eparterial bronchus.</hi> On the
                    left side the first branch is about two inches from the bifurcation and, like
                    all the remaining secondary bronchi, is hyparterial: the left primary bronchus
                    is therefore twice as long as the right. After the eparterial secondary bronchus
                    is given off the direction of the right primary bronchus is carried on by the
                    hyparterial secondary bronchus,</p>
               <p>and this, just before reaching tbe hilum of the lung, divides into upper and
                    lower tertiary bronchi, while the left lower secondary hyparterial bronchus does
                    not divide before reaching the hilum of its lung. Into the hilum or root of the
                    right lung, therefore, three bronchial tubes enter, while on the left side there
                    are only two. The firmly rooted habit of associating tbe term bronchi with those
                    parts of the main tubes which lie between the bifurcation of the trachea and the
                    point where the first branch comes off makes it very difficult to suggest a
                    nomenclature which calls up any picture of the actual state of things to the
                    mind. Certainly the classification into primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi
                    only goes a very little way toward this, and it should be realized that, call
                    them what we may, there are two long tapering tubes which run from the
                    bifurcation of the trachea to the lower and back part of each lung, and give off
                    a series of large ventral and small dorsal branches. The upper part of each of
                    these long tubes or <hi rend="italic">stem bronchi</hi> is outside the lung and
                    in the middle mediastinum of the thorax, the lower part embedded in the
                    substance of the lung. The structure of the bronchi is practically identical
                    with that of the trachea. (See G. S. Huntington’s “ Eparterial Bronchial System
                    of the Mammalia,” <hi rend="italic">Am. Journ. Med. Sci.</hi> (Phila. 1898). See
                    alsa Quain’s <hi rend="italic">Anatomy,</hi> London, last edition.)</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Lungs</hi> are two pyramidal, spongy, slate-coloured, very
                    vascular organs in which the blood is oxygenated. Each lies in its own side of
                    the thorax and is surrounded by its own pleural cavity (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Coelom</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Serous Membranes),</hi> and has an <hi
                        rend="italic">apex</hi> which projects into the side of the root of the
                    neck, a <hi rend="italic">base</hi> which is hollowed for the convexity of the
                    diaphragm, an outer surface which is convex and lies against the ribs, an inner
                    surface concave for the heart, pericardium and great vessels, a sharp anterior
                    border which overlaps the pericardium and a broad, rounded posterior border
                    which lies at the side of the spinal column. Each lung is nearly divided into
                    two by a <hi rend="italic">primary fissure</hi> which runs obliquely downward
                    and forward, while the right lung has a <hi rend="italic">secondary fissure</hi>
                    Avhich runs horizontally forward from near the middle of the primary fissure.
                    Tbe left lung has therefore an <hi rend="italic">upper</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">lower or basal lobe,</hi> while the right has <hi
                        rend="italic">upper, middle</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lower lobes.</hi> On
                    the inner surface of each lung is the <hi rend="italic">root</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Jtilum</hi> at which alone its vessels, nerves and ducts
                    (bronchi) can enter and leave it. Tbe structures-contained in the root of each
                    lung are the branches and tributaries of (1) the <hi rend="italic">pulmonary

                    cut, then the arteries and last the bronchi. As has been pointed out already,
                    the eparterial bronchus on the right side is above the level of the artery, but
                    all the others (hyparterial) are on a lower level.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">bronchial arteries</hi> supply the substance of the lung;,
                    there are usually two on each side, and they lie behind the bronchi. The blood
                    which they carry is chiefly returned by the pulmonary veins bringing oxidized
                    blood back to tbe heart, so that here there is a normal and harmless mixture of
                    arterial and venous blood. If there are any <hi rend="italic">bronchial
                        veins</hi> (their presence is doubted by some, and the writer has himself
                    carefully but unsuccessfully searched for them several times), they open into
                    the azygos veins of their own side. The <hi rend="italic">bronchial lymphatic
                        vessels</hi> lie behind the pulmonary vessels and open into several large
                    glands which are black from straining off tbe carbon left in the lungs from the
                    atmosphere.</p>
               <p>There is an <hi rend="italic">anterior</hi> and <hi rend="italic">posterior
                        pulmonary plexus of nerves</hi> on each side, the fibres of which are
                    derived from tbe vagus and the upper thoracic ganglia of tbe sympathetic.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Structure of the Lungs.—</hi> As the bronchi become smaller
                    and smaller by repeated division, the cartilage completely surrounds them and
                    tends to form irregular plates instead of rings—they are therefore
                    cylindrical,but when the terminal branches <hi rend="italic">(lobular
                        bronchi)</hi> are reached, the cartilage disappears and hemispherical
                    bulgings called alveoli occur (fig. 6 A). At the very end of</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0187" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0210.jp2"/>
               <p>each lobular bronchus is an irregular chamber, the <hi rend="italic">atrium</hi>
                    (fig. 6 At), and from this a number of thin-walled sacs, about i mm. in
                    diameter, open out. These are called the <hi rend="italic">infundibula</hi>
                    (fig. 6 I), and their walls are pouched by hemispherical air-cells or alveoli
                    like those in the lobular bronchi. Each lobular bronchus with its atrium and
                    infundibula forms what is known as a <hi rend="italic">lobule</hi> of the lung,
                    and these lobules are separated by connective tissue, and their outlines are
                    evident on the surface of the lung.</p>
               <p>The muscular tissue, which in the larger tubes was confined to the dorsal part,
                    forms a complete layer in the smaller; but when the lobular bronchi are reached,
                    it stops and the mucous membrane is surrounded by the elastic layer. In the
                    lobular bronchi, too, the lining epithelium gradually changes from the ciliated
                    to the stratified or pavement variety, and this is the only kind which is found
                    in the infundibula and alveoli. Surrounding each alveolus is a plexus of
                    capillary vessels so rich that the spaces between the capillaries are no wider
                    than .the eapillaries themselves, and it is here that the exchange of gases
                    takes place between the air and the blood.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Embryology.—</hi> The respiratory system is developed from the
                    ventral surface of the forcgut as a long gutter-like pouch which reaches from
                    just behind the rudiment of the tongue to the stomach. Limiting the anterior or
                    cephalic end of this is a Π-shaped elevation in the ventral wall of the pharynx
                    which separates the ventral ends of the third and fourth visceral bars and is
                    known as <hi rend="italic">Ùu: furcula*,</hi> it is from this that the
                    epiglottis, aryteno-epiglottidean folds and arytenoid cartilages are developed.
                    Later on the respiratory tube is separated from the digestive by two ridges, one
                    on each side, which, uniting, form a transverse partition. In the region of the
                    furcula, however, the partition stops and here the two tubes communicate. The
                    caudal end of the respiratory tube buds out .into the two primary bronchi, and
                    the right one of these, later on, bears three buds, while the left has only two;
                    these are the secondary bronchi, which keep on dividing into two, one branch
                    keeping the line of the parent stem to form the stem bronchus, while the other
                    goes off at an angle. By the repeated divisions of these tubes the complex “
                    bronchial tree ” is formed and from the terminal shoots the infundibula bud out.
                    The alveoli only develop in the last three months of foetal life. The thyroid
                    cartilage is probably formed from the fourth and fifth branchial bars, while the
                    cricoid seems to be the enlarged first ring of the trachea. Before birth the
                    lungs are solid and much less vascular than after breathing is established.
                    Their slaty colour is gradually gained from the deposit of carbon from the
                    atmosphere. (For further details see Quain’s <hi rend="italic">Anatomy,</hi>
                    vol. i., Lond. 1908.)</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Comparative Anatomy.—</hi> It has been shown (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Pharynx)</hi> that in the lower vertebrates respiration is
                    brought about by the blood vessels surrounding the gill clefts. In the higher
                    fishes (Ganoids and Teleosteans) the “ <hi rend="italic">swim bladder</hi> ”
                    appears as a diverticulum from the dorsal wall of the alimentary canal, and its
                    duct <hi rend="italic">(d. pneumaticus)</hi> sometimes remains open and at
                    others becomes a solid cord. In the former case it is probable that the blood is
                    to some extent oxidized in the vascular wall of this bladder. In the Dipnoi
                    (mud-fish) the opening of the swim bladder shifts to the ventral side of the
                    pharynx and the bladder walls become sacculated and very vascular, so that, when
                    the rivers are dried up, the fish can breathe altogether by means of it. In the
                    S. American and African species of mud-fish the bladder or lung, as it may now
                    be called, is divided by a longitudinal septum in its posterior (caudal) part
                    into right and left halves. In this sub-class of Dipnoi, therefore, a general
                    agreement is seen with the embryology or ontogeny of Man’s lungs. In the
                    Amphibia the two lungs are quite separate though they are mere sacculated bags
                    without bronchi. A trachea, however, appears in some species <hi rend="italic"
                        >(e.g.</hi> Siren) and a definite larynx with arytenoid cartilages, vocal
                    cords and complicated muscles is established in the Anura (frogs and toads). In
                    most of the Reptilia the bag-like lungs are elaborated into spongy organs with
                    arborizing bronchi in their interior. From the crocodiles upward a main or stem
                    bronchus passes to the caudal end of the lung, and from this the branches or
                    lateral bronchi come off. The larynx shows little advance on that of the Anura.</p>
               <p>The respiratory organs of birds are highly specialized. The larynx is
                    rudimentary, and sound is produced by the <hi rend="italic">syrinx,</hi> a
                    secondary larynx at the bifurcation of the trachea; this may be tracheal,
                    bronchial or, most often, tracheo-branchial. The lungs are small and closely
                    connected with the ribs, while from them numerous large air sacs extend among
                    the viscera, muscles and into many of the bones, which, by being filled with hot
                    air, help to maintain the high temperature and lessen the specific gravity of
                    the body. This pneumaticity of the bones is to a certain extent reproduced by
                    the air sinuses of the skull in crocodiles and mammals, and it must be pointed
                    out that the amount of air fn the bones does not necessarily correspond with the
                    power of flight, for the Ratitae (ostriches and emeus) have very pneumatic
                    bones, while in the sea-gulls they are hardly pneumatic at all.</p>
               <p>In mammals the thjToid cartilage becomes an important element in the larynx, and
                    in the Echidna the’upper and lower parts of it, derived respectively from the
                    fourth and fifth branchial bars, are separate (R. H. Burne, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Journ. Anat. and Phys,</hi> xxxviii. p. xxvii.). The whole larynx is much
                    nearer the head than in Man, and in young animals the epiglottis is
                    intra-narial, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> projects up behind the soft palate.
                    This prevents the milk trickling into the larynx during suckling, and is
                    especially well seen in the Marsupials and Cetacea, though evidences of it are
                    present in the human embryo. In the lower mammals an inter-arytenoid cartilage
                    is very frequent (see J. Symington, “The Marsupial Larynx,” <hi rend="italic">J.
                        Anal, and Phys.</hi> xxxiii. 31, also “ The Monotreme Larynx,” <hi
                        rend="italic">ib.</hi> xxxiv. 90).</p>
               <p>The lungs show a good deal of variation in their lobulation; among the
                    porcupines as many as forty lobes have been counted in the right lung, while in
                    other mammals no lobulation at all could be made out. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >azygous lobe</hi> of the right lung is a fairly constant structure and is
                    situated between the post-caval vein and the oesophagus. It is supplied by the
                    terminal branch of the right stem bronchus and, although it is usually absent in
                    Man, the bronchus which should have supplied it is always to be found. (F; G.
                    P.)</p>
               <p>(2) <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So far as is known, the intake of oxygen, either free or combined, and the
                    output of carbon dioxide, are an essential part of the life of all organisms.
                    The two processes are so closely associated with one another that they arc
                    always included together under the designation of respiration, which may thus be
                    defined as the physiological process which is concerned in the intake of oxygen
                    and output of carbon dioxide. According to the evidence at present available, it
                    is only within living cells that the respiratory oxygen is consumed and the
                    carbon dioxide formed. the mere conveying of oxygen from the surrounding air or
                    water to these cells, and of carbon dioxide from them to the air or water, is,
                    however,'in itself a complex process in the higher animals; and accordingly an
                    account of animal respiration naturally falls into two divisions, the first of
                    which (I.) is concerned with the manner in which oxygen and carbon dioxide are
                    conveyed to and from the living tissues, and the second (II.) with the
                    consumption of oxygen and formation of carbon dioxide by the living tissues
                    themselves..</p>
               <p>I. In all the more highly organized animals there are special respiratory
                    organs: the lungs in the higher vertebrates; the gills in fishes; lhe tracheae
                    in insects; and various rudimentary forms of lungs or gills in other higher
                    invertebrates. In the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0188" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0211.jp2"/>
               <p>present article attention will be specially confined to the case of the higher
                    vertebrates, and in particular to man.</p>
               <p>Air is brought into the lungs by the movements of breathing (see above, <hi
                        rend="italic">Movements of Respiration).</hi> Oxygen from this air passes
                    through the delicate lining membrane of the air-celIs of the lungs into the
                    blood, where it enters into loose chemical combination with the haemoglobin of
                    the red corpuscles (see Blood). In this form it is conveyed onwards to the
                    heart, and thence through the arteries to the capillaries, where it again parts
                    from the haemoglobin, and passes through the capillary walls to the tissues,
                    where it is consumed. Carbon dioxide passes out from the tissues into the blood
                    in a corresponding manner, enters into loose combination as bicarbonate, and
                    possibly in other ways, in the blood, and is conveyed by the veins to the lungs,
                    whence it passes out in the expired air. Pure atmospheric air contains 20-93% of
                    oxygen, -03% of carbon dioxide and 79-04% of nitrogen (with which is mixed about
                    0.9% of argon). The dried expired air in man contains about 3-5% of carbon
                    dioxide and 17% of oxygen, so that roughly speaking the carbon dioxide is
                    increased by about 3-5% and the oxygen diminished by 4%. Expired air as it
                    leaves the body contains about 6% of moisture, compared with usually about 1 %
                    in the inspired air. The added moisture and higher temperature of expired air
                    make it decidedly lighter than pure air.</p>
               <p>Owing to the unpleasant effects often produced in badly ventilated rooms it was
                    for Iong supposed that some poisonous volatile “ organic matter ” is also given
                    off in the breath. Careful investigation has shown that this is not the case.
                    The unpleasant effects are partly due to heat and moisture, and partly to odours
                    which are usually not of respiratory origin. The carbon dioxide present in the
                    air of even very badly ventilated rooms is present in far too small proportions
                    to have any sensible effect.</p>
               <p>The average volume of air inspired per minute by healthy adult men during rest
                    is about 7 litres or *25 cub. ft. In different individuals the frequency of
                    breathing varies considerably—from about 7 to 25 per minute, the depth of each
                    breath varying about inversely as the frequency. During muscular work the volume
                    of air breathed may be six or eight times as much as during rest. The volume of
                    carbon dioxide given off varies from about half a cubic foot per hour during
                    complete rest to 5 cub. ft. during severe exertion, but averages about 0*9 cub.
                    ft. per hour, and will reach or exceed 1 cub. ft. per hour during even very
                    light exertion. The voIume of oxygen consumed is about a seventh greater than
                    that of the carbon dioxide given off.</p>
               <p>The breathing is regulated from a nervous centre situated in the medulla
                    oblongata, which is the lowest part of the brain. If this centre is destroyed or
                    injured the breathing stops and death rapidly results. From the respiratory
                    centre rhythmic efferent impulses proceed down the motor nerves supplying the
                    diaphragm, intercostals and other respiratory muscles. Afferent impulses through
                    various nerves may temporarily affect the rhythm of the respiratory centre. Of
                    these afferent impulses by far the most important are those which proceed up the
                    vagus nerve from the lungs themselves. On distention of the lungs with air the
                    inspiratory impulses from the respiratory centre are suddenly arrested or “
                    inhibited ”; on the Otherhand, collapse of the lung strongly excites to
                    inspiratory effort. On section of the vagus nerve these effects disappear, and
                    the breathing becomes less frequent and much more laboured. The vagus nerve is
                    thus the carrier of both inhibitory and exciting stimuli.</p>
               <p>As the physiological function of breathing is to bring oxygen to and remove
                    carbon dioxide from the blood, it would naturally be expected that breathing
                    would be regulated in accordance with the amount of oxygen required and of
                    carbon dioxide formed; but until quite recently the actual mode of regulation
                    was by no means clear. It was commonly .supposed that afferent nervous impulses
                    in some way regulated the otherwise automatic action of the centre, want of
                    oxygen or excess of</p>
               <p>CO <hi rend="sub">2</hi> in the blood being only an occasional and relatively
                    unimportant factor in the regulations. The phenomenon of “apnoea” or complete
                    cessation of natural breathing which occurs after forced breathing, was
                    attributed mainIy to the already mentioned distension effect through the vagus
                    nerves. To go further back still, it was even supposed that the rate and depth
                    of breathing, and the percentage of oxygen in the inspired air, determine the
                    consumption of oxygen and formation of carbon dioxide in the body, just as the
                    air-supply to a fire determines the rate of its combustion. This oId belief is
                    still often met with—for instance, in the reasons given for recommending “
                    breathing exercises ” as a part of physical training.</p>
               <p>It is evident that if the breathing did not increase correspondingly with the
                    greatly increased consumption of oxygen and formation of CO <hi rend="sub"
                        >2</hi> which occurs, for instance during muscular work, the percentage of
                    oxygen in the air contained in the lung cells or alveoli (alveolar air) would
                    rapidIy fall, and the percentage of carbon dioxide increase. The inevitable
                    result would be a very imperfect aeration of the blood. Investigation of the
                    alevolar air has furnished the key to the actual regulation of breathing.
                    Samples of this air can be obtained by making a sudden and deep expiration
                    through a piece of long tube, and at once collecting some of the air contained
                    in the part of this tube nearest the mouth. By this means it has been found that
                    dining normal breathing at ordinary atmospheric pressure the percentage of
                    carbon dioxide (about 5-6% on an average for men) is constant for each
                    individual, though different persons vary slightly as regards their normal
                    percentage. The breathing is thus so regulated as to keep the percentage of
                    carbon dioxide constant; and under normal conditions this regulation is
                    surprisingly exact. The ordinary expired air is a mixture of aIveolar air and
                    air from the “ dead space ” in the air passages. The deeper the breathing
                    happens to bc, the more alveoIar air there will be in the expired air, and the
                    higher, therefore, the percentage of carbon dioxide in it, so that the expired
                    air is not constant in composition, though the alveolar air is. If air
                    containing 2 or 3 % of carbon dioxide is breathed, the breathing at once becomes
                    deeper, in such a way as to prevent anything but a very slight rise in the
                    alveolar carbon dioxide percentage. The difference is scarcely appreciable
                    subjectively, except during muscular exertion. The effect of 1% of carbon
                    dioxide in the inspired air is so slight as to be negligible, and there is no
                    foundation for the popular belief that even very small percentages of carbon
                    dioxide are injurious. With 4 or 5 % or more of carbon dioxide, however, much
                    panting is produced, and the alveolar carbon dioxide percentage begins to rise
                    appreciably, since compensation is no longer possible. As a consequence,
                    headache and other symptoms are produced. If, on the other hand, the percentage
                    of carbon dioxide in the alveolar air is abnormally reduced by forced breathing,
                    the condition of apnoea is produced and lasts until the percentage again rises
                    to normal, but no longer. Forced breathing with air containing more than about
                    4% of carbon dioxide causes no apnoea, as the alveolar carbon dioxide does not
                    fall.</p>
               <p>If oxygen is breathed instead of air there is no appreciable change in the
                    percentage of carbon dioxide in the alveolar air, and no tendency towards
                    apnoea. Want of oxygen is thus not a factor in the regulation of normal
                    breathing. During muscular work the depth and frequency of breathing increase in
                    such a way as to prevent the alveolar carbon dioxide from rising more than very
                    slightly. It is still the carbon dioxide stimulus that regulates the breathing,
                    although with excessive muscular work other accessory factors may come in to
                    some extent.</p>
               <p>Under increased barometric pressure the percentage 'of carbon dioxide in <hi
                        rend="sub">x</hi> the aIveolar air no longer remains constant; it diminishes
                    in proportion to the increase of pressure. For instance, at a ‘pressure of 2
                    atmospheres it is reduced to half, and at 6 atmospheres to a sixth; while at
                    less than normal atmospheric pressure it rises correspondingly unless symptoms
                    of want of oxygen begin to interfere with this rise. These results show that it
                    is not the mere percentage, but the pressure (or “ partiaI pressure ”) of carbon
                    dioxide in the</p>

               <p>alveolar air that regulates breathing. The pressure exercised by the carbon
                    dioxide in the alveolar air is of course proportional to its percentage,
                    multiplied by the total atmospheric pressure. It follows from this law that at a
                    pressure of 6 atmospheres i % of carbon dioxide in the inspired air would have
                    the same violent effect as 6% at the normal pressure of i atmosphere. To take a
                    concrete practical application, if a diver whose head was just below water were
                    supplied with sufficient air to keep the carbon dioxide percentage in the air of
                    his helmet down to 3 % at most, he would be quite comfortable. But if, with the
                    same air supply as measured at surface, he went down to a depth of 170 ft.,
                    where the pressure is 6 atmospheres, he would at once experience great distress
                    culminating in loss of consciousness, owing, not to the pressure of the water,
                    which has trifling effects, but to the pressure of carbon dioxide in the air he
                    was breathing. The air supply must be increased in proportion to the increase of
                    pressure if these effects are to be avoided, and ignorance of this has led to
                    the common failure of diving work at considerable depths.</p>
               <p>The foregoing facts enable us to understand the regulation of breathing under
                    normal conditions. The pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveolar air evidently
                    determines that of the carbon dioxide in the arterial blood, and the latter in
                    its turn determines the carbon dioxide pressure in the respiratory centre, which
                    is very richly supplied with blood. The centre itself is extremely sensitive to
                    the slightest increase or diminution in carbon dioxide pressure; and thus it is
                    that the alveolar carbon dioxide pressure is so important. That the stimulus of
                    carbon dioxide is from the blood and not through nerves is proved by many
                    experiments. The function of the vagus nerves in regulating the breathing is
                    apparently to, as it were, guide the centre in the expenditure of each separate
                    inspiratory or expiratory effort; for as soon as inspiration or expiration is
                    completed the inspiratory or expiratory effort is cut short by impulse
                    proceeding up the vagus nerve, and much waste of muscular work and risk of
                    injury to the lungs is thereby prevented.</p>
               <p>Under ordinary conditions the regulation of carbon dioxide pressure in the
                    alveolar air ensures at the same time a normal pressure of oxygen, since
                    absorption of oxygen and giving off of carbon dioxide normally run parallel to
                    one another. If, however, air containing abnormally little oxygen is breathed,
                    the normal relation between oxygen and carbon dioxide in the alveolar air is
                    disturbed. A similar state of affairs is brought about by any considerable
                    diminution of atmospheric pressure. Not only does the partial pressure of oxygen
                    in the inspired air fall, but this fall is proportionally much greater in the
                    alveolar air; and the effects of want of oxygen depend on its partial pressure
                    in the alveolar air. It has been known for long that any great deficiency in the
                    proportion of oxygen in the air breathed increases the depth and frequency of
                    the breathing; but this effect is not apparent until the percentage of oxygen or
                    the barometric pressure is reduced by more than a third, which corresponds to a
                    reduction of more than half in the alveolar oxygen pressure. In contrast with
                    this an increase of a fiftieth in the alveolar carbon dioxide pressure has a
                    marked effect on the breathing. Along with the increased breathing caused by
                    deficiency of oxygen there is more or less blueness of the skin and abnormal
                    effects of various kinds, such as partial loss of sensibility, memory and power
                    of thinking. Long exposure often causes headache, nausea, sleeplessness,
                    &amp;c.— a train of symptoms knowrn to mountaineers as “ mountain sickness.”
                    That the primary cause of “ mountain sickness ” is lack of oxygen owing to the
                    low atmospheric pressure there is not the slightest doubt. Lack of oxygen is
                    thus not only an important, but also an abnormal form of stimulus to the
                    respiratory centre, since it is accompanied by quite abnormal symptoms. A
                    further analysis of the special effect of lack of oxygen on the respiratory
                    centre has shown that this effect still depends on the partial pressure of
                    carbon dioxide in the alveolar air. The lack of oxygen appears, in fact, to have
                    simply increased the sensitiveness of the centre to carbon dioxide, so that a
                    lower partial pressure of carbon dioxide excites the centre, and the breathing
                    is correspondingly increased. By prolonged forced breathing so much carbon
                    dioxide is washed out of the body that the subsequent apnoea lasts until the
                    oxygen in the alveolar air is nearly exhausted. The subject of the experiment
                    becomes very blue in the face and is partially stupefied by want of oxygen
                    before he has any desire to breathe. The probable explanation of these facts is
                    that want of oxygen does not itself excite the centre, but that some substance—
                    very probably lactic acid, which is known to be formed abundantly —is produced
                    abnormally in the body during exposure to want of oxygen and aids the carbon
                    dioxide in exciting the centre. Itis known that the blood becomes less alkaline
                    at high altitudes, and that acids in general excite the centre. A person on a
                    high mountain thus gets out of breath much more easily than at sea-level. The
                    extra stimulus to the centre during work still comes from the extra carbon
                    dioxide formed, but has a greater effect than usual on the breathing. If the
                    extra stimulus came directly from want of oxygen the person on the mountain
                    would probably turn blueand !Oseconsciousnessontheslightestexertion. By
                    analysing the alveolar air it can be shown that after a time even a height of
                    5000 to 6000 ft., or a diminution of only a sixth in the barometric pressure,
                    distinctly increases the sensitiveness of the respiratory centre to carbon
                    dioxide, so that there seems to be a slow accumulation of acid in the blood. The
                    effect also passes off very slowly on returning to normal pressure, although the
                    lack of oxygen is at once removed.</p>
               <p>The blueness of the skin (“ cyanosis ”) produced by lack of oxygen is due to the
                    fact that the haemoglobin of the red corpuscles is imperfectly saturated with
                    oxygen. Haemoglobin which is fully saturated with oxygen has a bright red
                    colour, contrasting with the blue colour which it assumes when deprived of
                    oxygen. According to the existing evidence the saturation of the haemoglobin is
                    practically complete under normal conditions in the lungs, or when thoroughly
                    shaken at the body temperature and normal atmospheric pressure with air of the
                    same composition as normal alveolar air. As the partial pressure of the oxygen
                    in this air falls, however, the saturation of the haemoglobin becomes less and
                    less complete, and the arterial blood assumes a more and more blue tinge, which
                    imparts a blue or leaden colour to the skin, accompanied by the symptoms,
                    already referred to, of lack of oxygen. Normal arteriaI blood in man yields
                    about 19 volumes of physiologically available oxygen for each 100 volumes of
                    blood. Of these 19 volumes about 18 j are loosely combined with the haemoglobin
                    of the red corpuscles, the small remainder being in simple solution in the
                    blood. Venous blood, on the other hand, yields only about 12 volumes. The
                    combination of haemoglobin with oxygen is only stable in the presence of free
                    oxygen at a pressure of about that in normal ah'eolar air. As this pressure
                    falls the compound is progressively dissociated. From this it can be readily
                    understood why the blood loses its oxygen in passing through the tissues, which
                    are constantly absorbing free oxygen, and regains it in the lungs. The marked
                    effects produced by abnormal deficiency in the pressure of oxygen in the
                    alveolar air are also readily intelligible; for even although the arterial blood
                    still contains sufficient oxygen to cover the normal difference between the
                    oxygen content of arterial and that of venous blood, yet this oxygen is given
                    off to the tissues less readily— <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> at a lower
                    pressure, and thus fails to supply their demands completely. It is evident also
                    that in pure air at normal pressure increased ventilation of the lungs does not
                    appreciably increase the supply of oxygen to the blood, whereas in air largely
                    deprived of its oxygen, or at low pressure, the increased alveolar oxygen
                    pressure produced by deep breathing helps greatly in saturating the blood with
                    oxygen, and may thus relieve the symptoms of want of oxygen. Hence it is that
                    the increased sensitiveness of the respiratory centre to carbon dioxide, and
                    consequent increased depth of breathing, at high altitudes compensates to a
                    large extent for deficiency in the oxygen pressure. Addition of carbon dioxide
                    to the inspired air produces exactly the same result. Indeed</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0190" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0213.jp2"/>
               <p>Professor Angelo Mosso was led by observation of'the beneficial effects of
                    carbon dioxide at low atmospheric pressure to attribute mountain sickness to
                    lack of carbon dioxide, a condition which he designated by the word “ acapnia. ”
                    When impure air is vitiated, not only by deficiency of oxygen, but also by
                    carbon dioxide, the carbon dioxide causes panting, which not only gives warning
                    of any danger, but prevents the alveolar oxygen percentage from falling in the
                    way it would do if the carbon dioxide were absent. In this way the carbon
                    dioxide greatly lessens the danger. To give instances, air progressively and
                    very highly vitiated by respiration is much less likely to cause danger if the
                    carbon dioxide is not artificially absorbed, and not nearly so dangerous as the
                    great diminution of atmospheric pressure (and consequently of oxygen pressure)
                    which occurs in a very high balloon ascent. Indeed the dangers of a very high
                    balloon ascent are notorious, and a number of deaths or very narrow escapes are
                    on record.</p>
               <p>Just as oxygen forms a dissociable compound with the haemoglobin of the blood,
                    so does carbon dioxide form dissociable compounds. One of* these compounds
                    appears to be with haemoglobin itself, and another is sodium bicarbonate, which
                    is far more easily dissociated in the blood than in a simple watery solution,
                    owing to the presence of proteid and possibly other substances which act as weak
                    acids and thus help the dissociation process. The whole of the carbon dioxide
                    can therefore be removed from the blood by a vacuum pump, just as pie whole of
                    the oxygen can. Venous blood contains roughly speaking about 40 volumes of
                    carbon dioxide per 100 of blood, and arterial blood about 34 volumes. Of this
                    carbon dioxide only about 3 volumes can be in free solution, the rest being
                    loosely combined. The conveyance of carbon dioxide from the blood to the lungs
                    is thus readily intelligible, as well as the fact that any increase or
                    diminution of the pressure of carbon dioxide in the alveolar air will naturally
                    lead to a damming back or increased liberation of carbon dioxide from the blood,
                    and that by forced breathing carbon dioxide can be washed out of the blood to
                    such an extent that a prolonged cessation of natural breathing <hi rend="italic"
                        >(apnoea)</hi> follows, since even in the venous blood the partial pressure
                    of carbon dioxide has become too low to excite the Tespiratoiy <hi rend="sup"
                        >r</hi> centre.</p>
               <p>It will be evident from the foregoing that in order to supply efficiently the
                    respiratory requirements of the tissues not only must the breathing, but also
                    the circulation, be suitably regulated. In hard muscular work the consumption of
                    oxygen and output of carbon dioxide may be increased eight or ten times beyond
                    those of rest. Unless, therefore, the blood supply to the active tissues were
                    correspondingly increased, deficiency of oxygen would at once arise, since the
                    amount of oxygen carried by a given volume of the arterial blood is very
                    limited, as already explained. It is known that the supply of blood to each
                    organ is always increased during its activity. This increase can, for instance,
                    readily be seen and measured in the case of contracting muscles or secreting
                    glands; and the volume and frequency of the pulse are greatly increased during
                    muscular work. But while it is evident enough that the flow of blood through the
                    body is determined in accordance with the metabolic activities of each tissue,
                    our knowledge is as yet very scanty as to the means by which this determination
                    is brought about. Probably, however, carbon dioxide may be nearly as important a
                    factor in the regulation of the circulation as in that of breathing. Just as the
                    rate of breathing was formerly. supposed to determine, and not to be determined
                    by, the fundamental metabolic processes of the body, so the circulation was
                    supposed to be another independent determining factor; and under the influence
                    of these mechanistic conceptions the direction of investigation into the
                    phenomena of respiration and circulation has been largely diverted to side
                    issues.</p>
               <p>Since the circulation, no less than the breathing, is concerned in the supply of
                    oxygen to and removal of carbon dioxide from the tissues, it can readily be
                    understood that defective circulation, such as occurs, for instance, in
                    uncompensated valvular affections of the heart, may affect the breathing and
                    hinder the normal respiratory exchange. Conversely, also, defects in the
                    aeration or oxygen-carrying power of the blood may be compensated for by
                    increase in the circulation. For instance, in the very common condition known as
                    anaemia, where the percentage of haemoglobin, and consequently the
                    oxygen-carrying power of the blood, is often reduced to a third or less, the
                    respiratory disturbances may be so slight that the patient is going about his or
                    her ordinary work. A miner suffering from the now well-known “ worm-disease,” or
                    ankylostomiasis <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> may be working underground, or a
                    housemaid suffering from chlorosis may be doing her work, with only a third of
                    the normal oxygen-carrying power of the blood. There seems to be no doubt that
                    in such cases an increased rate of blood circulation compensates for the
                    diminished oxygen-carrying power of the blood. It is well known that at high
                    altitudes a gradual process of adaptation to the low pressure occurs, and the
                    shortness of breath and other symptoms experienced for the first few days
                    gradually become less and less. This adaptation is partly, at least, due to a
                    marked increase in the percentage of haemoglobin in the blood, though probably
                    circulatory and perhaps other compensatory changes are also involved.</p>
               <p>In connexion with respiration the action of certain poisons is of great
                    interest. One of these, carbon monoxide, is of very common occurrence, and
                    causes numerous cases of poisoning. Like oxygen, it has the property of
                    combining with the haemoglobin of the blood, but its affinity for haemoglobin is
                    far more strong than that of oxygen. In presence of air containing as little as
                    -05% of carbon monoxide, the haemoglobin will become about equally shared
                    between oxygen and carbon monoxide, so that, since air contains 20.9% of oxygen,
                    the affinity of carbon monoxide for haemoglobin may be regarded as about 400
                    times greater than that of oxygen. The blood of a person breathing even a small
                    percentage of carbon monoxide may thus become gradually saturated to a dangerous
                    extent, since the haemoglobin engaged by the carbon monoxide is for the time
                    useless as an oxygen-carrier. Air containing more than about 0.1% of carbon
                    monoxide is thus more or less dangerous if breathed for long; but the blood
                    completely recovers in the course of a few hours if pure air is again breathed.
                    The poisonous action of carbon monoxide can be abolished by placing the animal
                    exposed to it in oxygen at an excess pressure of about an atmosphere. The reason
                    for this is that, in consequence of the increased partial pressure of the
                    oxygen, the amount of this gas in free solution in the blood is greatly
                    increased in accordance with Dalton’s law, and becomes sufficient to supply the
                    tissues with oxygen quite independently of the haemoglobin. Even at ordinary
                    atmospheric pressure the extra oxygen dissolved in the blood when pure oxygen is
                    breathed is of considerable importance. Carbon-monoxide poisoning is the chief
                    cause of death in colliery explosions and fires, and the sole cause in poisoning
                    by fighting gas and fuel gas of various kinds. Its presence in dangerous
                    proportions may be readily detected with the help of a small bird, mouse or
                    other small warm-blooded animal. In such animals the respiratory exchange is so
                    rapid that symptoms of carbon-monoxide poisoning are shown far more quickly than
                    in man. The small animal can thus be employed in mines, &amp;c., to indicate
                    danger from carbon monoxide. A lamp is useless for this purpose. There are
                    various other poisons, such as nitrites, chlorates, dinitrobenzol, &amp;c.,
                    which act by disabling the haemoglobin, and so cutting off the oxygen supply to
                    the tissues.</p>
               <p>Between the air in the air-cells of the lungs and the blood of the lung
                    capillaries there intervenes nothing but a layer of very thin, flattened cells,
                    and until recently it was very generally believed that it was by diffusion alone
                    that oxygen passes inwards and carbonic acid outwards through this layer.
                    Similar simple physical explanations of processes of secretion and absorption
                    through living cells have, however, turned out to be incorrect in the case of
                    other organs. It is known, moreover, that in the case of the swimming-bladder of
                    fishes oxygen is secreted into</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0191" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0214.jp2"/>
               <p>the interior against enormous pressure. Thus, in the case of a fish caught at a
                    depth of 4500 ft., the partial pressure of the oxygen present in the swimming
                    bladder at this depth was 127 atmospheres, whereas the partial pressure of
                    oxygen in sea-water is only about 0*2 atmosphere. Diffusion can therefore have
                    nothing to do with the passage of gas inwards, which is known to be under the
                    control of the nervous system. The cells lining the interior of the swimming
                    bladder are developed from the same part of the alimentary tract as those lining
                    the air-cells of the lungs, so that it seems not unlikely that the lungs should
                    possess the power of actively secreting or excreting gases. The question whether
                    such a power exists, and is normally exercised, has been investigated by more
                    than one method; and although it is not possible to go into the details of the
                    experiments, there can be no doubt that the balance of the evidence at present
                    available is in favour of the view that diffusion alone is incapable of
                    explaining either the absorption of oxygen or the excretion of carbon dioxide
                    through the lining cells of the lungs. The partial pressure of oxygen appears to
                    be always higher, and of carbon dioxide often lower, in the blood leaving the
                    lungs than in the air of the air-cells; and this result is inconsistent with the
                    diffusion theory. As to the causes of the passage of oxygen and carbonic acid
                    through the walls of the capillaries of the general circulation, we are at
                    present in the dark. Possibly diffusion may explain this process.</p>
               <p>II. Although we cannot trace the exact changes which occur when oxygen passes
                    into living cells, yet it is possible to obtain a clear general view of the
                    origin and destiny of the material concerned in the process, and of the
                    physiological conditions which determine it.</p>
               <p>The oxidizable material within the body consists, practically speaking, of
                    proteids (albumen-like substances, with which the collagen of connective tissue
                    may be included), fats and carbohydrates (sugars and glycogen). AU of these
                    substances contain carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in known, though different,
                    proportions, and the former also contains a known amount of nitrogen and a
                    little sulphur. Nitrogen is constantly leaving the body as urea and other
                    substances in the urine and faeces; and a small but easily measurable proportion
                    of carbon passes off in the same manner. The rest of the carbon passes out as
                    carbon dioxide in respiration. Now carbohydrates and fats are oxidized
                    completely in the body to carbon dioxide and water. This follows from the fact
                    that, practically speaking, no other products into which they might have been
                    converted leave the body except carbon dioxide and water. Moreover, a given
                    weight of carbohydrate requires for its oxidation a definite weight of oxygen,
                    and produces a definite weight of carbon dioxide. There is thus a definite
                    relation between the weight of oxygen used up and the weight of carbon dioxide
                    formed in this oxidation. The same is true for the oxidation of fat and of
                    proteid, allowing in the latter case for the fact that the nitrogen, together
                    with part of the carbon and hydrogen, passes out as urea, &amp;c., in an
                    incompletely oxidized form. From all this it follows that if we measure over a
                    given period (1) the discharge of nitrogen from the body, (2) the intake of
                    oxygen and (3) the output of carbonic acid, we can easily calculate exactly what
                    the ultimate destiny of the oxygen has been, and at the ultimate expense of what
                    material the carbonic acid has been formed. What the intermediate stages may
                    have been we cannot say, but this in no way affects the validity of the
                    calculation. If, during the period of measurement, food is taken, the basis of
                    the calculation is still substantially the same, as the oxidizable material in
                    food consists of practically nothing else except proteids, carbohydrates and
                    fats.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Liberation of Energy.—</hi> From experiments made outside the
                    body, we know that in the oxidation of a given weight of proteid, carbohydrate
                    or fat, a definite amount of energy is liberated. In the article on <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Dietetics</hi> it is shown that precisely the same
                    liberation of energy occurs in the living body, due allowance being made for the
                    fact that the oxidation of proteid is not quite complete. The following table
                    shows the respiratory quotients (the respiratory quotient being the ratio
                    between the volume of carbon dioxide .formed and that of oxygen used up) and
                    energy expressed in units of heat (calories) liberated per gramme of carbon
                    dioxide produced and oxygen consumed in the living body during the oxidation of
                    proteid, fat and a typical carbohydrate:—</p>

               <p>In the oxidation of non-living substances the rate varies, within wide limits,
                    according to that at which oxygen is supplied. Thus a fire burns the faster the
                    more air is supplied, and the higher the percentage of oxygen in the air. It was
                    for long believed that in the living body also the rate of oxidation must vary
                    according to the oxygen supply. It has been found, however, that this is not the
                    case. Provided that a certain minimum of oxygen is present in the air breâthed,
                    or in the blood supplied to the tissues, it is, practically speaking,
                    indifferent whether the oxygen supply be increased or diminished : only a
                    certain amount is consumed. It might be supposed that the reason for this is
                    that the available oxidizable material in the body is limited, and that if the
                    food supply were increased there would be a corresponding increase in the rate
                    of oxidation. This hypothesis is apparently supported by the fact that, when an
                    increased supply of proteid is given as food, the amount of nitrogen discharged
                    in the urine is almost exactly correspondingly increased, so that evidently the
                    oxidation of proteid increases correspondingly with the supply. Similarly, when
                    carbohydrate food is given, the alteration in the respiratory quotient shows
                    that more carbohydrate than before is being oxidized. Closer investigation in
                    recent times has, however, brought out the very striking fact that, if oxidation
                    be measured in terms of energy liberated by it in the body, it makes hut little
                    difference, other things being equal, whether the animal is fasting or not. If
                    more proteid or carbohydrate is oxidized at one time, correspondingly less fat
                    is oxidized, but the total energy Hberated as heat, &amp;c., in the body is
                    about the same, unless the diet is very excessive, when there is a slight
                    increase of oxidation. Even after many days of starvation, the rate of oxidation
                    per unit of body weight has been found to remain sensibly the same in man. When
                    more food is taken than is required, the excess is stored up, chiefly in the
                    form of fat, into which carbohydrate and possibly also proteid are readily
                    converted in the body. When less food is taken than is needed, the stock of fat
                    is drawn upon, and supplies by far the greater proportion of the energy
                    requirements of the body.</p>
               <p>During the performance of muscular work oxidation is greatly increased, and may
                    amount to ten times the normal or more. Even the slight exertion of easy walking
                    increases oxidation to three times. When the energy represented by the external
                    work done in muscular exertion is compared with the extra energy liberated by
                    oxidation in’the body, it is found, as would be expected, that the latter value
                    largely exceeds the former. In other words, much of the energy Iiberatcd is
                    wasted as heat. Nevertheless the muscles are capable of working with less waste
                    than any steam or gas engine. In the work of climbing, for instance, it has been
                    found in the case of man that 35 % of the energy liberated is represented in the
                    work done in raising the body. Muscular work, if at all excessive, leads to
                    fatigue, and consequent rest. On the other hand, unnatural abstinence from
                    muscular activity leads to restlessness and consequent muscular work. Hence on
                    an average of the twenty-four hours the expenditure of energy by different
                    individuals, with different modes of life, does not as a rule differ greatly.</p>
               <p>The rate of oxidation per unit of body weight varies considerably according to
                    size and age. If we compare different warmblooded animals, we find that the rate
                    of oxidation is relatively</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0192" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0215.jp2"/>
               <p>to their weight far higher in the. smaller ones. In a mouse or small bird, for
                    instance, the rate is about twenty times as great as in a man. The difference is
                    in part due to the fact that the smaller an animal is the greater is its surface
                    relatively to its mass, and consequently the more heat does it require to keep
                    up its temperature. The smaller animal must therefore produce more heat. Even in
                    cold-blooded animals, however, oxidation</p>
               <p>' appears to be more rapid the smaller the animal. In the case of man, oxidation
                    is rclatively more than twice as rapid in children than in adults, and the
                    difference is greater than would be accounted for by the difference in the ratio
                    of surface to mass. Allowing for differences in size, oxidation is about equally
                    rapid in men and women.</p>
               <p>It was for long believed that the special function of respiratory oxidation was
                    (i) the production of heat, and (2) the destruction of the supposed “ waste
                    products.” Further investigation has, however, tended to show more and more
                    clearly that in reality respiratory oxidation is an essential and intimate
                    accompaniment of all vital activity. To take one example, secretion and
                    absorption, which were formerly explained as simple processes of filtration and
                    diffusion, are now known to be* accompanied, and necessarily so, by respiratory
                    oxidation in the tissues concerned. The respiratory oxidation of an animal is
                    thus a very direct index of the activity of its vital processes as a whole.
                    Looking at what is known with regard to respiratory oxidation, we see that what
                    is most striking and most characteristic in it is its tendency to persist—to
                    remain on the whole at about a normal level for each animal, or each stage of
                    development of an animal. The significance of this cannot be over-estimated. It
                    indicates clearly that just as an organism differentiates itself from any
                    non-living material system by the manner in which it actually asserts and
                    maintains its specific anatomical structure, so does it differentiate itself
                    from any mere mechanism by the manner in which it asserts and maintains its
                    specific physiological activities.</p>

               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Normal Respiration.—</hi> If the naked body of a person asleep
                    or in perfect inactivity be carefully watched, it will be found that the
                    anterior and lateral walls of the chest move rhythmically up and down, while air
                    passes into and out of the nostrils (and mouth also if this be open) in
                    correspondence with the movement. If we look more closely wc shall find that
                    with every uprising of the chest walls the membranous intercostal portions sink
                    slightly as if sucked in, while at the same time the flexible walls of the
                    abdomen bulge as if protruded by some internal force. If respiration be in the
                    slightest degree hurried, these motions become so marked as to escape the
                    attention of no one. The elevation of the chest walls is called <hi
                        rend="italic">inspiration,</hi> their depression <hi rend="italic"
                        >expiration.</hi> Inspiration is slightly shorter than expiration, and
                    usually there is a slight pause or momentary inaction of the chest between
                    expiration and the following inspiration. Apparatuses for measuring the
                    excursion of a given point of the chest wall during respiration are called <hi
                        rend="italic">Bioracometers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Stethometers.</hi>
                    Apparatuses for recording the movements of the chest are called <hi

               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Frequency of Respiration.—</hi> The frequency of respiration</p>
               <p>during perféct rest of the body is 16 to 24 per minute, the pulse rate being
                    usually four times the rate of respiration; but the respiratory rhythm varies in
                    various conditions of life. The following are the means of many observations
                    made by Lambert Adolphe Quételet (1796-1874): at the age of one year the number
                    of respirations is 44 per minute; at 5 years, 26; from 15 to 20 years, 20; from
                    25 to 30, 16; from 30 to 50, 18·i. Muscular exertion always increases the
                    frequency of respiration. The higher the temperature of the environment the more
                    frequent is the respiration. Paul Bert (1833-1886) has shown that with higher
                    atmospheric pressures than the normal the frequency of respiration is diminished
                    while the depth of each inspiration is increased. The frequency of respiration
                    diminishes until dinner-time, reaches its maximum within an hour of feeding, and
                    thereafter falls again ; if dinner is^omitted, no rise of frequency occurs. The
                    respiratory act can be interrupted at any stage, reversed, quickened, slowed and
                    variously modified at will, so long as respiration is not stopped entirely for
                    more than a short space of time; beyond this limit the will is incapable of
                    suppressing respiration.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Depth of Respiration.—</hi> The depth of respiration is
                    measured by the quantity of air inspired or expired in the act; but the deepest
                    expiration possible does not suffice to expel all the air the lungs contain. The
                    following measurements have been ascertained, and are here classified according
                    to the convenient terminology proposed by John Hutchinson (1811-1861). (1) <hi

               <p>Vital capacity is estimated by means of a <hi rend="italic">spirometer,</hi> a
                    graduated gasometer into which air may be blown from the lungs. The residual
                    air, which for obvious reasons cannot be actually measured, may be estimated in
                    the following way (Emil Harless,' 1820-1862; Louis Gréhant, b. 1838). At the end
                    of ordinary expiration, apply the mouth to a mouthpiece communicating with a
                    vessel filled with pure hydrogen, and breathe into and out of this vessel half a
                    dozen times—until, in fact, there is reason to suppose that the air in the lungs
                    at the time of the experiment has become evenly mixed with hydrogen. Then
                    ascertain by analysis the proportion of hydrogen to expired air in the vessel
                    and estimate the amount of the air which the lungs contained by the following
                    formula:—</p>

                        expiration; that is, it includes the residual and the reserve air; if we
                        subtract from this the amount of reserve air ascertained by direct
                        measurement, we obtain the 100-130 cub. in. which Hutchinson arrived at by a
                        study of the dead body.</p>

                        Various instruments have heen devised to measure the volume of respiration,
                        all more or less faulty for the reason that they compel respiration under
                        somewhat abnormal conditions (Rosenthal, Gad, Peter Ludwig, Panum
                        (1820-1885), Ewald Hering (b. 1834). From the data obtained we may conclude
                        that the respiratory volume per minute in man is about 366 cuh. in. (6000
                        cub. centim.). In connexion with this subject it may be stated that, after a
                        single ordinary inspiration of hydrogen gas, 6-10 respirations of ordinary
                        air must occur before the expired air ceases to contain some trace of
                        hydrogen.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Types of Respiration.—</hi> The visible characters of
                        respiration in man vary considerably according to age and sex. In men, while
                        there is a moderate degree of upheaval of the chest, there is a considerable
                        although not preponderating degree of excursion of the ahdominal walls. In
                        women the chest movements are decidedly most marked, the excursion of the
                        abdominal walls being comparatively small. Hence we may distinguish two
                        types of respiration, the costal and the abdominal, according to the
                        preponderance of movement of one or the other part of the body wall. In
                        forced respiration the type is costal in both sexes, and so it is also in
                        sleep. The cause of this difference between men and women has been variously
                        ascribed <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> to constriction of the chest by corsets
                        in women, (5) to a natural adaptation to the needs of childbearing in women,
                        and (c) to the greater relative flexibility of the ribs in women permitting
                        a wider displacement under the action of the inspiratory muscles.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Certain Concomitants of Normal Respiration.—</hi> If the
                        ear be placed against the chest wall during ordinary respiration we can hear
                        with every inspiration a sighing or rustling sound, called “ vesicular,”
                        which is probably caused by the expansion of the air vesicles; and with
                        every expiration a sound of a much softer sighing character. In children the
                        inspiratory rustle is sharper and more pronounced than in adults. If a
                        stethoscope be placed over the trachea, bronchi or larynx, so that the
                        sounds generated there may be separately communicated to the ear, there is
                        heard a harsh to-and-fro sound during inspiration and expiration which has
                        received the name of “ bronchial.”</p>
                   <p>In healthy hreathing the mouth should be closed and the ingoing current
                        should all pass through the nose. When this happens the nostrils become
                        slightly expanded with each inspiration, probably by the action of the M.
                        dilatatores naris. In some people this movement is hardly perceptible unless
                        breathing be heavy or laboured. As the air passes at the hack of the throat
                        hehind the soft palate it causes the velum to wave very gently in the
                        current; this is a purely passive movement. If we look at the glottis or
                        opening into the larÿnx during respiration, as we may readily do with the
                        help of a small mirror held at the back of the throat, we may notice that
                        the glottis is wide open during inspiration and that it hecomes narrower by
                        the approximation of the vocal chords during expiration. This alteration is
                        produced by the action of the laryngeal muscles. Like the movements of the
                        nostril, those of the larynx are almost imperceptible in some people during
                        ordinary breathing, but are very well marked in all during forced
                        respiration.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">The Mechanics of Respiration.—</hi> The thorax is
                        practically a closed box entirely filled by the lungs, heart and other
                        structures contained within it. If we were to freeze a dead body until ali
                        its tissues were rigid, and then were to remove a portion of the chest wall,
                        we should observe that every corner of the thorax is accurately filled by
                        some portion or other of its contents. If we were to perform the same
                        operation of removing a part of the chest wall in a body not first frozen we
                        should find, on the other hand, that the contents of the thorax are not by
                        any means in such circumstances bulky enough to fill up the space provided
                        for them. If we were to measure the organs carefully we should find that
                        those which are hollow and whose cavities communicate with the regions
                        outside the thorax are all larger in the frozen corpse than in that which
                        was not frozen. In other words, the organs in the thorax are distended
                        somewhat in order that they may completely fill the chest cavity; and the
                        nature of this curious and important condition may best be illustrated by

                        are expanded until the limits of the containing vessel are accurately
                        filled, while all flexible portions of the walls of the vessel
                        (corresponding to the intercostal membranes and the diaphragm of the thorax)
                        are sucked inwards.</p>
                   <p>From this description it follow’s that the lungs, even when the thorax is
                        most contracted, are constantly over-distended, and that, when the cause of
                        this over-distension is removed, the lungs, being elastic, collapse. It
                        further follows that if the thorax is dilated, the flexible hollow organs it
                        contains must perforce be still more distended—a distension which in the
                        case of the lungs is followed by an indrawing of air through the trachea in
                        all cases where the trachea is open. Thus, as the act of respiration is
                        primarily a dilatation of the thorax, the part played by the lungs is, as
                        Galcn knew, a purely passive one.</p>
                   <p>How is dilatation of the thorax effected? It has been pointed out that the
                        rib-planes decline from the horizontal in two directions, viz. from hehind
                        forwards, and from the anteroposterior mesial plane outwards; a glance at
                        fig. 9 will make this double sloping clear to the reader. It has, moreover,
                        been explained that the diaphragm arches upwards into the thorax in such a
                        manner that the lateral parts of the arch are vertical and in contact with
                        the inner face of the thoracic walls. This being the structure of the
                        thorax, the enlargement of its cavity is brought about (1) by raising the
                        rib-planes until they approach the horizontal, and (2) by depressing the
                        diaphragm and making its rounded dome more cone-like in outline. A moment’s
                        consideration will show how these actions enlarge the boundaries of the
                        thorax, <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> When the postero-anterior slope of the
                        rib-planes is diminished by the raising of the anterior ends of the ribs,
                        the whole sternum is thrust upwards and forwards, and the antero-posterior
                        diameter of the thorax is increased, (δ) When the lateral slope of the
                        rib-planes is diminished by the ribs being moved</p>

                   <p>upwards about an axis passing through their sternal and vertebral
                        extremities, it is evident that the lateral diameter of the thorax must be
                        increased, (c) When the muscular portion of the diaphragm contracts, the
                        curves of its dome-like shape are straightened, the whole diaphragm comes to
                        look more conical on section, and the apposition of its lateral parts to the
                        inner surface of the thorax is destroyed; the two apposed surfaces are drawn
                        apart much as the leaves of a book might be, and a space is formed between
                        them, into which some portion of the lung slips, <hi rend="italic">(d)</hi>
                        When the diaphragm descends it draws with it the whole contents of the
                        thorax; inasmuch as the contents as a whole are conical in shape with the
                        apex upward and are fitted into the conical space of the thoracic cavity, it
                        is clear that the descent of the contents will tend to create a space
                        between them and the thoracic walls; for each stratum of lung, &amp;c.,
                        which is adapted to fit a certain level of thorax, will thereby be brought
                        into a lower and (as the thorax is conical) a more spacious level.</p>
                   <p>Hence the descent of the diaphragm causes a much greater enlargement of the
                        thorax than is measured by the mere elongation of the vertical diameter. In
                        this manner the thorax is distended and air is drawn into the lungs. The
                        contraction of the thorax in expiration is brought about by the return of
                        the ribs and diaphragm to their original position of rest.</p>

                            Movements.—</hi> These are caused by the contraction of muscles which
                        are fixed either to the central axis of the body (including under that term
                        the head and vertebral column) or to some point rendered sufficiently stable
                        for the purpose by the action of other adjuvant muscles. Thus the M.
                        levatores costarum arise from the transverse processes of the 7th cervical
                        and eleven upper dorsal vertebrae, and are attached to the ribs below in
                        series; the M. scaleni spring from the cervical vertebrae, and are attached
                        to the anterior parts of the first and second ribs; the M.
                        stemocleido-mastoidei arise from the side and back of the skull, and are
                        inserted into the upper part of the sternum and the clavicle; the M.
                        pectoralis minor arises from the coracoid process of the scapula, and is
                        inserted into the anterior ends of some of the ribs; the M. serratus
                        posticus superior arises from certain of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae,
                        and is inserted into the posterior part of certain of the ribs; the M.
                        cervicalis ascendens (part of the M. erector spinae) arises from certain of
                        the cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the posterior part of certain
                        ribs. The M. serratus magnus and the M. pectoralis major, which are affixed
                        on the one hand to the upper arm and to the scapula respectively, and on the
                        other to the ribs and to the sternum respectively, may in certain elevated
                        positions of the arm and shoulder act as inspiratory muscles. When all these
                        muscles contract, the ribs are raised in the twofold way already described,
                        some pulling up the anterior ends of the ribs, and others causing the arched
                        ribs to rotate about an axis passing through their vertebral and sternal
                        joints.</p>
                   <p>In addition to the muscles just enumerated, the M. intercostales extemi are
                        undoubtedly inspiratory muscles. Every external intercostal muscular fibre
                        between a pair of ribs must, when it contracts, of necessity raise <hi
                            rend="italic">both</hi> ribs, as is clearly shown by the accompanying
                        diagram (fig. 10). Here <hi rend="italic">Pb'</hi> must be shorter than <hi

                   <p>By a similar geometrical treatment of the question it may be shown that the
                        internal intercostal muscles when they contract must of necessity depress
                        both the ribs to which they are attached. If the angle BAc' = x(fig. n),

                        the angle x.</p>
                   <p>The case, however, is not so clear with reference to the anterior portions
                        of the internal intercostals which be between the cartilages; for it is
                        evident that these fibres have the same direction with regard to the sternum
                        as an axis as the external intercostals have with regard to the vertebral
                        column as an axis; that is to say, the geometrical diagram in fig. 10
                        applies to the inter-cartilaginous internal intercostals as perfectly as it
                        does to the inter-osseous parts of the external intercostals, the inference
                        being that the inter-cartilaginous internal intercostals tend to elevate the
                        pair of ribs between which they stretch. The geometrical argument is,
                        however, overborne by physiological experiment: Martin and Hartwell have
                        observed in the dog and the cat that the internal intercostals throughout
                        their whole extent contract (not synchronously) but alternately with the
                        diaphragm; hence we must conclude that their function throughout is not
                        inspiratory like that of the diaphragm, but expiratory.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">The Movements of lhe Diaphragm.</hi> —The muscular fibres
                        of the diaphragm are arranged in a radial manner, or, more strictly
                        speaking, in a manner like the fines of longitude on a terrestrial globe.
                        The central tendon of the diaphragm corresponds to the pole of such a globe.
                        The contraction of the fibres is expended on straightening the longitudinal
                        curves rather than on pulling down the central tendon to a lower level; in
                        fact, the central tendon moves very little in ordinary respiration.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">How the Expiratory Movements are Produced.—</hi> The
                        action of inspiration disturbs many organs from the position of rest into
                        which gravity and their own physical properties have thrown them. The ribs
                        and sternum are raised from the position of lowest level; the elastic costal
                        cartilages are twisted; the elastic lungs are put upon the stretch; the
                        abdominal organs, themselves elastic, are compressed and thrust against the
                        elastic walls of the belly, causing these to bulge outwards. In short the
                        very act of inspiration stores up, as it were, in sundry ways the forces
                        which make for expiration. As soon as the inspiratory muscles cease to act
                        these Jorces come into play, and the position of rest or equilibrium is
                        regained. It is very doubtful whether any special expiratory muscles are
                        called into action during ordinary respiration. The internal intercostals
                        may in man be exercised in ordinary expiration (although they are certainly
                        not so exercised in the dog and the cat); but in laboured expiration many
                        muscles assist in the expulsive effort. The muscles forming the belly-walls
                        contract and force the abdominal contents against the relaxed diaphragm in
                        such a manner as to drive it farther and farther into the thorax. At the

                        triangularis sterni, which arises from the back or thoracic aspect of the
                        sternum and lower costal cartilages and is inserted into the costal
                        cartilages higher up, can obviously depress the ribs. So also can the M.
                        serratus posticus inferior, which arises from the thick fascia of the loins
                        and is inserted into the last four ribs. So also can the M. quadrat us

                        Indeed there is hardly a muscle of the body but may bc called into play
                        during extremely laboured respiration, either because it acts on the chest,
                        or because it serves to steady some part and give a better purchase for the
                        action of direct respiratory muscles.</p>

                   <p>In the following article we have to give an account of the more important
                        pathological processes which affect the lungs, pleurae and bronchial tubes.
                        In the aetiology of pulmonary affections, the relations between the lungs
                        and the external air, and also between them and the circulatory system, are
                        important. The lungs are, so to speak, placed between the right and left
                        cavities of the heart, and the only way for the blood to pass from the right
                        ventricle to the left side of the heart, except in cases of a patent foramen
                        ovale or other congenital defect forming a communication between the two
                        sides of the organ, is by passing through them. The result is that not only
                        may they become diseased by foreign material carried into them by the blood,
                        but any obstruction to the flow of blood through the left side of the heart
                        tends sooner or later to engorge or congest them, and lead to further
                        changes. Through the nose and mouth they are in direct connexion with the
                        external atmosphere. Hence the variable condition of the air as regards
                        temperature, degree of moisture, and density, is liable to produce directly
                        various changes in the lungs, or to predispose them to disease; and the
                        contamination of the air with various pathogenic germs and irritating
                        particles in the shape of dust, is a direct source of
                        many lung affections.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Bronchitis,</hi> or inflammation of the mucous membrane of
                        the bronchial tubes, has been generally attributed to exposure to
                        atmospheric changes. It occurs with great frequence in the extremes of life,
                        and it is in early childhood and in old age that it is more liable to be
                        fatal. Bronchitis may often follow exposure to cold, but that low
                        temperature in itself is not sufficient to cause it is shown by the fact
                        that the crews of arctic expeditions have been singularly free from diseases
                        usually attributed to cold, but on their return to moist germ-laden
                        atmospheres have at once been affected. Children reared in heated rooms with
                        lack of ventilation are peculiarly susceptible to attacks on the slightest
                        change of temperature. Bronchitis is also frequently caused by cardiac and
                        renal diseases, and by the extension of inflammatory diseases of the upper
                        air passages (as rhinitis, laryngitis or pharyngitis), while blockage of the
                        nasal passages by adenoid or other growths may, by causing persistent
                        mouth-breathing, lead to bronchial infection. Before the bacterial origin of
                        disease was understood, bronchitis was attributed solely to what is termed “
                        catching cold, ” and the exact relation of the chill to the bacterial
                        infection is still unknown. It is probable that the chilling of the surface
                        of the body by exposure causes congestion of the muçous membrane, the
                        presence of a virulent micro-organism being then all that is required to
                        produce bronchitis. It is generally accepted that in persons living in the
                        pure air of the country the small bronchi and air-cells are sterile (Barthel
                        in the <hi rend="italic">Zcntralblatt fur Bakteriologie,</hi> vol. xxiv.).
                        Bacteria are arrested on their way by the leucocytes of the nasal mucous
                        membrane and by the vibration of the ciliated epithelium of the upper air
                        passages. The mucous membrane of the upper bronchi is, however, tenanted by
                        various micro-organisms such as the diplo-bacillus of Friedländer, bacillus
                        coli communis, micrococcus tetragenus, &amp;c., and it is considered by
                        William Ewart that these organisms may in certain conditions of their host
                        become virulent. “ Specific ” bronchitis occurs in the course of a specific
                        infective disease <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> influenza, measles or
                        whooping cough) and is due to the specific micro-organism gaining access by
                        the mucous membrane of the respiratory tract. Cases have been known in which
                        the diphtheria bacillus has been so localized. In glanders, small-pox,
                        syphilis and pemphigus, the infective micro-organism is carried to the
                        bronchi by the blood stream. In common or “ nonspecific” bronchitis,
                        streptococci, pneumococci and staphylococci are found in the sputum together
                        with Friedländer’s bacillus and the bacillus coli communis. Microscopically
                        the bronchi show hyperaemia of the mucous and submucous coats, and the whole
                        wall becomes infiltrated with polymorphonuclear leucocytes and round cells.
                        Many cells undergo mucoid degeneration, and there is abundant epithelial
                        proliferation. A large quantity of mucus is secreted by the glands, and the
                        lumen of the bronchi contains an exudate consisting of mucus, degenerated
                        leucocytes and cast-off epithelial cells.</p>
                   <p>In the rare form of bronchitis known as fibrinous or plastic bronchitis a
                        membranous exudate is formed which forms casts of the bronchi, which may be
                        coughed up. The casts vary from an inch to six or seven inches in length,
                        with branches corresponding to the divisions of the bronchi from which they
                        come. The cast consists of mucus and fibrin in varying proportions. The
                        exact pathology of this variety is still undetermined.</p>
                   <p>Bronchitis may affect the whole bronchial tract, or more especially the
                        larger or the smaller tubes. It may occur as an acute or as a chronic
                        affection. In the acute form the inflammation may remain limited to the
                        bronchial tubes and gradually subside, or it may lead to inflammation of the
                        surrounding lung tissue, giving rise to disseminated foci of inflammation of
                        greater or less extent throughout the lungs (catarrhal or bronchopneumonia).
                        This is a common complication of bronchitis, especially
                        where the smaller tubes are affected, and is more</p>

                   <p>frequently seen in children than aduIts. In cases of chronic bronchitis the
                        affection, as a rule, begins as a slight ailment during the winter, and
                        recurs in succeeding winters. The intervals of freedom from the trouble get
                        shorter, and in the course of a few years it persists during the summer as
                        well as the winter months. A condition of chronic bronchitis is thus
                        established. The persistent cough which this occasions is one of the chief
                        causes of the development of the condition of <hi rend="italic"
                            >emphysema,</hi> where there is a permanent enlargement of the air-cells
                        of the lungs with an atrophy of the walls of the air vesicles. The emphysema
                        occasions an increase in the shortness of breath from which the person had
                        previously suffered, and Iater, in consequence of the greater difficulty
                        with which the blood circulates through the emphysematous lungs, the right
                        side of the heart becomes diIated, and from that we have the development of
                        a general dropsy of the subcutaneous tissues, and less and less perfect
                        aeration of the blood.</p>
                   <p>The death rate from bronchitis in England and Wales during 1908 was: males
                        1102, females 1083 per million living. The death rate for the five years
                        1901-1905 was 1237 per million for all sexes. The death rate for the twenty
                        years 1888-1908 consistently showed a slight decline.</p>

                        Inhaleaconsiderableamount of carbonaceous and other foreign particles, which
                        in health are partly got rid of by the action of the ciliated cells lining
                        the bronchial tubes, and are partly absorbed by cells in the wall of · the
                        tubes, and carried in the lymph channels to the bronchial lymphatic gIands,
                        where they are deposited, and cause a more or less marked pigmentation of
                        the tissues. Part of such pigment is also deposited in the walls of the
                        bronchial tubes and the interstitial tissue of the lungs, giving rise to the
                        grey appearance presented by the lungs of all adults who live in large
                        cities. In certain dusty occupations, such as those of stone masons,
                        knife-grinders, colliers, &amp;c., the foreign particles inhaled cause
                        trouble. The most common affection so produced is chronic bronchitis, to
                        which becomes added emphysema. In some cases not only is bronchitis
                        developed, but the foreign particles lead to an increase of the fibrous
                        tissue round the bronchi and in the interstitial tissue of the lungs, and so
                        to a greater or lesser extent of fibroid consolidation. As this fibrous
                        tissue may later undergo’softening and cavities be formed, a form of
                        consumption is produced, which is named according to the particular
                        occupation giving rise to it; <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> stonemasons’
                        phthisis, knife-grinders’ phthisis, colliers’ phthisis. It should, however,
                        be pointed out that these dusty occupations are probably not so frequently
                        the cause as was at one time taught of these simple inflammatory fibroid
                        changes in the lungs with their subsequent cavity formation; individuals
                        engaged in such occupations are apt to suffer from a chronic. tuberculosis
                        of the lung associated with the formation of much fibrous tissue, and the
                        occupation simply predisposes the lung to the attacks of the tubercle
                        bacillus.</p>
                   <p>The term pneumonia is frequently used of different forms of inflammation of
                        the lungs, and includes affections which run different clinical, courses,
                        present diverse appearances after death, and probably have different
                        exciting causes. It would be better if the term <hi rend="italic">acute
                            pneumonia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">pneumonic fever</hi> were reserved
                        for that form of acute inflammation of the lungs which is usually
                        characterized by sudden onset, and runs an acute, course, which terminates
                        generally by crisis from the fifth to the tenth day, the inflammation
                        leading to the consolidation by fibrinous effusion of the greater part or
                        whole of one lobe of a lung. Acute pneumonia usually occurs in a sporadic
                        form, and is most prevalent in the United Kingdom from November to March.
                        Occasionally it is epidemic, and there is evidence to show that sometimes it
                        is an infective disease. There is great difficulty, however, in being quite
                        certain that the occurrence of the disease in those who have been attending
                        upon or brought into intimate connexion with sufferers from pneumonia is the
                        result of infection, for such cases may be due to an epidemic of the
                        disease, or to the various individuals attacked having</p>
                   <p>been exposed to the same cause.</p>
                   <p>Formerly acute croupous or lobar pneumonia was thought to be due to “
                        catching cold we now know it to be an infectious disease resultant on the
                        invasion of one or more specific micro-organisms. The chief micro-organisms
                        which have been found to be present during an attack of acute pneumonia are
                        the micrococcus lanceolatus or pneumococcus of FrankeI and Weichselbaum,
                        which is found in the inflamed Iung in a large majority of cases and is
                        capable of producing pneumonia when inoculated into guinea-pigs. Sternberg
                        demonstrated the presence of ,the pneumococcus in the saliva of healthy
                        individuals; it tends, however, in this case to vary in form. The
                        micro-organism differs in virulence in given strains; thus one epidemic may
                        be more severe than another; and it tends to increase in viruIence in its
                        passage through the human subject.. The exact conditions necessary for the
                        production of increased virulence in the organism causing an attack of lobar
                        pneumonia are not yet determined, but are usuaIIy ascribed to lowered states
                        of the health and to atmospheric conditions. The pneumococcus produces in
                        the human organism an intracellular toxin, but the question as to whether it
                        can also produce a soluble toxin in the living body is still debated. The
                        difficulty of obtaining sufficient quantities of the toxins of this organism
                        has prevented the production of antisera of high potency. In lower animals,
                        less potent sera have proved successful in protecting against a fatal dose
                        of pneumococci. The change effected by tbe administration of a serum is
                        produced by causing a change in the pneumococci, which causes them to be
                        more easily destroyed by the phagocytes. The element which brings about this
                        change is termed an opsonin; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Blood</hi> and <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Bacteriology</hi> (ii). The bacillus pneumoniae of
                        Friedländer is also said to be found in a certain percentage of cases, but a
                        number of observers deny its presence in pure culture in primary croupous
                        pneumonia.</p>
                   <p>Unlike many acute diseases, pneumonia does not render a person less liabIe
                        to future attacks; on the contrary, those who have been once attacked must
                        be looked upon as more prone to be affected again. Acute pneumonia usually
                        attacks the whole or greater part of one lobe of one lung, but more than one
                        lobe may be affected, or both lungs may be involved. The disease produces a
                        solid and airless condition of the affected part owing to a fibrinous
                        exudation taking pIace into the air-cells and smaller bronchial passages. In
                        favourable cases the exudation is partly absorbed and partly expectorated,
                        and the lung returns to its normal healthy condition; in others, death may
                        ensue from the extent of lung affected, or from the spread of the
                        inflammation to other parts, as for instance the pericardium or meninges of
                        the brain. In such cases it is interesting to note that the same
                        micro-organism has been found in the inflammatory exudation in the
                        pericardium or on the meninges as in the pneumonic Iung; probably the
                        organism had been absorbed from the lung, and was the cause of the secondary
                        inflammations. In cases of death from uncomplicated pneumonia a very
                        variable extent of lung is involved. In some cases this result may be
                        ascribed to the weakness of the individual and especiaIIy of the heart, but
                        in others the virulence of the micro-organisms and the toxins which they
                        have produced is probably the more correct explanation. The improvement in a
                        patient suffering from pneumonia usually commences suddenly, with a rapid
                        fall in the temperature. The day on which this “ crisis” takes place varies,
                        but most commonly it appears to be the seventh from the initial rigor (22 %
                        of the cases, JUrgensen). It may, however, occur a few days earlier or
                        later, being observed in about 74% between the fifth and the ninth day of
                        the disease (Jiirgensen).. The disease occasionally ends in the formation of
                        an abscess, in gangrene, or in fibroid induration of the lung, but these
                        terminations are rare.</p>

                            anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> The term
                            catarrhal pneumonia has been usually regarded as synonymous with the
                            term broncho-pneumonia, and this usual nomenclature has been maintained
                            in the present article. We must, however, recognize that all simple
                            acute broncho-pneumonias are not purely catarrhal in the strict
                            pathological sense. For instance, a considerable amount of fibrinous
                            exudation is not Unfrequently present in the patches of
                            broncho-pneumonia, and some of the cases of septic broncho-pneumonia can

                        </note> pneumonia is usually preceded by an attack of bronchitis, to which
                        it bears an intimate relation, in some cases the small foci of inflammation
                        may run together so as to affect the greater part of a lobe of a lung, and
                        the distinction between such a form of broncho-pneumonia and lobar pneumonia
                        presents such difficulties in the view of some observers, that they have
                        refused to recognize any essential difference between the two. Usually,
                        however, it is not difficult to distinguish the two affections both
                        clinically and anatomically. Broncho-pneumonia is especially seen as a
                        complication of bronchitis, and.while it more frequently attacks children
                        than young adults, it is not uncommon in old people, especially secondary to
                        bronchitis. It is frequent in children after acute infectious fevers,
                        especially measles and diphtheria, and in cases of whooping-cough. It
                        differs from the above-mentioned pneumonia in that it does not usually
                        attack the whole of a lobe of a lung, but occurs in small disseminated
                        patches more especially throughout the lower lobe. of both lungs. The
                        accompanying fever is more irregular than in the preceding form, and the
                        disease usually runs a more prolonged course. It is an extremely fatal
                        affection in both the very young and old. Young persons who have suffered
                        from it are not Unfrequently attacked by pulmonary tuberculosis
                        subsequently. It must be admitted that we are even less certain of its
                        bacteriology than we arc of that of lobar pneumonia. In some cases Frankel’s
                        pneumococcus is found, and in others various other micro-organisms. Many of
                        the latter are doubtless saprophytic, and are not the essential cause of the
                        disease, but it is not probable that any one particular form of organism
                        accounts for all forms of broncho-pneumonia.</p>
                   <p>The bacteriology of broncho-pneumonia presents no one micro-organism which
                        can be definitely said to cause the disease. The micro-organism most
                        frequently found, either alone or associated with other bacteria, is the
                        pneumococcus, which occurred in 67% of a series investigated by Wollstein.
                        Other organisms found are the streptococcus, particularly in
                        bronchopneumonia following infectious fevers, the staphylococcus aureus and
                        albus, and Friedlander <hi rend="sup">i</hi> S bacillus. In some cases the
                        bacillus influenzae alone has been found, and the Klebs-Loffler bacillus in
                        cases following upon diphtheria. When the disease is associated with
                        pulmonary tuberculosis the tubercle bacillus is found.</p>
                   <p>The tuberculous virus, the tubercle bacilli, may gain entrance to the lungs
                        through the inspired air or by means of the blood or lymph currents. Also in
                        some cases it has been demonstrated that tubercle bacilli may infect the
                        glands of the mesentery following the ingestion of the milk of tuberculous
                        cattle. In this the Government Commissions of Great Britain and Germany as
                        well as the United States Bureau of Animal Industry confirm the findings of
                        private investigators. It may be well here to summarize the views generally
                        held as to infection. In the first place, the doctrine of inherited disease
                        is discredited, and the doctrine of specific susceptibility is in doubt.
                        Infants are known to be extremely susceptible, and this susceptibility
                        lessens with increasing age, adults requiring prolonged exposure. As a mode
                        of infection the sputum of diseased persons is of great importance. Infected
                        food, especially milk, comes next, together with food infected by flies; and
                        the mother’s milk is a minor source. Infection is not often received through
                        the skin, but most frequently through the mucous membrane of the mouth, air
                        passages and intestine; occasionally the infection is alveolar. Pulmonary
                        tuberculosis is often secondary to a latent lymphatic form. The tubercle
                        bacillus was discovered by Koch in 1882, and since then it has become
                        generally accepted that the bacillus varies in type. The bacilli have been
                        classified by A. G. Foullerton into <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> occurring in
                        fishes and cold-blooded animals, (&amp;) in birds, (c) in rats, (d) in
                        cattle, (e) in man. Exactly how far they are interchangeable and can affect
                        the human race is not definitely settled. They may be different varieties of
                        the same species caused by differentiated strains of a common stock, or may
                        be distinct but generically allied species. Von Behring considers that the
                        bovine type may undergo modification in the human body, a theory which may
                        lead to a complete change in our beliefs in the mode of entry of the
                        bacillus. Recent investigators have put forward the view that the tubercle
                        bacillus is not a bacterium, but belongs to the higher group known as
                        Streptotricheae or mould fungi.</p>
                   <p>The action of the tubercle bacillus upon the tissues, like most other
                        infectious agents, gives rise to inflammatory processes and anatomical
                        changes, varying with the mode of entry and virulence of the micro-organism.
                        The most characteristic result is the formation throughout the lungs in the
                        form of small scattered foci forming the so-called miliary tubercles. Such
                        miliary tuberculosis of the lungs is frequently only a part of a general
                        tuberculosis, a similar tuberculous affection being found in other organs of
                        the body. In other cases the lungs may be the only or the principal seat of
                        the affection. The source whence the tuberculous virus is derived varies in
                        different cases. Old tubercular glands in the abdomen, neck and elsewhere,
                        and tuberculous disease of bones or joints, are common sources whence
                        tubercule bacilli may become absorbed, and occasion a general dissemination
                        of miliary tubercles in which the lungs participate. Where the source of
                        infection is an old tuberculous bronchial gland or a focus* of old tubercle
                        in the lung, the pulmonary organs may be the only seat of the development of
                        miliary tuberculosis for a time; but even then, if life is sufficiently
                        prolonged, other parts of the body become * involved. Acute miliary
                        tuberculosis of the lungs is not infrequently a final stage in the more
                        chronic tuberculous lesions of the different forms of pulmonary phthisis.</p>
                   <p>In pulmonary phthisis, or consumption, the disease usually commences at the
                        apex of one lung, but runs a very variable course. In a large majority of
                        cases it remains confined to one small focus, and not only does not spread,
                        but undergoes retrograde changes and becomes arrested. In such cases fibrous
                        tissue develops round the focus of disease and the tuberculous patch dries
                        up, often becoming the seat of the deposit of calcareous salts. This arrest
                        of small tuberculous foci in the lung is doubtless of very frequent
                        occurrence, and in <hi rend="italic">post</hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">'mortem</hi> examinations of persons who have died from
                        injuries or’ various diseases other than tubercle it is common to find in
                        the lungs arrested foci of tubercle, which in the majority of instances have
                        never been suspected during life, and probably have occasioned few, if any,
                        symptoms. It has been shown that in more than 37% of persons, over 21 years
                        of age, dying in a general hospital of various diseases, there is evidence
                        of arrested tubercle in the lungs. As such persons are chiefly drawn from
                        the poorer classes, among whom tubercle is more common than among the
                        well-to-do, this high percentage may not be an accurate indication of the
                        frequency with which pulmonary tubercle does become arrested. It does,
                        however, show that the arrest and the healing of tuberculosis of the lungs
                        is by no means unfrequent, and that it occurs among those who are not only
                        prone to become infected, but whose circumstances are least favourable to
                        the arrest of the disease. These facts indicate that the human organism does
                        offer a resistance to the growth of the tubercle bacilli.</p>
                   <p>A focus of pulmonary tubercle may become arrested for a time and then resume
                        activity. In many cases it is difficult to say why this is so, but often it
                        is clearly associated with a lowering in the general health of the
                        individual. It cannot be too strongly insisted that the arrest of a
                        tuberculous focus in the lung is a slow process and requires a long time.
                        Commonly a person in the early stage of phthisis goes away to a health
                        resort, and in the course of a few weeks or months improves so much that he
                        returns to a densely populated town and resumes his former employment. In a
                        short time the disease show’s renewed activity, because the improved</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0198" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0221.jp2"/>
                   <p>conditions were not maintained long enough to ensure the complete arrest of
                        the disease.</p>
                   <p>Instead of the tuberculous focus becoming arrested, it may continue to
                        spread. The original focus and the secondary ones are at first patches of
                        consolidated lung. Later, their central parts soften and burst into a
                        bronchus; then the softened portion is coughed up, and a smalI cavity is
                        left, which tends gradually to increase in size by peripheric extension and
                        by merging with other cavities. This process is repeated again and again,
                        and sooner or later the other lung becomes similarly affected. At any stage
                        of the softening process the blood vessels may become involved and give rise
                        by rupture to a large or a small haemorrhage <hi rend="italic"
                            >(haemoptysis).</hi> It not unfrequently happens that such haemoptysis
                        may be the first symptom that seriously attracts attention. At a later
                        period haemorrhage frequently takes place in large or small amounts from the
                        rupture of vessels, which frequently are dilated and form small aneurysms in
                        the walls of cavities. A fatal termination may be hastened by the absorption
                        by means of the blood vessels and lymphatics of the tuberculous virus from
                        some of the foci of disease, and the occurrence therefrom of a Iocal miliary
                        tuberculosis of the lungs or a general tuberculosis of other organs. the
                        rapidity with which the destructive process spreads throughout the lung
                        varies considerably. We therefore recognize acute phthisis, or galloping
                        consumption, and chronic phthisis. In the acute cases the softening
                        progresses rapidly and is associated with the development of very little
                        fibrous tissue; probably various forms of microorganisms other than the
                        tubercle bacilli assist in the rapid softening. In the more chronic cases
                        there is development of much fibroid tissue, and the disease is associated
                        with periods of temporary arrest of the tubercular process.</p>
                   <p>The expectoration from cases of pulmonary phthisis contains tubercle
                        bacilli, and is a source of danger to healthy individuals, in whom it may
                        produce the disease. Attendance on persons suffering from pulmonary phthisis
                        involves very little risk of infection if proper care, is taken to prevent
                        the expectoration becoming dry and disseminated as dust; perfect.cleanliness
                        is therefore to be insisted upon, in the rooms inhabited by a phthisical
                        person. The tubercle bacilli soon lose their virulence in the presence of
                        fresh air and sunshine, and therefore these agents are not only desirable
                        for the direct-benefit of the phthisical patient, but also are agents in
                        preventing the development of fresh disease in healthy individuals.</p>
                   <p>Although the tubercle bacilli are the essential agents in the development of
                        pulmonary tuberculosis., there are other conditions which must be present
                        before they will produce the disease. It is probable that large numbers of
                        individuals are exposed to the action of tubercle bacilli which gain
                        entrance to the pulmonary tract, and yet do not give rise to the disease,
                        because the conditions of their growth and multiplication do not exist. In
                        such cases we may consider that the seed is present, but that the soil is
                        unsuitable for its growth. Certain families appear more predisposed to
                        tuberculosis than others.</p>
                   <p>The most important HrcuIatory disturbances met with in the lungs are those
                        seen in cases of dilated heart, with or without disease of the mitral valve,
                        when engorgement of the pulmonary vessels sets up a condition of venous
                        engorgement of the lungs. This may lead to various changes. After it has
                        lasted a variable time, and if it is very intense, serous transudation
                        occurs into the substance of the lung and the alveoli, and thus a condition
                        of pulmonary dropsy or oedema is established. The venous engorgement also
                        predisposes the subjects of such heart affections to bronchitis and
                        pneumonia. In disease of the mitral valve, in cardiac dilatation and in
                        simple feebleness of the heart, such as is seen in old age and after
                        debilitating fevers, especially typhoid, there is commonly developed a
                        venous congestion of the bases of the lungs, forming the so-called
                        hypostatic congestion of those organs, and to this is frequently added
                        pneumonia. In long-standing cases of pulmonary congestion brought about by
                        disease of the mitral valve and dilatation of the heart, a certain amount of
                        fibrous tissue may be found in the interstitial tissue of the lungs, and
                        from transudation of certain elements of the blood we get the formation in
                        the newly formed fibrous tissue of blood pigment. In these cases blood
                        pigment is found in the cells, in the pulmonary alveoli, and such cells also
                        carry the pigment into the interstitial tissue. This condition constitutes
                        the state known as <hi rend="italic">brown induration of the lungs.</hi>
                        Acute congestion of the lungs occurs as part of the first stage of
                        pneumonia. It also probably exists during violent exertion, and may possibly
                        be brought about by excitement.</p>
                   <p>Another circulatory disturbance of great importance is that arising from
                        blocking of the pulmonary artery or its branches by an embolus or a
                        thrombus. Where the obstruction takes place in the main vessel, death
                        rapidly ensues. Where, however, a small branch of the vessel is occluded, as
                        frequently occurs from a coagulum forming in the right side of the heart, or
                        in the pulmonary vessels in cases of disease of the mitral valve, or in
                        dilatation of the heart, or from the detachment of a small vegetation from
                        disease of the tricuspid or pulmonary valves, a haemorrhagic exudation takes
                        place, forming a patch of consolidation in the lung <hi rend="italic"
                            >(haemorrhagic infarct).</hi> As this haemorrhagic exudation takes place
                        not only into the substance of the lung, but also into the bronchial tubes,
                        such lesions are usually associated with spitting of blood <hi rend="italic"
                            >(haemoptysis).</hi> The increased tension produced in the pulmonary
                        vessels in cases of mitral disease may also probably lead to the formation
                        of haemorrhagic exudations into the lungs, apart from the occurrence of
                        embolism or thrombosis. Usually the occurrence of pulmonary embolism and the
                        formation of haemorrhagic infarcts in the lungs mark an important epoch in
                        the course of a case of heart disease. It usually occurs at a late stage of
                        the affection, and not unfrequently contributes materially to a fatal
                        termination. It is probable that many of the cases of pneumonia and
                        pleuritic effusion, coming on in cases of vaIvular heart disease and of
                        cardiac dilatation, owe their origin to an embolus and to the formation of a
                        haemorrhagic infarct.</p>
                   <p>The term asthma is commonly applied to a paroxysmal dyspnoea of a special
                        type which is associated with a variety of conditions. In true spasmodic
                        asthma there may be no detectable organic disease, and the paroxysms are
                        generally believed to be due to a nervous influence which, acting upon the
                        bronchial muscles, produces a spasm of the tubes, or, acting through the
                        vaso-motor branches of the sympathetic, produces a congest ion of the
                        bronchial mucous membrane. The most probable theory is that lately advanced,
                        that it is caused by a profound toxaemia. An organism has been isolated,
                        which is said to be the cause of certain cases of asthma, and the fact that
                        benefit has been said to follow treatment by a vaccine is in favour of this
                        view. The exciting cause may not be at all apparent, even on the most
                        careful observation and examination of the sufferer, but in other cases the
                        attacks may be brought about by some reflex irritation. Nasal polypi and
                        other diseases of nasal mucous membrane have been shown in some cases to be
                        a cause of asthma. Irritation of the bronchial mucous membrane appears to be
                        one of the most common, but it is usually difficult to say exactly in what
                        the irritation consists.</p>
                   <p>The sputum in true asthma is typical, consisting of white translucent
                        pellets like boiled tapioca. These pellets consist of mucus arranged in a
                        twisted manner and known as Cursch-mann spirals; they also contain
                        Charcot-Leyden crystals, degenerated epithelium and leucocytes, of which the
                        majority are eosinophiles. The spirals consist of a central solid thread
                        round which the mucus is arranged in spiral form. The twisting has been
                        attributed to a rotatory motion of the cilia, helped by the spasm of thq
                        bronchial muscles. Allied to true asthma is the bronchial asthma frequently
                        met with in the subjects of bronchitis and emphysema. In such cases the
                        irritation evidently proceeds from the inflamed bronchial mucous membrane.
                        Hay asthma is the variety in which the pollen of certain plants, especially
                        grasses, is the exciting cause of the paroxysms. In cardiac feebleness, in
                        valvular disease of the heart, and in cardiac dilatation, we may get
                        dyspnoeic attacks of a more or less</p>

                   <p>paroxysmal nature, to whIch the term cardiac asthma has been applied.
                        Similarly, to a form of dyspnoea met with occasionally as a manifestation of
                        uraemia in chronic Bright’s disease the term of renal asthma has been given.</p>
                   <p>Pleurisy, or inflammation of the pleura, is a very common affection, and is
                        met with under different forms. In many instances we have simply the pouring
                        out, over a greater or less area of the surface of the pleura, of a
                        fibrinous exudation which may become absorbed or undergo organisation, a
                        certain amount of thickening of the pleura, and adhesions of the two layers
                        resulting. Such cases form the group known as cases of dry pleurisy. In
                        other instances a greater or lesser amount of serous exudation takes place
                        into one or other pleural cavity, forming the cases of serous pleuritic
                        effusion. In others the exudation into the pleural cavity is purulent,
                        giving rise to the condition known as empyema or purulent pleuritic
                        effusion. The occurrence of dry pleurisy is probably very frequent, and
                        leads to small pleural adhesions which cause little or no inconvenience. In
                        post-mortem examinations of persons who have died from various diseases it
                        is common to find such pleural adhesions present, although they have never
                        been suspected during life. Pleurisy in one or other of the above forms may
                        come on in a person apparently in good health (idiopathic pleurisy), or it
                        may follow a fracture of the ribs or other injury to the chest. It is not
                        uncommonly secondary to some other disease; thus it is almost a constant
                        accompaniment of acute lobar pneumonia. In such cases the effusion is most
                        commonly a simple fibrinous one, which with the subsidence of the primary
                        disease is in great part absorbed. In other cases of pneumonia we get a
                        certain amount of serous effusion into the pleura; and sometimes, especially
                        in children, the pneumonia is followed by the development of an empyema.
                        Pleurisy with effusion is also frequently a complication of valvular heart
                        disease and dilatation of the heart, and in such cases is often associated
                        with the formation of superficial pulmonary infarcts. It is also seen in
                        many other diseases of the lungs. For instance, in chronic pulmonary
                        phthisis pleuritic adhesions over various parts of the lungs are the rule;
                        and we also frequently get serous effusion into the pleura as a complication
                        of the various forms of pulmonary tuberculosis. Purulent effusion is less
                        common in phthisis, but it is the rule where the pleura is perforated by the
                        necrosis of a tuberculous focus in the lung and the establishment of a
                        communication between the pleura and a tuberculous cavity and the bronchial
                        tubes <hi rend="italic">(pyopneumonothorax)</hi> , a combination in which
                        there is both air and pus in the pleural cavity. Secondary pleurisy is also
                        seen in an extension of the disease from neighbouring parts, as from
                        peritonitis, sub-diaphragmatic abscess, and suppuration in the liver or
                        spleen. As a secondary disease, pleurisy is also known in the course of
                        various forms of nephritis,</p>
                   <p>rheumatism, and the acute specific diseases.</p>
                   <p>Cases formerly classed as idiopathic pleurisy are now Tcnown to be caused by
                        certain micro-organisms. These vary in relation to the character of the
                        effusion. The most frequent is the tubercle bacillus, which is generally
                        present in sero-fibrinous effusions. In this case the pleurisy is really
                        secondary to a possibly unrecognized tuberculous infection either of the
                        lung or pleura. In purulent effusions the pneumococcus may occur as a pure
                        infection, or the streptococcus pyogenes or the staphylococcus may be
                        present. Mixed infections occur in 21% of purulent effusions, and varieties
                        of other organisms, such as the influenza bacillus, the typhoid bacillus,
                        the Klebs-Loffler bacillus and the colon bacillus, have been occasionally
                        found.</p>
                   <p>There are at least five types of pulmonary emphysema;</p>
                   <p>(1) hypertrophic, idiopathic or large-lunged emphysema;</p>
                   <p>(2) senile or small-lunged emphysema; (3) compensatory emphysema; (4) acute
                        vesicular emphysema; (5) interstitial or interlobular emphysema. Two points
                        are usually admitted: that emphysema appears only in lungs that are
                        congenitally weak, and that the exciting cause is increased Intravesicular
                        tension. When one or more lobules are cut off from the working part of the
                        lung the neighbouring vesicles become distended.</p>
                   <p>Should the plugging of the lobule remain permanent, typical emphysema
                        results. This happens in illnesses inducing violent respiratory efforts,
                        such as chronic bronchitis, whooping cough and asthma. In large-lunged
                        emphysema the lung is excessively large, and does not collapse on opening
                        the chest wall. Microscopically two lesions are notable. -The septa between
                        the vesicles are atrophied, many have disappeared and the vesicles have
                        coalesced; the loss in lung tissue diminishes the vascular field of the lung
                        and tends to imperfect aeration, whence the dyspnoea. The elastic tissue of
                        the lung is also lost. In small-lunged emphysema there is a condition of
                        senile atrophy. The lung is smaller than normal, and the intravesicular
                        septa are destroyed. In this case the primary cause is atrophy of the
                        bronchi, and increased air pressure is not a factor. Compensatory emphysema
                        is that which develops in a portion of a lung in which the other portion is
                        the seat of a lesion, such as pneumonia. Occasionally it is merely
                        physiological, but sometimes here too the septa undergo atrophic changes.
                        Acute vesicular emphysema is hardly a pathological variety, and is really
                        rapid distension coming on during an attack of asthma or angina pectoris.
                        The variety is temporary only. Interstitial emphysema is characterized by
                        the presence of air in the interstitial connective tissue of the lung. It is
                        usually due to rupture of the air vesicles during paroxysms of coughing.</p>

                   <p>(5) Surgery of the Respiratory System</p>
                   <p>About the middle of the 19th century, Manuel Garcia demonstrated the working
                        of the vocal cords in the living subject, by placing a flat mirror of about
                        the size of a shilling at the back of the mouth, and throwing strong light
                        on to it from a concave mirror fixed upon the observer’s forehead. By the
                        use of a laryngoscope and a cocaine spray the most irritable throat can now
                        be made tolerant of the presence of the small mirror, and thus the medical
                        man is enabled to make a prolonged and thorough examination of the interior
                        of the larynx and even to perform delicate operations upon it. Foreign
                        bodies which have become caught in the larynx can thus be seen and
                        extracted, and small growths can be satisfactorily removed even from the
                        vocal cords themselves.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">A foreign body in the air-passages</hi> may be impacted
                        above the vocal cords, and the prompt thrusting down of a finger may
                        dislodge it and save the person from death by suffocation. If there is doubt
                        as to the site of the impaction, and the symptoms are urgent (as is likely
                        to be the case) immediate <hi rend="italic">Iaryngotomy</hi> should be done.
                        In this operation a tube is introduced through the crevice which can easily
                        be felt Inthemiddlelineoftheneck, between the thyroid and cricoid
                        cartilages. The procedure is easily and quickly accomplished. It is,
                        moreover,often resorted to when the surgeon is about to perform some
                        extensive operation in the mouth which must needs be accompanied by free
                        haemorrhage. Laryngotomy having been done, and the pharynx having been
                        plugged with gauze, the air passages can be kept free of blood during the
                        whole operation.</p>
                   <p>If the foreign body be such a thing as a button, cherry-stone, sugar-plum or
                        coin, it may at once set up alarming symptoms of spasmodic suffocation. But
                        when the first alarm has quieted down, the attacks are likely to be only
                        occasional, as when the article, drawn up with the expired air, comes in
                        contact with the under aspect of the vocal cords. It may be that in a
                        violent fit of coughing it will be expelled, but, if not, the surgeon must
                        be at hand ready to perform tracheotomy when the urgency of the symptoms
                        demands it. <hi rend="italic">Tracheotomy</hi> is the making of an opening
                        into the trachea, the air-tube below the larynx. It is unsafe to leave a
                        child with a foreign body loose in its windpipe, on account of the risk of
                        sudden and fatal asphyxia. Possibly the X-rays may show its exact position
                        and give help in its removal. But, in any case, the safest thing will be to
                        perform tracheotomy and to leave the edges of the opening into the windpipe
                        wide asunder, so that the object may be coughed out —the nurse being on
                        guard all the while. The operation of tracheotomy is sometimes urgently
                        called for in the case in</p>

                        the spout of a kettle or teapot, or in the case of obstruction by the
                        swelling of the acute inflammation of laryngitis or of diphtheria. Should
                        the air-way through the larynx become narrowed by the presence of a growth
                        which does not diminish under the influence of iodide of potassium, the
                        question may arise as to whether it should be dealt with by Sphtting the
                        thyroid cartilage and holding the wings apart, or by the removal of the
                        whole larynx. For such growths are often malignant. If the wide infection of
                        the lymphatic glands of the neck suggests that no radical operation should
                        be undertaken, a bent silver tube may be introduced below the growth
                        (tracheotomy) in order to provide for the entrance of air. This will get
                        over the difficulty of breathing, but it cannot, of course, do more than
                        that.</p>
