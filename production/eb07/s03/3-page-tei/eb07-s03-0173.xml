The sum, though large in appearance, was scarcely more than the intrinsic value of the gold and silver medals, the ores and precious stones that were found in it; for in his last will he declares, that the first cost of the whole amounted at least to L.50,000. Besides his library, consisting of more than fifty thousand volumes, three hundred and forty-seven of which were illustrated with cuts finely engraven and coloured from nature, there were three thousand five hundred and sixty manuscripts, and an infinite number of rare and curious works of every kind. The parliament accepted the legacy, and fulfilled the conditions.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SLOBODSK-Urraine,</hi> a province of European Russia, which extends in north latitude from 48° 35' to 51º 16', and in east longitude from 34º 10' to 38<hi rend="superscript">o</hi>21', comprehending 26,217 square miles. It is an elevated plain, over which few hills are to be seen. It contains but few forests, and the soil is generally dry, but by no means unfruitful. There are many small rivulets and rivers, which discharge their waters into either the Don or the Dnieper. The climate is considered healthy, though intensely hot in summer, and as severely cold in winter. The land varies in quality, but much of it is highly productive in com. The inhabitants are of various races, some of them of Little Russian origin, others Cossacs, others from Great Russia, many called colonists, consisting chiefly of Germans or Poles, a tew Kalmucks, and many Jews. The whole population is 718,500, the far greater part of whom adhere to the Greek church, but there are Arminians, Catholics, Lutherans, and a few Mahomedans and Pagans. The province is divided into twelve circles, and contains 15 cities, 547 parishes, with 1180 market-towns and villages. The capital is Charkow, or Kharkow, in latitude 49. 59. 20., and longitude 36. 10. E.</p><p>SLOT, in the sportsman’s language, a term used to express the mark of the foot of a stag or other animal proper for the chace in the clay or earth, by which they are enabled to guess when the animal passed, and which way he went. The slot, or treading of the stag, is very nicely studied on this occasion. If the slot be large, deeply imprinted in the ground, and with an open cleft, and, added to these marks, there is a large space between mark and mark, it is certain that the stag is an old one. If there be observed the slots or treadings of two, the one long and the other round, and both of one size, the long slot is always that of the larger animal. There is also another way of knowing the old ones from the young ones by the treading; which is, that the hinder feet of the old ones never reach to their fore feet, whereas those of the young ones do.</p><p>SLOUGH, a market town of the county of Buckingham, in the hundred of Stoke. Though a town it is not a parish, one part being within the parish of Upton, and another part in the parish of Stoke Poggis. It is twenty miles from London and two from Eton, and is furnished with excellent inns, being on the great road to Bath and Bristol. It has a market on Thursday. It is chiefly remarkable from having been the residence of the celebrated astronomer Dr. Herschel, who constructed, in a garden near the road, his large and invaluable telescope, and made those discoveries in the heavens which have immortalised his name.</p><p>SLUICE, a frame of timber, stone, or other matter, serving to retain and raise the water of a river, and on occasion to let it pass.</p><p>Such is the sluice of a mill, which stops and collects the water of a rivulet, to let it fall at length in greater plenty upon the mill-wheel; such also are those used as vents or drains to discharge water off land; and such are the sluices of Flanders, which serve to prevent the waters of the sea from overflowing the lower lands.</p><p>Sometimes there is a kind of canal inclosed between two gates or sluices, in artificial navigations, to save the water, and render the passage of boats equally easy and safe, upwards and downwards; as in the sluices of Briare in France, which are a kind of massive wails built parallel to each other, at the distance of twenty or twenty-four feet, closed with strong gates at each end, between which is a kind of canal or chamber, considerably longer than broad ; in which a vessel being inclosed, the water is let out at the first gate, by which the water is raised fifteen or sixteen feet, and passed out of this canal into another much higher. By such means a boat is conveyed out of the Loire into the Seine, though the ground between them rises above one hundred and fifty feet higher than either of those rivers.</p><p>Sluices are made in different ways, according to the use for which they are intended. When they serve for navigation, they are shut with two gates, presenting an angle towards the stream ; when they are made near the sea, two pair of gates are made, the one to keep the water out and the other in, as occasion requires. In this case, the gates towards the sea present an angle that way, and the others the contrary way; and the space inclosed by those gates is called the <hi rend="italic">chamber.</hi> When sluices are made in the ditches of a fortress, to keep up the water in some parts, instead of gates, shutters are marie so as to slide up and down in grooves ; and when they are made to raise an inundation, they are then shut by means of square timbers let down in cullises, so as to lie close and firm.</p><p>The word <hi rend="italic">sluice</hi> is formed of the French <hi rend="italic">escluse,</hi> which Menage derives from the Latin <hi rend="italic">exclusa,</hi> which is found in the Salic law in the same sense. But this is to be restricted to the sluices of mills, for as to those serving to raise vessels, they were wholly unknown to the ancients.</p><p>SLUR, in <hi rend="italic">Musical Notation, </hi>a curved line drawn over two or more notes, signifying, that these are to be performed in a smooth and connected manner <hi rend="italic">(legato.)</hi> When the slur is applied to two notes of the same degree, this generally occurs in what is called a <hi rend="italic">syncopation, i.e</hi>. where a note of the accented time of the measure is united with a note of the same name belonging to the unaccented time immediately preceding, thus:</p><p>SLUYS, a town of Dutch Flanders, opposite the island of Cadsand, with a good harbour, ten miles north of Bruges, containing 14,000 inhabitants. Long. 3. 25. E. Lat. 51. 19. N.</p><p>SLUZK, a city, the capital of a circle of the same name, in the province of Minsk in West Russia, 715 miles from St. Petersburg. It is situated on a river which gives it its name, is the best city in the province, contains two Catholic, two Greek, a Lutheran, and a Reformed church, and 1000 houses, with 5800 inhabitants, among whom are many Jews. There is a public school or college, where mathematics and natural philosophy are taught. Its chief employment is in agriculture. Lat. 53. 3. Long. 27. 22.
