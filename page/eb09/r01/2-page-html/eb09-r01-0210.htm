<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">also he made surveys of the coast about Cape Calymere, and of the Paumben Passage. Shortly afterwards, having gone to&nbsp;Calcutta, he found in Captain Tinker, the officer commanding the&nbsp;king’s squadron there, a gentleman with whom he had been&nbsp;slightly acquainted in the navy. There was evidently something&nbsp;very engaging in Rennell’s manner, aspect, and character, for&nbsp;others as well as Captain Tinker immediately endeavoured to&nbsp;interest in his fortunes the governor of the presidency. This was&nbsp;Henry Vansittart, the successor of Clive, and father of Nicolas&nbsp;Vansittart, who was so long chancellor of the exchequer (1812-1823), and died Lord Bexley. The result was the appointment of&nbsp;Rennell as surveyor of the E. I. Company’s dominions in Bengal,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">“before,” as he writes, “I was scarcely apprised of the matter.” A few days later he received a commission “for practitioner&nbsp;engineer in the citadel erecting at Calcutta near Fort William”—&nbsp;the fortress, in fact, now so well known by the latter name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rennell, in a letter announcing his appointment, calls it that of “surveyor-general,” but this term is not used in the official record,&nbsp;dated April 9, 1764.@@<sup>1</sup> The date of his commission in the corps of&nbsp;engineers, as ensign (or “practitioner engineer,” as the junior&nbsp;rank was termed), is the same. The corps of Bengal Engineers,&nbsp;which after a creditable existence of just about a century was&nbsp;amalgamated with the Royal Engineers in 1862, was then in its&nbsp;infancy. Only four officers appear as having had commissions&nbsp;earlier than James Rennell, though the subsequent introduction of&nbsp;several officers with higher rank eventually placed more than this&nbsp;number over his head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Practically, though he was sometimes engaged in works of construction or demolition,@@<sup>2</sup> Rennell’s־work as a surveyor occupied the whole of his Indian service, which extended to thirteen years&nbsp;only. In the course of this employment he reduced to order and&nbsp;substantial accurac}' the map of Bengal, and accumulated a great&nbsp;part of the material which he afterwards utilized in the determination of all the important points embraced in the first approximately correct map of India. His merits were highly appreciated,&nbsp;and his rise was rapid. In January 1767 his position was raised&nbsp;to that of surveyor-general, and at the same time he was promoted&nbsp;to captain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In their letter to the court of directors, reporting this promotion, the council at Fort William say :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ We have appointed Captain Rennell, a young man of distinguished merit in this branch, surveyor-general, and directed him to form one general chart from&nbsp;those already made, and such as are now on hand, as they can be-collected in.&nbsp;This, though attended with great labour, does not prevent his prosecuting his&nbsp;own surveys, the fatigue of which, with the desperate wounds he has lately&nbsp;received in one of them, have already left him but a shattered constitution.’’@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">This passage refers to a memorable passage in Rennell’s career, which had nearly proved its tragical termination. Bengal proper&nbsp;was in those early days of the Company’s administration very far&nbsp;from being the tranquil country that we have known it for so&nbsp;many years (except indeed during its partial share in the agitations&nbsp;of 1857, from the mutiny of several regiments within its boundaries). And it was about a year before the promotion just&nbsp;mentioned that Rennell, on one of his surveying campaigns in&nbsp;northern Bengal, met with the adventure in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The districts in that quarter (Purniah, Dinajpur, Rangpur, &amp;c.) were at that time habitually ravaged by bodies of marauders,&nbsp;who had their headquarters in the forest-tracts at the foot of the&nbsp;Himalayas, and beyond British jurisdiction. From these forests&nbsp;they used to issue annually in large bands, plundering and levying&nbsp;exactions far and wide, and returning to their jungle-asylum when&nbsp;threatened with pursuit. A few years before (1763) a large body of&nbsp;them had plundered the city of Dacca. They professed to belong to&nbsp;a religious fraternity and were commonly known as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sanyasis,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> a&nbsp;name under which they are frequently mentioned in the correspondence of Warren Hastings, sometimes as </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Fakirs.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> The affair&nbsp;took place in the semi-independent state of Kucli Behar, near the&nbsp;border of Bhutan. Hearing that a party of native soldiers had&nbsp;been sent to put down one of those bands, which had just taken&nbsp;and plundered the capital of the state, Rennell hastened to&nbsp;join the detachment with his own small escort, and came up with&nbsp;it just after the banditti had received a beating. The next day&nbsp;(21st February 1766) was spent in pursuit of the enemy, and in&nbsp;the afternoon Rennell and two other officers, who had gone forward&nbsp;to reconnoiti’e, found themselves in presence of a large body of the&nbsp;Sanyasis. Their small escort of native horse rode off, and the&nbsp;officers were surrounded. Rennell’s Armenian assistant was killed,&nbsp;his engineer subaltern fought his way clear with a slight wound,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rennell himself retreated fighting to the detachment, and was put in a palankin, covered with sabre-wounds. One blow had cut&nbsp;into his right shoulder blade and through several ribs ; his left&nbsp;arm was severely cut in three places, and he had other wounds&nbsp;besides. For surgical help lie had to be sent to Dacca, 300 miles&nbsp;off, in an open boat, which he had to direct himself, as he lay on&nbsp;his face, whilst the natives applied onions as a cataplasm to his&nbsp;shoulder. He was long given up, but, under the tender care of&nbsp;his friend Dr Russell, he recovered, though his health was long&nbsp;affected by the loss of blood and severity of the injuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">On two later occasions Rennell’s letters speak of his being attacked or waylaid whilst on survey, in one case by irregulars in&nbsp;the employment of the “jemitdars,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i. e</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">., “zemindars,” in districts&nbsp;remote from Calcutta, and on another occasion by the “ Bootese,”&nbsp;or Bhutias, as we now call them. In a letter dated 30th October&nbsp;1770 he says in his brief way :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ I must not forget to tell you that about a month ago a large leopard jumped at me, and I was fortunate enough to kill him by thrusting my bayonet down&nbsp;his throat. Five of. my men were wounded by him, tour of them very dangerously. You see 1 am a lucky fellow at all times.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We gather from this passage that it was common in those days for officers to carry bayonets,—a circumstance which is also set&nbsp;forth in one of the best known portraits of General Wolfe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Shortly after this last adventure Rennell was allowed to carry out, with a force under his command, a project that he had&nbsp;formed for the suppression of the banditti in the north. Writing&nbsp;on the 3d March 1771, he speaks of having returned successful&nbsp;from this expedition, after marching 320 miles in fifteen days,&nbsp;which he justly observes was “pretty good travelling in that&nbsp;climate, especially for soldiers.” This did not, however, put an&nbsp;end to the Sanyasis, for they are spoken of by Hastings as still a&nbsp;pest in 1773 and 1774.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rennell’s usual residence was at Dacca, though his visits to Calcutta were at least annual. On one of these he married (October&nbsp;15, 1772) Miss Jane Thackeray, one of the sixteen children of&nbsp;Archdeacon Thackeray, who had been headmaster of Harrow from&nbsp;1746 to his death in 1760, and who has been called by Dr Butler&nbsp;the “second founder” of the school.<sup>4</sup> Among Dr Thackeray’s&nbsp;descendants are to be counted many distinguished Anglo-Indians ;&nbsp;and William Makepeace Thackeray of the Civil Service, the&nbsp;grandfather of the great writer who has made that combination of&nbsp;names familiar and illustrious, was a friend of IIennell’s and the&nbsp;brother of his wife.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Indian careers were not in those days generally prolonged. Fortunes were reaped more rapidly than in later years, and death&nbsp;likewise mowed with swifter strokes. In the list of Bengal&nbsp;engineers there are thirteen, including Rennell, who received commissions prior to 1770, the earliest in 1761. Of these thirteen,&nbsp;before 1780, six were dead, four had resigned, one had been dismissed, and two only in the year named remained in the service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rennell’s health had been remarkably good up to his encounter with the Sanyasis, but from that time it became permanently&nbsp;deteriorated, and in 1777 he resigned, having attained the rank of&nbsp;major two years earlier (January 1775). In those days no regular&nbsp;pension-system existed ; but, when permission for Rennell’s retirement was given, in December 1776, by the governor and council,&nbsp;it was accompanied by the grant of a pension of 500 rupees a&nbsp;month from the Calcutta treasury, till the court’s pleasure should&nbsp;be known. In passing this resolution the board remark that they&nbsp;“ think fit to adopt this mode as most satisfactory to Major Rennell,&nbsp;whose fortune will not permit him to leave India without some&nbsp;certainty of support in the decline of life.”@@<sup>5</sup> It is impossible, in&nbsp;reading this last phrase, to withhold a smile at the proverbial&nbsp;longevity of pensioners, when we remember that the illustrious&nbsp;subject of the resolution drew the allowance for fifty-three years&nbsp;after his retirement. The court of directors, after his arrival in&nbsp;England, conferred a pension of £600 a year in lieu of the Calcutta&nbsp;one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Major Rennell and his wife, with a daughter born at St Helena during a stoppage on the way home, reached England, 12th&nbsp;February 1778. For the rest of his long life he lived in London,&nbsp;and for much the greater part of the time in Nassau Street&nbsp;(formerly called Suffolk Street) near the Middlesex Hospital, a&nbsp;quarter then inhabited by gentlefolks, though now quite deserted&nbsp;by fashion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">When applying in 1776 for permission to retire, Rennell had written—“I desire not to eat the bread of idleness, but rather to&nbsp;make myself as useful as possible, even after my return to England, ”&nbsp;and went on to submit a scheme for the utilization of the large mass&nbsp;of geographical material laid up and perishing in the India House.@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>He cannot have been long in England before he buckled to this&nbsp;task. He is said to have been offered employment of a considerable&nbsp;character and to have declined it. Of this we know no more ; but&nbsp;apparently he had laid out his own course of life, in devoting him-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
