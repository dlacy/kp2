<p><span class="font0">ly underſtaiid it to be, would be to reduce it to a heap of unintelligible jargon and inconliſtency. If one man&nbsp;have a right to be free, another man cannot have a right&nbsp;to make him a ſlave ; if one man have a right to inflict&nbsp;chaſtifement upon me, I cannot have a right to withdraw myſelf ſrom chaſtifement ; if my neighbour have&nbsp;a right to a ſum of money in my poſſeſſion, I cannot</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">. have a right to retain it in my pocket. It cannot be leſs incontrovertible, that I have no right to omit what&nbsp;my duty preſcribes. From hence it inevitably follows&nbsp;that men have no rights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ It is commonly ſaid, ‘ that a man has a right to the diſpoſal of his fortune, a right to the employment&nbsp;of his time, a right to the uncontrolled choice of his&nbsp;profeſſion or purfuits.<sup>,</sup> But this can never be confidently affirmed till it can be ſhown that he has no duties,&nbsp;preſcribing and limiting his mode of proceeding in all&nbsp;theſe reſpects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ In reality, nothing can appear more wonderful to a careful inquirer, than that two ideas ſo incompatible&nbsp;as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">man</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rights</span><span class="font0"> ſliould ever have been aſſociated toge-gether. Certain it is, that one of them muſt be utterly&nbsp;excluſive and annihilatory of the other. Before we&nbsp;aſcribe rights to man, we muſt conceive of him as a&nbsp;being endowed with intellect, and capable of diſcerning&nbsp;the differences and tendencies of things. But a being&nbsp;endowed with intellect, and capable of diſcerning the&nbsp;differences and tendencies of things, inſtantly becomes&nbsp;a moral being, and has duties incumbent on him to&nbsp;diſcharge : and duties and rights, as has already been&nbsp;ſhown, are abſolutely excluſive of each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ It has been affirmed by the zealous advocates of liberty, ‘ that princes and magiſtrates have no rights ;’&nbsp;and no poſition can be more incontrovertible. There&nbsp;is no ſituation of their lives that has not its correspondent duties. There is no power intruded to them that&nbsp;they are not bound to exerciſe excluſively for the public&nbsp;good. It is ſtrange, that perſons adopting this principle did not go a ſtep farther, and perceive that the&nbsp;ſame reſtrictions were applicable to ſubjects and citizens.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This reaſoning is unanſwerable ; but it militates not againft the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rights of man</span><span class="font0"> in the uſual acceptation of the&nbsp;words, which are never employed to denote diſcretionary power, but a juſt claim on the one hand, implying&nbsp;a correſponding obligation on the other. Whether the&nbsp;phraſe be abſolutely proper is not worth the debating :&nbsp;it is authoriſed by cuſtom—the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus et norma loquendi—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and is univerſally underſtood except by ſuch as the dæ-mons of faction, in the form of paradoxical writers on&nbsp;political juſtice, have been able to miſlead by ſophiſtical&nbsp;reaſonings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rights,</span><span class="font0"> in the common acceptation of the word, are of various kinds : they are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">natural</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">adventitious,&nbsp;alienable</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">unalienable, perfect</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperſect, particular</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">general.</span><span class="font0"> See the article LibeRty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Natural</span><span class="font0"> rights are thoſe which a man has to his life, limbs, and liberty ; to the produce of his perſonal&nbsp;labour; to the uſe, in common with others, of air, light,&nbsp;and water, &amp;c. That every man has a natural right&nbsp;or juſt claim to theſe things, is evident ſrom their being&nbsp;abſolutely neceſſary to enable him to anſwer that purpoſe, whatever it may be, for which he was made a living and a rational being. This ſhows undeniably, that&nbsp;the Author of his nature deſigned that he ſhould have&nbsp;the uſe of them, and that the man who ſhould wantonly deprive him of any one of them, would be guilty of&nbsp;a breach of the divine law, as well as act inconſiſtently&nbsp;with the fitneſs of things in evere ſenſe in which that&nbsp;phraſe can poſſibly be underſtood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Adventitious</span><span class="font0"> rights are thoſe which a king has over his ſubjects, a general over his ſoldicrs, a huſhand to the&nbsp;perſon and affections of his wife, and which every man&nbsp;has to the greater part of his property. That the rights&nbsp;of the king and the general are adventitious, is univerſally admitted. The rights of property have been conſidered elſewhere (ſee Property); and though the human conſtitution ſhows ſufficiently that men and women&nbsp;have a natural right to the uſe of each other, yet it is&nbsp;evident that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">excluſive</span><span class="font0"> right of any one man to any&nbsp;one woman, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vice νerfα,</span><span class="font0"> muſt be an adventitious&nbsp;right : But the important queſtion is, How are adventitious rights acquired ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In anſwer to this queſtion, the moraliſt who deduces the laws of virtue from the will of God, obſerves, that&nbsp;as God appears from his works to be a benevolent Being, who wills the happineſs of all his creatures (ſee&nbsp;Metaphysics, n<sup>0</sup>312.), he muſt of courſe will every&nbsp;thing which naturally tjnds to promote that happineſs»&nbsp;But the exiſtence of civil ſociety evidently contributes&nbsp;in a great degree to promote the ſum of human happineſs (ſee Society) ; and therefore whatever is neceſſary for the ſupport of civil ſociety in general, or for&nbsp;the conduct of particular ſocieties already eſtabliſhed,&nbsp;muſt be agreeable to the will of God : But the allegiance of ſubjects to their ſovereign, the obedience of&nbsp;ſoldiers to their leader, the protection of private property, and the fulfilling of contracts, are all abſolutely&nbsp;neceſſary to the ſupport of ſociety: and hence the&nbsp;rights of kings, generals, huſhands, and wives, &amp;c.&nbsp;though adventitious, and immediately derived ſrom human appointment, are not leſs ſacredthan natural rights,&nbsp;ſince tney may all be ultimately traced to the ſame&nbsp;ſource. The ſame concluſion may eaſily be drawn by&nbsp;the philoſopher, who reſts moral obligation on the fitneſs of things or on a moral ſenſe; only it muſt in each&nbsp;of theſe caſes partake of the inſtability of its foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the ſacredneſs of the rights of marriage, an author already quoted has lately urged ſome declamatory objections. “ It is abſurd (ſays he) to expect, that&nbsp;the inclinations and wiſhes of two human beings ſhould&nbsp;coincide through any long period of time. To oblige&nbsp;them to act and to live together, is to ſubject them to&nbsp;ſome inevitable portion of thwarting, bickering, and&nbsp;unhappineſs. Ί his cannot be otherwiſe, ſo long as&nbsp;man has failed to reach the ſtandard of abſolute perfection. The ſuppofition that I muſt have a companion&nbsp;for life, is the reſult of a complication of vices. It is&nbsp;the dictate of cowardice, and not of fortitude. It flows&nbsp;from the deine of being loved and eſteemed for ſome-thing that is not deſert.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ But the evil of marriage, as it is practiſed in European countries, lies deeper than this. The habit is, for a thoughtleſs and romantic youth of each ſex to&nbsp;come together, to ſee each other for a few times, and&nbsp;under circumſtances full of deluſion, and then to vow to&nbsp;each other eternal attachment. What is the conſequence of this? In almoſt every inſtance they find themſelves deceived. They are reduced to make the bell&nbsp;of an irretrievable miſtake. They are preſented with&nbsp;the ſtrongeſt imaginable temptation to become the dupes</span></p>
