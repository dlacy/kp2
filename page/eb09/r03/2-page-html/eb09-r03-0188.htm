<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Locomotor Organs.—</span><span class="font0">While, as mentioned above, several genera or individual species present long spines, these&nbsp;become movable, and may be spoken of as appendages, in&nbsp;two genera only. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polyarthra</span><span class="font0"> (fig. 1, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">e, f)</span><span class="font0"> there are&nbsp;four groups of processes or plumes placed at the sides of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the body, each of which groups can be separately moved up and down by means of muscular fibres attached to their&nbsp;bases, which project into the body. The processes themselves are unjointed and rigid. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pedalion</span><span class="font0"> (fig. 3), a&nbsp;remarkable form discovered by Dr C. J. Hudson in 1871&nbsp;(12, 13, 14, and 15), and found in numbers several times&nbsp;since, these appendages have acquired a new and quite&nbsp;special development. They are six in number. The largest&nbsp;is placed ventrally at some distance below the mouth. Its&nbsp;free extremity is a plumose fan-like expansion (fig. 3,&nbsp;A, α, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">h).</span><span class="font0"> It is (in common with the others) a hollow&nbsp;process into which ruu two pairs of broad, coarsely transversely striated muscles. Each pair has a single insertion&nbsp;on the inner wall—the one pair near the free extremity of&nbsp;the limb, the other near its attachment; the bands run&nbsp;up, one of each pair on each side and run right round&nbsp;the body forming an incomplete muscular girdle, the ends&nbsp;approximating in the median dorsal line. Below this&nbsp;point springs the large median dorsal limb, which terminates in groups of long setæ. It presents a single pair of&nbsp;muscles attached along its inner wall which run up and&nbsp;form a muscular girdle round the body in its posterior&nbsp;third. On each side is attached a superior dorso-lateral&nbsp;and an inferior ventro-lateral appendage, each with a fanlike plumose termination consisting of compound hairs,&nbsp;found elsewhere only among the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crustacea</span><span class="font0"> ; each of these&nbsp;is moved by muscles running upwards towards the neck&nbsp;and arising immediately under the trochal disk, the inferior&nbsp;ventro-lateral pair also presenting muscles which form a&nbsp;girdle in the hind region of the body. Various other&nbsp;muscles are present : there are two complete girdles in the&nbsp;neck region immediately behind the mouth; there are also&nbsp;muscles which move the hinder region of the body. In&nbsp;addition to these the body presents various processes&nbsp;which are perhaps some of them unrepresented in other&nbsp;Rotifers. In the median dorsal line immediately below&nbsp;the trochal disk there is a short conical process presenting&nbsp;a pair of muscles which render it capable of slight movement. From a recess at the extremity of this process&nbsp;spring a group of long setose hairs the bases of which are&nbsp;connected with a filament probably nervous in nature.&nbsp;This doubtless represents a structure found in many&nbsp;Rotifers, and variously known as the “calcar,” “siphon,”&nbsp;“tentaculum,” or “antenna.” This calcar is double in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tubicolaria</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Melicerta.</span><span class="font0"> It is very well developed in&nbsp;the genera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifer, Philodina,</span><span class="font0"> and others, and is, when so&nbsp;developed, slightly retractile. It appears to be represented in many forms by a pit or depression set with hairs.&nbsp;The calcar has been considered both as an intromittent&nbsp;organ and a respiratory tube for the admission of water.&nbsp;It is now, however, universally considered to be sensory&nbsp;in nature. Various forms present processes in other parts</span></p>

They possibly re</span></p>
