<p><span class="font0">Now too the feudal system was converting the officers of the I empire into independent princes, and the new spirit of&nbsp;communal liberty was giving freedom to the cities. Otho&nbsp;once more united the empire and the church, Italy and&nbsp;Germany, in order to combat these new foes. But the&nbsp;difficulties of the enterprise at once came to light. John&nbsp;XII., finding a master in the protector he had invoked,&nbsp;now joined the discontented nobles who were conspiring&nbsp;with Berengarius against the emperor. But the latter&nbsp;hastened to Rome in November 963, assembled the clergy,&nbsp;nobles, and heads of the people, and made them take an oath&nbsp;never again to elect a pope without his consent and that of&nbsp;his son. He also convoked a synod presided over by himself&nbsp;in St Peter’s, which judged, condemned, and deposed Pope&nbsp;John and elected Leo VIIL (963-965), a Roman noble, in&nbsp;his stead. All this was done at the direct bidding of&nbsp;the emperor, who thus deprived the Romans of their&nbsp;most valued privilege, the right of choosing their own&nbsp;pope. But the people had now risen to considerable&nbsp;importance, and, for the first time, we find it officially&nbsp;represented in the synod by the plebeian Pietro, surnamed&nbsp;Imperiola, together with the leaders of the militia, which&nbsp;had also become a popular institution since Alberic’s reign.&nbsp;It was no longer easy to keep the lower orders in subjection, and by their junction with the malcontent nobles&nbsp;they formed a very respectable force. On the 3d January&nbsp;964 they sounded the battle-peal and attacked the Vatican,&nbsp;where the emperor was lodged. The German knights&nbsp;repulsed them with much slaughter, and this bloodshed&nbsp;proved the beginning of an endless feud. Otho departed&nbsp;in February, and John XII., as the chosen pope of the&nbsp;Romans, returned with an army of followers and compelled the defenceless Leo VIII. to seek safety in flight.&nbsp;Soon afterwards Leo was deposed and excommunicated by&nbsp;a new synod, and many of his adherents were cruelly&nbsp;murdered. But on the 14th May 964 John suddenly&nbsp;expired ; the Romans, amid violent struggles and tumults,&nbsp;resumed their rights, elected Benedict V. and procured&nbsp;his consecration in spite of the emperor’s veto. Otho now&nbsp;appeared at the head of an army, committed fresh slaughter,&nbsp;besieged the city, reduced it by famine, and, after holding&nbsp;a council which deposed Benedict and sent him a prisoner&nbsp;to Hamburg, restored Leo VIII. to the papal throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, although the emperor thus disposed of the papacy at his will, his arbitrary exercise of power roûsed a long and obstinate resistance, which had no slight effect upon the history&nbsp;of the commune. Leo VIII. died in 965, and the imperial&nbsp;party elected John XIIL (965-972). Upon this the nobles&nbsp;of the national party joined the people, and there was a&nbsp;general revolt. The nobles were led by Pietro, prefect of&nbsp;Rome. As we have noted, this office seemed to be extinct&nbsp;during the Carolingian rule, but we again meet with it in&nbsp;955, after an interval of a century and a half. The leaders&nbsp;of the people were twelve </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">decarconi,</span><span class="font0"> a term of unknown&nbsp;derivation, but probably indicating chiefs of the twelve&nbsp;regions </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{dodecarchi, dodecarcoηi, decarconi).</span><span class="font0"> The new&nbsp;pope was seized and confined, first in Castle St Angelo,&nbsp;then in a fortress in the Campagna. But the emperor&nbsp;qτiιckly marched an army against Rome, and this sufficed&nbsp;to produce a reaction which recalled the pope (November&nbsp;966), sent the prefect into exile, and put several of the&nbsp;rebellious nobles to death. And shortly after the emperor&nbsp;sacked the city. Many Romans were exiled, some tortured,&nbsp;others, including the twelve </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">decarconi,</span><span class="font0"> killed. John XIII.&nbsp;died in 972 and Otho in 973.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All these events clearly prove how great a change had now taken place in the conditions of Rome. The people&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(plebs)</span><span class="font0"> had made its appearance upon the stage ; the army&nbsp;had become democratic; the twelve regions were regularly&nbsp;organized under leaders. Opposed to them stood the&nbsp;nobles, headed by the prefect, also a noble, precisely as in&nbsp;Florence the nobles and the podestà were later opposed&nbsp;to the guilds and the people. So far, it is true, nobles&nbsp;and people had made common cause in Rome ; but this&nbsp;harmony was soon to be interrupted. The feudal spirit&nbsp;had made its way among the Roman aristocrats, had&nbsp;split them into two parties and diminished their strength.&nbsp;It was now destined to spread, and, as it was always&nbsp;vigorously detested and opposed by the people elsewhere&nbsp;in Italy, so the same consequence was inevitable in Rome.&nbsp;Another notable change, and a subject of unending controversy, had also occurred in the administration of justice.&nbsp;So far there were the judices de clero, also known as&nbsp;ordinary or palatine judges, and the judices de militia,&nbsp;also styled consules or duces. These judges generally&nbsp;formed a court of seven, three being de clero, four de&nbsp;militia, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa,</span><span class="font0"> under the presidency of the papal or&nbsp;imperial missi. In criminal cases the judices de militia&nbsp;had the prefect or the imperial missus for their president.&nbsp;But there was a third order of judges called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pedanei, a&nbsp;COnsulibus creatk</span><span class="font0"> It seems clear that the duces, being&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">distributi per judicatus,</span><span class="font0"> found themselves isolated in the&nbsp;provinces, and to obtain assistance nominated these pedanei,&nbsp;who were legal experts. In Rome, with its courts of&nbsp;law, they were less needed, but possibly in those sections&nbsp;of the city where cases of minor importance were submitted to a single magistrate reference was made to&nbsp;the pedanei. But many changes were made under the&nbsp;Franks, and when the edict of Lothair (824) granted&nbsp;free choice of either the Roman or Germanic laιv, and the&nbsp;duces were replaced by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comites</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gαstaldioηes,</span><span class="font0"> chiefly&nbsp;of German origin, the use of legal experts became increasingly necessary. And the custom of employing them was&nbsp;the more easily diffused by being already common among&nbsp;the Franks, whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scabini</span><span class="font0"> were legal experts acting as&nbsp;judges, though not qualified to pass sentence. Thus the&nbsp;pedanei multiplied, came to resemble the scabini, and were&nbsp;designated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices dαtivi (a magistratu dαti)</span><span class="font0"> or simply&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dativi.</span><span class="font0"> These were to be found in the exarchate in 838,&nbsp;but not in Rome until 961, when the judices de militia&nbsp;had ceased to exist. The great progress of the German&nbsp;legal procedure may then have contributed to the formation of the new office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile Pope John XIII. had been succeeded by Benedict VI. (973-974) and Otho I. by his son Otho II.,&nbsp;a youth of eighteen married to the Byzantine princess&nbsp;Theophano. Thereupon the Romans, who had supported&nbsp;the election of another pope, and were in no awe of the&nbsp;new emperor, rose to arms under the command of&nbsp;Crescenzio, a rich and powerful noble. They not only&nbsp;seized Benedict VI. by force, but strangled him in Castle&nbsp;St Angelo. The national and imperial parties then&nbsp;elected several popes who were either exiled or persecuted, and one of them was said to be murdered. In&nbsp;985 John XV. was elected (985-996). During this turmoil, the national party, composed of nobles and people,&nbsp;led by Giovanni Crescenzio, son of the other Crescenzio&nbsp;mentioned above, had taken complete possession of the&nbsp;government. This Crescenzio assumed the title of patrician, and sought to imitate Alberic, although far his&nbsp;inferior in capacity. Fortunately for him the reigning&nbsp;pope was a detested tyrant, and the emperor a child&nbsp;entirely guided by his mother. But the new emperor&nbsp;Otho III. was backed by a powerful party, and on coming&nbsp;to Rome in 996 was able, although only aged fifteen,&nbsp;to quell the rebellion, oust Crescenzio from public life,&nbsp;and elect as successor to John XV. his own cousin, Pope&nbsp;Gregory V. (996-999). But this first German pope surrounded himself with compatriots, and by raising them&nbsp;to lofty posts even in the tribunals excited a revolt that</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
