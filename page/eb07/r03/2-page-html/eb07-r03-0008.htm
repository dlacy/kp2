<p><span class="font0">been virtuous, nobody at least has felt it more, or made it appear to greater advantage. What is most to be lamented&nbsp;is, that in wishing to educate a young man as a Christian,&nbsp;he has filled a volume with objections against Christianity.&nbsp;It must be confessed that he has given a very sublime eulogium on the gospel, and an affecting portrait of its divine&nbsp;Author ; but the miracles and the prophecies, which serve to&nbsp;establish his mission, he attacks without reserve. Admitting&nbsp;only natural religion, he weighs every thing in the balance&nbsp;of reason ; and this reason being false, leads him into dilemmas which are very unfavourable to his own repose and&nbsp;happiness. The French parliament condemned this book in&nbsp;1762, and entered into a criminal prosecution against the&nbsp;author, which forced him to make a precipitate retreat. He&nbsp;directed his steps towards his native country, but it shut its&nbsp;gates upon him. Proscribed in the place where he had first&nbsp;drawn breath, he sought an asylum in Switzerland, and&nbsp;found one in the principality of Neufchatel. But the protection of the king of Prussia, to whom the principality belonged, was not sufficient to rescue him from that obloquy&nbsp;which the minister of Moutiers-Travers, the village to which&nbsp;he had retired, had excited against him. He preached&nbsp;against Rousseau, and his sermons produced an uproar&nbsp;amongst the people. On the night between the 6th and the&nbsp;7th of September 1765, some fanatics, inspired by wine and&nbsp;the declamations of their minister, threw stones at the windows of the Genevan philosopher, who, fearing new insults,&nbsp;in vain sought an asylum in the canton of Berne. As this&nbsp;canton was connected with the republic of Geneva, they&nbsp;did not think proper to allow him to remain in their city,&nbsp;who was proscribed by that republic. Neither his broken&nbsp;state of health, nor the approach of winter, could soften the&nbsp;hearts of these obdurate Switzers. To prevent them from&nbsp;the fear they had of the spreading of his opinions, he in&nbsp;vain beseeched them to shut him up in prison till the spring.&nbsp;But even this favour was denied him. Obliged to set out on&nbsp;a journey in the beginning of a most inclement season, he&nbsp;reached Strasbourg in a very destitute situation. He received from Marshal de Contades, who then commanded&nbsp;in that place, every accommodation which could be expected from generosity, humanity, and compassion. He waited&nbsp;there till the weather became milder, when he went to Paris,&nbsp;where Mr Hume then was. The English philosopher determined upon taking him with him to England. After having&nbsp;made some stay in Paris, Rousseau, in 1766, actually set out&nbsp;for London. Hume, much affected with his situation and his&nbsp;misfortunes, procured for him a very agreeable retreat in the&nbsp;country. The Genevan philosopher, however, did not long&nbsp;remain satisfied. He made less impression on the minds of&nbsp;the English than he had done on the French. His free disposition, and his obdurate melancholy temper, were deemed&nbsp;no singularity in England. He was there looked upon as&nbsp;an ordinary man, and the periodical prints were filled with&nbsp;satires against him. In particular, they published a forged&nbsp;letter from the king of Prussia, holding up to ridicule the&nbsp;principles and conduct of this new Diogenes. Rousseau,&nbsp;imagining there was a plot between Hume and some philosophers in France to destroy his glory and repose, sent a&nbsp;letter to him, filled with the most abusive expressions, and&nbsp;reproaching him for his conduct towards him. From this&nbsp;time he looked upon Hume as a wicked and perfidious person, who had brought him to England with no other view&nbsp;than to expose him to public ridicule ; a foolish and chimerical idea, which was nourished by self-love and a restless&nbsp;disposition. He imagined that the English philosopher,&nbsp;amidst all his kindnesses, had something disagreeable in the&nbsp;manner of expressing them. The bad health of Rousseau,&nbsp;a strong and melancholy imagination, a too nice sensibility,&nbsp;a jealous disposition, joined with philosophical vanity, cherished by the false informations of his governess, who possessed an uncommon power over him ; all these taken together might have tended to prepossess him with unfavourable sentiments of some innocent freedoms his benefactor&nbsp;might have taken with him, and might have rendered him&nbsp;ungrateful, which he thought himself incapable of becoming.&nbsp;Meanwhile these false conjectures and probabilities ought&nbsp;never to have had the weight with an honest mind to withdraw itself from its friend and benefactor. Proofs are always necessary in cases of this kind ; and that which Rousseau had was by no means a certain demonstration. The&nbsp;Genevan philosopher, however, returned to France, spited&nbsp;with the world, and particularly offended with the English&nbsp;philosopher. On the let of July 1770, he appeared for the&nbsp;first time at the regency coffee-house, dressed in his ordinary&nbsp;clothing, having for some time previous to this worn an&nbsp;Armenian habit He was loaded with praises by the surrounding multitude. “ It is somewhat singular,” says M.&nbsp;Sennebier, “ to see a man so haughty as he returning to&nbsp;the very place from whence he had been banished so often.&nbsp;Nor is it one of the smallest inconsistencies of this extraordinary character, that he preferred a retreat in that place&nbsp;of which he had spoken so much ill.” It is as singular that&nbsp;a person under sentence of imprisonment should wish to live&nbsp;in so public a manner in the very place where his sentence&nbsp;was in force against him. His friends, however, procured&nbsp;for him the liberty of staying, on condition that he should&nbsp;write neither on religion nor on politics; and he kept his word,&nbsp;for he wrote none at all. He was contented with living in&nbsp;a calm and philosophical manner, cultivating the society of a&nbsp;few tried friends, shunning the company of the great, appearing to give up all his whimsies, and affecting neither the character of a philosopher nor a wit. He died of an apoplexy, at&nbsp;Ermenonville, about ten leagues from Paris, on the 2d of July&nbsp;1778, aged sixty-six years. Rousseau, during his stay in&nbsp;the environs of Lyons, married Mademoiselle le Vasseur,&nbsp;a woman who, without either beauty or talents, had gained&nbsp;over him a great ascendency, and waited on him both in&nbsp;health and in sickness. But, as if she had been jealous of possessing him alone, she drove from his mind, by the most&nbsp;perfidious insinuations, all those who came to entertain him ;&nbsp;and when he did not dismiss them, she prevented their return by invariably refusing them admittance. By these&nbsp;means she the more easily led her husband into inconsistencies of conduct, which the originality of his character,&nbsp;as well as of his opinions, so much contributed to assist.&nbsp;He did not incline to associate with any person ; and as&nbsp;this method of thinking and living was uncommon, it made&nbsp;him an object of curiosity, and procured him a name. Like&nbsp;Diogenes of old, he united simplicity of manners with pride&nbsp;of genius ; and a very large stock of indolence, with an extreme sensibility, served to render his character still more&nbsp;uncommon. “ An indolent mind,” says he, “ terrified at&nbsp;every application, a warm, bilious, and irritable temperament, sensible also in a high degree to every thing that&nbsp;can affect it, appear not possible to be united in the same&nbsp;person ; and yet these two contrarieties compose the chief&nbsp;of mine. An active life has no charms for me. I would&nbsp;an hundred times rather consent to be idle than to do any&nbsp;thing against my will ; and I have an hundred times thought&nbsp;that I would live not amiss in the Bastille, provided I had&nbsp;nothing to do but just continue there. In my younger days&nbsp;I made several attempts to get in there ; but as they were&nbsp;only with the view of procuring a refuge and rest in my old&nbsp;age, and, like the exertions of an indolent person, only by&nbsp;fits and starts, they were never attended with the smallest&nbsp;success. When misfortunes came, they afforded me a pretext for giving myself up to my ruling passion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His ideas about politics were almost as eccentric as his paradoxes about religion. Some reckon his Social Compact, which Voltaire calls the Unsocial Compact, the greatest effort of his genius ; whilst others find it full of contradictions, errors, and cynical passages, obscure, ill arranged,</span></p>
