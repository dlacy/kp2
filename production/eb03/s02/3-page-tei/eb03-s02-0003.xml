He accordingly withdrew to Scotland, but left behind him his two ſons. The lord Hume and the earl of Huntley were likewiſe diſcontented. The former had brought his men into the field; but, according to ſome Scotch hiſtorians, with a deſign rather to betray than to ſerve James: but Huntley, though he diſliked his maſter’s conduct, remained firmly attached to his perſon.</p><p>The defection or backwardneſs of thoſe great men ſeemed to make no impreſſion upon James. He had choſen a ſtrong camp in the neighbourhood of Ford, on the ſide of a mountain called Floddon-hill; and he was ſeparated from the Engliſh army by the river Till. This advantageous ſituation put the earl of Surry under great difficulties; for it rendered the Scotch army inacceſſible, as it was fortified by artillery, and was now well ſupplied with proviſions by the change of its ſituation. The earl drew up a manifeſto, with which he charged Rouge Croix herald, who was attended by a trumpet. It contained ſome propoſals for an exchange of priſoners, which ſeems to have been calculated to give the lady Ford the more credit with James; but concluded with reproaches for his perfidious invaſion of England, and a defiance to James to fight him in a general battle. The herald was farther charged with a verbal commiſſion to acquaint James, that the earl oſ Surry had iſſued orders that no quarter ſhould be given to any of the Scotch army but the king himſelf.</p><p>A council of war was called on this occaſion; in which the earl of Huntley and others made ſtrong remonſtrances againſt a general engagement. They ſhewed how fatal it muſt be to Scotland, ſhould it prove unſucceſsful; and that the wiſeſt courſe James could follow was to return home, where, if he was purſued by the enemy, he could fight to great advantage. The earl of Huntley, however, added, that his opinion ſhould be determined by that of the king and council; and that he was equally ready to ſhare in his majeſty’s danger as his glory.</p><p>Huntley and the other noblemen were oppoſed by the French ambaſſador, who repreſented a retreat as diſgraceful to the nobility of Scotland and the arms of James; and uſed many romantic arguments of the ſame kind, which but too well ſuited with the king’s diſpoſition. According to Drummond, the council were of opinion, that the king ſhould immediately beſiege Berwick; but be that as it will, the majority of them were certainly oſ opinion, that it was beneath the dignity of James to fight the earl of Surry at that nobleman’s requiſition, and that James could loſe no honour by returning home. Patrick lord Lindſay of Byres, mentioned on a former occaſion, and who was preſident of the council, expreſſed himſelf ſo ſtrongly on that head, that James, in a paſſion, is ſaid by the hiſtorian Lindſay to have ſworn, that if ever he lived to return to Scotland, he would hang that nobleman at his own gate. He ordered Rouge Croix to be called in; and after treating him with great politeneſs, he ſent a meſſage to the earl of Surry by one of his own heralds (Iſlay), importing, that he would give the Engliſh battle on the Friday following; and that had he received ſuch a meſſage from the earl even in his own caſtle of Edinburgh, he would have left that, and all other buſineſs, to have fought him. With this meſſage,</p><p>a ſmall manifeſto, in vindication of James’s conduct, was ſent by the ſame herald.</p><p>The earl of Surry, who was then ſo infirm that he was carried about in a ſedan or chariot, had foreſeen that James would return an anſwer by one of his own heralds; but, unwilling that he ſhould obtain any knowledge of the ſituation of the Engliſh camp, he ordered proper perſons to receive him at two miles diſtance, where ſoon after he attended himſelf in perſon. Iſlay executed his commiſſion without paying much reſpect to the perſon of the Engliſh general; who diſmiſſed him, after beſtowing great compliments upon the honour and courage of James. The earl then ordered his army to march in the line of battle towards Wollerhaugh. There he was joined by Rouge Croix, herald, who gave him an account of the ſtrong ſituation of the Scotttiſh camp; but the advanced poſts of the Engliſh army were then within three miles of their enemies, and the earl of Surry found his difficulties daily increaſing. The roads were broken up, the ſwelling of the rivers cut him off from the neceſſary communications for ſupplying his army, and nothing but a battle could ſave him either from being diſhanded or deſtroyed.</p><p>James ſeems to have ſo far regarded the advice of his wiſeſt counſellors, as not to abandon his ſtrong ſituation. They endeavoured to perſuade him, that it was a ſufficient guard to his honour, if he did not decline the battle on the day appointed; and that his engagement did not bind him to fight upon diſadvantageous ground. The Scots, at the ſame time, knew of their enemy’s diſtreſſes; and, as Drummond elegantly expreſſes it, they remonſtrated to their king, that he lacked nothing but patience to be victorious. The Scots thus lying on the defenſive, the earl of Surry again ſent Rouge Croix to inform James that he was ready to give him battle. James was ſenſibly nettled at this tacit imputation upon his honour, and perhaps was inwardly vexed for having followed the wiſe advice of his noblemen. It is certain, from the beſt authorities, that he neglected the neceſſary precautions for guarding the paſſages of the Till, which the Engliſh croſſed, partly at a place where it was fordable, and partly at a bridge. We are told, not without a great appearance of probability, that while the Engliſh were paſſing the bridge, Borthwick, maſter of the Scotch artillery, fell upon his knees, and begged permiſſion from James to point his cannon againſt the bridge; but that James anſwered him in a paſſion, that it muſt be at the peril of his (Borthwick’s) head, and that he was reſolved to ſee all his enemies that day on the plain before him in a body. The earl of Surry, after paſſing the Till, took poſſeſsion of Braxton, which lay to the right of the Scotch camp; and by that ſituation he cut off the communication of his enemies with the Tweed, and commanded the Till below Etoncaſtle. The Scotch generals ſaw themſelves now in danger of being reduced to the ſame ſtraits in which their enemies had been involved two days before, and their country open to an invaſion of the Engliſh army. James had ſecret intelligence that this was far from being the intention of the Engliſh general; and imagining that the latter’s intention was to take poſſeſſion of a ſtrong camp upon a hill between him and the Tweed, which would give the Engliſh a farther command of the country, he reſolved to be be-</p></body></text></TEI>
