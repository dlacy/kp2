<p><span class="font0">defeated the Vandals, and drove them out of Italy. With great labour he fitted out a fleet, of which the&nbsp;Romans had been long deſtitute. With this he deſigned to paſs over into Africa ; but, it being ſurpriſed and&nbsp;burnt by the enemy, he himſelf was ſoon after murdered by one Ricimer a Goth, who had long governed&nbsp;every thing with an abſolute ſway. After the death&nbsp;of Marjorianus, one Anthemius was raiſed to the empire : but beginning to counteract Ricimer, the latter&nbsp;openly revolted, beſieged and took Rome ; where he&nbsp;committed innumerable cruelties, among the reſt putting to death the unhappy emperor Anthemius, and&nbsp;raiſing one Olybius to the empire. The tranſactions&nbsp;of his reign were very few, as he died ſoon after his acceſſion. On his death, one Glycerius uſurped the empire. He was depoſed in 474, and one Julius Nepos&nbsp;had the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emperor.</span><span class="font0"> He was driven out the next&nbsp;year by his general Oreſtes, who cauſed his ſon Auguſtus or Auguſtulus to be proclaimed emperor. But&nbsp;the following year, 476, the barbarians who ſerved in&nbsp;the Roman armies, and were diſtinguiſhed with the&nbsp;title of allies, demanded, as a reward for their ſervices,&nbsp;the third part of the lands in Italy ; pretending, that&nbsp;the whole country, which they had ſo often defended,&nbsp;belonged of right to them. As Oreſtes refuſed to&nbsp;comply with this inſolent demand, they reſolved to do&nbsp;themſelves juſtice, as they called it ; and, openly revolting, choſe one Odoacer for their leader. Odoacer&nbsp;was, according to Ennodius, meanly born, and only a&nbsp;private, man in the guards of the emperor Auguſtulus,&nbsp;when the barbarians revolting, choſe him for their leader. However, he is ſaid to have been a man of uncommon parts, equally capable of commanding an army and&nbsp;governing a ſtate. Having left his own country when&nbsp;he was yet very young, to ſerve in Italy, as he was of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a ſtature remarkably tall, he was admitted among the emperor’s guards, and continued in that ſtation till the&nbsp;preſent year ; when, putting himſelf at the head of the&nbsp;barbarians in the Roman pay, who, though of different&nbsp;nations, had, with one conſent, choſen him for their&nbsp;leader, he marched againſt Oreſtes and his ſon Auguſtulus, who ſtill refuſed to give them any ſhare of the&nbsp;lands in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the Roman troops were inferior, both in number and valour, to the barbarians, Oreſtes took refuge in Pavia, at that time one of the beſt fortified cities in&nbsp;Italy : but Odoacer, inveſting the place without loſs of&nbsp;time, took it ſoon after by aſſault, gave ſt up to be&nbsp;plundered by the ſoldiers, and then ſet fire to it; which&nbsp;reduced moſt of the houſes, and two churches, to aſhes.&nbsp;Oreſtes was taken priſoner, and brought to Odoacer,&nbsp;who carried him to Placentia, and there cauſed him to&nbsp;be put to death, on the 28th of Auguſt, the day on&nbsp;which he had driven Nepos out of Ravenna, and obliged him to abandon the empire. From Placentia,&nbsp;Odoacer marched ſtraight to Ravenha, where he found&nbsp;Paul, the brother of Oreſtes, and the young emperor&nbsp;Auguſtulus. The former he immediately put to death ;&nbsp;but ſparing Auguſtulus, in conſideration of his youth,&nbsp;he ſtripped him of the enſigns of the imperial dignity,&nbsp;and confined him to Lucullanum, a caſtle in Campania ; where he was, by Odoacer’« orders, treated with&nbsp;great humanity, and allowed an handſome maintenance&nbsp;to ſupport himſelf and his relations. Rome readily&nbsp;ſubmitted to the conqueror, who immediately cauſed</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">himſelſ to be proclaimed king of Italy, but would not aſſume the purple, or any other mark of the imperial&nbsp;dignity. Thus failed the very name of an empire in&nbsp;the Weſt. Britain had been long ſince abandoned by&nbsp;the Romans ; Spain was held by the Goths and Sue-vans ; Africa, by the Vandals ; the Burgundians,&nbsp;Goths, Franks, and Alans, had erected ſeveral te-trarchies in Gaul ; at length Italy itſelf, with its proud&nbsp;metropolis, which for ſo many ages had given law to&nbsp;the reſt of the world, was enilaved by a contemptible&nbsp;barbarian, whoſe family, country, and nation, are not&nbsp;well known to this day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this time, Rome has ceaſed to be the capital of an empire ; the territories of the pope, to whom the&nbsp;city is now ſubject, being inconſiderable. The origin&nbsp;of the pope’s temporal power, and the revolutions of&nbsp;Italy,are related under the article Italy; and a fl&lt;etch&nbsp;of the ſpiritual uſurpations of the popes may be ſeen&nbsp;under the articles History, ſect. ii. and Reformation ; and likewiſe under the various hiſtorical articles&nbsp;as they occur in the courſe of this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is thought that the walls of modern Rome take in nearly the ſame extent of ground as the ancient ; but&nbsp;the difference between the number of buildings on this&nbsp;ſpot is very great, one half of modern Rome lying&nbsp;waſte, or occupied with gardens, fields, meadows, and&nbsp;vineyards. One may walk quite round the city in&nbsp;three or ſour hours at moſt, the circumference being&nbsp;reckoned about 13 Italian miles. With regard to the&nbsp;number of the inhabitants, modern Rome is alſo greatly inferior to the ancient : for, in 1709, the whole of&nbsp;theſe amounted only to 138,568 ; among which were&nbsp;40 biſhops, 2686 prieſts, 3559 monks, 1814 nuns, 393&nbsp;courteſans, about 8000 or 9000 Jews, and 14 Moors.&nbsp;In 1714, the number was increaſed to 143,cco. In&nbsp;external ſplendor, and the beauty of its temples and palaces, modern Rome is thought by the moſt judicious&nbsp;travellers to excel the ancient. There was nothing in&nbsp;ancient Rome to be compared with St Peter’s church&nbsp;in the modern. That Rome was able to recover itſelf&nbsp;after ſo many calamities and devaſtations, will not be&nbsp;matter of ſurpriſe, if we conſider the prodigious ſums&nbsp;that it has ſo long annually drawn from all countries of&nbsp;the Popiſh perſuafion. Theſe ſums, though ſtill conſiderable, have been continually decreaſing ſince the Reformation. The ſurface of the ground on which Rome&nbsp;was originally founded is ſurpriſingly altered. At preſent it is difficult to diſtinguiſh the ſeven hills on which&nbsp;it was firſt built, the low grounds being almoſt filled up&nbsp;with the ruins of the ancient ſtreets and houſes, and&nbsp;the great quantities of earth waſhed down from the hills&nbsp;by the violence of the rains. Anciently the ſuburbs&nbsp;extended a vaſt way on all ſides, and made the city appear almoſt boundleſs ; but it is quite otherwiſe now,&nbsp;the country about Rome being almbſt a deſert. To&nbsp;this and other cauſes it is owing, that the air is none&nbsp;of the moſt wholeſome, eſpecially during the ſummer&nbsp;heats, when few go abroad in the day-time. No city&nbsp;at preſent in the world ſurpaſſes, or indeed equals,&nbsp;Rome, ſor the multiplicity of fine fountains, noble&nbsp;edifices, antiquities, curioſities, paintings, ſtatues, and&nbsp;ſculptures. The city ſtands on the Tiber, 10 miles&nbsp;from the Tuſcan ſea, 380 from Vienna, 560 from Paris, 740 from Amſterdam, 810 from London, and&nbsp;900 from Madrid. The Tiber is ſubject to fre-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
