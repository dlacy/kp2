<p><span class="font1">very continuous open case, with no mobility save that of the lower jaw ; or it may consist of bones several of&nbsp;which are so conditioned as to allow much mobility to&nbsp;several other parts. In all cases, however, the side wall&nbsp;of the anterior part of the cranial cavity is very imperfectly&nbsp;ossified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The skull of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font1"> is distinguished from that of all other Reptiles by its very extensive bony palate,&nbsp;which exceeds in completeness that of even any Mammal&nbsp;save the Anteaters and Cetaceans, for not only the&nbsp;maxillae and palatines but also the pterygoids—all as&nbsp;expanded bony plates suturally united—concur in its composition in all existing Crocodilians (though not in the&nbsp;extinct </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Teleosaurus</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Belodon),</span><span class="font1"> and the pterygoids surround the posterior nares. The skull forms a solid whole&nbsp;composed of bones united by suture except at the anterolateral and median boundaries of the cranial cavity, where&nbsp;it is cartilaginous or membranous. There is an interorbital&nbsp;septum. The quadrate bone is immovably fixed and of&nbsp;large size, and unites with the pterygoid, but by its upper&nbsp;and inner surface only. The alisphenoid is a large broad&nbsp;bone. The tympanic cavity is completely enclosed by the&nbsp;prootic and opisthotic (the latter being united with the&nbsp;exoccipital), the squamosal, the postfrontal, and the basioc-cipital and basisphenoid. It opens into the mouth by three&nbsp;apertures, one median and two lateral,@@<sup>1</sup> which terminate&nbsp;complex canals having communications among each other.&nbsp;There are two lateral, quasi-zygomatic arches to the skull&nbsp;—an upper one formed by the postfrontal and squamosal,&nbsp;and a lower one by the maxilla, jugal, quadrato-jugal, and&nbsp;quadrate. There is no foramen in the parietal region of&nbsp;the skull, and there is an azygous parietal bone and frontal.&nbsp;On either side of the hinder region of the skull the periotic&nbsp;and exoccipital bones form large parotic processes. There&nbsp;is a distinct perforated lachrymal. There are two vomers,&nbsp;which are generally hidden in the palate by the junction&nbsp;of the extensive inaxillæ and palatines. There are a pair&nbsp;of nasal bones. Various cranial bones are pneumatic,&nbsp;including the os articulare of the mandible. The hyoid is&nbsp;very simple, and consists only of a broad cartilaginous or&nbsp;partly osseous basihyal, with two bony cornua, not directly&nbsp;connected with the skull. There is a very small cartilaginous stylohyal on the upper hinder part of the quadrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria.—</span><span class="font1">The skull of this living type of an extinct order resembles that of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font1"> in that there is a&nbsp;lower zygomatic arcade formed by the quadrato-jugal bone&nbsp;interposed between the malar and the quadrate, as well&nbsp;as a superior zygomatic arcade formed by the squamosal&nbsp;and postfrontal, and in that the quadrate bone is immovably fixed between the pterygoid, squamosal, and quadrato-jugal. The palate is pretty complete with wide plate-like&nbsp;ossifications, still it is much less so than in the Crocodiles ;&nbsp;but the posterior nares are much more anteriorly situated&nbsp;—very near the anterior end of the palate—and are on each&nbsp;side, being each bounded by the premaxilla in front, the&nbsp;vomer internally, the maxilla externally, and the palatine&nbsp;behind. At the side of the skull we find a bone distinguished as the “columella,” which passes upwards from&nbsp;above the suture between the pterygoid and quadrate to&nbsp;the parietal, to which it is attached by a slip of cartilage.&nbsp;It is a flattened bone, somewhat expanded above and below,&nbsp;and constricted towards its middle. The lateral wall of&nbsp;the skull at the part which in the Crocodile is occupied&nbsp;by the alisphenoid, and in front of that part is not osseous&nbsp;but fibro-cartilaginous. There is an interorbital septum.&nbsp;The postero-lateral region of the skull consists, as in the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Crocodiles, of two outstanding “ parotic processes,” made up of the cxoccipital, prootic, and opisthotic bones,—&nbsp;beneath which is the “columella auris.” The basisphenoid sends down two processes to abut against the&nbsp;pterygoids. The parietal is perforated by a small median</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">fontanelle. The premaxillæ are separate, and together form a sort of beak, their large teeth becoming thoroughly&nbsp;anchylosed and united with the bones supporting them.&nbsp;The nasals are double, and each sends forth a process (somewhat as in Birds) from its outer anterior angle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lacertilian skull is formed mainly upon one of two diverging types of structure—(1) that of ordinary Lizards,&nbsp;and (2) that of Charmeleons. In both the quadrate bone&nbsp;is almost always movable and the inferior zygomatic arcade&nbsp;is wanting, though generally represented by a ligament ;&nbsp;the palate is incompletely ossified, and the rather anteriorly&nbsp;situated posterior nares bounded internally by the bifold&nbsp;vomers. In the ordinary Lizard type the skull has the&nbsp;appearance of consisting of a system of osseous bars connecting the solid occipital parts (with its pair of parotic&nbsp;processes) with a flattened cranial roof and the more or less&nbsp;well ossified snout. The skull has an interorbital septum.&nbsp;The lateral walls of the cranium are, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">fibro-cartilaginous, though they may contain some insignificant ossifications ; and a “ columella,” as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">generally ascends from the pterygoid to the parietal.&nbsp;The last-named bone sends a backward prolongation to&nbsp;the parotic process and squamosal, and is movably united&nbsp;to the occipital ; and thus, through the imperfect ossification of the cranial parietes, the facial part of the skull is&nbsp;capable of more or less flexion upon the occipital part</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
