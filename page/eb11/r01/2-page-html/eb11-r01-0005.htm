According to his biographer (Overbeck, p. 172) he himself produced a version (or revision) of the New Testament in Syriac. This may have been,&nbsp;as Wright suggests (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Syr. Lit</span><span class="font1">. p. 11), “a first step in the direction of the Philoxenian version. ” But there is great probability&nbsp;in F. C. Burkitt’s hypothesis that the product of Rabbūlā's&nbsp;work, at least as regards the Gospels, is to be found in the&nbsp;current Peshītta text, which </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“ </span><span class="font0">represents</span><span class="font1"> the Greek text as&nbsp;read in Antioch about 400 a. d. ” and “ was prepared by Rabbula... and published by his authority as a substitute for&nbsp;the Diatessaron. ” @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rabbūlā seems to have been a man of great force, devotion and self-denial: on the one hand intellectually gifted, and on&nbsp;the other thoroughly consistent in his practice of religion.&nbsp;But his attractiveness is marred, as in the case of many of&nbsp;his contemporaries, by the bitterness of a narrow orthodoxy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RABELAIS, FRANÇOIS </span><span class="font1">(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1">. 1490-1553), French humorist, was born at Chinon on the Vienne in the province of Touraine.&nbsp;The date of his birth is wholly uncertain: it has been put by&nbsp;tradition, and by authorities long subsequent to his death, as&nbsp;1483, 1490, and 1495. There is nothing in the positive facts of&nbsp;his life which would not suit tolerably well with any of these&nbsp;dates; most 17th-century authorities give the earliest, and this&nbsp;also accords best with the age of the eldest of the Du Bellay&nbsp;brothers, with whom Rabelais was (perhaps) at school. In&nbsp;favour of the latest it is urged that, if Rabelais was born in 1483,&nbsp;he must have been forty-seven when he entered at Montpellier,&nbsp;and proportionately and unexpectedly old at other known&nbsp;periods of his life. In favour of the middle date, which has, as&nbsp;far as recent authorities are concerned, the weight of consent in&nbsp;its favour, the testimony of Guy Patin (1601-1672), a witness of&nbsp;some merit and not too far removed in point of time, is invoked.&nbsp;The only contribution which need be made here to the controversy is to point out that if Rabelais was born in 1483 he&nbsp;must have been an old man when he died, and that scarcely&nbsp;even tradition speaks of him as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With regard to his birth, parentage, youth, and education everything depends upon this tradition, and it is not until he&nbsp;was according to one extreme hypothesis thirty-six, according&nbsp;to the other extreme twenty-four, that we have solid testimony&nbsp;respecting him. In the year 1519, on the 5th of April, the&nbsp;François Rabelais of history emerges. The monks of Fontenay&nbsp; le Comte bought some property (half an inn in the town), and&nbsp;among their signatures to the deed of purchase is that of François&nbsp;Rabelais. Before this all is cloudland. It is said that he had&nbsp;four brothers and no sisters, that his father had a country&nbsp;property called La Devinière, and was either an apothecary&nbsp;or a tavern-keeper. Half a century after his death De Thou&nbsp;mentions that the house in which he was born had become a&nbsp;tavern and then a tennis-court. It still stands at the corner of&nbsp;a street called the Rue de la Lamproie, and the tradition may be&nbsp;correct. An indistinct allusion of his own has been taken to&nbsp;mean that he was tonsured in childhood at seven or nine years&nbsp;old; and tradition says that he was sent to the convent of&nbsp;Seuilly. From Seuilly at an unknown date tradition takes him&nbsp;either to the university of Angers or to the convent school of&nbsp;La Baumette or La Basmette, founded by good King Rene in&nbsp;the neighbourhood of the Angevin capital. Here he is supposed&nbsp;to have been at school with the brothers Du Bellay, with Geoffroy&nbsp;d’Estissac and others. The next stage in this (so far as evidence&nbsp;goes, purely imaginary) career is the monastery of Fontenay le&nbsp;Comte, where, as has been seen, he is certainly found in 1519&nbsp;holding a position sufficiently senior to sign deeds for the community, where he, probably in 1511, took priest’s orders, and&nbsp;where he also pursued, again certainly, the study of letters, and&nbsp;especially of Greek, with ardour. From this date, therefore,&nbsp;he becomes historically visible. The next certain intelligence&nbsp;which we have of Rabelais is somewhat more directly biographical. The fetters of the well-known Greek scholar Budaeus,&nbsp;two of which are addressed to Rabelais himself and several more&nbsp;to his friend and fellow-monk Pierre Amy, together with some&nbsp;notices by André Tiraqueau, a learned jurist, to whom Rabelais&nbsp;rather than his own learning has secured immortality, show&nbsp;beyond doubt what manner of life the future author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">led in his convent. The letters of Budaeus show that an&nbsp;attempt was made by the heads of the convent or the order to&nbsp;check the studious ardour of these Franciscans; but it failed,&nbsp;and there is no positive evidence of anything like actual persecution, the phrases in the letters of Budaeus being merely the&nbsp;usual exaggerated Ciceronianism of the Renaissance. Some&nbsp;books and papers were seized as suspicious, then given back as&nbsp;innocent; but Rabelais was in all probability disgusted with the&nbsp;cloister—indeed his great work shows this beyond doubt. In&nbsp;1524, the year of the publication of Tiraqueau’s book above&nbsp;cited, his friend Geoffroy d’Estissac procured from Clement VII.&nbsp;an indult, licensing a change of order and of abode for Rabelais.&nbsp;From a Franciscan he became a Benedictine, and from Fontenay&nbsp;he moved to Maillezais, of which Geoffroy d’Estissac was bishop.&nbsp;But even this learned and hospitable retreat did not apparently&nbsp;satisfy Rabelais. In or before 1530 he left Maillezais, abandoned&nbsp;his Benedictine garb for that of a secular priest, and, as he&nbsp;himself puts it in his subsequent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Supplicatio pro Apostasia</span><span class="font1"> to&nbsp;Pope Paul III., “ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per seculum diu υagatus fuit. ”</span><span class="font1"> For a time the&nbsp;Du Bellays provided him with an abode near their own château&nbsp;of Langey. He is met at Montpellier in the year just mentioned.&nbsp;He entered the faculty of medicine there on the 16th of September&nbsp;and became bachelor on the 1st of November, a remarkably&nbsp;short interval, which shows what was thought of his acquirements. Early in 1531 he lectured publicly on Galen and&nbsp;Hippocrates, while his more serious pursuits seem to have been&nbsp;chequered by acting in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">morale comédie,</span><span class="font1"> then a very frequent&nbsp;university amusement. Visits to the Iles d’Hières, and the&nbsp;composition of a fish sauce in imitation of the ancient </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">garum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which he sent to his friend Étienne Dolet, are associated, not&nbsp;very certainly, with his stay at Montpellier, which, lasting&nbsp;rather more than a year at first, was renewed at intervals for&nbsp;several years.</span></p><div>
<p></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">In 1532, however, he had moved from Montpellier to Lyons. Here he plunged into manifold work, literary and professional.&nbsp;He was appointed before the beginning of November physician&nbsp;to the Hotel Dieu, with a salary of forty livres per annum,&nbsp;and lectured on anatomy with demonstrations from the human&nbsp;subject. He edited for Sebastian Gryphius, in the single&nbsp;year 1532, the medical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epistles</span><span class="font1"> of Giovanni Manardi, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aphorisms</span><span class="font1"> of Hippocrates, with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ars</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parυa</span><span class="font1"> of Galen, and&nbsp;an edition of two supposed Latin documents, which, however,&nbsp;happened unluckily to be forgeries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At this time Lyons was the centre and to a great extent the headquarters of an unusually enlightened society, and&nbsp;indirectly it is clear that Rabelais became intimate with this&nbsp;society. A manuscript distich, which was found in the Toulouse&nbsp;library, deals with the death of an infant named Théodule,&nbsp;whose country was Lyons and his father Rabelais, but we&nbsp;know nothing more about the matter. What makes the&nbsp;Lyons sojourn of the greatest real importance is that at this&nbsp;time probably appeared the beginnings of the work which was&nbsp;to make Rabelais immortal. It is necessary to say “ probably, ”&nbsp;because the strange uncertainty which rests on so much of his&nbsp;life and writings exists here also. There is no doubt that both&nbsp;Gargantua and Pantagruel were popular names of giants in&nbsp;the Middle Ages, though, curiously enough, no mention of the&nbsp;former in French literature much before Rabelais’s time has&nbsp;been traced. In 1526, however, Charles de Bordigné, in a&nbsp;satiric work of no great merit, entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">la Légende de Pierre&nbsp;Paifeu<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> has the name Gargantua with an allusion, and in 1532&nbsp;(if not earlier) there appeared at Lyons </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">les Grandes et inestimables&nbsp;chroniques du grand et énorme géant Gargantua.</span><span class="font1"> This is a short&nbsp;book on the plan of the later burlesques and romances of the&nbsp;Round Table. Arthur and Merlin appear with Grantgosier,&nbsp;as he is here spelt, Galemelle (Gargamelle), Gargantua himself,</span></p>
