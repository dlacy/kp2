a part of Negroland in Africa, the boundaries of which are not known. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Guinea.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Isle of S</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> enegal,</hi> ſometimes called <hi rend="italic">Saint Louis,</hi> is a small iſland in the mouth of the river Senegal, and according to Maſkelyne’s tables is ſituated in N. Lat 15. 53. W. Long. 16. 31. The Dutch were the firſt Europeans who fettled at Senegal ; but their colony was expelled by the French in 1687. It was taken by the Engliſh in 1692 ; and retaken by the French the year following. It was a second time taken poſſeſſion of by the Engliſh in 1758; but in 1779 the French recovered it, and it was ceded by the Britiſh crown by the treaty of 1783.</p><p>The best account of this iſland which we have ſeen, is given in the interesting voyage of M. Saugnier to the coaſt of Africa. This adventurer viſited Senegal in June 1785.</p><p>“The iſland (says he), properly ſpeaking, is only a bank of sand in the middle of the river. It is 1000 geometrical paces long, and about 60 in its greateſt width ; is almoſt on a level with the river and with the ſea, being defended from the latter by Barbary point, which is of greater elevation than the colony. The eaſtern branch of the river is the more conſiderable of the two, being about 400 toiſes acroſs ; the weſtern branch is only from 50 to 200 toiſes wide. The iſle conſiſts entirely of burning ſands, on the barren ſurface of which you ſometimes meet with ſcactered flints, thrown out among their ballaſt by veſſels coming from Goree, or with the ruins of buildings formerly erected by Europeans. There is ſcarcely ſuch a thing as a garden upon the iſland ; European ſeeds in general not thriving here. It is not ſurpriſing that the soil is ſo unproductive ; for the air is ſtrongly impregnated with ſea salt, which pervades every thing, and conſumes even iron in a very ſhort ſpace of time. The heats are exceſſive, and rendered ſtill more inſupportable by the reflection of the fand ; ſo that from ten in the morning until four in the afternoon it is almoſt impoſſible to do any work. During the months of January, February, March, and April, the heats are moderated ; but in Auguſt and the following months they become ſo oppreſſive as even to affect the natives themſelves. What effect then muſt they have upon the Europeans, ſuddenly tranſported into this burning climate ? The nights are a little leſs ſultry ; not always, however, but only when the ſea-breeze ſets in. It is then that the inhabitants of the colony breathe a freſher air, for which they have been longing the whole of the day ; but this air in our climate would ſeem aburning vapour. The nights are nevertheleſs troublesome, notwithſtanding the comforts of the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0272.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0266"/>
ſea-breeze. The inſtant the ſun is ſet, we are aſſailed by an infinity of gnats, which are called <hi rend="italic">muſquitos;</hi> their ſtings are very painful, and their multitudes incredible. The inhabitants find but a poor defence in their gauze- curtains. For my own part, accuſtomed as I had been to live among the Moors, I was but little annoyed by theſe infects. Being half a ſavage, I felt no desire to recommend myſelf to the favourable regard of the fair sex, and I was therefore under no neceſſity of taking care of my perſon. In imitation of my former matters,</p><p>I ſmeared myſelf with butter, and this expedient preſeived me at all times from theſe impertinent flingers, theſe ſpiteful enemies to the repoſe of the human kind.</p><p>“ If the prospect of Senegal is not agreeable to the eye, much lets are its environs, which are covered over only with sand, and over-run with mangles. It may be ſaid, without exaggeration, that there is not a more forlorn ſituation to be found on the face of the inhabited globe, or a place in which the common neceſſaries of life are procured with greater difficulties. Water, that indiſpensable aliment of man, is here not potable. Wells are dug in the land to the depth of five or fix feet, and water is obtained by theſe means ; but whatever pains are taken to freſhen it, it ever retains a brackiſh taſte.</p><p>I have diſtilled this water myſelf, and obſerved that it always had a diſagreeable favour, which cannot fail to be hurtful to the health : it is true, that when the river is high, its ſtreams are freſh, but the water is only the more dangerous. It proves the cauſe of moſt of thoſe maladies which carry off the Europeans ſo rapidly, that at the end of every three years the colony has a ſreſh ſet of inhabitants. The blacks themselves, although accuſtomed to the climate, are not in this ſeaſon free from diſeaſe.”</p><p>The fort of St Louis is a quadrangle, and has two baſtions of conſiderable ſtrength ; but the greateſt ſecurity of the fort is its natural ſituation. The cannon of the fort are numerous, and the arſenal well supplied with small arms and ſtores. Belides this fort the French had no other upon the river, except Fort St Joſeph, which stands about four leagues below the cataract at Govina, though they had a few factories in different parts.</p><p>The principal commodity of this country is that of gum Senagal (ſee <hi rend="italic">GUM-Senegal),</hi> which is a valuable branch of commerce, as it is uſed in many arts and manufactures, particularly by the painters in water-colours, the ſilk weavers, and dyers.</p><p>The French import from the river Senegal not only gum-arabic, but elephants teeth, hides, bees-wax, gold- duſt, cotton, oſtrich feathers, ambergris, indigo, and civet.</p><p>Notwithſtanding the barrenneſs of the ſpot, Senegal contains more than 6000 negroes, including the captives of the Tapades, or negroes born of the black inhabitants of the country. They are never put up to ſale, unleſs convicted of ſome crime. Their huts, conſtructed in the form of bee-hives, and ſupported upon four ſtakes, ſurround the habitations of the negro inhabitants. The entire height of thoſe huts may riſe to about 12 feet, the width in every direction is commonly from 10 to 12. The beds are compoſed of hurdles laid upon croſs-bars, ſupported by forked ſtakes at the height of about a foot irom the ground. Here the slaves</p><p>sleep promiscuouſly, men, women, girls, and boys. A fire is made in the middle of the hut, which is filled with ſmoke, ſnſſicient to stifle any man but a negro.</p><p>The men are tall, and the women are accounted the bandſomeſt negreffes of all Africa. The Senegalians may be conſidered as the moſt courageous people of that part of the world, without even excepting the Moors. Their courage, however, is more nearly allied to temerity than to bravery. In the courſe of the voyage to Galam, they meet the greateſt dangers with gaiety and ſong ; they dread neither muſket nor cannon, and are equally fearleſs of the cayman or crocodile should one of their companions be killed, and devoured by theſe animals before their face, they are not deterred from plunging into the water, if the working of the ſhip require it. Theſe excellent qualifications which diſtinguish them, and on which they value themſelves ſo much, do not, however, preſerve them from the common contagion of the country, which inclines them all to rapine. They are emulous to ſurpaſs one another in all the arts of over-reaching and fraud. The conduct of the Europeans has, no doubt, encouraged theſe vices as much as the lelſons of the marabous, who inculcate the duty of plundering the Chriſtians to the utmoſt of their power.</p><p>The Yolof negroes of Senegal are either Chriſtians or Mahometans, or rather one and the other, or with more truth neither ; religion being a matter of indifference to them. Thoſe on the continent are of the same way of thinking, and their religious practices are kept up only for the sake of form. A bar of iron, a few beads, will make them change their opinion at will. By ſuch means are they acted upon ; a ſufficient proof of their want of all religious principle. The marabous, or prieſts, and the men of their law, are no better than the rest. “ I have examined the character of ſeveral of this order of men (ſays M. Saugmer), and even among the nation of the Poules, who are conſidered as great fanatics, I diſcovered that they were only publicly attached to their opinions. ‘ This white man (say they) does so ; he is better informed than I, and why ſhould not I imitate his example ?” This way of reaſoning is common to all that tract of country.</p><p>The colony of Senegal is ſurrounded with islands, which, on account of the proximity of the ſea, are all- more unhealthy than that on which the town is built. They are full of Handing pools, that, when dried up by the ſun, exhale a putrid vapour that carries mortality with it, and deſolates theſe islands. It is doubtless the ſame cauſe that takes off ſo many of the French at Senegal during the dangerous ſeaſon of the year. This alſo may be in part occaſtoned by the bad quality of the water, which flows from the ponds in the neighbourhood of the colony, and though incorporated with that of the river, comes down little agitated by the current, and is eaſily diſtinguiſhed by a vapidneſs of taſte. This particular is, in my opinion, essentially worthy of notice, and if properly attended to by our medical men, might become the means of preſerving many lives.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> SenEgA</hi> <hi rend="italic">L-River,</hi> ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Niger.</hi> As so little is known reſpecting this river, which is one of the greateſt in Africa, any additional information muſt be intereſting.

tion for promoting the diſcovery of the Interior Parts of Africa, which, as far as we know, is the lateſt and most authentic.</p><p>The river known to Europeans by the name of <hi rend="italic">Niger</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Senegal</hi> runs on the ſouth of the kingdom of Casina, in its courſe towards Tombuctou ; and if the report which Ben Alli heard in that town may be credited, it is afterwards loſt in the ſands on the ſouth of the country of Tombuctou. In the map<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> The map alluded to is that which accompanies the volume which contains the proceedings of the Associations. This work was printed in 1791 .</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a),</hi> only the known part of its courſe is marked by a line ; and the ſuppoſitious part by dots. It may be proper to observe, that the Africans have two names for this river; that is, <hi rend="italic">Neel il Abeed,</hi> or river of the Negroes ; and <hi rend="italic">Neel il Kibeer,</hi> or the great river. They also term the Nile (that is the Egyptian river) <hi rend="italic">Neel Shem</hi>; ſo that the term <hi rend="italic">Neel,</hi> from whence our Nile, is nothing more than the appellative of river ; like Ganges, or Sinde.</p><p>Of this river the rise and termination are unknown, but the courſe is from eaſt to west. So great is its rapidity, that no veſſel can aſcend its ſtream ; and ſuch is the want of skill, or ſuch the abſence of commercial inducements among the nations who inhabit its borders, that even with the current, neither veſſels nor boats are ſeen to navigate. In one place, indeed, the traveller finds accommodations for the paſſage of himſelf and of his goods ; but even there, tho’ the ferrymen, by the indulgence of the sultan of Caſhna, are exempted from all taxes, the boat which conveys the merchandiſe is nothing more than an ill-conſtructed raft ; for the planks are faſtened to the timbers with ropes, and the ſeams are doled both within and without by a plaſter of tough day, of which a large provision is always carried on the raft, for the purpoſe of excluding the ſtream wherever its entrance is obſerved.</p><p>The depth of the river at the place of paſſage, which is more than a hundred miles to the ſouth of the city of Caſhna, the capital of the empire of that name, is eſtimated at 23 or 24 feet Engliſh. Its depth is from 10 to 12 peeks, each of which is 27 inches.</p><p>Its width is ſuch, that even at the iſland of Gongoo, where the ferrymen reſide, the sound of the loudeſt voice from the northern ſhore is ſcarcely heard ; and at Tombuctou, where the name of <hi rend="italic">Gnewa,</hi> or black, is given to the ſtream, the width is deſcribed as being that of the Thames at Weſtminſter. In the rainy season it ſwells above its banks, and not only floods the adjacent lands, but often ſweeps before it the cattle and cottages of the ſhort-ſighted or too confident inhabitants.</p><p>That the people who live in the neighbourhood of the Niger ſhould refuſe to profit by its navigation, may juſtly furpriſe the traveller: but much greater is his aſtoniſh.ment, when he finds that even the food which the bounty of the ſtream would give, is uſeleſsly offered to their acceptance ; for ſuch is the want of ſkill, or ſuch the settled diſlike of the people to this sort of proviſion, that the fiſh with which the river abounds are left in undiſturbed poſſeſſion of its waters.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
