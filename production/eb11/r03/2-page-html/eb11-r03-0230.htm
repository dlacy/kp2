<p><span class="font0">ROMANCE, originally a composition written in “ Romance” language: that is to say, in one of the phases on which the&nbsp;Latin tongue entered after or during the dark ages. For some&nbsp;centuries by far the larger number of these compositions were&nbsp;narrative fictions in prose or verse; and since the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">special&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">“ Romance ” language of France—the earliest so-called—was&nbsp;the original vehicle of nearly all such fictions, the use of the&nbsp;term for them became more and more accepted in a limited&nbsp;sense. Yet for a long time there was no definite connotation&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fiction</span><span class="font0"> attached to it, but only of narrative story: and the&nbsp;French version of William of Tyre’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Crusades,</span><span class="font0"> a&nbsp;very serious chronicle written towards the close of the 12th&nbsp;century, bears the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roman d'Erade</span><span class="font0"> simply because the&nbsp;name of the emperor Heraclius occurs in the first line. But&nbsp;if the explanation of the name “ Romance ” is quite simple,&nbsp;certain and authentic, the same is by no means the case with&nbsp;its definition, or even with the origin of the thing to which&nbsp;that name came mostly to be applied. For some centuries&nbsp;an abstraction has been formed from the concrete examples.&nbsp;“ Romance,” “ romanticism,” “ the romantic character,”&nbsp;“ the romantic spirits,” have been used to express sometimes&nbsp;a quality regarded in itself, but much more frequently a difference from the supposed “ classical ” character and spirit. The&nbsp;following article will deal chiefly with the matter of Romance,&nbsp;excluding or merely referring to accounts of such individual&nbsp;romances as are noticed elsewhere. But it will not be possible&nbsp;to conclude without some reference to the vaguer and more contentious signification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Speculations on the origin of the peculiar kind of story which we recognize rather than define under the name&nbsp;of romance have been numerous and sometimes confident;&nbsp;but a wary and well-informed criticism will be slow to accept&nbsp;most of them. It is certain that many of its characteristics&nbsp;are present in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey</span><span class="font0"> ; and it is a most remarkable fact&nbsp;that these characteristics are singled out for reprehension—or&nbsp;at least for comparative disapproval—by the author of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treatise on the Sublime,</span><span class="font0"> The absence of central plot, and the&nbsp;prolongation rather than evolution of the story;&nbsp;the intermixture of the supernatural; the presence&nbsp;and indeed prominence of love-affairs; the juxtaposition of tragic and almost farcical’incident; the variety&nbsp;of adventure arranged rather in the fashion of a panorama&nbsp;than otherwise: all these things are in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;they are all, in varying degrees and measures, characteristic&nbsp;of romance. Nor are they absent from the few specimens of&nbsp;ancient prose fiction which we possess. If the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Satyricon</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;ever more than a mass of fragments, it was certainly a romance,&nbsp;though one much mixed with satire, criticism and other things;&nbsp;and the various Greek survivals from Longus to Eustathius&nbsp;always and rightly receive the name. But two things were&nbsp;still wanting which were to be all-powerful in the romances&nbsp;proper—Chivalry and Religion. They could not yet be included, for chivalry did not exist; and such religion as did&nbsp;exist lent itself but ill to the purpose except by providing myths&nbsp;for ornament and perhaps pattern.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A possible origin of the new romance into which these elements entered (though it was some time before that of chivalry definitely emerged) has been seen by one of the least hazardous&nbsp;of the speculations above referred to in the hagiology or “ Saint’s&nbsp;Life,” which arose at an early though uncertain perjod, developed&nbsp;itself pretty rapidly, and spreading over all Christendom (which&nbsp;by degrees meant all Europe and parts of Asia) provided&nbsp;centuries with their chief supply of what may be&nbsp;called interesting literature. If the author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">On&nbsp;the Sublime</span><span class="font0"> was actually Longinus, the minister of&nbsp;Zenobia, there is no doubt that examples both sacred and profane&nbsp;ofthekindof “fiction ” (“imitation” or “representation”) which&nbsp;he deprecated were mustering and multiplying close to, perhaps&nbsp;in, his own time. The Alexander legend of the pscudo-Callis-thenes is supposed to have seen the light in Egypt as early as&nbsp;a.d. 200, and the first Greek version of that “ Vision of Saint&nbsp;Paul,” which is the ancestor of all the large family of legends&nbsp;of the life after death, is pretty certainly as old as the 4th century&nbsp;and may be as old as the 3rd. The development of the Alexan-dreid was to some extent checked or confined to narrow channels&nbsp;as long as something like traditional and continuous study of&nbsp;the classics was kept up. But hagiology was entirely free from&nbsp;criticism; its subjects were immensely numerous; and in the&nbsp;very nature of the case it allowed the tendencies and the folklore of three continents and of most of their countries to mingle&nbsp;with it. Especially the comparative sobriety of classical&nbsp;literature became affected with the Eastern appetite for marvel&nbsp;and unhesitating acceptation of it; and the extraordinary&nbsp;beauty of many of the central stories invited and necessitated&nbsp;embroidery, continuation, episode. Later, no doubt, the&nbsp;adult romance directly reacted on the original saint’s life, as&nbsp;in the legends of St Mary Magdalene most of all, of St Eustace,&nbsp;and of many others. But there can be very little doubt that&nbsp;if the romance itself did not spring from the saint’s life it was&nbsp;fostered thereby.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Proceeding a little further in the cautious quest—not for the definite origins which are usually delusive, but for the&nbsp;tendencies which avail themselves of opportunities and the&nbsp;opportunities which lend themselves to tendencies—we may&nbsp;notice two things very important to the subject. The one is&nbsp;that as Graeco-Roman civilization began to spread North and&nbsp;East it met, to appearance which approaches certainty, matter&nbsp;wdiich lent itself gladly to “ romantic ” treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That such matter was abundant in the literature and folk-lore of the East we know: that it was even&nbsp;more abundant in the literatures and folk-lore of the North,&nbsp;if we cannot strictly be said to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">know,</span><span class="font0"> we may be reasonably sure. On the other hand, as the various barbarian nations&nbsp;(using the word in the wide Greek sense), at least those of&nbsp;the North, became educated to Hterature, to “ grammar,” by&nbsp;classical examples, they found not a few passages in these&nbsp;examples which were either almost romances already or which&nbsp;lent themselves, with readiness that was almost insistence,&nbsp;to romantic treatment. Apollonius Rhodius had made almost&nbsp;a complete romance of the story of Jason and Medea. Virgil&nbsp;had imitated him by making almost a complete romance of the&nbsp;story of Aeneas and Dido: and Ovid, who for that very reason&nbsp;was to become the most popular author*of the middle ages&nbsp;early and late, had gone some way towards romancing a&nbsp;great body of mythology. We do not know exactly who first&nbsp;applied to the legendary tale of Troy the methods which the</span></p>
