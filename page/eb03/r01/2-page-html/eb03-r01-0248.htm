<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">want of </span><span class="font1">proviſions. As thefe ſhips were commanded by their braveſt ſea-officers, they ſoon returned with an&nbsp;'immenſe booty, and a great many priſoners. Among&nbsp;■other veffels, they took a galley richly laden, on board&nbsp;of which they ſound a great variety of valuable ſurni-ture, and a royal robe, which Phila herſelf had wrought&nbsp;and ſent as a preſent to her huſhand Demetrius, accompanied with a letter written with her own hand.&nbsp;The Rhodians ſent the furniture, the royal robe, and&nbsp;even the letter, to Ptolemy ; which exaſperated Deme-trius to a great degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">while Demetrius was preparing to attack the city, the Rhodians having affembled the people and magiſtrates to conſult about the meaſures they ſhould take,&nbsp;ſome propoſed in the affembly tbe pulling down of tlie&nbsp;ſtatues of Antigonus and his ſon Demetrius, wliich&nbsp;till then had been held in the utmoſt veneration. But&nbsp;this propoſal was generally rejected with indignation,&nbsp;and their prudent conduct greatly allayed the wrath&nbsp;both </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">Antigonus and Demetrius. However, the&nbsp;latter continued to carry on the ſiege with the utmoſt&nbsp;vigour, thinking it would reflect no ſmall diſhonour&nbsp;on him were he obliged, to quit the place without&nbsp;making himſelf maſter of it. He cauſed the walls to&nbsp;be ſecretly undermined : but, when they were ready&nbsp;to ſall, a deſcrter very opportunely gave notice of the&nbsp;whole to the townſmen ; who haviag, with all expedition, drawn a deep trench all along the wall, began to&nbsp;countermine, and, meeting the enemy under ground,&nbsp;obliged them to abandon the work, while both parties guarded the mines, one Athenagoras a Mileſian,&nbsp;who had been ſent to the affiſtance of the Rhodians by&nbsp;Ptolemy with a body of mercenaries, promiſed to betray the city to the Demetrians, and let them in thro’&nbsp;the mines in the night-time. But- this was only in&nbsp;order to enſnare them ; for Alexander, a noble Ma-cedonian, whom Demetrius had ſent with a choice&nbsp;body of troops to take poffeffion of a poſt agreed on,&nbsp;no ſooner appeared, but he was taken priſoner by the&nbsp;Rhodians, who were waiting for him under arms. —&nbsp;Athenagoras was crowned by the ſenate with a crown&nbsp;of gold, and preſented with ſive talents of ſilver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Demetrius now gave over all thoughts of undermining the walls, and placed all his hopes of reducing the city in the battering-engines which he had contrived. Having therefore levelled the ground under&nbsp;the walls, he brought up his helepolis, with four teſtudoes on each ſide of it. Two other teſtudoes of an&nbsp;extraordinary ſize, bearing battering-rams, were like-wife moved forwards by 1000 men. Each ſtory of&nbsp;the helepolis was ſilled with all ſorts of engines for&nbsp;diſcharging of ſtones, arrows, and darts, when all&nbsp;things were ready, Demetrius ordered the ſignal to&nbsp;be given ; when his men, ſetting up a ſhout, affaulted&nbsp;the city on all ſides both by ſea and land. But, in&nbsp;the heat of the attack, when the walls were ready to&nbsp;fall by the repeated ſtrokes of the battering-rams, am&nbsp;baſſadors arrived from Cnidus, earneſtly ſolicſting Demetrius to fuſpend all further hoſtilities, and at the&nbsp;fame time giving him hopes that they ſhould prevail&nbsp;upon the Rhodians to ſubmit to an honourable capitulation. A fuſpenfipn of arms was accordingly agreed&nbsp;on, and ambaſſadors fent from both ſſdes. But the&nbsp;Rhodians refaſmg to capitulate on the conditions Of</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">fered them, the attack was renewed with ſo much </span><span class="font1">fury,&nbsp;and the machines played off in ſo briſk </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">manner,&nbsp;that a large tower built with ſquare ſtones, and the&nbsp;wall that flanked it, were battered down. The beſie-ged, nevertheleſs, fought in the breach with fo much&nbsp;courage and reſolution, that the enemy, after various&nbsp;unſucceſsſul attempts, were forced to abandon the en-tepriſe, and retire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this conjuncture, a fleet which Ptolemy had freighted with 300,000 meaſures of corn, and different kinds of pulſe for thc ufe of the Rhodians, ar-rived very ſeaſonably in the port, nothwithſtandiug the&nbsp;vigilance of the enemy’s ſhips, which cruized on the&nbsp;coaſts of the iſſand to ſurpriſe them. A few days&nbsp;after came in fafe two other fleets, one ſent by Caf-ſander, with 100,000 buſhels of barley; the other&nbsp;by Lyſimachus, with 400,000 buſhcts of corn and as&nbsp;many oſ barley. This ſeaſonable and plentiful ſupply&nbsp;arriving when the city began to ſuffer for want of&nbsp;proviſions, inſpired the beſieged with new courage,&nbsp;and raiſed their drooping ſpirits. Being thus animated,&nbsp;they formed a deſign of ſetting the enemy’s engines on&nbsp;ſire ; and with this view ordered a body of men to ſally&nbsp;out the night enſuing, about the ſecond watch, with&nbsp;torches and ſirebrands, having ſirſt placed on the walls&nbsp;an incredible number of engines, to diſcharge ſtones,&nbsp;arrows, darts, and fire-balls, againſt thoſe who ſhould&nbsp;attempt to oppoſe their detachment. The Rhodian&nbsp;troops, purſuant to their orders, all on a ſudden fallied&nbsp;out, and advancing, in ſpite of all oppoſition, to the batteries, ſet them on ſire, while the engines from the walla&nbsp;played inceffantly on thoſe who endeavoured to extinguiſh the flames. The Demetrians on this occaſion fell&nbsp;in great numbers, being incapable, in the darknefs of&nbsp;the -night, either to ſee the engines that continually difeharged ſhowers of ſtones and arrows upon them, or to&nbsp;join in one body and repulſe the enemy. The conflagration was ſo great, that ſeveral plates of iron falling&nbsp;from the helepolis, that vaſt engine would have been&nbsp;entirely conſumed, had not the troops that were ſtationed in it with all poffible fpeed quenched the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">fire&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">with water, before prepared, and ready in the apart-ments of the engine againſt ſueh accidents. Deme-trius, fearing leſt all his machines ſhould be conſumed,&nbsp;called together, by ſound of trumpet, thoſe whoſe province it was to move them ; and, by their help, brought&nbsp;them off before they were entirely deſtroyed. When it&nbsp;was day, he commanded all the darts and arrows that&nbsp;had been ſhot by the Rhodians to be carefully gathered, that he might from their number form ſome judgement of the number of machines in the city. Above&nbsp;800 firebrands were found on the fpot, and no fewer&nbsp;than 1500 darts, all diſcharged in a very ſmall portion&nbsp;of the night. This ſtruck the prince himſelf with no&nbsp;ſmall terror ; for he never imagined that they would&nbsp;have been able to bear the charges of ſuch formidable&nbsp;preparations. However, after having cauſed the ſſain&nbsp;to be buried, and given directions for the curing of&nbsp;the wounded, he applied himſelf to the repairing of&nbsp;his machines, which had bccn diſmounted and rendered&nbsp;■quite unſerviceable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, the 'beſieged, improving the reſpite allowed them by the removal of the machines, built a&nbsp;third wall in the form of a crefcent, which took in all&nbsp;that part that was moſt expoſed to the enemy s batteries ; and, beſides, drew a deep trench behind the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
