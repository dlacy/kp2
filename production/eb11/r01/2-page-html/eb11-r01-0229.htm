<p><span class="font0">was absolutely forbidden, as well as the application to the bishop of Rome for dispensations. The bishops were&nbsp;thereafter to be elected by the deans and chapters upon&nbsp;receiving the king’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">congé d’eslire (q.v.).</span><span class="font0"> The Act of Succession&nbsp;provided that, should the king have no sons, Elizabeth,&nbsp;Anne’s daughter, should succeed to the crown. The brief Act&nbsp;of Supremacy confirmed the king’s claim to be reputed the&nbsp;“ only supreme head in earth of the Church of England ”;&nbsp;he was to enjoy all the honours, dignities, jurisdictions&nbsp;and profits thereunto appertaining, and to have full power&nbsp;and authority to reform and amend all such errors, heresies&nbsp;and abuses, as by any manner of spiritual authority might&nbsp;lawfully be reformed, or amended, most to the pleasure of&nbsp;Almighty God, and the increase of virtue in Christ’s religion,&nbsp;“ foreign authority, prescription, or any other thing or things&nbsp;to the contrary hereof, notwithstanding.” The Treasons Act,&nbsp;terrible in its operation, included among capital offences that&nbsp;of declaring in words or writing the king to be “ a heretic,&nbsp;schismatic, tyrant, infidel or usurper.” The convocations were&nbsp;required to abjure the papal supremacy by declaring “ that&nbsp;the bishop of Rome has not in Scripture any greater&nbsp;jurisdiction in the kingdom of England than any other&nbsp;foreign bishop.” The king had now clarified the ancient&nbsp;laws of the realm to his satisfaction, and could proceed to&nbsp;abolish superstitious rites, remedy abuses, and seize such portions&nbsp; of the Church’s possessions, especially pious and monastic&nbsp;foundations, as he deemed superfluous for the maintenance of&nbsp;religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In spite of the fact that the separation from Rome had been carried out during the sessions of a single parliament, and&nbsp;that there had been no opportunity for a general&nbsp;expression of opinion on the part of the nation, there&nbsp;is no reason to suppose that the majority of the&nbsp;people, thoughtful or thoughtless, were not ready to&nbsp;reconcile themselves to the abolition of the papal&nbsp;supremacy. It seems just as dear that there was&nbsp;no strong evangelical movement, and that Henry’s&nbsp;pretty consistent adherence to the fundamental doctrines&nbsp;of the medieval Church was agree abIe to the great mass of&nbsp;his subjects. The ten “ Articles devised by the Kyng’s Highnes&nbsp;Majestie to stablysh Christen quietness ” (1536), together&nbsp;with the “ Injunctions ’’ of 1536 and 1538, are chiefly&nbsp;noteworthy for their affirmation of almost all the current&nbsp;doctrines of the Catholic Church, except those relating to the&nbsp;papal supremacy, purgatory, images, relics and pilgrimages,&nbsp;and the old rooted distrust of the Bible in the vernacular.&nbsp;The clergy were bidden to exhort their hearers to the&nbsp;“ works of charity, mercy and faith, specially prescribed and&nbsp;commanded in Scripture, and not to repose their trust or&nbsp;affiance in any other works devised by men’s phantasies beside&nbsp;Scripture; as in wandering to pilgrimages, offering of money,&nbsp;candles or tapers to images or relics, or kissing or licking the&nbsp;same, saying over a number of beads, not understood or minded&nbsp;on, or in suchlike superstition.” To this end a copy of the&nbsp;whole English Bible was to be set up in each parish church&nbsp;where the people could read it. During the same years the&nbsp;monasteries, lesser and greater, were dissolved, and the chief&nbsp;shrines were despoiled, notably that of St Thomas of Canterbury. Thus one of the most important of all medieval ecclesiastical&nbsp; institutions, monasticism, came to an end in England.&nbsp;Doubtless the king’s sore financial needs had much to do with&nbsp;the dissolution of the abbeys and the plundering of the shrines,&nbsp;but there is no reason to suppose that he was not fully convinced that the monks had long outlived their usefulness and&nbsp;that the shrines were centres of abject superstition and ecclesiastical deceit. Henry, however, stoutly refused to go further&nbsp;in the direction of German Protestantism, even with the&nbsp;prospect of forwarding the proposed union between him and&nbsp;the princes of the Schmalkaldic League. An insurrection of&nbsp;the Yorkshire peasants, which is to be ascribed in part to the&nbsp;distress caused by the enclosure of the commons on which&nbsp;they had been wont to pasture their cattle, and in part to the&nbsp;destruction of popular shrines, may have caused the king to&nbsp;defend his orthodoxy by introducing into parliament in 1539 the&nbsp;six questions. These parliament enacted into the terrible statute&nbsp;of “ The Six Articles,” in which a felon’s death was prescribed&nbsp;for those who obstinately denied transubstantiation, demanded&nbsp;the communion under both kinds, questioned the binding&nbsp;character of vows of chastity, or the lawfulness of private&nbsp;Masses or the expediency of auricular confession. On the&nbsp;30th of July 1540 three Lutheran clergymen were burned&nbsp;and three Roman Catholics beheaded, the latter for denying&nbsp;the king’s spiritual supremacy. The king’s ardent desire that&nbsp;diversities of minds and opinions should be done away with&nbsp;and unity be “ charitably established ’’ was further promoted&nbsp;by publishing in 1543 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Necessary Doctrine and Erudition&nbsp;for any Christian Man, set forth by the King’s Majesty of England,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in which the tenets of medieval theology, except for denial&nbsp;of the supremacy of the bishop of Rome and the unmistakable&nbsp;assertion of the supremacy of the king, were once more&nbsp;restated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Henry VIII. died in January 1547, having chosen a council of regency for his nine-year-old son Edward, the members&nbsp;of which were favourable to further religious innovations. Somerset, the new Protector, strove to govern&nbsp;on the basis of civil liberty and religious tolerance. The first parliament of the reign swept away almost&nbsp;all the species of treasons created during the previous&nbsp;two centuries, the heresy acts, including the Six&nbsp;Articles, all limitations on printing the Scriptures in&nbsp;English and reading and expounding the same—indeed “ all&nbsp;and every act or acts of parliament concerning doctrine&nbsp;or matters of religion.” These measures gave a great impetus&nbsp;to religious discussion and local innovations. Representatives&nbsp;of all the new creeds hastened from the Continent to&nbsp;England, where they hoped to find a safe and fertile field&nbsp;for the particular seed they had to plant. It is impossible&nbsp;exactly to estimate the influence which these teachers&nbsp;exerted on the general trend of religious opinion in England;&nbsp;in any case, however, it was not unimportant, and the&nbsp;Articles of Religion and official homilies of the Church of&nbsp;England show unmistakably the influence of Calvin’s doctrine.&nbsp;There was, however, no such sudden breach with the traditions&nbsp;of the past as characterized the Reformation in some continental countries. Under Edward VI. the changes were&nbsp;continued on the lines laid down by Henry VIII. The old&nbsp;hierarchy continued, but service books in English were substituted for those in Latin, and preaching was encouraged.&nbsp;A royal visitation, beginning in 1547, discovered, however, such&nbsp;a degree of ignorance and illiteracy among the parish clergy&nbsp;that it became clear that preaching could only be gradually&nbsp;given its due place in the services of the Church. Communion&nbsp;under both kinds and the marriage of the clergy were&nbsp;sanctioned, thus gravely modifying two of the fundamental&nbsp;institutions of the medieval Church. A conservative </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Book&nbsp;of Common Prayer and Administration of the Sacraments and&nbsp;other Rites and Ceremonies after the Use of the Church of England&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">—commonly called the First Prayer Book of Edward VI.—&nbsp;was issued in 1549. This was based upon ancient “ uses,’’&nbsp;and represented no revolutionary change in the traditions of&nbsp;the “ old religion.” It was followed, however, in 1552 by the&nbsp;second Prayer Book, which was destined to be, with some&nbsp;modifications, the permanent basis of the English service.&nbsp;This made it clear that the communion was no longer to&nbsp;be regarded as a propitiatory sacrifice, the names “ Holy&nbsp;Communion ” and “ Lord’s Supper ” being definitively substituted for “ Mass ” (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font0">), while the word “ altar ” was&nbsp;replaced by “ table.’’ In the Forty-two Articles we have&nbsp;the basis of Queen Elizabeth’s Thirty-nine Articles. Thus&nbsp;during the reign of Edward we have not only the foundations of the Anglican Church laid, but there appears&nbsp;the beginning of those evangelical and puritanical sects&nbsp;which were to become the “ dissenters ” of the following&nbsp;centuries.</span></p>
