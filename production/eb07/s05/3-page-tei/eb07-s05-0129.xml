Ants exist in immense numbers and varieties. The white ant, well known for its mischievous properties for destroying papers, furniture, &amp;c. is found in great numbers ; also the great red ant, about three fourths of an inch long, which bites severely, and usually, like the bee, leaves its sting in the wound. There are also the common red ant, the minute red ant, the large black ant, which is equal in size to the large red ant; the fire-fly, which is larger than the common fire-fly, and emits so vivid a light that words may be read by it.</p><p>Sumatra abounds in minerals. Gold is chiefly found in the mountainous districts in the interior of the island. No gold has been found, at least very frequently, to the southward of Limon, a branch of the Jambee river, or to the northward of Nalaboo, whence Acheen is principally supplied. Menangcabow has always been famed since the earliest periods of history for the riches of its gold mines, its iron ores, and its mineral productions in general ; on which account it was that the Dutch were induced to establish their head factory in its neighbourhood. Its jurisdiction in ancient times extended over the whole of Sumatra; and it is situated about eighty miles inland from Padang, and nearly in the centre of the island. The Malays are attracted to all the districts where gold is found. They are the only persons who collect it, or dig for it ; the original inhabitants confining their attention to the raising of provisions, with which they supply the Malays who search for the metal. It is found in earth taken up from the beds of rivers, and washed till the pure grains arc separated and cleansed from the particles of mud and stone. The gold is found in a pure metallic state ; and they simply beat or wash it, and sell it in the lumps or dust in which they find it. Some pieces have been found pure that weigh six or seven ounces; and they are sometimes joined with an equal bulk of marble, which does not detract from their value, being sold as mineralogical specimens. In some of the specimens the gold may be said rather to enclose the rock, than the latter to contain the gold. No accurate account can be obtained of the quantity of gold exported. From the west coast Marsden estimates that 10,000 ounces may be annually exported. But he has no data to calculate the exports from the eastern coast. It has been conjectured that the whole may amount to 15,000 ounces. It was sold at the settlements for L.3.5s. per ounce, but afterwards rose to L.3.18s., which would yield no profit on its exportation to Europe. The gold-dust is cleansed from impurities by a very dexterous process. A skilful person called a Pundi is employed, who by the sharpness of his eye can distinguish the dross from the ore with surprising nicety. He spreads out the dust on a kind of wooden platter ; and the bare particles are touched and put aside with a piece of linen cloth rolled up to a point. There are no silver mines ; but there are copper mines, of which the ore is very rich, and which resembles the Japan copper in the appearance which it presents of a mixture of gold. In the country of Menangcabow, which is nearly in the centre of the island, iron ore is collected, smelted, and formed into metal. The colour of the soil indicates its existence in many parts of the island, especially on the sea-coast, where the sand is of a strong shining black, and is attracted by loadstone. The steel which is here manufactured is of a peculiar temper, and has a degree of hardness that has never been imitated in Europe. There is, however, no industry in the island to profit by these products, and the consumption of the natives is chiefly supplied by English and Swedish bar-iron. Tin is one of the great mineral products of the island. It chiefly abounds in the neighbourhood of Palembang, on the east coast ; but in many other parts its existence is indicated, and particularly in the neighbourhood of Bencoolen. Sulphur is gathered in any quantity near the volcanoes, which abound in the island ; yellow arsenic is also found, and is an article of traffic ; and saltpetre is procured chiefly in extensive caves, the haunt of certain species of birds, of whose dung the soil is formed. Coal exists in various parts, and is washed down to the coast in floods : it is not esteemed good, being found near the surface of the earth. The veins are observed to run, not exactly in a horizontal direction, but to dip downwards ; and til) the pits have a certain depth no good coal is to be found. Mineral and hot springs are discovered in many districts, the waters resembling those of Harrowgate, and being nauseous to the palate. In the caves where the saltpetre is formed are found the edible bird-nests which are so highly prized in China as a luxury of the table, and to that country they are exported as an article of traffic. Some of the company’s servants advanced into one of these caves 740 feet, when his lights were extinguished by the damp vapour ; and into another 600 feet, through a narrow passage three feet wide and five feet high, which led into a spacious place forty feet high. Bees’ wax is <hi rend="italic">a</hi> commodity of great importance in all the eastern islands, and is exported to China, Bengal, and other parts of the continent, though no trouble is taken with the bees, which are left to settle where they list, and are never collected in hives. The honey is of a poor quality. Gum-lac, which, though found adhering to the branches of trees, is known to be the work of insects, as wax is of the bee, is procured in small quantities from the country near Bencoolen, and at Padang is a considerable article of trade. It is chiefly valuable for the animal part, which is soluble in water, and yields a fine purple dye. Ivory is an article of export ; and elephants also are sent to the Coromandel coast, vessels being built expressly tor their transport. The following are the general articles of import, as enumerated by Marsden in his comprehensive account of this island. From the coast of Coromandel, salt, blue and white cloths, chintz, and a variety of other cotton goods ; from Bengal, opium and taffetas ; from China, coarse porcelain, tobacco, and a number of miscellaneous commodities ; from the eastern islands, a striped cotton manufacture, guns, krises, and other weapons, salt and rice ; from Europe, silver, iron, lead, cutlery and other hard ware, brass wire, and scarlet cloth.</p><p>The Sumatrans are a rude people, and have made no great progress in manufacturing industry, yet there are some particular manufactures in which they excel. Many of those who have visited this country entertain an opinion that in former times it was the seat of a great Malay empire, of which Menangcabow was the capital, where arts and industry flourished ; and the monuments that have been discovered by Sir Stamford Raffles afford evidence of a higher state of refinement than at present prevails. In the histories of former times, it is mentioned that great founderies of cannon were established at Acheen ; and that manufactories of fire-arms anti knives were carried on nt Menangcabow. If this were the case, the arts have degenerated since that period, as there are now no manufactories of iron, except of nails, and various kinds of tools, such as adzes, axes, hoes, &amp;c. They are equally ignorant of the art of the carpenter ; they do not even know how to use a saw, excepting where they have been instructed by the British, by whom this instrument has been introduced. They fell trees by means of a hatchet ; and when they wish to split the wood into stems, they must choose those kinds of wood of which the direction of the grain admits of its being easily split asunder. They have woods of certain qualities, which, by the help of wedges, they are enabled to split into boards. Their chief cement is made of buffalo milk, which in a hot and damp climate proves a much stronger cement than glue. They make ink by mixing lamp-black with the white of an egg. They are however very curious and ingenious in carving, both in wood and ivory, though they show no taste</p></body></text></TEI>
