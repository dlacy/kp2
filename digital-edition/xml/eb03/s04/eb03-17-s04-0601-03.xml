a reaſoning or diſcourſe which a man holds with himſelf ; or, more properly, according to Papias, it is a diſcourſe by way of anſwer to a question that a man propoſes to himſelf.</p><p>Soliloquies are become very common on the modern ſtage ; yet nothing can be more inartificial, or more unnatural, than an actor’s making long ſpeeches to himſelf, to convey his intentions to the audience. Where ſuch diſcoveries are neceſſary to be made, the poet ſhould rather take care to give the dramatic persons ſuch confidants as may necessarily ſhare their inmoſt thoughts ; by which means they will be more naturally conveyed to the audience ; yet even this is a ſhift which an accurate poet would not have occasion for. The following lines of the duke of Buckingham concerning the uſe and abuſe of ſoliloquies deserve attention :</p><p>Soliloquies had need be very few,</p><p>Extremely ſhort, and ſpoke in paſſion too.</p><p>Our lovers talking to themſelves, for want</p><p>Of others, make the pit their confidant :</p><p>Nor is the matter mended yet, if thus</p><p>They truſt a friend, only to tell it us.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
