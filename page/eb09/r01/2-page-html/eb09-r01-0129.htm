The nest is almost always placed in a hole, whether of a tree or of a more or&nbsp;less ruined building, and contains from five to seven eggs&nbsp;of a delicate greenish-blue, occasionally sprinkled with&nbsp;faint red spots. The young on assuming their feathers&nbsp;present a great resemblance to those of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Redbreast&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(supra,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> p. 314) at the same age; but the red tail, though of&nbsp;duller hue than in the adult, forms even at this early age&nbsp;an easy means of distinguishing them. The Redstart breeds&nbsp;regularly in all the counties of England and Wales; but,&nbsp;except in such localities as have been already named, it&nbsp;is seldom plentiful. It also reaches the extreme north of&nbsp;Scotland ; but in Ireland it is of very rare occurrence. It&nbsp;appears throughout the whole of Europe in summer, and&nbsp;is known to winter in the interior of Africa. To the eastward its limits cannot yet be exactly defined, as several&nbsp;very nearly allied forms occur in Asia; and one, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R. aurorea,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">represents it in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A congeneric species which has received the name of Black Redstart,@@<sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rutidlla titys,@@<sup>2</sup></span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> is very common throughout&nbsp;the greater part of the Continent, where, from its partiality&nbsp;for gardens in towns and villages, it is often better known&nbsp;than the preceding species. It yearly occurs in certain&nbsp;parts of England, chiefly along or near the south coast, and&nbsp;curiously enough during the autumn and winter, since it&nbsp;is in central Europe only a summer visitor, and it has by&nbsp;no means the high northern range of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R. phoenicurus.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> The&nbsp;males of the Black Redstart seem to be more than one year&nbsp;in acquiring their full plumage (a rare thing in Passerine&nbsp;birds), and since they have been known to breed in the&nbsp;intermediate stage this fact has led to such birds being&nbsp;accounted a distinct species under the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R. cairii,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">thereby perplexing ornithologists for a long while, though&nbsp;now almost all authorities agree that these birds are, in&nbsp;one sense, immature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">More than a dozen species of the genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rutidlla</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> have been described, and the greater number of them seem to&nbsp;belong to the Himalayan Sub-region or its confines. One&nbsp;very pretty and interesting form is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R. moussieri</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of&nbsp;Barbary, which no doubt allies the Redstart to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Stone-Chats (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pratincola,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and of late some authors have&nbsp;included it in that genus. In an opposite direction the&nbsp;Bluethroats, apparently nearer to the Redstarts than to any&nbsp;other type, are by some authorities placed in the genus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rutidlla,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> by others considered to form a distinct genus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cyanecula,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and by at least one recent writer referred to the&nbsp;genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Edthacus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Redbreast). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">If we look upon them&nbsp;as constituting a separate genus we find it to contain two&nbsp;or three distinguishable forms:—(1) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C. suedca,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> with a&nbsp;bright bay spot in the middle of its clear blue throat,&nbsp;breeding in Scandinavia, Northern Russia, and Siberia, and&nbsp;wintering in Abyssinia and India, though rarely appearing&nbsp;in the intermediate countries, to the wonder of all who&nbsp;have studied the mystery of the migration of birds; next&nbsp;there is (2) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">C. leucocyanea,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> w<sup>T</sup>ith a white instead of a red&nbsp;gular spot, a more Western form, ranging from Barbary to&nbsp;Germany and Holland; and lastly (3) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">G. wolfi,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> thought by&nbsp;some authorities (and not without reason) to be but an&nbsp;accidental variety of the preceding (2), with its throat&nbsp;wholly blue,—a form of comparatively rare occurrence.&nbsp;The first of these is a not unfrequent, though very irregular&nbsp;visitant to England, while the second has appeared there&nbsp;but seldom, and the third never, so far as is known. By</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the ornithologist of tolerably wide views the Redstarts and Bluethroats must be regarded as forming with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Nightingale </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(vol. xvii. p. 498), Redbreast, Hedge-Sparrow,&nbsp;Wheatear, and Chats a single group of the “Family”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sylviidse,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> which has been usually called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Saxicolinss,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;is that which is most nearly allied to the Thrushes (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Thrush).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In America the name Redstart has been not unfittingly bestowed upon a bird which has some curious outward resemblance, both in&nbsp;looks and manners, to that of the Old Country, though the two are&nbsp;in the opinion of some systematists nearly as widely separated from&nbsp;each other as truly Passerine birds well can be. The American&nbsp;Redstart is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sctophaga rutidlla</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of authors, belonging to the&nbsp;purely New-World family </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">MniotiUidse,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and to a genus which contains about a dozen species, ranging from Canada (in summer) to&nbsp;Bolivia. The wonderful likeness, coupled of course with many&nbsp;sharp distinctions, upon which it would be here impossible to&nbsp;dwell, between the birds of these two genera of perfectly distinct&nbsp;origin, is a matter that must compel every evolutionist to admit&nbsp;that we are as yet very far from penetrating the action of Creative&nbsp;Power, and that especially we are wholly ignorant of the causes&nbsp;which in some instances produce analog)׳·.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REDWING, Swedish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roddnge,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Danish </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roddrossel,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> German </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rothdrossel,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Dutch </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Koperwiek,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> a species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Thrush </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Turdus iliacus</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of authors, which is an abundant&nbsp;winter visitor to the British Islands, arriving in autumn&nbsp;generally about the same time as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Fieldfare </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(vol. ix.&nbsp;p. 142) does. This bird has its common English name @@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>from the sides of its body, its inner wing-coverts, and axil-laries being of a bright reddish-orange, of which colour,&nbsp;however, there is no appearance on the wing itself while&nbsp;the bird is at rest, and not much is ordinarily seen while&nbsp;it is in flight. In other respects it is very like a Song-Thrush, and indeed in France and some other countries it&nbsp;bears the name Mauvis or Mavis, often given to that species&nbsp;in some parts of Britain; but its coloration is much more&nbsp;vividly contrasted, and a conspicuous white, instead of a&nbsp;light brown, streak over the eye at once affords a ready&nbsp;diagnosis. The Redwing breeds in Iceland, in the sub-alpine and arctic districts of Norway, Sweden, and Finland,&nbsp;and thence across Northern Russia and Siberia, becoming&nbsp;scarce to the eastward of the Yenissei, and not extending&nbsp;beyond Lake Baikal. In winter it visits the whole of&nbsp;Europe and North Africa, occasionally reaching Madeira,&nbsp;while to the eastward it is found at that season in the&nbsp;north-western Himalayas and Kohat. Many writers have&nbsp;praised the song of this bird, comparing it with that of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Nightingale </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(vol. xvii. p. 498); but herein they seem to&nbsp;have been as much mistaken as in older times was Linnmus,&nbsp;who, according to Nilsson </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Om. Svedca,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> i. p. 177, note),&nbsp;failed to distinguish in life this species from its commoner&nbsp;congener </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">T. musicus.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> The notes of the Redwing are indeed&nbsp;pleasing in places where no better songster exists; but the&nbsp;present writer, who has many times heard them under very&nbsp;favourable circumstances, cannot but suppose that those&nbsp;who have called the Redwing the “Nightingale” of Norway or of Sweden have attributed to it the credit that&nbsp;properly belongs to the Song-Thrush ; for to him it seems&nbsp;that the vocal utterances of the Redwing do not place it&nbsp;even in the second rank of feathered musicians.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The author of a popular work on British birds has suggested for&nbsp;this species the name of “ Blackstart,” thereby recording his ign&lt; ־ance&nbsp;of the meaning of the second syllable of the compound name as already&nbsp;explained, for the Black Redstart has a tail as red as that of the commoner English bird.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The orthography of the specific term would seem to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">titis (Ann.&nbsp;Nat. ITiston/,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> ser. 4, x. p. 227), a word possibly cognate with the first&nbsp;syllable of Titlark and Titmouse.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@3</sup> Many old writers assert that this bird used to be known in England as the “ Swinepipe ”; but, except in books, this name does not seem&nbsp;to survive to the present day. There is no reason, however, to doubt&nbsp;that it was once in vogue, and the only question is how it may have&nbsp;arisen. If it has not been corrupted from the German </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Weindrossd</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or&nbsp;some other similar name, it may refer to the soft inward whistle which&nbsp;the bird often utters, resembling the sound of the pipe used by the&nbsp;swineherds of old when collecting the animals under their charge,&nbsp;whether in the wide stubbles or the thick beech-woods ; but another&nbsp;form of the word (which may, however, be erroneous) is “ Windpipe,”&nbsp;and this might lead to a conclusion very different, if indeed to any&nbsp;conclusion at all. “ Whindle ” and “ Wheenerd ” have also been&nbsp;given as two other old English names of this bird (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Harl. Miscellany,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1st ed., ii. p. 558), and these may be referred to the local German&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Weindrustle</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Winsel.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
