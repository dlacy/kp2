a large and populous city of Spain, stands on the banks of the Guadalquiver, in the midſt of a rich, and to the eye a boundleſs, plain ; in W. Long. 5° 5' N. Lat. 37° 20'. This city is ſuppoſed to have been founded by the Phoenicians, who gave it the name of <hi rend="italic">Hiſpalis.</hi> When it fell under the power of the Romans, it was called <hi rend="italic">Julia ;</hi> and at laſt, alter a variety of corruptions, was called <hi rend="italic">Sebilla</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sevilla ;</hi> both of which names are retained by the Spaniards. The Romans embelliſhed it with many magnificent edifices ; of which ſcarce any veſtige now remains. The Gothic kings for ſome time made it their reſidence : but in proceſs of time they removed their court to Toledo ; and Seville was taken by ſtorm ſoon after the victory obtained at Xeres over the Gothic king Rodrigo.— In 1027, Seville became an independent monarchy ; but was conquered 70 years afterwards by Yuſef Almoravides, an African prince. At laſt it was taken by Ferdinand III. after a year’s ſiege ; and 300,000 Moors were then obliged to leave the place. Not- withſtanding this prodigious emigration, Seville continued to be a great and populous city, and ſoon after it was enlarged and adorned with many magnificent buildings, the chief of which is the cathedral. Seville arrived at its utmoſt pitch of grandeur a little after the diſcovery of America, the reaſon of which was, that all the valuable productions of the West Indies were carried thither. Its court was then the moſt ſplendid in Europe; but in the courſe of a few years all this grandeur diſappeared, owing to the impediments in navigating the Guadalquiver. The ſuperior excellence of the port of Cadiz induced government to order the galeons to be ſtationed there in time to come.</p><p>Seville is of a circular form, and is ſurrounded by a wall about five miles and a half in circumference, containing 176 towers. The ditch in many places is filled up. The ſtreets of Seville are crooked and dirty, and moſt of them ſo narrow that two carriages can ſcarcely paſs one another abreaſt.</p><p>Seville is laid to contain 80,268 fouls, and is divided into 30 pariſhes. It has 84 convents, with 24 hospitals<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[mu] Townsend's Travels, vol. ii.</p></note>.</p><p>Of the public edifices of this city the cathedral is the moſt magnificent. Its dimenſions are 420 feet in length, 263 in breadth within the walls, and 126 feet in height. It has nine doors, 80 altars, at which 500 maſſes are daily celebrated, and 80 windows of painted glaſs, each of which coſt 1000 ducats. At one angle ſtands a tower of Mooriſh workmanſhip 350 feet high. On the top of it is the giralda, or large brazen image, which, with its palm branch, weighs near one ton and a half, yet turns as a weather-cock with the slightest variation of the wind. The whole work is brick and mortar. The paſſage to the top is an inclined plane, which winds about in the inside in the manner of a ſpiral ſtaircaſe, ſo eaſy of aſcent that a horſe might trot from the bottom to the top ; at the ſame time it is ſo wide that two horſemen may ride abreaſt. What appears very unaccountable, the ſolid maſonry in the upper half is juſt as thick again as that in the lower, tho’ on the outſide the tower is all the way of the same dimenſions. In the opinion of Mr Swinburne, this cathedral is inferior to Yorkminſter. Its treaſures are ineſtimable ; one altar with all its ornaments is ſolid fiver ; of the ſame metal are the images of St Isidore and St Leander, which are as large as the life ; and a tabernacle for the hoſt more than four yards high, adorned with eight and forty columns. Before the choir of the cathedral is the tomb of the celebrated Chriſtopher Columbus, the diſcoverer of America. His monument consiſts of one ſtone only, on which these words are inſcribed,<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[mu] Bourgoanne's Travels, vol. ii.</p></note> A <hi rend="italic">Castella y Arragon otro mundo dio Colon ;</hi> that is, “ To Caſtile and Arragon Columbus gave another world :” an inſcription ſimple and expreſſive, the juſtneſs of which will be acknowledged by thoſe who have read the adventures of this illuſtrious but unfortunate man. The cathedral was begun by Don Sancho the Brave, about the cloſe of the 13th century, and ſiniſhed by John II. about an hundred years after. To the cathedral belongs a library of 20,000 volumes, collected by Hernando the ſon of Columbus ; but, to the diſgrace of the Spaniards, it has ſcarcely received any addition ſince the death of the founder. The organ in this cathedral is a very ingenious piece of mechaniſm<note anchored="true" n="3" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[m]* Vol. ii. p. 318.</p></note> *. “ I was much pleaſed (says Mr Townſend in his intereſting travels) with the conſtruction of a new organ, containing 5300 pipes, with 110 stops, which latter, as the builder told me, is 50 more than are in the famous one of Harlem ; yet, ſo ample are the bellows, that when ſtretched they ſupply the full organ 15 minutes. The mode of filling them with air is ſingular ; for inſtead of working with his hands, a man walks backwards and forwards along an inclined plane of about 15 feet in length, which is balanced in the middle on its axis ; under each end is a pair of bellows, of about six feet by three and an half. These communicate with five other pair united by a bar ; and the latter are ſo contrived, that when they are in danger of being overſtrained, a valve is lifted up, and gives them relief. Paſſing 10 times along the inclined plane fills all theſe veſſels.”</p><p>The Canos de Carmone, or great aqueduct of Seville, is reckoned by the hiſtorians of this city one of the moſt wonderful works of antiquity.<note anchored="true" n="4" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[mu] Swineburne's Travels, p. 283.</p></note> Mr Swinburne, however, remarks, that it is ugly, crooked, the arches unequal, and the architecture neglected. The conduit is ſo leaky, that a rivulet is formed by the waſte water. Nevertheleſs, it ſtill conveys to the city an ample ſupply of water ſufficient to turn ſeveral mills, and to give almoſt every houſe in town the benefit of it.</p><p>Many of the convents are remarkable for the beauty of their architecture ; but in Seville the eye covets only pictures, of which there is a wonderful profuſion. Among theſe are the works of the famous painter Murillo, with many others univerſally admired.</p><p>The convent of the Franciſeans contains 15 cloiſters, with apartments for 200 monks, though, when Mr Townſend vihted them, they amounted only to 140. The annual expenditure of theſe, who are all fed on charity, is about L. 4000 Sterling<note anchored="true" n="5" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[mu] Townsend's Travels, vol. ii. p. 326.</p></note>. “ In the principal cloiſter (ſays the ſame intelligent traveller), which is entirely incloſed by a multitude of little chapels, are repreſented, in 14 pictures, each called a sta <hi rend="italic">tiοn,</hi> all the ſufferings of the Redeemer. Theſe are ſo arranged as to mark given diſtances by walking round the cloiſter from the firſt to the ſecond, and ſo in order to the rest. Over them is mentioned the number of ſteps taken by our Lord between the ſeveral incidents of his paſſion in his way to Calvary ; and theſe preciſely are the paces.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0332.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0326"/>
meaſured for the penitents in their progress from one ſtation to another. Over one is the following inſcription : ‘ This ſtation conſiſts of 1087 ſteps. Here the bleſſed Redeemer fell a ſecond time under the weight of his croſs, and here is to be gained the indulgence of ſeven years and forty quarantines. Mentel prayer, the Paternoſter, and the Ave Maria.’ This may ſerve as an example for the rest.”</p><p>The principal manufacture of Seville is ſnuff. Mr Townſend, who paid particular attention to it, informs us, that the building in which it is carried on is elegant and ſimple in its form, and is about 600 feet by 480, and not leſs than 60 feet in height, with four regular fronts, incloſing 28 quadrangles. It coſt 37,000,000 of reals, or about T. 370,000. At preſent ( 1787), no more than 1700 workmen are employed, and 100 horſes or mules; but formerly 3000 men were engaged, and near 400 horſes. This falling off is attributed by Mr Swinburne to a practice which the directors followed, of adulterating the tobacco with the red earth of Almazarron. When Mr Townſend viſited this manufacture, they had changed their ſyſtem. From the year 1780, he informs us, the annual ſale of tobacco from Brazil has been 1,500,000 pounds, purchaſed ſrom the Portugueſe at three reals a pound ; and of ſnuff from the produce of their own colonies 1,600,000 pounds, beſide <hi rend="italic">cigars</hi><note anchored="true" n="6" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> Theſe are little rolls of tobacco which the Spaniards ſmoke without a pipe.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> to a very conſiderable amount. They have lying by them more than 5,000,000 of pounds of ſnuff unfold ; but as it will not ſuffer by age, they are not uneasy at this accumulation. Beſides the peculiar kind of ſnuff with which Spain was accustomed to ſupply the market, they have lately introduced the manufacture of rappee. In this branch alone are employed 220 perſons, old and young, with 16 mules.</p><p>“ All the workmen (continues Mr Townſend) depoſit their cloaks at the door ; and when they go out are ſo ſtrictly examined, that they have little chance of being able to conceal tobacco ; yet they ſometimes venture to hide it about their perſons. An officer and a guard is always attending to take delinquents into cuſtody ; and that they may prevent reſiſtance, no workman is permitted to enter with a knife. Were it not for this precaution, the conſequence of a detection might be fatal. The whole buſineſs is conducted by a director, with a ſalary of 40,000 reals a-year, and 54 ſuperior officers, aſſiſted by as many ſubordinate to them. For grinding their ſnuff, they have 40 mills, each conſiſting of a ſtone roller, moved by a large horſe or mule, with the traces faſtened to a beam of eight feet in length, in the angle of 45 degrees, consequently loſing preciſely half his force. ”</p><p>Before Mr Townſend left Seville, according to his uſual practice, which was truly laudable, he enquired into the prices of labour and proviſions. As a piece of curious and uſeful information, and as an example to other travellers, we preſent them to our readers. They are as follow ;</p><table> <row> <cell> Day-labourers </cell> <cell> 4½ reals, about L. 0 0 10 <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> </cell> </row> <row> <cell><p>Carpenters from 7 to Joiners, if goodwork-</p><p>men,</p></cell> <cell> 24 or 0 4 9 </cell> </row> </table><p>Carpenters from 7 to Joiners, if goodwork-</p><p>men,</p><table> <row> <cell> Weavers, if good workmen, 15 reals, about - - L. </cell> <cell><p>0</p></cell> <cell> 3 </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> </row> <row> <cell> Bread, for 3 lb. of <hi rend="italic">16 oz. or</hi> 16 quartos, or </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 4 ½ </cell> </row> <row> <cell> ſometimes 28 quartos, or </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 7 <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> </cell> </row> <row> <cell> Beef, 30 quartos for 32 oz. per lb. about </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 4 ½ </cell> </row> <row> <cell> Mutton, 38 do. do. - ' - </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 5 1/3 1/2 </cell> </row> <row> <cell> Kid, 24 do. </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 3⅜ </cell> </row> <row> <cell> Pork from 36 to 42 quartos, do. or </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 5 1/16 </cell> </row> <row> <cell> </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 0 </cell> <cell> 5 3/3 9/1 </cell> </row> </table><p>0</p><p>The price of wheat has at different periods been very remarkable.
