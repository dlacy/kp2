<p><span class="font0">with thickets. If the place be watered by a ſtream, the croſſings may be in a variety of pleaſing deſigns;&nbsp;and if a ſpring riſe, or only a well for common uſe be&nbsp;ſunk by the ſide of the way, a little covering over it&nbsp;maybe contrived which ſhall at the ſame time be ſimple&nbsp;and pretty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are few villages which may not eaſily be rendered agreeable. A ſmall alteration in a houſe will ſometimes occaſion a great difference in the appearance. By the help of a few trifling plantations, the&nbsp;objects which have a good effect may be ſhown to advantage, thoſe which have not may be concealed, and&nbsp;ſuch as are ſimilar be diſguiſed. And any form which&nbsp;offends the eye, whether of ground, of trees, or of&nbsp;buildings, may ſometimes be broken by the ſlighteſt&nbsp;circumſtances, by an advanced paling, or only by a&nbsp;bench. Variety and beauty, in ſuch a ſubject, are rather the effects of attention than expence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But if the paſſage through the village cannot be pleaſant; if the buildings are all alike, or ſtand in unmeaning rows and ſimilar ſituations; if the place fur-niſhes no opportunities to contrail the forms of dwellings with thoſe of out-houſes; to introduce trees and&nbsp;thickets; to interpoſe fields and meadows; to mix farms&nbsp;with cottages; and to place the ſeveral objects in different poſitions: yet on the outſide even of ſuch a village there certainly is room for wood; and by that&nbsp;alone the whole may be grouped into a maſs, which&nbsp;ſhall be agreeable when ſkirted by a riding; and ſtill&nbsp;more ſo when ſeen from a diſtance. The ſeparate farms&nbsp;in the fields, alſo, by planting ſome trees about them,&nbsp;or perhaps only by managing thoſe already on the ſpot,&nbsp;may be made very intereſting objects; or if a new one&nbsp;is to be built, beauty may be conſulted in the form of&nbsp;the houſe, and the diſpoſition of its appurtenances.&nbsp;Sometimes a character not their own, as the ſemblance&nbsp;of a caſtle or an abbey, may be given to them; they&nbsp;will thereby acquire a degree of conſideration, which&nbsp;they cannot otherwiſe be entitled to: and objects to&nbsp;improve the views are ſo important to a riding, that&nbsp;buildings muſt ſometimes be erected for that purpoſe&nbsp;only: but they ſhould be ſuch as by an actual effect&nbsp;adorn or dignify the ſcene; not thoſe little ſlight deceptions which are too well known to ſucceed, and&nbsp;have no merit if they fail: for though a fallacy ſometimes contributes to ſupport a character, or ſuggeſts&nbsp;ideas to the imagination, yet in itſelf it may be no improvement of a ſcene; and a bit of turret, the tip of&nbsp;a ſpire, and the other ordinary ſubjects of theſe frivolous attempts, are ſo inſignificant as objects, that&nbsp;whether they are real or fictitious is almoſt a matter of&nbsp;indifference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſame means by which the proſpects from a riding are improved, may be applied to thoſe from&nbsp;a garden; though they are not eſſential to its character, they are important to its beauty; and wherever&nbsp;they abound, the extent only of the range which commands them, determines whether they ſhall be ſeen&nbsp;from a riding or a garden. If they belong to the latter, that aſſumes in ſome degree the predominant properties of the former, and the two characters approach</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">very near to each other: but ſtill each has its peculiarities. Progreſs is a prevailing idea in a riding; and the pleaſantneſs of the way is, therefore, a principal conſideration: but particular ſpots are more attended to in a garden; and to them the communications&nbsp;ought to be ſubordinate; their direction muſt be generally accommodated, their beauties ſometimes ſacri-ficed to the ſituation and the character of the ſcenes&nbsp;they lead to; an advantageous approach to theſe muſt&nbsp;be preferred to an agreeable line for the walk; and the&nbsp;circumſtances which might otherwiſe become it are misplaced, if they anticipate the openings: it ſhould ſometimes be contraſted to them; be retired and dark if&nbsp;they are ſplendid or gay, and ſimple if they are richly&nbsp;adorned. At other times it may burſt unexpectedly&nbsp;out upon them; not on account of the ſurpriſe, which&nbsp;Can have its effect only once; but the impreſſions art&nbsp;ſtronger by being ſudden; and the contrail is enforced&nbsp;by the quickneſs of the tranſition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In a riding, the ſcenes are only the amuſements of the way, through which it proceeds without ſtopping:&nbsp;in a garden they are principal; and the ſubordinatiori&nbsp;of the walk raiſes their importance. Every art, therefore, ſhould be exerted to make them ſeem parts of the&nbsp;place. Diſtant proſpects cannot be ſo; and the alienation does not offend us; we are familiarized to it;&nbsp;the extent forbids every thought of a cloſer connection;&nbsp;and if a continuation be preſerved between them and&nbsp;the points which command them, we are ſatisfied. But&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">home-views</span><span class="font0"> ſuggeſt other ideas; they appear to be within our reach: they are not only beautiful in proſpect,&nbsp;and we can perceive that the ſpots are delightful; but&nbsp;we wiſh to examine, to inhabit, and to enjoy them.&nbsp;Every apparent impediment to that gratification is a&nbsp;diſappointment; and when the ſcenes begin beyond the&nbsp;opening, the conſequence of the place 13 lowered; nothing within it engages our notice: it is an exhibition only of beauties, the property of which does not&nbsp;belong to it; and that idea, though indifferent in a riding which is but a paſſage, is very diſadvantageous&nbsp;to ſuch a reſidence as a garden. To obviate ſuch an&nbsp;idea, the points of view ſhould be made important;&nbsp;the objects within be appendages to thoſe without; the&nbsp;ſeparations be removed or concealed; and large portions of the garden be annexed to the ſpots which are&nbsp;contiguous to it. The ideal boundary of the place&nbsp;is then carried beyond the ſcenes which are thus appropriated to it; and the wide circuit in which they lie,&nbsp;and the different poſitions in which they may be ſhown,&nbsp;afford a greater variety than can generally be found is&nbsp;any garden, the ſcenery of which is confined to the in-cloſure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Persfield @@(a) is not a large place; the park contains about 300 acres; and the houſe ſtands in the midſt of it. On the ſide of the approach, the inequalities of&nbsp;the ground are gentle, and the plantations pretty; but&nbsp;nothing there is great. On the other ſide, a beautiful&nbsp;lawn falls precipitately every way into a deep vale which&nbsp;ſhelves down the middle; the declivities are diverſified&nbsp;with clumps and with groves; and a number of large&nbsp;trees ſtraggle along the bottom. This lawn is encom</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
