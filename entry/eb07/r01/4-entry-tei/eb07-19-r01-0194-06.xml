<p><label>REVENGE</label>
means the return of injury for injury, and differs materially from that sudden resentment which rises in the mind immediately on being injured ; which, so far from being culpable when restrained within due bounds, is absolutely necessary for self-preservation. Revenge, on the contrary, is a cool and deliberate wickedness, and is often executed years after the offence had been given; and the desire of it is generally the effect of littleness, weakness, and vice, whilst to do right, and to suffer wrong, is a mark of a great soul, that scorns to stoop to suggested revenge.</p>
