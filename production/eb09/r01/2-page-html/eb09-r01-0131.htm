<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">movement assumed so much variety of character, and was decided by circumstances of time and ¡)lace of so different&nbsp;a kind, that its essential features often become merged&nbsp;and almost lost in their combination with other and&nbsp;altogether extraneous elements,&nbsp;e Nor are the considerations arising out of diversities of&nbsp;race, divergencies of political interests, and varied issues&nbsp;the only difficulties which attach to any attempt to treat&nbsp;the movement as a whole. We must also bear in mind&nbsp;the very different conceptions of the end to be attained&nbsp;which at successive stages of its history have modified&nbsp;its teaching and its organization, and eventually in a&nbsp;great measure determined its geographical limits. These&nbsp;conceptions may be distinguished as those involving (1) a&nbsp;reform of discipline, (2) a reform of doctrine, (3) a modification of the current dogmatic teaching. Of these three distinct conceptions the first, taking its rise in the generally&nbsp;admitted corrupt practice of the Roman Church, aimed&nbsp;at little more than a restoration of discipline,—a reform&nbsp;of morals, that is to say, among the clergy and the monastic orders, and the abolition of those various abuses&nbsp;which had grown up under the lax administration and&nbsp;baneful examples of successive popes and of the Curia;&nbsp;the second, although demanding a reform of doctrine as&nbsp;well as of discipline, sought simply to restore what was&nbsp;believed to be the teaching of the primitive as opposed to&nbsp;the mediaeval church; while the third, guided in the&nbsp;first instance rather by an only half-conscious instinct&nbsp;than by any avowed standard of belief, sought eventually&nbsp;to establish the right of private judgment, to the almost&nbsp;entire repudiation of authority, whether as expressed in&nbsp;the decrees of councils, in the confessions of the Reformed&nbsp;churches, or in the creed of Trent. And it is from this&nbsp;last point of view that the Reformation has gradually&nbsp;come to be regarded as a new commencement rather than&nbsp;as a restoration of belief,—as a point of departure towards&nbsp;a higher and more enlightened faith rather than as a&nbsp;return to an ancient, imperfectly ascertained, and possibly&nbsp;obsolete standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">But, by whichever of these aims the movement in favour of reformation was guided, the dominant conception has&nbsp;not unfrequently operated quite independently of the other&nbsp;two. Demands for reform of discipline not unfrequently&nbsp;resulted in disunion w<sup>r</sup>here disagreement with respect to&nbsp;doctrine did not exist. The further definition of already&nbsp;accepted doctrine, again, even when made in connexion&nbsp;with some minor article of belief and involving but an&nbsp;almost imperceptible divergence of interpretation, often&nbsp;proved productive of a serious schism where in questions&nbsp;of discipline there was perfect unanimity. The right of&nbsp;private judgment, when urged in contravention of any of&nbsp;the newly formulated standards of discipline or belief, involved an equally decisive rupture with those who recognized only the traditional sources of doctrine. It is&nbsp;evident, therefore, that the Reformation, when regarded&nbsp;from a fairly comprehensive point of view, must appear&nbsp;as a highly complex movement carrying in itself the elements of further controversy and conflict. Even the theory&nbsp;which would seem to afford the most satisfactory solution&nbsp;of its varied phenomena—that which teaches us to look&nbsp;upon it as a Teutonic revolt, intellectual no less than religious, against the traditions which the Latin Church in&nbsp;the course of centuries had invented and imposed on the&nbsp;faith and habits of thought of Western Christendom—&nbsp;often fails us as a clue to its widely different manifestations, and other disturbing causes seem to forbid the effort&nbsp;to refer them to any general principle. The character and&nbsp;policy of the reigning Roman pontiff, the jealousies and&nbsp;divergent interests of the several European states and the&nbsp;special aims of their several rulers, the spell winch imperial</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">institutions and traditions long continued to exercise over the minds of all but the most advanced and independent&nbsp;thinkers, are all important factors in the movement. If,&nbsp;however, w<sup>r</sup>e endeavour to assign the causes which prevented the Reformation from being carried even to but&nbsp;partial success long prior to the 16th century, we can&nbsp;have no difficulty in deciding that foremost among them&nbsp;must be placed the manner in which the mediaeval mind&nbsp;was fettered by a servile regard for precedent. To the&nbsp;men of the Middle Ages, whether educated or uneducated,&nbsp;no measure of reform seemed defensible which appeared&nbsp;in the light of an innovation. Precedent was the standard&nbsp;whereby every authority, lay or clerical, was held to be&nbsp;bound; and to this rule the only exceptions were a general&nbsp;council and the supreme pontiff. Even Gregory IX. or&nbsp;Clement V., when he assumed to promulgate additions to&nbsp;the existing code of the Universal Church, was understood&nbsp;to do so simply in his capacity of infallible expounder of&nbsp;essential and unalterable doctrine; w'hile no reform, how-ever seemingly expedient or however recommended by its&nbsp;abstract merits, was held to be justifiable if it could be&nbsp;shown to be in conflict with ancient and authoritative&nbsp;tradition. The Reformers themselves always maintained&nbsp;that the doctrines which they enforced rested on Scriptural&nbsp;precedent and primitive example. Their assertion w<sup>r</sup>as&nbsp;frequently challenged by their antagonists; and it may&nbsp;reasonably be doubted whether even Luther or Calvin&nbsp;could have commanded any considerable following had&nbsp;not their doctrinal teaching been combined with a demand&nbsp;for a reformation of discipline which rested on undeniable&nbsp;precedent, and to <sup>-</sup>which the circumstances of the time&nbsp;imparted new and irresistible force,—a force, however,&nbsp;which had been long accumulating and had been derived&nbsp;in no small measure from the blind obstinacy of the Roman&nbsp;see in times long antecedent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The existence long before the 16th century of a strong] desire to bring about a reformation of discipline within the<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>church itself is attested by evidence which it will suffice j&nbsp;to pass by with little more than an allusion. Among the j&nbsp;most notable instances are those afforded by the rise of the&nbsp;Dominican and Franciscan orders in the 13th century and&nbsp;of the Brethren of St Jerome (or the Brethren of the&nbsp;Common Life) in the 14th century,—efforts based upon&nbsp;general conviction, which resulted in spontaneous combinations. Similar in origin, though more strictly ecclesiastical in character, were the designs of the great councils&nbsp;which successively assembled at Pisa (1409), at Constance&nbsp;(1414), and at Basel (1431). Among those who were distinguished in these assemblies by their strenuous advocacy&nbsp;of reform, Pierre d’Ailly and his pupil Jean Charlier de&nbsp;Gerson, both successively chancellor of the university of&nbsp;Paris, and Nicholas de CRmenges, archdeacon of Bayeux,&nbsp;were especially conspicuous. Each alike upheld in the&nbsp;plainest language the superiority of a general council to&nbsp;the pope, and the obligation that rested on such a body&nbsp;to address itself to the task of church reform whenever&nbsp;the necessity might arise, and the supreme pontiff himself&nbsp;be found either incapable of such a labour or unwilling to&nbsp;initiate it. Of the widespread necessity for such reform,&nbsp;as shown by the condition of the clergy and the monasteries, the remarkable treatise by Nicholas de Clemenges,@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Corrupto Ecelesix Statu</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, affords alone sufficient evidence.&nbsp;By Michelet@@<sup>2</sup> this powerful tractate has been compared,&nbsp;for its vigour and the effect which it produced, to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;Captivitate Ecelesix Babylonica</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Luther; and it is a&nbsp;striking proof of the deep-rooted corruption of the whole&nbsp;church that such flagrant abuses should have continued&nbsp;to exist for another century with little or no abatement.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
