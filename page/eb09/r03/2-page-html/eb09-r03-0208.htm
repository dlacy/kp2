<p><span class="font1">treatment of skies with crude blues and orange, and his chiaroscuro usually is much exaggerated. On his return&nbsp;to Paris he soon became distinguished as a painter, and&nbsp;was employed by Louis XIV. to decorate the walls of his&nbsp;palaces at St Germain and Marly. He was soon admitted&nbsp;a member of the French Academy of the Fine Arts, but&nbsp;on the revocation of the edict of Nantes he was obliged&nbsp;to take refuge in Holland, and his name was struck off&nbsp;the Academy roll. From Holland he was invited to England by the duke of Montague, who employed him,&nbsp;together with other French painters, to paint the walls of&nbsp;his palace, Montague House.@@<sup>1</sup> Rousseau was also employed&nbsp;to paint architectural subjects and landscapes in the palace&nbsp;of Hampton Court, where many of his decorative panels&nbsp;still exist. He spent the latter part of his life in London,&nbsp;where he died in 1693.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides being a painter in oil and fresco Rousseau was an etcher of some ability ; many etchings by his hand from the works of the&nbsp;Caracci and from his own designs still exist ; they are vigorous,&nbsp;though too coarse in execution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROUSSEAU, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jean Baptiste</span><span class="font1"> (1670-1741), a poet of some merit and a wit of considerable dexterity, was born&nbsp;at Paris on the IOth April 1670; he died at Brussels&nbsp;on the 17th March 1741. The son of a shoemaker, he is&nbsp;said to have been ashamed of his parentage and relations&nbsp;when he acquired a certain popularity, but the abundance&nbsp;of literary quarrels in which he spent his life, and the&nbsp;malicious inventiveness of his chief enemy, Voltaire, make&nbsp;any such stories of small account. He was certainly well&nbsp;educated and early gained favour with Boileau, who did&nbsp;not regard many people favourably ; but authentic intelligence as to his youth is very scarce. He does not seem to&nbsp;have attempted literature very young, and when he began&nbsp;he began with the theatre, for which at no part of his life&nbsp;does he seem to have had any aptitude. A one-act&nbsp;comedy, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Cafe,</span><span class="font1"> failed in 1694, and he was not much&nbsp;happier with a more ambitious play, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Flatteurs,</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;with the opera of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Venus and Adonis.</span><span class="font1"> He would not take&nbsp;these warnings, and tried in 1700 another comedy, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le&nbsp;Capmcieujc,</span><span class="font1"> which had the same fate. By this time he&nbsp;had already (it is not quite clear how) obtained influential&nbsp;patrons, such as Breteuil and Tallard, had gone with&nbsp;Tallard as an attaché to London, and, in days when literature still led to high position, seemed likely to achieve&nbsp;success. To tell the whole story of his misfortunes would&nbsp;take far more space than can be spared him here. They&nbsp;began with what may be called a club squabble at a&nbsp;certain Café Laurent, which was much frequented by&nbsp;literary men, and where Rousseau indulged in lampoons&nbsp;on his companions. A shower of libellous and sometimes&nbsp;obscene verses was written by or attributed to him, and&nbsp;at last he was practically turned out of the café. At the&nbsp;same time his poems, as yet only singly printed or in&nbsp;manuscript, acquired him a great reputation, and not&nbsp;unjustly, for Rousseau is certainly the best French writer&nbsp;of serious lyrics between Racine and Chénier. He had in&nbsp;1701 been made a member of the Académie des Inscriptions ; he had been offered, though he had not accepted,&nbsp;profitable places in the revenue department ; he had&nbsp;become a favourite of the libertine but not Uninfluential&nbsp;coterie of the Temple; and in 1710 he presented himself&nbsp;as a candidate for the Académie Française. Then began&nbsp;the second chapter (the first had lasted ten years) of a&nbsp;history of the animosities of authors which is almost the&nbsp;strangest though not the most important on record. A&nbsp;copy of verses, more offensive than ever, was handed to the&nbsp;original object of Rousseau’s jealousy, and, getting wind,&nbsp;occasioned the bastinadoing of the reputed author by a&nbsp;certain La Faye or La Faille, a soldier who was reflected</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> Montague House stood on the site of the British Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">on. Legal proceedings of various kinds followed, and Rousseau either had or thought he had ground for ascribing the lampoon to Joseph Saurin. More law ensued,&nbsp;and the end of it was that in 1712 Rousseau, not appearing, was condemned </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">par contumace</span><span class="font1"> to perpetual exile. He&nbsp;actually suffered it, remaining for the rest of his life in&nbsp;foreign countries except for a short time in 1738, when he&nbsp;returned clandestinely to Paris to try for a recall. It&nbsp;should be said that he might have had this if he had not&nbsp;steadfastly protested his innocence and refused to accept a&nbsp;mere pardon. No one has ever completely cleared up the&nbsp;story, and it must be admitted that, except as exhibiting&nbsp;very strikingly the strange idiosyncrasies of the 18th&nbsp;century in France, and as having affected the fortunes of&nbsp;a man of letters of some eminence, it is not worth much&nbsp;attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rousseau’s good and ill luck did not cease with his exile. First Prince Eugene and then other persons of distinction took him under their protection, and he printed&nbsp;at Soleure the first edition of his poetical works. But by&nbsp;fault or misfortune he still continued to quarrel. Voltaire&nbsp;and he met at Brussels in 1722, and, though Voltaire had&nbsp;hitherto pretended or felt a great admiration for him,&nbsp;something happened which turned this admiration into&nbsp;hatred. Voltaire’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Pour et Le Contre</span><span class="font1"> is said to have&nbsp;shocked Rousseau, who expressed his sentiments freely.&nbsp;At any rate the latter had thenceforward no fiercer enemy&nbsp;than Voltaire. Rousseau, however, was not much affected&nbsp;by Voltaire’s enmity, and pursued for nearly twenty years&nbsp;a life of literary work, of courtiership, and of rather&nbsp;obscure speculation and business. Although he never&nbsp;made his fortune, it does not seem that he was ever in&nbsp;want. When he died his death had the singular result of&nbsp;eliciting from a poetaster, Lefranc de Pompignan, an ode&nbsp;of real excellence and perhaps better than anything of&nbsp;Rousseau’s own work. That work, however, has high&nbsp;merits, and is divided, roughly speaking, into two strangely&nbsp;contrasted divisions. One consists of formal and partly&nbsp;sacred odes and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cantates</span><span class="font1"> of the stiffest character, the other&nbsp;of brief epigrams, sometimes licentious and always or&nbsp;almost always ill-natured. In the latter class of work&nbsp;Rousseau is only inferior to his friend Piron. In the&nbsp;former he stands almost alone. The frigidity of conventional diction and the disuse of all really lyrical rhythm&nbsp;which characterize his period do not prevent his odes and&nbsp;cantates from showing true poetical faculty, grievously&nbsp;cramped no doubt, but still existing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides the Soleure edition mentioned above, Rousseau published (visiting England for the purpose) another issue of his work at&nbsp;London in 1723. The chief edition since is that of Amar in 1820.&nbsp;M. A. de Latour has published (Paris, Gamier, 1869) a useful&nbsp;though not complete edition, with notes of merit and a biographical&nbsp;introduction which would have been better if the facts had been&nbsp;more punctually and precisely stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROUSSEAU, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jean Jacques</span><span class="font1"> (1712-1778), was born at Geneva on the 28th June.1712. His family had established themselves in that city at the time of the religious&nbsp;wars, but tlιey were of pure French origin. Rousseau’s&nbsp;father Isaac was a watchmaker ; his mother, Suzanne&nbsp;Bernard, was the daughter of a minister ; she died in&nbsp;childbirth, and Rousseau, who was the second son, was&nbsp;brought up in a very haphazard fashion, his father being&nbsp;a dissipated, violent-tempered, and foolish person. He,&nbsp;however, taught him to read early, and seems to have laid&nbsp;the foundation of the flighty sentimentalism in morals and&nbsp;politics which Rousseau afterwards illustrated with his&nbsp;genius. When the boy was ten years old his father got&nbsp;entangled in a disgraceful brawl and fled from Geneva,&nbsp;apparently without troubling himself about Jean Jacques.&nbsp;The father and son had little more to do with each other&nbsp;and rarely met. Rousseau was, however, taken charge of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
