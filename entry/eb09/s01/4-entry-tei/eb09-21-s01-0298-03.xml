It is a clean and neat-looking place, with rows of whitewashed houses in the European town, clusters of palm-thatched huts in the Indian suburb, a large church, the ruins of a stone fort, and, standing apart, the municipal buildings with the court-house. As the Rio Tapajós is navigable for steamers to the rapids, 170 miles above Santarem, and for boats to within a short distance of Diamantino, the town carries on a considerable trade with Matto Grosso and the country along the banks. The population and importance of the place, originally founded by a Jesuit missionary for his converts in 1661, and made a city in 1848, are steadily increasing.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
