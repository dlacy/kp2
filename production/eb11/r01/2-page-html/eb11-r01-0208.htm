The first of&nbsp;these is a not infrequent, though very irregular, visitant to&nbsp;England, while the second has appeared there but seldom, and&nbsp;the third never, so far as is known.

<p><span class="font0">In America the name redstart has been bestowed upon a bird which has some curious outward resemblance, both in looks and&nbsp;manners, to that of the Old Country, though the two are in the&nbsp;opinion of some systematists nearly as widely separated from each&nbsp;other as truly Passerine birds well can be. The American redstart&nbsp;is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Setοphaga ruticilla,</span><span class="font0"> belonging to the purely New-World family&nbsp;Mniotiltidae, and to a genus which contains about a dozen species,&nbsp;ranging from Canada (in summer) to Bolivia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A.

<p><span class="font1">RED WING, a city and the county seat of Goodhue county, Minnesota, U.S.A., on the W. bank of the Mississippi river,&nbsp;near the head of Lake Pepin, about 40 m. S.E. of St Paul. Pop.&nbsp;(1905,state census) 8149, 2138 being foreign-born; (1910) 9048.&nbsp;It is served by the Chicago Great Western and the Chicago,&nbsp;Milwaukee &amp; St Paul railways. Red Wing is the seat of the&nbsp;Lutheran Ladies’ Seminary (1894) and the Red Wing Theological&nbsp;Seminary (Lutheran, 1885), and in the vicinity is the State&nbsp;Training School for Boys and Girls, originally the Minnesota&nbsp;State Reform School. In the city are the Carnegie-Lawther&nbsp;library, a Federal building, a municipal theatre, the T. B.&nbsp;Sheldon Memorial Auditorium, in connexion with which is a&nbsp;School of Music, a Y.M.C.A. building, a City Hospital, St John’s&nbsp;Hospital (1902) and an old ladies’ home. Red Wing is an&nbsp;important wheat market and shipping point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1695 Le Sueur built a post on Prairie Island, in the Mis-sissippi, about 8 m. above the site of Red Wing, for the purpose, according to Charlevoix, of interposing a barrier between the&nbsp;warring Dakotas and Chippewas; and in 1727 René Boucher&nbsp;built on the shore of Lake Pepin a fort which, after various&nbsp;vicissitudes, was abandoned in 1753. An Indian village occu-pïed the site of Red Wing probably for many years before&nbsp;the arrival of the first whites, two Swiss missionaries, Samuel&nbsp;Denton and Daniel Gavin, who maintained a mission here in&nbsp;1837-46. In 1848 another mission was established by the&nbsp;American Board. Red Wing (named from an Indian chief)&nbsp;was platted in 1853 and was chartered as a city in 1857.</span></p>

This bird has its common English name@@<sup>1</sup> from the&nbsp;sides of its body, its inner wing-coverts and axillaries being of&nbsp;a bright reddish orange, of which colour, however, there is no&nbsp;appearance on the wing itself while the bird is at rest, and not&nbsp;much is ordinarily seen while it is in flight. In other respects&nbsp;it is very like a song-thrush, and indeed in France and some&nbsp;other countries it bears the name mauvis or mavis, often given&nbsp;to that species in some parts of Britain; but a conspicuous&nbsp;white streak over the eye at once affords a ready diagnosis.&nbsp;The redwing breeds in Iceland, in the subalpine and arctic&nbsp;districts of Norway, Sweden and Finland, and thence across&nbsp;Northern Russia and Siberia, becoming scarce to the eastward&nbsp;of the Yenisei, and not extending beyond Lake Baikal. In&nbsp;winter it visits the whole of Europe and North Africa, occa-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

Many writers have praised&nbsp;the song of this bird, comparing it with that of the nightingale&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> but herein they seem to have been as much mistaken&nbsp;as in older times was Linnaeus, who according to S. Nilsson&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Orn. Suecica,</span><span class="font1"> i. 177, note), failed to distinguish in life this&nbsp;species from its commoner congener </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">T. musicus.</span><span class="font1"> Its nest and&nbsp;eggs a good deal resemble those of the blackbird, and have none&nbsp;of the special characters which distinguish those of the song-thrush.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A.

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">REDWITZ, OSKAR, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Freiherr von (1823-1891), German poet, was born at Lichtenau, near Ansbach, on the 28th of&nbsp;June 1823. Having studied at the universities of Munich and&nbsp;Erlangen, he was apprenticed to the law in the Bavarian State&nbsp;service (1846-49). He next (1849-50) studied languages and&nbsp;literature at Bonn, and in 1851 was appointed professor of&nbsp;aesthetics and of the history of literature at Vienna. In 1852,&nbsp;however, he gave up this post and retired to his estate of&nbsp;Schellenberg, near Kaiserslautern. The pious sentimentality&nbsp;of his romantic epic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amaranth</span><span class="font1"> (1849; 42nd ed., 1898) had&nbsp;already gained him enthusiastic admirers, and this work was&nbsp;followed, in 1850, by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ein Märchen</span><span class="font1"> and by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gedichte</span><span class="font1"> (1852) and&nbsp;the tragedy </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sieglinde</span><span class="font1"> (1854). He next settled on his estates&nbsp;near Kronach, and here wrote the tragedy </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thomas Morus</span><span class="font1"> (1856),&nbsp;the historical dramas </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Philippine Welser</span><span class="font1"> (1859) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Der Zunftmeister von Nürnberg</span><span class="font1"> (1860), of which the first two met with great&nbsp;success. Elected member of the Bavarian Second Chamber for the&nbsp;district in which he lived, he removed to Munich in 1862. In&nbsp;1868 he published the novel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hermann Stark, deutsches Leben,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;in 1871 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Das Lied vom neuen deutschen Reich</span><span class="font1"> (which contains&nbsp;several hundred patriotic sonnets). In 1872 he took up his&nbsp;residence at Meran, but passed the last years of his life at a&nbsp;sanatorium for nervous disorders near Bayreuth, where he&nbsp;died on the 6th of July 1891.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REED, ANDREW (1787-1862), English nonconformist divine and philanthropist, was born in London on the 27th of&nbsp;November 1787. He entered Hackney Independent College&nbsp;in 1807 and was ordained minister of New Road Chapel in 1811.&nbsp;About 1830 he built the larger Wycliffe Chapel, where he&nbsp;remained until 1861. He visited America on a deputation to&nbsp;the Congregational Churches in 1834 and received the degree&nbsp;of D.D. from Yale. Reed’s name is permanently associated&nbsp;with a long list of philanthropic achievements, including the&nbsp;London Orphan Asylum, the Infant Orphan Asylum and the&nbsp;Reedham Orphanage, which he undertook on non-denomi-national lines because the governors of the other institutions&nbsp;had made the Anglican Catechism compulsory. Besides these&nbsp;he originated in 1847 an asylum for idiots at Highgate, afterwards moved to Earlswood in Surrey with a branch at Colchester, and in 1855 the Royal Hospital for Incurables at&nbsp;Putney. He died on the 25th of February 1862. Besides an&nbsp;account of his visit to America (2 vols., 1834), he compiled a&nbsp;hymn-book (1841), and published some sermons and books of&nbsp;devotion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His second son, Sir Charles Reed (1819-1881), was a successful typefounder and a keen supporter of popular education. As a common councillor of the city of London he developed&nbsp;the Guildhall Library of the City of London School. He was&nbsp;elected M.P. for Hackney (1868 and 1874) and for St Ives,&nbsp;Cornwall (1880), and served as chairman of the London School&nbsp;Board (1873-1881) in succession to Lord Lawrence. He was&nbsp;interested in antiquarian research and in philanthropic work,&nbsp;being an associate of George Peabody and an active worker&nbsp;in connexion with the Sunday School Union, the Bible Society,&nbsp;the Religious Tract Society and the London Missionary Society.&nbsp;His eldest son, Charles Edward Baines Reed (1845-1884) was</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> Many old writers assert that this bird used to be known in England as the “ swinepipe but, except in books, this name&nbsp;does not seem to survive to the present day. There is no reason,&nbsp;however, to doubt that it was once in vogue, and the only question&nbsp;is how it may have arisen. If it has not been corrupted from&nbsp;the German </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Weindrossel</span><span class="font0"> or some other similar name, it may refer&nbsp;to the soft inward whistle which the bird often utters, resembling&nbsp;the sound of the pipe used by the swineherds of old when collecting&nbsp;the animals under their charge. Another form of the word (which&nbsp;may, however, be erroneous) is “ windpipe.” “ Whindle ” and&nbsp;“ wheenerd ” have also been given as old English names of this&nbsp;bird (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Harl. Miscellany,</span><span class="font0"> 1st ed., ii. p. 558), and these may be referred&nbsp;to the local German </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Weindrustle</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wiηsel.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
