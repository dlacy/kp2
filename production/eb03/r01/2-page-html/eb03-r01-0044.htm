<p><span class="font2">RÂTIO, in arithmetic and geometry, is that relation of homogeneous things which determines the , quantity of one from the quantity of another, without&nbsp;the intervention of a third.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Two numbers, lines, or quantities, A and B, being propoſed, their relation one to another may be conſidered under one of tbeſe two heads : 1. How much A ex-ceeds B, or B exceeds A ?
