<p><span class="font1">as </span><span class="font0">between B and F, and between F and L, they are braces, and compressed. The ends of the posts were generally ornamented with knots of flowers, embossed globes,&nbsp;and the like, and the whole texture of the truss was exhibited and dressed out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This construction admits of employing very short timbers ; and this very circumstance gives greater strength to the truss, because the angle which the brace or tie makes&nbsp;with the rafter is more open. We may also perceive that&nbsp;all thrust may be taken off the walls. If the pieces AF,&nbsp;BF, LF, be removed, all the remaining diagonal pieces act&nbsp;as ties, and the pieces directed to the centre act as struts ;&nbsp;and it may also be observed, that the principle will apply&nbsp;equally to a straight or flat roof or to a floor. A floor such&nbsp;as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">abc,</span><span class="font0"> having the joint in two pieces </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ab, be,</span><span class="font0"> with a strut </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bd,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and two ties, will require a much greater weight to break&nbsp;it than if it had a continued joist </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ac</span><span class="font0"> of the same scantling.&nbsp;And, lastly, a piece of timber acting as a tie is much stronger&nbsp;than the same piece acting as a strut ; for in the latter situation it is exposed to bending, and when bent it is much&nbsp;less able to withstand a very great strain. It must be acknowledged, however, that this advantage is balanced by&nbsp;the great inferiority of the joints in point of strength. The&nbsp;joint of a tie depends wholly on the pins ; and for this reason&nbsp;they are never used in heavy works without strapping the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">joints with iron. In the roofs we are now describing the diagonal pieces of the middle part only act purely as ties,&nbsp;whilst those towards the sides act as struts or braces. Indeed they are seldom of so very simple construction as we&nbsp;have described, and are more generally constructed like the&nbsp;sketch in fig. 30, having two sets of rafters AB, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ab,</span><span class="font0"> and the&nbsp;angles are filled up with</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">thin planks, which give</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">great stiffness and strength.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They have also a double</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">set of purlins, which con</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">nect the different trusses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The roof being thus divid</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ed into squares, other pur</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lins run between the mid</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">dle points E of the rafters. The rafter is supported at E by a check put between it and the under rafter. The middle&nbsp;point of each square of the roof is supported and stiffened by four braces, one of which springs from e, and its&nbsp;opposite from thc similar part of the adjoining truss. The&nbsp;other two braces spring from the middle points of the lower&nbsp;purlins, which go horizontally from α and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> to the next truss,&nbsp;and are supported by planks in the same manner as the&nbsp;rafters. By this contrivance the whole becomes very stiff&nbsp;and strong.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b. b. b.)</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">ROOK. See Ornithology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROOKE, Sir George, a gallant naval commander, was bom of an ancient and honourable family in Kent in 1650.&nbsp;His merit raised him by regular steps to be vice-admiral of&nbsp;the blue, in which station he served in the battle of La&nbsp;Hogue, on the 22d of May 1692, when it was owing to his&nbsp;vigorous behaviour that the last stroke was given on that&nbsp;important day, which threw the French entirely into confusion. But the next day he obtained still more glory, for&nbsp;he had orders to go into La Hogue, and burn the enemy’s&nbsp;ships as they lay there. There were thirteen large men&nbsp;of war, which had crowded as far up as possible ; and the&nbsp;transports, tenders, and ammunition ships, were disposed&nbsp;in such a manner that it was thought impossible to burn&nbsp;them. Besides, the French camp was in sight, with all the&nbsp;French and Irish troops that were to have been employed in the invasion of England ; and several batteries were&nbsp;raised on the coast, which were well provided with heavy artillery. The vice-admiral made the necessary preparations&nbsp;for obeying his orders, but found it impossible to carry in&nbsp;the ships of his squadron. He therefore ordered his light&nbsp;frigates to ply in close to the shore ; and having manned&nbsp;all his boats, went himself to give directions for the attack,&nbsp;burned that very night six three-decked ships, and the&nbsp;next day six more, from seventy-six to sixty guns, together with most of the transports and ammunition vessels ;&nbsp;and this under the fire of all the batteries just mentioned,&nbsp;and in sight of all the French and Irish troops. Yet this&nbsp;bold action cost the lives of no more than ten men. The&nbsp;vice-admiral’s behaviour on this occasion appeared to King&nbsp;William so great, that having no opportunity at that time&nbsp;of promoting him, he settled a pension of L.1000 per annum on him for life ; and afterwards going to Portsmouth to&nbsp;view the fleet, went on board Admiral Rooke’s ship, dined&nbsp;with him, and then conferred on him the honour of knighthood, having a little before made him vice-admiral of the red.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In consequence of other services, he was in 1694 raised to the rank of admiral of the blue ; towards the close of&nbsp;the next year he became admiral of the white, and was also&nbsp;appointed admiral and commander in chief in the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During King William’s reign, Sir George was twice elected member for Portsmouth ; and upon tile accession&nbsp;of Queen Anne in 1702, he was constituted vice-admiral&nbsp;and lieutenant of the admiralty of England, as also lieutenant of the fleets and seas of this kingdom. Upon the declaration of war against France, he was ordered to command a fleet sent against Cadiz, the Duke of Ormond&nbsp;having the command of the land forces. On his passage&nbsp;home, having received an account that the galleons, under&nbsp;the escort of a strong French squadron, had got into the&nbsp;harbour of Vigo, he resolved to attack them ; and on the&nbsp;11th of October he came before the harbour of Rondon-dello, where the French commander had neglected nothing&nbsp;necessary for putting the place in the best posture of defence. But notwithstanding this, a detachment of fifteen&nbsp;English and ten Dutch men of war, of the line of battle,&nbsp;with all the fire-ships, were ordered in ; the frigates and&nbsp;bomb-vessels followed ; the great ships moved after them,&nbsp;and the army landed near Rondondello. The whole service was performed under Sir George’s directions, with admirable conduct and bravery ; for all the ships were destroyed or taken, prodigious damage was done to the enemy,&nbsp;and vast wealth was acquired by the allies. For this action&nbsp;Sir George received the thanks of the House of Commons,&nbsp;a day of thanksgiving was appointed both by the queen and&nbsp;the states-general, and Sir George was appointed to a seat&nbsp;in the privy-council. Yet notwithstanding this, the House&nbsp;of Lords resolved to inquire into his conduct at Cadiz. But&nbsp;he so fully justified himself, that a vote was passed approving his behaviour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the spring of the year 1704, Sir George commanded the ships of war which conveyed King Charles III. of Spain&nbsp;to Lisbon. In July he attacked Gibraltar, when, by the&nbsp;bravery of the English seamen, the place was taken on the&nbsp;24th, though the town was extremely strong, well furnished with ammunition, and had a hundred guns mounted, all&nbsp;facing the sea and the narrow passes to the land ; an action&nbsp;which was conceived and executed in less than a week,&nbsp;though it has since endured sieges of many months’ continuance, and more than once baffled the united forces of&nbsp;France and Spain. This brave officer being at last obliged,&nbsp;by the prevalence of party spirit, to quit the service of his&nbsp;country, retired to his seat in Kent, where he spent the remainder of his days as a private gentleman. He was thrice&nbsp;married ; and by his second lady, Mrs Luttrel, left one son.</span></p>
