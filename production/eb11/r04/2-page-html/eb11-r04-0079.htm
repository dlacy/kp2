<p><span class="font4">fig-tree and the statue of Marsyas are repeated. Other explanations of these reliefs have been given, but the above appears the most&nbsp;probable. Towards the other end of the Forum are remains of a&nbsp;large concrete pedestal. It may possibly have supported an&nbsp;equestrian statue of Constantine, wnich was still standing in the&nbsp;8th century. A smaller foundation, laid bare by Comm. Boni’s&nbsp;excavations in 1905, is thought by him to have supported the&nbsp;equestrian statue of Q. Marcius Tremulus, the conqueror of the&nbsp;Hcrnici, set up before the temple of Castor in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font4"> 305 (Liv. ix. 43).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">t </span><span class="font4">The seven cubical brick and concrete structures, once faced with&nbsp;marble, which line the Sacra Via are not earlier than the time of&nbsp;Diocletian. They are probably the pedestals of honorary columns&nbsp;such as those shown in the relief on Constantine’s arch, mentioned&nbsp;above. The column erected in honour of the tyrant Phocas by&nbsp;Smaragdus in the eleventh year of his exarchate (608) is still stanching. It is a fine marble Corinthian column, stolen from some earlier&nbsp;building; it stands on rude steps of marble and tufa. The name&nbsp;of Phocas is erased from the inscription; but the date shows that&nbsp;this monument was to his honour. In the 4th century, or perhaps&nbsp;even later, a long brick and concrete building faced with marble was&nbsp;built along the whole south-east end of the Forum, probably a row&nbsp;of shops. They were destroyed by Comm. Rosa’s order. Two&nbsp;columns—one of pavonazzetto, the other of grey granite—were set&nbsp;up on two of the brick bases in 1899.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1902 a network of passages </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(cuniculi)</span><span class="font4"> was discovered about 3 ft. beneath the pavement of the Forum. These have tufa walls&nbsp;and concrete vaults; they are about 8 ft. high and 5 ft. broad. At&nbsp;the intersections of the passages arc square chambers, in the centre&nbsp;of which are travertine blocks with sockets for windlasses. The&nbsp;construction of the passages seems to date from the time of Julius&nbsp;Caesar, and it is thought that they were used for scenic purposes&nbsp;when games were given in the Forum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In 1903 a large concrete foundation was found, partly blocking the E. end of one of the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">cuniculi.</span><span class="font4"> There can be no doubt that this once&nbsp;supported the colossal equestrian statue of Domitian described by&nbsp;Statius (Silv. i. 1, 21 ff.) which was destroyed after his murder.&nbsp;Embedded in the concrete was a cist.of massive travertine blocks&nbsp;which was found to contain five archaic vases similar to those from&nbsp;the early necropolis (above, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">as init.).</span><span class="font4"> One held a nugget of quartz&nbsp;containing pure gold. . It is uncertain whether these were buried here&nbsp;for ritual purposes or were the contents of an early tomb found in&nbsp;digging the foundations. Near.this monument there were found in&nbsp;1904 remains of an enclosure of irregular shape which once contained&nbsp;an altar. This must have been the altar which in imperial times&nbsp;represented the Lacus Curtius (Ov. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fast.</span><span class="font4"> vi. 403). Beside this were&nbsp;found some remains of a structure of imperial date which Comm.&nbsp;Boni identified with the Tribunal at which justice was administered&nbsp;by the emperors.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Palatine Hill or Palatium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In addition to the early walls described above, only a few remains now exist earlier in date than the later years of the republic; these are mostly grouped near the Scalae Caci (see fig. 10, in&nbsp;Plan), and consist of small cellae and other structures of unknown&nbsp;use.@@<sup>2</sup> They are partly built of the soft tufa used in the “ wall&nbsp;of Romulus/’ and partly of hard granulated tufa so called.&nbsp;Various names, such as the “ hut of Faustulus ” and the “ Augur-atorium/’ have been given to these very ancient remains, but&nbsp;with little reason. On thing is certain, that the buildings were&nbsp;respected and preserved even under the empire, and were probably regarded as sacred relics of the earliest times.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font4">Remains of more than one temple of the republican period exist near this west angle of the Palatine. The larger of these (see Plan)&nbsp;has been called conjccturally the temple of Jupiter Victor&nbsp;(Liv. x. 29; Ov. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Fast.</span><span class="font4"> iv. 621)<sup>@@3</sup> It stands on a levelled&nbsp;platform of tufa rock, the lower part of which is excavated&nbsp;into quarry chambers, used in later times as w-atcr&nbsp;reservoirs. Two ancient well-shafts lined with tufa communicate&nbsp;with these subterranean hollows. Extensive foundations of hard&nbsp;tufa exist in the valley afterwards covered by the Flavian palace (see&nbsp;Plan, “ Foundations of the Domus Augustana ”). The masonry is in&nbsp;parts of republican date, and was used to support the Flavian&nbsp;palace. Not far from the top of the Scalae Caci are the massive&nbsp;remains of a large cclla, nothing of which now exists except the&nbsp;concrete core faced with </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">of&gt;us incertum</span><span class="font4"> in alternate layers of tufa&nbsp;and peperino. It was probably once lined with marble. By it a&nbsp;noble colossal seated figure of a goddess was found, in&nbsp;Greek marble, well modelled, a w'ork of the 1st century&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font4"> The head and arms are missing, but the figure is&nbsp;probably rightly called a statue of Cybele; and inscriptions dedicated to Magna Mater have been found close to the temple.&nbsp;Augustus in the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Monumentum Ancyranum</span><span class="font4"> (4, 8) records </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">aedlm .&nbsp;matris.magnae.in.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> PALATIO.FECI</span><span class="font4">5 and there can be little&nbsp;doubt that this is the temple in question. Some interesting early&nbsp;architectural fragments are lying near this temple; they consist of&nbsp;drums and capitals of Corinthian columns, and part of the cornice&nbsp;of the pediment, cut in peperino, and thickly coated with hard white&nbsp;stucco to imitate marble. Between this and the temple of Jupiter&nbsp;Victor are extensive remains of a large porticus, with tufa walls and&nbsp;travertine piers, also republican in date. The use and name of this&nbsp;building.are unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Remains of extensive lines of buildings in early </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticulatum </span><span class="font4">exist on the upper slopes of. the Palatine, all along the Velabrum&nbsp;side, and on the south-w'est side as far as the so-called Paedagogium.&nbsp;These buildings are constructed on the ruins of the wall of Romulus,&nbsp;a great part of which has been cut away to make room for them;&nbsp;their base is at the foot of the ancient wall, on the shelf cut midway&nbsp;in the side of the hill; their top reached originally above the upper&nbsp;level of the summit. They are of various dates, and cannot be&nbsp;identified with any known buildings. Part is apparently of&nbsp;the time of the emperor Tiberius, and no doubt belongs to&nbsp;the Domus Tiberiana mentioned by Suetonius </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Tib.</span><span class="font4"> 5; Tac.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Hist.</span><span class="font4"> i. 27, iii. 71); this palace covered a great part of the west corner of the hill. Of about the same date is a very interesting&nbsp;and well-preserved private house built wholly of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">opus&nbsp;reticulatum,</span><span class="font4"> which formed part of the imperial property,&nbsp;and was respected when the later palaces were built. The&nbsp;discovery of lead-pipes bearing the inscription </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ivliae</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> . AVG </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(C.I.L.&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">xv. 7264) has led to the conjecture that the house was that bequeathed&nbsp;to Li via by her first husband, Tib. Claudius Nero. At the north-west&nbsp;end is a small atrium, out of which open three rooms commonly called&nbsp;the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">tablinum</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">alae,</span><span class="font4"> as well as a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">triclinium,</span><span class="font4"> all decorated with good&nbsp;paintings of mythological and domestic scenes, probably the work&nbsp;of Greek artists, as inscriptions in Greek occur, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font3"> EPMKC, </span><span class="font4">under&nbsp;the figure of Hermes, in a picture representing his deliverance of Io&nbsp;from Argus.@@<sup>4</sup> This suite of rooms was a later addition to the house.&nbsp;The south-east portion was three storeys high, and is divided into&nbsp;a great number of very small rooms, mostly bedrooms. The house is&nbsp;built in a sort .of hole against the side of an elevation, so that the&nbsp;upper floor behind is level with an ancient paved road.. The dampness&nbsp;caused by this is counteracted and kept off the paintings by a lining&nbsp;of flange-tiles over the external walls, under the stucco, thus forming&nbsp;an air-cavity all over the surface. From the back of the house, at&nbsp;the upper level, along subterranean passage leads towards the Flavian&nbsp;palace, and then, turning at right angles and passing by the foundations of the so-called temple of Jupiter Victor, issues, in the ancient&nbsp;tufa building mentioned above. Another crypto-porticus starts near&nbsp;this house and communicates with the long semi-subterranean passage&nbsp;by which the palaces of Caligula and Domitian are connected. It is&nbsp;ornamented with very beautiful stucco reliefs of cupids, beasts and&nbsp;foliage, once painted and gilt. Some hold that the house was that&nbsp;of Germanicus, into which the soldiers who killed Caligula in the long&nbsp;crypto-porticus escaped, as described by Josephus </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Ant. Jud.</span><span class="font4"> xix. 1;&nbsp;see also Suet. </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Cal.</span><span class="font4"> 58).</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">From the Summa Sacra Via a road led to the Area Palatina in the centre of the hill. Here was. the sanctuary, called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Roma quadrata,&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">containing the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">mundus,</span><span class="font4"> a pit in which the instruments&nbsp;used in the founding of the city were deposited. To the&nbsp;east was the Area Apollinis, the entrance of which led&nbsp;through lofty propylaea into a very extensive peristyle&nbsp;or porticus, with columns of Numidian giallo; the temple&nbsp;was of white Luna marble. In the centre of this enclosure stood&nbsp;the great octostyle peripteral temple of Apollo Palatinus. The&nbsp;splendour of its architecture and the countless works of art in gold,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font4"><sup>@@@1</sup> Authorities on the Forum; For the earlier literature of the subject it will suffice to refer to Jordan, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Topographie der Stadt Rom,&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">i. 2, 195-429, and, in English, to Nichols, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">The Roman Forum&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">(1877).
