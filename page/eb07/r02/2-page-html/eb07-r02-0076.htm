<p><span class="font0">of ideal and impossible perfection, that those who emulated such renown were usually contented to stop far short of the&nbsp;mark. The most adventurous and unshaken valour, a mind&nbsp;capable of the highest flights of romantic generosity, a heart&nbsp;which was devoted to the will of some fair idol, on whom&nbsp;his deeds were to reflect glory, and whose love was to reward all his toils ; these were attributes which all aspired&nbsp;to exhibit who sought to rank high in ,the annals of chivalry ; and such were the virtues which the minstrels celebrated. But, like the temper of a tamed lion, the fierce&nbsp;and dissolute spirit of the age often shewed itself through&nbsp;the fair varnish of this artificial system of manners. The&nbsp;valour of the hero was often stained by acts of cruelty, or&nbsp;freaks of rash desperation ; his courtesy and munificence&nbsp;became solemn foppery and wild profusion ; his love to his&nbsp;lady often demanded and received a requital inconsistent&nbsp;with the honour of the object ; and those who affected to&nbsp;found their attachment on the purest and most delicate&nbsp;metaphysical principles, carried on their actual intercourse&nbsp;with a license altogether inconsistent with their sublime&nbsp;pretensions. Such were the real manners of the middle&nbsp;ages, and we find them so depicted in these ancient legends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So high was the national excitation in consequence of the romantic atmosphere in which they seemed to breathe,&nbsp;that the knights and squires of the fourteenth and fifteenth&nbsp;centuries imitated the wildest and most extravagant emprises of the heroes of romance ; and, like them, took on&nbsp;themselves the most extraordinary adventures to shew their&nbsp;own gallantry, and do most honour to the ladies of their&nbsp;hearts. The females of rank, erected into a species of goddesses in public, and often degraded as much below their&nbsp;proper dignity in more private intercourse, equalled in their&nbsp;extravagances the youth of the other sex. A singular&nbsp;picture is given by Knyghton of the damsels-errant who&nbsp;attended upon the solemn festivals of chivalry, in quest, it&nbsp;may reasonably be supposed, of such adventures as are very&nbsp;likely to be met with by such females as think proper to&nbsp;seek them. “ These tournaments are attended by many&nbsp;ladies of the first rank and greatest beauty, but not always&nbsp;of the most untainted reputation. These ladies are dressed&nbsp;in party-coloured tunics, one-half of one colour and the&nbsp;other half of another ; their lirripipes, or tippets, are very&nbsp;short ; their caps remarkably little, and wrapt about their&nbsp;heads with cords ; their girdles and pouches are ornamented&nbsp;with gold and silver ; and they wear short swords, called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">daggers,</span><span class="font0"> before them, a little below their navels ; they are&nbsp;mounted on the finest horses, with the richest furniture.&nbsp;Thus equipped, they ride from place to place in quest of&nbsp;tournaments, by which they dissipate their fortunes, and&nbsp;sometimes ruin their reputation.”—(Knyghton, quoted in&nbsp;Henry’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History,</span><span class="font0"> vol. viii. p. 402.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The minstrels, or those who aided them in the composition of the romances, which it was their profession to recite, roused to rivalry by the unceasing demand for their compositions, endeavoured emulously to render them more&nbsp;attractive by subjects of new’ and varied interest, or by marvellous incidents which their predecessors were strangers to.&nbsp;Much labour has been bestowed, somewhat unprofitably, in&nbsp;endeavouring to ascertain the sources from which they drew&nbsp;the embellishments of their tales, when the hearers began&nbsp;to be tired of the unvaried recital of battle and tournament&nbsp;which had satisfied the simplicity of a former age. Percy&nbsp;has contended for the northern </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sagas</span><span class="font0"> as the unquestionable&nbsp;origin of the romance of the middle ages. Warton conceived that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oriental fables,</span><span class="font0"> borrowed by those minstrels&nbsp;who visited Spain, or who in great numbers attended the&nbsp;crusades, gave the principal distinctive colouring to those&nbsp;remarkable compositions ; and a later system, patronised by&nbsp;later authors, has derived them, in a great measure, from&nbsp;the fragments of classical superstition, which continued to be&nbsp;preserved after the fall of the Roman empire. All those&nbsp;systems seem to be inaccurate, in so far as they have been&nbsp;adopted, exclusively of each other, and of the general proposition, that fables of a nature similar to the romances of&nbsp;chilvalry, modified according to manners and state of society, must necessarily be invented in every part of the&nbsp;world, for the same reason that grass grows upon the surface of the soil in every climate and in every country. “ In&nbsp;reality,” says Mr. Southey, who has treated this subject with&nbsp;his usual ability, “ mythological and romantic tales are current among all savages of whom we have any full account ;&nbsp;for man has his intellectual as well as his bodily appetites,&nbsp;and these things are the food of his imagination and faith.&nbsp;They are found wherever there is language and discourse&nbsp;of reason ; in other words, wherever there is man. And in&nbsp;similar stages of civilization, or states of society, the fictions&nbsp;of different people will bear a corresponding resemblance,&nbsp;notwithstanding the difference of time and scene.”@@<sup>l</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To this it may be added, that the usual appearances and productions of nature offer to the fancy, in every part of the&nbsp;world, the same means of diversifying fictitious narrative by&nbsp;the introduction of prodigies. If in any romance we encounter the description of an elephant, we may reasonably&nbsp;conclude that a phenomenon, unknown in Europe, must&nbsp;have been borrowed from the east ; but whosoever has seen&nbsp;a serpent and a bird, may easily aggravate the terrors of the&nbsp;former by conferring on a fictitious monster the wings of the&nbsp;latter; and whoever has seen or heard of a wolf, or lion, and&nbsp;an eagle, may, by a similar exertion of invention, imagine a&nbsp;griffin or hippogriff. It is imputing great poverty to the&nbsp;human imagination, to suppose that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">speciosa miracula,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which are found to exist in different parts of the world, must&nbsp;necessarily be derived from some common source; and perhaps we should not err more grossly in supposing that the&nbsp;various kinds of boats, skiffs, and rafts, upon which men have&nbsp;dared the ocean on so many various shores, have been all&nbsp;originally derived from the vessel of the Argonauts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the other hand, there are various romantic incidents and inventions of a nature so peculiar, that we may boldly,&nbsp;and at once, refer them to some particular and special origin. The tale of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Flora and Blanchefleur,</span><span class="font0"> for example,&nbsp;could only be invented in the east, where the scene is laid,&nbsp;and the manners of which are observed with some accuracy.&nbsp;That of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orflο</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heurodis,</span><span class="font0"> on the contrary, is the classical history of Orpheus and Eurydice, with the Gothic machinery of the elves or fairies, substituted for the infernal&nbsp;regions. But notwithstanding these and many other instances in which the subjects or leading incidents of romance can be distinctly traced to British or Armorican traditions, to the tales and history of classic antiquity, to the&nbsp;wild fables and rich imagery of Arabia, or to those darker&nbsp;and sterner themes which were first treated of by the Skalds&nbsp;of the north, it would be assuming greatly too much upon&nbsp;such grounds to ascribe the derivation of romantic fiction,&nbsp;exclusively to any one of these sources. In fact, the foundation of these fables lies deep in human nature, and the&nbsp;superstructures have been imitated from various authorities&nbsp;by those who, living by the pleasure which their lays of chivalry afforded to their audience, were especially anxious to&nbsp;recommend them by novelty of every kind ; and were undoubtedly highly gratified when the report of travellers, or&nbsp;pilgrims, or perhaps their own intercourse with minstrels of&nbsp;other nations, enabled them to vary their usual narrations&nbsp;with circumstances yet unheard in bower and hall. Romance,&nbsp;therefore, was like a compound metal, derived from various&nbsp;mines, and in the different specimens of which, one metal or&nbsp;other was alternately predominant; and viewed in this light,&nbsp;the ingenious theories of those learned antiquaries, who have</span></p><div>
