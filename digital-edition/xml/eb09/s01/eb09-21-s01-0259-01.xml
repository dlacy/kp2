Built on an exhausted part of old goldfields of Bendigo (1851), and long better known by that name, Sandhurst, which became a municipality in 1855, a borough in 1863, and a city in 1871, has been gradually working itself clear of the irregularity and disorder characteristic of abandoned mines and quartz-crushing enterprises. Pall Mall, the principal street, consists of good houses of two and three stories ; and, besides banks, insurance offices, hotels, and churches (many of which are substantial buildings), there are in Sandhurst Government and municipal offices, a hospital, a benevolent asylum, a mechanics’ institute and school of mines, a theatre, and several halls. Rosalind Park, opposite Pall Mall, the Camp Reserve, and the Botanical Gardens are the principal pleasure grounds. A good supply of water has been secured by the construction of five large reservoirs capable of storing in the aggregate upwards of 622,600,000 gallons. Besides gold-mining, which in the Sandhurst district employs 6800 miners, the local industries are brewing, iron-casting, coach-building, the working of bricks and tiles and earthenware, and tanning. The population of the city (which is divided into three wards —Sutton, Darling, and Barkly) was 28,662 in 1881. The value of rateable property is £1,663,910.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
