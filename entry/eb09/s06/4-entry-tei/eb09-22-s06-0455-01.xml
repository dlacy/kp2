<hi rend="smallcaps">Edwin M'Masters</hi> (1833-1869), American statesman, was born in Ohio, December 19, 1814, graduated . at Kenyon College in 1833, and was admitted to the bar of his native State. Just at the end of Buchananâ€™s administration in 1860-61, Stanton was called upon to act as attorney-general. In 1862, after the inauguration of Lincoln, the new president, who had had great difficulties with his war office, placed Stanton at its head, where he was at home at last. His intense vigour, excellent organizing powers, and scrupulous honesty were the life of the Federal war department throughout the Civil War ; and it may be worth while to note that, after living through boundless opportunities of peculation, he died, like most of the public servants of the United States, a poor man. In spite of his many services to the country, it was not always easy for his associates to get on with him comfortably ; and his quarrels with President Johnson were especially bitter in 1867-68, ending in the impeachment of Johnson by the House of Representatives. On the acquittal of the president Stanton resigned, and resumed the practice of law. President Grant, in 1869, made him a justice of the supreme court ; but his work during the</p><p>war had worn him out, and he died December 24, 1869.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
