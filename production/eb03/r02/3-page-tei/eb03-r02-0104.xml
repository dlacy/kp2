This elegant prelate was the Grecian Fene-lon @@(a). Beautiful as theſe compoſitions are when the imagination of the writer is ſufficiently ſtored with accurate obſervations on human nature, in their birth, like many of the fine arts, they found in the zealots of religion men who oppoſed their progreſs. However Heliodorus may have delighted thoſe who were not in-ſenſible to the felicities of a fine imagination, and to the enchanting elegancies of ſtyle, he raiſed himſelf, among his brother eccleſiaſtics, enemies; who at length ſo far prevailed, that it was declared by a ſynod, that his performance was dangerous to young perſons, and that if the author did not ſuppreſs it, he muſt reſign his biſhoprick. We are told he preferred his romance to his biſhoprick. Even ſo late as in Racine’s time, it was held a crime to peruſe theſe unhallowed pages. He informs us, that the firſt effuſions of his muſe were in conſequence of ſtudying that ancient romance, which his maſter obſerving him to devour with the keenneſs of a famiſhed man, he ſnatched it from his hands and flung it in the fire; a ſecond copy experienced the ſame fate. What could Racine do? He bought a third, and took the precaution of devouring it ſecretly till he got it by heart; after which he offered it to his maſter with a ſmile to burn, if he choſe, like the others.</p><p>The deciſion of theſe bigots was founded in their opinion of the immorality of ſuch works. They alleged, that the writers paint too warmly to the imagination, addreſs themſelves too forcibly to the paſſions; and in general, by the freedom of their repreſentations, hover on the borders of indecency. This cenſure is certainly well-founded. Many of the old romances, and even of the dramas, acted in Scotland two centuries ago, are ſuch as common proſtitutes would in this age think indecent. But we are at preſent concerned with the origin of romance.</p><p>“ The learned Fleury thinks that they were not known till the 12th century, and gives as their original the hiſtory of the dukes of Normandy. Verdier, whoſe opinion is of no great weight, ſays the invention of romance was owing to the Normans of France; and that theſe fictions being originally written in the old Norman language, they were intitled <hi rend="italic">Normances;</hi>  the name was afterwards altered to that of <hi rend="italic">Romances.</hi>  The Spaniards, who borrowed them from the French, called them <hi rend="italic">Romanzes,</hi>  which alſo did the Italians.</p><p>“ Dom Rivet, one of the learned aſſociates of the con</p><lb/><p>gregation of St Maur, authors of the Literary Hiſtory of France, fixes their origin in the 10th century. He ſays, that the moſt ancient romance known was one which appeared in the middle of that century, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Philomena,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">the Beloved.</hi>  This romance contains the pretended exploits of Charlemagne before Narbonne. At Toulouſe, he tells us, they have pre-ſerved a copy of the Philomena in its original language; that is to ſay, the Romaunt or poliſhed; ſuch as was then ſpoken at court. They preferred this language to the Latin, which was then that of the. common people, but vitiated with their corruptions.</p><p>“ So far have we travelled on the road of conjecture: we ſhall now turn into the path of fact. It is certain that theſe compoſitions derive their name from the language in which they were firſt written. Abbé Iraild has given us the character of the earlieſt romances, which we ſhall tranſcribe; for to add to what is well ex-preſſed, however it may pleaſe the vanity of a writer, ſeldom tends to the gratification of the reader.</p><p>‘ The firſt romances were a monſtrous aſſemblage of hiſtories, in which truth and fiction were equally blended, but all without probability; a compoſition of amorous adventures, and all the extravagant ideas of chivalry. The incidents are infinitely multiplied; deſti-tute of connection, of order, and art. Theſe are the ancient and miſerable romances which Cervantes, in his celebrated ſatirical romance of Don Quixote, has covered with an eternal ridicule. '</p><p>“ It is, however, from theſe productions rather in their improved ſtate, that poets of all nations have drawn their richeſt inventions. The agreeable wildneſs of that fancy which characteriſed the eaſtern nations was caught by. the cruſaders. When they returned home, they mingled in their own the cuſtoms of each country. The Saracens, who were men like themſelves, becauſe they were of another religion, and were therefore- their enemies, were pictured under the tremendous form of <hi rend="italic">Pay-dim Giants.</hi>  The credulous reader of that day followed with trembling anxiety the <hi rend="italic">Red-croſs Knight.</hi>  It was thus that fiction embelliſhed religion, and religion invigorated fiction. Such incidents have enlivened the cantos of Arioſto, and adorned the epic of Taffo. Spenſer is the child of their creation; and it is certain that we are indebted to them for ſome of the bold and ſtrong touches of Milton. ”</p><p>Other circumſtances however have been aſſigned as the ſources of theſe extravagant fictions. “ Caſtles were, erected to repulſe the vagrant attacks of the Normans; and in France (from the year 768 to 987) theſe places became fatal to the public repoſe. The petty deſpots who raiſed theſe caſtles, pillaged whoever paſſed, and carried off the females who pleaſed them. Rapine, of every kind, was the privilege of Lords! Mezeray ob-ſerves, that it is from theſe circumſtances romancers</p><lb/><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a) An ingenious and learned friend inquires,</hi><hi rend="sup">,</hi>  Is not the romance of the Golden Aſs, by Apuleius, to be conſidered. as an earlier ſpecimen than that of Heliodorus? ’ To thisour author has no objection; but he would not warrant <hi rend="italic">any</hi>  romance to be the <hi rend="italic">firſt</hi>  that ever was written. It is thus that ſome writers, more learned than ſagacious, have diſcovered the firſt inventor of epiſtolary correſpondence. A lady receives this honour: ſuch learning is deſperate! From the Aſiatic Reſearches and other publications on Oriental literature, we are led to believe, that the native country of romance is the eaſt;where it ſeems to have flouriſhed in all its extravagant grandeur from time immemorial,</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
