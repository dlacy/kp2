<p><span class="font0">dilatatores naris. In some people this movement is hardly perceptible unless breathing be heavy or laboured. As&nbsp;the air passes at the back of the throat behind the soft&nbsp;palate it causes the velum to wave very gently in the&nbsp;current ; this is a purely passive movement. If we look&nbsp;at the glottis or opening into the larynx during respiration, as we may readily do with the help of a small mirror&nbsp;held at the back of the throat, we may notice that the&nbsp;glottis is wide open during inspiration and that it becomes&nbsp;narrower by the approximation of the vocal chords during&nbsp;expiration. This alteration is produced by the action of&nbsp;the laryngeal muscles. Like the movements of the nostril,&nbsp;those of the larynx are almost imperceptible in some&nbsp;people during ordinary breathing, but are very well marked&nbsp;in all during forced respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Mechanics of Respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the description of the anatomy of the thorax it has</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">been shown that the thorax is practically a closed box entirely filled by the lungs, heart, and other structures&nbsp;contained within it. If we were to freeze a dead body&nbsp;until all its tissues were rigid, and then were to remove a&nbsp;portion of the chest wall, we should observe that every&nbsp;corner of the thorax is accurately filled by some portion&nbsp;or other of its contents. If we were to perform the same&nbsp;operation of removing a part of the chest wall in a body&nbsp;not first frozen we should find, on the other hand, that&nbsp;the contents of the thorax are not by any means in such&nbsp;circumstances bulky enough to fill up the space provided&nbsp;for them. If we were to measure the organs carefully we&nbsp;should find that those which are hollow and whose cavities&nbsp;communicate with the regions outside the thorax are all&nbsp;larger in the frozen corpse than in that which was not&nbsp;frozen. In other words, the organs in the thorax are&nbsp;distended somewhat in order that they may completely&nbsp;fill the chest cavity ; and the nature of this curious and&nbsp;important condition may best be illustrated by the simple&nbsp;diagrams, figs. 3 and 4 (from Hermann’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Physiologie des</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Menschen),—</span><span class="font0">where </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font0"> is the trachea, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font0"> the lung, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">υ</span><span class="font0"> the auricle of the heart, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">k</span><span class="font0"> the ventricle, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font0"> an intercostal space with its&nbsp;flexible membranous covering. When the interior of the&nbsp;vessel is rendered vacuous by exhaustion through the tube&nbsp;o, the walls of the lungs and heart are expanded until&nbsp;the limits of the containing vessel are accurately filled,&nbsp;while all flexible portions of the walls of the vessel (corresponding to the intercostal membranes and the diaphragm&nbsp;of the thorax) are sucked inwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this description it follows that the lungs, even when the thorax is most contracted, are constantly overdistended, and that, when the cause of this over-distension&nbsp;is removed, the lungs, being elastic, collapse. It further&nbsp;follows that if the thorax is dilated, the flexible hollow&nbsp;organs it contains must perforce be still more distended,&nbsp;—a distension which in the case of the lungs is followed by&nbsp;an indrawing of air through the trachea in all cases where&nbsp;the trachea is open. Thus, as the act of respiration is&nbsp;primarily a dilatation of the thorax, the part played by&nbsp;the lungs is, as Galen knew, a purely passive one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How is dilatation of the thorax effected ? It has been pointed out that the rib-planes decline from the horizontal&nbsp;in two directions, viz., from behind forwards, and from&nbsp;the antero-posterior mesial plane outwards ; a glance at&nbsp;fig. 5 will make this double sloping clear to the reader.&nbsp;It has, moreover, been explained that the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">diaphragm arches upwards into the thorax in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">such a manner that the lateral parts of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">arch are vertical and in contact</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">with the inner face of the tho</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">racic -walls (see fig. 2). This</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">being the structure of the thorax,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the enlargement of its</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">cavity is brought about</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) by raising the rib-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">planes until they ap</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">proach the horizontal,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and (2) by depressing</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the diaphragm and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">making its rounded</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">dome more cone-like in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">outline. A moment’s</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">consideration will show</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">how these actions en</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">large the boundaries</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the thorax. (ct)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the postero-an-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">terior slope of the rib-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">planes is diminished</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">by the raising of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">anterior ends of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ribs, the whole ster</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">num is thrust upwards and forwards, and the anteroposterior diameter of the thorax is increased, (Z&gt;) When the lateral slope of the rib-planes is diminished by the&nbsp;ribs being moved upwards about an axis passing through&nbsp;their sternal and vertebral extremities, it is evident that&nbsp;the lateral diameter of the thorax must be increased, (c)&nbsp;When the muscular portion of the diaphragm contracts,&nbsp;the curves of its dome-like shape are straightened, the&nbsp;whole diaphragm comes to look more conical on section,&nbsp;and the apposition of its lateral parts to the inner surface&nbsp;of the thorax is destroyed ; the two apposed surfaces are&nbsp;drawn apart much as the leaves of a book might be, and&nbsp;a space is formed between them, into which some portion&nbsp;of the lung slips, (c?) When the diaphragm descends it&nbsp;draws with it the whole contents of the thorax; inasmuch&nbsp;as the contents as a whole are conical in shape with the&nbsp;apex upward and are fitted into the conical space of the&nbsp;thoracic cavity, it is clear that the descent of the contents&nbsp;will tend to create a space between them and the thoracic&nbsp;walls ; for each stratum of lung, &amp;c., which is adapted to&nbsp;fit a certain level of thorax, will thereby be brought into a&nbsp;lower and (as the thorax is conical) a more spacious level.&nbsp;Hence the descent of the diaphragm causes a much greater&nbsp;enlargement of the thorax than is measured by the mere&nbsp;elongation of the vertical diameter. In this manner the&nbsp;thorax is distended and air is drawn into the lungs. The&nbsp;contraction of the thorax in expiration is brought about&nbsp;by the return of the ribs and diaphragm to their original&nbsp;position of rest.</span></p>
