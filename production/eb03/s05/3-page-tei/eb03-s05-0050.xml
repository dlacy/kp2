Dr Felton ſays, “ The late dean of Canterbury is excellent in the whole. His thoughts and reaſoning are bright and ſolid. His ſtyle is juſt, both for the purity of the language and for the ſtrength and beauty of expreſſion ; but the periods are formed in ſo peculiar an order of the words, that it was an obſervation, nobody could pronounce them with the ſame grace and advantage as himſelf·.” His writings, which are an ineſtimable treaſure of piety and devotion are, A Paraphrale and Comment upon the Epiſtles and Goſpels, 4 vols, 1705, 8vo. Sermons at Boyle’s Lectures, 1706, 4t0. Fifteen Sermons, 1700, 8vo. Twelve Sermons on ſeveral Occaſions, 1727, 8vo. Thomas à Kempis 1696, 8vo. Epictetus's Morals, with Simplicius’s Comment, and the Life of Epictetus, 1700, 8vo. Parſon’s Chriſtian Directory, 1716, 8vo. Rochefoucault’s Maxims, 1706, 8vo. A Funeral Sermon on Mr Richard Save bookſeller, 1724 ; two editions 4to. Twenty Sermons, publiſhed ſingly between the years 1692 and 1724. Private Prayers for every Day in the Week, and for the ſeveral Parts of each Day ; tranſlated from the Greek Devotions of Biſhop Andrews, with Additions, 1730. In his tranſlations, it is well known, Dr Stanhope did not confine himſelf to a ſtrict and literal verſion : he took the liberty of paraphraſing, explaining, and improving upon his author ; as will evidently appear (not to mention any other work) by the ſlighteſt peruſal of St Auguſtine’s Meditations, and the Devotions of Biſhop Andrews.</p><p>STANISLAUS (Leczinſki), king of Poland, was born at Leopold the 20th of Octocter 1677. His father was a poliſh nobleman, diſtinguiſhed by his rank and the important offices which he held, but ſtill more by his firmneſs and courage. Staniſlaus was ſent ambaſſador in 1704 by the aſſembly of Warſaw to Charles XII. of Sweden, who had conquered Poland. He was at that time 27 years old, was general of great Poland, and had been ambaſſador extraordinary to the Grand Signior in 1699. Charles was ſo delighted with the frankneſs and ſincerity of his deportment, and with the firmneſs and ſweetneſs which appeared in his countenance, that he offered him the crown of Poland, and ordered him to be crowned at Warſaw in 1705. He accompanied Charles XII. into Saxony, where a treaty was concluded with King Auguſtus in 1705, by which that prince reſigned the crown, and acknowledged Staniſlaus king of Poland. The new monarch remained in Saxony with Charles till 1707, when they returned into Poland and attacked the Russians, who were obliged to evacuate that kingdom in 1708. But Charles being defeated by Peter the Great in 1709, Auguſtus returned into Poland, and being assiſted by a Russian army, obliged Staniſlaus to retire firſt into Sweden, and afterwards into Turkey. Soon after he took up his reſidence at Weiſſenburg, a town in Alſace. Auguſtus diſpatched Sum his envoy to France to complain of this ; but the duke of Orleans, who was then regent, returned this anſwer : “ Tell your king, that France has always been the asylum of unhappy princes.” Staniſlaus lived in obſcurity till 1725, when Louis XV. eſpouſed the princeſs Mary his daughter. Upon the death of King Auguſtus in 1733, he returned to Poland in hopes of remounting the throne of that kingdom. A large party declared for him ; but his competitor the young elector of Saxony, being ſupported by the Emperor Charles VI. and the Empreſs of Ruſe ſia, was choſen king, though the majority was againſt him. Dantzic, to which Staniſlaus had retired, was quickly taken, and the unfortunate prince made his eſcape in diſguiſe with great difficulty, after hearing that a price was ſet upon his head by the Russians. When peace was concluded in 1736 between the Emperor and France, it was agreed that Staniſlaus ſhould abdicate the throne, but that he ſhould be acknowledged king of Poland and grand duke of Lithuania, and continue to bear theſe titles during life ; that all his effects and thoſe of the queen his ſpouſe ſhould be reſtored ; that an amneſty ſhould be declared in Poland for all that was paſt, and that every perſon ſhould be reſtored to his poſſessions, rights, and privileges : that the elector of Saxony ſhould be acknowledged king of Poland by all the powers who acceded to the treaty : that Staniſlaus ſhould be put in peacable poſſession of the duchies of Lorrain and Bar; but that immediately after his death theſe duchies ſhould be united for ever to the crown of France. Staniſlaus ſucceeded a race of princes in Lorrain, who were beloved and regretted ; and his ſubjects found their ancient ſovereigns revived in him. He taſted then the pleasure which he had ſo long deſired, the pleaſure of making men happy. He assiſted his new ſubjects ; he embelliſhed Nancy and Lunéville ; he made uſeful eſtabliſhments ; he founded colleges and built hoſpitals. He was engaged in theſe noble employments, when an accident occasioned his death. His night-gown caught fire and burnt him ſo ſeverely before it could be extinguiſhed, that he was ſeized with a fever, and died the 23d of February 1766. His death occaſioned a public mourning : the tears of his ſubjects indeed are the best eulogium upon this prince. In his youth he had accuſtomed himſelf to fatigue, and had thereby ſtrengthened his mind as well as his conſtitution. He lay always upon a kind of mattreſs, and ſeldom required any ſervice from his domeſtics. He was temperate, liberal, adored by his vaſſals, and perhaps the only nobleman in Poland who had any friends. He was in Lorrain what he had been in his own country, gentle, affable, compaſſionate, treating his ſubjects like equals, participating their ſorrows and alleviating their misfortunes. He reſembled completely the picture of a philoſopher which he himſelf has drawn. “The true philoſopher (ſaid he) ought to be free from prejudices, and to know the value of reaſon : he ought neither to think the higher ranks of life of more value than they are, nor to treat the lower orders of mankind with greater contempt than they deferve : he ought to enjoy pleaſures without being a ſlave to them, riches without being attached to them, honours without pride or vanity : he ought to ſupport diſgraces without either fearing or courting them : he ought to reckon what he poſſeſſes ſufficient for him, and to regard what he has not as uſeleſs : he ought to be equal in every fortune, always tranquil, always gay : he ought to love order, and to obſerve it in all his actions : he ought to be ſevere to himſelf, but indulgent to others : he ought to be frank and ingenuous without rudeneſs, polite without falſe- hood, complaiſant without baſeneſs : he ought to have the courage to diſregard every kind of glory, and to reckon as nothing even philoſophy itſelf.” Such was Slaniſlaus in every ſituation. His temper was affection</p></body></text></TEI>
