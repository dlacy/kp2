He defines the enthymeme as a species of syllogism, namely, as “a syllogism from probabilities and signs” (eξ <hi rend="italic">εϊκότων καί σημείων).</hi>  The “probability” (<hi rend="italic">εiκ0ς)</hi>  is a general proposition, expressing that which usually happens, as, “wise men are usually just.” The “sign ” (ση<hi rend="sub">y</hi>uefor) is a particular proposition, as, “ Socrates is just.” The “sign” may be fallible or infallible. If we say, “wise men are just; for Socrates was Avise and just,” this is an enthymeme from a fallible “sign,” the implied syllogism being “Socrates was wise; Socrates was just (<hi rend="italic">σημεTov) ; .'.</hi>  all wise men are just”; and lιere the “sign” is, in Aristotle’s phrase, “as a particular to a universal,” because from the one case of Socrates we draw an inference about all men. If, again, we say,—“Here is a sign that he is ill—he is feverish”; our enthymeme is using an infallible sign, the syllogism being, “All who are feverish are ill; he is feverish (<hi rend="italic">σημεiov)</hi>  ; .<hi rend="sup">,</hi>. he is ill.” Here, again, the “sign” is “as a particular to a universal.” When the “sign” is thus infallible, it is properly called<hi rend="italic">tekmerion (τεκμhριοv),</hi>  the matter having been demonstrated and concluded (<hi rend="italic">πεπεpaσμεvοv)—</hi>“for tekmar and peras mean the same thing (‘limit’) in the old language.” Sometimes, again, the fallible sign is “as universal to particular,” <hi rend="italic">c.g.,</hi>  “ Here is a sign that he has a fever —he breathes quick,” the syllogism being, “Feverish men breathe quick ; he breathes quick (στ7<hi rend="sub">l</hi>u∈iov) ; . ∙. he has a fever,” where a particular cause is unsoundly inferred from an effect (the “universal”) which might have other causes.</p><p>When Aristotle thus describes the enthymeme, or rhetorical syllogism, as dealing with “probabilities” aud “signs,” he is describing its ordinary or characteristic materials, <hi rend="italic">qua rhetorical </hi>syllogism. He does not mean to say that rhetoric cannot use syllogisms formed with other material. It would be hardly needful to point this out, were it not that, in spite of his own clear words, his meaning has sometimes been misunderstood. “The premises of rhetorical syllogisms,” he says, “seldom belong to the class of necessary facts. The subject matter of judgments and deliberations is usually contingent ; for it is about their actions that men debate and take thought ; but actions are all contingent, no one of them, so to say, being necessary. And results which are merely usual and contingent must be deduced from premises of the same kind, as necessary results from necessary premises. It follows that the propositions from which enthymemes are taken will be sometimes necessarily true, but more often only contingently true.” Among the materials of the enthymeme, the “sign ” which is infallible (the <hi rend="italic">σημεiοv</hi>  which is also a <hi rend="italic">τεκμηpιοv)</hi>  is so because it is to some necessary truth as part to whole.</p><p>Aristotle did not regard the suppression of one premiss in the statement as essential to the enthymeme. The syllogism, of which the enthymeme is merely a kind, was regarded by him “not in relation to the expression ” ( où <hi rend="italic">προς τbv εζω λόγοι/),</hi>  but to the process in the mind (άλλα <hi rend="italic">πρbς τbv iv τη ψυχή λόγοι/, Anal. Rost.,</hi>  i. 10). As Sir W. Hamilton has justly said, he could not then have intended to distinguish a class of syllogisms by a verbal accident. The distinction of the rhetorical syllogism, in Aristotle’s view, was in its matter, not in its form. This is, indeed, made sufficiently clear by his own remark that the enthymeme may “often” be more concisely stated than the full, or normal, syllogism <hi rend="italic">{Rhet.,</hi>  i. 2). There is obviously no reason why the rhetorical reasoner should not state both his premisses, if he finds it convenient or effective to do so. Since, however, one of the premisses is often left to be mentally supplied, some of the later writers on rhetoric came to treat this as part of the essence of the enthymeme. It was then that the word ατeλτ)s was interpolated after <hi rend="italic">συλλογισμός</hi>  in Aristotle, <hi rend="italic">Analyt. Prior.,</hi>  ii. 27, where the enthymeme is defined as <hi rend="italic">συλλογισμός έξ εικότων καί σημείων.</hi>@@<hi rend="italic"><hi rend="sup">1</hi></hi>  Hence Quintilian says of the enthymeme (v. 10), “alii rhetoricum syllogismum, alii <hi rend="italic">imperfectum</hi>  syllogismum vocant” ; hence, too, Juvenal’s <hi rend="italic">“curturn </hi>enthymema. ”</p><p>The other branch of the ‘ ‘ logical proof ” in rhetoric corresponds to the induction of strict logic, and consists in giving the semblance of inductive reasoning by the use of one or two well-known examples. As Aristotle calls the enthymeme a rhetorical syllogism, so he calls the example <hi rend="italic">{παράδειγμα)</hi>  “ a rhetorical induction. ” Thus if a man has asked for a body-guard, and the speaker wishes to show that the aim is a tyranny, he may quote the “examples ” of Dionysius and Pisistratus.</p><p>Aristotle next distinguishes the “universal ” from the ‘ ‘ special ” topics, or commonplaces of rhetoric. The word <hi rend="italic">τόπος,</hi>  “place,” means in this context “ that place in which a proposition of a given kind is to be sought.” The <hi rend="italic">τόποι,</hi>  then, are classifications of propositions and arguments which rhetoric makes beforehand, with a view to readiness in debate. Cicero well illustrates the phrase—“As it is easy to find hidden things when the place has Deen pointed out and marked, so, when we want to track out an argument, we ought to know the <hi rend="italic">places,</hi>  as Aristotle has called these seats, abodes, as it were, from which arguments are drawn.</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  On this interpolation, see Sir W. Hamilton’s<hi rend="italic">Discussions,</hi>  p. 154.</p><lb/><p>So a commonplace, or topic, may be defined as the abode of an argument <hi rend="italic">{licet definire locum esse argumenti sedem</hi>  ; Cic., <hi rend="italic">Topiea, </hi>ii. 7). So elsewhere he describes the <hi rend="italic">τόποι</hi>  of rhetoric as <hi rend="italic">“ regiones</hi>  intra quas venere et pervestiges quod quæras”— “haunts in which one may hunt and track out the object of quest” (De <hi rend="italic">Orat.,</hi>  ii. 34). The “universal commonplaces” <hi rend="italic">{κοινοί τόποι)</hi>  are general heads of argument applicable to all subjects whatsoever—as, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>  on the “possibility” or “impossibility” of anything. The special commonplaces <hi rend="italic">{τόποι των εiδωv, Rhet.,</hi>  ii. 22, more briefly called efδη) are those which are drawn from special branches of knowledge, as from politics, ethics, &amp;c. Here Aristotle observes that the more a rhetorician enters on the subject-matter of any particular science the more will he tend to pass out of the domain which properly belongs to the art of rhetoric.</p><p>In that domain three provinces are distinguished. Deliberative rhetoric <hi rend="italic">{συμβουλευτική)</hi>  is concerned with exhortation or dissuasion, and with future time; its “end” <hi rend="italic">{τέλος)—</hi>that which it keeps in view, or its standard—is advantage (or detriment) to the persons addressed. Forensic rhetoric <hi rend="italic">{δικανική)</hi>  is concerned with accusation or defence, and with time past ; its standard is justice or injustice. Epideictic rhetoric—the ornamental rhetoric of “display” <hi rend="italic">{επιδεικτική)—</hi>is concerned with praise or blame, and usually with time present ; its standard is honour or shame.</p><p>1.    Let us begin with deliberative rhetoric, says Aristotle, and see what things a deliberative speaker ought to know. The subjects with which, in a public assembly, he will have to deal are mainly these five :—(1) finance, (2) foreign war, (3) home defence, (4) commerce, (5) legislation. Under all these heads, he ought to be provided with some eι'δη, or special commonplaces. Further, all his suasion or dissuasion has reference to the happiness of those whom he addresses. Hence he must be acquainted with the popular notions of happiness which are actually prevalent. Here Aristotle gives a series of popular definitions of happiness, and a list of the elements which are generally regarded as constituting it. A similar analysis of “good” <hi rend="italic">{αγαθόν)</hi>  follows.</p><p>The scientific spirit of the rhetoric is strongly accentuated by the unscientific character of these and subsequent analyses. Aristotle never forgets that his rhetorician wants to know, not what a thing is, but what it is generally thought to be. There is nothing of cynicism or sarcasm in all this. He is simply going through his prescribed task. He is making rhetoric, as such, into a method. But suppose the question arises—“Of two good things which is the better ?” Our deliberative speaker must be able to treat the <hi rend="sup">,</hi> ‘ universal commonplace ” of degree<hi rend="italic">{μάλλον καί ήττον).</hi>  Then, he must also know something about the chief forms of government,— democracy, oligarchy, aristocracy, monarchy,—not as they are or should be, but as they are popularly conceived.</p><p>2.    The ornamental rhetoric <hi rend="italic">{επιδεικτική),</hi>  which is taken next, is somewhat briefly dismissed. It might be conjectured, in explanation of its place in the treatment—we should have expected it to come third—that Aristotle was the first writer who recognized it as an independent kind, and that he viewed it as an offshoot from the deliberative branch. The epideictic speaker must know what most men think “honour” or “shame,” “virtue” or “vice.” At this point a verbal distinction of some interest occurs:—praise <hi rend="italic">(έπαινος)</hi>  implies moral approbation; but an “encomium” <hi rend="italic">(έγκώμιον)</hi>  is given to “ achievements ” <hi rend="italic">(έργα)</hi>  as such. The most generally useful “ topic ” for the ornamental speaker is <hi rend="italic">avξησις</hi>  (magnifying),—as the rhetorical induction <hi rend="italic">(παράδειγμα) </hi>most helps the deliberative speaker, and the rhetorical syllogism <hi rend="italic">(ενθύμημα)</hi>  is most useful to the forensic.</p><p>3.    In forensic rhetoric, we must begin by analysing injustice. And first, “What are the motives and aims of wrong-doing?” Actions are either voluntary from habit, reason, anger, lust, or involuntary from chance, nature, force. In reference to the voluntary actions, it is needful to know the popular conception of pleasure. Secondly, “What is the character which disposes a man to do wrong, or which exposes him to suffering it ?” These topics must be familiar, in a popular way, to the forensic speaker. He must also know the general grounds on which actions are classed as just or unjust. Actions must be considered, first, in reference to law, which is either special <hi rend="italic">(ίδιος),</hi>  whether written or unwritten, the law of particular places and communities, or else universal <hi rend="italic">{κοινός),</hi>  the law of nature. The second question about an “unjust” action is whether it hurts an individual or the community. The definition of “being wronged” <hi rend="italic">(aδικε7σθaι)</hi>  is, “to be unjustly treated by a voluntary agent.” Further, the definition of a particular offence <hi rend="italic">(επίγραμμα)</hi>  sometimes raises a legal issue. A man may admit an act, and deny that it corresponds to the description given of it by the accuser. It is needful, then, to know the definitions of the principal crimes. It may be noticed that Aristotle here anticipates a topic which played a large part in the later rhetoric. The contested issues which he calls <hi rend="italic">αμφισβητήσεις {Rhet.,</hi>  iii. 16) were the <hi rend="italic">στάσεις</hi>  (constitutiones or status) of later days. Thus the issue as to the proper definition of an offence, to which he refers here <hi rend="italic">{Rlvet.,</hi>  i. 13), coincides with the later</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
