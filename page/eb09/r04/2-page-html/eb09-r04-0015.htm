                    corresponding with those established by Murchison, but not yet settled in the
                    south-east and east, are, according to M. Nikitin, the following :—&nbsp;from
                    the southern frontier of Poland to Ovrutch, Uman, Kremen-tchug, Poitava, and
                    Razdornaya (50° N. latitude), with a curve&nbsp;northwards to Kozelsk (?) ;
                    thence due north to Vetluga (δ8<sup>o</sup> north&nbsp;latitude), east to
                    Glazova in Vyatka, and from this place towards the&nbsp;north and west along the
                    watershed of the Volga and Petchora (?).&nbsp;South of the 50th &quot;parallel
                    appears the loess, with all its usual&nbsp;characters (land fossils, want of
                    stratification, &amp;c. ), showing a remarkable uniformity of composition over
                    very large surfaces; it&nbsp;covers both watersheds and valleys, but chiefly the
                    former. Such&nbsp;being the characters of the Quaternary deposits in Russia,
                    the&nbsp;majority of Russian geologists now adopt the opinion that
                    Russia&nbsp;was covered, as far as the above limits, with an immense
                    ice-sheet&nbsp;which crept over central Russia and central Germany from
                    Scandinavia and north Russia. Another ice-covering was probably advancing at the
                    same time from the north-east, that is, from the&nbsp;northern part of the
                    Urals, but the question as to the glaciation&nbsp;of the Urals still remains
                    open. As to the loess, the view is more&nbsp;and more gaining ground which
                    considers it as a steppe-deposit&nbsp;due to the drifting of fine sand and dust
                    during a dry episode in the&nbsp;Pleistocene period.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The deposits of the Post-Glacial period are represented
                    throughout Russia, Poland, and Finland, as also throughout Siberia and central
                    Asia, by very thick lacustrine deposits, which show that,&nbsp;after the melting
                    of the ice-sheet, the country was covered with&nbsp;immense lakes, connected by
                    broad channels (the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >fjdrden</span><span class="font1"> of the&nbsp;Swedes), which later on gave
                    rise to the actual rivers. On the&nbsp;outskirts of the lacustrine region,
                    closely resembling the area of&nbsp;the actual continent, traces of marine
                    deposits, not higher than 200&nbsp;or perhaps even 150 feet above present
                    sea-level, are found alike&nbsp;on the Arctic Sea and on the Baltic and Black
                    Sea coasts. A deep&nbsp;gulf of the Arctic Sea advanced up the valley of the
                    Dwina ; and&nbsp;the Caspian, connected by the Manytch with the Black Sea,
                    and&nbsp;by the Uzboy valley with Lake Aral, penetrated north up the
                    Volga&nbsp;valley, as far as its Samara bend. Unmistakable traces show
                    that,&nbsp;while during the Glacial period Russia had an arctic flora
                    and&nbsp;fauna, the climate of the Lacustrine period was more genial
                    than&nbsp;it is now, and a dense human population at that time peopled
                    the&nbsp;shores of the numberless lakes.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The Lacustrine period has not yet reached its close in Russia.
                    Finland and the north-west hilly plateaus are still in the same&nbsp;geological
                    phase, and are dotted with numberless lakes and ponds,&nbsp;while the rivers
                    continue to dig out their yet undetermined channels. But the great lakes which
                    covered the country during the&nbsp;Lacustrine period have disappeared, leaving
                    behind them immense&nbsp;marshes like those of the Pripet and in the north-east.
                    The&nbsp;disappearance of what still remains of them is accelerated not
                    only&nbsp;by the general decrease of moisture, but also by the gradual upheaval
                    of northern Russia, which is going on from Esthonia and&nbsp;Finland to the Kola
                    peninsula and Nova Zembla, at an average rate&nbsp;of about two feet per
                    century. This upheaval,—the consequences of&nbsp;which have been felt even
                    within the historic period, by the drainage of the formerly impracticable
                    marshes of Novgorod and at the&nbsp;head of the Gulf of Finland,—together with
                    the destruction of&nbsp;forests, which must be considered, however, as a quite
                    secondary&nbsp;and subordinate cause, contributes towards a decrease of
                    precipitation over Russia and towards increased shallowness of her
                    rivers.&nbsp;At the same time, as the gradients of the rivers are gradually
                    increasing on account of the upheaval of the continent, the rivers&nbsp;dig
                    their channels deeper and deeper. Consequently central and&nbsp;especially
                    southern Russia witness the formation of numerous&nbsp;miniature canons, or
                    </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ovraghi</span><span
                    class="font1"> (deep ravines), the summits of which&nbsp;rapidly advance and
                    ramify in the loose surface deposits. As for&nbsp;the southern steppes, their
                    desiccation, the consequence of the&nbsp;above causes, is in rapid
                        progress.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The soil of Russia depends chiefly on the distribution of the
                    boulder-clay and loess coverings described above, on the progress&nbsp;made by
                    the rivers in the excavation of their valleys, and on the&nbsp;moistness of
                    climate. Vast areas in Russia are quite unfit for&nbsp;cultivation, 27 per cent,
                    of the aggregate surface of European&nbsp;Russia (apart from Poland and Finland)
                    being occupied by lakes,&nbsp;marshes, sands, &amp;c., 38 per cent, by forests,
                    14 per cent, by&nbsp;prairies, and only 21 per cent, being under culture. The
                    distribution of all these is, however, very unequal, and the five following
                    subdivisions may be established :—(1) the </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">tundras</span><span class="font1"> ; (2)
                    the&nbsp;forest region ; (3) the middle region, comprising the surface available
                    for agriculture and partly covered with forests ; (4) the black-earth
                    </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{tchernoziom)</span><span
                    class="font1"> region; and (5) the Steppes. Of these the&nbsp;black-earth
                    region,—about 150,000,000 acres,—which reaches from&nbsp;the Carpathians to the
                    Urals, extending to the Pinsk marshes and</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font1">the upper Oka in the north, is the most important. It is covered
                    with a thick sheet of black earth, a kind of loess, mixed with 5&nbsp;to 15 per
                    cent. of humus, due to the decomposition of an herbaceous vegetation, which
                    developed richly during the Lacustrine&nbsp;period on a continent relatively dry
                    even at that epoch. On the&nbsp;three-fields system corn has been grown upon it
                    for fifty to seventy&nbsp;consecutive years without manure. Isolated black-earth
                    islands,&nbsp;less fertile of course, occur also in Courland and Kovno, in
                    the&nbsp;Oka, Volga, and Kama depression, on the slopes of the Urals,
                    and&nbsp;in a few patches in the north. Towards the Black Sea coast
                    its&nbsp;thickness diminishes, and it disappears in the valleys. In
                    the&nbsp;extensive region covered with boulder-clay the black earth
                    appears&nbsp;only in isolated places, and the soil consists for the most part of
                    a&nbsp;sandy clay, containing a much smaller admixture of humus.
                    There&nbsp;culture is possible only with the aid of a considerable quantity
                    of&nbsp;manure. Drainage finding no outlet through the thick clay covering, the
                    soil of the forest region is often covered with extensive&nbsp;marshes, and the
                    forests themselves are often mere thickets spreading over marshy ground ; large
                    tracts covered with sand appear in&nbsp;the west, and the admixture of boulders
                    with the clay in the&nbsp;north-west renders agriculture increasingly difficult.
                    On the&nbsp;Arctic coast the forests disappear, giving place to the
                    tundras.&nbsp;Finally, in the south-east, towards the Caspian, on the slopes
                    of&nbsp;the southern Urals and the Obshchiy Syrt, as also in the interior
                    of&nbsp;the Crimea, and in several parts of Bessarabia, there are large
                    tracts&nbsp;of real desert, covered with coarse sand and devoid of
                        vegetation.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Notwithstanding the fact that Russia extends from north to south
                    through 26 degrees of latitude, the climate of its different&nbsp;portions,
                    apart from the Crimea and the Caucasus, presents a&nbsp;striking uniformity. The
                    aerial currents—cyclones, anti-cyclones,&nbsp;and dry south-east winds—extend
                    over wide surfaces and cross&nbsp;the flat plains freely. Everywhere we find a
                    cold winter and a&nbsp;hot summer, both varying in their duration, but differing
                    relatively little in the extremes of temperature recorded. From Table&nbsp;III.
                    (page 76) it will be seen that there is no place in Russia,&nbsp;Archangel and
                    Astrakhan included, where the thermometer does&nbsp;not rise in summer nearly to
                    86° Fahr, and descend in winter to&nbsp;-13° and - 22°. It is only on the Black
                    Sea coast that we find&nbsp;the absolute range of temperature reduced to 108°,
                    while in the&nbsp;remainder of Russia it reaches 126<sup>o</sup> to 144°, the
                    oscillations being&nbsp;between - 22° to - 31°, occasionally - 54°, and 86° to
                    104°, occasionally, 109°. Everywhere the rainfall is small : if Finland and
                    Poland&nbsp;on the one hand and Caucasus with the Caspian depression on
                    the&nbsp;other be excluded, the average yearly rainfall varies between
                    the&nbsp;limits of 16 and 28 inches. Everywhere, too, we find that
                    the&nbsp;maximum rainfall does not take place in winter (as in
                    western&nbsp;Europe) but in summer, and that the months of advanced
                    spring&nbsp;are warmer than the corresponding months of autumn.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Though thus exhibiting all the distinctive features of a
                    continental climate, Russia is not altogether exempt from the moderating
                    influence of the ocean. The Atlantic cyclones also reach the Russian plains,
                    mitigating to some extent the cold of the&nbsp;winter, and in summer bringing
                    with them their moist winds and&nbsp;thunderstorms ; their influence is chiefly
                    felt in western Russia,&nbsp;but extends also towards and beyond the Urals. They
                    thus check&nbsp;the extension and limit the duration of the cold
                    anticyclones.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Throughout Russia the winter is of long continuance. The last
                    days of frost are experienced for the most part in April, but&nbsp;also in May
                    to the north of 55°. The spring is exceptionally&nbsp;beautiful in central
                    Russia ; late as it usually is, it sets in with&nbsp;vigour, and vegetation
                    develops with a rapidity which gives to&nbsp;this season in Russia a special
                    charm, unknown in warmer&nbsp;climates ; the rapid melting of snow at the same
                    time raises the&nbsp;rivers, and renders a great many minor streams navigable
                    for a&nbsp;few weeks. But a return of cold weather, injurious to
                    vegetation,&nbsp;is observed throughout central and eastern Russia between May
                    18&nbsp;and 24, so that it is only in June that warm weather sets
                    in&nbsp;definitely, reaching its maximum in the first half of July (or
                    of&nbsp;August on the Black Sea coast). The summer is much warmer&nbsp;than
                    might be supposed ; in south-eastern Russia it is much&nbsp;warmer than in the
                    corresponding latitudes of France, and really&nbsp;hot weather is experienced
                    everywhere. It does not, however,&nbsp;prevail for long, and in the first half
                    of September the first frosts&nbsp;begin to be experienced on the middle Urals ;
                    they reach western&nbsp;and southern Russia in the first days of October, and
                    are felt on&nbsp;the Caucasus about the middle of November. The
                    temperature&nbsp;descends so rapidly that a month later, about October 10
                    on&nbsp;the middle Urals and November 15 throughout Russia, the&nbsp;thermometer
                    ceases to rise above the freezing-point. The rivers&nbsp;rapidly freeze ;
                    towards November 20 all the streams of the White&nbsp;Sea basin are covered with
                    ice, and so remain for an average of&nbsp;167 days ; those of the Baltic, Black
                    Sea, and Caspian basins&nbsp;freeze later, but about December 20 nearly all the
                    rivers of the</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
