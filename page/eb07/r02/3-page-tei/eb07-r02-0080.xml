Theodorick King of the Goths, called in these romantic legends Dide-rickof Bern <hi rend="italic">(be.</hi>  Verona,) was selected for this purpose by the German Minnesingers. Among the principal personages introduced are Ezzel, King of the Huns, who is no other than the celebrated Attila ; and Gunter, King of Burgundy, who is identified with a Guntacher of history who really held that kingdom. The good knight Wolfram von Eschenbach seems to have been the first who assembled the scattered traditions and minstrel tales concerning these sovereigns into one large volume of German verse, entitled <hi rend="italic">Heldenbuch,</hi>  or the Book of Heroes. In this the author has availed himself of the unlimited licence of a romancer ; and has connected with the history of Didcrick and his chivalry a number of detached legends which had certainly a separate and independent existence. Such is the tale of <hi rend="italic">Sigurd the Horny,</hi>  which has the appearance of having originally been a Norse saga. An analysis of this singular piece was published by Mr. Weber, in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of Northern Antiquities from the earlier Teutonic and Scandinavian Romances;</hi>  and the subject has been fully illustrated by tlle publications of the learned Von der Hagen in Germany, and those of tlle Hon. William Herbert.</p><p>It is here only necessary to say, that Theodorick, like Charlemagne and Arthur, is considered in the romance as a monarch more celebrated for the valorous achievements of the brotherhood of chivalry whom he has drawn around him, than for his own, though neither deficient in strength nor courage. His principal followers have each their discriminatory and peculiar attributes. Meister Hildebrand, the Nestor of the band, is, like the Maugis of Charlemagne’s heroes, a magician as well as a champion. Hogan, or Hagan, begot betwixt a mortal and a sea-goblin, is the fierce Achilles of the confederation. It is the uniform custom of the romancers to conclude by a general and overwhelming catastrophe, which destroys the w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>hole ring of chivalry whose feats they had commemorated. The ruin which Roncesvalles brought to the Paladins of Charlemagne, and the fatal battle of Camlan to the Knights of the Round Table, fell upon the warriors of Diderick through the revengeful treachery of Crimhilda, tlle wife of Ezzel ; who, in revenge for the death of her first husband, and in her inordinate desire to possess the treasures of the Niflunga or Burgundians, brought destruction on all those celebrated champions. Mr. Weber observes that these German fictions differ from the romances of French chivalry, in the greater ferocity and less refinement of sentiment ascribed to the heroes ; and also in their employing to a great extent the machinery of the Duergar, or dwarfs, a subterranean people to whom the<hi rend="italic">Heldenbuch</hi>  ascribes much strength and subtilty, as well as profound skill in the magic art, and who seem, to a certain extent, the predecessors of the European fairy.</p><p>Italy, so long the seat of classical learning, and where tllat learning was first revived, seems never to have strongly embraced the taste for the Gothic romance. They received, indeed, the forms and institutions of chivalry, but the Italians seem to have been in a considerable degree strangers to its spirit, and not to have become deeply enamoured of its literature. There is an old romance of chivalry proper to Italy, called <hi rend="italic">Guerino the Wretched,</hi>  but we doubt if even this be of indigenous growth. Indeed, when they did adopt from the French the fashionable tales of Charlemagne and his Paladins, these did not attract the attention of the classical Italians, until Boiardo, Bemi, Pulci, and, above all, the divine Ariosto, condescended to use them as thc basis of their well-known romantic poems ; and thus the fictitious narratives originally composed in metre, and afterwards rewritten in prose, were anew decorated with the honours of verse. The romantic poets of Italy did not even disdain to imitate the rambling, diffuse, and episodical style proper to the old romance ; and Ariosto, in particular, although he torments the reader’s attention, by digressing from one adventure to another, delights us, upon frequent perusals, by the extreme ingenuity with which he gathers up the broken ends of his narrative, and finally weaves them all handsomely together in the same piece. But the merits and faults of romantic poetry form themselves the fruitful subject of a long essay. We here only notice the origin of those celebrated works, as a species of composition arising out of the old romance, though surpassing it in regularity, as well as in all the beauties of style and diction.</p><p>With Spain the idea of romance was particularly connected ; and the associations which are formed upon perusing the immortal work of Cervantes, induce us for a long time to believe that the country of Don Quixote must be the very cradle of romantic fiction. Yet, if we speak of priority of date, Spain was amongst the last nations in Europe with whom romance became popular. It was not indeed possible that, among a people speaking so noble and poetical a language, engaged in constant wars, which called forth at once their courage and their genius, there should not exist many historical and romantic ballads descriptive of their rencounters with the Moors. But their native poets seem to have been too much engaged with the events of their own age, and of that which had just preceded it, to permit of their seeking subjects in the regions of pure fiction ; and we have not heard of a Spanish metrical romance, unless the poems describing the adventures of the Cid should be supposed to have any affinity to that class of composition. The Penineula, however, though late in adopting tlle prevailing taste for romantic fiction, gave origin to one particular class, which was at least as popular as any which had preceded it. <hi rend="italic">Amadis de Gaul,</hi>  the production, it would seem, of Vasco de Lobeira, a Portuguese knight, who lived in the fourteenth century, gave a new turn to the tales of chivalry, and threw into the shade the French prose romances, which, until the appearance of this distinguished work, had been the most popular in Europe.</p><p>The author of <hi rend="italic">Amadis,</hi>  in order, perhaps, to facilitate the other changes which he introduced, and to avoid rushing against preconceived ideas of events or character, laid aside the worn-out features of Arthur and Charlemagne, and imagined to himself a new dynasty both of sovereigns and of heroes, to whom he ascribed a style of manners much more refined, and sentiments much more artificial, than had occurred to the authors of <hi rend="italic">Perceval</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Perceforest.</hi>  Lobeira had also taste enough to perceive, that some unity of design would be a great improvement on the old romance, where one adventure is strung to another with little connection from the beginning to the end of the volume ; which thus concluded, not because the plot was winded up, but because the author’s invention, or the printer’s patience, was exhausted. In the work of the Portuguese author, on the contrary, he proposes a certain end, to advance or retard which all the incidents of the work have direct reference. This is the marriage of Amadis with Oriana, against w hich a thousand difficulties are raised by rivals, giants, sorcerers, and all the race of evil powers unfavourable to chivalry ; whilst these obstacles are removed by the valour of the hero, and constancy of the heroine, succoured on their part by those friendly sages, and blameless sorceresses, whose intervention gave so much alarm to the tender-conscienccd De la Noue. Lobeira also displayed considerable attention to the pleasure which arises fπ m the contrast of character ;</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
