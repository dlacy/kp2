<p><span class="font0">mere wall-decoration for elaborate easel-paintings; but this was no new invention. It has been pointed out by Mrs Strong@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>that amongst the wall-paintings of Pompeii we can distinguish&nbsp;a group executed in bold dashes of colour—especially white—&nbsp;according to the principles of modern impressionism. The most&nbsp;striking example of this betrays its source of inspiration by its&nbsp;subject—the ceremony of the evening benediction in front of&nbsp;the temple of Isis (Plate V. fig. 27).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So far the paintings which we have considered can only be regarded as an extremely ingenious and, in the main, tasteful&nbsp;form of wall-decoration; they tell us little of that which we&nbsp;most wish to know—the style and treatment of substantive&nbsp;works of painting. The gap is in some measure filled by the&nbsp;central panels of Pompeian walls, which are usually adorned&nbsp;with subject-paintings, often mythological in subject, clearly&nbsp;marked off from the rest of the wall and intended to take the&nbsp;place of pictures. In the Architectural style these are usually&nbsp;framed in a species of pavilion or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aedicula,</span><span class="font0"> painted in perspective;@@<sup>2</sup> but this motive gradually loses its importance.&nbsp;In the Third style (“ornate”) distinguished by-Mau the&nbsp;architectural design ceases to be intelligible as the counterfeit&nbsp;of real construction, and becomes a purely conventional scheme&nbsp;of decoration; and in the Fourth or Intricate style, which&nbsp;again reverts to true architectural forms, however fantastic&nbsp;and bewildering in their complexity, the figure-subjects are&nbsp;plainly conceived as pictures and framed with a simple band&nbsp;of colour. The subjects of these frescoes are for the most&nbsp;part taken from Greek mythology, and it has been argued that&nbsp;in the main we have to deal with reproductions of Hellenistic&nbsp;paintings rather than of contemporary works of art. It is&nbsp;not to be denied that the motives of famous compositions of&nbsp;earlier date may have found their way into the repertory of&nbsp;the Pompeian artists; it is not unnatural, for example, to&nbsp;conjecture that the figure of Medea here reproduced (Plate VI.&nbsp;fig. 30) may have been inspired by the celebrated painting&nbsp;of Timomachus above-mentioned. But there are reasons for&nbsp;thinking that the debt owed by the Pompeian artists to the&nbsp;Greek schools of the Hellenistic age is not so direct as was&nbsp;believed by Helbig, whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Untersuchungen über die k amp an-ische W andmalerei</span><span class="font0"> won a general acceptance for the theory.&nbsp;It seems clear that in the central subjects of walls decorated&nbsp;in the Architectural style we are intended to see, not a picture&nbsp;in the strict sense, but a view of the outside landscape, generally with a small shrine or cult-statue as the centre of the&nbsp;piece; and the importance of the figure-subject was therefore&nbsp;at first subordinate. These subjects are, it is true, taken from&nbsp;Greek mythology, but this only proves that that source of&nbsp;inspiration was as freely drawn upon in the art as in the literature of imperial Rome. In the later styles figure-subjects&nbsp;without landscape are extremely common, but it has been&nbsp;shown that, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> in the triclinium of the Casa dei Vettii, which&nbsp;is decorated with a cycle of mythological paintings, the lighting&nbsp;is carefully calculated with a view to illusionistic effect under&nbsp;the local conditions, so that the conception of an outlook into&nbsp;external space is not given up. We sometimes, as in one of&nbsp;the rooms in the “ Farnesina ” house, find framed pictures&nbsp;directly imitated, and here the models were clearly of a relatively early period; but this is exceptional. The Pompeian&nbsp;paintings, therefore, may fairly be used as evidence for the&nbsp;methods and aims of art in imperial Rome; and when allowance&nbsp;is made for their decorative character and hasty execution,&nbsp;we must admit that they give token of considerable technical&nbsp;skill—the modelling of figures is often excellent, the colour-scale rich, the “ values ” nicely calculated. The composition&nbsp;of subject-pictures is somewhat theatrical.<sub>t</sub> Amongst the wall-paintings which have been preserved are some which from&nbsp;their classicistic style have been thought to represent Greek&nbsp;originals; the most famous is the “ Aldobrandini Marriage ”&nbsp;(Plate V. fig. 28), now in the Vatican library. As a matter&nbsp;of fact, the composition is formed by the juxtaposition of&nbsp;sculpturesque types, after a fashion familiar to Roman wall-painters. Mention may here be made of the combination of&nbsp;ornamental work in plaster with painting which is found at&nbsp;Pompeii, in the work of the Flavian period at Rome, and in&nbsp;tombs of the 2nd century </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font0"> In the Augustan period we find&nbsp;exquisitely modelled relief-work in plaster, used to ornament&nbsp;vaulted surfaces in the “ Farnesina ” house; it might seem&nbsp;natural to treat of these under tjie heading of Sculpture, but&nbsp;in point of fact they are translations from painting into stucco.&nbsp;At a later time both painter and modeller worked in conjunction,&nbsp;with admirable effect; the results are best seen in the tombs&nbsp;on the Latin Way.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most striking example is that from the “ House of Livia ”&nbsp;on the Palatine.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">Little can be said as to Roman portrait-painting. We know that in this branch of art the technique generally used was&nbsp;that called “ encaustic.” The colours were mixed with liquefied&nbsp;wax and fixed by heat; whether they were applied in a molten&nbsp;state or not has been disputed, but it seems more Hkely that&nbsp;the pigments were laid on cold, and a hot instrument used&nbsp;afterwards. Several examples of such wax-paintings have&nbsp;been found in Egypt, where it was the custom during the 2nd&nbsp;and 3rd centuries </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font0"> to substitute panel portraits for the&nbsp;plastic masks with which mummy-cases were adorned ; * but&nbsp;these cannot be described as works of high art, though they&nbsp;sometimes have realistic merit. A good example in the BerHn&nbsp;Museum </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Antike Denkmäler,</span><span class="font0"> n. pi. 13) is executed in tempera&nbsp;on primed canvas. The medium used in ancient as in medieval&nbsp;tempera painting appears from the statements of ancient&nbsp;writers to have been yolk of egg mixed with fig-sap or natural&nbsp;gums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the Httle we know of purely Roman painting something is added by that which we learn from the remains of the sister&nbsp;art of mosaic, which, being less easily destroyed, have survived&nbsp;in large numbers to the present day. It has been estimated&nbsp;by Gauckler that considerably more than 2000 mosaics with&nbsp;figure-subjects have been discovered; and the number is&nbsp;steadily increasing. For the origin of the art reference may&nbsp;be made to the article </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mosaic,</span><span class="font0"> where the reader will also find&nbsp;an explanation of the essential differences of principle between&nbsp;the arts of painting and mosaic. It is to the credit of the&nbsp;Roman artists that they were, generaUy speaking, ahve to this&nbsp;distinction of method, and did not seek to produce the impression of painting executed with a Hquid medium by the use of&nbsp;solid materials. Indeed, it seems not improbable that in this&nbsp;respect they had a truer conception of the function of mosaic&nbsp;decoration than their Greek forerunners. Amongst the mosaics&nbsp;of Roman date which employ a large number of exceedingly&nbsp;minute cubes in order to produce an illusion akin to that of&nbsp;painting, the most conspicuous examples are the pavement&nbsp;in the Lateran Museum signed by the Greek HeracHtus, which&nbsp;appears to reproduce the “ unswept hall ” of Sosos of Per-gamum (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">AIosaic),</span><span class="font0"> and the AIosaic of the Doves from&nbsp;Hadrian’s Villa, preserved in the Capitoline AIuseum, which&nbsp;may be supposed to have been inspired by the “drinking&nbsp;dove” of the same artist. The former of these contains about&nbsp;120, the latter as many as 160 cubes to the square inch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As shown in the article </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mosaic,</span><span class="font0"> a distinction must be drawn between </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">opus tessellatum,</span><span class="font0"> consisting of cubes regularly disposed&nbsp;in geometrical patterns, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">opus Vermiculatum,</span><span class="font0"> in which a&nbsp;picture is produced by means of cubes irregularly placed. The&nbsp;two methods were commonly used in conjunction by the Romans,&nbsp;who recognized that a pavement should emphasize the form of&nbsp;the room to which it belonged by means of a geometrical border,&nbsp;while figure-subjects should be reserved for the central space.&nbsp;A good example is furnished by a mosaic pavement discovered&nbsp;on the AventineHn 1858, and preserved in the AIuseo deUe&nbsp;Terme (Plate VI. fig. 29). Enclosed within a geometrical&nbsp;framework of guiHoches and scroll-work, diversified with StiH-life subjects and scenic masks which break its monotony, we&nbsp;find a landscape evidently taken from the banks of the Nile,&nbsp;as the hippopotamus and crocodile, as weU as the papyrus and&nbsp;lotus, clearly show. These Egyptian scenes are Hkewise found</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
