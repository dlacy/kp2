A third parry advanced to Furnes, but afterwards withdrew. La Fayette at the fame time advanced towards Bouvines, half way to Namur, from which he afterwards retreated. The whole of theſe expeditions were ill contrived, in as much as they divided the French undiſciplined troops, and expoſed them in ſmall bodies to the attack of veteran forces. The Auſtrians were ſome time before they attempted to retaliate. At length, however, on the iith of June, they attacked M. Gouvion, who commanded the advanced guard of La Fayette’s army near Maubeuge. M. Gouvion was killed by a rolling bullet ; but La Fayette himſelf having come up, the Auſtrians abandoned the field. In the mean time, matters were haſtening in Paris towards a violent criſis. Two parties, both of which were hoſtile to the preſent conſtitution, had gradually been formed in the ſtate. The one wiſhed to give more effectual fupport to the royal authority, by eſtabliſhing a<hi rend="italic">finale</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">two chambers,</hi>  to prevent the king’s vote from being the ſole check upon popular enthuſiaſm. The other party wiſh-ed to ſet aſide royalty altogether, and to hazard the bold experiment of converting France into a republic. Theſe laſt were ſupported by the Jacobin club, which had now contrived to concentrate in itſelf an immenſe maſs of influence. Innumerable popular ſocieties were eſtabliſhed in every town and village throughout the provinces, with theſe a regular correſpondence was kept up by writing and by emiſſaries. Thus ſchemes and notions were inſtantaneouſly propagated through a great empire, and all the violent ſpirits which it con-tained were enabled to act in concert : Eut the more immediate engine of the republican party conſiſted of the immenſe population of the metropolis, whom they now endeavoured to keep in conſtant alarm. For this pnrpoſe they alleged, that an <hi rend="italic">Auſtrian Committee,</hi>  that is to fay, a confpiracy in favour of the enemies of the coun-try, exiſted among the friends of the court. Μ. M. Genfonné and Briſſot even offered in the aſſembly to prove the exiſtence of this pretended Auſtrian committee. À report was next circulated, that the king intended to abſeond from the capital on the 23d of May. Fiis majeſty publicly contradicted theſe accuſa-tions as calumnies, but they made no ſmall impreffion upon the minds of the public. New decrees were now made againſt the refractory clergy, but theſe his majeſty reſuſed to ſanction. A propoſal was alſo made and decreed in the aſſembly to form a camp of 20,000. men under the walls of Paris, and that for this levy every canton in thc kingdom ſhould contribute one horſeman and four infantry. The national guard of Paiis diſ-liked the propoſal, and the king gave to it his negative. Indeed at this time the king ſeems to have come to a reſolution oſ ſtanding out againſt the Jacobin party, to which he had ſor ſome time yieldedt The miniſtry were therefore diſmiſſed, excepting M. Dumourier, and others were appointed in their ſtead. By this event Dumourier loſt die confidence of the Jacobin club. Hé ſaw his error, reſigned his office, and joined the army! In the mean time a decree had been paſſed, authoriſing tb.e manufactory of pikes for the purpoſe of arming cheaply the lower claſs of citizens. Ail means were uſcd to render^the king odious by inflammatory .wri-</p><lb/><p>tings and harangues ; and in both of theſe the noted incendiary Marat took the lead.</p><p>On the 20th of June M. Roederer, the Procureur Ge- _ neral Syndic informed the national aſſembly, that, con-trary to law, formidable bodies of armed men were preparing to preſent petitions to the king, and to the national aſſembly. A part of them ſpeedily appeared with St Huruge and Santerre a brewer at their head. They marched through the hall in a proceffion that laſted two hours, at four o’clock in the afternoon, to the number of about 40,000. They ſurrounded the Thuilleries. The gates were thrown open; and on an attempt to break the door of the apartment, where the king then was, he ordered them to be admitted. His filler the princefs Elizabeth never departed from his ſide during four or ſive hours that he was ſurrounded by the multitude, and compelled to liſten to every ini dignity. Ali this while Petion, the mayor of Paris, was unaccountably abſent. He at length, however, arrived, and alſo a deputation from the aſſembly. The queen, with her children and the princeſs de Lamballe, were in the mean time in the council-chamber, where, though protected from violence, they were yet expoſed to much infult. At laſt, in conſequence of the approach of evening, and of the entreaties of Petion, the multitude gradually diſperſed.</p><p>The indignities ſuſſered on this day by the royal ſa-mily were in ſome reſpects not unfavourable to their cauſe. A great number of the moſt reſpectable inhabitants of the capital were aſhamed of fuch proceedings. They complained of them ſeverely in a petition to the aſſembly, and addreſſes to the ſame purpoſe were re-ceived from ſeveral departments. The directory of the department of Paris, at the head of which were M;. Rochefaucault and M. Tulleyrand, publiſhed a declaration diſapproving· of the conduct of the mayor, and of M. Manuel the procureur of the commune, whom they. afterwards ſuſpended from their offices, although they were ſpeedily reſtored by a decree of the aſſembly. At the ſame time, La Fayette leaving his army fuddenly, appeared on the 26th at the bar of the national aſſembly. Iffe declared that he came to exprefs the indignation which the whole army felt on account of the events of the 20th : he called upon the aſſembly to pu-niſh the promoters of theſe events, and to diſſolve the factious clubs. The ſudden appearance of La Fayette threw the Jacobins into conſternation, and from that period they never ceaſed to calumniate him.</p><p>On the iſt of July, on the motion of M. Jean de Brie, tlie aſſembly ordered'a proclamation to be made, that <hi rend="italic">the country was in danger.</hi>  On the 6th, the king gave intimation that the king of Pruffia was marching with 52,000 men to co-operate againſt France. The French arms were at this time fomewhat ſuccefsful in the Auſtrian Netherlands ; but the cabinet ſpeedily thought it neceſſary to order the armies to retreat : a meaſure which was. afterwards ■ publicly cenfured by Marſhall Luckner.</p><p>On the 7th, a lingular, ſcene occurred in the nation-al aſſembly. At the inſtant that M. Briſſot was about to commence an oration, M. Lammourette biſhop of Lyons requeſted to be heard for a few minutes. He expatiated on the neceffity of union among the members of the affembly, anchoſ ſacriſicing their paffions and pre-</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
