<p><span class="font3">renown to the cathedral of Trier since the beginning of the 12th century </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Gesta Trevir., Mon. Germ. Scr.</span><span class="font3"> viii. p. 152).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The number of relics increased to a fabulous extent during the middle ages. There were churches which possessed hundreds, even thousands, of relics. In the cathedral of&nbsp;Eichstätt were to be found, as ’ early as 1071, 683 relics&nbsp;(Gundech, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lib. pont. Eist., Mon. Germ. Scr.</span><span class="font3"> vii. p. 246 seq.);&nbsp;the monastery of Hirschau had 222 in the year 1091 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(De eons,&nbsp;mai. mon., Mon. Germ. Ser.</span><span class="font3"> xiv. p. 261); the monastery of&nbsp;Stedernburg 515 in the year 1166 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann. Sled. Scr.</span><span class="font3"> xvi. p. 212&nbsp;scq.). But these figures are trifling compared with those&nbsp;at the end of the middle ages. In the year 1520 could be&nbsp;counted 19,013 in the Schlosskirche at Wittenberg, and 21,483&nbsp;in the Schlosskirche at Halle in 1521 (Köstlin, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Friedrich der W.,&nbsp;und die Schlosskirche zu Wittenberg,</span><span class="font3"> p. 58 seq. ; Redlich, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cardinal&nbsp;Albreeht und das Neue Stift zu Halle,</span><span class="font3"> p. 260). There were also&nbsp;collections on the same scale belonging to individuals; a&nbsp;patrician of Nuremberg named Muffel was able to gain possession of 308 relics </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Chroniken der deutschen' Städte,</span><span class="font3"> xi. p. 745).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is curious that while the popular craving for relics had passed all bounds, medieval theology was very cautious in&nbsp;its declarations on the subject of the veneration of relics.&nbsp;Thomas Aquinas based his justification of them on the idea&nbsp;of reverent commemoration; since we venerate the saints,&nbsp;we must also show reverence for their relics, for whoever loves&nbsp;another does honour to that which remains of him after death.&nbsp;On this account it is our duty, in memory of the saints, to pay&nbsp;due honour to their relics and especially to their bodies, which&nbsp;were the temples and dwellings of the Holy Ghost in which&nbsp;He dwelt and worked, and which in the resurrection are tobe&nbsp;made like to the body of Christ; and in likewise because God&nbsp;honours them, in that He works wonders in their presence&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Summa Iheol.</span><span class="font3"> iii. qu. 25, art. 6). The great scholastic philosopher abandoned the theory that the relics in themselves are&nbsp;vessels and instruments of the divine grace and miraculous&nbsp;power. But these ideas were revived, on the other hand, by&nbsp;the Catholicism of the counter-Reformation, which again taught&nbsp;and teaches that God grants many benefits to mankind through&nbsp;the sacred bodies of the martyrs </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Cone. Trid.</span><span class="font3"> sess. xxv.). The&nbsp;doctrine has adapted itself to the popular belief. (A. H.*)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RELIEF (through Fr. from Lat. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">relevare,</span><span class="font3"> to lift up), an act of raising or lifting off or up. Apart from the general sense&nbsp;of a mitigation, cessation or removal of pain, sorrow, discomfort,&nbsp;&amp;c., and the artistic use (It. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">relievo)</span><span class="font3"> of the projection of a figure&nbsp;or design in sculpture from the ground on which it is formed,&nbsp;which is treated below, the term “relief” is used in the following&nbsp;senses; it was one of the feudal incidents between lord and vassal,&nbsp;and consisted of a payment to the lord in kind or money made&nbsp;by the heir on the death of the ancestor for the privilege of&nbsp;succession, for, fiefs not being hereditary, the estate had lapsed&nbsp;to the lord; by this payment the heir </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">caducum praedium&nbsp;relevabat</span><span class="font3"> (Du Cange, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gloss,</span><span class="font3"> s.v. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Relevare).</span><span class="font3"> The word is also&nbsp;generally used, in law, for any exemption granted by a court&nbsp;from the strict legal consequences of an act, &amp;c., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font3"> to a parliamentary candidate from the penal consequences ensuing from&nbsp;breaches of the regulations of the Corrupt and Illegal Practices&nbsp;Acts. Relief is also the term used in English law for the assistance given to the indigent poor by the Poor Law authorities&nbsp;(see Poor Law).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RELIEF, a term in sculpture signifying ornament, a figure or figures raised from the ground of a flat surface of which the&nbsp;sculptured portion forms an inherent part of the body of the&nbsp;whole. The design may be in high relief—“alto-relievo”(ç.î&gt;.), or&nbsp;low relief— “ bas-relief” or “basso-relievo” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.);</span><span class="font3"> in the former&nbsp;case the design is almost wholly detached from the ground, the&nbsp;attachment, through “ under-cutting,” remaining only here and&nbsp;there; in the latter it is wholly attached and may scarcely rise&nbsp;above the surface (as in the modern medal), or it may exceed in&nbsp;projection to about a half the proportionate depth (or thickness)&nbsp;of the figure or object represented. Formerly three terms were&nbsp;commonly employed to express the degree of relief — alto-relievo, basso-relievo and mezzo-relievo (or half-relief); but the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">two last-named have been merged by modern custom into “ low-relief,” to the disadvantage of accurate description. The&nbsp;term relief belongs to modern sculpture. To low relief as understood by us Pliny applied the word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">anaglypta,</span><span class="font3"> but it is to be&nbsp;observed that embossing and chasing came within the same&nbsp;category. It may be considered that less sculptural skill&nbsp;(independently of manipulative skill) is needed in high relief&nbsp;than in low relief, because in the former the true relative proportions in the life (whether figure or other object) have to be&nbsp;rendered, whilc in the latter, although the true height and,&nbsp;in a measure, breadth can be given, the thickness of the object&nbsp;is reduced by at least onc-half, sometimes to almost nothing;&nbsp;and yet in spite of this departure from actuality, this abandonment of fact for a pure convention, a true effect must still be&nbsp;produced, not only in respect to perspective, but also of the&nbsp;actual shadows cast. And insomuch as the compositions are&nbsp;often extremely complicated and have sometimes to suggest&nbsp;retreating planes, the true plane of the material affords little&nbsp;scope for reproducing the required effect. In the beginning&nbsp;the essential idea of the relief was always maintained: that is&nbsp;to say, the sense of the flatness of the slab from which it was&nbsp;cut was impressed throughout the design on the mind of the&nbsp;spectator. Thus the Egyptians merely sunk the outlines and&nbsp;scarcely more than suggested the modelling of the figures, which&nbsp;never- projected beyond the face of the surrounding ground.&nbsp;The Persians, the Etruscans and the Greeks carried on the art&nbsp;to the highest perfection, alike in sculpture and architectural&nbsp;ornament, and they applied it to gem sculpture, as in the case&nbsp;of “ cameo.” Similarly, the inverse treatment of reIief—that&nbsp;is, sunk </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">below</span><span class="font3"> the surface, in order that when used for seals a&nbsp;true relief is obtained—was early brought to great completeness;&nbsp;this form of engraving is called “ intaglio.” The degree of&nbsp;projection in relief, broadly speaking, has varied greatly with&nbsp;the periods of art. Thus, in Byzantine and Romanesque art&nbsp;the relief was low. In Gothic it increased with the increased&nbsp;desire to render several planes one behind the other. With the&nbsp;advent of the Renaissance it became still more accentuated,&nbsp;the heads and figures projecting greatly; but such high relief&nbsp;is sometimes found in early work, especially in metal-work.&nbsp;Although we see a return to lower relief in the Henri II. period,&nbsp;it becomes stronger in the Louis XIII. style, very full in&nbsp;Louis XIV. and Louis XV., but in Louis XVI. is considerably&nbsp;reduced.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(M.

<p><span class="font3">RELIGION. The origin of the Latin word </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rZligio</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">relligio </span><span class="font3">has been the subject of discussion since the time of Cicero. Two&nbsp;alternative derivations have been given, viz. from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rëlëgere,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">to gather together, and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rëligare,</span><span class="font3"> to bind back, fasten. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Relegere&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">meant to gather together, collect, hence to go over a subject&nbsp;again in thought, from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">re</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">legere,</span><span class="font3"> to collect together, hence to&nbsp;read, collect at a glance. This view is that given by Cicero&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Nat. Dear.</span><span class="font3"> ii. 28, 72). He says: “ Qui omnia quae ad cultum&nbsp;deorum pertinerent diligenter retractarent et tanquamrelegerent,&nbsp;sunt dicti religiosi ex relegendo,” “ men were called <sup>f</sup> religious ’&nbsp;from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">relegere,</span><span class="font3"> because they reconsidered carefully and, as it&nbsp;were, went over again in thought all that appertained to the&nbsp;worship of the gods.” He compares </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">elegantes</span><span class="font3"> from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">eligere,&nbsp;diligentes</span><span class="font3"> from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">diligere,</span><span class="font3"> and continues, “ his enim in verbis&nbsp;omnibus inest vis legendi eadem quae in religioso.” This view&nbsp;is supported by the form of the word in the verse quoted by&nbsp;Gellius (iv. 9), “ religentem esse oportet, rcligiosum nef as,” and&nbsp;by the use of the Greek </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">KKeyeiv,</span><span class="font3"> to pay heed to, frequently with&nbsp;a negative, in the sense of the Latin </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">negligere (nec-legere),</span><span class="font3"> cf.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gcwp</span><span class="font3"> inrtp </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">ovk</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> tikeyovres</span><span class="font3"> (Homer, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">II.</span><span class="font3"> xvi. 388), heeding not the&nbsp;visitation of the gods, or où </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">yàp</span><span class="font3"> KuxXanres Atôs . . . </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ä\eyovaw&nbsp;(Od.</span><span class="font3"> ix. 275). The alternative derivation, from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">religare,</span><span class="font3"> to&nbsp;fasten, bind, is that adopted by Lactantius </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Inst.</span><span class="font3"> iv. 28), <sup>ii</sup>Vinculo&nbsp;pietatis obstricti, Dco rcligati sumus unde ipsa religio nomen&nbsp;cepit. ” He quotes in support the line from Lucretius (i. 931),&nbsp;“ religionum nodis animos exsolvere.” Servius (on Virgil,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Aen.</span><span class="font3"> viii. 349) and St Augustine </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Retract,</span><span class="font3"> i. 13) also take </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">religare&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">as the source of the word.
