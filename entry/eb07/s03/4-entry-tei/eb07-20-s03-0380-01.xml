commonly called Skipton in Craven. It is in the wapentake of Staincliffe, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, 216 miles from London. It stands on the river Aire, in a wild and romantic district near two lofty mountains. Being on the canal from Leeds to Liverpool it has some trade with both these places, and of late years it has become the seat of some manufactures of glass, of silk, and of cotton goods. The ancient castle has been preserved, and is now a mansion of the Earl of Thanet. The quarter sessions for the West Riding are held here. It has a well supplied market on Saturdays, and several fairs for the sale of cattle. The inhabitants were, in 1801, 2305; in 1811, 2868; in 1821, 3411 ; and in 1831, 4181.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
