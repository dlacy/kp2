At Rome a temple adorned with paintings by Fabius surnamed the Painter (Pictor) was dedicated to her in 302 B.C. ; and public prayers were offered to her on behalf of the Roman people and the emperor. In 180 b.c., on the occasion of a plague, vows were made to Apollo, AEsculapius, and Salus. Here the special attribute of the goddess appears to be “health”; and in later times she was identified with the Greek goddess of health, Hygeia. On coins of Tiberius, Nero, &amp;amp;c., she is represented as a young maiden with the symbol of Hygeia, a serpent drinking out of a goblet.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
