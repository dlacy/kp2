<p><span class="font0">and still they show no sign of abating popularity. The masterly stage-craft is undoubtedly one of the elements in&nbsp;this remarkable conquest of the play-going public ; the&nbsp;purity and generous morality of the plays another ; the&nbsp;dialogue—which is always bright and clever, without any&nbsp;straining after or indeed much attaining to wit—a third ;&nbsp;the humour, distinctness, and typical representativeness&nbsp;of the characters a fourth. That there is more art and&nbsp;individuality in the plays than critics at first were willing&nbsp;to admit is clear from the fact that none of Robertson’s&nbsp;numerous imitators have succeeded in catching his happy&nbsp;knack. Another proof of something like genius—dramatic&nbsp;genius if not literary genius—is the skill with which he&nbsp;repeats the same idea with such variations that each time&nbsp;it is as fresh as if it were new. Again and again his&nbsp;situations owe their point to the contrast between generous&nbsp;kindness of heart and sordid worldliness, or between the&nbsp;ardent trustful affections of youth and the cynicism of&nbsp;disenchanted middle age. Pleasant sunny brightness and&nbsp;ingenuity within a narrow range constitute Robertson’s&nbsp;distinction rather than breadth or fertility or striking brilliancy of wit. He knew his powers and worked steadily&nbsp;within them, not striving to go beyond. With the exception of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">David Garrick</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Home,</span><span class="font0"> written for the Haymarket, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dreams</span><span class="font0"> for the Gaiety, all his well-known&nbsp;plays were written for the Prince of Wales Theatre, with&nbsp;which his distinctive style of comedy is identified. Unhappily he did not live long to enjoy his success, but died&nbsp;in London in February 1871.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROBERTSON, William (1721 -1793), an eminent Scottish historian, born at Borthwick, Midlothian, on the&nbsp;19th September 1721, was the eldest son of the Rev.&nbsp;William Robertson and of Eleanor Pitcairn. He received&nbsp;his early education at the school of Dalkeith,—at that&nbsp;time one of the best in Scotland ; but at the age of twelve&nbsp;he was removed to the university of Edinburgh, where he&nbsp;soon manifested that sustained ardour in the pursuit of&nbsp;knowledge which he preserved throughout his long life.&nbsp;On his commonplace books, written when he was a mere&nbsp;youth, he always inscribed the motto : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vita sine literis&nbsp;mors est.</span><span class="font0"> He was from the first intended for the ministry ;&nbsp;when twenty-two years old he was presented to the living&nbsp;of Gladsmuir in East Lothian, and almost immediately&nbsp;afterwards he lost both his father and his mother, who&nbsp;died within a few hours of each other. The support and&nbsp;education of a younger brother and six sisters then devolved upon him, and, though his income was only £100&nbsp;a year, he sheltered them all in his house and “ continued&nbsp;to educate his sisters under his own roof till they were&nbsp;settled respectably in the world ” (Stewart). Robertson’s&nbsp;inclination for study was never allowed to interfere with&nbsp;his duties as a parish minister, which he rather increased&nbsp;than diminished : “ it was his custom during the summer&nbsp;months to convene on Sunday morning the youth of the&nbsp;parish of Gladsmuir half an hour before the commencement of the regular service of the church, and to employ&nbsp;that time in explaining to them the doctrines of the&nbsp;Catechism.” His attention to his pastoral duties and his&nbsp;power and distinction as a preacher had made him a local&nbsp;celebrity while still a young man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His energy and decision of character were brought out vividly by the rebellion of 1745. When Edinburgh&nbsp;seemed in danger of falling into the hands of the rebels&nbsp;he laid aside the pacific habits of his profession and&nbsp;joined the volunteers in the capital. When the city was&nbsp;surrendered he was one of the small band who repaired&nbsp;to Haddington and offered their services to the commander of the royal forces. Such a man could not remain&nbsp;in obscurity, and in the year 1751, when not quite thirty&nbsp;years of age, we find him already taking a prominent part&nbsp;in the business of the General Assembly. On the first&nbsp;occasion when he spoke (in seconding a motion by John&nbsp;Home for the suspension of certain presbyters who had&nbsp;refused to take part in an unpopular settlement) he was&nbsp;listened to with great attention, but his words had so&nbsp;little immediate effect on the assembly that on a division&nbsp;he was left in a minority of eleven against two hundred.&nbsp;A young mart might well have been daunted by such a&nbsp;defeat, but his energy and self reliance refused to yield.&nbsp;His great oratorical power, at once lucid, cogent, and persuasive, had made an impression on men’s minds, and&nbsp;within so short a period as one year, when he again&nbsp;advocated his principles in connexion with what is known&nbsp;as the Inverkeithing case, he carried the house completely&nbsp;with him, and with the deposition of Thomas Gillespie&nbsp;secured a triumph for the policy he had adopted. From&nbsp;that moment his influence in the councils of the Scottish&nbsp;Church as leader of the “ moderate party ” was for many&nbsp;years nearly supreme (compare Presbyterianism, vol. xix.&nbsp;p. 685). The production of Home’s tragedy of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Douglas&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">on the Edinburgh stage (1757) afforded Robertson another&nbsp;occasion for displaying that union of courage and caution&nbsp;which formed a marked feature of his character. Although the influence of moderatism was now visibly in&nbsp;the ascendant, there was still enough of the older spirit of&nbsp;Scottish Puritanism left to take alarm and raise an outcry&nbsp;against a stage play written by a minister and witnessed&nbsp;by many clergymen who were the author’s friends. One&nbsp;of these, the famous Dr Alexander Carlyle, was prosecuted&nbsp;before the synod for having gone to the theatre, and he&nbsp;tells us in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Autobiography</span><span class="font0"> that he purposely contrived to&nbsp;exclude Robertson from the post of moderator because&nbsp;“his speaking would be of more consequence if not in the&nbsp;chair.” This testimony is the more noteworthy as Carlyle&nbsp;shows throughout his memoirs a grudging and unfriendly&nbsp;tone when speaking of Robertson. The latter, indeed, was&nbsp;able to render his incriminated colleague great service on&nbsp;this occasion, not only by his talent as a speaker, but by&nbsp;reason of the detached and unassailable position which his&nbsp;customary prudence had led him to take up. He never&nbsp;went to the play himself, he said, but that was not because&nbsp;he thought it wrong but because he had given a solemn&nbsp;promise to his father never to do so. He could not therefore join in censuring other clergymen who were held by&nbsp;no such vow as he had made : “ it was sacred to him, but&nbsp;not obligatory on them.” Carlyle was acquitted and&nbsp;Robertson had the credit—which he perhaps somewhat too&nbsp;constantly aimed at and generally secured—of standing well&nbsp;with all parties, of advocating the claims of culture and&nbsp;liberal sentiment without giving ground to their opponents&nbsp;for attacking his personal conduct and character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But during all this period of prominent activity in the public life of Edinburgh Robertson was busy with those&nbsp;historical labours which have given him a permanent place&nbsp;in British literature. He had conceived the plan of his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Scotland</span><span class="font0"> as early as the year 1753; in July&nbsp;1757 he had proceeded as far as the Gowrie conspiracy, and&nbsp;in November of the following year David Hume, then&nbsp;residing in London, was receiving the proof-sheets from&nbsp;Strahan and making friendly but searching criticisms on&nbsp;the work in letters to the author. Till he had finished&nbsp;his book Robertson had never left his native country ; but&nbsp;the publication of his history necessitated a journey to&nbsp;London, and he passed the early months of the year 1758&nbsp;partly in the capital and partly in leisurely rambles in the&nbsp;counties of England. He returned on horseback in company&nbsp;with Alexander Carlyle and other Scotsmen, riding all the&nbsp;way from London to Edinburgh in about eighteen days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The success of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Scotland</span><span class="font0"> was immediate and splendid, and within a month a second edition was</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
