Black ſhoes were worn by the citizens of ordinary rank, and white ones by the women. Red ſhoes were sometimes worn by the ladies, and purple ones by the coxcombs of the other ſex. Red ſhoes were put on by the chief magiſtrates of Rome on days of ceremony and triumphs. The ſhoes of ſenators, patricians, and their children, had a creſcent upon them which ſerved for a buckle ; theſe were called <hi rend="italic">calcei lunati.</hi> Slaves wore no ſhoes ; hence they were called <hi rend="italic">cretati</hi> from their duſty feet. Phocion alſo and Cato Uticenſis went without ſhoes. The toes of the Roman ſhoes were turned up in the point ; hence they were called <hi rend="italic">calcei rostrati, repandi, &amp;c.</hi></p><p>In the 9th and 10th centuries the greateſt princes of Europe wore wooden ſhoes, or the upper part of leather and the ſole of wood. In the reign of William Rufus, a great beau, Robert, ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">the horned,</hi> uſed ſhoes with long ſharp points, ſtuffed with tow, and twisted like a ram’s horn. It is said the clergy, being highly offended, declaimed againſt the long-pointed ſhoes with great vehemence The points, however, continued to increaſe till, in the reign of Richard II. they were of ſo enormous a length that they were tied to the knees with chains ſometimes of gold, ſometimes of ſilver. The upper parts of theſe ſhoes in Chaucer’s time were cut in imitation of a church window. The long-pointed ſhoes were called <hi rend="italic">crackowes,</hi> and continued in faſhion for three centuries in ſpite of the bulls of popes, the decrees of councils, and the declamations of the clergy. At length the parliament of England interpoſed by an act A. D. 1463, prohibiting the uſe of ſhoes or boots with pikes exceeding two inches in length, and prohibiting all ſhoemakers from making ſhoes or boots with longer pikes under severe penalties. But even this was not ſufficient : it was neceſſary to denounce the dreadful ſentence of excommunication againſt all who wore ſhoes or boots with points longer than two inches. The preſent faſhion of ſhoes was introduced in 1633, but the buckle was not uſed till 1070.</p><p>In Norway they uſe ſhoes of a particular conſtruction, conſiſting of two pieces, and without heels ; in which the upper leather fits cloſe to the foot, the ſole being joined to it by many plaits or folds.</p><p>The ſhoes or flippers of the Japanese, as we are informed by Profeſſor Thunberg, are made of rice-ſtraw woven, but ſometimes for people of diſtinction of fine  slips of ratan. The ſhoe consists of a ſole, without upper leather or hind-piece ; forwards it is croſſed by a ſtrap, of the thickneſs of one’s finger, which is lined with linen ; from the tip of the ſhoe to the ſtrap a cylindrical string is carried, which passes between the great and ſecond toe, and keeps the ſhoe fast on the foot. As these ſhoes have no hind-piece, they make a noise, when people walk in them like flippers. When the Japaneſe travel, their ſhoes are ſurnished with three firings made of twiſted ſtraw, with which they are tied to the legs and feet, to prevent them from falling off. Some people carry one or more pairs of ſhoes with them on their journeys, in order to put on new, when the old ones are worn out. When it rains, or the roads ate very dirty, theſe ſhoes are ſoon wetted through, and one</p><p>continually ſees a great number of worn-out ſhoes lying on the roads, eſpecially near the brooks, where travellers have changed their ſhoes after waſhing their feet. Inſtead of theſe, in rainy or dirty weather they wear high wooden clogs, which underneath are hollowed out in the middle, and at top have a band acroſs like a ſtirrup, and a ſtring for the great toe ; ſo that they can walk without ſoiling their feet. Some of them have then ſtraw ſhoes ſaſtened to theſe wooden clogs. The Japaneſe never enter their houſes with their ſhoes on ; but leave them in the entry, or place them on the bench near the door, and thus are always barefooted in their houſes, ſo as not to dirty their neat mats. During the time that the Dutch live at Japan, when they are ſometimes under an obligation of paying visits at the houſes of the Japaneſe, their own rooms at the factory being likewiſe covered with mats of this kind, they wear, inſtead of the usual ſhoes, red, green, or black flippers, which on entering the houſe they pull off: however, they have stockings on, and ſhoes made of cotton ſtuff with buckles in them, which ſhoes are made at Japan, and can be waſhed whenever they are dirty. Some have them of black satin, in order to avoid waſhing them.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Shoe</hi><hi rend="italic"> of an Anchor,</hi> a ſmall block of wood, convex on the back, and having a small hole, ſuſfficient to contain the point of the anchor fluke, on the foreſide. It is used to prevent the anchor from tearing or wounding the planks on the ship's bow, when ascending or descending ; for which purpose the ſhoe slides up and down along the bow between the fluke of the anchor and the planks, as being preſſed cloſe to the latter by the weight of the former.</p><p><hi rend="italic">To </hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Shoe</hi><hi rend="italic"> an Anchor,</hi> is to cover the flukes with a broad triangular piece of plank, whose area or superficies is much larger than that of the flukes.

Conveniency requires that the barrel be as light as poſſible, at the same time it ought to posseſs that degree of ſtrength which will make it not liable to burst. Experience has proved, that a thin and light barrel, which is of equal thickneſs in every part oſ its circumference, is much less liable to burst than one which is conſiderably thicker and heavier, but which, from being badly filed or bored, is of unequal ſtrength in different places.</p><p>It is alſo of importance to determine of what length the barrel ought to be, in order to acquire that range which the ſportſman has occasion for. On this ſubject we have received the following information from an experienced ſportſman. We have, at different times, compared barrels of all the intermediate lengths between 28 and 40 inches, and of nearly the same caliber, that is to ſay, from 22 to 26 ; and theſe trials were</p></body></text></TEI>
