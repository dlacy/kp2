<p><span class="font1">building acts, not unlike those of modern London, were enacted by several of the emperors. These fixed the materials to be used,&nbsp;thickness of walls, minimum width of streets, maximum height&nbsp;allowed for houses, &amp;c. After the great fire in Nero’s reign, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">64, an act was passed requiring the lower storeys of houses to be&nbsp;built with fire-proof materials, such as peperino or burnt brick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Enormous accumulations of statues and pictures enriched Rome during its period of greatest splendour. In the first place, the&nbsp;numerous statues of the republican and even of the regal&nbsp;period were religiously preserved at a time when, from&nbsp;their archaic character, they must have been regarded&nbsp;rather as objects of sacred or archaeological interest than&nbsp;as works of art (Plin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">II.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxiv. 15 ff., xxxv. 19 ff.). Secondly&nbsp;came the large Graeco-Roman class, mostly copies of earlier Greek&nbsp;works, executed in Rome by Greek artists. 'Io this class belongs&nbsp;most of the finest existing sculpture preserved in the Vatican and&nbsp;other museums. Thirdly, countless statues and pictures were stolen&nbsp;from almost every important city in Greece, Magna Graecia, Sicily&nbsp;and western Asia Minor. These robberies began early, and were&nbsp;carried on for many centuries. The importations included works&nbsp;of art by all the chief artists from the £th century downwards.&nbsp;Long lists are given by Pliny </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(II.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxiii.-xxxvi.), and pedestals&nbsp;exist with the names of Praxiteles, Timarchus, Polyclitus, Bryaxis&nbsp;and others. These accumulated works of sculpture* were of all&nbsp;materials—gold and ivory (Suet. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tit.</span><span class="font1"> 2), of which seventy-four&nbsp;are mentioned in the catalogue of the Breviarium, many hundreds&nbsp;or even thousands of silver<sup>@@1</sup> (Plin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font1"> xxxiii. 151 f.), while&nbsp;those of gilt bronze and marble must have existed in almost untold&nbsp;numbers (Pans. viii. 46). Nor were the accumulated stores of&nbsp;Greek paintings much inferior in number; not only were easel&nbsp;pictures by Zeuxis, Apelles, Timanthes and other Greek, artists&nbsp;taken, but even mural paintings were carefully cut off their walls&nbsp;and brought to Rome secured in wooden frames (Plin. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">xxxv. 173, and compare </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ibid.</span><span class="font1"> 154).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The roads were made of polygonal blocks of lava </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(silex), </span><span class="font1">neatly fitted together and laid on a carefully prepared bed,&nbsp;similar to that used for mosaic paving (see Mosaic&nbsp;and Roads). Roads thus made were called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">viae&nbsp;stratae.</span><span class="font1"> A good specimen of Roman road-making, in which&nbsp;the blocks were fitted together with the utmost accuracy, is to&nbsp;be seen in a portion&nbsp;of the Clivus Capi-tolinus in front of the&nbsp;temple of Saturn (see&nbsp;fig- 5, which also shows&nbsp;the massive travertine&nbsp;curb which bordered&nbsp;the road; sometimes&nbsp;the curb was of lava).&nbsp;In 1901 the late and&nbsp;badly laid pavement of&nbsp;the Sacra Via on the&nbsp;ascent of the Velia&nbsp;was removed, and the&nbsp;earlier paving laid bare&nbsp;at a lower level. The&nbsp;original pavement of&nbsp;the Nova Via was exposed in 1904. Other&nbsp;well-preserved </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">viae&nbsp;stratae</span><span class="font1"> are those leading&nbsp;up to the Palatine from&nbsp;the Summa Sacra Via&nbsp;and that which follows&nbsp;the curved line of shops</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in Trajan’s forum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The following is a list of the chief roads which radiated from Rome:—(1) Via Appia issued from the Servian Porta Capena and the&nbsp;Aurelian P. Appia; from it diverged (2) Via Latina, which issued&nbsp;from the Aui*elian P. Latina; (3) Via Labicana and Q) Via Tiburtina&nbsp;issued from the Servian P. Esquilina; from (3) diverged (5) Via&nbsp;Praenestina at the double arcn of the Claudian aqueduct, now&nbsp;P. Maggiore, while (4) passed through the Aurelian P. Tiburtina;&nbsp;(6) Via Nomentana and (7) Via Salaria issued from the Servian&nbsp;P. Collina and passed respectively through the Aurelian P. Nomentana and P. Salaria; (8) Via Flaminia issued from the Servian&nbsp;P. Fontinalis, and was called Via Lata for the first half-mile or more,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">then passed through the Aurelian P. Flaminia; (9) Via Aurelia, from the Transtiberine P. Aurelia; (10) Via Portuensis, from the&nbsp;Transtiberine P.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Remains of Prehistoric Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is evident from recent discoveries that the site of Rome was inhabited at a very early period.<sup>@@2</sup> Flint implements and&nbsp;remains of the Bronze Age have been found on the Aventine&nbsp;and elsewhere; and from the Early Iron Age onwards we have&nbsp;a continuous archaeological record, owing to the discovery of&nbsp;ancient burial-places. In 1902 a very early necropolis was&nbsp;brought to light at the S.E. corner of the temple of Antoninus&nbsp;and Faustina, some 17 ft. below the level of the Forum. The&nbsp;graves contain either the ashes of cremated bodies placed in a&nbsp;large vessel </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(dolio),</span><span class="font1"> or skeletons buried either in a simple trench&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(fossa),</span><span class="font1"> a tufa sarcophagus or a tree-trunk. The cremation&nbsp;graves are the earlier, and none are later than the 6th century,&nbsp;while the oldest may be of the 9th; the pottery and other&nbsp;objects placed in the graves belong to the Early Iron Age. It&nbsp;is clear that this cemetery is earlier than the union of the&nbsp;Palatine and Quirinal settlements in one city (see below, p. 759).&nbsp;Other early cemeteries have been discovered on the Quirinal&nbsp;and Esquiline, which were in use from the beginning of the&nbsp;Iron Age down to the beginning of the historic period. The&nbsp;large necropolis on the Esquiline is cut in two by the “ Servian ”&nbsp;wall, which is evidently of later date. The later tombs contain&nbsp;objects of Etruscan, Phoenician and Greek manufacture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is no doubt that the earliest settlement bearing the name of Rome was on the Palatine hill,<sup>@@3 </sup>which was both easy&nbsp;of defence and possessed the means of communication with its neighbours in the proximity of the&nbsp;Tiber. The name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roma</span><span class="font1"> is said to mean “ river,”&nbsp;but this is uncertain. The Palatine is roughly square in outline, and the Roman antiquarians sometimes applied the name&nbsp;Roma Quadrata to the earliest settlement; but the term seems&nbsp;more properly to have applied to a sanctuary connected with&nbsp;the foundation of the city. The ideal boundary of the city&nbsp;was formed by the Pomerium (see Varro, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L.L.</span><span class="font1"> v. 143; Liv.&nbsp;i. 44; Dionys. i. 88), whose original course is traced by Tacitus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann.</span><span class="font1"> xii. 24). It passed along the foot of the hill </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(per ima&nbsp;montis Palatini), </span><span class="font1">the angle-points being given by the Ara&nbsp;Maxima in the Forum Boarium, the Ara Consi in the Circus&nbsp;Maximus, the Curiae Veteres (near the arch of Constantine)&nbsp;and the Sacellum Larum (at the N. angle). But this was of&nbsp;course not a defensible site, and the extent of the fortified city&nbsp;can only be determined by the traces of its early walls. These&nbsp;enable us to fix its line along the whole valley of the Velabrum,&nbsp;on the west of the hill, and along the valley of the Circus&nbsp;Maximus as far as the so-called Paedagogium, about half-way&nbsp;on the south side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Considerable remains of this fortification exist near the west angle of the hill. These show that the natural strength given by the&nbsp;cliff was increased by artificial means. The wall was set&nbsp;neither at the top nor at the foot of the hill, but more&nbsp;than half-way up, a level terrace or shelf all round being&nbsp;cut in the rock on which the base of the wall stood. Above&nbsp;that the hill was cut away into a cliff, not quite perpendicular but&nbsp;slightly <sup>44</sup> battering ” inwards, to give greater stability to the wall,&nbsp;which was built up against it, like a retaining wall, reaching to the&nbsp;top of the cliff, and probably a few feet higher. The stones used in&nbsp;this wall are soft tufa, a warm brown in colour, and full of masses of&nbsp;charred wood. The cutting to form the steep cliff probably supplied&nbsp;part of the material for the wall; and ancient quarries, afterwards&nbsp;used as reservoirs for water, exist in the mass of rock on which the&nbsp;so-called temple of Jupiter Victor stands. It has been asserted that&nbsp;these tufa blocks are not cut but split with wedges; this, however,&nbsp;is not the case. Tufa does not split into rectangular masses, but</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
