From a fervent admiration of poetry there is generally an easy transition to the composition of poems. He wrote many verses in his early youth ; and at the age of twenty, he printed an Ode on the Foundation of a Society for the Encouragement of the Arts of Painting and Design, in the town of Liverpool. About the same period he wrote a descriptive poem, entitled Mount Pleasant, which was not however published till the year 1777. His ode was then reprinted. These poems were favourably received ; and they obtained the approbation of two very competent judges, Mr Mason and Sir Joshua Reynolds.</p><p>Having completed his clerkship, he was in 1774 admitted an attorney of the Court of King’s Bench. During the same year, he entered into partnership with a Mr Bannister, but their connexion was of a very short duration. He afterwards formed a more permanent engagement with Mr Samuel Aspinall, who had long been known as a respectable practitioner. He was assiduous in his attention to the business of his profession ; but he did not find himself constrained to abandon his literary studies, and he thus continued the gradual improvement of his excellent talents. At an early period of his life, he became intimately acquainted with the family of a respectable tradesman named Griffies. Jane, the second of three daughters, “ soon attracted his admiration, and won his affection, by her gentle yet lively manners, by the sweetness of her disposition, and by the many admirable qualities of her truly feminine mind. Although the state of his circumstances at this time gave little promise of an immediate union with the object of his attachment, it was not the wish, and perhaps it was scarcely in the power, of one possessing the frank and ardent character of Mr Roscoe, to conceal from her the feelings she had inspired. From that moment, to the close of his long and eventful life, he never found reason to regret, for one instant, the judgment of his youth.” A considerable interval elapsed before they could prudently fulfil their engagement ; but his professional emoluments gradually became more ample, and they were married on the 22d of February 1781. Their union was attended with more than common felicity.</p><p>The African slave-trade was now in its fullest vigour ; hnd as it formed a very material part of the commerce of .Liverpool, the great body of the inhabitants were interested, either directly or indirectly, in the continuance of this detestable traffic. For any individual to raise a warning voice against it in such a community, required no small portion of moral courage. The generous feelings and manly character of Mr Roscoe urged him to take a very prominent share in those proceedings which finally led to its suppression ; a measure which reflected so much honour on that administration which included Fox, Grey, Holland, and Erskine. He composed, in blank verse, a poem entitled “ The Wrongs of Africa ;” of which the first part was published in 1787, and the second in 1788. It was translated into German by a clergyman named Kiihn. In 1787 he likewise published “ A general View of the African Slave Trade, demonstrating its Injustice and Impolicy : with Hints towards a Bill for its Abolition.” This seasonable tract was followed in 1788 by “ A Scriptural Refutation of a Pamphlet lately published by the Rev. Raymond Harris, entitled ‘ Scriptural Researches on the Licitness of the Slave Trade’: in four Letters from the Author to a Friend.” Harris was a clergyman of the established church, but had been educated for the popish priesthood. Such talents as he possessed were employed in an attempt to prove that slavery, as a system, has ob</p><p>tained the divine approval ; that God has sanctioned the principle of one portion of mankind treating another like beasts of burden. For his satisfactory refutation of this reverend apologist of such enormities, Mr Roscoe received the thanks of the London Abolition Committee. They likewise printed a new edition of his pamphlet, which was extensively circulated, and highly approved. In 1792 he published “ An Inquiry into the Causes of the Insurrection of the Negroes in the Island of St Domingo.” Of this insurrection the advocates of slavery had endeavoured to avail themselves, as a most powerful argument against the abolition ; and he therefore performed another important service by exposing the fallacies of their reasonings and inferences.</p><p>In other public transactions of that eventful period, he likewise felt a deep interest. On all subjects his sentiments were humane and liberal. With some of the most enlightened men of the kingdom, he contemplated the French revolution as a glorious event ; and his feelings of exultation were expressed in more than one poetical effusion. The atrocities which ensued were revolting to every well-constituted mind : but he still continued true to the great cause of civil and religious liberty, and in the midst of the apostacy of one party, and the phrensy of another, he continued to avow and to maintain those principles which established, and which alone can uphold the British constitution. The most conspicuous apostate of that period was Edmund Burke, who deserted his former principles and his former friends, and made a general declaration of war against all those who breathed an ardent wish for the political or social melioration of mankind. The powers of his eloquence were exerted, with a morbid and phren-sied fervour, against those who differed from him after he began to differ from himself; and when we consider that he was instrumental, beyond any other individual, in promoting war abroad, and despotism at home, it may without any breach of charity be affirmed, that his memory deserves the execration of posterity. In the year 1796 Roscoe published “ Strictures on Mr Burke’s Two Letters, addressed to a Member of the present Parliament.” Here he animadverts on the exaggerated statements of his adversary, and exposes the real object of his recent publications, the suppression of all liberal and independent speculation on the subject of politics. This famous orator was evidently disposed to acquiesce in the opinion of Bishop Horsley, that the people have nothing to do with the laws but to obey them. At an earlier period, 1791, Roscoe had printed a merry ballad concerning “ The Life, Death, and wonderful Achievements of Edmund Burke ;” and had adorned it with a frontispiece etched by himself, and representing Burke equipped like a knight-errant, and assaulting Fox in the House of Commons.</p><p>About this period his mind was vigorously devoted to an undertaking of a more important nature. The plan of preparing a biographical account of Lorenzo de’ Medici had occurred to him at a very early stage of his literary career. He long continued to collect books, and to amass materials ; and at the close of the year 1789, he communicated his design to his intimate friend Mr Clarke, who was then residing in Italy for the benefit of a milder climate. This gentleman had been engaged in commercial pursuits, but is said to have been skilled in ancient as well as modern literature. With great alacrity he undertook the task of exploring the archives and libraries of Florence, in quest of materials for the projected work ; and the author ac-knowjedged himself deeply indebted to the assistance which he had thus received. The sale of the Crevenna and Pi-nelli libraries enabled him to procure many rare books, for which he might otherwise have made a hopeless search. “ The Life of Lorenzo de Medici, called the Magnificent,” was at length published in the year 1796, in two volumes</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
