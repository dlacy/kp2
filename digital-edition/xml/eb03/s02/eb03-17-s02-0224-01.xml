called <hi rend="italic">Del Piombo,</hi> from an office in the lead mines given him by Pope Clement VII. was an eminent Venetian painter, born in 1485. He was firſt a diſciple of old Giovanni Bellino; continued his ſtudies under Giorgione; and having attained an excellent manner of colouring, went to Rome, where he inſinuated himſelf into the favour of Michael Angelo. He has the name of being the firſt who invented the art of preparing plaſter-walls for oil-painting; but was ſo ſlow and lazy in his work, that other hands were often employed to finiſh what he began. He died in 1547.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
