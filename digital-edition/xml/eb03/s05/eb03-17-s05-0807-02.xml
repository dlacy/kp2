view of the claſſification of ſtones. Here we will only make a few obſervations concerning their natural history.</p><p>As philoſophers have perplexed themſelves much about the origin and formation of the earth (a ſubject certainly far beyond the ken of the human intellect, at leaſt if we believe that it was made by the Almighty power of God), ſo they have alſo propoſed theories to explain the origin of ſtones. When philoſophers limit their inquiries within the boundaries of ſcience, where they are led by the ſober and ſafe conduct of obſervation and experiment, their concluſions may be ſolid and may be uſeful ; but when, throwing experiment and obſervation aside, they rear a theory upon an airy nothing, or upon a ſingle detached fact, their theories will vaniſh before the touch of true philoſophy as a romantic palace before the rod of the enchanter. Sometimes from whim, or caprice, or vanity, they attempt to confound every thing : They wiſh to prove that the ſoul is mere matter, that plants are animals, and that foſſils are plants, and thus would banish two subſtances, ſpirit and dead matter, entirely from the world ; as if the Author of Nature were actuated by ſordid views of parſimony in the works of creation, though we evidently see that a generous profuſion is one of the characteriſtic marks of theſe works. We leave the taſk of confounding the different claſſes of being to thoſe philosophers whoſe minds are too contracted to comprehend a great variety of being at one view, or who prefer novelty to every thing elle. We content ourſelves with the old opinion, that the ſoul is a ſpiritual ſubſtance; that plants are plants, and that ſtones are ſtones.</p><p>We have been led into theſe remarks by finding that ſome philoſophers ſay that ſtones are vegetables ; that they grow and increaſe in ſize like a plant. This theory, we believe, was firſt offered to the world by Μ. Tournefort, in the year 1702, after returning from his travels in the eaſt. It was founded on a curious fact. In ſurveving the labyrinth of Crete, he obſerved that the names which viſitors had engraved upon the rock were not formed of hollow but of prominent letters like baſſo relievos. He ſuppoſes that theſe letters were at firſt hollowed out by knives ; that the hollows have ſince been filled up by the growth of the ſtone ; and hense he concludes that ſtones vegetate. We wiſh we were fully assured of the fact that the letters were at firſt hollowed, before we attempt to account for their prominency. But even allowing the ſuppoſition to be true that they were at firſt hollow, we reply it is only a ſingle fact, and that it is altogether unphiloſophical to deduce a general ſyſtem from a ſingle fact.</p><p>In the <hi rend="italic">ſecond</hi> place, this protuberancy of the characters is very improperly called vegetation, for it is not produced by a proceſs in any reſpect like the vegetation of a plant. Vegetation ſuppoſes veſſels containing fluids and growth by expanſion ; but who ever heard of veſſels in a ſtone, of fluids moving in them, or of the different parts expanding and ſwelling like the branch or trunk of a tree ? Even the fact which Tournefort mentions proves nothing. He does not pretend to ſay, that the rock itſelf is increasing, but only that a few ſmall hollows are filled with new ſtony matter, which riſes a little above the ſurrounding ſurface of the rock. This matter evidently has been once liquid, and at length has congealed in the channel into which it had run.— But is not this eaſily explained by a common proceſs, the formation of ſtalactites? When water charged with calcareous matter is expoſed to the action of air, the water evaporates, and leaves the calcareous earth behind, which hardens and becomes like a ſtone.</p><p>Having thus examined the principal fact upon which Μ. Tournefort founds his theory, it is unneceſſary to follow him minutely through the rest of his ſubject.— He compares the accretion of matter in the labyrinth to the consolidation of a bone when broken, by a callus formed of the extravaſated nutritious juice. This obſervation is thought to be confirmed, by finding that the projecting matter of the letters is whitiſh and the rock itſelf greyiſh. But it is eaſy to find companions. The difficulty, as Pope ſays, is to apply them. The reſemblance between the filling up of the hollow of a ſtone, and the conſolidation of a broken bone by a callus, we confeſs ourſelves not philoſophers enough to ſee. Were we writing poetry in bad taſte, perhaps it might appear. The circumſtance, that the prominent matter of the letters is whitiſh, while the rock is greyiſh, we flatter ourſelves ſtrengthens our ſupposition that it consiſts of a depoſition of calcareous matter. Upon the whole, we conclude, we hope logically, that no ſuch theory as this, that ſtones are vegetables, can be drawn from the ſuppoſed fact reſpecting the labyrinth. We have to regret, that the account which we have ſeen of the ſubject is ſo imperfect, that we have not ſufficient materials for a proper inveſtigation. Tournefort has not even told us of what kind of ſtone or earth the accretion conſiſts; yet this single information would probably have decided the queſtion<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> To give a more diſtinct notion of Tournefort’s theory, we ſhall ſubjoin his concluſions : From theſe observations (he ſays) it follows, that there are ſtones which grow in the quarries, and of conſequence that are fed ; that the same juice which nouriſhes them ſerves to rejoin their parts when broken ; juſt as in the bones of animals, and the branches of trees, when kept up by bandages ; and, in a word, that they vegetate. There is, then (he ſays), no room to doubt but that they are organized ; or that they draw their nutritious juice from the earth. This juice muſt be firſt filtrated and prepared in their ſurface, which may be here eſteemed as a kind of bark ; and hence it muſt be conveyed to all the other parts. It is highly probable the juice which filled the cavities of the letters was brought thither from the bottom of the roots ; nor is there any more difficulty in conceiving this than in comprehending how the sap ſhould paſs from the roots of our largeſt oaks to the very extremities of their higheſt branches. Some ſtones, then (he concludes), muſt be allowed to vegetate and grow like plants : but this is not all ; (he adds), that probably they are generated in the ſame manner ; at leaſt, that there are abundance of ſtones whoſe generation is inconceivable, without ſupposing that they come from a kind of ſeeds, wherein the organical parts of the ſtones are wrapped up as thoſe of the largeſt plants are in their ſeeds.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi><pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0815.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0809"/>

Of theſe ſtones the ancients give us ſome account. Pliny says, that at Harpaſa, a town of Asia, there was a rock of ſuch a wonderful nature, that if touched with the finger it would ſhake, but could not be moved from its place with the whole force of the body<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><gap/> Lib. ii. <gap/></p></note> *. Ptolemy Hepheſtion mentions<note anchored="true" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><gap/> Lib. iii. <gap/></p></note> * a gygonian ſtone near the ocean, which was agitated when (truck by the (talk of an aſphodel. but could not be removed by a great exertion of force. The word <hi rend="italic">gygonius</hi> ſeems to be Celtic ; for <hi rend="italic">gwingog</hi> ſignifies <hi rend="italic">motitans,</hi> the rocking- ſtone.</p><p>Many rocking ſtones ate to be found in different parts of this iſland ; ſome natural, others artificial, or placed in their poſition by human art. In the pariſh of St Leven, Cornwall, there is a promontory called <hi rend="italic">Caſtle Treryn.</hi> On the western side of the middle group, near the top, lies a very large ſtone, ſo evenly poiſed that any hand may move it from one side to another ; yet it is ſo fixed on its baſe, that no lever nor any mechanical force can remove it from its preſent ſituation. It is called the <hi rend="italic">Lοgan-stone,</hi> and is at ſuch a height from the ground that no perſon can believe that it was raiſed to its preſent poſition by art. But there are other rocking ſtones, which are ſo ſhaped and ſo ſituated, that there can be no doubt but they were erected by human ſtrength. Of this kind Borlaſe thinks the great Quoit or <hi rend="italic">Kam-lehau,</hi> in the pariſh of Tywidnek, to be. It is 39 feet in circumference, and four feet thick at a medium, and ſtands on a single pedeſtal. There is alſo a remarkable ſtone of the same kind in the iſland of St Agnes in Scilly. The under rock A is 10 feet 6 inches high, 47 feet round the middle, and touches the ground with no more than half its baſe. The upper rock C reſts on one point only, and is ſo nicely balanced, that two or three men with a pole can move it. It is eight feet six inches high, and 47 in circumference. On the top there is a baſon D hollowed out, three feet eleven inches in diameter at a medium, but wider at the brim, and three feet deep. From the globular ſhape of this upper ſtone, it is highly probable that it was rounded by human art, and perhaps even placed on its pedeſtal by human ſtrength. In Sithney pariſh, near Helston, in Cornwall, flood the famous logan, or rocking ſtone, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Men Amber,</hi> q. d. <hi rend="italic">Men an Bar,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">top-stone.</hi> It was eleven feet by six and four high, and ſo nicely poiſed on another ſtone that a little child could move it, and all travellers who came this way deſired to ſee it. But Shrubſall, Cromwell’s governor of Pendennis, with much ado cauſed it to be undermined, to the great grief of the country. There are ſome marks of the tool on it, and, by its quadrangular ſhape, it was probably dedicated to Mercury.</p><p>That the rocking ſtones are monuments erected by the Druids cannot be doubted ; but tradition has not informed us for what purpoſe they were intended. Mr Toland thinks that the Druids made the people believe that they alone could move them, and that by a miracle ; and that by this pretended miracle they condemned or acquitted the accuſcd, and brought criminals to confeſs what could not otherwiſe be extorted from them. How far this conjecture is right we ſhall leave to thoſe who are deeply verſed in the knowledge of antiquities to determine.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sonorous</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Stone,</hi> a kind oſ ſtone remarkable for emitting an agreeable found when ſtruck, and much uſed in China for making musical inſtruments which they call king.</p><p>The various kinds of ſonorous ſtones known in China differ conſiderably from one another in beauty, and in the ſtrength and duration of their tone ; and what is very ſurpriſing, is, that this difference cannot be diſcovered either by the different degrees of their hardneſs, weight, or fineneſs of grain, or by any other qualities which might be ſuppoſed to determine it. Some ſtones are found remarkably hard, which are very ſonorous ; and others exceedingly ſoft, which have an excellent tone ; ſome extremely heavy emit a very ſweet ſound ; and there are others as light as pumice- ſtone which have alſo an agreeable ſound.</p><p>The chemiſts and naturaliſts of Europe have never yet attempted to diſcover, whether ſome of our ſtones may not have the same properties as the ſonorous ſtones of the extremities of Aſia. It however appears, that the Romans were formerly acquainted with a ſonorous ſtone of the claſs of <hi rend="italic">hiang-che.</hi> Pliny (says the Abbé du Bos, in his Reflections on Poetry and Painting, when ſpeaking of curious ſtones) obſerves that the ſtone called <hi rend="italic">chalcοphοnas,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">brazen ſound,</hi> is black ; and that, according to the etymology of its name, it sends forth a ſound much reſembling that of braſs when it is ſtruck. The paſſage of Pliny is as follows : <hi rend="italic">Chalcophonas nigra est ; sed elisa aeris tinnitum reddit.</hi></p><p>Some ſonorous ſtones were at length ſent into France, and the late Duke de Chaulnes examined them with particular attention. The following are ſome of his observations : “The Academy of Sciences, Mr Rome de Liſle, and ſeveral other learned mineralogiſts, when aſked if they were acquainted with the black ſtone of which the Chineſe king was made, for anſwer cited the paſſage of Pliny mentioned by Boethius de Bott, Linnaeus, and in the Dictionary of Bomare, and added what Mr Anderſon ſays in his Natural Hiſtory of Iceland reſpecting a bluiſh kind of ſtone which is very ſonorous. As the black ſtone of the Chineſe becomes of a bluiſh colour when filed, it is probably of the ſame species. None of the reſt who were conſulted had ever ſeen it. The Chineſe ſtone has a great reſemblance at first tight to black marble, and like it is calcareous ; but marble generally is not ſonorous. It alſo externally reſembles touchſtone, which is a kind of baſaltes, and the baſaltes found near volcanos ; but theſe two ſtones are vitrifications.”</p><p>The duke next endeavoured to procure ſome information from the ſtone-cutters. They all replied, that blue-coloured marble was very ſonorous, and that they had ſeen large blocks of it which emitted a very ſtrong ſound; but the duke having ordered a king to be conſtructed of this kind of ſtone, it was found that it did not poſſeſs that property. By trying the black marble of Flanders, a piece was at length found which emitted an agreeable ſound : it was cut into a king, which is almoſt as ſonorous as thoſe of China. All theſe obſerva-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0816.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0810"/>
tions give us reason to believe that the ſtones of which the king are formed are nothing elſe but a black kind of marble, the conſtituent parts of which are the ſame as thoſe of the marble of Europe, but that ſome difference in their organization renders them more or leſs ſonorous.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Swine-STONE (lapis suillus),</hi> or f <hi rend="italic">etid stone,</hi> ſo called from its exceſſively fetid ſmell, calcareous earth impregnated with petroleum. It is found, I.

One kind of clay resiſts the moſt violent action of the fire after being hardened to a certain degree, but is incapable of receiving a sufficient degree of hardneſs and ſolidity. A ſecond kind assumes a hardneſs reſembling that of flint, and ſuch a compactneſs that vessels made of it have a gloſſy appearance in their fracture reſembling porcelain. Theſe two ſpecies owe their peculiar properties of refitting heat without melting, to fand, chalk, gypſum or ferruginous earth, which they contain. A third ſpecies of clay begins to harden with a moderate fire, and melts entirely with a ſtrong fire. It is of the ſecond ſpecies that ſtone-ware is made.</p><p>The moſt famous manufactory of ſtone-ware, as well as of other kinds of pottery, is at Burſlem in Staffordſhire. This can be traced with certainty at leaſt two centuries back ; but of it3 first introduction no tradition remains.<note anchored="false" n="4" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Anderson's Commerce, vol. iv.</p></note> In 1686, as we learn from Dr Plot’s Natural Hiſtory of Staffordſhire publiſhed in that year, only the coarſe yellow, red, black, and mottled wares, were made in this country ; and the only materials employed for them appear to have been the different coloured clays which are found in the neighbourhood, and which form ſome of the meaſures or ſtrata of the coal-mines. Theſe coarſe clays made the body of the ware, and the glaze was produced by powdered lead- ore, ſprinkled on the pieces before firing, with the addition of a little manganeſe for ſome particular colours. The quantity of goods manufactured was at that time ſo inconſiderable, that the chief ſale of them, the Doctor ſays, was “ to poor crate-men, who carried them on their backs all over the country.”</p><p>About the year 1690, two ingenious artiſans from Germany, of the name of Eller, fettled near Burſlem, and carried on a ſmall work for a little time. They brought into this country the method of glazing ſtone- ware, by caſting ſalt into the kiln while it is hot, and ſome other improvements of leſs importance ; but finding they could not keep their ſecrets to themſelves, they left the place rather in diſguſt. From this time various kinds of ſtone-ware, glazed by the fumes of ſalt in the manner above-mentioned, were added to the wares before made. The white kind, which afterwards became, and for many ſucceeding years continued, the ſtaple branch of pottery, is ſaid to have owed its origin to the following accident. A potter, Mr Aſtbury, travelling to London, perceived ſomething amiſs with one of his horſe’s eyes, an hoſtler at Dunſtable ſaid he could ſoon cure him, and for that purpoſe put a common black flint ſtone into the fire. The potter obſerving it, when taken out, to be of a fine white, immediately conceived the idea of improving his ware by the addition of this material to the whiteſt clay he could procure : accordingly he ſent home a quantity of the flint ſtones of that country, where they are plentiful among the chalk, and by mixing them with tobacco- pipe clay, produced a white ſtone-ware much ſuperior to any that had been ſeen before.</p><p>Some of the other potters ſoon diſcovered the ſource of this ſuperiority, and did not fail to follow his example. For a long time they pounded the flint ſtones in private rooms by manual labour in mortars ; but many of the poor workmen ſuffered ieverely from the duſt of the flint getting into their lungs, and producing dreadful coughs, conſumptions, and other pulmonary diſorders. Theſe diſaſters, and the increaſed demand for the flint powder, induced them to try to grind it by mills of various conſtructions ; and this method being found both effectual and ſafe, has continued in practice ever ſince. With theſe improvements, in the beginning of the preſent century, various articles were pro* duced for tea and coffee equipages. Soon after attempts were made to furniſh the dinner table alſo ; and before the middle of the century, utenſils for the table were manufactured in quantity as well for exportation as home conſumption.</p><p>But the ſalt glaze, the only one then in uſe for thia purpoſe, is in its own nature ſo imperfect, and the potters, from an injudicious competition among themſelves for cheapneſs, rather than excellence, had been so inattentive to elegance of form and neatneſs of work- manſhip, that this ware was rejected from the tables of perſons of rank; and about the year 1760, a white ware, much more beautiful and better glazed than ours, began to be imported In conſiderable quantities from France.</p><p>This inundation of a foreign manufacture, ſo much ſuperior to any of our own, muſt have had very bad effects upon the potteries of this kingdom, if a new one, ſtill more to the public taſte, had not appeared ſoon after. In the year 1763, Mr Joſiah Wedgwood, who had already introduced ſeveral improvements into this art, invented a ſpecies of earthen ware for the table quite new in its appearance, covered with a rich and brilliant glaze, bearing ſudden alternations of heat and cold, manufactured with eaſe and expedition, and con- ſequently cheap, and having every requiſite for the purpoſe intended. To this new manufacture the queen was pleaſed to give her name and patronage, commanding it to be called Queen's <hi rend="italic">ware,</hi> and honouring the inventor by appointing him her majeſty’s potter.</p><p>The common clay of the country is uſed for the ordinary forts ; the finer kinds are made of clay from Devonſhire and Dorſetſhire, chiefly from Biddeford ; but the flints from the Thames are all brought rough by ſea, either to Liverpool or Hull, and ſo by Burton. There is no conjecture formed of the original rea-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0817.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0811"/>
ſon of fixing the manufacture in this ſpot, except for the convenience of plenty of coals, which abound under all the country.</p><p>The flints firſt are ground in mills, and the clay prepared by breaking, washing, and sifting, and then they are mixed in the requiſite proportions. The flints are bought firſt by the people about the country, and by them burnt and ground, and sold to the manufacturers by the peck.</p><p>The mixture is then laid in large quantities on kilns to evaporate the moiſture; but this is a nice work, as it muſt not be too dry ; next it is beat with large wooden hammers, and then is in order for throwing, and is moulded into the forms in which it is to remain : this is the moſt difficult work in the whole manufacture. A boy turns a perpendicular wheel, which by means of thongs turns a ſmall horizontal one, just before the thrower, with ſuch velocity, that it twirls round the lump of clay he lays on it into any form he directs it with his fingers.</p><p>There are 300 houſes which are calculated to employ, upon an average, twenty hands each, or 6000 in the whole ; but of all the variety of people that work in what may be called the preparation for the employment of the immediate manufacturers, the total number cannot be much short of 10,000, and it is increaſing every day. Large quantities are exported to Germany, Ireland, Holland, Russia, Spain, the Eaſt Indies, and much to America ; ſome of the fineſt sorts to France.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Stone</hi> <hi rend="italic">in the Bladder.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine,</hi> n⁰ 400. <hi rend="smallcaps">Survey</hi> <hi rend="italic">-Index ;</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Alkali,</hi> n⁰ 17, 18, 19.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stone,</hi> in merchandize, denotes a certain weight for weighing commodities.
