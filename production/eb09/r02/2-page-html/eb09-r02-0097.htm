<p><span class="font1">RICCI, Matteo (1552-1610), is eminent as practically the founder of Christian missions in modern China.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He was born of a noble family at Macerata in the March of Ancona on 7th October 1552, two months&nbsp;before Francis Xavier, burning with the desire to carry&nbsp;his message into China, died at its gates. After some&nbsp;education at a Jesuit college in his native town, Ricci, at&nbsp;the age of sixteen, was sent by his father to study law at&nbsp;Rome. But the youth had already contemplated entering&nbsp;the Jesuit Company, and this purpose he accomplished&nbsp;about 1571, without informing his father, of whose&nbsp;opposition he was aware, until the step had been taken.&nbsp;The father instantly started for Rome, but was stopped&nbsp;by illness, and abandoned opposition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1577 Ricci and several other Italian students of noble birth offered themselves for the East Indian missions ; and Ricci, without visiting his family to take leave,&nbsp;proceeded to Portugal. His comrades were Rudolfo&nbsp;Acquaviva, Nicolas Spinola, Francesco Pasio, and Michele&nbsp;Ruggieri, all afterwards, like Ricci himself, famous in the&nbsp;Jesuit annals. They arrived at Goa in September 1578.&nbsp;After four years spent in India, Ricci was summoned to&nbsp;the task of opening China to evangelization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Several attempts had been made by Xavier, and since his death, to introduce the church into China,—as by&nbsp;Melchior Nunes of the Jesuit society operating from&nbsp;Sanchian</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> in 1555; by Gaspar da Cruz, a Dominican, in&nbsp;that or the following year ; by the Augustinians under&nbsp;Martin Herrada, 1575; and in 1579 by the Franciscans&nbsp;led by Pedro d’Alfaro ; but all these attempts proved&nbsp;abortive. In 1571 a house of the Jesuits had been set&nbsp;up at Macao (where the Portuguese were established in&nbsp;1557), but their attention was then occupied with Japan,&nbsp;and it was not till the arrival at Macao of Alessandro&nbsp;Valignani on a visitation in 1582 that work in China was&nbsp;really taken up. For this object he had obtained the&nbsp;services first of M. Ruggieri and then of Ricci. After&nbsp;various disappointments they found access to Chau-king-fu on the Si-Kiang or West River of Canton, where the&nbsp;viceroy of the two provinces of Kwang-tung and Kwang-si&nbsp;then had his residence, and by favour of this personage&nbsp;they were enabled to establish themselves, and there spent&nbsp;several years. Their proceedings were very cautious and&nbsp;tentative ; they excited the curiosity and interest of even&nbsp;the more intelligent Chinese by their clocks, their globes&nbsp;and maps, their books of European engravings, and by&nbsp;Ricci’s knowledge of mathematics, including dialling and&nbsp;the like, and the projection of maps. They conciliated&nbsp;some influential friends, and their reputation spread pretty&nbsp;widely in China. This was facilitated by the Chinese&nbsp;system of transfer of public officers from one province of&nbsp;the empire to another, and in the later movements of the&nbsp;missionaries they frequently met with one and another of&nbsp;their old acquaintances in office, who were more or less&nbsp;well disposed. Eventually troubles arose at Chau-king&nbsp;which compelled them to seek a new locality ; and in&nbsp;1589, with the viceroy’s sanction, they migrated to Chang-chau in the northern part of Kwang-tung, not far from&nbsp;the well known Meiling Pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During his stay here Ricci was convinced that a mistake had been made in adopting a dress resembling that of the&nbsp;bonzes, thus identifying the missionaries with a class who&nbsp;were the objects either of superstition or of contempt.&nbsp;With the sanction of the visitor it was ordered that in&nbsp;future the missionaries should adopt the costumes of&nbsp;Chinese literates. And, in fact, they before long adopted&nbsp;Chinese manners altogether.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Chang-chau, as a station, did not prove a happy selection, but it was not till 1595 that an opportunity occurred of travelling northward. We cannot follow Ricci’s movements in detail, or the vicissitudes of favour and trouble&nbsp;which attended his plans. The latter were, on the whole,&nbsp;never very grave. For some time his residence was at&nbsp;Nan-chang-fu, the capital of Kiang-si ; but in 1598 he was&nbsp;enabled to proceed under favourable conditions to Nanking, and thence, for the first time, to Peking, which had&nbsp;all along been the goal of his missionary ambition. But&nbsp;circumstances were not then propitious, and the party had&nbsp;to return to Nanking. The fame of the presents which&nbsp;they carried had, however, reached the court, and the&nbsp;Jesuits were summoned north again, and on the 24th&nbsp;January 1601 they entered the capital. Wan-lieh, the&nbsp;emperor of the Ming dynasty, in those days lived in seclusion, and saw no one but his women and the eunuchs.&nbsp;But the missionaries were summoned to the palace ; their&nbsp;presents were immensely admired ; and the emperor had&nbsp;the curiosity to send for portraits of the fathers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">They obtained a settlement, with an allowance for subsistence, in Peking, and from this time to the end of his life Ricci’s estimation among the Chinese was constantly&nbsp;increasing, as was at the same time the amount of his labours.&nbsp;Visitors, who were never turned away, thronged the mission&nbsp;residence incessantly ; inquiries coming to him from all&nbsp;parts of the empire, from strangers as well as acquaintances, respecting the doctrines which he taught, or the&nbsp;numerous Chinese publications which he issued, had to be&nbsp;answered. This in itself was a great burden, as Chinese&nbsp;composition, if wrong impressions are to be avoided,&nbsp;demands extreme care and accuracy. As head of the&nbsp;mission, which now had four stations in China, he also&nbsp;devoted much time to answering the letters of the priests&nbsp;under him, a matter on which he spared no pains or detail.&nbsp;The new converts had to be attended to—always welcomed,&nbsp;and never hustled away. Besides these came the composition of his Chinese books, the teaching of his people, and&nbsp;the maintenance of the record of the mission history which&nbsp;had been enjoined upon him by the general of the order,&nbsp;and which he kept up to the most recent dates. Thus his&nbsp;labours were wearing and incessant. In May 1610 he&nbsp;broke down, and after an illness of eight days died on&nbsp;the 11th of that month, aged fifty-eight. His coadjutor&nbsp;Pantoja applied to the emperor for a burying-place outside&nbsp;the city. This, after due consideration by the boards&nbsp;concerned, was granted, with the most honourable official&nbsp;testimonies to the reputation and character of Ricci ; and&nbsp;a large building in the vicinity of the city was at the&nbsp;same time bestowed upon the mission for their residence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ricci’s character, his acquirements, and the use he made of them were certainly worthy of all honour. We do not know&nbsp;what amount of success in conversion had rewarded his labours&nbsp;during his life, hut some eminent and creditable converts there&nbsp;were, and his work was the foundation of the considerable spread&nbsp;which the Roman Catholic Church has since attained in China.&nbsp;When the missionaries of other Roman Catholic orders made their&nbsp;way into China, some twenty years after the death of Ricci, they&nbsp;found great fault with the manner in which certain Chinese&nbsp;practices had been dealt with by the Jesuits, a matter in which&nbsp;Ricci’s action and policy had given the tone to the mission in&nbsp;China,—though in fact that tone was rather inherent in the Jesuit&nbsp;system than the outcome of individual character, for controversies&nbsp;of an exactly parallel nature arose two generations later in southern&nbsp;India, between the Jesuits and Capuchins, regarding what were&nbsp;called “Malabar rites.” The controversy thus kindled in China&nbsp;burned for considerably more than a century with great fierceness,@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>and we can herfc, in connexion with the career of Ricci, but&nbsp;indicate its existence. The chief points of controversy were (1)&nbsp;the lawfulness and expediency of certain terms employed by the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
