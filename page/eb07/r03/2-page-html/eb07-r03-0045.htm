<p><span class="font1">Russians. Lewenhaupt had formed a sort of rampart with his waggons, but was obliged to set fire to them to prevent&nbsp;their falling into the hands of the Russians, while he retreated under cover of the smoke. The czar’s troops, however, arrived in time to save five hundred of these waggons,&nbsp;filled with provisions destined for the distressed Swedes. A&nbsp;strong detachment was sent to pursue Lewenhaupt ; but&nbsp;so terrible did he now appear, that the Russian general offered him an honourable capitulation. This was rejected&nbsp;with disdain, and a fresh engagement took place, in which&nbsp;the Swedes, now reduced to four thousand, again defeated&nbsp;their enemies, and killed five thousand on the spot. After&nbsp;this Lewenhaupt was allowed to pursue his retreat without&nbsp;molestation, though deprived of all his cannon and provisions.&nbsp;Prince MenzikofT was indeed detached with a body of forces&nbsp;to harass him on his march ; but the Swedes were now so&nbsp;formidable, even in their extremity, that Menzikoff dared not&nbsp;to attack them, so that Lewenhaupt with his four thousand&nbsp;men arrived safe in the camp of Charles, after having destroyed nearly thirty thousand of the Russians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This may be said to have been the last successful effort of Swedish valour against the troops of Peter. The difficulties which Charles’s army had now to undergo exceeded&nbsp;what human nature could support ; yet still they hoped by&nbsp;constancy and courage to subdue them. In the severest&nbsp;winter known for a long time, even in Russia, they made&nbsp;long marches, clothed like savages in the skins of wild&nbsp;beasts. All the draught-horses perished ; thousands of soldiers dropt down dead through cold and hunger ; and by&nbsp;the month of February 1709 the whole army was reduced&nbsp;to eighteen thousand. Amidst numberless difficulties these&nbsp;penetrated to Pultava, a town on the eastern frontier of the&nbsp;Ukraine, where the czar had laid up magazines, of which&nbsp;Charles resolved to obtain possession. Mazeppa advised the&nbsp;king to invest the place, in consequence of his having correspondence with some of the inhabitants, by whose means&nbsp;he hoped it would be surrendered. He was, however, de-cei ved. The besieged made an obstinate defence ; the Swedes&nbsp;were repulsed in every assault, and eight thousand of them&nbsp;were defeated, and almost entirely cut off, in an engagement&nbsp;with a party of Russians. To complete his misfortunes,&nbsp;Charles received a shot in his heel from a carabine, which&nbsp;shattered the bone. For six hours afterwards, he continued&nbsp;calmly on horseback, giving orders, till he fainted with the&nbsp;loss of blood ; after which he was carried into his tent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For some days the czar, with an army of seventy thousand men, had lain at a small distance, harassing the Swedish&nbsp;camp, and cutting off the convoys of provision ; but now intelligence was received that he was advancing as if with a&nbsp;design of attacking the lines. In this situation, Charles,&nbsp;wounded, distressed, and almost surrounded by enemies, is&nbsp;said to have, for the first time, assembled a grand council of&nbsp;war, the result of which was, that it was determined to march&nbsp;out and attack the Russians. Voltaire, however, asserts&nbsp;that the king did not relax one iota of his wonted obstinacy&nbsp;and arbitrary temper ; but that, on the 7th of July, he sent&nbsp;for General Renschild, and told him, without any emotion,&nbsp;to prepare for attacking the enemy next morning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The 8th of July 1709 is remarkable for the battle which decided the fate of Sweden. Charles, having left eight thousand men in the camp to defend the works and repel the sallies of the besieged, began by break of day to march against&nbsp;his enemies with the rest of the army, consisting of twenty-six thousand men, of whom eighteen thousand were Kozaks.&nbsp;The Russians were drawn up in tw*o lines behind their in-trenchments, the horse in front, and the foot in the rear,&nbsp;with chasms to suffer the horse to fall back in case of necessity. General Slippenbach was despatched to attack the&nbsp;cavalry, which he did with such impetuosity that they were&nbsp;broken in an instant. They, however, rallied behind the&nbsp;infantry, and returned to the charge with so much vigour,&nbsp;that the Swedes were disordered in their turn, and Slippen-bach was made prisoner. Charles was now carried in his '&nbsp;litter to the scene of confusion. His troops, re-animated by&nbsp;the presence of their leader, returned to the charge, and the&nbsp;battle became doubtful, when a blunder of General Creuk,&nbsp;who had been despatched by Charles to take the enemy in&nbsp;flank, and a successful manœuvre of Prince Menzikoff,&nbsp;decided the fortune of the day in favour of the Russiane.&nbsp;Creuk’s detachment was defeated, and Menzikoff, who had&nbsp;been sent by Peter with a strong body to post himself between the Swedes and Pultava, so as to cut off the communication of the enemy with their camp, and fall upon their&nbsp;rear, executed his orders with so much success as to intercept a corps de reserve of three thousand men. Charles had&nbsp;ranged his remaining troops in two lines, with the infantry&nbsp;in the centre, and the horse on the two wings. They had&nbsp;already twice rallied, and were now again attacked on all&nbsp;sides with the utmost fury. Charles in his litter, with a&nbsp;drawn sword in one hand, and a pistol in the other, seemed&nbsp;to be everywhere present; but new misfortunes awaited him.&nbsp;A cannon-ball killed both horses in the litter ; and scarcely&nbsp;were these replaced by a fresh pair, when a second ball&nbsp;struck the litter in pieces, and overturned the king. The&nbsp;Swedish soldiers, believing him killed, fell back in consternation. The first line was completely broken, and the second fled. Charles, though disabled, did every thing in his&nbsp;power to restore order ; but the Russians, emboldened by&nbsp;success, pressed so hard on the flying foe, that it was impossible to rally them. Renschild and several other general&nbsp;officers w<sup>,</sup>ere taken prisoners, and Charles himself would have&nbsp;shared the same fate, had not Count Poniatowski, father of&nbsp;the future favourite of Catherine IL, with five hundred horse,&nbsp;surrounded the royal person, and with desperate fury cut&nbsp;his way through ten regiments of the Russians. With this&nbsp;small guard the king arrived on the banks of the Dnieper,&nbsp;and was followed by Lewenhaupt with four thousand foot&nbsp;and all the remaining cavalry. The Russians took possession of the Swedish camp, where they found a prodigious&nbsp;sum in specie ; while Prince Menzikoff pursued the flying&nbsp;Swedes, and, as they were in want of boats to cross the&nbsp;Dnieper, obliged them to surrender at discretion. Charles&nbsp;escaped with the utmost difficulty, but at length reached&nbsp;Otchakof, on the frontiers of Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By this decisive victory, Peter remained in quiet possession of his new acquisitions on the Baltic, and was enabled to carry on, without molestation, the improvements which&nbsp;he had projected at the mouth of the Neva. His haughty&nbsp;rival, so long and so justly dreaded, was now completely&nbsp;humbled, and his ally the king of Poland was again established on his throne. During the eight years that had&nbsp;elapsed from the battle of Narva to that of Pultava, the&nbsp;Russian troops had acquired the discipline and steadiness of&nbsp;veterans, and had at length learned to beat their former&nbsp;conquerors. If Peter had decreed triumphal processions for&nbsp;his trifling successes at Azof, it is not surprising that he&nbsp;should commemorate by similar pageants a victory so glorious and so important as that of Pultava. He made his triumphal entry into Moscow for the third time, and the public rejoicings on this occasion far exceeded all that had before been witnessed in the Russian empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The vanquished Charles had, in the mean time, found a valuable friend in the monarch in whose territories he had&nbsp;taken refuge. Achmet II. who then filled the Ottoman&nbsp;throne, had beheld with admiration the warlike achievements </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the Swedish hero ; and, alarmed at the late successes of his rival, determined to afford Charles the most&nbsp;effectual aid. In 1711, the Turkish emperor assembled an&nbsp;immense army, and was preparing to invade the Russian&nbsp;territories, when the czar, having intimation of his design,&nbsp;and expecting powerful support from Cantemir, hospodar of&nbsp;Moldavia, a vassal of the Porte, resolved to anticipate the</span></p>
