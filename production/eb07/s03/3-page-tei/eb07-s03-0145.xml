Mr. Malcom takes the sistrum to be no better than a kind of rattle. Oiselius observes, that the sistrum is found represented on several medals, and on talismans.</p><p>SISTRUM, or <hi rend="italic">Cistrum,</hi> an ancient Egyptian musical in- strument of percussion. A similar instrument, consisting of moveable metal rods passing through holes in a metal plate, is used in modem military bands.</p><p>SISTERS, two small islands in the great southern ocean, lying in the strait between Van Dieman’s Land and the south-west coast of New Holland.</p><p>SISTERON, an arrondisement of the department of the Lower Alps in France, 341½ square miles in extent. It is divided into five cantons, which arc subdivided into fifty communes, containing in 1836, 26,643 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same name. It stands on the river Durance, where the Baech falls into that stream, at the foot of a rock on which is an ancient castle commanding a fine prospect. It is well built, and has a cathedral with a fine altar-piece. In 1836, it contained about 4546 inhabitants, who deal largely in wool, and cultivate almonds very extensively. Lat. 44. 11. 51. Long. 5. 51. 13. E.</p><p>SISYPHUS, in fabulous history, one of the descendants of Eolus, married Merope, one of the Pleiades, who bore him Glaucus. He resided at Epyra in Peloponnesus, and was a very crafty man. Others say, that he was a Trojan secretary, who was punished for discovering secrets of state; and others, that he was a notorious robber, who was killed by Theseus. All the poets, however, agree that he was pun- ished in Tartarus for his crimes, by rolling a great stone to the top of a hill, which constantly recoiled, and rolling down incessantly, renewed his labour.</p><p>SITANG, a large river of the Birman empire, province of Pegu, which rises in a range of mountains about the 20th degree of north latitude, and passing the ancient city of Pegu, falls into the gulf of Murtaban.</p><p>SITAR, an Indian musical instrument resembling the European guitar. Some writers maintain that the guitar, the lute, the violin, &amp;c., are all of oriental origin. The Indian <hi rend="italic">saringee</hi> is similar to the European violin.</p><p>SITOPHYLAX, Σ<hi rend="italic">ιτοφυλαξ</hi>, formed from <hi rend="italic">σιτος,</hi> corn, and <hi rend="italic">φυλαξ,</hi> keeper in antiquity, an Athenian magistrate, who had the superintendence of the corn, and was to take care that nobody bought more than was necessary for the provision of his family. By the Attic laws, particular persons were prohibited from buying more than fifty measures of wheat a man ; and that such persons might not purchase more, the sitophylax was appointed to see the laws properly execut- ed. It was a capital crime to prevaricate in it. There were fifteen of these <hi rend="italic">sitopylaces,</hi> ten for the city, and five for the Piræus.</p><p>SITTINGBOURNE, a town in the hundred of Milton, in the lathe of Scray, in the county of Kent, forty miles from London. It depends chiefly on the trade arising from its being on the great road from London to Dover. The inhabitants were in 1801, 1317 ; in 1811, 1362; in 1821, 1537; and in 1831, 2182.</p><p>SITTIVACCA, a small town in the island of Ceylon. It is separated from the king of Candy’s country by a large branch of the Malivaddy river. Long.80.13. E. Lat.7.2. N.</p><p>SITUS, in <hi rend="italic">Algebra</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Geometry,</hi> denotes the situation of lines, surfaces, and the like. Worfius delivers some things in geometry, which are not deduced from common analysis, particularly matters depending on the <hi rend="italic">situs</hi> of lines and figures. Leibnitz has even founded a particular kind of analysis upon it, called <hi rend="italic">calculus situs.</hi></p><p>SIUT, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Siout</hi>, a large town of Upper Egypt, situated on the western bank of the Nile, about half a mile from the river, with which it communicates by a canal, crossed by a bridge of three arches. The inhabitants are chiefly Copts,</p><p>who are extensively employed in the manufacture of blue cloth, with which they carry on a considerable trade, and likewise in earthenware, natoon, and opium. The surrounding country is very fertile, producing abundance of fruits ; great quantities of wheat, barley, dhourra, and hemp, are likewise raised. Siut is the rendezvous of the caravans which proceed from Egypt southwards into the interior of Africa, to Sennaar and Darfur, from which countries they bring slaves and gold. This town is supposed to be the ancient Lycopolis; but the only remarkable antiquity which it presents, consists in the excavations made in the neighbouring mountains. These are numerous, consisting of chambers, many of which are thirty feet in height, co- vered with hieroglyphics, and exhibiting symbolical figures. They were most probably formed for sepulchral purposes. The town is large and populous, and the extensive district attached is likewise thickly inhabited. The united population amounts to 200,000. The taxes are reckoned at L.40,000. Lat. 27. 13. 14. N. Long. 31. 13. 32. E.</p><p>SIVA, a name given by the Hindus to the Supreme Being, when considered as the avenger or destroyer. Sir William Jones has shown that in several respects the cha- racter of Jupiter and Siva are the same. As Jupiter overthrew the Titans and giants, so did Siva overthrow the Daityas, or children of Ditti, who frequently rebelled against heaven ; and as during the contest the god of Olympus was furnished with lightning and thunderbolts by an eagle, so Brahma, who is sometimes represented riding on the Garuda, or eagle, presented the god of destruction with fiery shafts. Siva also corresponds with the Stygian Jove, or Pluto ; for, if we can rely on the Persian translation of the Bhágavat, the sovereign of Pátála, or the infernal regions, is the king of serpents, named Seshanaga, who is exhibited in painting and sculpture, with a diadem and sceptre, in the same manner as Pluto. There is yet another attribute of Siva, or Mahádéva, by which he is visibly distinguished in the drawings and temples of Bengal. To destroy, accord- ing to the Vedantis of India, the Sufis of Persia, and many philosophers of our European schools, is only to generate and reproduce in another form. Hence the god of destruction is holden in this country to preside over generation, as a symbol of which he rides on a white bull. Can we doubt that the loves and feats of Jupiter Genitor, not forgetting the white bull of Europa, and his extraordinary title of Lapis, for which no satisfactory reason is commonly given, have a connection with the Indian philosophy and mythology ?</p><p>SIVANA <hi rend="smallcaps">Samurda, </hi>an island formed by the river Ca- veny, in the province of north Coimbetoor, about nine miles in length, by one in breadth. It is remarkable for an uncommon grand cataract near it ; and it communicates with the continent by a bridge formerly magnificent, and three hundred yards in length, but is now in ruins.</p><p>SIWAH, a considerable oasis of the Lybian desert, on the route from Egypt to Fezzan, and the most interesting island of the waste, as being the supposed site of the temple of Jupiter Ammon. It is situated in latitude 29° 12' north, and longitude 26° 5' east. Horneman represents it as fifty miles in circumference ; but subsequent travellers have reduced its dimensions to about one half of that. The nearest distance from the river does not exceed 120 miles. Date trees cover a large portion of the soil, which is extremely fertile ; but the palm, pomegranate, olive, vine, fig, apricot, plum, and even apple, flourish in the gardens. Tepid saline springs are numerous throughout the district ; and shocks of earthquakes are here frequently felt. The town of Si- wah is built upon a steep conical rock, and both in external aspect and internal arrangement, presents a striking and singular appearance. The streets are narrow, crooked, and so dark, that artificial light is required at noon-day. Each house has several floors, the upper communicating with the</p></body></text></TEI>
