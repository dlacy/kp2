It originates in the government of Tver, near the village of Volgo Verkovie, in the forest of Volkouski, in north latitude 57° V 37". It traverses Lakes Steij, Peno, and Volga, and on receiving the waters of Lake Seligher, it becomes navigable, and falls into the Caspian Sea by eight principal arms, which have in all sixty-five mouths, forming about seventy islands. It has a number of tributaries, the principal of which, on the left, is the Kama, or Little Volga, which has a course of about a thousand miles in length. Before the Volga receives the Kama, the rivers Tverza, Mologa, Ounja, Vetlouga, and others, join it on the left; and on the right the Oka, which descends from the water-shed where the Don and the Dnieper originate. The Soura, which flows from the mountains of Volga, is another large tributary, which joins it on the right. The Volga is nearly two thousand miles in length. Its breadth at Astracan, where it embraces many islands, is nearly five leagues at the greatest height of the water. The depth of its waters varies from seven to eighteen feet. In the winter it is covered with ice throughout its whole extent, but there are always many apertures in the south, from which currents of air escape, and hence they are termed the lungs of the Volga. During summer the Volga is crowded with thousands of boats, constructed in the well-wooded countries of Northern Russia, and bearing down from the interior all kinds of commodities. Their return being difficult, they are generally broken up and sold at Astracan. This noble river is the principal commercial road of the interior of the Russian empire. It encircles the central table-land, receiving, as we have seen, the Oka, the principal river in this fertile region. It communicates in the upper part of its course by the canal ofVichnei-Volotchock, with the Lakes Ladoga and Onega; and, lastly, the Kama conveys to it all the waters of Eastern Russia. “ The town of Astracan,” says Malte-Brun, “ may be supposed an Alexandria on a Scythian Nile, but the river enters an inland sea; it does not communicate with the ocean, and the countries which it waters are inhabited by barbarous nations; still, however, the advantages which human industry may derive from the majestic courses of the Volga and the Danube are not as yet realized.” The term “ barbarous” is' now scarcely merited. 2. The Ural, or Oural, so called in conformity to a decree of Catherine II. It descends from the eastern declivities of the mountains bearing the same name, and flowing in a smooth channel sufficiently deep for small vessels, traces for a considerable distance the eastern and southern frontiers of the government of Orenburg, and the eastern limits of Europe. On the right it receives the Sakmara, on the left the llek, and after a course of above a thousand miles falls into the Caspian near Gouriev. 3. The Terek. This stream rises at the base of the Kazbek; receives on the right the rivers Songa and Aksai, on the left the Ourong, Tcherek, Bekhar, and Malka; and enters the Caspian by three principal mouths, between the Gulfs of Kouma and Agrakhan.</p><p>On the declivity of the Frozen Ocean we have, 1. the Petchora, which rises in the Ural mountain range, and traverses the most solitary deserts of Russia, the governments of Archangel and Vologda. Its steep calcareous banks are broken by caverns and ravines; and hence its name Pet-choran, which in the Russian language signifies caverns. After receiving, amongst other tributaries, the Oussa on the right and the Tyra on the left, it falls into the Arctic Ocean in north latitude 67° 10', its mouths forming an immense estuary. The length of its course is about 670 miles. 2. The Mezen, which originates in some bogs in the government of Vologda, and after a course of five or six hundred miles discharges itself into a bay of the same name on the shores of the White Sea, almost under the polar circle. 3.' The Dvina, which name the rivers Soukhona and Joug receive after their junction near Weliki-Oust-Joug. The Soukhona flows from Lake Koubinskoe, in the government of Vologda; it is united with Lake Bielo by means of a canal, and also with the rivers Volga and Neva in the same manner. The Joug rises in the same government, but is a much smaller stream. The Dvina does not assume the dimensions of a large river till after the junction of the Vychegda, which falls into it on the right. The latter is united with the Volga by means of Catherine’s Canal. Near Khol-mogory it divides into several arms, and after a course of above 700 miles falls into a gulf of the same name. Its mouth is greatly obstructed by a bar of mud. 4. The Onega, which is the outlet of several lakes, but not that of Onega, although it be situated in the neighbourhood. There are other rivers which fall into the White Sea and Arctic Ocean, but none of them are of any great moment.</p><p>The declivity of the Baltic Sea contains a variety of rivers.</p><p>1.    The Torneo, or Tornea. It originates in Swedish Lap-land, and, after the confluence of its great tributary the Muonio, down to its embouchure in the Baltic Sea, it forms the boundary between Russia and Sweden. The Muonio, likewise, traces for some distance the limit of the empire on this side. The Tornea has a course of about 280 miles.</p><p>2.    The Neva, in several respects a remarkable river. “ The Neva,” says Colonel Jackson, @@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> “ though it be called a river, is more properly a bosphorus or strait. Its length, from Schlusselburg, at the south-west angle of the Ladoga Lake, to its mouth, is sixty-nine versts; its direction that of a straight line from east to west; its medium breadth about 1500 feet; and its depth, in many places considerable, is generally in the channel about fifty feet. The water of the Neva is remarkably pure, and though the first use of it by strangers generally produces slight diarrhoea, yet it is very wholesome and extremely palatable. This fine river is the grand and only outlet for the superabundant waters of four great basins, each of which has an extensive natural reservoir of its own. These reservoirs are the Lakes Onega, Ilmen, Salma, and Ladoga; the latter receiving the drains of the other three. Ten different streams flow into the Onega, whose length from north to south is 190 versts, and its breadth from east to west seventy versts. It discharges into the Ladoga by the Sveer, a river 202 versts long, and of very unequal breadth. The Rmen is fifty-five versts long from north-east to south-west, and about thirty wide from north-west to south-east. It receives eleven streams, and has its outlet into the Ladoga by the Volkoff, 206 versts long, with a medium breadth of 1400 feet. The Saima, which is rather a collection of lakes, of gulfs, and bays, of all shapes and sizes, communicating with each other, than a regularly-formed and single sheet of water, is estimated by Peter Friccius at 130 versts long in the direction of west-south-west to east-north-east, and 120 from north to south ; but on the Swedish side it is about 280 versts more. It pays its tribute to the Ladoga by means of the Voksha or Voxa, a river about 180 versts long, and not navigable in consequence of its several cascades, of which the most considerable, that of Imatra, has a fall of upwards of thirty-two feet. Besides the Sveer, Volkoff, and the Voxa, the Ladoga receives the waters of thirteen other streams. This, the largest lake of Europe, is about 175 versts long and 105 broad, and of an oval form. The surfaces of the four lakes are thus estimated. The Onega, 430 leagues, of 25 to a degree; the Ilmen, 36 ; the Sai'ma, 210 ; and the Ladoga, 830 degrees.” At St Petersburg the Neva di-</p><p>@@@ Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. v. part i. p. 1.
