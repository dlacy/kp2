<p><span class="font2">any active part in the administration of affairs. It is well known that Catherine never admitted him to any participation of power, and kept him in a state of the most abject&nbsp;and mortifying separation from court, and in almost total&nbsp;ignorance of the affairs of the empire. Although by his&nbsp;birth he was generalissimo of the armies, president of the&nbsp;admiralty, and grand admiral of the Baltic, he was never&nbsp;permitted to head even a regiment, and was interdicted&nbsp;from visiting the fleet at Cronstadt. From these circumstances, it is evident that the empress either had conceived&nbsp;some jealousy of her son, or saw in him some mental imbecility, which appeared to her to disqualify him for the arduous concerns of government. There is little doubt, from&nbsp;the circumstances which distinguished his short reign, that&nbsp;Catherine had been chiefly influenced in her treatment of&nbsp;the grand duke by the latter consideration. There were&nbsp;certainly times at which Paul displayed evident marks of&nbsp;insanity, though he occasionally gave proofs of a generous&nbsp;and tender disposition, and even of intellectual vigour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is generally believed that, a short time before her death, Catherine committed to Plato Zuboff, her last favourite, a declaration of her will, addressed to the senate,&nbsp;desiring that Paul should be passed over in the succession,&nbsp;and that on her death the Grand Duke Alexander should&nbsp;ascend the vacant throne. As soon as Zuboff was made&nbsp;acquainted with the sudden death of the empress, he flew&nbsp;to Pavlovsk, about twenty-three miles from St Petersburg,&nbsp;where Paul occasionally resided ; but meeting the grand&nbsp;duke on the road, he, after a short explanation, delivered&nbsp;up the important document. Paul, charmed with his zeal&nbsp;and loyalty, rewarded the favourite, by permitting him to&nbsp;retain the wealth and honours which had been heaped on&nbsp;him by his mistress, while a general and rapid dispersion&nbsp;soon took place among the other adherents </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">the late sovereign. On the day following the death of his mother, Paul&nbsp;made his public entry into St Petersburg, amidst the acclamations of all ranks of people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the first measures adopted by the new emperor excited considerable surprise, and divided the opinions of&nbsp;the public with respect to the motives by which it had been&nbsp;suggested; some attributing it to his respect for the memory of his late father, and others to a culpable reflection&nbsp;on that of his mother. He ordered the corpse of Peter III.&nbsp;to be removed from the sepulchre in which it had been&nbsp;deposited in the church of St Alexander Nefsky, solemnly&nbsp;crowned it, and caused it to lie in state for three weeks, while&nbsp;it was watched day and night by the only two remaining&nbsp;conspirators who had assisted at his assassination. After this&nbsp;dreadful mark of his justice on the murderers of his father,&nbsp;surely more terrible to the guilty mind than death itself, he&nbsp;consigned the ashes to the sepulchre of Catherine II. in the&nbsp;cathedral of St Peter and St Paul, obliging the assassins to&nbsp;walk in the procession as chief mourners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Few political events of any importance marked the reign of Paul previously to the year 1798, when, in consequence&nbsp;of a treaty between him and the emperor of Germany, a&nbsp;Russian army of forty-five thousand men, under Field-Marshal Suwaroff, joined the imperialists in the Austrian territories in Italy. The progress of Suwaroff, his successes over&nbsp;Moreau, and his final recall by his master, have already been&nbsp;related in the article France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1799, Paul entered into a treaty of offensive and defensive alliance with his Britannic majesty. This treaty was signed at St Petersburg on the 22d of June, having&nbsp;been preceded by a provisional treaty between the same&nbsp;powers at the end of the year 1798. By the latter, which&nbsp;was fortified by a relative treaty with Austria, it had been&nbsp;stipulated that Paul should assist the king of Prussia, if the&nbsp;latter could be persuaded to join his arms to the allied&nbsp;powers against France, with forty-five thousand men, and&nbsp;that the king of Great Britain should pay to Russia a subsidy of L.75,000 sterling per month ; and in case the king&nbsp;of Prussia should refuse to join the coalition, the same number of troops, in consideration of the same subsidy, should&nbsp;be employed, as occasion might require, to assist the common cause. By the new treaty, the emperor of Russia, instead of the forty-five thousand troops, engaged to furnish&nbsp;seventeen thousand five hundred and ninety-three, with the&nbsp;necessary artillery, to be employed in an expedition against&nbsp;Holland ; and six ships, five frigates, and two transports,&nbsp;for the purpose of transporting part of the invading army&nbsp;from Britain to the continent. In consideration of these&nbsp;succours, the court of London engaged to advance to Russia a subsidy of L.44,000 sterling per month ; to pay the&nbsp;sum of L.58,929. 10s. sterling for the expenses of equipping&nbsp;the fleet; and after the period of three months had elapsed&nbsp;from such equipment, to pay a further subsidy of L. 19,642.&nbsp;10s. sterling per month, as long as the fleet should remain&nbsp;under the command of his Britannic majesty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In consequence of this treaty, a Russian fleet joined that of Britain in Yarmouth Roads, and took part in the unfortunate expedition to the coast of Holland, which was undertaken in the summer of 1799. The military fame of Russia&nbsp;was more augmented by the share which its army under Suwaroff took in the campaign of Italy during the same year,&nbsp;although the victories which won for the veteran his name&nbsp;of Italinski were far more than overbalanced by the misfortunes which ensued in Switzerland under the emperor’s&nbsp;favourite Korsakoff. But in December 1800, Paul, after&nbsp;having laid an embargo on the British shipping which lay&nbsp;in his ports, openly abandoned his relations with our country, and proclaimed, in confederacy with Sweden and Denmark, to whom Prussia afterwards added herself, the great&nbsp;Northern Coalition with France against Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the beginning of the year 1801, all Europe was astonished or amused by a paragraph which appeared in the Hamburg Gazette of the 16th of January. It was dated from&nbsp;Petersburg, the 30th December 1800, and is as follows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">“ We learn from Petersburg, that the emperor of Russia, finding that the powers of Europe cannot agree among themselves, and being desirous to put an end to a war which&nbsp;has desolated it-for eleven years past, intends to point out&nbsp;a spot to which he will invite all the other sovereigns, to&nbsp;repair and fight in single combat; bringing with them, as&nbsp;seconds and squires, their most enlightened ministers and&nbsp;their most able generals, such as Messrs Thugot, Pitt,&nbsp;and Bernstorff; and that the emperor himself proposes being attended by Generals Cotint de Pahlen and Khutosof.&nbsp;We know not if this report be worthy of credit; however,&nbsp;the thing appears not destitute of some foundation, and&nbsp;bears strong marks of what he has been often taxed with.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This paragraph was immediately copied or translated into all the public papers, and it was strongly affirmed by many&nbsp;that it was the composition of Paul himself. This has since&nbsp;been confirmed by the poet Kotzebue, who was employed&nbsp;by the emperor of Russia to translate the original into German, for the express purpose of its being inserted in the&nbsp;Hamburg Gazette. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> This paragraph is such a curious </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">morceau</span><span class="font1"> of witty insanity, that we shall here give the original French, as written by Paul himself, and published by Kotzebue in his account of his exile into Siberia. “ On apprend de Petersbourg. que l’Empereur de Russie, voyant que les puissances de l’Europe ne pouvoient s’accorder entr'elles, et voulant mettre fin a une guerre qui la désoloit depuis onze ans, vouloit proposer un lieu où il inviteroit tous les autres Souverains, de se rendre et y combattre en champ clos, ayant avec&nbsp;eux pour écuyers juges de camp et heros des armes leurs ministres les plus éclairés et les généraux les plus habiles, tels que MM.&nbsp;Thugot, Pitt, Bernstorff ; lui-même se proposant de prendre avec lui les généraux C. de Pahlen et Khutosof. On ne sqait si on&nbsp;doit y ajouter foi ; toutefois, la chose ne paroit pas destituée de fondement, en portant l’empreinte de ce dont il a souvent été taxé.”</span></p>
