<p><span class="font0">The following accounts of other collections of records are necessarily less detailed :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Privy Council Office.—The registers of the Privy Council are still preserved in that office, with the exception of a few volumes&nbsp;which have strayed into other places. J. R. Dasent has edited for&nbsp;the Master of the Rolls a series of volumes containing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Acts of&nbsp;the Privy Council,</span><span class="font0"> from 1542 to 1604. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Proceedings and Ordinances&nbsp;of the Privy Council,</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">10 Rich. II.-33 Henry VIII.,</span><span class="font0"> edited for the&nbsp;Record Commission by Sir N. Harris Nicolas, are from documents&nbsp;in the Cotton MSS. and from transcripts made by Rymer from&nbsp;documents then at the Pells Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">India Office.—The records of the India Office are preserved there. Complete printed lists exist for the whole collection, and&nbsp;the following documents have been published: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The First Letter Book&nbsp;of the East India Company,</span><span class="font0"> edited by Sir G. Birdwood and W.&nbsp;Foster; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters received by the East India Company from its Servants&nbsp;in the East,</span><span class="font0"> edited by F. C. Danvers and W. Foster (6 vols.). The&nbsp;records in India may be mentioned here. Each presidency and&nbsp;each province keeps its own; and this is the case also with the&nbsp;smaller subdivisions No printed lists appear to exist for any of&nbsp;the collections. The following volumes have been published :&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters, Despatches and other Papers of the Foreign Department of&nbsp;the Government of India, 1772-85,</span><span class="font0"> edited by G. W. Forrest (3 vols.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Calcutta); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bengal 1756-I757,</span><span class="font0"> edited by S. C. Hill (3 vols. 1905); and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Old Fort William,</span><span class="font0"> edited by C. R. Wilson (3 vols., 1906-7).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Public Record Office of Ireland was established in 1867 by the Act 30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. 70, when the records of the various&nbsp;courts of law, all wills proved in Ireland, and certain financial&nbsp;records, were collected into one building. The State Paper Office&nbsp;remains a separate, though subordinate, department in one of the&nbsp;towers of Dublin Castle, whence the papers are only transferred to&nbsp;the Record Office by special order. The Deputy Keeper of the&nbsp;Irish Record Office publishes yearly reports with appendices. The&nbsp;most important calendar published in these is that oí </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fiants</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;warrants for the issue of letters under the Great Seal, Henry VIII.&nbsp;to Elizabeth, contained in Reports 7-9, 11-13, 15-18, with indices&nbsp;for each reign. A calendar of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deeds</span><span class="font0"> of Christ Church, Dublin,&nbsp;is contained in the 20th, 23rd, 24th and 27th Reports. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wills</span><span class="font0"> of the diocese of Dublin, down to the year 1800, are indexed under&nbsp;the names of the testators in the 26th and 30th Reports. The&nbsp;series of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Proclamations</span><span class="font0"> by the lord lieutenant and council, and by&nbsp;the crown, which is among the records in the Record Tower of&nbsp;Dublin Castle, is catalogued in the 23rd and 24th Reports. Of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">financial</span><span class="font0"> records very little has been published. In the 33rd Report&nbsp;there is a good account of the Books of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treasury</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Accounting&nbsp;Departments</span><span class="font0"> from the reign of Henry VIII. Scattered entries&nbsp;from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pipe Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (13 Henry III.-33 Edward I.) are printed in&nbsp;the 33rd and 35th-38th Reports. Before the establishment of the&nbsp;Record Office the Irish Record Commission published a Latin&nbsp;calendar of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Patent </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Close Rolls</span><span class="font0"> from Henry II. to Henry VII.,&nbsp;and an incomplete calendar in English for the years 5-35 Henry&nbsp;VIII. Under the authority of the Master of the Rolls a calendar&nbsp;was published for the period Henry VIII. to Elizabeth, upon which&nbsp;some severe comments will be found in J. T. Gilbert’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The History . . .&nbsp;of the Public Records of Ireland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An English calendar for the reign of James I. was published by the Record Commission; and a calendar for the years 1-8 Charles&nbsp;L, under the authority of the Master of the Rolls. Two large folio&nbsp;volumes entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Liber Hibernie</span><span class="font0"> should here be mentioned. The&nbsp;history and contents of this astounding work can be gathered from&nbsp;its introduction, and from an index to it in the 9th Report. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitions post mortem</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">on attainder,</span><span class="font0"> for the provinces of Leinster&nbsp;and Ulster only, are dealt with in the Record Commission’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitionum in officio Rotulorum Cancellarie Hibernie asservatarum Repertorium.</span><span class="font0"> Of strictly </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judicial</span><span class="font0"> records the Record Office has published one&nbsp;volume of an admirable calendar of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Justiciary Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (1295-1303).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The records of the kingdom are deposited in several places in Edinburgh. The principal repository is the General Register&nbsp;House, at present governed by the Act 42 &amp; 43 Vict. c. 44.&nbsp;But certain records of the chancery and all the records of the court&nbsp;of teinds are in separate repositories. A general account of these&nbsp;records is given in M. Livingstone’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Guide to the Public Records of&nbsp;Scotland deposited in II.M. General Register House, Edinburgh,</span><span class="font0"> with&nbsp;appendices describing those contained in other repositories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary.</span><span class="font0">—The Record Commission of Great Britain published </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Acts of the Parliament of Scotland</span><span class="font0"> (1124-1707), a&nbsp;text derived from many sources described in the introductory&nbsp;volume; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Acts of the Lords Auditors of Causes and Complaints&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1466-1494), being the proceedings of the parliamentary committee&nbsp;for hearing petitions; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Acts of the Lords of Council</span><span class="font0"> (1478-1495), being proceedings of a similar body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Privy Council.—</span><span class="font0">The register of the Privy Council of Scotland from 1545 is in course of publication at the General Register House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Exchequer.—</span><span class="font0">The Exchequer Rolls, corresponding to the Great Roll of the English Exchequer, are being printed in full from 1264&nbsp;at the General Register House; and the accounts oí the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Treasurer&nbsp;of Scotland</span><span class="font0"> from 1473 are being published at the same office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chancery.—</span><span class="font0">The enrolments of letters issued under the Great Seal oí Scotland are contained in twelve rolls and a series of&nbsp;volumes. The Record Commission printed these registers in full&nbsp;for the period 1306-1424; and the General Register House is&nbsp;continuing the publication in an abridged form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Court of Chancery.</span><span class="font0">—Only the enrolments of letters under the</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font0">Great Seal are transferred to the General Register House; the remainder&nbsp;are preserved in the court oí chancery. The most important of&nbsp;these are the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Retours to Chancery.</span><span class="font0"> To these the only printed&nbsp;means of reference is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitionum</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ad capellam Domini Regis&nbsp;retornatarιιm abbreviatio</span><span class="font0"> (16th and 17th centuries), published by&nbsp;the Record Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Local Records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To deal with the municipal and local records of Great Britain in any detail is quite impossible in this article. Fortunately the&nbsp;admirable work of C. Gross, entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Bibliography of Municipal&nbsp;History</span><span class="font0"> (Harvard Historical Studies), contains a complete account&nbsp;of the work done on municipal records up to 1897; while the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font0"> of the Committee appointed to inquire as to the existing&nbsp;arrangements for the collection and custody of local records (1902)&nbsp;affords a complete view of the questions dealt with by it.</span></p>
