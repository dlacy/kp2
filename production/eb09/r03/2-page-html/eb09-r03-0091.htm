        <p><span class="font1">to which the European half of the empire was becoming barbarized. The
                policy which had been inaugurated by&nbsp;Augustus himself of settling barbarians
                within the frontiers&nbsp;had been taken up on a larger scale and in a more
                systematic&nbsp;way by the Illyrian emperors of the 3d century, and
                was&nbsp;continued by their successors in the 4th. In Gaul, in the&nbsp;provinces
                south of the Danube, even in Macedon and Italy,&nbsp;large barbarian settlements had
                been made—Theodosius&nbsp;in particular distinguishing himself by his liberality in
                this&nbsp;respect. Nor did the barbarians admitted during the 4th&nbsp;century
                merely swell the class of half-servile coloni. On&nbsp;the contrary, they not only
                constituted to an increasing&nbsp;extent the strength of the imperial forces, but
                won their&nbsp;way in ever-growing numbers to posts of dignity and&nbsp;importance
                in the imperial service. Under Constantine&nbsp;the palace was crowded with
                    Franks.@@<sup>1</sup> Julian led Gothic&nbsp;troops against Persia, and the army
                with which Theodosius&nbsp;defeated the tyrant Maximus (388) contained
                large&nbsp;numbers of Huns and Alans, as well as of Goths. The&nbsp;names of
                Arbogast, Stilicho, and Rufinus are sufficient&nbsp;proof of the place held by
                barbarians near the emperor’s&nbsp;person and in the control of the provinces and
                legions of&nbsp;Rome ; and the relations of Arbogast to his nominee for&nbsp;the
                purple, Eugenius, were an anticipation of those which&nbsp;existed between Ricimer
                and the emperors of the latter&nbsp;half of the 5th century.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It was by barbarians already settled within the empire that the first
                of the series of attacks which finally separated&nbsp;the Western provinces from the
                empire and set up a&nbsp;barbaric ruler in Italy were made,@@<sup>2</sup> and it was
                in men of&nbsp;barbarian birth that Rome found her ablest and most&nbsp;successful
                defenders, and the emperors both of East and&nbsp;West their most capable and
                powerful ministers. The&nbsp; Visigoths whom Alaric led into Italy had been
                settled&nbsp;south of the Danube as the allies of the empire since
                the&nbsp;accession of Theodosius. The greater part of them were&nbsp;Christians at
                least in name, and Alaric himself had stood&nbsp;high in tho favour of Theodosius.
                The causes which set&nbsp;them in motion are tolerably clear. Like the Germans
                of&nbsp;the days of Cæsar, they wanted land for their own, and to&nbsp;this
                land-hunger was evidently added in Alaric’s own case&nbsp;the ambition of raising
                himself to the heights which had&nbsp;been reached before him by the Vandal Stilicho
                at Ravenna&nbsp;and the Goth Rufinus at Constantinople. The jealousy&nbsp;which
                existed between the rulers of the Western and&nbsp;Eastern empires furthered his
                plans. In the name of&nbsp;Arcadius, the emperor of the East, or at least with
                the&nbsp;connivance of Arcadius’s minister Rufinus, he occupied&nbsp;the province of
                Illyricum, and from thence ravaged&nbsp;Greece, which according to the existing
                division of provinces belonged to the Western empire. Thence in 396&nbsp;he
                retreated before Stilicho to Illyricum, with the command&nbsp;of which he was now
                formally invested by Arcadius, and&nbsp;which gave him the best possible starting
                point for an&nbsp;attack on Italy.@@<sup>3</sup> In 400 he led his people,
                with&nbsp;their wives and families, their waggons and treasure, to&nbsp;seek lands
                for themselves south of the Alps. But in this&nbsp;first invasion he penetrated no
                farther than the plains&nbsp;of Lombardy, and after the desperate battle of
                Pollentia</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">(402)@@<sup>4</sup> he slowly withdrew from Italy, his retreat being
                hastened by the promises of gold freely made to him by&nbsp;the imperial government.
                Not until the autumn of 408&nbsp;did Alaric again cross the Alps. Stilicho was dead
                ; the&nbsp;barbarian troops in Honorius’s service had been provoked&nbsp;into
                joining Alaricby the insane anti-Teutonic policy of&nbsp;Honorius and his ministers,
                and Alaric marched unopposed&nbsp;to Rome. This time, however, the payment of a
                heavy&nbsp;ransom saved the city. Several months of negotiation&nbsp;followed
                between Alaric and the court of Ravenna.&nbsp;Alaric’s demands were moderate, but
                Honorius would&nbsp;grant neither lands for his people nor the honourable
                post&nbsp;in the imperial service which he asked for himself. Once&nbsp;more /Vlaric
                sat down before Rome, and this time the&nbsp;panic-stricken citizens discovered a
                fresh mode of escape.&nbsp;Attalus, a Greek, the prefect of the city, was
                declared&nbsp;Augustus, and Alaric accepted the post of commander-inchief. But the
                incapacity of Attalus was too much for&nbsp;the patience of his barbarian minister
                and patron, and&nbsp;after a few months’ reign Alaric formally deposed him&nbsp;and
                renewed his offers to Honorius. Again, however,&nbsp;they were declined, and Alaric
                marched to the siege and&nbsp;sack of Rome (410).@@<sup>5</sup> His death followed
                hard on&nbsp;his capture of Rome. Two years later (412) his successor Ataulf led the
                Yisigoths to find in Gaul the lands&nbsp;which Alaric had sought in Italy. It is
                characteristic of&nbsp;the anarchical condition of the West that Ataulf and
                his&nbsp;Goths should have fought for Honorius in Gaul against&nbsp;the
                    tyrants,@@<sup>6</sup> and in Spain against the Vandals, Suevi, and&nbsp;Alani;
                and it was with the consent of Honorius that in 419&nbsp;Wallia, who had followed
                Ataulf as king of the Visigoths,&nbsp;finally settled with his people in
                south-western Gaul and&nbsp;founded the Visigothic
            monarchy.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It was about the same period that the accomplished fact of the
                division of Spain between the three barbarian&nbsp;tribes of Vandals, Suevi, and
                Alani was in a similar&nbsp;manner recognized and approved by the
                paramount&nbsp;authority of the emperor of the West.@@<sup>8</sup> These peoples
                had&nbsp;crossed the Rhine at the time when Alaric was making&nbsp;his first attempt
                on Italy. A portion of the host led by&nbsp;Radagaisus @@<sup>9</sup> actually
                invaded Italy, but were cut to pieces&nbsp;by Stilicho near Florence (405) ; the
                rest pressed on&nbsp;through Gaul, crossed the Pyrenees, and entered the as&nbsp;yet
                untouched province of Spain.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Honorius died in 423. His authority had survived the dangers to which
                it had been exposed alike from the&nbsp;rivalry of tyrants and barbaric invasion,
                and with the&nbsp;single exception of Britain@@<sup>lθ</sup> no province had yet
                formally&nbsp;broken loose from the empire. But over a great part of&nbsp;the West
                this authority was now little more than nominal ;&nbsp;throughout the major part of
                Gaul and in Spain the&nbsp;barbarians had settled, and barbarian states were
                growing&nbsp;up which still recognized the paramount supremacy of&nbsp;the emperor,
                but were in all essentials independent of&nbsp;his control. The question for the
                future was whether&nbsp;this relationship between the declining imperial
                authority&nbsp;and the vigorous young states which had planted the seeds&nbsp;of a
                fresh life in the provinces would be maintained.</span></p>
