<p><span class="font1">of'the trades of London were arrayed in livery,” and an ordinance of 1347 of the fraternity of the Mercers commanding that “ all those of the said mistery shall be clothed of one suit once&nbsp;a year at the feast of Easter,” and Riley </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(op. cit.</span><span class="font1"> p. 516) quotes&nbsp;an order of 1389 allowing the sheriffs, on grounds of expense,&nbsp;to proceed to Westminster by boat instead of on horseback,&nbsp;“ without there being any arraying of men of the trades in&nbsp;like suit for that purpose; except that such men of the trades&nbsp;as should wish to accompany them should walk in such suit&nbsp;of vestments of the livery of their respective trade as they&nbsp;might then have. ” As to the liveries of the religious fraternities, Chaucer </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Prol.</span><span class="font1"> 361) describes:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ An Haberdasher and a Carpenter A Webbe<sub>t</sub> a Dyere, and a Tapicer, ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As, <sup>u</sup> clothed alle in a Hveree</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of a solempne and greet fraternitee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1389 there was a petition against the giving of liveries by the fraternities, on the ground that these gatherings were&nbsp;centres of political agitation, but in the statutes of Edward III.&nbsp;and Richard II. against liveries members of guilds were expressly&nbsp;excepted from these prohibitions. However, it was doubtless&nbsp;deemed prudent to make sure of the privilege, and so, when the&nbsp;livery companies were incorporated, they took care to have&nbsp;their Everies authorized by their charters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These Everies consisted of a gown and hood, though the hood only was sometimes given; thus the Grocers’ Company&nbsp;had in 1430 55 members in the fuU Every, 17 in hoods&nbsp;and 42 not in Every. It was also customary for such of the&nbsp;companies as wished it to present Everies to outsiders, for&nbsp;instance, to the mayor, should he belong to another company.&nbsp;Thus in 1399 the Tailors gave liveries to the king, the prince&nbsp;and the mayor, and hoods to the sheriffs., But in 1415 and&nbsp;1423 the mayor and aldermen were forbidden to receive any&nbsp;Every except that of their own company. A similar custom&nbsp;was that by which a member of any company might send to&nbsp;thé mayor a certain sum, receiving in return a suit of the livery&nbsp;of the mayor’s company. The colours of the various Everies&nbsp;varied very much from time to time. Thus in 1414 the Grocers&nbsp;wore liveries of scarlet and green, which were changed in 1418&nbsp;to scarlet and black, in 1428 to scarlet and blue and in 1450 to&nbsp;“violet in grain,” with party-coloured hoods of violet and&nbsp;crimson. At first both&nbsp;gowns and hoods were&nbsp;party-coloured, but later a&nbsp;party-coloured hood was&nbsp;worn with a gown of one&nbsp;colour. The gowns were&nbsp;also lined and edged with&nbsp;fur. An early illustration&nbsp;of the Everies is to be found&nbsp;on the first charter of the&nbsp;LeatherseUers’ Company,&nbsp;granted them in 1444 by&nbsp;Henry VI., where the&nbsp;members of the company&nbsp;are depicted kneeling&nbsp;before the king in short&nbsp;party-coloured gowns of&nbsp;red and blue, edged at&nbsp;the neck, wrists and round the bottom with fur and with&nbsp;white girdles (see fig. 4, Jrom a coloured reproduction in W. H.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In the reign of Henry VIII., Holbein’s picture of the king giving a charter to the Barber-Surgeons’ Company shows the&nbsp;members of the latter wearing gowns of rich stuff, with red and&nbsp;black party-coloured hoods, three of the figures also in coifs.&nbsp;The form of gown which has survived, practically unchanged,&nbsp;till the present day, may be seen on the second charter of the&nbsp;LeatherseUers’ Company, granted them by James I. in 1604 (see&nbsp;fig. 5, and for coloured plate see W. H. Black, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">op. citf.</span><span class="font1"> Here&nbsp;we see them in flat caps, long black furred gowns, with false&nbsp;sleeves, and having on the right shoulder party-coloured hoods&nbsp;of scarlet and black, the end of which is cast over the left&nbsp;shoulder and hangs down nearly to the edge of the gown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides the liveries of the city companies, and those of the mayor and sheriffs, there was often a special livery adopted by all the&nbsp;citizens on some great</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">occasion, such as a visit of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the sovereign to the City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">W. St John Hope (Cor-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">poration Plate and in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">signias</span><span class="font1"> ii. 141 ) quotes a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">number of such cases,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">showing that the city</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">livery was sometimes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">green, sometimes blue,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">sometimes violet, some</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">times red and white,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cellence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As to the costume of the mayor, aldermen,&nbsp;sheriffs, &amp;c., we have seen&nbsp;above the mayor “ richly&nbsp;costumed,” and the aldermen “ in like suits of&nbsp;robes,” at the birth of&nbsp;Edward III., and Riley&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(op. citf</span><span class="font1"> gives an order of&nbsp;1378, that the aldermen&nbsp;are to ride to Westminster&nbsp;in the mayor’s procession, <sup>u</sup> arrayed in a cloak and hood at least, that are party-coloured with red, scarlet and white, the red on the right side <sup>6</sup> ;&nbsp;while he quotes (from Letter-book H. fol. cxlvi) the amusing&nbsp;sentence passed by his fellow-aldermen in 1382 on one John&nbsp;Seley, for disregarding the order to have his green cloak for the&nbsp;Whitsuntide procession lined with green taffeta. Thus before the&nbsp;15th century the aldermen apparently had not yet their scarlet&nbsp;robes, but on state occasions wore the ordinary city livery. For&nbsp;the early 15th century we have the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Liber Albus</span><span class="font1"> (written </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C.</span><span class="font1"> 1419;&nbsp;Rolls Scries, ed. Riley), where we are told (p. 35) that “ The Mayor,&nbsp;Sheriff and Aldermen were wont to array themselves in like suits&nbsp;of robes twice in the year, viz. when the mayor rode to Westminster&nbsp;to take the oath, and on the day following the feast of SS. Simon&nbsp;and Jude; and this raiment was trimmed with fur as befitting their&nbsp;honourable rank; and they would also dress themselves in suits&nbsp;of robes against the feast of Pentecost, these robes having a lining&nbsp;of silk.” The scarlet, violet and black robes, still worn by the&nbsp;Lord Mayor, aldermen, &amp;c., were early in use. There is an order&nbsp;of 1421 (8 HenryV.)thatthealdermensnoulduse“ togiset armilausis&nbsp;de scarleto,” and in numerous accounts of royal receptions and other&nbsp;solemn occasions in the City we are told that the mayor and aldermen were jn scarlet (W. St John Hope, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Corporation Plate and&nbsp;Insignia,</span><span class="font1"> i., Introd. lxxxv seq., and ii. 138-147, quotes a number&nbsp;of these, and treats the whole subject of mayors’, &amp;c., robes very&nbsp;fully). </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>r</sup>The Liber Albus</span><span class="font1"> (i. i,ch. vi.) also shows us the mayor and aldermen assembled at the Guildhall on the day of the election of the new&nbsp;mayor </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">induti togis de violet.</span><span class="font1"> As to the form of the dress in the 14th&nbsp;and 15th century, we can see from brasses of lord mayors and aldermen&nbsp;(see Haines, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Manual,</span><span class="font1"> pp. cc-cci ; and Cotman, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Norfolk Brasses.</span><span class="font1"> There&nbsp;is a fine series of brasses of mayors, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;c.,</span><span class="font1"> at Norwich) that it consisted&nbsp;of a long gown, a mantle fastened on the right shoulder and a hood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As Jo the provincial mayors and aldermen there is evidence that at quite an early date many of them followed the fashion of London ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> the Royal Charter of Nottingham, of 1448, contains the words:&nbsp;“ that the Aldermen of the same town forever . . . may use gowns,&nbsp;hoods and cloaks of one suit and one livery together with furs and&nbsp;linings suitable to these cloaks, in the same manner and form as&nbsp;the Mayor and Aldermen of our city of London do use, the Statute&nbsp;of Liveries . . . notwithstanding ” (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nottingham Records,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 205),&nbsp;while the charter granted by Henry VI. to Kingston-on-Hull in&nbsp;1440 contains practically the same words (see St J. Hope, i. Ixxxvi).&nbsp;The costume of provincial mayors, &amp;c., is shown by St John Hope&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(loc. citf.</span><span class="font1"> to have generally consisted of a scarlet furred gown and&nbsp;cloak, with tippet or scarf of black velvet. The colour was not,&nbsp;however, invariably scarlet, but varied to violet, blue and black,&nbsp;sometimes even for the mayor. An account of the robes of modern&nbsp;provincial mayors,will be found in St J. Hope, p. Ixxxix seq. and&nbsp;under the accounts of the various boroughs, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">passim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is some doubt as to when the Lord Mayor first began to wear his robe of estate of crimson velvet. Stow </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Survey,</span><span class="font1"> ed. Strype,&nbsp;1720, ii. ι6β) says that at the reception of Henry VI. at Eltham the&nbsp;InayorwasincrimsonvelvetZthealdermeninscarIetwith<sup>u</sup> sanguine ”&nbsp;hoods, but at the coronation of Edward V.
