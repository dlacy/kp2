There are 24 ſpecies, of which the moſt remarkable are,</p><p>1.    The coriaria, or elm-leaved ſumach, grows naturally in Italy, Spain, Turkey, Syria, and Paleſtine. The branches of this tree are uſed inſtead of oak-bark for tanning of leather ; and it is ſaid that the Turkey leather is all tanned with this ſhrub. It has a ligneous ftalk, which divides at bottom into many irregular branches, riling to the height of eight or ten feet ; the bark is hairy, of an herbaceous brown colour; the leaves are winged, compoſed of ſeven or eight pair of lobes, terminated by an odd one, bluntly ſawed on their edges, hairy on their under ſide, of a yellowiſh-green colour, and placed alternately on the branches; the flowers grow in looſe panicles on the end of the branches, which are of a vchitiſh herbaceous colour, each panicle being compoſed of ſeveral ſpikes of flowers fitting cloſe to the footſtalks. The leaves and feeds of this ſort are uſed in medicine, and are eſteemed very reſtringent and ftiptic.</p><p>2.    The typhinum, Virginian ſumach, or vinegar plant, grows naturally in almoſt every part of North America. This hath a woody ſtem, with many irregular branches, which are generally crooked and deformed. The young branches are covered with a ſoft velvet-like down, re-ſembling greatly that of a young flag’s horn, both in colour and texture, from whence the common people have given it the appellation of <hi rend="italic">ſtag's horn ;</hi>  the leaves are winged, compoſed of fix or ſeven pair of oblong heart-ſhaped lobes, terminated by an odd one, ending in acute points, hairy on their underſide, as is alſo the midrib. The flowers are produced in cloſe tufts at the end of the branches, and are ſucceeded by feeds, inclo-ſed in purple woolly ſucculent covers ; ſo that the bunches are of a beautiful purple colour in autumn ; and the leaves, before they fall in autumn, change to a purpliſh colour at firſt, and before they fall to a feuille-mort. This plant, originally a native of North America, has been long cultivated in the north of Germany, and is lately introduced into Ruſſia. It has got the name of the <hi rend="italic">vinegar plant</hi>  from the double reaſon of the young germen of its fruit, when fermented, producing either new or adding to the ſtrength of old weak vinegar, whilſt its ripe berries afford an agreeable acid, which might ſupply the place when neceſſary of the citric acid. The powerful aſtringency of this plant in all its parts recommends it as uſeful in ſeveral of the arts. As for example, the ripe berries boiled with alum make a good dye for hats. The plant in all its parts may be uſed as a ſuccedaneum for oak-bark in tanning, eſpecially the white glove leather. It will likewiſe anſwer to prepare a dye for black, green, and yellow colours ; and with martial vitriol it makes a good ink. The milky juice</p><lb/><p>that flows from inciſions made in the trunk or branches, makes when dried the baſis of a varniſh little inferior to the Chineſe. Bees are remarkably fond of its flowers; and it affords more honey than any of the flowering ſlrrubs, ſo that it may prove a uſeful branch of economy, where rearing tlieſe infects is an object. The natives of America uſe the dried leaves as tobacco.</p><p>3.    The glabrum, with winged leaves, grows naturally in many parts of North America ; this is commonly titled by the gardeners <hi rend="italic">New England ſumach.</hi>  The ſtem of this is ſtronger and riſes higher than that of the former ; the branches ſpread more horizontally ; they are not quite ſo downy as thoſe of the laſt, and the down is of a browniſh colour ; the leaves are compoſed of many more pair of lobes, which are ſmooth on both ſides ; the flowers are diſpoſed in looſe panicles, which are of an herbaceous colour.</p><p>4.    The Carolinian um, with ſawedwinged leaves, grows naturally in Carolina ; the feeds of this were brought from thence by the late Mr Cateſhy, who has given a figure of the plant in his Natural Hiſtory of Carolina. This is by the gardeners called the <hi rend="italic">ſcarlet Carolina ſu-mach ;</hi>  it riſes commonly to the height of ſeven or eight feet, dividing into many irregular branches, which are ſmooth, of a purple colour, and pounced over with a greyiſh powder, as are alſo the footſtalks of the leaves. The leaves are compoſed of ſeven or eight pair of lobes, terminated by an odd one ; theſe are not always placed exactly oppoſite on the midrib, but are ſometimes alternate. The upper ſide of the lobes are of a dark green, and their under hoary,, but ſmooth. The flowers are produced at the end of the branches in very cloſe panicles, which are large, and of a bright red colour.</p><p>5.    The Canadenſe, with winged ſpear-ſhaped leaves, grows naturally in Canada, Maryland, and ſeveral other parts of North America. This hath ſmooth branches of a purple colour, covered with a grey pounce. The leaves are compoſed of ſeven or eight pair of lobes, terminated by an odd one ; the lobes are ſpear-ſhaped, ſawed on their edges, of a lucid green on their upper ſurface, but hoary on their under, and are ſmooth. The flowers are produced at the end of the branches in large panicles, which are compoſed of ſeveral ſmaller, each ſtanding upon ſeparate footſtalks ; they are of a deep red colour, and the whole panicle is covered with a grey pounce, as if it had been ſcattered over them.</p><p>6.    The copallinum, or narrow-leaved ſumach, grows naturally in moſt parts of North America, where it is known by the title of <hi rend="italic">beach ſumach,</hi>  probably from the place where it grows. This is of humbler growth than either, of the former, ſeldom riſing more than four or five feet high in Britain, dividing into many ſpreading branches, which are ſmooth, of a light brown colour, cloſely garniſhed with winged leaves, compoſed of four or five pair of narrow lobes, terminated by an odd one; they are of a light green on both ſides, and in autumn change purpliſh. The midrib, which ſuſtains the lobes, has on each ſide a winged or leafy border, which runs from one pair of lobes to another, ending in joints at each pair, by which it is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the other ſorts. The flowers are produced in looſe panicles at the end of the branches, of a yellowiſh herbaceous colour.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
