<p><span class="font0">it. It is therefore a problem of no very difficult ſolu-tion to aſſign the law by which the velocity will gradually diminiſh as the filament recedes from the axis of a cylindrical tube. It is ſomewhat ſurpriſmg that ſo&nbsp;neat a problem has never occupied the attention of the&nbsp;mathematicians during the time that theſe ſubjects were&nbsp;ſo aſſiduouſly ſtudied; but ſo it is, that nothing preciſe&nbsp;has been publiſhed on the ſubject. The only approach&nbsp;to a diſcuſſion of this kind, is a Memoire of Mr Pitot,&nbsp;read to the academy of Paris in 1726, where he conſt-ders the velocity of efflux through a pipe. Here, by&nbsp;attending to the comparative ſiaperiority of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quantity&nbsp;of motion</span><span class="font0"> in large pipes, he affirms, that the total diminutions ariſing from friction will be (c</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">uteris paribus}</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;the inverſe ratio of the diameters. This was thankfully received by other writers, and is now a part of&nbsp;our hydraulic theories. It has not, however, been attended to by thoſe who. write on the motion of rivers,&nbsp;though it is evident that it is applicable to theſe With&nbsp;equal propriety ; and had it been introduced, it would&nbsp;at once have ſolved all their difficulties, and particularly would have ſhown how an almoſt imperceptible declivity would produce the gentle motion of a great river, without having recourſe to the unintelligible principle of Guglielmini.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Couplet made ſome experiments on the motion of the water in the great main pipes of Verſailles, in order&nbsp;to obtain ſome notions of the retardations occaſioned by&nbsp;friction. They were found prodigious; but were ſo irregular, and unſuſceptible of reduction to any general&nbsp;principle, (and the experiments were indeed ſo few that&nbsp;they were unfit for this reduction), that he could eſta-bliſh no theory.—What Mr Belidor eſtabliſhed on them,&nbsp;and makes a ſort of ſyſtem to direct future engineers, is&nbsp;quite unworthy of attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon the whole, this branch of hydraulics, although of much greater practical importance than the conduct&nbsp;of water in pipes, has never yet obtained more than a&nbsp;vague, and, we may call it, ſlovenly attention from the&nbsp;mathematicians ; and we aſcribe it to their not having&nbsp;taken the pains to fettle its firſt principles with the&nbsp;fame precifion as had been done in the other branch.&nbsp;They were, from the beginning, ſatisſied with a ſort of&nbsp;applicability of mathematical principles, without ever&nbsp;making the application. Were it not that ſome would&nbsp;accuſe us of national partiality, we would aſcribe it to&nbsp;this, that Newton had not pointed out the way in this&nbsp;as in the other branch. For any intelligent reader of&nbsp;the performances on the motions of fluids in cloſe veſ-ſels, will fee that there has not a principle, nay hardly&nbsp;a ſtep of inveſtigation, been added to thoſe which were&nbsp;uſed or pointed out by Sir Iſaac Newton. He has nowhere touched this queſtion, the motion of water in an&nbsp;open canal. In his theories of the tides, and of the&nbsp;propagation of waves, he had an excellent opportunity&nbsp;for giving at once the fundamental principles of motion&nbsp;in a free fluid whoſe ſurface was not horizontal But,&nbsp;by means of ſome of thoſe happy and ſhrewd. gueſſes,&nbsp;in which, as Daniel Bernoulli ſays, he excelled all men,&nbsp;he ſaw the undoubted conſequences of ſome palpable&nbsp;phenomenon which would anſwer all his preſent. pur-poſes, and therefore entered no far ther into the inveſtigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The original theery of Guglielmini, or the principle adopted by him, that each particle of the vertical lec</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">tion of a running ſtream has ä tendency to move as if it were iſſuing from an orifice at that depth under the&nbsp;ſurface, is falſe ; and that it really does ſo in the face of a&nbsp;dam when the flood-gate is taken .away, is no leſs ſo ;&nbsp;and if it did, the ſubſequent motions would hardly have&nbsp;any reſemblance to thoſe which he aſſigns them. Were&nbsp;this the caſe, the exterior form of the caſcade would&nbsp;be ſomething like what is ſltetched in fig. 3. with an&nbsp;abrupt angle at B, and a concave ſurface BEG. This&nbsp;will be evident to every one who combines the greater&nbsp;velocity of the lower filaments with the flower motion&nbsp;of thoſe which muſt Aide down above them. But this&nbsp;greater advance of the lower filaments cannot take place&nbsp;without an expenditure of the water under the ſurface&nbsp;AB. The ſurface therefore finks, and B inſtantly&nbsp;ceaſes to retain its place in the horizontal plane. The&nbsp;water does not ſucceſſively flow forward from A to B<sub>s</sub>,&nbsp;and then tumble over the precipice ; but immediately&nbsp;upon opening the flood-gate, the water waſtes from the&nbsp;ſpace immediately behind it, and the whole puts on&nbsp;the form reprefented in fig. 4. conſiſtſhg of the curve&nbsp;AαPfEG, convex from A to c, and concave from&nbsp;thence forward. The ſuperficial water begins to accelerate all the way from A ; and the particles may be&nbsp;ſuppoſed (for the preſent) to have acquired the velocity&nbsp;correſponding to their depth under the horizontal fur»&nbsp;face. This muſt be underſtood as nothing more than&nbsp;a vague ſketch of the motions. It requires a very critical and intricate inveſtigation to determine either the&nbsp;form of the upper curve or the motions of the different&nbsp;filaments. The place A, where the curvature begins,&nbsp;is of equally difficult determination, and is various according to the differences of depth and of inclination 1&nbsp;of the ſucceeding canal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have given this ſort of hiſtory of the progreſs which had been made in this part of hydraulics, that&nbsp;our readers might form ſome opinion of the many diſ-ſertations which have been written on the motion of&nbsp;rivers, and of the ſtate of the arts depending on it.&nbsp;Much of the buſineſs of the civil engineer is intimately&nbsp;connected with it : and we may therefore believe, that&nbsp;ſince there was ſo little principle in the theories, there&nbsp;could be but very little certainty in the practical operations. The fact has been, that no engineer could&nbsp;pretend to ſay, with any precifion, what would be the&nbsp;effect of his operations. One whoſe buſineſs had given him many opportunities, and who kept accurate and&nbsp;judicious regiſters of his own works, could pronounce,&nbsp;with ſome probability, how much water would be&nbsp;brought off by a drain of certain dimenſions and a given Hope, when the circumſtances of the caſe happened&nbsp;to tally with ſome former work in which he had ſuc-ceeded or failed ; but out of the pale of his own experience·, he could only make a ſagacious gueſs. A remarkable inſtance of this occurred not long ago. A ſmall&nbsp;aqueduct was lately carried into Paris. It had been&nbsp;conducted on a plan preſented to the academy, who had&nbsp;corrected it, and gave a report of what its performance&nbsp;would be. When executed in the molt accurate manner, it was deficient in the proportion of five to nine.&nbsp;When the celebrated Deſaguliers was employed by&nbsp;the city of Edinburgh to ſuperintend the bringing in&nbsp;the water for the ſupply of the city, he gave a report ,&nbsp;on the plan which was to be followed. It was executed to his complete ſatisfaction ; and the quantity of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
