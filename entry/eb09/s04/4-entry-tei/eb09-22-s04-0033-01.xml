The town, encircled by a crenellated and bastioned wall with a fosse, is traversed from east to west and from north to south by two wide streets shaded by plane trees ; the gates are four in number, named from Oran, Daia, Mascara, and Tlemcen respectively. There are numerous fountains fed from the Mekerra. The civil and military quarters of the town are quite distinct from one another. The population of Sidi-bel-Abbès in 1881 was 13,298, or, including the commune, 16,840; the Spanish considerably preponderates over the French element. The town, which is of quite recent origin, derives its name from a chapel, near which a redoubt was constructed by General Bedeau in 1843. The surrounding country is healthy, fertile, and populous.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
