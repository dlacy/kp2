<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Society.—</span><span class="font1">After 1870 both the aristocracy and the middle classes were divided into hostile factions, each of which maintained a press&nbsp;of its own and rallied round representative individuals. So far as&nbsp;the middle classes were concerned, the common interest of commercial&nbsp;operations soon concentrated political differences. The aristocracy,&nbsp;however, kept rigidly aloof from all speculations for a time, and&nbsp;maintained its traditional attitude of contemptuous superiority,&nbsp;to which the middle class answered with its profound hatred. This&nbsp;state of things lasted about ten years, until the time of the great&nbsp;building speculations, in which a number of noble families were&nbsp;tempted, and in which they soon found themselves hopelessly&nbsp;involved, and brought into close contact with the middle class.&nbsp;The two classes thus became necessary to each other, and the result&nbsp;was a notable and salutary diminution of prejudice, soon leading&nbsp;to alliances by marriage, which would formerly have seemed impossible, but which the redistribution of wealth rendered mutually&nbsp;advantageous. The appearance at social gatherings of an official&nbsp;element, almost exclusively taken from the middle class, also&nbsp;tended to reduce inequalities of caste. Yet it must be admitted&nbsp;that the parties composing Roman society were drawn together&nbsp;mechanically, rather than fused into anything really homogeneous. 11&nbsp;is worth mentioning that the Jewish element, which is very strong&nbsp;in business, in journalism, and in the administrations, had made no&nbsp;attempt to enter Roman society. Rome and Genoa are practically&nbsp;the only Italian cities in which Israelites are rigidly excluded from&nbsp;social intimacy, and are only met on official occasions.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ancient History</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Beginnings of Rome and the Monarchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Both the city and the state of Rome are represented in tradition as having been gradually formed by the fusion of separate communities. The original settlement of Romulus is said to have&nbsp;been limited to the Palatine Mount. With this were united&nbsp;before the end of his reign the Capitoline and the Quirinal;&nbsp;Tullus Hostilius added the Caelian, Ancus Martius the Aventine;&nbsp;and finally Servius Tullius included the Esquiline and Viminal,&nbsp;and enclosed the whole seven hills with a stone wall. The&nbsp;growth of the state closely followed that of the city. To the&nbsp;original Romans on the Palatine were added successively the&nbsp;Sabine followers of King Tatius, Albans transplanted by Tullus,&nbsp;Latins by Ancus, and lastly the Etruscan comrades of Caeles&nbsp;Vibenna. This tradition is supported by other and more&nbsp;positive evidence. The race of the Luperci on February 15&nbsp;was in fact a purification of the boundaries of the “ ancient&nbsp;Palatine town,”<sup>@@1</sup> the “ square Rome ” of Ennius ;<sup>@@2</sup> and the&nbsp;course taken is that described by Tacitus as the “ pomoerium ”&nbsp;of the city founded by Romulus.<sup>@@3</sup> On the Esquiline, Varro&nbsp;mentions an “ ancient city ” and an “ earthen rampart<sup>@@4</sup> and&nbsp;the festival of the Septimontium is evidence of a union between&nbsp;this settlement and that on the Palatine.<sup>@@5</sup>The fusion of these&nbsp;“ Mounts ” with a settlement on the Quirinal “ Hill ” is also&nbsp;attested by trustworthy evidence<sup>@@6</sup> and in particular the line&nbsp;taken by the procession of the Argei represents the enlarged&nbsp;boundaries of these united communities.<sup>@@7</sup> Lastly, the Servian&nbsp;agger still remains as a witness to the final enclosure of the&nbsp;various settlements within a single ring-wall. The united community thus formed was largely of Latin descent. Indications&nbsp;of this are not wanting even in the traditions themselves:&nbsp;King Faunus, who rules the Aborigines on the Palatine, is Latin;&nbsp;“ Latini ” is the name ascribed to the united Aborigines and&nbsp;Trojans; the immediate progenitors of Rome are the Latin&nbsp;Lavinium and the Latin Alba. Much evidence in the language,&nbsp;the religion, the institutions and the civilization of early Rome&nbsp;points to the same conclusion. The speech of the Romans is&nbsp;from the first Latin<sup>@@8</sup> though showing many traces of contact</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">with the neighbouring dialects of the Sabines and Volscians and also of Etruscans; the oldest gods of Rome—Saturn, Jupiter,&nbsp;Juno, Diana—are all Latin; “rex,” “praetor,” “dictator,”&nbsp;“ curia,” are Latin titles and institutions.<sup>@@9</sup> The primitive&nbsp;settlements, with their earthen ramparts and wooden palisades&nbsp;planted upon them out of reach both of human foes and of the&nbsp;malaria of the swampy low grounds, are only typical of the&nbsp;mode of settlement which the conditions of life dictated throughout the Latian plain.<sup>@@10</sup> But tradition insists on the admixture&nbsp;of at least two non-Latin elements, a Sabine and an Etruscan.&nbsp;The question as regards the latter will be more fully discussed&nbsp;hereafter; it is enough to say here that while the evidence of&nbsp;nomenclature (Schulze, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichie der Lal. Eigennamen,</span><span class="font1"> Leipzig,&nbsp;1904, p. 579, with the modifications suggested in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Classical&nbsp;Review,</span><span class="font1"> December 1907) shows that many Etruscan </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">genles&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">were settled within the bounds of the early city, there is iio&nbsp;satisfactory evidence that there was any large Etruscan strain&nbsp;in the Roman blood.<sup>@@11</sup> With the Sabines it is otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That union of the Palatine and Quirinal settlements which constituted so decisive a stage in the growth&nbsp;of Rome is represented as having been in reality a union&nbsp;of the original Latins with a band of Sabine invaders who had&nbsp;seized and held not only the Quirinal Hill, but the northern&nbsp;and nearest peak of the Capitoline Mount. The tradition was&nbsp;evidently deeply rooted. The name of the god </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quirinus,</span><span class="font1"> from&nbsp;which that of the Quirinal Hill itself presumably sprang, was&nbsp;popularly connected with the Sabine town of Cures.<sup>@@12</sup> The&nbsp;ancient worships connected with it were said to be Sabine.<sup>@@13&nbsp;</sup>One of the three old tribes, the Tities, was believed to represent&nbsp;the Sabine element;<sup>@@14</sup> the second and the fourth kings are both&nbsp;of Sabine descent. By the great majority of modern writers&nbsp;the substance of the tradition, the fusion of a body of Sabine&nbsp;invaders with the original Latins, is accepted as historical; and&nbsp;even Mommsen allowed its possibility, though be threw back&nbsp;the time of its occurrence to an earlier period than that of the&nbsp;union of the two settlements.<sup>@@15</sup> We cannot here enter into the&nbsp;question at length, but some fairly certain points may be&nbsp;mentioned. The probability of Sabine raids and a Sabine&nbsp;settlement, possibly on the Quirinal Hill, in very early times&nbsp;may be admitted. The incursions of the highland Apennine&nbsp;tribes into the lowlands fill a large place in early Italian history.&nbsp;The Latins were said to have originally descended from the&nbsp;mountain glens near Reate.<sup>@@16</sup> The invasions of Campania and&nbsp;of Magna Graecia by Sabine (more correctly Safine) tribes are&nbsp;matter of history (see Saunites), and the Sabines themselves&nbsp;are represented as a restless highland people, ever seeking new&nbsp;homes in richer lands.<sup>@@17</sup> In very early days they appear on the&nbsp;borders of Latium, in close proximity to Rome, and Sabine&nbsp;forays are familiar and frequent occurrences in the old legends.&nbsp;But beyond these general considerations recent inquiry enables&nbsp;us to advance to some few definite conclusions. (1) It may now&nbsp;be regarded as established beyond question that the patrician&nbsp;class at Rome sprang from a race other than that of the plebeians.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
