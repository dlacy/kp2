<p><span class="font1">considerably in the earlier </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chansons.</span><span class="font1"> The final conception appears to be that which is contained in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eierabras ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">but the substitution of new personages for the old ones&nbsp;is so great that it is not possible to regard the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">douze&nbsp;pairs</span><span class="font1"> as a definite set of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dramatis personæ</span><span class="font1"> on the stage.&nbsp;Nor indeed do any of the heroes of the printed prose&nbsp;romances belong to that society, however frequently its&nbsp;members appear in their stories. Originally it would seem&nbsp;that some fortuitous coincidence between the number of&nbsp;the apostles and the number of the captains who headed&nbsp;Charlemagne’s evangelizing expedition into Spain had been&nbsp;utilized by some of the monkish legendaries, and thus the&nbsp;early </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chansons</span><span class="font1"> became affected with a mystic respect for&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">douze pairs.</span><span class="font1"> But each writer allowed himself the&nbsp;licence of excluding and including any warrior he chose in&nbsp;that number. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudo-Turpin</span><span class="font1"> makes no reference to&nbsp;such a society, although it gives the names of the more&nbsp;celebrated knights. The full story of Roland has no prose&nbsp;romance to itself (see Roland, Legend of). The story&nbsp;of Oliver is in similar case, unless the prose romance of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Galien,</span><span class="font1"> Oliver’s son, may be held to embody it. Régnault&nbsp;de Montauban (the chief of the four sons of Aymon), Huon&nbsp;of Bordeaux, Amys and Milles, Jourdain, Galien, Maugis,&nbsp;Mabrian, and many other heroes of the printed romances&nbsp;are unknown to the earliest ballad-histories of Charlemagne&nbsp;and his barons. Ogier the Dane seems to have grown out&nbsp;of two historical personages, a real Otlιger or Ottokar, a&nbsp;Frankish margrave of Charlemagne’s time, and a real Olgar&nbsp;or Hulger, a Danish or Norse warrior who plundered Aix-la-Chapelle some seventy odd years after the Frankish&nbsp;Othger had accompanied Roland into Spain. Othger&nbsp;fought with the Lombards against Charlemagne in 773;&nbsp;and Amys and Milles, in the battle in which they won&nbsp;the crown of martyrdom, are said to have fallen by his&nbsp;hand. Beaten by the emperor, he became his vassal and&nbsp;five years later commanded the advanced guard of the&nbsp;army whose rear-guard was destroyed at Roncesvalles. M.&nbsp;Gaston Paris has admirably discussed the historical bearings and the various phases of the original </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chansons de geste&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire Poétique de Charlemagne,</span><span class="font1"> but has dismissed&nbsp;with a brief reference all the printed prose romances we&nbsp;are now about to consider.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Reali di Francia exists both in metrical and in prose form, and it is difficult to decide which is the earlier ; the metrical&nbsp;version was certainly current in the 13th century, and there seems&nbsp;little reason to doubt that the prose story was in existence before&nbsp;1300. The latter was first printed at Modena in 1491. It is a&nbsp;general work on the subject of Frankish romantic history, and is&nbsp;divided into six books, of which the subjects are as follows :—(1)&nbsp;Clovis and Rizier ; (2) Fioravante and Rizier ; (3) Ottaviano de&nbsp;Leone (the emperor Octavian and his sons Florent and Lion) ; (4)&nbsp;Buovo d’Antonna (Bevis of Hampton) ; (5) Buovo avenged by&nbsp;his sons Guido and Sinibaldo and King William of England ;&nbsp;(6) birth of Charlemagne, death of Pippin and his natural sons.&nbsp;Thus we may conclude that it was, so far as printed under the&nbsp;name Rxali, the first part of a compilation of all the Charlemagne&nbsp;cyclical stories. The first book of the continuation Aspramοntx, a&nbsp;translation from the French poem of Aspremont<sub>1</sub> or rather a prose&nbsp;composition from an Italian version of that poem, exists in MS.&nbsp;The Reali di Franxia has been drawn upon by many later writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Chronicle of the Pseudo-Turpin.—The early part of this work was evidently forged by some monk interested in exalting the glory&nbsp;of St James’s shrine at Padron in Galicia (Spain), before it was&nbsp;transferred to Compostella. He represents St James as appearing&nbsp;in successive visions to Charlemagne, urging him to conquer Spain,&nbsp;the land in which the saint’s bones are laid and of which the&nbsp;Saracens are masters. Charlemagne advances with a Frankish&nbsp;army and besieges Pamplona, which is invincible to his arms, but&nbsp;falls a prey to his prayers. After further exploits and the foundation of many churches, he returns home, but is brought out again&nbsp;very speedily by news that the Saracen king, Aigoland, has once&nbsp;more seized the country. This king is borrowed from the older&nbsp;chansons relating to the war against the Lombards ; but for the&nbsp;12th century all Charlemagne’s foes were Saracens. The topographical difficulty is made light of, and Aspremont is placed in&nbsp;Spain. Roland, Oliver, and Ganelon (afterwards infamous for his&nbsp;treachery, the hereditary result of his kinship to the family of&nbsp;which Doon of Mayence was the head) distinguish themselves ;&nbsp;Aigoland is beaten and killed. Charlemagne next attacks Navarre,&nbsp;where his paladins enter into single combat with the heathen giant&nbsp;Ferracute, who vanquishes all but Roland, and is overcome by the&nbsp;latter by means of a stratagem. Cordova is next conquered and&nbsp;taken possession of, and Charlemagne retraces his steps, but remembers that he has left two other Saracen kings unsubdued—&nbsp;Marsilius and Baligant—in Saragossa. He sends Ganelon to claim&nbsp;tribute from them ; they contrive to rouse the predestined spirit of&nbsp;traitorousness in the envoy, and he returns with a false tale, which&nbsp;leads the monarch to forget military precautions by dividing his&nbsp;army into two portions. He himself with the advanced half passes&nbsp;the Pyrenees in safety, but Roland, Oliver, and the rear-guard are&nbsp;suddenly attacked in the pass of Roncesvalles. All perish in the&nbsp;fight except Roland, who, mortally wounded, dies alone in the wild&nbsp;mountain gorge, after having flung his famous sword away, and&nbsp;blown such a blast upon his horn that it bursts and the sound&nbsp;reaches the ears of Charlemagne. The emperor returns to Roncesvalles, slays the Saracen host, recovers the body of Roland and&nbsp;gets it embalmed, and causes Ganelon to be torn to pieces by wild&nbsp;horses. After a time his health suffers and his death approaches.&nbsp;Turpin becomes aware of a multitude of demons who are preparing&nbsp;to carry off the emperor’s soul on account of his sins. They are&nbsp;foiled, however, by St Denis, who, in return for Charlemagne’s benevolence towards the church, rescues his soul and bears it to heaven.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fierabras. —The basis of this romance was the lost poem upon the amir Balan, a Saracen leader conquered by Charlemagne in&nbsp;Italy ; the rest of the book was put together from Turpin and other&nbsp;sources so as to form the one general prose romance of Charlemagne. The scene is changed from Italy to Spain in the prose&nbsp;romance. Fierabras, the giant, is son of Balan, and, after having&nbsp;sacked Rome, is met by the Frankish host ; Oliver encounters and&nbsp;defeats him in single combat ; the giant is converted and baptized&nbsp;by the name of Florent, and receives half his father’s kingdom&nbsp;when his father is conquered and slain. Floripas, sister of Fierabras,&nbsp;marries Gui de Bourgogne, who takes the other half. The Spanish&nbsp;prose Historia del Emperador Carlo Magno, printed in 1528, is a&nbsp;translation ; there is also a German version.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Guerin de Montglave (or properly Garin de Montglane).—This romance of the 15th century is based upon the 13th-century poems&nbsp;on Girard de Vienne and Aimeri de Narbonne of “le clerc Bertrand.”&nbsp;It is a spirited and entertaining fiction relating the adventures of&nbsp;the four sons of Garin, one of the heroes of the elder Provençal&nbsp;cycle, and is misnamed, in so far as it contains only the story of his&nbsp;family, not of himself. The four sons are sent forth to seek adventures. Arnaud, the eldest, asserts his right to the dukedom of&nbsp;Aquitaine against a usurper who has succeeded on his uncle’s&nbsp;death. He is treacherously persuaded to seek the hand of the&nbsp;princess Fregonde, daughter of the Saracen sultan of Lombardy.&nbsp;His traitorous kinsman, Hernault, contrives to set Arnaud and the&nbsp;sultan at enmity, and Arnaud is flung into a dungeon, where the&nbsp;daughter, ready to accept Christianity for love of him, secretly&nbsp;visits him. Hernault apostatizes and goes back with a promise of&nbsp;the sultan’s help to conquer Aquitaine for himself, but turns aside&nbsp;from some qualm of conscience to confess his sins to a giant hermit,&nbsp;who happens to have been an old comrade of Garin. Thus learning&nbsp;the péril of Arnaud, the giant hermit Ribastre slays Hernault, and,&nbsp;seeking assistance from another old comrade, a converted magician&nbsp;named Perdigon, sallies forth to the aid of the imprisoned hero.&nbsp;In disguise he obtains admittance to the captive and the princess,&nbsp;baptizes the latter, kills the jailer, and sends Arnaud forth free&nbsp;to reconquer Aquitaine and to bring aid, while he and the lady&nbsp;hold the dungeon-tower, which is at once besieged by the sultan.&nbsp;After numerous fights, in which Perdigon’s magic is the chief actor,&nbsp;Ribastre and the princess get aλvay without having received help&nbsp;from Aquitaine, and on reaching that land find Arnaud a prisoner&nbsp;in the power of Hernault’s uncle. Ribastre kills the latter ; Arnaud&nbsp;is restored to his duchy and marries Fregonde ; the sultan turns&nbsp;Christian ; and all ends well. But the romance does not close here ;&nbsp;it proceeds to narrate the honours which fall to the other sons,&nbsp;Milon do Pouille, Regnier de' Gênes, and Girard de Vienne, or de&nbsp;Toulouse, through the favour of Charlemagne, who feels himself&nbsp;bound to Garin’s family in consequence of the obligation attached&nbsp;to a rash game of chess formerly lost by him to that hero. How<sup>τ</sup>ever,&nbsp;when Arnaud’s son has grown up, an accidental affront put upon&nbsp;the empress by him changes Charlemagne’s friendly feeling to hate.&nbsp;He makes a long w’ar upon Girard in Vienne, who is aided by his&nbsp;brother, and it is agreed at last to settle the affair by a duel betw<sup>τ</sup>een&nbsp;Roland, the emperor’s nephew’, and Oliver, the son of Regnier de&nbsp;Gênes. The two had previously become fast friends, and Roland&nbsp;loves Aude, Oliver’s sister ; consequently, although they fight with&nbsp;great vigour and equality of strength, they throw aside their swords&nbsp;in the middle of the combat and embrace one another as worthy&nbsp;brothers-in-arms. A fitting compromise is found between the&nbsp;warring parties in an agreement that they shall all unite and&nbsp;attack the Saracen conquerors of Spain. Then begins the famous&nbsp;expedition which ended at Roncesvalles.</span></p>
