Draw the horizontal line AH in the plane of the triangle ABC, then BAH will be the apparent angle of elevation or depression of B, according as it is above or below the horizon of A.</p><p>Take CD = CA, and join AD ; the line BD is the difference between the heights of the stations A and B, and to determine BD, the vertical angle BAD must be known ; now this angle differs from the apparent elevation BAH by the angle HAD, therefore HAD is the correction of the vertical angle, depending on the earth’s curvature.</p><p>In the isosceles triangle ACD, the sum of its angles, that is, 2CAD + C, is equal to two right angles <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geom.</hi> 11 and 24, 1 ), and therefore CAD + <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>C = one right angle ; but CAH is a right angle, therefore CAH = CAD + <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>C, and taking away the common angle CAD, there remains HAD = <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>C. Hence the correction on account of the earth’s curvature is <hi rend="italic">half the arc intercepted between the stations.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cor.</hi> If the station B be above the horizon, as seen from A, the corrected vertical angle will be the sum of its apparent elevation and half C, the angle contained by the verticals passing through the stations ; but if B be below the horizon, then it will be the excess of half C above the apparent depression.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Ex.</hi> In the British trigonometrical survey, the distance between the stations on Wisp Hill and Cross Fell was found to be 235,018∙6 feet, which, reckoning 6094<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> feet to a minute, corresponds to 38' 33"∙7 on the earth’s surface. From Wisp Hill, Cross Fell appeared depressed below its horizon 2' 31"; but, by a corresponding observation at the other station, the error arising from refraction was estimated at 2’ 37"∙3. Hence the difference between the heights of the stations is required.</p><p>Let A be Wisp Hill, B Cross Fell. The observed depression HAB was 2' 31”; but as the line AB was elevated 2' 37"∙3 by refraction, the correct value of HAB was 2' 31" + 2' 37"∙3 = 5' 8'∙3. This subtracted from HAD = <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi>C = 19' 16"∙8, leaves 14' 8"∙5 for the vertical angle BAD. And because in the triangle BAD the angle D is almost a right angle, therefore BD will be found by this proportion ; rad.: tan. BAD(14'8"∙5).: AD(235,018’6):BD= 966∙8 feet, the height of the station on Cross Fell above that on Wisp Hill.</p><p>On a survey, it will sometimes happen that the instrument cannot he conveniently placed at the very centre of a station, in order to determine the angles subtended by remote objects : it must then be placed at a point near the station, and the angles taken at that point must be corrected by calculation, so as to reduce them to the centre. How this may be done is shown in the next problem.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prob.</hi> III.</p><p>To reduce an angle taken out of a station to the centre of the station.</p><p>Let C be the centre of a permanent station (fig. 4), where the angle ACB, subtended by two remote objects A and B, is to be determined ; let O be a given point at a little distance, where the instrument is placed, and the angle A OB actually measured ; then, having given the distance CO, and the angles COA, COB ; also the distances C A, CB, or at least their values nearly, it is required to find the difference between the angles ACB, A OB.</p><p>Let I be the intersection of AC and BO; and because the angle AIB is the sum of ACB and CBO, also the sum of AOB and CAO <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geom.</hi> 24, 1) ; therefore</p><p>ACB + CBO = AOB + CAO, and ACB — AOB = CAO — CBO.</p><p>Now, in the triangles COA, COB,</p><p>CA : CO : : sin. COA : sin. CAO,<lb/>CB : CO : : sin. COB : sin. CBO.</p><p>From these proportions, the angles CAO, CBO may be found, and their difference, which is also the difference of the angles ACB, AOB will be known.</p><p>It is useful in practice to have a formula that expresses the difference of the angles BCA, BOA in minutes of a degree. For this purpose, put the angles</p><p>ACB = C, AOB = O, BOC <hi rend="italic">= v;</hi> then COA = O <hi rend="italic">v</hi>,∙ also put the lines CA = m, CB = <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> OC <hi rend="italic">=d ;</hi></p><p>then the two proportions become</p><p><hi rend="italic">m : d : :</hi> sin.
