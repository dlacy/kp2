<p><span class="font3">have a great future before them. Plates of asbestos used as slates or tiles make a light, strong and fireproof covering. Large terracotta tiles or slabs are much used in the United States of America.&nbsp;A good form of flat roof is that in which concrete is used as a foundation for a waterproof layer of asphalt, laid to slight falls to allow&nbsp;the water to run off easily. This is the usual method adopted when a&nbsp;roof garden is required. Shingles or thatch look extremely well on&nbsp;a roof, but their use is debarred in a great many districts owing to&nbsp;the danger of fire. Galvanized iron tiles, zinc tiles and copper tiles&nbsp;may be employed on small areas with good effect. “ Willesden&nbsp;paper,&quot; often used as an insulating layer beneath slates and tiles,&nbsp;is also at times used as a roof covering. It is cardboard chemically&nbsp;treated to render it tough, waterproof and fire-resisting..</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">From these particulars it is easy to calculate the weight of a square (100 superficial ft.) of roofing material, this being the usual standard&nbsp;of measurement for many roofing materials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The London Building Act of 1894 and its amendments set forth with regard to roofs erected in the London district that every&nbsp;structure on a roof is to be covered with slate, tile, metal&nbsp;or other incombustible material, except wooden cornices&nbsp;and barge boards to dormers not exceeding 12 in. in depth,&nbsp;and doors and windows and their frames. Every dwelling-house&nbsp;or factory above 30 ft. in height and having a parapet must have&nbsp;means of access to the roof. The pitch of the roofs of warehouse&nbsp;buildings must not exceed 47°, and those of other buildings must&nbsp;not exceed 75°, but towers, turrets and spires are excepted. In&nbsp;domestic buildings not more than two storeys are to be formed in&nbsp;the roof, and if the floor is more than 60 ft. above the street level&nbsp;fireproof materials must be used throughout and a sufficient means&nbsp;of escape provided. The building by-laws of the municipality of&nbsp;Johannesburg contain several clauses affecting the designing of&nbsp;roofs and their method of construction. In the designing of buildings roof-slopes must be within a line drawn and produced from the&nbsp;ground level at the opposice side of the street to the top of the eaves,&nbsp;gutter or parapet. No roof in the .municipal fire limit may be&nbsp;constructed of thatch, reed or other inflammable material. Without the fire area they may be so constructed if the building stands&nbsp;at least 20 ft. from the boundary of its site. Roofs having a pitch&nbsp;of less than 22 1/2° must be constructed to bear safely a load of at least&nbsp;28 lb per square foot of surface. Roofs of steeper pitch must be&nbsp;able to support a live load of 21 lb per square foot. The framing&nbsp;of Mansard or other roofs of more than 6o° pitch on a building&nbsp;exceeding 45 ft. high must be constructed of approved fireproof&nbsp;material at least 2 in. thick. No roofs except those of towers,&nbsp;turrets or spires shall exceed 70° pitch for a Mansard or 60<sup>0</sup> for&nbsp;an ordinary roof. Every fireproof roof, in addition to a door or&nbsp;scuttle for access from below, must have a Skylight or skylights with&nbsp;metallic framing, having an area equal to at least one-sixtieth the&nbsp;area of the roof. Skylights placed over rooms or areas to which&nbsp;the public have access must be protected by wire netting below or</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">be glazed with wire-wove glass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Building and Health Laws and Regulations and Amendments of 1905 affecting the city of New York are based, so far as the&nbsp;construction of roofs goes, upon the same lines as those of London,&nbsp;the principal exceptions being that they give very full working&nbsp;details, under part.24, as to the strengths of materials required to&nbsp;be used and the wind pressure to be provided against. In part 17&nbsp;they provide that where a building exceeds three storeys or 40 ft.&nbsp;in height and the roof has a pitch of over 60°, it shall be constructed&nbsp;of iron rafters and be lathed with iron or steel on the inside and&nbsp;plastered or be filled in with fireproof material not less than 3 in.&nbsp;thick and covered with metal, slate or tile.

In the comparatively rare cases in which these&nbsp;feathers persist, the rook may be readily known from the black&nbsp;form of crow </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{q.v.)</span><span class="font3"> by the rich purple gloss of its black plumage,&nbsp;especially on the head and neck, the feathers of which are soft&nbsp;and not pointed. In a general way the appearance and manners&nbsp;of the rook are well known, and particularly its habit of forming&nbsp;communities in the breeding-season, which it possesses in a&nbsp;measure beyond that of any other land bird of the northern&nbsp;hemisphere. Yet each of these communities, or rookeries,&nbsp;seems to have some custom intrinsically its own. In a general&nbsp;way the least-known parts of the rook’s mode of life are facts&nbsp;relating to its migration and geographical distribution. Though&nbsp;the great majority of rooks in Britain are sedentary or only&nbsp;change their abode to a very limited extent, it is now certain&nbsp;that a very considerable number arrive in or towards autumn,&nbsp;not necessarily to abide, but merely to pass onward, like most&nbsp;other kinds of birds, to winter farther southwards; and, at&nbsp;the same season or even a little earlier, it cannot be doubted&nbsp;that a large proportion of the young of the year migrate in&nbsp;the same direction. As a species the rook on the European&nbsp;continent only resides during the whole year throughout the&nbsp;middle tract of its ordinary range. Farther to the northward,&nbsp;as in Sweden and northern Russia, it is a regular summer-immigrant, while farther to the southward, as in southern&nbsp;France, Spain and most parts of Italy, it is, on the contrary,&nbsp;a regular winter-immigrant. The same is found to be the&nbsp;case in Asia, where it extends eastward as far as the upper&nbsp;Irtish and the Ob. It breeds throughout Turkestan, in the&nbsp;cold weather visiting Afghanistan, Cashmere and the Punjab,&nbsp;and Sir Oliver St John found a rookery of considerable size&nbsp;at Casbin in Persia. In Palestine and in lower Egypt it is&nbsp;only a winter-visitant, and H. B. Tristram noticed that it&nbsp;congregates in great numbers about the mosque of Omar in&nbsp;Jerusalem. The same writer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">{Proc. Zool. Soc.,</span><span class="font3"> 1864, p. 444;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ibis,</span><span class="font3"> 1866, pp. 68, 69) considered the Palestine rook entitled&nbsp;to specific distinction as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Corvus Agricola.</span><span class="font3"> The rook of China&nbsp;has also been described as a distinct species, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">C. pastinator&nbsp;{Proc.
