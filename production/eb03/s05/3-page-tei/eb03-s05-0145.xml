He was the diſciple of Xenarchus, a Peripatetic philoſopher, and at length attached himſelf to the Stoics. He contracted a ſtrict friendſhip with Cornelius Gallus, governor of Egypt, and travelled into ſeveral countries to obſerve the situation of places, and the cuſtoms of nations. He flouriſhed under Auguſtus, and died under Tiberius about the year 25, in a very advanced age.— He compoſed ſeveral works, all of which are loſt except his Geography in 17 books; which are juſtly eſteemed very precious remains of antiquity. The two firſt books are employed in ſhowing, that the ſtudy of geography is not only worthy of, but even neceſſary to, a philoſopher ; the third deſcribes Spain; the fourth, Gaul and the Britannic iſles ; the fifth and ſixth, Italy and the adjacent iſles ; the ſeventh, which is imperfect at the end, Germany, the countries of the Getæ and Illyrii, Taurica Cherſonesus, and Epirus; the eighth, ninth, and tenth, Greece with the neighbouring iſles; the four following, Alia within Mount Taurus; the fifteenth and ſixteenth, Aſia without Taurus, India, Perſia, Syria, Arabia; and the seventeenth, Egypt, Æthiopia, Carthage, and other places of Africa. Strabo’s work was publiſhed with a Latin verſion by Xylander, and notes by Iſaac Caſaubon (or rather by Henry Scrimzeer, from whom Caſaubon chiefly ſtole them), at Paris, 1620, in folio. But the beſt edition is that of Amſterdam in 1707, in two volumes folio, by the learned Theodore Janſonius ab Alrnelooveen, with the entire notes of Xylander, Caſaubon, Meurſius, Cluver, Holſtenius, Salmalius, Bochart, Ez. Spanheim, Cellarius, and others. To this edition is ſubjoined the <hi rend="italic">Chrestomathiae,</hi> or epitome of Strabo; which according to Mr Dodwell, who has written a very elaborate and learned diſſertation about it, was made by ſome unknown perſon between the years of Chriſt 676 and 996. It has been found of ſome uſe, not only in helping to correct the original, but in ſupplying in ſome meaſure the defect in the ſeventh book. Mr Dodwell’s dissertation is prefixed to this edition.</p><p>STRADA (Famianus), a very ingenious and learned Jeſuit, was born at Rome the latter end of the 16th century, and taught rhetoric there, in a public manner, for fifteen years. He wrote ſeveral pieces upon the art of oratory, and publiſhed ſome orations with a view of illuſtrating by example what he had inculcated by precept. But his <hi rend="italic">Proluſiones Academicae</hi> and his Histor<hi rend="italic">ia de Bello Belgico</hi> are the works which raised his reputation, and have preſerved his memory. His hiſtory of the war of Flanders was publiſhed at Rome; the firſt decad in 1640, the ſecond in '647; the whole extending from the death of Charles V. which happened in 1558, to the year 1590. It is written in good Latin, as all allow; but its merit in other respects has been variouſly determined. His <hi rend="italic">Proluſiones Academicae</hi> ſhow great ingenuity, and a maſterly ſkill in claſſical literature ; that prolusion especially in which he introduces Lucan, Lucretius, Claudian, Ovid, Statius, and Virgil, each of them versifying according to his own ſtrain. They have been often printed. We know not the year of Strada’s birth or of his death.</p><p>STRAHAN (William), an eminent printer, was born at Edinburgh in the year 1715. His father, who had a ſmall appointment in the cuſtoms, gave his ſon the education which every one of decent rank then received in a country where the avenues to learning were eaſy, and open to men of the moll moderate circumſtances. After having paſſed through the tuition of a grammar ſchool, he was put apprentice to a printer ; and when a very young man, removed to a wider sphere in that line of buſineſs, and went to follow his trade in London. Sober, diligent, and attentive while his emoluments were for ſome time very ſcanty, he contrived to live rather within than beyond his income ; and though he married early, and without ſuch a proviſion as prudence might have looked for in the eſtablishment of a family, he continued to thrive, and to better his circumſtances. This he would often mention as an encouragement to early matrimony ; and uſed to say, that he never had a child born that Providence did not ſend ſome increaſe of income to provide for the increaſe of his houſehold. With ſufficient vigour of mind, he had that happy flow of animal ipirits that is not eaſily diſcouraged by unpromiſing appearances.</p><p>His abilities in his profeſſion, accompanied with perfect integrity and unabating diligence, enabled him, after the firſt difficulties were overcome, to advance with rapid ſucceſs. And he was one of the most flouriſhing men of the trade, when, in the year 1770, he purchaſed a ſhare of the patent for king’s printer of Mr Eyre, with whom he maintained the moſt cordial intimacy during the reſt of his life. Beſide the emoluments ariſing from this appointment, as well as from a very extenſive private buſineſs, he now drew largely from a field which required ſome degree of ſpeculative ſagacity to cultivate on account of the great literary property which he acquired by purchaſing the copy-rights of the moſt celebrated authors of the time. In this his liberality kept equal pace with his prudence, and in ſome caſes went perhaps rather beyond it. Never had ſuch rewards been given to the labours of literary men as now were received from him and his aſſociates in thoſe purchases of copy-rights from authors.</p></body></text></TEI>
