in the oriental cuſtoms, the perſon who has the care of the moſques in Egypt ; his duty is the ſame as that of the imams at Conſtantinople. There are more or fewer of theſe to every moſque, according to its ſize or revenue. One of theſe is head over the rest, and anſwers to a pariſh-prieſt with us ; and has under him, in large moſques, the readers, and people who cry out to go to prayers ; but in ſmall moſques the ſheik is obliged to do all this himſelf. In ſuch it is their buſineſs to open the moſque, to cry to prayers, and to begin their ſhort devotions at the head of the congregation, who ſtand rank and file in great order, and make all their motions together. Every Friday the ſheik makes an harangue to his congregation.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SHEIK-Bellet,</hi> the name of an officer in the Oriental nations. In Egypt the ſheik-bellet is the head of a city, and is appointed by the pacha. The buſineſs of this officer is to take care that no innovations be made which may be prejudicial to the Porte, and that they ſend no orders which may hurt the liberties of the people. But all his authority depends on his credit and intereſt, not his office : for the government of Egypt is of ſuch a kind, that often the people of the leaſt power by their poſts have the greateſt influence ; and a caia of the janizaries or Arabs, and ſometimes one of their meaneſt officers, an oda-baſha, finds means, by his parts and abilities, to govern all things.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
