<p><span class="font0">in the dense moist forests of the basin of the Rio San Juan, where the rain falls for nine months in the year. It prefers rich fertile&nbsp;soil on the banks of watercourses,&nbsp;but does not flourish in swamps. It&nbsp;is found also in Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Cuba and&nbsp;Hayti, and in Panama with another&nbsp;species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castilloa,</span><span class="font0"> and on the W.&nbsp;coast of S. America down to the slopes&nbsp;of Chimborazo; the Cordilleras of&nbsp;the Andes separating the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castilloas</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heveas</span><span class="font0"> of Brazil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Nicaragua the latex is collected</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">in April, when the old leaves begin to fall and the new ones are appearing,&nbsp;during which time the latex is richest.&nbsp;The tree is tapped either in the. same&nbsp;manner as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea,</span><span class="font0"> or by encircling&nbsp;the tree with a simple spiral cut at&nbsp;an inclination of 45°, or by two&nbsp;parallel spirals if the tree be large.&nbsp;At the bottom, of the spiral an iron&nbsp;spout about 4 in. long is driven into&nbsp;the tree, and the milk is received in&nbsp;iron pails. A tree 20 to 30 ft. high to&nbsp;its first branches, and about 4 it. in&nbsp;diameter, is expected to yield annually&nbsp;20 gallons of milk, each gallon giving&nbsp;about 2 lb. of rubber. In the evening&nbsp;the milk is strained through a wire&nbsp;sieve and transferred to barrels. The&nbsp;milk, which is acid, is coagulated by&nbsp;the addition of the alkaline juice of&nbsp;the “ achete ” plant, or of another&nbsp;plant called &quot; coasso.” The strained&nbsp;juice of either of these plants, obtained by bruising the moistened herb&nbsp;and subsequent expression, is added&nbsp;to the. milk in the proportion of about I pint to the gallon.&nbsp;In British Honduras an alkaline decoction prepared from the&nbsp;Moon plant </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Calonictyon speciosum}</span><span class="font0"> is used for the same purpose.&nbsp;If these plants </span><span class="font1">are </span><span class="font0">not procurable, two parts of water are&nbsp;added to one of the milk, and the mixture allowed to stand&nbsp;for twelve hours. The coagulum is next flattened out by a&nbsp;wooden or iron roller to get rid of the cavities containing watery&nbsp;liquid, and the sheets are then hung up for fourteen days to dry,&nbsp;when they weigh about 2 lb, the sheets being usually J to J in.&nbsp;thick and. 20 in. in diameter. When coagulated in water, the mass&nbsp;is placed in vats, in the ground and allowed to dry, this taking place&nbsp;in about a fortnight. It is then rolled into balls. That which dries&nbsp;on the incisions in the. tree is called “ bola ” or “ burucha,” and&nbsp;is said to be highly prized in New York. The loss of Nicaragua&nbsp;rubber in drying is estimated at 15%. It is exported chiefly from&nbsp;San Juan del Norte, or Grey Town, and the larger proportion goes&nbsp;to the United States. . The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castilloa</span><span class="font0"> tree appears to be suitable for&nbsp;cultivation only in districts where the Para rubber would grow&nbsp;equally well. The tree is ready for tapping at about the same age&nbsp;as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea</span><span class="font0"> and the average yield of rubber is about the same. Since&nbsp;the latex '* creams ”. readily the rubber can be separated from the&nbsp;latex by centrifugalizing, and its quality and market value thus&nbsp;enhanced. Much of the native </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castilloa</span><span class="font0"> rubber is of inferior quality.&nbsp;The tree has been introduced into S. India, Ceylon and the W. Indies,&nbsp;where it has succeeded well, especially in Trinidad and Tobago. It&nbsp;is also under trial in E. and W. Africa and Nyasaland. Several other&nbsp;species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castilloa</span><span class="font0"> than </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. elastica</span><span class="font0"> are known to furnish rubber, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">little has been recorded as to their advantages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4.. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Funtumia elastica</span><span class="font0"> (formerly known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kickxia</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kixia</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">elastica)</span><span class="font0"> is the W. African (Ire or Irai or Lagos) rubber tree, which belongs to the Apocynaceae, a natural order which includes the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Landolphia</span><span class="font0"> vines as well as other rubber producers. It is a large&nbsp;forest tree of upright habit extending to 60 or 70 ft. in height and&nbsp;3 to 4 ft. in diameter. The bright green, glabrous leaves are broad&nbsp;and oblong, about 6 in. in length (see fig. 5). The flowers are yellow,&nbsp;and the seeds enclosed in a pod are long and thin with numerous&nbsp;long silky fibres attached, to them, which enable the seeds to be&nbsp;readily carried by the wind. The trees are common throughout&nbsp;the central regions of E. and W. Africa (from Uganda to Sierra&nbsp;Leone). The botanical name is taken from a W. African native&nbsp;name for a rubber tree—“ Funtum.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many of the trees in the accessible forests of W. Africa have been destroyed by over-tapping and felling. Plantations of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fun-lamia</span><span class="font0"> have been established in several districts, including the Gold&nbsp;Coast and S. Nigeria. The trees are tapped on the “ herring-bone ”&nbsp;plan and the milk collected in vessels at the base. This *is then&nbsp;poured into the hollowed-out trunk of a tree, where it is allowed&nbsp;to stand covered with palm leaves for about a fortnight. The&nbsp;watery portion of. the latex soaks into the trunk, and the soft&nbsp;spongy rubber which remains is kneaded and pressed into lumps&nbsp;or balls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In some districts the collected milk is heated alone or diluted with water, to coagulate the rubber, but if heated alone an inferior&nbsp;rubber is apt to result owing to overheating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Funtumia</span><span class="font0"> latex can also be coagulated by the. astringent infusion of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bauhinia</span><span class="font0"> leaves or by exposing it in shallow dishes, when&nbsp;the liquid “ creams.” The yield of rubber is stated as a rule to&nbsp;be less than that of Para. The rubber, if properly prepared, is of&nbsp;excellent quality, and the tree deserves further attention, especially&nbsp;in those regions of W. Africa which are unsuited to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Funtumia africana</span><span class="font0"> furnishes a very inferior rubber, which is highly resinous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ficus elastica</span><span class="font0"> is the tree which produces Rambong or Assam rubber. It is well known in Europe as a small ornamental tree,&nbsp;but in the tropics it attains very large dimensions, and develops a system of branching roots which act as buttresses to the&nbsp;large trunk (see fig. 6). It is a native of India, Burma and the&nbsp;Malay Archipel</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ago, and is most</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">abundant in those</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">regions in which</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the climate is dis</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tinctly humid, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">subject to this</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">condition the tree</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">flourishes at high</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">altitudes. In As</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">sam and in upper</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Burma there are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">extensive forests</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ficus elastica,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">but to a large ex</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tent the trees have</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">been damaged by</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">careless tapping.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Large plantations</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">have been formed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">by the Govern</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ment of India</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">both in Assam and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Bengal, but most</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the rubber ex</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ported is still ob</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tained from the forest trees. It has been found that although, the tree grows well in many different countries and. different localities,&nbsp;it only furnishes a satisfactory yield of rubber in mountainous districts, such as those of Assam and certain parts of Ceylon and&nbsp;Java. The trees are tapped when about ten years old and as a&nbsp;rule annually furnish from 5-10 lb of rubber per tree. The latex&nbsp;flows fairly well, but is usually allowed to dry on the tree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rubber, if of good quality, sells at prices only slightly inferior to that of Para. When the plantations of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ficus</span><span class="font0"> in India are in full&nbsp;bearing it is possible that this tree may attract more attention, since&nbsp;the plantation rubber is likely to be of superior quality owing to the&nbsp;greater care taken in its preparation. It seems at present doubtful,&nbsp;however, whether the establishment of plantations of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ficus</span><span class="font0"> will be&nbsp;profitable under ordinary conditions in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the trees described above there are numerous plants of some importance as rubber producers. Among these may&nbsp;be mentioned the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Landolphia</span><span class="font0"> vines, which are still the chief source&nbsp;of African rubber. The vines grow upon forest trees, and the&nbsp;stems are periodically tapped. There are numerous species, of these&nbsp;climbing plants, of which the most important as furnishing good&nbsp;rubber are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Landolphia owariensis</span><span class="font0"> (see fig. 7), which occurs throughout</span></p>
