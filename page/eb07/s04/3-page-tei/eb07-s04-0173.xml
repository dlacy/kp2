Every</p><p>thing being left as formerly, only the piston being nearly at the top of the cylinder <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, you are to pass the rope round a second pulley, hung from a staple ; and by a hook to suspend from the rope the scale of a large balance, which you are to load with a weight of 2686 pounds. If a small syringe be applied by a little boy to the stopcock X to pump out the air. it will follow that, as the air is pumped out from below the piston, the atmosphere above will press it down and raise the weight.”</p><p>The transition from this to the engine of Newcomen is immediate. To the last-described apparatus of Guericke let there be added a small copper globe or boiler, Z, Fig. 22, to be placed over a fire till the water which it contains boils into steam. This steam, entering below the piston, will occupy the whole space of the cylinder ; but if now the stop cock X be suddenly closed, and especially if cold water be sprinkled on the outside of it to cool it, the steam will be condensed back</p><p>into its original bulk of water, and leave the space it formerly occupied in the cylinder a vacuum, into which the atmosphere will press down the piston PQ R, just as in the former instance, raising up the weights at the other end of the rope. This is just the atmospheric engine of Newcomen.</p><p>It is the atmosphere which does the work ; the steam acts indirectly as the medium through which a vacuum is effected ; and it is only the efficient agency of the atmosphere which is thus rendered useful in giving motion to a weight.</p><p>We hope that nothing which we have here said concerning thé discoveries of Guericke will be misunderstood, as intended in any way to depreciate the value set upon the inventions of Mr Savary or Mr Newcomen ; they are only introduced as illustrations by which we are most easily conducted to a thorough comprehension of the principles on which they act, and of the state of knowledge of atmospheric pressure which existed at that date. The experimental apparatus of Guericke was in no respect a steam-engine ; and although his speculations were divulged before the inventions of Savary and Newcomen, the agency of steam still remained to be introduced, before a machine useful to the arts and industry of man was pro duced.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Newcomen's FireEngine.—</hi>Switzer, in his Hydrostatics, (1729) has the following passage :—“ To finish this long account of the surprising engine for the raising of water by fire, I produce this last improvement of it by Mr Thomas Newcomen, which makes it undoubtedly the beautifullest and most useful engine that any age or country ever yet produced, as the best and most useful inventions and improvements which have been discovered either in art or nature, have, in process of time, been liable to improvement, so this, of the fire-engine, has been subject to the same, for this ingenious gentleman to whom we owe this late invention, has, with a great deal of modesty, but as much judgment, given the finishing</p></body></text></TEI>
