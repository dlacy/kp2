        <p><span class="font1">III.@@<sup>1</sup> Some of the pottery found in the Esquiline
                necropolis was of that rare kind which is coated with white and coloured
                stanniferous enamels, examples of which have been found in Ægina and&nbsp;at Camirus
                in Rhodes,—a method of decoration which is not&nbsp;Hellenic, but was common in
                Assyria and Egypt.@@<sup>2</sup> Some of the&nbsp;Esquiline tombs also contained
                terra-cotta reliefs of Oriental character, covered with plumbo-vitreous glaze,
                coloured brilliant blues&nbsp;and greens, like the little figures so commonly found
                in Egypt.&nbsp;Some dim traditions of these earlier inhabitants certainly
                existed&nbsp;among the Romans : Dion Cassius (iii. 5), to account for the existence
                of a city on the Palatine earlier than the traditional Roma&nbsp;Quadrata, invents
                an earlier Romulus and Remus to be its founders.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The most important existing relics of the time when Roman history
                first begins, though dimly, to take a definite shape are the&nbsp;so-called “wall of
                Romulus,” forming the circuit of the famous&nbsp;Roma Quadrata of the Palatine.
                Unfortunately the accounts of&nbsp;the extent of the Pomcerium </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Postmarvum')</span><span class="font1"> or
                sacred enclosure give&nbsp;but little help towards defining its circuit. Even its
                precise nature&nbsp;is a matter of doubt, in spite of the accounts of it given by
                Varro&nbsp;(Z.i., v. 143), Livy (i. 44), and Dionysius (i. 88), as is usually
                the&nbsp;case with descriptions in ancient writers of what was in their
                time&nbsp;purely an archæological matter. It is, however, certain that
                the&nbsp;Pomœrium in some way or other followed the circuit of the primitive city,
                called from its shape Roma Quadrata.@@<sup>4</sup> Its boundaries&nbsp;are given
                thus by Tacitus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >{Ann.,</span><span class="font1"> xii. 24) : Startingfrom the Forum&nbsp;Boarium at
                the west corner of the Palatine, it goes to the Ara&nbsp;Maxima (see Hnιι.
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inst.,</span><span
                class="font1"> 1854, p. 28) and the Ara Consi, both probably in the Vallis Murciæ,
                afterwards occupied by the Circus&nbsp;Maximus ; but the exact positions of these
                points are unknown.@@<sup>5</sup>&nbsp;The next stages are the Curiæ Veteres, the
                Sacellum Laram, and&nbsp;lastly the Forum Romanum. Unfortunately the known points
                in&nbsp;this description, namely the two fora, are precisely those which&nbsp;mark
                that part of the circuit known from existing remains of the&nbsp;walls. It is
                therefore to the scanty relics of the wall which still&nbsp;exist on the other sides
                that we must turn to determine the extent&nbsp;of Roma Quadrata. These enable us to
                fix its line along the whole&nbsp;valley of the Velabrum, on the west of the hill,
                and along the&nbsp;valley of the Circus Maximus as far as the so-called Domus
                Gelo-tiana, about half-way on the south side (see fig. 17). The doubtful&nbsp;point
                has been whether the line of the wall from north to south&nbsp;included the whole
                extent of the hill, or passed across it, along the&nbsp;line of that deep natural
                valley which once divided the Palatine&nbsp;into two parts, and was in later times
                filled up and built upon by&nbsp;Domitian in the construction of his great palace.
                Recent excavations have, however, disclosed at several points the existence of
                this&nbsp;ancient wall extending along the south-eastern part of the Palatine
                ;&nbsp;moreover, there is strong evidence as to Roma Quadrata being coextensive with
                the whole hill from Cicero, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De
                Rep.,</span><span class="font1"> ii. 6, and Aul.&nbsp;Gell., xiii. 14. Traces of the
                wall have been found running eastwards from the Porta Mugonia, and that piece of
                wall by the&nbsp;Domus Gelotiana which starts to run northwards across the
                middle&nbsp;of the hill has been found to be merely a projecting spur,
                which&nbsp;again turns eastwards, so as to include apparently the rest of
                the&nbsp;Palatine where the palace of Severus now stands.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The most perfect remains of the Romulean wall are those near the west
                angle of the hill (see fig. 7). These show that the fortifications of Roma Quadrata
                were formed in the usual manner of&nbsp;Etruscan cities, in which the natural
                strength given by cliffs was&nbsp;increased by artificial means. The wall was set
                neither at the top&nbsp;nor at the foot of the hill, but more than half-way up, a
                level&nbsp;terrace or shelf all round being cut in the rock on which the
                base&nbsp;of the wall stood. Above that the hill was cut away into a cliff,&nbsp;not
                quite perpendicular but slightly “battering” inwards, to give&nbsp;greater stability
                to the wall, which was built up against it, like a&nbsp;retaining wall, reaching to
                the top of the cliff, and probably a few&nbsp;feet higher. The stones used in this
                wall are soft tufa, a warm&nbsp;brown in colour, and full of masses of charred wood.
                The cutting&nbsp;to form the steep cliff probably supplied part of the material
                for&nbsp;the wall ; and ancient quarries, afterwards used as reservoirs
                for&nbsp;water, exist in the mass of rock on which the so-called temple
                of&nbsp;Jupiter Victor stands. It has been asserted that these tufa blocks&nbsp;are
                not cut but split with wedges ; this, however, is not the case.&nbsp;Tufa does not
                split into rectangular masses, but would be shattered&nbsp;to pieces by a wedge ;
                moreover, distinct tool-marks can be seen on&nbsp;all the blocks whose surface is
                well preserved and in the quarries</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">themselves. Chisels from one-fourth to three-fourths of an inch in
                width were used, and also a sharp-pointed pick or hammer. The&nbsp;wall is about 10
                feet thick at the bottom, and increases in thickness&nbsp;above as the scarped cliff
                against which it is built recedes. It is&nbsp;built of blocks laid in alternate
                courses of headers and stretchers,&nbsp;varying in thickness from 22 to 24 inches,
                in length from 3 to 5&nbsp;feet, and in width from</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">19 to 22 inches. These</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">blocks are carefully</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">worked on their beds,</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">but the face is left</span></p>

        <p><span class="font1">ancient wall. One of these (No. 8) in early times (before water in
                abundance was brought to the Palatine on aqueducts) was used as&nbsp;a reservoir to
                collect surface water, probably for use in case of siege ;&nbsp;circular shafts for
                buckets are cut downwards through the rock from&nbsp;the top of the hill ; fig. 7
                shows it in section. An exactly similar&nbsp;rock-cut cistern with vertical shafts,
                of very early date, exists at&nbsp;Alba Longa. Opposite the church of S. Teodoro a
                series of buttresses belonging to the wall of Romulus exists, partly concealed
                by&nbsp;a long line of buildings of the later years of the republic and
                the&nbsp;early empire, to make room for which the greater part of the
                then&nbsp;useless wall was pulled down, and only fragments left here and
                there,&nbsp;where they could be worked into the walls of the later
            houses.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Three accesses only to the ancient city can now be traced. One is the
                so-called Scalæ Caci, a long sloping ascent cut through the&nbsp;rock (see fig. 17)
                from the side of the Circus Maximus ; some&nbsp;remains of the earliest wall still
                exist along the sides of this steep&nbsp;ascent or staircase. The upper part of this
                has remains of a basalt&nbsp;pavement, added in later times, probably covering the
                more ancient&nbsp;rock-cut steps. The name of the gate which led at this point
                into&nbsp;Roma Quadrata is unknown. The only two gates whose name and&nbsp;position
                can be (with any degree of probability) identified are the&nbsp;Porta Romanulaand
                the Porta Mugionis (Plin., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >H.N.,</span><span class="font1"> iii. 5, 9).&nbsp;The former of these, called Porta
                Romana by Festus (ed. Müller,&nbsp;p. 262), was at the foot of the Clivus Victoriæ
                (see fig. 17), at the&nbsp;angle next the Forum Romanum.@@<sup>6</sup> According to
                Festus it was so&nbsp;called by the Sabines of the Capitol because it was their
                natural&nbsp;entrance to Roma Quadrata (see also Varro, Z.i., v. 164, vi.
                24).&nbsp;The original approach to it was by a road running up the
                lower&nbsp;extra-mural part of the hill from the direction of the Velabrum.&nbsp;In
                later times a more direct ascent to it was made from the Forum&nbsp;by a flight of
                steps, probably the Scalæ Anulariæ of Suetonius </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">{Aug.,&nbsp;Ί2</span><span class="font1"> ; see figs. 16
                and 17 and plan of the Forum, Plate VII.). The&nbsp;lower part of these stairs, now
                buried under S. Maria Libératrice,&nbsp;is shown in the marble plan of Rome ; the
                upper part, that from&nbsp;the Nova Via to the Clivus Victoriæ, still exists, and
                has recently&nbsp;been exposed. Traces of the Porta Mugionis or Mugonia (see
                Sol.,&nbsp;i. 24) have been discovered near the temple of Jupiter Stator,
                where&nbsp;a basalt paved road leads up into the Palatine from the Summa&nbsp;Sacra
                Via and the Summa Nova Via, which join near the arch of&nbsp;Titus ; exposure to
                weather has now destroyed the soft tufa blocks&nbsp;of which this gate was built.
                This is probably the “veterem&nbsp;Jtortam Palatii ” of Livy (i. 12) through which
                the Romans fled&nbsp;when defeated by the Sabines. A third entrance,@@<sup>7</sup>
                according to the&nbsp;ancient Etruscan rule (see Servius, </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Ad Æn.,</span><span class="font1"> i. 422); probably
                existed on the east side of the hill, but its site is uncertain. Judging&nbsp;from
                the shape of the hill, it may very possibly have been under&nbsp;the existing palace
                of Severus, where a road leads from the stadium</span></p>
