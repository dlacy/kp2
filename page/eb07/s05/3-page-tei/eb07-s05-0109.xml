In this English Review, some Scotish authors do not find much favour. The historical works of Dr Ferguson and Dr Watson receive a liberal portion of praise ; but the Lectures of Dr Blair and the Dissertations of Dr Beattie are treated as works of very inferior merit and importance. It is observable that Smellie's translation of Buffon is not honoured with much commendation. Stuart had dedicated one of his works to the chief justice ; but the subsequent passage, which occurs in an article apparently written by him, affords a sufficient indication of his altered sentiments : “ Lord Mansfield, during the course of his long life, has been uniformly the zealous champion of prerogative ; and has exerted and prostituted his abilities to undermine the trial by jury, and the liberty of the press, those sacred and formidable bulwarks which support the glorious fabric of the English government.”</p><p>How long he continued to conduct the English Review, we are not informed. In 1785 he became the editor of “ The Political Herald and Review ; or a Survey of domestic and foreign Politics, and a critical Account of political and historical Publications.” This work, it is believed, only reached a second volume. One of his coadjutors, in this as well as the English Review, was Dr Thomson, who, like himself, was too great a lover of Burton ale. Their favourite haunt was the Peacock in Gray’s Inn Lane.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> It is too well known that Stuart’s mode of life had been such as to impair his health and strength. With a constitution undermined by disease, and a mind soured by disappointment, he embarked for Leith, and sought a place of rest under the roof of his father, who having become emeritus professor in 1775, was then residing at Musselburgh. The son was labouring under a dropsy, from which the usual operation afforded him a temporary relief; but all medical aid was ineffectual, and he descended to bis grave at the premature age of forty-four. He died on the 13th of August 1786, and his father survived till the 18th of June 1793.</p><p>Gilbert Stuart is thus described by a writer who seems to have had some personal knowledge of him : He “ was about the middle size, and justly proportioned. His countenance was modest and expressive, sometimes announcing sentiments of glowing friendship, of which he is said to have been truly susceptible ; at others, displaying strong indignation against folly and vice, which he had also shewn in his writings. With all his ardour for study, he yielded to the love of intemperance, to which, notwithstanding a strong constitution, be fell an early sacrifice.”@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>	(X.)</p><p>STUD, in the manège, a collection of breeding horses and mares.</p><p>STUDY (Ital. <hi rend="italic">Studio),</hi> a piece of instrumental music composed for the purpose of familiarizing the player with some of the difficulties of his instrument.

From the free school of his native town he was removed to Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was admitted on the 7th of November 1703. Having chosen the medical profession, he took the degree of Μ. B. in 1709, and that of Μ. D. in 1719. He first settled as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> practitioner at Boston; but in 1717 be removed to London, and was admitted a fellow of the College of Physicians in 1720. By the recommendation of Dr Mead, he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society. He contributed to the re-establishment of the Society of Antiquaries ; of which he officiated as secretary for many years. In 1726 he left the metropolis, and settled at Grantham in Lincolnshire, where he soon obtained extensive practice. In 1728 he married Frances, the daughter of Robert Williamson, Esq. of Allington, a lady of good family and fortune. Being much afflicted with the gout, he found the exercise of his profession very laborious, and therefore meditated a retreat into the church. On the 20th of July 1720, being then in the thirty-third year of his age, he received ordination from Archbishop Wake ; and in the ensuing October was presented by the lord-chancellor King to the living of All-Saints in Stamford. He became a widower in 1737, and, in the course of the following year, married the only daughter of Dr Gale, the learned dean of York. In 1739 the living of Somerby near Grantham was bestowed upon him by the duke of Ancaster. In 1747 the duke of Montagu presented him to the rectory of St George, Queen Square, and he then vacated his other benefices. He survived till the 3d of March 1765. On the 27th of the preceding month, he had been struck with palsy, after attending a full vestry on a contested election for a lecturer. The apartment was much heated ; and on returning through his garden, accompanied by Serjeant Eyre, “ they both caught their deaths, for the serjeant never was abroad again, and the doctor’s illness came on that night.” By his first wife Dr Stukeley bad three daughters, one of whom died young, and the other two survived him. The one was married to Mr Richard Fleming, an eminent solicitor, and the other to the Rev. Thomas Fairchild, rector of Pitsey in Essex. They both died in 1782. Of his second marriage there was no issue.</p><p><hi style="color:red; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" rend="ERROR">�</hi><note place="margin" type="conversion" resp="#teitodocx"><hi rend="docxError">unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</hi></note>supposed negociation he apparently refers to the year 1783, or some period subsequent to the appearance of the English Review.
