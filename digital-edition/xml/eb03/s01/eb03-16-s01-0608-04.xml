an ancient, large, rich, and populous city of Spain, in the kingdom of Leon, ſituated on the river Tormes, about 75 miles weſt from Madrid. It is ſaid to have been founded by Teucer the ſon of Telamon, who called it <hi rend="italic">Salamis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Salmantica,</hi> in memory of the ancient Salamis. Here is an univerfity, the greateſt in Spain, and perhaps inferior to none in the whole world, in reſpect at leaſt to its revenues, buildings, number of ſcholars, and maſters. Here are alſo many grand and magnificent palaces, ſquares, convents, churches, colleges, chapels, and hoſpitals. The biſhop of this country is ſuffragan to the archbiſhop of Compoſtella, and has a yearly revenue of 1000 ducats. A Roman way leads from hence to Merida and Seville, and there is an old Roman bridge over the river. Of</p><p>the colleges in the univerſity, four are appropriated to young men of quality; and near it is an infirmary for poor ſick ſcholars. W. Long. 6. 10. N. Lat. 41. 0.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
