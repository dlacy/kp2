<p><label>RENFREW</label>, 
the county-town of Renfrewshire, ſtanding on the ſmall river Cathcart, which flows into the Clyde at the diſtance of five miles from Glaſgow, is a fmall but ancient royal borough, the feat of the ſheriff’s court and of a preſhytery. The town is neat-ly built, and the inhabitants enjoy a tolerable ſhare of commerce.—Renfrew was originally joined to Lanerk, but wa9 made an independent sheriffdom by Robert II. who had a palace here.
