He therefore&nbsp;withdraws and Boaz comes in in his place. That this is the sense&nbsp;of the transaction is clear ; there is, however, a little obscurity in&nbsp;iv. 5, where one letter seems to have fallen out and we must read&nbsp;on ונםאתיות and translate “ What day thou buyest the field&nbsp;from Naomi thou must also buy Ruth,” &amp;c.

<p><span class="font2">RUTHERFURD, or Rutherford, Samuel (1600-1661), Scottish divine, was born about 1600 at the village of Nisbet in Roxburghshire. He is supposed to have&nbsp;received his early education at Jedburgh, and he entered&nbsp;the university of Edinburgh in 1617. He graduated M.A.&nbsp;in 1621, and two years afterwards was elected professor&nbsp;of humanity. On account of some alleged indiscretion&nbsp;or irregularity connected with his marriage in 1625, he&nbsp;resigned his professorship in that year, but, after studying theology, he was in 1627 appointed minister of An-woth, Kirkcudbrightshire, where he displayed remarkable&nbsp;diligence and zeal, alike as preacher, pastor, and student, and&nbsp;soon took a leading place among the clergy of Galloway.&nbsp;In 1636 his first book, entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Exerdtationes de Gratia&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">—an elaborate treatise against Arminianism—appeared at&nbsp;Amsterdam, and attracted some attention both in Great&nbsp;Britain and on the Continent. Combined with his strict&nbsp;and non-conforming presbyterianism, the severe Calvinism&nbsp;set forth in this work led to a prosecution by the new&nbsp;bishop of the diocese, Sydserff, in the High Commission&nbsp;Court, first at Wigtown and afterwards at Edinburgh, with&nbsp;the result that Rutherfurd was deposed from his pastoral&nbsp;office, and sentenced to confinement in Aberdeen during&nbsp;the king’s pleasure. His banishment lasted from September&nbsp;1636 to February 1638, and was chiefly remarkable for&nbsp;the epistolary activity he displayed, the greater number of&nbsp;his published </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span><span class="font2"> belonging to this period of his life.&nbsp;He was present at the signing of the Covenant in Edinburgh in 1638, and afterwards at the meeting of the&nbsp;Glasgow Assembly the same year, which restored him to&nbsp;his parish. In 1639 he was appointed professor of divinity in St Mary’s College, St Andrews, and shortly afterwards became colleague to Robert Blair in the church of&nbsp;St Andrews. He was sent up to London in 1643 as one&nbsp;of the eight commissioners from Scotland to the Westminster Assembly. Arriving along with Baillie in November, and remaining at his post over three years, he did great&nbsp;service to the cause of his party. In 1642 he had published his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Peaceable and Temperate Plea for Paul’s Presby-tede in Scotland,</span><span class="font2"> and the sequel to it in 1644 on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Due&nbsp;Right of Presbyteries</span><span class="font2"> provoked Milton's contemptuous&nbsp;reference to “mere A. S. and Rutherfurd” in his sonnet&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">On the New Forcers of Consdence under the Long Parliament.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">In 1644 also appeared Rutherfurd’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Rex, a Dispute for&nbsp;the Just Prerogative of King and People,</span><span class="font2"> which gives him a&nbsp;recognized place among the early writers on constitutional&nbsp;law; it was followed by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Divine Right of Church&nbsp;Government</span><span class="font2"> (1646), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Free Disputation against Pretended&nbsp;Liberty of Conscience</span><span class="font2"> (1649). Among his other works are&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tryal and Triumph of Faith</span><span class="font2"> (1645), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chdst Dying&nbsp;and Drawing Sinners to Himself</span><span class="font2"> (1647), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Survey of the&nbsp;Spirtual Antichrist</span><span class="font2"> (1648). In 1647 he returned to&nbsp;St Andrews to become principal of the New College there,&nbsp;and in 1648 and 1651 he declined successive invitations to&nbsp;theological chairs at Harderwijk and Utrecht. His last&nbsp;days were assailed by the persecution which followed the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Restoration in 1660. His </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Rex</span><span class="font2"> was ordered to be burned at the cross of Edinburgh, and also at the gate of&nbsp;the college. He was deprived of all his offices, and on&nbsp;a charge of high treason was cited to appear before the&nbsp;ensuing parliament. His health, however, now utterly&nbsp;broke down, and knowing that he had not long to live he&nbsp;drew up, on 26th February 1661, a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Testimony,</span><span class="font2"> which was&nbsp;posthumously published. He died on the 20th of the&nbsp;following March.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fame of Rutherfurd now rests principally upon his remarkable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Letters,</span><span class="font1"> on which Wodrow thus comments:—“He seems to have outdone even himself as w<sup>τ</sup>ell as everybody else in his admirable and every way singular letters, which, though jested upon by&nbsp;profane wits because of some familiar expressions, yet will be owned&nbsp;of all who have any relish of piety to contain such sublime flights of&nbsp;devotion and to be fraughted with such massy thoughts as loudly&nbsp;speak a soul united to Jesus Christ in the closest embraces, and must&nbsp;needs at once ravish and edify every serious reader.” In addition&nbsp;to the other works already mentioned, Rutherfurd published in 1651&nbsp;a treatise </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Divina Provulentia,</span><span class="font1"> against Molinism, Socinianism,&nbsp;and Arminianism, of which Richard Baxter, not without justice,&nbsp;remarked that “ as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span><span class="font1"> were the best piece so this was the&nbsp;worst he had ever read. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters,</span><span class="font0"> to the number of 215, were first published anonymously by M<sup>,</sup>Ward, an amanuensis, at Rotterdam, in 1664. They have been frequently reprinted, the&nbsp;best edition (365 letters) being that by Rev. A. A. Bonar, 1848, with a sketch of&nbsp;his life. See also a short </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font0"> by Rev. Dr Andrew Thomson, 1884.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RUTHERGLEN, an ancient royal burgh of Lanarkshire, Scotland, is situated near the left bank of the Clyde, 2 miles south-east of Glasgow. It consists chiefly of one&nbsp;long wide irregular street, with narrow streets, wynds, and&nbsp;alleys branching from it at intervals. The parish church&nbsp;is situated near the centre of the town, a little distance&nbsp;from the tower of the old church where the treaty was&nbsp;made in 1297 with Edward I., by which Sir John Mon-teith agreed with the English to betray the Scottish hero&nbsp;Wallace. The most important public building is the town-hall, a handsome structure with a large square tower. In&nbsp;the vicinity there are extensive collieries and ironworks,&nbsp;and the town possesses chemical works, a paper mill, a&nbsp;pottery, and a shipbuilding yard. The corporation consists&nbsp;of a provost, two bailies, a dean of guild, a treasurer, and&nbsp;fifteen councillors. The population of the royal burgh in&nbsp;1871 was 9239, and in 1881 it was 11,473.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rutherglen was erected into a royal burgh by King David in 1126. At this time it included a portion of Glasgow, but in 1226&nbsp;the boundaries were rectified so as to exclude the whole of that&nbsp;city. In early times it had a castle, which was taken by Bruce&nbsp;from the English in 1313. It was kept in good repair till after the&nbsp;battle of Langside it was burnt by order of the regent Murray.&nbsp;After this the town for a time gradually decayed, the trade being&nbsp;absorbed by Glasgow. Rutherglen is included in the Kilmarnock&nbsp;district of parliamentary burghs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RUTILIUS CLAUDIUS NAMATIANUS is known to us as the author of a Latin poem in elegiac metre, describing a coast voyage from Rome to Gaul in 416 a.d. The&nbsp;literary excellence of the w<sup>,</sup>ork and the flashes of light&nbsp;which it throws across a momentous but dark epoch of&nbsp;history combine to give it exceptional importance among&nbsp;the relics of late Roman literature. The poem was in two&nbsp;books ; the exordium of the first and the greater part of&nbsp;the second have been lost. AA<sup>r</sup>hat remains consists of about&nbsp;700 lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The poet’s voyage took place in the late autumn of 416 (i. 135 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sq.),</span><span class="font2"> and the verses as we have them were evidently written at or very near the time. The author is&nbsp;a native of southern Gaul, and belonged, like Sidonius,&nbsp;to one of the great governing families of the Gaulish provinces.
