<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and through his friend’s influence received in 1518 an invitation to settle in Zurich as the parish priest of the&nbsp;cathedral in that city. Here he at once began to discard&nbsp;the traditional mode of exposition which limited the&nbsp;preacher to certain prescribed sections of the Bible, and&nbsp;commenced instead a connected series of lectures on the&nbsp;New Testament. In the course of four years he thus&nbsp;completed a course of sermons on the whole of that portion&nbsp;of the Bible. This innovation, peculiar to the Reformed&nbsp;Church, was never adopted by Luther, although followed&nbsp;by most of the theologians of Switzerland and the upper&nbsp;Rhineland. It was in the year 1519 that Zwingli first&nbsp;became acquainted with Luther’s early treatises; but his&nbsp;own views appear to have been formed quite independently&nbsp;of these. Shortly after his arrival in Zurich the Franciscan Bernardin Samson visited the city on a like mission to that of Tetzel and encountered in Zwingli another&nbsp;Luther. The grossness of the system of indulgences was&nbsp;so ably exposed by Zwingli that he carried nearly all who&nbsp;heard him with him, and Samson was obliged to return&nbsp;to Italy before his mission ·was fully accomplished. Even&nbsp;Faber, afterwards the opponent of Zwingli, could not but&nbsp;express to the latter his satisfaction at the result. Gradually the voice of the Reformer was heard uplifted against&nbsp;other mediaeval superstitions and especially against Mari-olatry; his fame as a preacher rapidly spread, and he&nbsp;became known as one of the chief leaders of opinion in&nbsp;Zurich. The state of morality in the city was, however,&nbsp;exceedingly low, and he not only had to encounter considerable opposition but was repeatedly exposed to charges&nbsp;of heresy. Nevertheless the conviction which he produced&nbsp;among the more influential citizens of the truth of the&nbsp;tenets which he advocated was such that in the year 1520&nbsp;an order was issued by the city council to the effect that&nbsp;all ministers should in future ground their discourses on&nbsp;the New Testament, “ and prove their doctrine from the&nbsp;Bible alone, discarding all innovations and human inventions.” While meeting with opposition in one direction,&nbsp;he was compelled himself to oppose the zeal of fanaticism&nbsp;in another. As at Wittenberg, an iconoclastic spirit had&nbsp;begun to manifest itself, and the question of the lawfulness&nbsp;of images in churches was warmly debated. In the months&nbsp;of January and October 1523 two conferences of the clergy&nbsp;and laity assembled in Zurich, in the course of which&nbsp;Zwingli put forth sixty-seven propositions, involving conclusions adverse to the teaching and practice of the mediaeval church. Among those who took part in the discussions were Faber, Meyer of Bern, Hofmeister, and Conrad&nbsp;Schmidt of Kiissnacht, Knight Commander of the Order of&nbsp;St John, a man of eminent character and ability. Schmidt&nbsp;endeavoured, although in a temperate and rational manner,&nbsp;to defend the custom of placing images in the churches,&nbsp;but after a warm discussion Zwingli ultimately decided for&nbsp;their abolition. In the yet more important discussion that&nbsp;followed, with respect to the true nature and significance&nbsp;of the mass, whether it was to be regarded as of the nature&nbsp;of a sacrifice or simply as a commemorative ordinance, he&nbsp;expressed himself in favour of the latter interpretation.&nbsp;The issues raised by the sixty-seven propositions extended&nbsp;considerably in their scope beyond all that Luther had as&nbsp;yet advanced; and, as at Leipsic, it was soon discovered&nbsp;that the two contending parties were divided by an insuperable difference with respect to the authority which they&nbsp;were disposed to accept as final,—the one party grounding&nbsp;their arguments solely on the Scriptures, the other on the&nbsp;councils and the fathers. It may be noted, as an illustration of the extremely low status of the inferior clergy of&nbsp;the country at this period, that, in replying to Zwingli’s&nbsp;demand for an intelligent and systematic study of the&nbsp;Scriptures by all pastors, it was urged as an objection that</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">many pastors might be unable to afford to pui’chase a copy of the Bible for their own use! Another notable theory&nbsp;supported by Zwingli was that known at a later period as&nbsp;Erastianism, according to which the authorities of the church&nbsp;■were to be held to be ultimately amenable to the jurisdiction of the civil power. At his instance the church at&nbsp;Zurich next proceeded to repudiate the control both of the&nbsp;bishop of Constance and of the papal nuncio, constituting&nbsp;itself (1524) a separate ecclesiastical body, the supreme&nbsp;authority over which was vested in the magistrates of the&nbsp;city. In the public services the Latin liturgy and the&nbsp;Gregorian chant were set aside for a German prayer-book&nbsp;and German singing. The rite of baptism was made more&nbsp;simple,—the ceremony of exorcism on which the Lutheran&nbsp;Church continued long after to insist being altogether discarded. In the year 1525 Zwingli published a more systematic exposition of his tenets in his best-known work,&nbsp;his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Commentary on True and, False Religion</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, which he&nbsp;dedicated to Francis I. His conception of the sacraments&nbsp;and of original sin as here unfolded separates him still&nbsp;further from the doctrine of the mediaeval church, while&nbsp;in his remarkable catholicity of belief in regard to salvation he much resembles some of the early Greek fathers.&nbsp;Like Clement and Origen, he believed in the final happiness of the good and wise, including the good and wise of&nbsp;pagan antiquity; nor did he hesitate to express his conviction that Socrates was a better and wiser man than any&nbsp;Dominican or Franciscan of his own day. On the other&nbsp;hand, he upheld the doctrine of predestination in its most&nbsp;rigid form, that afterwards known as “ supralapsarian ”&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Predestination).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In no country was the Reformation so closely associated with political feeling as in Switzerland; and its upholders, ’&nbsp;amid surrounding despotisms, were advocates of republican ■&nbsp;institutions. Zwingli and his followers looked on with&nbsp;shame and sorrow as they saw their countrymen hastening&nbsp;to cross the Alps to become the mercenaries of the pope.&nbsp;With no less sense of humiliation did they regard the&nbsp;venal spirit of their public officials stooping to become the&nbsp;pensioners of the French court. The progress of these&nbsp;new opinions ־was, as is usually the case, much more rapid&nbsp;in the large towns than in the more rural and mountainous regions. At Bern they were ably upheld by&nbsp;Anslielm, the historiographer of the city, and by Sebastian&nbsp;Meyer, and Haller; in the free city of Basel he had for&nbsp;his followers GScolampadius and William Farel; and&nbsp;already in 1527 Conrad Pellicanus, afterwards his zealous&nbsp;follower, had conceived that admiration of his character&nbsp;and tenets which was attended by such important results.&nbsp;Wyttenbach, Zwingli’s former preceptor, sustained his&nbsp;teaching in Biel, Joachim von Watt in St Gall, Biirgli,&nbsp;Blasius, and Dorfmann among the Grisons. In the cantons&nbsp;of Schwyz, Uri, Unterwalden, Lucerne, and Zug, on the&nbsp;other hand, the new doctrines found strenuous opposition;&nbsp;and the simple mountaineers listened with unfeigned&nbsp;sorrow and indignation when they heard that it was proposed to abolish pilgrimages, such as those to the field of&nbsp;Morgarten and the chapel of Tell, and to dispense with&nbsp;those priestly virtues of celibacy and fasting which so&nbsp;greatly enhanced their filial reverence for their village&nbsp;pastor. Another and yet more serious obstacle, which ׳&nbsp;threatened to place the wJiole movement in peril, was that&nbsp;presented by the differences of belief which now began to'&nbsp;rise among the Protestants themselves. Foremost among&nbsp;these points of difference was that respecting the Eucharist,&nbsp;—the theory which Zwingli maintained being assailed with&nbsp;peculiar acrimony and vehemence by Luther. Political&nbsp;feeling added not a little to the animosity of that attack.&nbsp;Difficult as it may seem to associate the efforts of one who&nbsp;did so much for intellectual freedom with tyranny and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
