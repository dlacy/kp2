In this manner the thorax is distended and air is drawn into the lungs. The contraction of the thorax in expiration is brought about by the return of the ribs and diaphragm to their original position of rest.</p><p><hi rend="italic">How the Inspiratory Movements are Produced.—The Rib Movements.—</hi>These are caused by the contraction of muscles which are fixed either to the central axis of the body (including under that term the head and vertebral column) or to some point rendered sufficiently stable for the purpose by the action of other adjuvant muscles. Thus the M. levatores costarum arise from the transverse processes of the 7th cervical and eleven upper dorsal vertebrae, and are attached to the ribs below in series; the M. scaleni spring from the cervical vertebrae, and are attached to the anterior parts of the first and second ribs; the M. stemocleido-mastoidei arise from the side and back of the skull, and are inserted into the upper part of the sternum and the clavicle; the M. pectoralis minor arises from the coracoid process of the scapula, and is inserted into the anterior ends of some of the ribs; the M. serratus posticus superior arises from certain of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae, and is inserted into the posterior part of certain of the ribs; the M. cervicalis ascendens (part of the M. erector spinae) arises from certain of the cervical vertebrae, and is inserted into the posterior part of certain ribs. The M. serratus magnus and the M. pectoralis major, which are affixed on the one hand to the upper arm and to the scapula respectively, and on the other to the ribs and to the sternum respectively, may in certain elevated positions of the arm and shoulder act as inspiratory muscles. When all these muscles contract, the ribs are raised in the twofold way already described, some pulling up the anterior ends of the ribs, and others causing the arched ribs to rotate about an axis passing through their vertebral and sternal joints.</p><p>In addition to the muscles just enumerated, the M. intercostales extemi are undoubtedly inspiratory muscles. Every external intercostal muscular fibre between a pair of ribs must, when it contracts, of necessity raise <hi rend="italic">both</hi>  ribs, as is clearly shown by the accompanying diagram (fig. 10). Here <hi rend="italic">Pb'</hi>  must be shorter than <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi>  for if angle BAa = X, then</p><p><hi rend="italic">alp=</hi>ΑΒ<hi rend="sup">ΐ</hi>+(Βά-Αα)<hi rend="sup">ΐ</hi>+2ΑΒ(Βά-Aa)cos x; hence<hi rend="italic">ab</hi>  will be larger the smaller the angle x, for the cosine increases as the angle diminishes.</p><p>By a similar geometrical treatment of the question it may be shown that the internal intercostal muscles when they contract must of necessity depress both the ribs to which they are attached. If the angle BAc' = x(fig. n), then</p><p>c<hi rend="sup">/</hi>d'<hi rend="sup">î</hi>=AB<hi rend="sup">t</hi>+(Ac<hi rend="sup">/</hi>—Bd<hi rend="sup">/</hi>)<hi rend="sup">t</hi>—2AB(Ac<hi rend="sup">z</hi>-Bd<hi rend="sup">z</hi>) cos x; hence<hi rend="italic">C<hi rend="sup">f</hi>P</hi>  will be larger the larger the angle x.</p><p>The case, however, is not so clear with reference to the anterior portions of the internal intercostals which be between the cartilages; for it is evident that these fibres have the same direction with regard to the sternum as an axis as the external intercostals have with regard to the vertebral column as an axis; that is to say, the geometrical diagram in fig. 10 applies to the inter-cartilaginous internal intercostals as perfectly as it does to the inter-osseous parts of the external intercostals, the inference being that the inter-cartilaginous internal intercostals tend to elevate the pair of ribs between which they stretch. The geometrical argument is, however, overborne by physiological experiment: Martin and Hartwell have observed in the dog and the cat that the internal intercostals throughout their whole extent contract (not synchronously) but alternately with the diaphragm; hence we must conclude that their function throughout is not inspiratory like that of the diaphragm, but expiratory.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The Movements of lhe Diaphragm.</hi>—The muscular fibres of the diaphragm are arranged in a radial manner, or, more strictly speaking, in a manner like the fines of longitude on a terrestrial globe. The central tendon of the diaphragm corresponds to the pole of such a globe. The contraction of the fibres is expended on straightening the longitudinal curves rather than on pulling down the central tendon to a lower level; in fact, the central tendon moves very little in ordinary respiration.</p><p><hi rend="italic">How the Expiratory Movements are Produced.—</hi>The action of inspiration disturbs many organs from the position of rest into which gravity and their own physical properties have thrown them. The ribs and sternum are raised from the position of lowest level; the elastic costal cartilages are twisted; the elastic lungs are put upon the stretch; the abdominal organs, themselves elastic, are compressed and thrust against the elastic walls of the belly, causing these to bulge outwards. In short the very act of inspiration stores up, as it were, in sundry ways the forces which make for expiration. As soon as the inspiratory muscles cease to act these Jorces come into play, and the position of rest or equilibrium is regained. It is very doubtful whether any special expiratory muscles are called into action during ordinary respiration. The internal intercostals may in man be exercised in ordinary expiration (although they are certainly not so exercised in the dog and the cat); but in laboured expiration many muscles assist in the expulsive effort. The muscles forming the belly-walls contract and force the abdominal contents against the relaxed diaphragm in such a manner as to drive it farther and farther into the thorax.
