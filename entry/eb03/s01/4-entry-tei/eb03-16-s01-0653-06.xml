or rather <hi rend="smallcaps">Santeul</hi> (John Baptiſt de), in Latin <hi rend="italic">Santolius Victorinus,</hi> an excellent Latin poet, was born at Paris in 1630. Having finiſhed his ſtudies in Louis the Great’s college, he applied himſelf entirely to poetry, and celebrated in his verſe the praiſes of ſeveral great men; by which he acquired univerſal applauſe. He enriched Paris with a great number of inſcriptions, which are to be ſeen on the public fountains, and the monuments conſecrated to poſterity. At length, ſome new hymns being to be compoſed for the Breviary of Paris, Claude Santeuil his brother, and M. Boſſuet, perſuaded him to undertake that work; and he ſucceeded in it with the greateſt applauſe. On which the order of Clugny defining him to compoſe ſome for their Breviary, he complied with their requeſt; and that order, out of gratitude, granted him letters of filiation, with an annual penſion. Santeuil was careſſed by all the learned men of his time; and had for his admirers the two princes of Condé, the father and ſon, from whom he frequently recieved favours. Louis XIV. alſo gave him a proof of his eſteem, by beſtowing a penſion upon him. He attended the duke of Bourbon to Dijon, when that prince went thither in order to hold the ſtates of Burgundy; and died therein 1697, as he was preparing to return to Paris. Beſides his Latin hymns, he wrote a great number of Latin poems, which have all the fire and marks of genius diſcoverable in the works of great poets.</p><p>To Santeuil we are indebted for many fine church- hymns, as above-mentioned. Santeuil read the verſes he made for the inhabitants of heaven with all the agitations of a demoniac. Deſpreaux ſaid he was the<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0660.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0654"/>
devil whom God compelled to praiſe faints. He was among the number of poets whoſe genius was as impetuous as his muſe was decent.</p><p>La Bruyere has painted the character of this Angular and truly original poet in the moſt lively colours.</p><p>Image a man of great facility of temper, complaiſant and docile, in an inſtant violent, choleric, paſſionate, and capricious. A man Ample, credulous, playful, volatile, puerile; in a word, a child in gray hairs: but let him collect himſelf, or rather call forth his interior genius, I venture to ſay, without his knowledge or privacy, what ſallies! what elevation! what images! what latinity! Do you ſpeak of one and the ſame perſon, you will aſk? Yes, of the ſame; of Theodas, and of him alone. He ſhrieks, he jumps, he rolls upon the ground, he roars, he ſtorms; and in the midſt of this tempeſt, a flame iſſues that ſhines, that rejoices. Without a figure, he rattles like a fool, and thinks like a wiſe man. He utters truths in a ridiculous way; and, in an idiotic manner, rational and ſenſible things. It is aſtoniſhing to find good ſenſe diſcloſe itſelf from the boſom of buffoonery, accompanied with grimaces and contortions. What ſhall I ſay more? He does and he ſays better than he knows. Theſe are like two fouls that are unacquainted with each other, which have each their turn and ſeparate functions. A feature would be wanting in this extraordinary portrait, if I omitted ſaying, that he has at once an inſatiable thirſt for praiſe, ready to throw himſelf at the mercy of the critics, and at the bottom ſo docile as to profit by their cenſure. I begin to perſuade myſelf that I have been drawing the portraits of two different perſons: it would not be impoſſible to find a third in Theodas; for he is a good man, a pleaſant man, an excellent man. ”</p><p>This poet ought not to be confounded with <hi rend="italic">Claude de Santeuil,</hi> his brother, a learned eccleſiaſtic, who alſo wrote ſeveral hymns in the Paris Breviary under the name of <hi rend="italic">Santolius Maglioranus,</hi> a name given him from his having lived a long time in the ſeminary of St Magliore at Paris, in quality of ſecular eccleſiaſtic. He was eſteemed not only for his poetical abilities, but alſo for his profound erudition and his exemplary piety. He died at Paris in 1684, aged 57. He wrote ſeveral other pieces of poetry, beſides his hymns, which are printed with his brother’s works.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
