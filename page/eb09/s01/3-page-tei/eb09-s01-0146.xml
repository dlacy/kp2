            <p>SANGALLO, the surname of a Florentine family, several members of which became
                distinguished in the fine arts.</p>
            <p> I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Giuliano di Sangallo</hi> (1443-1517) was a distinguished
                Florentine architect, sculptor, tarsiatore, and military engineer. His father,
                Francesco di Paolo Giamberti, was also an able architect, much employed by Cosimo
                de’ Medici. During the early part of his life Giuliano worked chiefly for Lorenzo
                the Magnificent, for whom he built a fine palace at Poggio-a-Cajano, between
                Florence and Pistoia, and strengthened the fortifications of Florence, Castellana,
                and other places. Lorenzo also employed him to build a monastery of Austin Friars
                outside the Florentine gate of San Gallo, a nobly designed structure, which was
                destroyed during the siege of Florence in 1530. It was from this building that
                Giuliano received the name of Sangallo, which was afterwards used by so many Italian
                architects. While still in the pay of Lorenzo, Giuliano visited Naples, and worked
                there for the king, who highly appreciated his services and sent him back to
                Florence with many handsome presents of money, plate, and antique sculpture, the
                last of which Giuliano presented to his patron Lorenzo, who was an enthusiastic
                collector of works of classic art. After Lorenzo’s death in 1492, Giuliano visited
                Loreto, and with great constructive skill built the dome of the church of the
                Madonna, in spite of serious difficulties arising from its defective piers, which
                were already built. In order to gain strength by means of a strong cement, Giuliano
                built his dome with pozzolana brought from Rome. Soon after this, at the invitation
                of Pope Alexander VI., Giuliano went to Rome, and designed the fine panelled ceiling
                of S. Maria Maggiore. He was also largely employed by Julius II., both for
                fortification walls round the castle of S. Angelo, and also to build a palace
                adjoining the church of S. Pietro in Vincoli, of which Julius had been titular
                cardinal. Giuliano was much disappointed that Bramante was preferred to himself as
                architect for the new basilica of St Peter, and this led to his returning to
                Florence, where he was warmly received by the gonfaloniere Pier Soderini, and did
                much service to his native state by his able help as a military engineer and builder
                of fortresses during the war between Florence and Pisa. Soon after this Giuliano was
                recalled to Rome by Julius II., who had much need for his military talents both in
                Rome itself and also during his attack upon Bologna. For about eighteen months in
                1514-1515 Giuliano acted as joint-architect to St Peter’s together with Raphael, but
                owing to age and ill-health he resigned this office about two years before his death
                in 1517. But little remains to enable one to judge of Giuliano’s talents in the
                artistic side of his profession; the greater part of his life was spent on military
                works, in which he evidently showed great skill and practical knowledge of
                construction.</p>
            <p> II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Antonio di Sangallo</hi> (1448?-1534) was the younger
                brother of Giuliano, and took from him the name of Sangallo. To a great extent he
                worked in partnership with his brother, but he also executed a number of independent
                works. As a military engineer he was as skilful as Giuliano, and carried out
                important works of walling and building fortresses at Arezzo, Montefiascone,
                Florence, and Rome. His finest existing work as an architect is the church of S.
                Biagio at Montepulciano, in plan a Greek cross with central dome and two towers,
                much resembling, on a small scale, Bramante’s design for St Peter’s. He also built a
                palace in the same city, various churches and palaces at Monte Sansavino, and at
                Florence a range of monastic buildings for the Servite monks. Antonio retired early
                from the practice of his profession, and spent his latter years in farming.</p>
            <p> III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Francesco di Sangallo</hi> (1493-1570), the son of
                Giuliano di Sangallo, was a pupil of Andrea Sansovino, and worked chiefly as a
                sculptor. His works have for the most part but little merit,—the finest being his
                noble effigy of Bishop Leonardo Bonafede, which lies on the pavement of the church
                of the Certosa, near Florence. It is simply treated, with many traces of the better
                taste of the 15th century. His other chief existing work is the group of the Virgin
                and Child and St Anne, executed in 1526 for the altar of Or San Michele, where it
                still stands.</p>
            <p> IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Bastiano di Sangallo</hi> (1481—1551), Florentine sculptor
                and painter, was a nephew of Giuliano and Antonio. He is usually known as
                Aristotile, a nickname he received from his air of sententious gravity. He was at
                first a pupil of Perugino, but afterwards became a follower of Michelangelo. His
                life is given at great length by Vasari, in spite of his being an artist of very
                mediocre powers.</p>
            <p> V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Antonio di Sangallo,</hi> the younger (?—1546), another
                nephew of Giuliano, went while very young to Rome, and became a pupil of Bramante,
                of whose style he was afterwards a close follower. He lived and worked in Rome
                during the greater part of his life, and was much employed by several of the popes.
                His most perfect existing work is the brick and travertine church of S. Maria di
                Loreto, close by Trajan’s column, a building remarkable for the great beauty of its
                proportions, and its noble effect produced with much simplicity. The lower order is
                square in plan, the next octagonal ; and the whole is surmounted by a fine dome and
                lofty lantern. The lantern is, however, a later addition. The interior is very
                impressive, considering its very moderate size. Antonio also carried out the lofty
                and well-designed church of S. Giovanni dei Fiorentini, which had been begun by
                Jacobo Sansovino. The east end of this church rises in a very stately way out of the
                bed of the Tiber, near the bridge of S. Angelo ; the west end has been ruined by the
                addition of a later façade, but the interior is a noble example of a somewhat dull
                style. Great skill has been shown in successfully building this large church, partly
                on the solid ground of the bank and partly on the shifting sand of the river bed.
                Antonio also built the Cappella Paolina and other parts of the Vatican, together
                with additions to the walls and forts of the Leonine City. His most ornate work is
                the lower part of the cortile of the Farnese palace, afterwards completed by
                Michelangelo, a very rich and well-proportioned specimen of the then favourite
                design, a series of arches between engaged columns supporting an entablature, an
                arrangement taken from the outside of the Colosseum. A palace in the Via Giulia
                built for himself still exists under the name of the Palazzo Sacchetti, but is much
                injured by alterations. Antonio also constructed the very deep and ingenious
                rock-cut well at Orvieto, formed with a double spiral staircase, like the well of
                Saladin in the citadel of Cairo.</p>

            <p>SANGERHAUSEN, an ancient town of Prussian Saxony, is situated on the Gonna, near the
                south base of the Harz Mountains, and 30 miles to the west of Halle. In 1880 it
                contained 9136 inhabitants, chiefly occupied in the manufacture of beetroot sugar,
                machinery, buttons, &amp;c., in agriculture, and in the coal and copper mines of the
                neighbourhood. Sangerhausen is one of the oldest towns in Thuringia, being mentioned
                in a document of the 10th century. The Romanesque church of St Ulrich is said to
                have been founded by Louis the “Springer,’ margrave of Thuringia, in 1079.</p>
