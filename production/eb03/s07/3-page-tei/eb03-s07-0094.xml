And what are we to think of the ſenſibility of a man who, ſtrongly attached as he ſeems to have been to both, could, without speaking, fling a paper on the table of the one, which “ proved (as our author expreſſes it) her death-warrant,” and could throw the other, his beloved Stella, in her laſt illneſs, into unſpeakable agonies, and “ never ſee her more, for only adjuring him, by their friendſhip, to let her have the ſatisfaction of dying at leaſt, though ſhe had not lived, his acknowledged wife?” Another apologiſt inſinuates, upon ſomething like evidence, that Stella bore a ſon to Swift, and yet labours to excuſe him for not declaring her his wife, becauſe she had agreed at the marriage that it ſhould remain a ſecret from all the world unless the diſcovery ſhould be called for by <hi rend="italic">urgent necesſity</hi> ; but what could be meant by the term <hi rend="italic">urgent neceſſity, </hi>unleſs it alluded to the birth of children, he confesses that it would be hard to ſay. The truth we believe to be what has been ſaid by Johnſon, that the man whom Stella had the misfortune to love was fond of singularity, and desirous to make a mode of happineſs for himſelf, different from the general courſe of things and the order of Providence ; he wiſhed ſor all the pleaſures of perfect friendſhip, without the uneaſineſs of conjugal reſtraint. But with this ſtate poor Stella was not satisfied ; ſhe never was treated as a wife, and to the world ſhe had the appearance of a miſtreſs. She lived ſullenly on, hoping that in time he would own and receive her. This, we believe, he offered at laſt to do, but not till the change of his manners and the depravation of his mind made her tell him, that “ it was too late.”</p><p>The natural acrimony of Swift’s temper had been increaſed by repeated diſappointments. This gave a ſplenetic tincture to his writings, and amidſt the duties of private and domeſtic life it too frequently appeared to ſhade the luſtre of his more eminent virtues. — The dean hath been accuſed of avarice, but with the ſame truth as he hath been accuſed of infidelity. In detached views, no man was more liable to be miſtaken. Even his genius and good ſenſe might be queſtioned, if we were only to read ſome paſſages of his writings. To judge fairly and pronounce juſtly of him as a man and as an author, we ſhould examine the uniform tenor of his diſpoſition and conduct, and the general nature and deſign of his productions. In the latter he will appear great, and in the former good ; notwithſtanding the puns and puerilities of the one, and the abſurdities and inconſiſtencies of the other.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Swift,</hi> in ornithology.

Nevertheleſs there are. no accounts of its origin to be found in the hiſtory of any nation ; nor are there any nations ſo barbarous but that the art of ſwimming is known among them, and that in greater perfection than among civilized people. It is probable, therefore, that the art, though not abſolutely natural, will always be acquired by people in a ſavage ſtate from imitating the brute animals, moſt of whom ſwim naturally. indeed ſo much does this appear to be the caſe, that very expert ſwimmers have recommended it to thoſe who wiſhed to learn the art, to keep ſome frogs in a tub of water conſtantly beſide them, and to imitate the motions by which they move thro’ that element.</p><p>The theory of ſwimming depends upon one very ſimple principle ; namely, that if a force is applied to any body, it will always move towards that side where there is the leaſt reſiſtance. Thus, if a perſon ſtanding in a boat puſhes with a pole againſt the side or any other part of the vessel in which he ſtands, no motion will enſue; for as much as he presses in one direction with the pole, juſt ſo much does the action of his feet, on which the pressure of the pole muſt ultimately reſt, puſh the vessel the other way : but if, inſtead of the side of the vessel, he puſhes the pole againſt the shore, then only one force acts upon it, namely, that or the feet ; which being resisted only by the fluid water, the boat begins to move from the ſhore. Now the very ſame thing takes place in ſwimming, whether the animal be man, quadruped, bird, or fiſh. If we conſider the matter ſimply, we may ſuppoſe an animal in ſuch a ſituation that it could not poſſibly ſwim : thus, if we cut off the fins and tail of a fiſh, it will indeed float in conſequence of being ſpecifically lighter than the water, but cannot make any progreſſive motion, or at leaſt but very little, in conſequence of wriggling its body; but if we allow it to keep any of its ſins, by ſtriking them againſt the water in any direction, the body moves the contrary way, juſt as a boat moves the contrary way to that in which the oars ſtrike the water. It is true, that as the boat is but partly immerged in the water, the reſiſtance is comparatively leſs than when a frog or even any other quadruped ſwims ; but a boat could certainly be rowed with oars tho’ it was totally immerged in water, only with lels velocity than when it is not. When a man ſwims, he in like manner ſtrikes the water with his hands, arms, and feet ; in conſequence of which the body moves in a direction contrary to the ſtroke. Upon this principle, and on this only, a man may either aſcend, deſcend, or move obliquely, in any poſſible direction in the water. One would think, indeed, that as the ſtrength of a man’s arms and legs is but ſmall, he could make but very little way by any ſtroke he could give the water, conſidering the fluidity of that element. Nevertheleſs it is incredible what expert ſwimmers will perform in this way ; of which Mr Forſter gives a moſt remarkable inſtance in the inhabitants of Otaheite ; whoſe agility, he tells us, was ſuch, that when a nail was thrown overboard, they would jump after it into the ſea, and never fail to catch it before it came to the bottom.</p><p>As to the practice of ſwimming, there are but few directions which can be given. The great obſtacle is the natural dread which people have of being drowned ; and this if is impoſſible to overcome by any thing but accuſtoming ourſelves to go into the vzater. With regard to the real danger of being drowned, it is but little ; and on innumerable occaſions ariſes entirely from the terror above mentioned, as will appear from the following obſervations by Doctor. Franklin.</p><p>“ 1ſt, That though the legs, arms, and head, of a human body, being solid parts, are ſpecifically ſomewhat heavier than fresh water, yet the trunk, particularly the upper part, from its hollowneſs, is ſo much lighter than water, as that the whole of the body, taken together, is too light to sink wholly under water, but ſome part will remain above until the lungs become filled with water; which happens from drawing water into them inſtead of air, when a perſon in the fright attempts breathing while the mouth and noſtrils are under water.</p><p>“ 2dly, That the legs and arms are ſpecifically lighter than salt water, and will ſhe ſupported by it ; ſo that a human body would not sink in salt water though the lungs were filled as above, but from the greater ſpecific gravity of the head.</p><p>“ 3dly, That therefore a perſon throwing himſelf on his back in salt water, and extending his arms, may eaſily lie</p></body></text></TEI>
