<p><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis actiones.</span><span class="font0"> The one regulating procedure in private suits at Rome must have been a somewhat comprehensive statute, as a&nbsp;passage in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vatican .Fragments</span><span class="font0"> refers to a provision of its 27th&nbsp;section; and our ignorance of its contents therefore, beyond one or&nbsp;two trifling details, is the more to be regretted. The opinion of&nbsp;Wlassak, already referred to, is that the judiciary laws made&nbsp;procedure by formulae compulsory, while the Aebutian law had left&nbsp;it optional. In all cases remitted to a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">unus judex qt</span><span class="font0"> other private&nbsp;judges a formula was to be henceforth compulsory; a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">could no longer be tried before private judges but only exceptionally&nbsp;by the centum viral court.<sup>@@1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the time of Tiberius onwards it was the senate that did the work of legislation, for the simple reason that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comitia&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">were no longer fit for it. And very active it seems to have&nbsp;been. This may have been due to some extent to the fact&nbsp;that so many professional jurists, aware from their practice&nbsp;of the points in which the law required amendment, possessed seats in the imperial council, where the drafts of the scnatus-consults were prepared. It was the senatusconsults that were the&nbsp;principal statutory factors of what IVas called by both emperors and&nbsp;jurists thejtts </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">novum-</span><span class="font0"> -law that departed often very widely from the&nbsp;principles of the old </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font0">, that was much more in accordance&nbsp;with tnose of the Edict, and that to a great extent might have been&nbsp;introduced through its means had not the authority of the praetors&nbsp;been overshadowed by that of the prince. In the end of the 2nd&nbsp;and the beginning of the 3rd century the supremacy of the latter&nbsp;in the.senate became rather too pronounced, men quoting the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">or all o&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in which he had submitted to it a project of law instead of the&nbsp;resolution which gave it legislative effect. No doubt such, project&nbsp;must have been carefully considered beforehand in the imperial&nbsp;council, and rarely stood in need of further discussion; but the&nbsp;ignoring of the formal act that followed it tended unduly to emphasize, the share borne in it by the sovereign, and made it all&nbsp;the easier for the emperors after Severus Alexander to dispense</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">altogether with the time-honoured practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Consolidated Edictum Perpetuum.—</span><span class="font0">The edicts of the praetors, which had attained very considerable proportions before the fall&nbsp;of the Republic, certainly received some additions in the&nbsp;early Empire. But those magistrates did not long enjoy&nbsp;the same independence as of old; there was a greater&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font0"> than theirs in the state, before which they hesitated to&nbsp;lay hands on the law with the boldness of their predecessors. They&nbsp;continued as before to publish annually at entry on office the edicts&nbsp;that had been handed down to them through generations; but their&nbsp;own additions were soon almost limited to mere amendments&nbsp;rendered necessary by the provisions of some senatusconsult that&nbsp;affected the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus honorarium.</span><span class="font0"> They ceased to be that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">viva vox juris&nbsp;civilis</span><span class="font0"> which they had been in the time of Cicero; the emperor, if&nbsp;any one, was now entitled to the epithet; the annual edict had lost&nbsp;its </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raison d'etre.</span><span class="font0"> Hadrian apparently .was of opinion. that the&nbsp;time had come for writing its “ explicit,” and giving it another&nbsp;and more enduring and authoritative shape, binding on all future&nbsp;magistrates. He accordingly, it is said, commissioned Salvius&nbsp;Julianus to revise it—or Julian, when urban praetor, may have done&nbsp;so at his own hand with the emperor’s approval—and the senate&nbsp;gave it binding force. It did not, however, become statute law ;&nbsp;the distinction between </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus praetorium</span><span class="font0"> still continued.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The revised Edict unfortunately, like the XII. Tables, is no longer extant. It is only a very slight account we have of the&nbsp;revision—a line or two in Eutropius and Aurelius Victor, and a few&nbsp;lines in two of Justinian’s prefaces to the Digest. We may assume&nbsp;from what is said there that both abridgment and rearrangement, of&nbsp;the edicts of the urban praetor took place, but the question remains&nbsp;how far Julian consolidated with them those of the peregrin praetor&nbsp;and other officials who had contributed to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus honorarium.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Those of the curule aediles, we are told, were included; Justinian&nbsp;says that they formed the last part of Julian’s work; they formed,&nbsp;in fact, a sort of addendum to it. There is reason to believe that so&nbsp;much of the edicts of the provincial governors as differed from those&nbsp;of the praetors were also incorporated in it,.and that the edicts&nbsp;of the peregrin praetors, in so far as they contained available matter&nbsp;not embodied in those of their urban colleagues or the provincial&nbsp;governors, were dealt with in the same way.<sup>@@2</sup> The consolidation&nbsp;got the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Edictum Perpetuum</span><span class="font0"> in a sense somewhat different&nbsp;from that formerly imputed to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">edicta perpetua</span><span class="font0"> as distinguished from&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">edicta repentina;</span><span class="font0"> it became perpetual in the English sense of&nbsp;the word. Sanctioned by senatusconsult and by the emperor, it&nbsp;became a closed chapter so far as the praetors were concerned; for,.&nbsp;though it continued for a time to hold its place on their album with&nbsp;its formularies of actions, they had no longer any power to alter</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">or even perhaps make additions to it. Having ceased to be a mere efflux of their </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font0"> and become a type prescribed by statute,&nbsp;its interpretation and amendment w'ere no longer in their hands but&nbsp;in the hands of the emperor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Julian Edict w'as not divided into parts or books like Justinian’s Digest but only into titles, which w'ere perhaps numbered&nbsp;and certainly were rubricated. Since the publication of Lenel’s&nbsp;great work, noted below, modern Romanists are agreed that the&nbsp;formularies of actions it contained were distributed in their appropriate places throughout the work and not collected together in one&nbsp;place as used to be supposed. Thus a formula based on the civil&nbsp;law </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rei vindicate)</span><span class="font0"> appeared by itself </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font0"> without any edict)&nbsp;as a separate head or subdivision of the title appropriate to it;&nbsp;while formulae based on the praetor’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperium (e.g.</span><span class="font0"> that of the&nbsp;praetorian action </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de dolo)</span><span class="font0"> were placed under their respective edicts.&nbsp;The general arrangement of the subject-matter is not. difficult to&nbsp;discover, as we have documentary evidence to a certain extent in&nbsp;writings which have come down to us. These are principally&nbsp;(1) the Digest .of Justinian, in the prefaces to w'hich we are told&nbsp;expressly that it followed the order of the Edict except in certain&nbsp;places specially noticed; (2) the Code of Justinian; (3) the extracts&nbsp;from, divers commentaries on the Edict by the classical jurists&nbsp;principally preserved in the Digest. As the inscriptions of these&nbsp;extracts contain tht name of the author, the work and the {»articular book from which they are taken, they have proved of great&nbsp;help towards understanding the arrangement—especially the commentaries of Ulpian and Paul on the urban edict and the commentary of Gaius on the provincial edict. Lenel has showm that&nbsp;Julian’s plan, of arrangement was neither logical nor symmetrical,&nbsp;but adhered in great measure to the old order (tralatitious) of the&nbsp;urban praetors. The following fourfold division of the subject-matter.is, according to Lenel (partially following Rudorff), clearly&nbsp;ascertainable: first, a series of titles.dealing with the preliminary&nbsp;steps in all actions such as jurisdiction, summons, intervention of&nbsp;procurators and the like; second, titles dealing mainly with matters&nbsp;of ordinary procedure or rather with actions granted principally&nbsp;in accordance with statute </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(judicia légitima)</span><span class="font0"> as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">petitio hereditatis, rei&nbsp;vindicatio,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. ; third, titles dealing with actions resting principally&nbsp;on the. magistrate’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperium (judicia imperio continentia)</span><span class="font0"> ; fourth,&nbsp;execution of judgments, including bankruptcy., &amp;c. These four&nbsp;parts were followed by a kind of appendix containing in three titles&nbsp;the separate styles of interdicts, exceptions and praetorian stipulations. Finally, the edicts of the curule aediles, with their formulae&nbsp;also consolidated, were added at the end of the work. From the&nbsp;fragments of the jurists preserved by Justinian (principally from&nbsp;the three above-mentioned commentaries, but also to an important&nbsp;extent from. Julian himself in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Digesta)</span><span class="font0"> repeated attempts have&nbsp;been made in modern times to reproduce the Edict in its entirety.&nbsp;Most of these are mere transcripts with attempted reconstructions&nbsp;of passages in Justinian’s Digest and of little value. The only&nbsp;really scientific and worthy critical efforts are those of Rudorff in&nbsp;1869 and, above all, of Lenel in 1883.<sup>@@3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Responses of Patented Counsel.</span><span class="font0">—The right of responding under imperial authority </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(jus respondendi ex auctoritate principis),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">first granted by Augustus and continued by his successors&nbsp;down to about the time of Severus Alexander, did not&nbsp;imply any curtailment of the right of unlicensed jurists&nbsp;to give advice to any one who chose.to consult them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">YVhat it did was to give an authoritative character to a response, so that the judge who had asked for it and to&nbsp;whom it was presented—Tor the judges were but private&nbsp;citizens, most of them unlearned in the law—was practically&nbsp;bound to adopt it as if it had emanated from the emperor&nbsp;himself. It may hie that Augustus was actuated by a political&nbsp;motive—that he was desirous by this concession to attach lawyers&nbsp;of eminence to the new<sup>7</sup> regime, and prevent the recurrence of the&nbsp;evils experienced during the Republic from the too great influence of&nbsp;patrons. But, whatever may have prompted his action in the&nbsp;matter, its beneficial consequences for the law.can hardly be overrated. For the powers with which they were invested enabled the&nbsp;patented counsel to influence current doctrine not speculatively&nbsp;merely but positively </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(jura condere),</span><span class="font0"> and so to leaven their interpretations of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus honorarium</span><span class="font0"> with the principles&nbsp;of natural law as to give a new complexion to the system.</span></p>
