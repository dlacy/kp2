If S be the section, and B the border, -g- is</p><p>evidently a line equal to the height of this rectangle. Every section being in this manner reduced to a rectangle, the perpendicular height of it may be called the hydraulic mean depth of the section, and may be expressed by the symbol <hi rend="italic">d.</hi>  Buat calls it the mean radius. If the channel be a cylindrical pipe, or an open half cylinder, it is evident that <hi rend="italic">d</hi>  is half the radius.

For it may be naturally, and it is generally, supposed, that the resistance will be greater when the pressure is greater. The friction, or resistance analogous to friction, may therefore be greater on an inch of the bottom than on an inch of the sides ; but M. d’Alembert and many others have demonstrated, that the paths of the filaments will be the same whatever be the pressures. This might serve to justify our ingenious author ; but he was determined to rest every thing on experiment. He therefore made an experiment on the oscillation of water in syphons, which we have repeated in the following form, which is affected by the same circumstances, and is susceptible of much greater precision, and of more extensive and important application.</p><p>The two vessels ABCD, <hi rend="italic">abed</hi>  were connected by the syphon EFG<hi rend="italic">gfe</hi>, which turned round in the short tubes E and <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>  without allowing any water to escape ; the axis of these tubes being in one straight line. The vessels were about ten inches deep, and the branches FG,</p><p>/7 of the syphon were about five feet long. The vessels were set on two tables of equal height, and (the hole e being stopped) the vessel ABCD, and the whole syphon, were filled with water, and water was poured into the vessel <hi rend="italic">abed</hi>  till it stood at a certain height LM. The syphon was then turned into a horizontal position, and the plug drawn out of <hi rend="italic">e</hi>, and the time carefully noted which the water employed in rising to the level HK <hi rend="italic">kh</hi>  in both vessels. The whole apparatus was now inclined so that the water ran back into ABCD. The syphon was now put in a vertical position, and the experiment was repeated. No sensible or regular difference was observed in the time. Yet in this experiment the pressure on the part <hi rend="italic">Gg</hi>  of the syphon was more than six times greater than before. As it was thought that the friction on this small part (only six inches) was too small a portion of the whole obstruction, various additional obstructions were put into this part of the syphon, and it was even lengthened to nine feet ; but still no remarkable difference was observed. It was even thought that the times were less when the syphon was vertical.</p><p>Thus Du Buat’s opinion is completely justified ; and he may be allowed to assert, that the resistance depends chiefly on the relation between the section and its border ;</p><p>and that "fr  should be a constant quantity.</p><p>∙y∕ ll</p><p>To ascertain this point was the object of the next series of experiments ; to see whether this quantity was really constant, and, if not, to discover the law of its variation, and the physical circumstances which accompanied the variations, and may therefore be considered as their causes A careful comparison of a very great number of experiments, made with the same slope, and with very different channels and velocities, showed that √<hi rend="italic">mg</hi>  did not follow the proportion of √<hi rend="italic">d,</hi>  nor of any power of <hi rend="italic">Vd.</hi>  This quantity <hi rend="italic">V mg</hi>  increased by smaller degrees in proportion as <hi rend="italic">Vd</hi>  was greater. In very great beds V<hi rend="sup">,</hi><hi rend="italic">mg</hi>  was nearly proportional to √&lt;Z,∙ but in smaller channels, the velocities diminished much more than √<hi rend="italic">d</hi>  did. Casting about for some way of accommodation, Du Buat considered, that some approximation at least would be hail by taking off from <hi rend="italic">√d</hi>  some constant small quantity. This is evident : for such a diminution will have but a trifling effect when <hi rend="italic">^Zd </hi>is great, and its effect will increase rapidly when √&lt;Z is very small. He therefore tried various values for this subtraction, and compared the results with the former experiments ; and he found, that if in every case √<hi rend="italic">d</hi>  be diminished by one tenth of an inch, the calculated discharges would agree very exactly with the experiment. Therefore, instead of √&lt;Z, he makes use of √rf—0∙1, and finds this quantity always proportional to √<hi rend="italic">mg,</hi>  or finds that    - <hi rend="sup">18 a</hi></p><p>constant quantity, or very nearly so. It varied from 297 to 287 in all sections, from that of a very small pipe to that of a little canal. In the large sections of canals and rivers it diminished still more, but never was less than 256.</p><p>This result is very agreeable to the most distinct notions that we can form of the mutual actions of the water and its bed. We see that when the motion of water is obstructed by a solid body, which deflects the passing filaments, the disturbance does not extend to any considerable distance on the two sides of the body. In like manner, the small disturbances, and imperceptible curvilineal motions, which are occasioned by the infinitesimal inequalities of the channel, must extend to a very small distance indeed from the sides and bottom of the channel. We know, too, that the mutual adhesion or attraction of water for the solid bodies which are moistened by it extends to a very small distance, which is probably the same, or nearly so, in all cases. Du Buat observed, that a surface of twenty-three square inches, applied to the surface of stagnant water, lifted 1601 grains; another of 5½ square inches lifted 365 ; this was at the rate of sixty-five grains per inch nearly, making a column of about one sixth of an inch high. Now this effect is very much analogous to a rcal contraction of the capacity of the channel. The water may be conceived as nearly stagnant to this small distance from the border of the section. Or, to speak more accurately, the diminution of the progressive velocity occasioned by the friction and adhesion of the sides decreases very rapidly as we recede from the sides, and ceases to be sensible at a very small distance.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
