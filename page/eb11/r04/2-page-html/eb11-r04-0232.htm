<p><span class="font1">took part in the pursuit of the French. Ross received, besides the Peninsular and Waterloo medals, the K.C.B., the Portuguese&nbsp;order of the Tower and Sword and the Russian St Anne. He&nbsp;had commanded the troop for nineteen years when he at last&nbsp;received a regimental lieutenant-colonelcy. As officer commanding Royal Artillery in the Northern District, with delegated command over all the forces of the four northern counties,&nbsp;Sir Hew Ross had for nearly sixteen years to deal with continually threatened civil disorder, and bore himself as well as&nbsp;on the field of battle. From 1840 to 1858, when he retired,&nbsp;he practically directed, in one post or another, all the artillery&nbsp;services of the British army, and when in 1854 the test of war&nbsp;came, the artillery took the field in a far better condition than the&nbsp;rest of Lord Raglan’s army. Much of the present efficiency of&nbsp;the “ Royal Regiment ” is directly traceable to the influence&nbsp;of Sir Hew Ross, to whom it owes the institution of the School&nbsp;of Gunnery at Shoeburyness and the establishment of the&nbsp;Royal Artillery Institution at Woolwich. Major-general in&nbsp;1841 and lieut.-general in 1851, he became general in 1854,&nbsp;and died, a field-marshal and G.C.B., in 1868.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROSS, SIR JAMES CLARK (1800-1862), British rear-admiral and Polar explorer, was horn in London on the 15th of April 1800.&nbsp;He entered the navy in 1812 under his uncle, Captain (afterwards&nbsp;Sir) John Ross, whom he accompanied on his first Arctic voyage&nbsp;in search of a North-West passage (1818). Between 1819 and 1827&nbsp;he returned four times to the same seas in the Arctic expeditions&nbsp;under Parry, and in 1829-33 again served on the same mission&nbsp;under his uncle, and while thus employed determined (1831) the&nbsp;position of the North Magnetic Pole. In 1834 he was promoted captain, and from 1835-38 was employed on the magnetic survey of Great Britain. In 1839-43 he commanded the&nbsp;Antarctic expedition of the “ Erebus ” and “ Terror ” (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Polar Regions),</span><span class="font1"> and for this service he received a knighthood (1844) and was nominated to the French order of the&nbsp;Legion of Honour. He published a narrative of this expedition&nbsp;under the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Voyage of Discovery and Research to Southern&nbsp;and Antarctic Regions</span><span class="font1"> (1847), and was the author also of various&nbsp;reports on zoological and other matters relating to his earlier&nbsp;voyages. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1848, and&nbsp;in that year made his last expedition, as captain of the “ Enterprise,” in the first Franklin search expedition. He died at&nbsp;Ayleshury on the 3rd of April 1862.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSS, JOHN, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Kooeskoowe</span><span class="font1"> (1790-1866), chief of the Cherokee Indian Nation, was of Scotch-Indian descent, and&nbsp;was born among the Cherokees in Georgia in 1790. In 1819-1827 he was president of the Cherokee national committee, in&nbsp;July 1827 he presided over the Cherokee constituent assembly,&nbsp;and under the constitution which it drafted he was principal&nbsp;chief from 1828 until his death. In 1830-31 he applied to&nbsp;the Supreme Court of the United States for an injunction&nbsp;restraining the state of Georgia from executing its laws within&nbsp;the Cherokee territory, but the court dismissed his suit on the&nbsp;ground that it had no jurisdiction. There was a small party&nbsp;among the Cherokees under the leadership of John Ridge,&nbsp;a subchief, who were early disposed to treat with the United&nbsp;States for the removal of their nation west of the Mississippi,&nbsp;and in February 1835, while negotiations with Ridge were&nbsp;progressing at Washington, Ross proposed to cede the Cherokee&nbsp;lands to the United States for $20,000,000. The United&nbsp;States Senate resolved that $5,000,000 was sufficient. The&nbsp;treaty negotiated by the Ridge party and the proposal to treat&nbsp;on the basis of a $5,ooo,ooo-payment were both rejected in a&nbsp;full council of the Cherokees held in October 1835. The council&nbsp;authorized Ross to renew negotiations, but before leaving for&nbsp;Washington he was arrested by the Georgia authorities on&nbsp;the ground that he was a white man residing in the Indian&nbsp;country contrary to law. Ross was soon released, but in&nbsp;December of this year a few hundred Cherokees met the United&nbsp;States Indian commissioner at New Echota and concluded with&nbsp;him a treaty of removal. When Ross learned this he called a&nbsp;council to meet in February 1836, and at this meeting the treaty&nbsp;was declared null and void and a protest against the proceedings&nbsp;at New Echota was signed hy more than 12,000 Cherokees.&nbsp;Notwithstanding Ross’s opposition, the Senate in the following&nbsp;May ratified the treaty by a vote exceeding by one the necessary&nbsp;two-thirds majority, and in December 1838, .Ross, with the last&nbsp;party of Cherokees, left for the West (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Georgia).</span><span class="font1"> During&nbsp;the Civil War, Ross first urged upon the Cherokee Nation a&nbsp;policy of friendly inactivity; in May 1861, proclaimed a strict&nbsp;neutrality; in October 1861, signed a treaty with the Confederate&nbsp;States; in the summer of 1862 was forced (by Union sympathizers in the Nation) to proclaim neutrality again; soon&nbsp;afterwards went over to the Union lines; and was in Washington&nbsp;treating with the Federal government in February 1863 when&nbsp;the treaty with the Confederate States was abrogated by the&nbsp;Cherokees.

<p><span class="font1">ROSS, SIR JOHN (1777-1856), British rear-admiral and Arctic explorer, son of the Rev. Andrew Ross, minister of Inch,&nbsp;Wigtonshire, entered the Royal Navy in 1786, serving in the&nbsp;Mediterranean till 1789, and afterwards in the Channel. In&nbsp;1808 he acted as captain of the Swedish Fleet, and in 1812 was&nbsp;promoted commander. Six years later he was given the command of an Arctic expedition fitted out by the Admiralty, the&nbsp;first of a new series of attempts to solve the question of a North-West passage. This expedition failed to discover much that&nbsp;was new, and somewhat prejudiced the Arctic reputation of&nbsp;its leader, who attained the rank of captain on his return. But&nbsp;in 1829, through the munificence of Mr (afterwards Sir) Felix&nbsp;Booth, he was able to undertake a second Arctic expedition,&nbsp;which, during an absence of four years, achieved important&nbsp;geographical and scientific results. On his return Captain Ross&nbsp;was the recipient of gold medals from the English and French&nbsp;geographical societies, and of various foreign orders, including&nbsp;a knighthood of the Pole Star of Sweden, and in the following&nbsp;year (1834) received a knighthood and a C.B. at home. In&nbsp;1850 he undertook a third voyage to the Arctic regions, this&nbsp;time in search of Sir John Franklin, and in the following year&nbsp;he attained flag-rank. His publications include—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Voyage of&nbsp;Discovery for the Purpose of Exploring Baffin’s Bay</span><span class="font1"> (1819);&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Narrative of a Second Voyage in Search of a North-West Passage,&nbsp;including the Discovery of the North Magnetic Pole</span><span class="font1"> (1835);&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs and Correspondence of Lord De Saumerez</span><span class="font1"> (1838).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSS, ROBERT (1766-1814), British major-general, entered the 25th Foot at the age of nineteen, and in 1795 became captain&nbsp;in the 7th Regiment, obtaining a half-pay majority a few months&nbsp;later. As a major of the 20th he served in Holland under&nbsp;the duke of York in 1799. At the action of Krabbendam the&nbsp;regiment greatly distinguished itself, though largely composed&nbsp;of raw militia recruits. Ross was here severely wounded.&nbsp;In 1801 the 20th went to Egypt and took part in the final&nbsp;operations which led to Menou’s surrender. In 1803, though&nbsp;lieutenant-colonel only by hrevet, Ross succeeded to the command, and at once initiated a severe system of training, in&nbsp;barracks and in the field, in his regiment. The result of this&nbsp;was apparent when under Sir John Stuart’s command the regiment proceeded to Naples. The 20th played a decisive part in&nbsp;the brilliant action of Maida, and distinguished itself not less&nbsp;in the subsequent storm of the castle of Scylla. In 1808-9&nbsp;Ross and the 20th formed part of Anstruther’s brigade of Sir&nbsp;John Moore’s army in Spain, and though the statement that&nbsp;the 20th, owing to its good discipline, suffered less loss than any&nbsp;other regiment in the retreat on Corunna is incorrect, the&nbsp;regiment was among the best disciplined in the army. Later&nbsp;in 1809 it was sent to Walcheren, where fever soon laid low&nbsp;two-thirds of the men. Ross and his regiment were then sent&nbsp;to Ireland to recover, and here the colonel repeated the course&nbsp;of drill and manœuvre which had so markedly improved the&nbsp;20th in Malta. He received a gold medal for Corunna and a&nbsp;sword of honour for Maida (which action had already w’on him a</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
