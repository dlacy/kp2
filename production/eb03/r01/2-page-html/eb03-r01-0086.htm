<p><span class="font1">gulua of arſenic conſiſted in mixing four parts of arſenic with two parts of black flux, one part of borax, and one&nbsp;part of filings of iron or of copper, and quickly fuſing&nbsp;the mixture in a crucible. After the operation is finiſh-ed, a regulus of arſenic will be found at the bottom of&nbsp;the crucible of a white livid colour, and of confiderable&nbsp;ſolidity. The iron and copper employed in this pro-ceſs are not intended, as in the operation for the martial&nbsp;regulus of antimony, to precipitate the arſenic, and to&nbsp;ſeparate it from ſulphur or any other ſubſtance; for the&nbsp;white arſenic is pure, and nothing is to be taken from&nbsp;it; but, on the contrary, the inflammable principle is to&nbsp;be added to reduce it to a regulus. The true uſe oi&nbsp;theſe metals in the preſent operation is to unite with the&nbsp;regulus of arſenic, to give it more body, and to prevent&nbsp;its entire diſſipation in vapours. Hence the addition&nbsp;oſ iron, while it procures theſe advantages, has the in-conveniency of altering the purity of the regulus : for&nbsp;the metallic ſubſtance obtained is a regulus of arſenic&nbsp;allayed with iron. It may, however, be purified ſrom&nbsp;the iron by ſublimation in a clofe veffel ; by which operation the reguliſed arſenical part, whieh is very volatile,&nbsp;is fublimed to the top of the veffel, and is ſeparated&nbsp;from the iron, which being of a fixed nature remains at&nbsp;the bottom. λVe are not, however, very certain, that&nbsp;in this kind of rectification the regulus of arſenic does&nbsp;not carry along with it a certain quantity of iron ; for,&nbsp;in general, a volatile ſubſtance raiſes along with it, in&nbsp;ſublimation, a part of any fixed matter with which it&nbsp;happened to be united.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr Brandt propoſes another method, which we believe is preferable to that deſcribed. He directs that white arſenic ſſiould be mixed with ſoap. Inſtead of&nbsp;the ſoap, olive-oil may be uſed, which has been found&nbsp;to ſucceed well. The mixture is to be put into a retort&nbsp;or glaſs matraſs, and to be diſtilled or fublimed with&nbsp;fire, at fiiſt very moderate, and only ſuſſicient to raiſe&nbsp;thc oil. As the oils, which are not volatile, cannot be&nbsp;diſtilled but by a heat ſufficient to burn and decoπv&nbsp;poſe them, the oil therefore which is mixed with the&nbsp;arſenie undergoes theſe alterations, and after having&nbsp;penetrated the arſenic thoroughly ls reduced to a coal,&nbsp;when no more oily vapours riſe, we may then know&nbsp;that the oil is reduced to coal. Then the fire muſt be&nbsp;increaſed, and the metalliſed arſenie will be ſoon ſublimed to the upper part of the veffel, in the inſide of&nbsp;which it will form a metallic cruft, when no more&nbsp;ſublimes, the veffel is to be broken, and the adhering&nbsp;cruſt of regulus of arſenic is to be ſeparated. The regulus obtained by this firſt operation is not generally&nbsp;perfect, or not entirely ſo, as a part of it is always&nbsp;overcharged with fuliginous matter, and another part&nbsp;has not enough of phlogiſton ; which latter part adheres to the inner ſuiface of the cruſt, and forms grey&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">■or </span><span class="font1">brown cryſtals. This ſublimate muſt then be mixed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">with a leſs quantity of oil, and ſublimed a ſecond time like the firſt ; and even, to obtain as good regulus as&nbsp;may be made, a third ſublimation in a cloſe veſtel, and&nbsp;without oil, is neceffary. During this operation, the&nbsp;oil whieh riſes is more fetid than any other empyreu-matic oil, and is almoſt iiiſupportable. This ſmell certainly proceeds from the arſenic ; the ſmell of which is&nbsp;exceedingly ſtrong and disagreeable when heated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">' Regulus of arſenic made by the method we have de-ſcribed, and which we confider as the only one which is pure, has ail the properties oſ a ſemimetal. It has&nbsp;metallic gravity, opacity, and luſtre. Its colour is&nbsp;white and livid, .it tarniſhes in the air, is very brittle,&nbsp;but much more volatile than any other ſemime£al. It&nbsp;eaſily lofes its inflammable principle, when ſublimed in&nbsp;veffels into which the air has aeeeſs ; the fι&gt;blimate having the appearance of grey flowers, which by repeated ſublimations become entirely white, and ſimilar to&nbsp;white cryllalline arſenic. when regulus of arſenic is&nbsp;heated quickly and ſtrongly in open air, as under a&nbsp;muffle, it burns with a white or bluiſſi flame, and diſ-ſipates in a thick fume, which has a very fetid ſinell,&nbsp;like that of garlic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Regulus of arſenic may be combined with acids and moſt metals. See Arsenic, n<sup>Q</sup> 17. we ſhall only far-ther obſerve here, that, according to Mr Brandt, in&nbsp;the Swediſh Memoirs, the regulus of arfenic cannot&nbsp;be united with mercury. Although the phenomena&nbsp;exhibited by white arſenic and regulus of arſenie in ſo-lutions and allays are probably the lame, yet an accurate compariſon of thefe would defer ve notice, eſpecially if the regulus employed were well made; for ſome&nbsp;difference muſt proceed from the greater or leſs quantity of what in the old chemiſtry is called phlogiſton&nbsp;with which it is united. See Chemistry, n<sup>0</sup> 1288,&nbsp;&amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Regulus of Cobalt,</span><span class="font1"> is a ſemimetal lately diſcovered, and not yet perfectly well known. It receives its name&nbsp;from cobalt, becaufe it can only be extracted from the&nbsp;mineral properly ſo called. The proceſs by which this&nbsp;ſemimetal is obtained, is fimilar to thoſe generally uied&nbsp;for the extraction of metals from their ores. The co-balt muſt be thoroughly torrified, to deprive it of all&nbsp;the ſulphur and arſenic it contains ; and the unmetallic&nbsp;earthy and ſtony matters muſt be feparated by waſhing.&nbsp;The cobalt thus prepared is then to be mixed with&nbsp;double or triple its quantity of black flux, and a little&nbsp;decrepitated ſea-ſalt; and muſt be fufed either in a forge&nbsp;or in a hot furnace, for this ore is very difficult of fu-fion. when the fuſton has been well made, we find&nbsp;upon breaking the crucible, after it has cooled, a metallic regulus covered with a ſcoria of a deep blue co·&nbsp;lour. The regulus is of a white metallic colour. The&nbsp;ſurface of its fracture is cloſe and ſmall-grained. The&nbsp;ſemimetal is hard, but brittle, when the fuſion has&nbsp;been well made, its lurface appears to be carved with&nbsp;many convex threads, which croſs each other diverſely.&nbsp;As almoft all cobalts contain alſo biſmuth, and even as&nbsp;much as of the regulus itſelf, this biſmuth is reduced&nbsp;by the fame operation, and precipitated in the ſame&nbsp;manner, as the regulus of cobalt ; for although theſe&nbsp;two metals are frequently mixed in the ſame mineral,&nbsp;that is, in cobalt, they are incapable of uniting toge-ther, and are always found diſtinct aud ſeparate from&nbsp;one another when they are melted together. At the&nbsp;bottom of the crucible then we find both regulus of&nbsp;cobalt and biſinuth. The latter, having a greater ſpe-ciſie gravity, is found under the former. They may be</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ſeparated from each other by the blow of a hammer. Biſmuth may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the regulus&nbsp;of cobalt, not only from its ſituation in the crucible,&nbsp;but alſo by the large ihining facets which appear in its&nbsp;fracture, aud which are very different from the eloſe aſh*&nbsp;coloured grain of regulus of cobalt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This ſemimetal is more- difficult of fuſion. than any</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
