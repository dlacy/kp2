<p><span class="font1">only give preffure or reſiſtances many times exceeding thoſe that have been obſerved in our experiments, but&nbsp;would alfo totally change the proportions which this&nbsp;theory determines. It was at any rate improper to em-barraſs an uiveſtigation, already very intricate, with the&nbsp;preffure of gravity, and with two motions of efflux,&nbsp;which do not exiſt, and are neceffary for making the&nbsp;preffures in the ratio of tt-f-<sup>c</sup>i∕ and «—τΛ</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr Prony has been at no pains to inform his readers of his reafons for adopting this theory of reſiftance, ſo&nbsp;contrary to all received opinions, and to the moſt diſtinct&nbsp;experiments. Thoſe of the French academy, made un-der greater preffures, gave a much ſmaller reſiſtance ; and&nbsp;the very experiments adduced in ſupport of this theory&nbsp;are extremely deficient, wanting fully Jd of what the&nbsp;theory requires. The reſiſtances by experiment were&nbsp;15∣ and 26J, and the theory required 20⅜ and 39,&nbsp;The equation, however, deduced ſrom the theory is&nbsp;greatly deficient in the expreſſion of the preffures cau'&nbsp;fed by the accumulation and depreſſion, ſtating the</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">becauſe the heaped up water flows off at the ſides, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font1">alſo comes in behind by the ſides j ſo that the preſſure&nbsp;is much leſs than half the weight oſ a column whoſe</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">height is —; both becauſe the accumulation and de-2∙P</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">preffion are leſs at the ſides than in the middle, and be-cauſe, when the body is wholly immerſed, the accumu-Jation is greatly diminiſhed. Indeed in this caſe the final equation does not include their effects, though as&nbsp;real in this caſe as when part of the body is above water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Upon the whole, we are ſomewhat ſurpriſed that an author of D’Ulioa’s eminence ſhould have adopted a&nbsp;theory ſo unneceſſarily and ſo improperly embarraſſed&nbsp;with foreign circumſtances ; and that Mr Prony ſhould&nbsp;have inferted it with the explanation by which he was&nbsp;to abide, in a work deſtined ſor practical uſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This point, or the effect oſ deep immerſion, is ſtill much esnteſted ; and it 13 a received opinion, by many not ac-cuſtomed to mathematical reſearches, that the reſiſtance&nbsp;is greater in greater depths. This is aſſumed as an important principle by Mr Gordon, author of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">A Theory&nbsp;of Naval Architecture ;</span><span class="font1"> but on very vague and flight&nbsp;grounds ; and the author ſeems unacquainted with the&nbsp;manner </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">reafoning on ſuch ſubjects. It ſhall be con-ſidered afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">with theſe corrections, it may be aſſerted that theory and experiment agree very well in this reſpect, and that&nbsp;the reſiſtance may be aſſerted to </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">be </span><span class="font1">in the duplicate ratio of the velocity,</span></p>
<p><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">we </span><span class="font1">have been more minute on this ſubject, becaujfe </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font1">is the leading propofition in the theory of the ac</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

He only ſhows, that if there ba&nbsp;nothing concerned in the communication but pure ⅛-ertia, the ſum total of the motions of the particles, eſti-mated in the direction of the bodies motion, or that of&nbsp;the ſtream, will be </span><span class="font4">in </span><span class="font1">the duplicate ratio of the velocity.&nbsp;It was therefore of importance to ſhow that thia part&nbsp;of the theory was juſt, To do this, we had to conſider&nbsp;the effect of every circumſtance which could be combined with the inertia of the fluid, AU theſe had been&nbsp;forefeen by that great man, and are moſt briefly, though&nbsp;perſpicuouſly, mentioned in the laſt ſ¢hoHum to prop. </span><span class="font6" style="font-weight:bold;">36.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">B.
