<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Charles V.,</span><span class="font1"> or even the first book of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Scotland,</span><span class="font1"> showed that he had a wider and more synthetic&nbsp;conception of history than either the author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Decline&nbsp;and Fall</span><span class="font1"> or the author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of England.</span><span class="font1"> These&nbsp;two portions of Robertson’s work, with all their shortcomings in the eye of modern criticism, have a distinctive&nbsp;value which time cannot take away. He was one of the&nbsp;first to see the importance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">general ideas</span><span class="font1"> in history. He&nbsp;saw that the immediate narrative of events with which&nbsp;he was occupied needed a background of broad and connected generalizations, referring to the social state of which&nbsp;the detailed history formed a part. But he did more&nbsp;than this. In the appendix to the view of Europe called&nbsp;“ Proofs and Illustrations ” he enters into the difficult and&nbsp;obscure question of land tenure in Frankish times, and&nbsp;of the origin of the feudal system, with a sagacity and&nbsp;knowledge which distinctly advanced the comprehension&nbsp;of this period beyond the point at which it had been left&nbsp;by Du Bos, Montesquieu, and Mably. He was fully&nbsp;acquainted with the original documents,—many of them,&nbsp;we may conjecture, not easy to procure in Scotland. It&nbsp;must have been a genuine aptitude for historical research&nbsp;of a scientific kind which led Robertson to undertake the&nbsp;labour of these austere disquisitions of which there were&nbsp;not many in his day who saw the importance. Gibbon,&nbsp;so superior to him for wide reading and scholarship, has&nbsp;pointedly avoided them. It need hardly be said that&nbsp;many, perhaps the majority, of Robertson’s views on this&nbsp;thorny topic are out of date now. But he deserves the&nbsp;honour of a pioneer in one of the most obscure if also&nbsp;important lines of inquiry connected with European&nbsp;history. On the other hand, it must be admitted that&nbsp;he showed himself only too tame a follower of Voltaire&nbsp;in his general appreciation of the Middle Ages, which&nbsp;he regarded with the mingled ignorance and prejudice&nbsp;common in the l8th century. In this particular he was&nbsp;not at all in advance of his age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The neglect and gradual oblivion which are now overtaking the greater part of Robertson’s historical work are owing to no fault of his. He had not and could not have&nbsp;the requisite materials : they were not published or accessible. Justice requires that we should estimate his performance in view of the means at his command, and few&nbsp;critics would hesitate to subscribe to the verdict of Buckle,&nbsp;“ that what he effected with his materials was wonderful.”&nbsp;His style, whether of narrative or disquisition, is singularly&nbsp;clear, harmonious, and persuasive. The most serious reproach made against it is that it is correct to a fault and&nbsp;lacks idiomatic vigour, and the charge is not without&nbsp;foundation. But there can be no doubt that, if Robertson’s&nbsp;writings are less read than they formerly were, the fact is&nbsp;to be attributed to no defects of style but to the growth of&nbsp;knowledge and to the immense extension of historical&nbsp;research which has inevitably superseded his initiatory&nbsp;and meritorious labours.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j. c. mo.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBERVAL, Gilles Personne de (1602-1675), French mathematician, was born at the village of Roberval near&nbsp;Beauvais in 1602. His name was originally Gilles Personne, that of Roberval, by which he is known, being&nbsp;taken from the place of his birth. Like Descartes, he was&nbsp;present at the siege of La Rochelle in 1627. In the same&nbsp;year he went to Paris, where he was appointed to the chair&nbsp;of philosophy in the Gervais College in 1631, and afterwards to the chair of mathematics in the Royal College of&nbsp;France. A condition of tenure attached to this chair was&nbsp;that the holder should propose mathematical questions for&nbsp;solution, and should resign in favour of any person who&nbsp;solved them better than himself ; but, notwithstanding&nbsp;this, Roberval was able to keep the chair till his death,&nbsp;which occurred at Paris in 1675.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roberval was one of those mathematicians who, just before the invention of the calculus, occupied their attention with problems&nbsp;which are only soluble, or can be most easily solved, by some&nbsp;method involving limits or infinitesimals, and in the solution of&nbsp;which accordingly the calculus is always now employed. Thus he&nbsp;devoted some attention to the quadrature of curves and the cuba-ture of surfaces, which he accomplished, in some of the simpler&nbsp;cases, by a method of his own, called by himself the “ Method of&nbsp;Indivisibles ” ; but he lost much of the credit of the discovery as&nbsp;he kept his method for his own use, while Cavalieri published a&nbsp;similar method of his own. Another of RobervaΓs discoveries was&nbsp;a very general method of drawing tangents, by considering a curve&nbsp;as described by a moving point whose motion is the resultant of&nbsp;several simpler motions. His own description of his method may&nbsp;be translated as follows :—“ General rule. By means of the specific&nbsp;properties of the curve, which will be given, examine the different&nbsp;motions of the tracing point at the place where you wish to draw&nbsp;the tangent ; the direction of the tangent is that of the resultant&nbsp;of these motions.” He also discovered a method of deriving one&nbsp;curve from another, by means of which finite areas can be obtained&nbsp;equal to the areas between certain curves and their asymptotes.&nbsp;To these curves, which were also applied to effect some quadratures,&nbsp;Torricelli gave the name of Robervallian lines. Between Roberval&nbsp;and Descartes there existed a feeling of ill-will, owing to the&nbsp;jealousy aroused in the mind of the former by the criticism which&nbsp;Descartes offered to some of the methods employed by him and by&nbsp;Fermat ; and this led him to criticize and oppose the new geometry&nbsp;which Descartes introduced about this time. As results of RobervaΓs&nbsp;labours outside the department of pure mathematics may be noted&nbsp;a work on the system of the universe, in which he supports the&nbsp;Copernican system and attributes a mutual attraction to all particles of matter ; and also the invention of a special kind of balance&nbsp;which goes by his name (see Balance, vol. iii. p. 266).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBESPIERRE, Maximilien Marie Isidore (1758-1794), the most fanatical and most famous of the republican leaders of the French Revolution, was born at Arras on 6th May 1758. His family was of Irish descent, having&nbsp;emigrated from Ireland at the time of the Reformation on&nbsp;account of religion, and his direct ancestors in the male&nbsp;line had been notaries at the little village of Carvin near&nbsp;Arras from the beginning of the 17th century. His grandfather, being more ambitious, established himself at Arras&nbsp;as an avocat; and his father followed the same profession,&nbsp;marrying Mademoiselle Josephine Carraut, daughter of a&nbsp;brewer in the same city, in 1757. Of this marriage four&nbsp;children were born, two sons and two daughters, of whom&nbsp;Maximilien was the eldest; but in 1767 Madame Derobes-pierre, as the name was then spelt, died, and the disconsolate widower at once left Arras and wandered about&nbsp;Europe until his death at Munich in 1769. The children&nbsp;were taken charge of by their maternal grandfather and&nbsp;aunts, and Maximilien was sent to the college of Arras,&nbsp;whence he was nominated in 1770 by the bishop of his&nbsp;native town to a bursarship at the Collége Louis-le-Grand&nbsp;at Paris. Here he had for fellow-pupils Camille Desmoulins and Stanislas Fréron. Completing his law studies&nbsp;with distinction, and having been admitted an avocat in&nbsp;1781, Robespierre returned to his native city to seek for&nbsp;practice, and to struggle against poverty. His reputation had already preceded him, and the bishop of Arras,&nbsp;M. de Conzié, appointed him criminal judge in the diocese&nbsp;of Arras in March 1782. This appointment, which he&nbsp;soon resigned, to avoid pronouncing a sentence of death,&nbsp;did not prevent his practising at the bar, and he speedily&nbsp;became known as a careful and painstaking advocate.&nbsp;His argument in the question of the legality of paratonnerres or lightning-conductors, which was widely reported&nbsp;and translated into both English and German, raised his&nbsp;fame as an advocate to its height, and with this success&nbsp;his struggles against poverty were over. He now turned&nbsp;to the pleasures of literature and society and came to be&nbsp;esteemed as one of the best writers and most popular&nbsp;dandies of Arras. In December 1783 he was elected a&nbsp;member of the academy of Arras, whose meetings he&nbsp;attended regularly ; and, like all other young Frenchmen&nbsp;with literary proclivities, he began to compete for the</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
