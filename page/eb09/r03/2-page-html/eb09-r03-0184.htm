<p><span class="font0">R</span><span class="font2">OTHE, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Richard</span><span class="font2"> (1799-1867), theologian, was born at Posen, January 28, 1799, of parents in a good&nbsp;position. After passing through the grammar schools of&nbsp;Stettin and Breslau, he studied theology in the universities&nbsp;of Heidelberg and Berlin (1817-20) under Daub, Schleiermacher, and Neander, the philosophers and historians&nbsp;Hegel, Creuzer, and Schlosser, exercising a considerable&nbsp;influence in shaping his thought. From 1820 to 1822 he&nbsp;was in the clerical seminary at Wittenberg, and spent the&nbsp;next year in private study under his father’s roof at&nbsp;Breslau. In the autumn of 1823 he was appointed&nbsp;chaplain to the Prussian embassy in Rome, of which&nbsp;Baron Bunsen was the head. This post he exchanged&nbsp;in 1828 for a professorship in the Wittenberg seminary,&nbsp;and hence in 1837 he removed to Heidelberg as professor&nbsp;and director of a new clerical seminary; in 1849 he&nbsp;accepted an invitation to Bonn as professor and university&nbsp;preacher, but in 1854 he returned to Heidelberg as professor of theology and member of the Oberkirchenrath,&nbsp;a position he held until his death, August 20, 1867.&nbsp;Rothe’s mental and religious development was one of&nbsp;continuous progress. As a youth he was the subject of&nbsp;deep religious feeling, with a decided bent towards a&nbsp;supernatural mysticism ; his chosen authors were those&nbsp;of the romantic school, and Novalis remained his life&nbsp;through a special favourite. In Berlin and Wittenberg&nbsp;he came under the influence of Pietism as represented by&nbsp;such men as Stier and Tholuck, though the latter pronounced him a “ very modern Christian.” He afterwards&nbsp;himself confessed that, though he had been a sincere, he&nbsp;was never a happy Pietist. In Rome, where he enjoyed&nbsp;the intimate friendship of Bunsen, and studied church&nbsp;history under the broadening influence of classical and&nbsp;ecclesiastical art, his mind broke loose from the straitened&nbsp;life and narrow views of Pietism and he learned to look&nbsp;at Christianity in its human and Universalistic aspects.&nbsp;From that time he began to develop and work out his&nbsp;great idea, the inseparable relation of religion and morals,&nbsp;finding in the latter the necessary sphere and the realization of the idea of the former. He began then, and&nbsp;particularly after the revolution of July 1830, likewise&nbsp;to give a more definite form to his peculiar view of the&nbsp;relations of church and state. In consequence of this&nbsp;enlargement of his ideas of tho world, religion, morals,&nbsp;Christianity, the church and the state, Rothe gradually&nbsp;found himself out of harmony with the Pietistic&nbsp;thought and life of Wittenberg, and his removal to&nbsp;Heidelberg in 1837 and the publication of his first&nbsp;important work </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Anfänge der christlichen Kirchen</span><span class="font2"> in&nbsp;that year coincide with the attainment of the principal&nbsp;theological positions with which his name is associated.&nbsp;During the middle period of his career (1837-61) he led&nbsp;the life of a scholastic recluse, taking no active public&nbsp;part in ecclesiastical affairs in any way. During the last&nbsp;six years of his life (1861-67), partly owing to his&nbsp;liberation from great domestic cares and partly to the&nbsp;special circumstances of the church in Baden, he came&nbsp;forward publicly and actively as the advocate of a free&nbsp;theology and of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Protestantenvereih </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(g.v.</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">∖</span><span class="font2"> This&nbsp;important change in Rothe’s practice was preceded by&nbsp;the publication of a valuable series of theological essays&nbsp;(in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Studien und Kritiken</span><span class="font2"> for 1860), afterwards published&nbsp;in a separate volume </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Zur Dogmatik,</span><span class="font2"> Gotha, 1st ed.&nbsp;1863, 2d ed. 1869), on revelation and inspiration more&nbsp;particularly. These essays were a very searching examination of the relation of revelation to Scripture, and provoked much hostile criticism in quarters previously&nbsp;friendly to Rothe, where the relation was usually treated&nbsp;as almost one of identity. In consequence of this publication, and his advocacy of the programme of the Protestantenverein, he was classed at the end of his life&nbsp;amongst the more decided theological liberals rather than&nbsp;with the moderate orthodox party, amongst whom so many&nbsp;of his personal friends were to be found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rothe was one of the most if not the most profound and influential of modern German theologians next to&nbsp;Schleiermacher. Like the latter he combined with the&nbsp;keenest logical faculty an intensely religious spirit, while&nbsp;his philosophical tendencies were rather in sympathy with&nbsp;Hegel than Schleiermacher, and theosophic mysticism was&nbsp;more congenial to him than the abstractions of Spinoza,&nbsp;to whom Schleiermacher owed so much. He classed himself amongst the theosophists, and energetically claimed&nbsp;to be a convinced and happy supernaturalist in a scientific&nbsp;age. A peculiarity of his thought was its systematic&nbsp;completeness and consistency ; aphoristic, unsystematic,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
