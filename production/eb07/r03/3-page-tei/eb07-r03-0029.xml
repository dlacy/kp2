The Russians were soon overpowered, and Igor being made prisoner, was put to death.</p><p>Before the death of Oleg, Igor had married a princess of a bold and daring spirit, named Olga, by whom he had one son, Sviatoslaf ; but as this boy was very young at the death of his father, the queen-mother Olga assumed the reins of government. Her first care was to take signal vengeance upon the unhappy Drevlians, for having bravely defended themselves against the encroachments of foreign enemies. This tribe, satisfied with the death of their oppressor, appeared desirous of renewing their amicable intercourse with the Russians, and their chief, Male, is even said to have made an offer of his hand to Igor’s widow. Olga, with that deep cunning and concealed malice that so often mark the character of the despotic leader of a barbarous people, pretended to listen to their overtures, and received the deputies of Male, but immediately ordered them to be privately put to death. In the mean time she invited a larger deputation from the Drevlian chief, which she treated in the same inhuman manner, taking care that no tidings of either murder should be carried to the Drevlians. She then set out, as if on an amicable visit, to conclude the new alliance, and having proclaimed a solemn entertainment, to which she invited some hundreds of the principal inhabitants of the Drevlian towns, she caused them to be treacherously assassinated. But this was only the first step to the more dreadful vengeance which she had resolved to inflict on this deluded people. She laid waste the whole country of the Drevlians, and in particular the town near which Igor had lost his life. For a long time she could not master the place, as the inhabitants, dreading the horrible fate that awaited them, from the revengeful spirit of Olga, defended themselves with the utmost valour and success. At length, being assured of clemency, upon condition of sending to their besieger all the pigeons of the town, they submitted ; but the queen causing lighted matches to be fastened to the tails of the pigeons, set them at liberty. The birds flew to their usual places of residence in the town, which were speedily in a conflagration. The wretched inhabitants endeavouring to escape the flames, fell into the hands of the Russsian soldiers, planted around the town for that purpose, by whom they were put to the sword.</p><p>This was the only warlike transaction, if it deserves that name, which took place during the regency of Olga. Though not uncommon in the annals of a barbarous people, it would have been sufficient to hand down her name with detestation to posterity, had she not, in the opinion of her panegyrists, atoned for the enormity by attempting to introduce into her dominions the Christian religion.</p><p>Hitherto the Slavi, and the Scandinavian nations who had taken possession of their territories, were Pagans ; and their religious ceremonies, like those of all the surrounding nations, were marked by an absurd and cruel superstition. Their deities seem to have been borrowed, partly from the Greeks and Romans, and partly from the Scythians ; but were characterised by peculiar names, and represented by idols of complex workmanship and grotesque appearance. Thus, the god Perune, or Perkune, who was the chief among the Slavonian deities, was personated by an idol whose head was of silver, its ears and mustachios of massy gold, its legs of iron, and its trunk of hard incorruptible wood. It was decorated with rubies and carbuncles, and held in its hand a stone carved, being the symbol of lightning. The sacred fire burned continually before it ; and if the priests suffered this to be extinguished, they were doomed to perish in the flames, as enemies of the god. Sacrifices of their flocks to this supreme deity were regarded as trifling. His altar smoked with the blood of captives, and even the children of his worshippers were sometimes immolated to appease his wrath or propitiate his favour.</p><p>It is uncertain at what time the light of Christianity began to beam on the nations that occupied the banks <hi rend="italic">of </hi>the Dnieper, nor are we acquainted with the circumstances that led to the conversion of the queen-regent. We find, however, that about the middle of the tenth century, she undertook a journey to Constantinople for the express purpose of being initiated into the religion of Jesus. Constantine Porphyrogenneta, who then sat on the imperial throne, received the royal convert with the greatest honour and respect ; he himself conducted her to the baptismal font, and, in the character of her sponsor, gave to her the name of Helen. Her example, however, had little influence on her son, or the nation at large. The Russians do not seem to have been very ardent in their religious observances, nor peculiarly attached to the opinions of their forefathers ; but the nature of Christianity, and the character of its disciples, were not in their eyes sufficiently striking or alluring to produce any change in their religious system. Olga’s son, Sviatoslaf, either from his contempt for the unwarlike character of the Greek Christians, or through fear of the ridicule to which his conversion might subject him from his young companions, disregarded all his mother’s solicitations. He did not, however, prevent the people from receiving baptism, and a few proselytes were made. Though the character of Olga, even after her conversion to Christianity, was by no means such as to entitle her to the rank which she afterwards attained among the Russian saints, it appears that she had given her son many wise and prudent instructions respecting the government of his future empire. She travelled with him round the country ; superintended the erection of bridges and the making of roads, for the benefit of trade and commerce ; built several towns and villages, and founded such laudable institutions, as sufficiently evince her talents for governing a nation. She died about the year 969, at a very advanced age.</p><p>It is probable that Olga retired from the administration of affairs soon after her conversion to Christianity ; for we find Sviatoslaf in full possession of the government long before his mother’s death. This prince has been considered as one of the Russian heroes ; and if a thirst for blood, a contempt of danger, and a disregard of the luxuries and conveniences of life, be admitted as the characteristics of a hero, he deserves the appellation. His habits rendered him the idol of his army. He took up his habitation in the camp, where he led a life exactly similar to that of the meanest soldier.</p><p>His first expedition was against the Kozares, a people who had come from the shores of the Caspian and the sides of the Caucasus, and had established themselves along the eastern coast of the Black Sea. They had rendered tributary both the Kievians, and the Viateches, a Slavonian nation that dwelt on the banks of the Oka and the Volga. Sviatoslaf, desirous of transferring to himself the tribute which the Kozares derived from the latter people, marched against them, and appears to have succeeded in his design. He defeated them in a pitched battle, and took by storm their capital city, Sarkel or Belgorod. It is said by some historians that he even annihilated the nation ; and certain it is, that from that time no mention is made of the Kozares.</p><p>The martial fame of Sviatoslaf had extended to Constantinople ; and the Emperor Nicephorus Phocas, who was then harassed by the Ungrians, assisted by his treacherous allies the Bulgarians, applied for succours to the Russian chieftain. A subsidiary treaty was entered into between them, and Sviatoslaf hastened southward with a numerous army. He quickly made himself master of most of the Bulgarian towns along the Danube, and was so elated with his success that he determined to remove the centre of his government from Kief to the city of Pereiaslavatz, now Yamboly, situated upon the shores of that river.
