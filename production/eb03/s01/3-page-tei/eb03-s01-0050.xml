            <p>time to draw it out. This part of the proceſs is performed by raking the ſalt to one
                fide of the pan into a long heap, where it drains a while from the brine, and is
                then filled out into barrows or other proper veſſels, and carried into the
                ſtore-houſe, and delivered into the cuſtody of his majeſty’s officers. And in this
                manner the whole proceſs is performed in 24 hours; the ſalt being uſually drawn
                every morning.</p>
            <p>In the ſtore-houſe the ſalt is put hot into drabs, which are partitions like ſtalls
                for horſes, lined on three ſides and at the bottom with boards, and having a
                ſliding- board on the fore-ſide to put in or draw out as occaſion requires. The
                bottoms are made ſhelving, being higheſt at the back-ſide, and gradually inclining
                forwards; by which means the ſaline liquor, which remains mixed with the ſalt,
                eaſiiy drains from it; and the ſalt, in three or four days, becomes ſufficiently
                dry; and is then taken out of the drabs, and laid up in large heaps, where it is
                ready for ſale.</p>
            <p>The ſaline liquor which drains from the ſalt is not a pure brine of common ſalt, but
                hath a ſharp and bitter taſte, and is therefore called <hi rend="italic"
                    >bittern;</hi> this liquor, at ſome works, they ſave for particular uſes, at
                others throw away. A conſiderable quantity of this bittern is left at the bottom of
                the pan after the proceſs is finiſhed; which, as it contains much ſalt, they ſuffer
                to remain in the pan, when it is filled up with ſea-water. But at each proceſs this
                liquor becomes more ſharp and bitter, and alſo increaſes in quantity: ſo that, after
                the third or fourth proceſs is finiſhed, they are obliged to take it out of the pan;
                otherwiſe it mixes in ſuch quantities with the ſalt, as to give it a bitter taſte,
                and diſpoſes it to grow ſoft and run in the open air, and renders it unfit for
                domeſtic uſes.</p>
            <p>After each proceſs there alſo adheres to the bottom and ſides of the pan a white
                ſtony cruſt, of the ſame calcareous ſubſtance with that before collected from the
                boiling liquor. This the operators call<hi rend="italic"> ſtone-ſcratch,</hi>
                diſtinguiſhing the other found in the lead-pans by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >powder-ſcratch.</hi> Once in eight or ten days they ſeparate the ſtone-ſcratch
                from their pans with iron picks, and in ſeveral places find it a quarter of an inch
                in thickneſs. If this ſtony cruſt is ſuffered to adhere to the pan much longer, it
                grows ſo thick that the pan is burnt by the fire, and quickly wears away.</p>
            <p>In M. de Pagés’s Travels round the World, we find the following important fact. “I
                had been anxious (ſays that author) to aſcertain by compariſon, whether ſea-water
                contains felt in greater quantity under the torrid than under the other zones; and
                my experiments on this ſubject ſerved to ſhow, contrary to what I expected, that
                ſea-water is impregnated with ſalt in leſs quantity within than without the tropics.
                ” Theſe experiments were made on a hundred pounds of ſea-water, taken at the depth
                of ten fathoms, and weighed in water-ſcales. M. de Pages has given a table of theſe
                experiments, from which it appears that 100 lb. of ſea- water in 46⁰ I2'' S. lat.
                gave 4<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> lb. of ſalt, and in
                1⁰ 16" only 3<hi rend="superscript">1/</hi><hi rend="subscript">2</hi> lb.; and that
                in 74 N. lat. it gave 4<hi rend="superscript">3</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">4</hi> lb.
                and in 4⁰ 22' only 3<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> lb.
                theſe being the higheſt and loweſt latitudes in which the experiments were made, and
                alſo the greateſt and leaſt quantities of ſalt.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Duty</hi> on SALT, is a diſtinct branch of his majeſty’s</p>
            <p>extraordinary revenue, and confiſts in an exciſe of 3 s, 4 d. per buſhel impoſed upon
                all ſalt, by ſeveral ſtatutes of King William and other ſubſequent reigns. This is
                not generally called an exciſe, becauſe under the management of different
                commiſſioners: but the commiſſioners of the ſalt-duties have, hy ſtatute 1 Ann, c.
                21. the ſame powers, and muſt obſerve the fame regulations, as thoſe of other
                exciſes. This tax had uſually been only temporary; but by ſtatute 26 Geo. II. c. 3.
                was made perpetual.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Triple</hi>
                <hi rend="italic smallcaps">Salts,</hi> a kind of ſalts formed by the union of three
                ingredients; the common neutrals being compoſed only of two. They are but lately
                diſcovered; and it is chiefly to the induſtry of Mr Bergman that we owe the
                knowledge we have of them. Sometimes we meet even with ſalts of four ingredients; in
                which cafe we call the reſulting compounds <hi rend="italic">quadruple</hi> ſalts.
                The moſt remarkable of theſe complicated ſubſtances are the following.</p>

            <p> 1. <hi rend="italic">Aphronitrum,</hi> or mineral alkali, combined with a ſmall
                quantity of calcareous earth. The three ingredients here are fixed air, pure alkali,
                and calcareous earth. “This ſalt (fays Cronſtedt) is ſo ſtrongly united with the
                calcareous earth, that the latter enters with it into the very cryſtals of the ſalt;
                though, by repeated ſolutions, the earth is by degrees ſeparated from it, and falls
                to the bottom after every ſolution. ” Cartheuſer aſſerts, that, on throwing into its
                ſolution in water a fixed mineral alkali, the calcareous earth was precipitated; and
                on the contrary, by adding oil of vitriol, nitrous acid was expelled, and a
                Glauber’s ſalt produced; “from which (ſays M. Magellan) it is evident, that the
                aphronitrum is a triple felt ariſing from the combination of the nitrous acid with
                calcareous earth and mineral fixed alkali. ” Wallerius mentions three ſpecies of
                this ſalt; <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> one which contains only a mixture of
                calcareous earth with fixed mineral alkali. This, he ſays, is the aphronitrum of the
                ancients; but he thinks that it ought to be rather called <hi rend="italic"
                    >aphronatron,</hi> as they beſtowed the name of <hi rend="italic">natron</hi>
                upon the mineral alkali. The ſecond ſpecies is that deſcribed by Cronſtedt under the
                title of <hi rend="italic">calcareous nitre.</hi> The third is that deſcribed by
                Hoffman under the title of <hi rend="italic">aphrοnitrum janenſe,</hi> into whoſe
                compofition the vitriolic acid enters. It is a kind of Glauber’s felt, and is
                frequently confounded with it.</p>
            <p>The aphronitrum of Cronſtedt is deſcribed by him as appearing on old walls and below
                vaults, or in places where it cannot be waſhed away by the rain. When it contains
                any conſiderable quantity of calcareous earth, it ſhoots into rhomboidal cryſtals, a
                figure frequently affected by the calcareous earth when it ſhoots into cryſtals: but
                when the aphronitrum is purer, it forms priſmatic cryſtals. From theſe
                circumſtances, M. Magellan thinks, that the aphronitrum is not only a triple but a
                multiple felt; as theſe pieces of old mortar, covered with this white froſt, on
                ancient walls, are the very ſame from which the ſaltpetre-makers extract the mother
                water of nitre; after mixing with it the vegetable aſhes to furniſh the alkali.</p>
            <p> 2. Common ſalt with magnefia, or mineral alkali, contaminated by muriatic magneſia.
                This is a compound of common felt with magneſia, and is very deliqueſcent, owing to
                the compound of magneſia and ſpi-</p>
