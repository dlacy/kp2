                    Indian war, in which he accompanied Bacchus.’ It were ſuperfluous iu a mere
                    effay to run any length in the parallel between this European god and the
                    ſovereign of Ayodhya, whom the Hindoos believe to have been an appearance on
                    earth of the preſerving power ; to have been a conqueror of the higheſt renown,
                    and the deliverer of nations from tyrants, as well as of his confort Sita from
                    the giant Ravan king of Lanca ; and to have commanded in chief a numerous and

                <p>army of ſatyrs have been only a race of mountaineers, whom Rama, if ſuch a
                    monarch ever exiſted, had civilized ? However that may be, the large breed of
                    Indian apes is at this moment held in high veneration by tlie Hindoos, and fed
                    with devotion by the Brahmans, who ſeent in two or three places on the banks of
                    the Ganges to have a regular endowment for the ſupport of them : they live in
                    tribes of three or four hundred, are wonderfully gentle (I ſpeak as an
                    eye-witneſs), and ap-pear to have fome kind of order and ſubordination in their
                    little ſylvan polity.” The feſtival of Rhama is held on the 9th day of the new
                    moon of Chaitra, on which the war of Lauca is dramatically repreſented,
                    conclu-ding with an exhibition of the fire ordeal, by which the victor’s wife
                    Sita gave proof of her connubial fidelity. Among the Hindoos there are a variety
                    of very fine dramas of great antiquity on the ſtory of Rhama.</p>
                <p>There are three Rhamas mentioned in the Indian mythology, who, together with
                    Criſhna, the darling god of the Indian women, are defcribed as youths of perfect
                    beauty. The third Rhama is Criſhna’s elder brother, and is conſidered as the
                    eighth Avatar<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> <hi rend="italic">Avatar</hi> means the descent of the deity in his
                        capacity of preſerver. The three ſirſt of theſe defcents re· late to ſome
                        ſtupendous convulſion of our globe from the fountains of the deep, and the
                        fourth exhibits the miraculous puniſhment of pride and impiety, appearing to
                        refer to the deluge. Three of the others were ordaiued for the overthrow of
                        tyrants or giants. Of theſe Avatars we have mentioned in the text, that
                        Rhama is the eighth ; Buddha, who appears to have been a reformer of the
                        doctrines contained in Vedas, is the ninth : the tenth Avatar, we are told,
                        is yet to come, and is expected to appear mounted (like the crowned
                        conqueror in the Apocalypſe) on a white horſe, with a ſcimeter blazing like
                        a comet to mow down all incorrigible and impertinent offenders who ſhall
                        then be on the earth.</note>, inveſted with an emanation of his divine
                    radiance. Like all the Avatars, Rhama is painted with gemmed Ethiopian or
                    Parthian coronets ; with rays encircling his head, jewels in his ears, two
                    necklaces, oae ſtraight and one pendant on his boſom, with dropping gems ;
                    garlands of well-diſpofed many-coloured flowers, or collars of pearls, hanging
                    down below his waiſt ; looſe mantles of golden tiffue or dyed ſilk, embroidered
                    on the hems with flowérs elegantly thrown over one ſhoulder, and folded like
                    ribbands acloſs the breaſt ; with bracelets, two on one arm and on each wriſt :
                    all the Avatars are naked to the waiſſs, and uniformly with dark azure fleſh, in
                    alluſion probably to the tint of that primordial fluid on which Narayan moved in
                    the beginning of time ; but their ſkirts are bright yellow, the colour of the
                    curious pericarpium in the centre of the water-lily.</p>
