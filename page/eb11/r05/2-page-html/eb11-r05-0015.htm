<p><span class="font1">or it had belonged to Leodegrance, king of Cornwall and father of Guenevere, and was given to Arthur on his marriage with&nbsp;that princess. When the founding of the Round Table is&nbsp;ascribed to Merlin it is generally in close connexion with the&nbsp;Grail legend, forming the last of a series of three, founded in&nbsp;honour of the Trinity—the first being the table of the Last&nbsp;Supper, the second that of the Grail, established by Joseph&nbsp;of Arimathea The number of knights whom the table will&nbsp;seat varies; it might seat twelve or fifty or a hundred and&nbsp;fifty; nowhere, save in Layamon, do we find a practically unlimited power of accommodation. It is also to be noted that&nbsp;whereas, in the pseudo-chronicles, it is the common table of&nbsp;Arthur’s court, designed in the interests of peace and unity,&nbsp;in the romances it is a sign of superiority, only the best and&nbsp;most valiant knights being adjudged worthy of a seat at the&nbsp;Round Table. In fact, it has become the equivalent of an&nbsp;order of knighthood, the members of which form a brotherhood&nbsp;bound by oath to succour each other at need and to refrain&nbsp;from fighting among themselves. The membership is not&nbsp;restricted to the knights of Arthur’s immediate court and&nbsp;household, knights who are, in all essentials outsiders, appearing&nbsp;but as passing guests at Arthur’s board, such as, e.g., Perceval&nbsp;and Tristan, may be elected knights of the Round Table. In&nbsp;two romances, the prose </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tristan</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Parzival,</span><span class="font1"> the place&nbsp;of the Round Table proper is taken, on a journey, by a&nbsp;silken doth laid on the ground, round which the knights are&nbsp;seated. In the versions more closely connected with the Grail&nbsp;story the name of the chosen knight appears on his seat, and&nbsp;there is one vacant place, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Siege perilous,</span><span class="font1"> eventually to be&nbsp;filled by the Grail winner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is obvious that the tradition has passed through several stages, and has varied in the process. The original source is&nbsp;not easy to determine. Dr Lewis Mott has pointed out that&nbsp;“ Round Tables ” exist in many parts of Great Britain, the&nbsp;name being often associated with circular trenches, or rings&nbsp;of stones, which were demonstrably employed in connexion&nbsp;with the agricultural festivals held at Pentecost, Midsummer&nbsp;and Michaelmas. However this may be, and it seems probable&nbsp;that Dr Mott is right in his identification, the pseudo-chroniclers&nbsp;and romance writers certainly had in their minds a genuine&nbsp;table, although, probably, one of magical properties. Thus&nbsp;Layamon’s table can seat an indefinite number, and yet it can&nbsp;be carried by Arthur when he rides abroad. On closely examining Layamon’s version it seems probable that he had in&nbsp;his mind not merely a circular, but a turning table; he gives&nbsp;it as ground for the quarrel that all the knights wished to sit&nbsp;within; at the table the Cornish workman will make none&nbsp;shall be left without, but they shall sit “ without and within,&nbsp;man against man.” It is difficult to explain this phrasing in&nbsp;any other hypothesis than that Layamon pictured to himself&nbsp;Arthur’s hall as open on one side, and that, on a great feast-day,&nbsp;owing to the number of guests, the table extended beyond the&nbsp;covering afforded by the roof. As the feast took place “ on&nbsp;mid-winter’s day ” the annoyance of those who were without&nbsp;would be intelligible. To obviate this the cunning workman&nbsp;devised a circular table, turning on a pivot, with seats affixed,&nbsp;at which the guests sat the one half in turn within, the other&nbsp;without, the hall “ man against man.” This would make the&nbsp;Round Table analogous to the turning castles which we frequently meet with in romances; and while explaining the&nbsp;peculiarities of Layamon’s text, would make it additionally&nbsp;probable that he was dealing with an earlier tradition of folklore character, a tradition which was probably also familiar&nbsp;to Wace, whose version, though much more condensed than&nbsp;Layamon’s, is yet in substantial harmony with this latter.&nbsp;This, too, is certain; the fight for precedence at Arthur’s&nbsp;board may be paralleled by accounts of precisely similar&nbsp;quarrels in early Irish literature, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> the famous tale of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fled&nbsp;Bricrend</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bricrin's Feast</span><span class="font1"> of the Ultonian cycle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recent grail researches have made it most probable that that mysterious talisman was originally the vessel of the ritual&nbsp;feast held in honour of a deity of vegetation,—Adonis, or&nbsp;another; if the Round Table also, as Dr Mott suggests, derives&nbsp;from a similar source, we have a link between these two notable features of Arthurian tradition, and an additional piece of&nbsp;evidence in support of the view that behind the Arthur of&nbsp;romance there lie not only memories of an historic British&nbsp;chieftain, but distinct traces of a mythological and beneficent&nbsp;hero. Incidentally also it would seem that those versions&nbsp;which connect the table more closely with Arthur are the more&nbsp;correct.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROUND TOWERS» A peculiar class of round tower exists throughout Ireland; about one hundred and twenty examples&nbsp;once existed; most of these are ruined, but eighteen or twenty&nbsp;are almost perfect. These towers were built either near or&nbsp;adjoining a church; they are of various dates, from perhaps&nbsp;the 8th to the 13th century; though varying in size and detail,&nbsp;they have many characteristics common to all. They are&nbsp;built with walls slightly battering inwards, so that the tower&nbsp;tapers towards the top. The lower part is formed of solid&nbsp;masonry, the one doorway being raised from 6 to 20 ft. above&nbsp;the ground, and so only accessible by means of a ladder. The&nbsp;towers within are divided into several storeys by two or more&nbsp;floors, usually of wood, but in some cases, as at Keneith, of&nbsp;stone slightly arched. The access from floor to floor was by&nbsp;ladders. The windows, which are always high up, are single&nbsp;lights, mostly arched or with a flat stone'lintel. In some&nbsp;of the oldest towers they have triangular tops, formed by two&nbsp;stones leaning together. One peculiarity of the door and&nbsp;window openings in the Irish round towers is that the jambs&nbsp;are frequently set sloping, so that the opening grows narrower&nbsp;towards the top, as in the temples of ancient Egypt. The&nbsp;later examples of these towers, dating from the 12th and 13th&nbsp;centuries, are often decorated with chevron, billet and other&nbsp;Norman enrichments round the jambs and arches. The roof&nbsp;is of stone, usually conical in shape, and some of the later&nbsp;towers are crowned by a circle of battlements. The height of&nbsp;the round towers varies from about 60 to 132 ft.; that at&nbsp;Kilcullen was the highest. The masonry differs according&nbsp;to its date,—the oldest examples being built of almost uncut&nbsp;rubble work, and the later ones of neatly jointed ashlar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Much has been written as to the use of these towers, and the most conflicting theories as to their origin have been propounded.&nbsp;It is fairly certain, however, that they were constructed by Christian&nbsp;builders, both from the fact that they always are. or once were near&nbsp;a church, and also because crosses and other Christian emblems frequently occur among, the sculptured decorations of their doors and&nbsp;windows. Their original purpose was probably for places of&nbsp;refuge, for which the solid base and the door high above the ground&nbsp;seem specially adapted. They may also have been watch-towers,&nbsp;and in later times often contained bells. Their circular form was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">C</span><span class="font1">robably for the sake.of strength, angles which could be attacked y a battering ram being thus avoided, and also because no quoins&nbsp;ordressed stones were needed,except for the openings—an important&nbsp;point at a time when tools for working stone were scarce and&nbsp;imperfect. Both these reasons may also account for the Norman&nbsp;round towers which are so common at the west end of churches in&nbsp;Norfolk, Suffolk and Essex, though these have little resemblance&nbsp;to those of Ireland except in the use of a circular plan. One example&nbsp;exactly like those of Ireland exists in the Isle of Man, within the&nbsp;precincts of Peel Castle adjacent to the cathedral of St German;&nbsp;it was probably the work of Irish builders. There are also three&nbsp;in Scotland, viz. at Egilshay in Orkney, and at Abemethy and&nbsp;Brechin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Round towers wider and lower in proportion than those of Ireland appear to have been built by many prehistoric&nbsp;races in different parts of Europe. The towers of this class&nbsp;in Scotland are called “ brochs they average about 50 ft.&nbsp;high and 30 ft. in internal diameter. Their walls, which are&nbsp;usually about 15 ft. thick at the bottom, are built hollow,&nbsp;of rubble masonry, with series of passages one over the other&nbsp;running all round the tower. As in the Irish towers, the&nbsp;entrance is placed at some distance from the ground; and the&nbsp;whole structure is designed as a stronghold. The brochs</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
