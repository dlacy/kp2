<p><span class="font2">and the more austere; the later work, irrespective of its subject, the freer and broader. But even in that which is quite early&nbsp;there is a curious and impressive intensity of conception and&nbsp;presentation. His visions of elderly women and young girls&nbsp;remain upon the memory. His women, wrinkled and worn,&nbsp;have had the experience of a hard and grinding world; his&nbsp;children, his young girls, are the quintessence of innocence&nbsp;and happy hopefulness, and life is a jest to his boys. His&nbsp;religious pieces, in which Ribera affected him, have conviction&nbsp;and force. Into portraits and into character studies, but more&nbsp;especially into </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">genre</span><span class="font2"> subjects, Ribot was apt to introduce&nbsp;Still-life, and to make much of it. Herein, as in his sense of&nbsp;homeliness, he resembled Chardin. But again, Chardin-like,&nbsp;he painted Still-life for its own sake, by itself, and always with&nbsp;an extraordinary sense of the solidity and form, the texture&nbsp;and the hue, and, it must be added also, the very charm of&nbsp;matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(F. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">We.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIBOT, THÉ0DULE ARMAND (1839-1903), French psychologist, was born at Guingamp on the 18th of December 1839, and was educated at the Lycée de St Brieuc. In 1856 he began&nbsp;to teach, and was admitted to the École Normale Supérieure&nbsp;in 1862. In 1885 he gave a course of lectures on “ Experimental Psychology ” at the Sorbonne, and in 1888 was appointed professor of that subject at the College of France.&nbsp;His thesis for his doctor’s degree, republished in 1882, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hérédité:&nbsp;étude psychologique</span><span class="font2"> (5th ed., 1889), is his most important and.&nbsp;best known book. Following the experimental and synthetic&nbsp;methods, he has brought together a large number of instances&nbsp;of inherited peculiarities; he pays particular attention to the&nbsp;physical element of mental life, ignoring all spiritual or nonmaterial factors in man. In his work on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Psychologie&nbsp;anglaise contemporaine</span><span class="font2"> (1870), he shows his sympathy with the&nbsp;sensationalist school, and again in his translation of Herbert&nbsp;Spencer’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Principles of Psychology.</span><span class="font2"> Besides numerous articles,&nbsp;he has written on Schopenhauer, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophie de Schopenhauer&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1874; 7th ed., 1896), and on the contemporary psychology&nbsp;of Germany </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{La Psychologie allemande contemporaine,</span><span class="font2"> 1879;&nbsp;13th ed., 1898), also four little monographs on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Les Maladies&nbsp;de la mémoire</span><span class="font2"> (1881; 13th ed., 1898); </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De la volonté</span><span class="font2"> (1883;&nbsp;14th ed., 1899); </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De la personnalité</span><span class="font2"> (1885; 8th ed., 1899);&nbsp;and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Psychologie de Fattention</span><span class="font2"> (1888), which supply useful&nbsp;data to the student of mental disease.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RICARD, LOUIS GUSTAVE (1823-1873), French painter, was born in Marseilles in 1823, and studied first under Auber&nbsp;in his native towm, and subsequently under Coignet in Paris.&nbsp;The formation of his masterly, distinguished style in portraiture&nbsp;was, however, due rather to ten years’ intelligent copying of&nbsp;the old masters at the Louvre and at the Italian galleries,&nbsp;than to any school training. He was a master of technique,&nbsp;and his portraits—about two hundred—reveal an extraordinary insight into the character of his sitters. Nevertheless, for some time after his death his name was almost&nbsp;forgotten by the public, and it is only of quite recent years&nbsp;that he hafc been conceded the position among the leading&nbsp;masters of the modern French school which is his due. A&nbsp;portrait of himself, and one of Alfred de Musset, are at the&nbsp;Luxembourg Gallery. Among his best known works are the&nbsp;portrait of his mother, and those of the painters Fromentin,&nbsp;Heilbuth and Chaplin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">See </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gustave Ricard,</span><span class="font1"> by Camille Mauclair (Paris, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Librairie de Fart).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RICARDO, DAVID (1772-1823), English economist, was born in London on the 19th of April 1772, of Jewish origin. His&nbsp;father, who was of Dutch birth, bore an honourable character&nbsp;and was a successful member of the Stock Exchange. At the&nbsp;age of fourteen Ricardo entered his father’s office, where he&nbsp;showed much aptitude for business/ About the time when&nbsp;he attained his majority he abandoned the Hebrew faith&nbsp;and conformed to the Anglican Church, a change which seems&nbsp;to have been connected with his marriage to Miss Wilkinson,&nbsp;which took place in 1793. In consequence of the step thus&nbsp;taken he was separated from his family and thrown on his&nbsp;own resources. His ability and uprightness were known, and&nbsp;he at once entered on such a successful career in the profession to which he had been brought up that at the age of&nbsp;twenty-five, we are told, he was already rich. He now began to&nbsp;occupy himself with scientific pursuits, and gave some attention to mathematics as well as to chemistry and mineralogy;&nbsp;but, having met with Adam Smith’s great work, he ■ threw&nbsp;himself writh ardour into the study of political economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His first publication (1809) was </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The High Price of Bullion a Proof of the Depreciation of Bank Notes.</span><span class="font2"> This tract was an&nbsp;expansion of a series of articles which the author had contributed to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Chronicle.</span><span class="font2"> It gave a fresh stimulus&nbsp;to the controversy, which had for some time been discontinued,&nbsp;respecting the resumption of cash payments, and indirectly&nbsp;led to the appointment of a committee of the House of&nbsp;Commons, commonly known as the Bullion Committee, to&nbsp;consider the whole question. The report of the committee&nbsp;asserted the same views which Ricardo had put forward, and&nbsp;recommended the repeal of the Bank Restriction Act. Notwithstanding this, the House of Commons declared in the&nbsp;teeth of the facts that paper had undergone no depreciation.&nbsp;Ricardo’s first tract, as well as another on the same subject,&nbsp;attracted much attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1811 he made the acquaintance of James Mill, whose introduction to him arose out of the publication of Mill’s tract&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Commerce Defended.</span><span class="font2"> Whilst Mill doubtless largely&nbsp;affected his political ideas, he was, on his side, under obligations&nbsp;to Ricardo in the purely economic field; Mill said in 1823&nbsp;that he himself and J. R. M<sup>i</sup>Culloch were Ricardo’s disciples,&nbsp;and, he added, his only genuine ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1815, when the Corn Laws were under discussion, he published his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essay on the Influence of a Low Price of Corn on&nbsp;the Profits of Stock.</span><span class="font2"> This was directed against a recent tract&nbsp;by Malthus entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grounds of an Opinion on the Policy&nbsp;of Restraining the Free Importation of Foreign Corn.</span><span class="font2"> The&nbsp;reasonings .of the essay are based on the theory of rent which&nbsp;has often been called by the name of Ricardo; but the author&nbsp;distinctly states that it was not due to him. “ In all that&nbsp;I have said concerning the origin and progress of rent I have&nbsp;briefly repeated, and endeavoured to elucidate, the principles&nbsp;which Malthus has so ably laid down on the same subject in&nbsp;his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry into the Nature and Progress of RentP</span><span class="font2"> We now&nbsp;know that the theory had been fully stated, before the time&nbsp;of Malthus, by Anderson; it is in any case clear that it was&nbsp;no discovery of Ricardo. ARicardo states in this essay a set of&nbsp;propositions, most of them deductions from the theory of rent,&nbsp;which are in substance the same as those afterwards embodied&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Principles,</span><span class="font2"> and regarded as characteristic of his system,&nbsp;such as that increase of wages does not raise prices; that&nbsp;profits can be raised only by a fall in wages and diminished&nbsp;only by a rise in wages; and that profits, in the whole progress&nbsp;of society, are determined by the cost of the production of&nbsp;the food which is raised at the greatest expense. It does not&nbsp;appear that, excepting the theory of foreign trade, anything&nbsp;of the nature of fundamental doctrine, as distinct from the&nbsp;special subjects of banking and taxation, is laid down in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Principles</span><span class="font2"> which does not already appear in this tract. We&nbsp;find in it, too, the same exclusive regard to the interest of the&nbsp;capitalist class, and the same identification of their interest&nbsp;with that of the whole nation, which are generally characteristic&nbsp;of his writings.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
