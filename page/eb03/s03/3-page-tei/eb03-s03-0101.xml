Over one is the following inſcription : ‘ This ſtation conſiſts of 1087 ſteps. Here the bleſſed Redeemer fell a ſecond time under the weight of his croſs, and here is to be gained the indulgence of ſeven years and forty quarantines. Mentel prayer, the Paternoſter, and the Ave Maria.’ This may ſerve as an example for the rest.”</p><p>The principal manufacture of Seville is ſnuff. Mr Townſend, who paid particular attention to it, informs us, that the building in which it is carried on is elegant and ſimple in its form, and is about 600 feet by 480, and not leſs than 60 feet in height, with four regular fronts, incloſing 28 quadrangles. It coſt 37,000,000 of reals, or about T. 370,000. At preſent ( 1787), no more than 1700 workmen are employed, and 100 horſes or mules; but formerly 3000 men were engaged, and near 400 horſes. This falling off is attributed by Mr Swinburne to a practice which the directors followed, of adulterating the tobacco with the red earth of Almazarron. When Mr Townſend viſited this manufacture, they had changed their ſyſtem. From the year 1780, he informs us, the annual ſale of tobacco from Brazil has been 1,500,000 pounds, purchaſed ſrom the Portugueſe at three reals a pound ; and of ſnuff from the produce of their own colonies 1,600,000 pounds, beſide <hi rend="italic">cigars @@</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> to a very conſiderable amount. They have lying by them more than 5,000,000 of pounds of ſnuff unfold ; but as it will not ſuffer by age, they are not uneasy at this accumulation. Beſides the peculiar kind of ſnuff with which Spain was accustomed to ſupply the market, they have lately introduced the manufacture of rappee. In this branch alone are employed 220 perſons, old and young, with 16 mules.</p><p>“ All the workmen (continues Mr Townſend) depoſit their cloaks at the door ; and when they go out are ſo ſtrictly examined, that they have little chance of being able to conceal tobacco ; yet they ſometimes venture to hide it about their perſons. An officer and a guard is always attending to take delinquents into cuſtody ; and that they may prevent reſiſtance, no workman is permitted to enter with a knife. Were it not for this precaution, the conſequence of a detection might be fatal. The whole buſineſs is conducted by a director, with a ſalary of 40,000 reals a-year, and 54 ſuperior officers, aſſiſted by as many ſubordinate to them. For grinding their ſnuff, they have 40 mills, each conſiſting of a ſtone roller, moved by a large horſe or mule, with the traces faſtened to a beam of eight feet in length, in the angle of 45 degrees, consequently loſing preciſely half his force. ”</p><p>Before Mr Townſend left Seville, according to his uſual practice, which was truly laudable, he enquired into the prices of labour and proviſions.
