This complaint is very energetically advanced in a Dissertation concerning the present State of the High Roads of England, especially of those near London, wherein is proposed a new Method of Repairing and Maintaining them ; read before the Royal Society in the winter of 1736-37, by Robert Phillips, and printed in a small separate volume. The author’s great object is to recommend washing the roads by a constant stream, if possible, and at any rate, washing the materials of which they are composed. In this respect, notwithstanding the existence of single roads so situated that the effects of water upon them have been very beneficially introduced, his plans for the universal employment of water have been altogether superseded by later experience ; but he remonstrates, with great propriety, against the practice, which has, however, continued to prevail so generally even of late years, of laying down large heaps of unprepared gravel, to be gradually consolidated into a harder mass, at the expense of the intolerable labour of the poor animals that are obliged to grind it down. As an illustration of the good effect of water, he mentions that even the sediment deposited by it at the bottom of Fleetditch, which was supposed to be a soft mud, and to require removal when the ditch was filled up, proved in fact to be a hard gravelly substance, which afterwards afforded an excellent foundation for the roads and buildings supported by it.</p><p>The attention of the public has been more lately directed to the subject of roads and carriages, by several essays which appeared in the Communications to the Board of Agriculture ; they principally belong to the names of Beatson, Wright, Jessop, Hall, Wilkes, Erskine, Ellis, Cumming, Whetley, Amos, and Booth : the most remarkable are Mr Wilkes’s Remarks on the Advantages of Concave Roads ; Mr Ellis’s on Washing Roads ; Mr Wilkes’s on Railways ; and Mr Cumming’s on Wheel-Carriages ; showing particularly the disadvantage of broad conical wheels, and the historical progress of the practice of bending the line of the axes.</p><p>But all these improvements, whether real or imaginary, have since been in a great measure superseded by the ingenuity and success of Mr Loudon Macadam, a gentleman whose practice is in general principally to be applauded for its obvious simplicity and economy, though he has also had the merit of discovering that the simplest and cheapest methods, in particular cases, especially in that of boggy soils, are also the most scientific and the most effectual. The practical observations, which are to be here inserted, cannot therefore be so well cxpressed in any other form, as in that of an abstract of Mr Macadam’s own directions.</p><p>Mr Macadam’s leading principles are (Remarks, p. 37), “ that a road ought to be considered as an artificial flooring, forming a strong, smooth, solid surface, at once capable of carrying great weights, and over which carriages may pass without meeting any impediment.”</p><p>He proceeds to give directions for repairing an old road and for making a new one, in the form of a communication to a committee appointed by the House of Commons, in the year 1819, with some subsequent corrections.</p><p>No additional materials, he observes, are to be brought upon a road, unless in any part of it there be not a quantity of clean stone equal to ten inches in thickness.</p><p>The stone already in the road, supposing it to have been made in the usual manner, is to be loosened, and broken so that no piece may exceed six ounces in weight ; the road is then to be laid as flat as possible, leaving only a fall of three inches from the middle to the sides when the road is thirty feet wide. The stones, thus loosened, are to be dragged to the side by a strong heavy rake, with teeth two</p><lb/><p>inches and a half in length, and there broken ; but the stones are never to be broken on the road itself.</p><p>When the great stones have been removed, and none are left exceeding six ounces in weight, the surface is to be made smooth by a rake, which will also settle the remaining materials into a better consistence, bringing up the stone, and letting the dirt fall down into its place.</p><p>The road being so prepared, the stone that has been broken by the side is then to be carefully spread over it : this operation reqιdres very particular attention, and the future quality of the road will greatly depend on the manner in which it is performed ; the stone must not be laid on in shovels-full, but scattered over the surface, one shovel-full following another, and being spread over a considerable space.</p><p>Only a small part of the length of the road should be <hi rend="italic">lifted</hi>  in this manner at once ; that is, about two or three yards ; five men in a gang should be employed to <hi rend="italic">lift</hi>  it all across, two continually digging up and raking off the large stones, and preparing the road for receiving them again, and the other three breaking them at the side of the road. It may, however, happen that the surveyor may see cause to distribute the labour in a proportion somewhat different.</p><p>The only proper method of breaking stones, in general, both for effect and for economy, is in a sitting posture. The stones are to be placed in small heaps, and women, boys, and old men past hard labour, may sit down and break them witn small hammers into pieces not exceeding <hi rend="italic">six ounces</hi>  in weight. When the heavy work of a quarry can be performed by men, and the lighter by their wives and children, the stone can be obtained by contract for two thirds of the former prices, although the stones were then left four times as large. It has also been recommended by Mr Macadam and others (p. 35), that the largest stone employed should not exceed the measure of an inch in its greatest dimensions, or, in other words, that it should be capable of being contained in a sphere of about an inch in diameter, which would seldom weigh more than a single ounce.</p><p>In some cases it would bc unprofitable to lift and relay a road, even if the materials should have been originally too large ; for example, the road betwixt Bath and Cirencester was made of large stones, but so friable, that in lifting they w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ould have fallen into sand ; in this case Mr Macadam merely had the higher parts cut down, and replaced when sifted (p. 107), and the surface kept smooth, until those materials were gradually worn out ; and they were afterwards replaced by stone of a better quality, properly prepared. At Egham it was necessary to remove the whole road, in order to separate the small portion of valuable ma-tcrials from the mass of soft matter in which they were enveloped, and which was carried away, at a considerable expense, before a good road could be made. But although freestone is by no means calculated to make a durable road, yet by judicious management it may be made to form a very good road as long as it lasts. (P. 103.)</p><p>Whenever new stone is to be laid on a road already consolidated, the hardened surface is to be loosened with a pick, in order to enable the fresh materials to unite with the old.</p><p>A new road, however well it may have been made, will always receive the impressions of the carriage-wheels until it is hardened ; a careful person must, therefore, attend the road for some time, in order to rake in the tracks made by the wheels ; that is, as long as any loose materials are left that can be so employed.</p><p>It is always superfluous, and generally injurious, to add to the broken stone any mixture of earth, clay, chalk, or any other matter that will imbibe water and be affected by frost, or to lay any thing whatever on the clean stone for the</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
