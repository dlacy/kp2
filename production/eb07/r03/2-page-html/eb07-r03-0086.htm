<p><span class="font1">an important reform could not be completely carried into effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Asiatic Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Russia in Asia comprehends the whole northern portion of it, extending from latitude 38° 40' to 78° north, and&nbsp;from longitude 37° 14 to 190° 22' east from Greenwich.&nbsp;It is bounded on the west by European Russia and the&nbsp;Black Sea; on the south by Asiatic Turkey, Persia, the&nbsp;Caspian and Aral Seas, the territories of the Turkomans&nbsp;and Kirghises, @@<sup>1</sup> and China; on the east by the Pacific Ocean&nbsp;and Behring’s Straits; and the Frozen Ocean extends along&nbsp;the whole of its northern limits. Its greatest extent from&nbsp;west to east is about 4142 miles, and its greatest breadth&nbsp;from north to south is about 1933 miles. This vast dominion is calculated to be spread over twenty-seven ninetieths&nbsp;of the land of the globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Ural Mountains, already described, run along the western limits of Asiatic Russia. On the south-west extends the Caucasus, and on the west the Altai range. The&nbsp;eastern division of the Russian territory, from the river&nbsp;Yenisei or Ienessi, has on its southern and eastern parts&nbsp;vast mountain ranges; and on its interior there are several&nbsp;chains that run to the Arctic Ocean in gigantic masses. This&nbsp;portion of Siberia is covered with woods, large lakes, or extensive and elevated plains, and terminates towards the&nbsp;shores of the Frozen Ocean, in vast fields of eternal ice.&nbsp;The western division, with the exception of the mountain&nbsp;ranges mentioned, taken as a whole, may be described as a&nbsp;vast level plain, partially watered, but by its climate and&nbsp;soil ill adapted for the increase or the comfort of human&nbsp;beings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rivers of Asiatic Russia that empty themselves into the Arctic Sea are amongst the most considerable of the&nbsp;ancient world. The most remarkable of these are, 1st, the&nbsp;Obe, whose course is 2170 miles in length, during which it&nbsp;receives the great rivers the Tom, the Kek, the Irtysli, the&nbsp;Tyda, and all their tributary streams. 2d, The Yenisei,&nbsp;which has a course of 3115 miles, with fewer sinuosities&nbsp;than are usually observed in other great rivers. It receives&nbsp;the waters of fourteen large streams, and all their tributary&nbsp;collections. 3d, The Piasana, whose course is 300 miles.&nbsp;4th, The Taimurskoe, a short stream issuing from a lake of&nbsp;the same name. 5th, The Khatanga, which empties itself&nbsp;into the Bay of Khatangaskoi, on the Frozen Ocean. 6th,&nbsp;The Anabara, an arctic stream. 7th, The Olenk, whose&nbsp;waters only become considerable after entering the arctic&nbsp;circle. 8th, The Lena, one of the largest of the Asiatic&nbsp;Russian rivers. It rises in the Baikal Mountains, to the&nbsp;north of China, in latitude 52° 30', and empties itself into the ocean in latitude 70° 40', and longitude 164° 26',&nbsp;after receiving the waters of fourteen large rivers and their&nbsp;numerous tributary streams. 9th, The Omoloi; 10th, the&nbsp;Jana; 11th, the Indigirka; 12th, the Alazeja; 13th, the&nbsp;Kolyma; 14th, the Tchauna; and, 15th, the Amgonia. The&nbsp;streams whose courses have been traced to fall into the sea&nbsp;of Kamtschatka, between Asia and America, are the Anadyr, the Katirka, the Kamtschatka, the Penshena, the Tilcha,&nbsp;the Ischiga, the Tauna, the Okhota, the Uda, the Argun,&nbsp;and the Shilka. The rivers which descend from the Asiatic side into the Black Sea and Caspian have already been&nbsp;noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The lakes in Russian Asia are very numerous, and some of them very extensive. One of the largest is the Baikal, in&nbsp;Siberia, between latitude 52° and 55°, and longitude 104°&nbsp;26' and 109° 56', extending over 11,180 square miles. Its</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">water is clear and bright, and the depth varies from eighteen to five hundred feet. It is covered with ice from the middle of December till April. The river Angara, which runs&nbsp;to the Yenisei, issues from it. It contains a great number&nbsp;of rocky islands, the largest of which is called Olchon. The&nbsp;lakes next in extent are the Tchani and the Piasenskoe,&nbsp;both in the government of Tomsk. Every province has&nbsp;one or more lakes, several of which are of salt water, and&nbsp;on whose banks a natural crystallization prepares culinary&nbsp;salt for the use of the inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are several plains or steppes of great extent in Asiatic Russia, the most remarkable being the Kirghis&nbsp;Steppe, between the Irtysh and Orenburg boundary line.&nbsp;It is a very dry and barren district, with some lakes whose&nbsp;water is saline. The few rivers have copious streams in&nbsp;the spring from the melted snows, but in summer become&nbsp;dried up. There is also the Steppe of Bolschei; of Jettish,&nbsp;to the eastward of the Ural; of Ischim, on both sides of the&nbsp;river of that name, between Tobol and the Irtysh; and the&nbsp;Baraba or Barbinska, between the Irtysh and the Ob or&nbsp;Obe. It is about two hundred miles in breadth, and its&nbsp;surface is by no means dry and arid, as is commonly thought,&nbsp;but, on the contrary, rather suffers from an abundance of&nbsp;water, being chiefly covered with large and small lakes and&nbsp;extensive swamps, and also traversed by several small rivers,&nbsp;which partly fall into the Om, an eastern tributary of the&nbsp;Irtysh, and partly into the Irtysh and Obe. Some portions&nbsp;of it present a perfect level, like the ocean in a calm;&nbsp;others are slightly undulating, and covered with grass, some&nbsp;birch, and poplar. Some lakes are salt, and occasionally&nbsp;the surface of the ground is covered with saline efflorescence. In this steppe a peculiar disease is prevalent, called&nbsp;the Siberian plague. To these may be added the Arctic&nbsp;Plain, between the 67th degree of latitude and the Frozen&nbsp;Ocean, whose whole surface is little more than morasses,&nbsp;mixed with rocks, and bound up by frost between ten and&nbsp;eleven months in the year. These extensive plains are&nbsp;sometimes passed by the wandering tribes, who find subsistence on the less sterile spots which are to be met with&nbsp;on the banks of the rivers that bound them. The southern districts, however, possess a great deal of land equally&nbsp;adapted for tillage and for pasture. The forests abound&nbsp;with game; and the rivers are well stocked with fish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The climate differs little from that of European Russia. The principal productions are wheat, rye, barley, oats, and&nbsp;buck-wheat, which grows wild in the middle of Siberia.&nbsp;The return is small, but the crops have increased with the&nbsp;introduction of more improved methods of cultivating the&nbsp;soil. The southern territory along the upper part of the&nbsp;Irtysh, as well as along the Tobol, the Izet, and others of&nbsp;its tributaries, which are covered with luxuriant pastures,&nbsp;might be made to yield very rich crops, if the inhabitants&nbsp;would change their taste for a pastoral life, and till the&nbsp;ground. For some time past indeed the Kirghises have&nbsp;shown indications of commencing agriculture, especially the&nbsp;poorer classes, who cultivate, upon the borders of the lakes&nbsp;and rivers, fields of corn, rye, barley, and millet. But notwithstanding the general neglect of agriculture, the produce is in some parts extremely plentiful. Immense crops&nbsp;are raised without the aid of manure, so that living is very&nbsp;cheap. In many parts the goats and sheep, and in some&nbsp;the oxen, furnish food for the inhabitants; whilst in others&nbsp;they derive subsistence from the fish with which the seas,&nbsp;lakes, and rivers abound. The rearing of sheep for wool&nbsp;is a branch of industry lately introduced into Siberia, and&nbsp;is likely to thrive.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@1 This part of the Russian frontier, known by the name of “ the line of the Cossacks of Siberia,” traverses the extensive plains which separate Ural from Altai. The direction of this line, from the redoubts of Siberia to the village of Finalka, situated at the foot of the&nbsp;Altai, is in length 1707 versts, and is marked by four towns, eleven fortresses, fifteen fortified advanced costs, and eiglity-four redoubts.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
