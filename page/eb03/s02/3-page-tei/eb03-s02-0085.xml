            <p>ſelves in behalf of the queen of Scotland; and, in 1574, the misfortunes of his royal
                miſtrels were farther aggravated by the death of Charles IX. of France, and her
                uncle the cardinal of Lorraine. The regent, in the mean time, ruled with the moſt
                despotic ſway. He twice coined baſe money in the name of his ſovereign; and after
                putting it into circulation the ſecond time, he iſſued orders for its paſſing only
                for its intrinſic value. The duke of Chatelherault happening to die this year, the
                regent took every method of ruining all thoſe of his name and family. He committed
                to priſon all the Hamiltons, and every perſon of diſtinction who had fought for the
                queen at the battle of Langſide, and compelled them to buy their liberty at an
                exorbitant price. He inſtigated Douglas of Lochleven to aſſaſſinate lord Arbroath,
                and it was with difficulty that the latter eſcaped the ambuſh that was laid for him.
                Reid, the biſhop of Orkney, having left his eſtate to pious and charitable uſes, the
                regent prohibited the execution of the will, and took upon himſelf the
                adminiſtration. To be rich was a ſufficient crime to excite his vengeance. He
                entered the warehouſes of merchants, and confiſcated their property; and if he
                wanted a pretence to juſtify his conduct, the judges and lawyers were ready at his
                call.</p>
            <p>In this diſaſtrous period the clergy augmented the general confuſion. Mr Andrew
                Melvil had lately returned from Geneva; and the diſcipline of its aſſembly being
                conſideredby him as the moſt perfect model of eccleſiaſtical policy, he was
                infinitely offended with the introduction of Epiſcopacy into Scotland. His learning
                was conſiderable, and his ſkill in languages was profound. He was fond of
                diſputation, hot, violent, and pertinacious. The Scottiſh clergy were in a humour to
                attend to him; and his merit was ſufficient to excite their admiration. Inſtigated
                by his practices, John Drury, one of the miniſters of Edinburgh, called in queſtion,
                in a general aſſembly, the lawfulneſs of the biſhops, and the authority of chapters
                in electing them. Melvil, after commending his zeal and his motion, declaimed
                concerning the flouriſhing ſtate of the eſtabliſhment of Geneva; and having recited
                the opinions of Calvin and Beza upon eccleſiaſtical government, maintained, that
                there ſhould be no office-bearers in the church whoſe titles were not ſeen in the
                book of God. He affirmed, that the term <hi rend="italic">bishoρ</hi> was nowhere to
                be found in it in the ſenſe in which it was commonly underſtood, as Chriſt allowed
                not any ſuperiority among miniſters. He contended that Chriſt was the only lord of
                his church, and that the miniſters of the word were all equal in degree and power.
                He urged, that the eſtate of the biſhops, beſide being unlawful, had grown unſeemly
                with corruptions; and that if they were not removed out of the church, it would fall
                into decay, and endanger the intereſts of religion. His ſentiments were received
                with flattering approbation; and though the archbiſhop of Glaſgow, with the biſhops
                of Dunkeld, Galloway, Brechin, Dumblain, and the Iſles, were preſent in this
                aſſembly, they ventured not to defend their vocation. It was reſolved, that the name
                of</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">biſhop</hi> conferred no diſtinction or rank; that the office was
                not more honourable than that of the other miniſters; and that by the word of God
                their functions conſiſted in preaching, in adminiſtering the ſacraments, and in
                exerciſing eccleſiaſtical diſcipline with the conſent of the elders. The Epiſcopal
                eſtate, in the meanwhile, was watched with anxious obſervation; and the faults and
                demerits of every kind, which were found in individuals, were charged upon the order
                with rudeneſs and aſperity. In a new aſſembly this ſubject was again canvaſſed. It
                was moved, whether biſhops, as conſtituted in Scotland, had any authority tor their
                functions from the Scriptures? After long debates, it was thought prudent to avoid
                an explicit determination of this important queſtion. But a confirmation was
                bellowed upon the reſolution of the former aſſembly; and it was eſtabliſhed as a
                rule, that every biſhop ſhould make choice of a particular church within his
                dioceſe, and ſhould actually diſcharge the duties of a miniſter.</p>
            <p>The regent, diſturbed with theſe proceedings of the brethren, was diſpoſed to amuſe
                and to deceive them. He ſent a meſſenger to adviſe them not to infringe and
                disfigure the eſtabliſhed forms; and to admoniſh them, that if their averſion from
                Epiſcopacy was inſurmountable, it would become them to think of ſome mode of
                eccleſiaſtical government to which they could adhere with conſtancy. The aſſembly
                taking the advantage of this meſſage, made a formal intimation to him, that they
                would diligently frame a laſting platform of polity, and ſubmit it to the
                privy-council. They appointed, accordingly, a committee of the brethren for this
                purpoſe. The buſineſs was too agreeable to be neglected; and in a ſhort time Mr
                David Lindſay, Mr James Lawſon, and Mr Robert Pont, were deputed to wait upon the
                regent with a new ſcheme of eccleſiaſtical government. After reminding him, that he
                had been a notable infiniment in purging the realm of Popery, and begging that he
                would conſnlt with them upon any of its articles which he thought improper or
                incomplete, they informed him, that they did not account it to be a perfect work to
                which nothing could be added, or from which nothing could be taken away; for that
                they would alter and improve it, as the Almighty God might farther reveal his will
                unto them. The regent, taking from them their ſchedule, replied, that he would
                appoint certain perſons of the privy-council to confer with them. A conference was
                even begun upon the ſubject of their new eſtabliſhment; but from his arts, or from
                the troubles of the times, no advances were made in it.</p>
            <p>This year the earl of Bothwel died in Denmark; and in his laſt moments, being ſtung
                with remorſe, he confeſſed that he had been guilty of the king’s murder, revealed
                the names of the perſons who were his accomplices, and with the moſt ſolemn
                proteſtations declared the honour and innocence of the queen. His confeſſion was
                tranſmitted to Elizabeth by the king of Denmark; but was ſuppreſſed by her with an
                anxious ſolicitude.@@</p>
            <p>The regent ſtill continued his enormities, till having</p>
            <p>@@@ (U) Jebb, Vol. II. p. 227. It has never been publiſhed. Keith and other
                hiſtorians have preſerved what they call <hi rend="italic">the earl of Bothwel's
                    declaration at his death,</hi> and account it to be genuine. Their partiality
                for Mary induced them the more eaſily to fall into this miſtake. The paper they give
                is demonſtratively a forgery; and the want of the real confeſſion, of Rothwel is
                ſtill a deficiency in our hiſtory.</p>
