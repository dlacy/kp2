an Athenian philoſopher, the nephew and ſucceſſor of Plato. Contrary to the practice of Plato, Speuſippus required from his pupils a ſtated gratuity. He placed ſtatues of the graces in the ſchool which Plato had built. On account of his infirm ſtate of health, he was commonly carried to and from the academy in a vehicle. On his way thither he one day met Diogenes, and ſaluted him ; the surly philoſopher refuſed to return the ſalute, and told him, that such a feeble wretch ought to be aſhamed to live ; to which Speuſippus replied, that he lived not in his limbs, but in his mind. At length, being wholly incapacitated, by a paralytic ſtroke, for the duties of the chair, he reſigned it to Xenocrates. He is ſaid to have been of a violent temper, fond of pleasure, and exceedingly avaricious. Speuſippus wrote many philoſophical works, which are now lost, but which Ariſtotle thought sufficiently valuable to purchaſe at the expence of three talents. From the few fragments which remain of his philoſophy, it appears that he adhered very ſtrictly to the doctrine of his maſter.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
