a blue transparent variety of corundum or native alumina. It differs, therefore, from the Oriental ruby mainly in its colour. The colour varies from the palest blue to deep indigo, the most esteemed tint being that of the blue cornflower. It often happens that a crystal of sapphire is particoloured, and hence a fine cut stone may derive its tint from a deep-coloured portion at the back, instead of being uniformly tinted throughout. The sapphire is dichroic, and the colour of a fine velvety stone may be resolved by means of the dichroiscope into an ultramarine blue and a yellowish-green. The origin of the blue colour of the sapphire has not been satisfactorily determined, for, although oxide of cobalt may produce it, and is invariably used for colouring imitations of the stone, yet the presence of cobalt is not always revealed in the analysis of the sapphire. According to lapidaries the hardness of the sapphire slightly exceeds that of the ruby, and it is therefore the hardest known mineral, excepting diamond. In consequence of its great hardness it was generally mounted by the ancients in a partially rough state, the surface being polished but not cut. Notwithstanding its hardness it has been occasionally engraved as a gem. There seems no doubt that the ancient σάπϕειρος <hi rend="italic">,</hi> as well as the sapphire ( םם׳ך) of the Old Testament (Job xxviii. 6), was our lapis lazuli, while the modern sapphire seems to have been known under the name of ύάκινϴος or <hi rend="italic">hyacinihus</hi> (King).</p><p>The finest sapphires are obtained from Ceylon, where they occur with other gem stones as pebbles or rolled crystals in the sands of rivers. The sapphires have generally preserved their crystalline form better than the associated rubies. Some of the slightly-cloudy Ceylon sapphires display when cut <hi rend="italic">en caboehan</hi> an opalescent star of six rays, whence they are called <hi rend="italic">star-sapphires</hi> or <hi rend="italic">asterias.</hi> The principal localities in Ceylon yielding sapphires are Rakewana, Ratnapura, and Satawaka. A few years ago sapphires were discovered in Siam (in the province of Battambong), but the stones from this locality are mostly dull and of too dark a colour. In Burmah they occur in association with rubies, but are much less numerous. They have also been recently found in Paldar, north of the Chandrabagha range. The sapphire is widely distributed through the gold-bearing drifts of Victoria and New South Wales, but the colour of the stones is usually too dark. Some of the finest specimens have come from the Beechworth district in Victoria. Coarse sapphire is found in many parts of the United States, and a few stones fit for jewellery have been obtained from Corundum Hill, Macon county, North Carolina, and from the other localities mentioned under <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruby.</hi> The sapphire also occurs in Europe, being found in the basalts of the Rhine valley and of Le Puy in Velay, but not sufficiently fine for purposes of ornament. The sapphire has been artificially reproduced by similar methods to those described in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruby.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
