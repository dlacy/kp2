North and South, two ſea-port towns, the one north of the Tyne in Northumberland, the other on the ſouth of the Tyne in the county of Durham. South Shields contains above 200 ſalt-pans, and on both banks of the river are many convenient houſes for the entertainment of ſeamen and colliers, moſt of the Newcaſtle coal fleet having their ſtation here uſually till their coals are brought down in the barges and lighters from Newcaſtle. A very large Roman altar, of one entire ſtone, was found ſome years ago near this place, and put into the hands of the learned Dr Liſter, who, in his account of it ſent to the Royal Society, ſays it was erected to Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Caracalla, when he took upon him the command of the empire and the whole army (after his father’s death at York), for his ſafe return from his ſucceſsful expedition againſt the Scots and Picts. W. Long. 1. 12. N. Lat. 55. 44.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0372.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0366"/>
