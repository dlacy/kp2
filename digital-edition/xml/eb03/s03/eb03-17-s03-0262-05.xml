(fab. hiſt.), a celebrated queen of Aſſyria, daughter of the goddeſs Derceto, by a young Assyrian. She was expoſed in a deſert ; but her life was preſerved by doves for one whole year, till Simmas, one of the ſhepherds of Ninus, found her and brought her up as his own child. Semiramis, when grown up, married Menones, the governor of Nineveh, and accompanied him to the siege of Bactria ; where, by her advice and prudent directions, ſhe haſtened the king’s operations, and took the city. Theſe eminent ſervices, together with her uncommon beauty, endeared her to Ninus. The monarch aſked her of her huſband, and offered him his daughter Soſana in her ſtead; but Menones, who tenderly loved Semiramis, refused ; and when Ninus had added threats to entreaties, he hanged himſelf. No ſooner was Menones dead, than Semiramis, who was of an aſpiring ſoul, married Ninus, by whom ſhe had a son called <hi rend="italic">Pliny as.</hi> Ninus was ſo fond of Semiramis, that at her requeſt he reſigned the crown, and commanded her to be proclaimed queen and ſole empreſs of Aſſyria. Of this, however, he had cauſe to repent : Semiramis put him to death, the better to eſtabliſh herſelf on the throne ; and when ſhe had no enemies to fear at home, ſhe began to repair the capital of her empire, and by her means Babylon became the most ſuperb and magnificent city in the world. She viſited every part of her dominions, and left every where immortal monuments of her greatneſs and benevolence. To render the road paſſable and communication eaſy, ſhe hollowed mountains and filled up valleys, and water was conveyed at a great expence by large and convenient aqueducts to barren deſerts and unfruitful plains. She was not leſs diſtinguiſhed as a warrior: Many of the neighbouring nations were conquered ; and when Semiramis was once told as ſhe was dreſſing her hair, that Babylon had revolted, ſhe left her toilette with precipitation, and though only half dreſſed, ſhe refuſed to have the rest of her head adorned before the ſedition was quelled and tranquillity re-eſtabliſhed. Semiramis has been accuſed of licentiouſneſs ; and ſome authors have obſerved that ſhe regularly called the ſtrongeſt and ſtouteſt men in her army to her arms, and afterwards put them to death, that they might not be living witneſſes of her incontinence. Her paſſion for her ſon was alſo unnatural ; and it was this criminal propenſity which induced Ninyas to deſtroy his mother with his own hands. Some ſay that Semiramis was changed into a dove after death, and received immortal honours in Aſſyria. It is ſuppoſed that ſhe lived about 11 centuries before the Chriſtian era, and that ſhe died in the 62d year of her age and the 25th of her reign. Many fabulous reports have been propagated about Semiramis, and ſome have declared that for ſome time ſhe diſguiſed herſelf and pasſed for her ſon Ninyas. <hi rend="italic">Lempriere's Bibliotheca Claſfica.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
