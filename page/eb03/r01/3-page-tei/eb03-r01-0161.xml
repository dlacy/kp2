Yet the Chriſtians differ conſiderably with reſpect to the nature of the human ſoul. Some imagine, that this ſpirit is naturally mortal, and that it is propagated along with the Body from the loins of the parent. In ſupport of this opinion, it has been obſerved that a great number of infects and plants transfer their lives to their poſterity, and die foon after the act of propagation ; that after this act the vital principle is iu the moſt vigorous of plants and animals always found to be much exhauſted; and that Tertullian a father of the church, in attempt-ing ſome experiments of the kind, became fubject to a momentary blindneſs, and felt a portion of his ſoul <hi rend="italic">going</hi>  out of him (n).</p><p>Tlreſe imagine that immortality was only conditionally promifed to man ; that Adam forfeited this immortality by his diſobedience ; and that Chriſt has teſtored lis to the hopes of it again by his ſufferings and death : for as in Adam we have all died, ſo in Chriſt, they fay, we ſhall all be made alive,; and that now the ſting is taken ſrom death, and the victory over our ſouls from the grave.</p><p>others have conceived the human ſoul as naturally -immortal, and as ſetting death and the grave at defiance. Adam, they ſay, died only in a figure ; and only from the conſequences oſ this figure, which means</p><p>fin, has our Lord ſaved us. In this ſenfe Adam died on the very day in which he had fumed ; or he died literally in 1000 years, which with the Lord are as one day. To theſe arguments their opponents reply, what then is the victory* over death and the grave ? You muſt ſtill have recourfe to a new figure, and betake yourſelvefe to the ſecond death ; though, after all, where is your grave ? To this it is anſwered, that the ſoul of itſelf ⅛ naturally immortal, and that it depends not either for its exiftence or the exerciſe of its faculties upon the body ; that the properties of matter, as figure, magnitude, and motion, can produce nothing that is like to per-ception, memory, and conſciouſneſs. This is true, rejoin their opponents ; but beſides theſe few properties of matter, which are only the objects of that philoſophf which has lately and properly been termed <hi rend="italic">mechanical, </hi>the chemical philoſophy has diſcovered other properties of matter ; has found that matter is of various kinds ; that it very often does not act mechanically ; that it acquires many new properties by combination ; and that no man, till farther experiment and obſervation, ſhould venture to affert how far the ſoul is or is not dependent on its preſent orgahiſed ſyſtenl. The others, proceeding on their hypotheſis, maintain that the ſoul, as being immaterial, is not diviſible; and though the body of a frog may live without the head for a whole day ; though the body of a tortoife may live without the head for a whole month ; though a human limb may for ſome mi-nutes after amputation continue to perform a vital motion, independent of a brain, a ſtomach, or a heart ; and though the parts of a plant, a polype, or a worm, may ſurvive their ieparation and become living wholes*, yet the ſoul, they obferve, is not to be compared with the vital principles of plants and animals, nor ought to be divided on reafons ſo ſlender a8 thoſe of analogy. Even granting, they ſay, that the foul were not naturally immortal of itſelf ; yet the juſtice of God, which is not remarkable for its equal diſtribution of rewards and pnniſhments in the preſent world, is bound to make fome amends in the next. And to this again their opponents anſwer, as to the equal diſtribution of juſtice in a future world, of that we are affured on much bet</p><p>^cee paraphraſt of the Canticles, afferting that the prophet Solomon had ſaid, " when the dead (hall revive, it ihall come to paſs that the Mount of olives ſhall be cleft, and all the dead of Iſrael ſhall come out from thence; 'and the juſt too that died in captivity ſhall come through the way of the caverns under the earth, and ſhall come forth out of the Mount of olives.” He has likewife quoted Saunderſon’s voyage to the Holy Land, in which, we are told that many of the Jews, by their own account, are to riſe up in the valley of Jehoſaphet ; and that in the <hi rend="italic">row (ng</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">devolution</hi>  of the caverns, thoſe at a diſtance muſt ſcrape their wav thither with their nails.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(l)</hi>     The ſect of the Quakers explain it figuratively,</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(m)</hi>     The laſt quoted author* <hi rend="italic">(Reſurrection op the ſame Body, ajferted from the traditions of the Heathens, the ancient Jews, and the primitive Church}</hi>  has endeavoured to ſhow that this doctrine, in the fame fenſe as we -underſtand it, has been afferted by the ancient magi, and by the preſent heathen gaurs of Perfia, the relics of the ancient magi ; by ſome of the ancient Arabians ; by ſome of the banians of India ; by the preſent inhabitants of the iſland of Ceylon, of Java, of Pegu, of Tranſiana ; by ſome amongſt the Chineſe ; by the Arderians in Guinea ; and by the ancient Pruſſians. The proofs which he brings, it muſt be confeffed, are not however always very fatisfactory. It appears, even, from h∣s own account, that ſome of theſe had derived their notions frorh certain Chriftians, Mahometans, or Jews. But the reader may judge of the great accuracy of his 1dea3 from his bringing old Pythagoras and the Stoics, and even Democritus and Epicurus, in ſupport of the ſame or a £milar opinion.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(n)</hi>     In illo ipſo voluptatis ultima? æftu quo genitale virus expellitur, nonne aliquid de anima quoque ſentimui &lt;χire, at que adeo marceffimus-et devigeſcimus cunt lucis detrimcnto.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
