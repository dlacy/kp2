        <p><span class="font2">connected with Carthage by treaty, and the older purely commercial
                treaties had quite recently been replaced by a&nbsp;close alliance formed in face of
                the common danger to&nbsp;which both had been exposed by the adventurous
                schemes&nbsp;of Pyrrhus. But this danger was past, and it is probable that others
                besides Pyrrhus foresaw that on the old&nbsp;battleground of Greeks and Phoenicians
                a struggle must&nbsp;soon be fought out between the Phoenician mistress of
                the&nbsp;Italian seas and the rulers of the Italian peninsula.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">It was above all things essential for Rome that the Carthaginians
                should advance no farther eastward. But&nbsp;already in 272 Tarentum had almost
                fallen into their&nbsp;grasp, and seven years later Rome was threatened with&nbsp;a
                danger at least as serious, the establishment of Carthaginian rule in the east of
                Sicily, and within sight&nbsp;of the Italian coast. In 265 a body of
                Campanian&nbsp;mercenaries, who had seized Messana, found themselves&nbsp;hard
                pressed by Hiero, king of Syracuse. One party&nbsp;among them appealed for aid to
                Carthage. The Carthaginians readily responded, and a Carthaginian
                garrison&nbsp;occupied the citadel of Messana. But at Messana, as&nbsp;once at
                Tarentum, there were others who turned to Rome,&nbsp;and, as Italians themselves,
                implored the aid of the great&nbsp;Italian republic, offering in return to place
                Messana under&nbsp;the suzerainty of Rome. The request was a perplexing&nbsp;one.
                Both Hiero and the Carthaginians were allies of&nbsp;Rome, and Messana, if rescued
                from the latter, belonged&nbsp;of right to Hiero and not to Rome. Apart, too,
                from&nbsp;treaty obligations, the Roman senate naturally hesitated&nbsp;before
                acceding to an appeal which would precipitate a&nbsp;collision with Carthage, and
                commit Rome to a new and&nbsp;hazardous career of enterprise beyond the sea.
                Finally,&nbsp;however, all other considerations gave way before the&nbsp;paramount
                importance of checking the advance of Carthage.&nbsp;The Roman assembly voted that
                assistance should be sent&nbsp;to the Mamertines, and in 264 the Roman legions for
                the&nbsp;first time crossed the sea. Messana was occupied, and,&nbsp;after
                sustaining a defeat, the Carthaginians and Syracusans&nbsp;were forced to raise the
                siege and withdraw. The opening&nbsp;years of the war which was thus begun gave
                little promise&nbsp;of the length of the struggle, and it seemed likely at
                the&nbsp;outset that Rome’s immediate object, the expulsion of
                the&nbsp;Carthaginians from Sicily, would be soon attained. The&nbsp;accession to
                the Roman side of King Hiero (263) not only&nbsp;confirmed the position which Rome
                had already assumed&nbsp;in Italy of the champion of the western Greeks
                against&nbsp;barbarians, but provided her in eastern Sicily with a convenient base
                of operations and commodious winter quarters,&nbsp;and in Hiero himself with a loyal
                and effective ally. In&nbsp;the next year (262) followed the capture of
                Agrigentum,&nbsp;and in 261 the Roman senate resolved on supplementing&nbsp;these
                successes on land by the formation of a fleet which&nbsp;should not only enable them
                to attack the maritime&nbsp;strongholds which defied the assaults of their legions,
                and&nbsp;protect their own coasts, but even to carry the war into&nbsp;Africa
                itself. In the spring of 260 the first regular&nbsp;Roman fleet, consisting of one
                hundred quinqueremes and&nbsp;twenty triremes set sail;@@<sup>1</sup> and the
                brilliant naval victory off&nbsp;Mylæ, won by the consul C. Duilius in the same
                year,&nbsp;seemed to promise the Romans as much success by sea as&nbsp;they had won
                by land. But the promise was not fulfilled;&nbsp;and in 256 the senate, impatient of
                the slow progress&nbsp;made in Sicily, determined on boldly invading Africa.
                It&nbsp;was a policy for which, if Africa were once reached, the&nbsp;defenceless
                state of the Carthaginian territories, the doubtful loyalty of her Libyan subjects,
                and the Unwarlike&nbsp;habits of her own citizens, gave every hope of
                success,&nbsp;and, but for the blunders of the Romans themselves, it&nbsp;might have
                succeeded now as it did fifty years later. The</span></p>

        <p><span class="font2">passage to Africa was opened by the defeat of the Carthaginian fleet
                off Ecnomus; the two consuls, L. Manlius Vulso and M. Atilius Regulus, landed in
                safety and rapidly&nbsp;overran the country. But these successes led the
                senate,&nbsp;at the close of the summer, into committing the serious&nbsp;blunder of
                recalling one of the consuls, Manlius, with a&nbsp;large portion of the troops. It
                was one of many instances&nbsp;in which the rules and traditions of the old
                republican&nbsp;system proved themselves inconsistent with the new&nbsp;requirements
                of an extended warfare. The consul came&nbsp;back to hold the elections ; his
                soldiers returned, as the&nbsp;custom had been, to their homes after a summer’s
                campaign ; but the efficiency of the expedition was fatally&nbsp;impaired. The
                rashness and over-confidence of Regulus&nbsp;aggravated the effects of the senate’s
                action. Emboldened&nbsp;by further successes, and notwithstanding his
                diminished&nbsp;forces, he met the Carthaginian proposals for peace by&nbsp;terms so
                harsh that the latter, though the Romans were&nbsp;almost at their gates, their
                soldiers disheartened, and the&nbsp;nomad tribes swarming on their frontiers,
                indignantly&nbsp;broke off the negotiations and prepared to resist to the&nbsp;last.
                At this crisis, so the story runs, the arrival of&nbsp;Xanthippus, a Spartan soldier
                of fortune, changed the face&nbsp;of affairs, as that of Gylippus had formerly done
                at Syracuse.&nbsp;His superior military skill remedied the blunders of
                the&nbsp;Carthaginian generals ; confidence was restored ; and in&nbsp;255 he
                triumphantly routed the Roman forces a few </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">i&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">miles outside the city.
                Regulus was taken prisoner,@@<sup>2</sup> and&nbsp;only a miserable remnant of two
                thousand men escaped to&nbsp;the Roman camp on the coast. Here they were
                rescued&nbsp;by a Roman fleet, but their ill-fortune pursued them. On&nbsp;its way
                home the fleet was wrecked, and all but 80 vessels&nbsp;out of a total of 364 were
                lost.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Still, though abandoning all thoughts of invading Africa, the Romans
                were unwilling to renounce all thoughts of&nbsp;facing their enemy on the sea. But
                fresh disasters&nbsp;followed. The hopes raised (254) by the capture of
                £&nbsp;Panormus were dashed to the ground the next year (253) £&nbsp;by the total
                destruction in a storm of the victorious fleet&nbsp;on its way home from Panormus to
                Rome. Four years&nbsp;later a second fleet, despatched under P. Claudius
                to&nbsp;assist in the blockade of Lilybæum, was completely defeated&nbsp;off
                Drepana, while, to make matters worse, his colleague&nbsp;L. Junius, who had been
                hastily sent out with reinforcements, was wrecked near the dangerous promontory
                of&nbsp;Pachynus.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Disheartened by these repeated disasters, the senate resolved to
                trust only to the legions, and by sheer force of&nbsp;perseverance slowly to force
                the enemy out of the few&nbsp;positions to which he still clung in Sicily. But,
                though&nbsp;for five years (248-243) no fresh naval operations were
                £&nbsp;attempted, no compensating success by land followed.&nbsp;Hamilcar Barca, the
                new Carthaginian commander, not&nbsp;only ravaged with his fleet the coasts of
                Italy, but from&nbsp;his impregnable position at Ercte incessantly harassed&nbsp;the
                Roman troops in the west of the island, and even&nbsp;recaptured Eryx. Convinced
                once more of the impossibility of driving the Carthaginians out of Sicily as
                long&nbsp;as their navy swept the seas, the Romans determined on a&nbsp;final
                effort. The treasury was empty ; but by the liberal&nbsp;contributions of private
                citizens a fleet was equipped, and&nbsp;C. Lutatius Catulus, consul for 242, started
                for Sicily early 5&nbsp;in the summer of that year with 200 quinqueremes.&nbsp;From
                Drepana, whither he had gone to aid in the blockade,&nbsp;he sailed out to meet a
                Carthaginian fleet, despatched&nbsp;from Africa against him ; and a battle took
                place at the&nbsp;Ægates islands, some 20 miles from the Sicilian coast,
                in&nbsp;which Catulus completely defeated his enemy. The end</span></p>
