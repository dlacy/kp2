<p><span class="font0">army is not the most successful part of the fresco: the horses are very wooden in appearance, and the tight-fitting scale armour, put&nbsp;on in some impossible way without any joints, gives a very unreal&nbsp;and theatrical look to the picture. Part is the work of pupils.&nbsp;In 1514 he painted the “ Deliverance of St Peter from Prison,&quot; with&nbsp;a further political allusion (No. </span><span class="font1">9). </span><span class="font0">It is very skilfully arranged&nbsp;to fit in the awkward space round the window, and is remarkable&nbsp;for an attempt, not much suited for fresco-painting, to combine&nbsp;and contrast the three different qualities of light coming from the&nbsp;moon, the glory round the angd, and the torches of the sentinels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For room C Raphael designed and partly painted the “Incendio del Borgo” (No. 11), a fire in the Borgo or Leonine City, which was&nbsp;miraculously stopped by Leo IV. appearing and making the sign&nbsp;of the cross at a window in the Vatican. On the background is&nbsp;shown the façade of the old basilica of St Peter, not yet destroyed&nbsp;when this fresco was painted. One group on the left, in the foreground, is remarkable for its vigour and powerful drawing; the&nbsp;motive is taken from the burning of Troy; a fine nude figure of&nbsp;Æneas issues from the burning houses bearing on his back the old&nbsp;Anchises and leading the boy Ascanius by the hand. Some of the&nbsp;female figures arc designed with much grace and dramatic power.&nbsp;Many studies for this picture exist. This is the last of the stanze&nbsp;frescoes on which Raphael himself worked. Others designed by&nbsp;him and painted by Giulio Romano, Gianfrancesco Penni, and other&nbsp;pupils were the “ Battle of Ostia ” (No. 12), a very nobly composed&nbsp;picture, and the “ Oath of Leo III. before Charlemagne ” (No. 14),&nbsp;The other great picture in this room (No. 13), the “ Coronation of&nbsp;Charlemagne ” (a portrait of Francis I. of France), is so very inferior&nbsp;in composition that it is difficult to believe that Raphael even made&nbsp;a sketch for it. The enormous fresco of the “ Defeat of Maxentius&nbsp;by Constantine ” (room D, No. 17) was painted by Giulio Romano,&nbsp;soon after Râphael’s death, from a sketch by the latter; it is even&nbsp;more harsh and disagreeable in colour than most of Giulio Romano’s&nbsp;early frescoes.@@<sup>1</sup> Among the other very inferior frescoes in this great&nbsp;hall are two female figures (Nos. 15 and 16) representing Comitas&nbsp;and Justitia, painted on the wall in oil colours, very harmonious&nbsp;and rich in tone; they are usually, though wrongly, attributed to&nbsp;Raphael himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Technical Methods employed in Raphael's Frescoes.—</span><span class="font0">Having made many studies, both nude and draped, for single figures and&nbsp;groups, the painter made a small drawing of the whole composition,&nbsp;which was enlarged by his pupils with the help of numbered squares,&nbsp;drawn all over it, to the full size required,@@<sup>2</sup> on paper or canvas.&nbsp;Holes were then pricked along the outlines of the cartoon, and the&nbsp;design pounced through on to an undercoat of dry stucco on the&nbsp;wall, with pounded charcoal and a stiff brush. Over this, early&nbsp;in the morning, a patch of wet stucco was laid, about enough to&nbsp;serve for the day’s painting; this of course obliterated the outline on the wall, and the part covered by the patch was again&nbsp;sketched in by freehand, with a point on the wet stucco, so as to&nbsp;be a guide for the outline traced with the brush and the subsequent&nbsp;painting. A line impressed on the wet stucco was easily smoothed&nbsp;out, but a touch of the brush full of pigment sank deeply into the&nbsp;moist stucco, and could not easily be effaced, lt will thus be seen&nbsp;that in fresco painting the only use of pouncing the whole design&nbsp;on to the wall was to keep the general positions of the figures right,&nbsp;and was no guide as to the drawing of each separate part. Fig. 5&nbsp;shows the portrait-heads of himself and Perugino (?), at the extreme&nbsp;right of the School of Athens; on this are visible many of the&nbsp;impressed sketch-lines, and also part of the “ fresco edge ” of the&nbsp;patch on which this part is painted. The heads in this figure arc&nbsp;less than one day’s work. It will be seen that there is no attempt&nbsp;at any accuracy of drawing in the impressed lines. Raphael,&nbsp;especially jn his later frescoes, worked with wonderful rapidity:&nbsp;three life-sized busts, or half a full-length figure, more than life-size,&nbsp;was a not unusual day’s work. In some of the frescoes the edges&nbsp;of each day’s patch of stucco can easily be traced, especially in the&nbsp;Incendio del Borgo, which has a strong side light. In the Disputa&nbsp;much use was made of tempera in the final touches, but less was&nbsp;used in the subsequent frescoes, owing to his increasing mastery of&nbsp;the difficulties of the process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The paintings in the stanze were only a small part of Raphael’s work between 1509 and 1513. To this period belong the&nbsp;Madonna of Foligno (Vatican), painted in 1511 for Sigismondo&nbsp;Conti; it is one of his most beautiful compositions, full of&nbsp;the utmost grace and sweetness of expression, and appears to&nbsp;be wholly the work of his hand. It has suffered much from&nbsp;repainting. Of about the same date are the gem-like Garνagh&nbsp;Madonna (National Gallery, bought for £9000; once in the&nbsp;possession of the Aldobrandini family), the Diademed Virgin</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">of the Louvre, and the Madonna del Pesce at Madrid. The last is a very noble picture but the design is more pleasing than the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">colour, which, like other paintings of Raphael’s at Madrid, suggests the inferior touch of a pupil; it was executed in&nbsp;1513 for S. Domenico in Naples. In addition to other easel&nbsp;pictures a number of his finest portraits belong to this period&nbsp;—that of Julius II. (Uffizi),@@<sup>3</sup> of which a good replica or contemporary&nbsp; copy exists in the National Gallery, the so-called&nbsp;Fornarina in the Palazzo Barberini, the Baldassare Castiglione&nbsp;of the Louvre, and the unfinished portrait of Federigo Gonzaga&nbsp;of Mantua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Giovanni de’ Medici, at the age of thirty-eight, became pope as Leo X., a period of the most glowing splendour and&nbsp;reckless magnificence succeeded the sterner rule of Julius II.&nbsp;Agostino Chigi, the Sienese financier, was the chief of those&nbsp;whose lavish expenditure contributed to enrich Rome with&nbsp;countless works of art. For him Raphael painted, in 1513-14,&nbsp;the very beautiful fresco of the Triumph of Galatea in his&nbsp;new palace by the Tiber bank, the Villa Farnesina, and also&nbsp;made a large series of magnificent designs from Apuleius's&nbsp;romance of Cupid and Psyche, which were carried out by a&nbsp;number of his pupils.@@<sup>4</sup> These cover the vault and lunettes of a&nbsp;large loggia (now closed in for protection) ; in colouríng they are&nbsp;mostly harsh and gaudy,@@5 as is usually the case with the works&nbsp;of his pupils, a great contrast to the fresco of the Galatea, the&nbsp;greater part of which is certainly the master’s own work.@@6 For&nbsp;the same patron he painted (also in 1513) his celebrated Sibyls</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@l</sup> See Montagnani, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sala di Costantino</span><span class="font0"> (Rome, 1834). Though he was never a good colourist, the great frescoes by Giulio Romano&nbsp;in the Palazzo del Tè. Mantua, show some improvement as compared&nbsp;with his Roman work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> These three stages were usually distinguished as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">study, sketch </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cartoon.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@3</sup> A very fine ancient copy of this portrait is in the Pitti Palace; certain peculiarities in its execution show it to be by some Venetian&nbsp;painter, as was pointed out to Professor Middleton by Mr Fairfax&nbsp;Murray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@4</sup> Chiefly by Giulio Romano, Gianfrancesco Penni and Giovanni da Udine; much injury has been done to these frescoes by repainting, especially in the coarse blue of the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@δ</sup> These and other frescoes by his pupils are much disfigured by the disagreeable hot tone of the flesh,· very unlike the pearly tone&nbsp;of the flesh of Galatea.</span></p>
