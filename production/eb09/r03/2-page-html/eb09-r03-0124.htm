        <p><span class="font2">mould ; upright timbers, about 6 by 7 inches thick and 10 to 14 feet
                long, were set in rows on each face of the future wall ; planks&nbsp;9 to 10 inches
                wide were nailed to them, so as to form two sides of&nbsp;a sort of box, into which
                the semi-fluid mass of stones, lime, and&nbsp;pozzolana was poured. When this was
                set the timbers were removed and refixed on the top of the concrete wall ; then
                fresh&nbsp;concrete was poured in ; and this process was repeated till the
                wall&nbsp;was raised to the required height. Usually such cast-work was&nbsp;only
                used for foundations and cellar walls, the upper parts being&nbsp;faced with brick ;
                but in some cases the whole wall to the top was&nbsp;cast in this way and the brick
                facing omitted. In strength and&nbsp;durability no masonry, however hard the stone
                or large the blocks,&nbsp;could ever equal these walls of concrete when made with
                hard lava&nbsp;or travertine, for each wall was one perfectly coherent mass,
                and&nbsp;could only be destroyed by a laborious process like that of quarrying hard
                stone from its native bed. Owing to this method of&nbsp;forming the Roman buildings
                the progress of the work from day to&nbsp;day can often be traced by a change in the
                look of the concrete.&nbsp;About 3 feet high appears to have been the average amount
                of wall&nbsp;raised in a day.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Marble linings were fixed very firmly to the walls with long clamps
                of metal,&nbsp;hooked at the end so&nbsp;as to hold in a hole&nbsp;made in the
                marble&nbsp;slab. Fig. 5 gives an&nbsp;example, of the time&nbsp;of Augustus,
                fixed&nbsp;against a stone wall.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The quantity of rich marbles which, for at&nbsp;least three
                centuries,&nbsp;were being dug out in&nbsp;countless quarries in&nbsp;the East, by
                whole&nbsp;armies of workmen,&nbsp;and constantly poured&nbsp;into Rome is
                almost&nbsp;beyond calculation.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Scarcely a church is without columns and&nbsp;wall - linings
                stolen&nbsp;from ancient buildings, and the more&nbsp;magnificent chapels,&nbsp;such
                as those of the&nbsp;Borghese, Corsini,&nbsp;and Cibo families,&nbsp;with the whole
                church&nbsp;of S. Maria della Vittoria, owe their splendour entirely to their
                wall-linings of ancient marbles, porphyry,&nbsp;and alabaster.@@<sup>1</sup> The
                blocks were usually marked in the quarry&nbsp;with a number, and often with the
                names of the reigning emperor&nbsp;and the overseer of the quarry. These
                quarry-marks are often of&nbsp;great value as indications of the date of a building
                or statue.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>Metropolitan building Acts, not unlike those of modern
                London,&nbsp;were enacted by several of the emperors. These fixed the
                materials&nbsp;to be used, the thickness of walls, the minimum width of
                streets,&nbsp;the maximum height allowed for houses, and the like. After
                the&nbsp;great fire in Nero’s reign, 64 a,d., an Act was passed
                requiring&nbsp;external walls to be faced with fire-proof materials, such
                as&nbsp;peperino or burnt brick ; this Act was being prepared long before&nbsp;the
                fire,—strong evidence as to this being a wilful act on Nero’s&nbsp;part, as is
                asserted by Suetonius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"

        <p><span class="font2">t Enormous accumulations of statues and pictures enriched Rome &gt;f
                during its period of greatest splendour. In the first place, the&nbsp;numerous
                statues of the republican and even of the regal period&nbsp;were religiously
                preserved at a time when, from their archaic character, they must have been regarded
                rather as objects of sacred or&nbsp;archæological interest than as works of art
                (Plin., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.K,</span><span
                class="font2"> xxxiv.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">9-16, XXXV. </span><span
                class="font2">7). Secondly came the large Græco-Roman class, mostly&nbsp;copies of
                earlier Greek works, executed in Rome by Greek artists.&nbsp;To this class belongs
                most of the finest existing sculpture preserved&nbsp;in the Vatican and other
                museums. Thirdly, countless statues and&nbsp;pictures were stolen from almost every
                important city in Greece,&nbsp;Magna Græcia, Sicily, and western Asia Minor. These
                robberies&nbsp;began early, and were carried on for many centuries. The importations
                included works of art by all the chief artists from the 5th&nbsp;century downwards.
                Long lists are given by Pliny </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >(H.K.,</span><span class="font2"> xxxiii.-xxxvi. ), and pedestals even now exist
                with the names of Praxiteles,&nbsp;Timarchus, Polycletus, Bryaxis, and others (see

                class="font2"> 2), of which seventy-four&nbsp;are mentioned in the catalogue of the

                of gilt bronze and marble must&nbsp;Iiave existed in almost untold numbers (Paus.,
                viii. 46). Nor were&nbsp;the accumulated stores of Greek paintings much inferior in
                number ;&nbsp;not only were easel pictures by Zeuxis, Apelles, Timanthes,
                and&nbsp;other Greek artists taken, but even mural paintings were carefully&nbsp;cut

                neatly fitted together&nbsp;and laid on a carefully&nbsp;prepared bed,
                similar&nbsp;to that used for mosaic&nbsp;paving (see Mosaic&nbsp;and Roads).
                Roads&nbsp;thus made were called&nbsp;“viæ stratæ.” One&nbsp;portion only exists
                in&nbsp;Rome of early date,&nbsp;when the blocks were&nbsp;fitted together
                with&nbsp;the utmost accuracy&nbsp;viz., a piece of the&nbsp;Clivus Capitolinus
                in&nbsp;front of the temple of&nbsp;Saturn (see fig. 6,&nbsp;which also shows
                the&nbsp;massive travertine&nbsp;curb which bordered&nbsp;the road ; in
                some&nbsp;cases the curb was of&nbsp;lava). The other best&nbsp;preserved viæ
                stratæ&nbsp;in Rome are those &nbsp;leading up to the&nbsp;Palatine from
                the&nbsp;Summa Sacra Via and&nbsp;that which follows&nbsp;the curved line of shops
                in Trajan’s forum. Many others exist,&nbsp;but have all been relaid in later times,
                with badly fitting joints.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The following is a list of the chief roads which radiated from Rome
                (see Plate VI.):—(1) Via Appia and (2) Via Latina, both&nbsp;issued from the Servian
                Porta Capena, and both met at Beneventum ;&nbsp;(3) Via Labicana, from the P.
                Esquilina, passing Labicum, joined&nbsp;the Via Latina 30 miles from Rome ; (4) Via
                Gabina (later called&nbsp;Prænestina), also issued from the P. Esquilina and joined
                the Via&nbsp;Latina,—these two roads pass through the Claudian aqueduct
                gate&nbsp;(mod. Porta Maggiore) ; (5) Via Tiburtina, from the gate of that
                name&nbsp;to Tibur ; (6) Via Nomentana, from the P. Collina, passing Nomen-tum,
                joined the Via Salaria ; (7) Via Salaria, also from the P.&nbsp;Collina, joined the
                Via Flaminia at Ancona ; (8) Via Flaminia, its&nbsp;first half-mile or so after
                leaving the Servian Porta Ratumena was&nbsp;known as the Via Lata ; it afterwards
                passed out of the Aurelian&nbsp;P. Flaminia, and with many branches led to the chief
                towns of&nbsp;Northern Italy, and so into Cisalpine Gaul ; (9) Via Aurelia,
                issued&nbsp;from the trans-Tiberine P. Aurelia and passed through Pisa to Gaul
                ;&nbsp;(10) Via Portuensis, from the gate of that name, also on the right&nbsp;hank
                of the Tiber, to Portus Augusti near its mouth ; (11) Via&nbsp;Ostiensis, from the
                Servian P. Trigemina and the Aurelian P.&nbsp;Ostiensis to Ostia ; (12) Via
                Ardeatina, probably a branch from the&nbsp;Via Appia, led to Ardea.</span></p>

        <p><span class="font2">It is evident from recent discoveries that the site of Rome was
                populous at a very remote period. Flint implements and remains&nbsp;of the early
                Bronze Age have been found on the Aventine and in&nbsp;other places;@@<sup>5</sup>
                and in 1874, near the arch of Gallienus on the&nbsp;Esquiline, the important
                discovery was made of a necropolis @@<sup>6</sup> apparently of considerable extent,
                the tombs of which and their contents—fictile vases and other objects—were of
                Phoenician and&nbsp;Etruscan character, dating probably about the time of the
                traditional founding of Rome. In February 1883 a number of very&nbsp;early cist
                tombs, formed by two slabs of stone set on edge with a&nbsp;third for the lid, were
                found during excavations on the Esquiline&nbsp;between the Piazza Vitt. Emmanuele
