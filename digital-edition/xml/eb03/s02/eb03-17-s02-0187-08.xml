a celebrated mathematician and geographer of Caria, flouriſhed under the reign of Darius Hyſtaſpes, about 558 B. C. Some have attributed to him the invention of geographical tables. We have under his name a geographical work publiſhed by Hoeſchelius; but it is wirkten by a much later author, and is perhaps only an abridgment oſ Scylax’s Ancient Geography.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
