the last king of the Assyrians, was the thirtieth from Ninus, of whom Herodotus merely mentions that he concealed his treasure in subterranean vaults. The character usually ascribed to him is that of a luxurious and slothful prince, who spent the greater part of his time in the harem among his women. But it is difficult to reconcile this statement with the brave and obstinate resistance he made to the attack of the rebel Arbaces, prince of Media. He defeated Arbaces twice, but at last was shut up within Ninus (Nineveh), where he destroyed himself and treasures on a funeral pile. There was, however, another Sardanapalus, the son of Anacyndaraxes, who is said to have founded Tarsus and AnchialÃ« in one day, and whose epitaph is frequently quoted, and it is not unlikely that Ctesias, from whom Diodorus quotes, has mixed up the events that happened to these two. The second is thought to be the Esarhaddon of the Scriptures, and the</p><p>first to be the Saracus of Abydenus.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
