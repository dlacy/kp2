<p><span class="font1">surface of the street as the height of the car itself would permit; in the case of Budapest the distance is about 9 ft. This principle of construction has since been followed in the construction&nbsp;of the Boston subway, of the Chemin de Fer Métropolitain&nbsp;in Paris, and of the New York underground railway. The&nbsp;Paris line is built with the standard gauge of 4 ft 8½ in.,&nbsp;but its tunnels are designedly made of such a small cross-section that ordinary main line stock cannot pass through&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The New York underground railway (fig. 35) marks a still further step in advance, in that there are practically two&nbsp;different railways in the same structure. One pair of tracks&nbsp;is used for a local service with stations about one-quarter of&nbsp;a mile apart, following the general plan of operation in vogue&nbsp;on all other intra-urban railways. The other, or central, pair&nbsp;of tracks is for trains making stops at longer distances. Thus&nbsp;there is a differentiation between the long-distance traveller&nbsp;who desires to be carried from one extreme of the city to the&nbsp;other and the short-distance traveller who is going between&nbsp;points at a much less distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To sum up, there are of intra-urban railways two distinct classes: the elevated and the underground. The elevated is&nbsp;used where the traffic is so light as not to warrant the expen-sive underground construction, or where the construction of&nbsp;an elevated line is of no serious detriment to the adjoining&nbsp;property. The underground is used where the congestion of&nbsp;traffic is so great as to demand a railway almost regardless&nbsp;of cost, and where the conditions of surface traffic or of&nbsp;adjoining property are such as to require that the railway shall not obstruct or occupy any ground above the&nbsp;surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Underground railways are of three general types: the one of extreme depth, built by tunne℔ng methods, usually with&nbsp;the shield and without regard to the surface topography, where&nbsp;the stations are put at such depth as to require lifts to carry&nbsp;the passengers from the station platform to the street level.&nbsp;This type has the advantage of economy in first construction,&nbsp;there being the minimum amount of material to be excavated,&nbsp;and no interference during construction with street traffic or&nbsp;subsurface structures; it has, however, the disadvantage of&nbsp;the cost of operation of lifts at the stations. The other extreme&nbsp;type is the shallow construction, where the railway is brought&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font0" style="text-decoration:underline;">minim</span><span class="font0">um </span><span class="font1">distance below the street level. This system&nbsp;has the advantage of the greatest convenience in operation,&nbsp;no lifts being required, since the distance from the street surface&nbsp;to the station platform is about 12 to 15 ft.; it has the dis-advantages, however, of necessitating the tearing up of the&nbsp;street surface during construction, and the readjustment of&nbsp;sewer, water, gas and electric mains and other subsurface&nbsp;structures, and of having the gradients partially dependent on&nbsp;the surface topography. The third type is the intermediate&nbsp;one between those two, followed by the Metropolitan and&nbsp;Metropolitan District railways, in London, where the railway&nbsp;has an arched roof, built usually at a sufficient distance&nbsp;below the surface of the street to permit the other sub-surface structures to lie in the ground above the crown&nbsp;of the arch, and where the station platforms are from 20&nbsp;to 30 ft. beneath the surface of the street—a depth not&nbsp;sufficient to warrant the introduction of lifts, but enough to&nbsp;be inconvenient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the operation of intra-urban railways, steam locomotives, cables and electricity have severally been tried: the first having&nbsp;been used in the earlier examples of underground lines&nbsp;and in the various elevated systems in the United&nbsp;States. The fouling of the air that results from the&nbsp;steam-engine, owing to the production of carbonic acid gas and&nbsp;of sulphurous fumes and aqueous vapour, is well known, and&nbsp;its use is now practically abandoned for underground working.&nbsp;The cable is slow; and unless development along new lines&nbsp;of compressed air or some sort of chemical engine takes place,&nbsp;electricity will monopolize the field. Electricity is applied</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">through a separate locomotive attached to the head of the train, or through motor carriages attached either at one end or at both ends of the train, or by&nbsp;putting a motor on every axle and so utilizing the&nbsp;whole weight of the train for traction, all the motors&nbsp;being under a single control at the head of the train,&nbsp;or at any point of the train for emergency. The&nbsp;distance between stations on intra-urban railways is&nbsp;governed by the density of local traffic and the&nbsp;speed desired to be maintained. As a general rule&nbsp;the interval varies from one-quarter to one-half mile;&nbsp;on the express lines of the New York underground&nbsp;railway, the inter-station interval averages about 1½ m. On&nbsp;steam-worked lines the speed of trains is about 11 to 15 m.&nbsp;per hour, according to the distance between stations Later&nbsp;practice takes advantage of the great increase in power that&nbsp;can be temporarily developed by electric motors during the&nbsp;period of acceleration; this, in proportion to the weight of&nbsp;the train to be hauled, gives results much in advance of those&nbsp;obtained on ordinary steam railways. Since high average&nbsp;speed on a line with frequent stops depends largely on rapidity&nbsp;of acceleration, the tendency in modern equipment is to secure&nbsp;as great an output of power as possible during the accelerating&nbsp;period, with corresponding increase in weight available for&nbsp;adhesion. With a steam locomotive all the power is concen-trated in one machine, and therefore the weight on the drivers&nbsp;available for adhesion is limited. With electricity, power can&nbsp;be applied to as many axles in the train as desired, and so the&nbsp;whole weight of the train, with its load, may be utilized if&nbsp;necessary. Sometimes, as on the Central London railway,&nbsp;the acceleration of gravity is also utilized; the different stations&nbsp;stand, as it were, on the top of a hill, so that outgoing trains&nbsp;are aided at the start by having a slope to run down, while&nbsp;incoming ones are checked by the rising gradient they encounter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cost of intra-urban railways depends not only on the type of construction, but more especially upon local conditions,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">such as the nature of the soil, the presence of subsurface structures, like sewers, water and gas mains, electric&nbsp;conduits, &amp;c.; the necessity of permanent underpinning or&nbsp;temporary supporting of house foundations, the cost of acquiring&nbsp;land passed under or over when street lines are not followed,&nbsp;and, in the case of elevated railways, the cost of acquiring&nbsp;easements of light, air and access, which the courts have held&nbsp;are vested in the abutting property. The cost of building an&nbsp;ordinary two-track elevated railway according to American&nbsp;practice varies from $300,000 to $400,000 a mile, exclusive of&nbsp;equipment, terminals or land damages. The cost of constructing the deep tubular tunnels in London, whose diameter is about&nbsp;15 ft. exclusive, ĩn like manner, of equipment, terminals or land&nbsp;damages, is about £170,000 to £200,000 a mile. The cost of&nbsp;the Metropolitan and Metropolitan District railways of London&nbsp;varied greatly on account of the variations in construction.&nbsp;The most difficult section—namely, that under Cannon Street—&nbsp;where the abutting buildings had to be underpinned, and a very&nbsp;dense traffic maintained during construction, while a network&nbsp;of sewers and mains was readjusted, cost at the rate of about&nbsp;£1,000,000 a mile. The contract price of the New York under-ground railway, exclusive of the incidentals above mentioned,&nbsp;was $35,000, 000 for 21 m., of which 16 m. are underground and&nbsp;5 are elevated. The most difficult portion of the road, 4½ m. of&nbsp;four-track line, cost $15,000,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. B. P. )</span></p>
