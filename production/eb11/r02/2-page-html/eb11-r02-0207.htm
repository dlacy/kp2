No specimen of this&nbsp;species has ever been brought alive to Europe. AIr F. C. Selous&nbsp;gives the following description of its habits:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“The square-mouthed rhinoceros is a huge, ungainly looking beast, with a disproportionately large head, a large male standing 6 ft. 6 in. at the shoulder. Like elephants and buffaloes&nbsp;they lie asleep ’during the heat of the day, and feed during&nbsp;the night and in the cool hours of early morning and evening.&nbsp;Their sight is very bad; but they are quick of hearing, and their&nbsp;scent is very keen ; they are, too, often accompanied by rhinoceros&nbsp;birds, which, by running about their heads, flapping their wings,&nbsp;and screeching at the same time, frequently give them notice of the&nbsp;approach of danger. When disturbed they go off at a swift trot,&nbsp;which soon leaves all pursuit from a man on foot far behind; but if&nbsp;chased by a horseman they break into a gallop, which they can keep&nbsp;up for some distance. However, although they run very swiftly,&nbsp;when their size and heavy build is considered, they are no match for&nbsp;an average good horse. They are, as a rule, very easy to shoot on&nbsp;horseback, as, if one gallops a little in front of and on one side of&nbsp;them, they will hold their course, and come sailing past, offering&nbsp;a magnificent broadside shot, while under similar circumstances&nbsp;a prehensile-lipped rhinoceros will usually swerve away in such a&nbsp;manner as only to present his hind-quarters for a shot. When&nbsp;either walking or running, the square-mouthed rhinoceros holds&nbsp;its head very low, its nose nearly touching the ground. When a&nbsp;small calf accompanies its mother, it always runs in front and she&nbsp;appears to guide it by holding the point of her horn upon the little&nbsp;animal's rump; and it is perfectly wonderful to note how in all&nbsp;sudden changes of pace, from a trot to a gallop, or vice versa, the&nbsp;same position is always exactly maintained. During the autumn&nbsp;and winter months </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(f.e.</span><span class="font1"> from March to August) the square-mouthed&nbsp;rhinoceros is usually very fat; and its meat is then most excellent,&nbsp;being something like beef, but yet having a peculiar flavour of its&nbsp;own. The part in greatest favour among hunters is the hump,&nbsp;which, if cut off whole and roasted just as it is in the skin, in a hole&nbsp;dug in the ground, would, I think, be difficult to match either for&nbsp;juiciness or flavour.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W.

<p><span class="font2">RHINTHON </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(c.</span><span class="font2"> 323-285 B.C.), Greek dramatist, son of a potter. He was probably a native of Syracuse and afterwards settled at Tarentum. He invented the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Iiilarotragoedia<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font2">  a&nbsp;burlesque of tragic subjects. Such travesties were also called&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phlyaces</span><span class="font2"> (“ fooleries ”) and their writers </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">phlyacographi.</span><span class="font2"> Hc was&nbsp;the author of thirty-eight plays, of which only a few titles&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Amphitryon<sub>i</sub>Herocles<sub>i</sub>Orestes)</span><span class="font2"> and lines have been preserved,&nbsp;chiefly by the grammarians, as illustrating dialectic Tarentinc&nbsp;forms. The metre is iambic, in which the greatest Hcence&nbsp;is allowed. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amphitruo</span><span class="font2"> of Plautus, although probably&nbsp;imitated from a different writer (Archippus of the Middle&nbsp;Comedy), may be taken as a specimen of the manner in which&nbsp;such subjects were treated. There is no doubt that the hilaro-tragoedia exercised considerable influence on Latin comedy, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhinthonica (i.e.</span><span class="font2"> fabula) being mentioned by various authorities&nbsp;amongst other kinds of drama known to the Romans. Scenes&nbsp;from these travesties are probably represented in certain vase&nbsp;paintings from Lower Italy, for which see H. Heydemann, “ Die&nbsp;Phlyakendarstellungen auf bemalten Vasen,” in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jahrbuch des&nbsp;archäologischen Instituts,</span><span class="font2"> i.

<p><span class="font2">RHIZOPODA, the name given by Dujardin </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(pro parte,</span><span class="font2"> 1838) to a group of Sarcodine Protozoa. They are distinguished by&nbsp;their pseudopods, simple or branched, passing by wide bases&nbsp;into the general surface, never fine radial nor fusing into complex&nbsp;networks; skeleton absent or a simple shell (“ test,” “ theca ”),&nbsp;never (?) </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">calcareous shell, nor represented by a siHceous network,<sup>1</sup> nor spicules. Reproduction by binary fission ; by division&nbsp;or abstriction of buds after the body has become multi-nucleate;&nbsp;or by the resolution of the body into numerous uninucleate&nbsp;zoospores (amœbulæ or flagellulæ) which may conjugate as&nbsp;gametes; plasmodium formation unknown; encystment (in&nbsp;“ resting cysts ” or “ hypnocysts ”) common. Without </span><span class="font0">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">knowledge of the history it is impossible to distinguish a naked&nbsp;Lobose from the Amoebula (pseudopodiospore) of a AIyxomycete&nbsp;or Proteomyxan. As to the name, Dujardin included the&nbsp;thecate Lobosa, the Filosa, and the Reticularia or Foraminifera&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font2"> The latter had already received the name Foraminifera&nbsp;(for their shells) from dOrbigny; and as it is impossible </span><span class="font0">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">separate naked from thecate Lobosa we have merged his&nbsp;Amoebina (Amibiens) in the larger group. The Filosa were&nbsp;removed by Lang from the Reticularia; in habit and test they&nbsp;are inseparable from the Lobosa; and though their cytoplasm&nbsp;approximates to that of Reticularia, their ectosarc is much less&nbsp;granular, though not free from granules as stated by Lang.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The majority of Rhizopoda are fresh-water forms, some occurring in the film of water on mosses, among Sphagnum, or&nbsp;about the bases of grass-haulms; many, however, are exclusively&nbsp;marine. The aquatic forms generally may lurk among Confervae&nbsp;or higher weeds, or lie in the bottom of decomposing or excre-mentitious matter in still or slow-flowing waters. Of these some&nbsp;may become temporarily pelagic, floating up by the formation&nbsp;of gas vacuoles (containing probably CO2) in the cytoplasm. It&nbsp;is easy to verify this by placing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Arcella</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 1, 7) in a drop of&nbsp;water on a glass cover and inverting this over a glass ring; the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Arcella</span><span class="font2"> sink to the free convex surface of the drop and escape&nbsp;from this most unnatural position by secreting gas-vacuoles;&nbsp;when they float up to contact with the glass cover, so as to touch&nbsp;it by the convex back of the shell, they put forth long pseudopodia which attach themselves to the glass and by their contraction turn the animal over, so that it can crawl over </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">under) the glass. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amoeba (Entamoeba) histolytica,</span><span class="font2"> Schaudinn, is&nbsp;the cause of tropical dysentery and hepatic abscess in man.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pelomyxa</span><span class="font2"> (fig. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">i,</span><span class="font2"> 5-6) is remarkable for containing symbiotic&nbsp;bacteria. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zooxanthellae</span><span class="font2"> (symbiotic green cells—Algae or&nbsp;Flagellates) occur in several species; and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Paiilinella</span><span class="font2"> contains&nbsp;two sausage-shaped blue-green bodies, “ chromatophores,”&nbsp;which are probably symbiotic Cyanophyceae. The shell, even&nbsp;when not a simple membrane, has always a continuous inner&nbsp;membrane of a complex nitrogenous substance containing&nbsp;sulphur, allied to keratin and termed pseudochitin. The outer&nbsp;layer when present is composed of little hollow prisms </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Arcella,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">fig. i, 7), sand, or inorganic matter first swallowed by the&nbsp;animal </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Difflugia, Pseudodifflugia),</span><span class="font2"> sometimes partially digested&nbsp;(Lecquereuxia), or else of plates secreted as “ reserve plates ”&nbsp;within the cytoplasm of the animal </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cyphoderia</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 6, B),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Quadrula, Nebelia, Euglypha</span><span class="font2"> (figs. 4, 6, A), &amp;c. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Quadrula&nbsp;irregularis</span><span class="font2"> alone are the plates said to be calcareous; elsewhere&nbsp;they are always siHceous and simply refractive, so that the&nbsp;silica is probably hydrated (opal). The cement is possibly of&nbsp;Silicified pseudochitin. This material is often permeated by a&nbsp;ferric oxide or hydrate, even when it is not coloured rusty brown.&nbsp;SheH formation of the membranous test is by simple surface-excretion; under budding we describe its accompHshment in the&nbsp;aggregated shells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The “ pylome,” or aperture for the protrusion of the protoplasm, is usually single. There are two pylomes at opposite poles in several Filosa </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ditrema),</span><span class="font2"> hence united by some authors&nbsp;into a distinct family (fig. 7, 1, 5, 11), and in the gelatinous&nbsp;theca of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Trichosphaerium</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 5) are numerous permanent&nbsp;pylomic pores. The nucleus is variable in form and character.&nbsp;In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amoeba binucleata</span><span class="font2"> two nuclei are always present; and some&nbsp;genera are permanently plurinucleate </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pelomyxa, Arcella,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">fig. i, 7). It often gives forth fragments into the cytoplasm, the&nbsp;“ chromidia” of R. Hertwig, which, as in Foraminifera (?.».),&nbsp;may play an important part </span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font2">reproductive processes. The&nbsp;contractile vacuole (there are two in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Arcella,</span><span class="font2"> fig. 1, 7) in actively&nbsp;progressing Rhizopods always discharges at the hinder end.&nbsp;Absent or sluggish in marine forms, it is of constant occurrence&nbsp;in aU fresh-water Rhizopods except </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pelomyxa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The pseudopods vary greatly in type. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amoeba princeps </span><span class="font2">(fig. 1, 4) they are mere promontory-like extensions of the body;&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A. radiosa</span><span class="font2"> (fig. i, 1-3) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Trichosphaerium</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 5) they are&nbsp;distinct slender processes, tapering, and either blunt or finely&nbsp;pointed at the apex; in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pelomyxa</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 1, 5, 6) as in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A. (Litha-moeba) discus</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 2) they are “ eruptive, ” hemispherical,&nbsp;formed apparently by the rupture of the ectoplasm, and the&nbsp;outpouring of the endoplasm which at once differentiates a&nbsp;clear outer layer as a new ectoplasm; in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amoeba Umax</span><span class="font2"> during</span></p>
