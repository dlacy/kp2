<p><span class="font0">The Romans now congratulated themſelves on their happy deliverance ſrom tyranny. However, as Tarquin had by his policy procured himſelf many friends&nbsp;abroad, theſe now became enemies to the Roman name;&nbsp;and, by the defection of their allies, the Roman dominions were left in much the ſame ſtate as they had been&nbsp;in the time of Romulus. The territory of Rome had&nbsp;always been confined to a very narrow’ compaſs. Though&nbsp;almoſt conſtantly victorious in war for 243 years, they&nbsp;had not yet gained land enough to ſupply their city&nbsp;with proviſions. The main ſtrength of the ſtate lay in&nbsp;the number of the citizens of Rome ; which the cuſtom&nbsp;of tranſplanting the inhabitants of the conquered cities&nbsp;thither had ſo prodigiouſly increaſed, that it put the&nbsp;Romans in a condition of uſurping the authority over&nbsp;other nations, the moſt inconſiderable of which had an&nbsp;extent of territory far exceeding theirs. By frequent&nbsp;depredations and incurſions they ſo haraſſed the petty&nbsp;ſtates of Latium and Hetruria, that many of them were&nbsp;conſtrained to enter into treaties with Rome, by which&nbsp;they obliged themſelves to furniſh her with auxiliaries&nbsp;whenever ſhe ſhould be pleaſed to invade and pillage the&nbsp;lands of her other neighbours. Submiſſions of this kind&nbsp;the Romans called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">making alliances</span><span class="font0"> with them, and theſe&nbsp;uſeful alliances ſupplied the want of a larger territory ;&nbsp;but now, upon the change of her government, all the&nbsp;allies of Rome forſeok her at once, and either ſtood&nbsp;neuter, or eſpouſed the cauſe of the baniſhed king; ſo&nbsp;that ſhe was now obliged to maintain her liberties as&nbsp;ſhe beſt might.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The new conſuls in the mean time took the moſt effectual methods they could for ſecuring the liberties of the republic. The army which had been employed in&nbsp;the ſiege of Ardea marched home under the conduct&nbsp;of Herminius and Horatius, who concluded a truce&nbsp;with the Ardeates for 15 years. The conſuls then&nbsp;again aſtembled the people by centuries, and had the&nbsp;'decree of Tarquin’s baniſhment confirmed ; a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rex ſacrorum</span><span class="font0"> was elected to preſide at the ſacrifices, and many&nbsp;of the laws of Servius Tullius were revived, to the&nbsp;great joy of the people, who were thus reſtored to their&nbsp;ancient right of voting in all important affairs. Tarquin, however, reſolved not to part with his kingdom&nbsp;on ſuch eaſy terms. Having wandered ſrom city to&nbsp;city in order to move compaſſion, he at length made&nbsp;Tarquinii the ſeat of his reſidence ; where he engaged&nbsp;the inhabitants to ſend an embaſſy to Rome, with a&nbsp;modeſt, ſubmiſſive letter from himſelf, directed to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roman people. The ambaſſadors repreſented in ſuch ſtrong terms to the ſenate how reaſonable it was to let&nbsp;the king be heard before he w<sup>,</sup>as condemned, and the&nbsp;danger which threatened the ſtate from the neighbouring powers if that common juſtice were refuſed, that&nbsp;the conſiſts inclined to bring theſe agents before the&nbsp;people, and to leave the deciſion thereof to the curiae ;&nbsp;but Valerius, who had been very active in the revolution, ſtrenuouſly oppoſed this, and by his influence in&nbsp;the ſenate got it prevented. As that illuſtrious body&nbsp;had been greatly thinned by the murders committed by&nbsp;Tarquin, new members were elected from among the&nbsp;knights, and the ancient number of 300 again completed. The old ſenators had been called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patres</span><span class="font0"> or “ fathers ;” and as the names of the new oneswere now&nbsp;written on the ſame roll, the whole body received the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patres conſcriptt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The old king was not to be foiled by a ſingle at</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">tempt. He prevailed on the inhabitants of Tarquinii to ſend a ſecond embaſſy to Rome, under pretence of&nbsp;demanding the eſtates of the exiles, but with private&nbsp;inſtructions to get the conſuls aſſaſſinated. The reſtoration of the eſtates of the exiles was oppoſed by Brutus, but Collatinus was for complying with it ; whereupon Brutus accuſed his colleague of treachery, and of&nbsp;a deſign to bring back the tyrant. The matter was&nbsp;then referred to the people, where it was carried by one&nbsp;vote in favour of the Tarquins. But whilſt the people&nbsp;were employed in loading carriages with the effects of&nbsp;the exiles, and in felling what could not be carried off,&nbsp;the ambaſſadors found means to draw ſome of the neareſt relations of the conſuls into a plot with them. Theſe&nbsp;were three young noblemen of the Aquilian family (the&nbsp;ſons of Collatinus’s ſiſter), and two of the Vitëllii&nbsp;(whoſe ſiſter Brutus had married) ; and theſe laſt engaged Titus and Tiberius, the two ſons of Brutus, in&nbsp;the ſame conſpiracy. They all bound themſelves by&nbsp;ſolemn oaths, with the dreadful ceremony of drinking&nbsp;the blood of a murdered man and touching his entrails.&nbsp;They met at the houſe of the Aquilii, where they&nbsp;wrote letters to Tarquin and gave them to the ambaf~&nbsp;ſadors. But though they uſed all imaginable precaution, their proceedings were overheard by one Vindi-cius a ſlave, who immediately communicated the whole&nbsp;to Valerius ; upon which all the criminals were apprehended. Brutus ſtood judge over his own ſons ; and,&nbsp;notwithſtanding the interceſſion of the whole aſſembly,&nbsp;and the tears and lamentations of his children, commanded them to be beheaded-; nor would he depart&nbsp;till he ſaw the execution of the ſentence. Having performed this piece of heroic barbarity, he quitted the&nbsp;tribunal, and left Collatinus to perform the reſt. Collatinus, however, being inclined to ſpare his nephews,&nbsp;allowed them a day to clear themſelves ; and cauſed&nbsp;Vindicius, the only witneſs againſt them, to be delivered up to his maſters. This rouſed the indignation of&nbsp;the people in general, eſpecially of Valerius, who had&nbsp;promiſed to protect the witneſs, and therefore he refuſed to deliver him up to the lictors. The multitude&nbsp;called aloud for Brutus to return ; which when he had&nbsp;done, he told them that he had executed his two ſons&nbsp;in conſequence of his own paternal authority over them,&nbsp;but that it belonged to the people to determine the&nbsp;fate of the reſt. Accordingly, by a decree of the curiæ,&nbsp;all the delinquents ſuffered as traitors except the ambaſſadors, who were ſpared out of reſpect to their character. The ſlave Vindicius had his liberty granted</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">him; and was preſented with 25,00? aies of braſs, in value about L.,8o : 14 : 7 of our money. The decree&nbsp;for reſtoring the eſtates of the exiled Tarquins was annulled, their palaces were deſtroyed, and their lands&nbsp;divided among the indigent people. The public only&nbsp;1 etained a piece of ground, near the Campus Martius?&nbsp;which the king had uſurped. This they conſecrated:&nbsp;to Mars, and it afterwards became a common field&nbsp;where the Roman youth exerciſed themſelves in running and wreſtling. But after this conſecration, the&nbsp;ſuperſtitious Romans ſcrupled to uſe the corn which&nbsp;they found there ready reaped to their hands : ſo that&gt;,&nbsp;with ſome trees, it was thrown into the Tiber ; and.&nbsp;the water being low, it flopped in the middle of the river, and began to form a fine iſland named afterward»&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inſula Sacra.</span></p>
