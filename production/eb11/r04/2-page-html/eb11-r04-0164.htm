<p><span class="font0">Rienzi’s deeds. The provincial cities did homage to Rome and her tribune, and almost all the rest of Italy gave him its&nbsp;enthusiastic adherence. The ancient sovereign people seemed&nbsp;on the point of resuscitation. And others besides the multitude&nbsp;were fascinated and carried off their feet. Great men like&nbsp;Petrarch were transported with joy. The poet lauded Cola&nbsp;di Rienzi as a sublime and supernatural being, the greatest of&nbsp;ancient and modern men. But it was soon evident that all&nbsp;this enthusiasm was mainly factitious. On the 26th of July&nbsp;a new parliament was called, and this decreed that all the rights&nbsp;and privileges granted to the empire and church must now be&nbsp;vested in the Roman people, from whom they had first emanated.&nbsp;But on the convocation of the national parliament few representatives obeyed the summons and the scheme was a failure.&nbsp;All had gone well so long as principles only were proclaimed, but&nbsp;when words had to be followed by deeds the municipal feeling&nbsp;awoke and distrust began to prevail. Nevertheless, on the 1st&nbsp;of August Rienzi assumed the spurs of knighthood and passed&nbsp;a decree declaring that Rome would now resume her old jurisdiction over the world, invoking the Holy Spirit upon Italy, granting the Roman citizenship to all her cities, and proclaiming&nbsp;them free in virtue of the freedom of Rome. This was a strange&nbsp;jumble of the ancient Roman idea.combined with the medieval.&nbsp;It was a dream of Rienzi’s brain, but it was also the dream of&nbsp;Dante and Petrarch. The conception of the empire and the&nbsp;history of Italy, particularly that of ancient and medieval&nbsp;Rome, were inevitably preparing the way for the national idea.&nbsp;This Rienzi foresaw, and this constitutes the true grandeur&nbsp;of his character, which in other respects was not exempt from&nbsp;pettiness and infirmity. He pursued his course, therefore, undismayed, and had indeed gone too far to draw back. On the&nbsp;15th of August he caused himself to be crowned tribune with&nbsp;great pomp, and confirmed the rights of Roman citizenship to&nbsp;all natives of Italy. But practical matters had also to be taken&nbsp;into account, and it was here that his weakness and lack of&nbsp;judgment were shown. The nobles remained steadily hostile, and&nbsp;refused to yield to the charm of his words. Hence conflict was&nbsp;unavoidable; and at first Rienzi succeeded in vanquishing the&nbsp;Gaetani by means of Giovanni Colonna. He next endeavoured&nbsp;to suppress the Guelph and Ghibelline factions, and to restore&nbsp;Italy to &quot; holy union ” by raising her from her present abasement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pope, however, was weary of toleration, and, coming to terms with the nobles, incited them to war. They accordingly moved from Palestrina, and on the 30th of -November&nbsp;were encamped before Rome. Rienzi now put forth his&nbsp;energy. He had already called the militia to arms, and a&nbsp;genuine battle took place in which eighty nobles, chiefly of the&nbsp;Colonna clan, were left dead. This was a real catastrophe to&nbsp;them, and the aristocracy never again achieved the rule of the&nbsp;republic. But Rienzi’s head was turned by this sudden success.&nbsp;In great need of money, he began to play the tyrant by levying&nbsp;taxes and exacting instant obedience. The papal legate saw&nbsp;his opportunity and seized it, by threatening to bring a charge&nbsp;of heresy against the tribune. Rienzi was dismayed. He&nbsp;declared himself friendly to the pope and willing to respect his&nbsp;authority; and he even sought to conciliate the nobles. At&nbsp;this moment certain Neapolitan and Hungarian captains, after&nbsp;levying soldiers with the tribune’s consent, joined the nobles&nbsp;and broke out in revolt. On their proving victorious in a preliminary encounter with some of Rienzi’s guards, the tribune&nbsp;suddenly lost heart, resigned the power he had held for seven&nbsp;months, and took refuge with a few trusty adherents in the&nbsp;castle of St Angelo on the 15th December 1347. Thence he&nbsp;presently fled to Naples, vainly hoping to find aid, and afterwards disappeared for some time from the scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile the Romans remained tranquil, intent on making money by the jubilee; but no sooner was this over than disorders broke out and the tyranny of the baronage recommenced.&nbsp;To remedy this state of things, application was made to the&nbsp;pope. He consulted with a committee of cardinals, who sought&nbsp;the advice of Petrarch, and the poet suggested a popular government, to the complete exclusion of the nobles, since these,&nbsp;he said, were strangers who ruined the city. The people had&nbsp;already elected the Thirteen, and now, encouraged by these&nbsp;counsels, on the 26th of December 1351 chose Giovanni Perrone&nbsp;as head of the republic. But the new leader was unable to withstand the hostilities of the nobles; and in September 1353&nbsp;Francesco Baroncelli was elected tribune. He was a follower&nbsp;of Rienzi, had been his ambassador to Florence and did little&nbsp;beyond imitating his mode of government and smoothing the&nbsp;way for his return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rienzi had spent two years in the Abruzzi, leading a life of mystic contemplation on Monte Maiella. Then, in 13 so, he had&nbsp;gone to Prague and endeavoured to convert to his ideas the yet&nbsp;uncrowned emperor Charles IV. When apparently on the point&nbsp;of success, he was sent under arrest to the new pope, Innocçpt VI.&nbsp;(1352-62), a man of great shrewdness and practical sense. On&nbsp;Rienzi’s arrival at Avignon it became evident that his popularity&nbsp;was still very great, and that it would be no easy task to dispose&nbsp;of him. The Romans were imploring his return; Petrarch&nbsp;lauded him as a modern Gracchus or Scipio; and the pope&nbsp;finally released him from confinement. Innocent had decided&nbsp;to send to Italy, in order to settle affairs and bring the state into&nbsp;subjection to the church, that valiant captain and skilled&nbsp;politician, Cardinal Albornoz. And, having no fear that the&nbsp;latter’s hand would be forced, he further decided that Rienzi&nbsp;should be sent to give him the support of his own popularity in&nbsp;Rome. In fact, directly the pair arrived Baroncelli was overthrown, the supremacy of the senate granted to the pope and&nbsp;the government confided to Albornoz, who, without concerning&nbsp;himself with Rienzi, nominated Guido Patrizi as senator. He&nbsp;then marched at the head of his troops against Giovanni, prefect&nbsp;of Vico, and forced him to render stÆmission at Montefiascone&nbsp;on the 5th of June 1354. With the same promptitude and skilT&nbsp;he reduced Umbria and the Tuscan and Sabine districts, consented to leave the privileges of the cities intact in return for&nbsp;their recognition of the papal authority and planted fortresses&nbsp;in suitable positions. In the meantime Rienzi’s popularity was&nbsp;increasing in Rome; without either money or arms, the extribune succeeded by his eloquence in winning over the two&nbsp;Provençal leaders, brothers of the famous free captain Fra&nbsp;Monreale; and, seduced by his promises and hopes, they&nbsp;supplied him with funds. Then, profiting by his prestige, the&nbsp;apparent favour of the pope, and the sums received, he was able&nbsp;to collect a band of five hundred soldiers of mixed nationalities&nbsp;and returned towards Rome. On Monte Mario he was met by&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cavalier otti.</span><span class="font0"> On the 1st of August 1354 he entered the&nbsp;Gastello gate, took possession of the government, named Mon-reale’s two brothers his captains, and sent them to lay siege to&nbsp;Palestrina, which was still the headquarters of the Colonna.&nbsp;But then money ran short, and he again lost his head. Inviting&nbsp;Fra Monreale to a banquet, he put him to death for the sake of&nbsp;his wealth, and kept the two brothers in confinement. This act&nbsp;excited general indignation. And when, after his ill-gotten&nbsp;gains were spent, he again recurred to violence to fill his purse,&nbsp;the public discontent was vented in a sudden revolt on the&nbsp;8th of October. The people stormed the Capitol with cries of&nbsp;“ Death to the traitor.” Rienzi presented himself at a window&nbsp;waving the flag of Rome. But the charm was finally broken.&nbsp;Missiles were hurled at him; the palace was fired. He hid&nbsp;himself in the courtyard, shaved his beard and, disguised as a&nbsp;shepherd with a cloth over his head, slipped into the crowd and&nbsp;joined in their cries against himself. Being recognized, however,&nbsp;by the golden bracelets he had forgotten to remove, he was&nbsp;instantly stabbed. For two days his corpse was left exposed&nbsp;to the insults of the mob, and was then burned. Such was the&nbsp;wretched end of thé&quot; man who, at one moment, seemed destined&nbsp;to fill the world with his name as the regenerator of Rome and&nbsp;of Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In all the Italian cities the overthrow of the aristocracy had led to military impotence and pressing danger of tyranny. The&nbsp;same thing had happened in Rome when the nobility, weakened&nbsp;by the absence of church and empire, received its death-blow</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
