<p><span class="font3">R</span><span class="font1">or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">r,</span><span class="font1"> a liquid consonant, being the seventeenth letter of </span><span class="font2">5 </span><span class="font1">our alphabet. Its sound is formed by a guttural extrusion of breath vibrated through the mouth, with a sort of&nbsp;quivering motion of the tongue drawn from the teeth, and&nbsp;canulated with the tip a little elevated towards the palate. In&nbsp;Greek words it is frequently aspirated with an A after it, as&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rhapsody, rhetoric,</span><span class="font1"> and so forth ; otherwise it is always&nbsp;followed by a vowel at the beginning of words and syllables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the notes of the ancients, R. or RO. signifies </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roma,</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RABBIS, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rabbin,</span><span class="font1"> a title which the Pllarisees and doctors of the law amongst the Jews assumed, and which literally signifies “ masters.” There were several gradations before they arrived at the dignity of rabbin, which was not con- ' ferred until they had acquired the profoundest knowledge of&nbsp;the law and the traditions. It does not, however, appear that&nbsp;there was any fixed age or previous examination necessary ;&nbsp;but when a man had distinguished himself by his skill in&nbsp;the written and traditional law, and passed through the&nbsp;subordinate degrees, he was saluted as rabbi by the public&nbsp;voice. Amongst the modern Jews, for nearly seven hundred years past, the learned men retain no other title than&nbsp;that of rabbin ; they have great respect paid them, and&nbsp;the first places or seats in the synagogues ; they determine all matters of controversy, and frequently pronounce&nbsp;upon civil affairs ; and they have even power to excommunicate the disobedient.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABBINISTS, amongst the modern Jews, an appellation given to the doctrine of the rabbin concerning traditions, in opposition to the Caraites, who reject all traditions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RABELAIS, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dr. Francis,</span><span class="font1"> immortalized by his Romance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua and Pantagruel,</span><span class="font1"> was born at Chinon, a little town of Touraine, in 1483. His father, Thomas&nbsp;Rabelais, is generally understood to have been an apothecary of that town, and proprietor of the farm of La Devi-nière in the neighbourhood, where, it is said, a great part of&nbsp;the romance was written. According to some biographers,&nbsp;however, he was a vintner in Chinon, and kept a cabaret&nbsp;there at the sign of the Lamprey. The probability is, that&nbsp;he combined both occupations, dealing in drugs and spices,&nbsp;“ and other things of great price ;” and also disposing of&nbsp;the wine produced upon his own property, a traffic very&nbsp;different in its nature from that suggested by the modern&nbsp;ideas of an apothecary and keeper of a cabaret. He was&nbsp;unquestionably a man of substance, and able to procure for&nbsp;his son an education of as high a character as was then to&nbsp;be obtained. He sent him to be educated by the monks&nbsp;of Seville, an abbey not far from Chinon, but the boy’s progress under their care was so unpromising, as to occasion his&nbsp;removal to the University of Angers, where he studied for&nbsp;some time at tile convent of La Baumette, but apparently&nbsp;with no greater proficiency than before.
