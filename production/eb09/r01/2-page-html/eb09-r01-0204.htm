<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">shed, cost the nation comparatively little disturbance. Humanism, before it affected the bulk of the English&nbsp;people, had already permeated Italian and French literature. Classical erudition had been adapted to the needs&nbsp;of modern thought. The hard work of collecting, printing, annotating, and translating Greek and Latin authors&nbsp;had been accomplished. The masterpieces of antiquity&nbsp;had been interpreted and made intelligible. Much of the&nbsp;learning popularized by our poets and dramatists was&nbsp;derived at second hand from modern literature. This&nbsp;does not mean that England was deficient in ripe and&nbsp;sound scholars. More, Colet, Ascham, Cheke, Camden&nbsp;were men whose familiarity with the classics was both&nbsp;intimate and easy. Public schools and universities conformed to the modern methods of study; nor were there&nbsp;wanting opportunities for youths of humble origin to&nbsp;obtain an education which placed them on a level with&nbsp;Italian scholars. The single case of Ben Jonson sufficiently proves this. Yet learning did not at this epoch&nbsp;become a marked speciality in England. There was no&nbsp;class corresponding to the humanists. It should also be&nbsp;remembered that the best works of Italian literature were&nbsp;introduced into Great Britain together with the classics.&nbsp;Phaer’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Virgil,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Chapman’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Homer,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Harrington’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orlando,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Marlowe’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hero and Leander,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Fairfax’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jerusalem Delivered,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">North’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Flutarch,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hoby’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Courtier</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—to mention only a few&nbsp;examples—placed English readers simultaneously in possession of the most eminent and representative works of&nbsp;Greece, Rome, and Italy. At the same time Spanish&nbsp;influences reached them through the imitators of Guevara&nbsp;and the dramatists; French influences in the versions of&nbsp;romances; German influences in popular translations of&nbsp;the Faust legend, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eulenspiegel,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and similar productions.&nbsp;The authorized version of the Bible had also been recently&nbsp;given to the people,—so that almost at the same period of&nbsp;time England obtained in the vernacular an extensive&nbsp;library of ancient and modern authors. This was a privilege enjoyed in like measure by no other nation. It sufficiently accounts for the richness and variety of Elizabethan&nbsp;literature, and for the enthusiasm with which the English&nbsp;language was cultivated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Speaking strictly, England borrowed little in the region of the arts from other nations, and developed still less that&nbsp;was original. What is called Jacobean architecture marks&nbsp;indeed an interesting stage in the transition from the&nbsp;Gothic style. But, compared with Italian, French, Spanish,&nbsp;German, and Flemish work of a like period, it is both&nbsp;timid and dry. Sculpture was represented in London for&nbsp;a brief space by Torrigiani; painting by Holbein and&nbsp;Antonio More; music by Italians and Frenchmen of the&nbsp;Chapel Royal. But no Englishmen rose to European&nbsp;eminence in these departments. With literature the case&nbsp;was very different. Wyat and Surrey began by engrafting&nbsp;the forms and graces of Italian poetry upon the native&nbsp;stock. They introduced the sonnet and blank verse.&nbsp;Sidney followed w<sup>r</sup>ith the sestine and terza rima and with&nbsp;various experiments in classic metres, none of which took&nbsp;root on English soil. The translators handled the octave&nbsp;stanza. Marlowe gave new vigour to the couplet. The&nbsp;first period of the English Renaissance was one of imitation and assimilation. Academies after the Italian type&nbsp;were founded. Tragedies in the style of Seneca, rivalling&nbsp;Italian and French dramas of the epoch, were produced.&nbsp;Attempts to Latinize ancestral rhythms, similar to those&nbsp;which had failed in Italy and France, were made. Tentative essays in criticism and dissertations on the art of&nbsp;poetry abounded. It seemed as though the Renaissance&nbsp;ran a risk of being throttled in its cradle by superfluity of&nbsp;foreign and pedantic nutriment. But the natural vigour&nbsp;of the English genius resisted influences alien to itself,&nbsp;and showed a robust capacity for digesting the varied diet&nbsp;offered to it. As there was nothing despotic in the temper&nbsp;of the ruling classes, nothing oppressive in English culture,&nbsp;the literature of that age evolved itself freely from the&nbsp;people. It w<sup>r</sup>as under these conditions that Spenser gave&nbsp;his romantic epic to the world, a poem which derived its&nbsp;allegory from the Middle Ages, its decorative richness&nbsp;from the Italian Renaissance, its sweetness, purity, harmony, and imaginative splendour from the most poetic&nbsp;nation of the modern world. Under the same conditions&nbsp;the Elizabethan drama, which in its totality is the real&nbsp;exponent of the English Renaissance, came into existence.&nbsp;This drama very early freed itself from the pseudo-classic&nbsp;mannerism which imposed on taste in Italy and France.&nbsp;Depicting feudalism in the vivid colours of an age at war&nbsp;with feudal institutions, breathing into antique histories&nbsp;the breath of actual life, embracing the romance of Italy&nbsp;and Spain, the mysteries of German legend, the fictions of&nbsp;poetic fancy and the facts of daily life, humours of the&nbsp;moment and abstractions of philosophical speculation, in&nbsp;one homogeneous amalgam instinct with intense vitality,&nbsp;this extraordinary birth of time, with Shakespeare for the&nbsp;master of all ages, left a monument of the Renaissance&nbsp;unrivalled for pure creative power by any other product&nbsp;of that epoch. To complete the sketch, we must set&nbsp;Bacon, the expositor of modern scientific method, beside&nbsp;Spenser and Shakespeare, as the third representative of&nbsp;the Renaissance in England. Nor should Raleigh, Drake,&nbsp;Hawkins, the semi-buccaneer explorers of the ocean, be&nbsp;omitted. They, following the lead of Portuguese and -Spaniards, combating the Counter-Reformation on the seas, <sup>:&nbsp;</sup>opened for England her career of colonization and planta-,&nbsp;tion. All this while the political policy of Tudors and ,&nbsp;I Stewarts tended towards monarchical absolutism, while&nbsp;the Reformation in England, modified by contact with <sup>1&nbsp;</sup>the Low Countries during their struggles, was narrowing ;&nbsp;into strict reactionary intolerance. Puritanism indicated&nbsp;a revolt of the religious conscience of the nation against!&nbsp;the arts and manners of the Renaissance, against the<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>encroachments of belligerent Catholicism, against the&nbsp;corrupt and Italianated court of James I., against the&nbsp;absolutist pretensions of his son Charles. In its final&nbsp;manifestation during the Commonwealth, Puritanism won&nbsp;a transient victory over the mundane forces of both&nbsp;Reformation and Renaissance, as these had taken shape in&nbsp;England. It also secured the eventual triumph of constitutional independence. Milton, the greatest humanistic&nbsp;poet of the English race, lent his pen and moral energies&nbsp;during the best years of his life to securing that principle&nbsp;on which modern political systems at present rest. Thus&nbsp;the geographical isolation of England, and the comparatively&nbsp;late adoptif^n by the English of matured Italian and German influences, give peculiar complexity to the phenomena&nbsp;of Reformation and Renaissance simultaneously developed&nbsp;on our island. The period of our history between 1536 and&nbsp;1642 shows how difficult it is to separate these two factors&nbsp;in the re-birth of Europe, both of which contributed so&nbsp;powerfully to the formation of modern English nationality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It has been impossible to avoid an air of superficiality, : and the repetition of facts known to every schoolboy, in ]&nbsp;this sketch of so complicated a subject as the Renaissance,— ;&nbsp;embracing many nations, a great variety of topics, and an <sub>(&nbsp;</sub>indefinite period of time. Yet no other treatment was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">\&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">possible upon the lines laid down at the outset, where it ]&nbsp;was explained why the term Renaissance cannot now be <sup>!&nbsp;</sup>confined to the Revival of Learning and the effect of antique&nbsp;studies upon literary and artistic ideals. The purpose of&nbsp;this article has been to show that, wffiile the Renaissance&nbsp;implied a new way of regarding the material world and&nbsp;human nature, a new conception of man’s destiny and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
