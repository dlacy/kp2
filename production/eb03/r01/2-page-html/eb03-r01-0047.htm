He received the ſirſt rudiments of learning at the grammar-ſchool at Braintree ; and in 1644 <sup>was</sup> admitted into Catharine hall&nbsp;in Cambridge, from whence he afterwards removed&nbsp;to Trinity college in that univerſity. He took the degree of maſter of arts, and became at length a ſenior fellow of the college ; but his intenſe application to&nbsp;his ſtudies having injured his health, he was obliged at&nbsp;his leiſure hours to exerciſe himſelf by riding or walking in the fields, which led him to the ſtudy of plants.&nbsp;He noted from Johnſon, Parkinſon, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phytologia&nbsp;Britannica,</span><span class="font1"> the places where curious plants grew ; and&nbsp;in 1658 rode from Cambridge to the city of Cheſter,&nbsp;from whence he went into North wales, viſiting many&nbsp;places, and among others the famous hill of Snowdon ;&nbsp;returning by Shrewſhury and Glouceſter.
