And the Jewish religion was still more extensively introduced, whether by early colonists or proselytes, both into Meroë, the dominions of Queen Candace, and also into the remoter mountains of Abyssinia.</p><p>The Jewish worship had a strange aspect to the surrounding countries of the Gentiles. To their besotted minds it appeared a wonder and an absurdity that a nation should exist without idols.</p><p>Nil præter nubes et coelos numen adorant.</p><p>But although the Jews, as far as we have positive information, made but few converts in their prosperity, they became missionaries as soon as they became captives ; and the Israelitish maid who directed Naaman the Syrian for a cure to consult the prophet of her country, indicates to us the way in which a large accession was made from amongst the Gentiles to the true worshippers of Jehovah.</p><p>We are better acquainted with the removal of the Jews to the east than with the dispersion on a smaller scale which was taking place towards the west, where the Phtcnicians were selling the Jewish captives to the isles of the Gentiles or the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. We have even in the case of Jonah an instance of a Jew attempting voluntarily to expatriate himself in a Phcenician vessel to Tarshish ; the Tarshish doubtless of the far west, not the Tarsus of Cilicia, but the Tartessus of Spain.</p><p>It is striking to observe how the great bulk of the Jewish nation were subsequently dispersed throughout those very tracts which war and commerce opened up in the remotest periods of history ; and how much more their misfortunes have contributed to the success of their tenets than the victories of their ancient kings. The moral influence of the Jewish nation appears to have reached its greatest height when their civil power was on tlιe eve of vanishing, about the time of our Saviour. Dissatisfied with their own sentiments of belief, many in the countries of Greece and Rome were looking to the East, their original instructress, for a deeper philosophy and a more venerable religion ; and whilst many were only the more bewildered amongst the mysteries of eastern superstition, in the case of others the pursuit was not fruitless, for they had revealed to them “ whatever Moses had handed down in his dark volume.”</p><p>The influence which the Jews were acquiring is strongly indicated in the jocular excuse which Horace’s friend makes him for not entering upon any business, because it was the “ thirtieth Sabbatlfof the Jews, Ortheirsolemn passover; and in the support which the Jews received from “ devout and honourable women not a few” throughout the Roman empire, including sometimes, as in the instance of Poppæa, the empress herself.</p><p>The progress of early Christianity is wonderful, and becomes the more so in proportion as we narrowly inspect the agency by which that progress was carried on. To obtain a just view, we should not dwell too much on the activity of a few, and too little on the backwardness of the many. The first Christians, with some rare exceptions, were men of like passions and of like failings with ourselves. The apostles and disciples had received a command, “ Go and baptize all nations,” without (as far as appears by the record) taking one step to put it into execution. The first missionaries were those involuntary labourers who were driven by persecution to Antioch, in answer to that early petition, “ Pray ye the Lord of the harvest, that He would thrust forth labourers into His harvest.” Still the work was proceeding slowly till Paul appeared, and then, as Christian churches are compared to lights shedding their salutary effulgence over the dangers of the deep, a hundred beacons seemed at once enkindled along every cape and headland, to guide the mariner bewildered on his darksome way.</p><p>Christianity, as planted by Paul, took the shortest course to become universal. It followed the line of greatest communication, and took up a position in each of the principal cities ; from thence, as from new centres, to spread its influence over the surrounding country. Its success was various in various places ; slow where the population was remote, scattered, and barbarous ; rapid where it was condensed and civilized. It had nearly attained an early predominance in the most refined region of the earth, that of Asia Minor ; and had it not been immediately checked by the dread and majesty of the empire, and by an early persecution, which showed how different nominal adherents are from real friends whenever a day of trial arrives, its supremacy would have been complete.</p><p>It deserves to be remarked, that it was not only by means of the Greek language, but of the Greek race, that Christianity was speedily diffused. To the east of the Roman empire it had its chief seats in the Grecian colonies, reduced indeed under the Parthian sway, but still spirited and intelligent ; and still in its farther progress it kept in the line of the same pre-eminent race, and sprung out again with fresh vigour in the Bactrian regions, where the Greeks, after Alexander, had been extending a kingdom that at one period promised to subjugate the East. From thence Christianity penetrated into China and into Tartary, and, from its ancient success in these quarters, kept in suspense the emperors who wielded the sceptre of Zengis, whether they should desolate the world with the sword in one hand, and the Koran or the Bible in the other.</p><p>Much more might have been expected of the popes, for the diffusion, if not of religion, at least of tenets that were favourable to their own interest and sovereignty, than was actually performed by them. Their attention was too much distracted by the quarrels of nominal Christendom, and the more tempting opportunities of increasing their power at home at the expense of Christian kings, to enable them to look steadily and far abroad, or to form any settled plan for extending their spiritual dominion over foreign nations. Another obstacle presented itself, the Papists were inferior in knowledge to the Moslem; the Greek church might boast of some superior civilization ; but the Franks were despiscd by the Saracens for their ignorance and barbarity, as well as held in abomination for their gross idolatry. Their missions therefore were there chiefly confined to tribes of kindred and German origin, whose conversion was facilitated by the greater number of their own tongue and blood having already submitted to the papal sway.</p><p>But if the ,popes did little in comparison with their resources, individuals did much. The mission of St Patrick to Ireland may compare in zeal and in success w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>ith whatever had been undertaken for the spread of Christianity since the times of Constantine ; and its effects were not confined to Ireland, but spread over Scotland and the north of England, and reached even to Germany. The popes, indeed, when aroused by the fear of a Tartar invasion, despatched an ill-contrived and hopeless mission to the sovereigns of Tartary, in order to avert the danger which threatened Europe, by converting them ; but any real and disinterested zeal throughout the dark ages is chiefly to be found in individuals, who, like the ingenious but fantastical Raymond Lully, were meditating plans for extending religion whilst the rest of the Christian world were careless and asleep.</p><p>The Reformation gave a revival to Popery itself ; and as the Carthaginians sought to regain the resources which they had lost nearer home by founding a new empire in Spain, so the Roman Catholics endeavoured to counterbalance the loss of the third of Europe by extending the spiritual dominions of the church over the regions of the boundless and populous East. Of the Jesuits, with Bacon, regarding their talents and unwearied application, we can only speak with</p></body></text></TEI>
