<p><span class="font0">Newport, which shares metropolitan honours with the capital, being the seat of government every alternate session, is beautifully situated on the south-west end of the&nbsp;island of Rhode Island, five miles from the sea, and in&nbsp;latitude 4L 29. north, and longitude 71. 21. west. The&nbsp;town lies north and south, upon a gradual ascent east from&nbsp;the water, and exhibits a beautiful view from the harbour&nbsp;and the neighbouring hills. The principal street is more&nbsp;than a mile in length. The harbour, which spreads westward in front of the town, is one of the finest in the world,&nbsp;and spacious enough to allow a large fleet to anchor and&nbsp;ride in perfect security. The entrance is safe and easy,&nbsp;and it is defended by three strong forts. Newport contains&nbsp;a state-house, a jail, several banks and insurance offices, a&nbsp;valuable public library, and houses of worship for most of&nbsp;the religious denominations that are found in New England. A very elegant building is appropriated to the library. This town is famous for the salubrity of its climate,&nbsp;and more noted than any other American town for the variety and excellence of its fresh fish. Newport was first&nbsp;settled in 1636, and before the American revolution had&nbsp;attained to considerable commercial importance. During&nbsp;that war it suffered severely, being for a long time occupied by the British. It maintains some trade with the East&nbsp;Indies, Europe, and Cuba ; but the most important branch&nbsp;of its commerce is the coasting trade with the middle and&nbsp;southern states. Its fisheries are very valuable. The population of Newport in 1839 may be estimated at about&nbsp;10,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pawtucket is a flourishing town, partly situated in that part of this state called North Providence, partly in Massachusetts. It is noted for the number and extent of its&nbsp;manufactories, which are situated near a fine cascade on the&nbsp;river Pawtucket. This town contains several public buildings, two or three banks, more than twelve cotton factories,&nbsp;and as many others of different kinds. This is reckoned&nbsp;one of the most flourishing manufacturing villages in the&nbsp;United States. The population may be about 5000. Bristol is a neat commercial town, situated on the east side of&nbsp;Narragansett Bay. It has a safe and commodious harbour,&nbsp;owns a good deal of shipping, and is a place of considerable&nbsp;trade. The population at present ( 1839) may be about 4000.&nbsp;Warren, South Kingston, East Greenwich, Smithfield,&nbsp;Portsmouth, and Warwick, are the only other places of&nbsp;any note. The last-named town contains above 6000 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The settlement of this state was commenced at Providence in the year 1636, by Roger Williams, a person of some celebrity in the annals of America. He was banished&nbsp;from Massachusetts on account of the religious doctrines&nbsp;which he preached. Two years afterwards the settlement&nbsp;of the island of Rhode Island was begun. In 1643 Williams went to England, and in the following year obtained&nbsp;a charter by which Rhode Island and Providence Plantations were united under one government. This writ continued in force till 1663, when a new charter was granted&nbsp;by Charles II., and this document has ever since formed the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">basis of the government. This state is the only one in the Union which is without a written constitution, according to&nbsp;the American form of these things. The legislative power&nbsp;is vested in a general assembly, consisting of a senate and&nbsp;a house of representatives. The latter consists of seventy-two members, six from Newport, four from each of the&nbsp;towns of Providence, Portsmouth, and Warwick, and two&nbsp;from each of the other towns in the state. They are elected&nbsp;semi-annually in April and August. The senate consists&nbsp;of ten members, who are elected annually in April. The&nbsp;executive power is vested in a governor ; and a lieutenant-governor is elected along with him, on whom the duties of&nbsp;the executive devolve in case of the office of governor being vacated. The other officers of government are a secretary of state, a treasurer, and an attorney-general. The&nbsp;general assembly meets four times a year; at Newport on&nbsp;the first Wednesday in May, at the same place in June ;&nbsp;at Providence and South Kingston alternately in October;&nbsp;and in January at East Greenwich, Bristol, or Providence.&nbsp;The judiciary power is vested in a supreme court, and a&nbsp;court of common pleas for each of the five counties. AU&nbsp;the judges are appointed annually by the general assembly. A chief justice and two associate justices preside in&nbsp;the supreme court. Each of the courts of common pleas&nbsp;comprises five judges. Rhode Island has a well-constituted militia force, which is called out for duty twice a&nbsp;year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(r. r. r.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RHODES, an island celebrated from the remotest antiquity as the seat of commerce and of naval power, as well as of literature and the arts ; but now reduced from its ancient splendour to a state of extreme depression and poverty, by the devastations of war and the tyranny of its&nbsp;Turkish rulers. It is situated in the Mediterranean, near&nbsp;the coast of Asia Minor, and is about twelve leagues long&nbsp;from north to south, and about six broad. It is of a triangular form ; and its circumference is commonly estimated at about forty-four leagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The island is diversified in its surface, and contains in its centre an elevated mountain named Artemira<sub>1</sub> which&nbsp;commands a view of the whole island. It is so steep that&nbsp;it is impossible to ascend it on horseback, and a person&nbsp;clambering up on foot would not be able to reach the summit in less than four hours. From this height there is a most&nbsp;extensive prospect of the whole island around its base ; of&nbsp;the elevated coast of Caramania on the north ; on the northwest the Archipelago, studded with its numerous islands ; on&nbsp;the south-west is seen Mount Ida, veiled in clouds ; and&nbsp;on the south and south-east the vast expanse of waters which&nbsp;wash the African shore. Here and there on the island are&nbsp;seen ranges of moderately elevated hills, on which are found&nbsp;numbers of ancient pines, planted by the hand of nature :&nbsp;these forests were formerly very thick, but they are now&nbsp;greatly thinned by the Turks, who cut them down, and take&nbsp;no care to plant others in their place. On the farther side of&nbsp;this nearest range of hills the surface of the island falls&nbsp;lower, and several hills in the form of amphitheatres extend&nbsp;their bases as far as the sea. In more than half the island</span></p>
