 (1756-1813), Prussian general, celebrated as the author of the so-called “ Krümpersystem,” or short-service system (see vol. ii. p. 594), by which the Prussian nation was prepared for the war of liberation, was a Hanoverian by birth, and served in the Hanoverian army from 1778 to 1801, when he passed into Prussian service, and soon became the leader in the reconstruction of its forces. In the war with France in 1813 he accompanied Blücher as ,</p><p>chief of the general staff, but received a severe wound in the first battle (Grossgörschen), which soon after was followed by his death.
