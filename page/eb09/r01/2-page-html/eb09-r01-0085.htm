<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">abundant mucilaginous slime, and by taking up oxygen it acquires a peculiar disagreeable odour and an acrid taste.&nbsp;Refined by </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ordinary processes (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Oils, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xvii. p.&nbsp;743), the oil assumes a clear golden yellow colour. In&nbsp;specific gravity it ranges between 09112־ and 09117־ in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">raw state, and from 09127־ to 09136־ when refined;&nbsp;the solidifying point is from - </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2° </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to - 10’ C. Rape oil&nbsp;consists of a mixture of three simple fats or glycerides of&nbsp;fatty acids—the glyceride of oleic acid (olein), of stearic acid&nbsp;(stearin), and of brassic acid, the latter being a fat found&nbsp;hitherto only in oils from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Crucifei'se</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and from grape&nbsp;seeds. The olein of rape oil differs from ordinary olein&nbsp;in not yielding sebacylic acid on destructive distillation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The principal uses of rape oil are for lubrication and lighting; but since the introduction of mineral oils for both these purposes&nbsp;the importance of rape has considerably decreased. It is but little&nbsp;employed in soap-making, as it saponifies with difficulty and yields&nbsp;only an indifferent product. In Germany it is very considerably&nbsp;used as a salad oil under the name of Schmalzöl, being for that&nbsp;purpose freed from its biting taste by being mixed with starch,&nbsp;heated till the starch is carbonized, and filtered after the oil has&nbsp;cooled. The offensive taste of rape oil may also be removed by&nbsp;treatment with a small proportion of sweet spirit of nitre (nitrous&nbsp;ether). In the East Indies rape oil and its equivalents, known&nbsp;under various names, are the most important of oils for native use.&nbsp;They are largely consumed as food instead of ghi under the name&nbsp;of “ metali ” or sweet oil, but for all other purposes the same sub-stance is known as “kurwah” or bitter oil. Most natives prefer it&nbsp;for the preparation of their curries and other hot dishes. Rape oil&nbsp;is the subject of extensive adulteration, principally with the cheaper&nbsp;hemp oil, rosin oil, and mineral oils. These sophistications can be&nbsp;most conveniently detected, first by taste and next by saponifica-tion, rosin oil and mineral oil remaining unsaponified, hemp oil&nbsp;giving a greenish soap, while rape oil yields a soap with a yellow&nbsp;tinge. With concentrated sulphuric acid, fuming nitric acid,&nbsp;nitrous acid, and other reagents rape oil gives also characteristic&nbsp;colorations ; but these are modified according to the degree of&nbsp;purity of the oil itself. The presence of sulphur in rape and other&nbsp;cruciferous oils also affords a ready means for their identification.&nbsp;Lead plaster </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(emplastrum lithargyri)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> boiled in rape oil dissolves,&nbsp;and, sulphide of lead being formed, the oil becomes brown or black.&nbsp;Other lead compounds give the same black coloration from the&nbsp;formation of sulphide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAPHAEL (רפאל, “ God heals ”) first appears in litera-ture in the book of Tobit, where in human disguise and under the name of Azarias (“ God helps ”) he accompanies&nbsp;Tobias in his adventurous journey and conquers the demon&nbsp;Asmodaeus. He is said to be “one of the seven angels&nbsp;[archangels] who present the prayers of the saints and&nbsp;enter into the presence of the glory of the Holy One.” In&nbsp;the book of Enoch Raphael is the angel of the spirits of&nbsp;man, and it is his business to gather the souls of the dead&nbsp;in the place where they are reserved till the day of judg-ment,—a conception which seems to imply a derivation&nbsp;from רפאים, “ghosts.” In later Midrash Raphael appears&nbsp;as the angel commissioned to put down the evil spirits that&nbsp;vexed the sons of Noah with plagues and sicknesses after&nbsp;the flood, and he it was who taught men the use of simples&nbsp;and furnished materials for the “Book of Noah,” the&nbsp;earliest treatise on materia medica (Rönsch, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Buch der&nbsp;Jubiläen</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, p. 385 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sq.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAPHAEL (1483-1520). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Raphael Sanzio </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">was the son of Giovanni Santi, a painter of some repute in the ducal&nbsp;city of Urbino, situated among the Apennines on the&nbsp;borders of Tuscany and Umbria.@@<sup>1</sup> For many years both&nbsp;before and after the birth of Raphael the city of Urbino was&nbsp;one of the chief centres in Italy of intellectual and artistic&nbsp;activity, thanks to its highly cultured rulers, Duke Federigo&nbsp;II. of Montefeltro and his son Guidobaldo, who succeeded&nbsp;him in 1482,@@<sup>2</sup> the year before Raphael was born. The ducal</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">residence of Urbino, built by Federigo II., even now one of the most magnificent palaces in Italy, was lavishly&nbsp;adorned with works of art of every class—frescos, panel-pictures, tapestries, tarsia-work, stucco-reliefs, and sculpture—executed for the duke by some of the chief Italian&nbsp;artists of his time, and contained a collection of oil-paintings&nbsp;by the Van Eycks and other celebrated Flemish painters.&nbsp;Giovanni Santi was a welcome guest at this miniature but&nbsp;splendid court, and the rich treasures which the palace&nbsp;contained, familiar to Raphael from his earliest years,&nbsp;were a very important item among the various influences&nbsp;which formed and fostered his early love for art. It may&nbsp;not perhaps be purely fanciful to trace Raphael’s boyish&nbsp;admiration of the oil-paintings of Jan Van Eyck and Justus&nbsp;of Ghent in the miniature-like care and delicacy with&nbsp;which some of his earliest works, such as the Knight’s&nbsp;Dream, were executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Though Raphael lost his father at the age of eleven, yet to him he certainly owed a great part of that early&nbsp;training which enabled him to produce paintings of apparently mature beauty when he was scarcely twenty years of&nbsp;age. From his father, too, Raphael learned much of the&nbsp;religious sentiment and grace of motive which are specially&nbsp;conspicuous in his earlier paintings. The altar-piece&nbsp;painted by Giovanni for the church of Gradara, and a&nbsp;fresco, now preserved in the Santi house@@<sup>3</sup> at Urbino, are&nbsp;clearly prototypes of some of Raphael’s most graceful&nbsp;paintings of the Madonna and Child. On the death of his&nbsp;father in 1494 young Raphael was left in the care of his&nbsp;stepmother (his own mother, Magia Ciarla, having died&nbsp;in 1491) and of his uncle, a priest called Bartolomeo.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">First or Perugian Period</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—In what year Raphael was apprenticed to Perugino and how the interval before that&nbsp;was spent are matters of doubt. Vasari’s statement that&nbsp;he was sent to Perugia during his father’s lifetime is certainly a mistake. On the whole it appears most probable&nbsp;that he did not enter Perugino’s studio till the end of&nbsp;1499, as during the four or five years before that Perugino&nbsp;was mostly absent from his native city.@@<sup>5</sup> As was the case&nbsp;with every one with whom Raphael came in contact, the&nbsp;Perugian master was fascinated by the charm of his manner&nbsp;and delighted by his precocious ability, and seems to have&nbsp;devoted special pains to his artistic education. The so-called&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sketch Book of Raphael</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the academy of Venice contains&nbsp;studies apparently from the cartoons of some of Perugino’s&nbsp;Sistine frescos, possibly done as practice in drawing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">This celebrated collection of thirty drawings, now framed or preserved in portfolios, bears signs of having once formed a bound&nbsp;book, and has been supposed to be a sketch-book filled by Raphael&nbsp;during his Perugian apprenticeship. Many points, however, make&nbsp;this tempting hypothesis very improbable ; the fact that the drawings were not all originally on leaves of the same size, and the&nbsp;miscellaneous character of the sketches—varying much both in&nbsp;style and merit of execution—seem to show that it is a collection&nbsp;of studies by different hands, made and bound together by some&nbsp;subsequent owner, and may contain but very few drawings by&nbsp;Raphael himself.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Before long Raphael appears to have been admitted to take a share in the execution of paintings by his master;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
