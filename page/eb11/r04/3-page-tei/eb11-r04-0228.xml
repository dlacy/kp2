The Lancastrians, and the king with them, marched out of London to meet them, and the two small armies (3000 Yorkists, 2000 Lancastrians) met at St Albans (May 22, 1455). The encounter ended with the dispersion of the weaker force, and the king fell into the hands of the Yorkists. Four years passed before the next important battle, Blore Heath, was fought (Sept. 23, 1459)· I<hi rend="sup">n</hi> this the earl of Salisbury trapped a Lancastrian army in unfavourable ground near Alarket Drayton, and destroyed it; but new political combinations rendered the Yoikist victory useless and sent the leaders of the party into exile. They made a fresh attempt in 1460, and, thanks partly to treason in the Lancastrian camp, partly to the generalship of Warwick, won an important success and for the second time seized the king at Northampton (July 10, 1460). Shortly afterwards, after a period of negotiation and threats, there was a fresh conflict.<hi rend="underline">Richard</hi>  duke of York went north to fight the hostile army which gathered at York and consisted of Lancashire and Midland Royalists, while his son Edward, earl of March, went into the west. The father was ambushed and killed at Wakefield (Dec. 30, 1460), and the Lancastrians, inspired as always by Queen Margaret of Anjou, moved south on London, defeated Warwick at St Albans (Feb. 17, 1461), and regained possession of the king’s person. But the young earl of M<hi rend="underline">arc</hi>h, now duke of York, having raised an army in the west,"defeated the earl of Pembroke (Feb. 2, 1461) at Mortimer’s Cross (5 m. W. of Leominster). This was the first battle of the war which was characterized by the massacre of the common folk and beheading of the captive gentlemen— invariable accompaniments of Edward’s victories, and conspicuously absent in Warwick’s. Edward then pressed on, joined Warwick, and entered London, the army of Margaret retreating before them. The excesses of the northern Lancastrians in their advance produced bitter fruit on the retreat, for men flocked to Edward’s standard. Alarching north in pursuit, the Yorkists brought their enerriy to bay at Towtbn <hi rend="italic">(q.vf,</hi>  3 m. S. of Tadcaster, and utterly destroyed them (March 29, 1461). For three years after Towton the war consisted merely of desultory local struggles of small bodies of Lancastrians against the inevitable. The duke of York had become King Edward IV., and.had established himself firmly. But in 1464, in the far north of England, the Red Rose was again in the field. Edward acted with his usual decision. His lieutenant Montagu (Warwick’s brother) defeated and slew Sir Ralph Percy at Hedgley Aloor, near Wooler (April 25, 1464), and immediately afterwards destroyed another Lancastrian army, with which were both Henry VI. and Queen Margaret, at Hexham (Alay 8, 1464).    The massacres and executions</p><p>which followed effectively crushed the revolt. <hi rend="underline">For some </hi>^years <hi rend="underline">thereafter Edward reigned peacefully, but Warwick </hi>JjTgHrfITg-Ina<hi rend="underline">ker and aJL</hi>thp Nevil<hi rend="underline">le </hi><hi rend="underline">following</hi>having Turned Iw<hi rend="underline">was dri</hi>ven into exilêT <hi rend="bold">But a I-</hi>able momentLfife<hi rend="sup">aw</hi><hi rend="underline">SSiretL</hi>f<hi rend="underline">rom ^lii</hi>shni<hi rend="underline">g<hi rend="sup">w</hi>Wlth</hi>  ’ 1500 retainers andH Burgu^<hi rend="underline">dianjfl^c^</hi>^ies<hi rend="underline">^and </hi><hi rend="underline">eluding</hi><hi rend="underline">Th^lZng^sni</hi>aSLlle^t and H^re^^Selgägc-'l^opsflandedTt Ravenspur ^SptrrirItettTXl rT ^<hi rend="underline">Yorkshfie</hi>  niHVÏaftrfl <hi rend="smallcaps">i4';h</hi>—H<hi rend="underline">js "f</hi>01 ce TvaT hardly Iflore than a bö<hi rend="underline">dyguäfdpt</hi>hegates of the to<hi rend="underline">wns~ were</hi>  shut against Ihifn, and tEe country people lied. But by Eî^personal· charm, diplomacy, fair promises Ttnd an oath of allegiance to King Henry VI., sworn solemnly at York, he disarmed hostility and, eluding Montagu’s army, reached his own estates in the Wakefield district, where many of his old retainers joined him. As</p><p>@@@ The name, as is well known, comes from the “ white rose of York ” and the “ red rose of Lancaster ” ; but these badges, though more or less recognized as party distinctions, by no means superseded the private devices of the various great lords, such as the “falcon and fetterlock ” of Richard duke of York, the “ rose in sun ’’ of Edward IV., the “ crowned swan ” of Margaret, the Vere star, and even the revived “ white hart ” of Richard II.</p><lb/><p>he advanced south, a few Yorkist nobles with their following rallied to him, but it was far more the disunion of the Warwick and the real Lancastrian parties than his own strength which enabled him to meet Warwick’s forces in a pitched battle. At Bamet, on Easter Eve, April 14, 1471, the decisive engagement was fought. But in the midst of the battle reinforcements coming up under the earl of Oxford to join Warwick came into conflict with their own party, the badge of the Vere star being mistaken for Edward’s <hi rend="italic">Rose-en-soleil.</hi>  From that point all the mutually distrustful elements of Warwick’s army fell apart, and Warwick himself, with his brother Montagu, was slain. For the last time the unhappy Henry VI. fell into the hands of his enemies. He was relegated to the Tower, and Edward, disbanding his army, reoccupied the throne. But Alargaret of Anjou, his untiring opponent, who had been in France while her cause and Warwick’s was being lost, had landed in the west shortly after Barnet, and Edward had to take the field at once. Assembling a fresh army at Windsor, whence he could march to interpose between AIargaret and her north Welsh allies, or directly bar her road to London, he marched into the west on the 24th of April. On the 29th he was at Ciiencester, AIargaret, engaged chiefly in recruiting an army, near Bath. Edw’ard hurried on, but Margaret eluded him and marched for Gloucester. · At that place the governor refused the Lancastrians admittance, and seeking to cross the Severn out of reach of the Yorkists, they pushed on by forced marches to Tewkesbury. But Edward too knew how to march, and caught them up. The battle of Tewkesbury (May 4,1471) ended with the destruction of Margaret’s force, the captivity of Alargaret, the death of her son Edward (who, it is sometimes said, was stabbed by Edward IV. himself after the battle) and the execution of sixteen of the principal Lancastrians.</p><p>This was Edward’s last battle. The rest of his eventful reign was similar in many ways to that of his contemporary Louis XI., being devoted to the consolidation of his power, by fair means and foul, at the expense of the great feudatories. But the Wars of the Roses were not yet at an end. For fourteen years, except for local outbreaks, the land had peace, and then kichard III.’s crown, struck from his head on Bosworth Field (Aug. 22, 1485), was presented to Henry earl of Richmond, who, as Henry VII., established the kingship on a secure foundation. A last feeble attempt to renew the war, made by an army gathered to uphold the pretender Lambert Simnel, was crushed by Henry VII. at Stoke Field (4 m. S.W. of Newark) on the 16th of June 1487.</p><p>ROSETTA (Coptic <hi rend="italic">Rashit,</hi>  Arabic <hi rend="italic">RashlA), a.</hi>  town situated at the western or “ Rosetta ” mouth of the Nile on the west bank. It was called Bolbitine by the Greeks, but according to Herodotus the Bolbitine mouth was artificial, and it was evidently of little importance compared with the Canopic, Sebennytic and Pelusiac mouths. AVhen the other branches and the Alexandria canal silted up, Rosetta prospered like its sister port of Damietta on the eastern branch; the main trade of the overland route to India passed through it until Alehemet Ali cut a new canal joining Alexandria to the Nile. Rosetta is now much decayed. Its population in 1907 was 16,810, almost entirely Mussulman. A railway joins it to Alexandria. The celebrated Rosetta Stone which supplied Champollion with the key for the decipherment of the ancient monuments of Egypt was found near Fort St Julien, 4 m. N. of the town, in 1799, by Boussard, a French officer. It is a basalt stele inscribed in hieroglyphic, demotic and Greek with a decree of the priests assembled at Alemphis in favour of Ptolemy V. Epiphanes. It was ceded to the English at the capitulation of Alexandria (1801) and is now in the British Aluseum.
