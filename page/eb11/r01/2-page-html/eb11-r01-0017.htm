<p><span class="font0">above the board but on or below the service-line, in which case it is called a “ cut ”; or (2) touches the floor on the first bound,&nbsp;outside the proper service-court, when it is called “ short ” or&nbsp;“ fault ” according to the position of its pitch (see below). If&nbsp;the “ hand-out ” player to whom the fault is served “ takes ”&nbsp;it (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i e.</span><span class="font0"> if he plays at it), the fault is condoned and the play&nbsp;proceeds as if the serve had been good. If, however, the fault&nbsp;be not taken, the server must serve again from the same box;&nbsp;and if he serves a second fault he loses his “ hand ” or innings,&nbsp;and his partner or his opponent, as the case may be, takes his&nbsp;place. Two consecutive faults have thus the same result as the&nbsp;loss of a stroke in the rally by the “ hand-in. ” A serve which&nbsp;makes the ball strike the board, or the floor before reaching the&nbsp;front wall, or which sends it “ out-of-court ” (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> into the gallery&nbsp;or roof of the court), counts the same as two consecutive faults;&nbsp;it costs the server his innings. Skill in service is a most important part of proficiency in racquets; a player can hardly&nbsp;become first-rate unless he possesses a “ strong service. ” As&nbsp;in tennis a great deal of “ cut ’’ may be imparted to the ball by&nbsp;the stroke of the racquet, which makes the ball in its rebound&nbsp;from the wall behave like a billiard ball carrying “ side ” when&nbsp;striking a cushion; and when this “ cut ” is combined with&nbsp;great pace in the bound of the ball off the side wall, the back&nbsp;wall, and the floor, at varying angles which the server has to a&nbsp;great degree under his control, it becomes exceedingly difficult&nbsp;for hand-out to “ get up ” the serve (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> to hit it on the first&nbsp;bound, sending it above the play-line on the back wall), and&nbsp;still more so to make a good stroke which will render it difficult&nbsp;for his adversary in his turn to get up the ball and thus continue&nbsp;the rally. It often happens, therefore, that a long sequence of&nbsp;aces, sometimes the whole 15 aces of a game, are scored consecutively by service which hand-out is unable to return. A&nbsp;noteworthy instance of successful service occurred in the semifinal tie of the doubles Amateur Championship matches at the&nbsp;Queen’s Club in 1897 when W. L. Foster opened service and&nbsp;scored all the aces in the first two games, and added six in the&nbsp;third, thus putting on a sequence of 36 aces before losing his&nbsp;“ hand. ” To obtain first innings is therefore an initial advantage,&nbsp;although in doubles it is limited by the rule that only one partner&nbsp;shall have a “ hand ” (innings) in the opening service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The question which side shall have this advantage is decided by spinning a racquet, the “ rough ” and “ smooth ” sides of&nbsp;which take the place of “ heads ” and “ tails ” when a coin is&nbsp;tossed. The side winning the spin opens the game by serving as&nbsp;described above. The server may begin in either of the service&nbsp;boxes; but when he has started, the service must proceed from&nbsp;the two boxes alternately till the close of the innings of the&nbsp;side, whether singles or doubles. When the other side obtains&nbsp;the innings they may in like manner begin in either box, without&nbsp;regard to where the last service of their opponents was delivered.&nbsp;In singles, hand-out changes sides in the court after each serve,&nbsp;answering to the change over of the server; in doubles the serve&nbsp;is taken alternately by the two hand-out players, who permanently occupy the right- and left-hand courts respectively, being&nbsp;allowed to change the order in which they receive the service&nbsp;only once in any game, or at the end of any game or rubber.&nbsp;Except in the very rare case of left-handed players most of the&nbsp;play in the left half of the court, including the taking of all&nbsp;service on that side, is back-handed; and the stronger of the&nbsp;two partners in back-hand play usually therefore takes the&nbsp;left-hand court. The best position in the court for the hand-out&nbsp;about to take the serve depends entirely on the nature of the&nbsp;service, and he has to use his judgment the instant the ball&nbsp;leaves the server’s racquet in order to determine where it will&nbsp;strike the floor and at what precise point in its course it will be&nbsp;best for him to attempt to take it. A strong fast service,&nbsp;heavily cut, that sends the ball darting round the corner of the&nbsp;court, leaving the back wall at an extremely acute angle, or&nbsp;dropping almost dead off it, can only be got up by standing near&nbsp;the back wall a long way across the court and taking the ball by&nbsp;a wrist stroke at the last instant before it falls to the ground a&nbsp;second time. On the other hand when the server avoids the&nbsp;side wall altogether and strikes the back wall direct and hard,&nbsp;whether he achieves a “ nick ” serve </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i. e.</span><span class="font0"> the ball striking&nbsp;precisely in the angle between the back wall and the floor) or&nbsp;hits the wall high up, hand-out will have little time to spare in&nbsp;changing position to get within reach of the ball. Some good&nbsp;players make a practice wherever possible, especially in the case&nbsp;of heavily cut service, of taking the serve on the volley (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font0">&nbsp;before the ball reaches the ground), sometimes of taking the ball&nbsp;after it leaves the side wall and before it reaches the back wall;&nbsp;practice alone enables the player to decide with the necessary&nbsp;promptitude how each stroke is to be played. In returning&nbsp;the serve, or in playing any stroke during the rally, the ball may&nbsp;strike any of the other walls before the front wall; but though&nbsp;this “ boasted ” stroke is quite legitimate, and is sometimes&nbsp;the only way of getting up a difficult ball, it is not considered&nbsp;good style deliberately to slash the ball round the corners in&nbsp;order to keep it in the fore end of the court. Good play consists&nbsp;for the most part in hard low hitting, especially as close as&nbsp;possible along the side walls into the corners of the back wall.&nbsp;One of the most effective strokes in racquets is the “ drop, ”&nbsp;which means that the ball is hit so that it only just reaches the&nbsp;front wall and drops close to it, while the player conceals his&nbsp;intention by appearing to strike hard. “ The drop-stroke, ”&nbsp;says Mr Eustace Miles, who regrets that it is less cultivated than&nbsp;formerly, “ is one of the most beautiful, and of all drop-strokes,&nbsp;the volley or half-volley is the best. ” The “ half-volley, ” in&nbsp;which the ball is struck at the moment of its contact with the&nbsp;floor and before it has had time to rise, is also employed with&nbsp;great effect in hard play; it makes the return much quicker&nbsp;than when the ball is allowed to rise to the full length of the&nbsp;bound, and requires corresponding quickness on the part of&nbsp;the adversary. It sometimes happens, too, that the player&nbsp;finding himself too near the pitch of the ball to take it at the end&nbsp;of the bound, yet not near enough to volley it, is compelled to&nbsp;take it on the half-volley as the only chance of getting it up.&nbsp;Accuracy in volleying and half-volleying, especially if the ball be&nbsp;kept low, is a most difficult art to acquire, but a good long rally&nbsp;in which are included a number of hard rapid half-volleys within a&nbsp;couple of inches of the board, is the prettiest feature of the game.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If hand-out succeeds in returning the serve, the rally proceeds until one side or the other fails to make a good return. A good return means (1) that the ball is struck by the racquet&nbsp;before its second bound on the floor, and without its having&nbsp;touched any part of the clothes or person of the striker or his&nbsp;partner; (2) that it is hit against the front wall above the&nbsp;board without first touching the floor or going out of court;&nbsp;and (3) that it returns off the front wall into play (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> to the&nbsp;floor of the court or to an adversary’s racquet) without going&nbsp;out of court. If hand-in be the one to fail in making a good&nbsp;return, he loses his “ hand, ” or innings, and (in singles) hand-out goes in and proceeds to serve; in doubles one of the hand-in partners loses his “ hand, ” and the second partner goes in&nbsp;and serves till he in turn similarly loses his “ hand, ” except&nbsp;that in the case of the opening service in the game there is&nbsp;(as already mentioned) only one “ hand ’’ in any event. If&nbsp;hand-out fails to make a good return to the serve or to any&nbsp;stroke in the rally, hand-in scores an ace, and the side that&nbsp;first scores 15 aces wins the game. When, however, the score&nbsp;reaches “ 13-all ” (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> when each side has scored 13 aces), handout may, before the next serve is delivered, declare that he&nbsp;elects to “ set ” the game either to 5 or 3, whichever he prefers;&nbsp;and similarly when the score stands at “ 14-all, ” hand-out may&nbsp;“ set ” the game to 3. He makes this declaration by calling&nbsp;“set-5!” or “set-3! ” and it means that 5 aces, or 3 aces,&nbsp;as the case may be, shall be required to win the game.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the confined space of a racquet court it is not always easy, especially in doubles, for the players to avoid obstructing&nbsp;each other. It is provided in the rules that “ each player&nbsp;must get out of his opponents’ way as much as possible, ” and&nbsp;that it shall be a “ let ” (an Old English word for impediment&nbsp;or hindrance) and “ the service or rally shall count for nothing,&nbsp;and the server shall serve again from the same service-box,</span></p>
