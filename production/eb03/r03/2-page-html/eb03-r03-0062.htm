<p><span class="font0">whoſe ſkin Pluto had cauſed to be taken off, and ſtretched out on the ſeat in the bench. This ſatirej joined to the ſecret machinations of enemies, rendered all the&nbsp;attempts of his friends to procure his return abortive.&nbsp;After having ſtaid three months at Paris, he returned&nbsp;to Bruſſels in February 1740, at which olace he died&nbsp;March 1*7. 174t, ſtrongly impreſſed with religious ſen-timents. Immedir.tely before he received the viaticum,&nbsp;he proteſted he was not the author of thoſe horrid verſes&nbsp;which had ſo much embittered his life ; and this declaration, in the opinion of the virtuous part of mankind,&nbsp;wſll be conſidered as a ſuſſicient proof of his innocence.&nbsp;Borne have ſaid that Rouſſeau was profane, troubleſome,&nbsp;capricious, forward, vindictive, envious, a flatterer, and&nbsp;a ſatiriſt. Others again repreſent him as a man full of&nbsp;candour and openneſs, a faithful and grateful friend,&nbsp;and as a Chriſtian affected with a ſenſe of religion.—&nbsp;Amidſt ſuch widely varied accounts it is difficult to&nbsp;form an opinion of his character. Such of our readers&nbsp;as wiſh to know<sup>7</sup> more of this great poet may conſult&nbsp;the Dictionary of M. Chatipepié, written with as much&nbsp;preciſion as impartiality, who endeavours to give a juſt&nbsp;idea of his character. From what he ſays, it does not&nbsp;appear that Rouſſeau can be cleared ſrom the accuſation&nbsp;brought againſt him of having attacked his benefactors.&nbsp;We believe he may be much more eaſily freed ſrom the&nbsp;imputation brought againſt him by ſome of having diſ-owned his father : for what occaſion had Rouſſeau to&nbsp;conceal the obſeurity of his birth ? It exalted his own&nbsp;merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">, M. Seguy, in concert with M. the prince of la</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tour Taſſis, has given a very beautiful edition of his works, agreeable to the poet’s laſt corrections. It was&nbsp;publiſhed in 1743, at Paris, in 3 vols. 4t0, and in 4&nbsp;vols. 12mo, containing nothing but what was acknowledged by the author as his own. It contains, 1. Four&nbsp;Books of Odes, of which the firſt are ſacred odes, ta-keu from the Pſalms. “ Rouſſeau (ſays Freron)&nbsp;unites in himſelf Pindar, Horace, Anacreon, and Malherbe. What fire, what genius, what flights of imagination, what rapidity of deſcription, what variety&nbsp;of affecting ſtrokes, what a crowd of brilliant companions, what richneſs of rhymes, what happy verſifi--cation ; but eſpecially what inimitable expreſſion ! His&nbsp;verſes are finiſhed in the higheſt ſtyle of perfection that&nbsp;French verſe is capable of aſſuming.” The lyric&nbsp;compoſitions of Rouſſeau are, in general, above mediocrity. All his odes are not, however, of equal merit.&nbsp;The moſt beautiful are thoſe which he has addreſſed to&nbsp;count du Luc, to Malherbe, to prince Eugene, to&nbsp;Vendôme, to the Chriſtian princes ; his Odes on the&nbsp;death of the prince de Conti, on the battle of Peterwara-din ; and the Ode to Fortune, altho’ there are certainly&nbsp;ſome few weak ſtanzas to be met with in it. There is&nbsp;conſiderable neatneſs in the compoſition of the Ode to a&nbsp;Widow, in his ſtanzas to the Abbé de Chaulieu, in his&nbsp;addreſſes to Roſſignol, in his Odes to count de Bi&gt;nne-val, to M. Duche, and to count de Sinzindorf ; and it&nbsp;is to be lamented that he wrote ſo few pieces oſ this&nbsp;kind, from which his genius ſeemed to ſead him with&nbsp;difficulty. 2. Two books of Epiſtles, in verſe. Although theſe do not wafιt their beauties, yet there prevails too much of a miſanthropic ſpirit in them, which&nbsp;takes away greatly from their excellence. He makes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">too </span><span class="font0">frequent mention of his enemies and his miſe&nbsp;fortunes ; he diſplays thoſe principles </span><span class="font1">which </span><span class="font0">are flip-ported leſs on the bafis of truth </span><span class="font1">than </span><span class="font0">on thoſe various&nbsp;paſſions which ruled his mind at the time. He puts&nbsp;forth his anger in paradoxes. If he be reckoned equal&nbsp;to Horace in his odes, he is far inferior in his epiſtles.&nbsp;'Γhere is much more philoſophy in the Roman poet than&nbsp;in him. 3. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cantatas,</span><span class="font0"> hie is the father of this ſpecies&nbsp;of poetry, in which he ſtands unrivalled. His pieces&nbsp;of this fort breathe that poetical expreſſion, that pic-tureſque ſtyle, thoſe happy turns, and thoſe eaſy graces,&nbsp;which conſtitute the true oharacter of this kind of&nbsp;writing. He is as lively and impetuous as he is mild&nbsp;and affecting, adapting himſelf to the paſſions of thoſe&nbsp;perſons whom he makes to ſpeak. “ I confeſs (ſays&nbsp;M. de la Harpe) that 1 find the cantatas of Rouſſeau&nbsp;more purely lyric than his odes, although he riſes to&nbsp;greater heights in theſe. I ſee nothing in his cantatas&nbsp;but bold and agreeable images. He always addreſſes&nbsp;himſelf to the imagination, and he never becomes either too verboſe or too prolix. On the contrary, in&nbsp;ſome of the beſt of his odes, we find ſome languiſh-ing ſtanzas, ideas too long delayed, and verſes of inex-cuſable meanneſs.” 4. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Allegories,</span><span class="font0"> the moſt of which are&nbsp;happy, but ſome of them appear forced. 5. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epigrams,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">after the manner of Martial and Marot. He has taken&nbsp;care to leave out of this edition thoſe pieces which li-centiouſneſs and debauchery inſpired. They bear, indeed, as well as his other pieces, the marks of genius ; but ſuch productions are calculated only to diſ-honour their authors, and corrupt the heart of&nbsp;thoſe who read them, 5. A book of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poems on Various&nbsp;Subjects,</span><span class="font0"> which ſometimes want both eaſe and delicacy.&nbsp;The moſt diſtinguiſhed are two eclogues, imitated&nbsp;from Virgil. 6. Four comedies in verſe ; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Flatterer,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">whoſe character is well ſupported ; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Imaginary Forefathers,</span><span class="font0"> a piece which had much leſs ſucceſs, although&nbsp;it affords ſuſſiciently good ſentiment ; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Capricious&nbsp;Man,</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dupe oſ Herſelſ,</span><span class="font0"> pieces of very inconſi-derable merit. 7. Three comedies in proſe ; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ccf-ſee-houſe,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Magic Girdle,</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Madragore,</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;are little better than his other theatrical pieces. The&nbsp;theatre was by no means his forte; he had a genius more&nbsp;ſuited for ſatire than comedy, more akin to Boileau’s&nbsp;than Moliere’s. 8. A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Galleaioη oſ Letters,</span><span class="font0"> in proſe.&nbsp;In this edition he has ſelected the moſt intereſting.—&nbsp;There is a larger collection in y volumes. This laſt has&nbsp;done at the ſame time both injury and honour to his&nbsp;memory. Rouſſeau in it ſpeaks both in favour of and&nbsp;againſt the very ſame perſons. He appears too haſty&nbsp;in tearing to pieces the characters of thoſe who dil-pleaſed him. We behold in them a man of a ſteady&nbsp;character and an elevated mind, who wiſhes to return&nbsp;to his native country only that he might be enabled completely to juſtify his reputation. We ſee him again&nbsp;correſponding with perſons of great merit and uncommon integrity, with the Abbé d’Olivet, Racine the&nbsp;ſon, the poets La Foſſe andDuche, the celebrated Rol-lin, M. le Franc de Pompignan, &amp;c. &amp;c. We meet&nbsp;alſo with ſome anecdotes and exact judgments of ſeveral writers. A bookſeller in Holland has publiſhed his&nbsp;port-folio, which does him no honour. There are, indeed, ſome pieces in this wretched collection which did&nbsp;come from the pen of Rouſſeau ; but he is leſs to be&nbsp;blamed for them than they are who have drawn theſe&nbsp;works from that oblivion to which our great poet had</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
