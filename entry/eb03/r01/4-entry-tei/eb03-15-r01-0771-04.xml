<p><label>RABBI</label>
or Rabbins, a title which the Phariſees and doctors of the law among the Jews aſſumed, and literally fignifies <hi rend="italic">mqflers</hi> or <hi rend="italic">excellents.</hi></p><p>There were ſeveral gradations before they arrived at the dignity of a rabbin ; which was not conferred till they had acquired the prcfoundeſt knowledge of the law and the traditions. It does not, however, appear that there was any fixed age or previous examination ncceſſary ; but when a man had diſtinguiſhed himſelſ by his ſkill in the written and oral law, and paſſed through the ſubordinate degrees, he was faluted a rabbin by the public voice.</p><p>Among the modern Jews, for near 700 years paſt, the learned men retain no other title than that of <hi rend="italic">rabbi,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rabbins</hi> ; they have great reſpect paid them, have the firſt places or ſeats in their ſynagogues, determine all matters of controverſy, and frequently pronounce upon civil affairs ; they have even power <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="sup"> f</hi> o</hi> excommunicate the diſobedient.</p>
