one of the Hebrides or Weſtern Iſlands of Scotland, remarkable for its baſaltic pillars. It was visited by Sir Joſeph Banks, who communicated the following account of it to Mr Pennant.</p><p>“ The little iſland of Staſſa lies on the weſt coaſt of Mull, about three leagues north-eaſt from Iona, or Icolumbkill : its greateſt length is about an Engliſh mile, and its breadth about half a one. On the weſt side of the iſland is a ſmall bay where boats generally land ; a little to the ſouthward of which the firſt appearance of pillars are to be obſerved : they are ſrnall ; and inſtead of being placed upright, lie down on their ſides, each forming a ſegment of a circle. From thence you paſs a ſmall cave, above which the pillars, now grown a little larger, are inclining in all directions ; in one place in particular, a ſmall maſs of them very much reſembles the ribs of a ſhip. From hence having paſſed the cave, which, if it is not low-water, you must do in a boat, you come to the first ranges of pillars, which are ſtill not above half as large as thoſe a little beyond. Over againſt this place is a ſmall iſland, called in Erſe <hi rend="italic">Boo-ſha-la,</hi> ſeparated from the main by a channel not many fathoms wide. This whole iſland is compoſed of pillars without any ſtratum above them ; they are ſtill small, but by much the neateſt formed of any about the place.</p><p>“ The firſt division of the iſland, for at high water it is divided into two, makes a kind of a cone, the pillars converging together towards the centre : on the other they are in general laid down flat ; and in the front next to the main, you see how beautifully they are packed together, their ends coming out ſquare with the bank which they form. All theſe have their tranſverſe ſections exact, and their ſurfaces ſmooth ; which is by no means the case with the large ones, which are cracked in all directions. I much queſtion, however, if any part of this whole iſland of Boo-ſha-la is two feet in diameter.</p><p>“ The main iſland oppoſite to Boo-ſha-la, and farther towards the north-weſt, is ſupported by ranges of pillars pretty erect, and, though not tall (as they are not uncovered to the baſe), of large diameters; and at their feet is an irregular pavement, made by the upper ſides of ſuch as have been broken off, which extends as far under water as the eye can reach. Here the forms of the pillars are apparent : theſe are of three, four, five, six, and ſeven sides ; but the number of five and six are by much the moſt prevalent. The largeſt I meaſured was of ſeven ; it was four feet five inches in diameter.</p><p>“ The ſurfaces of theſe large pillars, in general, are rough and uneven, full of cracks in all directions ; the tranſverſe figures in the upright ones never fail to run in their true directions. The ſurfaces upon which we walked were often flat, having neither concavity nor convexity ; the larger number, however, were concave, though ſome were very evidently convex. In ſome places, the interſtices within the perpendicular figures were filled up with a yellow ſpar : in one place, a vein paſſed in among the maſs oſ pillars, carrying here and there ſmall threads of ſpar. Though they were broken and cracked through in all directions, yet their perpendicular figures might eaſily be traced : from whence it is eaſy to infer, that whatever the accident might have been that cauſed the diſlocation, it happened after the formation of the pillars.</p><p>“ From hence proceeding along ſhore, you arrive at Fingal’s cave. Its dimensions I have given in the form of a table :</p><pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0727.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0721"/>

Here they are bare to their very baſis, and the ſtratum below them is alſo viſible ; in a ſhort time, if riſes many feet above the water, and gives an opportunity of examining its quality. Its ſurface is rough, and has often large lumps of ſtone flicking in it as if half immerſed : itſelf, when broken, is compoſed of a thouſand heterogeneous parts, which together have very much the appearance of a lava : and the more ſo, as many of the lumps appear to be of the very ſame ſtone of which the pillars are formed. This whole ſtratum lies in an inclined position, dipping gradually towards the south-eaſt. As hereabouts is the ſituation of the higheſt pillars, I ſhall mention my meaſurements of them, and the different ſtrata in this place, premising, that the measurements were made with a line, held in the hand of a perſon who flood at the top of the cliff, and reaching to the bottom ; to the lower end of which was tied a white mark, which was obſerved by one who ſtaid below for the purpoſe : when this mark was ſet off from the water, the perſon below noted it down, and made signal to him above, who made then a mark in his rope : whenever this mark passed a notable place, the same ſignal was made, and the name of the place noted down as before : the line being all hauled up, and the diſtances between the marks meaſured and noted down, gave, when compared with the book kept below, the diſtances, as for inſtance in the cave :</p><p>“ N⁰ I. in the book below, was called from the water to the foot of the firſt pillar in the book above ; 23⁰ I. gave 56 feet 8 inches, the higheſt of that aſcent, which was compoſed of broken pillars.</p><p>“ N⁰ I.

Here the ſtratum under the pillars is lifted up very high ; the pillars above it are considerably leſs than thoſe at the north west end of the iſland, but ſtill very considerable. Beyond is a bay, which cuts deep into the iſland, rendering it in that place not more than a quarter of a mile over. On the ſides of this bay, eſpecially beyond a little valley, which almoſt cuts the iſland into two, are two ſtages of pillars, but ſmall ; however, having a ſtratum between them exactly the ſame as that above them, formed of innumerable little pillars, ſhaken out of their places, and leaning in all directions.</p><p>“ Having paſſed this bay, the pillars totally ceaſe; the rock is of a dark-brown ſtone, and no signs of regularity occur till you have paſſed round the ſouth-eaſt end of the iſland (a ſpace almoſt as large as that occupied by the pillars), which you meet again on the west fide, beginning to form themſelves irregularly, as if the ſtratum had an inclination to that form, and ſoon arrive at the bending pillars where I began.</p><p>“ The ſtone of which the pillars are formed, is a coarſe kind of basaltes, very much reſembling the Giant’s Cauſeway in Ireland, though none of them are near ſo neat as the ſpecimens of the latter which I have ſeen at the Britiſh Muſeum; owing chiefly to the colour, which in ours is a dirty brown, in the Iriſh a fine black ; indeed the whole production items very much to reſemble the Giant’s Cauſeway.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
