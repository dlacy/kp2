<p><span class="font1">with so much alacrity that mass was performed in it by the close of 1450. Sigismondo entrusted the execution of his plans&nbsp;to Leo Battista Alberti, who had to encase in a shell of classic&nbsp;architecture a 13th-century Franciscan church. The original&nbsp;edifice being left intact, it was a difficult question how to deal&nbsp;with the windows and the Gothic arches of the interior. Alberti&nbsp;solved the problem with marvellous skill, blending the old&nbsp;architecture with the new style of the Renaissance, and giving&nbsp;it variety without destroying its unity of effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Being eager to adorn his temple with the most precious marbles, Sigismondo’s veneration for antiquity did not prevent&nbsp;him from pillaging many valuable classical remains in Rimini,&nbsp;Ravenna and even in Greece. Such was the zeal with which&nbsp;Alberti pursued his task that the exterior of the little Rimini&nbsp;church is one of the finest and purest achievements of the&nbsp;Renaissance, and surpasses in beauty and elegance all the&nbsp;rest of his works. But it is much to be deplored that he should&nbsp;have left the upper part of the façade unfinished. Albeti&nbsp;came to Rimini, made his design, saw the work begun and&nbsp;then left it to be carried out by very skilful artists, on whom&nbsp;he impressed the necessity of faithfully preserving its general&nbsp;character so as “ not to spoil that music.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The internal decorations, especially the enormous quantity of wall ornaments, consisting chiefly of scrolls and bas-reliefs,&nbsp;were executed by different sculptors under the personal direction&nbsp;of Malatesta, who, even when engaged in war, sent continual&nbsp;instructions about their work. It is difficult to give an exact&nbsp;idea of this extraordinary church to those who have no personal&nbsp;acquaintance with it. The vault was never finished, and still&nbsp;shows its rough beams and rafters. The eight side chapels&nbsp;alone are complete, and their pointed arches spring from&nbsp;Renaissance pilasters planted on black marble elephants, the&nbsp;Malatesta emblems, or on baskets of fruit held by children.&nbsp;The surface of the pilasters is divided into compartments&nbsp;encrusted with bas-reliefs of various subjects and styles. Everywhere—on the balustrades closing the chapels, round the base&nbsp;of the pilasters, along the walls, beneath the cornice of both the&nbsp;exterior and the interior of the church—there is one ornament&nbsp;that is perpetually repeated, the interwoven initials of Sigis-mondo and Isotta. This monogram is alternated with the&nbsp;portrait and arms of Malatesta; and these designs are en-wreathed by festoons linked together by the tyrant’s second&nbsp;emblem, the rose. The most singular and characteristic&nbsp;feature of this edifice is the almost total absence of every&nbsp;sacred emblem. Rather than to St Francis and the God of&nbsp;the Christians it was dedicated—and that while Sigismondo’s&nbsp;second wife still lived—to the glorification of an unhallowed&nbsp;attachment. Nature, science and antiquity were summoned&nbsp;to celebrate the tyrant’s love for Isotta. The bas-reliefs of&nbsp;one of the chapels represent Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Mars and&nbsp;Diana, together with the signs of the zodiac. And these subjects are derived, it appears, from a poem in which Sigismondo&nbsp;had invoked the gods and the signs of the zodiac to soften&nbsp;Isotta’s heart and win her to his arms. The pageants of Mars&nbsp;and Diana seem to have been suggested by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionfi</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;Petrarch. Elsewhere we see prophets and sibyls, personifications&nbsp;of the theological virtues and of the sciences. The delicate&nbsp;bas-reliefs of botany and medicine, history and astronomy,&nbsp;have been judged by some writers to be Grecian, on account of&nbsp;the ancient appearance of their marble, their inscriptions in&nbsp;Greek and Latin, and others that have never been deciphered.&nbsp;But a moment’s examination of the sculptures is enough to&nbsp;destroy this hypothesis. Besides, some of the inscriptions are&nbsp;very easily read and record “ Apollo Ariminaeus ” and “ Jupiter&nbsp;Ariminaeus.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the first chapel on the left is the family tomb of the Malatesta, with sculptured records of their triumphs and of&nbsp;their alleged descent from Scipio Africanus. Better worthy of&nbsp;notice is the third chapel to the right, known as that of the&nbsp;Angels, on account of the angels and children carved on its&nbsp;pillars. It is nominally dedicated to the archangel Michael,&nbsp;whose statue is enshrined in it; but the figure has the face of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Isotta, the ruling deity of this portion of the church. For here is the splendid and fantastic tomb erected to this lady, during&nbsp;her life and previous to the death of Sigismondo’s second wife.&nbsp;No monument, be it remarked, is raised over the burial-place&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">Ginevra and Polissena. The um of Isotta’s sarcophagus&nbsp;is supported by two elephants, and bears the inscription,&nbsp;“ D. Isottae Ariminensi B. M. Sacrum, MCCCCL.” The “D.”&nbsp;has been generally interpreted as “ Divae ” and the “B. M.” as&nbsp;“ Beatae Memoriae.” But some, unwilling to credit such&nbsp;profanity, allege that the letters stand for “ Bonae Memoriae.”&nbsp;Nevertheless, all who have seen the church must admit the&nbsp;improbability of similar scruples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The numerous artists employed on the interior of the church were under the direction of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">proto-maestro</span><span class="font1"> Matteo de Pasti&nbsp;the celebrated medallist. And indeed the peculiar and fantastic&nbsp;character of the sculptures in this chapel frequently recalls the&nbsp;designs of his famous works. .All this decoration is in strange&nbsp;contrast with the grandly austere simplicity of the façade and&nbsp;outer walls of the church. There no ornament disturbs the&nbsp;harmony of the lines. The frieze beneath the cornice, reproducing the lovers’ initials and the Malatestian ensigns, is&nbsp;in such very low relief that it only enhances the perfection of&nbsp;“ that music ” produced by the marvellous skill of Alberti.&nbsp;Also the colour of the stone, a soft creamy white, adds to the&nbsp;general beauty of effect. And everything both within and&nbsp;without contributes to the profane and pagan character which&nbsp;it was Sigismondo’s purpose to impress on the Christian church.&nbsp;On each of its outer walls are seven arched recesses, intended&nbsp;to contain the ashes of the first Iitetati and scientists of his&nbsp;court. In the first, to the right, is the urn of the poet Basinio,&nbsp;one of his pensioners, in the second that of Giusto de’ Conti,&nbsp;author of some rhymes on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bella Mano,</span><span class="font1"> while the third&nbsp;bore the more famous name of Gemisthus Pletho. This well-known Byzantine philosopher was the diffuser of Platonism in&nbsp;Florence during the time of Cosimo de’ Medici, and had faith&nbsp;in the revival of paganism. Returning to his own people,&nbsp;he had died in the Morea. Sigismondo, having gone there&nbsp;in command of the Venetian expedition against the Turks,&nbsp;exhumed the philosopher’s bones as holy relics, and brought&nbsp;them to Rimini for worthy sepulture in his Christian pantheon.&nbsp;AIl this is solemnly recorded in the inscription, which is dated 1465.&nbsp;The fourth sarcophagus was that of Roberto Valturio (d. 1489),&nbsp;the engineer, author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Re Militari,</span><span class="font1"> who had been Sigismondo’s&nbsp;minister and had aided him in the construction of the castle&nbsp;of Rimini. The other urns on this side were placed by Malatesta’s&nbsp;successors, and the arches on the left wall remained un tenanted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sigismondo understood the science of fortification. He was also the first to discard the use of wooden bomb-shells,&nbsp;and substitute others cast in bronze. As a soldier his numerous&nbsp;campaigns had shown him to be possessed of all the best&nbsp;qualities and worst defects of the free captains of his time. He&nbsp;began his military career in 1432 in the service of Eugenius IV.;&nbsp;but, when this pope doubted his good faith and transferred&nbsp;the command to another, he sided with the Venetians against&nbsp;him, though at a later date he again served under him. On&nbsp;the decease of Filippo Maria Visconti in 1447 he joined the&nbsp;Aragonese against Venice and Florence; but, presently changing&nbsp;his flag, fought valiantly against Alphonso of Aragon and forced&nbsp;him to raise the siege of Piombino. In 1454 he accepted a&nbsp;command from the Sienese; but suddenly, after his usual fashion,&nbsp;he made peace with the enemies of the republic, and had to save&nbsp;himself by flight from arrest for his perfidy. It was then that&nbsp;the letters from Isotta were confiscated. After this he began&nbsp;scheming to hasten the coming of the Angevins, and took&nbsp;part in new and more hazardous campaigns against adversaries&nbsp;such as the duke of Tkbino, Sforza of Milan, Piccinino, and,&nbsp;worst of all, the Sienese pope, Pius II., his declared and mortal&nbsp;foe. This time Sigismbndo had blundered; for the cause of&nbsp;Anjou was hopelessly ruined in Italy. He was therefore driven&nbsp;to make his submission to the pope, but, again rebellimgas&nbsp;summoned to trial in Rome (1460) before a tribunal of hostile&nbsp;cardinals. All the old charges against him were now revived</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
