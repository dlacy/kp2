He had no other paſſion but a very great love&nbsp;for learning. He uſed to ſay, that he would rather&nbsp;renounce his crown than his ſtudy. His court ſoon became the ſanctuary of the ſciences, which he encouraged equally by his example and his bounty. This&nbsp;prince was verſed in theology, juriſprudence, philoſo-phy, mathematics, and medicine. Bocace ſays, “ that&nbsp;ſince the days of Solomon we have not ſeen ſo wiſe a&nbsp;prince upon the throne.” For a great part of his life&nbsp;he had no taſte for poetry; he even deſpiſed it, as, in&nbsp;his opinion, unworthy of a man of learning. A con-verſation which he had with Petrarch, however, undeceived him ; he retained this poet at his court, and attempted himſelf to write ſome poems, which are ſtill&nbsp;extant. He was forced to engage a little in war, for&nbsp;which he po</span><span class="font0">ſſ</span><span class="font1">e</span><span class="font0">ſſ</span><span class="font1">ed no great talents : alluding to which,&nbsp;may be ſeen on his tomb a wolf and a lamb drinking&nbsp;ôut of the ſame veſſd. Philip of Valois refrained from&nbsp;giving battle in 1339, by the repeated advice which&nbsp;this prince gave him, who was a great friend to France,&nbsp;both from inclination and intereſt. He deteſted quarrels among Chriſtian princes, and had ſtudied the ſci-ence of aſtrology, not ſo much to know the courſe of&nbsp;the ſtars, as to learn by this chimerical ſcience the hidden things of futurity. He believed that he read in&nbsp;the grand book of heaven a very great misfortune which&nbsp;would befal France if Philip hazarded a battle againſt&nbsp;the Engliſh.</span></p>

He&nbsp;re-eſtabliſhed in his eſtates Baudouin IV. count of&nbsp;Flanders, who had been unjuſtly ſtript of his poſſeſſions&nbsp;by his own ſon.

<p><span class="font1">Mild, elector Palatine, ſon of Robert the Niggardly, was born in 1352, and elected emperor of Germany in&nbsp;14co, after the depoſition of the cruel Wenceſlas. In&nbsp;order to gain the affection of the Germans, he wiſhed&nbsp;to reſtore Milanès to the empire, which Wenceſlas had&nbsp;taken from it ; but his attempts in this reſpect were&nbsp;unſucce</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">sful. His attachment to the anti-pope Gre-gory XII. entirely alienated the affections of the German&nbsp;princes. To ſuch a degree were they incenſed againſt&nbsp;him, that they entered into a conſpiracy to cut him off;&nbsp;but his death, which happened on the 18th of May&nbsp;1410, being then 58 years old, put a ſtop to their machinations. Robert began to ſettle the ſovereignty of&nbsp;the German princes. The emperors had formerly retained in their own hands the power of life and death,&nbsp;within the territories of a great many of the nobles ;&nbsp;but he yielded them this right by his letters patent.—&nbsp;The chief fault imputed to this prince was an exceſs of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">lenity. But, if we conſider the plots which he had to detect, the conſpiracies which he had to fruſtrate, the&nbsp;ſecret and powerful enemies he had to deal with ; if we&nbsp;inquire alſo into the commotions which the wicked ad-miniſtration of Wenceſlas had excited, the irruptions&nbsp;and devaſtations of plunderers and highway robbers,&nbsp;which the nobles countenanced, and the diſtreſſed ſituation in which he found Germany, we muſt without&nbsp;heſitation conclude, that his lenity indicated his prudence, in reſtoring by (low degrees the empire to its&nbsp;original tranquillity. Robert had his virtues, he loved&nbsp;his ſubjects, and governed them with wiſdom. Poſſeſſed of much political knowledge for the age in which&nbsp;he lived, he wanted nothing but talents for war to make&nbsp;him an accompliſhed prince. He was twice married.&nbsp;The name and rank of his firſt wiſe is unknown ; he&nbsp;had by her a fon, who died before him. His ſecond&nbsp;wife was Elizabeth, daughter of Frederic burgrave of&nbsp;Nuremberg, by whom he had five ſons and three daughters. The three daughters were, Margaret married to&nbsp;Charles duke of Lorrain ; Agnes to Adolphus duke of&nbsp;Cleves ; Elizabeth to Frederic duke of Auſtria. His&nbsp;ſons were, Louis the firſt of the electoral branch, which&nbsp;became extinct in 1559; John father of Chriſtopher&nbsp;king of Denmark ; Frederic who died without iſſue ;&nbsp;Otho count of Sintſheim ; laſtly, Stephen, from whom&nbsp;deſeended the elector, and the other counts palatine of&nbsp;the Rhine, who are extant at this day.</span></p>
