<p><span class="font1">ſect, and is armed with ſharp thorns, two oſ which are at each joint, one oſ which is about half an inch long,&nbsp;ſtraight, and upright ; the other is ſcarcely half that&nbsp;length, and bent backward ; and between them is the&nbsp;bud ſor next year’s ſhoot. June is the time oi flowering, and the flowers are ſucceeded by a ſmall fruit, ſur-roundedby a membrane. &quot; This plant (ſays Hanbury)&nbsp;is undoubtedly the ſort oſ which the crown oſ thorns&nbsp;ſor our Bleffed Saviour was compoſed. The branches&nbsp;are very pliant, and the ſpines oſ it are at every joint&nbsp;ſtrong and ſharp. It grows naturally about Jeruſalem,&nbsp;as well as in many parts of Judæa ; and there is no&nbsp;doubt that the barbarous Jews would make choice oſ&nbsp;it ſor their cruel purpoſe. But what farther confirms&nbsp;the truth oſ theſe thorns being then uſed, are the an-cieut pictures oſ our Bleffed Saviour’s crucifixion. The&nbsp;thorns oſ the crown on his head exactly anſwer to thoſe&nbsp;oſ this tree ; and there is great reaſon to ſuppoſe theſe&nbsp;were taken ſrom the. earlieſt paintings oſ tlie Lord oſ&nbsp;Life : and even now our modern painters copy ſrom&nbsp;tliem, and repreſent the crown as compoſed oſ theſe&nbsp;thorns. Thefe plants, therefore, ſhonld principally liave&nbsp;a ſhare in thoſe parts of tlie plantation that are more&nbsp;peculiarly deſigned ſor religious retirement ; for tliey&nbsp;will prove excellent monitors, and conduce to due reflection on and gratitude to ‘ Him who hath loved us,&nbsp;and lias waſhed us from our fuis,” &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common alaternus is an evergreen tree, and&nbsp;native of the ſouth of Europe. There are ſeveral varieties of this ſpecies ; the moſt remarkable of which&nbsp;are the broad-leaved and tbe jagged-leaved alaternus,&nbsp;which have all been confounded with the phillyrea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The inſectorius, or narrow-leaved buckthorn, is an&nbsp;evergreen ſhrub or tree, and native of Spain. It grows&nbsp;to the height of 10 or 12 feet, and fends forth ſeveral&nbsp;branches from the bottom to the top. They are co-vered with a blackiſh or dark-coloured bark, and each&nbsp;©f them is terminated by a long ſharp thorn. The fruit&nbsp;continues on the trees all winter, making a beautiful&nbsp;appearance among the narrow-cluttered leaves at that&nbsp;ſeaſon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oleoides, or olive-leaved buckthorn, is an evergreen ſhrub, and native of Spain, and grows to the&nbsp;height oſ 8 or 1 o ſeet. It fends forth numerous branclies,&nbsp;each of which is terminated by a long ſharp ſpine. The&nbsp;flowers are ſmall, of a whitiſh green colour, and are ſuc-ceeded by round black berries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHAMPHASTOS, in ornithology, a genus be-longing to the order of picae. The bill is very large, and ſerrated outwardly. The noſtrils are ſituated behind the baſe of the beak ; and in moſt of the ſpecies&nbsp;the feet aie toed, and placed two forwards and two&nbsp;backwards. The tongue is long, narrow, and feathered on the edges. Mr Latham enumerates 15 diſſcrent&nbsp;ſpecies ; of which the toucans are the moſt remarkable,&nbsp;and were formerly divided into four or ſive varieties,&nbsp;though Mr Latham makes them diſtinct fpecies, of&nbsp;which we ſhali only defcribe that called the red-beaked&nbsp;toucan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This bird is about the ſize of a jackdaw, and of a ſimilar ſhape, with a large head to ſupport its monſtrous bill : this bill, from the angles of the mouth to its&nbsp;point, is ſix inches and an half ; and its breadth in the&nbsp;thickeſt part is a little more than two. Its thickneſs&nbsp;near the head is one inch and a quarter ; and it is </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">little rounded along the top of the upper chap, the under ſide. being round alſo ; the whole of the bill extremely flight, and a little thicker tlian parchment. The&nbsp;upper chap is of a bright yellow, except on each ſide,&nbsp;which is of a fine ſearlet colour ; as is alfo the lower&nbsp;chap, except at the baſe, which is purple. Between&nbsp;the head and the bill there is a black </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">liRe </span><span class="font1">of ſeparation&nbsp;all round the baſe of the bill ; in the upper part of&nbsp;which the noſtrils are placed, and are almoſt covered&nbsp;with feathers ; which has occaſioned ſome writers to&nbsp;ſay that the toucan has no noſtrils. Round the eyes,&nbsp;on each ſide of the head, is a ſpace of bluiſh ſkin, void&nbsp;of feathers ; above which the head is black, except a&nbsp;white ſpot on each ſide joining to the baſe of the, upper&nbsp;chap. The hinder part of the neck, the back, wings,&nbsp;tail, belly, and thighs, are black. The under ſide of&nbsp;the head, throat, and the beginning of the breaſt, are&nbsp;white. Between the white on the breaſt, and the black&nbsp;on the belly, is a ſpace of red feathers, in the form of a&nbsp;new moon, with its horns upwards. The legs, ſeet,&nbsp;and claws, are of an aſh-colour ; and the toes ſtand like&nbsp;thoſe of parrots, two before and two behind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is reported by travellers, that this bird, though ſurniſhed with fo formidable a beak, is harmleſs and.&nbsp;gentle, being ſo eaſily made tame as to ſit and hatch&nbsp;its young in houſes. It ſeeds chiefly upon pepper,&nbsp;which it devours very greedily, gorging itſelf in ſuch&nbsp;a manner that it voids it crude and unconcocted. T'his,&nbsp;however, is no objection to the natives from uſing it&nbsp;again : they even prefer it before that pepper which is&nbsp;freſh gathered from the tree ; and ſeem perſuaded that&nbsp;the ſtiength and heat of the pepper is qualified by the&nbsp;bird, and that all its noxious qualities are thus ex-hauſted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">whatever be the truth of this report, nothing is more certain than that the toucan lives only upon a&nbsp;vegetable diet ; and, in a domeſtic ſtate, to which it&nbsp;is frequently brought in the warm countries where it&nbsp;is bred, it is ſeen to prefer ſuch food to all other.&nbsp;Pozzo, who bred one tame, afferts, that it leaped up&nbsp;and down, wagged the tail, and cried with a voice&nbsp;reſembling that of a magpie. It fed upon the fame&nbsp;things that parrots do; but was moſt greedy of grapes,&nbsp;which, being plucked off one by one, and thrown in&nbsp;the air, it would moſt dexterouſly catch before they&nbsp;ſell to the ground. Its bill, he adds, was hollow, and&nbsp;upon that account very light, ſo that it had but little&nbsp;ſtrength in fo apparently formidable a weapon ; nor&nbsp;could it peck or ſtrike ſmartly therewith. But its&nbsp;tongue ſeemed to affiſt the efforts of this unwieldy machine : it was long, thin, and flat, not unlike one of&nbsp;the feathers on the neck of a dunghill cock ; this it&nbsp;moved up and down, and often extended ſive or ſix&nbsp;inches from the bill. It was of a fleſh colour, and remarkably fringed on each ſide with very fmall ſilaments..&nbsp;exactly reſembling a feather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is probable that tliis long tongue has greater ſtrength than the thin hollow beak that contains it.&nbsp;It is likely that the beak is only a kind of ſheath ſor&nbsp;this peculiar inſtrument, uſed by the toucan, not only&nbsp;in making itſelf a neſt, but alfo in obtaining its pro-viſion. Nothing is more certain, than that this bird&nbsp;builds its ueſt in holes of trees, which have been pre-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
