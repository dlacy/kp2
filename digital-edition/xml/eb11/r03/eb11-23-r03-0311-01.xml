               <p>                   <label>RICHMOND AND DERBY, MARGARET</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Countess
                        of</hi> (1443-1509), mother of the English king, Henry VII., and foundress
                    of St John’s and Christ’s colleges at Cambridge, was the daughter and heiress of
                    John Beaufort, duke of Somerset, and was born on the 31st of May 1443. In 1455
                    she married Edmund Tudor, earl of Richmond, who died in the following year; she
                    then took for her husband Henry (d. 1482), son of Humphrey Stafford, duke of
                    Buckingham, and later Thomas Stanley, afterwards earl of Derby. She was in
                    constant communication with her son, the future king, during his exile in
                    Brittany, and with her husband, Lord Stanley, aided him to gain the crown in
                    1485. The countess was very pious and charitable, and under the influence of her
                    confessor, John Fisher, afterwards bishop of Rochester, she founded the Lady
                    Margaret professorships of divinity at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge.
                    She completed the foundation of Christ’s College, Cambridge, and after her
                    death, in accordance with her wishes, much of her wealth was devoted to building
                    and endowing St John’s College in the same university. She survived her son,
                    whose title to the English throne was derived through her, and died on the 29th
                    of June 1509. The countess translated some devotional books into English, and
                    Fisher said of her, " All England for her death had cause of weeping.”</p>               <p>See C. H. Cooper, <hi rend="italic">Memoir of Margaret, Conntess of Richmond and
