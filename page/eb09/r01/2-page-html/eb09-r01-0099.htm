<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">tion is milder and more tamable than that of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">M. decumanus,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and it is therefore the species to which the tame white and pied rats kept as pets commonly belong. It is&nbsp;said that in some parts of Germany </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">M. raft us</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> has been&nbsp;lately reasserting itself and increasing at the expense of&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">M. decumanus</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">,, but this seems very unlikely from the previous history of the two animals (compare </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mouse, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vol.&nbsp;xvii. p. 5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The brown or Norway rat, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">M. decumanus,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> is a heavily built animal, growing to 8 or 9 inches in length, with a&nbsp;bluff rounded head, small ears (see fig., B), and a comparatively short tail,—always shorter than the head and&nbsp;body combined, and generally not longer than the body&nbsp;alone. Its colour is a uniform greyish brown above, and&nbsp;white below, the ears, feet, and tail being flesh-coloured;&nbsp;melanistic varieties are by no means rare, and these are&nbsp;often mistaken for true black rats, but the differences in&nbsp;size and proportions form a ready means of distinguishing&nbsp;the two. The brown rat is believed to be a native of&nbsp;western China, where a wild race has been recently discovered so like it as to be practically indistinguishable.&nbsp;The two species agree fully in their predaceous habits,&nbsp;omnivorous diet, and great fecundity. They bear four&nbsp;or five times in the year from four to ten blind and naked&nbsp;young, which are in their turn able to breed at an age of&nbsp;about six months. The time of gestation is about twenty&nbsp;days.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(o. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">T.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RATAFIA is a term applied to a flavouring essence, the basis of which is the essential oil of bitter almonds.&nbsp;Peach kernels are properly the source of ratafia, but any&nbsp;of the other substances yielding bitter almond oil is used.&nbsp;The name “ratafia” is also applied in France to a variety&nbsp;of liquors, and from Dantzic a special liqueur is sent out&nbsp;under the name of “ ratafia ” (see vol. xiv. </span><span class="font0">p. 686</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RATEL. The animals known as Ratels or Honey-badgers are small clumsy-looking creatures of about the size and appearance of the true badgers, and belong to the&nbsp;same natural group of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Carnivora,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> namely, the subfamily&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Melinas</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the large family </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mustelidse,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> which contains the&nbsp;otters, badgers, stoats, weasels, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;kc.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mammalia, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vol.&nbsp;xv. p. 440). Of the ratels two species are generally&nbsp;recognized, viz., the Indian Ratel (</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mellivora indica),</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">native of all the peninsula of India, and the African </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(M. ratel),</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> which ranges over the whole of the African continent&nbsp;—although by some authors the West African race is considered to represent a third distinct species, which has</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">been named </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">M. leueonota.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> All the ratels are of very much the same colour, namely, iron-grey on the upper parts of&nbsp;the head, body, and tail, and black below, a style of coloration rather rare among mammals, as the upper side of the&nbsp;body is in the great majority darker than the lower. Their&nbsp;body is stout and thickly built ; the legs are short and&nbsp;strong, and armed, especially on the anterior pair, with&nbsp;long curved fossorial claws ; the tail is short ; and the&nbsp;ear-conches are reduced to mere rudiments. These modifications are all in relation to a burrowing mode of life,&nbsp;for which the ratels are among the best adapted of all&nbsp;carnivores. The skull is conical, stout, and heavy, and&nbsp;the teeth, although sharper and less rounded than those&nbsp;of their allies the badgers, are yet far less suited to a purely&nbsp;carnivorous diet than those of such typical </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mustelidæ</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> as&nbsp;the stoats, weasels, and martens. The two species of&nbsp;ratel may be distinguished by the fact that the African&nbsp;has a distinct white line round the body at the junction of&nbsp;the grey of the upper side with the black of the lower,&nbsp;while in the Indian this line is absejit ; the teeth also of&nbsp;the former are on the whole decidedly larger, rounder, and&nbsp;heavier than those of the latter. In spite of these differences, however, the two ratels are so nearly allied that&nbsp;they might almost be considered to be merely geographical&nbsp;races of a single widely spread species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The following account of the Indian ratel is extracted from Dr Judson’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Mammals of India·.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> — “The Indian badger is found&nbsp;throughout the whole of India, from the extreme south to the foot&nbsp;of the Himalayas, chiefly in hilly districts, where it has greater&nbsp;facilities for constructing the holes and dens in which it lives ; but&nbsp;also in the north of India in alluvial plains, where the banks of&nbsp;large rivers afford equally suitable localities wherein to make its&nbsp;lair. It is stated to live usually in pairs, and to eat rats, birds,&nbsp;frogs, white ants, and various insects, and in the north of India it&nbsp;is accused of digging out dead bodies, and is popularly known as&nbsp;the grave-digger. It doubtless also, like its Cape congener, occasionally partakes of honey. It is often very destructive to poultry,&nbsp;and I have known of several having been trapped and killed whilst&nbsp;committing such depredations in Central India and in the northern&nbsp;Circars. In confinement the Indian badger is quiet and will partake of vegetable food, fruits, rice, &amp;c. ”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;' (O. T. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RATHENOW, a small town of Prussia in the province of Brandenburg, lies on the right bank of the Havel,&nbsp;44 miles to the west of Berlin. It is known for its&nbsp;“Rathenow stones,” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> bricks made of the clay of the&nbsp;Havel, and for its spectacles and optical instruments,&nbsp;which are exported to various parts of the world. It&nbsp;contains no buildings of note. The population in 1880&nbsp;was 11,394, including 174 Roman Catholics and 68 Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rathenow has enjoyed the privileges of a town since 1217. In 1394 it was taken and partly destroyed by the archbishop of&nbsp;Magdeburg. During the Thirty Years’ War it was repeatedly&nbsp;occupied by the opposing troops, and in 1675 it was cleverly&nbsp;snatched from the Swedish garrison by the Great Elector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RATIBOR (Polish </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Raciborz),</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> a town of Prussian Silesia in the department of Oppeln, is pleasantly situated on the&nbsp;left bank of the Oder at the point where the river becomes&nbsp;navigable, about 12 miles from the Austrian frontier.&nbsp;The most prominent buildings are the handsome courthouse by Schinkel and the Modern Gothic church ; on&nbsp;the right bank of the Oder is the old château of the dukes&nbsp;of Ratibor. The town is the seat of a diversified industry,&nbsp;the chief products of which are machinery and railway&nbsp;gear, iron wares, tobacco and cigars, paper, sugar, furniture, and glass. Trade is carried on in these articles and&nbsp;in agricultural produce, and hemp and vegetables are&nbsp;largely grown in the environs. The population in 1880&nbsp;was 18,373, or, including the immediately adjacent villages,&nbsp;27,100, five-sixths of whom are Roman Catholics. In&nbsp;the town itself, where there are only about 2500 Poles,&nbsp;German is chiefly spoken, but Polish and Czechish dialects&nbsp;are predominant in the neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Ratibor, which received municipal privileges at the close of the , 13th century, was formerly the capital of an independent duchy,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
