called alſo the Sheriffdom <hi rend="italic">of Etterick Fοrest,</hi> a county of Scotland, extending about 20 miles in length from eaſt to weſt, and about 12 in breadth from ſouth to north. It borders on the north with part of Tweeddale and Mid-Lothian ; on the ſouth and eaſt with Teviotdale ; and on the weſt with Annandale. This county was formerly reſerved by the Scottiſh princes for the pleaſure of the chace, and where they had houſes for the reception of their train. At that time the face of the country was covered with woods, in which there were great numbers of red and fallow deer, whence it had the name of <hi rend="italic">Etterick Forest.</hi> The woods, however, are now almoſt entirely cut down, and the county is chiefly ſupported by the breed of ſheep. They are generally sold into the ſouth, but ſometimes into the Highlands, about the month of March, where they are kept during ſummer ; and after being improved by the mountain-grass, are returned into the Lowlands in the beginning of winter.</p><p>This county, though not very populous at preſent, was once the nurſe of heroes, who were juſtly accounted the bulwark of their native foil, being ever ready to brave danger and death in its defence. Of this we have a memorable proof in the pathetic lamentations of their wives and daughters for the diſaſter of the field of Flowden, “ where their brave foreſters were a’ wed away.”<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[mu] Statistical Account of Scotland, vol. 2.</p></note> The rivers Etterick and Yarrow unite a little above the town of Selkirk, and terminate in the Tweed. For five miles above its junction with the Etterick, the Tweed is ſtill adorned with w∞ds, and leads the pleaſed imagination to contemplate what this country muſt have been in former times. The Yarrow, for about five miles above its junction with Etterick, exhibits nature in a bold and ſtriking aſpect. Its native woods ſtill remain, through which the ſtream has cut its turbid courle, deeply ingulphed amidſt rugged rocks. Here, certainly in a flood, flood the deſcriptive Thomſon when he ſaw it</p><p>“ Work and boil, and foam and thunder through.”</p><p>Upon a peninſula, cut out by the surrounding ſtream, in the middle of this fantaſtically wild ſcene <hi rend="italic">of</hi> grandeur and beauty, ſtands the caſtle of Newark, which has been ſuppoſed by many to be the birth-place of Mary Scot the flower of Yarrow; but this we believe to be a miſtake.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0264.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0258"/>
