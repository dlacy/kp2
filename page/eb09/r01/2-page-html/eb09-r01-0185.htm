<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">on the number of portraits of the same young woman painted in the early years of his stay in Amsterdam and&nbsp;before he met his bride. Then, again, in the many&nbsp;portraits of himself painted in his early life we can see&nbsp;with what zeal he set himself to master every form of&nbsp;expression, now grave now gay, at one time with a smile&nbsp;at another with a frown,—how thoroughly he learned to&nbsp;model the human face not from the outside but from the&nbsp;inner man. Careful in detail and thorough in work, these&nbsp;studies were the foundation of his later triumphs. Dr&nbsp;Bode gives fifty as the number of the portraits of himself,&nbsp;most of them painted in youth and in old age, the times&nbsp;when he had leisure for such work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rembrandt’s earliest pictures Avere painted in the last four years of his stay at Leyden, from 1627 to 1631.&nbsp;Bode mentions about nine pictures as known to belong to&nbsp;these years, chiefly paintings of single figures, as St Paul&nbsp;in Prison and St Jerome; but now and then compositions of&nbsp;several, as Samson in Prison and Presentations in the&nbsp;Temple. The prevailing tone of all these pictures is a&nbsp;greenish-grey, the effect being somewhat cold and heavy.&nbsp;The gallery at Cassel gives us a typical example of his studies&nbsp;of the heads of old men, firm and hard in workmanship&nbsp;and full of detail, the effects of light and shade being&nbsp;carefully thought out. His work was now attracting the&nbsp;attention of the lovers of art in the great city of Amsterdam ; and, urged by their calls, he removed about 1631 to&nbsp;live and die there. His life lias few incidents and these&nbsp;only personal, for he lived among the simple burgher&nbsp;citizens, moving in an excellent circle of men of science,&nbsp;divines, poets, artists, and friends of art. At one bound&nbsp;he leaped into the position of the first portrait painter of&nbsp;the city, and received numerous commissions. During the&nbsp;early years of his residence there are at least forty known&nbsp;portraits from his hand, firm and solid in manner and&nbsp;staid in expression. It. has been remarked that the fantasy&nbsp;in which he indulged through life was reserved only for the&nbsp;portraits of himself and his immediate connexions. The&nbsp;excellent painter Thomas De Keyser was then in the height&nbsp;of his power, and his influence is to be traced in some of&nbsp;Rembrandt’s smaller portraits. Pupils also now flocked to&nbsp;his house in the Bloemgracht, among them Gerard Douw,&nbsp;who was nearly of his own age. The first important work&nbsp;executed by Rembrandt in Amsterdam is Simeon in the&nbsp;Temple, of the Hague Museum, a fine early example of&nbsp;his treatment of light and shade and of his subtle colour.&nbsp;The concentrated light falls on the principal figure, his&nbsp;favourite way of arresting attention, while the background&nbsp;is full of mystery. The surface is smooth and enamelled,&nbsp;and all the details are carefully wrought out, while the&nbsp;action of light on the mantle of Simeon shows how soon&nbsp;he had felt the magical effect of the play of colour.&nbsp;Between the small Simeon of 1631 and the life-sized&nbsp;Lesson in Anatomy of 1632 there is a great difference. In&nbsp;the latter we have the first of the great portrait subjects,&nbsp;—Tulp the anatomist, the early friend of Rembrandt, discoursing to his seven associates, who are ranged with eager&nbsp;heads round the foreshortened body. The subject was&nbsp;not new, for it had been treated in former years by the&nbsp;Mierevelds, A. Pietersen, and others, for the Hall of the&nbsp;Surgeons. But it was reserved for Rembrandt to make it&nbsp;a great picture by the grouping of the expressive portraits&nbsp;and by the completeness of the conception. The colour&nbsp;is quiet and the handling of the brush timid and precise, while the light and shade are somewhat harsh and&nbsp;abrupt. But it is a marvellous picture for a young man&nbsp;of twenty-five, and it is generally accepted as the first&nbsp;milestone in the career of the painter, and as marking a&nbsp;new departure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the forty long years of Rembrandt’s incessant activity</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">as an artist about seven hundred pictures are known to have come from his own hand. It is therefore clearly&nbsp;impossible within the space at our disposal to notice more&nbsp;than the prominent <sup>,</sup>works in their order. Besides the&nbsp;Pellicorne family portraits of 1632, we have the caligra-phist Coppenol of the Cassel Gallery, interesting in the first&nbsp;place as an early example of Rembrandt’s method of giving&nbsp;permanent interest to a portrait by converting it into a&nbsp;picture. He invests it with a sense of life by a momentary expression as Coppenol raises his head towards the&nbsp;spectator while he is mending a quill. The same motive&nbsp;is to be found in the Shipbuilder, 1633 (of Buckingham&nbsp;Palace), who looks up from his work with a sense of&nbsp;interruption at the approach of his <sup>,</sup>wife. But the worthy&nbsp;Coppenol, “the Phoenix of the Pen,” has another charm for&nbsp;us; he was one of Rembrandt’s earliest friends in his new&nbsp;abode and remained true to the end, being painted thrice&nbsp;and etched twice by the artist, the last of whose portrait&nbsp;etchings (1661) was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Coppenol of large size. The two&nbsp;small pictures of the Philosopher of the Louvre date from&nbsp;1633, delicate in execution and full of mysterious effect.&nbsp;The year 1634 is especially remarkable as that of his&nbsp;marriage with Saskia van Ulenburgh, a beautiful, fair-haired&nbsp;Frisian maiden of good connexions. Till her death in&nbsp;1642 she was the centre of his life and art, and lives for&nbsp;us in many a canvas as well as in her own portraits. On&nbsp;her the painter lavished his magical power, painting her&nbsp;as the Queen Artemisia or Bathsheba, and as the wife of&nbsp;Samson,—ahvays proud of her long fair locks, and covering&nbsp;her with pearls and gold as precious in their play of colour&nbsp;as those of the Indies. A joyous pair as we see them in&nbsp;the Dresden Gallery, Saskia sitting on his knee while he&nbsp;laughs gaily, or promenading together in a fine picture&nbsp;of 1636, or putting the last touches of ornament to her&nbsp;toilette, for thus Bode interprets the so-called Burgomaster Pancras and his Wife. These were his happy days&nbsp;when he painted himself in his exuberant fantasy, and&nbsp;adorned himself, at least in his portraits, in scarfs and&nbsp;feathers and gold chains. Saskia brought him a marriage&nbsp;portion of forty thousand guilders, a large sum for those&nbsp;times, and she brought him also a large circle of good&nbsp;friends in Amsterdam. She bore him four children, Rum-bartus and two girls successively named Cornelia after his&nbsp;beloved mother, all of whom died in infancy, and Titus,&nbsp;named after Titia a sister of Saskia. We have several&nbsp;noble portraits of Saskia, a good type of the beauty of&nbsp;Holland, all painted with the utmost love and care, at&nbsp;Cassel (1633), at Dresden (1641), and a posthumous one&nbsp;(1643) at Berlin. But the greatest in workmanship and&nbsp;most pathetic in expression seems to us, though it is decried&nbsp;by Bode, that of Antwerp (1641), in which it is impossible&nbsp;not to trace declining health and to find a melancholy presage of her death, which took ])lace in 1642. Then truly&nbsp;Avent out the light of Rembrandt’s life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Returning to Rembrandt’s work, Ave find one of the greatest portraits of 1634 to be the superb full length&nbsp;portrait of Martin Daey, Avhich with that of !Madame Daey,&nbsp;painted according to Vosmaer some years later, formed one&nbsp;of the ornaments of the Van Loon collection at Amsterdam.&nbsp;Both </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">iioav </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">belong to Baron Gustave de Rothschild. From&nbsp;the firm detailed execution of this portrait one turns with&nbsp;Avonder to the broader handling of the Old Woman, aged&nbsp;eighty-three, in the National Gallery, of the same year,&nbsp;remarkable for the effect of reflected light and still more&nbsp;for the sympathetic rendering of character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The life of Samson supplied many subjects in these early days. The so-called Count of Gueldres Threatening&nbsp;his Father-in-law of the Berlin Gallery has been restored&nbsp;to its proper signification by M. Kolloff, who finds it to be&nbsp;Samson. It is forced and violent in its action. But the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
