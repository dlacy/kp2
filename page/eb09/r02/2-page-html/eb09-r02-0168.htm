<p><span class="font1">ROBIN REDBREAST. See Redbreast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBINS, Benjamin (1707-1751), an English natural philosopher, was born at Bath in 1707. His parents were&nbsp;Quakers in poor circumstances, and gave him very little&nbsp;education. Aided solely by his own talent for exact&nbsp;science, he made considerable progress, and attracted so&nbsp;much notice that he was introduced to Pemberton, who&nbsp;befriended and encouraged him. For a time he maintained&nbsp;himself by teaching mathematics, but soon devoted himself to more congenial work. In particular he carried out&nbsp;an extensive series of experiments in gunnery, the results&nbsp;of which were afterwards embodied in his famous treatise&nbsp;on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hew Principles in Gunnery</span><span class="font1"> (8vo, London, 1742). In&nbsp;this treatise is described the ballistic pendulum, an instrument which has become classical in the history of dynamics,&nbsp;and which bears the name of its inventor. Robins also&nbsp;made a number of very important experiments on the&nbsp;resistance of the air to the motion of projectiles, and on&nbsp;the force of gunpowder, with computation of the velocities&nbsp;thereby communicated to military projectiles. He compared the results of his theory with experimental determinations of the ranges of mortars and cannon, and gave&nbsp;practical maxims for the management of artillery. He&nbsp;also made observations on the flight of rockets and wrote&nbsp;on the advantages of rifled barrels. So great was his fame&nbsp;as a scientific artillerist that Euler translated his work on&nbsp;gunnery into German and added to it a critical commentary of his own. Of less interest nowadays are Robins’s&nbsp;more purely mathematical writings, such as his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Discourse&nbsp;concerning the Nature and Certainty of Sir Isaac Newton’s&nbsp;Methods of Fluxions and of Prime and Ultimate Ratios&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(8vo, London, 1735), “A Demonstration of the Eleventh&nbsp;Proposition of Sir Isaac Newton’s Treatise of Quadratures ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Phil. Trans.,</span><span class="font1"> 1727), and similar works. Besides his scientific labours Robins took an active part in politics. He&nbsp;wrote pamphlets in support of the opposition to Sir Robert&nbsp;Walpole, and was secretary of a committee appointed by&nbsp;the House of Commons to inquire into the conduct of that&nbsp;minister. He also wrote a preface to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Report on the&nbsp;Proceedings of the Board of General Officers on their Examination into the Conduct of Lieutenant-General Sir John&nbsp;Cope,</span><span class="font1"> in which he gave an apology for the affair at Preston-pans. In 1750 he was appointed engineer-general to the&nbsp;East India Company, and went out to superintend the reconstruction of their forts. The climate, however, disagreed with him, and he died on 29th July 1751. His&nbsp;works were published in two volumes 8vo in 1761.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBINSON, Edward (1794-1863), author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biblical Researches,</span><span class="font1"> a son of the Rev. William Robinson,&nbsp;of Puritan ancestry, was born at Southington, Connecticut,&nbsp;United States, on 10th April 1794. He was educated at&nbsp;Hamilton College, New York, where he graduated in 1816.&nbsp;He served as a tutor at the college during 1817-18, and&nbsp;then engaged in private study of the Greek classics until&nbsp;1821, when he went to Andover, Massachusetts, in order&nbsp;to publish an edition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iliad.</span><span class="font1"> There he became a&nbsp;pupil of Moses Stuart, the enthusiastic professor of Biblical&nbsp;studies in the theological seminary, and was made instructor of Hebrew there in 1823. In 1826 he resigned&nbsp;his position at Andover and went to Europe, where he&nbsp;studied Hebreλv under Gesenius at Halle, and also history&nbsp;at Berlin under Neander, remaining in Europe until 1830.&nbsp;In 1828 he married Therese Albertine Luise von Jakob,&nbsp;daughter of an eminent professor of philosophy at Halle.&nbsp;This highly cultured lady was already well known as an&nbsp;authoress under the pseudonym of “ Talvj.” She became&nbsp;of great assistance to her husband in his learned pursuits. In 1830 he was again called to Andover as professor extraordinary of Biblical literature, and entered&nbsp;with enthusiasm upon the work of instruction and the&nbsp;publication of scholarly works upon the Bible. In 1831&nbsp;he founded the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biblical Repository,</span><span class="font1"> a theological review&nbsp;which introduced a new era in theological periodicals in&nbsp;America, and which subsequently passed over into the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliotheca Sacra.</span><span class="font1"> In the same year he received the&nbsp;degree of D.D. from Dartmouth College. In 1832 he&nbsp;published a revised edition of Taylor’s translation of&nbsp;Calmet’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of the Bible,</span><span class="font1"> and in the ensuing year&nbsp;a popular </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionary of the Bible</span><span class="font1"> and a translation of&nbsp;Buttmann’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Greek Grammar</span><span class="font1"> (3d ed., 1851). Such severe&nbsp;literary work deprived him of his health and he was&nbsp;compelled to resign his professorship. He now devoted&nbsp;himself entirely to literary pursuits for some years.&nbsp;In 1834 he published a revised edition of Newcome’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Greek Harmony of the Gospels.</span><span class="font1"> In 1836 he issued a&nbsp;translation of Gesenius’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hebrew Lexicon</span><span class="font1"> and in the same&nbsp;year a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">These lexicons have been the companions of Biblical&nbsp;students until the present time, having passed through&nbsp;a series of revisions. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hebrew Lexicon</span><span class="font1"> reached a fifth&nbsp;edition in 1854, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Greek Lexicon</span><span class="font1"> a second edition in&nbsp;1847. They are both now (1885) passing through another&nbsp;revision by his pupils. In 1837 Robinson was called to&nbsp;the professorship of Biblical literature in the Union Theological Seminary, New York, in which position he remained until his death, giving it the reputation of his&nbsp;scholarship and the benefits of his great experience in&nbsp;Biblical study and practical skill in instruction. In his&nbsp;letter of acceptance he gave an outline of the field of&nbsp;Biblical study which showed his mastery of the subject&nbsp;and his forecast of its future in America. He accepted&nbsp;this position with the understanding that he should&nbsp;receive leave of absence for some years in order to explore&nbsp;the lands of the Bible. He spent a considerable portion&nbsp;of the year 1838 in these explorations and became the&nbsp;pioneer and father of modern Biblical geography. He&nbsp;published his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biblical Researches</span><span class="font1"> in 1841 in three volumes,&nbsp;simultaneously in Berlin and Boston. His services were&nbsp;recognized by a gold medal from the Royal Geographical&nbsp;Society of London in 1842, the degree of D.D. from the&nbsp;university of Halle in 1842, and the degree of LL.D. from&nbsp;Yale College in 1844. In 1852 he made a second visit to&nbsp;Palestine and published its results in the supplemental&nbsp;volume to the second edition of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biblical Researches</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;1856. The third edition of the whole work appeared in&nbsp;1867 in three volumes. Robinson regarded these researches&nbsp;as preliminary to a systematic work on the geography of&nbsp;the Bible; but he was spared only to complete a mere&nbsp;fragment, which was published posthumously under the&nbsp;title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Physical Geography of the Holy Land</span><span class="font1"> in 1865.&nbsp;In 1845 Robinson also issued a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Greek Harmony of the&nbsp;Gospels</span><span class="font1"> and in 1846 an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">English Harmony,</span><span class="font1"> both of which&nbsp;have passed through many editions and have remained&nbsp;the standard text-books in America until the present day.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Greek Harmony</span><span class="font1"> has renewed its life in a revised&nbsp;edition by Professor Riddle in 1885. Besides these more&nbsp;important works he published from time to time a vast&nbsp;number of articles in periodicals, and in 1859 a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoir&nbsp;of the Rev. William Robinson,</span><span class="font1"> his father. Robinson was&nbsp;an ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church, but his&nbsp;voice was seldom heard in the pulpit or in ecclesiastical&nbsp;bodies. In his declining years he was afflicted with an&nbsp;incurable disease of the eyes and other maladies. He died&nbsp;in New York City on 27th January 1863.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Robinson’s work in Biblical geography was both fundamental and monumental. Dean Stanley once said, “ Dr Robinson was the&nbsp;first man who saw Palestine with his eyes open to what he ought</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
