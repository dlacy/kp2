<p><label>RESENTMENT</label>
means a ſtrong perception of good or ill, generally a deep ſenſe of injury, and may be diſtinguiſhed into <hi rend="italic">anger</hi> and <hi rend="italic">revenge,</hi> " By anger (ſays Archdeacon Paley), I mean the pain we ſuffer upon the receipt of an injury or affront, with the uſual effects of that pain upon ourſelves. By revenge, the inflicting of pain upon the perfon who has injured or offended us, farther than the juſt ends of puniſhment or reparation require. Anger prompts to revenge ; but it is poſſible to ſuſpend the effect when we cannot altogether quell the principle, we are bound alfo to endeavour to qualify and correct the principle itfelf. So that our duty requires two different applications of the mind : and for that reaſon anger and revenge ihould bc confidered feparately.” See Revenge.</p>
