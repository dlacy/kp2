<p><span class="font0">are accuſtomed , to attend chiefly to the appearances which prognoſticate miſchief, and we interpret the appearances of a permanent bed in the ſame way, and&nbsp;frequently form very falſe judgments. When we ſee&nbsp;one bank low and flat, and the other high and abrupt, we ſuppoſe that the waters are paſſing along&nbsp;the firſt; in peace, and with a gentle ſtream, but that&nbsp;they are rapid on the other ſide, and are tearing away&nbsp;the bank ; but it is juſt the contrary. The bed being permanent, things are in equilibrio, and each bank&nbsp;is of a form juſt competent to that equilibrium. If&nbsp;»he ſoil on both ſides be uniform, the ſtream is moſt&nbsp;rapid on that ſide where the bank is low and flat,&nbsp;for in no other form would it withſtand the action of&nbsp;the ſtream ; and it has been worn away till its flatneſs&nbsp;compenſates for the greater force of the ſtream. The&nbsp;ſtream on the other ſide muſt be more gentle, otherwiſe&nbsp;the bank could not remain abrupt. In ſhort, in a ſtate&nbsp;of permanency, the velocity of the ſtream and form of&nbsp;the bank are juſt ſuited to each other. It is quite&nbsp;otherwiſe before the river has acquired its proper regimen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A careful conſideration therefore of the general features of rivers which have ſettled their regimen, is of uſe for informing us concerning their internal motions,&nbsp;and directing us to the moſt effectual methods of regulating their courſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have already ſaid that perpendicular brims are inconſiſtent with ſtability. A ſemicircular ſection is&nbsp;the form which would produce the quickeſt train of a&nbsp;river whoſe expence and Hope are given ; but the banks&nbsp;at B and D (fig. 14.) would crumble in, and lie at the&nbsp;bottom, where their horizontal ſurface would ſecure them&nbsp;from farther change. The bed will acquire the form&nbsp;G </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> F, of equal ſection, but greater width, and with&nbsp;brims leſs ſhelving. The proportion of the velocities&nbsp;at A and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> may be the fame with that of the velocities&nbsp;at A and C ; but the velocity at G and F will be leſs&nbsp;than it was formerly at B, C, or D; and the velocity&nbsp;in any intermediate point E, being ſomewhat between&nbsp;thoſe at F and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c,</span><span class="font0"> muſt be leſs than it was in any intermediate point of the ſemicircular bed. The velocities&nbsp;will therefore decreaſe along the border ſrom </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> towards&nbsp;G and F, and the ſteepneſs of the border will augment&nbsp;at the ſame time, till, in every point of the new border&nbsp;GcF, theſe two circumſtances will be ſo adjuſted that&nbsp;the neceſſary equilibrium is eſtabliſhed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſame thing muſt happen in our trapezium. The ſlope of the brims may be exact, and will be retained ;&nbsp;it will, however, be too great anywhere below, where&nbsp;the velocity is greater, and the ſides will be worn away&nbsp;till the bankδ are undermined and crumble down, and&nbsp;the river will maintain its ſection by increaſing its&nbsp;width. In ſhort, no border made up of ſtraight lines&nbsp;is conſiſtent with that gradation of velocity which will&nbsp;take place whenever we depart from a ſemicircular form.&nbsp;And we accordingly ſee, that in all natural channels the&nbsp;ſection has a curvilineal border, with the ſlope increaſing&nbsp;gradually from the bottom to the brim.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe obſervations will enable us to underſtand how nature operates when the inequality of ſurface or of tenacity obliges the current to change its direction, and&nbsp;the river forms an elbow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Suppoſinjg always that the diſcharge continues the fame, and that the mean velocity is either preſerved or</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">reſtored, the following conditions are neceſſary for a permanent regimen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ί. The depth of </span><span class="font1">water muſt be greater in the elbow </span><span class="font0">than anywhere elſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main ſtream, after having ſtruck the concave&nbsp;bank, muſt be reflected in an equal angle, and muſt then&nbsp;be in the direction of the next reach of the river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The angle of-incidence muſt be proportioned to&nbsp;the tenacity of the ſoil.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There muſt be in the elbow an increaſe of ſlope,&nbsp;or of head of water, capable of overcoming the reſiſtance occaſioned by the elbow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sub>s</sub> The reaſonableneſs, at leaſt, of theſe conditions will appear from the following conſiderations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">]. It is certain that force is expended in producing this change of direction in a channel which by ſuppoſition diminiſhes the current. The diminution aτifing&nbsp;from any cauſe which can be compared with friction&nbsp;muſt be greater when the ſtream is directed againſt&nbsp;one of the banks. It may be very difficult to ſtate the&nbsp;proportion, and it would occupy too mach of our time&nbsp;to attempt it ; but it is ſufficient that we be convinced&nbsp;that the retardation is greater in this caſe. We ſee no&nbsp;cauſe to increaſe the mean velocity in the elbow, and&nbsp;we muſt therefore conclude that it is diminiſhed. But&nbsp;we are ſuppoſing that the diſcharge continues the ſame;&nbsp;the ſection muſt therefore augment, or the channel increaſe its tranſverſe dimenſions. The only queſtion is,&nbsp;In what manner it does this, and what change of form&nbsp;does it affect, and what form is competent to the final&nbsp;equilibrium and the conſequent permanency of the bed ?&nbsp;Here there is much room for conjecture. Mr Buat&nbsp;reaſons as ſollows. If we ſuppoſe that the points B&nbsp;and C (fig. 15.) continue on a level, and that the&nbsp;points H and I at the beginning of the next reach are&nbsp;alſo on a level, it is an inevitable conſequence that the&nbsp;ſlope along CMl muſt be greater than along BEH,&nbsp;becauſe the depreſſion of H below B is equal to that of&nbsp;I below C, and BEH is longer than CMI. Therefore&nbsp;the velocity along the convex bank CMI muſt be greater than along BEH. There may even be a ſtagnation&nbsp;and an eddy in the contrary direction along the concave&nbsp;bank. Therefore, if the form of the ſection were the&nbsp;ſame as up the ſtream, the ſides could not ſtand on the&nbsp;convex bank. When therefore the ſection has attained&nbsp;a permanent form, and the banks are again in equilibrio with the action of the current, the convex bank&nbsp;muſt be much flatter than the concave. If the water is&nbsp;really ſtill on the concave bank, that bank will be abfo-lutely perpendicular ; nay, may overhang.—Accordingly, this ſtate of things is matter of daily obſervation, and&nbsp;juſtiſies our reaſoning, and entitles us to ſay, that this is&nbsp;the nature of the internal motion of the filaments which&nbsp;we cannot diſtinctly obſerve. The water moves moſt&nbsp;rapidly along the convex bank, and the thread of the&nbsp;ſtream is neareſt to this ſide. Reaſoning in this way,&nbsp;the ſection, which we may ſuppoſe to have been originally of the form MiaE (fig. 16.) aſſumes the ſhape&nbsp;MBAE.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. Without preſuming to know the mechaniſm of the internal motions of fluids, we know that ſuperſicial&nbsp;waves are reflected preciſely as if they were ehtſtſe bodies, making the angles of incidence and reflection equal,.&nbsp;In as far therefore as the ſuperficial wave is concerned&nbsp;in the operation, Mr Buat’s ſecond poſition is juſt».</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
