But in what manner the remora performs this, we have no account.</p><p>REMORSE, in its worſt ſenſe, means that pain or anguiſh which one feels after having committed fome bad action. It alſo means tenderneſs, pity, or ſym-pathetic forrow. It is moſt generally uſed in a bad ſenfe, and is applied to perſons who feel compunction for feme great crime, as murder and ſuch like. Mur-ders which have been committed with the utmoſt cir-cumſpection and ſecrecy, and the authors of which could never have been diſcovered by any human inveſtigation, have bcen frequently unfolded by the remorſe and confeſſion of the perpetrators, and that too many years afterwards. Οί this there are numerous inſtances, which are well authenticated, and which are ſo generally known that it is needleſs to relate them here. See Repentance.</p><p>REMPHAN, an idol or Pagan god whom St Stephen ſays the Iſraelites worſhipped in the wilderneſs as they paſſed from Egypt to the land of Promiſe : “Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the ſtar of your god Remphan ; figures which ye made to worſhip them.” That the martyr here quotes the foIlowing words of the prophet Amos, all commentators are a-greed : " Ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch, and Chiun your images, the ſtar of your god, which ye made to yourfelves.” But if this coincidence be-tween the Chriſtian preacher and the Jewiſh prophet be admitted, it follows, that <hi rend="italic">Chiun</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Remphan</hi>  are two names of one and the fame deity. This is indeed farther evident from the LXX tranſlators having ſub-ſtituted in their verſion the word ι<hi rend="sup">,</hi>α&lt;i&gt;α&gt;'<hi rend="sub">j</hi>  inſtead of <hi rend="italic">Chiun,</hi>  which we read in the Hebrew and Engliſh Bibles. But the queſtion which ſtill remains to be anſwered is, what god was worſhipped by the name of <hi rend="italic">Remphan, Raiphan,</hi>  cr <hi rend="italic">Chiun ?</hi>  for about the other divi-nity here mentioned there is no difputc. See Moloch.</p><p>That <hi rend="italic">Chiun</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Remphan</hi>  was an Egyptian divinity, cannot be queſtioned ; for at the era of the <hi rend="italic">Exodus</hi>  the Hebrews muſt have been ſtrangers to the idolatrous worſhip of all other nations ; nor are they ever accuſed of any other than Egyptian idolatries during their 40 years wanderings in the wilderneſs, till towards the end of that period that they became infected by the Moa-bites with the worſhip of <hi rend="italic">Baal-peor.</hi>  That <hi rend="italic">Moloch, Mo-leck, Melek,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Milcom,</hi>  in its original acceptation denotes a <hi rend="italic">king</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">chief,</hi>  is known to every oriental ſcholar ; and therefore when it is uſed as the name of a god, it undoubtedly ſignifies the <hi rend="italic">fun,</hi>  and is the fame divinity with the <hi rend="italic">Egyptian Oβris.</hi>  Reaſoning in this way many critics, and we believe Selden is in the number, have concluded that <hi rend="italic">Chiun,</hi>  and of courſe <hi rend="italic">Remphan,</hi>  is the planet <hi rend="italic">Saturn ;</hi>  becauſe <hi rend="italic">Chiun</hi>  is written <hi rend="italic">Ciun, Cevaη, Ceuan, Chevvin ;</hi>  all of which are modern oriental names of that planet.</p><p>But againſt this hypotheſis inſurmountable objections preſent themſelves to our minds. It is univerſally allowed (ſee Polytheism), that the firſt objects of idolatrous worſhip were theÿh» and <hi rend="italic">moon,</hi>  conſidered</p><p>as the king and queen of heaven. The fixed ſtars, indeed, and the planets, were afterwards gradually admit -ted into the Pagan rubric ; but we may be ſure that thoſe would be firſt aſſociated with the two prime luminaries which moſt refembled them in brightneſs, and were ſuppoſed to be moſt benignant to man. But the planet Saturn appears to the naked eye with ſo feeble a luſtre, that, in the infancy of aſtronomy, it could not make ſuch an impreffidn on the mind as to excite that admiration which we muſt conceive to have always preceded planetary worſhip. It is to be ob-ſerved, too, that by the Pagan writers of antiquity Saturn is conſtantly repreſented as a ſtar of baleful influence. He is termed the <hi rend="italic">leaden planet ;</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">planet of </hi><hi rend="italic">malevolent afpect <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi>  the <hi rend="italic">difmal,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">inhumaneβar.</hi>  That the Egyptians, at ſo early a period as that under conſi-deration, ſhould have adored as one of their greateſt g®ds a planet obfcure in its appearance, diſtant in its ſituation, and baleful in its influence, is wholly incredible.</p><p>There is, however, another ſtar which they might naturally adore, and which we know they actually did adore, as one of their moſt beneficent gods, at a very early period. This is the ασ7fαxvω∕ <hi rend="sub">or</hi><hi rend="italic">σnςu&gt;ς</hi><hi rend="sub">0</hi>f the Greeks, the<hi rend="italic">earns</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">βella canicularis</hi>  of the Romans, and the <hi rend="italic">dog-βar</hi>  of modern Eurbpe. By the Egyptians it was called <hi rend="italic">Sothis</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Soth,</hi>  which ſignifies y⅛∕i√y, <hi rend="italic">beηeβeηce, fecundity ;</hi>  and it received this name, becauſe making its appearance ip the heavens at the very time when the Nile overflowed the country, it was ſuppoſed to regulate the inundation. Οη this account Plutarch <hi rend="italic">(If. et Oβr.}</hi>  tells us, they believed the foul of their illuſtrious benefactreſs <hi rend="italic">Ifis</hi>  to have tranſmigrated into the ftar0'o∕Z&gt;zj,∙ which they therefore worſhipped as the divinity which rendered their country fruitful. It made its appearance, too, on the firſt day of the month <hi rend="italic">Thοth(K),</hi>  which· was the beginning of the Egyptian year, and as ſuch celebrated with feaſting and feſtivity ; and being by much the brighteſt ſtar in the heavens, Horopollo <hi rend="italic">(cap.</hi>  3.) informs us it was conſidered as ſovereign over the reſt. A combination of fo many import-ant circumſtances might have induced a people leſs ſuperſtitious than the Egyptians to pay divine homage to that glorious luminary, which was confounded with <hi rend="italic">Iβs,</hi>  who had been long regarded with the higheſt ve-neration ; and as Iſis was the wife and lifter of oſiris, and always aſſociated with him, the ſtar of Iſis or <hi rend="italic">Remphan</hi>  was naturally aſſociated with <hi rend="italic">Moloch,</hi>  the fame with· oſiris.</p><p>But it will be aſked, how the ſtar which by the E-gyptians was called <hi rend="italic">Soth</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Sothis</hi>  came to be woiſhip-ped by the Hebrews under the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Chiun</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Remphan ?</hi>  This is a very pertinent queſtion, and we ^ ſhall endeavour to anſwer it.</p><p>Every one knows that the pronunciation of oriental, words is very uncertain ; and that as the vowels were often omitted in writing, it is of very little importance to the meaning how they be ſupplied, provided we re-tain the radical conſonants. The word <hi rend="italic">Chiun</hi>  may with equal propriety be written <hi rend="italic">Kiun, Kion,</hi>  or even <hi rend="italic">Kyoη,</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi>  This was the caſe at a very remote period ; but- it is otherwiſe at preſent, owing to the <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">Precession</hi></hi><hi rend="italic">  of the Equinoxes.</hi>  See that article.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
