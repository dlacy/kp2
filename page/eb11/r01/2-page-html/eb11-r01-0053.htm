<p><span class="font0">Jackson, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dalmatia, the Quarnero and Istria</span><span class="font0"> (Oxford, 1887), gives the best account of Ragusan architecture and antiquities. The&nbsp;most accurate native history is G. Gelcich (Gelčić), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dello Sviluppo&nbsp;civile di Ragusa</span><span class="font0"> (Ragusa, 1884). The course of Ragusan trade may&nbsp;be studied in C J.

<p><span class="font1">RAGUSA, a town of Sicily in the province of Syracuse, 70 m. S. W. of Syracuse by rail and 32 m. direct. It consists&nbsp;of an upper (Ragusa Superiore) and a lower town (Ragusa&nbsp;Inferiore), each of which forms a separate commune. Pop.&nbsp;(1906) of the former, 35, 529; of the latter, 866. It has some&nbsp;churches with fine Gothic architecture, and is commercially&nbsp;of some importance, a stone impregnated with bitumen being&nbsp;quarried and prepared for use for paving slabs by being ex-posed to the action of fire. On the hill occupied by the castle&nbsp;of Ragusa Inferiore stood the ancient Hybla Heraea, a Sicel&nbsp;town, under the walls of which Hippocrates of Gela fell in&nbsp;491 </span><span class="font0">B. C.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">A Greek settlement seems to have arisen in the neighbourhood close to the present railway station, about the middle&nbsp;of the 6th century b. c., and to have disappeared at the end&nbsp;of the 5th. Orsi points out that the remains (cuttings in the&nbsp;rock and a part of the castle wall), attributed by Freeman&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Sicily</span><span class="font1">, i. 163) to Sicel times, are in reality post-Roman.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAHWAY, a city of Union county, New Jersey, U. S. A., in the north-eastern part of the state, on the Rahway river&nbsp;and about 20 m. S. W. of New York City. Pop. (1890) 7105;&nbsp;(1900) 7935, of whom 1345 were foreign-born; (1910 U. S.&nbsp;census) 9337. Rahway is served by the main line of the&nbsp;Pennsylvania railroad, and is connected with neighbouring&nbsp;cities by electric fines. It has wide streets and attractive&nbsp;parks, and is, to some extent, a residential suburb of New York&nbsp;and other neighbouring cities. It has a public library (1864),&nbsp;with upwards of 17, 000 volumes, and about 1½ m. distant is&nbsp;the New Jersey Reformatory (1903), to which prisoners between&nbsp;the ages of sixteen and thirty may be sentenced instead of&nbsp;to the State Prison. There are various manufactures. Rahway&nbsp;was first settled in 1720, and was named in honour of the Indian&nbsp;chief Rahwack, whose tribe owned the site and the surrounding&nbsp;territory; it was chartered as a city in 1858. For many&nbsp;years Rahway was popularly known as Spank town, and in&nbsp;January 1777, during the λVar of Independence, a skirmish,&nbsp;known as the battle of Spanktown, was fought here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAICHUR. a town of India, in the state of Hyderabad, at the junction of the Madras and Great Indian Peninsula railways,&nbsp;351 m. N. E. from Madras. Pop. (1901) 22, 165. It gives its&nbsp;name to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">doab,</span><span class="font1"> or tract between the rivers Kistna and Tunga-bhadra, which was the scene of much fighting between Mahom-medans and Hindus as debatable land during the 16th century.&nbsp;It contains a well-preserved fort and two old mosques. It is a&nbsp;thriving centre of trade, with several cotton-presses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAID, in the language of international law, an invasion by armed forces, unauthorized and unrecognized by any state,&nbsp;of the territory of a state which is at peace. Piracy is the&nbsp;attack on the high sea of any vessel by an armed vessel, not&nbsp;authorized or recognized by any state, for the purpose of&nbsp;robbery. A raid for the purpose of carrying off movable&nbsp;property and converting it* to the use of the captors would&nbsp;still be distinguishable from piracy, because it was committed&nbsp;on territory subject to an exclusive territorial jurisdiction.&nbsp;Where the attack or invasion by an armed ship not authorized&nbsp;or recognized by any state is not for the purpose of capturing&nbsp;property, it is properly speaking a raid and not piracy. An&nbsp;attack though in time of peace, by armed forces authorized or&nbsp;recognized by a regular government, is not a raid but an act&nbsp;of war, there being a government responsible for the act committed. The fact of any act being authorized, not by the&nbsp;supreme government, but by a chartered company, or by&nbsp;its governing officer, makes no difference in international law,&nbsp;the directorate of a chartered company exercising its powers&nbsp;by delegation of the state under which it holds its charter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The acts of its armed forces cannot in reason be distinguished from the acts of the armed forces of the state government.&nbsp;Thus compensation is just as much due for them as for the&nbsp;deliberate acts of the state itself, and any claim of an injured&nbsp;state can only be preferred against the state to which the&nbsp;company belongs. Invasion by the regular forces of a state,&nbsp;or by the regular forces of its delegated authority, being an&nbsp;act of war, the laws of war apply to it, and, on capture, such&nbsp;forces, or any members or part of such forces, are prisoners&nbsp;of war. On the other hand, the state whose subordinate&nbsp;authorities commit acts of war against a friendly state has&nbsp;the option of following them up as a commencement of hostilities,&nbsp;or of giving satisfactory compensation to the invaded state.&nbsp;Where the invasion is not by forces subject to the orders of a&nbsp;state, the invaded state has the right to apply its own laws&nbsp;for the repression of disturbances in its territory. Thus, in&nbsp;the so-called Jameson Raid, the Transvaal government had&nbsp;no right to treat Dr Jameson, an officer holding his powers&nbsp;under the British government, and his subordinates, as outlaws, and it was probably so advised, and the British government owed proper compensation for an act for the consequences&nbsp;of which, under international law, it was responsible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">British domestic law punishes raiding under the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 90). @@<sup>1</sup> Section II</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;this act provides as follows. —“If any person within the&nbsp;limits of His Majesty’s dominions, and without the licence of&nbsp;His Majesty prepares or fits out any naval or military expedition to proceed against the dominions of any friendly&nbsp;state, the following consequences shall ensue: (1) Every&nbsp;person engaged in such preparation or fitting out, or assisting therein, or employed in any capacity in such expedition,&nbsp;shall be guilty of an offence against this act, and shall be&nbsp;punishable by fine and imprisonment or either of such punishments, at the discretion of the Court before which the offender&nbsp;is convicted; and imprisonment, if awarded, may be either&nbsp;with or without hard labour. (2) All ships and their equipments, and all arms and munitions of war, used in or forming&nbsp;part of such expedition, shall be forfeited by His Majesty. ”&nbsp;Section 12 provides for the punishment of accessaries as&nbsp;principal offenders, and section 13 limits the term of imprisonment for any offence under the act to two years. In the&nbsp;Sandoval case (1886), @@<sup>2</sup> in which Colonel Sandoval, who was&nbsp;not a British subject, bought guns and ammunition and shipped&nbsp;them to Antwerp, where they were put on board a vessel,&nbsp;which afterwards made an attack on Venezuela, it was held&nbsp;that the offence of fitting out and preparing an expedition&nbsp;within British territory against a friendly state, under this&nbsp;section, is sufficiently constituted by the purchase of guns&nbsp;and ammunition in the British Empire, and their shipment for&nbsp;the purpose of being put on board a ship in a foreign port,&nbsp;with knowledge of the purchaser and shipper that they are&nbsp;to be used in a hostile demonstration against such state, though&nbsp;the shipper takes no part in any overt act of war, and the ship&nbsp;is not fully equipped for the expedition within any British&nbsp;port. Under the same section, Dr Jameson, administrator&nbsp;of the British South Africa Company, and his confederates&nbsp;were tried before the Central Criminal Court and sentenced&nbsp;to different terms of imprisonment. @@<sup>3</sup> The offence committed&nbsp;under a British act is, of course, that of preparing and fitting&nbsp;out an expedition on British territory. Any acts subsequently&nbsp;committed by any British expedition on foreign soil are beyond&nbsp;the operation of domestic legislation, and fall to be dealt with&nbsp;by the domestic legislation of the state within which they occur,&nbsp;or by diplomacy, as the case may be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(T.
