Put the water thus boiled, while in full heat, to the reſerved cold part, which ſhould be previouſly put into a barrel or other vessel ; then add 16 pounds of treacle or molasſes, with a few table ſpoonfuls of the eſsence of ſpruce, ſtirring the whole well together ; add half a pint of yeaſt, and keep it in a temperate situation, with the bung hole open, for two days, till the fermentation be abated. Then cloſe it up or bottle it off, and it will be fit for being drunk in a few days afterwards. In North America, and perhaps in other countries, where the black and white ſpruce-firs abound, inſtead of adding the es <hi rend="italic">ſence</hi> of the ſpruce at the ſame time with the molaſtes, they make a decoction of the leaves and ſmall branches of theſe trees, and find the liquor equally good. It is a powerful anti- ſporbutic, and may prove very uſeful in long ſea voyages.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
