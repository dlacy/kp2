<p><span class="font0">confirmed the observation in the case of some other insects a few years later, whilst other observers have extended the&nbsp;observation to over a hundred species. In all these cases half&nbsp;the spermatozoa differ from the other half by the presence of&nbsp;what E. B. Wilson calls the “ X-element,” and which, in the&nbsp;simplest cases, occurs as an unpaired chromosome of the mother&nbsp;cell which passes into one and not the other of the two spermatozoa formed from that mother cell. The matter is still obscure,&nbsp;and it is not certain whether the facts are peculiar to insects or&nbsp;have a parallel in spermatogenesis universally. According to&nbsp;E. B. Wilson, the facts demonstrate that eggs fertilized by&nbsp;spermatozoa with the X-element invariably produce females&nbsp;(see Sex). The female gamete or ovum is in a large number of&nbsp;cases expanded by the presence of food-yolk and protective&nbsp;swathings to form the visible mass known as an egg, and the&nbsp;production of embryos from eggs has been studied from the time&nbsp;of Aristotle and Pliny. Galen had described the human ovaries&nbsp;as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">testes muliebres,</span><span class="font0"> and W. Harvey in 1651 showed that the chick&nbsp;arose from the cicatricula of the yolk of the egg, compared these&nbsp;early stages with corresponding stages in the uterus of mammals,&nbsp;and laid down the general proposition—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ovum esse primordium&nbsp;commune omnibus animalibus—</span><span class="font0">that the ovum is a starting-point common to all animals. In 1664 N. Steno identified the&nbsp;sexual organ of the mammalian female with that of sharks, and&nbsp;first named it the ovary. In 1672 R. De Graaf described the&nbsp;structure of the ovary in birds and mammals, observed the ovum&nbsp;in the oviduct of the rabbit, and repeated Harvey’s statement as&nbsp;to the universal occurrence of ova, although he mistook for ova&nbsp;the follicles that now bear his name. In 1825 J. E. Purkyne&nbsp;described the germinal vesicle in the chick, thus distinguishing&nbsp;hetween the structure of the egg as a whole and the essential&nbsp;germinal area, and in 1827 K. E. von Baer definitely traced the&nbsp;ovum back from the uterus to the oviduct and thence to its origin&nbsp;within the Graafian follicle in the ovary, and thus paved the way&nbsp;for identification of the ovum as a distinct cell arising from the&nbsp;germinal tissue of the ovary. The ovum or female gamete, unlike&nbsp;the spermatozoon, is a large cell, in most cases visible to the&nbsp;naked eye even in the ovary. Also, in definite contrast with the&nbsp;spermatozoon, it is a passive non-motile cell, although in certain&nbsp;cases it is capable of protruding pseudopodia. It is usually&nbsp;spherical, contains a large nucleus, a centrosome and abundant&nbsp;protoplasm, and is generaUy enclosed in a stout membrane which&nbsp;may or may not have a special aperture known as the micro-pyle. The protoplasm of all eggs contains nutritive material&nbsp;for the nourishment of the future embryo, and this material&nbsp;may be sufficient in quantity to make the whole cell, although&nbsp;remaining microscopic, conspicuously large, or to expand it to the&nbsp;relatively enormous mass of the yellow yolk of a fowl’s egg.&nbsp;Finally, the cellular nature of the ovum is frequently further&nbsp;disguised by its being enclosed in a series of membranes such as&nbsp;the aIbumen and shell of the fowl’s egg. Such complexities are&nbsp;ancillary to the growth or protection of the future embryo, and&nbsp;from the general biological point of view the ovum is to be&nbsp;regarded as a specialized cell derived from the germinal tissue&nbsp;of the ovary, just as the spermatozoon is a specialized cell derived&nbsp;from the corresponding stock of germinal material in the testis.&nbsp;The number of ova produced varies from a very few, as in mammals&nbsp;and birds, to a very large number, as in the herring and many&nbsp;invertebrates, but in all cases the number is relatively small&nbsp;compared with that of the spermatozoa produced by the male&nbsp;of the same species. The details of ovogenesis are more sharply&nbsp;divided than in the case of spermatogenesis into processes&nbsp;connected with the production of a crop of large cells bloated&nbsp;with food-yolk, and the peculiar nuclear changes. The latter&nbsp;changes are generally spoken of as the maturation of the ovum,&nbsp;and in most cases do not begin until the full size has been&nbsp;attained. As in the nuclear changes of spermatogenesis, the&nbsp;details differ in different animals, but the salient feature is that&nbsp;the mature ovum contains, like the ripe spermatozoon, half the&nbsp;number of chromosomes normal to the tissue cells of the animal&nbsp;to which it belongs. The simplest form in which the reduction&nbsp;takes place is that the nucleus of the ovum divides by an ordinary&nbsp;division, each chromosome splitting and sharing itself between&nbsp;the daughter nuclei. Of these nuclei one is extruded from the&nbsp;egg, forming what is called a polar body, and this polar body may&nbsp;again divide by a reducing division, so as to form two polar&nbsp;bodies, each with half the normal number of chromosomes.&nbsp;Finally, the daughter nucleus, remaining in the ovum, also&nbsp;divides by a reducing division, and one of the segments remains&nbsp;to form the nucleus of the ripe ovum, with half the normal&nbsp;number of chromosomes, whilst the other is extruded as a polar&nbsp;body. Very many suggestions as to the meaning of the extrusion of the polar bodies have been made, but the least fanciful&nbsp;of these is to regard the ovum ready for maturation as homologous with the cell about to divide into four spermatozoa; in&nbsp;each case the nucleus divides twice and one of the divisions is a&nbsp;reducing division, so that four daughter nuclei are formed each&nbsp;with half the normal number of chromosomes. Many spermatozoa are required, and each of the four becomes the nucleus&nbsp;of a complete active cell; relatively few ova are required, but&nbsp;each has a large protoplasmic body, and only one of the four&nbsp;becomes a functional mature egg, the other three being simply&nbsp;extruded and so to say wasted. It must be remembered,&nbsp;however, that there is no inherent probability in favour of the&nbsp;apparently simplest explanation of a very complex biological&nbsp;process. It is also to be noted that in many cases the first polar&nbsp;body does not divide, and it is not clearly established that when&nbsp;the first polar body remains single, it is always the result of a&nbsp;normal nuclear division.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the mature ova and spermatozoa come together in one of the various ways to be discussed later, fertilization, the conjugation of the gametes to form thc zygote, occurs. Alcmaeon&nbsp;(580 b.c.) is believed first to have laid down that fertilization&nbsp;in animals and plants consisted in the material union of the&nbsp;sexual products from both sexes, but it was not until 1761 that&nbsp;it was established experimentally by J. T. Kolreuteris work on&nbsp;the hybridization of plants. In 1780 L. SpalIanzani artificigjly&nbsp;fertilized the eggs of the frog and tortoise, and successfully&nbsp;introduced seminal fluid into the uterus of the bitch, but came&nbsp;to the erroneous conclusion that it was the fluid medium and&nbsp;not the spermatozoa that caused fertilization. This error was&nbsp;corrected in 1824 by J. L. Prevost and J. B. Dumas, who showed&nbsp;that filtration destroyed the fertilizing power of the fluid. In&nbsp;1843 M. Barry observed spermatozoa within the egg of the rabbit,&nbsp;whilst in 1849 R. Leuckart observed the fertilization of the&nbsp;frog’s egg, and in 1851 H. Nelson noticed the entrance of spermatozoa to the egg of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ascaris,</span><span class="font0"> whilst in 1854 a series of observations published independently by T. L. W. Bischoff and Allen&nbsp;Thomson finally and definitely established the fact that ova were&nbsp;fertilized by the actual entrance of spermatozoa. Further&nbsp;advances in microscopical methods enabled a series of observers,&nbsp;of whom the most notable were E. van Beneden, H. Fol and&nbsp;O. Hertwig, to follow and record the details of the process. They&nbsp;made it clear that the chief event in fertilization was entrance&nbsp;into the ovum of the nucleus or head of the spermatozoon&nbsp;where it formed the “ male pronucleus,” which gradually&nbsp;approached and fused with the female pronucleus or residual&nbsp;nucleus of the ovum. Still later observers, of whom E. B.&nbsp;Wilson is the most conspicuous, have studied the details of&nbsp;the process in many different animals and have shown that&nbsp;the nucleus of the spermatozoon invariably enters the ovum,&nbsp;that the centrosome generally does so, and that the cytoplasm&nbsp;usually plays no part. The nucleus of the zygote or fertilized&nbsp;ovum, then, possesses the number of chromosomes normal in&nbsp;the tissue cells of the animal to which it belongs, but of these&nbsp;half belong to the female gamete and are derived from the&nbsp;germ plasm of the parental ovary, and half to the male gamete&nbsp;or spermatozoon, derived from the germ plasm of the parental&nbsp;testis. The stimulus which leads to and induces the conjugation&nbsp;<sup>r</sup>Of the gametes appears to be chemotactic and to consist of some&nbsp;substance positively attractive to the male gamete, liberated&nbsp;by the mature female gamete, but the attraction is mutual,&nbsp;and in the final stages of approach a protoplasmic outgrowth of&nbsp;the ovum towards the spermatozoon frequently occurs.
