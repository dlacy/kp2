<p><span class="font1">But ſomething farther may be yet ſaid in defence of this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">artificial</span><span class="font1"> delivery, as our author calls it. Is not&nbsp;the movement of any thing, of whatever ſpecies, when&nbsp;dignified or ſolemn, in general of an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">equable</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">deliberate</span><span class="font1"> nature (as in the minuet, the military ſtep, &amp;c.) ?&nbsp;And in theatrical declamation, is not the propenſity to&nbsp;introduce this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">equab!enefs</span><span class="font1"> ſo ſtrong, that it is almoſt </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ιm-poflible</span><span class="font1"> to avoid it wholly, were we ever ſo determined&nbsp;to do it ? If thele two queries be anſwered in the affirmative (as we are perſuaded they will), while the ſirſt&nbsp;ſupports our argument for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">propriety</span><span class="font1"> of the manner of&nbsp;delivery in queſtion, the ſecond diſcovers a kind of ne-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cefiity</span><span class="font1"> for it. And that this manner may be carried a&nbsp;little </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">farther</span><span class="font1"> in quantity on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fiage</span><span class="font1"> than is uſual in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">real life,</span><span class="font1"> the principle (IV.) of heightening nature will&nbsp;juſtify, provided faſlrion (which has ever fomething to&nbsp;do in theſe articles) give it a fonction ; for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">precife&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">quantity of ſeveral heightenings may be varied by this&nbsp;great legiſlator almoſt at will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emphafis.</span><span class="font1"> As </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphafis</span><span class="font1"> is not a thing annexed to particular words, as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">accent</span><span class="font1"> is to ſyllables, but owes its&nbsp;riſe chiefly to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">meaning</span><span class="font1"> of a paffage, and muſt therefore vary its feat according as that meaning varies, it&nbsp;will be neceffary to explain </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">little farther the general&nbsp;idea given of it above.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;♦</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Οί mart’s ſirſt diſobedience,’ and the fruit Of that forbidden tree, whoſe mortal taſte&nbsp;Brought death into the world, and all our woe, &amp;c.&nbsp;Sing heav’nly muſe, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Suppoſing, in reference to the above well-known lines, that originally other beings, beſides men, had diſ-obeyed the commands of the Almighty, and that the&nbsp;circumſtance were well known to us, there would fall&nbsp;an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emph ιfis</span><span class="font1"> upon the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">man's</span><span class="font1"> in the ſirſt line, and&nbsp;hence it would be read thus ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">man's</span><span class="font1"> ſirſt diſobedience, and the fruit, &amp;e.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But if it were a notorious truth, that mankind had tranſgreffed in a peculiar manner more than once, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphafis</span><span class="font1"> would fall on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">firfi,</span><span class="font1"> and the line be read,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Οί man’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">firfi</span><span class="font1"> diſobedience, &amp;c.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0">Again, admitting death (as was really the caſe). to</span></h3></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">have been an unheard-of and dreadful puniſhment brought upon man in conſequence of his tranſgreſſion 5&nbsp;on that ſuppoſition the third line would be read,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brought </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">death</span><span class="font1"> into the world, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But if we were to ſuppoſe mankind knew there was ſuch an evil as death in other regions, though the place they&nbsp;inhabited had been free from it till their tranſgreſſion ;&nbsp;the line would run thus,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brought death into the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">world,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Now from a proper delivery of the above lines, with regard to any one of the ſuppoſitions we have choſen,&nbsp;out of ſeveral others that might in the ſame manner havc&nbsp;been imagined, it will appear that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphafis</span><span class="font1"> they illuſtrate is effected by a manifeſt </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">delay</span><span class="font1"> in the pronunciation, and a tone ſomething </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fuller</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">louder</span><span class="font1"> than is uſed&nbsp;in ordinary ; and that its office is ſolely to determine&nbsp;the meaning of a ſentence with reference to ſomething&nbsp;foid before, preſuppofed by the author as general knowledge, or in order to remove an, ambiguity where a&nbsp;paffage is capable of having more ſenſes given it than&nbsp;one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But, ſuppoſing in the above example, that none of the ſenſes there pointed out were preciſely the true one,&nbsp;and that the meaning of the lines were no other than&nbsp;what is obviouſiy ſuggeſted by their ſimple conſtruction;&nbsp;in that cafe it may be aſked, if in reading them there&nbsp;ſſiould be no word dignified with the emphatical accom-panyments above deſcribed ?—The anſwer is, Not one&nbsp;with an emphaſis of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jame</span><span class="font1"> kind as that we have juſt&nbsp;been illuſtrating ; yet it is nevertheleſs true, that on&nbsp;hearing theſe lines well read, we ſſiall ſind ſome words,&nbsp;diſtinguiſſied from the reſt by a manner of delivery bordering a little upon it (a). And thefe words will in&nbsp;general be ſuch as ſeem the moſt important in the ſentence, or on other accounts to merit this diſtinction.&nbsp;But as at beſt it only </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">enforces, graces,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">enlivens,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;not </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fixes</span><span class="font1"> the meaning of any paffage, and even caprice&nbsp;and fofliion ( b) have often a hand in determining its&nbsp;place and magnitude, it cannot properly be reckoned an&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ejfential</span><span class="font1"> of delivery. However, it is ot too much moment to be neglected by thoſe who would wiſh to be&nbsp;good readers ; and, for the fake of diſtinction, we may&nbsp;not</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a)</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following lines will illuſtrate both theſe kinds of ſtreffes: For, to convey their right meaning, the&nbsp;word any is evidently to be pronounced louder and fuller than thoſe with the accents over them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Get wealth and place, if poſſible with grace ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If not, by any means get wealth and place. Pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This couplet is accented in the manner we ſind it in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">EJfay on Elocution</span><span class="font1"> by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mafion.</span><span class="font1"> And if, according to the judgment of this author, the words thus diſtinguiſhed are to have an emphatical ſtrefs, it muſt be of the inferior&nbsp;kind above-mentioned, and which a little farther on we call </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphafis of force ;</span><span class="font1"> while the word any in a different type alone poffeffes the other fort ©f energy, and which is there contradiſtinguiſhed by the term </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphafis.&nbsp;ojfinfi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(b)</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among a number of people who have had proper opportunities of learning to read in the beſt manner it&nbsp;is now taught, it would be difficult to ſind two, who, in a given inſtance, would ufe the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphafis oſ force</span><span class="font1"> alike<sub>ft&nbsp;</sub>either as to place or quantity. Nay ſome ſcarce uſe any at all : and others will not ſcruple to carry it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">much</span><span class="font1"> beyond any thing we have a precedent for in common diſcourſe ; and even now and then throw it upon words ſo.&nbsp;very trifling in themſelves, that it is evident they do it with no other view, than for the fake of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">variety</span><span class="font1"> it&nbsp;gives to the modulation.—This practice, like the introduction of diſcords into muſic, may without doubt be indulged now and then ; but were it too frequent, the capital intent of theſe energies would manifeſtly either be&nbsp;deſtroyed or rendered dubious.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
