<p><span class="font0">imperfect and precarious, that the revolutions of the north might eſeape the knowledge of the court of Ravenna ; till the dark cloud which was collected along&nbsp;the coaſt of the Baltic burſt in thunder upon the banks&nbsp;of the Upper Danube. The emperor of the weft, if&nbsp;his miniſters diſturbed his amuſements by the news of&nbsp;the impending danger, was ſatisfied,with being the occaſion and the ſpectator of the war. The ſafety of&nbsp;Rome was intruſted to the counſels and the ſword of&nbsp;Stilicho ; but ſuch was the feeble and exhauſted ſtatc&nbsp;of the empire, that it was impoſſible to reſtore the fortifications of the Danube, or to prevent, by a vigorous&nbsp;effort, the invaſion of the Germans. The hopes of the&nbsp;vigilant miniſter of Honorius were confined to the defence of Italy. He once more abandoned the provinces;&nbsp;recalled the troops ; preſſed the new levies, which were&nbsp;rigorouſly exacted, and puſillanimouſly eluded ; employed the moſt efficacious means to arreſt or allure&nbsp;the deſerters ; and offered the gift of freedom, and of&nbsp;two pieces of gold, to all the ſlaves who would enliſt.&nbsp;By theſe efforts he painfully collected from the ſubjects of a great empire an army of 30,000 or 40,000&nbsp;men ; which, in the days of Scipio or Camillus, would&nbsp;have been inſtantly furniſhed by the free citizens of&nbsp;the territory of Rome. The 30 legions of Stilicho&nbsp;were reinforced by a large body of barbarian auxiliaries ; the faithful Alani were perſonally attached to his&nbsp;ſervice ; and the troops of Huns and of Goths, who&nbsp;inarched under the banners of their native princes&nbsp;Hulden and Sarus, were animated by intereſt and reſentment to oppoſe the ambition of Radagaiſus. The&nbsp;king of the confederate Germans paſſed, without reſiſtance, the Alps, the Po, and the Appenine : leaving&nbsp;on one hand the inacceſſible palace of Honorius, ſe-curely buried among the marſhes of Ravenna; and&nbsp;on the*other, the camp of Stilicho, who had fixed his&nbsp;head-quarters at Ticinum, or Pavia, but who ſeems to&nbsp;have avoided a deciſive battle till he had aſſembled his&nbsp;diſtant forces. Many cities of Italy were pillaged, or&nbsp;deſtroyed ; and the ſiege of Florence by Radagaiſus&nbsp;is one of the earlieſt events in the hiſtory of that celebrated republic, whoſe firmneſs checked and delayed&nbsp;the unlkilful fury of the barbarians. The ſenate and&nbsp;people trembled at their approach within 180 miles of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rome ; and anxiouſly compared the danger which they had eſcaped with the new perils to which they were&nbsp;expoſed. Alaric was a Chriſtian and a ſoldier, the&nbsp;leader of a diſciplined army ; who underſtood the laws&nbsp;of war, who reſpected the ſanctity of treaties, and who&nbsp;had familiarly converſed with the fubjects of the empire in the ſame camps and the ſame churches. The&nbsp;ſavage Radagaiſus was a ſtranger to the manners, the&nbsp;religion, and even the language, of the civilized nations of the fouth. The fierceneſs of his temper was&nbsp;exaſperated by cruel ſuperſtition ; and it was univerſally believed, that he had bound himſelf by a ſolemn&nbsp;vow to reduce the city into a heap of ſtones and aſhes,&nbsp;and to ſacriſice the moſt illuſtrious of the Roman ſenators on the altars of thoſe gods who were appeaſed&nbsp;by human blood. The public danger, which ſhould&nbsp;have reconciled all domeſtic animoſities, diſplayed the&nbsp;incurable madneſs of religious faction. The oppreſſed&nbsp;votaries of Jupiter and Mercury reſpected, in the implacable enemy of Rome, the character of a devout&nbsp;pagan ; loudly declared, that they were more apprehenſive of the ſacrifices than of the arms of Radagai</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">ſus ; and fect<sup>,</sup>etly rejoiced in the calamities of their country, which condemned the faith of their Chriſtian&nbsp;adverfaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Florence was reduced to the laſt extremity ; and the fainting courage of the citizens was ſupported only by&nbsp;the authority of St Ambroſe, who had communicated&nbsp;in a dream the promiſe of a ſpeedy deliverance. On a&nbsp;ſudden they beheld from their walls the banners of Stilicho, who advanced with his united force to the relief&nbsp;of the faithful city-, and who ſoon marked that fatal&nbsp;ſpot ſor the grave of the barbarian hoſt. The apparent&nbsp;contradictions of thoſe writers who variouſly relate the&nbsp;defeat of Radagaiſus, may be reconciled without offering much violence to their reſpective teſtimonies. Oroſius and Auguſtin, who were intimately connected by&nbsp;friendſhip and religion, aſeribe this miraculous victory&nbsp;to the providence of God rather than to the valour of&nbsp;man. They ſtrictly exclude every idea of chance, or&nbsp;even of bloodſhed ; and poſitively affirm, that the Romans, whoſe camp was the ſcene of plenty and idleneſs,&nbsp;enjoyed the diſtreſs of the barbarians, ſlowly expiring&nbsp;on the ſharp and barren ridge of the hills of Fæfulæ,&nbsp;which riſe above the city of Florence. Their extravagant aſſertion, that not a ſingle ſoldier of the Chriſtian&nbsp;army was killed, or even wounded, may be diſmiſſed&nbsp;with ſilent contempt ; but the reſt of the narrative of&nbsp;Auguſtin and Oroſius is conſiſtent with the ſtate of the&nbsp;war and the character of Stilicho. Conſcious that he&nbsp;commanded the laſt army of the republic, his prudence&nbsp;would not expoſe it in the open field to the headſtrong&nbsp;fury of the Germans. The method of ſurrounding the&nbsp;enemy with ſtrong lines of circumvallation, which he&nbsp;had twice employed againſt the Gothic king, was repeated on a larger ſcale, and with more conſiderable&nbsp;effect. The examples of Cæſar muſt have been familiar to the moſt illiterate of the Roman warriors ; and&nbsp;the fortifications of Dyrrhachium, which connected 24&nbsp;caſtles by a perpetual ditch and rampart of 15 miles,&nbsp;afforded the model of an intrenchment which might&nbsp;confine and ſtarve the moſt numerous hoſt of barbarians. The Roman troops had leſs degenerated from&nbsp;the induſtry than from the valour of their anceſtors ;&nbsp;and if the ſervile and laborious work offended the pride&nbsp;of the ſoldiers, Tuſcany could ſupply many thouſand&nbsp;peaſants, who would labour, though perhaps they would</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">not fight, for the ſalvation of their native country.— The impriſoned multitude of horſes and men was gradually deſtroyed by famine, rather than by the ſword ;&nbsp;but the Romans were expoſed, during the progreſs of&nbsp;ſuch an extenſive work, to the frequent attacks of an&nbsp;impatient enemy. The deſpair of the hungry barbarians would precipitate them againſt the fortifications of&nbsp;Stilicho ; the general might ſometimes indulge the ardour of his brave auxiliaries, who eagerly preſſed to aſſault the camp of the Germans ; and theſe various incidents might produce the ſharp and bloody conflicts which&nbsp;dignify the narrative of Zoſimus, and the Chronicles&nbsp;of Proſper and Marcellinus. A ſeaſonable ſupply ot&nbsp;men and proviſions had been introduced into the walls&nbsp;of Florence ; and the famiſhed hoſt of Radagaiſus was&nbsp;in its turn beſieged. The proud monarch of ſo many&nbsp;warlike nations, after the loſs of his braveſt warriors,&nbsp;was reduced to confide either in the faith of a capitulation, or in the clemency of Stilicho. But the death of&nbsp;the royal captive, who was ignominiouſly beheaded, diſgraced the triumph of Rome and of Chriſtianity ; and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
