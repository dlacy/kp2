The drama acquired its greatest celebrity from Lope de Vega and Calde ron. In romance, Spain has accomplished much. The perfection of Spanish prose is to be found in the works of the inimitable Cervantes. After his time, and when the Bourbons ascended the throne, the literature declined with the state, and may be said to have remained ever since in a similar state of inactivity. Spain possesses at the present day few writers known beyond their own country. Jovellanos on political economy, Campany in philology, Llorente in history, Moralez in mathematics, have done much to rouse a spirit of re flection ; and Juan Valdez is called the Anacreon of Spain.</p><p>The army of Spain, once the most formidable and best organized in Europe, is now comparatively in a low state. It is, however, represented as the best organized part of her establishment, the pay being regular, and the officers experienced. In the present unsettled state of the country it is impossible to form any estimate of its actual numbers. Besides the regular army, there is a large body of militia called royalist volunteers, who have frequently proved of great service as light troops. The navy now exists only in name ; in 1823 there was but one ship of the line, which, being sent out to South America, surrendered to the Peruvian government.	(R. R.

This city is situated on a peninsula, and is powerfully fortified both by nature and art. It incloses the space where formerly stood the extensive palace of Diocletian, the Roman emperor. It is now the seat of an archbishop, has a cathedral and several other churches, a seminary, and six religious houses, all for Catholics. It has narrow and crooked streets, 1500 large and antique houses, and 7400 inhabitants. It has considerable trade in salted meat, oil, wine, and fruit. The harbour is secure, and protected by two strong bastions. Lat. 43. 34. 30.

It stands near the mouth of the river Welland, which is navi gable to the town. Of the adjacent district, the soil is rich, but marshy. Besides corn, chiefly oats, it produces much flax and hemp. Spalding has a fine old church, a spacious marketplace, much frequented every Saturday. The famous Dr. Bentley was for a short time master of Spalding school. The inhabitants of the town were in 1811, 4330; in 1821, 5207 ; and in 1831, 6497.</p><p>SPALLANZANI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Lazzaro,</hi> a celebrated naturalist, was born at Scandiano, in the duchy of Modena, on the 12th of January 1729∙ He began his studies in his native country, and at the age of fifteen, went to Reggio de Mo dena, where he was instructed in rhetoric and philosophy by the Jesuits, who contended with the Dominicans in or der to secure his attachment. His thirst for knowledge determined him to go to Bologna, where his relative Laura Bassi, a woman highly celebrated for her genius, eloquence, and skill in natural philosophy and mathematics, was one of the most distinguished professors of Italy. Under this enlightened guide, he was taught to prefer the study of nature to that of her commentators, judging of the real value of the commentary by its resemblance to the original. He availed himself of the wisdom of that lady’s counsels, the happy effects of which he very soon experienced. Spallanzani’s taste for philosophy was not exclusive, for he carefuIly studied his own language, became a proficient in the Latin tongue, and attached himself above every other to the Greek and French. By the advice of a father whom he ardently loved, he applied himself to jurisprudence ; but being urged by Antonio Vallisnieri to renounce his vocation, by procuring the consent of his father, he gave himself up to the study of mathematics with more zeal than ever, at the same time devoting himself to the study of languages, both living and dead.</p><p>It was not long before he was known all over Italy, and, what is seldom the case, his own country first made that estimate of his talents which they justly merited. In the year 1745, he was chosen professor of logic, metaphysics, and Greek, in the university of Reggio, where he taught during ten years, devoting every moment of his leisure to the study and contemplation of the works of nature. The attention of Haller and Bonnet was fixed by his observa</p><p>tions on the animalculæ of infusions, the latter assisting him in his laudable career, and ever after distinguishing him as one of the learned interpreters of nature. He was invited to the university of Modena in 1760 ; and some years after he declined to accept of the advantageous öfters made to him by the academy of Petersburg, as well as similar ones from Coimbra, Parma, and Cesena. He preferred his native spot, and therefore continued at Modena till the year 1768, and saw raised up by his care a generation of men constituting at that time the glory of Italy, among whom we find Venturi, Belloni, Lucchesini, and Angelo Mazzo.</p><p>In 1765, while he resided at Modena, he published his “ Saggio di Osservazioni Microscopiche concernenti il Sistema di Needham e di Buffon ;” in which he establishes, by a number of the most ingenious and solid experiments, the <hi rend="italic">animality of microscopic animalculæ.</hi> This work was sent by the author to Bonnet, who drew from it a prediction respecting the future celebrity of Spallanzani, which he Iived to see accomplished. This circumstance gave birth to the most intimate friendship, which lasted to the close of life, and constituted their chief happiness. During the same year he published a truly original work, entitled “ De Lapidibus ab Aqua resilientibus ;” in which he proves, by the most satisfactory experiments, and in opposition to the common received opinion, that what are called <hi rend="italic">ducks and drakes,</hi> are not produced by the elasticity of the water, but by the effect naturally resulting from the change of direction experienced by the stone in its movement, after it has struck the water, and has been carried over the hollow of the cup formed by the concussion.</p><p>When the university of Padua was reestablished upon a larger scale, the Count de Firmian was directed by the empress Maria Theresa, to invite Spallanzani to be professor of Natural History, although the chair was solicited by many celebrated characters. His reputation justified this prefer ence, and immense crowds of students thronged to his lectures. He possessed much ingenuity, and his knowledge was of vast extent: his method was simple, but rigorous in its nature, and what he knew he connected with principles firmly established.</p><p>In the year 1776 he published, in two volumes quarto, his work entitled “ Opuscoli di Fisica Animale e Vegetabile,” containing the explanation of part of the microscopic observations which were previously given to the world. It must be admitted, that the art of accurate observation is one of the most difficult, and it cannot be denied, that it is at the same time the most necessary, and requires a rare combination of talents. These were possessed by Spallanzani in a remarkable degree, as is fully evinced by the researches which his admirable writings have re corded. The polite manner in which he conducted his dispute with Needham respecting the phenomena of gene ration, secured for him a high degree of applause. On this occasion, he treated of the influence of cold upon animals, and proved that the torpidity of some during winter, does not depend on the impression which the blood may receive from it, since a frog deprived of blood becomes torpid when reduced to the same cold state, by being immersed in ice,</p></body></text></TEI>
