The main principle applicable to this head is, that a passion may generally be destroyed most easily, not by the excitement of another which may be considered as its opposite, but by that of passions which do not lie so far distant from it. Anger towards a person, for example, may be removed, not only by exciting good-will towards him, but by holding him up as a proper object of fear. “ Compassion, likewise, may be counteracted either by disapprobation, by jealousy, by fear, or by disgust ; and horror and envy either by good-will or by contempt.” Aristotle, in his minute analysis of the passions most usually appealed to in oratory, which is well worthy of being deeply studied, has several very valuable observations on this head ; as Whately and Campbell have on the whole subject of impassioned eloquence : and Cicero and Quinctilian are much more useful here than they are in relation to the philosophy of arguments.</p><p>Our general plan of the Systematic portion of Rhetoric now presents to us its Second Division, which treats of what the ancients called Disposition, or the Arrangement of the several Parts of a Discourse. This department of the inquiry, a favourite one with the classical rhetoricians, especially those of the later ages, has, in modern systems of the art, seldom received a place as a distinct branch, and has, indeed, been generally overlooked altogether ; but the consideration of it suggests illustrations of the laws of eloquence, which claim for it some attention at least, although we shall not be tempted to dwell long upon it.</p><p>In reference to the animation of a discourse, and to every appeal which it makes to any principles of the mind besides the reasoning powers, Cicero has well said, that an eloquent composition should be constructed on the principle of the climax, rising gradually in its demands on the fancy and feelings of those to whom it is addressed, in the same ratio in which it has succeeded in opening the way for their rational conviction. This rule is in truth a very simple application of the fundamental proposition of rhetoric ; and all special directions regarding arrangement will, so far as they are sound, be immediately deducible from it. Aristotle, desirous, as he always is, to expel the prevailing errors of his time, by maintaining the due prevalence of the argumentative element of eloquence, observes that, in despite of that complication of divisions which already reigned in the schools, the essential parts common to all argumentative compositions are two only ; the proposition or statement of the question, and the proof or argument in support of it. And this is quite true ; for every other portion is introduced solely for the sake of these two, and has no value, unless in so far as it promotes their purpose. In most cases, however, an argument cannot with advantage be maintained thus barely ; but a complete discourse may always be with little difficulty analysed by a division into four parts ; the Exordium or Introduction, the Proposition or Statement of the Question, the Proof or Argument, and the Peroration.</p><p>The Exordium, when it finds a place, is designed for conciliating the minds of the persons addressed ; and Quinctilian reduces to three the dispositions which it should aim at producing—Good-will, Attention, and Docility. The materials of the introduction should be drawn as closely as possible from the subject of the discourse, and as little as possible from common-places ; and it therefore follows, that the ancient oratorical practice of keeping a stock of exordia prepared beforehand, which Cicero generally followed, and which Demosthenes has exemplified by a collection of more than fifty specimens, one or two of them introduced in his extant harangues, was unsatisfactory and dangerous even for public speakers, unless used with great judgment, and was quite preposterous in the case of all other writers. Both for the writer and the speaker, but more especially for the latter, the chief difficulty is, the passing naturally and safely from the theme suggested in the introduction, to that which is to be propounded in the next part of the composition.</p><p>If we say that the Proposition requires little illustration and few precepts, we shall find that Aristotle is with us,<hi rend="sup"> </hi>Quinctilian neutral, and the later rhetoricians, both Greek and Latin, decidedly against us. Even if we professed to deliver a complete system, we should not be easily induced to try the student’s patience, by following Severianus, or the pseudo-Augustin, far through the mazes of the<hi rend="italic">Status Quæstionis;</hi>  but the principles which should guide us in laying down our proposition, and in choosing it when that is in our power, are far too little studied (if gross violation of the principle be a proof that it has not been studied or understood) by many argumentative writers, and by a still greater number of argumentative speakers. Preachers are in this respect decidedly the most faulty class ; and orators of other kinds are protected against the error less by their own familiarity with the principles than by their liability to those checks by contradiction which the preacher wants. The most important rule, and one which is but too often broken, is to frame in our own minds a clear notion of the proposition, which involves among other contained rules that of ascertaining, that what we are about to argue is truly a proposition, and not a mere term. “ In an ethical work,” says Whately, “ one may be treating of virtue, while discussing all or any of these questions—w herein virtue consists ? whence our notions of it arise ? whence it derives its obligation ? &amp;c.; but if these questions were confusedly blended together, or if all of them were treated of within a short compass, the most just remarks and forcible arguments would lose their interest and their utility.”</p><p>Of the Argumentative, or third portion of the composition, which has been already discussed at such length, little seems necessary to be added. It must, of course, include the Refutation of an opponent’s argument, as well as the statement of those by which our own proposition is directly supported. The proper places for such refutative arguments, and the best arrangement of arguments in general, in cases where the rules draw n from the kind of the argument do not apply, have given rise to much discussion, and to many contradictory rules, from which it is not easy to extract general laws, or any very positive inference beyond the advice, to study the aspect of the evidence, and the disposition of those who are to judge of it. The rule most commonly received, which directs that the strongest arguments be placed first and last, and the weakest in the middle, is subject to constantly recurring exceptions, of which we only cite one from Quinctilian, namely, the case where a harangue preceding ours has created in the minds of the hearers on certain points an impression strongly unfavourable to us, which we must at all hazards endeavour immediately to remove. Under this head, in respect both of their nature and their place, fall most of those passages occasionally introduced in argumentative composition, which, under the names of Narration, Digression, and the like, rhetoricians have often classed separately as integral parts of a discourse ; and here also there frequently occur fitting occasions for the introduction of appeals to the feelings.</p><p>But the Conclusion or Peroration is the place for pressing such appeals to the utmost, to which office it adds that of bringing together into one view, by a Recapitulation, when one is thought necessary, the heads of the argument, or at least the results to which the speaker wishes it to be believed that they conduct. The Recapitulation is, for those who are maintaining a weak cause, a favourite and advantageous place for varnishing over the defects of the proof,—by assumptions of things as proved which have not been proved,— by exaggeration of the favourable points in our own cause,—</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
