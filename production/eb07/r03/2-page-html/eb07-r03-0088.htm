Every year the merchants of Tobolsk, Tumene, and&nbsp;the other towns, send boats laden with flour up the Irtysh&nbsp;and the Obe to Berezoff, and the other small towns situated&nbsp;farther to the north ; and these boats return freighted with&nbsp;fish. The clerks and agents belonging to these merchants,&nbsp;and who are established in the small towns upon the banks&nbsp;of the Obe, purchase of the Ostiaks valuable furs, which, together with soap, tallow, and leather, they afterwards export,&nbsp;partly to the fair of Niznei-Novgorod, and partly to the Kirg-hises of the steppes, who pay them in horses, cattle, and&nbsp;cotton stuffs, purchased by themselves of the Bukharians ;&nbsp;the remaining produce of the government of Tobolsk is&nbsp;exported by the way of Kiakhta into China, whence are&nbsp;brought in exchange silks and tea. Kiakhta is the solitary&nbsp;point of commercial intercourse between the two great empires of Russia and China. Almost all the principal houses&nbsp;in Russia have an agent at Kiakhta; while the Chinese&nbsp;traffickers consist chiefly of temporary visiters without their&nbsp;families. The Russians here receive the staples of China,&nbsp;for which they give the productions of their own country&nbsp;in return. The nature and extent of the commerce of</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In 1825 the total exports amounted to 5,501,815 roubles, or L.239,697, so that in ten years there has been an increase in the commercial intercourse between Russia and&nbsp;China to the extent of nearly two millions roubles. The&nbsp;Russians chiefly transport by water the merchandise which&nbsp;they send in summer, or oftener in spring, from Kiakhta to&nbsp;Europe. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another great commercial line is that which branches from Irkutsk down the Lena, into the heart of the frozen&nbsp;regions and the shores of the Arctic Ocean. Yakoutsk, situated about eight hundred miles down the Lena, is the emporium where the furs and other products of these desolate&nbsp;regions are collected. They are brought from the remotest&nbsp;extremities of the land which borders Behring’s Straits,&nbsp;from Kamtschatka, and from the American territory, as&nbsp;well as from the northern wastes. A considerable proportion consists of the tribute which is paid to government ;&nbsp;and the wandering traffickers exchange tobacco, spirits, cutlery, beads, and toys, for the remainder.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">There can be little doubt that in this census, which has been recently taken, the wandering tribes have been merely estimated, and that it is only an approximation to the&nbsp;truth. The population consists of two very distinct portions, the foreign rulers and the native tribes. The Russian inhabitants consist chiefly of the unfortunate persons&nbsp;who have been banished to these remote regions for various crimes, more especially those of a political nature.&nbsp;A basis was formed by the Swedish officers who fell into&nbsp;the hands of Peter the Great on “ sad Pultawa’s day,” and&nbsp;a regular succession of recruits has subsequently been furnished by the empire itself. Amongst those who have been&nbsp;thus expatriated by a jealous and absolute government, were&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">course many individuals belonging to the higher ranks of&nbsp;society, men of polished manners and accomplished minds,&nbsp;so that at Tobolsk, where they were chiefly stationed, there&nbsp;is a far higher degree of refinement and intelligence to be&nbsp;found than might have been expected in a settlement of&nbsp;convicts. This great capital of Western Siberia has to a considerable extent acquired the polish of a European city. In&nbsp;1835 it contained 15,379 inhabitants, two ecclesiastical&nbsp;schools, about twenty churches, and a monastery. The lowest class of exiles are condemned to the mines, where, being&nbsp;closely watched, and with hard work and harder fare, they&nbsp;drag out a miserable existence. A class whose offences are&nbsp;of a milder character are distributed amongst the distilleries.&nbsp;A third class receive grants of land, for which a trifle is&nbsp;paid to government. The individuals composing this class&nbsp;are formed into villages, under the superintendence of a&nbsp;strict police. The native races have been enumerated in&nbsp;our general statement of the various tribes who inhabit the&nbsp;Russian empire. Siberia is under the same system of national education as European Russia, and has its schools,&nbsp;gymnasia, and other institutions of the kind. Public instruction is making some progress at Tobolsk, notwithstanding the many obvious difficulties which obstruct it. There&nbsp;are in this government eleven ecclesiastical schools, with&nbsp;thirty-four masters, and 686 pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transcaucasian Provinces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Transcaucasian territory of Russia is a vast tract of country situated between the Black and Caspian Seas, and&nbsp;bounded by Turkey and Persia on the south. It has been&nbsp;entirely incorporated with the empire since the commencement of this century. Relations had been established with&nbsp;Georgia a long time previously, but it was not till 1801&nbsp;that it was declared a Russian province. The district of&nbsp;Elizabethpol was seized in 1803; Imeretia in 1805; Persia ceded the Khanats of Sheki, Shirvan, Karabagh, Talish,&nbsp;Bacoo, Cooba, and Derbend, in 1813; the treaty of Turk-manschay, concluded with Persia in 1828, gave to Russia&nbsp;the Armenian provinces of Erivan, Nanhischevan, and Or-dubat, and fixed as its frontier the course of the Araxes;&nbsp;and, lastly, by the treaty of Adrianople Turkey surrendered</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
