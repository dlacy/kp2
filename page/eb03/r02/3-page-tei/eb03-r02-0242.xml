It is perhaps the eſſential part of a houſe, and is frequently uſed to expreſs the whole. To <hi rend="italic">come under a perſon’'s roof,</hi>  is to enjoy his protection and ſociety, to dwell with him. <hi rend="italic">Tectum</hi>  was uſed in the ſame ſenſe by the Romans. To be within our walls rather expreſſes the being in our poſſeſſion : a roof therefore is not only an eſſential part of a houſe, but it even ſeems to be its characteriſtic feature. The Greeks, who have perhaps excelled all nations in taſte, and who have given the moſt perfect model of architectonic ordonnance within a certain limit, never erected a building which did not exhibit this part in the diſtincteſt manner ; and though they borrowed much of their model from the orientals, as will be evident to any who compares their architecture with the ruins of Perſepolis, and of the tombs in the mountains of Sciras, they added that form of roof which their own climate taught them was neceſſary for ſheltering them from the rains. The roofs in Perſia and Arabia are flat, but thoſe of Greece are without exception doping. It ſeems therefore a groſs violation of the true principles of taſte in architecture (at leaſt in the regions of Europe), to take away or to hide the roof of a houſe ; and it muſt be aſeribed to that rage for novelty which is ſo powerful in the minds of the rich. Our anceſtors ſeemed to be of a very different opinion, and turned their attention to the ornamenting of their roofs as much as any other part of a building. They ſhowed them in the moſt conſpicuous manner, running them up to a great height, broke them into a thouſand fanciful ſhapes, and ſtuck them full of highly dreſſed windows. We laugh at this, and call it Gothic and clumſy ; and our great architects, not to offend any more in this way, conceal the roof altogether by parapets, baluſtrades, and other contrivances. Our forefathers certainly did offend againſt the maxims of true taſte, when they enriched a part of a houſe with marks of elegant habitation, which every ſpectator muſt know to be a cumberſome garret : but their ſucceſſors no leſs offend, who take off the cover of the houſe altogether, and make it impoſſible to know whether it is not a mere ikreen or colonnade we are looking at.</p><p>We cannot help thinking that Sir Chriſtopher Wren erred when he ſo induſtriouily concealed the roof of St Paul’s church in London. The whole of the upper order is a mere ſcreen. Such a quantity of wall would have been intolerably offenſive, had he not given it ſome appearance of habitation by the mock windows or niches. Even in this ſtate it is gloomy, and it is odd, and is a puzzle to every ſpectator—There ſhould be nd puzzle in the deſign of a building any more than in a diſcourſe. It has been ſaid that the double roof of our great churches which have aiſles is an incongruity, looking like a houſe ſtanding on the top of another houſe. But there is not the leaſt occaſion for ſuch a thought. We know that the aiſle is a ſhed, a cloiſter. Suppoſe only that the lower roof or ſhed is hidden by .a baluſtrade, it then becomes a portico, againſt which the cennoiſſeur has no objection : yet there is no difference ; ſor the portico muſt have a cover, otherwiſe it is neither a ſhed, cloiſter, nor portico, any more than a building without a roof is a houſe. A houſe without a viſible roof is like a mah abroad without his hat ; and we may add, that the whim of concealing the chimneys, now ſo faſhionable, changes a houſe to a barn or ſtore-houſe. A houſe ſhould not be a copy of any thing. It has a title to be an original ; and a ſcreen like houſe and a pillar-like candleſtick are ſimilar ſoleciſms in taſte.</p><p>The architect is anxious to preſent a fine object, and a very ſimple outline diſcuſſes all his concerns with the roof. He leaves it to the carpenter, whom he frequently puzzles (by his arrangements) with coverings almoſt impoſſible to execute. Indeed it is ſeldom that the idea of a roof is admitted by him into his great compoſitions; or if he does introduce it, it is from mere affectation, and we may ſay pedantry. A pediment is frequently ſtuck up in the middle of a grand front, in a ſituation where a roof cannot perform its office ; for the rain that is ſuppoſed to flow down its ſides muſt be received on the top of the level buildings which flank it. This is a manifeſt incongruity. The tops of dreſſed windows, trifling porches, and ſometimes a projecting portico, are the only ſituations in which we ſee the figure of a roof correſpond with its office. Having thus loſt ſight of the principle, it is not ſurpriſing that the draughtſman (for he ſhould not be called architect) runs into every whim : and we ſee pediment within pediment, a round pediment, a hollow pediment, and the greateſt of all abſurdities, a broken pediment. Nothing could ever reconcile us to the ſight of a man with a hat without its crown, becauſe we cannot overlook the uſe of a hat.</p><p>But when one builds a houſe, ornament alone will not do. We muſt have a cover ; and the enormous ex-pence and other great inconveniences which attend the concealment of this cover by parapets, baluſtrades, and ſcreens, have obliged architects to conſider the pent roof as admiſſible, and to regulate its form. Any man of ſenſe, not under the influence of prejudice, would be determined in this by its ſitneſs for anſwering its purpoſe. A high pitched roof will undoubtedly ſhoot off the rains and ſnows better than one of a lower pitch. The wind will not ſo eaſily blow the dropping rain in between the ſlates, nor will it have ſo much power to ſtrip them off. A high pitched roof will exert a ſmaller thruſt on the walls, both becauſe its ſtrain is leſs horizontal, and becauſe it will admit of lighter covering. But it is more expenſive, becauſe there is more of it. It requires a greater ſize of timbers to make it equally ſtrong, and it expoſes a greater ſurface to the wind.</p><p>There have been great changes in the pitch of roofs : our forefathers made them very high, and we make them very low. It does not, however, appear, that this change has been altogether the effect of principle. In the ſimple unadorned habitations of private perſons, every thing conies to be adjuſted by an experience of inconveniences which have reſulted from too low pitched rcofs ; and their pitch will always be nearly ſuch as ſuits the climate änd covering. Our architects, however, go to work oh different principles. Their pro-feſſed aim is to make a beautiful object. The ſources of the pleaſures ariſing from what we call <hi rend="italic">tafle</hi>  are ſo various, ſo complicated, and even ſo whimſical, that it</p></body></text></TEI>
