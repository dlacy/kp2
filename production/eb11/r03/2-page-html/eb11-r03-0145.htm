<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">together with an Extract of the History of that Kingdom. By a person of note who resided many years there</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1695).&nbsp;This was translated into French (Amsterdam, 1712), and in&nbsp;1738 was published with Viscount Molesworth<sup>i</sup>S </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Account of&nbsp;Denmark in 1692.</span><span class="font1"> Some of his letters are among the Strafford&nbsp;papers in the British Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A member of the same family was Sir Frederick Philipsc Robinson (1763-1852), a Virginian soldier, who fought for&nbsp;England during the American War of Independence. On the&nbsp;conclusion of peace he went to England, and in 1813 and 1814&nbsp;he commanded a brigade under Wellington in Spain. Afterwards he was governor of Tobago, and he became a general in&nbsp;1841. He died at Brighton on the ist of January 1852.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBINSON, JOHN (1575-1625), English Nonconformist divine, was born probably in Lincolnshire or Nottinghamshire about T575- He seems to have Studietl at Cambridge,&nbsp;and to have been influenced by William Perkins. He took&nbsp;orders and held a curacy in Norwich, but was attracted by&nbsp;Puritan doctrines, and finally associated himself with a Congregation meeting at Gainsborough (where the “ John Robinson&nbsp;Memorial Church ” bears witness to his work). In 1606 the&nbsp;members divided into two societies, Robinson becoming&nbsp;minister of the one which made its headquarters at Scrooby,&nbsp;a neighbouring village. The increasing hostility of the authorities towards nonconformity soon forced him and his people&nbsp;to think of flight, and, not without difficulty, they succeeded&nbsp;in making their escape in detachments to Holland. Robinson&nbsp;settled in Amsterdam in 1608, but in the following year removed, with a large contingent, to Leiden, where he ministered&nbsp;to a community whose numbers gradually grew from one&nbsp;hundred to three hundred. In 1620 a considerable minority&nbsp;of these sailed for England in the “ SpeedwellZ<sup>i</sup> and ultimately&nbsp;crossed the Atlantic in the “ Mayflower”; it was Robinson’s&nbsp;intention to follow as soon as practicable, along with the rest&nbsp;of his flock, but he died before the plan could be carried out, on&nbsp;the ist of March 1625.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the early stages of the Arminian controversy he took the Calvinistic side, and even engaged in a public disputation&nbsp;with the famous Episcopius. He bore a high reputation even&nbsp;among his ecclesiastical opponents, and one of them (Robert&nbsp;Baillie) calls him “ the most learned, polished and modest&nbsp;spirit that ever that sect enjoyed.” He was large-minded&nbsp;and eminently reasonable in spirit, recognizing parish assemblies where “ the pure word and discipline jj prevailed&nbsp;as true churches of God. His sound judgment is seen in the&nbsp;way in which he adjusted the relations of elders and church—&nbsp;the&quot;most delicate practical problem of Congregationalism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Amongst his publications may be mentioned </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Justification of Separation from the Church</span><span class="font1"> (1610), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apologia Brownisiarum</span><span class="font1"> (1619),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Defence of the Doctrine propounded by the Synod of Dort</span><span class="font1"> (1624),&nbsp;and a volume of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essays, or Observations Dhine and Moral,</span><span class="font1"> printed&nbsp;in 1625. His Works (with one exception, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Manumission to a&nbsp;Manduction,</span><span class="font1"> since published by the Massachusetts Historical&nbsp;Society, ser. iv., vof. i.), including a memoir, were reprinted by&nbsp;R. Ashton in three vols, in 1851. A summary of their contents&nbsp;is given in G. Punchard<sub>1</sub> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Congregationalism</span><span class="font1"> (New York,&nbsp;1867), iii. 300-344.. See further </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Congregationalism,</span><span class="font1"> and the&nbsp;literature there cited; also O. S. Davis, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">John Robinson</span><span class="font1"> (Hartford,&nbsp;Connecticut, 1897).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROBINSON, SIR JOHN BEVERLEY, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bart.</span><span class="font1"> (1791-1863), Canadian statesman and jurist, was the son of Christopher&nbsp;Robinson (1764-1798), one of the band known as United&nbsp;Empire Loyalists, who came to Canada at the conclusion of&nbsp;the American Revolution. Hc was born at Berthier, Quebec,&nbsp;on the 26th of July 1791, and studied under Dr John&nbsp;Strachan, by whom his religious and political ideas were much&nbsp;influenced. He served with distinction at the beginning of&nbsp;the war of 1812, and later in the war was appointed acting&nbsp;attorney-general of Upper Canada. In 1815 he visited England&nbsp;and read law at Lincoln’s Inn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From 1818 till 1829 he was the head of the Tory party in Upper Canada (the so-called “Family Compact”). In 1829&nbsp;he became chief justice of Upper Canada, which position he&nbsp;held till shortly before his death on the 31st of January 1863.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not one of his decisions was ever reversed on appeal. In 1824 and again in 1839 he strongly advocated a federal union&nbsp;of British North America, and in 1839 opposed in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Canada and&nbsp;the Canada Bill</span><span class="font1"> the legislative union of the two Canadas proposed by Lord Durham. In 1854 he was created a baronet&nbsp;of the United Kingdom and in 1855 a D.C.L. of Oxford University. His unbending Toryism rendered him a reactionary&nbsp;in politics, but his bitterest opponents admitted his sincerity&nbsp;and patriotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Several of his sons rose to eminence, John Bcverley Robinson (1820-1896) becoming a member of the Dominion parliament&nbsp;and lieutenant-governor of Ontario (1880-1887). Christopher&nbsp;Robinson (1828-1905) was for many years the acknowledged&nbsp;leader of the Canadian Bar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font1"> by his son, Major-General C. W. Robinson, C.B. (Toronto and London, 1904), gives a very favourable picture of the fine old&nbsp;colonial gentleman and loyalist. For a less favourable view see&nbsp;J. C. Dent, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Canadian Portrait Gallery,</span><span class="font1"> vol. iv. (Toronto, 1881).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBINSON, JOHN THOMAS ROMNEY (1792-1882), Irish astronomer and physicist, was born in Dublin on the 23rd of&nbsp;April 1792. He studied at Trinity College, Dublin, and obtained a fellowship in 1814; for some years he was deputy&nbsp;professor of natural philosophy, until in 1821 he obtained the&nbsp;college living of Enniskillen. In 1823 he was appointed astronomer of the Armagh observatory, with which he (from 1824)&nbsp;combined the living of Carrickmacross, but he always resided&nbsp;at the observatory, engaged in researches connected with&nbsp;astronomy and physics, until his death on the 28th of February&nbsp;1882.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Robinson published a number of papers in scientific journals, and the Armagh catalogue of stars </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Places of 534$ Stars Observedfrom&nbsp;1828 to 18$4 at the Armagh Observatory,</span><span class="font1"> Dublin, 1859), but he is&nbsp;best known as the inventor (1846) of the cup-anemometer for&nbsp;registering the velocity of the wind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROBINSON, SIR JOSEPH BENJAMIN (1845- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), South</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">African mine-owner, was born at Cradock, Cape Colony, in 1845. At the age of sixteen he started business as a general&nbsp;trader, wool-buyer and stock-breeder, but on the discovery of&nbsp;diamonds in South Africa in 1867 he hastened to the Vaal&nbsp;river district, where, by purchasing the stones from the natives&nbsp;and afterwards by buying diamond-bearing land, notably&nbsp;at Kimberley, he soon acquired a considerable fortune. He&nbsp;was mayor of Kimberley in 1880, and for four years was a&nbsp;representative of Griqualand West in the Capc parliament.&nbsp;On the discovery of gold in the Witwatersrand district in 1886,&nbsp;Robinson purchased the Langlaagte and Randfontein estates.&nbsp;His views as to the westerly trend of the main gold-bcaring reef&nbsp;were entirely contrary to the bulk of South African opinion&nbsp;at the time, but events proved him to be correct, and the&nbsp;enormous appreciation in value of his various properties made&nbsp;him one of the richest men in South Africa. As a Rand capitalist he stood aloof from combinations with other gold-mining&nbsp;interests, and took no part in the Johannesburg reform movement, maintaining friendly relations with President Kruger.&nbsp;He claimed that it was as the result of his representations after&nbsp;the Jameson Raid that Kruger appointed the Industrial Commission of 1897, whose recommendations—had they been&nbsp;carried out—would have remedied some of the Uitlander&nbsp;grievances. In 1908 he was created a baronet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROBINSON, MARY </span><span class="font1">[“ Pcrdita ”] &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1758-1800), English</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">actress and author, was born in Bristol on the 27th of November 1758, the daughter of a captain of a whaler named Darby.&nbsp;In 1774 she was married to Thomas Robinson, a clerk in London,&nbsp;where her remarkable beauty brought her many attentions;&nbsp;and when, after two years of fashionable life, her husband was&nbsp;arrested for debt, she shared his imprisonment. She had been&nbsp;a precocious child, encouraged to write verses, and while in&nbsp;King’s Bench prison she completed the collection published&nbsp;in two volumes in 1775. On her release, thanks to Garrick,&nbsp;she secured an engagement at Drury Lane, making a successful&nbsp;first appearance as Juliet in 1776. On the 3rd of December&nbsp;1779 she was Pcrdita in Garrick’s version of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Winter's Tale,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and her beauty so captivated George, prince of Wales (afterwards</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
