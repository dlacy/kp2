<p><span class="font2">The temple of Faustina the elder stands at the east angle of the Forum, facing the later line of the Sacra Via. It is prostyle hexa-style, and has monolithic columns of cipollino and. a rich&nbsp;entablature of Greek marble, with graceful reliefs of&nbsp;griffins and candelabra on the frieze.<sup>@@2 </sup>The walls are of&nbsp;massive peperino, once lined with marble.

In the Middle Ages it&nbsp;was consecrated as the church of S. Lorenzo in Miranda, and a great&nbsp;part of its cella has been destroyed. The front is now excavated to&nbsp;the original level.

The&nbsp;existing remains<sup>@@3</sup> are of the rebuilding by Tiberius, and show that&nbsp;it was unusual in plan, having a large cella much wider than its&nbsp;depth, and a very large projecting portico. Its construction is an&nbsp;interesting example of the Roman use of many different materials.&nbsp;The lower part of the walls was of massive tufa blocks, the upper&nbsp;part of the cella of travertine; and the inner low wall, which supported ranges of internal columns, was of mixed concrete, tufa and&nbsp;travertine. The whole was lined with marble, white outside, and&nbsp;rich oriental marbles inside (see fig. 4), which were also used for the&nbsp;pavement. The door-sill is made of enormous blocks of porta&nbsp;santa marble, in which </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font2">bronze caduceus (emblem of Mercury) was&nbsp;inlaid. Between the internal columns of the cella stood rows of&nbsp;statues; and the temple also contained a large collection of pictures,&nbsp;engraved gems, gold and silver plate, and other works of art, mostly&nbsp;the work of ancient Greek artists (see Plin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.N,</span><span class="font2"> xxxiv. 19,&nbsp;xxxv. 36, 40, xxxvi. 67, xxxvii. 2).

<p><span class="font2">The temple of Vespasian stands close by that of Concord, abutting on the Taoularium in a similar way, and blocking up a doorway&nbsp;at the foot of a long flight of steps (see fig. 1). It consists&nbsp;of a nearly square cella with prostyle hexastyle portico of&nbsp;the Corinthian order; three of the columns are still&nbsp;standing, with their rich entablature, the frieze of which is&nbsp;sculptured with sacred instruments. The walls are of enormous&nbsp;blocks of travertine with strong iron clamps; the whole was lined&nbsp;with white Pentelic marble outside, and inside with coloured&nbsp;oriental marbles. There was an internal range of columns, as in&nbsp;the temple of Concord. This temple was begun by Titus in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 80,&nbsp;in honour of his father Vespasian, and finished by Domitian, who&nbsp;dedicated it to Vespasian and Titus. The inscription on the&nbsp;entablature, given in the Einsiedeln MS., records a restoration by&nbsp;Severusand Caracalla—</span><span class="font1">DI VO. VESPASIANO. AVGVSTO.S.P.Q.R.&nbsp;1MPP. CAESS. SEVERVS.ET.ANTONINVS. PII. FELIC. AVGG.&nbsp;RESTITVERVNT; </span><span class="font2">part of the last word only now exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the narrow space between the temples of Concord and, Vespasian (only about 7 ft. in width) a small brick and concrete edifice stands&nbsp;against the Tabularium. In it was found an inscribed base dedicated&nbsp;to Faustina the younger by one of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">viatores</span><span class="font2"> (messengers) of the&nbsp;quaestors, who probably had their office here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The next building is the Porticus Deorum Consentium, a colonnade in two wings which join at ,the obtuse angle, with a row of small&nbsp;rooms or shrines partly cut into the tufa rock of the hill&nbsp;behind. This conjunction of twelve deities was of&nbsp;Etruscan origin; they were six of each sex and were&nbsp;called Senatus Deorum (Varro, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L.L.</span><span class="font2"> viii. 70, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De Re&nbsp;Rust,</span><span class="font2"> i. 1).<sup>@@5</sup> The columns are of cipollino with Corinthian&nbsp;caps; on the frieze is an inscription recording a restoration by&nbsp;Vettius Agorius Praetextatus, praefect of the city in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 367.&nbsp;Under the marble platform is a row of seven small rooms, the brick&nbsp;facing of which is perhaps of the Flavian period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The arch of Severus stands by the rostra, across the road on the north-east side of the Forum; the remains of the ancient travertine&nbsp;curb show, that originally the road went along a rather&nbsp;different line, and was probably altered to make room&nbsp;for this great arch, which was accessible only by steps,&nbsp;and was not used for ordinary traffic. It was built in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 203,&nbsp;after victories in Parthia, and was originally set up in honour of&nbsp;Severus and his two sons M. Aurelius Antoninus (Caracalla) and&nbsp;Geta. Caracalla, after murdering Geta, erased his name from all&nbsp;monuments to his honour in Rome. Representations of the arch&nbsp;on coins of Severus show that its attic was surmounted by a chariot&nbsp;of bronze drawn by six horses, in which stood Severus crowned by&nbsp;Victory; at the sides were statues of Caracalla and Geta, with an&nbsp;equestrian statue at each angle. The arch, except the base, which&nbsp;is of marble-lined travertine, is built of massive blocks of Pentelic&nbsp;marble, and has large crowded reliefs of victories in the East, showing&nbsp;much decadence from the best period of Roman art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The central space of the Forum is paved with slabs of travertine, much patched at various dates; it appears to have been marked&nbsp;out into compartments with incised lines (see Plate VIII.),&nbsp;the use of which is not known. There are also square&nbsp;holes which probably held masts on which awnings could&nbsp;be spread. Numerous clamp-holes all over the paving&nbsp;show where statues and other ornaments once stood. The recorded&nbsp;number of these is very great, and they must once have thickly&nbsp;crowded a great part of the central area. Two short marble walls&nbsp;or plutei covered with reliefs, discovered in 1872, stand on the north&nbsp;side. The rough travertine plinth on which they have been set is&nbsp;evidently of late date. Each of these marble screens has (on the&nbsp;inside) reliefs of a fat bull, boar and ram, decked out with sacrificial&nbsp;wreaths and vittae—the suovetaurilia. On the outside are scenes&nbsp;in the life of Trajan: in both cases the emperor is speaking from the&nbsp;rostra.. On one we also see him seated on a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">suggestus</span><span class="font2"> instituting&nbsp;a charity for destitute children in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d. ioi</span><span class="font2">—a scene similar to one&nbsp;shown in one of his first brasses with the legend </span><span class="font1">ALIM[ENTA]&nbsp;ITALIAE;<sup>@@6</sup> </span><span class="font2">at the other end the emperor stands on the rostra, on&nbsp;which the two tiers of beaks are shown; he is addressing a crowd&nbsp;of citizens. In the background is shown the long line of arches of&nbsp;the Basilica Julia, with (on the left) what is probably the temple&nbsp;of Castor and the arch of Augustus. On the right are the statue of&nbsp;Marsyas and the sacred fig-tree.<sup>@@7 </sup>On the other slab a crowd of&nbsp;officials are bringing tablets and piling them in a heap to be burnt.&nbsp;This records the remission by Trajan of some arrears of debt due&nbsp;to the imperial treasury (Auson. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grat.

<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@3 </sup>The size of the earlier and smaller temple is indicated by the rough blocks on the face of the wall of the Tabularium, close against&nbsp;which the temple stands.

<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@4 </sup>Little is known of the Basilica Opimia, which probably adjoined the earlier temple of Concord, and the existing building appears&nbsp;also to have occupied the, site of the Senaculum (see Festus, ed.&nbsp;Muller, p. 347).
