an unnatural crime, ſo called from the city of Sodom, which was deſtroyed by fire for the ſame. The Levitical law adjudged thoſe guilty of this execrable crime to death ; and the civil law aſſigns the same puniſhment to it. The law of England makes it felony. There is no ſtatute in Scotland againſt Sodomy ; the libel of the crime is therefore founded on the divine law, and practice makes its puniſhment to be burned alive.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
