<p><span class="font2">High German, but this work is of slight importance in comparison with the series of stories which he had already&nbsp;begun, and by which he was to establish his fame as one&nbsp;of the foremost writers of his age. To this series he gave&nbsp;the general title </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Olle Kamellen.</span><span class="font2"> The first volume, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Zwei&nbsp;Lustige Geschichte,</span><span class="font2"> published in 1860, contained </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Woans&nbsp;ik tau <sup>,</sup>ηe Fru kamm</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ut de Franzosentid. Ut mine&nbsp;Festungstid</span><span class="font2"> (1861) formed the second volume ; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ut Mine&nbsp;Stromtid</span><span class="font2"> (1864) the third, fourth, and fifth volumes; and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">D'orchlauchting</span><span class="font2"> (1866) the sixth volume. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Woans ik tau&nbsp;<sup>,</sup>ne Fru kamm</span><span class="font2"> is a bright little tale, in which Reuter&nbsp;tells, in a half serious half bantering tone, how he wooed&nbsp;the lady who became his wife. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ut de Franzosentid&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">he undertook a more difficult task, which enabled him&nbsp;for the first time to do full justice to his genius. The&nbsp;scene is laid in and near Stavenhagen (Platt Deutsch,&nbsp;Stemhagen) in the year 1813, and the principal complications spring from the disappearance of a Frenchman,&nbsp;which gives rise to suspicions of foul play. In this&nbsp;powerful tale the characters are depicted by means of a&nbsp;few bold and rapid strokes, and our interest in them is&nbsp;heightened by the fact that their personal fortunes are&nbsp;associated with the great events which at the beginning of&nbsp;the 19th century stirred the heart of Germany to its&nbsp;depths. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ut mine Festungstid</span><span class="font2"> is of less general interest&nbsp;than </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ut de Franzosentid,</span><span class="font2"> but it is not less vigorous either&nbsp;in conception or in style. It contains a narrative of&nbsp;Reuter’s hardships during the term of his imprisonment,&nbsp;and it awakens sympathy all the more effectually because&nbsp;it is brightened by many a gleam of kindly and humorous&nbsp;feeling. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ut mine Stromtid</span><span class="font2"> is by far the greatest of&nbsp;Reuter’s writings, and ranks with the most famous masterpieces of modern fiction. He records few incidents which&nbsp;might not happen in the lives of ordinary men and&nbsp;women, yet he never loses his hold over the imagination&nbsp;of his readers, so full of vitality are the characters of his&nbsp;story, and so deep is his insight into the enduring facts of&nbsp;human nature. The most original character in the book&nbsp;is Bräsig, an eccentric old bachelor, fond of gossip and&nbsp;apt to interfere too much in the affairs of his neighbours,&nbsp;but humorous, loyal to the core, and coming out most&nbsp;brightly when his good qualities are put to the severest&nbsp;test. There is a touch of romance, too, in this simple&nbsp;and genial nature, for he retains to the last his love for the&nbsp;woman who had fascinated him in his youth, and is&nbsp;always at hand to serve her when she needs his help.&nbsp;Another powerfully conceived character is Havermann, a&nbsp;man of solid and serious judgment, calm and undemonstrative, of sterling rectitude, and revealing at the great crises&nbsp;of life infinite depths of love and pity. Equally attractive&nbsp;in their own way are the good pastor and his wife, who&nbsp;bring up Havermann’s daughter, Louise, in their quiet&nbsp;parsonage ; and we come to know intimately every&nbsp;member of the pleasant household in which Havermann’s&nbsp;frank and comely sister (whom Bräsig secretly loves) is&nbsp;the central figure. In this great book Reuter displays&nbsp;imaginative power of the highest order in the expression&nbsp;of every mood and passion within the proper range of his&nbsp;art ; and he fails, or at least does not perfectly succeed,&nbsp;only when he deals with characters belonging to classes he&nbsp;had never had an opportunity of studying closely. As in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ut de Franzosentid</span><span class="font2"> he describes the deep national impulse in obedience to which Germany rose against Napoleon, so&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ut mine Stromtid</span><span class="font2"> he presents many aspects of the&nbsp;revolutionary movement of 1848. He shows little sympathy with some of the most characteristic aspirations of&nbsp;the period, but in many passages he indicates by slight&nbsp;but significant touches the strength of the forces which&nbsp;had begun to make for social as distinguished from merely&nbsp;political reorganization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1863 Reuter transferred his residence from Neubrandenburg to Eisenach; and here he died on the 12th June 1874. In the works produced at Eisenach he did&nbsp;not maintain the high level of his earlier writings.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Horchlauchting,</span><span class="font2"> although it contains some striking passages,&nbsp;lacks the freshness and spontaneity of the other tales of&nbsp;the series to which it belongs ; and admirers of his genius&nbsp;found little to interest them in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die Μontechi unfit Capuleti&nbsp;in Konstantinopel,</span><span class="font2"> which he wrote after a visit to the&nbsp;Turkish capital.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reuter is the most realistic of the great German writers. To the dreamers of the romantic school he has not the faintest resemblance, nor does he ever attempt to describe ideally perfect&nbsp;characters. The men and women of his stories are the men and&nbsp;women he knew in the villages and farmhouses of Mecklenburg,&nbsp;and the circumstances in which he places them are the circumstances by which they were surrounded in actual life. His fidelity&nbsp;to facts is as exact as that of the Dutch school of painters, and,&nbsp;like them, he thinks nothing too minute for his use, if by small&nbsp;details he can give variety and animation to his pictures. But he&nbsp;does not merely glide over the surface of life ; he penetrates to the&nbsp;inmost springs of feeling, and in simple peasant folk finds characteristics which in his hands become types of universal qualities.&nbsp;The sources of tears and the sources of laughter he touches with&nbsp;equal ease ; but, while his humour is sometimes rather extravagant, his pathetic passages are always marked by perfect truth&nbsp;and delicacy. His description of the death of the old pastor in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ut&nbsp;mine Stromtid</span><span class="font1"> is one of the gems of modern literature, and the&nbsp;scene in which Bräsig dies, holding the hand of the woman he&nbsp;has loved all his life, is in a different way not less impressive.&nbsp;Reuter’s only serious defect as an artist is that he fails to maintain the due proportion between the different parts of his stories.&nbsp;If an idea attracts him, he cannot resist the temptation to unfold&nbsp;its full significance, whether or not it is in organic relation with&nbsp;his scheme as a whole. To some extent, however, the reader is&nbsp;compensated for these interruptions by happy strokes of humour&nbsp;which would have been rendered impossible had Reuter forced&nbsp;himself to adopt a more rigid method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reuter’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Särnrntliche Werke</span><span class="font0"> in thirteen volumes (edited by Ad. w∏dbrandt) were published in 18C3-68. To these were added in 1875 two volumes of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nachgelassene Schriften,</span><span class="font0"> with a biography ; and in 1878 a comedy, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die drei Langhänse.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">See Glagau, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fritz Reuter und Seine Dichtungen,</span><span class="font0"> 1866 ; Ebert, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fritz Reuter,</span><span class="font0"> 1874 ;&nbsp;and Zeil, “ Fritz Reuter,” in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unsere Zeit,</span><span class="font0"> 1875.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J.

<p><span class="font2">REUTLINGEN, a manufacturing town of &quot;Wurtemberg, situated in a fertile and pretty district on the Echatz, an&nbsp;affluent of the Neckar, near the base of the Achalm,&nbsp;and 20 miles to the south of Stuttgart. It is a quaint&nbsp;but well-built town, with numerous picturesque houses&nbsp;and a fine Gothic church of the 13th and 14th centuries,&nbsp;overtopped by a lofty spire. The tanneries of Reutlingen&nbsp;are extensive, producing large quantities of leather ; and&nbsp;its other industrial products are very multifarious, including cotton, woollen, and knitted goods, lace, ribbons, hats,&nbsp;shoes, paper, machinery, hardware, and lime. To fruitgrowers Reutlingen is interesting as the seat of a celebrated&nbsp;pomological institute, while the Christian-socialist refuges&nbsp;of Pastor Werner are widely known in philanthropic&nbsp;circles. In 1880 the town contained 16,609 inhabitants,&nbsp;of whom 809 were Roman Catholics and 44 Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reutlingen was made a free imperial town by Frederick II. in 1240, and was unflinching in its loyalty to the emperors of his line.&nbsp;It successfully resisted a siege by Heinrich Raspe, the rival of&nbsp;Conrad IV., and in 1377 its citizens defeated Count Ulrich of&nbsp;Wiirtemberg at the Achalm. At a later period Reutlingen became&nbsp;a member of the Swabian League, and it was among the first&nbsp;Swabian towns to embrace the Reformation. It was annexed to&nbsp;Wiirtemberg in 1802.</span></p>

The city consists of two&nbsp;parts—the “ Domberg ” or “ Dom,” which occupies a hill,&nbsp;and the lower town on the beach—and is surrounded&nbsp;by pleasant suburban houses with gardens. The “ Dorn ”&nbsp;contains the castle, where the provincial administration&nbsp;has its seat, and the slopes of the hill are covered with&nbsp;the well-built houses of the German aristocracy. It has</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
