<p><label>RICE PAPER</label>
. The substance which has received this name in Europe, through the mistaken notion that it is made from rice, consists of the pith of a small tree <hi rend="italic">Arabia papyrifera</hi> cut into thin slices. The tree grows in the swampy forests of Formosa and apparently nowhere else, and large quantities of the stems are conveyed to Chin-chew, where the snow-white delicate pith is carefully sliced by spiral cuts into uniform sheets of a fine ivory-like texture. It is dyed various colours, and extensively used for the preparation of artificial flowers, while the white sheets are employed by native artists for water-colour drawings.</p>
