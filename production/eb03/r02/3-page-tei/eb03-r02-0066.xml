We muſt conclude that the ſurface of the Adriatic is by no means level, and that it ſlopes like a river from the Lagoons of Venice to the eaſtward. In all probability it even ſlopes conſiderably outwards from the ſhore. This will not hinder the alternations of ebb and flow tide, as will be ſhown in its proper place. The whole ſhores of this gulph exhibit moſt uncommon appearances.</p><p>The laſt general obſervations which we ſhall make in this place is, that the ſurface of a river is not flat, conſidered athwart the ſtream, but convex : this is owing to its motion. Suppoſe a canal of ſtagnant water ; its ſurface would be a perfect level. But ſuppoſe it poſſible by any means to give the middle waters a motion in the direction of its length, they muſt drag along with them the waters immediately contiguous. Theſe will move leſs ſwiftly, and will in like manner drag the waters without them ; and thus the water at the ſides being abſtracted, the depth muſt be leſs, and the general ſurface muſt be convex acroſs. The fact in a running ſtream is ſimilar to this ; the ſide waters are withheld by the ſides, and every filament is moving more ſlowly than the one next it towards the middle of the river, but falter than the adjoining filament on the land ſide. This alone muſt produce a convexity of ſurface. But beſides this, it is demonſtrable that the preſſure of a running ſtream is diminiſhed by its motion, and the diminution is proportional to the height which would produce the velocity with which it is gliding paſt the adjoining filament. This convexity muſt in all caſes be very ſmall. Few rivers have the .velocity nearly equal to eight feet <hi rend="italic">per</hi>  ſecond, and this requires a height of one foot only. An author quoted by Mr Buffon ſays, that he has obſerved on the river Aveiron an elevation of three feet in the middle during floods; but we ſuſpect ſome error in the obſervation.</p><p>§ 4. <hi rend="italic">Of the Windings of Rivers.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rivers are ſeldom ſtraight in their courſe. Formed by the hand of nature, they are accommodated to every change of circumſtance. They wind around what they cannot get over., and work their way to either ſide according as the reſiſtance of the oppoſite bank makes a ſtraight courſe more difficult ; and this ſeemingly fortuitous rambling diſtributes them more uniformly over the ſurface of a country, and makes them every where more at hand, to receive the numberleſs rills and rivulets which collect the waters of our ſprings and the ſuper-fluities of our ſhowers, and to comfort our habitations with the many advantages which cultivation and ſociety can derive ſrom their preſence. In their feeble beginnings the ſmalleſt inequality of ſlope or conſiſtency is enough to turn them aſide and make them ramble through every field, giving drink to our herds and fertility to our ſoil. The more we follow nature into.the minutiæ of her operations, the more muſt we admire the inexhauſtible fertility of her reſources, and the ſim-ρlicity of the means by which ſhe produces the moſt important and beneficial effects. By thus twiſting the courſe of our rivers into 10,coo ſhapes, ſhe keeps them long amidſt our fields, and thus compenſates for the declivity of the ſurface, which' otherwiſe would tumble them with great rapidity into the ocean, loaded with the beſt and richeſt of our ſoil. Without this, the</hi></p><p>ſhowers of heaven would have little influence in ſupply-ing the waſte of inceſſant evaporation. But as things are, the rains are kept ſlowly trickling along the ſlo-ping ſides of our hills and ſteeps, winding round every clod, nay every plant, which lengthens their courſe, diminiſhes their Hope, checks their ſpeed, and thus prevents them from quickly bruſhing off from every part of the ſurface the lighteſt and beſt of the ſoil. The flatteſt of our holm lands would be too ſteep, and the rivers would ſhoot along through our ſineſt meadows, hurrying every thing away with them, and would be unfit for the purpofes of inland conveyance, if the inequalities of ſoil did not make them change this headlong courſe for the more beautiful meanders which we obſerve in the courſe of the ſmall rivers winding through our meadows. Thoſe rivers are in general the ſtraight-eſt in their courſe which are the moſt rapid, and which roll along the greateſt bodies of water ; ſuch are the Rhone, the Po, the Danube. The ſmaller rivers continue more devious in their progreſs, till they approach the ſea, and have gathered ſtrength from all their tributary ſtreams.</p><p>Every thing aims at an equilibrium, and this directs even the ramblings of rivers. It is of importance to underſtand the relation between the force of a river and the reſiſtance which the ſoil oppoſes to thoſe deviations from a rectilineal courſe ; for it may frequently happen that the general procedure of nature may be inconſiſtent with our local purpoſes. Man was ſet down on thia globe, and the taſlc of cultivating it was given him by nature, and his chief enjoyment ſeems to be to ſtruggle with the elements. He muſt not find things to his mind, but he muſt mould them to his own fancy. Yet even this ſeeming anomaly is one of nature’s moſt beneficent laws; and his exertions muſt ſtill be made in conformity with the general train of the operations of mechanical nature : and when we have any work to undertake relative to the courſe of rivers, we muſt be careful not to thw<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>art their general rules, otherwiſe we ſhall be ſooner or later puniſhed for their infraction. Things will be brought back to tſheir former ſtate, if our operations are inconſiſtent with that equilibrium which is conſtantly aimed at, or ſome new ſtate of things which is equivalent will be ſoon induced.-If a well regulated river has been improperly deepen ed in ſome place, to anſwer ſome particular purpoſe of our own, or if its breadth has been improperly augmented, we ſhall ſoon ſee a depoſition of mud or fand choak up our ſancied improvements ; becauſe, as we have enlarged the ſection without increaſing the ſlope or the ſupply, the velocity muſt diminiſh, and floating matters muſt be depoſited.</p><p>It is true, we frequently fee permanent channels where the forms are extremely different from that which the waters would dig for themſelves in an uniform ſoil, and which approaches a good deal to the trapezium deſcribed formerly. We ſee a greater breadth frequently compenſate for a want of depth ; but all ſuch deviations are a ſort of conſtraint, or rather are indications of inequality of foil. Such irregular forms are the wOrks of nature ; and if they are permanent, the equilibrium is obtained. Commonly the bottom is harder than the ſides, conſiſting of the coarſeſt of the fand and of gravel; and therefore the neceſſary ſection can be obtained only by increaſing the width.
