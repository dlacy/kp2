<p><span class="font2">REINKENS, JOSEPH HUBERT (1821-1896), German Old Catholic bishop, was born at Burtscheid, near Aix-la-Chapelle,&nbsp;on the ist of March 1821, his father being a gardener. In&nbsp;1836, on the death of his mother, he took to manual work&nbsp;in order to support his numèrous brothers and sisters, but in&nbsp;1840 he was able to go to the gymnasium at Aix, and he afterwards studied theology at the universities of Bonn and Munich.&nbsp;He was ordained priest in 1848, and in 1849 graduated as&nbsp;doctor in theology. He was soon appointed professor of ecclesiastical history at Breslau, and in 1865 he was made rector of&nbsp;the university. During this period he wrote, among other&nbsp;treatises, monographs on Clement of Alexandria, Hilary of&nbsp;Poitiers and AIartin of Tours. In consequence of an essay&nbsp;on art, especially in tragedy, after Aristotle, he was made&nbsp;doctor in philosophy in the university of Leipzig. When,&nbsp;in 1870, the question of papal infallibility was raised, Reinkens&nbsp;attached himself to the party opposed to the proclamation of&nbsp;the dogma. He wrote several pamphlets on church tradition&nbsp;relative to infallibility and on the procedure of the Council.&nbsp;When the dogma of infallibility was proclaimed, Reinkens&nbsp;joined the band of influential theologians, headed by Dollinger,&nbsp;who resolved to organize resistance to the decree. He was&nbsp;one of those who signed the Declaration of Nüremberg in 1871,&nbsp;and at the Bonn conferences with Orientals and Anglicans in&nbsp;1874 and 1875 he was conspicuous. The Old Catholics having&nbsp;decided to separate themselves from the Church of Rome,&nbsp;Reinkens was chosen their bishop in Germany at an enthusiastic&nbsp;meeting at Cologne in 1873 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Old Catholics).</span><span class="font2"> On the nth&nbsp;of August of that year he was consecrated by Dr Heykamp,&nbsp;bishop of Deventer. Reinkens devoted himself zealously to&nbsp;his office, and it was due to his efforts that the Old Catholic&nbsp;movement crystallized into an organized church, with a definite&nbsp;status in the various German states. He wrote a number of&nbsp;theological works after his consecration, but none of them so&nbsp;important as his treatise on Cyprian and the Unity of the&nbsp;Church (1873). The chief act of his episcopal career was his&nbsp;consecration in 1876 of Dr Edward Herzog to preside as bishop&nbsp;over the Old Catholic Church in Switzerland. In 1881 Reinkens&nbsp;visited England, and received Holy Communion more than&nbsp;once with bishops, clergy and laity of the Church of England,&nbsp;and in 1894 he defended the validity of Anglican orders against&nbsp;his co-religionists, the Old Catholics of Holland. He died at&nbsp;Bonn on the 4th of January 1896.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>v</sub></span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REISKE, JOHANN JACOB (1716-1774), German scholar and physician, was born on the 25th of December 1716 at Zörbig&nbsp;in Electoral Saxony. From the Waisenhaus at Halle he passed&nbsp;in 1733 to the university of Leipzig, and there spent five years.&nbsp;He tried to find his own way in Greek literature, to which&nbsp;German schools then gave little attention; but, as he had not&nbsp;mastered the grammar, he soon found this a sore task and took&nbsp;up Arabic. He was very poor, having almost nothing beyond&nbsp;his allowance, which for the five years was only two hundred&nbsp;thalers. But everything of which he could cheat his appetite&nbsp;was spent on Arabic books, and when he had read all that&nbsp;was then printed he thirsted for manuscripts, and in March&nbsp;1738 started on foot for Hamburg, joyous though totally&nbsp;unprovided, on his way to Leiden and the treasures of the&nbsp;Warnerianum. At Hamburg he got some money and letters&nbsp;of recommendation from the Hebraist Wolf, and took ship&nbsp;to Amsterdam. Here d’Orville, to whom he had an introduction, proposed to retain him as his amanuensis at a salary&nbsp;of six hundred guilders. Reiske refused, though he thought&nbsp;the offer very generous; he did not want money, he‘wanted&nbsp;manuscripts. When he reached Leiden (June 6, 1738) he found&nbsp;that the lectures were over for the term and that the MSS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">were not open to him. But d’Orville and A. Schultens helped him to private teaching and reading for the press, by which he&nbsp;was able to live. He heard the lectures of A. Schultens, and&nbsp;practised himself in Arabic with his son J. J. SchuItens.&nbsp;Through SchuItens too he got at Arabic MSS., and was even&nbsp;allowed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sub rosa</span><span class="font2"> to take them home with him. Ultimately&nbsp;he seems to have got free access to the collection, which he&nbsp;re-catalogued—the work of almost a whole summer, for which&nbsp;the curators rewarded him with nine guilders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reiske’s first years in Leiden were not unhappy, till he got into serious trouble by introducing emendations of his own&nbsp;into the second edition of Burmann’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Petronius<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font2">  which he had&nbsp;to see through the press. His patrons withdrew from him, and&nbsp;his chance of perhaps becoming professor was gone; d’Orville&nbsp;indeed soon came round, for he could not do without Reiske,&nbsp;who did work of which his patron, after dressing it up in his&nbsp;own style, took the credit. But A. Schultcns wasoever the&nbsp;same as before to him; Reiske indeed was too independent,&nbsp;and hurt him by his open criticisms of his master’s way of&nbsp;making Arabic mainly a handmaid of Hebrew. Reiske, however,&nbsp;himself admits that Schultens always behaved honourably to&nbsp;him. In 1742 by Schultens’s advice Reiske took up medicine&nbsp;as a study by which he might hope to live if he could not do so&nbsp;by philology. In 1746 he graduated as M.D., the fees being&nbsp;remitted at Schultens’s intercession. It was Schultens too&nbsp;who conquered the difficulties opposed to his graduation at&nbsp;the last moment by the faculty of theology on the ground that&nbsp;some of his theses had a materialistic ring. * On the roth of&nbsp;June 1746 he left Holland and settled in Leipzig, where he&nbsp;hoped to get medical practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But his shy, proud nature was not fitted to gain patients, and the Leipzig doctors would not recommend one who&nbsp;was not a Leipzig graduate. In 1747 an Arabic dedication&nbsp;to the electoral prince of Saxony got him the title of professor,&nbsp;but neither the faculty of arts nor that of medicine was willing&nbsp;to admit him among them, and he never delivered a course of&nbsp;lectures. He had still to go on doing literary task-work, but&nbsp;his labour was much worse paid in Leipzig than in Leiden.&nbsp;Still he could have lived and sent his old mother, as his custom&nbsp;was, a yearly present of a piece of leather to be sold in retail&nbsp;if he had been a better manager. But, careless for the morrow,&nbsp;he was always printing at his own cost great books which&nbsp;found no buyers. His academical colleagues were hostile;&nbsp;and Ernesti, under a show of friendship, secretly hindered&nbsp;his promotion. His unsparing reviews made bad blood with&nbsp;the pillars of the university.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At length in 1758 the magistrates of Leipzig rescued him from his misery by giving him the rcctorate of St Nicolai,&nbsp;and, though he still made no way with the leading men of the&nbsp;university and suffered from the hostility of men like Ruhnkcn&nbsp;and J. D. Michaelis, he was compensated for this by the esteem&nbsp;of Frederick the Great, of Lessing, Karsten Niebuhr, and many&nbsp;foreign scholars. The last decade of his life was made cheerful&nbsp;by his marriage with Ernestine Müller, who shared all his&nbsp;interests and learned Greek to help him with collations. In&nbsp;proof of his gratitude her portrait stands beside his in the&nbsp;first volume of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Oratores Graeci.</span><span class="font2"> Reiske died on the 14th of&nbsp;August 1774, and his MS. remains passed, through Lessing’s&nbsp;mediation, to the Danish minister Suhm, and are now in the&nbsp;Copenhagen library.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reiske certainly surpassed all his predecessors in the range and quality of his knowledge of Arabic literature. It was the history, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">realia</span><span class="font1"> of the literature, that always interested him; he did not care&nbsp;for Arabic poetry as such, and the then much praised Hariri seemed&nbsp;to him a grammatical pedant. He read the poets* less for their&nbsp;verses than for such scholia as supplied historical notices. Thus for&nbsp;example the scholia on Jarir furnished him with a remarkable&nbsp;notice of the prevalence of Buddhist doctrine and asceticism in&nbsp;'Irak under the Omayyads. In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adnotationes historicae</span><span class="font1"> to his&nbsp;Abulfeda </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(AbulT Annales Moslemici,</span><span class="font1"> 5 vols., Copenhagen, 1789-91),&nbsp;he collected a veritable treasure of sound and original research ; he&nbsp;knew the Byzantine writers as thoroughly as the. Arabic authors, and&nbsp;was alike at home in modern works of travel in all languages and&nbsp;in ancient and medieval authorities. He was interested too in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
