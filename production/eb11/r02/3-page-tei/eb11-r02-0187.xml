The chief, Venkat Raman Singh, was born in 1876, succeeded in 1880. and was created G.C.S.l. in 1897. During his minority the administration was reformed. He is Rajput of the Baghela branch of the Solanki race, and is descended from the founder of the Anhilwara Patan dynasty in Gujarat.</p><p>The town of Rewa is 131 m. S. of Allahabad. Pop. (1901) 24, 608. It has a high school, also the Victoria and zenana hospitals and a model gaol. The political agent for Bagelkhand resides at Satna, on the East Indian railway: pop. (1901) 7471.</p><p>REWA KANTHA, a political agency or collection of native states in India, subordinate to the government of Bombay. It stretches for about 150 m. between the plain of Gujarat and the hills of Malwa, from the river Tapti to the Mahi, crossing the Nerbudda or Rewa, from which it takes its name. The number of separate states is 61, many of which are under British jurisdiction. The only important one is Rajpipla <hi rend="italic">(q.vf.</hi>  It includes also five second-class states entitled Chota Udaipur, Bariya, Sunth, Lunawada and Balaimor. Total area, 4972 sq. m. In 1901 the population was 479,065, showing a decrease of 35 % in the decade, due to the results of famine. Estimated revenue, £140,000; tribute (mostly to the gaekwar of Baroda), £10,000. Many of the inhabitants belong to the wild tribes of Bhils and Kolis. The political agent, who is also collector of the British district of the Panch Mahals, resides at Godhra.</p><p>REWARD, recompense, a gift or payment in return for services rendered. “ Reward ” and “ regard ” are forms of the same word. Old French, from which both words came into English, also had <hi rend="italic">rewarder</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">regarder</hi>  (the latter form only surviving in modern French), from <hi rend="italic">re-,</hi>  back, in return, and <hi rend="italic">warder, garder,</hi>  to watch, protect—ultimately a Teutonic word, from the base <hi rend="italic">war-,</hi>  to defend; cf. “ ward ” and “ guard,” which are thus also doublets. In early use in English, “ reward and “ regard ” were interchangeable in meaning; thus in <hi rend="italic">Piers Plowman,</hi>  xi. 129, “ Reson rod forth and tok reward of no man,” cf. “ The towne doth receave ... an annuall regard for the same ” (a 16th-century reference quoted by the <hi rend="italic">New English Dictionary</hi>  from R. Willis and J. W. Clark, <hi rend="italic">Archil. Hist, of Univ. of Cambridge,</hi>  1886). In use the words are now distinct, “ regard ” being restricted to such meanings as attention, respect, esteem, consideration.</p><p>In English law the offering of rewards presents two distinct aspects: (1) with reference to the nature of the information or act for the giving or doing whereof the reward is offered; (2) with reference to the nature of the relation created between the person offering and the person claiming the reward.</p><p><hi rend="bold">1.    </hi>Courts of assize and quarter sessions are empowered to order the payment of rewards to persons who have been active in or towards the apprehension of persons charged with certain specified crimes against person and property (Criminal Law, 1826, ss. 28, 29; Criminal Justice Administration Act 1851, ss. 7, 8). The rewards are payable according to a scale fixed by the home secretary. In the case of courts of quarter sessions the maximum is £5. Courts of assize may award a larger sum where extraordinary courage and diligence have been shown towards the apprehension. The sums awarded are paid out of the rate or fund chargeable with the costs of assizes and sessions. It is illegal to advertise for the recovery of stolen property (including dogs) on terms of not asking questions (Larceny Act 1861, s. 102; Larceny Advertisements Acts 1870, s. 3). The advertiser and the newspaper which publishes it incur a penalty of £50. (See <hi rend="italic">Mirams</hi>  v. <hi rend="italic">Our Dogs Publishing Co.,</hi>  1901, 2 K.B, 564.) It is a criminal offence at common law to offer any reward on terms leading to compounding a felony or sheltering the offender (2?. v. <hi rend="italic">Burgess,</hi>  1886, 16 Q.B.D. 141), and under the Larceny Act 1861 Jss. 20, 101) it is criminal to accept a reward for recovery of stolen property without bringing the thief to justice.</p><p>2.    Where a reward is lawfully offered for information the person who first supplies the required information, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>  satisfies the conditions on which the reward is payable, is entitled to</p><p>recover by action the reward offered. Performance of the conditions is an acceptance of the offer <hi rend="italic">(Carlill</hi>  v. <hi rend="italic">Carbolic Smoke Ball Co.,</hi>  1893, i Q.B. 256, 270). Thus on an advertisement for information leading to the arrest and conviction of shop-breakers, T. gave information which led to the arrest of R., who while in prison told the police whcrc to find thc thieves. T. was held entitled to the reward <hi rend="italic">(Tarner</hi>  v. <hi rend="italic">Walker,</hi>  1866, L.R. i Q.B. 641). This rule applies even where the offer is general to all the world <hi rend="italic">(Williams</hi>  v. <hi rend="italic">Carwardine,</hi>  1833, 4 B. &amp; Ad. 621; <hi rend="italic">Spencerv. Harding<hi rend="sub">1</hi></hi>  1870, L. R. 5 C.P. 561). It would seem that on grounds of public policy an offender could not claim the reward on Surrenderinghimselfto justice <hi rend="italic">(Bentv. Wakefield &amp;c. Bank,</hi>  1878, 4 C.P.D. 1,4). It is not clear whether officers of justice are by their office and duty debarred from claiming rewards offered for the arrest of offenders (Ibid. p. 5).</p><p>REWARI, a town of British India, in Gurgaon district of thc Punjab, 32 m. S.W. of Gurgaon, on thc Rajputana-Malwa railway. Pop. (1901) 27,295. It is an important centre of trade, being thc junction for the Rewari-Bhatinda branch of the Rajputana railway. The chief manufacture is that of brass-ware for cooking utensils.</p><p>REWBELL, JEAN FRANÇOIS (1747-1807), French politician, was born at Colmar (then in the department of Haut-Rhin) on the 8th of October 1747. He was president <hi rend="italic">(bâtonnier)</hi>  of the order of <hi rend="italic">avocats</hi>  in Colmar, and in 1789 was elected deputy* to the States-General by the Third Estate of the <hi rend="italic">bailliage</hi>  of Colmar-Schlestadt. In the Constituent Assembly his oratorical gifts, legal knowledge and austerity of life gave him much influence. During the session of the Legislative Assembly he exercised the functions of <hi rend="italic">procureur syndic</hi>  and was subsequently secretary-general of the department of Haut-Rhin. In the Convention he was a zealous promoter of the trial of Louis XVI., but was absent on mission at the time of thc king’s condemnation. He took part in thc reactionary movement which followed the fall of Robespierre, and became a member of the reorganized Committees of Public Safety and General Security. The moderation he displayed caused his election by seventeen departments to the Council of Five Hundred. Appointed a member of the Directory on the ist of October 1795, he became its president in 1796, and retired by ballot in 1799. He then entered the Council of Ancients. After the <hi rend="italic">coup P état</hi>  of 18 Brumaire he retired from public life, and died at Colmar on the 23rd of November 1807.</p><p>See L. Sciout, <hi rend="italic">Le Directoire</hi>  (Paris, 1895-97).</p><p>REYBAUD, MARIE ROCH LOUIS (1799-1879), French writer, economist and politician, was born at Marseilles on the 15th of August 1799. After travelling in the Levant and in India, he settled in Paris in 1829. Besides writing for the Radical press, he edited the <hi rend="italic">Histoire scientifique et militaire de Vexpédition française en Egypte</hi>  in ten volumes (1830-36) and Dumont d’Urville’s <hi rend="italic">Voyage autour du monde</hi>  (1833). In 1840 he published <hi rend="italic">Études sur les reformateurs ou socialistes modernes </hi>(see <hi rend="smallcaps">Socialism)</hi>  which gained him the Montyon prize (1841) and a place in the Àcadénffe des sciences morales et politiques (1850). In 1843 he published <hi rend="italic">Jérôme Paturot à la recherche Pune position sociale,</hi>  a clever social satire that had a prodigious success. In 1846 he abandoned his democratic views, and was elected liberal deputy for Marseilles. His <hi rend="italic">Jérôme Paturot à la recherche de la meilleure des républiques</hi>  (1848) was a satire on the new Republican ideas. After the <hi rend="italic">coup P état</hi>  of 1849 he ceased to take part in public life, and devoted himself entirely to the study of political economy. To this period belong his <hi rend="italic">La Vie de l'employé </hi>(1855); <hi rend="italic">L'Industrie en Europe</hi>  (1856); and <hi rend="italic">Études sur le régime de nos manufactures</hi>  (1859). He died in Paris on the 28th of October 1879.</p><p>REYER, ERNEST (1823-    ), French composer, was bom</p><p>at Marseilles on the ist of December 1823. At the age of sixteen he went to Algeria, and remained there some years. The outcome of his residence there was a symphonic ode entitled <hi rend="italic">Le Sêlam,</hi>  the musical orientalism of which had, unluckily for him, already been anticipated by Félicien David in <hi rend="italic">Le Désert. Maître Wolfram,</hi>  a one-act opera, was produced at the Opéra comique</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
