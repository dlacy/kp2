<p><span class="font1">river of the Deccan. The country produces abundance of sugar, which is cultivated to a great extent in the island of&nbsp;Nagur, and along the banks of the Elyseram River, from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">, abundant flow of whose water during the whole year the sugar-plantations arc watered during the driest seasons ;&nbsp;and also a variety of other productions are grown, such as&nbsp;paddy, ginger, turmeric, yams, and chillies. Sugar is also&nbsp;grown in considerable quantities in the delta of the Godavery,&nbsp;where the cultivation might be carried to any amount,&nbsp;and where, during the interval between the crops, leguminous plants are reared. The country, from the commencement of the hills along the banks of the Godavery, to Po-loonshah on the frontiers of Commamet, is the seat of extensive forests, where the teak-trees are produced in abundance, there being no other country on the east side of the&nbsp;Bay of Bengal which furnishes this valuable timber. Some&nbsp;attempts have been made to raise pepper, but this valuable&nbsp;product is produced in greater abundance and perfection&nbsp;on the Malabar coast. The principal towns are Rajamun-dry, Ingeram, Coringa, Bundermalanca, Peddapoor, and&nbsp;Pettipoor ; but Coringa is the only port which carries on&nbsp;any considerable export trade. Rajamundry was ceded to&nbsp;the French in 1753 by Salabut Jung, the subahdar of the&nbsp;Deccan, and acquired by the British under Lord Clive in&nbsp;1765. Many additional dependencies, however, have since&nbsp;been acquired by conquest or policy ; and it now constitutes&nbsp;one of the five collectorships into which the Northern Cir-cars were subdivided in 1803.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rajamcndby, the capital of the above-mentioned district, and the residence of the British civil establishment, is sittiated on the east bank of the Godavery, forty miles from&nbsp;the sca. It formerly possessed a good brick fort, which is&nbsp;now in ruins. Long. 81. 54. E. Lat. 16. 59. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RΛJEGHUR, a town of Hindustan, in the territories of the Malnattas, and province of Malwah, situated on the&nbsp;western bank of the Sopra River, sixty-seven miles north-east&nbsp;from Oojain. Long. 76. 27. E. Lat. 23. 56. N. There is&nbsp;another town of the same name in the province of Allahabad, situated on the river Cane, eighteen miles south-east&nbsp;from Chatterpoor. Long. 80. 5. E. Lat. 24. 44. N. Ra-jeghur is also the name of a range of hills in the province of&nbsp;Bahar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAJEMAL, or Rajemahal, an extensive but unproductive district of Bengal, situated about the twenty-fifth degree of north latitude. It has on the north Purneah and&nbsp;Dinagepoor, on the south the large zemindary of Raujeshy,&nbsp;on the east Dinagepoor and Raujeshy, and on the west&nbsp;Monghir and Purneah. It is situated on the western bank&nbsp;of the Ganges, and comprises a great extent of waste and&nbsp;mountainous territory, inhabited in many parts by the aborigines of the country, who speak a distinct language, and&nbsp;differ entirely from the Hindus of Bengal in their manners,&nbsp;as they eat without scruple all kinds of animals. They are&nbsp;mostly low in stature, but strong and well proportioned.&nbsp;There are many of them under five feet ten inches, and&nbsp;more under five feet than above it. They have generally&nbsp;flattened noses, and lips thicker than the inhabitants of&nbsp;the plains. The country is for the most part barren and&nbsp;sandy. The soil in the vicinity of Rajemahal is said to be&nbsp;composed of a mixture of granite rock, which is not to be&nbsp;found lower down the river. The plains produce wheat&nbsp;and barley, and the villages abound with mango-trees of excellent quality. Indian corn and other grains form part of&nbsp;the crops, as well as rice, the mulberry tree, and the indigo plant. The castor-oil plant is raised in great quantities&nbsp;in the field ; and in the jungles, which occupy large tracts&nbsp;of the country, the grass grows to the height of eight or&nbsp;ten feet, and is adorned at the top with a beautiful white&nbsp;down, resembling swans’ feathers. These jungles afford&nbsp;shelter to numerous tigers, bears, and other wild beasts.&nbsp;It was in this district that the experiment was first tried of&nbsp;granting lands to the native invalid officers and soldiers, on&nbsp;condition of their residing upon them and cultivating them.&nbsp;In this manner was formed in the wilds the village of Sicli-gully ; and this measure has been attended with the best&nbsp;effects, so that the traveller now passes with as much safety&nbsp;from human foes, in this district, as in any other part of the&nbsp;country. The territory is separated from Bahar by a range&nbsp;of hills, the Rajemahal Hills, compared by Bishop Heber to&nbsp;the hills of Cheshire, and consisting of a coarse granite.&nbsp;Through these hills are several passes, the chief of which is&nbsp;Terriagully, up a narrow winding road, where there is a&nbsp;ruined gateway and fort, which formerly commanded the&nbsp;high road leading from Moorshedabad to Patna, and was&nbsp;considered as the key of Bengal. The roads are generally&nbsp;indifferent, owing to the force of the torrents during the&nbsp;rains, which bar up the bridges, and carry devastation&nbsp;throughout the country. The principal articles of traffic are&nbsp;common Hindustanee bedsteads, wood, planks, charcoal,&nbsp;cotton, honey, plantains, and sweet potatoes, which are exchanged for salt, tobacco, rice, cloth, iron heads for arrows,&nbsp;hatchets, crooks, and iron instruments. Their domestic&nbsp;animals are hogs, goats, and fowls, besides cats and dogs.&nbsp;The people of these mountains, observes Bishop Heber,&nbsp;and of all tile hilly country between Sicligully and Burd-wan, are a distinct race from those of the plain, in features,&nbsp;language, civilization, and religion. They have neither&nbsp;castes nor Hindu deities, and are even said to have no idols.&nbsp;They are still more naked than even the Hindu peasants, and&nbsp;live chiefly by the chase, pursuing their game witll bows&nbsp;and arrows. Some few of them have fire-arms. Until within the last fifty years, a deadly feud existed between them&nbsp;and the cultivators of the neighbouring lands, upon which&nbsp;they were continually making forays; and being both thieves&nbsp;and murderers, they were shot without mercy by the zemindars, in the same manner as tigers or other wild beasts.&nbsp;But by the wise and benevolent management of an excellent&nbsp;young man, judge and magistrate of Boglipoor, these rude&nbsp;tribes were reclaimed from their barbarous habits by just&nbsp;and merciful treatment, all violence on the part of the zemindars being forbidden, and promptly punished. He took&nbsp;other methods of conciliating their favour, and engaged&nbsp;sevcral of them to enter his service; he established bazaars&nbsp;at the villages nearest them, and encouraged them to bring&nbsp;for sale game, millet, wax, hides, and honey, which are produced abundantly in their hills ; he gave them wheat and&nbsp;barley for seed ; and, finally, he raised amongst them a&nbsp;corps of Sepoys, who were established at Sicligully, and&nbsp;gave the command of them to a native chief, named Jow-rah, who, Bishop Heber remarks, was the Rob Roy, or more&nbsp;properly the Roderick Dhti, of the Rajemalials, but who fully&nbsp;justified the judgment and discrimination of Mr Cleveland’s&nbsp;choice. “ This good and wise man,” adds Bishop Heber,&nbsp;a pattern himself of the same qualities, “ died in 1784, at&nbsp;the early age of twenty-nine. In honour of his memory, a&nbsp;monument, in the form of a pagoda, was erected by the zemindars and others, at the expense of government.” The&nbsp;principal towns are Rajemal and Maulda, and the chief river&nbsp;the Ganges, but it is intersected by a variety of smaller&nbsp;streams in all directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rajemal </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{the royal residence),</span><span class="font1"> the capital of the above district, is situated on the western bank of the Ganges, at&nbsp;the foot of a range of hills. The modern town consists only&nbsp;of one street, composed of stone, generally two stories in&nbsp;height, with the ruins of a palace, which has been much&nbsp;injured by the encroachments of the river. Its empty halls,&nbsp;marble porticoes, and half-decayed vaults, still presentimages&nbsp;of its former grandeur. An inconsiderable traffic continues&nbsp;to be carried on with the inhabitants of the hills ; and there&nbsp;are quarries which supply the neighbourhood with flags anti&nbsp;millstones. This place decayed from various causes, namely, an inundation of the Ganges, which swept away a con-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
