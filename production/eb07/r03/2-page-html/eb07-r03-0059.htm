<p><span class="font0">and the north of Europe was again condemned to submit in silence to her yoke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the 13th of October 1806, the Prussians received a dreadful check at the battle of Jena ; and on the 27th of&nbsp;the same month Napoleon entered Berlin. While the&nbsp;French were thus successful, the troops of the Emperor&nbsp;Alexander occupied Prussian Poland, and took up their residence at Warsaw ; but they were soon attacked by the&nbsp;French under Murat, who on the 28th entered Warsaw&nbsp;with his cavalry, on which the Russians retreated across&nbsp;the Vistula, burning the bridge over which they had passed.&nbsp;On the 26th of December, a dreadful engagement took&nbsp;place between the Russians commanded by General Ben-ningsen, and the French under Generals Murat, Davoust,&nbsp;and Lannes. The scene of action was at Ostralenka, about&nbsp;sixty miles from Warsaw, and the fighting continued for&nbsp;three days. The loss was immense on both sides, though&nbsp;the advantage appears to have been on the side of the&nbsp;French. According to French accounts, the Russian army&nbsp;lost twelve thousand men in killed and wounded, together&nbsp;with eighty pieces of cannon, and all its ammunition waggons ; while the Russian account states the loss of the French&nbsp;at five thousand men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the beginning of February 1807, the Russians obtained a partial advantage in the battle of Eylau. According to the account of this battle, given by General de Bud-berg in a despatch to the Marquis of Douglas, the British ambassador at St Petersburg, the Russian general Ben-ningsen, after having fallen back for the purpose of choosing a position which he judged well adapted for manoeuvring&nbsp;the troops under his command, drew up his army at Preus-sisch Eylau. During four days successively his rear-guard&nbsp;had to withstand several vigorous assaults ; and on the 7th&nbsp;of February, at three o’clock in the afternoon, the battle&nbsp;became general throughout the whole line of the main army.&nbsp;The contest was destructive, and night came on before it&nbsp;could be decided. Early on the following morning the&nbsp;French renewed the attack, and the action was contested&nbsp;with obstinacy on both sides ; but towards the evening of&nbsp;that day the assailants were repulsed, and the Russian general remained master of the field. In this action Napoleon commanded in person, having under him Augereau,&nbsp;Davoust, Soult, Ney, and Bessieres at the bead of the imperial guards. The loss of the Russians in that engagement was by themselves stated at above six thousand men,&nbsp;while they estimated that of the French, probably untruly,&nbsp;at nearly double that number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This was the last important stand made by the Russian army. In May, Dantzig, defended by eighteen thousand&nbsp;Russians and Prussians, surrendered to the French. Several actions succeeded at Spanden, at Lamitten, at Guttotadt,&nbsp;and at Heilsberg, in all of which the French had the advantage, till at length, on the 14th of June, the Russians appeared in considerable force upon the bridge of Friedland,&nbsp;whither the French army under Napoleon was advancing.&nbsp;At three in the morning the report of cannon was first heard,&nbsp;and at this time Marshals Lannes and Mortier were engaged&nbsp;with the Russians. After various manœuvres, the Russian&nbsp;troops received a check, and filed off towards Konigsberg.&nbsp;In the afternoon the French army drew up in order of battle,&nbsp;having Marshal Ney on the right, Lannes in the centre, and&nbsp;Mortier 'on the left, while Victor commanded a corps de reserve, consisting of the guards. At half-past five the attack began on the side of Marshal Ney ; and notwithstanding the different movements of the Russians to effect a diversion, the French soon carried all before them. Theloss&nbsp;of the Russians, according to the usual exaggerations of the&nbsp;French bulletins, was estimated at from ten thousand to&nbsp;fifteen thousand men, and twenty-five of their generals were&nbsp;said to have been killed, wounded, or taken. In consequence of this victory the French became masters of all the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">country round Konigsberg, and Marshal Soult entered that city in triumph. Thus concluded the campaign in Ger-'&nbsp;many, in which the Russians sustained a loss of at least&nbsp;thirty thousand of their choicest troops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">While these military operations were going forward on the continent of Europe, the emissaries of France were'&nbsp;busily employed at Constantinople in exciting the divan to'&nbsp;declare against their ancient enemies. They at length succeeded ; for on the 30th of December 1806 war with Russia was proclaimed, and twenty-eight regiments of janissaries assembled under the command of the grand vizir. But&nbsp;the disturbances which broke out in the latter end of May&nbsp;1807 prevented any operations of importance from taking&nbsp;place ; and the pacification which was soon concluded between Russia and France, though it did not entirely put a&nbsp;stop to the war between the former power and Turkey, in&nbsp;some measure diminished their hostile preparations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The defeats which the allied armies had sustained in Prussia and Poland rendered peace, on almost any terms,&nbsp;a desirable object ; and Alexander found himself constrained to meet, at least with the appearance of friendship, the&nbsp;conqueror of his armies. Propositions for an armistice had&nbsp;been made by the Prussian general to Murat near Tilsit,&nbsp;and after the battle of Friedland the Russian prince Laba-noff had a conference, on similar views, with the prince of&nbsp;Neufchatel, soon after which an armistice was concluded&nbsp;between the French and Russians. On the 25th of June&nbsp;an amicable meeting took place on the river Niemen, between the emperors of Frajice and Russia, and adjoining&nbsp;apartments were fitted up for the reception of both courts&nbsp;in the town of Tilsit. This politic friendship was soon after&nbsp;cemented by the treaty of Tilsit, concluded between the&nbsp;emperor of the French on the one part, and the emperor&nbsp;of Russia and the king of Prussia (whom it despoiled of a&nbsp;fourth of his dominions) on the other, on the 7th and 12th&nbsp;of July in this year. Thenceforth, until Napoleon’s star&nbsp;began to wane, Alexander was his firm partisan ; and his&nbsp;faithlessness towards his former allies gave them no temptation to repose further confidence in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The conclusion of the treaty of Tilsit was notified to the court of London on the 1st of August ; and at the same&nbsp;time a proposal was made from his imperial majesty for mediating a peace between France and Britain. This mediation, however, was declined on the part of Great Britain, until his Britannic majesty should be made acquainted&nbsp;with the stipulations of the treaty of Tilsit, and should find&nbsp;them such as might afford him a just hope of the attainment of a secure and honourable peace. This declining of&nbsp;the mediation of Russia was no doubt expected by the court&nbsp;of St Petersburg ; but it served as a pretext for binding&nbsp;more closely the alliance between that power and France,&nbsp;by breaking off her connection with Great Britain. Accordingly, in October, Lord Granville Leveson Gower, who&nbsp;had succeeded the Marquis of Douglas as British envoy, received a note from the government, intimating that, as a&nbsp;British ambassador, he could no longer be received at the&nbsp;court of St Petersburg, which he therefore soon after quitted. An embargo was laid on all British vessels in the&nbsp;ports of Russia, and it was peremptorily required by Napoleon and Alexander that Sweden should abandon her&nbsp;alliance with Great Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An additional ground of complaint against the British court was furnished by the attack on Copenhagen, and the&nbsp;seizure of the Danish fleet, in the beginning of September ;&nbsp;and though Lord Gower had attempted to justify these&nbsp;measures on the plea of anticipating the French in the&nbsp;same transaction, the emperor of Russia expressed, in the&nbsp;warmest terms, his indignation at what he called an unjust&nbsp;attack on a neutral power. A considerable Russian fleet&nbsp;joined the French ; but the combined squadrons were compelled to seek for shelter in the Tagus, where they remain-</span></p>
