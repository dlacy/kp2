The defeat&nbsp;at Novara compelled the resignation of Rattazzi in March&nbsp;1849. His election as president of the chamber in 1852&nbsp;was one of the earliest results of the so-called “ connubio ”&nbsp;with Cavour, and having become minister of justice in&nbsp;1853 he in that and the next following years was able to&nbsp;carry a number of measures of reform of considerable&nbsp;importance, including that for the suppression of certain&nbsp;of the monastic orders. During a momentary reaction of&nbsp;public opinion he resigned office in 1858, but again entered&nbsp;the cabinet under La Marmora in 1859 as minister of the&nbsp;interior. In consequence of the cession of Nice and Savoy&nbsp;he again retired in January 1860. He was entrusted with&nbsp;the formation of a new ministry in March 1862, but in&nbsp;consequence of his policy of repression towards Garibaldi&nbsp;was driven from office in the following December. He&nbsp;was again prime minister in 1867, from April to October.&nbsp;His death took place at Frosinone on 5th June 1873.&nbsp;(See </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Italy, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xiii. p. 488 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sq.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RATTLESNAKE. Rattlesnakes are a small group of the family of Pit-vipers (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crotalidx</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">), characterized by a&nbsp;tail which terminates in a chain of horny, loosely connected rings, the so-called “ rattle.״ The “ pit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> by which&nbsp;the family is distinguished from the ordinary vipers is a&nbsp;deep depression in the integument of the sides of the&nbsp;snout, between the nostrils and the eye; its physiological&nbsp;function is unknown. The rattle is a complicated and&nbsp;highly specialized organ, developed from the simple conical&nbsp;scale or epidermal spine, which in the majority of snakes&nbsp;forms the termination of the general integument of the tail.&nbsp;The bone by which the root of the rattle is supported&nbsp;consists of the last caudal vertebrae, from three to eight&nbsp;in number, which are enlarged, dilated, compressed, and&nbsp;coalesced (fig. 1, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a).</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> This bone is covered with thick and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vascular cutis, transversely divided by two constrictions into three portions, of which the proximal is larger than&nbsp;the median, and the median much larger than the distal&nbsp;(fig. 2, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a).</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> This cuticular portion constitutes the matrix&nbsp;of a horny epidermoid covering which closely fits the&nbsp;shape of the underlying soft part and which is the first&nbsp;commencement of the rattle, as it appears in very young&nbsp;rattlesnakes before they have shed their skin for the first&nbsp;time. When the period of a renewal of the skin approaches&nbsp;a new covering of the extremity of the tail is formed below&nbsp;the old one, but the latter, instead of being cast off with&nbsp;the remainder of the epidermis, is retained by the posterior&nbsp;swelling of the end of the tail, forming now the first loose&nbsp;joint of the rattle. This process is repeated on succeeding</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">exuviations,—the new joints being always larger than the old ones as long as the snake grows (fig. 3). Perfect&nbsp;rattles therefore taper towards the point, but generally&nbsp;the oldest (terminal) joints wear away in time and are&nbsp;lost. As rattlesnakes shed their skins more than once&nbsp;every year, the number of joints of the rattle does not&nbsp;indicate the age of the animal but the number of exuviations which it has undergone. The largest rattle in the&nbsp;British Museum has twenty-one joints. The rattle (fig. 4)&nbsp;consists thus of a variable number of dry, hard, horny&nbsp;cup-shaped joints, each of which loosely grasps a portion&nbsp;of the preceding, and all of which are capable of being&nbsp;shaken against each other. If the interspaces between&nbsp;the joints are filled with water, as often happens in wet&nbsp;weather, no noise can be produced. The motor power lies&nbsp;in the lateral muscles of the tail, by which a vibratory&nbsp;motion is communicated to the rattle, the noise produced&nbsp;being similar to that of a weak child’s rattle and perceptible at a distance of from 10 to 20 yards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The habit of violently and rapidly agitating the tail is by no means peculiar to the rattlesnake, but has been&nbsp;observed in other venomous as well as innocuous snakes&nbsp;with the ordinary termination of the tail, when under&nbsp;the influence of fear or anger. The special object for&nbsp;which the rattle has been developed in these snakes is&nbsp;unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rattlesnakes are entirely confined to the New World. North-American authors distinguish now a great number&nbsp;of different kinds, the most recent, Garman (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reptiles and&nbsp;Batrachians of North America,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1883, 4to), enumerating&nbsp;twelve distinct species and thirteen additional varieties;&nbsp;but all these species or varieties fall into two groups, viz.,&nbsp;one which has the upper side of the head covered with the&nbsp;ordinary nine dermal shields, and the other in which the&nbsp;shields between and behind the eyes are broken up or&nbsp;replaced by small scales. The former group consists of&nbsp;two species only, of comparatively small size, both North&nbsp;American, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crotalus miliarius</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> being the more generally&nbsp;known. The second group comprises the more formidable&nbsp;kinds of South as well as North America, which are generally described under the names of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. horridus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C.&nbsp;durissus.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> In the older standard w’orks the former name&nbsp;was applied to the southern form, which extends from&nbsp;Paraguay and Chili through Brazil into Mexico, and the&nbsp;latter to the common North-American rattlesnake; in&nbsp;modern American works this nomenclature is reversed.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. horridus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. durissus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> belong to the most dangerous of poisonous snakes. If a person bitten by an adult&nbsp;rattlesnake escapes with life, protracted illness and the&nbsp;loss of or injury to the wounded limb are frequently the&nbsp;consequence. They inhabit localities to which the sun has&nbsp;free access, prairies, rough stony ground, &amp;c. Specimens&nbsp;of 5 feet in length are not rare. Formerly common in&nbsp;the eastern parts of the United States, and still so in thinly&nbsp;inhabited districts of the western States, rattlesnakes, like&nbsp;the vipers of Europe, have gradually succumbed to the&nbsp;unceasing persecution of man. They vary much in colour :&nbsp;a common type of coloration is a brownish ground-colour,&nbsp;sometimes yellowish, sometimes blackish. Series of large&nbsp;dark spots, frequently edged with yellow, and of very&nbsp;variable shape, run along the back and sides. The head&nbsp;and neck are ornamented with dark or black longitudinal&nbsp;bands, or are marked by an almost uniform coloration.</span></p>

In 1814 he obtained the prize&nbsp;offered by the academy of Gottingen for the best treatment</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
