<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">hàff to contend </span><span class="font1">with regular military bodies, and not with undifciplined multitudes, as they expected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The duke of Brunſwick encamped his army at La Lun, near the camp of Dumourier. And here the&nbsp;Pruffians began to be in extreme dlſtrefs both from&nbsp;ſickneſs and famine. No temptation could induce the&nbsp;inhabitants of the country to carry proviſions to the&nbsp;hoſtile camp, while at the fame time the French army&nbsp;was abundantly ſupplied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bournonville, with a body of 4000 men, intercepted ſeveral droves of cattle and other convoys of proviſions&nbsp;deſtined for the Pruffians. The rain fell in torrents,&nbsp;and the roads were uncommonly deep. Expoſed to the&nbsp;cold, the moiſture, and want of proviſions, the Pruffians&nbsp;raſhly ate great quantities of the grapes of Champagne.&nbsp;The conſequence of this was, that an epidemical diſtem-per commenced and ſpread through the army to ſuch an&nbsp;extent, that 10,000 men at one time were unfit for duty.&nbsp;The duke of Brunſwick, however, ſtill commanded a&nbsp;force much more numerous than that of Dumourier ;&nbsp;and he has been much cenſured for not attacking his&nbsp;camp, and forcing him to engage. It has been laid,&nbsp;that the veteran and numerous force which he com-manded would have marched to certain victory a-gainſt the raw troops that oppoſed them ; that, having defeated Dumourier’s army, there was nothing&nbsp;to oppoſe their march to Paris. But the duke ot&nbsp;Brunſwick had entered France upon the ſuppoſition,&nbsp;that in its preſent diſtracted ſtate no regular army could&nbsp;be brought into the field againſt him, and that the&nbsp;people at large were hoſtile to the ruling faction. ſſ he&nbsp;contrary of ail this had turned out to be true. He&nbsp;found himſelf in the midſt of an hoſtile people, and op-poſed by ſkilful military chiefs. A defeat in ſuch a&nbsp;ſituation would have brought certain ruin to his army ;&nbsp;and even the loſs ſnſtained in the acquiſition of a victory might have proved equally fatal. ſſ he remains of&nbsp;the French army would not fail to hang upon his rear 5&nbsp;and from the diſpoſition of the people it appeared impoffible to aſcertain to what amount that army might&nbsp;be ſuddenly increaſed. After propoſing a truce, there-fore, which laſted eight days, he commenced his retreat&nbsp;towards Grandpré, and no advantage v/as gained over&nbsp;him in the courſe of it. Verdun was retaken by the&nbsp;French on the 12th of October, and Longwy on the&nbsp;18 th; the ſiege of Thionville was at the ſame time raiſed.&nbsp;That ſmall, but ſtrong fortreſs, under the command of&nbsp;general Felix wimpfen, had held in check an army of&nbsp;15,000 men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">while the Pruffians were advancing from the north-eaſt, the Auſtrians under the duke of Saxe Tefchen laid ſiege to Liſie. The council-general of the commune anfwered tlte ſummons of the beſiegers thus, &quot;we&nbsp;have juſt renewed our oath to be faithful to the nation,,&nbsp;and to maintain liberty and equality, or to die at our&nbsp;poſt. we wili not perjure ourſelves.” Such was the&nbsp;cant of theſe men who had already perjured themſelves&nbsp;by contributing to overturn the conſtitution which they&nbsp;had repeatedly fworn to defend. The Auſtrian batte-ries began to play upon the town on the 29th, and were&nbsp;chieflydirected againſt that quarter which was inhabi-ted by the lowcr claſs of citizens, for the purpoſe of making them mutinous and ſeditious. This procedure was&nbsp;ill judged. The lower claſtes of mankind are always&nbsp;much accuſtomed to hardſhips, and they go fartheſt </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ſupport of any enthuſiaſtic principle they have been&nbsp;perſuaded to adopt. Accordingly, though a great part&nbsp;of the ciry was reduced to a heap of ruins, the citizens&nbsp;of Liſie became daily more obſtinate. They received&nbsp;each other into the houſes that were ſtill ſtanding, and&nbsp;every vault and cellar was occupied. Although up-wards of 30,000 red-hot balls and 6000 bombs were&nbsp;thrown into the city, beſides the efforts made by an im-menſe battering train of artillery, yet the loſs both to the&nbsp;garriſon and people did not exceed 500 pet ſons, moſt of&nbsp;whom were women and children. Aſter a fortnight&nbsp;of fruitlefs labour the Auſtrians raiſed the ſiege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">war had been declared againſt the king of Sardinia on account of the threatening appearances exhibited in&nbsp;that quarter. On the 20th of September general&nbsp;Montefquieu entered the territories of Savoy, and was&nbsp;received at Chambery and throughout the whole&nbsp;country with marks of unbounded welcome. On the&nbsp;29th general Anſelm, with another body of troops,&nbsp;took poffeffion of Nice and the conntry around it. On&nbsp;the 30th general Cuſtine advanced to Spires, when he&nbsp;found the Auſtrians drawn up in order of battle. Hc&nbsp;attacked and drove them through the city, taking 3000&nbsp;of them priſoners. The capture of worms ſucceeded&nbsp;that of Spires; Mentz ſurrendered by capitulation; and&nbsp;Franckfort fell into the hands of the French on the 23d.&nbsp;Out of this laſt place, however, they were afterwards&nbsp;driven on the 2d of December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the 20th of September the French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">National Convention</span><span class="font1"> affembled. It was found to contain men of all characters, orders, and ranks. Many diſtinguiſhed&nbsp;members of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Conftituting</span><span class="font1"> Affembly were elected into&nbsp;it, and alſo ſeveral that had belonged to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Legflalive&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Aſſembly ; even foreigners were invited to become&nbsp;French lcgiſſators. The famous Thomas Paine and Dr&nbsp;Prieſtley of England were elected by certain depart-ments ; but the latter declined accepting. Clouts a&nbsp;Pruffian, whom we formerly noticed as bringing a de-putation to the bar of the conſtituent affembly, conſi ſt-ing of perſons repreſenting all the nations of the earth,&nbsp;was alſo choſen. The general aſpect of the new convention ſhowed that the republican party liad acquired a de-cided ſuperiority. On the ſirſt day oſcrneeting M. Collot&nbsp;D’Herbois, who had formerly been an actor, aſcendcd&nbsp;the tribune, and propoſed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the eternal abolition of royalty in France.</span><span class="font1"> The queſtion was carried by acclamation, and the houſe adjourned. Meffages were ſent to&nbsp;all parts of the country to intimate the decree, and by&nbsp;the influence of the Jacobins they were everywhere re-ceived with applauſe. It was next day decreed, that&nbsp;all public acts ſhould be dated by the year of the French&nbsp;republic ; and all citizens were declared eligible to all&nbsp;the vacant offices and places. The rage of republica-niſm ſoon went ſo far, that the ordinary titles of Mon-ſieur and Madame were aboliſhed, and the appellation&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Citizen</span><span class="font1"> ſubſtituted in their ſtead, as more ſuitable to&nbsp;the principles of liberty and equality.— It may be re«=&nbsp;marked, that in this laſt trifling circumſtance an attachment to the form of ſpeech to which they had been&nbsp;accuſtomed appears even in its abolition : For, al-though the Roman orators addreffed their countrymen&nbsp;when affembled by the honourable appellation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Citizens,</span><span class="font1"> yet they never, in accoſting an individual, called&nbsp;him Citizen Cato, or Citizen Cæfar, according to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">mode now </span><span class="font1">adopted in France.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
