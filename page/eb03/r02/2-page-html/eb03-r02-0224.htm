<p><span class="font0">they were come to kill him, being made ſenſible of their intentions, utterly refuſed their offer, alleging his&nbsp;extreme age, and Maximinus’s power. But all his oppoſition was vain : they conſtrained him to accept of&nbsp;the proffered dignity ; and he, with his fon Gordian,&nbsp;who was 46 years of age, were declared emperors. Being thus raiſed contrary to his inclination, the old&nbsp;man immediately wrote to the ſenate, declaring that&nbsp;he had unwillingly accepted of the empire, and would&nbsp;only keep his authority till he had freed it from the&nbsp;tyranny of its preſent oppreffor. The ſenate very joyfully confirmed his electron, adjudging Maximinus as&nbsp;an enemy and traitor to the ſtate. The citizens alſo&nbsp;ſhowed an equal zeal in the cauſe : they flew upon ſuch&nbsp;as were the reputed friends of Maximinus, and tore&nbsp;them in pieces ; even ſome who were innocent ſalling&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">ſacriſice to the multitude’s blind rage. So great an&nbsp;alteration being made in the city againſt the intereſts&nbsp;of Maximinus, the ſenate were reſolved to drive the&nbsp;oppoſition to the extreme ; and accordingly made all&nbsp;neceſſary preparations for their ſecurity, ordering Maximinus’s governors to be diſplaced, and commanding&nbsp;all the provinces to acknowledge Gordian ſor emperor.&nbsp;This order was differently received in different parts, as&nbsp;people were affected to one or the other party : in ſome&nbsp;provinces the governors were ſlain ; in others, the rael-ſengers of the ſenate ; ſo that all parts of the empire felt&nbsp;the conſequences of the civil war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, when Maximinus was informed of theſe charges againſt him, his rage appeared ungovernable. He roared like a ſavage beaſt, and violently ſtruck his head againſt the wall, ſhowing every inſtance of ungovernable diffraction. At length his ſury&nbsp;being ſomewhat ſubiided, he called his whole army together ; and, in a ſet ſpeech, exhorted them to revenge his cauſe, giving them the ſtrongeſt aſſurances&nbsp;that they ſhould poſſeſs the eſtates of all ſuch as had&nbsp;offended. The ſoldiers uuanimouſly promiſed to be&nbsp;faithful ; they received his harangue with their uſual&nbsp;acclamations ; and, thus encouraged, he led them towards Rome, breathing nothing but ſlaughter and revenge. However, he found many obſtacles to his impetuoſity ; and, though he deſired nothing ſo much as&nbsp;diſpatch, his marches were incommodious and flow.&nbsp;The tumultuous and diſobedient armies of the empire&nbsp;were at preſent very different from the legions that&nbsp;were led on by Sylla or Cæſar ; they were loaded with&nbsp;baggage, and followed by ſlaves and women, rather&nbsp;reſembling an eaſtern caravan, than a military battalion. To theſe inconveniences alſo was added the&nbsp;hatred of the cities through which he paſſed, the inhabitants all abandoning their houſes upon his approach, and ſecuring their proviſions in proper hiding-places. However, in this complication of inconveniences and misfortunes, his affairs began to wear a favourable appearance in Africa : for Capelianus, the&nbsp;governor of Numidia, raiſed a body of troops in his&nbsp;favour, and marched againſt Gordian, towards Carthage ; where he fought the younger Gordian, flew&nbsp;him, and deſtroyed his army. The father, hearing of&nbsp;the death of his ſon, together with the loſs of the&nbsp;battle, ſtrangled himſelf in his own girdle. Capelia-nus purſuing his victory, entered Carthage ; where he&nbsp;gave a looſe to pillage and ſlaughter, under a pretence&nbsp;of revenging the cauſe of Maximinus. The news of&nbsp;theſe ſucceſſes was ſoon brought to the emperor, who&nbsp;now increaſed his diligence, and flattered himſelf with&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">ſpeedy opportunity of revenge. He led on his large&nbsp;army by haſty journeys into Italy, threatening deſtruction to all his oppoſers, and ardently wiſhing for freſh&nbsp;opportunities of ſlaughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nothing could exceed the conſternation of the ſenate upon the news of this defeat. They now ſaw themſelves not only deprived of the aſſiſtance of Gordian&nbsp;and his ſon, on whom they greatly relied ; but alſo oppoſed by two formidable tyrants, each commanding a&nbsp;victorious army, directly marching towards Rome, aud&nbsp;meditating nothing but vengeance. In this afflicting&nbsp;exigence, they, with great ſolemnity, met at the temple&nbsp;of Jupiter, and after the moſt mature deliberations,&nbsp;choſe Pupienus and Balbinus emperors conjointly,&nbsp;Theſe were men who had acquired the eſteem of the&nbsp;public both in war and peace, having commanded armies, and governed provinces, with great- reputation ;&nbsp;and being now appointed to oppoſe Maximinus, they&nbsp;made what levies they could, both in Rome and the&nbsp;country. With theſe, Pupienus marched to ſtop the&nbsp;progreſs of the invaders, leaving the city to a freſh and&nbsp;unlooked for calamity. This was occaſioned by two&nbsp;of Maximinus’s ſoldiers, who, entering the ſenate-houſe, were ſlain by two ſenators. This quickly gave&nbsp;offence to the body of the piætorian ſoldiers, who inſtantly reſolved to take revenge, but were oppoſed by&nbsp;the citizens ; ſo that nothing was ſeen throughout&nbsp;Rome, but tumult, ſlaughter, and cruelty. In this univerſal confuſion, the calamity was increaſed by the&nbsp;ſoldiers ſetting the city on fire, while the wretched inhabitants were combating each other in the midſt of&nbsp;the flames.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nevertheleſs, Maximinus himſelf, in whoſe favour theſe ſeditions were promoted, did not ſeem to be&nbsp;more fortunate. Upon being informed of the new&nbsp;election of emperors, his fury was again renewed, and&nbsp;he paſſed the Alps, expecting, upon entering Italy, to&nbsp;refreſh his fatigued and famiſhed army in that fertile&nbsp;part of the country. But in this he was entirely diſappointed ; the ſenate had taken ſuch care to remove&nbsp;all kinds of ſuſtenance to fortified places, that he ſtill&nbsp;found himſelf reduced to his former neceſſities, while his&nbsp;army began to murmur for want. To this another diſappointment was added ſhortly after : for approaching the city of Aquileia, which he expected to enter&nbsp;without any difficulty, he was aſtoniſhed to find ſt&nbsp;prepared for the moſt obſtinate reſiſtance, and reſolved&nbsp;to hold out a regular ſiege. This city was well fortified and populous, and the inhabitants greatly averſe&nbsp;to Maximinus’s government ; but what added ſtill&nbsp;more to its ſtrength, it was commanded by two excellent generals, Criſpinus and Menophilis, who had </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ſo&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">well furniſhed it with men and ammunition, that Maximinus found no ſmall reſiſtance, even in inveſting the&nbsp;place. His firſt attempt was, to take the city by&nbsp;ſtorm ; but the beſieged threw down ſuch quantities of&nbsp;ſcalding pitch and ſulphur upon his ſoldiers, that they&nbsp;were unable to continue the aſſault. He then determined upon a blockade ; but the inhabitants were ſo reſolute, that even the old men and children were ſeen&nbsp;combating upon the walls, while the women cuf off&nbsp;their hair to furniſh the ſoldiers with bow-ſtrings.&nbsp;Maχiminus<sup>,</sup>3 rage at this unexpected oppoſition was&gt;</span></p>
