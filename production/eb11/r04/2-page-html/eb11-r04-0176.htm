<p><span class="font1">part of the town has a Moorish aspect, with narrow, steep and crooked lanes, and still retains some Moorish towers and&nbsp;other medieval buildings. The Ronda bull-ring is one of the&nbsp;finest in Spain, and can accommodate 10,000 spectators.&nbsp;Ronda has a considerable trade in leather, saddlery, horses,&nbsp;soap, flour, chocolate, wine and hats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some remains of an aqueduct and theatre, about 7 m. N. of Ronda, are supposed to represent the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Acinipo</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arunda</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;ancient geographers. Ronda was taken from the Moors in&nbsp;1485. It gives its name to the Sierra or Serrania de Ronda,&nbsp;one of the main sections of the coast mountains which rise&nbsp;between the great plain of Andalusia and the Mediterranean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RONDEAU (Ital. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rondo),</span><span class="font1"> a structural form in poetry and (in the form of “ rondo ”) in music. In poetry the rondeau&nbsp;is a short metrical structure which in its perfect form consists&nbsp;of thirteen eight- or ten-syllabled verses divided into three&nbsp;strophes of unequal length, and knit together by two rhymes&nbsp;and a refrain. In Clement Marot’s time the laws of the rondeau&nbsp;were laid down, and, according to Voiture, in the 17th century,&nbsp;the following was the type of the approved form of the rondeau:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Ma foy, c’est fait de moy, car Isabeau M’a conjuré de luy faire un Rondeau:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cela me met en une peine extreme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Quoy treize vers, huit en </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">eau,</span><span class="font1"> cinq en </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ème.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Je luy ferois aussi-tôt un bateau !</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">En voilà cinq pourtant en un monceau :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Faisons en huict, en invoquant Brodeau,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">En puis mettons, par quelque stratagème,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ma foy, c’est fait !</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Si je pouvois encore de mon cerveau Tirer cinq vers, l’ouvrage seroit beau;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mais cependant, je suis dedans l’onzième,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Et si je croy que je fais le douzième</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">En voilà treize ajustez au niveau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ma foy, c’est fait !”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All forms of the rondeau, however, are alike in this, that the distinguishing metrical emphasis is achieved by </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">peculiar&nbsp;use of the refrain. Though we have a set of rondeaux in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rolliad</span><span class="font1"> (written hy Dr. Lawrence the friend of Burke, according&nbsp;to Edmund Gosse, who has given us an admirable essay upon&nbsp;exotic forms of verse), it was not till recent years that the form&nbsp;had any real vogue in England. Considerable attention, however, has lately been given in England to the form. Some&nbsp;English rondeaux are as bright and graceful as Voiture’s own.&nbsp;Swinburne, who in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Century of Roundels</span><span class="font1"> was perhaps the&nbsp;first to make the refrain rhyme with the second verse of the&nbsp;first strophe, has brought the form into high poetry. In&nbsp;German, rondeaux have been composed with perfect correctness by Weckherlin, and’ with certain divergences from the&nbsp;French type by Gôtz and Fischart; the German name for&nbsp;the form is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rundum</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ringel-gedicht.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although the origin of the retrain in all poetry was no doubt the improvisatore’s need 01 a rest, a time in which to focus&nbsp;his forces and recover breath for future flights, the refrain has&nbsp;a distinct metrical value of its own; it knits the structure&nbsp;together, and so intensifies the emotional energy, as we see in&nbsp;the Border hallads, in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oriana</span><span class="font1"> of Lord Tennyson, and in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sister Helen</span><span class="font1"> of Rossetti. The suggestion of extreme artificiality—of “ difficulty overcome ”—which is one gjeat fault&nbsp;of the rondeau as a vehicle for deep emotion, does not therefore&nbsp;spring from the use of the refrain, but from the too frequent&nbsp;recurrence of the rhymes in the strophes—for which there is&nbsp;no metrical necessity as in the case of the Petrarchan sonnet.&nbsp;The rondeau is, however, an inimitable instrument of gaiety&nbsp;and grace in the hands of a skilful poet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RONDEL, a form of verse closely allied to the rondeau </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.) </span><span class="font1">but distinguished from it by containing fourteen instead of&nbsp;thirteen lines, and by demanding a slightly different arrangement of rhymes. Moreover, the initial couplet is repeated in&nbsp;the middle and again at the close. The arrangement of rhymes&nbsp;is as follows: a, b b, a; a b, a b; a, b, b, a, a, b. This form,&nbsp;which was invented in the 14th century, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">was </span><span class="font1">largely used in&nbsp;later medieval French poetry, but particularly by Charles&nbsp;d’Orléans (1391-1465), the very best of whose graceful creations&nbsp;are all rondels. One of the most famous of this prince’s rondels&nbsp;may be given here as a type of their correct construction:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Le temps a laissié son manteau De vent, de froidure et de pluye,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Et s’est vestu de brouderie De souleil luisant, cler et beau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">11 n’y a beste ne oyseau</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Qu’en son jargon ne chante ou crie:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Le temps a laissié son manteau De vent, de froidure et de pluye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rivière, fontaine et ruisseau Portent, en livrée jolie,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gouttes d’argent d’or faverie;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chascun s’abille de nouveau ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Le temps a laissié son manteau De vent, de froidure et de pluye.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rondel, in French, may begin with either a masculine or a feminine rhyme, hut its solitary other rhyme must he of&nbsp;the opposite kind. The rondel was introduced into English&nbsp;in the 15th century, but the early specimens of it are very&nbsp;clumsy. It was revised in the ;çth century, hut it appears&nbsp;to suit the French better than any other language. Conect&nbsp;examples are found in the poems of Robert Bridges, Dobson,&nbsp;Gosse and Henley. The following, by Austin Dobson, gives an&nbsp;exact impression of what an English rondel should be in all&nbsp;technical respects :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ Love comes back to his vacant dwelling,—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The old, old Love that we knew of yore !</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We see him stand by the open door,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With his great eyes sad, and his bosom swelling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He makes as though in our arms repelling He fain would lie as he lay before ;—.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Love comes back to his vacant dwelling,—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The old, old Love that we knew of yore !</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ah ! who shall help us from over-spelling That sweet, forgotten, forbidden lore ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">E’en as we doubt, in our hearts once more,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With a rush of tears to our eyelids welling,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Love comes back to his vacant dwelling,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The old, old Love that we knew of yore !”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Théodore de Banville remarks that the art of the rondel consists in the gay and natural réintroduction of the refrain, which&nbsp;should always seem inevitable, while slightly changing the&nbsp;point of view of the reader. If this is not successfully achieved,&nbsp;“ on ne fera que de la marqueterie et du placage, c’est-à-dire,&nbsp;en fait de poésie,—rien !” In Germany, the rondel was introduced, in the 18th century, under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ringel-gedicht,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">by Johann Nikolaus Gôtz (1731-1781), and was occasionally&nbsp;used, in the course of the 19th century, by German poets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RONDO, a musical form originally derived from the rondel in verse; as may he seen, long before the development of instrumental forms, in some of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chansons of</span><span class="font1"> Orlando di Lasso.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rondeau en couplets</span><span class="font1"> of Couperin and his contemporaries&nbsp;shows both in name and form the same connexion with verse.&nbsp;It consists of the alternation between a single neatly rounded&nbsp;phrase and several slightly contrasted episodes (the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">couplets)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">without any important change of key. Bach enriched it with&nbsp;his wealth of epigram, but did not expand its range.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The later sense of the term covers an important series of the sonata forms (ç.fl.), chiefly found in finales; but rondo-form&nbsp;sometimes </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">occurs </span><span class="font1">in slow movements (e.g. Mozart, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hafner&nbsp;Serenade,</span><span class="font1"> String Quintet in E flat; Beethoven, Fourth&nbsp;Symphony; Quartet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Op.</span><span class="font1"> 74, &amp;c.). The single-phrase </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ritornello&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and short </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c&amp;uplets</span><span class="font1"> of the old form are in the sonata style&nbsp;replaced by a broadly designed melody and well-contrasted&nbsp;episodes in different keys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the form of a Bach or Couperin rondo may be represented </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">by ABACADA, &amp;c.,</span><span class="font1"> the various forms of the later rondo may&nbsp;be represented somewhat as follows: placing on a horizontal&nbsp;line those parts that are in the main key, and representing other&nbsp;keys by differences of level:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(i) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sectional rondos; i.e.</span><span class="font1"> with little or no development or</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
