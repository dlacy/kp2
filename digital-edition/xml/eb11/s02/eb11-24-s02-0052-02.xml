Guillaume de Saint Yon is cited as the richest butcher of the Grande Boucherie in the 14th century. The family played an important rôle during the quarrels of the Armagnacs and Burgundians. They were among the leaders of the Cabochian revolution of 1413. Driven out by the Armagnacs, they recovered their influence after the return of the Burgundians to Paris in 1418, but had to flee again in 1436 when the constable, Arthur, earl of Richmond, took the city. Garnier de Saint Yon was <hi rend="italic">échevin</hi> of Paris in 1413 and 1419; Jean de Saint Yon, his brother, was <hi rend="italic">valet de chambre</hi> of the dauphin Louis, son of King Charles VI. Both were in the service of the king of England during the English domination. Richard de Saint Yon was master of the butchers of the Grande Boucherie in 1460.</p><p>See A.
