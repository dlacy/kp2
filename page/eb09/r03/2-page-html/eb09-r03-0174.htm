<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> vat, whence it is ladled into barrels ready for the market. Rosin varies in colour, according to the age of the tree&nbsp;whence the turpentine is drawn and the amount of heat&nbsp;applied in distillation, from an opaque almost pitchy&nbsp;black substance through grades of brown and yellow to an&nbsp;almost perfectly transparent colourless glassy mass. The&nbsp;commercial grades are numerous, ranging by letters from&nbsp;A, the darkest, to N, extra pale,—superior to which are W,&nbsp;“ window glass,” and WW, “ water white ” varieties, the&nbsp;latter having about three times the value of the common&nbsp;qualities. Rosin is a very brittle and friable resin, with a&nbsp;faint piny odour, softening at about 176° and melting&nbsp;completely at the temperature of boiling water. It dissolves freely in ether, benzol, and chloroform, and to some&nbsp;extent in alcohol and fatty oils. When exposed to the&nbsp;action of hot dilute alcohol or when boiled with alkaline&nbsp;solutions it takes up a molecule of water and becomes&nbsp;converted into abietic acid, a change which also takes&nbsp;place slowly in the air when the resin is yet mixed with&nbsp;the essential oil as it flows from the trees. Rosin is thus&nbsp;regarded as an anhydride of abietic acid, and its use in&nbsp;yellow soaps is due to the fact that this acid itself combines with caustic alkalies to form a kind of soap. In&nbsp;addition to its extensive use in soap-making, rosin is largely&nbsp;employed in making inferior varnishes, sealing wax, and&nbsp;various cements. It is also used for preparing shoemaker’s&nbsp;wax, for soldering metals, for pitching lager beer casks, for&nbsp;rosining the bows of musical instruments, and numerous&nbsp;minor purposes. In pharmacy it forms an ingredient in&nbsp;several plasters and ointments. On a large scale it is&nbsp;treated by destructive distillation for the production of&nbsp;an oily complex hydrocarbon, having a tarry odour and a&nbsp;whitish opalescent colour, which under the name of rosin&nbsp;oil is much used as a lubricant. Rosin oil also enters&nbsp;extensively into the common kinds of fatty oils as an&nbsp;adulterant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief region of rosin production is the southern coast States of the American Union,—the ports of Wilmington, Charleston,&nbsp;Savannah, and Brunswick being the principal centres of the trade.&nbsp;American rosin is obtained from the turpentine of the swamp pine,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pinus australis,</span><span class="font0"> and of the loblolly pine, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">P. Tæda.</span><span class="font0"> The main&nbsp;source of supply in Europe is the “ landes ” of the departments of&nbsp;Gironde and Landes in France, where the sea pine, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">P. maritima,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is extensively cultivated. In the north of Europe rosin is obtained&nbsp;from the Scotch fir, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">P. sylvestris,</span><span class="font0"> and throughout European&nbsp;countries local supplies are obtained from other species of pine.&nbsp;The imports into the United Kingdom average about 1,250,000&nbsp;cwts. annually, nearly the whole of which comes from America.&nbsp;In 1883 the amount imported was 1,377,368 cwts. (1,337,848&nbsp;cwts. from the United States and 16,242 cwts. from France), the&nbsp;total estimated value of the imports being £400,938.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSMIΝΊ-SERBATI, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Antonio</span><span class="font1"> (1797-1855), perhaps the most important figure in modern Italian philosophy,&nbsp;was born at Rovereto in the Italian Tyrol in 1797, and died&nbsp;in 1855. With every worldly advantage as the eldest son&nbsp;of a noble and wealthy family, from an early age he resolved&nbsp;to devote himself to God’s service in the Catholic priesthood. He became the founder of a new religious order,&nbsp;named the Institute of Charity, but known in Italy generally as the Rosminians. The members may be priests or&nbsp;laymen. All are prepared to do any works of charity—&nbsp;corporal, intellectual, or spiritual—to which they may be&nbsp;directed by divine providence, under obedience to their&nbsp;superior, to the bishops, and to the pope. They have&nbsp;branches in Italy, England, Ireland, France, and America.&nbsp;In London they are attached to the ancient church of St&nbsp;Etheldreda, Ely Place, Holborn, where the English translations of Rosmini’s works are edited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rosmini’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sistema Eilosofico</span><span class="font1"> set forth the conception of a complete encyclopaedia of the human knowable, synthetically conjoined, according to the order of ideas, in a&nbsp;perfectly harmonious whole. This conception Rosmini&nbsp;developed in more than forty volumes. Here a brief&nbsp;notice of the characteristic principle of his philosophy must&nbsp;suffice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rosmini, contemplating the position of recent philosophy from Locke to Hegel, and having his eye directed to the&nbsp;ancient and fundamental problem of the origin, truth, and&nbsp;certainty of our ideas, wrote:—“If philosophy is to be&nbsp;restored to love and respect, I think it will be necessary,&nbsp;in part, to return to the teachings of the ancients, and in&nbsp;part to give those teachings the benefit of modern methods ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Theodicy,</span><span class="font1"> n. 148). Pursuing therefore the now generally&nbsp;approved method of the observation of facts, he most&nbsp;carefully examined and analysed the fact of human knowledge, and obtained the following results :—(1) that the&nbsp;notion or idea of being or existence in general enters into,&nbsp;and is presupposed by, all our acquired cognitions, so that,&nbsp;without it, they would be impossible ; (2) that this idea is&nbsp;essentially objective, inasmuch as what is seen in it is as&nbsp;distinct from and opposed to the mind that sees it as the&nbsp;light is from the eye that looks at it ; (3) that it is&nbsp;essentially true, because “being’’and “truth” are convertible terms, and because in the vision of it the mind cannot&nbsp;err, since error could only be committed by a judgment,&nbsp;and here there is no judgment, but a pure intuition&nbsp;affirming nothing and denying nothing ; (4) that by the&nbsp;application of this essentially objective and true idea the&nbsp;human being intellectually perceives, first, the animal body&nbsp;individually conjoined with him, and then, on occasion of&nbsp;the sensations produced in him </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">not by himself,</span><span class="font1"> the causes&nbsp;of those sensations, that is, from the action felt he perceives and affirms an agent, a being, and therefore a true&nbsp;thing, that acts on him, and he thus gets at the external&nbsp;world,—these are the true primitive judgments, containing (α) the subsistence of the particular being (subject),&nbsp;and (5) its essence or species as determined by the quality&nbsp;of the action felt from it (predicate) ; (5) that reflexion,&nbsp;by separating the essence or species from the subsistence,&nbsp;obtains the full specific idea (universalization), and then&nbsp;from this, by leaving aside some of its elements, the&nbsp;abstract specific idea (abstraction) ; (6) that the mind,&nbsp;having reached this stage of development, can proceed to&nbsp;further and further abstracts, including the first principles&nbsp;of reasoning, the principles of the several sciences, complex&nbsp;ideas, groups of ideas, and so on without end ; (7) finally,&nbsp;that the same most universal idea of being, this generator&nbsp;and formal element of all acquired cognitions, cannot&nbsp;itself be acquired, but must be innate in us, implanted by&nbsp;God in our nature. Being, as naturally shining to our&nbsp;mind, must therefore be what men call the light of reason.&nbsp;Hence the name Rosmini gives it of ideal being ; and this&nbsp;he laid down as the one true fundamental principle of all&nbsp;philosophy, and the supreme criterion of truth and&nbsp;certainty. This he firmly believed to be the teaching of&nbsp;St Augustine, as well as of St Thomas, of whom he was&nbsp;an ardent admirer and defender. The above seven points&nbsp;could only be hinted at here. A complete and exhaustive&nbsp;treatment of them will be found in Rosmini’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hew Essay&nbsp;on the Origin of Ideas,</span><span class="font1"> which has lately been rendered&nbsp;into English (London, 1883-84).</span></p>
