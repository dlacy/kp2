<p><span class="font0">the other hand, as Jansen pointed out, free-will tends to make the average man’s estimate of his own powers into the supreme&nbsp;criterion of all that is good and right. God must perforce be&nbsp;satisfied with whatever common sense thinks it fair and&nbsp;reasonable that He should expect. Jansen accordingly denounced free-will as dishonouring to God, and destructive of&nbsp;the higher interests of morab’ty. But, if men threw over&nbsp;common sense, what was to be their guide in life? Jansen&nbsp;answered with his doctrine of Irresistible Grace. This was&nbsp;simply a cumbrous way of saying that God awakens in the&nbsp;righteous heart an intuitive faculty of discerning right from&nbsp;wrong. “ This holy taste or relish, ” says a follower of Jansen,&nbsp;“ distinguishes between good and evil without being at the&nbsp;trouble of a train of reasoning; just as the nature and tendency&nbsp;of a heavy body, let fall from a height, shows the way to the&nbsp;centre of the earth more exactly in a moment than the ablest&nbsp;mathematician could determine by his most accurate observations in a whole day.” That being so, the Jansenist obeyed&nbsp;his Inner Light, and paid little heed to the earth-bound&nbsp;standards of unregenerate common sense. Nor was he much&nbsp;more respectful towards the official standards of the Church.&nbsp;Why should he consult a casuist rather than his Inner Light?&nbsp;Thus the Jesuits saw themselves menaced by a grave revolt.&nbsp;What would become of the confessional if penitents were&nbsp;allowed to act on what they fondly took to be a heaven-sent&nbsp;inspiration? In a twinkling they would be off to some&nbsp;spiritual Wonderland, where no confessor could bring them to&nbsp;book. On the other hand, only preach to them a strong&nbsp;doctrine of free-will, and all these dangers vanished. They&nbsp;would feel bound to disregard their sporadic intuitions, and&nbsp;act only for reasons that would be clearly set out in black&nbsp;and white. Thcir past performances could then be checked,&nbsp;and their future actions forecast by the priest; and there&nbsp;was small danger of their straying beyond the limits marked&nbsp;out by authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus within the spiritual sphere free-will led up to Jesuit obedience. But in the secular world this paradox failed to&nbsp;obtain; there free-will was only too ready to come into&nbsp;conflict with the Church. The 15th and 16th centuries had&nbsp;seen the final break-up of the medieval system of reverence&nbsp;for authority and tradition. In art and learning, morals and&nbsp;government, the old walls came crashing down; in the general&nbsp;bankruptcy of authority men were forced to depend on themselves. And the contemporaries of Machiavelli soon learned&nbsp;to take the fullest advantage of this liberty to pursue their&nbsp;own best interests in the way that pleased them best. But&nbsp;if individuals might be guided by self-interest, why should&nbsp;that privilege be denied to associations of men? On the&nbsp;ruins of a medieval Christendom, hierarchically&nbsp;organized under the pope, grew up the “ new monarchy, ” or modern state, owning no law but its&nbsp;own will. Yet the popes laid aside none of their&nbsp;medieval claims, or even their traditional weapons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1606 Paul V. laid Venice under an interdict, on the ground that the republic had infringed the immunities of the&nbsp;clergy; the doge replied by threatening with death any one&nbsp;who took any notice of the papal thunders. Thenceforward&nbsp;the thunders continued chiefly on paper. In 1625 Catholic&nbsp;Europe was scandalized by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Schismate</span><span class="font0"> of thc Jesuit&nbsp;Santarelli, in which he claimed for the pope an absolute&nbsp;right to interfere in the concerns of secuIar. princes, whenever&nbsp;he chose to declare that the interests of religion were in any&nbsp;way concerned. He could dictate their policy at home and&nbsp;abroad, revise their statute-book, upset the decisions of their&nbsp;law-courts. If they refused to listen he could punish them&nbsp;in any manner he thought fit; in the last resort he could&nbsp;release their subjects from allegiance and head a crusade of&nbsp;Catholic powers against them. These pretensions roused a&nbsp;special burst of indignation in France. There, on the divisions&nbsp;of the wars of religion, had followed an irresistible reaction&nbsp;towards patriotism and national unity. France had suddenly&nbsp;grown to her full stature; like the contemporary England&nbsp;of John Milton, she was become a “ noble and puissant nation,&nbsp;rousing herself like a strong man after sleep.” Even thc&nbsp;clergy were swept away by the current, and meant to be&nbsp;patriots like every one else. “ Before my ordination, ” said&nbsp;the eminent theologian Edmond Richer, “ I was a subject of&nbsp;the king of France: why should that ceremony make me a&nbsp;subject of the pope? ” Subjection to the pope impb'cd an&nbsp;Italianization of French religion; and most Frcnchmcn looked&nbsp;on the Italians as an inferior race. Why, then, should the&nbsp;right to decide ecclesiastical disputes be taken away from&nbsp;their own highly competent fellow-countrymen, and reserved&nbsp;for a set of incapable judges in a foreign land? Germany and&nbsp;Spain might let themselves be bitted and bridled iI they&nbsp;chose, but for centuries France had prided herself that, thanks&nbsp;to her Gallican liberties, she stood on a different footing towards&nbsp;Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Liberties in question were certain ancient rights, whose origin was lost in thc mists of time. One forbade paDal bulls&nbsp;to be published in France without the consent of&nbsp;the crown. Another exempted French subjects from&nbsp;thc jurisdiction of the Inquisition and other Roman&nbsp;tribunals—such as the Index of Prohibited Books. In the&nbsp;17th century such immunities were all thc more valuable since&nbsp;French statesmen found themselves in an awkward position.&nbsp;The great aim of Henry IV. and Richelieu was to exalt France&nbsp;at the expense of Vienna and Madrid. But Madrid and Vienna&nbsp;were the official champions of the papacy; hence to make war&nbsp;on them was indirectly to make war on the* pope. This was&nbsp;enough to trouble the consciences of many excellent men;&nbsp;and it became necessary to devise a compromise that should&nbsp;set their minds at rest, by showing them that they could be&nbsp;at once good citizens and good Catholics. This compromise&nbsp;is known as Gallicanism. In the hands of Bossuet and other&nbsp;eminent divines it was developed along both theological and&nbsp;political lines. Theological Gallicanism refused to recognize&nbsp;papal decisions on questions of doctrine, until they had been&nbsp;ratified by the bishops of France. Political Gallicanism maintained that lawful sovereigns held their power directly of God,&nbsp;and not mediately through the pope. Hence no amount of&nbsp;misgovernment, or neglect of CathoHc interests, could justify&nbsp;Rome in interfering with them. In other words, Bossuet only&nbsp;answered Santarelli by setting up the divine right of kings.&nbsp;However, this dogma by no means scandalized the subjects of&nbsp;Louis XIV., for the worship of thc sovereign was one of their&nbsp;most cherished instincts. And Louis’s ecclesiastical policy&nbsp;flattered their national pride. He introduced no theological&nbsp;novelties; all he did was to insist that, in matters of administration, he would be master in his own house. He supported&nbsp;pope and bishops so long as they took their marching orders&nbsp;from him. If they refused he was perfectly ready to make war&nbsp;on the one and send the others to thc Bastille. It is eminently&nbsp;characteristic of his methods that, just at the same time as&nbsp;he was turning loose dragoons on his Protestant subjects after&nbsp;the revocation of the edict of Nantes (1685), he was employing&nbsp;other dragoons to invade the papal territory at Avignon, to&nbsp;punish Innocent XI. for'having refused institution to some of&nbsp;his nominees to bishoprics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The revocation of the edict of Nantes owes quite as much to the dream of political absolutism, inherited from Richelieu,&nbsp;as to religious bigotry. In thc words of Saint-Simon, thc&nbsp;Huguenots were “ a sect that had become a state within the&nbsp;state, dependent on the king no more than it chose, and ready&nbsp;on the sUghtest pretext to embroil the whole country by an&nbsp;appeal to arms.” So long as they were powerful, thc crown&nbsp;had treated with them; but when once their power began to&nbsp;dwindle, it was certain that the crown would crush them. But&nbsp;during Louis’s latter years, when thc War of the Spanish&nbsp;Succession had brought a rain of disasters thickly upon him,&nbsp;bigotry got thc upper hand. Thc broken old man became&nbsp;feverishly anxious to propitiate offended Heaven, and save&nbsp;himself another Blenheim or Malplaquct, by exterminating the&nbsp;enemies of the Church. And his Jesuit confessors had no doubt</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
