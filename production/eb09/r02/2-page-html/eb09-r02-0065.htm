<p><span class="font1">the occupation of his mere bye hours and times of leisure. The main effort of his life was directed to painting, a pursuit which, as he was&nbsp;never weary of impressing on younger artists, was enough to occupy&nbsp;a man’s whole time, even were it longer than it is, and to call forth&nbsp;his utmost energy. The unceasing application, perseverance, and&nbsp;assiduity which form the recurrent burden of Reynold’s discourses&nbsp;found the most complete illustration in his own career. He laid&nbsp;it down as a distinct principle that each fresh portrait to which&nbsp;he set his hand should excel the last, and no effort was wanting&nbsp;to realize this aim. In his search for perfection he would paint&nbsp;and repaint a subject ; when a visitor asked how a certain portion&nbsp;of the infant Hercules had been executed, he replied, “ How can 1&nbsp;tell ! There are ten pictures below this, some better, some worse.”&nbsp;A method like this contrasts curiously with the swift certainty of&nbsp;Gainsborough’s practice, but it must be confessed that the productions of Reynolds have an abiding charm that is wanting in the&nbsp;exquisite but slighter and more mannered work of his great rival.&nbsp;In range, too, of subject, as well as of method, the art of Sir Joshua&nbsp;has by far the wider reach. “ How various the man is, ” said&nbsp;Gainsborough once, after he had been examining the president’s&nbsp;portraits hung in an Academy exhibition ; and the remark gains&nbsp;an added point and emphasis when we compare the paintings of&nbsp;Reynolds with Gainsborough’s own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the work which the painter produced shortly after his return from Italy—in the Lady Cathcart and her Daughter of 1755, the&nbsp;Lady Elizabeth Montague and the George, Earl of λVarwick, of&nbsp;1756, and the Countess of Hyndford of 1757—we find a certain&nbsp;dignity and elegance of pose and arrangement which bears witness&nbsp;to his foreign studies, joined to some coldness of colour, hardness&nbsp;of execution, and insistance on definiteness of outline, which contrasts with the sweet felicity and tenderness of his fully developed&nbsp;manner, with its perfect colour, and its form which is lost and&nbsp;found again in an exquisite mystery. But soon all that is tentative and immature disappears from his works. In 1758 we have&nbsp;the gracious and winning full-length of Elizabeth Gunning,&nbsp;Duchess of Hamilton, and the stately Duke of Cumberland, followed&nbsp;in 1760 by the Kitty Fisher, and a host of admirable portraits in&nbsp;which the men and women and children of the time live still before&nbsp;our eyes, each possessed with a nameless dignity, or grace, or&nbsp;sweetness. As the artist advanced towards old age his hand only&nbsp;gained in power, his colour in richness and splendour ; his&nbsp;works show no decadence till the day when he finally laid aside his&nbsp;brush. We have nothing finer from his hand than the Mrs Nesbitt&nbsp;as Circe of 1781, the Mrs Siddons as The Tragic Muse of 1784, the&nbsp;Duches3 of Devonshire and her Child of 1786, and the Infant&nbsp;Hercules and the Miss Gawtkin as Simplicity of 1788.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the midst of his constant practice as a portrait-painter Reynolds was true to his early admiration of “the grand style,”&nbsp;to his veneration for the old masters of Italy, to his belief that the&nbsp;imaginative paths which these men pursued were the highest ways&nbsp;of art. At the conclusion of his last Academy discourse, while&nbsp;speaking of Michelangelo, he breaks forth with uncontrollable&nbsp;emotion, “Were I now to begin the world again, I would tread&nbsp;in the steps of that great master ; to kiss the hem of his garment,&nbsp;to catch the slightest of his perfections, would be glory and distinction enough for an ambitious man.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the Italians Reynolds conveyed into his own portrait-subjects a dignity and a grace, along with a power of colour, which were previously unknown in English art ; but he essayed also to&nbsp;follow them into their own exalted and imaginative paths, to paint&nbsp;Holy Families and Nativities, to picture the cardinal virtues, and&nbsp;to realize the conceptions of the poets. But the English portrait-painter wanted the visionary power necessary for such tasks ; his&nbsp;productions of this class form the least interesting portion of his&nbsp;work. They are most successful when the symbolism and the&nbsp;allegory in them are of the slightest, when the human element is&nbsp;the main attraction, when he paints as cherub faces five different&nbsp;views of the countenance of one living English girl, or titles as&nbsp;“Simplicity” his portrait of Offy Gawtkin or as “Hebe” his&nbsp;portrait of Miss Meyer. His series of “ The Virtues,” designed for&nbsp;the window of New College, Oxford, show simply studies of graceful women, lightly draped, and pleasantly posed. His Macbeth&nbsp;and his Cardinal Beaufort have no real impressiveness, no true&nbsp;terror ; and the finest of the subjects that he painted forBoydell’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shakespeare</span><span class="font1"> is the Puck, in which the artist’s inspiration was&nbsp;caught, not from the realms of imagination or fancy, but from&nbsp;observation of the child nature which he knew and loved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Much has been said regarding the recklessness and want of care for permanency which characterized the technical methods of Sir&nbsp;Joshua. While he insisted that his pupils should follow only such&nbsp;ways of work as were well known and had been tested by time, he&nbsp;was himself most varying and unsettled in his practice. In his&nbsp;earnest desire for excellence he tried all known processes, and made&nbsp;all kinds of fantastic experiments. He was firmly convinced that&nbsp;the old masters were possessed of technical secrets which had been&nbsp;lost in later times, and he even scraped the surfaces from portions&nbsp;of valuable works by Titian and Rubens in the vain attempt to&nbsp;probe the mystery. In his efforts to attain the utmost possible&nbsp;power and brilliancy of hue he made use of pigments which are&nbsp;admittedly the reverse of stable and permanent, he worked with&nbsp;dangerous vehicles, he employed both colours and varnishes which&nbsp;in combination are antagonistic. Orpiment was mingled with&nbsp;white lead ; wax-medium, egg-varnish, and asphaltum were freely&nbsp;used ; and, when we read the account of his strangely hap-hazard&nbsp;methods, we are ready to echo Haydon’s exclamation—“The&nbsp;wonder is that the picture did not crack beneath the brush !” and&nbsp;are prepared for such a sight of the vanishing ghosts of masterpieces as was afforded by so many works in the Reynolds Exhibition&nbsp;at the Grosvenor Gallery in 1884. Our only consolation lies in&nbsp;the truth expressed by Sir George Beaumont, when his recommendation of Sir Joshua for the execution of a certain work was met&nbsp;by the objection that his colours faded, that he “ made his pictures&nbsp;die before the man.” “Never mind,” said Sir George, “ a faded&nbsp;portrait by Reynolds is better than a fresh one by anybody else.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RHADAMANTHUS, in Greek mythology, a son of Zeus and Europa and brother of Minos, king of Crete. At first&nbsp;he helped his brother to rule his island empire. His justice&nbsp;earned him the admiration of his subjects and the jealousy&nbsp;of his brother, wherefore he fled to Bœotia, where he wedded&nbsp;Alcmene. On account of his inflexible integrity he was&nbsp;made one of the judges of the dead in the other world.&nbsp;According to Plato, Rhadamanthus judged the souls of&nbsp;Asiatics, while Æacus judged those of Europeans, and&nbsp;when they could not agree Minos had a casting vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RHÆTIA was the name given in ancient times to a province of the Roman empire, which included a considerable tract of the Alpine regions that separated the great&nbsp;valleys of the Po and the Danube, comprising the districts&nbsp;occupied in modern times by the Grisons and the Austrian&nbsp;province of Tyrol. Before their subjugation by Rome the&nbsp;Rhætians are described as one of the most powerful and&nbsp;warlike of the Alpine tribes; but little or nothing is known&nbsp;as to their origin and history. It is indeed stated distinctly&nbsp;by Livy (v. 33) that they were of Etruscan origin, and a&nbsp;tradition reported by Justin (xx. 5) and Pliny (∕∕.A<sup>r</sup>., iii.&nbsp;24, 133) affirmed that they were a portion of that people&nbsp;who had been settled in the plains of the Po and were&nbsp;driven into the mountains by the irruption of the Gauls,&nbsp;when they assumed the name of Rhætians from a leader&nbsp;of the name of Rhætus. Very little value can, however, be&nbsp;attached to such traditions, and the attempts of some&nbsp;modern writers to support them by philological researches&nbsp;have led to no satisfactory result. But the ethnical&nbsp;connexion of the Rhætians with the Etruscans has been&nbsp;accepted by Niebuhr, and its general reception by the&nbsp;Romans would seem to prove that they were a distinct&nbsp;race from their neighbours the Ligurians as well as from&nbsp;the Gauls and Germans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The name of the Rhætians is first mentioned by Polybius, but merely incidentally, and they played no part&nbsp;in Roman history till after the fall of the republic. It is&nbsp;certain, however, that they continued virtually independent&nbsp;until Augustus undertook their subjugation, in common&nbsp;with that of the neighbouring Alpine tribes bordering upon&nbsp;Italy. The importance he attached to this task is shown&nbsp;by his having deputed its execution to his two step-sons,&nbsp;Drusus and Tiberius, who in a single campaign reduced&nbsp;them all to subjection (15 B.c.), so that their territory was&nbsp;shortly after incorporated as a province in the Roman&nbsp;empire and their name never again appears in history.&nbsp;The exploits of the imperial youths on this occasion have&nbsp;been immortalized in two well-known odes of Horace </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Od.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">iv. 4 and 14). In the time of Strabo their territory was&nbsp;considered as extending from the Lakes of Como and Garda&nbsp;to that of Constance (the Lacus Brigantinus), while the&nbsp;allied people of the Vindelici, who had shared in their</span></p>
