<p><span class="font1">were elected in it, and its resolutions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(plebiscita)</span><span class="font1"> became directly binding on plebeians. The XII. Tables, twenty years later,&nbsp;were the fruit of the agitation of the plebeians for a revision&nbsp;and written embodiment of the law. In 449 plebiscita were—&nbsp;subject presumably to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auctoritas pair urn—</span><span class="font1">declared by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex&nbsp;Valeria-Horatia</span><span class="font1"> binding on the whole </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">populus,</span><span class="font1"> while about&nbsp;the same time, or perhaps a little earlier, the patrician-plebeian&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comilia</span><span class="font1"> of the tribes was instituted.<sup>@@1</sup> By the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Canuleia</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;445 b.c. intermarriage between patricians and plebeians was&nbsp;sanctioned. Repeated protests by the plebeians against the&nbsp;monopolization of the public domain land by members of the&nbsp;higher order resulted in the definite admission of their right to&nbsp;participate in its occupation by one of the Licinian laws of&nbsp;367 </span><span class="font0">B.c. </span><span class="font1">The long course of cruel oppression of insolvents&nbsp;(mainly plebeians) by their patrician creditors was put an end&nbsp;to by the Poetilian law about 326 b.c., depriving nexal contract&nbsp;of its privileges and generally prohibiting the use of chains&nbsp;and fetters on persons incarcerated for purely civil debt. By&nbsp;the Hortensian law of about 287 b.c. plebiscita w<sup>T</sup>ere declared&nbsp;binding (presumably without </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auctoritas pair urn)</span><span class="font1"> on the whole&nbsp;body of citizens. And from 421 b.c., when one of their number&nbsp;first reached the regular state magistracy as quaestor, down to&nbsp;252 b.c., when one was elected </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pontifex maximus,</span><span class="font1"> the plebeians&nbsp;gradually vindicated their right as citizens to share in all the&nbsp;honours of the state. There is also evidence that plebeians&nbsp;were early in the Republic admitted to the senate and also to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia euriata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The legislative bodies during the present period were thus three in number: the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> of the centuries, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium&nbsp;plebis</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia tributa.</span><span class="font1"> As to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;the curies, it seems to have hardly concerned itself&nbsp;with general legislation, but met merely to confer&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font1"> on the higher magistrates and to sanction testaments&nbsp;and adrogations of the gentiles. The legislation of the centuries&nbsp;dealt for the most part (though the XII. Tables were enacted&nbsp;by it) with questions affecting public and constitutional rather&nbsp;than private interests. It could be convened only by a magistrate having military </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">imperium, i.e.</span><span class="font1"> at first only the consuls,&nbsp;for the reason that it was theoretically a military assembly&nbsp;met for civil purposes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(exercitus civilis).</span><span class="font1"> It is called in the&nbsp;XII. Tables </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitiatus maximus.</span><span class="font1"> Its procedure was cumbrous&nbsp;and ill-adapted for legislation. As to the relation of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium plebis</span><span class="font1"> to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia tributa</span><span class="font1"> there is much controversy.&nbsp;The old opinion which identified them is now generally abandoned. According to Mommsen<sup>@@2</sup> they differed in the following&nbsp;points: (1) The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> was an assembly of the whole people&nbsp;voting in tribes instead of centuries, while the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;an assembly of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font1"> alone; (2) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> was always&nbsp;convoked and presided over by a patrician magistrate (often&nbsp;the praetor), while the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">conciliitm</span><span class="font1"> had to be convoked and presided over by a plebeian official (usually a tribune); (3) in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> auspices had to be taken beforehand, but not in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium-</span><span class="font1"> (4) an enactment of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> was a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex</span><span class="font1"> binding&nbsp;on all the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">populus,</span><span class="font1"> while an enactment of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium</span><span class="font1"> was a&nbsp;plebiscitum binding only on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs.</span><span class="font1"> It is, however, not&nbsp;possible to take Mommsen’s view that plebiscita were not&nbsp;binding on the whole </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">populus</span><span class="font1"> prior to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Horlensia,</span><span class="font1"> without&nbsp;disregarding distinct statements of Livy as to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Valeria-Horatia</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Publilia.<sup>@@3 </sup></span><span class="font1">But whatever the relation of&nbsp;these two legislative assemblies to each other may have been&nbsp;originally, it is certain that the Hortensian law equalized them&nbsp;so far as their effects were concerned, and, looking to the small&nbsp;number of patricians compared with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font1">, it would probably be a matter of indifference in which assembly the vote&nbsp;was taken. The greater part of the legislation dealing&nbsp;with the private law in the later Republic consisted of&nbsp;plebiscita.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">ii. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The XII. Tables.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Causes of their Enactment.—</span><span class="font1">The change from monarchy to republic brought of itself no benefit to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs,</span><span class="font1"> but rather&nbsp;the reverse. One of their chief complaints was against the&nbsp;administration of justice. They complained that they were&nbsp;kept in ignorance of the laws, and that in particular the consuls&nbsp;used their magisterial punitive powers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(cocrcitio)</span><span class="font1"> unfairly and&nbsp;with undue severity when a plebeian was the object of them.&nbsp;The state of matters gradually became so intolerable that in&nbsp;the year 462 </span><span class="font0">B.c., </span><span class="font1">according to the ancient tradition, a proposal&nbsp;for a statute was made by C. Terentilius Arsa, one of the&nbsp;tribunes, by which a commission should be appointed to draw&nbsp;up a code of laws in writing. He carried a rogation in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">concilium plebis</span><span class="font1"> to this effect. The senate at first strenuously&nbsp;resisted, but after a few years was induced to give way, and&nbsp;its assent to the proposal w<sup>T</sup>as obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tradition records that the first practical step towards its realization was the despatch of a mission to Athens, to study&nbsp;the laws of Solon and collect any materials that&nbsp;might be of service in preparing the projected code.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the return of the commissioners in 452 b.c.</span><span class="font0"> all </span><span class="font1">the magistracies were suspended, and a body of ten&nbsp;patricians, called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">decemviri legibus scribundis,</span><span class="font1"> was appointed&nbsp;with consular powers, under the presidency of Appius Claudius,&nbsp;for the express purpose of putting the laws into shape. Before&nbsp;the end of the ensuing year (451) the bulk of the code was&nbsp;ready and was at once passed into law by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> of the&nbsp;centuries and published on ten tables (whether of brass or wood&nbsp;is doubtful), which were set up in the Forum. Next year,&nbsp;owing to additions being found necessary, the dccemvirate was&nbsp;renewed, with, however, a change of membership (some plebeians&nbsp;being chosen), and in the course of a few months it had completed the supplemental matter. On the downfall of the&nbsp;decemvirate, these new laws, after being duly accepted by&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia,</span><span class="font1"> were published on two other tables, thus bringing&nbsp;the number up to twelve. The code then received the official&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lex XII. Tabularum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The foregoing account of the enactment of the Tables is an attempt to summarize what is stated by Livy and other Roman&nbsp;writers on the subject. Though inconsistent and&nbsp;sometimes even contradictory about details, these&nbsp;writers are on the main facts in concordance. Until a&nbsp;few years ago, the fact of the publication of such a code about&nbsp;the date above given bad been accepted by modern historians,&nbsp;even the most iconoclastic, without question; unlike the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leges regiae,</span><span class="font1"> the XII. Tables had always been regarded as&nbsp;authentic. But in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Rome,</span><span class="font1"> published in 1898,&nbsp;Professor Pais of Turin<sup>@@4</sup> emitted the view that the decemviral&nbsp;code was really a private compilation made about the year&nbsp;304 </span><span class="font0">B.C. </span><span class="font1">by Cn. Flavius, the scribe of Appius Claudius the&nbsp;censor, and probably at the latter’s instigation; or, in other&nbsp;words, that it was just the so-called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jus Flavianum</span><span class="font1"> which all&nbsp;writers had hitherto regarded as a work dealing with the styles&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis aciiones</span><span class="font1"> and the calendar of court days. In Pais’s&nbsp;view the annalists, in accordance with a habit of theirs, duplicated the same event by counterfeiting an earlier Appius&nbsp;Claudius, &amp;c., in order to magnify the antiquity and authority&nbsp;of the laws collected by Flavius, while the whole account of&nbsp;the decemviral legislation was invented by them. More recently&nbsp;Professor Lambert of Lyons has attempted by similar arguments&nbsp;to prove that the XII. Tables were a private compilation of&nbsp;customs already in observance, and of sacerdotal and other&nbsp;rules already in circulation, made about 197 b.c. by the jurist&nbsp;Aelius Paetus, and were in fact identical with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tripcrtita</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;./«s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aelianum,</span><span class="font1"> which had always heretofore been supposed to&nbsp;contain merely a recension of the Tables with an interpretation&nbsp;and commentary.<sup>@@5</sup>This is not the place to discuss these theories.&nbsp;Though of course incapable of positive disproof, the weight</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> There is diversity of opinion about this. Mommsen thinks the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia tributa</span><span class="font1"> was earlier than the XII. Tables, and that the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lex Valeria-IIoratia</span><span class="font1"> applied to it. See next note.</span></p>
