                a good position to obtain information, for the Mont St&nbsp;Michel was one of the
                four great centres of pilgrimage in Europe.&nbsp;But he was excessively timid and
                cautious, and hardly mentions&nbsp;events, like the murder of Becket, which were
                subjects of controversy. Besides, his style is that of the driest annalist. It
                is&nbsp;for continental affairs between 1154 and 1170 that his information is
                especially valuable. His notices of English affairs are&nbsp;slight and sometimes
                misleading.</span></p>

        <p><span class="font0">ROBERT THE DEVIL, hero of romance. He was the son of a duke and
                duchess of Normandy, and by the time he was&nbsp;twenty was a prodigy of strength,
                which he used, however,&nbsp;only for outrage and crime. At last he learnt from his
                mother,&nbsp;in explanation of his wicked impulses, that he was born in&nbsp;answer
                to prayers addressed to the devil. He was directed by&nbsp;the pope to a hermit, who
                imposed on him by way of penance&nbsp;that he should maintain absolute silence,
                feign madness,&nbsp;take his food from the mouth of a dog, and provoke ill-treatment
                from the common people without retaliating. He became&nbsp;court fool to the emperor
                at Rome, and delivered the city from&nbsp;Saracen invasions in three successive
                years in the guise of an&nbsp;unknown knight, having each time been bidden to fight
                by a&nbsp;celestial messenger. The emperor’s dumb daughter recovered&nbsp;speech to
                declare the identity of the court fool with the deliverer&nbsp;of the city, but
                Robert refused the hand of the princess and the&nbsp;imperial inheritance, and ended
                his days in the hermitage of&nbsp;his old confessor.</span></p>

                oldest versions of the legend, and differs in detail from the popular&nbsp;tales
                printed in the 15th and 16th centuries. It was apparently&nbsp;founded on folk-lore,
                not on the wickedness of Robert Guiscard&nbsp;or any historical personage; but
                probably the name of Robert&nbsp;and the localization of the legend may be put down
                to the&nbsp;terror inspired by the Normans. In the English version the&nbsp;hero is
                called Sir Gowther, and the scene is laid in Germany.&nbsp;This metrical romance
                dates from the beginning of the 15th&nbsp;century, and is based, according to its
                author, on a Breton lay.&nbsp;The legend had undergone much change before it was

                said by Richerus to have been the son of a&nbsp;certain Witichin, but nothing
                definite is known about his&nbsp;parentage or early life. Quickly attaining a
                prominent position&nbsp;among the Frankish nobles, he appears as rector of the
                abbey&nbsp;of Marmoutier in 852, and as one of Charles the Bald’s </span><span

                class="font0"> in 853; but soon afterwards he was among those&nbsp;who rebelled
                against Charles, and invited the king’s half-brother, Louis the German, to invade
                West Francia. However, after the peace between Charles and Louis in 860
                Robert&nbsp;came to terms with his sovereign, who made him count of&nbsp;Anjou and
                of Blois, and entrusted him with the defence of&nbsp;that part of his kingdom which
                lay between the Seine and the&nbsp;Loire, a district which had suffered greatly from
                the ravages&nbsp;of the Normans and the Bretons. By his conduct in
                many&nbsp;stubborn fights with these.foes, Robert thoroughly earned his&nbsp;surname
                and gained the confidence of the king, who gave him&nbsp;the counties of Nevers and
                Auxerre. He was killed in battle&nbsp;at Brissarthe in October 866, leaving two
                sons, Odo, or Eudes,&nbsp;and Robert, both of whom became kings of the Franks.
                Robert&nbsp;has been compared to the Maccabees, and the fact that he&nbsp;was the
                ancestor of the Capetian kings of France has invested&nbsp;him with historical
                importance.</span></p>

                deserves to be remembered not so much for his&nbsp;skill as a painter as for the
                liveliness and point with which he&nbsp;treated the subjects he painted. The
                contrast between the&nbsp;ruins of ancient Rome and the life of his time excited
                his&nbsp;keenest interest; and, although he had started for Italy on&nbsp;his own
                responsibility, the credit he there acquired procured&nbsp;him the protection of the
                minister Marigny and an OfficiaI&nbsp;allowance. His incessant activity as an
                artist, his daring&nbsp;character, his many adventures, attracted general
                sympathy&nbsp;and admiration. In the fourth canto of his </span><span class="font0"

                fatal accident another&nbsp;died in his place and Robert lived. The quantity of his
                work&nbsp;is immense; the Louvre alone contains nine paintings by his&nbsp;hand and
                specimens are frequently to be met with in provincial&nbsp;museums and private
                collections. Robert’s work has more&nbsp;or less of that scenic character which
                justified his selection by&nbsp;Voltaire to paint the decorations of his theatre at
                Ferney.&nbsp;Robert died of apoplexy on the 15th of April 1808. His work
                was&nbsp;much engraved by the abbé Le Non, with whom he had visited&nbsp;Naples in
                the company of Fragonard during his early days;&nbsp;in Italy his work has also been

        <p><span class="font0">ROBERT, LOUIS LÉOPOLD ( 1794-1835), French painter, was born at Chaux
                de Fonds (Neuchâtel) in Switzerland on&nbsp;the 13th of May 1794, but left his
                native place with the engraver&nbsp;Girardet at the age of sixteen for Paris. He was
                on the eve&nbsp;of obtaining the </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">grand prix</span><span class="font0"> for engraving when
                the events of&nbsp;1815 blasted his hopes, for Neuchâtel was restored to
                Prussia,&nbsp;and Robert was struck off the list of competitors as a
                foreigner.&nbsp;Whilst continuing his studies under Girardet he had
                never&nbsp;ceased to frequent the studio of David, and he now determined&nbsp;to
                become a painter, and only returned to his native country&nbsp;when his master
                himself was exiled. At NeuchâteI he attracted&nbsp;the notice of Roullet de Mezerac,
                who enabled him by a timely&nbsp;loan to proceed to Rome. In depicting the customs
                and life&nbsp;of the people, of southern Italy especially, he showed
                peculiar&nbsp;feeling for the historical characteristics of their race.
                After&nbsp;executing many detached studies of Italian life Robert conceived&nbsp;the
                idea of painting four great works which should represent&nbsp;at one and the same
                time the four seasons in Italy and the four&nbsp;leading races of its people. In the
                “ Return from the Fete of&nbsp;the Madonna dell’ Arco ” (Louvre) he depicted the
                Neapolitans&nbsp;and the spring. This picture, exhibited at the Salon of
                1827,&nbsp;achieved undoubted success and was bought for the Luxembourg by Charles
                X.; but the work which appeared in 1831—&nbsp;IheSummerReapersarrivinginthePontine
                Marshes” (Louvre),&nbsp;which became the property of Louis
                Philippe—established&nbsp;the artist’s reputation. Florence and her autumn
                vineyards&nbsp;should now have furnished him with his third subject.
                He&nbsp;attempted to begin it, but, unable to conquer his passion for&nbsp;Princess
                Charlotte Napoleon (then mourning the violent death&nbsp;of her husband, Robert’s
                devoted friend), he threw up his work&nbsp;and went to Venice, where he began and
                carried through the&nbsp;fourth of the series, the “ Fishers of the Adriatic.” This
                work&nbsp;was not equal to the “ Reapers.” Worn by the vicissitudes of&nbsp;painful
                feeling, and bitterly discouraged, Robert committed&nbsp;suicide before his easel on
                the 20th of March 1835, on the&nbsp;tenth anniversary of the melancholy suicide of a
                brother to&nbsp;whom he had been much attached.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"
