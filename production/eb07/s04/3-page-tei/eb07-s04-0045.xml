In the year 801, however, the Moors were expellled from Bar celona, and a count named Bera, a native of Gothic Gaul,</p><p>was nominated head of the independency. The names of his successors, eleven in number, are too insignificant to require mention individually. Alfonso Raymond, the last count, acceded to power in 1131. On his death, Barcelona was united with Aragon.</p><p>To give a connected history of these various sovereign ties is quite incompatible with our limits. We can only briefly describe those more important transactions affecting the whole country, in which the Christians, by wresting portions of soil from the Moors, compelled them to retire within narrower limits, and thus circumscribed their power. Alfonso and Fruela, the sovereigns who immediately succeeded Pelayo’s son, inflicted several severe blows on the Moors, and overran a considerable portion of the flat coun try. But what proved a more effectual check upon the Saracens than the arms of the Christians, were their own domestic quarrels. So mutable had been the govern ment, that in the space of only forty years from the period of their first landing in Spain, no less than twenty emirs had been called, or had raised themselves, to the seat of power. On the establishment of a monarchy under Abderahman, intestine revolt was quelled for a time ; but a more formidable foe from without made his appearance. This was no other than the celebrated Charlemagne, who poured his legions over the Pyrenees into the valleys of Catalonia. We shall not discuss the much agitated question as to the motives which brought this emperor into Spain. He appears to have received an invitation from some discontented Moorish governors ; and in acceding to their request, he probably also listened to the dictates of his own ambition. Certain it is that he entered Spain with a powerful army, and, if we can trust his historian Eginhard, subjected the country from the Pyrenees to the Iberus. But he was soon recalled from the Peninsula by the revolt of the Saxons. In his passage through the mountain defiles, the rear of his army was attacked by the Navarrese, and cut to pieces.</p><p>It seems certain, that from the period when Charlemagne poured his legions into Navarre, he considered the country as a fief of his crown, and thus gave great umbrage to the Asturian kings. But the inhabitants of the province, averse to the sway of either, longed for independence, and this they succeeded in achieving about the year 885. The rise of this kingdom was another blow to the Saracens. So signal were the successes gained over them by the Chris tians of Navarre, that in the year 920 not a Mahommedan remained in the whole kingdom north of the Ebro. The kings of Asturias and Leon also rapidly extended their do minions. Ordofio II. invaded the Mahommedan possessions, and gained many advantages. In 932, Ramiro II. made an irruption into the states of the enemy, and ruined Madrid. Arabian writers boast of terrible reprisals having been made on the Christians, and assert that Ramiro himself was defeated. The Saracens having invested Zamora, Ramiro approached with a formidable army. The combatants met, and a battle ensued, more obstinately con tested and bloody than any that had been fought since the days of Roderick. There can be no doubt that victory shone on the banners of the Christians, but the success was less splendid than their writers assert it to be. The ac counts of all the battles fought between the Moors and the Christians in Spain are to be received with caution. The Arabian writers, to exalt the prowess of their countrymen, exaggerate mere skirmishes into great battles, and temporary and partial checks into decisive victories. In equivocal cases, they seem invariably to claim the advantage; and where they were defeated, they either obscurely hint the fact, or diminish the loss which they sustained. It is to be feared, that in many instances Christian chronicler* are chargeable with similar partiality.</p></body></text></TEI>
