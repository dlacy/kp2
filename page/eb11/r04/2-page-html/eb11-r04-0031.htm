                process. But,&nbsp;in certain cases, it is conjectured, it was thought&nbsp;proper

                only&nbsp;in proceedings at his instance, or sometimes at that of a third&nbsp;party
                on his behalf, for a stay of execution. It will simplify&nbsp;matters, however, to

        <p><span class="font0">Gaius’s description of it is very general; for details we are

                about the same time as Gaius,&nbsp;and a contemporary of his own) of the provisions
                of the XII.&nbsp;Tables in reference to it. Africanus is made to say that according

                in the sequel—“ or&nbsp;else he was sent across the Tiber to be sold to a foreigner.
                And&nbsp;this capital penalty, sanctioned in the hope of deterring men&nbsp;from
                unfaithfulness to their engagements, was one to be dreaded&nbsp;because of its
                atrocity and of the new terrors with which the&nbsp;decemvirs thought proper to
                invest it. For, if it was to more&nbsp;creditors than one that the debtor had been
                adjudged, they&nbsp;might, if they pleased, cut up and divide his body. Here
                are&nbsp;the words of the statute—</span><span class="font0"

        <p><span class="font0">Such is Gellius’s account of the provisions of the XII. Tables in
                reference to this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis
                adio,</span><span class="font0"> and he is to a considerable
                extent&nbsp;corroborated by Quintilian, Tertullian and Dio Cassius. But it&nbsp;is
                to be borne in mind that he does not vouch for its accuracy;&nbsp;the Tables were
                already in his time matter of antiquity, and even&nbsp;the jurists knew little about
                them beyond what was still in observance. That he has reproduced them only partially
                seems almost&nbsp;beyond question; for in another chapter he himself quotes a
                couple&nbsp;of sentences that are to all appearance from the same context.
                We&nbsp;have to face, therefore, the extreme probability that the record
                is&nbsp;incomplete and the possibility besides that it is not.literally
                accurate.&nbsp;There is room for error, consequently, in two directions; but
                the&nbsp;nature and effect of the procedure in . its main features .may
                be&nbsp;gathered from the texts as they stand with reasonable certainty.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">It was competent only after thirty days from the date of judgment or
                    confession.<sup>@@2</sup> It was apprehension of the debtor by the creditor
                himself,—in its first stage, at least, an act of pure self-help.&nbsp;The debtor had
                at once to be brought before the magistrate, in&nbsp;order that his creditor might
                solemnly go through, the required&nbsp;formalities before he could carry him away
                and provisionally confine&nbsp;him.in the domestic lock-up. It was this appearance
                before the&nbsp;magistrate that made it a </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">legis adio.</span><span class="font0"> Such a course,
                however,&nbsp;was avoided either (l) by instant payment or other implement
                of&nbsp;the judgment or arrangement with the creditor, or (2) by the intervention of
                a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vindex</span><span
                class="font0"> or champion. The position taken by the latter&nbsp;was not. that

                rehearing of the case: he appeared rather as a con-troverier in his own name of the
                right of the creditor to proceed&nbsp;further with his execution, on the ground that
                the judgment was&nbsp;invalid. . This, might necessitate an action between the
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vindex</span><span
                class="font0"> and&nbsp;the creditor, in which the former was plaintiff, but to
                which the&nbsp;debtor was not a party. If it failed, then the </span><span

                liable&nbsp;for double the amount of the original debt, as a penalty on him
                for&nbsp;having improperly interfered with the course of justice; his interference
                was treated as.a delict, but on payment he had presumably&nbsp;relief against the
                original debtor who had been liberated through&nbsp;his intervention. Failing a

                class="font0"> and failing payment, the creditor&nbsp;took his debtor home and
                incarcerated him, dealing with him for&nbsp;sixty days in the manner above
                described. On their expiry, without&nbsp;any arrangement, there was a magisterial
                decree </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(addidio)</span><span
                class="font0"> awarding&nbsp;the debtor to his creditor.</span></p><div>

                    style="font-style:italic;">addidio</span><span class="font0"> confer upon the
                    creditor? The debtor, says Gellius, “ capite poenas dabat,” which he
                    interprets&nbsp;as meaning that his creditor might put him to death, the
                    alternative being his sale as a slave beyond the Tiber. There is,
                    however,&nbsp;a diversity of opinion among the modem writers as to the true
                    meaning&nbsp;of these words. While some hold, and rightly it is thought,
                    that&nbsp;the.Gellian interpretation is correct, others object to it as
                    extravagant.&nbsp;It is objected to by Muirhead on the ground, </span><span
                    class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inter alia,</span><span class="font0">
                    of its&nbsp;incredible severity in the case of petty debtors. He holds
                    that&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">capite poenas
                    dabat</span><span class="font0"> meant simply that the debtor “ paid the
                    penalty&nbsp;with his person,”.in contradistinction to “his means.” </span><span
                    class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caput</span><span class="font0">
                    is&nbsp;thus merely used in opposition to </span><span class="font0"

                    >addidus</span><span class="font0"> when killed might be cut in pieces where
                    there were several&nbsp;creditors. They hold that the words </span><span

                    class="font0"> of the Tables&nbsp;referred not to the body but to the belongings
                    of the debtor,—that&nbsp;when there were concurrent creditors they shared his

                    style="font-style:italic;">Poena capitis</span><span class="font0"> always
                    implies either death,&nbsp;slavery or deprivation of citizenship; there is
                    nothing more astonishing in.a creditor’s right to kill his debtor than in a
                    father’s right to&nbsp;kill his child; and comparative law gives many instances,
                    of a&nbsp;parallel kind, of the harshness of primitive law to defaulting
                    debtors.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">partis
                    secanto</span><span class="font0"> was probably a relic of earlier times, and
                    Gellius&nbsp;admits that he never heard or read of a dissection having
                    taken&nbsp;place.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">The cruelties and indignities to which creditors subjected both
                    their judgment and nexal debtors led, as above noticed,&nbsp;to many a commotion
                    in the first two centuries of the Republic.&nbsp;The latter were probably much
                    more numerous than </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the
                    judicati,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and, being in great part tbe victims
                    of innocent misfortune,&nbsp;it was the sufferings they endured at the hands of
                    relentless&nbsp;creditors that so often roused the sympathies and
                    indignation&nbsp;of the populace. But the judgment-debtors had
                    suffered&nbsp;along with them; and some of the provisions of the
                    Poetilian&nbsp;law of 326 b.c., already mentioned, were meant to protect
                    tbe&nbsp;former against the needless and unjustifiable severity that
                    had&nbsp;characterized their treatment by their creditors. The </span><span

                    the debtor to his creditor when the sixty days had&nbsp;expired without

                    debt, there were to be no more&nbsp;dungeons and stripes, fetters and
                    foot-blocks; the creditor was&nbsp;to treat his debtor and his industry as a
                    source of profit that&nbsp;would in time diminish and possibly extinguish his
                    indebtedness, rather than as an object upon which he might perpetrate&nbsp;any
                    cruelty by way of punishment. Although the edict of&nbsp;P. Rutilius of 107
