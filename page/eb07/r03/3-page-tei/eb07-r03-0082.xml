By the ukase of the 25th of June 1835, they are placed under the ministry of public instruction, represented in the different circuits by sub-delegates called curators, by which education is placed under the direct and immediate control of government. The different branches of the administration also take special cognizance of the schools analogous to them. Thus, the military schools are presided over by the war-office, the ecclesiastical schools by the holy synod, and so on of the others. The whole system is divided into four distinct parts : I. The ministry of public instruction; II. Military schools: III. Ecclesiastical schools: and, IV. Special and other schools.</p><p>I. <hi rend="italic">Ministry of Public Instruction.</hi>  This department comprehends, 1. Education in public schools ; 2. Education in private institutions ; 3. Domestic education ; 4. Establishments destined for forming professors and masters; 5. The Academy of Sciences, the Russian Academy, the other learned societies, the censorship, public libraries, museums, and collections of every description. The public schools are thus discriminated into, 1. Parish schools, intended for the lower orders, and allowed to teach only the catechism, reading, writing, and the first four rules of arithmetic ; 2. District schools, having three classes intended for the children of shopkeepers, and restricted in their course of instruction to the catechism, caligraphy, drawing, the first rudiments of grammar, arithmetic, geometry, geography, and history ; 3. Gymnasiums distributed by government, divided into seven classes, authorized to embrace more elevated studies, but only accessible to the children of the nobility ; 4. Universities of three faculties,</p><lb/><p>The number of schools under the minister of public instruction has likewise increased ; and, viewing the general table of the march of education in Russia, there appears to be a progressive increase of the number of pupils. But, examined in detail, some parts of the empire exhibit a striking falling off. This is especially the case in some of the provinces formerly Polish, where schools were suppressed as a measure of policy.</p><p>The minister of public instruction has another important duty besides those mentioned. He exercises a jealous scrutiny of education in private and in boarding schools, as well as domestic education ; no one being permitted to follow the profession of a teacher unless he has at least undergone an examination at one of the universities. Private institutions of instruction are usually conducted by foreigners, who, lest they should propagate forbidden truths, are placed under the inspection of the local authorities, and cannot make use of any books but those appointed by government. Other means are taken to shackle these private schools, and deter foreigners from settling in Russia as teachers of the people. But private or domestic tuition even by natives is discouraged. No father has the power of selecting the instructors of his children at his own pleasure ; he must take them from amongst the individuals licensed by government, or furnished with an authority</p><lb/><p>those of philosophy, of jurisprudence, and of medicine (the university of Dorpat has a fourth, the faculty of theology), and of which the courses last five years. The following is a table of the state of the schools in 1835 throughout the ten circuits of the Russian empire, exclusive of Poland, which has a separate administration. It may be mentioned, that another university has recently been established at Vladimir, in Volhynia; so that, including the university of Warsaw, there will be nine institutions of this description throughout the Russian empire.</p><lb/><table><row><cell cols="2" rows="2"/><cell cols="4" rows="1"><p>Number of</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Univer</p><p>sities.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Gymna</p><p>siums.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Infant</p><p>Schools.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Pupils.</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Circuit of St Petersburg...</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>8</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>571</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>11,911</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>2.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>...    Moscow...........</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="4"><p>10</p><p>7</p><p>10</p><p>4</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>914</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="5"><p>16,259</p><p>11,446</p><p>8,459</p><p>8,826</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>3.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>...    Kharkov..........</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>209</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>4.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>..    Kazan.............</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>1</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="3"><p>187</p><p>248</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>5.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>...

No Russian subject is permitted to be educated in a foreign country under eighteen years of age ; and even after that age it is the emperor alone who can grant the necessary permission. In 1829 there was founded at St Petersburg what is called an Upper Teacher’s Institution, a sort of normal school, its object being the preparation of tutors for the gymnasia and lyceums of the empire. It stands next in order after the universities, and the number of pupils in 1835 was 146.</p><p>II. <hi rend="italic">Military Schools.</hi>  These institutions especially engage the solicitude of government; they multiply with amazing rapidity, and absorb far too much of the funds allotted to national education. The numerous establishments of this class have been arranged under the categories of, 1. Schools placed under the direction of his Imperial Highness the Grand Duke Michael ; 2. Schools under the direction of the navy board ; and, 3. Military schools, especially reserved for soldiers’ children, and which are under the control of the minister of war. The first are pretty widely distributed throughout the empire; the second class, designated navy, battalion of pilots, and instruction for workmen, are established only at St Petersburg, Cronstadt, Ni-colaief, and Sebastopol ; and the third are planted in the military colonies.
