<p><span class="font3">Therefore the mean depth, which is the quotient of the area divided by the border, is the same in both ; and this is&nbsp;the case, whatever is the width BE at the bottom, or even&nbsp;though there be no rectangle such as 6BEe interposed between the slant sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Of all rectangles, that whose breadth is twice the height, or which is half of a square, gives the greatest mean depth&nbsp;If, therefore, FK be double of FD, the trapezium ABEC,&nbsp;which has the same area, will have the largest mean depth&nbsp;of any such trapezium, and will be the best form of a channel for conveying running waters. In this case, we have&nbsp;AC = 10, AH = 3, and BE = 2. Or we may say that the&nbsp;best form is a trapezium, whose bottom width is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>r</sup>l of</span><span class="font3"> the&nbsp;depth, and whose extreme width is <sup>1</sup>¼<sup>,</sup>. This form approaches very near to that which the torrents in the hills&nbsp;naturally dig for themselves in uniform ground, where their&nbsp;action is not checked by stones which they lay bare, or&nbsp;which they deposit in their course. This shows us, and it&nbsp;will be fully confirmed by and by, that the channel of a&nbsp;river is not a fortuitous thing, but has a relation to the consistency of the soil and velocity of the stream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A rectangle, whose breadth is ¼ of the depth of water, will therefore have the same depth with a triangle whose&nbsp;surface width is ⅝ of its vertical depth ; for this is the dimensions when the rectangle ⅛BEe is taken away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let A be the area of the section of any channel, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3"> its width (when rectangular), and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font3"> its depth of water. Then</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">what we have called its mean depth, or rf, will be --„ ,,</span></p>
<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>r</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w</span><span class="font2"> + 2 Λ</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">= —=r∙ Or if </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font3"> expresses the ratio of the width to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3"> + 2 A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>71</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the depth of a rectangular bed, that is, if </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font3"> = -y, we have</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a very simple and ready expression for the mean depth,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">either from the width or depth. For </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d = —<sup>w</sup> ■ , </span><span class="font3">or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d = <sup>r</sup>l + <sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;text-decoration:underline;">g<sup>h</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">«7 + 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore, if the depth were infinite, and the width finite,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">we should have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font3"> = 4y ; or if the width be infinite, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">depth finite, we have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d = h.</span><span class="font3"> And these are the limits of the values of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d;</span><span class="font3"> and therefore in rivers whose width is&nbsp;always great in comparison of the depth, we may without&nbsp;much error take their real depth for their hydraulic mean&nbsp;depth. Hence we derive a rule of easy recollection, and&nbsp;w<sup>τ</sup>hich will at all times give us a very near estimate of&nbsp;the velocity and expense of a running stream, viz. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">that&nbsp;the velocities are nearly as the square roots of the depths.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">We find this confirmed by many experiments of Miche-lotti.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Also, when we are allowed to suppose this ratio of the velocities and depths, that is, in a rectangular canal of great&nbsp;breadth and small depth, we shall have the quantities discharged nearly in the proportion of the cubes of the velocities. For the quantity discharged </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font3"> is as the velocity and&nbsp;area jointly, that is, as the height and velocity jointly, because when the width is the same the area is as the height.&nbsp;Therefore, rve have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d==h v.</span><span class="font3"> But, by the above remark,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h == ν'.</span><span class="font3"> Therefore, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d = v<sup>3</sup> ;</span><span class="font3"> and this is confirmed by the&nbsp;experiments of Bossut, vol. ii. 236. Also, because </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font3"> is as&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">v h,</span><span class="font3"> when </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3"> is constant, and by the above remark (allowable when </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3"> is very great in proportion to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h) v</span><span class="font3"> is as √</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">we have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font3"> as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h∙Jh,</span><span class="font3"> or ∕t-, or the squares of the discharges proportional to the cubes of the heights in rectangular beds, and in their corresponding trapeziums.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1. Knowing the mean depth and the proportion of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">width and real depth, we can determine the dimensions of 2&lt;∕</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the bed, and we have </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w = q d</span><span class="font3"> + 2 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h = d</span><span class="font3"> -1--.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we knew the area and mean depth, we can in like&lt;&nbsp;manner find the dimensions, that is, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h ;</span><span class="font3"> for A = </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w h,</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font3"> be known, and one of the dimensions be given,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">we can find the other ; for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">d = —-, ‰</span><span class="font3"> gives </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">w — ~-i w</span><span class="font3"> + 2 A <sup>o</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h—d</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">Having thus established the relation between the different circumstances of the form of the channel to our general&nbsp;formula, we proceed to consider,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">§ 2. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Gradations of Velocity from tlœ middle of the Stream to the sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The knowledge of this is necessary for understanding the regimen of a river ; for it is the velocity of the filaments in contact with the bed which produces any change&nbsp;in it, and occasions any preference of one to another in respect of regimen or stability. Did these circumstances not&nbsp;operate, the water, true to the laws of hydraulics, and confined within the bounds which have been assigned them,&nbsp;would neither enlarge nor diminish the area of the channel.&nbsp;But this is all that we can promise of waters perfectly clear,&nbsp;running in pipes or hewn channels. But rivers, brooks, and&nbsp;smaller streams, carry along waters loaded with mud or&nbsp;sand, which they deposit wherever their velocity is checked ; and they tear up, on the other hand, the materials of&nbsp;the channel wherever their velocity is sufficiently great.&nbsp;Nature, indeed, aims continually at an equilibrium, and&nbsp;works without ceasing to perpetuate her own performances,&nbsp;by establishing an equality of action and re-action, and proportioning the forms and direction of the motions to het&nbsp;agents, and to local circumstances. Her work is slow but&nbsp;unceasing ; and what she cannot accomplish in a year she&nbsp;will do in a century. The beds of our rivers have acquired&nbsp;some stability, because they are the labour of ages; and it&nbsp;is to time that we owe those deep and wide valleys which&nbsp;receive and confine our rivers in channels, which are now&nbsp;consolidated, and with slopes which have been gradually&nbsp;moderated, so that they no longer either ravage our habitations or confound our boundaries. Art may imitate nature,&nbsp;and, by directing her operations (which she still carries on&nbsp;according to her own imprescriptible laws) according to our&nbsp;views, we can hasten her progress, and accomplish our purpose, during the short period of human life. But we can&nbsp;do this only by studying the unalterable laws of mechanism&nbsp;These are presented to U3 by spontaneous nature.
