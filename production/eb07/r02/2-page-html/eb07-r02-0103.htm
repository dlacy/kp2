<p><span class="font0">ter, to the standard of natural feeling, and to present us with real beings, instead of fantastic creations of the imagination.&nbsp;His chief faults are his intolerable minuteness in trifles, and&nbsp;the affectation of the style, which is worthy of the society&nbsp;of the Hotel de Rambouillet. His best novel, too, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mariamne,</span><span class="font0"> terminates abruptly and inartificially, with a conclusion like that of Zadig, “ where nothing is concluded.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Prevot had a much higher and more romantic imagination than Marivaux. He threw into the novel something of the gloom and grandeur of tragedy; and hence he has been&nbsp;termed by some of his countrymen the Crebillon of romance.&nbsp;A visionary disposition and an ardent temperament had hurried him through a restless and passionate life, in which good&nbsp;and evil, suffering and enjoyment, had been scarcely blended ; so that to the task of composition he brought the results&nbsp;of a mournful experience in aid of the resources of the imagination. To use the expression of Voltaire, “ Il n’etait&nbsp;pas seulement un auteur mais un homme, ayant connu et&nbsp;senti les passions.” Prevot is not a great inventor of character ; for to all his heroes, Cleveland, Patrice, even the&nbsp;Chevalier des Grieux, he appears to have lent much of his&nbsp;own feelings and his own peculiarities of mind. Though an&nbsp;extremely voluminous novelist, none of his works appear&nbsp;now to be read or recollected, except his painful but powerful story of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manon E Escaut,</span><span class="font0"> a tale of crime and profligacy,&nbsp;strangely blended with generous feeling, which has been&nbsp;translated into English by Charlotte Smith. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manon EEscaut,</span><span class="font0"> though little more than an episode, thrown off apparently with an easy negligence, bears the impress of genius,&nbsp;which it would be difficult to recognise in an authentic form&nbsp;in any of the larger productions of Prevot. Opening in the&nbsp;most unpromising manner, with what appears to be the&nbsp;common-place history of a vicious and discreditable connexion between Des Grieux and Manon, in which weakness&nbsp;of principle on the one side is made the dupe of profligacy&nbsp;and vanity, united with personal charms, on the other, the&nbsp;stream of feeling, at first polluted and turbid, works itself&nbsp;purer as it runs ; and the scenes rise into elevation just&nbsp;as the character of Manon herself, the “ fair mischief” of&nbsp;the romance, around whom Prevot has thrown no common&nbsp;fascination, changes from the selfish mistress into the faithful companion, following the fortunes of her husband, whom&nbsp;her charms had ruined, into disgrace and banishment, and&nbsp;dying by his side among the wiids of America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Love also forms the subject of the novels of Madame de Tencin, (died 1749), the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Siege of Calais</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Count de&nbsp;Comminges,</span><span class="font0"> which are admired for their tenderness and&nbsp;delicacy, qualities we should hardly have anticipated from&nbsp;a lady who stood in so confidential a relation to the cardinal&nbsp;Dubois, and who left her illegitimate child, d’Alembert, to&nbsp;the tender mercies of the public.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The greatest of the French novelists, however, is Le Sage. Even in his first romance, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diable Boiteux,</span><span class="font0"> the plan of&nbsp;which has been suggested by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Diablo Cojuelo</span><span class="font0"> of Luis&nbsp;Velez de la Guevara, and which appeared in 1707, the wit,&nbsp;the graceful lightness, and tile good-humoured sagacity&nbsp;of observation, which distinguished the character of Le&nbsp;Sage, were evident. The conception, in particular, of his&nbsp;esprit follet, a “ diable bon-homme,” with so much more&nbsp;gaiety than malice, that at times we are tempted to think&nbsp;him rather amiable than otherwise, was a great improvement on Guevara’s ; and the effect of the work was&nbsp;heightened by the skill with which he contrived to interweave with the story, if such it can be called, a multitude&nbsp;of contemporary allusions. Such indeed was its popularity&nbsp;and immediate sale, that two young men are said to have&nbsp;fought a duel in a bookseller’s shop about their right to the&nbsp;only remaining copy ; a well attested anecdote, so much&nbsp;in the spirit of those satirical traits in which Asmodeus indulges, that as Sir Walter Scott remarks, it deserved to be&nbsp;recorded by the demon himself.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">The reputation as a novelist which these most amusing revelations of Asmodeus had founded, was brought to its&nbsp;height by the production of the first three volumes of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gil&nbsp;Blas,</span><span class="font0"> bringing tlle history down to the retirement to Lirias;&nbsp;a work, with the exception of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Don Quixote,</span><span class="font0"> perhaps the&nbsp;most universally popular in fictitious writing, pleasing equally, whether read in youth, in manhood, or in age, and containing, as has been justly said, more “ useful knowledge,”&nbsp;than twenty scientific and moral treatises. Le Sage’s celebrated novel represents thelevel of life as it appears in a large&nbsp;capital, without either its brightest lights or its darkest shadows. He exhibits the average state of feeling among such&nbsp;communities,—loving virtue and good conduct within due&nbsp;bounds, but, at the same time, with that natural toleration for&nbsp;selfishness, servility, vanity, or occasional deviations from the&nbsp;path of strict integrity, which in such society is certain to be&nbsp;engendered and countenanced. Ashesawnothinglikean elevated morality in thew’orld with which he was best acquainted,—the Parisian public,—so he has not attempted to introduce any such exalted tone of feeling into his romance. His&nbsp;hero is an adventurer, to whom a hundred parallels might&nbsp;probably have been pointed out any evening among the audiences at the Foire, with fair abilities, with a kindly heart,&nbsp;and naturally good inclinations, but little moral firmness ;&nbsp;by no means so enamoured of the straight road of right as&nbsp;not to turn aside occasionally when the deviation suits his&nbsp;purposes ; duped at first by his own vanity, and then availing himself of his dear-bought experience to take his revenge on others in the same coin, but still with a gradually increasing preference for good conduct and virtue, and&nbsp;a secret determination, when a favourable opportunity offers,&nbsp;and his fortune is made, of becoming in due course an honest man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To this conception of an agreeable rogue, refined partly by good feeling, and partly by calculation, into a better&nbsp;being, Le Sage has imparted a wonderful air of particular,&nbsp;combined with general truth ; for though </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gil Bias</span><span class="font0"> is the representative of so w ide a class, that almost all must acknowledge at times some common, and perhaps not very&nbsp;flattering features of resemblance between ourselves and&nbsp;him, he preserves throughout his whole career the most distinct individuality of character. Nor are the other subsidiary agents of the novel deficient in distinctness and clearness of portraiture. Sangrado, Scipio, the sleek Ambrose&nbsp;de Lamela, the eloquent but apoplectic archbishop, are&nbsp;made to stand before us. The historical personages have&nbsp;the same look of truth. Lerma and Olivarez, in particular,&nbsp;are admirably painted ; so much so, that some Spanish critics, like De ΓIsla and Llorente, have zealously maintained&nbsp;that Le Sage merely translated from some unknow<sup>r</sup>n Spanish&nbsp;manuscript which he had plundered. These critics reason, in&nbsp;fact, in such an ingenious way, as to make the accuracy or&nbsp;inaccuracy of Le Sage’s Spanish pictures equally available&nbsp;for their argument. If he be perfectly correct in his portraits of manners, and his allusions to Spanish customs, that&nbsp;part of the work, they maintain, could not have been written by any but a Spaniard. If he falls into mistakes, it is&nbsp;equally clear that these apparent slips were introduccd by&nbsp;him on purpose to hide the source of his depredations, and&nbsp;to confuse, like Cacus, the traces of his retreat. It is needless to say that the statement, at least as made in this unqualified form, is totally incorrect. Le Sage had no doubt&nbsp;thoroughly imbued himself with the spirit of the Spanish&nbsp;humour, as it appeared in Cervantes, and the writers of the&nbsp;Picaresco school ; and, as already said, he borrow<sup>,</sup>ed liberally incidents from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">various</span><span class="font0"> Spanish romances ; but he lent&nbsp;to the whole a point, gaiety, and philosophy, which presented the old materials with all the appearance of novelty, and&nbsp;the charm of an original invention. “ All is easy and good-humoured, gay, light, and lively; even the cavern of the&nbsp;robbers is illuminated with a ray of that wit witll which Le</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
