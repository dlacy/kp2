<p><span class="font3">therefore thoſe mines which are properly royal, and to which the king is entitled when found, are ^nly thoſe&nbsp;of ſilver and gold. See Mine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the fame original may in part be reſerrcdthe&nbsp;revenue of treaſure-trove. See </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">TKKΛsuRK-Trove.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;waifs. See waif.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eſtrays. See Estray.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Beſides the particular reafons, given in the different articles, why the king ſhould have the ſeveral revenues&nbsp;of royal fiſh, ſhipwrecks, treaſure-trove, waifs, and&nbsp;eſtrays, there is alfo onc general reaſon which holds&nbsp;for them all ; and that is, becauſe they are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bona vacantia,</span><span class="font3"> or goods in which no one elſe can claim a property. And, therefore, by the law of nature, they be-longed to the firſt occupant or finder; and ſo continued&nbsp;under the imperial law. But, in ſettling the modern&nbsp;eonſtſtutions of moſt of the governments in Europe, it&nbsp;was thought proper (to prevent that ſtrife and contention which the mere title of occupancy is apt to create&nbsp;and continue, and to provide for the ſupport of public&nbsp;authority in a manner the leaſt burdenſome to individuals) that theſe rights ſhould be annexed to the ſu-preme power by the pofitive laws of the ſtate. And&nbsp;io it came to paſs, that, as Bracton expreſſes it, &quot; hæc,&nbsp;&quot; quæ nullius in bonis ſunt, et olim fuerunt inventons&nbsp;&quot; de jure naturali, jam efficiuntur principis de jure gen-&quot; tium.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next branch of the king’s ordinary revenue&nbsp;conſiſts in forfeitures of lands and goods for offences ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">bona confiſcata,</span><span class="font3"> as they are called by the civilians, be-caufe they belonged to the</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">fiβus</span><span class="font3"> or imperial treaſury ;&nbsp;or, as our lawyers term them,ybrh </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ſacta,</span><span class="font3"> that is, ſuch&nbsp;whereof the property is gone away or departed from the&nbsp;owner. The true reaſon and only ſubſtantial ground&nbsp;oſ any forfeiture for crimes, conſiſt in this ; that all&nbsp;property is derived from ſociety, being one of thofe&nbsp;civil rights which are conferred upon individuals, in ex-change for that degree of natural freedom which every&nbsp;man muſt ſacrifice when he enters into ſocial communities. If, therefore, a member of any national community violates the fundamental contract of his affirmation, by tranfgreſſing the municipal law, he forfeits&nbsp;his right to ſuch privileges as he claims by that con-tract ; and the ſtate may very juſtly reſume that portion of property, or any part of it, which the laws&nbsp;have before affigned him. Henςe, in every offence of&nbsp;an atrocious kind, the laws of England have exacted&nbsp;a total confifcation of the moveables or perſonal eſtate ;&nbsp;and, in many caſes, a perpetual, in others only a temporary, lpfs of the offender’s immoveables or landed property ; and have veiled them both in the king, who is&nbsp;the perſon ſuppoſed to be offended, being the one viſible magiſtrate in whom the majeſty of the public re-ſides. See Forfeiture and Deodand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another branch of the king’s ordinary revenue&nbsp;arifes from eſcheats of lands, which happen upon the&nbsp;defect of heirs to ſucceed to the inheritance ; where-upon they in general revert to and veſt in the king,&nbsp;who is eſteemed, in the eye of the law, the original pro-prietor of all lands in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The laſt branch of the king’s ordinary revenue,&nbsp;conſiſts in the cuſtody of idiots, from whence we ſhall&nbsp;be naturally led to cυnlider alſo the cuſtody of lunatics.&nbsp;See Idiot and Lunatic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">This may ſuffice for a ſhort view of the king’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ordi</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">nary</span><span class="font3"> revenue, or the proper patrimony of the crown j which was very large formerly, and capable of being&nbsp;increaſed to a magnitude truly formidable : for there&nbsp;are very few eſtates in the kingdom that have not, at&nbsp;ſome period or other ſince the Norman conqueſt, been&nbsp;veſted in the hands of the king, by forfeiture, eſcheat,&nbsp;or otherwiſe. But, fortunately for the liberty of the&nbsp;ſubject, this hereditary landed revenue, by a ſeries of&nbsp;improvident management, is funk almoſt to nothing ;&nbsp;and the caſual profits, ariſing from the other branches&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cenfus regalis,</span><span class="font3"> are likewiſe almoſt all of them&nbsp;alienated from the crown. In order to ſupply the deficiencies of which, we are now obliged to have recourfe&nbsp;to new methods of railing money, unknown to our early&nbsp;anceſtors ; which methods conſtitute.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">„ II. The king’s </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">extraordinary</span><span class="font3"> revenue. For, the public patrimony being got into the hands of private ſubjects, it is but reaſonable that private contributions ſhonld ſupply the public ſervice. which, though it&nbsp;may perhaps fall harder upon ſome individuals, whoſe&nbsp;anceſtors have had no ſhare in the general plunder,&nbsp;than upon others, yet, taking the nation .throughout,&nbsp;it amounts to nearly the ſame ; provided the gain by&nbsp;the extraordinary ſhould appear to be no greater than&nbsp;the loſs by the ordinary revenue. And perhaps, if&nbsp;every gentleman in the kingdom was to be ſtripped of&nbsp;ſuch of his lands as were formerly the property of the&nbsp;crown, was to be again ſubject to the inconveniences&nbsp;of purveyance and pre-emption, the oppreſſion of fo∙&nbsp;reſt-laws, and the ſlavery of <sup>,</sup>feodal-tenures ; and was&nbsp;to reſign into the king’s hands all his royal franchiſes&nbsp;of waifs, wrecks, eſtrays, treaſure-trove, mines, deo-dands, forfeitures, and the like ; he would find himſelf a greater loſer than by paying his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">quota</span><span class="font3"> to ſuch&nbsp;taxes as are neceſſary to the ſupport oſ government.&nbsp;The thing, therefore, to be wiſhed and aimed at </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">a&nbsp;land of liberty, is by no means the total abolition of&nbsp;taxes, which would draw after it very pernicious con-ſequences, and the very fuppoſition </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font3">which is the&nbsp;height of political abfurdity. For as the true idea of&nbsp;government and magiſtracy will be found to conſiſt in&nbsp;this, that ſome few men are deputed by many others&nbsp;to preſide over public affairs, ſo that individuals may&nbsp;the better be enabled to attend their private concerns ∙,&nbsp;it is neceſſary that thoſe individuals ſhould be bound&nbsp;to contribute a portion of their private gains, in order&nbsp;to ſupport that government, and reward that magiſtracy, which protects them in the enjoyment of their&nbsp;reſpective properties. But the things to be aimed at&nbsp;are wiſdom and moderation, not only in granting, but&nbsp;alfo in the method of raiſing, the neceſſary fiιpplies j&nbsp;by contriving to do both in ſuch a manner as may be&nbsp;moſt coducive to the national welfare, and at the ſame&nbsp;time moſt conſiſtent with economy and the liberty of&nbsp;the ſubject ; who, when properly taxed, contributes&nbsp;only, as was before obſerved, ſome part of his property&nbsp;in order to enjoy the reſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Theſe extaordinary grants are ufually called by the ſynonymous names of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">aids, fubfidies,</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ſupplies ;</span><span class="font3"> and&nbsp;are granted by the commons of Great Britain, in par-liament aſſembled. See Parliament and Tax.</span></p>
