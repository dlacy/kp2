<p><span class="font1">the religious and the moral life will vanish, and the Christian state, as the highest sphere of human life representing all human functions,&nbsp;will displace the church. “ In proportion as the Saviour Christianizes&nbsp;the state by means of the church must the progressive completion&nbsp;of the structure of the church prove the cause of its abolition.”&nbsp;The decline of the church is therefore not to be deplored, but&nbsp;recognized as the consequence of the independence and completeness of the Christian life.

Her husband, François of Orleans-Longueville,&nbsp;marquis de Rothelin, died in 1548, and in watching her son’s&nbsp;interests in Neuchâtel she was brought into contact with the&nbsp;reformers in Switzerland.

<p><span class="font1">ROTHENBURG-OB-DER-TAUBER, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Bavaria, 49 m. by rail S.W. of Nuremberg.&nbsp;Pop. (1905) 8436. It is beautifully situated on an eminence&nbsp;200 ft. above the Tauber. It is flanked by medieval walls,&nbsp;towers and gates, and its antique appearance has been carefully preserved. Perhaps the most interesting building is&nbsp;the town hall, one part of which dates from 1240 and the other&nbsp;from 1572. The latter is a beautiful Renaissance structure,&nbsp;with a magnificent façade and a delicate spire, and contains a&nbsp;grand hall, the Kaisersaal, in which every Whit Monday a&nbsp;play, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Der Meislertrunk,</span><span class="font1"> which commemorates the capture&nbsp;of the town by Tilly in 1631, is performed. Other buildings&nbsp;are the Gothic church of St James, with curiously carved&nbsp;altars and beautiful stained-glass windows, and containing&nbsp;in the Toppler chapel the tomb of the burgomaster, Heinrich&nbsp;Toppler; the 15th-century church of St Wolfgang; the Franciscan church; and five other churches. The town has many&nbsp;picturesque houses, and possesses a library with some interesting archives. It has manufactures of toys and agricultural&nbsp;machinery, electrical works and breweries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rothenburg-ob-der-Tauber, mentioned in the chronicles in 304 as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rolinbure,</span><span class="font1"> was probably a residence of the dukes of&nbsp;Franconia. It first appears as a town in 942 and until 1108&nbsp;was the seat of the counts of Rothenburg-Komburg; when&nbsp;this line became extinct it passed to the family of Hohenstaufen, one member of which took the title of duke of Rothenburg. In 1172 it became a free imperial city and it attained&nbsp;the zenith of its prosperity under the famous burgomaster&nbsp;Heinrich Toppler (1350-1408). It took part in the movements&nbsp;in South Germany during the 15th and 16th centuries. In 1631&nbsp;Rothenburg was stormed by Tilly, and the cup of wine presented by the burgomaster, which, according to tradition, saved&nbsp;the town from destruction, is annually commemorated in the&nbsp;play mentioned above.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROTHERHAM, THOMAS (1423-1500), archbishop of York, also called </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Thomas Scot,</span><span class="font1"> was born at Rotherham on the 24th of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">August 1423; he was educated in his native town and seems to have been connected with both the universities of Oxford and&nbsp;Cambridge. Having entered the church he became rector of&nbsp;Ripple, Worcestershire, and later of St Vedast, Foster Lane,&nbsp;London, and it was probably when he was chaplain to John de&nbsp;Vere, earl of Oxford, that he made the acquaintance of Elizabeth&nbsp;Woodville, afterwards the queen of Edward IV. In 1467&nbsp;Rotherham became keeper of the privy seal to this king; in&nbsp;1468 he was appointed bishop of Worcester, in 1472 bishop of&nbsp;Lincoln and in 1475 chancellor of England. Several times he&nbsp;went to France on public business; in 1475 at the treaty of&nbsp;Picquigny he received a pension from Louis XI. of France, and&nbsp;in 1480 he was chosen archbishop of York. When Edward IV.&nbsp;died in April 1483 the archbishop remained true to his widow&nbsp;Elizabeth, and consequently lost the chancellorship and was&nbsp;put into prison by Richard III. He was soon set at liberty,&nbsp;and he died in 1500 at Cawood, near York. At Oxford Rotherham built part of Lincoln College and increased its endowment;&nbsp;at Cambridge, where he was chancellor and master of Pembroke&nbsp;Hall, he helped to build the University Library. He founded a&nbsp;college at Rotherham, which was suppressed under Edward VI.,&nbsp;and he was responsible for the building of part of the church&nbsp;of All Saints there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROTHERHAM, a market-town and municipal borough in the Rotherham parliamentary division of the West Riding of&nbsp;Yorkshire, England, 5 m. N.E. of Sheffield, on the Midland,&nbsp;North-Eastern and Great Central railways. Pop. (1891)&nbsp;42,061; (1901) 54,349. It lies in the valley of the Don, where&nbsp;that river is joined by the Rother, and has communication&nbsp;by water with the Humber. The Don is crossed by a bridge&nbsp;on which is a small ancient building, formerly a chapel. The&nbsp;parish church of All Saints, occupying the site of a building&nbsp;dating from Anglo-Saxon times, was erected in the reign of&nbsp;Edward IV., and is among the best specimens of Perpendicular&nbsp;in the north of England. The town possesses iron, steel and&nbsp;brass works, railway wagon works, potteries, glass-works,&nbsp;breweries, saw-mills and rope-yards. At the township of&nbsp;Masborough, opposite Rotherham across the Don, works were&nbsp;established in 1746 by Samuel Walker, a successful ironmaster.&nbsp;The municipal borough, incorporated in 1871, is under a mayor,&nbsp;6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area, 6012 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The town was of some importance in Anglo-Saxon times, and at Templeborough, on the S.E. side of Rotherham, there&nbsp;was a Roman fort, but its traces are effaced. In the time of&nbsp;Edward the Confessor, Rotherham possessed a market and a&nbsp;church. During the Civil War it sided with the Parliament.&nbsp;It was taken by the Royalists in 1643, but after the victory&nbsp;of Marston Moor was yielded to a detachment of the Parliamentary forces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROTHES, EARLS OF. The first earl of Rothes was George Leslie, son of Norman Leslie of Rothes in Moray, and of&nbsp;Ballinbreicb in Fife. In 1445 he was created Baron Leslie&nbsp;of Leven, and about 1458 earl of Rothes in the peerage of&nbsp;Scotland. His grandson George, the 4th earl (d. 1558), whose&nbsp;father, William, the 3rd earl, was killed at Flodden, was accused,&nbsp;but acquitted in 1546, of complicity in the murder of Cardinal&nbsp;Beaton, in which his brother and his two sons were undoubtedly&nbsp;implicated; he was one of the Scottish commissioners who&nbsp;witnessed the marriage of Mary queen of Scots with Francis,&nbsp;the dauphin of France. His son Andrew, 5th earl of Rothes&nbsp;(d. 1611), took an active part with the lords of the congregation,&nbsp;first against the queen-mother, Mary of Guise, when regent&nbsp;of Scotland, and afterwards against Mary queen of Scots in&nbsp;opposing her marriage with Darnley, and in devising the&nbsp;murder of Rizzio. He was, however, one of the peers who&nbsp;acquitted Both well of Darnley’s murder; and going over to&nbsp;the side of the queen, he fought for her at Langside. He&nbsp;continued to occupy a position of some prominence in Scottish&nbsp;affairs until, his death in 1611. His great-grandson, John, 7th&nbsp;earl of Rothes (1630-1681), held a command in the Royalist&nbsp;army at the battle of Worcester in 1651, and accompanied&nbsp;Charles II. to England at the Restoration, when he became</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
