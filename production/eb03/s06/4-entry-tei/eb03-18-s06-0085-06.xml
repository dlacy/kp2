is a term uſed by ſeamen to expreſs a peculiar swell and breaking of the ſea upon the shore. It ſometimes forms but a ſingle range along the ſhore, and at others three or four behind one another extending perhaps half a mile out to ſea. The ſurf begins to affirme its form at ſome distance ſrom the place where it breaks, gradually accumulating as it moves forward till it gain, not uncommonly, in places within the limits of the trade-winds, a height of 15 or 20 feet, when it overhangs at top, and falls like a caſcade with great force and a prodigious noiſe. Countries where ſurfs prevail require beats of a particular conſtruction very different from the greater part of thoſe which are built in Europe. In ſome places ſurfs are great at high, and in others at low water; but we believe they are uniformly moſt violent during the ſpring-tides.</p><p>It is not easy to aſſign the cauſe of ſurfs. That they are affected by the winds can hardly be queſtioned ; but that they do not proceed from the <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> operation of the wind in the places where they happen, is evident from this circumſtance, that the ſurf is often higheſt and moſt violent where there is leaſt wind, and <hi rend="italic">vice verſa.</hi> On the coaſt of Sumatra the higheſt are experienced during the ſouth-eaſt monſoon, which is never attended with ſuch gales as the north-west. As they are most general in the tropical latitudes, Mr Marſden, who ſeems to have paid much attention to the ſubject, attributes them to the trade-winds which prevail at a distance from ſhore between the parallels of 30 degrees north and south, whoſe uniform and invariable action cauſes a long and constant swell, that exists even in the calmeſt weather, about the line, towards which its direction tends from either side. This swell, when a ſquall happens or the wind freſhens up, will for the time have other ſubſidiary waves on the extent of its ſurface, breaking often in a direction contrary to it, and which will again subſide as a calm returns, without having produced on it any perceptible effect. Sumatra, though not continually expoſed to the ſouth-eaſt trade-wind, is not ſo distant but that its influence may be preſumed to extend to it ; and accordingly at Poolo Peſang, near the ſouthern extremity of the iſland, a conſtant ſoutherly ſea is obſerved, even after a ſtrong north-west wind. This incessant and powerful ſwell rolling in from an ocean, open even to the pole, ſeems an agent adequate to the prodigious effects produced on the coaſt ; whilſt its very size contributes to its being overlooked. It reconciles almoſt all the difficulties which the phenomena ſeem to preſent, and in particular it accounts for the decreaſe of the ſurf during the north-weſt monſoon, the local wind then counteracting the operation of the general one ; and it is corroborated by an obſervation, that the ſurfs on the Sumatran coaſt ever begin<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0092.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0086"/>
to break at their ſouthern extreme, the motion of the ſwell not being perpendicular to the direction or the ſhore. This explanation of the phenomena is certainly plauſible ; but, as the author candidly acknowledges, objections may be urged to it. The trade-winds and the ſwell occaſioned by them are remarkably ſteady and uniform ; but the ſurfs are much the reverſe. How then comes an uniform cauſe to produce unſteady effects ?</p><p>In the opinion of our author it produces no unſteady effects. The irregularity of the ſurfs, he ſays, is perceived only within the remoter limits of the trade-winds. But the equatorial parts of the earth performing their diurnal revolution with greater velocity than the reſt, a larger circle being described in the ſame time, the waters thereabout, from the ſtronger centrifugal force, may be ſuppoſed more buoyant ; to feel less reſtraint from the ſluggiſh principle of matter; to have leſs gravity ; and therefore to be more obedient to external impulſes of every kind, whether ſrom the winds or any other cauſe.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
