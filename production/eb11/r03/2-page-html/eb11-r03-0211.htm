<p><span class="font0">at Pompen, and the celebrated pavement at Palestrina, with a bird’s-eye view of the Nile and its surroundings, is the finest,&nbsp;as well as the latest, example of the class. The conclusion to&nbsp;be drawn is that the Roman mosaic-workers of the early Empire&nbsp;owed much to Alexandrian models. Their finer works, however, were restricted in size, and formed small pictures isolated&nbsp;in geometrical pavements. Such mosaic-pictures were called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emblemata,</span><span class="font0"> and were often transported from the great centres&nbsp;of production to distant provinces, where pavements were&nbsp;prepared for their reception. The subjects of these </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emblemata,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">like those of the wall-paintings of Pompeii, were, for the most&nbsp;part, taken from Greek mythology, and it is not easy to determine what degree of originality is to be assigned to Roman&nbsp;artists. We note a certain interest in the great figures of&nbsp;literature and philosophy. A subject of which two somewhat&nbsp;different versions have been preserved, commonly known as&nbsp;“ The Academy of Plato,” shows us a group of Greek philosophers&nbsp;engaged in discussion. In provincial pavements it is not uncommon to find portraits of poets or philosophers used to fill&nbsp;ornamental schemes of decoration, as in the famous mosaic at&nbsp;Trier signed by Monnus. And it is possible to trace the growth&nbsp;of interest in Roman literature at the expense of that of Greece.&nbsp;Fig. 31 (Plate VI.) shows a mosaic discovered in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tabliiuim&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of a villa at Sousse (Susa) in Tunis (the ancient </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hadrumetum).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">It represents the poet Virgil seated, with a scroll on his knee,&nbsp;upon which is written </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aen.</span><span class="font0"> i. S; beside him stand the muses of&nbsp;tragedy and history. In one of the side-wings </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(alae)</span><span class="font0"> of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">atrium</span><span class="font0"> was a mosaic representing the parting of Aeneas from&nbsp;Dido, and this was no doubt balanced by another scene from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aencid.</span><span class="font0"> It has also been shown that the mythological i&nbsp;scenes depicted by the mosaic-workers of the later imperial&nbsp;period are frequently inspired, not by Greek poetry or even&nbsp;Greek artistic tradition, but by the works of Ovid; and thc&nbsp;popularity of the legend of Cupid and Psyche is doubtless to be&nbsp;traced to its literary treatment by Apuleius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mosaic shown in fig. 31 is notable for the simplicity of its composition; and it may be laid down as a general rule that&nbsp;the later workers in this field preferred such subjects, consisting&nbsp;of* few figures on a neutral background, which lend themselves&nbsp;to broad treatment, and are best suited to the genius of mosaic.&nbsp;The finer pavements discovered in the villas of the landed&nbsp;proprietors of the African provinces, Gaul, and even Britain,&nbsp;are distinguished by the excellent taste with which ornament&nbsp;and subject are adapted to the space at the disposal of the artist.&nbsp;Beside a well-chosen repertory of geometrical patterns, thc&nbsp;mosaic-workers make use of vegetable motives taken from the&nbsp;vine, the olive, the acanthus or the ivy, as well as conventional&nbsp;figures, such as the seasons,@@<sup>1</sup> the winds, the months and allegorical figures of all kinds, forming elements in a scheme of&nbsp;decoration which, though often of great richness, is never lacking in symmetry and sobriety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is much to be regretted that the destruction, partial or complete, of the great thermae and palaces of the early Empire&nbsp;has deprived us of the means of passing judgment on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">opus&nbsp;musivum</span><span class="font0"> proper (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mosaic), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the decoration of vaults&nbsp;and wall-surfaces with mosaics in glass, enamel or precious&nbsp;materials. Effective as are the pavements constructed with&nbsp;tesserae of marble or coloured stone, they must have been&nbsp;eclipsed by the brilliant hues of the wall-mosaics. We can&nbsp;form but little idea of these from the decoration of fountains&nbsp;at Pompeii and elsewhere, and must depend chiefly on the&nbsp;compositions which adorn the walls and apses of early Christian&nbsp;basilicas. An attempt has, indeed, been made to prove that&nbsp;one of these—the church of S. Maria Maggiore—is nothing else&nbsp;than a private basilica once belonging to a Roman palace, and&nbsp;that its mosaics date from the period of Septimius. Severus;@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>but it is impossible to accept this theory. The earliest monument of the class which we are now considering is the baptistery&nbsp;of S. Costanza at Rome, built by Constantine in the early years&nbsp;of the 4th century </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font0"> Unfortunately the mosaics of the&nbsp;cupola were destroyed in the 16th century, and we derive our&nbsp;knowledge of them from drawings made by Francesco d’Olanda.&nbsp;The tambour was decorated with a maritime landscape diversified with islands and filled with a crowd of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">putti</span><span class="font0"> fishing; and&nbsp;the cupola itself was divided into twelve compartments, containing figure-subjects, by acanthus motives and caryatids.&nbsp;The mosaics of the annular vault which surrounds the baptistery&nbsp;are extant, though much restored, and purely pagan in design,&nbsp;showing that thc decorative schemes (Eros and Psyche, vine-patterns, medallions, &amp;c.), commonly found in pavements were&nbsp;also used by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">musivarii.</span><span class="font0"> The mosaic-panels of the nave of&nbsp;S. Maria Maggiore already mentioned are (in the absence of&nbsp;earlier examples) very instructive as to the artistic quality&nbsp;of Roman </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">opus musivum.</span><span class="font0"> Richter and Taylor’s publication&nbsp;of some of the unrcstored portions, which unfortunately form&nbsp;but a small fraction of the whole, serve to show that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">musivarii</span><span class="font0"> had an accurate conception of the true function of mosaic&nbsp;destined to be seen at a distance. Thcir effects are produced&nbsp;by a bold use of simple means; a few large cubes of irregular&nbsp;shape serve to give just the broad impression of a human face&nbsp;or figure which suits the monumental Surroundingsand subdued&nbsp;light. Very remarkable is the success with which the atmospheric backgrounds are treated. To seek delicate gradations&nbsp;of tint by elaborate means would be waste of labour for the&nbsp;mosaic-worker, but the artists of S. Maria Maggiorc are able to&nbsp;produce sky and cloud effects (cf. Plate V. fig. 25) of great&nbsp;beauty, when seen from the floor of the church, with the aid&nbsp;of broad masses of colour. Their gamut of tones is of the&nbsp;richest; and it is to be remarked that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">no gold</span><span class="font0"> is used except in&nbsp;the restored parts. Doubtless gold was employed in decorative&nbsp;wall-mosaics before the Consfantinian period; but the Roman&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">musivarius</span><span class="font0"> knew the secret of making a true mosaic picture&nbsp;with natural tints alone.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0">(4) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Work in Precious Metals.—</span><span class="font0">In the article </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Plate</span><span class="font0"> the history of this branch of art in ancient times is treated, and it is there&nbsp;shown that it continued to be a living art, capable of producing&nbsp;works of the highest merit, in Roman times. The sections of&nbsp;Pliny’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Natural History</span><span class="font0"> (xxxiii. 154 sqq.) which treat of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">caelatura&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">deal only with the works of Greek artists, and Pliny ends with&nbsp;the statement that, as silver-chasing was in his time a lost art,&nbsp;specimens of embossed plate were valued according to their&nbsp;antiquity; but the extant remains of Roman plate suffice to&nbsp;disprove his statement, and in a previous passage (xxxiii. 139)&nbsp;he names the principal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ateliers</span><span class="font0"> where such works were produced.&nbsp;The famous treasure of Bosco Reale (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Plate)</span><span class="font0"> comprises&nbsp;specimens of silver-work belonging to various dates, &gt;many of&nbsp;which bear the inscription “ Maximae ”; this doubtless gives&nbsp;the name of the owner of the objects, whose skeleton was found&nbsp;near the treasure. But some of them had passed through&nbsp;other hands; for example, four “ salt-cellars,” probably of&nbsp;pre-Roman date, are also inscribed with the name of “ Pam-philus, the freedman of Caesar.” Certain pieces, too, seem&nbsp;older and more worn than others; two ewers, decorated with&nbsp;Victories sacrificing to Athena, are probably of Alexandrian&nbsp;origin—the lotus-flower on their handles most probably points&nbsp;to their Egyptian provenance. On the other hand, the various&nbsp;decorative styles characteristic of Augustan art are well represented,—not merely the elaborate and conventional plant-systems of the Ara Pacis Augustae, teeming with animal life,&nbsp;which adorn two splendid canthari, but also the naturalistic&nbsp;treatment of vegetable forms, of which a cup decorated with&nbsp;sprays of olive furnishes a good example (Plate VII. fig. 32).&nbsp;But the most important pieces in the collection are those which&nbsp;show the silversmith at work on specifically Roman subjects.&nbsp;Amongst the cups with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">emblemata</span><span class="font0"> (for thc meaning of the term&nbsp;see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Plate)</span><span class="font0"> were two which originally contained small portrait-busts of thc master and mistress of the house to which the&nbsp;collection belonged. Onc of these became detached, and is&nbsp;now in the British Museum; the other is in the Louvre in its&nbsp;original setting. The lady’s coiffure resembles that of the&nbsp;empresses of the later Julio-Claudian period; but this is not</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
