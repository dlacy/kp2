        <p><span class="font2">republic with Rome for her capital. The rhetorical idea of Cola di
                Rienzo became heroic in 1849. The constituent&nbsp;assembly (9th February 1849)
                proclaimed the fall of the&nbsp;temporal power of the popes, and the establishment
                of a&nbsp;republic which was to be not only of Rome but of all&nbsp;Italy. France,
                although then herself a republic, assumed&nbsp;the unenviable task of
                re-establishing the temporal power&nbsp;by force of arms. But the gallant defence of
                Rome by&nbsp;General Garibaldi covered the republic with glory. The&nbsp;enemy was
                repulsed, and the army of the Neapolitan king,&nbsp;sent to restore the pope, was
                also driven off. Then, however, France despatched a fresh and more powerful force
                ;&nbsp;Rome was vigorously besieged, and at last compelled to&nbsp;surrender. AVith
                June 1849 begins the new series of&nbsp;pontifical laws designed to restore the
                government of Pius&nbsp;IX., whose reign down to 1870 was that of an
                absolute&nbsp;sovereign. Then the Italian Government entered Rome&nbsp;(20th
                September 1870), proclaimed the national constitution (9th October 1870), and the
                Eternal City became the&nbsp;capital of Italy. Thus the scheme of national unity,
                the&nbsp;natural outcome of the history of Rome and of Italy,&nbsp;impossible of
                accomplishment under the rule of the popes,&nbsp;was finally achieved by the
                monarchy of Savoy, which, as&nbsp;the true representative and personification of
                Italian&nbsp;interests, has abolished the temporal power of the papacy&nbsp;and made
                Rome the seat of government of the united&nbsp;country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(p.

        <p>PART II.&mdash;TOPOGRAPHY AND ARCH&AElig;OLOGY.</p>
        <p><span class="font1">Rome@@<sup>1</sup> is situated (41° 53' 52&quot; N. Iat., 12° 28'
                40&quot; E. long.) on the banks of the Tiber, Italy, 14 miles from its present
                mouth, in&nbsp;a great plain of alluvial and marine deposit, broken into
                elevations&nbsp;by numerous masses of volcanic matter. The nine or ten hills
                and&nbsp;ridges on which the city stands are formed of masses of tufa or
                conglomerated sand and ashes thrown out by neighbouring volcanoes&nbsp;now extinct,
                but active down to a very recent period. One group&nbsp;of these volcanoes is that
                around Lago Bracciano, while another,&nbsp;still nearer to Rome, composes the Alban
                Hills. That some at&nbsp;least of these craters have been in a state of activity at
                no very&nbsp;distant period has been shown by the discovery at many places
                of&nbsp;broken pottery and bronze implements below the strata of tufa or&nbsp;other
                volcanic deposits. Traces of human life have even been found&nbsp;below that great
                flood of lava which, issuing from the Alban Hills,&nbsp;flowed towards the site of
                Rome, only stopping about 3 miles short,&nbsp;by the tomb of Cecilia
            Metella.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The superficial strata on which Rome is built are of three main kinds
                : (1) the plains and valleys on the left bank of the Tiber are&nbsp;covered, as it
                were, by a sea of alluvial deposit, in the midst of&nbsp;which (2) the hills of
                volcanic origin rise like so many islands ; and&nbsp;(3) on the right bank of the
                Tiber, around the Janiculan and Vatican&nbsp;Hills, are extensive remains of an
                ancient sea-beach, conspicuous&nbsp;in parts by its fine golden sand and its
                deposits of greyish white&nbsp;potter’s clay. From its yellow sand the Janiculan has
                been sometimes known as the Golden Hill, a name which survives in the&nbsp;church on
                its summit called S. Pietro in Montorio (Monte d’Oro).&nbsp;In addition to these
                three chief deposits, at a few places, especially&nbsp;in the Aventine and Pincian
                Hills, under-strata of travertine crop&nbsp;out—a hard limestone rock, once in
                solution in running water, and&nbsp;deposited gradually as the water lost its
                carbonic-acid solvent, a&nbsp;process still rapidly going on at Terni, Tivoli, and
                other places in&nbsp;the neighbourhood. The conditions under which the tufa
                hills&nbsp;were formed have been very various, as is clearly seen by an examination
                of the rock at different places. The volcanic ashes and&nbsp;sand of which the tufa
                is composed appear in parts to lie just as&nbsp;they were showered down from the
                crater ; in that case it shows&nbsp;but little sign of stratification, and consists
                wholly of igneous products. In parts time and pressure have bound together these
                scoriæ into a soft and friable rock ; in other places they still lie in loose sandy
                beds and can be dug out with the spade. Other masses&nbsp;of tufa again show signs
                either of having been deposited in water,&nbsp;or else washed away from their first
                resting-place and redeposited&nbsp;with visible stratifications ; this is shown by
                the water-worn pebbles&nbsp;and chips of limestone rock, which form a conglomerate
                bound&nbsp;together by the volcanic ashes into a sort of natural cement.
                A&nbsp;third variety is that which exists on the Palatine Hill. Here the&nbsp;shower
                of red-hot ashes has evidently fallen on a thickly-growin forest, and the burning
                wood, partly smothered by the ashes, has&nbsp;been converted into charcoal, large
                masses of which are embedded&nbsp;in the tufa rock. In some places charred branches
                of trees, their&nbsp;form well preserved, can be easily distinguished. The so-called
                “ wall of Romulus ” is built of this conglomerate of tufa and charred wood ; a very
                perfect section of the branch of a tree is visible on&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> one of the
                blocks by the Scalæ Caci.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">So great have been the physical changes in the site of Rome since the
                first dawn of the historic period that it is difficult now&nbsp;to realize what its
                aspect once was. The Forum Romanum, the&nbsp;Velabrum, the great Campus Martius (now
                the most crowded part&nbsp;of modern Rome), and other valleys were once almost
                impassable&nbsp;marshes or pools of water (0v., </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Fast.,</span><span class="font1"> vi. 401 ; Dionys., ii.
                50).&nbsp;The draining of these valleys was effected by means of the
                great&nbsp;cloacæ, which were among the earliest important architectural&nbsp;works
                of Rome (Vaιτo, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ling.
                Lat.,</span><span class="font1"> iv. 149). Again, the various&nbsp;hills and ridges
                were once more numerous and very much more&nbsp;abrupt than they are now. At an
                early period, when each hill&nbsp;was crowned by a separate village fort, the great
                object of the&nbsp;inhabitants was to increase the steepness of its cliffs and
                render&nbsp;access difficult. At a later time, when Rome was united under&nbsp;one
                government, the very physical peculiarities which had originally&nbsp;made its hills
                so populous, through their natural adaptability for&nbsp;defence, became extremely
                inconvenient in a united city, where&nbsp;architectural symmetry and splendour were
                above all things aimed&nbsp;at. Hence the most gigantic engineering works were
                undertaken :&nbsp;tops of hills were levelled, whole ridges cut away, and gentle
                slopes&nbsp;formed in the place of abrupt cliffs. The levelling of the
                Velia&nbsp;and the excavation of the site for Trajan’s forum are instances
                of&nbsp;this. The same works were continued in the Middle Ages, as&nbsp;when in the
                14th century an access was made to the Capitoline&nbsp;Arx @@<sup>2</sup> from the
                side of the Campus Martius ; up to that time a steep&nbsp;cliff had prevented all
                approach except from the side of the Forum.</span></p><div>
