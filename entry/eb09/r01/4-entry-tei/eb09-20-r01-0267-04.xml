<p>shortly afterwards bound apprentice to a mathematical instrument maker. He afterwards started business on his own account and acquired great celebrity as an artist. He died on 5th November 1800.</p><p>Ramsden’s speciality was divided circles, which began to supersede the quadrants in observatories towards the end of the 18th century. His most celebrated work was a 5-feet vertical circle, which was finished in 1789 and was used by Piazzi at Palermo in constructing his well-known catalogue of stars. He was the first to carry out in practice a method of reading oif angles (first suggested in 1768 by the duke of Chaulnes) by measuring the distance of the index from the nearest division line by means of a micrometer screw which moves one or two fine threads placed in the focus of a microscope. Ramsden’s transit instruments were the first which were illuminated through the hollow axis; the idea was suggested to him by Professor Usslier in Dublin.</p>
