<p><span class="font1">RAJA, the Hindu title for a chief, or prince, derived from the same root as the Latin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rex. </span><span class="font1">Other forms are rao, rana and&nbsp;rawal, while chiefs of high rank are styled maharaja, maharao&nbsp;and maharana. The Hindustani form is rai, and the title of&nbsp;the Hindu emperor of Vijayanagar in S. India was raya. It&nbsp;is not confined to the rulers of native states, being conferred&nbsp;by the British government on Hindu subjects, sometimes as an&nbsp;hereditary distinction. In the form of rao it appears as a&nbsp;suffix to the names of most Mahrattas, and to the names of&nbsp;Kanarese Brahmans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAJAHMUNDRY, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rajamahendri,</span><span class="font1"> a town of British India, in the Godavari district of Madras. Pop. (1901) 36, 408.&nbsp;It stands on the left bank of the river Godavari, at the head of&nbsp;the delta, 360 m. N. of Madras, and has a station on the East&nbsp;Coast railway, which is here carried across the river by a bridge&nbsp;of 56 spans. The government college is one of the four provincial schools established in 1853. There are also a training&nbsp;college and high school. Carpets, rugs and wooden wares are&nbsp;manufactured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tradition divides the merit of founding Rajahmundry between the Orissa and Chalukya princes. In 1470 it was wrested from Orissa by the Mahommedans, but early in the 16th century&nbsp;it was retaken by Krishna Raja. It continued under Hindu&nbsp;rule till 1572, when it yielded to the Moslems of the Deccan&nbsp;under Rafat Khan. It passed into the possession of the French&nbsp;in 1753, but they were driven out by the British under Colonel&nbsp;Forde in 1758.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAJASTHANI (properly </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rājasthānî,</span><span class="font1"> the language of Räjasthãn of Rajputana), an Indo-Aryan vernacular closely&nbsp;related to Gujarati (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q. v.</span><span class="font1"> ). It is spoken in Rajputana and&nbsp;the adjoining parts of central India, and has several dialects&nbsp;the principal of which are Jaipurī, Mārwāṛī, Mēwātī and&nbsp;Mālvī. Hāṛauṭī, an important variety of Jaipurī, is spoken in&nbsp;the states of Kota and Bundi. Carey, the well-known Seram-pur missionary, paid great attention to Rajasthani in the early&nbsp;part of the 19th century, translating the New Testament into&nbsp;no fewer than six dialects, viz. Hāṛauṭī, Ujainī (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> Mīlvī),&nbsp;Udaipurī (a form of Mãrwãp), Mãrwãp proper, Jaipurī proper&nbsp;and Bîkänërï (another form of Mãrwãp). In 1901 the total&nbsp;number of speakers of Rājasthānī was 10,917,712. (G. A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gr. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAJGARH, a native state of central India, in the Bhopal agency. Area, 940 sq. m. Pop. (1901) 88, 376, showing a&nbsp;decrease of 26% in the decade, due to the results of famine.&nbsp;Estimated revenue, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">£33, 000;</span><span class="font1"> tribute (to Sindhia), £3640.&nbsp;The chief, whose title is rawat, is a Rajput of the Umat clan.&nbsp;Grain and opium are the principal articles of trade. The town&nbsp;of Rajgarh, which is surrounded by a battlemented wall, had a&nbsp;population of 5399 in 1901.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAJKOT, India, capital of a native state in Bombay, and headquarters of the political agent for Kathiawar. Pop. (1901)&nbsp;36, 151. It is situated in the middle of the peninsula of Kathia-war, and is the centre of the railway system. There is a military&nbsp;cantonment. The Rajkumar college, for the education of the&nbsp;sons of chiefs on the lines of an English public school, has achieved&nbsp;great success. Besides the high school there are training&nbsp;colleges for masters and mistresses. The Rasulkhanji hospital&nbsp;has a department for women, opened in 1897. All these institutions are maintained at the joint expense of the chiefs of Kathiawar. The state of Rajkot, which is a branch of Nawanagar,&nbsp;has an area of 282 sq. m. Pop. (1901) 49, 795. Estimated&nbsp;revenue, £20,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAJMAHAL, a former capital of Bengal, India, now a village in the district of the Santal Parganas, situated on the right&nbsp;bank of the Ganges, where that river makes a turn to the south.&nbsp;Pop. (1901) 2047. It was chosen for his residence by Man&nbsp;Singh, Akbar’s Rajput general in 1592, but the capital of the&nbsp;province was shortly afterwards transferred to Dacca. It&nbsp;contains many palaces and mosques, now in ruins and over-grown with jungle. It has a station on the loop line of the East&nbsp;Indian railway, but trade has declined since the Ganges abandoned its old bed; and Sahibganj has taken its place. Rajmahal&nbsp;has given its name to a range of hills, almost the only hills in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Bengal proper, which here come down close to the bank of the Ganges. They cover a total area of 1366 sq. m., and their&nbsp;height never exceeds 2000 ft. They are inhabited by an aboriginal race, known as Paharias or “hill-men, ” of whom two&nbsp;tribes may be distinguished: the Male Sauria Paharias and the&nbsp;Mal Paharias; total pop. (1901) 73,000. The former, if not the&nbsp;latter also, are closely akin to the larger tribe of Oraons. Their&nbsp;language, known as Malto, of the Dravidian family, was spoken&nbsp;by 60, 777 persons in 1901. The Paharias have contributed an&nbsp;element to the administrative history of Bengal. Augustus&nbsp;Clevland, a civilian who died in 1784 and whose name is still&nbsp;honoured, was the first who succeeded in winning their confidence and recruiting among them a corps of hill-rangers. The&nbsp;methods that he adopted are the foundation of the “ non-regulation ” system, established in 1796; and the hills were&nbsp;exempted from the permanent settlement. The Santals, a&nbsp;different aboriginal race, have since immigrated in large numbers&nbsp;into the Daman-i-koh, or “ skirts of the hills but the Paharias&nbsp;alone occupy the plateaux on the top, where they arc per-mitted to practise the privilege of shifting cultivation, which&nbsp;renders scientific forestry impossible. The approach from the&nbsp;plains below to each plateau is guarded by a steep ladder of&nbsp;boulders.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAJPIPLA, a native state of India, in the Rewa Kantha agency, Bombay, occupying a hilly tract between the rivers&nbsp;Nerbudda and Tapti; area, 1517 sq. m. Pop. (1901) 117,175,&nbsp;showing a decrease of 32% in the decade, due to the results of&nbsp;famine; estimated revenue, £60, 000; tribute (to the Gaekwar&nbsp;of Baroda), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">£3000.</span><span class="font1"> The chief, whose title is maharana, is a&nbsp;Gohel Rajput, of the same family as the thakor saheb of Bhau-nagar. A light railway, constructed at the cost of the state,&nbsp;connects Nandod with Anklesvar in Broach district. The old&nbsp;fort of Rajpipla, in the hills, is now deserted. The modern&nbsp;capital is Nandod, situated on the river Karjan, 32 m. from&nbsp;Surat. Pop. (1901) 11, 236.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAJPUT, a race of India, not confined to Rajputana, but spread over the N. of the country. According to the census of&nbsp;1901 there were 9,712,156 Rajputs in all India, of whom only&nbsp;620,229 lived in Rajputana. The great majority adhere to the&nbsp;Hindu religion, but 1,875,387 are entered as Mahommedans.&nbsp;The Rajputs form the fighting, landowning and ruling caste.&nbsp;They claim to be the modem representatives of the Kshatriyas&nbsp;of ancient tradition; but their early history is obscure, and&nbsp;recent research supports the view that they include descendants&nbsp;of more than one wave of immigrant invaders. Linguistic&nbsp;evidence supports tradition in proving that their unity was&nbsp;broken up by the Mahommedan conquest, for the inhabitants&nbsp;of the Himalayan valleys still speak a language akin to those of&nbsp;Rajputana proper, though separated from them by the wide&nbsp;Gangetic valley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Rajputs are fine, brave men, and retain the feudal instinct strongly developed. Pride of blood is their chief characteristic,&nbsp;and they are most punctilious on all points of etiquette. The&nbsp;tradition of common ancestry permits a poor Rajput yeoman to&nbsp;consider himself as well born as any powerful landholder of his&nbsp;clan, and superior to any high official of the professional classes.&nbsp;No race in India can boast of finer feats of arms or brighter deeds&nbsp;of chivalry, and they form one of the main recruiting fields for&nbsp;the Indian army of to-day. They consider any occupation&nbsp;other than that of arms or government derogatory to their&nbsp;dignity, and consequently during the long period of peace which&nbsp;has followed the establishment of the British rule in India they&nbsp;have been content to stay idle at home instead of taking up any&nbsp;of the other professions in which they might have come to the&nbsp;front. Those who are not zamindars have, therefore, rather&nbsp;dropped behind in the modern struggle for existence. As&nbsp;cultivators they are lazy and indifferent, and they prefer pastoral&nbsp;to agricultural pursuits. Looking upon all manual labour as&nbsp;humiliating, none but the poorest class of Rajput will himself&nbsp;hold the plough.</span></p>
