<p><span class="font1">In recent years much has been done in Russia and India towards the prevention of rinderpest by inoculation and the&nbsp;use of immunizing sera. In South Africa the bile method (or&nbsp;the injection of bile obtained from cattle dead of rinderpest),&nbsp;discovered by Koch, in 1896; bile with admixture of glycerine,&nbsp;recommended by Edington; the simultaneous injection of serum&nbsp;and rinderpest blood, introduced by Turner and Kolle in 1897,&nbsp;and repeated injection of fortified serum alone, have been&nbsp;employed, more or less successfully, in conferring immunity. But&nbsp;elsewhere the main line of action has been in the direction of&nbsp;preventing the introduction of the disease by prohibiting the&nbsp;importation of cattle from infected countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RING (O.E. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hring·,</span><span class="font1"> a word common to Teutonic languages,@@<sup>1 </sup>and probably cognate with the Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">circus,</span><span class="font1"> Gr. Ktpxos or Kptxos,&nbsp;Skt. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chakra,</span><span class="font1"> wheel, circle, cf. also “ harangue ”), in art, a band&nbsp;of circular shape of varying sizes, made of any material and used&nbsp;for various purposes, but, particularly, a circular band of gold,&nbsp;silver or other precious or decorative material used as an ornament, not only for the finger, but also for the ear (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Earring),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or even for the nose, where it is still worn by certain races in&nbsp;India and Africa. The word is also used of many objects which&nbsp;in structure take the shape of a circle or hoop, such as the tracheal&nbsp;rings, the circular-shaped bands of cartilage in the walls of the&nbsp;windpipe, the “ annual rings,” or concentric layers of wood&nbsp;produced each year in the trunks of trees, &amp;c. In transferred&nbsp;senses “ ring ” is also applied to an enclosed space, whether&nbsp;circular, oval or otherwise: hence to the arena of a circus or&nbsp;hippodrome, the enclosure for a boxing contest, or to the place&nbsp;on a racecourse reserved for the bookmakers for the purpose of&nbsp;betting. A particular application in a transferred sense is that&nbsp;to a combination of persons in trade for the purpose of controlling markets, prices, etc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the art sense (see also </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gems),</span><span class="font1"> the English and German “ring ” corresponds to the Gr. Ôακτύλιos, Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">annulus,</span><span class="font1"> Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">anneau.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The enlarged part of a ring on which the device is engraved is&nbsp;called the “ bezel,” the rest of it being the “ hoop.” To decorate&nbsp;the human finger with a ring, if possible with one combining&nbsp;beauty, value and a distinctive character, was a widely spread&nbsp;natural impulse. At an early period, when the art of writing&nbsp;was known to but very few, it was commonly the custom for men&nbsp;to wear rings on which some distinguishing sign or badge was&nbsp;engraved </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(νκίσημον),</span><span class="font1"> so that by using it as a seal the owner could&nbsp;give a proof of authenticity to letters or other documents. Thus,&nbsp;when some royal personage wished to delegate his power to one&nbsp;of his officials, it was not unusual for him to hand over his signet&nbsp;ring, by means of which the full royal authority could be given&nbsp;to the written commands of the subordinate (cf. Gen. xli. 42;&nbsp;Esth. viii. 2). Among the Battas of Sumatra rings of a certain&nbsp;form are used to this day as passports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The earliest existing rings are naturally those found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. The finest examples date from about&nbsp;the XVIIIth to the XXth Dynasty; they are of pure&nbsp;gold, simple in design, very heavy and massive, and have&nbsp;usually the name and titles of the owner deeply sunk in&nbsp;hieroglyphic characters on an oblong gold bezel. Rings worn in&nbsp;Egypt by the poorer classes were made of less costly materials,&nbsp;such as silver, bronze, glass or pottery covered with a siliceous&nbsp;glaze and coloured brilliant blue or green with various copper&nbsp;oxides. Some of these had hieroglyphic inscriptions impressed&nbsp;while the clay was moist. Other examples have been found&nbsp;made of ivory, amber and hard stones, such as carnelian.&nbsp;Another form of ring used in the XIIth and subsequent dynasties&nbsp;of Egypt had a scarab in place of the bezel, and was mounted on&nbsp;a gold hoop which passed through the hole in the scarab and allowed it to revolve.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">In ancient Babylonia and Assyria finger rings do not appear to have been used. In those countries the signet took a different&nbsp;form, namely, that of a cylinder cut in crystal or other&nbsp;hard stone, and perforated from end to end. A cord&nbsp;was passed through it, and it was worn on the wrist&nbsp;like a bracelet. This way of wearing the signet is more than&nbsp;once alluded to in the Old Testament (Gen. xxxviii. 18,&nbsp;R.V., and Cant. viii. 6).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Within the limits necessarily imposed by its purpose the finger ring assumed a considerable variety of form, according to its date&nbsp;and place of origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the Cretan and Mycenaean periods a characteristic form of ring had a broad flat bezel, not organically connected with&nbsp;the hoop, and having an incised design in the gold. The&nbsp;use of inset stones hardly occurs, but rings from Enkomi and&nbsp;Aegina of the late Mycenaean period have inset paste decorations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Phoenician type of ring was primarily intended to carry a scarab or scarabaeoid, usually in a box setting on a swivel,&nbsp;called for by the fact that the flat base of the scarab would be&nbsp;wanted for sealing purposes, but in wear would be most conveniently turned inwards. Strength being necessary, the hoop&nbsp;became massive. A similar arrangement of the signet-scarab&nbsp;is found attached to a twisted ring, which, from its shape, must&nbsp;have been meant to be suspended, and which is shown thus worn&nbsp;on some of the Cypriote terra-cottas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Greek ring of an early period has a characteristic flattened bezel, for an intaglio design in the gold. Such engravings attained&nbsp;great freedom and beauty in the 5th and 4th centuries B.C.. An&nbsp;alternative form was a swivel ring for a séarab or scarabaeoid,&nbsp;imitating the Phoenician shape. When the stone was flat and&nbsp;inset the bezel became a mass of metal to hold it securely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the Greeks signet rings were very largely worn. In Sparta a sumptuary law was passed at an early time to forbid&nbsp;any substance more valuable than iron to be used for&nbsp;signet rings; but in other parts of the Hellenic world&nbsp;there appears to have been no restriction of this sort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In some of the numerous tombs of Etruria and Kertch (Panti-capaeum) in the Cimmerian Bosphorus gold rings of great magnificence have been discovered, apparently of the finest&nbsp;Greek workmanship.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> “ To ring,” in the sense of to make a bell sound, is a different word. It also appears in various Teutonic languages and is probably of onomatopoeic origin, and may be akin to Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">clangor.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
