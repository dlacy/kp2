<p><span class="font0">ed ſacrifices to the god, and conſecrated the place of their retreat, they returned to Rome, led by their new&nbsp;magiſtrates and the deputies of the ſenate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus the Roman conſtitution, which had originally been monarchic, and from thence had paſſed into an&nbsp;ariſtocracy, began now to verge towards a democracy.&nbsp;The tribunes immediately after their election obtained&nbsp;permiſſion from the ſenate to elect two perſons as their&nbsp;miniſters or aſſiſtants, who ſhould eaſe them a little in&nbsp;the great multiplicity of their affairs. Theſe were called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebeian tedilei ;</span><span class="font0"> and afterw<sup>τ</sup>ards came to have the in-ſpection of the public baths, aqueducts, with many&nbsp;other offices originally belonging to the conſuls, after&nbsp;which they were called ſimply </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tdiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All oppoſition to the making of regular levies being now at an end, the conſul Cominius led an army againſt the Volſci. He defeated them in battle, and&nbsp;took from them Longula and Poluſca ; after which he&nbsp;beſieged Corioli, a city ſtrongly fortified, and which&nbsp;might be called their capital. He carried this place,&nbsp;and gained a victory over the Antiates, the ſame day ;&nbsp;but Caius Marcius, an eminent patrician, had all the&nbsp;glory of both actions. The troops detached by the&nbsp;conſul to ſcale the walls of Corioli being repulſed in&nbsp;their firſt aſſault, Marcius rallied the runaways, led&nbsp;them on afreſh to the charge, drove back the enemy&nbsp;within their walls, and, entering the city with them,&nbsp;made himſelf maſter of it. This exploit atchieved, he&nbsp;with all expedition put himſelf iιr the foremoſt ranks of&nbsp;the conſul’s main army, that was juſt going to engage&nbsp;with the Antiates, who were come to the relief of the&nbsp;place ; and there he behaved with equal bravery, and&nbsp;had equal ſucceſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next day the conſul, having erected his tribunal before his tent, called the ſoldiers together. His whole&nbsp;ſpeech to them was little more than a panegyric upon&nbsp;Marcius. He put a crown upon his head ; aſſigned&nbsp;him a tenth part of all the ſpoil ; and, in the name of&nbsp;the republic, made him a preſent of a fine horſe with&nbsp;ſtately furniture, giving him leave at the ſame time to&nbsp;chooſe out any ten of the priſoners for himſelf ; and&nbsp;laſtly, he allotted him as much money as he could carry&nbsp;away. Of all theſe offers Marcius accepted only the&nbsp;horſe, and one captive of the ten, an old friend of his&nbsp;family, that he might give him his liberty. To add&nbsp;to the glory of the brave warrior, the conſul beſtowed&nbsp;on him the ſurname of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Coriolanus,</span><span class="font0"> transferring thereby&nbsp;from himſelf to Marcius all the honour of the conqueſt&nbsp;of Corioli. Cominius, at his return to Rome, diffland∙&nbsp;ed his army ; and war was ſucceeded by works of religion, public games, and treaties of peace. A cenſus&nbsp;and a luſtrum cloſed the events of this memorable con-fulſhip. There appeared to be in Rome at this time no&nbsp;more than 110,000 men fit to bear arms; a number by&nbsp;many thouſands leſs than at the laſt enrollment. Donbt-leſs great numbers had run away to avoid being ſlaves</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to their creditors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under the following adminiſtration of T. Geganius and P. Minucius, Rome was terribly afflicted by a famine, occaſioned chiefly by the neglect of ploughing&nbsp;and ſowing during the late troubles ; for the ſedition&nbsp;had happened after the autumnal equinox, about ſow-ing-time, and the accommodation was not made till&nbsp;juſt before the winter ſolſtice. The ſenate diſpatched&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">agents into Hetruria, Campania, the country of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">Volſci, and even into Sicily, to buy corn. Thoſe </span><span class="font1">who </span><span class="font0">embarked for Sicily met with a tempeſt which retarded&nbsp;their arrival at Syracuſe ; where they were conſtrained&nbsp;to paſs the winter. At Cumæ, the tyrant Ariſtodemus ſeized the money brought by the commiſſaries ;&nbsp;and they themſelves with difficulty ſaved their lives by&nbsp;flight. The Volſei, far from being diſpoſed to ſuc-cour the Romans, would have marched againſt them,&nbsp;if a ſudden and moſt deſtructive peſtilence had not defeated their purpoſe. In Hetruria alone the Roman&nbsp;commiſſaries met with ſucceſs. They ſent a conſiderable quantity of grain ſrom thence to Rome in barks :&nbsp;but this was in a ſhort time conſumed, and the miſery&nbsp;became exceſſive : the people were reduced to eat any&nbsp;thing they could get ; and nature in ſo great extremity&nbsp;loathed nothing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During this diſtreſe a deputation came from Velitræ a Volſcian city, where the Romans had formerly planted a colony, repreſenting that nine parts in ten of its&nbsp;inhabitants had been ſwept away by </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">plague, and&nbsp;praying the Romans to ſend a new colony to re-people&nbsp;it. The conſcript fathers without much heſitation granted the requeſt, preſſed the departure of the colony, and&nbsp;without delay named three leaders to conduct it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The people at firſt were very well pleaſed with the propoſal, as it gave them a proſpect of relief in their&nbsp;hunger : but when they reflected on the terrible havoc&nbsp;the plague had made among the old inhabitants of Velitræ, they began to ſear that the place might be ſtill&nbsp;infected ; and this apprehenſion became ſo univerſal,&nbsp;that not one of them would conſent to go thither.&nbsp;Nevertheleſs the ſenate at length publiſhed a decree&nbsp;that all the citizens ſhould draw lots ; and that thoſe&nbsp;to whoſe lot it ſell to be of the colony ſhould inſtantly&nbsp;march for Velitræ, or ſuffer the ſevereſt puniſhments&nbsp;for their diſobedience : ſear and hunger made the people&nbsp;comply ; and the fathers, a few days after, ſent away a&nbsp;ſecond colony to Norba, a conſiderable city of Latium.&nbsp;But the patricians were diſappointed as to the benefit&nbsp;they expected from theſe meaſures. The plebeians who&nbsp;remained in Rome being more and more preſſed by&nbsp;hunger and want, grew daily more angry with the ſe-nate. At firſſ they aſſembled in ſmall companies to&nbsp;vent their wrath in abuſive complaints ; and at length,&nbsp;in one great body, ruffled all together into the forum,&nbsp;calling out upon their tribunes for ſuccour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tribunes made it their buſineſs to heighten the general diſcontent. Having convened the people, Spu-rius Icilius, chief of the college of tribunes, inveighed&nbsp;moſt bitterly againſt the ſenate ; and when he had end?&nbsp;ed his harangue, exhorted others to ſpeak freely their&nbsp;thoughts ; particularly, and by name, calling upon Brutus and Sicinius, the ringleaders of the former ſedition,&nbsp;and now ædiles. Theſe men, far from attempting to&nbsp;extinguiſh the fire, added freſh fuel to it : And the&nbsp;more to inflame the ſpirits of the multitude, they enumerated all the paſt inſults which the people had ſuffer-ed from the nobles. Brutus concluded his harangue&nbsp;with loudly threatening, that if the plebeians would follow his advice, he would ſoon oblige thoſe men who&nbsp;had cauſed the preſent calamity to find a remedy for&nbsp;it ; after which the aſſembly was diſmiſſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next day, the conſuls, greatly alarmed at this commotion, and apprehending from the menaces of&nbsp;Brutus ſome very miſehievous event, thought it advi-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
