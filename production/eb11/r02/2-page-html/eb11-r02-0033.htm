<p><span class="font1">said Motowori (18th century), “ the Mikado is the child of the Sun-goddess.” (5) The dead hero (historical or&nbsp;mythic) signalizes his power by gracious saving acts; and&nbsp;Heracles, Asclepius, Amphiaraus, and others pass into the&nbsp;ranks of the gods, which are thus continually recruited from&nbsp;below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">HI. A third great group rises out of the sentiments and affections of man, or the moral energies which he secs working&nbsp;in human life. (1) The Vedic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Craddhä,</span><span class="font1"> “ faith,” the Greek&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Metameleia,</span><span class="font1"> “repentance,”@@<sup>1</sup> the Latin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spes,</span><span class="font1"> and a band of other&nbsp;figures, represent the dispositions of the heart; Nemesis and&nbsp;Nike and Concordia and their kin belong to a somewhat different&nbsp;sphere, the divine powers avenging, conquering, harmonizing&nbsp;the counterparts of the “ departmental ” gods in the field of&nbsp;moral agencies. (2) Over these theological speculation erects&nbsp;a few lofty and impressive forms; sometimes below the highest,&nbsp;like Vohu Mano, “ the Good Mind ” of Ahura Mazda; or the&nbsp;Bodhisattva Avalokitccvara, who vowed not to enter into final&nbsp;peace till every creature had received the saving truth; sometimes supreme, like Brahma or Prajapati (“ lord of creatures ”)&nbsp;in the early Brahmanic theology; or Adi Buddha, or the&nbsp;Zervan Akarana, “ boundless time,” of a kind of Persian&nbsp;gnosticism; or the Geôs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">νψιστος</span><span class="font1"> whose worship appears among&nbsp;other syncretistic cults of the Roman empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Order of Nature.—</span><span class="font1">Polytheism is here on the way to monotheism, and this tendency receives significant support&nbsp;from the recognition of an order in nature which is the ground&nbsp;and framework of social ethics. Not only does a sky-god like&nbsp;Varuna, or a sun-god like the Babylonian Shamash, survey all&nbsp;human things, and take cognizance of the evil-doer, but the daily&nbsp;course of the world is itself the expression of an intellectual and&nbsp;moral power. In the Chinese combination of Heaven and Earth&nbsp;as the parents and nourishers of all things, the energy and&nbsp;action lie with Tien, Earth being docile and receptive. Tien&nbsp;is intelligent and all-observing, and its “ sincerity ” or steadfastness, displayed in the courses of the sun and moon and the&nbsp;succession of the seasons, becomes the basis of right human&nbsp;conduct, personal and social. The “ way ” of Heaven, the&nbsp;“ course ” of Heaven, the “ lessons ” of Heaven, the law or&nbsp;“ decree ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ming)</span><span class="font1"> of Heaven, are constantly cited as the pattern&nbsp;for the emperor and his subjects. This conception is even&nbsp;reflected in human nature: “ Heaven in giving birth to the&nbsp;multitude of the people, to every faculty and relationship affixed&nbsp;its laws ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Shi King,</span><span class="font1"> III. iii. 6; cf. IV. iii. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2,</span><span class="font1"> tr. Legge), and the&nbsp;“ Grand Unity ” forms the source of all moral order </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Li Ki,</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sacred Books of lhe East,</span><span class="font1"> xxvii. p. 387). Indian thought presented this Order in a semi-personal form. The great elemental&nbsp;gods imposed their laws </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(dhaman, dharman, vrata)</span><span class="font1"> on the&nbsp;visible objects of nature, the flow of rivers, the march of the&nbsp;heavenly bodies across the sky. But the idea of Law was&nbsp;generalized in the figure of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rita</span><span class="font1"> (what is “ fitted ” or “ fixed&nbsp;or the “ course ” or “ path ” which is traversed), whose Zend&nbsp;equivalent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asha</span><span class="font1"> shows that the conception had been reached&nbsp;before the separation of the Eastern Aryans produced the&nbsp;migrations into India and Iran.@@<sup>2</sup> In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rig Veda</span><span class="font1"> the gods&nbsp;(even those of storm) are again and again described as “born&nbsp;from the Rita,” or born in it, according to it, or of it. Even&nbsp;Heaven and Earth rejoice in the womb or lap of the Rita. In&nbsp;virtue of the mystic identity between the cosmic phenomena&nbsp;and sacrifice, Rita may be also viewed as the principle of the&nbsp;cultus; and from that sphere it passes into conduct and&nbsp;acquires the meaning of morality and is equated with what is&nbsp;“ true.” The fundamental idea remains the same in the Zend&nbsp;Asha, its philological counterpart, but it is applied with a&nbsp;difference. Its form is more personal, for Asha is one of the six&nbsp;Holy Immortals round the throne of Ahura Mazda (Auramazda).&nbsp;In the primeval conflict between the powers of good and evil,&nbsp;the Bounteous Spirit chose Asha, the Righteous Order which</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">knit the world together and maintained the stars.@@<sup>3</sup> The immediacy of the relation between Ahura and Asha is implied in the statements that Ahura created Asha and that he dwells&nbsp;in the paths which proceed from Asha; and when he created&nbsp;the inspired word of Reason, Asha consented with him in his&nbsp;deed. In its ritual form Asha becomes the principle of sacrifice,&nbsp;and hence of holiness, first ritual and then moral. Like Rita,&nbsp;it rises into an object of worship, and in its most exalted aspect&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Asha vahisia,</span><span class="font1"> the “ best ” Asha, most excellent righteousness)&nbsp;it is identified with Ahura himself, being fourth among his&nbsp;sacred names </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Orrnazd Yasht,</span><span class="font0"> § 7; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">S.B.E.</span><span class="font1"> xxiii. p. 25).&nbsp;Egyptian speculation, in like manner, impersonated the conceptions of physical and moral order as two sides of a fundamental unity in the goddess Maât. Derived from the verb </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mä,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">“ to stretch out,” her name denoted the ideas of right and rule,&nbsp;and covered the notions of order, law, justice and truth, which&nbsp;remained steadfast and unalterable. Mythologically she was&nbsp;the daughter (or the eye) of the sun-god Re; but she bçcame&nbsp;Lady of Heaven and Queen of Earth, and even Lady of the&nbsp;land of the West, the mysterious habitation of the dead. Each&nbsp;of the great gods was said to be lord or master of Maât; but&nbsp;from another point of view she “ knew no lord or master,” and&nbsp;the particular quality of deity was expressed in the phrase&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">anx em maät,</span><span class="font1"> “ living by Maât,” which was applied to the gods&nbsp;of the physical world, the sun and moon, the days and hours,&nbsp;as well as to the divine king. She was solemnly offered by the&nbsp;sovereign to his god; and the deity replied by laying her within&nbsp;the heart of his worshipper “to manifest her everlastingly&nbsp;before the gods.” So in the famous scene of the weighing of the&nbsp;soul, which first appears pictorially under the New Empire, she&nbsp;introduces the deceased before the forty-two assessors of the&nbsp;heavenly judge, Osiris, and presides over the scale in which his&nbsp;actions and life are weighed. From the zenith to the realm&nbsp;of the departed she is the “queen of all gods and goddesses.”@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>The Hellenic polytheism of Homer and Hesiod is already at&nbsp;work upon similar ideas, and a whole group of mythic personifications slowly rises into view representing different phases&nbsp;of the same fundamental conception. Themis (root 0e=Sanskr.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dha,</span><span class="font1"> as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dhäman)</span><span class="font1"> appears in Homer as the embodiment of&nbsp;what is fit or right;@@<sup>5</sup> she convenes or dismisses assemblies, she&nbsp;even keeps order at the banquet of the gods. Next, Hesiod&nbsp;supplies a significant biography. She is the daughter of Ouranos&nbsp;and Gaia; and after Metis she becomes the bride of Zeus.@@<sup>6</sup>&nbsp;Pindar describes her as born in a golden car from the primeval&nbsp;Oceanus, source of all things, to the sacred height of Olympus&nbsp;to be the consort of Zeus the saviour; and she bears the same&nbsp;august epithet, as the symbol of social justice and the refuge&nbsp;for the oppressed.@@<sup>7</sup> Law was thus the spouse of the sovereign&nbsp;of the sky, but Aeschylus identified her with the Earth&nbsp;(worshipped at Athens as Ge-Themis), not only the kindly&nbsp;Mother, but the goddess who bound herself by fixed rules or&nbsp;laws of nature and life.@@<sup>8</sup> For the cultus of the earth as the&nbsp;source of fertility was associated with the maintenance of the&nbsp;family, with the operations of agricuiture and the social order&nbsp;of marriage. So Themis became the mother of the seasons;&nbsp;the regular sequence of blossom and fruit was her work; and&nbsp;Good Order, Justice and Peace were her offspring.@@<sup>9</sup> By such&nbsp;conceptions the Hellenic polytheism was moralized; the&nbsp;physical character of the greater gods fell into the background,&nbsp;and the sculptor’s art came to the aid of the poet by completely&nbsp;enduing them with personality.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
