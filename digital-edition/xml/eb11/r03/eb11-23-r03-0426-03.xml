               <p>                   <label>ROCHEFORT, HENRI</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Marquis de Rochefort-Luçay</hi>
                    (1830- ), French politician, was born in Paris on the 30th of January 1830. His father was
                    a Legitimist noble who as “ Edmond Rochefort ” was well known as a writer of vaudevilles;
                    his mother’s views were republican. After experience as a medical student, a clerk at the
                    Hôtel de VUle, a playwright and a journalist, he joined the staff of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Figaro</hi> in 1863; but a series of his articles, afterwards published as <hi
                        rend="italic">Les Français de la Décadence</hi> (3 vols., 1866-68), brought the paper
                    into collision with the authorities and caused the termination of his engagement. In
                    collaboration with different dramatists he had meanwhile written a long series of
                    successful vaudevilles, which began with the <hi rend="italic">Monsieur bien mis</hi> at
                    the Folies Dramatiques in 1856. On leaving the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi> Rochefort
                    determined to start a paper of his own, <hi rend="italic">La Lanterne.</hi> The paper was
                    seized on its eleventh appearance, and in August 1868 Rochefort was fined 10,000 francs,
                    with a year’s imprisonment. He then published his paper in Brussels, whence it was
                    smuggled into France. Printed in French, English, Spanish, Italian and German, it went the
                    round of Europe. After a second prosecution he fled to Belgium. A series of duels, of
                    which the most famous was one fought with Paul de Cassagnac a propos of an article on Joan
                    of Arc, kept Rochefort in the public eye. In 1869, after two unsuccessful candidatures, he
                    was returned to the Chamber of Deputies by the first circonscription of Paris. He was
                    arrested on the frontier, only to be almost immediately released, and forthwith took his
                    seat. He renewed his onslaught on the empire, starting a new paper, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Marseillaise,</hi> as the organ of political meetings arranged by himself at La
                    Villette. The staff was appointed on the votes of the members, and included Victor Noir
                    and Pascal Grousset. The violent articles in this paper led to the duel which resulted in
                    Victor Noir’s death at the hands of Prince Pierre Bonaparte. The paper was seized, and
                    Rochefort and Grousset were sent to prison for six months. The revolution of September was
                    the signal for his release. He became a member of the government of National Defence, but
                    this short association with the forces of law and order was soon broken on account of his
                    openly expressed sympathy with the Communards. On the nth of May 1871 he fled in disguise
                    from Paris. A week earlier he had resigned with a handful of other deputies from the
                    National Assembly ratjier than countenance the dismemberment of France. Arrested at Meaux
                    by the Versailles government, he was detained for some time in prison with a nervous
                    illness before he was condemned under military law to imprisonment for life. In spite of
                    Victor Hugo’s efforts on his behalf he was transported to New Caledonia. In 1874 he
                    escaped on board an American vessel to San Francisco. He lived in London and Geneva until
                    the general amnesty permitted his return to France in 1880. In Geneva he resumed the
                    publication of <hi rend="italic">La Lanterne,</hi> and in the Parisian papers articles
                    constantly appeared from his pen. When at length in 1880 the general amnesty</p>                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0427" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0460.jp2"/>
               <p>permitted his return to Paris he founded <hi rend="italic">L'Intransigeant</hi> in the
                    Radical and Socialist interest. For a short time in 1885-86 he sat in the Chamber of
                    Deputies, but found a great opportunity next year for his talent for inflaming public
                    opinion in the Boulangist agitation. He was condemned to detention in a fortress in August
                    1889 at the same time as General Boulanger, whom he had followed into exile. He continued
                    his polemic from London, and after the suicide of General Boulanger he attacked M.
                    Constans, minister of the interior in the Freycinet cabinet, with the utmost violence, in
                    a series of articles which led to an interpellation in the chamber in circumstances of
                    wild excitement and disorder. The Panama scandals furnished him with another occasion, and
                    he created something of a sensation by a statement in the <hi rend="italic">Figaro</hi>
                    that he had met M. Clemenceau at the table of the financier Cornélius Herz. In 1895 he
                    returned to Paris, two years before the Dreyfus affair supplied him with another <hi
                        rend="italic">point d’appud.</hi> He became a leader of the anti-Dreyfusards, and had
                    a principal share in the organization of the press campaign. Subsequently he was editor of
                        <hi rend="italic">La Patrie.</hi>
               </p>               <p>Besides his plays and articles in the journals he published several separate works, among
                    them being: <hi rend="italic">Les Petits Mystères de l’Hôtel des Ventes</hi> (1862), a
                    collection of nis art criticisms; Les <hi rend="italic">Depraves</hi> (Geneva, 1882); <hi
