<p><span class="font1">Large quantities of ſilver are thus purified, after the operations by which that metal is obtained from its&nbsp;ores. This ſilver, being always much allayed, is to be&nbsp;mixed with a fufficient quantity of lead to complete its&nbsp;purification, unleſs lead has beer, added in its firſt ſuſion&nbsp;from the ore, or unleſs it has been extracted from an&nbsp;ore which alſo contains lead ; in which latter caſe, it is&nbsp;allayed naturally with a ſufficient quantity, or more than&nbsp;.ſufficient, for the refining of it.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Circular Infirument of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Rerlpction,</span><span class="font1"> an inſtrument for meaſuring angles to a very great degree of accuracy.&nbsp;It was invented by the celebrated aſtronomer Mr To-bias Mayer of Gottingen, principally with a view to&nbsp;do away the errors of the diviſions of the limb ; and&nbsp;has fince been much improved by the Chevalier de&nbsp;Borda, and M J. H. de Magellan. This inſtrument is&nbsp;particularly applicable to the meaſuring of the diſtances&nbsp;of the heavenly bodies, and was ufed by the French in&nbsp;their part of the operation for determining the difference of meridians of Paris and Greenwich. For the&nbsp;deſcription, rectification, and uſe of this inſtrument, ſee&nbsp;the article Navigation, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mackay on the Longitude,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vυl. </span><span class="font1">i. p. 44.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">REELECTION of the Rays of Light,</span><span class="font1"> in catoptrics, is their return, after approaching fo near the ſurface of&nbsp;bodies as to be thereby repelled or driven backwards.&nbsp;For the caufes of reflection, ſee optics, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font1"> at&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rays of Light,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reflection of Light,</span><span class="font1"> &amp;c.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reflection is alſo uſed, figuratively, for an operation </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">the mind, whereby it turns its view backwards as it were upon itſelf, and makes itſelf and its own ope-rations the object of its diſquiſition ; and by contem-ρiating the manner, order, and laws, which it obſerves&nbsp;in perceiving ideas, comparing them together, reaſoning, &amp;c. it frames new ideas of the relations diſcovered&nbsp;therein. See Metaphysics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REFLEX,in painting, means thofe places in a picture which are ſuppoſed to be illuminated by light reflected&nbsp;from ſome other body in the ſame piece. See Painting, Part I. fect. 2. and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REFLUX, the backward courſe of water, has the fame meaning as the ebbing of the ſea, and is oppoſed&nbsp;to flood, flux, or the flowing of the ſea. See Tides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REFORM means a change from worſe to better, a • re-eſtabliſhment or revival of former neglected diſcipline,&nbsp;©r a correction of abuſes therein. The term is much&nbsp;ufed in a monaſtic fenfe for the reducing an order or&nbsp;congregation of religious to the ancient ſeverity of the&nbsp;rule from which it had gradually ſwerved, or even&nbsp;ſor improving on the ancient rule and inſtitution itſelf,&nbsp;and voluntarily making it more ſevere. In this ſenſe&nbsp;the order of St Bernard is ſaid to be only a reform of&nbsp;that of St Benedict. In this country it is applied both&nbsp;to politics and religion, and may innocently bc applied&nbsp;to any endeavours to change an eſtabhſhment from worſe&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to better. But ſt appears at preſent to have been&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">chiefly made a pretence for deſigns which could not&nbsp;fairly or ſafely be avowed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A reform in religion and in parliament (fee Parliament) has, we know, been moſt loudly called for by men whofe religions notions are immenſely different&nbsp;from what has been generally reckoned Chriſtianity, and&nbsp;whoſe deſigns, as has been legally proved, went to the&nbsp;overthrow of all civil order. For infidious purpoſes&nbsp;like theſe, the word reform is a good cloak, eſpecially&nbsp;if anything can be fixed upon, either in the religion or&nbsp;government of the ſtate, which, with the help of exag-geration and diſtortion, can be repreſented to the weak&nbsp;and unthinking as extremely defective and erroneous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The general error of theſe men ſeems to be, that ha-ving picked up a ſet of ſpeculative notions which flatter their own pride and the pridς of thoſe who liſten to&nbsp;them, they will allow nothing to the arguments of their&nbsp;opponents or the experience of mankind. They think&nbsp;ſo often and fo much upon their ideal reforms, that&nbsp;while they imagine their notions are liberal and extenſive, they become contracted beyond imagination; while&nbsp;their judgments, of courſe, are warped with the moſt&nbsp;inveterate prejudices (ſee Prejudice.) They ſee, or&nbsp;think they ſee, the propriety of their ſchemes ; but they&nbsp;ſeldom, perhaps never, reflect, that that may be true in&nbsp;ſpeculation or in theory which cannot poffibly be redu-ced to practice. They will not take the world as it is,&nbsp;and allow it to profit by the wiſdom and experience of&nbsp;ages ; but they will reform it according to thoſe ideas of&nbsp;right which they have learned from their own fpecula-tions and airy theories ; ſeldom conſidering what may&nbsp;be done, they are determined to do what they think&nbsp;ought to be done. Liberty of confcience, and liberty&nbsp;of action, have been claimed by them as the unalienable&nbsp;rights of man ; and fo we ourfelves are difpoſed to think,&nbsp;them : nor have we heard that in this country they have&nbsp;been denied to any man, or ſet of men, ſo far as has been&nbsp;thought conſiſtent with the ſafety of the ſtate, and&nbsp;that of the other individuals who compofe it. At the&nbsp;ſame time, the very ſame men heſitate not to blame,&nbsp;with acrimony the moſt violent, and to the utmoſt of&nbsp;their power to reſtrain, the actions and opinions of thoſe&nbsp;who with equal conviction, often on better grounds, and&nbsp;generally with more modeſty, differ from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Amidſt that exceffive ardour, too, with which they propagate their opinions, they forget the extreme dan-ger of withdrawing the attention of that part of the&nbsp;community, who muſt earn their bread by the ſweat&nbsp;oſ their brow, from their proper occupations, to the&nbsp;tempeſtuous fea of political debate, for which their&nbsp;education and mode of Iife cannot poſſibly have qualified them. It requires but very little penetration,&nbsp;however, to be able to fee, that it can be of no real&nbsp;ſervice either to the individuals themſelves, or to the&nbsp;community at large, in whatever light we look upon it.&nbsp;Intleed, to make thoſe the judges of the law, and the&nbsp;reformers of the legiſlature, who have all their lives&nbsp;been employed in manual labour, is the extreme of folly ; and yet it is what ſome men of conſiderable abilities,&nbsp;and from whom we had reaſon to expect better things,&nbsp;have more than once attempted. '1 he effect of ſuch a&nbsp;mode of ſeduction (and it deſerves no better name), when&nbsp;it ſhall become general, inſtead oſ ſerving the purpoſes of&nbsp;a real reform, muſt be to annihilate all civil ordcr.
