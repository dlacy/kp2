The sakis, which form the genus <hi rend="italic">Pithecia,</hi> are specially characterized by their long and generally bushy tails, distinct whiskers and beard, and the usually elon-gated hair on the crown of the head, which may either radiate from a point in the centre, or be divided by a median parting. They are very delicate animals, difficult to keep in confinement, and in that state exhibiting a gentle disposition, and being normally silent (see Primates).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
