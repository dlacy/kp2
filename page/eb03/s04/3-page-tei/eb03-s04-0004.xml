The ſkin of a real black fox is more eſteemed than even that of a fable. In the country near the Frozen Ocean are alſo blue and white foxes. The fineſt fables come from Nertſhinſk and Jakutsk, the inhabitants of which places catch them in the mountains of Stannowoi Krebet. The tributary nations were formerly obliged to pay their taxes in the ſkins of foxes and fables only. But now the ſkins of ſquirrels, bears, rein-deer, &amp;c. and ſometimes money, are received by way of tribute ; and this not only from thoſe who live near the Lena, but alſo in the governments of Ilinſk, Irkutzk, Selenginſk, and Nertſhinſk. When the Tartars firſt became tributary to Ruſſia, they brought their furs indiſcriminately as they caught them, and among them were often fables of extraordinary value ; and formerly, if any trader brought with him an iron kettle, they gave him in exchange for it as many fables as it would hold. But they are now better acquainted with their value. They fell their fables to smugglers at a very high price, and pay only a ruble inſtead of a ſkin to the revenue officers, who now receive more ready money than fables, by way of tribute. The ſubjects plead the ſcarcity of furs, and indeed not without ſome appearance of truth.</p><p>Siberia has ſtill other and more valuable treaſures than thoſe we have yet mentioned. The ſilver mines of Argun are extremely rich ; the ſilver they produce yield ſome gold, and both of theſe are found among the copper ore of Koliwan. This country is alſo particularly rich in copper and iron ore. The former lies even upon the ſurface of the earth ; and conſiderable mines of it are found in the mountains of Pictow, Koliwan, Ploſkau, Woſkereſenſk, Kufwi, Alepaik, and ſeveral others, and in the government of Kraſnoiarſk @@(c). Iron is ſtill more plentiful in all theſe places, and very good ; but that of Kamenſki is reckoned the beſt. Several hundred thouſand puds of theſe metals are annually exported from the ſmelting houſes, which belong partly to the crown, and partly to private perſons. Most of them lie in the government of Catharinenburg. The Tartars alſo extract a great quantity of iron from the ore.</p><p>The topazes of Siberia have a fine luſtre, and in open ſandy places, near the river Argun, as well as on the banks of other rivers and lakes, are found single small pieces of agate. Here are alſo cornelians and green jaſper with red veins. The latter is chiefly met with in the deſerts of Gobiſkoi.</p><p>The famous marienglas, or lapis ſpecularis, great quantities of which are dug up in Siberia, is by ſome called Muſeovy or Russian glaſs ; and by others, though with leſs propriety, isinglaſs. It is a particular species of tranſparent ſtone, lying in strata like ſo marry ſheets of paper. The matrix, or ſtone in which it is found, is partly a light yellow quartz, or marcaſſia, and partly a brown indurated fluid ; and this ſtone contains in it all the ſpecies of the marienglas. To render the marienglas fit for uſe, it ia ſplit with a thin two-edged knife ; but care is taken that the lamina: be not too thin. It is uſed for windows and lanterns all over Siberia, and indeed in every part of the Ruſſian empire, and looks very beautiful ; its luſtre and clearneſs ſurpaſſing that of the fineſt glaſs, to which it is particularly preferable for windows and lanterns of ſhips, as it will stand the exploſion of cannon. It is found in the greateſt plenty near the river Witim.</p><p>Siberia affords magnets of an extraordinary size, and even whole mountains of loadſtone. Pit-coal is alſo dug up in the northern parts of this country. The kamennoe maſlo, a yellowiſh kind of alum, unctuous and ſmooth to the touch, like tophus, is found in the mountains of Kraſnoiarſk, Ural, Altaiſh, Jeniſea, Baikal, Bargusik, Lena, and ſeveral others in Siberia.</p><p>In this country are not only a great number of freſh water lakes, but likewiſe ſeveral whoſe waters are ſalt ; and theſe reciprocally change their nature, the ſalt ſometimes becoming freſh, and the freſh changing into ſaline. Some lakes also dry up, and others appear where none were ever ſeen before. The ſalt lake of Yamuſha, in the province of Tobolſk, is the moſt remarkable of all, for it Contains a ſalt as white as ſnow, conſiſting entirely of cubic cryſtals. One finds alſo in Siberia ſaline ſprings, ſalt water brooks, and a hill of ſalt.</p><p>Siberia affords many other things which deſerve notice. That uſeful root called rhubarb grows in vaſt quantities near the city of Seleginſk. The curious marouth’s bones and horns, as they are called, which are found along the banks of the Oby, Jeneſei, Lena, and Irtiſh, are unqueſtionably the teeth and bones of elephants. But whether theſe elephants teeth and bones were conveyed to theſe northern regions by the general deluge, or by any other inundation, and were by degrees covered with earth, is a point which might lead us into long and very fruitless diſquisitions ; we ſhall therefore only obſerve, that ſuch bones have likewiſe been found in Ruſſia, and even in ſeveral parts of Germany. A kind of bones of a ſtill larger size than theſe have alſo been dug up in Siberia, and ſeem to have belonged to an animal of the ox kind. The horn of the whale called <hi rend="italic">narwhal</hi> has been found in the earth near the rivers Indigirka and Anadir ; and the teeth of another species of whales, called Wolroſs, about Anadirſkoi. The latter are larger than the common fort, which are brought from Greenland, Archangel, and Kola.</p><p>The chain of Siberian mountains reaches from that of Werchoturie towards the ſouth as far as the neighbourhood of the city of Orienburg, in a continued ridge, under the name of the Uralian mountains ; but from thence it alters its direction weſtward. Theſe mountains are a kind of boundary between Ruſſia Proper and Siberia. Another chain of hills divides Siberia from the country of the Calmucks and Mongalians. —Theſe mountains, between the rivers Irtiſh and Oby, are called the Attaic or Golden Mountains, which name they afterwards loſe, particularly between the river Jeneſei and the Baikal lake, where they are called the Sayanian mountains.</p><p>@@@(C) The copper mines of Koliwan, from which gold and silver are extracted, employ above 40,000 people. The silver mines of Nertshinsk, beyond lake Baikal, employ above 14,000. The whole revenue arising from these mines, according to Mr. Coxe, is not less than L. 679,182, 138.</p></body></text></TEI>
