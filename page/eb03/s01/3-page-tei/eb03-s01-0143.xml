The air in general in winter is very ſharp. froſty, and dry; the ſky ſerene and unclouded, by which every kind of exerciſe adapted to the ſeaſon is rendered pleaſant and agreeable. The fogs are frequent near the ſea, but ſeldom ſpread themſelves to any diſtance in land.</p><p>The winter commonly breaks up with heavy rains, and the inhabitant experience hardly any of the delights of the ſpring, which in England is accounted the moſt agreeable ſeaſon of the year. From a lifeleſs and dreary appearance, and the gloomy ſcenes of winter wrapped around the vegetable world, the country throws off its diſguſtful attire, and in a few days exhibits a grand and pleaſant proſpect; the vegetation being inconceivably rapid, nature paſſes ſuddenly from one extreme to another, in a manner utterly unknown to countries accuſtomed to a gradual progreſſion of ſeaſons. And, ſtrange as it may appear, it is an acknowledged fact, a fact which furniſhes a certain proof of the purity of the air, that theſe ſudden changes ſeldom, if ever, affect the health of ſtrangers or Europeans.</p><p>In this country agriculture has yet made but ſmall progreſs. Nova Scotia is almoſt a continued foreſt, producing every kind of wood which grows in the neighbouring provinces of New England. Four fifths of all the lands in the province are covered with pines, which are valuable not only for furniſhing mails, ſpars, lumber for the ſugar plantations, and timber for building, but for yielding tar, pitch, and turpentine, commodities which are all procured from this uſeful tree, and with which the mother-country may in a few years eaſily be ſupplied.</p><p>All the various ſpecies of birch, beech, and maple, and ſeveral forts of ſpruce, are found in all parts in great abundance; as alſo numerous herbs and plants, either not common to, or not known in, England. Amongſt theſe none is more plentiful than ſarſaparilla, and a plant whoſe root reſembles rhubarb in colour, taſte, and effects; likewiſe the Indian or mountain tea, and maiden-hair, an herb much in repute for the ſame purpoſe, with ſhrubs producing ſtrawberries, raſpberries, and many other pleaſant fruits, with which the woods in ſummer are well ſtored: Of theſe wild productions the cherries are beſt, though ſmaller than ours, and growing in bunches ſomewhat reſembling grapes. The  ſaſſafras tree grows plentiſully in common with others; but amongſt them none is more uſeful to the inhabitants than a ſpecies of maple, diſtinguiſhed by the name of the <hi rend="italic">ſugar tree,</hi> as affording a conſiderable quantity of that valuable ingredient. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Sugar.</hi></p><p>Amongſt the natural productions of Nova Scotia, it is neceſſary to enumerate their iron-ore, which is ſuppoſed equally good with that found in any part of America.</p><p>Limeſtone is likewiſe found in many places; it is extremely good, and is now much tiled lor building: independent of which, it gives the farmers and landholders a great advantage for improving the ground, as it is found by experience to be one of the molt approved things in the world for that purpoſe.</p><p>Several of the uſeful and moſt common European Fruits have been planted in many places; ſo that the</p><p>province now produces great quantities of apples, ſome pears, and a few plums, which are all good of their kind, eſpecially the former. The ſmaller fruits, ſuch as currants, gooſeberries, &amp;c. grow to as great perfection as in Europe; and the ſame may be ſaid of all the common and uſeful kinds of garden plants. Among theſe their potatoes have the preference, as being the moſt ſerviceable in a country abounding with fiſh; and indeed they are not to be exceeded in goodneſs by any in the world. The maize, or Indian corn, is a native of much warmer climates; and, though planted here, never arrives at more than two thirds of its natural bigneſs; a defect which ariſes as well horn the ſhortneſs of the ſummer as the gravelly nature of the ſoil. Tobacco may likewiſe be cultivated with eaſe in Nova Scotia, as it is already everywhere in Canada, from Lake Champlain to the iſle of Orleans, for the purpoſe of internal conſumption.</p><p>This country is not deficient in the animal productions of the neighbouring provinces, particularly deer, beavers, and otters. Wild fowl, and all manner of game, and many kinds of European fowls and quadrupeds, have from time to time been brought into it and thrive well. At the cloſe of March the fiſh begin to ſpawn, when they enter the rivers in ſuch ſhoals as are incredible. Herrings come up in April, and the ſturgeon and ſalmon in May. But the moſt valuable appendage of New Scotland is the Cape Sable coaſt, along which is one continued range of cod-fiſhing banks and excellent harbours. This fiſhery employs a great number of men, in ſome ſeaſons not leſs than 10,000, when  120,00 quintals will be caught, of which 40, 000 may be exported. Theſe, at the loweſt price, muſt bring into the colony L. 26, 000 Sterling, either in caſh or in commodities neceſſary to the inhabitants.</p><p>Notwithſtanding the, comparatively uninviting appearance of this country, it was here that ſome of the  firſt European ſettlements were made. The firſt grant of lands in it was given by James I. to his ſecretary Sir William Alexander, from whom it had the name of <hi rend="italic">Nova Scotia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">New Scotland.</hi> Since that period it has frequently changed hands from one private proprietor to another, and from the French to the Engliſh nation backward and forward. </p><p>It was in 1604 that the French firſt ſettled in Nova Scotia, to which they gave the name of <hi rend="italic">Acadia.</hi> Inſtead of fixing towards the eaſt of the peninſula, where they would have had larger ſeas, an eaſy navigation, and plenty of cod, they choſe a ſmall bay, afterwards called French Bay, which had none of theſe advantages. It has been ſaid, that they were invited by the beauty of Port Royal, where a thouſand ſhips may ride in ſafety from every wind, where there is an excellent bottom, and at all times four or five fathoms of water, and eighteen at the entrance. It is more probable that the founders of this colony were led to chooſe this ſituation, from its vicinity to the countries abounding in furs, of which the excluſive trade had been granted to them.</p><p>This conjecture is confirmed by the following circumſtance: that both the firſt monopolizers, and thoſe who ſucceeded them, took the utmoſt pains to divert the attention of their countrymen, whom an unſettled diſpoſition, or neceſſity, brought into theſe regions, from the clearing of the woods, the breeding of cattle, fiſhing, and every kind of culture; chooſing rather to</p></body></text></TEI>
