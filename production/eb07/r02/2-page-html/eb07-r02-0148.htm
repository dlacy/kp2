<p><span class="font0">days, completely annihilated his army, and subdued his dominions. It was in giving an account of this brief war,&nbsp;that he used the famous words, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Veni, vidi, vici. “ I</span><span class="font0"> came,&nbsp;saw, conquered.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During Cæsar’s delay in Egypt, and expedition into Pontus, great disturbances had broken out in Rome ; to remedy which he repaired thither with his usual promptitude and&nbsp;speed. Upon his arrival, he was again nominated dictator,&nbsp;and strenuously applied himself to the reform of the abuses&nbsp;which had been committed in his absence by ill-judging&nbsp;and intemperate partisans. No proscriptions followed his&nbsp;arrival, no blood was shed, no injustice perpetrated ; and&nbsp;this clemency, so different from the conduct of Sylla and&nbsp;Ma.fus, induced numbers of the most distinguished men of&nbsp;what had been the independent party in the senate, to return to Rome, and there to renew the semblance of a regular form of government. He then turned his attention to&nbsp;Africa, where a strong body of his antagonists had been&nbsp;drawn together by Cato and the sons of Pompey. The&nbsp;struggle was severe, but not protracted. A decisive battle&nbsp;was fought at Thapsus, where the Pompeian party were&nbsp;completely overthrown. Despair filled the hearts of the&nbsp;routed leaders. Cato died by his own hand in Utica ;&nbsp;Scipio, being intercepted in his flight, stabbed himself and&nbsp;fell into the sea, while Cæsar’s men were boarding his galley ; and Juba, king of Numidia, and his general Petreius,&nbsp;fell by each other’s bands in single combat. The two sons&nbsp;of Pompey escaped and fled to Spain, where they endeavoured once more to rekindle the embers of the expiring&nbsp;war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon his return victorious from Africa, Cæsar was received at Rome both by senate and people with great adulation, and he celebrated his triumph with uncommon pomp and splendour. He was again created dictator for ten years,&nbsp;and honours were heaped on him with lavish hand. Again&nbsp;did he renew his acts of clemency and generosity to all who&nbsp;had been opposed to him, thus confirming his popularity and&nbsp;consolidating his [lower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But Pompey’s sons, Cneius and Sextus, having collected a considerable force in Spain, Cæsar found himself once&nbsp;more obliged to quit Rome. The two armies met in the&nbsp;plains of Munda, and prepared for the final struggle with all&nbsp;the energy of hope on the one side, and on the other of despair. So furious was the conflict, that Cæsar was compelled&nbsp;to put himself at the head of his favourite tenth legion, and&nbsp;to fight as a common soldier, not for victory merely, but for&nbsp;life. Victory at length declared for him ; a vast number of&nbsp;his most eminent and determined enemies fell in the battle,&nbsp;or in the flight, and among the latter was the eldest son of&nbsp;Pompey. With this sanguinary conflict the war was at once&nbsp;terminated, and Cæsar returned in full triumph to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having now completed the subversion of the republic, Cæsar assumed the undivided sway of Rome, although he&nbsp;tolerated the continuation of the forms of republican government. In his own person he concentrated those offices&nbsp;which were requisite for the conduct of public affairs, such&nbsp;as the dictatorship, the consulate, and the offices of tribune, censor, and pontifex maximus. Thus possessed&nbsp;of all authority and power, he commenced a number of&nbsp;reforms, improvements, and public works of utility, which&nbsp;did honour to his genius, his judgment, and his spirit of&nbsp;enterprise. He reformed the calendar, and undertook to&nbsp;drain the Pontine marshes, to deepen the channel of the&nbsp;Tiber, to form a capacious harbour at Ostia, to cut a canal&nbsp;through the isthmus of Corinth, and to revenge the defeat&nbsp;of Crassus, by an expedition against the Parthians. In the&nbsp;midst of these schemes and undertakings he gave offence to&nbsp;the senate by his haughtiness, and to the people by his too&nbsp;evident assumption of regal dignity, and almost of the regal&nbsp;title. They could better brook the loss of liberty in reality&nbsp;than in appearance ; they retained their love of the form of&nbsp;the republic, when its spirit was gone ; they could not endure the name of king, while they were willing to submit&nbsp;to real monarchy under the name of a perpetual dictatorship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Influenced by these feelings, a large body of the senators began to regard Cæsar as an usurper, and many even of the&nbsp;people, who had formerly supported him as their leader&nbsp;against the aristocratic party, became also disaffected. Mark&nbsp;Antony’s offer of a crown at tlle feast of the Lupercalia,&nbsp;put forth in all probability for the purpose of ascertaining&nbsp;the bias of the popular mind, was met hy such decided disapprobation, as to cause Cæsar himself to hesitate, and to&nbsp;wait for a more propitious juncture for the completion of&nbsp;his designs. Meanwhile, a conspiracy was formed for his&nbsp;destruction, and at the head of it were Brutus and Cassius,&nbsp;who had both experienced his clemency and additional&nbsp;marks ofhis favour. After having narrowly escaped detection, they resolved to strike the blow in the senate-house itself, on the ides of March. No sooner had he taken his&nbsp;seat than the conspirators crowded round him, preferring&nbsp;various requests, and one of them, apparently in extreme&nbsp;urgency, seized him by the robe. At this preconcerted&nbsp;signal, they all rushed upon him with their daggers, and&nbsp;Cæsar, perceiving resistance fruitless, muffled up his head&nbsp;in his mantle, and fell at tlle base of Pompey’s statue,&nbsp;pierced by three-and-twenty wounds. At this moment,&nbsp;Brutus waved aloft his bloody dagger, hailed thc senate,&nbsp;and in particular Cicero, and proclaimed aloud the recovered liberty of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But instead ofjoy and gratitude, a general terror pervaded the senate and the citizens. They had felt secure in the&nbsp;well-known clemency and the settled power of Cæsar ; they&nbsp;knew not what scenes of anarchy and bloodshed might follow his death, nor what might be tlle temper ofhis successor&nbsp;in the chief power. A dull dead calm brooded over the city&nbsp;for some days ; till, on the day of Cæsar’s funeral, Antony&nbsp;inflamed the smouldering passions of the populace to such&nbsp;a degree, that they burst into the senate house, tore up its&nbsp;benches, and raised an immense funeral pile for the body,&nbsp;sacked in their fury the houses of the conspirators, and&nbsp;wreaked their vengeance on al I of that party whom they could&nbsp;seize. Alarmed by these proceedings, the chief conspirators fled from the city, and prepared to vindicate their deed,&nbsp;and defend the republic by arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Previously to this tumult, Antony had concurred with Brutus and Cassius in passing an act of amnesty, granting&nbsp;forgiveness to all who had been implicated in any of the&nbsp;former proceedings. But having stirred up the populace, and&nbsp;being joined by Octavianus, or Octavms, the grand-nephew&nbsp;and heir of Cæsar, he now entered boldly on his turbulent&nbsp;and ambitious career. Brutus and Cassius retired to Macedonia and Syria, to which provinces they had been appointed,&nbsp;leaving Italy in the power of Antony and Octvaius. A jealousy soon arose between these two leaders of the revolutionary party ; and Octavius joining the senatc, Antony&nbsp;retired into Gaul, raised an army, and came to an engagement with the two consuls near Mutina, where he was defeated, but both the consuls fell in battle. Antony fled to&nbsp;Spain, and joined Lepidus ; but before renewing the war,&nbsp;he represented to Octavius that their hostilities would only&nbsp;secure the triumph of the senate and the conspirators. In&nbsp;consequence of this suggestion, Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus, came to an interview in a small island in the river&nbsp;Lavinus, not far from the modem city Bologna, and there&nbsp;formed a confederacy, called the “ second triumvirate.” In&nbsp;the course of their proceedings, these three ruthless men&nbsp;drew up a list of those whom they wished to be put to&nbsp;death, each, without compunction, permitting relation or&nbsp;friend to be proscribed, if required by the others. This&nbsp;bloody proscription was followed by tlle murder of not less&nbsp;than 300 senators, and 2000 ofthe equestrian order. Among&nbsp;the former was the illustrious Cicero, whose death was occa-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
