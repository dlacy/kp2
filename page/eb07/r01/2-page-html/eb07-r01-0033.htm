The most usual way of contracting for&nbsp;these is, at so much per thousand, stating the place of delivery ; but if a steam-engine be used to make wooden keys,&nbsp;it can also work lathes for the treenails, which, in that case,&nbsp;will be no cost, except for labour, as, in cutting up planks&nbsp;for the wedges, plenty of waste pieces will be found to&nbsp;make the treenails A plan has grown into use on some&nbsp;rai lways, of dropping the treenails loose into the hole of the&nbsp;block, and then driving the spike in and splitting them; but&nbsp;this is not so good as driving them in tight. Oak spikes&nbsp;have formerly been much used, and have been known to&nbsp;last twenty years; we should not, however, recommend&nbsp;them, with the rate of speed that has now been attained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best form of chair is a subject requiring deep consideration, and on which engineers of eminence are by no means decided; we have, therefore, given several drawings of those which are most approved. The leading distinctions are, whether the rails have been keyed in by iron or&nbsp;by wood. The latter method, indeed, is almost indispensable&nbsp;when the rails have lower webs; for, as it would by no&nbsp;means do to have the chair following the shape of the rail,&nbsp;as in that case it must always be detached from the block&nbsp;whenever it is required to take the rail out of it, this consequence ensues, namely, that the opening in the chair&nbsp;must be as large as the lower web of the rail. A chair&nbsp;of this kind, with its wooden key, is shewn in fig. 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In every mode of keying it must always be remembered, that the intention is merely to keep the rail down in the&nbsp;chair, and not to attempt to confine it from longitudinal&nbsp;motion. The right way of making these wedges is an essential thing, and should be done by the company. The&nbsp;original mode was to purchase oak plank, thoroughly seasoned, and of the thickness required. If it be not seasoned&nbsp;in the most complete manner, it will not answer; but this process may be hastened by steaming it in a tank, with a pressure of about 12 lbs. on the square inch. When it is thoroughly seasoned it should be removed into a drying-house,&nbsp;having hot air flues under the floor, made of iron pipes,&nbsp;where all moisture must be extracted; and when thoroughly&nbsp;dry, it is cut into the proper scantling, and into thirteen-inch lengths, each of which when complete is cut into two&nbsp;for joint chairs, or three for intermediate chairs. They are&nbsp;first prepared by joiners to the right shape for going through&nbsp;the cutters; a joiner will prepare about 100 in a day. The&nbsp;cutters are composed of four blocks of iron, fixed one over&nbsp;the other, with openings between each of about one inch,&nbsp;sloping downwards. In the centre of the three lower blocks&nbsp;are steel cutters, the lower one being exactly the shape of&nbsp;the key, and the others above gradually larger. The key is&nbsp;put in at the top, and forced through by a lever about&nbsp;• seventeen feet in length, brought down by a chain and crab&nbsp;winch, with eighty teeth in the wheel and ten in the pinion.&nbsp;Three men will work this, and in ten hours will cut 500&nbsp;pieces, thirteen inches long, to the required shape. The&nbsp;shavings come through the spaces between the iron blocks,&nbsp;and by the gradual cutting, each one taking off a part, the&nbsp;knots in the wood go through without breaking, and the&nbsp;key comes out perfectly smooth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next process is compressing them, which is done by</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">VOL. XIX.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">forcing them through an iron block, ten inches thick, with twelve holes in it, 3-l6ths of an inch smaller than the key at the&nbsp;lower part, and tapering to the top to admit the key. They&nbsp;are forced through by the ram of an hydraulic press, worked by two pumps, one of an inch and-a-half in diameter, the&nbsp;other of one inch, the diameter of the ram being nine inches,&nbsp;and the safety valve loaded to about nine hundred tons.&nbsp;Four men work the large pump, and two the small. They&nbsp;will get through 900 per day. A little rough grease is first&nbsp;rubbed over them. They are then cut into two or three,&nbsp;or more, in the proper proportion, according to the relative number of joints to intermediate chairs, and packed&nbsp;up in bags, care being taken to keep them in a dry place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This method of manufacture has been much improved by the erection of an engine on the London and Birmingham railway, by which circular saws, running from 900 to&nbsp;1100 revolutions per minute, rip the plank into scantling,&nbsp;and afterwards cross-cut the thirteen-inch lengths. Two&nbsp;more cutters were adapted on the top of the other four, but&nbsp;gradually larger. These took in the thirteen-inch lengths&nbsp;without their going into the hands of the joiner ; and the&nbsp;key was forced through by a plunger working up and down,&nbsp;by a guide and parallel motion on the end of an iron&nbsp;beam. A similar plunger force them through the compressing box; and 1100 were completed in ten hours. A&nbsp;part of the power may also be applied to drill the stone&nbsp;blocks for the permanent way. The cost of the whole, with&nbsp;the necessary shops, amounted to aboutL.1500; but the keys&nbsp;may be made for L.8 per thousand, if a cheap pattern be&nbsp;adopted. The circular saws also cut up the waste wood&nbsp;into treenails, which were bored by a lathe adapted to that&nbsp;purpose, the whole being worked by steam. It is found to&nbsp;save the labour of fifteen men. When this sort ofchair is used,&nbsp;it will occasion a great saving of time and trouble, if all the&nbsp;chairs are either made by one contractor, or every one gaged&nbsp;before it is received ; for if there be the least difference in&nbsp;the size, it requires a different set of cutters, and a different&nbsp;compresssing block for each sort, besides giving a great deal&nbsp;of trouble to the men employed in laying the way. The same&nbsp;remark applies to the rails. The best way is to take plenty of&nbsp;time, by beginning early. Find a respectable man, and let him&nbsp;have the whole job, at a sum varying with the price of iron.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In iron keys there are many more ways of shaping them. The accompanying drawing (fig. 13.) shews a very good&nbsp;one, where the rail has a web on one side of the bottom&nbsp;only, and the other side of the chair is notched to receive&nbsp;an iron pin. The only objection ever urged against iron&nbsp;pins is, that they are apt to get loose. This might be obviated by splitting the end which enters first, and opening it&nbsp;when driven home. If this be done, the other end should&nbsp;have a head, so that a clawed crowbar could be applied in&nbsp;order to draw it out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The annexed drawing (fig. 14.) shews another good form, invented by Mr. Robert Stephenson, where the rail is confined by two bolts having angular ends, which enter a small score in&nbsp;the rail, and are keyed home by iron keys with split ends ;&nbsp;the key hole in the chair, and that in the bolts, being so&nbsp;proportioned, that the effect of keying up is to press the end&nbsp;of the bolt against the rail. In these chairs there is a&nbsp;moveable piece of iron, the bottom of which is circular, and&nbsp;the top flat, laid in a properly-formed receptacle in the bottom of the chair; and on this the rails rest, so as to give&nbsp;perfect ease to any motion produced by flexure.</span></p>
