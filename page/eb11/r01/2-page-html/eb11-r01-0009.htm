<p><span class="font0">of the kind is to be found. Perhaps the nearest approach to it is a jest at the Sorbonne couched in the Pauline phrase about “ the&nbsp;evidence of things not seen, ” which the author removed from the&nbsp;later editions. But irreverences of this kind, as well as the frequent&nbsp;burlesque citations of the Bible, whether commendable or not,&nbsp;had been, were, have since been, and are common in writers whose&nbsp;orthodoxy is unquestioned; and it must be remembered that the&nbsp;later Middle Age, which in many respects Rabelais represents&nbsp;almost more than he does the Renaissance, was, with all its unquestioning faith, singularly reckless and, to our fancy, irreverent&nbsp;in its use of the sacred words and images, which were to it the&nbsp;most familiar of all images and words. On the other hand, there&nbsp;are in the book, in the description of Gargantuan and Pantagruel’s&nbsp;education, in the sketch of the abbey of Thelema, in several passages&nbsp;relating to Pantagruel, expressions which either signify a sincere&nbsp;and unfeigned piety of a simple kind or else are inventions of&nbsp;the most detestable hypocrisy. For these passages are not, like&nbsp;many to be found from the Renaissance to the end of the 18th&nbsp;century, obvious flags of truce to cover attacks—mere bowings&nbsp;in the house of Rimmon to prevent evil consequences. There is&nbsp;absolutely no sign of the tongue in the cheek. They are always&nbsp;written in the author’s highest style, a style perfectly eloquent&nbsp;and unaffected; they can only be interpreted (on the free-thinking&nbsp;hypothesis) as allegorical with the greatest difficulty and obscurity,&nbsp;and it is pretty certain that no one reading the book without a&nbsp;thesis to prove would dream of taking them in a non-natural sense.&nbsp;It is not, indeed, to be contended that Rabelais was a man with&nbsp;whom religion was in detail a constant thought, that he had a very&nbsp;tender conscience or a very scrupulous orthodoxy. His form of&nbsp;religious sentiment was not evangelical or mystical, any more than&nbsp;it was ascetic or ceremonial or dogmatic. As regards one of the&nbsp;accepted doctrines of his own church, the excellence of the celibate&nbsp;life, of poverty, and of elaborate obedience to a rule, he no doubt&nbsp;was a strong dissident; but the evidence that, as a Christian, he&nbsp;was unorthodox, that he was even a heretical or latitudinarian&nbsp;thinker in regard to those doctrines which the various Christian&nbsp;churches have in common, is not merely weak, it is practically nonexistent. The counter-testimony is, indeed, not very strong, and&nbsp;still less detailed. But that is not the point. It is sufficient to&nbsp;say that there is absolutely nothing within the covers of Rabelais’s&nbsp;works incompatible with an orthodoxy which would be recognized&nbsp;as sufficient by Christendom at large, leaving out of the question&nbsp;those points of doctrine and practice on which Christians differ.&nbsp;Beyond this no wise man will go, and short of it hardly any unprejudiced man will stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bibliography. —The dates of the original editions of Rabelais’s works have been given where possible already. The earlier books&nbsp;were repeatedly reissued during the author’s life, and always with&nbsp;some correction. What may be called the first complete edition&nbsp;appeared in 1567 at Lyons, published by Jean Martin. It is computed that no less than sixty editions were printed before the close&nbsp;of the 16th century. A very considerable time, however, elapsed&nbsp;before the works were, properly speaking, edited. Huet devoted&nbsp;much pains to them, but his results were not made public. The&nbsp;first edition which calls for notice, except in a complete bibliography, is that of Le Duchat (Amsterdam, 1711). Le Duchat was a&nbsp;very careful student, and on the whole a very efficient editor, being&nbsp;perhaps, of the group of students of old French at the beginning&nbsp;of the 18th century, which included La Monnoye and others, the&nbsp;most sober, critical and accomplished. But at that time the&nbsp;knowledge of the period was scarcely far enough advanced. The&nbsp;next important date in the bibliography of Rabelais is 1823, in&nbsp;which year appeared the most elaborate edition of his work yet&nbsp;published, that of Esmangart and Johanneau (9 vols. ), including&nbsp;for the first time the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Songes Drolatiques,</span><span class="font0"> a spurious but early and&nbsp;not uninteresting collection of grotesque figure drawings illustrating Gargantua and PantagrueI, and the second edition of M.&nbsp;de l’Aulnaye, containing a bad text but a useful glossary. From&nbsp;this time the editions have been very numerous. Among them&nbsp;may be mentioned those illustrated by Gustave Doré, first on a&nbsp;small scale (1854), afterwards more elaborately (1870); that of the&nbsp;Collection Didot by Burgaud des Marets and Rathery (1857 and&nbsp;later); the Bibliothèque Elzévirienne edition by MM. Lacour and&nbsp;A. de Montaiglon; that of the Nouvelle Collection Jannet (seven&nbsp;small volumes, 1867-74), completed by M. Moland and very useful;&nbsp;and lastly, the edition of M. Marty-Laveaux in the Collection&nbsp;Lemerre (1868-1903), the handsomest, the most accurate, and the&nbsp;most complete, in the scholarly sense, yet published. Commentaries&nbsp;on Rabelais, independent of editions, have been numerous from&nbsp;the work of Jean Bernier, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jugement et nouvelles observations sur les&nbsp;œuvres... de M. François Rabelais</span><span class="font0"> (1697), onwards. Of those of the&nbsp;last half-century the best are, besides essays in the works of most&nbsp;of the great critics: E. Noel, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rabelais</span><span class="font0"> (1850); A. Mayrargues,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rabelais</span><span class="font0"> (1868); Jean Fleury (1876); Paul Stapfer (the best of all)&nbsp;(1889); and G. Vallat (1899). Separate points have been treated&nbsp;importantly by A. Heulhard, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dernières années de Rabelais</span><span class="font0"> (1884),&nbsp;and others; while the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Revue des études Rabelaisiennes</span><span class="font0"> (1903 onwards)&nbsp;contains valuable studies, especially those of M. Abel Lefranc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rabelais was very early popular in England. There are possible allusions to him in Shakespeare, and the current clerical notion of him is very unjustly adopted by Marston in the words “ wicked&nbsp;Rabelais”; but Bacon described him better as the great jester of&nbsp;France, and a Scot, Sir Thomas Urquhart, translated the earlier&nbsp;books in 1653. This was not worthily completed till the luckless&nbsp;Motteux, or, as his compatriots call him, Le Motteux, finished it&nbsp;with an extensive commentary. It has been frequently reprinted.&nbsp;A new translation by W. F. Smith appeared in 1893. Criticism&nbsp;of a scattered kind on Rabelais in English is abundant, that of&nbsp;Coleridge being the most important, while the constant evidence&nbsp;of his influence in Southey’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Doctor</span><span class="font0"> is also noteworthy. But he&nbsp;was hardly treated as a whole before Sir Walter Besant’s book on&nbsp;the subject in the “ Foreign Classics for English Readers ” (1879),&nbsp;which the author followed up with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Readings from Rabelais</span><span class="font0"> (1883).&nbsp;Somewhat elaborate treatments of him in connexion with contemporary literature will be found in George Saintsbury’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Earlier&nbsp; Renaissance</span><span class="font0"> (1901) and </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">A. Tilley’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Literature of the French&nbsp;Renaissance</span><span class="font0"> (1904). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G. SA. )</span></p>

Caesar’s real object was&nbsp;to warn the Senate against interference by force with popular&nbsp;movements, to uphold the sovereignty of the people and the&nbsp;inviolability of the person of the tribunes.
