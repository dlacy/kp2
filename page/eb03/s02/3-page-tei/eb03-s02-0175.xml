            <p>SCRUTINY, <hi rend="italic">(Scrutinium),</hi> in the primitive church, an
                examination or probation practiſed in the laſt week of Lent, on the catechumens, who
                were to receive baptiſm on the Eaſter-day. The ſcrutiny was performed with a great
                many ceremonies. Exorciſms and prayers were made over the heads of the catechumens;
                and on Palm Sunday, the Lord’s Prayer and Creed were given them, which they were
                afterwards made to rehearſe. This cuſtom was more in uſe in the church of Rome than
                anywhere elſe; though it appears, by ſome miſſals, to have been likewiſe uſed,
                though much later, in the Gallican church. It is ſuppoſed to have ceaſed about the
                year 860. Some traces of this practice ſtill remain at Vienne, in Dauphiné, and at
                Liage.</p>

                little paper billet, wherein at elections the electors write their votes privately,
                ſo as it may not be known for whom they vote. Among us the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >ſcrutiny</hi> is chiefly uſed for a ſtrict peruſal and examination of the
                ſeveral votes haſtily taken at an election; in order to find out any irregularities
                committed therein, by unqualified voters, &amp;c.</p>

                    >escritoire)</hi> a kind of cabinet, with a door or lid opening downwards, for
                conveniency of writing on, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>SCRY, in falconry, denotes a large flock of fowl.</p>
            <p>SCUDDING, the movement by which a ſhip is carried precipitately before a tempeſt. As
                a ſhip flies with amazing rapidity through the water whenever this expedient is put
                in practice, it is never attempted in a contrary wind, unleſs when her condition
                renders her incapable of ſuſtaining the mutual effort of the wind and waves any
                longer on her ſide, without being expoſed to the moſt imminent danger of being
                overſet.</p>
            <p>A ſhip either ſcuds with a ſail extended on her foremaſt, or, if the ſtorm is
                exceſſive, without any ſail: which, in the ſea-phraſe, is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >ſcudding under bare poles.</hi> In ſloops and ſchooners, and other ſmall
                veſſels; the ſail employed for this purpoſe is called the <hi rend="italic">ſquare-
                    </hi>ſ<hi rend="italic">ail.</hi> In large ſhips, it is either the foreſail at
                large, reefed, or with its gooſe-wings-extended, according to the degree of the
                tempeſt; or it is the fore-top fail, cloſe reefed, and lowered on the cap; which
                laſt is particularly uſed when the ſea runs ſo high as to becalm the foreſail
                occaſionally, a circumſtance which expoſes the ſhip to the danger of broaching-to.
                The principal hazards incident to ſcudding are generally, a pooping ſea; the
                difficulty of fleering, which expoſes the veffel perpetually to the riſk of
                broaching-to; and the want of ſufficient ſea-room. A ſea ſtriking the ſhip violently
                on the ſtern may daſh it inwards, by which ſhe muſt inevitably founder. In
                broaching-to (that is, inclining ſuddenly to windward), ſhe is threatened with being
                immediately overturned; and, for want of ſea- room, ſhe is endangered by ſhipwreck
                on a lee-ſhore, a circumſtance too dreadful to require explanation.</p>
            <p>SCULPONEÆ, among the Romans, a kind of ſhoes worn by ſlaves of both ſexes. Theſe
                ſhoes were only blocks of wood made hollow, like the French ſabots.</p>
            <p>SCULPTURE Is the art of carving wood or hewing ſtone into images. It is an art of the moſt
                remote antiquity, being practiſed, as there is reaſon to believe, before the general
                deluge. We are induced to aſſign to it this early origin, by conſidering the
                expedients by which, in the firſt ſtages of ſociety, men have everywhere ſupplied
                the place of alphabetic characters. Theſe, it is univerſally known, have been
                picture-writing, ſuch as that of the Mexicans, which, in the progreſs of refinement
                and knowledge, was gradually improved into the hieroglyphics of the Egyptians and
                other ancient nations. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hieroglyphics.</hi></p>
            <p>That mankind ſhould have lived near 1700 years, from the creation of the world to the
                flood of Noah, without falling upon any method to make their conceptions permanent,
                or to communicate them to a diſtance, is extremely improbable; eſpecially when we
                call to mind that ſuch methods of writing have been found, in modern times, among
                people much leſs enlightened than thoſe muſt have been who were capable of
                building ſuch a veſſel as the ark. But if the antediluvians were acquainted with any kind of
                writing, there can be little doubt of its being hieroglyphical writing. Mr Bryant
                has proved that the Chaldeans were poſſeffed of that art before the Egyptians; and
                Beroſus @@* informs us, that a delineation of all the monſtrous forms which
                inhabited the chaos, when this earth was in that ſtate, was to be ſeen in the temple
                of Belus in Babylon. This delineation, as he deſcribes it, muſt have been a hiſtory
                in hieroglyphical characters; for it conſiſted of human figures with wings, with two
                heads, and ſome with the horns and legs of goats. This is exactly ſimilar to the
                hieroglyphical writing of the Egyptians; and it was preſerved, our author fays, both
                in drawings and <hi rend="italic">engravings</hi> in the temple of the god of
                Babylon. As Chaldee was the firſt peopled region of the earth after the flood, and
                as it appears from Pliny @@†, as well as from Beroſus, that the art of engraving
                upon bricks baked in the fun was there carried to a conſiderable degree of
                perfection at a very early period, the probability cer-</p>
