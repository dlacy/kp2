He himself was not able to establish any ; nor could he with satisfaction adopt the four proposed by his eminent colleague M. Geoffroy, viz. C. <hi rend="italic">suchus, marginatus, lacunosus,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">complαnatus.</hi>@@<hi rend="italic"> 1</hi>  Of these, by far the most famous is the <hi rend="italic">suchus,</hi>  which the last-named naturalist considers identical with the <hi rend="italic">sacred crocodile</hi>  of the ancient Egyptians. His theory is, that there existed a species of a small size, having a narrow snout, and a disposition which was wholly gentle and inoffensive, which affected the margin of the river, and was thus the precursor of its inundations ; and that it was to this species that the Egyptians rendered divine honours. The opposing view, advocated by Cuvier, is that the favoured crocodile did not belong to any one species or variety more than another, and, far from being less, was even more ferocious ; but that it was the custom of the priesthood to entertain, not a host of crocodiles, but only one, or a few, of any given variety, under the name of <hi rend="italic">souchis,</hi>  as the idol of a divinity who was represented by a crocodile’s head ; and that it was to this individual especially that divine honours were paid, in the same way as <hi rend="italic">apis</hi>  was the name of the sacred ox at Memphis, and <hi rend="italic">mnevis </hi>at Heliopolis. This favoured animal was always nourished and adorned with extreme splendour, and after its death was buried in the subterranean cells of the Labyrinth ; whilst throughout the district where these honours were paid, the whole race of crocodiles were respected and preserved. Cuvier assigns the following among other reasons for the accuracy of his views, which we think conclusive : <hi rend="italic">First,</hi>  the crania of the buried and embalmed crocodiles do not belong to any one variety, but to all of them ; and, 2<hi rend="italic">dly,</hi>  there is the strongest historical proof that the crocodiles in those districts where they were worshipped, far from being less savage, were even more so than in others, because from their impunity they became more bold. Thus Ælian reports, that in the district of Tyntyri-tcs, whcre they unsparingly destroyed the crocodiles, the inhabitants could bathe and swim in the river securely, whilst at Arsinoe they could not safely walk, far less draw water from the river’s banks. The evidence that individuals, when taken young, may be completely tamed, is equally satisfactory. Thus Bruce relates, that on the western shores of Africa, the negroes bring up crocodiles, which become so gentle as to let children play with them and ride upon their backs ; a fact which satisfactorily corroborates the accounts of those religious processions, &amp;c. in which the sacred crocodile performed so essential and conspicuous a part.</p><p>C. <hi rend="italic">biporcatus,</hi>  Cuv. Dum ; <hi rend="italic">C. porosus,</hi>  Schn. <hi rend="italic">Double crested crocodile.</hi>  This species is the common crocodile of India and its archipelago, frequenting the Ganges and other great rivers which empty themselves into the ocean, as also those of Corea and China, Ceylon, Java, Timor, &amp;c. It has a strong resemblance to the Egyptian species ; but the cervical scales are differently arranged, and the dorsal are smaller, more numerous, and differently shaped. (See Plate CCCCXXX. fig. 6.) Thc appearance of the pores between the scales is much more conspicuous than in the other species, and grows with their growth. Its colour is brownish, with black bands on the back, and spots on the side. In the Paris museum there is one seventeen feet long, from the Ganges. In the account of Macassar, or Celebes, we read, that in the great river of that island, there are crocodiles so ferocious that they do not confine themselves to making war on fish, but assemble in troops to watch the boats, and endeavour to overturn them, that they may devour those who are in them. It is the opinion in Java that these animals do not devour their prey on capturing it ; but bury it for a time in the mud, that it may decay. This remark is so generally made of other species in different parts of the world, that it would appear to bc a prevailing habit among them.</p><p>C. <hi rend="italic">acutus,</hi>  Cuv. Dum. <hi rend="italic">The slender-snouted crocodile,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">crocodile of St Domingo.</hi>  This slender-snouted crocodile is extremely common in the island of St Domingo, as well as in Martinique, and the northern parts of South America. Its most remarkable specific characters are the length of the muzzle, which is bulged at its base ; and the scales of the back are differently disposed from those of the preceding. The upper part of the body is of a deep green colour, spotted and marbled with black ; the under part is pale green. Dr Descourtils states that this animal is more flexible than is usually supposed, for it can introduce the extremity of its tail into its mouth. On the same respectable authority we learn that the males are not so numerous as the females ; that they fight furiously at the season of reproduction ; that the males are fit for generation at the age of ten, and the females at that of eight or nine, their fecundity not lasting more than four or five years,—a statement which may well be questioned. The eggs are deposited in spring, and hatched in a month. On issuing, the young are only nine or ten inches long ; their growth continues for about twenty years, and some are as long as sixteen feet. At the time of the escape of the young, the female comes to scrape away the earth and let them out. She conducts, defends, and feeds them, by disgorging her own food for about three months, a space of time during which the male would seek to devour them.</p><p><hi rend="italic">C. rhombifer,</hi>  Cuv. Dum. <hi rend="italic">Lozenge-scaled crocodile. </hi>The habitat of this species has been ascertained only of late years. It occurs in the island of Cuba, and probably inhabits the other Antilles. Its specific characters are well marked. Its chanfrin is extremely prominent, forming a semicircle, whilst in the common crocodile it is only a gentle elevation ; and the extremities are clad with much stronger and more projecting scales than in the other species. Its ground colour is green, bespeckled with small and very distinct brown spots.</p><p>C. <hi rend="italic">galeatus,</hi>  Cuv. Dum. <hi rend="italic">Helmeted crocodile.</hi>  The helmeted crocodile has been hitherto found only in Siam, and is remarkable for two bony triangular crests implanted, the one behind, the other on the middle line of the head. It has been taken ten feet long. <hi rend="italic">C. biscutatus</hi>  is now regarded as an anomalous variety of <hi rend="italic">C. acutus. C. cataphractus,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">cuiirassed crocodile,</hi>  may be witnessed in the museum of the London Royal College of Surgeons, and it is very different, according to Cuvier, from all the others described. The source from whence it was obtained is unknown.@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi>  Its muzzle is longer and narrower than that of the St Domingo crocodile, whose peculiar chanfrin it wants. It is most easily distinguished by the armour on its neck ; there are first two oval plates, then a row of four, then scaly bands common to the neck and back, which together form a cuirass as strong as that of any of the gavials or alligators.</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1 </hi>These seem all to be now regarded as varieties of the common Egyptian crocodile,—<hi rend="italic">C. vulgaris,</hi>  Cuv. and Dum. See <hi rend="italic">Erpétologie Générale,</hi>  iii. 104.</p><p>@@@ <hi rend="sup">2</hi> A specimen of a young individual was presented to the Paris museum as having been obtained from “ le grand Galbac, rivière qui coule près de Sierra de Leone."</p></body></text></TEI>
