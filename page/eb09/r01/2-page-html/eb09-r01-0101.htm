<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">tion had been formed of either religion or revelation, and none at all of their relation to each other, while the idea&nbsp;of God was simply that of the deists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It was in the application of its principles and method (thus brought into vogue) to Biblical studies that rationalism won its greatest triumphs, and really accomplished its&nbsp;greatest measure of good work. Johann Salomo Semler&nbsp;(1725-1791), the father of modern Biblical criticism, as&nbsp;the Germans call him, was the greatest representative of&nbsp;the school in this department. A pietist by education,&nbsp;with something of Gottfried Arnold’s liking for heretics&nbsp;and all his dislike of ecclesiasticism, but with none of&nbsp;Arnold’s mysticism, a man of immense learning, without&nbsp;any clear and systematic management of it, he was the&nbsp;first German to apply the strict principles of historical&nbsp;criticism, in conjunction with the rationalistic truths and&nbsp;errors of his day, to the study of the Scriptures and ecclesiastical history, particularly the history of doctrines. He&nbsp;assailed with all the wealth of his learning the traditional&nbsp;view of the limits and authority of the Biblical canon&nbsp;especially, and having, as he held, demonstrated its human&nbsp;origin and fallibility, he proceeded to deal freely with the&nbsp;books composing it, as sharing the failings common to&nbsp;everything human. He found the Scriptures pervaded&nbsp;with “ local ideas,” and his Christianity was really limited&nbsp;to the “natural religion” of the deists and the moral&nbsp;truths taught by Christ. As a man who had been under&nbsp;a pietistic training, he was, it is true, unwilling to refer to&nbsp;the understanding alone for evidence of the truths of&nbsp;Christianity, but his enlargement of the test is confined&nbsp;to the admission of an appeal to the measure of virtue and&nbsp;happiness produced. By this extended test he tries the&nbsp;matter of the Scriptures, assigning to his category of local&nbsp;ideas “ whatever is not adapted to make men wise unto&nbsp;their true advantage.” The supernatural origin of the&nbsp;Scriptures as writings and most of the miracles recorded&nbsp;in them he rejected; but, on the other hand, he was a&nbsp;vigorous opponent of the adversaries of Christianity and&nbsp;of the naturalists who denied revelation altogether,—Reim-arus, for instance, the author of the Wolfenbüttel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fragmente.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Other decided rationalists contemporaneous with&nbsp;Semler were Teller (1734-1804), Eberhard (1739-1809),&nbsp;and Steinbart (1738-1809), who all agreed in confounding&nbsp;religion with morality, and in reducing Christianity to a&nbsp;popularization of utilitarian morals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Meanwhile the profounder spirits of the nation—Lessing, Herder, Hamann, and others—were conceiving truer ideas&nbsp;of the nature of religion, of the human conditions of revelation, and of the character of the Bible and the mission of&nbsp;Christianity. It was, however, Kant who produced the&nbsp;greatest immediate effect on the history of rationalism.&nbsp;Himself a rationalist, regarding religion only as a form of&nbsp;morality, and revelation as at most a possible aid to the&nbsp;earlier propagation of moral principles, he nevertheless&nbsp;started doubts and ideas which sealed the doom of rationalism in its first shallow form. There was an end of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">demonstrable</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> natural religion of Wolff when once Kant’s&nbsp;criticism of the proofs of the existence of God and of the&nbsp;immortality of the soul met with even partial acceptance.&nbsp;The breath of lofty mysticism which inspired his grand&nbsp;ethical system was also fatal to the cold shallow reasoning&nbsp;and commonplace utilitarianism of previous rationalists.&nbsp;Yet, though Kant proclaimed principles which compelled&nbsp;rationalism to assume other positions, and which really&nbsp;contained within them the seeds of its destruction, he remained himself a rationalist, for the reason especially that&nbsp;he never advanced to a profound conception of the nature&nbsp;of either religion or revelation and the conditions and&nbsp;relations of both. His fruitful idea of the relation of&nbsp;revelation to a community rather than to an individual</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">he was unable to apply properly to the revelation contained in the Bible. Though his morality was something infinitely&nbsp;beyond 18th-century utilitarianism, it still constituted for&nbsp;him religion, and the only test he applied to a professed&nbsp;revelation was that it must contain the purest moral teaching. Fichte, accepting Kant’s ethical principles, taught&nbsp;that a revelation—that is, proclamation of God as the&nbsp;moral lawgiver of the world—might be a necessity in the&nbsp;case of a degeneration of mankind to such an extent that&nbsp;the idea of goodness should be lost. On the other hand,&nbsp;Fries and Jacobi took up the position of Kant regarding&nbsp;the limitations of human </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">knoivledge</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> of religious truth, and&nbsp;still further prepared for the advance beyond rationalism&nbsp;by claiming for man a special religious faculty, under the&nbsp;names of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">faith, feeling,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> or a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sense of the infinite.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> Fichte,&nbsp;in his later period, made an advance in the same direction,&nbsp;abandoning the abstract ethical position of Kant by an&nbsp;appeal to love as the supreme principle in God and man.&nbsp;He thus reached a position more suited for the apprehension of the nature of religion, and he recognized in the&nbsp;workings of genius—with its incomprehensible light and&nbsp;movements—manifestations analogous to the phenomena&nbsp;of revelation. Meantime, the rationalists amongst theologians continued their work of reducing the Bible, with&nbsp;its history, miracles, and doctrines, by one means or&nbsp;another, into harmony with their notions of a rational and&nbsp;useful moral revelation, though for the most part they did&nbsp;not acknowledge the claims of the Old Testament to be&nbsp;considered a revelation at all, or at most a revelation for&nbsp;the childhood of the race. The accounts of miracles in the&nbsp;Bible were either denied or explained away as natural&nbsp;occurrences, or as poetical and Oriental phraseology, while&nbsp;the doctrines of the Bible and the creeds were diluted into&nbsp;religious or moral commonplaces. As representative Biblical scholars of this class J. G. Eichhorn (1752-1827) and&nbsp;H. E. G. Paulus may be mentioned, as representative&nbsp;theologians Henke (1752-1809), Wegscheider (1771-1849),&nbsp;and Rohr (1752-1848).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">But early in the new century the triumph of a profounder philosophy of religion and of a worthier treatment of religious systems and the records of revelation began rapidly&nbsp;to make itself felt. Schleiermacher once more carried&nbsp;religion from the confined and frigid regions of the understanding and the distant heights of abstract morals into&nbsp;the vaster and yet nearer, warmer and yet clearer, world&nbsp;of feeling. Following Herder, he annihilated the rationalistic distinction between natural and revealed religion by&nbsp;claiming revelation for all religion and religions, and he&nbsp;mediated in the fruitless contention of rationalism </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">versus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">supernaturalism by vindicating a supernatural element for&nbsp;the religious life and Christianity, while at the same time&nbsp;he justified rationalism in its rejection of any infraction&nbsp;of the laws of nature. He put an end to the conception&nbsp;of revelation as the communication of doctrine by substituting for it the, at all events, profounder and truer view&nbsp;that it consists in a fundamental affection of the whole&nbsp;religious nature, giving it a new and special direction, the&nbsp;organs of it being historical personalities endowed with&nbsp;supreme religious genius. Hegel and Schelling contributed&nbsp;in other ways, particularly by substituting another idea of&nbsp;God and nature, to the decay of rationalism. Amongst&nbsp;Biblical critics De Wette, under the influence of Herder’s&nbsp;poetic insight into early literatures and of Fries’s religious&nbsp;philosophy, contributed largely to a truer appreciation of&nbsp;the Bible as literature and the record of revelation than&nbsp;such scholars as Eichhorn and Paulus had attained to.&nbsp;In the year 1828 Dr Pusey could inform English theologians that the school had had its day, and early in the&nbsp;third decade of the century Hase was able to sum up the&nbsp;work of the school, which was then practically defunct,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
