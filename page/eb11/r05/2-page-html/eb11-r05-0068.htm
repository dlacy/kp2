<p><span class="font0">Ruge was a leader in religious and political liberalism, but did not produce any work of enduring importance.

<p><span class="font0">RUGELEY, a market town in the Lichfield parliamentary division of Staffordshire, England, in the Trent valley. Pop.&nbsp;of urban district (1901), 4447. The London &amp; North-Western&nbsp;railway has stations on the main line (Trent Valley, 124! m.&nbsp;N.W. from London), and at the town, on a branch line to&nbsp;Walsall. The Grand Trunk canal here follows the Trent. To&nbsp;the S.W. lie the hills of Cannock Chase. The church of St&nbsp;Augustine is modern; of the parish church of the 14th century&nbsp;only the tower and chancel remain. The municipal offices,&nbsp;market hall and assembly-room are contained in one building&nbsp;(1879). A grammar school was founded in 1611. There are&nbsp;ironfoundries, corn-mills and tanneries; and the parish includes&nbsp;several collieries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RÜGEN, an island of Germany, in the Baltic, immediately opposite Stralsund, i| m. off the north-west coast of Pomerania&nbsp;in Prussia, from which it is separated by the narrow Strelasund,&nbsp;or Bodden. Its shape is exceedingly irregular, and its coastline is broken by numerous bays and peninsulas, sometimes&nbsp;of considerable size. The general name is applied by the&nbsp;natives only to the roughly triangular main trunk of the island,&nbsp;while the larger peninsulas, the landward extremities of which&nbsp;taper to narrow necks of land, are considered to be as distinct&nbsp;from Rügen as the various adjacent smaller islands which are&nbsp;also included for statistical purposes under the name. The&nbsp;chief peninsulas are those of Jasmund and Wittow on the north,&nbsp;and Mönchgut, at one time the property of the monastery of&nbsp;Eldena, on the south-east; and the chief neighbouring islands&nbsp;are Ummanz and Hiddensee, both off the north-west coast.&nbsp;Rügen is the largest island in Germany. Its greatest length&nbsp;from N. to S. is 32 m.; its greatest breadth is 25J m.; and&nbsp;its area is 377 sq. m. The surface gradually rises towards the&nbsp;west to Rugard (335 ft.)—the “ eye of Rügen ”—near Bergen,&nbsp;but the highest point is the Hertaburg (505 ft.) in Jasmund.&nbsp;Erratic blocks are scattered throughout the island, and the&nbsp;roads are made with granite. Though much of Rügen is flat&nbsp;and sandy, the fine beech woods which cover a great part of&nbsp;it, and the bold northern coast scenery combine with the&nbsp;convenient sea-bathing offered by the various villages around&nbsp;the coast to attract large numbers of visitors. The most beautiful and attractive part of the island is the peninsula of Jasmund,&nbsp;which terminates to the north in the Stubbenkammer (Slavonic&nbsp;for “ rock steps ”), a sheer chalk cliff, the summit of which, the&nbsp;Königsstuhl, is 420 ft. above the sea. The east of Jasmund is&nbsp;clothed with an extensive beech wood called the Stubbenitz,&nbsp;in which lies the Borg, or Herta Lake. Connected with Jasmund by the narrow isthmus of Schabe to the west is the&nbsp;peninsula of Wittow, the most fertile part of the island. At&nbsp;its north-west extremity rises the height of Arcona, with a&nbsp;lighthouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A ferry connects the island with Stralsund, and from the landing-stage at Altefähr a railway traverses the island, passing&nbsp;the capital Bergen to Sassnitz, on the north-east coast. Hence&nbsp;a regular steamboat service connects with Trelleborg in Sweden,&nbsp;thus affording direct communication between Berlin and Stockholm. The other chief places are Garz, Sagard, Gingst and&nbsp;Putbus, the last being the old capital of a barony of the&nbsp;princes of Putbus. Sassnitz, Göhren, Sellin and Lauterbach-Putbus are among the favourite bathing resorts. Schoritz was&nbsp;the birthplace of the patriot and poet, Ernst Moritz Arndt.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">Ecclesiastically Rügen is divided into 75 parishes, in which the pastoral succession is said to be almost hereditary. The inhabitants are distinguished from those of the mainland by&nbsp;peculiarities of dialect, costume and habits; and even the&nbsp;various peninsulas differ from each other in these particulars.&nbsp;The peninsula of Mönchgut has best preserved its peculiarities;&nbsp;but there, too, primitive simplicity is yielding to the influence&nbsp;of the annual stream of summer visitors. The inhabitants&nbsp;raise some cattle, and Rügen has long been famous for its&nbsp;geese; but the only really considerable industry is fishing,—&nbsp;the herring-fishery being especially important. Rügen, with&nbsp;the neighbouring islands, forms a governmental department,&nbsp;with a population (1905) of 47,023.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The original Germanic inhabitants of Rügen were dispossessed by Slavs; and there are still various relics of the long reign of paganism&nbsp;that ensued. In the Stubbenitz and elsewhere Huns’ or giants’&nbsp;graves are common;, and near the Hertha Lake are the ruins of&nbsp;an ancient edifice which some have sought to identify with the shrine&nbsp;of the heathen deity Hertha or Nerthus, referred to by Tacitus.&nbsp;On Arcona in Wittow are the remains of an ancient fortress, enclosing&nbsp;a temple which was destroyed in 1168 by the Danish king Waldemar L,&nbsp;when he made himself master of the island. Rügen was ruled then&nbsp;by a succession of native princes, under Danish supremacy, until&nbsp;1218. After being for a century and a half in the possession of&nbsp;a branch of the ruling family in Pomerania, it was finally united&nbsp;with that duchy in 1478, ana passed with it into the possession of&nbsp;Sweden in 1648. With the rest of Western Pomerania Rügen has&nbsp;belonged to Prussia since. 1815.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUHLA, a town of Germany, partly in the duchy of Saxe-Weimar and partly in that of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha. Pop. (1905) 7017. It stretches along the valley of the Erb in the Thuringian&nbsp;forest 8 m. S. of Eisenach, and attracts a number of visitors&nbsp;owing to its beautiful natural surroundings and its mineral&nbsp;springs. Its staple industry is the making of wooden and&nbsp;meerschaum pipes; it has also electrical works, and some&nbsp;small manufactures. Ruhla, which is known locally as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die&nbsp;Ruhl,</span><span class="font0"> was famous in the middle ages for its armourers, and&nbsp;subsequently for its cutlers.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUHNKEN, DAVID (1723-1798), one of the most illustrious scholars of the Netherlands, was of German origin, having been&nbsp;born in Pomerania in 1723. His parents had him educated for&nbsp;the church, but after two years at the university of Wittenberg&nbsp;he determined to live the life of a scholar. At Wittenberg&nbsp;Ruhnken lived in close intimacy with the two most distinguished&nbsp;professors, Ritter and Berger. To them he owed a thorough&nbsp;grounding in ancient history and Roman antiquities and literature; and from them he learned a pure and vivid Latin style.&nbsp;At Wittenberg, too, Ruhnken derived valuable mental training&nbsp;from study in mathematics and Roman law. Probably nothing&nbsp;would have severed him from his surroundings there but a&nbsp;desire which daily grew upon him to explore the inmost recesses&nbsp;of Greek literature. Neither at Wittenberg nor at any other&nbsp;German university was Greek in that age seriously studied.&nbsp;It was taught in the main to students in divinity for the sake of&nbsp;the Greek Testament and the early fathers of the church. F. A.&nbsp;Wolf is the real creator of Greek scholarship in modern Germany,&nbsp;and Porson’s gibe that <sup>u</sup> the Germans in Greek are sadly to&nbsp;seek ” was barbed with truth. It is significant of the state of&nbsp;Hellenic studies in Germany in 1743 that their leading exponents&nbsp;were Gesner and Ernesti. Ruhnken was well advised by his&nbsp;friends at Wittenberg to seek the university of Leiden, where,&nbsp;stimulated by the influence of Bentley, the great scholar Tiberius&nbsp;Hemsterhuis had founded the only real school of Greek learning&nbsp;which had existed on the Continent since the days of Joseph&nbsp;Scaliger and Isaac Casaubon.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
