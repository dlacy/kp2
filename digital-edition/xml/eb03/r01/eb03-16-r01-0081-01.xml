a town of France, in Bretagne, and capital of that province. Before the revolution it had a biſhop’s ſee, two abbeys, a parliament, and a mint. It is very populous ; the houſes are fix or feven ſtories high, and the ſuburbs of larger extent than the toιvn itfeif. The cathedral church is large, and the parlia-ment-houſe a handſome ſtructure. The great ſquare belonging to it is ſurrounded with handlome houfes. There is a tower, formerly a pagan temple, which now contains the town-clock. It is ſeated on the river VÜ-laine, which divides it into two parts, and was ancient-ly fortified, but the walls are now in ruins, and the ditch nearly ſilled up. The ſiege of the city by Ed-ward III. king of England, is very celebrated in hi-ſtory. The Engliſh and Breton army conſiſted of 40,000 men ; and nevertheleſs, after having remained before it fix months, were obliged to retire without ſucceſs. E. Long. o. 23. N. Lat. 48. 7.</p>
