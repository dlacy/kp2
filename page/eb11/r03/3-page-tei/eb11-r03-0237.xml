The genitive was the first case to disappear. In general its functions were usurped by the preposition <hi rend="italic">de.</hi>  But for the possessive sense the dative was adopted, cf. Hic Requiescunt Membra ad Dvos Fratres, in an inscription from Gaul. The accusative serves for the case after prepositions under all circumstances, and therefore even in places where the older language used the ablative, <hi rend="italic">e.g. magister cum suos discentes</hi>  in a Pompeian inscription. Nouns of the third declension with monosyllabic nominative, c. g. <hi rend="italic">lens, stirps, ars, &amp;c.,</hi>  form a dissyllabic nominative, <hi rend="italic">e.g. lentis, stirpis, &amp;c.</hi>  The dividing line between masculine and neuter, at all times doubtful, is frequently broken down, especially in the singular, <hi rend="italic">e.g, Cubitum.</hi>  instead of <hi rend="italic">cubitus,</hi>  and there are converse cases. The absorption of the fourth declension by the second is almost complete. In the declension of the pronouns the genitives <hi rend="italic">ipsuius, illuius,</hi>  dat. <hi rend="italic">ipsui, illui,</hi>  fern, <hi rend="italic">illaeius, illaei,</hi>  are found in several inscriptions, but do not belong to the common language, since, as we have already said, they are not at home in the Iberian peninsula. On the other hand, all the Romance Ianguagesshow that <hi rend="italic">*eo</hi>  took the place of <hi rend="italic">ego. </hi>The use of <hi rend="italic">ille</hi>  as personal pronoun, and also of <hi rend="italic">ipse,</hi>  and of both these forms as articles, dates from ancient times. We find a parallel to the weakening of these demonstratives in the amalgamation of the pronominal combinations to be found as early as Plautus with <hi rend="italic">ecce, eccurn,</hi>  which results in new forms, <hi rend="italic">e.g. ecceille</hi>  (O. Fr. <hi rend="italic">cil, </hi>Mod. Fr. <hi rend="italic">celui)</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">eccuille</hi>  (Ital. <hi rend="italic">quegli,</hi>  Sp. <hi rend="italic">aquel) ; ecceiste</hi>  (Fr. re- (/) ) ; <hi rend="italic">eccuiste</hi>  (Ital. <hi rend="italic">questo,</hi>  Sp. <hi rend="italic">aqueste).</hi>  In the verb-system,a characteristic change is the disappearance of the future and passive forms, the explanation of the phenomenon in both cases being psychological rather than formal. Popular language is not familiar with the future, and replaces it by the present—or, more strictly speaking, the vulgar person deals only with the present or the past. The case of the passive is similar. The transposition of active into, passive is too complicated a process for the simple mind. The object of the action remains the object ; when the subject of the action is not known, they resorted to the indefinite third , person plural, e.g. <hi rend="italic">vendunt casam</hi>  is the popular mode of expressing <hi rend="italic">dornus Venditur. </hi>And further, the perfect <hi rend="italic">amatus sum</hi>  was replaced by <hi rend="italic">amatus fui, </hi>since <hi rend="italic">fui</hi>  was a perfect and could now take over the function of a present. For the moment, all other tenses and moods of the verb were preserved, only of the infinite forms, the gerundive, perfect infinitive and the two supines disappeared. .Of the gerund nothing remained but the ablative. In compensation, however,, we soon find a form <hi rend="italic">habeo Cantaium</hi>  springing up beside <hi rend="italic">cantayi</hi>  in useras perfect, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Iitteras Scriptas habeo</hi>  meant in the first instance, " 1 possess written letters,” with nothing implied as to who wrote the letters; ’but later this usage is limited to cases where the owner is also the originator of the state of things expressed in the participle, and thus it attains to the force of a perfect.</p><p>There is little change in the formation of individual verb-forms, lt is natural that the infinitives <hi rend="italic">esse, veUe, posse,</hi>  being exceptional, should have been brought into line with all the rest. This was done by simply adding <hi rend="italic">-re</hi>  on to <hi rend="italic">esse</hi>  (Ital. <hi rend="italic">essere,</hi>  Fr. <hi rend="italic">etre),</hi>  while the other two were constructed from the forms of the verb whose ending was accented, or from the perfect, <hi rend="italic">e.g. volebam, potebam, volui, potui,</hi>  gave rise to <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="sup">if</hi>Volere, *potere,</hi>  on the analogy.of <hi rend="italic">docebam, docui, monebam, rnonui, nocebam, nocui,</hi>  &amp;c.; with infinitives, <hi rend="italic">docere, monere, nocere, </hi>&amp;c. (cf. Ital. <hi rend="italic">volere, potere,</hi>  Fr. <hi rend="italic">vouloir, pouvoir,</hi>  Sp. and Port, <hi rend="italic">poder, </hi>Rum. <hi rend="italic">vrea, putea).</hi>  In other infinitives there is much confusion, especially as between <hi rend="italic">-ere,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">-ere</hi>  verbs, noticed by the Latin grammarians themselves; we have evidence, too, that at an early stage the present forms in <hi rend="italic">-io, -iam</hi>  led to a confusion of the <hi rend="italic">-ire </hi>and <hi rend="italic">-ere</hi>  conjugation, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>  Plautus has <hi rend="italic">morire</hi>  (ltal. <hi rend="italic">morire,</hi>  Fr. <hi rend="italic">mourir, </hi>Sp. <hi rend="italic">morir,</hi>  Rum. <hi rend="italic">muri)</hi>  ; Lucretius has <hi rend="italic">Cupire',</hi>  Cato has <hi rend="italic">fodire,</hi>  &amp;c. For the rest we may note as important that perfect-forms without <hi rend="italic">U-,</hi>  such as <hi rend="italic">-asti, -astis, -arunt,</hi>  infected the first person singular, <hi rend="italic">e.g. -ai</hi>  instead of <hi rend="italic">-avi. A</hi>  new type, in <hi rend="italic">-idi</hi>  arose on trie model of <hi rend="italic">vendidi, </hi>and then affected other verbs in <hi rend="italic">-ndere, e.g,descendidi</hi>  (in Gellius), <hi rend="italic">prendidi</hi>  (in the grammarian Probus) and in general verbs of the third conjugation. But its spread was slow, so that it can scarcely be said to have been common to all the languages.</p><p>ln the formation of words the popular language probably had far greater freedom than the written language. We find not only a marked preference for diminutives in <hi rend="italic">-ulus</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">-ellus,</hi>  but many other types are established, or new ones created. And as the chief ones we must mention the post-verbalia (nouns constructed out of verbs). Thus <hi rend="italic">pugnare,</hi>  being itself derived from <hi rend="italic">pugnum,</hi>  then produces <hi rend="italic">pugna</hi>  (on the pattern of <hi rend="italic">planta, plantare),</hi>  and these formations soon became extremely common, and not only in <hi rend="italic">a-</hi>  verbs, but also in ^re-verbs, cf. in particular <hi rend="italic">dolus,</hi>  ” grief ” (not to be confused with the ancient <hi rend="italic">dolus,</hi>  ” craft ”), <hi rend="italic">CJ .L.</hi>  x. 4510 (Rum. <hi rend="italic">dor,</hi>  Ital. <hi rend="italic">duolo, Fr. deuil,</hi>  Sp. <hi rend="italic">duelo).</hi>  As examples of other types we have <hi rend="italic">-ura </hi>beside <hi rend="italic">-or,</hi>  which we can trace back to <hi rend="italic">ardura,</hi>  a contamination of <hi rend="italic">ardor</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">arsura,</hi>  which extended to <hi rend="italic">fervura</hi>  ; also to <hi rend="italic">Strictura </hi>beside <hi rend="italic">strictus; directura</hi>  beside <hi rend="italic">directus,</hi>  when the old participles had separated both in form and in meaning from the verbal-system and had become adjectives, whose Jwas felt to be part of the stem. Another feature of the verb is the gradual retreat of old simple formations in favour of derivatives from the participle, <hi rend="italic">e.g. cantare, adjutare, ausare</hi>, &amp;c., in place of <hi rend="italic">canere, adjuvare, audere;</hi>  then for denominatives <hi rend="italic">-scare</hi>  and the Gr. <hi rend="italic">-izare</hi>  (Ital. <hi rend="italic">-eggiare,</hi>  Fr. <hi rend="italic">-oyer,</hi>  Sp. <hi rend="italic">-ear)</hi>  which, coming in with Christianity, was soon added on to Latin stems, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>  (in Fulgentius) <hi rend="italic">Citherizantium out tibizaniium.</hi></p><p>Among points of syntax we may single out the replacing of infinitival sentences (following verbs of feeling, seeing, hearing, wishing) by clauseswith <hi rend="italic">ut, quod</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">ouia,</hi>  whence’Ital. <hi rend="italic">che,</hi>  Fr. <hi rend="italic">que. </hi>The latter particle spread most rapidly, and soon took precedence over.the other conjunctions, not only in the cases just mentioned, but in introducing object-, subject-and final-clauses.</p><p>It. is in the vocabulary that it is most difficult to define the relations of the common and the literary language. So much of the Latin vocabulary as appears over the whole Romance area comes of course from the everyday language which was used from the mouth of the Ebro to that of the Danube, but it is by no means all. It is more interesting to inquire w’hether anything can be reconstructed from Romance, and, if so, how much? The existence of a form <hi rend="italic">aiutare,</hi>  for example, mentioned above (Ital. <hi rend="italic">ajutare, </hi>Fr. <hi rend="italic">aider,</hi>  Sp. <hi rend="italic">ayudar,</hi>  Rum, <hi rend="italic">aiuta)</hi>  and appearing in all the Romance languages, is indisputable. Between Fr. <hi rend="italic">grolle</hi>  (” crow ”), Lyon. <hi rend="italic">grola,</hi>  Gascon, <hi rend="italic">agraulo,</hi>  Tirol, <hi rend="italic">grolo,</hi>  and (with change of gender) ApuI. <hi rend="italic">raulu,</hi>  Rum. <hi rend="italic">graur,</hi>  the connexion, both in form and meaning, is so close that one is led to assume a common basis for all these words. This basis is <hi rend="italic">*graulus, -a,</hi>  and it is safe to assume that such a w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>ord goes back to Latin, though remembering that it was not found in the western regions. Rum.<hi rend="italic">afld,</hi>  Sic. <hi rend="italic">asciari,</hi>  Sp. <hi rend="italic">hallar, </hi>Port, <hi rend="italic">achar,</hi>  Gris, <hi rend="italic">afldr,</hi>  Dalm. <hi rend="italic">afludr,</hi>  “ to find,” all point to <hi rend="italic">afflare, </hi>and in this case, too, the change in meaning may be safely ascribed to Latin, only in this case Gaul is not included. Rum. <hi rend="italic">aripä, </hi>Fr. <hi rend="italic">aube,</hi>Prov. <hi rend="italic">aubo,</hi>  Sp. <hi rend="italic">alabe,“</hi>  paddle-board,” in Rum. meaning also " wing,” and in Sp. also “ the wickerwork on both sides of a vehicle,” in Port. " the wing of a parapet,” point to a form <hi rend="italic">*alapa, </hi>which meant “ wing ” and which must have belonged to the vulgar language, even though no trace of it survives in Italy. Many other points could be enumerated, but problems are involved which have as yet hardly been taken up.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p><p>In dealing with the division of this common language into a number of individual languages there are still further points of view to be considered. Before we can touch upon these, we must first take a general survey of these languages. There are altogether nine—Rumanian, Dalmatian, Sardinian, Italian, Raeto-Romanic, French, Provençal,. Spanish and Portuguese. Of these nine languages, Dalmatian is now extinct, and even what w<hi rend="sup">F</hi>e learn of it from the ancients is very meagre. On the one hand, Ragusa and the plains of Dalmatia never attained the degree of independence in literature which w’ould have brought about a<hi rend="italic">floruit</hi>  in the language such as Provençal has to show. Neither, on the other hand, was its political independence stable enough, nor was it sufficiently remote to escape intercourse with the rest of the world, like the Raeto-Romanic dialects. The hordes of Slavs pressing forward from the inner regions of the <hi rend="italic">hinterland</hi>  soon put an end to the Romanic civilization, first in the country, and. then ir the towns. And when the Venetians, who were, both in point of culture and of commerce and of politics, on a higher level, regained their power over the Dalmatians by occasional conquests, chiefly over the cities, the result was of course all in favour of JheVenetian dialect. On the island OfVegliaalone there were still Iivingabout the middle of the 19th century a few people who still spoke Old Dalmatian. The last of these is now dead. Our approximate notions of this language are gleaned from the speech 01 these natives of Vcglia, from a few more ancient notes, place-names, proper names and from the Romance elements in the Servo-Croatian dialect of Ragusa.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  We may begin by reducing these nine languages to seven groups—Dacian, Dalmatian, Sardinian, Italic, Kaetic, Gallic and Iberian. Themost striking peculiarity of the first three of these groups is the absence of Germanic words in the vocabulary. In other words, they were withdrawn from the influence of the general “ Average-Latin ” before the beginning of the more decided permeation of Latin by Germanic elements. There are other signs of their antiquity. In Central Sardinian<hi rend="italic">C</hi>  before <hi rend="italic">e, i,</hi>  and</p><p>@@@ Cf. G. Gröber,<hi rend="italic">Archiv.J. lai.
