<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Racine’s first campaign was at the siege of Ypres in 1678, where some practical jokes are said to have been&nbsp;played on the two civilians who acted this early and&nbsp;peculiar variety of the part of special correspondent.&nbsp;Again in 1683, in 1687, and in each year from 1691 to 1693&nbsp;Racine accompanied the king on similar expeditions. The&nbsp;literary results of these have been spoken of. His labours&nbsp;brought him, in addition to his other gains, frequent&nbsp;special presents from the king, one of which was as much&nbsp;as 1000 pistoles. In 1690 he further received the office of&nbsp;“ gentilhomme ordinaire du roi,” which afterwards passed&nbsp;to his son. Thus during the later years of his life he was&nbsp;more prosperous than is usual with poets. His domestic&nbsp;life appears to have been a happy one. Louis Racine&nbsp;tells us that his mother “ did not know what a verse ־was,”&nbsp;but Racine certainly knew enough about verses for both.&nbsp;They had seven children. The eldest, Jean Baptiste, ־was&nbsp;born in 1678; the youngest, Louis, in 1692. It has been&nbsp;said that he was thus too young to have many personal&nbsp;memories of his father, but he tells one or two stories&nbsp;which show Racine to have been at any rate a man of&nbsp;strong family affection, as, moreover, his letters prove.&nbsp;Between the two sons came five daughters, Marie, Anne,&nbsp;Elizabeth, Françoise, and Madeleine. The eldest, after&nbsp;showing “vocation,” married in 1699, Anne and Elizabeth&nbsp;took the veil, the youngest two remained single but did&nbsp;not enter the cloister. To complete the notice of family&nbsp;matters—much of Racine’s later correspondence is addressed&nbsp;to his sister Marie, Madame Rivière.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The almost complete silence in the literary sphere which Racine imposed on himself after the comparative failure,&nbsp;shameful not for himself but for his adversaries, of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Phèdre&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">was broken once or twice even before the appearance of&nbsp;the two exquisite tragedies in which under singular circumstances he took leave of the stage. The most honourable&nbsp;of these was the reception of Thomas Corneille on 2d&nbsp;January 1685 at the Academy in the room of his brother.&nbsp;The discourse which Racine then pronounced turned almost&nbsp;entirely on his great rival, of whom he spoke even more&nbsp;than becomingly. But it was an odd conjunction of the two&nbsp;reigning passions of the latter part of his life—devoutness&nbsp;and obsequiousness to the court—which made him once&nbsp;more a dramatist. Madame de !Maintenon had established&nbsp;an institution, first called the Maison Saint Louis, and&nbsp;afterwards (from the place to which it was transferred)&nbsp;the Maison de Saint Cyr, for the education of poor girls of&nbsp;noble family. The tradition of including acting in education was not obsolete. At first the governess, !Madame&nbsp;de Grinon, composed pieces for representation, but, says&nbsp;Madame de Caylus, a witness at first hand and a good&nbsp;judge, they were “ detestable.” Then recourse ־was had to&nbsp;chosen plays of Corneille and Racine, but here there were&nbsp;obvious objections. The favourite herself wrote to Racine&nbsp;that “nos petites filles” had played </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Andromaque</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> “a great&nbsp;deal too well.” She asked the poet for a new play suited&nbsp;to the circumstances, and, though Boileau advised him&nbsp;against it, it is not wonderful that he yielded. The result&nbsp;was the masterpiece of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Esther,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> with music by Moreau, the&nbsp;court composer and organist of Saint Cyr. Although played&nbsp;by schoolgirls and in a dormitory, it had an enormous&nbsp;success, in which it may be charitably hoped that the&nbsp;transparent comparison of the patroness to the heroine&nbsp;had not too much to do. Printed shortly afterwards,&nbsp;it had to suffer a certain reaction, or perhaps a certain&nbsp;vengeance, from those who had not been admitted to the&nbsp;private stage. But no competent judge could hesitate.&nbsp;Racine probably had read and to some extent followed the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aman</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Montchrestien, but he made of it only the use</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">which a proved master in literature has a perfect right to make of his forerunners. The beauty of the chorus, which&nbsp;Racine had restored more probably from a study of the&nbsp;Pléiade tragedy than from classical suggestions, the perfection of the characters, and the wonderful art of the&nbsp;whole piece need no praise. Almost immediately the&nbsp;poet was at work on another and a still finer piece of the&nbsp;same kind, and he had probably finished </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> before the&nbsp;end of 1690. The fate of the play, however, was very&nbsp;different from that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Esther.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Some fuss had been made&nbsp;about the worldliness of great court fêtes at Saint Cyr, and&nbsp;the new play, with settings as before by Moreau, was acted&nbsp;both at Versailles and at Saint Cyr with much less pomp&nbsp;and ceremony than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Esther.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> It was printed in March 1691&nbsp;and the public cared very little for it. The truth is that&nbsp;the last five-and-twenty years of the reign of Louis XIV.&nbsp;were marked by one of the lowest tides of literary accomplishment and appreciation in the history of France. The&nbsp;just judgment of posterity has ranked </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, if not as&nbsp;Racine’s best work (and there are good grounds for considering it to be this), at any rate as equal to his best. Thenceforward Racine was practically silent, except for four </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cantiques spirituelles,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the style and with much of the merit&nbsp;of the choruses of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Esther</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Athalie.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The general literary&nbsp;sentiment led by Fontenelle (who inherited the wrongs of&nbsp;Corneille, his uncle, and ־whom Racine had taken care to&nbsp;estrange further) was against the arrogant critic and the&nbsp;irritable poet, and they made their case worse by espousing&nbsp;the cause of La Bruyère, whose personalities in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caractères</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> had made him one of the best hated men in France,&nbsp;and by engaging in the ancient and modern battle with&nbsp;Perrault. Racine, moreover, was a constant and spiteful&nbsp;epigrammatist, and the unlucky habit of preferring his joke&nbsp;to his friend stuck by him to the last. A savage epigram&nbsp;on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sesostris</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Longepierre, who had done him no harm&nbsp;and was his familiar acquaintance, dates as late as 1695.&nbsp;Still the king maintained him in favour, and so long as&nbsp;this continued he could afford to laugh at Grub Street and&nbsp;the successors of the Hôtel de Rambouillet alike. At last,&nbsp;however, there seems (for the matter is not too clear) to&nbsp;have come a change. Some say that he disobliged Madame&nbsp;de Maintenon, some (and this would be much to his honour,&nbsp;but not exactly in accord with anything else known of him)&nbsp;that, like Vauban and Fénelon, he urged the growing misery&nbsp;of the people. But there seems to be little doubt of the&nbsp;fact of the royal displeasure, and it is even probable that it&nbsp;had some effect on his health. Disease of the liver appears&nbsp;to have been the immediate cause of his death, which took&nbsp;place on 12th April 1699. The king seems to have, at any&nbsp;rate, forgiven him after his death, and he gave the family a&nbsp;pension of 2000 livres. Racine was buried at Port Royal,&nbsp;but even this transaction was not the last of his relations&nbsp;with that famous home of religion and learning. After&nbsp;the destruction of the abbey in 1711 his body was exhumed&nbsp;and transferred to Saint Étienne du Mont, his gravestone&nbsp;being left behind and only restored to his ashes a hundred&nbsp;years later, in 1818. His eldest son was never married;&nbsp;his eldest daughter and Louis Racine have left descendants&nbsp;to the present day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A critical biography of Racine is, in more ways than one, an exceptionally difficult undertaking,—not in regard to the facts, which, as will have been seen, are fairly abundant, but as to the construction to be placed on them. The admirers of Racine’s literary genius&nbsp;have made it a kind of religion to defend his character ; and strictures on his character, it seems to be thought, imply a desire to&nbsp;depreciate his literary worth. The reader of the above sketch of&nbsp;his life must judge for himself whether Racine is or is net to be&nbsp;ranked with those great men of letters, fortunately the greater&nbsp;number, whose personality is attractive and their foibles at worst&nbsp;excusable. There is no doubt that the general impression given,&nbsp;not merely by the flying anecdotes of the time, but by ascertained&nbsp;facts, is somewhat unfavourable.
