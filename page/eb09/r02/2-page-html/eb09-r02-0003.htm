<p><span class="font1">tory movements are slow and irregular. In consequence, Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. Their blood-corpuscles&nbsp;are red and nucleated. The thoracic and abdominal&nbsp;viscera are never separated by a complete diaphragm.&nbsp;The intestinal tract and the urogenital organs open into a&nbsp;common cloaca; the oviducts are developed from the&nbsp;Müllerian ducts, and dilated in their lower course for the&nbsp;reception of the ova ; all Reptiles are oviparous or&nbsp;ovoviviparous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The vertebral column articulates with the skull almost invariably by means of a single convex occipital condyle.&nbsp;The mandible consists of several distinct pieces, of which the&nbsp;articular bone articulates with a quadrate bone, interposed&nbsp;between skull and mandible. When the appendicular&nbsp;parts of the skeleton are present, the sternum is never&nbsp;replaced by membrane bone, and the posterior sternal&nbsp;ribs are attached to a median prolongation of the sternum.&nbsp;The ilia are prolonged farther behind the acetabulum than&nbsp;in front of it ; the pubic bones directed downward and&nbsp;forward, and, like the ischia, forming a median symphysis.&nbsp;The metatarsal bones are not anchylosed among themselves or with the distal tarsal bones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As in Birds and Mammals, the foetus of Reptiles is enclosed in an amnion and allantois </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Amniota),</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;nourished from the vitellus of the egg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In some of the most important characters mentioned above Reptiles agree with Birds, as in the presence of a&nbsp;single occipital condyle, a complex lower jaw articulated&nbsp;to the skull by a quadrate bone, and nucleated blood-corpuscles. The majority of naturalists, therefore, consider&nbsp;the two classes to constitute one of the main divisions of&nbsp;Vertebrates, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sauropsida.</span><span class="font1"> At the present epoch, indeed,&nbsp;Birds are strikingly differentiated from Reptiles, but the&nbsp;discoveries within recent years of a number of extinct Birds&nbsp;with Reptilian characters offer ample evidence that Birds&nbsp;are the descendants of some branch or branches of the&nbsp;Reptilian type, in which the power of flight was developed,&nbsp;and with it other anatomical peculiarities by which Birds&nbsp;are now distinguished from living Reptiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">plates. A pair of clavicles rest upon an interclavicle and pass laterally to the scapulæ ; a pair of broad not overlapping coracoids form the posterior part of the pectoral&nbsp;arch. A sternum is replaced by a series of abdominal&nbsp;splints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a. Sauranodontidæ.</span><span class="font0"> Edentulous. Genus : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sauranodon, </span><span class="font0">from the Jurassic formations of the Eocky Mountain region.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Order 2. Axomodontia (extinct). Lacertiform Reptiles, the skull and four limbs of which are Lacertilian in most&nbsp;of their characters. Vertebræ biconcave, four or five of&nbsp;them anchylosed together and forming a sacrum. The&nbsp;tubercular and capitular articulations are separated, the&nbsp;former and longer being on the diapophysis, the latter&nbsp;and shorter on the centrum ; ribs movable, the anterior&nbsp;with a bifurcate head. Os quadratum suturally connected&nbsp;with the skull. A foramen parietale is present. Jaws&nbsp;Chelonian and probably cased in horny sheaths; either</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">Of the various modifications that have been proposed in the classification of Reptiles the more important are&nbsp;mentioned in the historical part of this article. We&nbsp;adopt here a serial arrangement of those orders which seem&nbsp;to be well established, having already referred to the&nbsp;attempts that have been made to arrange these orders into&nbsp;higher groups.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order 1. Ichtiiyopterygia (extinct). Marine Reptiles with a Cetacean-like naked body and with four limbs&nbsp;formed into paddles, the parts of which after the humerus&nbsp;are not differentiated as to form or function. Tail long.&nbsp;Vertebrce numerous, biconcave ; no sacrum. Dorsal&nbsp;vertebræ with double tubercles; ribs movable, the anterior&nbsp;with bifurcate heads. Head large, with long powerful&nbsp;snout, joined to the trunk without neck. Quadrate bone&nbsp;immovably articulated to squamosal. A foramen parietale&nbsp;is present. Orbits very large with a circle of sclerotic</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-left:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">edentulous or each maxillary bone was armed with a long evergrowing tusk, which sometimes was accompanied by&nbsp;other smaller teeth. The pectoral arch consisted of&nbsp;scapula and coracoid, but a clavicle seems to have been&nbsp;absent. Pelvis very strong, with continuous ischio-pubic&nbsp;symphysis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Genera : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dicynodon, Galesaurus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order 3. Dinosauria (extinct). This comprises Reptiles of a great diversity of form and size, some adapted for a&nbsp;terrestrial, others for an aquatic life, some carnivorous,&nbsp;the majority herbivorous, but all distinguished by characters leading more or less closely from the Reptilian up to&nbsp;the Avian type. The majority of trunk vertebræ have&nbsp;fiat or slightly concave articular ends, sometimes a few of&nbsp;the anterior are convex in front ; cervical vertebræ numerous ; a sacrum is formed by more than two coalesced&nbsp;vertebræ. Neural arches united to the centra by sutures.&nbsp;Thoracic ribs movable, with a bifurcate head ; cervical&nbsp;ribs united to the vertebræ either by suture or anchylosed.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
