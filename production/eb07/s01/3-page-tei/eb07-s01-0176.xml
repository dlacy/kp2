Since the year 1801, inclusive, we have had four decennial census. The following table gives the population of Scotland at the different periods referred to, with the rates of increase in each decennial period since 1801, and the number of males and females in 1831.</p><table><row><cell>Year.</cell><cell>Numbers.</cell><cell>Increase per cent.</cell><cell>Males.</cell><cell>Females.</cell></row><row><cell>1700</cell><cell>1,050,000</cell><cell>...</cell><cell>...</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>1755</cell><cell>1,265,380</cell><cell>...</cell><cell>...</cell><cell>...</cell></row><row><cell>1798</cell><cell>1,526,492</cell><cell>...</cell><cell>...</cell><cell>...</cell></row><row><cell>1801</cell><cell>1,599,068</cell><cell>...</cell><cell>...</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>1811</cell><cell>1,805,688</cell><cell>14</cell><cell>...</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>1821</cell><cell>2,093,456</cell><cell>16</cell><cell>983,552</cell><cell>1,109,904</cell></row><row><cell>1831</cell><cell>2,365,114</cell><cell>13</cell><cell>1,114,816</cell><cell>1,250,298</cell></row></table><p>The amount of square miles, as stated under a previous head, being 29,600, the average population is within a fraction of eighty to the square mile. Great as has been the advance of population since the beginning of the last century, and particularly since 1801, it has been considerably less than its progress during the same period in England or Ireland. This desirable result seems to have been owing principally to the consolidation of farms in the low country ; the extinction of the cottier system in the Highlands, and the substitution in its stead of large sheep farms ; the comparative want of poor-laws ; and the obstacles interposed by the law of Scotland to the sub-letting of farms, and to the subdivision of land. But however it may be accounted for, the fact is certain that, as compared with the increase of wealth, the population of Scotland has increased less rapidly than that of either of the two sister kingdoms. The Scotch have therefore advanced much more rapidly than the English or Irish in wealth, and in the command of the necessaries and conveniences of life. Their progress in this respect has, indeed, been quite astonishing. The habits, diet, dress, and other accommodations of the people, have been signally improved. It is not too much to affirm, that the peasantry of the present day are better lodged, better clothed, and better fed, than the middle class of landowners were a century ago.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Table, shewing the aggregate number of acres in Scotland, with the number of persons, families, and inhabited houses, according to the population returns of</hi> 1831, <hi rend="italic">and also the number of acres corresponding to each family and house.</hi></p><table><row><cell>Aggregate number of acres.</cell><cell cols="2">Number of</cell><cell><p>Inhabited</p><p>houses.</p></cell><cell cols="3">Number of acres corresponding to</cell><cell>Number of persons corresponding to each  each family.	house.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Persons.</cell><cell>Families.</cell><cell/><cell><p>each</p><p>person.</p></cell><cell><p>each</p><p>family.</p></cell><cell><p>each</p><p>house.</p></cell><cell/></row><row><cell>18,944,000</cell><cell>2,365,114</cell><cell>502,301</cell><cell>369,393</cell><cell>8.009,761</cell><cell>37,714,438</cell><cell>51,204,133</cell><cell>4.708, 554 6.402,703</cell></row></table><p>The classification of individuals, principally of males, of twenty years of age and upwards, in different departments of industÎ¹y in Scotland, according to the census of 1831, is</p><p>Occupations.
