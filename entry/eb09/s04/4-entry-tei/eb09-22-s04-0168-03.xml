In 1791 Smirke was elected an associate of the Royal Academy, and two years later a full member. In 1814 he was nominated keeper to the Academy, but the king refused to sanction the appointment on account of the artistâ€™s pronounced revolutionary opinions. He was engaged upon the Shakespeare gallery, for which he painted Katharina and Petruchio, Prince Henry and Falstaff, and other subjects. He also executed many clever and popular book-illustrations. His works, which are frequently of a humorous character, are pleasing and graceful, accomplished in draftsmanship and handled with considerable spirit. He died in London on the 5th of January 1845.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
