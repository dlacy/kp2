<p><span class="font1">the statutory instrument whereby the formular system of procedure ' was substituted for that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per legis actiones.</span><span class="font1"> Its date was probably&nbsp;about the end of the 6th or beginning of the 7th century of the city.&nbsp;Girard, who has examined the question with great care, places it in&nbsp;the first third of the 7th century,<sup>@@1</sup> and, though his reasoning is not&nbsp;quite conclusive, it largely refutes the arguments of older writers,&nbsp;who in many cases put the date a century and more earlier. It&nbsp;is the opinion of Wlassak<sup>@@2</sup> that it was a (Diece of tentative legislation,&nbsp;and that as regards citizens it in no wise abolished the actions of&nbsp;the law but merely made the formulary procedure alternative to&nbsp;them, according as the praetor, on the representation of the parties,&nbsp;might determine in each case; formulae, in his view, being first&nbsp;made compulsory, subject to a few exceptions, by the Julian laws.&nbsp;This is a probable theory and is now adopted by many recent writers.&nbsp;The main purpose of the statute seems to have been to empower the&nbsp;urban praetors to adapt existing remedies to altered circumstances,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter alia to</span><span class="font1"> fashion new actions on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> for the use&nbsp;of the peregrins, to whom the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actiones</span><span class="font1"> were rarely, if at all,&nbsp;available. But, whatever may have been its actual provisions, the&nbsp;result was the adoption of a procedure which gradually supplanted&nbsp;that by the actions of the law, which was much more pliant than the&nbsp;latter, and whose characteristic was this—that, instead of the issue&nbsp;being declared by word of mouth by the parties, and requiring as a&nbsp;rule to embody with perfect accuracy the statutory provision on&nbsp;which it was based, it was formulated in writing under the direction of the praetor, in the shape of an instruction to the judge to&nbsp;inquire into the merits of the dispute, with power to condemn or&nbsp;acquit according to his finding. A statute was necessary for accomplishing such an innovation, not only because the existing procedure&nbsp;was directly prescribed by statute, but ako among other reasons&nbsp;because the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legis actiones</span><span class="font1"> were favourites of the pontifical colleges&nbsp;(being often profitable to them), and any attempt by the magistrates&nbsp;to dispense with them would have been opposed by these powerful&nbsp;bodies. It is now the dominant opinion among modern writers,&nbsp;and it seems based on reasoning which cannot be gainsaid, that even&nbsp;prior to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lexAebutia</span><span class="font1"> written formulae were employed in practice,&nbsp;particularly if not exclusively in the peregrin praetor’s court, and&nbsp;that one of the objects of the statute was to legalize similar procedure&nbsp;in civil actions.<sup>@@3 </sup>All such formulae granted by the peregrin praetor&nbsp;must of course have been </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in factum conceptae.</span><span class="font1"> Unless we hold&nbsp;this view it is difficult to see by what means the rights and obligations of peregrins in their transactions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter se</span><span class="font1"> or with citizens&nbsp;could have been enforced, as civil actions, save perhaps in exceptional cases where by treaty they enjoyed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus commercii,</span><span class="font1"> were not&nbsp;open to them. Written instructions to the recuperators or other&nbsp;judges for trying suits in which a peregrin was a party would be a&nbsp;practical necessity, for these judges would have to decide according to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium,</span><span class="font1"> whose rules would probably be strange to them, and&nbsp;their instructions would therefore have to be precise and definite.&nbsp;Verbal instructions. would have led to miscarriages of justice.&nbsp;From this point of view we can see how the peregrin praetor became&nbsp;the primary organ in developing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium.</span><span class="font1"> But there is some&nbsp;reason for holding that the urban praetor had. also, before the&nbsp;Acbutian law, occasionally exercised his imperium by granting&nbsp;actions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in factum,</span><span class="font1"> and in this way perhaps enforced ti number of&nbsp;contracts and other obligations in which elements of equity and&nbsp;good faith were present and. which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> left remediless.&nbsp;Actions of this kind among </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rives</span><span class="font1"> would be in the nature of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arbitria&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">accepted voluntarily by the parties.. The latter view certainly&nbsp;explains several apparent anomalies in the later law, for which&nbsp;no other good explanation can be found, as, for instance, the fact&nbsp;that in deposit and commodate actions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in factum</span><span class="font1"> as well as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in jus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">might be brought. Also the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio in factum</span><span class="font1"> for enforcing a contract of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fiducia</span><span class="font1"> can in this way be explained. It also serves&nbsp;to throw light upon the development of some of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidei&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">contracts.<sup>@@4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Provincial Conquests.-</span><span class="font1">—The growth of commerce and the enormous increase of wealth, which made great capitalists and enabled them&nbsp;through the agency of freedmen and slaves to carry on trade&nbsp;on a.scale hitherto unknown, and which thus helped to foster&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium,</span><span class="font1"> were no doubt due to a large extent to provincial conquests. But these operated also in other direc-tions.Theomcials who proceeded to the conquered provinces&nbsp;as governors found themselves face to face with laws and institutions in&nbsp;many respects differing from those of Rome. Political considerations&nbsp;dictated how far these were to be respected, how far subverted. In</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">some provinces, more especially the Eastern ones, it was thought unnecessary to do more than supplement the existing system by the&nbsp;importation of doctrines of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span class="font1"> and the procedure of&nbsp;the praetor’s edicts; while in others, in which it was deemed expedient to destroy as rapidly as possible all national feeling and every&nbsp;national rallying point, a Romanizing of all their institutions was&nbsp;resorted to, even to the extent of introducing some of the formal&nbsp;transactions which previously had been confined to citizens. But in&nbsp;either case there was a reflex action. The native institution had to&nbsp;be studied, its advantages and disadvantages balanced, the means&nbsp;considered of adapting it to the praetorian procedure, and the&nbsp;new ideas so presented as to make them harmonize as far as possible&nbsp;with the old. All this was a training of no small value for those who,&nbsp;on their return to Rome, were to exercise an influence on legislation&nbsp;and the administration of the law. They brought back with them&nbsp;not merely an experience they could not. have obtained at home, but&nbsp;sometimes a familiarity with foreign institutions that they were&nbsp;very willing to acclimatize in Italy. Rome thus enriched its law&nbsp;from the provinces, deriving from them its emphyteutic tenure&nbsp;of land, its hypothec, its Rhodian law of general average and a&nbsp;variety of other features that were altogether novel. They were&nbsp;sanctioned by tacit recognition, by edicts of the praetors and in&nbsp;other ways; but, in whatever way received, they were indirectly&nbsp;fruits of provincial conquest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spread of Literature and Philosophy.—</span><span class="font1">The effect on Roman civilization of the addiction of educated men in the later Republic&nbsp;to literature and philosophy is a matter for consideration&nbsp;in connexion with Rome’s general history. It is not&nbsp;proposed to consider here the question how far specific&nbsp;doctrines of Roman law bear the impress of the influence&nbsp;of the schools, especially that of the.Stoics; it is a subject&nbsp;much too large to be disposed of in a few lines.<sup>@@5</sup> The&nbsp;matter is mentioned simply for the sake of noting that, the spirit&nbsp;of critical inquiry aroused and fostered by literary and philosophical&nbsp;study, seriously and conscientiously undertaken, contributed greatly&nbsp;to promote a new departure in jurisprudence that became very&nbsp;marked in the time of Cicero—the desire to subordinate form to&nbsp;substance, the word spoken to the will it was meant to manifest,&nbsp;the abstract rule to tne individual case to which it was proposed&nbsp;to apply it. This was the first effort of what then was called&nbsp;equity to temper and keep within the bounds the. rigour of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus&nbsp;strictum.</span><span class="font1"> The praetors, the judges and the jurisconsults all had&nbsp;their share in it. Although modern jurists are prone to speak of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">f</span><span class="font1">&gt;raetorian equity as if it were a thing apart, yet the same spirit was eavening the law in all directions and in the hands of all who had&nbsp;to deal with it, the difference being that the form and publicity&nbsp;of the edict gave to its applications by the praetors a more prominent and enduring record than was found in the decisions of&nbsp;private </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judices</span><span class="font1"> or the opinions of counselling jurisconsults.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Decline of Religion and Morals.—</span><span class="font1">It would be equally out of place to enlarge here on the causes and manifestations of&nbsp;that decline in religious sentiment and public and&nbsp;private virtue which was fraught with such disastrous&nbsp;results in the later days of the Republic. The private&nbsp;law was influenced by it to a considerable extent,&nbsp;alike in those branches which regulated the domestic relations&nbsp;and those which dealt with property and contract.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ever-increasing disregard of the sanctity of the marriage tie is one of those features in the history of the period which&nbsp;strikes even the most unobservant. While from the first&nbsp;the law had denounced causeless separation and visited it&nbsp;with penalties, in principle it maintained the perfect freedom&nbsp;of repudiation on the part of the husband.  With the simple&nbsp;and frugal habits of the first five centuries of Rome, and the&nbsp;surveillance of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">consilium domeslicum,</span><span class="font1"> the recognition of&nbsp;this principle produced no evil results; family misunderstandings were easily smoothed over, and divorces were of&nbsp;rare occurrence. But during the 6th and 7th centuries of&nbsp;the Republic a change to looser morals took place, and the&nbsp;family council lost much of its control. This was doubtless&nbsp;largely due to the decay of hand marriages, wives consequently&nbsp;remaining outside their husband’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familia</span><span class="font1"> and often holding</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
