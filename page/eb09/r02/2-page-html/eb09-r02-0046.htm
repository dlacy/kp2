<p><span class="font0">equally well absorbed if all the nitrogen were removed from the space and the oxygen alone left to fill it. These&nbsp;remarks are equally true of a liquid separated from a gas&nbsp;by moist membranes. In short, the blood of the pulmonary&nbsp;vessels, regarded as a simple liquid capable of absorbing&nbsp;O and CO<sub>2</sub>, and apart from the remarkable chemical bodies&nbsp;contained in it, obeys Dalton’s law like any other liquid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The blood is, however, not a simple fluid, but contains substances having a peculiar affinity for certain of the&nbsp;gases of the atmosphere ; especially does it contain hæmo-glôbin. It has been stated that the “dissociable” or&nbsp;“ respiratory ” oxygen of oxyhæmoglobin is all yielded to&nbsp;a vacuum at the temperature of the body. This yield&nbsp;differs from the yield of a gas simply dissolved in a liquid&nbsp;(which also is perfect in a vacuum) in not proceeding ∕&gt;αri&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">passu</span><span class="font0"> as the pressure approaches </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nil.</span><span class="font0"> On the contrary in&nbsp;the case of solutions of hæmoglobin, as the oxygen pressure is diminished at the surface of the solution, no&nbsp;changes occur in the oxyhæmoglobin until the oxygen&nbsp;pressure reaches 25 mm. (about 1 inch) of mercury ; then&nbsp;the oxyhæmoglobin yields up its respiratory oxygen.&nbsp;If the steps are retraced, and oxygen is gradually readmitted to exercise pressure upon the hæmoglobin solution,&nbsp;the latter takes up oxygen once more as soon as the oxygen&nbsp;pressure reaches or exceeds 25 mm. of mercury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We may now consider the actual physical conditions of the blood in the lungs. Venous blood is hurried into the&nbsp;capillaries surrounding the air cells ; much of its hæmoglobin has been “ reduced ” (or deprived of its dissociable&nbsp;oxygen), and further it is rich in carbon dioxide, which it&nbsp;has obtained from the active tissues in distant organs. In&nbsp;the alveolar walls it comes into relationship with the air of&nbsp;the alveoli ; probably these are filled with air which never&nbsp;contains less than 10 per cent, of oxygen, and which (in&nbsp;the dog, be it remembered) contains 3<sup>-</sup>8 per cent, of CO.,&nbsp;at a time when the expired air contains 2'8 per cent. Are&nbsp;these conditions such that, owing to the physical laws&nbsp;described, oxygen must pass into the blood, and carbon&nbsp;dioxide out of it? First, as regards the oxygen. Au&nbsp;atmosphere containing 10 per cent, of oxygen implies a&nbsp;partial O-pressure of 76 mm. of mercury (10 per&nbsp;cent, of 760 mm.); as this is far above the dissociation point (25 mm.) of oxyhæmoglobin, it is clear that&nbsp;any reduced hæmoglobin present would greedily absorb&nbsp;oxygen from such an atmosphere. When the air breathed&nbsp;is much rarefied, the case is different ; the partial O-pressure in the alveoli may be so far reduced that the absorption of O by the blood becomes most difficult or impossible. As regards the carbon dioxide the matter is not so&nbsp;clear ; but, inasmuch as air drawn from the depth of the&nbsp;lung by means of a catheter contains (in a dog) 3<sup>-</sup>8 per&nbsp;cent, of CO<sub>2</sub>, while at the same time the venous blood of&nbsp;the right side of the heart possesses a CO<sub>2</sub> tension of&nbsp;approximately the same percentage, we may assume that&nbsp;CO<sub>2</sub> escapes from the pulmonary capillaries into the alveoli&nbsp;until equilibrium ensues. It is, however, conceivable that&nbsp;the epithelium of the air cells may assist the elimination&nbsp;of CO<sub>2</sub> from the blood by a process of true excretion&nbsp;independently of the above merely physical considerations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">So-called Internal Respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Venous blood yields up its carbon dioxide and takes up</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">oxygen in the capillaries of the lungs ; arterial blood passes to the general capillaries of the tissues and there&nbsp;yields up its oxygen and receives carbon dioxide. To this&nbsp;act, which in its issues is complementary to the interchanges of pulmonary respiration, the term internal respiration, or respiration of the tissues, has been applied. With&nbsp;as much propriety we might speak of internal urination in&nbsp;reference to the nitrogenous effete matters which the tissues&nbsp;cast into the blood. We are in fact not in a position to&nbsp;form any clear picture of the interchanges which occur&nbsp;between the blood and the tissues other than that which&nbsp;is sketched under Nutrition (vol. xvii. pp. 678-682).&nbsp;Muscle is the tissue whose metabolic processes are most&nbsp;clearly understood. Living muscle yields no oxygen to a&nbsp;vacuum, although it gives up carbon dioxide freely ; therefore it is presumably itself in a condition to take up oxygen from arterial blood and to give up carbon dioxide to it.&nbsp;But the absorption of oxygen is not </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">immediately</span><span class="font0"> necessary&nbsp;to the escape, or the formation, of the carbon dioxide, however much it is so in the last instance. In other words,&nbsp;the oxygen passes into the tissue and is at once combined&nbsp;into some intermediate compound which only at a later&nbsp;stage decomposes and yields carbon dioxide. Whenever an&nbsp;organ is active its blood-vessels dilate and permit a more&nbsp;copious flow of blood through it than when it is at rest. In&nbsp;the salivary glands the blood may even pulsate in the veins&nbsp;and look like true arterial blood in colour. After passing&nbsp;through active muscles the blood contains both more CO<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>and less O than after passing through resting muscle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dyspnoea and Asphyxia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the entrance of air to the lungs is entirely prevented the phenomena of dyspnoea and asphyxia begin to appear. At first respiration is deeper and more frequent&nbsp;than usual (dyspnoea), the extraordinary muscles being&nbsp;called into play in both inspiration and expiration ; the&nbsp;heart beats more quickly at first, but afterwards more&nbsp;slowly ; this is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">first stage.</span><span class="font0"> It is succeeded by the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">second stage,</span><span class="font0"> in which the violence of respiration is less&nbsp;marked, although the coordination of the act is more&nbsp;irregular ; indeed towards the end of the stage respiratory&nbsp;movements merge in general convulsions of the whole body.&nbsp;Throughout this stage expiration is more marked than&nbsp;inspiration, and the pressure of the blood in the bloodvessels is very great. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">third stage</span><span class="font0"> is one of exhaustion,&nbsp;which supervenes suddenly, and is marked by loss of consciousness, dilated pupils, and absence of the powers of&nbsp;reflex action. The animal seems dead, except that at long&nbsp;intervals feeble inspiratory gasps occur. Finally there&nbsp;comes one great inspiratory effort: the mouth is fixed&nbsp;wide open, the head thrown back, the body arched backwards, the nostrils dilated, and the pulse after a second or&nbsp;two is indistinguishable (asphyxia). The whole series of&nbsp;events lasts from three to five minutes if the interruption&nbsp;to the entrance of air has been absolute. After death the&nbsp;right side of the heart, with the vessels immediately opening into it, viz., the venæ cavæ and veins of the neck and&nbsp;the pulmonary artery, are engorged with black blood containing little or no oxyhæmoglobin. The left side of the&nbsp;heart and the systemic arteries are contracted and empty.&nbsp;All these phenomena are best explained by the known&nbsp;power of venous blood to stimulate the nervous centres.&nbsp;As the blood becomes more and more venous it stimulates&nbsp;more powerfully the great nerve-centres of the medulla&nbsp;oblongata. The respiratory centre is stimulated, especially&nbsp;its expiratory portion ; and, finally, the whole muscular&nbsp;centres of the spinal system are excited, causing general&nbsp;convulsions. The vaso-motor centre is stimulated, causing&nbsp;the rise of blood pressure in the early stage. The slowing&nbsp;of the heart during the close of the first and second stages&nbsp;is due to stimulation of the vagus cardio-inhibitory centre&nbsp;in the medulla. Finally the centres become exhausted&nbsp;from the impurity of the blood bathing them, and their&nbsp;activity fails altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stimulation of the Respiratory Centre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It remains to ask what property of venous blood confers</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">upon it the power of stimulating nerve centres. Venous</span></p>
