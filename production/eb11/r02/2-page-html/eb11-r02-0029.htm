Not without nervous dread—&nbsp;witness the special taboo to which the leader of society is subject&nbsp;—he draws near and strives to constrain, conciliate or cajole&nbsp;the awful forces with which the life of the group is set about.&nbsp;He enters the Holy of Holies; the rest remain without, and are&nbsp;more than half afraid of their mediator. In short, from the&nbsp;standpoint of lay society, the manipulator of the sacred is&nbsp;himself sacred, and shares in all the associations of sacred-ness. An anthropomorphism which is specifically a “ mago-morphism ” renders the sacred powers increasingly one with the&nbsp;governing element in society, and religion assumes an ethico-political character, whilst correspondingly authority and law&nbsp;are invested with a deeper meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Abuse of the Sacred.—</span><span class="font2">Lest our picture of primitive religion appear too brightly coloured, a word must be said on&nbsp;the perversions to which the exploitation of the sacred is liable.&nbsp;Envy, malice and uncharitableness are found in primitive&nbsp;society, as elsewhere, and in their behoof the mystic forces are&nbsp;not unfrequently unloosed by those who know how to do so.&nbsp;To use the sacred to the detriment of the community, as does,&nbsp;for instance, the expert who casts a spell, or utters a prayer,&nbsp;to his neighbour’s hurt, is what primitive society understands&nbsp;by magic (cf. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">arungquiltha,</span><span class="font2"> above), and anthropology has no&nbsp;business to attach any other meaning to the word if it undertakes to interpret the primitive point of view. On the other&nbsp;hand, if those in authority perpetrate in the name of what their&nbsp;society holds sacred, and therefore with its full approval, acts&nbsp;that to the modern mind are cruel, silly or revolting, it is bad&nbsp;science and bad ethics to speak of vice and degradation, unless&nbsp;it can be shown that the community in which these things&nbsp;occur is thereby brought nearer to elimination in the struggle&nbsp;for existence. As a matter of fact, the earlier and more democratic types of primitive society, uncontaminated by our&nbsp;civilization, do not present many features to which the modern&nbsp;conscience can take exception, but display rather the edifying&nbsp;spectacle of religious brotherhoods encouraging themselves by&nbsp;mystical communion to common effort. With the evolution&nbsp;of rank, however, and the concentration of magico-religious&nbsp;power in the hands of certain orders, there is less solidarity&nbsp;and more individualism, or at all events more opportunity&nbsp;for sectional interests to be pursued at other than critical times;&nbsp;whereupon fraud and violence are apt to infect religion. Indeed,&nbsp;as the history of the higher religions shows, religion tends in the&nbsp;end to break away from secular government with its aristocratic&nbsp;traditions, and to revert to the more democratic spirit of the&nbsp;primitive age, having by now obtained a clearer consciousness&nbsp;of its purpose, yet nevertheless clinging to the inveterate forms&nbsp;of human ritual as still adequate to symbolize the consecration&nbsp;of life—the quickening of the will to face life earnestly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bibliography.</span><span class="font1">—The number of works dealing with primitive religion is endless. The English reader who is more or less new to&nbsp;the subject is recommended to begin with E. B. Tylor, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Primitive&nbsp;Culture</span><span class="font1"> (4th ed., Lond. 1903), and then to proceed to J. G. Frazer,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Bough</span><span class="font1"> (2nd ed., Lond. 1900). The latter author’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on the Early History of the Kingship</span><span class="font1"> (Lond. 1905) may also&nbsp;be consulted. Only second in importance to the above are W.&nbsp;Robertson Smith, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on the Religion of the Semites</span><span class="font1"> (2nd ed.,&nbsp;Lond. 1904); A. Lang, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Myth, Ritual and Religion</span><span class="font1"> (2nd ed., Lond.&nbsp;1899), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Magic and Religion</span><span class="font1"> (Lond. 1902); E. S. Hartland, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Legend of Perseus</span><span class="font1"> (Lond. 1894-1896) ; F. B. Jevons, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">An Introduction to&nbsp;the History of Religion</span><span class="font1"> (2nd ed., 1902); E. Crawley, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Mystic Rose&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Lond. 1902), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Tree of Life</span><span class="font1"> (Lond. 1905). The two last-mentioned works perhaps most nearly represent the views taken in&nbsp;the text, which are also developed by the present writer in “ Pre-An i mist ic Religion,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Folk-Lore</span><span class="font1"> xi. (1900), “ From Spell to Prayer,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Folk-Lore,</span><span class="font1"> xv. (1904), and “ Is Taboo a Negative Magic?” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anthropological Essays presented to E. B. Tylor</span><span class="font1"> (1907); L. R. Farnell, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Evolution of Religion</span><span class="font1"> (1905), follows similar lineç. The present writer&nbsp;owes something to Goblet d’Alviella, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hibbert Lectures</span><span class="font1"> (Lond. 1891),&nbsp;and more to H. Hubert and M. Mauss, “ Essai sur la nature et la&nbsp;fonction du sacrifice,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L'Année sociologique,</span><span class="font1"> ii. ; and “ Esquisse d’une&nbsp;théorie générale de la magie,” ibid. vii. If the reader wish to keep&nbsp;pace with the output of literature on this vast subject, he will&nbsp;find </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L’Année sociologique</span><span class="font1"> (1896 onwards) a wonderfully complete&nbsp;bibliographical guide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Side by side with works of general theory, first-hand authorities should be freely used.

<p><span class="font2">i. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Developments of Animism.—</span><span class="font2">Animism is not, indeed, itself a religion; it is Tatheraprimitive kind of philosophy&nbsp;which provides the intellectual form for the interpretation&nbsp;alike of Man and of Nature. It implies that the first great&nbsp;step has been taken for distinguishing between the material&nbsp;objects—whether the conscious body, or the rocks, trees and&nbsp;animals—and the powers that act in or through them. The&nbsp;Zufiis of New Mexico, U.S.A., supposed “ the sun, moon and&nbsp;stars, the sky, earth and sea, in all their phenomena and elements,&nbsp;and all inanimate objects as well as plants, animals and men,&nbsp;to belong to one great system of all-conscious and interrelated&nbsp;life, in which the degrees of relationship seem to be determined largely, if not wholly, by the degrees of resemblance.”@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>If the earliest conception is that of an obscure undifferentiated&nbsp;animation (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">panvitalism),</span><span class="font2"> the analysis of the human person into&nbsp;body and spirit with the corresponding doctrine of “ object-souls ” (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tornait</span><span class="font2"> or “ invisible rulers ” of every object&nbsp;among the Eskimo)@@<sup>2</sup> constitutes an important development.&nbsp;Matter is no longer animated or self-acting; it is subject to&nbsp;the will of an agent which can enter or quit it, perhaps at its&nbsp;own pleasure, perhaps at the compulsion of another. The&nbsp;transition has usually been effected ages before the higher&nbsp;religions come into view; but it has left innumerable traces&nbsp;in language and custom. Thus the Vedic hymns, which exhibit the deposits of so many stages of thought, are founded&nbsp;ultimately on the conception of the animation of nature. The&nbsp;objects of the visible world are themselves mighty to hurt or&nbsp;help. The springs and rivers, the wind, the sun, fire, the&nbsp;Earth-Mother, the Sky-Father, are all active powers. The&nbsp;animals, domesticated or wild, like the horse or cow, the guardian&nbsp;dog, the bird of omen, naturally share the same life, and are&nbsp;approached with the same invocation. The sacred energy&nbsp;is also discerned in the ritual implements, in the stones for&nbsp;squeezing the soma-juice, and the sacrificial post to which&nbsp;animals were bound; nay, it was even recognized in fabricated&nbsp;products like the plough (the “ tearer ” or “ divider ”), the</span></p>
