            <p><span class="font0">empire, and the building of the new capital at
                Byzantium.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">The alliance which Constantine inaugurated between the Christian
                    church and the imperial government,&nbsp;while it enlisted on the side of the
                    state one of the most&nbsp;powerful of the new forces with which it had to
                    reckon,&nbsp;imposed a check, which was in time to become a powerful
                    one,&nbsp;on the imperial authority. The establishment of the new&nbsp;“ City of
                    Constantine/* as a second Rome paved the&nbsp;way for the final separation of
                    East and West by&nbsp;providing the former for the first time with
                    a&nbsp;suitable seat of government on the Bosphorus. The&nbsp;death of
                    Constantine in 337 was followed, as the abdication&nbsp;of Diocletian had been,
                    by the outbreak of quarrels among&nbsp;rival Caesars. Of the three sons of
                    Constantine who in</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">337 divided the empire between them, Constantine the eldest fell
                    in civil war against his brother Constans; Constans himself was, ten years
                    afterwards, defeated and slain&nbsp;by Magnentius; and the latter in his turn
                    was in 353 vanquished by Constantine’s only surviving son
                Constantius.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">Thus for the second time the whole empire was united under the
                    rule of a member of the house of Constantine.&nbsp;But in 355 Constantius
                    granted the title of Caesar to&nbsp;his cousin Julian and placed him in charge
                    of Gaul, where&nbsp;the momentary elevation of a tyrant, Silvanus, and
                    still&nbsp;more the inroads of Franks and Alamanni, had excited alarm.&nbsp;But
                    Julian’s successes during the next five years were such&nbsp;as to arouse the
                    jealous fears of Constantius. In order to&nbsp;weaken his suspected rival the
                    legions under Julian in Gaul&nbsp;were suddenly ordered to march eastward
                    against the Persians</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">(360). They refused; and when the order was repeated, replied by
                    proclaiming Julian himself emperor and Augustus. Julian, with probably sincere
                    reluctance, accepted the position, but the death of Constantius in&nbsp;361
                    saved the empire from the threatened civil war. Julian’s&nbsp;attempted
                    restoration of pagan and in especial of Hellenic&nbsp;worships had no more
                    permanent effect than the war which he&nbsp;courageously waged against the
                    multitudinous abuses which&nbsp;had grown up in the luxurious court of
                        Constantius.@@<sup>1</sup> But his&nbsp;vigorous administration in Gaul
                    undoubtedly checked the&nbsp;barbarian advance across the Rhine, and postponed
                    the loss&nbsp;of the Western provinces; on the contrary, his campaign
                    in&nbsp;Persia, brilliantly successful at first, ended in his own
                death</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">(363), and his successor, Jovian, immediately surrendered the
                    territories beyond the Tigris won by Diocletian seventy years before. Jovian
                    died on the</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">17th of February 364; and on the 26th of February Valentinian was
                    acknowledged as emperor of the army at Nicaea.&nbsp;In obedience to the wish of
                    the soldiers that he should&nbsp;associate a colleague with himself, he
                    conferred the&nbsp;title of Augustus upon his brother Valens, and
                    the&nbsp;division of the empire was at last effected,—Valentinian became emperor
                    of the West, Valens of the East.&nbsp;Valentinian maintained the integrity of
                    the empire&nbsp;until his death (in 375), which deprived the weaker Valens
                    of&nbsp;a trusted counsellor and ally, and was followed by a&nbsp;serious crisis
                    on the Danube. In 376 the Goths,&nbsp;hard pressed by their new foes from the
                    eastward, the&nbsp;Huns, sought and obtained the protection of the
                Roman</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">Empire. They were transported across the Danube and settled in
                    Moesia, but, indignant at the treatment they received, they&nbsp;rose in arms
                    against their protectors. In 378 at Adrianople&nbsp;Valens was defeated and
                    killed, and the victorious Goths advanced eastward to the very walls of
                    Constantinople. Once&nbsp;more, however, the danger passed away. The skill and
                    tact&nbsp;of Theodosius, who had been proclaimed emperor of&nbsp;the East by
                        Gratian,@@<sup>2</sup> conciliated the Goths; they&nbsp;were granted an
                    allowance, and in large numbers&nbsp;entered the service of the Roman emperor.
                    The remaining</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font0">years of Theodosius s reign (382-95) were mainly engrossed by the
                    duty of upholding the increasingly feeble authority of&nbsp;his western
                    colleague against the attacks of pretenders. Maximus, the murderer of Gratian
                    (383), was at first recognized by&nbsp;Theodosius as Caesar, and left in
                    undisturbed command of&nbsp;Gaul, Spain and Britain; but, when in 386 he
                    proceeded to&nbsp;oust Valentinian II. from Italy and Africa, Theodosius
                    marched&nbsp;westward, crushed him, and installed Valentinian as emperor&nbsp;of
                    the West. In the very next year, however, the murder of&nbsp;Valentinian (392)
                    by Arbogast, a Frank, was followed by the&nbsp;appearance of a fresh tyrant in
                    the person of Eugenius, a&nbsp;domestic officer and nominee of Arbogast
                    himself.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">Once more Theodosius marched westward, and near Aquileia
                    decisively defeated his opponents. But&nbsp;his victory was quickly followed by
                    his own illness&nbsp;and death (395), and the fortunes of East and
                    West&nbsp;passed into the care of his two sons Arcadius
                    and&nbsp;Honorius.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">(b) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">From
                    the Death of Theodosius to the Extinction of the Western Empire
                    {395-476}.—</span><span class="font0">Through more than a century&nbsp;from the
                    accession of Diocletian the Roman Empire&nbsp;had succeeded in holding at bay
                    the swarming hordes&nbsp;of barbarians. But, though no province had
                    yet&nbsp;been lost, as Dacia had been lost in the century before,
                    and&nbsp;though the frontier lines of the Rhine and the Danube were&nbsp;still
                    guarded by Roman forts and troops, there were signs in&nbsp;plenty that a
                    catastrophe was at hand.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">From all the writers who deal with the 4th century we have one
                    long series of laments over the depression and misery of&nbsp;the
                        provinces.@@<sup>3</sup> To meet the increased expenditure&nbsp;necessary to
                    maintain the legions, to pay the hosts of&nbsp;officials, and to keep up the
                    luxurious splendour of&nbsp;the imperial courts, not only were the taxes
                    raised&nbsp;in amount, but the most oppressive and inquisitorial&nbsp;methods
                    were adopted in order to secure for the imperial&nbsp;treasury every penny that
                    could be wrung from the wretched&nbsp;taxpayer. The results are seen in such
                    pictures as that&nbsp;which the panegyrist Eumenius@@<sup>4</sup> draws of the
                    state of&nbsp;Gaul (306-12) under Constantine, in the accounts of the&nbsp;same
                    province under Julian fifty years later, in those given&nbsp;by Zosimus early in
                    the 5th century, and in the&nbsp;stringent regulations of the Theodosian code,
                    dealing with&nbsp;the assessment and collection of the taxes. Among
                    the&nbsp;graver symptoms of economic ruin were the decrease of population, which
                    seriously diminished not only the number of&nbsp;taxpayers, but the supply of
                    soldiers for the legions;@@5 the&nbsp;spread of infanticide; the increase of
                    waste lands whose owners&nbsp;and cultivators had fled to escape the tax
                    collector; the declining prosperity of the towns; and the constantly
                    recurring&nbsp;riots and insurrections, both among starving peasants, as
                        in&nbsp;Gaul,<sup>@@6</sup> and in populous cities like Antioch.@@<sup>7</sup>
                    The distress was&nbsp;aggravated by the civil wars, by the rapacity of tyrants,
                    such&nbsp;as Maxentius and Maximus, but above all by the raids of
                    the&nbsp;barbarians, who seized every opportunity afforded by
                    the&nbsp;dissensions or incapacity of the emperors to cross the
                    frontiers&nbsp;and harry the lands of the provincials. Constantine
                    (306-12),&nbsp;Julian (356-60) and Valentinian I. (364-75) had each to&nbsp;give
                    a temporary breathing-space to Gaul by repelling the&nbsp;Franks and Alamanni.
                    Britain was harassed by Piets and&nbsp;Scots from the north (367-70), while the
                    Saxon pirates swept&nbsp;the northern seas and the coasts both of Britain and
                    Gaul.&nbsp;On the Danube the Quadi, Sarmatae, and above all the
                    Goths,&nbsp;poured at intervals into the provinces of Pannonia and
                    Moesia,&nbsp;and penetrated to Macedon and Thrace. In the East, in&nbsp;addition
                    to the constant border feud with -Persia, we hear of&nbsp;ravages by the
                    Isaurian mountaineers, and by a new enemy,&nbsp;the
