<p><span class="font0">which were written in too great a hurry, are not equal to the first, it is nevertheless the best compilation that had&nbsp;yet appeared in any language ; because it is seldom that&nbsp;compilers are eloquent, and Rollin was remarkably so.”&nbsp;This is perhaps saying too much. In this work there are&nbsp;indeed some passages very well handled ; but they are only&nbsp;such as he had taken from the ancient authors, in doing&nbsp;justice to whom he was always very happy. The reader&nbsp;will easily discover in this work the same attachment to religion, the same desire for the public good, and the same&nbsp;love of virtue, which appear in that on the belles lettres.&nbsp;But it is to be lamented that his chronology is neither exact&nbsp;nor consistent ; that he states facts inaccurately ; that he&nbsp;has not sufficiently examined the exaggerations of ancient&nbsp;historians ; that he often interrupts the most solemn narrations with mere trifles ; and that his style is not uniform.&nbsp;Nothing can be more noble and more refined than his reflections ; but they are strewed with too sparing a hand,&nbsp;and want that lively and laconic turn on account of which&nbsp;the historians of antiquity are read with so much pleasure.&nbsp;There is a visible negligence in his diction with regard to&nbsp;grammatical usage, and the choice of his expressions, which&nbsp;he does not at all times select with sufficient taste, although, on the whole, he writes well, and has preserved&nbsp;himself free from many of the faults of modern authors.&nbsp;While the last volumes of his Ancient History were printing, he published the first of his Roman History, which he&nbsp;lived to carry on, through the eighth and into part of the&nbsp;ninth, to the war against the Cimbri, about seventy years&nbsp;before the battle of Actium. Mr Crevier, the worthy disciple of Rollin, continued the history to the battle of Actium, which closes the tenth volume ; and afterwards completed the original plan of Rollin in sixteen volumes l2mo,&nbsp;which was, to bring it down from the foundation of the&nbsp;city to the reign of Constantine the Great. This work had&nbsp;not so great success as his Ancient History. It is alternately diffuse and barren ; and the greatest advantage of&nbsp;the work is, that there are several passages from Livy translated with great elegance into French. He also published&nbsp;a Latin translation of some of the theological writings relative to the disputes of the times in which he lived. Rol-lin was one of the most zealous adherents of the Abbé&nbsp;Paris ; and before the enclosure of the cemetery of St Me-dard, this distinguished character might have been often&nbsp;seen praying at his tomb. This he confesses in his Letters.&nbsp;He published also Smaller Pieces, containing different Letters, Latin harangues, discourses, complimentary addresses,&nbsp;&amp;c. Paris, 1771, two volumes 12mo. The collection is valuable for some good pieces which it contains, for the favourable opinion which it exhibits of solid probity, sound&nbsp;reason, and the zeal of the author for the progress of virtue&nbsp;and the preservation of taste. The Latin of Rollin is very&nbsp;correct, and much after the Ciceronian style, and embellished with most judicious thoughts and agreeable images.&nbsp;Full of the reading of the ancients, from which he brought&nbsp;quotations with as much propriety as plenty, he expressed&nbsp;himself with much spirit. His Latin poems are likewise&nbsp;entitled to commendation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This excellent person died in 1741. He had been named by the king a member of the Academy of Inscriptions and&nbsp;Belles Lettres in 1701 ; but as he had not then brought&nbsp;the College of Beauvais into repute, and found he had more&nbsp;business upon his hands than was consistent with a decent&nbsp;attendance upon the functions of an academician, he begged the privileges of a veteran, which where honourably&nbsp;granted him. Nevertheless, he maintained his connections&nbsp;with the academy, attended their assemblies as often as he&nbsp;could, laid the plan of his Ancient History before them,&nbsp;and demanded an academician for his censor. Rollin was&nbsp;a roan of an admirable composition ; very ingenious, consummate in polite learning, of rigid morals, and eminently</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">pious. His religion however carried him into the territories of superstition ; and he wanted nothing but a mixture of philosophy in his nature to make him a very perfect character. Nothing could be more benign, more pacific, more&nbsp;sweet, more moderate, than Rollin’s temper. He showed,&nbsp;it must be owned, some zeal for the cause of Jansenism ;&nbsp;but in all other respects he was exceedingly moderate. The&nbsp;celebrated poet Rousseau conceived such a veneration for&nbsp;him, that he came out of banishment incognito to Paris, on&nbsp;purpose to visit him, and pay his respects to him. He looked&nbsp;upon his histories, not only as the best models of the historic kind, but as a complete system of politics and morals,&nbsp;and a most instructive school, in which princes as well as&nbsp;subjects might learn all their duties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROLLING, the motion by which a ship rocks from side to side like a cradle, by the agitation of the waves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROLLO, the conqueror of Normandy, was a Norwegian duke, banished from his country by Harold IIarfager (who&nbsp;conquered Norway in 870) on account of the piracies he&nbsp;exercised. He first retired with his fleet among the islands&nbsp;of the Hebrides to the north-west of Scotland, whither the&nbsp;flower of the Norwegian nobility had fled for refuge ever&nbsp;since Harold had become master of the whole kingdom.&nbsp;He was there received with open arms by those warriors,&nbsp;who, eager for conquest and revenge, waited only for a&nbsp;chief to undertake some glorious enterprise. Rollo, placing&nbsp;himself at their head, and seeing his power formidable, sailed towards England, which had long been a field open on&nbsp;all sides to the violence of the northern nations. But the&nbsp;great Alfred had some years before established such order&nbsp;in his part of the island, that Rollo, after several fruitless&nbsp;attempts, despaired of forming there such a settlement as&nbsp;should make him amends for the loss of his own country.&nbsp;He pretended, therefore, to have had a supernatural dream,&nbsp;which promised him a glorious fortune in France, and which&nbsp;served at least to support the ardour of his followers. The&nbsp;w eakness of the governmcnt in that kingdom, and the confusion in which it was involved, were still more persuasive&nbsp;reasons to insure them of success. Having therefore sailed up&nbsp;the Seine to Rouen, he immediately took that capital of the&nbsp;province, then called Neustria, and making it his magazine&nbsp;of arms, he advanced to Paris, to which he laid siege in form.&nbsp;This war at length ended in the entire cession of Neustria,&nbsp;which Charles tbe Simple was obliged to give up to Rollo&nbsp;and his Normans in order to purchase a peace. Rollo received it in perpetuity to himself and his posterity, as a&nbsp;feudal duchy dependent on the crown of France. A description of the interview between Charles and this new&nbsp;duke gives us a curious picture of the manners of these&nbsp;Normans ; for the latter would not take the oath of fealty&nbsp;to his sovereign lord any other way than by placing his&nbsp;hands within those of the king ; and absolutely refused to&nbsp;kiss his feet, as custom then required. It was with great&nbsp;difficulty that he was prevailed on to let one of his warriors&nbsp;perform this ceremony in his stead ; but the officer to whom</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rollo deputed this service suddenly raised the king’s foot so high, that he overturned him on his back ; a piece of&nbsp;rudeness which was only laughed at : to such a degree&nbsp;were the Normans feared, and Charles despised. Rollo was&nbsp;soon afterwards persuaded to embrace Christianity, and he&nbsp;was baptized with much ceremony by the archbishop of&nbsp;Rouen, in the cathedral of that city. As soon as he saw&nbsp;himself in full possession of Normandy, he exhibited such&nbsp;virtues as rendered the province happy, and deserved to&nbsp;make his former outrages forgotten. Religious, wise, and&nbsp;liberal, this captain of pirates became, after Alfred, the&nbsp;greatest and most humane prince of his time.</span></p>
