<p><span class="font2">Spain was </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">bound to </span><span class="font2">pay heavy subsidies, which its exhausted treasury was quite unable to afford. The emperor hoped to&nbsp;obtain money. EHzabeth Farnese hoped to secure the Italian&nbsp;duchies for her sons, and some vague stipulations were made&nbsp;that Charles VI. should give his aid for the recovery by Spain&nbsp;of Gibraltar and Minorca. When Ripperda returned to Madrid&nbsp;at the close of 1725 he asserted that the emperor expected&nbsp;him to be made prime minister. The Spanish sovereigns, who&nbsp;were overawed by this quite unfounded assertion, allowed him&nbsp;to grasp the most important posts under the crown. He&nbsp;excited the violent hostility of the Spaniards, and entered&nbsp;into a complication of intrigues with the French and English&nbsp;governments. His career was short. In 1726 the Austrian&nbsp;envoy, who had vainly pressed for the payment of the promised&nbsp;subsidies, came to an explanation with the Spanish sovereigns.&nbsp;It was discovered that Ripperda had not only made promises&nbsp;that he was not authorized to make, but had misappropriated&nbsp;large sums of money. The sovereigns who had made him duke&nbsp;and grandee shrank from covering themselves with ridicule by&nbsp;revealing the way in which they had been deceived. Ripperda&nbsp;was dismissed with the promise of a pension. Being in terror&nbsp;of the hatred of the Spaniards, he took refuge in the English&nbsp;embassy. To secure the favour of the English envoy, Colonel&nbsp;William Stanhope, afterwards Lord Harrington, he betrayed&nbsp;the secrets of his government. Stanhope could not protect&nbsp;him, and he was sent as a prisoner to the castle of Segovia.&nbsp;In 1728 he escaped, probably with the connivance of the government, and made his way to Holland. His last years are obscure.&nbsp;It is said that he reverted to Protestantism, and then went to&nbsp;Morocco, where he became a Mahommedan and commanded&nbsp;the Moors in an unsuccessful attack on Ceuta. But this story&nbsp;is founded on his so-called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs,</span><span class="font2"> which are in fact a Grub-street tale of adventure published at Amsterdam in 1740. AU&nbsp;that is really known is that he did go to Morocco, and that he&nbsp;died at Tetuan in 1737.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RISHANGER, WILLIAM </span><span class="font2">(c. 1250-ύ. 1312), English chronicler, made his profession as a Benedictine at St Alban’s abbey in&nbsp;1271, of which he perhaps became the official chronicler. The&nbsp;most important of his writings is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Narratio de bellis apud&nbsp;Lewes et Evesham.</span><span class="font2"> Though written many years afterwards&nbsp;and drawn from other sources, it is a spirited account of the&nbsp;barons’ war. HeJs so great an admirer of Simon de Montfort&nbsp;that this work has been called a hagiography. He is credited&nbsp;with the authorship of a chronicle covering the period 1259-1306; this has been disputed, but the work is printed under&nbsp;his name by Riley. Another work of his, of not much importance, is a chronicle entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Recapitulatis brevis de gestis&nbsp;domini Edwardi, &amp;c.</span><span class="font2"> He is probably not the author of other&nbsp;works commonly attributed to him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RIST, JOHANN VON (1607-1667), German poet, was born at Ottcnscn in Holstein on the 8th of March 1607; the son of&nbsp;the Lutheran pastor of that place. He received his early&nbsp;training in Hamburg and Bremen; after studying theology&nbsp;at Rinteln and Rostock, he became in 1633 private tutor in a&nbsp;family of Heide, and two years later (1635) was appointed&nbsp;pastor of the village of Wedel on the Elbe, where he laboured&nbsp;until his death on the 31st of August 1667. Rist first made his&nbsp;name known to the literary world by a drama, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Perseus</span><span class="font2"> (1634),&nbsp;which he wrote while at Heide, and in the next succeeding&nbsp;years he produced a number of dramatic works of which the&nbsp;allegory </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Das friedewünschende Teutschland</span><span class="font2"> (1647) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Das&nbsp;friedejauchzende TeutschlanA</span><span class="font2"> (1653) (new ed. of both by H. M.&nbsp;Schletterer, 1864) are the most interesting. Rist soon became&nbsp;the central figure in a school of minor poets, and honours were&nbsp;showered upon him from every side. The emperor Ferdinand&nbsp;III. crowned him laureate in 1644, ennobled him in 1653, and&nbsp;invested him with the dignity of a Count Palatine, an honour&nbsp;which enabled him to crown, and to gain numerous poets for&nbsp;the Elbschwanen order, a literary and poetical society which&nbsp;he founded in 1656. He had already, in 1645, been admitted,&nbsp;under the name “ Daphnis aus Cimhrien,” to the literary order&nbsp;of Pegnitz, and in 1647 he became, as “ Der Rüstige,” a member&nbsp;of the Fruchtbringende Gesellschaft. It is, however, as a writer&nbsp;of church hymns (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hymns)</span><span class="font2"> that Rist is best known to fame.&nbsp;Among these several are still retained in the evangelical hymn&nbsp;book: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ErmunFre dich,&nbsp;mein schwacher Geist.</span><span class="font2"> Collections of his poems appeared&nbsp;under the titles </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Musa Teutonica</span><span class="font2"> (1634) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Himmlische Lieder&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1643)· ....</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RISTITCH (or </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ristich),</span><span class="font2"> JOVAN (1831-1899), Servian statesman, was born at Kragugevats in 1831. He was educated at Belgrade, Heidelberg, Berlin and Paris. After failing to&nbsp;obtain a professorship in the high school of Belgrade, he was&nbsp;appointed in 1861 Servian diplomatic agent at Constantinople.&nbsp;His reputation was enhanced by the series of negotiations&nbsp;which ended in the withdrawal of the Turkish troops from&nbsp;the Servian fortresses in 1867. On his return from Constantinople he was offered a ministerial post by Prince Michael, who&nbsp;described him as “ his right arm,” but declined office, being&nbsp;opposed to the reactionary methods adopted by the prince’s&nbsp;government. He had already hecome the recognized leader&nbsp;of the Liberal party. After the assassination of Prince&nbsp;Michael in 1868, he was nominated member of the council of&nbsp;regency, and on the 2nd January 1869 the first Servian constitution, which was mainly his creation, was promulgated.&nbsp;When Prince Alilan attained his majority in 1872, Ristitch&nbsp;became foreign minister; a few months later he was appointed&nbsp;prime minister, but resigned in the following autumn (1873).&nbsp;He again became prime minister in April 1876, and conducted&nbsp;the two wars against Turkey (July 1876-March 1877 and&nbsp;December 1877-March 1878). At the congress of Berlin he&nbsp;laboured with some success to obtain greater advantages for&nbsp;Servia than had been accorded to her by the treaty of San&nbsp;Stefano. The provisions of the treaty of Berlin, however,&nbsp;disappointed the Servians, owing to the obstacles now raised&nbsp;to the realization of the national programme; the Ristitch&nbsp;government became unpopular, and resigned in 1880. In&nbsp;1887 King Milan (who had assumed the royal title in 1882),&nbsp;alarmed at the threatening attitude of the Radical party,&nbsp;recalled Ristitch to power at the bead of a coalition cabinet;&nbsp;a new constitution <sup>K</sup>was granted in 1888, and in the following&nbsp;year the king abdicated in favour of his son, Prince Alexander.&nbsp;Ristitch now became head of a council of regency, entrusted&nbsp;with power during the minority of the young king, and a&nbsp;Radical ministry was formed. In 1892, however, Ristitch&nbsp;transferred the government to the Liberal party, with which&nbsp;he had always been connected.
