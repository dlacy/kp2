<p><span class="font0">not enjoy what was called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus Itnlicum</span><span class="font0"> ; and long before the time of Justinian it had entirely disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The effects of a mancipation, provided the price had been paid or security given for it, were that the property passed instantly to&nbsp;the purchaser, and that the transferrer was held to warrant the&nbsp;transferee against eviction from the moment the price was received.&nbsp;In the absence of either payment or sureties for it, the title still&nbsp;remained with the vendor, so that it was in his power, by means&nbsp;of a real action, to get back what had been mancipated, even&nbsp;though it had passed into the possession of the vendee. The&nbsp;vendor’s liability to the vendee in the event of eviction is usually&nbsp;supposed to have arisen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ipso jure,</span><span class="font0"> that is to say, without anything&nbsp;expressly said about it; the acceptance by the transferrer of the&nbsp;coin with which the scales had been struck was held to have imposed upon him an obligation to maintain the transferee in possession, under a penalty of double the amount of the price, recoverable&nbsp;by the latter by what is usually called an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio auctoritatis.</span><span class="font0"> But&nbsp;this </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ipso jure</span><span class="font0"> obligation did not arise when the mancipation was&nbsp;either really or fictitiously gratuitous,—really, in the case of donations, &amp;c., fictitiously, when, on purpose to exclude the warranty,&nbsp;the recital of the transferee was that the price was a single sesterce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The right of a vendee to sue an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio auctoritatis</span><span class="font0"> arose only when eviction resulted from a decree in a regular judicial process at the&nbsp;instance of a third party disputing his title, and was conditional&nbsp;on his having done all that was necessary on his part to bring his&nbsp;vendor </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(auctor)</span><span class="font0"> into the field to defend his own interests. And&nbsp;the duration of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">auctoritas</span><span class="font0"> was limited by statute to two years&nbsp;in the case of lands and houses, to one year in the case of other&nbsp;things. As possession for those periods was sufficient to cure any&nbsp;defect in the vendee’s title, it was but reasonable that with their&nbsp;expiry the vendor's liability on his warranty should be at an end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By a provision of the Tables in the very inclusive terms, “cum nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, itajusesto,”&nbsp;the importance of mancipation was immensely increased ; for any&nbsp;sort of qualification germane to the transaction might be superinduced upon it, and the range of its application thus greatly&nbsp;extended. Such qualifications were spoken of as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">leges mancipii,—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">self-imposed terms, conditions, or qualifications of the conveyance,&nbsp;which, as integral parts of the transaction </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram,</span><span class="font0"> partook&nbsp;of its binding character and were law between the parties. The&nbsp;matter of oral declaration might be the acreage of lands, their&nbsp;freedom from burdens or right to easements, reservation of a usufruct, limitation of their mode of use, undertaking to reconvey on&nbsp;a certain event, or what not; the result was just so many obligations created </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram,</span><span class="font0"> whose contravention or denial&nbsp;(Cicero tells us) was punished with a twofold penalty. Ordinarily&nbsp;the words spoken in the hearing of the witnesses fixed the beginning and the end of the liability ; it was enough that they were&nbsp;literally complied with, however much the other party might be&nbsp;injured by something inconsistent with their spirit, or which he&nbsp;had not taken the precaution to require should be made matter of&nbsp;declaration. But there was an exception (although possibly not&nbsp;introduced until long after the Tables) in the case of that particular mancipatory agreement which was known by the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jiducia, i.e.,</span><span class="font0"> where the mancipation was to a creditor in security or&nbsp;to a friend for safe custody, and the engagement was to return the&nbsp;thing mancipated in the one case when the debt secured by it was&nbsp;paid and in the other on demand. In such cases the transferee&nbsp;took the conveyance more in the transferrer’s interest than his own ;&nbsp;he became a trustee, entitled to be treated with consideration, and&nbsp;neither mulcted in a twofold penalty when his inability to reconvey&nbsp;was due to no fault of his, nor forced to reconvey until relieved of&nbsp;charges incurred by him in reference to the property. Accordingly&nbsp;it became the practice to import into the mancipation a reference&nbsp;to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fides—</span><span class="font0">“fidei fiduciae meum esse aio,” with explanation of the&nbsp;purpose, &amp;c., of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fiducia</span><span class="font0"> in the relative </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex mancipii</span><span class="font0">; this had&nbsp;the effect of freeing alike the right of the vendor and the obligation&nbsp;of the vendee from the hard-and-fast lines of they ms </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">strichim,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;subordinating them to the principles of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bona fides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Of</span><span class="font0"> the civil modes of acquiring property on singular title applicable to both </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res nee mancipi</span><span class="font0"> surrender in court </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{injure cessio)</span><span class="font0"> was just a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rei vindicatio</span><span class="font0"> arrested in its initial stage.&nbsp;The parties, cedent and cessionary, appeared before the magistrate ;&nbsp;the cessionary, taking the position of plaintiff, declared the thing&nbsp;his in quiritary right; the cedent, as defendant, was asked what&nbsp;he had to say in answer; and, on his admission or silence, the&nbsp;magistrate at once pronounced a decree </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(addictio)</span><span class="font0"> which completed&nbsp;the transfer, but which might be subject to a condition or other&nbsp;limitation, or even to a fiduciary reservation. It was probably more&nbsp;resorted to for the constitution of servitudes, both real and personal,&nbsp;and transfer of such rights as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas,</span><span class="font0"> tutory-at-law of a&nbsp;woman, or an inheritance that had already vested, than for conveyance of property. For it was not only inconvenient, inasmuch&nbsp;as it required the parties to appear before the supreme magistrate&nbsp;in Rome, and could not be carried through by a slave on his&nbsp;owner’s behalf (as mancipation might), but it had the serious disadvantage that it did not </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ipso jure</span><span class="font0"> imply any warranty of title by&nbsp;the cedent or afford the cessionary any action against him in the&nbsp;event of eviction. The reason was that in form the right of the&nbsp;cessionary flowed from the magisterial decree,—“Since you say&nbsp;the thing is yours, and the cedent does not say it is his,, I declare&nbsp;it yours,”—and not from any act or word of the cedent’s, who was&nbsp;passive in the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Adjudication was the decree of a judge in a divisory action, such as one for partition of an inheritance amongst co-heirs ; it conferred upon each of them a separate and independent right in a&nbsp;part of what as a whole had previously been joint property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Usucapion,@@<sup>1</sup> regulated by the XII. Tables, but not improbably recognized previously in a vague and uncertain way, converted uninterrupted possession (ws«s) into quiritary property by efflux of time. The provision in the&nbsp;Tables was to this effect—“ usus auctoritas fundi biennium&nbsp;esto, ceterarum rerum annuus esto.” The relation in which&nbsp;the words </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">usus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auctoritas</span><span class="font1"> stand to each other has&nbsp;been a subject of much discussion : the prevailing opinion&nbsp;amongst modern civilians is that the first alone refers to&nbsp;usucapion, and the second to the warranty of title incumbent on the vendor in a mancipation, and that both were&nbsp;limited to two years in the case of lands (and, by extensive&nbsp;interpretation, houses), and to one year in the case of anything else. In the later jurisprudence the possession required to be based on a sufficient title and the possessor&nbsp;to be in good faith. But the decemviral code, as is now&nbsp;generally admitted, contained no such requirements ; any&nbsp;citizen occupying immovables or holding movables as his&nbsp;own, provided they were usucaptible and he had not&nbsp;taken them theftuously, acquired a quiritary right in two&nbsp;years or one, as the case might be, simply on the strength&nbsp;of his possession. Originally, therefore, it was simply the&nbsp;conversion of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> possession, no matter how acquired&nbsp;so long as not by theft, into legal ownership when prolonged for the statutory period,—too often the maintenance of might at the cost of right. But in time it came&nbsp;to be regarded rather as a remedy for some defect of title,&nbsp;arising either from irregularity of conveyance or incapacity&nbsp;of the party from whom a transfer had been taken; and&nbsp;with the progress of jurisprudence it developed into the&nbsp;carefully regulated positive prescription which has found&nbsp;a place in every modern system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The conception of the abstract notion of a real right in (or over) the property of another person </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(jus in re aliena)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is not to be looked for at so early a period in the history&nbsp;of the law as that now under consideration. The rural&nbsp;servitudes of way and water were no doubt very early recognized, for they ranked as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> and the XII.&nbsp;Tables contained various regulations in reference to the&nbsp;former. Usufruct, too, was probably not unknown ; but&nbsp;the urban praedial servitudes bear the impress of a somewhat later jurisprudence. Pignorate and hypothecary&nbsp;rights were unknown as rights protected by action at the&nbsp;time now being dealt with.<sup>2</sup> Between private parties the&nbsp;only thing legally recognized of the nature of a real&nbsp;security was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fiducia</span><span class="font1"> that is described above. Approaching more nearly to the modern idea of a mortgage&nbsp;was the security </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praedibus praediisque</span><span class="font1"> required by the&nbsp;state from those indebted to it in assurance of their obligations. Here there was the double guarantee of sureties&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(jpraedes')</span><span class="font1"> and mortgaged lands of theirs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(praedia subsig-</span></p>
