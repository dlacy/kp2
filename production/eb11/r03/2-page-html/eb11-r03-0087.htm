<p><span class="font0">considerable rainfall during the second period in most years. The only exceptions arc rivers which have their sources amongst&nbsp;mountains clad with perpetual snow, and arc fed by glaciers;&nbsp;their floods occur in the summer from the melting of the snows&nbsp;and ice, as exemplified by the Rhone above the Lake of Geneva,&nbsp;and the Arve which joins it below. But even these rivers arc&nbsp;liable to have their flow modified by the influx of tributaries&nbsp;subject to different conditions, so that the Rhone below Lyons&nbsp;has a more uniform discharge than most rivers, as the summer&nbsp;floods of the Arve arc counteracted to a great extent by the low&nbsp;stage of the Saône flowing into the Rhone at Lyons, which has&nbsp;its floods in the winter when the Arve on the contrary*is low.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Transportation of Materials by Rivers.—</span><span class="font0">Another serious obstacle encountered in the improvement of rivers consists in the large quantity of detritus brought down by them in flood-time,&nbsp;derived mainly from the disintegration of the surface-layers of&nbsp;the hills and slopes in the upper parts of the valleys by glaciers,&nbsp;frost and rain. The power of a current to transport materials&nbsp;varies with its velocity, so that torrents with a rapid fall near the&nbsp;sources of rivers can carry down rocks, boulders and large stones,&nbsp;which are by degrees ground by attrition in their onward course&nbsp;into shingle, gravel, sand and silt, simultaneously with the gradual&nbsp;reduction in fall, and, consequently, in the transporting force of&nbsp;the current. Accordingly, under ordinary conditions, most of&nbsp;the materials brought down from the high lands by the torrential&nbsp;water-courses are carried forward by the main river to the sea, or&nbsp;partially strewn over flat alluvial plains during floods; and the&nbsp;size of the materials forming the bed of the river or bome along&nbsp;by the stream is gradually reduced on proceeding seawards, so&nbsp;that in the Po, for instance, pebbles and gravel are found for&nbsp;about 140 m. below Turin, sand along the next 100 m., and&nbsp;silt and mud in the last no m. When, however, the fall is&nbsp;largely and abruptly reduced, as in the case of rivers emerging&nbsp;straight from mountainous slopes upon flat plains, deposit&nbsp;necessarily occurs, from the materials being either too large or&nbsp;too great in volume to be bome along by the enfeebled current;&nbsp;and if the impeded river is unable to spread this detritus over the&nbsp;plains, its bed becomes raised by deposit, causing the river in&nbsp;flood-time to rise to a higher level. The materials, moreover,&nbsp;which are carried in suspension or rolled along the bed of the&nbsp;river to the sea, tend to deposit when the flow of the river&nbsp;slackens and is finally brought to rest on encountering the great&nbsp;inert mass of the sea, especially in the absence of a tide and any&nbsp;littoral current, and this is the cause of the formation of deltas&nbsp;with their shallow outlets, barring the approach to many large&nbsp;rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Influence of Lakes on Rivers.—</span><span class="font0">Sometimes a peculiar depression along part of a valley, with a rocky barrier at its lower end,&nbsp;causes the formation of a lake in the course of the river flowing&nbsp;down the valley. The intervention of a lake makes the river,&nbsp;on entering at the upper end, deposit all the materials with which&nbsp;it is charged in the still waters of the lake; and it issues at the&nbsp;lower end as a perfectly clear stream, which has also a very&nbsp;regular discharge, as its floods, in flowing into the lake, are&nbsp;spread over a large surface, and so produce only a very slight&nbsp;raising of the level. This effect is illustrated by the river&nbsp;Rhone, which enters the Lake of Geneva as a very turbid,&nbsp;torrential, glacier stream, and emerges at Geneva as a sparkling,&nbsp;limpid river with a very uniform flow, though in this particular&nbsp;case the improvement is not long maintained, owing to the&nbsp;confluence a short distance below Geneva of the large, rapid,&nbsp;glacial river, the Arve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The influence of lakes on rivers is, indeed, wholly beneficial, in consequence of the removal of their burden of detritus and&nbsp;the regulation of their flow. Thus the Neva, conveying the&nbsp;outflow from Lake Ladoga to the Baltic, is relieved by the&nbsp;lake from the detritus brought down by the rivers flowing into&nbsp;the lake; and the Svnne outlet channel of the Oder into the&nbsp;Baltic is freed from sediment by the river having to pass through&nbsp;the Stettiner Haff before reaching its mouth. The St Lawrence,&nbsp;again, deriving most of its supply from the chain of Great Lakes&nbsp;of North America, possesses a very uniform flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">River Channels.—</span><span class="font0">The discharge of the rainfall erodes the beds of rivers along the lowest parts of the valleys; but floods&nbsp;occur too intermittently to form and maintain a channel large&nbsp;enough to contain the flow. A river channel, indeed, generally&nbsp;suffices approximately to carry off the average flow of the river,&nbsp;which, whilst comprising considerable fluctuations in volume,&nbsp;furnishes a sufficiently constant erosive action to maintain a&nbsp;fairly regular channel; though rivers having soft beds and&nbsp;carrying down sediment erode their beds during floods and&nbsp;deposit alluvium in dry weather. As the velocity of a stream&nbsp;increases with its fall, the size of a channel conveying a definite&nbsp;average flow varies inversely with the fall, and the depth&nbsp;inversely with the width. A river channel, accordingly, often&nbsp;presents considerable irregularities in section, forming shallow&nbsp;rapids when the river flows over a rocky barrier with a considerable fall, and consisting of a succession of pools and shoals&nbsp;when the bed varies in compactness and there arc differences&nbsp;in width, or when the river flows round a succession of bends&nbsp;along opposite banks alternately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A river flowing through a flat alluvial plain has its current very readily deflected by any chance obstruction or by any&nbsp;difference in hardness of the banks, and generally follows a&nbsp;winding course, which tends to be intensified by the erosion&nbsp;of the concave banks in the bends from the current impinging&nbsp;against them in altering its direction round the curves. Sometimes also a large river, bringing down a considerable amount&nbsp;of detritus, shifts its course from time to time, owing to the&nbsp;obstruction produced by banks of deposit, as exemplified by&nbsp;the Po in traversing the portion of the Lombardy plains between&nbsp;Casale and the confluence of the Ticino.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Floods of Rivers.</span><span class="font0">—The rise of rivers in flood-time depends not merely on the amount of the rainfall, but also on its distribution and the nature of the strata on which it falls. The&nbsp;upper hilly part of a river basin consists generally of impermeable strata, sometimes almost bare of vegetation; and the&nbsp;rain flowing quickly down the impervious, sloping ground&nbsp;into the water-courses and tributaries feeding the main river&nbsp;produces rapidly rising and high floods in these streams, which&nbsp;soon pass down on the cessation of the rain. The river Marne,&nbsp;draining an impermeable part of the Upper Seine basin, is&nbsp;subject to these sudden torrential floods in the cold season,&nbsp;as illustrated by a diagram of the variations in height of the&nbsp;river at St Dizier from November to March 1903-4 (fig. 2).&nbsp;On the contrary, rain falling on permeable strata takes longer&nbsp;in reaching the rivers; and the floods of these rivers rise more&nbsp;gradually, are less high, continue longer and subside more&nbsp;slowly than in rivers draining impervious Strata, as indicated&nbsp;by the diagram of the Little Seine at Nogent during the same&nbsp;period, which has a permeable basin (fig. 1). A main river&nbsp;fed by several tributaries, some from impermeable and others&nbsp;from permeable strata, experiences floods of a mixed character,&nbsp;as shown by the diagram of the same floods in 1903-4 of the&nbsp;Seine at Paris, below the confluence of the torrential Mamc&nbsp;and Yonne, where the floods of the gently flowing Upper Seine&nbsp;and other tributaries with permeable basins also contribute to&nbsp;the rise of the river (fig. 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">High floods are caused by a heavy rainfall on land already sodden by recent rains at a period of the year when evaporation&nbsp;is inactive, and especially by rain falling on melting snow. A&nbsp;fairly simultaneous rainfall over the greater part of a moderatesized river basin is a tolerably common occurrence; and under&nbsp;such conditions, the floods coming from the torrential tributaries reach their maximum height and begin to subside&nbsp;before the floods from the gently flowing tributaries attain&nbsp;their greatest rise. Exceptional floods, accordingly, only occur&nbsp;in a main river when a heavy rainfall takes place at such&nbsp;periods over different parts of the basin that the floods of the&nbsp;various tributaries coincide approximately in attaining their&nbsp;maximum at certain points in the main river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mitigation of Floods and Protection from Inundatioits.—</span><span class="font0">As the size of the channel of a river is generally quite inadequate&nbsp;to carry down the discharge of floods, the river overflows its</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
