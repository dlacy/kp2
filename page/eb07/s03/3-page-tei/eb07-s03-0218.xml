But this statement does not appear to be borne out by the earlier authorities on the subject of Athenian legislation. Nor is it probable that a law should have been enacted, directly sanctioning a form of polygamy. It appears, that during the pressure and confusion of the Peloponnesian war, persons obtained the freedom of the city of Athens, whose title was objectionable on the constitutional ground of their not being bom of citizen-parents on both sides. Thus had Pericles, after the death of his two legitimate sons, obtained the admission of his son, Pericles, by Aspasia, to the privilege of citizenship ;@@<hi rend="superscript">4</hi> though he had himself carried, some time before, a law of strict limitation, under which, nearly four thousand were deprived of the franchise.@@<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> Such extension of the privilege to the offspring of illegal unions, possibly gave a pretext to the supposition, that a decree passed at Athens sanctioning bigamy.</p><p>Some difficulty, however, arises on the subject of the marriage of Socrates, from the conflict of authorities. Whilst it is asserted on the one hand, that he was married to Myrto and Xanthippe at the same time; on the other hand, others assign them both as his wives, but in succession, and also differ as to the order of succession. But the silence of Plato and Xenophon respecting any other wife of Socrates butXan- thippe, and their coincidence in speaking of her only as the mother of his children, may be regarded as sufficiently decisive of the point against every subsequent authority. Indeed, the reference to Aristotle, given by Laertius, which is the chief ground for believing that Socrates was married also to Myrto, is very questionable. Plutarch doubts whether the treatise to which Laertius appeals for the fact, is the genuine work of Aristotle. From the manner, too, in which the name of Myrto appears to have been introduced in the account, nothing more may have been intended, than that Socrates found her in a state of widowhood and distress from poverty, and took care of her at his own home.@@<hi rend="superscript">7</hi> Aristides belonged to the same tribe and the same demus or borough, as Socrates; and a reverence for the virtues of the grandfather, may have combined with these almost domestic ties, to call forth such an act of friendliness to the disconsolate Myrto. And, if this be the case, as is probable, it would only add an interesting instance of that liberal benevolence which characterized the whole conduct of Socrates.@@<hi rend="superscript">8</hi></p><p>It is a confirmation of this conclusion, that all the anecdotes of the private life of Socrates, with one exception, and that evidently a fabricated instance,@@<hi rend="superscript">9</hi> bring Xanthippe on the scene. On his inviting some wealthy persons to supper, it is Xanthippe who is distressed by their deficient means of hospitality, and to whom he replies, “Takecourage; if they are worthy people, they will be satisfied; if they are worthless, we shall care nothing about them.”@@<hi rend="superscript">10</hi> It is Xanthippe whom he reproves for her particularity about her dress on the occasion of some public spectacle, as more desirous of “ being seen than to see.”@@<hi rend="superscript">11</hi> It is of her again that Alcibiades expressed his wonder how he could bear with her, when he simply, but pointedly referred him to her just claims on his affection as the mother of his children.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>* On another occasion, his disciple, Antisthenes, is said to have asked him, with reference to Xanthippe, why he did not study to improve the disposition of his wife, whose violence of temper (he observed) was unexampled in the history of domestic life. Instead of confirming the censorious remark, he turned it, according to his usual method, to a practical illustration of his philosophy. “ If Xanthippe was hard to be controlled,” was the tenour of his answer, “ it was only a proper discipline to him for the management of men ; as those who would be masters in horsemanship, began with managing the most spirited horse, after which, every other would be tractable.”@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>’ These stories, and the like, handed down or invented by the humour of the times, may be merely exaggerations of the fact of the inconvenience and dissatisfaction occasionally felt at the philosopher’s home, by his habitual neglect of his domestic concerns, and the duty of exertion consequently imposed on Xanthippe beyond Athenian women in general. She appears indeed to have tenderly loved her husband, if Plato has faithfully traced the picture of her visit to his prison, and her extreme anguish at that trying hour. And he also knew her value, if his affection may be judged of, as surely it may, by the kind and gentle considerateness of his manner in committing her to the care of his friends at parting, and his absolute reserve of his feelings on that occasion.@@<hi rend="superscript">14</hi> The picture indeed is drawn by the hand of a consummate master ; and Plato, it is true, was not present on the occasion. But we must believe, that in painting a scene that must have been impressed on the mind of the disciples of the philosopher, above every other incident of his life, and of which persons then living must have retained a lively recollection, he took his outlines at least of these interesting particulars from the real state of the case.</p><p>But the allusion to these circumstances brings us prematurely to the solemn tragedy which closed his intrepid and energetic career. We have yet to contemplate him pursuing tor many a year his unwearied labour of awakening his countrymen from their dreams of knowledge and happiness to the realities of their condition in the world. Great indeed must have been the address, which could recommend the severe and wholesome truths inculcated by him, to the hearing of the vain and volatile Athenians. To none is the practical application of a principle, so condemnatory of human folly and impertinence, as the maxim, “ know thyself,” truly welcome. And yet this was the burthen of the teaching of Socrates for a series of years, among a people, whom it was far easier to please by praising to excess, than not to displease by censuring ever so slightly. They would listen, indeed, patiently to general invectives on their publicconduct, conveyed in the impassioned eloquence of their orators ; as persons will even now sympathize with general descriptions of the depravity of human nature, or of whole classes of men.
