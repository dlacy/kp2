<p><span class="font1">Charles, 3rd duke of Richmond (1735-1806), was one of the most remarkable men of the 18th century, being chiefly famous&nbsp;for his advanced views on the question of parliamentary reform.&nbsp;Having succeeded to the peerage in 1750, he was appointed&nbsp;British ambassador extraordinary in Paris in 1765, and in the&nbsp;following year he became a secretary of state in the Rockingham&nbsp;administration, resigning office on the accession to power of the&nbsp;earl of Chatham. In the debates on the policy that led to the&nbsp;War of American Independence Richmond was a firm supporter&nbsp;of the colonists; and he initiated the debate in 1778 calling&nbsp;for the removal of the troops from America, during which&nbsp;Chatham was seized by his fatal illness. He also advocated a&nbsp;policy of concession in Ireland, with reference to which he&nbsp;originated the phrase “ a union of hearts ” which long afterwards&nbsp;became famous when his use of it had been forgotten. In 1779&nbsp;the duke brought forward a motion for retrenchment of the&nbsp;civil list; and in 1780 he embodied in a bill his proposals&nbsp;for parliamentary reform, which included manhood suffrage,&nbsp;annual parliaments and equal electoral areas. Richmond sat&nbsp;in Rockingham’s second cabinet as master-general of ordnance;&nbsp;and in 1784 he joined the ministry of William Pitt. He now&nbsp;developed strongly tory opinions, and his alleged desertion of&nbsp;the cause of reform led to a violent attack on him by Lauderdale&nbsp;in 1792, which nearly led to a duel between the two noblemen.&nbsp;Richmond died in December 1806, and, leaving no legitimate&nbsp;children, he was succeeded in the peerage by his nephew Charles,&nbsp;son of his brother, General Lord George Henry Lennox.</span></p>

He was&nbsp;afterwards a vehement opponent in the House of Lords of&nbsp;Roman Catholic emancipation, and at a later date a leader of&nbsp;the opposition to Peel’s free trade policy. In 1836, on inheriting&nbsp;the estates of his maternal uncle, the 5th and last duke of&nbsp;Gordon, he assumed the name of Gordon before that of Lennox.&nbsp;On his death in 1860 he was succeeded in his titles by his son&nbsp;Charles Henry, 6th duke of Richmond (1818-1903), a statesman&nbsp;who held various cabinet offices in the Conservative administrations of Lord Derby, Disraeli and the marquess of Salisbury;&nbsp;and who in 1876 was created earl of Kinrara and duke of Gordon.&nbsp;These honours in addition to the numerous family titles of more&nbsp;ancient creation passed on his death in 1903 to his son Charles&nbsp;Henry Gordon-Lennox (b. 1845), 7th duke of Richmond and&nbsp;Lennox and 2nd duke of Gordon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">painter and decorator, was born in London on the 29th of November 1842. His father, George Richmond, R.A. (1809-1896), himself the son of a successful miniature painter, was a&nbsp;distinguished artist, who painted the portraits of the most eminent&nbsp;people of his day, and played an important part in society.&nbsp;At the age of fourteen William Richmond entered the Royal&nbsp;Academy schools, where he worked for about three years. A&nbsp;visit to Italy in 1859 gave him special opportunity for studying&nbsp;the works of the old masters, and had an important effect upon&nbsp;his development. His first Academy picture was a portrait&nbsp;group (1861); and to this succeeded, during the next three&nbsp;years, several other pictures of the same class. In 1865 he&nbsp;returned to Italy, and spent four years there,· living chiefly at&nbsp;Rome. To this period belongs the large canvas. “ A Procession&nbsp;in Honour of Bacchus,” which he exhibited at the Academy&nbsp;in 1869 when he came back to England. His picture, “ An&nbsp;Audience at Athens,” was exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery&nbsp;in 1885. He became Slade professor at Oxford, succeeding&nbsp;Ruskin, in 1878, but resigned three years later. He was elected&nbsp;an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1888 and Royal Academician in 1895; he received the degree of D.C.L. in 1896, and&nbsp;a knighthood of the Bath in 1897, and became professor of&nbsp;painting to the Royal Academy. Apart from his pictures, he&nbsp;is notable for his work in decorative art, his most conspicuous&nbsp;achievement being the internal decoration and the glass mosaics&nbsp;of St Paul’s Cathedral. Sir William Richmond also took a&nbsp;keen interest in social questions, particularly in smoke-prevention&nbsp;in London. </span></p>
