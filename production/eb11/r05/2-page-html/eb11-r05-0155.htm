<p><span class="font1">the one strove to erect bulwarks against French aggression, the other was preparing the ground for fresh annexations.&nbsp;During 1803-4 the breach between the two rivals widened,&nbsp;because Napoleon became more and more aggressive and&nbsp;unceremonious in Italy and Germany. Before the end of 1803&nbsp;Alexander had come to perceive the necessity of resisting him&nbsp;energetically in order to save Europe from complete subjection,&nbsp;and in August 1804 he recognized that an armed conflict was&nbsp;inevitable. It broke out in the following year, and after the&nbsp;battles of Austerlitz (December 1805) and Friedland (June 1807),&nbsp;in which the Russians were completely defeated, the two&nbsp;sovereigns had their famous interviews at Tilsit, at which they&nbsp;not only made peace but agreed to divide the world between&nbsp;them, with a sublime indifference to the interests of other&nbsp;states. The grandiose project was at once vaguely outlined&nbsp;in three formal documents, to the intense satisfaction of both&nbsp;parties, and on both sides there was much rejoicing at the&nbsp;conclusion of such an auspicious alliance; but the diplomatic&nbsp;honeymoon was not of long duration. The mutual assurances&nbsp;of unbounded confidence, admiration and sympathy, if there&nbsp;was any genuine sincerity in them, represented merely a&nbsp;transient state of feeling. Napoleon, who could brook no&nbsp;equal, was nourishing the secret hope that his confederate&nbsp;might be used as a docile subordinate in the realization of&nbsp;his own plans, and the confederate soon came to suspect that&nbsp;he was being duped. His suspicions were intensified by the&nbsp;hostile criticisms of the Tilsit arrangement among bis own&nbsp;subjects and by the arbitrary conduct of his ally, who continued&nbsp;his aggressions in reckless fashion as if he were sole master&nbsp;of Europe. The sovereigns of Sardinia, Naples, Portugal&nbsp;and Spain were dethroned, the pope was driven from Rome,&nbsp;the Rhine Confederation was extended till France obtained a&nbsp;footing on the Baltic, the grand-duchy of Warsaw was reorganized and strengthened, the promised evacuation of Prussia&nbsp;was indefinitely postponed, an armistice between Russia and&nbsp;Turkey was negotiated by French diplomacy in such a way&nbsp;that the Russian troops should evacuate the Danubian principalities, which Alexander intended to annex to his empire,&nbsp;and the scheme for breaking up the Ottoman empire and&nbsp;ruining England by the conquest of India, which had been&nbsp;one of the most attractive baits in the Tilsit negotiations, but&nbsp;which had not been formulated in the treaty, was no longer&nbsp;spoken of. At the same time Napoleon threatened openly&nbsp;to crush Austria, and in 1809 he carried out his threat by&nbsp;defeating the Austrian armies at Wagram and elsewhere, and&nbsp;dictating the treaty of Schônbrunn (October 14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Russia now remained the only unconquered power on the continent, and it was evident that the final struggle with her&nbsp;could not be long delayed. It began in 1812 by the advance of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Grande Armée</span><span class="font1"> on Moscow, and it ended in 1815 at Waterloo.&nbsp;During those three years Alexander was the chief antagonist of&nbsp;Napoleon, and it was largely due to his skill and persistency that&nbsp;the allies held together and freed Europe permanently from the&nbsp;Napoleonic domination. When peace was finally concluded, he&nbsp;had obtained that predominant position in European politics&nbsp;which had been the object of his ambition since the commencement of his reign, and he now believed firmly that he had been&nbsp;chosen by Providence to secure the happiness of the world in&nbsp;general and of the European nations in particular. In the&nbsp;fulfilment of this supposed mission be was not very successful,&nbsp;because his conception of national happiness and the&nbsp;means of obtaining it differed widely from that of the&nbsp;peoples whom he wished to benefit. They had fought&nbsp;for freedom in order to liberate themselves not only&nbsp;from the yoke of Napoleon but also from the tyranny&nbsp;of their own governments, whereas he expected them to remain&nbsp;submissively under the patriarchal institutions which their native&nbsp;rulers imposed on them. Thus, in spite of his academic s&gt;m-pathy with liberal ideas, he became, together with Metternich,&nbsp;a champion of political stagnation, and co-operated willingly&nbsp;in the reactionary measures against the revolutionary movements in Germany, Italy and Spain. In the affairs of his own&nbsp;country he refrained from developing and extending the liberal&nbsp;institutions which he had created immediately after his accession,&nbsp;and he finally adopted in all departments of administration a&nbsp;strongly reactionary policy. This naturally caused profound&nbsp;disappointment and dissatisfaction in the liberal section of the&nbsp;educated classes and especially among the young officers of&nbsp;the regiments which had spent some years in western Europe.&nbsp;Some of these officers had been in touch with the revolutionary&nbsp;movements, and had adopted the idea then prevalent in France,&nbsp;Germany and Italy that the best instrument for assuring&nbsp;political progress was to be found in secret societies. In Russia&nbsp;such societies began to be formed about 1816. The tsar, though&nbsp;he came to know of their existence, refrained from taking repressive measures against them, and when he died suddenly at&nbsp;Taganrog on the 1st of December 1825, two of them made an&nbsp;attempt to realize their political aspirations. The heir to the&nbsp;throne was the late tsar’s eldest brother, Constantine, but he&nbsp;declined, for private reasons, to accept the succession,&nbsp;and a few days elapsed before tbe second brother,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nicholas, was proclaimed emperor. Taking advantage of this short interregnum, some members of the secret societies,&nbsp;mostly officers of the Guards, organized a mutiny among the&nbsp;troops quartered in St Petersburg and in Podolia, with a view&nbsp;to effecting a political revolution, but the movement was easily&nbsp;suppressed, and the ringleaders, known subsequently as the&nbsp;Decembrists, were severely punished (see Nicholas I.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nicholas was a blunt soldier incapable of comprehending his brother’s sentimental sympathy with liberalism. The&nbsp;Decembrists’ abortive attempt at revolution* and the Polish&nbsp;insurrection of 1831, which he crushed with great severity,&nbsp;confirmed.him in his conviction that Russia must be ruled&nbsp;with a strong hand. That conviction he put into practice&nbsp;with extreme rigour during tbe thirty years of his reign (1825-55), endeavouring by every means at his disposal to prevent&nbsp;revolutionary ideas from germinating spontaneously among&nbsp;his subjects and from being imported from abroad. For this&nbsp;purpose he created a very severe press-censorship and an&nbsp;expensive system of passports, which made it more difficult for&nbsp;Russians to visit foreign countries. It would be unjust, however,&nbsp;to say that he was the determined enemy of all progress.&nbsp;Progress was to be made in certain directions and in a certain&nbsp;way. Not only was the army t </span><span class="font0">J </span><span class="font1">be well drilled and the fleet&nbsp;to be carefully equipped, but railways were to be constructed,&nbsp;river-navigation was to be facilitated, manufacturing industry&nbsp;was to be developed, commerce was to be encouraged, the&nbsp;administration was to be improved, the laws were to be codified&nbsp;and the tribunals were to be reorganized. All this was to be&nbsp;done, however, under the strict supervision and guidance of tbe&nbsp;autocratic power, with as little aid as possible from private&nbsp;initiative and with no control whatever of public opinion,&nbsp;because influential public opinion is apt to produce insubordination. When the results proved unsatisfactory, remedies were&nbsp;sought in increased administrative supervision, draconian&nbsp;legislation and severe punishment, and no attempt was made&nbsp;to get out of the vicious circle. In the last months of his life,&nbsp;under the influence of a great national disaster, the conscientious,&nbsp;persistent autocrat began to suspect that his system was a&nbsp;mistake, but he still clung to it obstinately. “ Aly successor,”&nbsp;he is reported to have said on his death-bed, “ may do as he&nbsp;pleases, but I cannot change 1 ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This steadfast faith in autocratic methods and the exaggerated fear of revolutionary principles were shown in foreign as well as&nbsp;in home affairs. Like Alexander in the last period of his reign,&nbsp;Nicholas considered himself tbe supreme guardian of European&nbsp;order, and was ever on the watch to oppose revolution in all its&nbsp;forms. Hence he was generally in strained relations with France,&nbsp;especially in the time of Louis Philippe, who became king not&nbsp;by the grace of God but by the will of the people. During the&nbsp;revolutionary ferment of 1848-49 he urged the Prussian king&nbsp;to refuse the imperial crown, co-operated with the Austrian&nbsp;emperor in suppressing the Hungarian insurrection, and compelled the Prussians to withdraw their support from tbe insurgents</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
