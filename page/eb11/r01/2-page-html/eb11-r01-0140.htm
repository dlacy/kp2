<p><span class="font2">walls with paintings in the more developed but less truly decorative style of Raphael. It was not without regret that Raphael saw the destruction </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">this noble series of frescoes. One vault,&nbsp;that of the Stanza dell' Incendio, painted by his master Perugino,&nbsp;he saved from obliteration; it still exists, well preserved, a&nbsp;most skilful piece of decorative work; and he also set his&nbsp;pupils to copy a number of portrait-heads in the frescoes of&nbsp;Piero della Francesca before they were destroyed.@@<sup>1</sup> Fig. 3&nbsp;shows the positions of Raphael’s frescoes in the stanze, which,&nbsp;both from tbeir size and method of lighting, are very unsuited&nbsp;for the reception of these large pictures. The two most important rooms ( A and B) are small, and have an awkward cross-light from opposite windows.<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Stanza della Segnatura (papal signature room), painted in 1509-11 (A on fig. 3). The first painting executed by Raphael in the stanze&nbsp;was the so-called Disputa, finished in 1509. It is very unlike the&nbsp;later ones in style, showing the beginning of transition from his&nbsp;Florentine to his “Roman manner”; as a decorative work it&nbsp;is very superior to the other frescoes; the figures are much smaller&nbsp;in scale, as was suited to the very moderate size of the room, and&nbsp;the whole is arranged mainly on one plane, without those strong&nbsp;effects of perspective which are so unsuited to the decorative treatment of a wall-surface. In its religious sentiment, too, it far excels&nbsp;any of the later stanze paintings, retaining much of the sacred&nbsp;character of earlier Florentine and Umbrian art. As a scheme of&nbsp;decoration it appears to have been suggested by some of the early&nbsp;apsidal mosaics. Fig. 4 shows the disposition of its main masses,&nbsp;which seem to indicate the curved recess of an apse. Gold is largely used,&nbsp;with much richness of effect, while&nbsp;the later purely pictorial frescoes have&nbsp;little or none. The subject of this&nbsp;magnificent painting is the hierarchy&nbsp;of the church on earth and its glory&nbsp;in heaven.<sup>8</sup> The angels in the upper&nbsp;tier and the nude cherubs who carry&nbsp;the books of the Gospels are among the&nbsp;most beautiful figures that Raphael</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ever painted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The painting on the vault of this room is the next in date, and shows&nbsp;further transition towards the “ Roman&nbsp;manner.” In his treatment of the whole&nbsp;Raphael has, with much advantage, been&nbsp;partly guided by the painting of Perugino’s vault in the next room&nbsp;(C). Though not without faults, it is a very skilful piece of decoration; the pictures are kept subordinate to the lines of the vault,&nbsp;and their small scale adds greatly to the apparent size of the whole.&nbsp;A great part of the ground is gilt, marked with mosaic-like squares,&nbsp;a common practice with decorative painters—not intended to deceive the eye, but simply to give a softer texture to the gilt surface&nbsp;by breaking up its otherwise monotonous glare. The principal&nbsp;medallions in each cell of this quadripartite vault are very graceful&nbsp;female figures, representing Theology, Science, Justice, and Poetry.&nbsp;Smaller subjects, some almost miniature-like in scale, are arranged&nbsp;in the intermediate spaces, and each has some special meaning in&nbsp;reference to the medallion it adjoins; some of these are painted&nbsp;in warm monochrome to suggest bas-reliefs. The fine painting&nbsp;of the “ Flaying of Marsyas ” is interesting as showing Raphael's study&nbsp;of antique sculpture: the figure of Marsyas is a copy of a Roman&nbsp;statue, of which several replicas exist. The very beautiful little&nbsp;picture of the “ Temptation of Eve ” recalls Albert Dürer’s treatment&nbsp;of that subject, though only vaguely. Much mutual admiration&nbsp;existed between Raphael and Durer: in 1515 Raphael sent the&nbsp;German artist a most masterly life study of two nude male figures&nbsp;(now at Vienna) ; on it is written in Albert Dürer’s beautiful hand&nbsp;the date and a record of its being a gift from Raphael. It is executed&nbsp;in red chalk, and was a study for two figures in the “ Battle of Ostia ”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">On the wall opposite the Disputa is the so-called School of Athens.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">In this and the succeeding frescoes all notion of decorative treatment is thrown aside, and Raphael has simply painted a magnificent series of paintings, treated as easel pictures might have been, with but little reference to their architectural surroundings.@@<sup>6</sup> The&nbsp;subject of this noble fresco, in contrast to that opposite, is “ Earthly&nbsp;Knowledge,” represented by an assembly of the great philosophers,&nbsp;poets and men of science of ancient Greece. The central figures&nbsp;are Plato and Aristotle, while below and on each side are groups&nbsp;arranged with the most consummate skill, including the whole&nbsp;“ fìlosofica famiglia ” of Dante </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Infer.</span><span class="font1"> iv. 133-144), and a number of&nbsp;other leaders of thought, selected in a way that shows no slight&nbsp;acquaintance with the history of philosophy and science among the&nbsp;ancient Greeks. Many interesting portraits are introduced—&nbsp;Bramante as the aged Archimedes, stooping over a geometrical&nbsp;diagram; a beautiful fair-haired youth on the left is Francesco&nbsp;Maria della Rovere, duke of Urbino; and on the extreme right&nbsp;figures of Raphael himself and Sodoma are introduced (see fig. 5,&nbsp;below). The stately building in which these groups are arranged is&nbsp;taken with modifications from Bramante’s first design for St Peter’s.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Over the window (No. 6 on fig. 3) is a group of poets and musicians on Mount Parnassus, round a central figure of Apollo; it contains&nbsp;many heads of great beauty and fine portraits of Dante and Petrarch.&nbsp;The former, as a theologian, appears also in the Disputa. Over&nbsp;the opposite window (No. 5) are graceful figures of the three chief&nbsp;Virtues, and at one side (No. 4) Gregory IX. (a portrait of Julius&nbsp;II.) presenting his volume of decretals to a jurist; beside him is&nbsp;a splendid portrait of Cardinal de’ Medici (afterwards Leo X.)&nbsp;before his face was spoiled by getting too stout. This painting shows&nbsp;the influence of Melozzo da Forli.@@<sup>6</sup> On the other side Justinian&nbsp;presents his code to Trebonianus (No. 3) ; this is inferior in execution,&nbsp;and appears to have been chiefly painted by pupils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The next room (B), called La Stanza d’Eliodoro, was painted in 1511-14;@@<sup>7</sup> it is so called from the fresco (No. 7 in fig. 3) represent-ing the expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple (2 Macc. iii.), an&nbsp;allusion to the struggles between Louis XII. of France and Julius&nbsp;IL The whole spirit of the subjects in this room is less broad and&nbsp;tolerant than in the first: no pagan ideas are admitted, and its&nbsp;chief motive is the glorification of the pontificate, with insistence&nbsp;on the temporal power. The main incident of this picture is the&nbsp;least successful part of it: the angel visitant on the horse is wanting&nbsp;in dignity, and the animal is poorly drawn, as is also the case with&nbsp;the horses of Attila’s army in the fresco opposite. The group&nbsp;of women and children on the left is, however, very beautiful., and&nbsp;the figures of Julius II. and his attendants are most nobly designed&nbsp;and painted with great vigour. The tall standing figure of Marc&nbsp;Antonio Raimondi, as one of the pope’s bearers, is a marvellous&nbsp;piece of portrait-painting, as is also the next figure who bears&nbsp;his name on a scroll—10 . </span><span class="font0">PETRO. DE . FOLIARIIS . CREMONẼN.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Behind, Giulio Rοmanο is represented as another papal attendant.&nbsp;This picture was completed in 1512. Over the window (No. 8) is&nbsp;the scene of the Miracle at Bolsena of 1264, when the real presence&nbsp;was proved to a doubting priest by the appearance of blood-stains&nbsp;on the Corporal (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Or vieto).</span><span class="font1"> Julius II. is introduced kneeling&nbsp;behind the altar; and the lower spaces on each side of the windows&nbsp;are filled with two groups, that on the left with women, that on&nbsp;the right with officers of the papal guard. The last group is one&nbsp;of the most masterly of all throughout the stanze: each face, a&nbsp;careful portrait, is a marvel of expression and power, and the&nbsp;technical skill with which the whole is painted to the utmost&nbsp;degree of finish, almost without any tempera touches, is most&nbsp;wonderful. The next fresco in date (No. 10) is that of the Repul-sion of Attila from the walls of Rome by Leo I. miraculously aided&nbsp;by the apparitions of St Peter and St Paul; it contains another&nbsp;allusion to the papal quarrels with France. It was begun in the&nbsp;lifetime of Julius II., but was only half-finished at the time of his&nbsp;death in 1513; thus it happens that the portrait of his successor,&nbsp;the Medici pope Leo X., appears twice over, first as a cardinal&nbsp;riding behind the pope, painted before the death of Julius IL, and&nbsp;again in the character of S. Leo, instead of the portrait of Julius&nbsp;which Raphael was about to paint.<sup>8</sup> Attila with his savage-looking</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> How fine these portrait-heads probably were may be guessed from Piero’s magnificent frescoes at Arezzo, in the retro-choir of&nbsp;S. Francesco.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@3</sup> It need hardly be said that the name Disputa is a misnomer; there could be no dispute among the saints and doctors of the church&nbsp;about so well-established a dogma as the real presence: the monstrance with the Host below and the figure of Christ above indicate&nbsp;His double presence both on earth and in heaven. Dr Braun,&nbsp;Springer, and Hagen have published monographs in German on&nbsp;this painting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@5</sup> He has shown great skill in the way in which he has fitted his end frescoes into the awkward spaces cut into by the windows,&nbsp;but they are none the less treated in a purely pictorial manner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@8</sup> Compare his fresco of Sixtus IV., now in the picture-gallery of the Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@7</sup> The vault of this room is painted with scenes from the Old Testament on a harsh blue ground, much restored; they are prob-ably the work of Giulio Romano, and in a decorative way are very&nbsp;unsuccessful—a striking contrast to the beautiful vaults of Perugino&nbsp;and Raphael in rooms C and A. The deep blue grounds so much&nbsp;used by Raphael’s school are very liable to injury from damp, and&nbsp;in most cases have been coarsely restored. Those in the Villa&nbsp;Madama are untouched, and in parts the damp has changed the&nbsp;ultramarine into emerald green.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@8</sup> A pen sketch in the Louvre by Raphael shows Julius II. in the place afterwards occupied by Leo X.; another difference in this&nbsp;sketch is that the pope is borne in a chair, not on horseback as in&nbsp;the fresco.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
