Theſe are uſually 30 in number, ſome provinces sending two, others more; and whatever reſolution the ſtates-general take, muſt be confirmed by every province, and by every city and republic in that province, before it has the force of a law. The deputies of each province, of what number ſoever they be, have only one voice, and are eſteemed as but one perſon, the votes being given by provinces. Each province preſides in the aſſembly in its turn, according to the order ſettled among them. Guelderland preſides first, then Holland, &amp;c.</p><p>States of Holland are the deputies of eighteen cities, and one repreſentative of the nobility, conſtituting the states of the province of Holland : the other provinces have likewiſe their states, repreſenting their ſovereignty; deputies from which make what they call the states-general. In an aſſembly oſ the states of a particular province, one diſſenting voice prevents their coming to any reſolution.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
