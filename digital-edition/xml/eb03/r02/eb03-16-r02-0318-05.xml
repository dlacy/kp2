de Hoveden, a learned man of the 13th century, was born in Yorkſhire, moſt probably at the town of that name, now called <hi rend="italic">Ho&lt;ιvden,</hi> ſome time in the reign of Henry I. After he had received the firſt parts of education in his native country, he ſtudied the civil and canon law, which were then become the moſt faſhionable and lucrative branches of learning. He became domeſtic chaplain to Henry II. who employed him to tranfa&lt;ct ſeveral eccleſiaſtical affairs ; in which he acquitted himſelf with honour. But his moſt meritorious work was, his Annals of England, from A. D. 731, when Bede’s Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory ends, to A. D. 1202. This work, which is one of the moſt voluminous of our ancient hiſtories, is more valuable for the ſincerity with which it is written, and the great variety of facts which it contains, than for the beauty of its ſtyle, or the regularity of its arrangement.</p>
