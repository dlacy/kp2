<p><span class="font4">by his Maker ; and though this doctrine, in large and permanent ſocieties, might certainly be conveyed more&nbsp;or leſs pure to late poſterity through the channel of tra-dition—we are far from attributing ſo much to tradition&nbsp;as fome writers are difpoſed to do, or thinking it the&nbsp;only fource from which mankind could derive the belief&nbsp;of their exiſtence beyond the grave. In fmall tribes of&nbsp;ſavages ſuch a tradition could hardly be preſerved ; and&nbsp;yet ſome indiſtinct notions of a future ſtate have been&nbsp;found among tribes who are ſaid to have loſt all tradi-tionary notions even of the being of a God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">others, therefore, are inclined to believe that, in-dependent of any traditions, mankind might be led by certain phenomena to form ſome conjectures of a future&nbsp;<sub>1</sub>ftate. They obſerve, that although a few individuals&nbsp;perhaps may, yet it ſeldom happens that the whole individuals of any nation are exempted from dreaming :&nbsp;They obſerve, too, and this obſervation is founded on&nbsp;experience, that the images of the dead are from the&nbsp;remaining impreſſions of memory frequently ſummoned&nbsp;up in the fancy ; and that it appears from all the lan-guages of rude nations, who pay the greateſt attention&nbsp;to their dreams, and who ſpeak of feeing the dead in&nbsp;their viſions, that theſe images ( A ) have always been&nbsp;taken by them for realities ; nay, ſome of the learned,&nbsp;and the celebrated Baxter is of the number, are diſpo-ſed to doubt whether theſe appearances be not ſome-thing more than illuſions of the brain : But whether&nbsp;they really be ſo or not, one thing is certain, that all&nbsp;nations in all countries, in the darkeſt ages and the ru-deſt periods, are accuſtomed to dream ; and whether&nbsp;ſleeping or waking, in the ſtillneſs of the night, in the&nbsp;gloom of ſolitude, in the fondneſs of friendſhip, in the&nbsp;rovings of love, the delirium of fever, and the anguiſh&nbsp;of remorfe,<sub>l</sub>to ſee and converſe with the ſhades of the&nbsp;departed; and Lucretius * has remarked,, that even the&nbsp;inferior animals are not exempted from ſuch illuſions of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">reſtleſs fancy.</span></p>
