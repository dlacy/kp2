<p><span class="font0">should be taken from the Jews; and, as the emperor still hesitated, the bigots threw on Reuchlin the whole blame of their ill success. Pfefferkorn circulated at the Frankfort fair of 1511&nbsp;a gross lihel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Handspiegel wider und gegen die Juden)</span><span class="font0"> declaring&nbsp;that Reuchlin had been bribed; and Reuchlin retorted as&nbsp;warmly in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Augenspiegel</span><span class="font0"> (1511). His adversary’s next move&nbsp;was to declare the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Augenspiegel</span><span class="font0"> a dangerous book; the Cologne&nbsp;theological faculty, with the inquisitor Jakob von Hochstraten&nbsp;(d. 1527) took up this cry, and on the 7th of Octoher 1512 they&nbsp;obtained an imperial order confiscating the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Augenspiegel.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Reuchlin was timid, but he was honesty itself. He was&nbsp;willing to receive corrections in theology, which was not his&nbsp;subject, but he could rtot unsay what he had said; and as his&nbsp;enemies tried to press him into a corner he met them with open&nbsp;defiance in a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Defensio contra Calumnialores</span><span class="font0"> (1513). The universities were now appealed to for opinions, and were all against&nbsp;Reuchlin. Even Paris (August 1514) condemned the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Augenspiegel,</span><span class="font0"> and called on Reuchlin to recant. Meantime a formal&nbsp;process had&quot; begun at Mainz before the grand inquisitor, but&nbsp;Reuchlin by an appeal succeeded in transferring the question&nbsp;to Rome. Judgment was not finally given till July 1516; and&nbsp;then, though the decision was really for Reuchlin, the trial was&nbsp;simply quashed. The result had cost ReuchIin years of trouble&nbsp;and no small part of his modest fortune, but it was worth the&nbsp;sacrifice. For far above the direct ,importance of the issue was&nbsp;the great stirring of puhlic opinion which had gone forward.&nbsp;And if the obscurantists escaped easily at Rome, with only a half&nbsp;condemnation, they received a crushing blow in Germany. No&nbsp;party could survive the ridicuIe that was poured on them in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Epistolae Obscurorum Virorum,</span><span class="font0"> the first volume of which written&nbsp;chiefly by Crotus Rubeanus appeared in 1514, and the second&nbsp;by Ulrich von Hutten in 1517. Hutten and Franz von Sickingen&nbsp;did all they could to force Reuchlin’s enemies to a restitution&nbsp;of his material damages; they even threatened a feud against&nbsp;the Dominicans of Cologne and Spires. In 1520 a commission&nbsp;met in Frankfort to investigate the case. It condemned&nbsp;Hochstraten. But the final decision of Rome did not indemnify&nbsp;him. The contest ended, however; public interest had grown&nbsp;cold, absorbed entirely hy the Lutheran question, and Reuchlin&nbsp;had no reason to fear new attacks. Reuchlin did not long&nbsp;enjoy his victory in peace. In 1519 Stuttgart was visited by&nbsp;famine, civil war and pestilence. From November of this&nbsp;year to the spring of 1521 the veteran statesman sought refuge&nbsp;in Ingolstadt and taught there for a year as professor of Greek&nbsp;and Hebrew. It was forty-one years since at Poitiers he had&nbsp;last spoken from a public chair; but the old man of sixty-five&nbsp;had not lost his gift of teaching, and hundreds of scholars&nbsp;crowded round him. This gIeam of autumn sunshine was again&nbsp;broken hy the plague; but now he was called to Tübingen and&nbsp;again spent the winter of 1521-22 teaching in his own systematic&nbsp;way. But in the spring he found it necessary to visit the baths&nbsp;of LiebenzelI, and here he was seized with jaundice, of which he&nbsp;died on the 30th of June 1522, leaving in the history of the new&nbsp;learning a name only second to that of his younger contemporary&nbsp;Erasmus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The authorities for Reuchlin’s life are enumerated in L. Geiger, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Johann Reuchlin</span><span class="font1"> (1871), which is the standard biography.

<p><span class="font1">(W. R. S.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">REUMONT, ALFRED VON </span><span class="font0">(1808-1887), German scholar and diplomatist, the son of Gerhard Rcumont (1765-1829), was born&nbsp;on the 15th of August 1808 and was named Alfred after the&nbsp;English king, Alfred the Great. Educated at the universities of&nbsp;Bonn and Heidelberg, he obtained a position in Florence through&nbsp;the influence of an Englishman, William Craufurd, but soon he&nbsp;entered the Prussian diplomatic service and was employed in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Florence, in Constantinople and in Rome. He also spent some time in the Foreign Office in Berlin. From 1851 to i860 he&nbsp;represented his country in Florence. Reumont was the friend&nbsp;and adviser of Frederick William IV. In 1879 he founded the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aachener Geschichtsverein,</span><span class="font0"> and having spent his concluding&nbsp;years at Bonn and at Aix-la-Chapelle, he died in the latter city&nbsp;on the 27th of April 1887. „</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reumont’s numerous writings deal mainly with Italy, in which country he passed many years of his life. On the history of Florence&nbsp;and of Tuscany he wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tavole Cronologiche e Sincrone della storia&nbsp;fiorentina</span><span class="font1"> (1841; Supplement, 1875); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte Toseanas seit dem&nbsp;Ende des Jlorentinischen Freistaats</span><span class="font1"> (Gotha, 1876-77); and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lorenzo&nbsp;de’ Medici</span><span class="font1"> (Leipzig, 1874, and again 1883). This last book has been&nbsp;translated into English by R. Harrison (1876). He remembered&nbsp;his connexion with Florence when he wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rornisehe Briefe von&nbsp;einem Florentiner</span><span class="font1"> (Leipzig, 1840-44), and his residence in Rome&nbsp;was also responsible for his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der Stadt Rom</span><span class="font1"> (3 vols., 1867-70).&nbsp;Turning his attention to the history of Naples, he wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Carafa&nbsp;von Maddaloni: Neapel unter spanischer Herrschaft</span><span class="font1"> (1851; Eng.&nbsp;trans., 185^), and more general works on Italian history are; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Beiträge zur italienischen Geschichte</span><span class="font1"> (6 vols., Berlin, 1853-57), and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Charakterbilder aus der neueren Geschichte Italiens</span><span class="font1"> (1886). More&nbsp;strictly biographical in their nature are: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Jugend Catcrinas de'&nbsp;Medici</span><span class="font1"> (1854), which has been translated into French by A. Baschet&nbsp;(1866) ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wie Gräfin von Albany</span><span class="font1"> (1860) and a life of his close&nbsp;friend Capponi, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gino Capponi, ein Zeit- und Lebensbild</span><span class="font1"> (Gotha, 1880).&nbsp;His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">GanganelliPapst Clemens XIV., seine Briefe und seine Zeit&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Berlin, .1847) is valuable for the relations between this pope and&nbsp;the Jesuits. Other works which may be mentioned are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zeitgenossen,&nbsp;Biografien und Charakteristiken</span><span class="font1"> (Berlin, 1862); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliografia dei&nbsp;lavori pubblicati in Germania sulla storia PItalia</span><span class="font1"> (Berlin, 1863);&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Biographische Denkblätter nach persönlichen Erinnerungen</span><span class="font1"> (Leipzig,&nbsp;1878) ; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Saggi di storia e Ietteratura</span><span class="font1"> (Florence, 1880). Reumonrs&nbsp;other important work, one which he was peculiarly fitted to write,&nbsp;was his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aus Friedrich Wilhelms IV. gesunden und kranken Tagen&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Leipzig, 1885).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RÉUNION, known also by its former name Bourbon, an island and French colony in the Indian Ocean, 400 m. S.E. of&nbsp;Tamatave, Madagascar, and 130 S.W. of Port Louis, Mauritius.&nbsp;It is elliptic in form; its greatest length is 45 m. and its greatest&nbsp;breadth 32 m., and it has an area of 965 sq. m. It lies between&nbsp;20° 51' and 2i° 22' S. and 55° 15' and 55° 54' E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The coast-line (about 130 m.) is little indented, there are no naturaI harbours and no small islets round the shore. The&nbsp;narrow coast-lands are succeeded by hilly ground which in&nbsp;turn gives place to mountain masses and tahleland, which&nbsp;occupy the greater part of the island. The main axis runs&nbsp;N.W. and S.E., and divides the island into a windward (E.)&nbsp;district and a leeward (W.) district, the dividing line being&nbsp;practically that of the watershed. The form of the mountains&nbsp;is the result of double volcanic action. First there arose from&nbsp;the sea a mountain whose summit is approximately represented&nbsp;hy Piton des Neiges (10,069 ft-)&gt; a denuded crater of immense&nbsp;proportions, and at a later date another crater opened towards&nbsp;the E., which, piling up the mountain mass of Le Volcan, turned&nbsp;what was till then a circle into an ellipse. The oldest erupted&nbsp;rocks belong to the type of the andesites; the newest are&nbsp;varieties of hasalt. The two massifs are united by high tablelands. In the older massif the most striking features are now&nbsp;three areas of subsidence—the cirques of Salazie, Rivière des&nbsp;Galets and Cilaos—which lie N.W. and S. of the Piton des&nbsp;Neiges. The first, which may be taken as typical, is surrounded&nbsp;by high almost perpendicular walls of hasaltic lava, and its&nbsp;surface is rendered irregular hy hills and hillocks of debris fallen&nbsp;from the heights. Towards the S. lies the vast stratum of&nbsp;rocks (150 to 200 ft. deep) which, on the 26th of Novembcr&nbsp;1875, suddenly sweeping down from the Piton des Neiges and&nbsp;the Gros Morne (a “ shoulder ” of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">piton),</span><span class="font0"> buried the little&nbsp;village of Grand SaLle and nearly </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">hundred of its inhabitants.&nbsp;Besides the Piton des Neiges and the Gros Morne the chief&nbsp;heights in this part of the island are the pyramidical Cimandef&nbsp;(7300 ft.), another shoulder of the piton, and the Grand Bernard&nbsp;(9490 ft.), separating the cirques of Mafate and Cilaos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The second massif, Le Volcan, is cut off from the rest of the island by two <sup>44</sup> enclosures,” each about 500 or 600 ft. deep.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
