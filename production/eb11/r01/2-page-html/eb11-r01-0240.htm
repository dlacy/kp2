<p><span class="font1">vibrations in plane polarized light are rectilinear and in the plane of the wave, and arguing from the symmetry of uniaxal&nbsp;crystals that vibrations perpendicular to the axis áre propagated&nbsp; with the same speed in all directions, he pointed out that&nbsp;this would explain the existence of an ordinary wave, and the&nbsp;relation between its speed and that of the extraordinary wave.&nbsp;From these ideas Fresnel was forced to the conclusion, that he&nbsp;at once verified experimentally, that in biaxal crystals there is&nbsp;no spherical wave, since there is no single direction round which&nbsp;such crystals are symmetrical; and, recognizing the difficulty of&nbsp;a direct determination of the wave-surface, he attempted to&nbsp;represent the laws of double refraction by the aid of a simpler&nbsp;surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The essential problem is the determination of the propagational speeds of plane waves as dependent upon the directions of their normals. These being known, the deduction of the&nbsp;wave-surface follows at once, since it is to be regarded as the&nbsp;envelope at any subsequent time of all the plane waves that at&nbsp;a given instant may be supposed to pass through a given point,&nbsp;the ray corresponding to any tangent plane or the direction of&nbsp;transport of energy being by Huygens’ principle the radius-vector from the centre to the point of contact. Now Fresnel&nbsp;perceived that in uniaxal crystals the speeds of plane waves in&nbsp;any direction are by Huygens’ law the reciprocals of the semi-axes of the central section, parallel to the wave-fronts, of a&nbsp;spheroid, whose polar and equatorial axes are the reciprocals&nbsp;of the equatorial and polar axes of the spheroidal sheet of&nbsp;Huygens’ wave-surface, and that the plane of polarization of a&nbsp;wave is perpendicular to the axis that determines its speed.&nbsp;Hence it occurred to him that similar relations with respect to&nbsp;an ellipsoid with three unequal axes would give the speeds and&nbsp;polarizations of the waves in a biaxal crystal, and the results&nbsp;thus deduced he found to be in accordance with all known facts.&nbsp;This ellipsoid is called the ellipsoid of polarization, the index&nbsp;ellipsoid and the indicatrix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We may go a step further; for by considering the intersection of a wave-front with two waves, whose normals are indefinitely&nbsp;near that of the first and lie in planes perpendicular and parallel&nbsp;respectively to its plane of polarization, it is easy to show that&nbsp;the ray corresponding to the wave is parallel to the line in which&nbsp;the former of the two planes intersects the tangent plane to the&nbsp;ellipsoid at the end of the semi-diameter that determines the&nbsp;wave-velocity; and it follows by similar triangles that the&nbsp;ray-velocity is the reciprocal of the length of the perpendicular&nbsp;from the centre on this tangent plane. The laws of double&nbsp;refraction are thus contained in the following proposition. The&nbsp;propagational speed of a plane wave in any direction is given&nbsp;by the reciprocal of one of the semi-axes of the central section&nbsp;of the ellipsoid of polarization parallel to the wave; the plane&nbsp;of polarization of the wave is perpendicular to this axis; the&nbsp;corresponding ray is parallel to the line of intersection of the&nbsp;tangent plane at the end of the axis and the plane containing&nbsp;the axis and the wave-normal; the ray-velocity is the reciprocal&nbsp;of the length of the perpendicular from the centre on the tangent&nbsp;plane. By reciprocating with respect to a sphere of unit radius&nbsp;concentric with the ellipsoid, we obtain a similar proposition in&nbsp;which the ray takes the place of the wave-normal, the ray-velocity that of the wave-slowness (the reciprocal of the velocity)&nbsp;and vice versa. The wave-surface is thus the apsidal surface of&nbsp;the reciprocal ellipsoid; this gives the simplest means of obtaining its equation, and it is readily seen that its section by each&nbsp;plane of optical symmetry consists of an ellipse and a circle,&nbsp;and that in the plane of greatest and least wave-velocity these&nbsp;curves intersect in four points. The radii-vectors to these&nbsp;points are called the ray-axes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the wave-front is parallel to either system of circular sections of the ellipsoid of polarization, the problem of finding&nbsp;the axes of the parallel central section becomes indeterminate,&nbsp;and all waves in this direction are propagated with the same&nbsp;speed, whatever may be their polarization. The normals to&nbsp;the circular sections are thus the optic axes. To determine the&nbsp;rays corresponding to an optic axis, we may note that the ray&nbsp;and the perpendiculars to it through the centre, in planes&nbsp;perpendicular and parallel to that of the ray and the optic axis,&nbsp;are three lines intersecting at right angles of which the two&nbsp;latter are confined to given planes, viz. the central circular&nbsp;section of the ellipsoid and the normal section of the cylinder&nbsp;touching the ellipsoid along this section: whence by a known&nbsp;proposition the ray describes a cone whose sections parallel to&nbsp;the given planes are circles. Thus a plane perpendicular to the&nbsp;optic axis touches the wave-surface along a circle. Similarly&nbsp;the normals to the circular sections of the reciprocal ellipsoid, or&nbsp;the axes of the tangent cylinders to the polarization-ellipsoid&nbsp;that have circular normal sections, are directions of single-ray&nbsp;velocity or ray-axes, and it may be shown as above that corresponding&nbsp; to a ray-axis there is a cone of wave-normals with&nbsp;circular sections parallel to the normal section of the corresponding&nbsp; tangent cylinder, and its plane of contact with the&nbsp;ellipsoid. Hence the extremities of the ray-axes are conical&nbsp;points on the wave-surface. These peculiarities of the wave-surface are the cause of the celebrated conical refractions&nbsp;discovered by Sir William Rowan Hamilton and H. Lloyd,&nbsp;which afford a decisive proof of the general correctness of&nbsp;Fresnel’s wave-surface, though they cannot, as Sir G. Gabriel&nbsp;Stokes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Math. and Phys. Papers,</span><span class="font1"> iv. 184) has pointed out, be&nbsp;employed to decide between theories that lead to this surface&nbsp;as a near approximation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In general, both the direction and the magnitude of the axes of the polarization-ellipsoid depend upon the frequency of the&nbsp;light and upon the temperature, but in many cases the possible&nbsp;variations are limited by considerations of symmetry. Thus&nbsp;the optic axis of a uniaxal crystal is invariable, being determined&nbsp; by the principal axis of the system to which it belongs:&nbsp;most crystals are of the same sign for all colours, the refractive&nbsp;indices and their difference both increasing with the frequency,&nbsp;but </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">few crystals are of opposite sign for the extreme spectral&nbsp;colours, becoming isotropic for some intermediate wave-length.&nbsp;In crystals of the rhombic system the axes of the ellipsoid&nbsp;coincide in all cases with the crystallographic axes, but in a few&nbsp;cases their order of magnitude changes so that the plane of the&nbsp;optic axes for red light is at right angles to that for blue light,&nbsp;the crystal being uniaxal for an intermediate colour. In the&nbsp;case of the monoclinic system one axis is in the direction of the&nbsp;axis of the system, and this is generally, though there are notable&nbsp;exceptions, either the* greatest, the least, or the intermediate&nbsp;axis of the ellipsoid for all colours and temperatures. In the&nbsp;latter case the optic axes are in the plane of symmetry, and a&nbsp;variation of their acute bisectrix occasions the phenomenon&nbsp;known as “ inclined dispersion ”: in the two former cases the&nbsp; plane of the optic axes is perpendicular to the plane of symmetry,&nbsp;and if it vary with the colour of the light, the crystals exhibit&nbsp;“ crossed ” or “ horizontal dispersion ” according as it is the&nbsp;acute or the obtuse bisectrix that is in the fixed direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The optical constants of a crystal may be determined either with a prism or by observations of total reflection. In the&nbsp;latter case the phenomenon is characterized by two angles—the&nbsp;critical angle and the angle between the plane of incidence and&nbsp;the line limiting the region of total reflection in the field of view.&nbsp;With any crystalline surface there are four cases in which this&nbsp;latter angle is 90°, and the principal refractive indices of the&nbsp;crystal are obtained from those calculated from the corresponding critical angles, by excluding that one of the mean values&nbsp;for which the plane of polarization of the limiting rays is&nbsp;perpendicular to the plane of incidence. A difficulty, however,&nbsp;may arise when the crystalline surface is very nearly the plane&nbsp;of the optic axes, as the plane of polarization in the second mean&nbsp;case is then also very nearly perpendicular to the plane of&nbsp;incidence; but since the two mean refractive indices will be very&nbsp;different, the ambiguity can be removed by making, as may&nbsp;easily be done, an approximate measure of the angle between the&nbsp;optic axes and comparing it with the values calculated by using&nbsp;in turn each of these indices (C. M. Viola, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Zeit. fur Kryst.,</span><span class="font1"> 1902,&nbsp;36, p. 245).</span></p>
