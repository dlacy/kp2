<p><span class="font1">In various ways records are apt to wander from their proper custody and to lose their legal character. But in spite of this loss&nbsp;the historian is bound to pursue them either into the hands of&nbsp;private collectors or on to the shelves of some museum. No attempt&nbsp;can be made to discuss private collections or the manuscripts of&nbsp;foreign libraries. Even among English libraries it must be sufficient&nbsp;to mention the British Museum as the principal destination of&nbsp;wandering records. Of the collections in that library the most&nbsp;important to the student of records are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cottonian,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harleian&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lansdowne,</span><span class="font1"> all catalogued by the Record Commission;&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Additional,</span><span class="font1"> catalogued from time to time as fresh matter&nbsp;accrues; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Egerton,</span><span class="font1"> catalogued with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Additional;</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Slοane&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stowe,</span><span class="font1"> both catalogued.

<p><span class="font2">RECORDE, ROBERT (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font2">. 1510-1558), Welsh physician and mathematician, was descended from a respectable family of Tenby&nbsp;in Wales. He entered the university of Oxford about 1525,&nbsp;and was elected fellow of All Souls’ College in 1531. Having&nbsp;adopted medicine as a profession, he went to Cambridge, where&nbsp;he took the degree of M.D. in 1545. He afterwards returned to&nbsp;Oxford, where he publicly taught mathematics, as he had done&nbsp;prior to his going to Cambridge. It appears that he afterwards&nbsp;went to London, and acted as physician to Edward VI. and to&nbsp;Queen Mary, to whom some of his books are dedicated. He died in the King’s Bench prison, Southwark, where he was confined for debt, in 1558.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Recorde published several works upon mathematical subjects, chiefly in the form of dialogue between master and scholar, viz.:—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Grounde of Artes, teachinge the Worke and Practise of Arithmeticke, both in whole numbers and fractions</span><span class="font1"> (1540); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Pathway&nbsp;to Knowledge, containing the First Principles of Geometry . . .&nbsp;bothe for the use of Instrumentes Geometricall and Astronomicall,&nbsp;and also for Projection of Plattes</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1551) ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Castle of Knowledge, containing the Explication of the Sphere both Celestiali and&nbsp;Materiall, &amp;c.</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1556); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Whetstone of Witte, which is&nbsp;the second part of Arithmetike, containing the Extraction of Rootes,&nbsp;the Cοssike Practice, with the Rides of Equation, and the Woorkes&nbsp;of Surde Numbers</span><span class="font1"> (London, 1557). This was the first English book&nbsp;on algebra. He wrote also a medical work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Urinal of Physic&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1548), frequently reprinted. Sherburne states that Recorde also&nbsp;published </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cosmographiae isagoge,</span><span class="font1"> and that he wrote a book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;Arie faciendi Horologium</span><span class="font1"> and another </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Usu Globorum et de&nbsp;Statu temporum.</span><span class="font1"> Recorde's chief contributions to the progress&nbsp;of algebra were in the way of systematizing its notation (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Algebra,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RECORDER, in its original sense, one who sets down or records. Hence applied to a person with legal knowledge&nbsp;who was appointed by the mayor and aldermen to “ record ’’&nbsp;or keep in mind the proceedings of their court, as well as the&nbsp;customs of the city. The word is now chiefly used of the&nbsp;principal legal officer of a city or borough having a separate&nbsp;court of quarter sessions. He must be a barrister of five&nbsp;years’ standing, appointed by the crown and holding office&nbsp;during good behaviour, and receiving “ such yearly salary,&nbsp;not exceeding that stated in the petition on which the grant of&nbsp;a separate court of quarter sessions was made,’’ as the sovereign&nbsp;directs (Municipal Corporations Act 1882, s. 163). The recorder holds, once in every quarter of a year, or oftener, if he&nbsp;thinks fit, a court of quarter sessions in and for the borough.&nbsp;He is sole judge of the court, “ having cognizance of all crimes,&nbsp;offences, and matters cognizable by courts of quarter sessions&nbsp;for counties in England,’’ except that he may not allow or&nbsp;levy any borough rate, or grant licences (s. 165). He is not&nbsp;eligible to serve in parliament for the borough, or to be an&nbsp;alderman or councillor, or stipendiary magistrate for the&nbsp;borough, though he may he revising barrister and is eligible to&nbsp;serve in Parliament except for the borough. He may be&nbsp;appointed recorder for two or more boroughs conjointly. He&nbsp;may, in case of sickness or unavoidable absence, appoint in&nbsp;writing a barrister of five years’ standing to act as deputy&nbsp;recorder for him. A recorder is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ex officio</span><span class="font2"> a justice for the&nbsp;borough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The recorder of London is judge of the lord mayor’s court, and one of the commissioners of the central criminal court.&nbsp;His salary is £4000 a year. He is appointed by the lord mayor&nbsp;and aldermen, but by the Local Government Act 1888, s. 42,&nbsp;sub-s. 14, after the vacancy next after the beginning of&nbsp;the act, no recorder may exercise any judicial function unless&nbsp;he is appointed by the sovereign to exercise such function.&nbsp;See Quarter Sessions, Court of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RECORDER, Fipple Flute or English Flute (Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">flûte-a-bec, flute douce, flute anglaise</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">flûte à neuf trous,</span><span class="font2"> Ger. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Block-</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Plockflöte, Schnabelflöte, Langflöte;</span><span class="font2"> Ital. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">flauto dolce,&nbsp;flauto diritto),</span><span class="font2"> a medieval flute, blown by means of a whistle&nbsp;mouthpiece and held vertically in front of the performer like a&nbsp;clarinet. The recorder only survives in the now almost obsolete&nbsp;flageolet and in the so-called penny-whistle. The recorder&nbsp;consisted of a wooden tube, which was at first cylindrical or&nbsp;nearly so, but became, as the instrument developed and im-proved, an inverted cone. The whistle mouthpiece has been&nbsp;traced in almost prehistoric times in Egypt and other Oriental&nbsp;countries. The principle of the whistle mouthpiece is based on&nbsp;that of the simplest flutes without embouchure, like the Egyptian&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nay,</span><span class="font2"> with this modification, that, in order to facilitate the&nbsp;production of sound, the air current, instead of being directed&nbsp;through ambient air to the sharp edge of the tube (or the lateral&nbsp;embouchure in the modern flute), is blown through a chink&nbsp;directly into a narrow channel. This channel is so constructed&nbsp;within the mouthpiece that the stream of air impinges with&nbsp;force against the sharp edge of a lip or fipple cut into the pipe&nbsp;below the channel. This throws the air current into the state&nbsp;of vibration required in order to generate sound-waves in the&nbsp;main column of air within the tube. The inverted cone of the&nbsp;bore has the effect of softening the tone of the recorder still&nbsp;further, earning for it the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">flûte douce.</span><span class="font2"> Being so easy&nbsp;to play, the recorder always enjoyed great popularity in all&nbsp;countries until the greater possibilities of the transverse flute&nbsp;turned the tide against it. The want of character which dis-tinguishes the timbre of the whistle-flute is due to the paucity&nbsp;of harmonic overtones in the clang. The recorder had seven&nbsp;holes in front and one at the back for the thumb. As long as&nbsp;the tube was made in one piece the lowest hole stopped by the&nbsp;little finger was generally made in duplicate to serve equally&nbsp;well for right- and left-handed players, the unused hole being&nbsp;stopped with wax. Being an open pipe, the recorder could&nbsp;overblow the octave and even the two following harmonics&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> the twelfth and second octave). The holes produced the&nbsp;diatonic scale, and by means of harmonics and cross-fingering&nbsp;the second and part of a third octave were obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The recorder is described and figured by Sebastian Virdung, Martin Agricola and Ottmar Luscinius in the 16th century, and&nbsp;by Michael Praetorius and Marin Mersenne in the 17th century.&nbsp;Praetorius mentions eight different sizes ranging from the small&nbsp;flute two octaves above the cornetto to the great bass. The lowest&nbsp;notes of the large flutes were provided with keys enclosed in per-forated wooden or brass cases, which served to protect the mechanism, as yet somewhat primitive; the keys usually had double&nbsp;touch pieces to suit right- or left-handed players.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are at least two fine sets of recorders extant : one is preserved in the Germanisches Museum at Nuremberg, consisting of eight flutes in a case and dating from the 17th century; the other&nbsp;is the Chester set of four 18th-century instruments, which are fully-described and illustrated in a paper by Joseph C. Bridge.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The recorder has been immortalized by Shakespeare in the famous scene in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hamlet</span><span class="font1"> (II. 3), which has been treated from the&nbsp;musical point of view in an excellent and carefully written article&nbsp;by Christopher Welch, the author of an equally valuable paper,&nbsp;“ The Literature of the Recorder.” @@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
