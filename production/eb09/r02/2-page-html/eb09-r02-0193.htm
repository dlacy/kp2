<p><span class="font1">under Nonconformity (j.v.) as to the legal position of nonconformity may be applied to the Roman Catholic&nbsp;faith. The effect of 2 and 3 Will. IV. c. 115 is to place&nbsp;Roman Catholic schools, places of worship and education,&nbsp;and charities, and the property held therewith, under the&nbsp;laws applying to Protestant nonconformists. The Toleration Act does not apply to Roman Catholics, but legislation of a similar kind, especially the Relief Act of 1791&nbsp;(31 Geo. III. c. 32), exempts the priest from parochial&nbsp;offices, such as those of churchwarden and constable, and&nbsp;from serving in the militia or on a jury, and enables all&nbsp;Roman Catholics scrupling the oaths of office to exercise&nbsp;the office of churchwarden and some other offices by deputy. The priest is, unlike the nonconformist minister,&nbsp;regarded as being in holy orders. He cannot, therefore,&nbsp;sit in the House of Commons, but there is nothing to prevent a peer who is a priest from sitting and voting in the&nbsp;House of Lords. If a priest becomes a convert to the&nbsp;Church of England he need not be re-ordained. The&nbsp;remaining law affecting Roman Catholics may be classed&nbsp;under the following five heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Office.</span><span class="font0"> There are certain offices still closed to Roman Catholics. By the Act of Settlement a Papist or the husband or wife of a&nbsp;Papist cannot be king or queen. The Act of 1829 provides that&nbsp;nothing therein contained is to enable a Roman Catholic to hold&nbsp;the office of guardian and justice of the United Kingdom, or of&nbsp;regent of the United Kingdom ; of lord chancellor, lord keeper,&nbsp;or lord commissioner of the great seal of Great Britain or Ireland&nbsp;or lord lieutenant of Ireland ; of high commissioner to the General&nbsp;Assembly of the Church of Scotland, or of any office in the Church&nbsp;of England or Scotland, the ecclesiastical courts, cathedral foundations, and certain colleges. The disability in the case of the lord&nbsp;chancellor of Ireland was removed by statute in 1867, with necessary limitations as to ecclesiastical patronage, and the office has&nbsp;been held twice since that date by the late Lord O’Hagan. The&nbsp;Act of 1829 preserved the liability of Roman Catholics to take certain oaths of office, but these have been modified by later legislation (see 29 and 30 Viet. c. 19 ; 30 and 31 Viet. c. 75 ; 31 and 32&nbsp;Viet. c. 72). Legislation has been in the direction of omitting&nbsp;words which might be supposed to give offence to Roman Catholics.&nbsp;(2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Title.</span><span class="font0"> The Act of 1829 forbids the assumption by any person,&nbsp;other than the person authorized by law, of the name, style, or title&nbsp;of an archbishop, bishop, or dean of the Church of England. The&nbsp;Ecclesiastical Titles Act, 1851, went further and forbade the assumption by an unauthorized person of a title from any place in&nbsp;the United Kingdom, whether or not such place were the seat of&nbsp;an archbishopric, bishopric, or deanery. This Act was, however,&nbsp;repealed in 1867, but the provisions of the Act of 1829 are still in&nbsp;force. (3) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Religious Orders.</span><span class="font0"> It was enacted by the Act of 1829 that&nbsp;“ every Jesuit and every member of any other religious order, community, or society of the Church of Rome bound by monastic or&nbsp;religious vows” was, within six months after the commencement&nbsp;of the Act, to deliver to the clerk of the peace of the county in&nbsp;which he should reside a notice or statement in the form given&nbsp;to the schedule to the Act, and that every Jesuit or member&nbsp;of such religious order coming into the realm after the commencement of the Act should be guilty of a misdemeanour and should be&nbsp;banished from the United Kingdom for life (with an exception in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">favour of natural-born subjects duly registered). A secretary of state, being a Protestant, was empowered to grant licences to&nbsp;Jesuits, &amp;c., to come into the United Kingdom and remain there&nbsp;for a period not exceeding six months. An account of these&nbsp;licences was to be laid annually before parliament. The admission&nbsp;of any person as a regular ecclesiastic by any such Jesuit, &amp;c., was&nbsp;made a misdemeanour, and the person so admitted was to be banished for life. Nothing in the Act was to extend to religious orders&nbsp;of females. These provisions exist </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in posse</span><span class="font0"> only, and have, it is&nbsp;believed, never been put into force. (4) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Superstitwus Uses.</span><span class="font0"> Gifts to&nbsp;superstitious uses are void both at common law and by statute. It&nbsp;is not easy to determine what gifts are to be regarded as gifts to&nbsp;superstitious uses. Like contracts contrary to public policy, they&nbsp;depend to a great extent for their illegality upon the discretion of&nbsp;the court in the particular case. The Act of 23 Hen. VIII. c. 10&nbsp;makes void any assurance of lands to the use (to have obits perpetual) or the continual service of a priest for ever or for threescore or&nbsp;fourscore years. The Act of 1 Edw. VI. c. 14 (specially directed to&nbsp;the suppression of chantries) vests in the crown all money paid by&nbsp;corporations and all lands appointed to the finding or maintenance&nbsp;of any priest or any anniversary or obit or other like thing, or of&nbsp;any light or lamp in any church or chapel maintained within five&nbsp;years before 1547. The Act may still be of value in the construction of old grants, and in affording examples of what the legislature&nbsp;regarded as superstitious uses. Gifts which the courts have held&nbsp;void on the analogy of those mentioned in the Acts of Henry VIII.&nbsp;and Edward VI. are a devise for the good of the soul of the testator,&nbsp;a bequest to certain Roman Catholic priests that the testator may&nbsp;have the benefit of their prayers and masses, a bequest in trust to&nbsp;apply a fund to circulate a book teaching the supremacy of the&nbsp;pope in matters of faith, a bequest to maintain a taper for evermore&nbsp;before the image of Our Lady. The court may compel discovery of&nbsp;a secret trust for superstitious uses. Since 2 and 3 Will. IV. c.&nbsp;115 gifts for the propagation of the Roman Catholic faith are not&nbsp;void as made to superstitious uses. It should be noticed that the&nbsp;doctrine of superstitious uses is not confined to the Roman Catholic&nbsp;religion, though the question has generally arisen in the case of&nbsp;gifts made by persons of that religion. The Roman Catholic&nbsp;Charities Act, 1860, enables the court to separate a lawful charitable trust from any part of the estate subject to any trust or&nbsp;provision deemed to be superstitious. It also provides that in the&nbsp;absence of any written document the usage of twenty years is to be&nbsp;conclusive evidence of the application of charitable trusts. (5)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Patronage.</span><span class="font0"> A Roman Catholic cannot present to a benefice, prebend, or other ecclesiastical living, or collate or nominate to any free&nbsp;school, hospital, or donative (3 Jac. I. c. 5). Such patronage is by&nbsp;the Act vested in the universities, Oxford taking the city of London&nbsp;and twenty-five counties in England and Wales, mostly south of&nbsp;the Trent, Cambridge the remaining twenty-seven. The principle&nbsp;is affirmed in subsequent Acts (1 Will, and Mary, sess. 1, c. 26 ; 12&nbsp;Anne, st. 2, c. 14 ; 11 Geo. II. c. 17). If the right of presentation&nbsp;to an ecclesiastical benefice belongs to any office under the crown,&nbsp;and that office is held by a Roman Catholic, the archbishop of&nbsp;Canterbury exercises the right for the time being (10 Geo. IV. c.&nbsp;7, s. 17). No Roman Catholic may advise the crown as to the&nbsp;exercise of its ecclesiastical patronage (⅛., s. 18). A Roman Catholic,&nbsp;if a member of a lay corporation, cannot vote in any ecclesiastical&nbsp;appointment </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{ib.,</span><span class="font0"> s. 15). Grants and devises of advowsons, &amp;c., by&nbsp;Roman Catholics are void, unless for valuable consideration to a&nbsp;Protestant purchaser (11 Geo. II. c. 17, s. 5). Where a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quare impedit&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is pending before any court, the court may compel the patron to&nbsp;take an oath that there is no secret trust for the benefit of a Roman&nbsp;Catholic. See Quare Impedit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. W+.)</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><h1><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">ROMANCE</span></h1>

There are, however,&nbsp;certain ill-defined limitations in the analysis of fiction&nbsp;which enable us to assign distinct places to the legend,&nbsp;the ballad, the epic, the fable, the tale, the romance, and&nbsp;the novel. As usual in all attempts at precise classification, we find that the lines of demarcation cannot be&nbsp;drawn with rigid exactness, and that many works may be&nbsp;referred to more than one division. But the general conception of romance is the one which will here be followed,&nbsp;and which roughly divides the subject into (i.) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Romances&nbsp;of Chivalry—</span><span class="font1">chiefly their prose forms—and (ii.) the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Romances of Love and Adventure,</span><span class="font1"> which follow them.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> In the 9th century the Romana or Romance language made its first appearance in writing. For many centuries, however, it was&nbsp;only used to embody the tales and ballads of each country in which&nbsp;one or other form of the speech was vernacular, so that the word&nbsp;“romance” became finally appropriated to the compositions which&nbsp;were the stajde literature of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lingua Rornαnα</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romance,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">Romance, as a distinct branch of the literature of fiction, belongs essentially to the Middle Ages and to Europe.&nbsp;The romance of chivalry, as it is called, prevailed during&nbsp;the four centuries of knighthood, and there can be little&nbsp;doubt that the institutions of chivalry were considerably&nbsp;influenced by the works of the early romancers. The&nbsp;establishment of the orders of St John and the Temple&nbsp;was based upon an exalted conception of duty and devotion, which the hard test of experience soon modified,&nbsp;and which would have perished utterly but for the em</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
