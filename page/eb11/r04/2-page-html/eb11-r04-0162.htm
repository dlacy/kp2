<p><span class="font0">Suffice it to say that they were now lords of the whole of lower Latium, from Capo Circeo to Ninfa, from Ceprano to Subiaco.&nbsp;Thus Sciarra Colonna and a Frenchman named Nogaret were&nbsp;able to fall on the pope at Anagni, insult him, and take him&nbsp;prisoner. The people rising to his rescue, the conspirators&nbsp;were put to flight. But when Boniface returned to Rome&nbsp;with the escort and protection of the Orsini, who had made&nbsp;themselves masters of the city, he found that he was virtually&nbsp;a captive in their hands. He felt this so keenly that he died&nbsp;of rage and exhaustion on the nth of October 1303. The brief&nbsp;pontificate of his successor Benedict XI. was followed by that&nbsp;of Clement V. (1305-14), a Frenchman, who, instead of coming&nbsp;to Rome, summoned the cardinals to France. This was the&nbsp;beginning of the church’s so called exile in Avignon, which,&nbsp;although depriving Rome of a scource of wealth and influence,&nbsp;left the republic to pursue its own course. It employed this&nbsp;freedom in trying to hold its own against the nobles,&nbsp;whose power was much lessened by the absence of&nbsp;the pope, and endeavoured to gain fresh strength&nbsp;by organizing the thirteen regions, which, as we&nbsp;have shown, were associations of a much firmer&nbsp;nature in Rome than the gilds. Accordingly, in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1305, a captain of the people was elected with thirteen elders and a senator, Paganino della Torre, who governed for one&nbsp;year. The pope was opposed to these changes at first, but&nbsp;in 1310 he issued a brief granting Rome full permission&nbsp;to select its own form of government. Thus, the first pope&nbsp;in Avignon restored the rights of the Romans. But the&nbsp;latter, even with church and empire so far removed, still&nbsp;considered Rome the Eternal City, the source of all law, and&nbsp;the only natural seat of the spiritual and temporal government&nbsp;of the world. To their republic, they thought, appertained&nbsp;a new and lofty destiny, nor could it ever be content to descend&nbsp;to the level of other Italian municipalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 6th of January 1309 Henry VII. was crowned king of the Romans at Aix-la-Chapelle; and so greatly were men’s&nbsp;minds changed in Italy that, throughout the land, he&nbsp;was hailed as a deliverer. He wished to restore the&nbsp;grandeur of the empire, and the Italians, above all</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dante Alighieri, beheld in him the champion of the state against the church, who, after becoming the foe of communal liberty,&nbsp;had forsaken Italy and withdrawn to France. The Roman&nbsp;people shared these ideas, and awaited Henry with equal&nbsp;impatience, but the nobles rose in opposition. The Orsini,&nbsp;leaders of the Guelphs, and allied with Robert of Naples, took&nbsp;possession of the castle of St Angelo and the Trastevere.&nbsp;Hence, when Henry reached Rome in May 1312, after seizing&nbsp;the iron crown at Milan, he was obliged to act on the offensive.&nbsp;He took the Capitol by assault, but, failing in his attack on the&nbsp;castle of St Angelo, was pursued by its Neapolitan garrison.&nbsp;Forsaken by many discouraged adherents, he was forced to&nbsp;recognize the expediency of departure. First, however, he&nbsp;desired to be crowned at the Lateran, St Peter’s being held&nbsp;by his foes. The cardinals refused his request, but were compelled to yield by the threats of the people, who, reasserting&nbsp;their ancient rights, insisted that the coronation should take&nbsp;place without delay. And the ceremony was performed on&nbsp;the 29th of June 1312. The emperor then resolved to depart&nbsp;in spite of the popular protest against his leaving the natural&nbsp;seat of the empire, and on -the 20th of August started for&nbsp;Tuscany, where worse fortune awaited him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Their differences settled, the nobles expelled the captain of the people left by Henry, and elected as senators Sciarra&nbsp;Colonna and Francesco Orsini. But this was the&nbsp;signal for a popular revolt.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Capitol was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">attacked, the senators put to flight, and Jacopo Arlotti elected captain with a council of twenty-six&nbsp;worthies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(buoni homing.</span><span class="font0"> The new leader instantly&nbsp;summoned the chief nobles before his tribunal, had them&nbsp;chained and cast into prison, and demolished many of their&nbsp;houses and strongholds. But, having thus humiliated their&nbsp;pride, Arlotti dared not put them to death, and, releasing them&nbsp;from confinement, banished them to their estates, where they&nbsp;plunged into hostile preparations. Meanwhile the victorious&nbsp;people convoked a parliament and decreed that, the aristocracy&nbsp;being now overthrown, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tribunitia potestas</span><span class="font0"> alone should&nbsp;invite the emperor to make his triumphal entry into the Capitol,&nbsp;and receive his authority from the people of Rome. This&nbsp;conception of the Roman power will now be seen to become&nbsp;more and more definite until finding its last expression in&nbsp;Cola di Rienzi. Pope Clement, resigning himself to necessity,&nbsp;acknowledged the new government under the energetic rule&nbsp;of Arlotti. The latter now joined the Ghibellines of the&nbsp;Campagna against the Orsini and the Neapolitans, subdued&nbsp;Velletri, and gave it a podestà. But then the Gaetani, who&nbsp;were Guelphs, united with the Orsini and the Neapolitans,&nbsp;and, giving battle to the Ghibellines in the Campagna, routed&nbsp;them in such wise as to put an end to the popular government.&nbsp;The nobles forced their way into the city, attacked the Capitol,&nbsp;made Arlotti their prisoner, and re-elected the senators Sciarra&nbsp;Colonna and Francesco Orsini. Close upon these reverses came&nbsp;the death of Henry VII. (24th of August 1313) at Buonconvento&nbsp;near Siena, which put an end to the Ghibelline party in Italy.&nbsp;Thereupon King Robert of Naples, being named senator by&nbsp;the pope, immediately appointed a vicar in Rome. Clement&nbsp;likewise profited by the vacancy of the imperial throne to name&nbsp;the king imperial vicar in Tuscany. And he died on the 20th of&nbsp;April 1314, well content to have witnessed the triumphs of&nbsp;the Guelphs in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Affairs took a fresh turn under Pope John XXII. (1316-34). Rome was still ruled by the vicars of King Robert; but,&nbsp;owing to the continued absence of the popes, matters grew&nbsp;daily worse. Trade and industry declined, revenue diminished,&nbsp;the impoverished nobles were exceedingly turbulent, deeds&nbsp;of murder and violence occurred on all sides; even by day&nbsp;the streets of the city were unsafe. Hence there was universal&nbsp;discontent. Meanwhile Louis the Bavarian, who in 1314 had&nbsp;been crowned king of the Romans, having overcome his German&nbsp;enemies at Miihldorf in 1322, turned against the pope, one&nbsp;of his fiercest opponents. Louis was surrounded by Minorite&nbsp;friars, supporters of the poverty of the church, and consequently&nbsp;enemies to the temporal power. They were men of the stamp&nbsp;of William of Occam, Marsilio of Padua, Giovanni Janduno,&nbsp;and other philosophers favourable to the rights of the empire&nbsp;and the people. Accordingly the Italian Ghibellines hailed&nbsp;Louis as they had previously hailed Henry. Even the Roman&nbsp;people were roused to action, and, driving out the representatives and partisans of King Robert, in the spring of 1327,&nbsp;seized on the castle of St Angelo, and again established a&nbsp;democratic government. <sup>a</sup> Nearly all Italy was stirred to&nbsp;new deeds,” says G. Villani, “and the Romans rose to arms&nbsp;and organized the people ” (bk. x. c, 20). Regardless of the&nbsp;reproofs of the pope, they elected a haughty Ghibelline,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sciarra Colonna, captain of the people and general of the militia, with a council of fifty-two </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">popolani)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">four to each region. Then, ranged under the standards&nbsp;of the militia, the Romans gave chase to the foes of&nbsp;the republic, and Sciarra, returning victorious, ascended to&nbsp;the Capitol and invited Louis the Bavarian to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The summons was obeyed; on the 7th of January 1328 the king was «already encamped in the Neronian&nbsp;Fields with five thousand horse and a considerable number&nbsp;of foot soldiers, and, with better fortune than Henry VII.,&nbsp;was able to enter the Vatican at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Encircled by a crowd of heretics, reformers and Minorite brethren, he convoked a parliament on the Capitol, asking&nbsp;that the imperial crown might be conferred upon him by the&nbsp;people, from whon^ alone he wished to receive it. And the&nbsp;people proclaimed him their captain, senator and emperor.&nbsp;On the 17th of January his coronation took place in St Peter’s.&nbsp;But, as he had neither money nor practical sense, his method&nbsp;of taxation and the excesses committed by himself and his&nbsp;over-excited philosophers speedily aroused the popular discontent. His ecclesiastical vicar, Marsilio of Padua, and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
