<p><span class="font0">“ We must, however, notwithstanding her authority, enter our protest against fettering the realm of shadows by the opinions entertained of it in the world of realities. If&nbsp;we are to try ghosts by the ordinary rules of humanity, we&nbsp;bar them of their privileges entirely. For instance, why&nbsp;admit the existence of an aerial phantom, and deny it the&nbsp;terrible attribute of magnifying its stature ? why admit an&nbsp;enchanted helmet, and not a gigantic one ? why allow as&nbsp;an impressive incident the fall of a suit of armour, thrown&nbsp;down, we must suppose, by no mortal hand, and at the same&nbsp;time deny the same supernatural influence the power of&nbsp;producing the illusion (for it is only represented as such)&nbsp;upon Manfred, which gives seeming motion and life to the&nbsp;portrait of his ancestor ? It may be said, and it seems to be&nbsp;Miss Reeve’s argument, that there is a verge of probability,&nbsp;which even the most violent figment must not transgress ;&nbsp;but we reply by the cross question, that if we are once to&nbsp;subject our preternatural agents to the limits of human&nbsp;reason, where are we to stop? We might, under such a&nbsp;rule, demand of ghosts an account of the very circuitous&nbsp;manner in which they are pleased to open their communications with the living world. We might, for example,&nbsp;move a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quo warranto</span><span class="font0"> against the spectre of the murdered&nbsp;Lord Lovel, for lurking about the eastern apartment, when&nbsp;it might have been reasonably expected, that if he did not&nbsp;at once impeach his murderers to the next magistrate, he&nbsp;might at least have put Fitzowen into the secret, and thus&nbsp;obtained the succession of his son more easily than by the&nbsp;dubious and circuitous route of a single combat. If there&nbsp;should be an appeal against this imputation, founded on the&nbsp;universal practice of ghosts, in such circumstances, who always act with singular obliquity in disclosing the guilt of&nbsp;which they complain, the matter becomes a question of&nbsp;precedent ; in which view of the case, we may vindicate&nbsp;Horace Walpole for the gigantic exaggeration of his phantom, by the similar expansion of the terrific vision of Fa-doun, in Blind Harry’s Life of Wallace ; and we could,&nbsp;were we so disposed, have paralleled his moving picture, by&nbsp;the example of one with which we ourselves had some acquaintance, which was said both to move and to utter&nbsp;groans, to the great alarm of a family of the highest respectability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Where, then, may the reader ask, is the line to be drawn ? or what are the limits to be placed to the reader’s&nbsp;credulity, when those of common sense and ordinary nature are once extended ? The question admits only one answer, namely, that the author himself, being in fact the magician, shall evoke no spirits whom he is not capable of endowing with manners and language corresponding to their&nbsp;supernatural character. Thus Shakspeare, drawing such&nbsp;characters as Caliban and Ariel, gave them reality, not by&nbsp;appealing to actual opinions, which his audience might entertain respecting the possibility or impossibility of their&nbsp;existence, but by investing them with such attributes as all&nbsp;readers and spectators recognised as those which must have&nbsp;corresponded to such extraordinary beings, had their existence been possible. If he had pleased to put into language the ‘ squeaking and gibbering* of those disembodied&nbsp;phantoms which haunted the streets of Rome, no doubt his&nbsp;wonderful imagination could have filled up the sketch&nbsp;which, marked by these two emphatic and singularly felicitous expressions, he has left as characteristic of the language of the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ In this point of view, our authoress has, with equal judgment and accuracy, confined her flight within those&nbsp;limits on which her pinions could support her; and though&nbsp;we are disposed to contest her general principle, we are&nbsp;willing to admit it as a wise and prudent one, so far as applied to regulate her own composition. In no part of The&nbsp;Old English Baron, or of any other of her works, does Miss&nbsp;Reeve show the possession of a rich or powerful imagination. Her dialogue is sensible, easy, and agreeable, </span><span class="font1">but&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">neither marked by high flights of fancy nor strong bursts of&nbsp;passion. Her apparition is an ordinary fiction, of which&nbsp;popular superstition used to furnish a thousand instances,&nbsp;when nights were long, and a family, assembled round a&nbsp;Christmas log, had little better to do than to listen to such&nbsp;tales. Miss Reeve has been very felicitously cautious in&nbsp;showing us no more of Lord Lovel’s ghost than she needs&nbsp;must ; he is a silent apparition, palpable to the sight only,&nbsp;and never brought forward into such broad daylight as&nbsp;might have dissolved our reverence. And so far, we repeat,&nbsp;the authoress has used her own power to the utmost advantage, and gained her point by not attempting a step beyond it. But we cannot allow that the rule which, in her&nbsp;own case, has been well and wisely adopted, ought to circumscribe a bolder and more imaginative writer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ In what may be called the costume, or keeping, of the chivalrous period in which tile scene of both is laid, the&nbsp;language and style of Horace Walpole, together with his&nbsp;intimate acquaintance with the manners of the middle ages,&nbsp;form an incalculable difference betwixt The Castle of Otranto and The Old English Baron. Clara Reeve, probably,&nbsp;was better acquainted with Plutarch and Rapin than with&nbsp;Froissart or Olivier de la Marche. This is no imputation&nbsp;on the taste of that ingenious lady. In her days, Macbeth&nbsp;was performed in a general’s full uniform, and Lord Hastings was dressed like a modern high chamberlain going to&nbsp;court. Or, if she looked to romances for her authority,&nbsp;those of the French school were found introducing, under&nbsp;the reign of Cyrus or of Faramond, or in the early republic&nbsp;at Rome, the sentiments and manners of the court of Louis&nbsp;XIV. In the present day more attention to costume is&nbsp;demanded, and authors, as well as players, are obliged to&nbsp;make attempts, however fantastic or grotesque, to imitate&nbsp;the manners on the one hand, and the dress on the other,&nbsp;of the times in which the scene is laid. Formerly, nothing&nbsp;of this kind was either required or expected ; and it is not&nbsp;improbable that the manner in which Walpole circumscribes&nbsp;his dialogue (in most instances) within the stiff and stem&nbsp;precincts prescribed by a strict attention to the manners and&nbsp;language of the times, is the first instance of such restrictions. In The Old English Baron, on the contrary, all parties speak and act much in the fashion of the seventeenth&nbsp;century ; employ the same phrases of courtesy ; and adopt&nbsp;the same tone of conversation. Baron Fitzowen<sub>1</sub> and the&nbsp;principal characters, talk after the fashion of country squires&nbsp;of that period, and the lower personages like gaffers and&nbsp;gammers of the same era. And ‘ were but the combat in&nbsp;the lists left out,’ or converted into a modem duel, the&nbsp;whole train of incidents might, for any peculiarity to be&nbsp;traced in the dialect or narration, have taken place in the&nbsp;time of Charles II., or in either of the two succeeding reigns.&nbsp;As it is, the story reads as if it had been transcribed into&nbsp;the language, and remodelled according to the ideas, of this&nbsp;latter period. Yet we are uncertain whether, upon the&nbsp;whole, this does not rather add to than dimmish the interest of the work ; at least it gives an interest of a different&nbsp;kind, which, if it cannot compete with that which arises out&nbsp;of a highly exalted and poetical imagination, and a strict&nbsp;attention to the character and manners of the middle ages,&nbsp;has yet this advantage, that it reaches its point more surely&nbsp;than had a higher, more difficult, and more ambitious line&nbsp;of composition been attemptcd.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ He that would please the modern world, yet present the exact impression of a tale of the middle ages, will repeatedly find that he will be obliged, in despite of his utmost exertions, to sacrifice the last to the first object, and&nbsp;eternally expose himself to the just censure of the rigid antiquary, because he must, to interest the readers of the&nbsp;present time, invest his characters with language and sentiments unknown to the period assigned to his story ; and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
