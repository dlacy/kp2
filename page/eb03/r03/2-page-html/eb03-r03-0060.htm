<p><span class="font0">ROUNDELAY, or Roundo, a fort of ancient poer∩, derived its name, according to Menage, from&nbsp;its form, and becauſe it ſtill turns back again to the ſirll&nbsp;verſe, and thus goes round. The common roundelay&nbsp;conſiſts ol 13 verſes, eight of which are in one rhyme&nbsp;and five in another. It is divided into couplets ; at the&nbsp;end of the ſecond and third of which the beginning of&nbsp;the roundelay is repeated ; and that, if poſſible, in an&nbsp;equivocal or punning ſenſe. The roundelay is a popular poem in Fiance, but is little known among us. Ma-rot and Voiture have ſucceeded the beſt in it. Rapin&nbsp;remarks, that if the roundelay be not very exquiſite, it&nbsp;is intolerably bad In all the ancient ones, Menage ob-ſerves, that the verſe preceding has a leſs complete ſenſe,&nbsp;and yet joins agreeably with that oſ the cloſe, without depending neceſſarily thereon, f his rule, well ob-ſerved, makes the roundelay more ingenious, and is one&nbsp;of the ſineſſts of the poem. Some of the ancient wri&nbsp;ters ſpeak of the roundelay or roundel as a kind of air&nbsp;appropriated to dancing ; and in this ſenſe the term&nbsp;ſeems to indicate little more than dancing in a circle&nbsp;with the hands joined</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ROUND-House, a kind of p ifon for the nightly watch in London to ſecure diſorderly perſons till they&nbsp;can be carried before a magiftrate</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">RoVND-PLuſe,</span><span class="font0"> in a ſhip, the uppermoſt room or cabin on the ſterii of a ſhip, where the mailer lies</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUNDS, in military matters, a detachment from the main-guard, of an officer or a non-commiſſioned&nbsp;officer and fix men, who go round the rampart oſ a&nbsp;garriſon, to liſten if any thing be ſtirring without the&nbsp;place, and to ſee that the centinels be diligent upon&nbsp;their duty, and^all in order. In ſtrict garriſons the&nbsp;rounds go every half-hour. The centinels are to challenge at a diſtance, and to reſt their arms as the round&nbsp;paffes. All guards turn out, challenge, exchange the&nbsp;parole, and reſt their arms, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rounds are ordinary and extraordinary. The ordinary rounds are three ; the town-major’s round, the grand-round, and the viſiting-round.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manner oſ going the Rounds.</span><span class="font0"> When the town-major goes his round, he comes to the main guard, and demands a ſerjeant and four or ſix men to eſcort&nbsp;him to the next guard ; and when it is dark, one of&nbsp;the men is to carry a light.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As ſoon as the ſentry at the guard perceives the round comi⅞g, he ſhall give notice to the guard, that&nbsp;they may be ready to turn out when order ed ; and&nbsp;when the round is advanced within about 20 or 30 paces of the guard, he is to challenge briſkly ; and when&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">he </span><span class="font0">is anſwered by the ſerjeant wſho attends the round,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Town major's round,</span><span class="font0"> he is to ſay, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stand round!</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;reſt his arms ; after which he is to call out immediately, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Serjeant turn out the guard, towη-maj∙ Ls round.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Upon the ſentry calling, the ſerjeant is to turn out the&nbsp;guard immediately, drawing up the men in good or&nbsp;der with ſhouldered arms, the officer placing himſelf&nbsp;at the head of it, with his arms in his hand. He&nbsp;then orders the ſerjeant and four or ſix men to advance&nbsp;toward the round, and challenge : the ſerjeant of the&nbsp;round is to anſwer, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Town-major's round ;</span><span class="font0"> upon which&nbsp;the ſerjeant of the guard replies, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">AHvan<sub>l</sub> ∣, Je&gt;jeant,&nbsp;with the parole !</span><span class="font0"> at the ſame time ordering his men to&nbsp;. reſt their arms. The ſerjeant of the round advances&nbsp;•alone, and gives the ſerjeant of the guard the parole in his car, that nene elſe may hear it ; during&nbsp;which period the ſerjeant of the guard holds the ſpear&nbsp;of his halbert at the other’s breaſt. The ſerjeant of the&nbsp;round then returns to his poll, wſhilſt the ſerjeant of&nbsp;the guard leaving his men to keep the round from advancing, gives the parole to his officer. This being&nbsp;found right, the officer orders his ſerjeant to return to&nbsp;his men ; ſays, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Advance, town-major's round!</span><span class="font0"> and orders the gμard to reſt their arms ; upon which the ſerjeant of the guard orders his men to wheel back from&nbsp;the centre, and form a lane, through which the town-major is to paſs (the eſcort remaining where they&nbsp;were), and go up to the officer and give him the parole,&nbsp;laying his mouth to his ear. The officer holds the&nbsp;ſpear of his efponton at the town major’s breaſt while&nbsp;he gives him the parole.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The deſign of rounds is not only to vifιt the guards, and keep the centinels alert ; but likewiſe to diſcover&nbsp;what pa(Γes in the outworks, and beyond them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUSSILLON, a province of France, in the Pyrenees, bounded on the eaſt by the Mediterranean ſea, on the weft by Cerdagne, on the north by Lower&nbsp;Languedoc, and on the ſouth by Catalonia, from which&nbsp;it is ſeparated by the Pyrenees.

<p><span class="font0">ROUSSEAU (James), an eminent painter, was born at Paris in the year 1630, and ſtudied firſt under Swa-nevelt. who had married one of his relations ; after which&nbsp;he improved himſelf by travelling into Italy, practiſing&nbsp;ſolely in perfective, architecture, and landſcape. On&nbsp;his return home, he was employed at Marly. He dx-ſtingu’ſhed himſelf very much in painting buildings, and&nbsp;by his knowledge of, and attention to, the principles&nbsp;of perlpective. Louis XIV. employed him to decorate&nbsp;his hall of devices at St Germaine-en-Laſe, where he&nbsp;repreſented the operas of Lulli. But being a Proteſ-tant, he quitted France on the perſecution of his brethren, and retired to Swifferland. Louis invited him&nbsp;back ; he refuſed, but ſent his deſigns, and recommended a proper perſon to execute them. After a&nbsp;ſſiort ſtay in Swfifferland, he went to Holland ; whence&nbsp;he was invited over to England by Ralph duke of Montague, to adorn his new houſe in Bloomſhury, where&nbsp;he painted much. Some oſ his pictures, both in landſcape and architecture, are over doors at Hampton-court ; and he etched ſome of his own deſigns. His&nbsp;perſpectives having been moſt commonly applied to decorate courts or gardens, have ſuffered much from the&nbsp;weather. Such oſ them as remain are monuments of&nbsp;an excellent genius The colours are durable and&nbsp;bright, and the choice of them moſt judicious. He&nbsp;died in Soho-ſquare, about the year 1693, aged 63.</span></p>
