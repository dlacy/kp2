eaſineſs is perceived over the whole abdomen ; and this pain is always rendered worſe by coughing, sneezing, or any violent exertion. The patient complains of nauſea ; frequent retching ; can get no diſcharge by ſtool ; becomes hot and reſtleſs ; and the pulſe is commonly found quick and hard. When the ſwelling is formed entirely by a portion of gut, if no feces be contained in it, it has a ſmooth, equal surface ; and is eaſily compreſſible, but inſtantly returns to its former ſize on the pressure being removed : but, in gut-ruptures of long ſtanding, where hard faeces have collected in the protruded bowels, considerable inequalities are detected. When again the tumor is compoſed both of gut and omentum, its appearance is always unequal, it feels ſoft and ſomewhat like dough, and of courſe is not ſo elaſtic as when part of the inteſtinal tube only is down ; for although, like the other, it is compreſſible, it does not ſo readily regain its former dimenſions on the preſſure being taken off.</p><p>It will be readily ſupposed, that the ſymptoms we have deſcribed never can happen from the preſence of omentum <hi rend="italic">only :</hi> For although ſtricture produced on a portion of omentum, even when no part of the inteſtinal tube is down, does now and then occaſion a good deal of diſtreſs, ſuch as pain in the part, ſickneſs, vomiting, and twitching pains through the whole belly ; yet no obſtruction of the gut ever occurs from this, and of courſe none of the ſymptoms ever prove ſo alarming as when any part of gut is affected. If theſe ſymptoms we have deſcribed as being pro duced by a ſtrangulated gut, are not now obviated by a removal of the ſtricture which produced them, the nauſea and retching terminate in frequent vomitings, firſt of a bilious, and afterwards of a more fetid matter ; the belly becomes tense ; the pain turns more violent ; a diſtreſſing convulſive hickup comes on ; the fever, which before was not apparently of much conſequence, now becomes very formidable ; and a total want of rest, with a very diſagreeable ſtate of anxiety, continues through the whole courſe of the complaint. — Theſe ſymptoms having gone on with violence for ſome time, the patient is at laſt commonly relieved in a ſudden from all manner of pain ; and then he flatters himſelf that all danger is over. But inſtead of that, the pulſe, from having been hard and frequent, becomes languid and interrupted ; cold ſweat breaks out over the whole body, but eſpecially on the extremities ; the eyes acquire a kind of languor ; the tenſeneſs of the abdomen ſubſides, and the ſwelling of the part affected diſappears ; the teguments covering the parts, which before were either of a natural appearance, or had ſomewhat of a reddiſh inflamed caſt, now acquire a livid hue, and a windy crepitous feel is diſtinguiſhable all over the courſe of the ſwelling. If the protruded parts have not of themſelves gone entirely up, their return is now in general eaſily effected by a ſmall degree of preſſure, and the patient then diſcharges freely by ſtool ; but the cold ſweats increaſing, the hickup turns more violent, and death itſelf is at laſt uſhered in by its uſual forerunners, ſubultus tendinum, and other convulsive twitchings.</p><p>Theſe are the ordinary ſymptoms of what is termed a <hi rend="italic">ſtrangulated</hi> or <hi rend="italic">incarcerated gut-hernia :</hi> that is, when the parts protruded become ſo affected by ſtricture as to produce pain ; and do not either return to their natural ſituations on the patient’s getting into a horizontal poſture, or cannot even be immediately replaced by the hands of a practitioner.</p><p>In whatever ſituation a ſtrangulated hernia occurs, the only rational method of cure, it is evident, muſt conſiſt in the removal of that ſtricture which prevents the return of the protruded parts. It is that ſtricture which ought to be conſidered as the cauſe of all the miſchief ; and unleſs it be removed, nothing effectual can be done for the relief of the patient.</p><p>Various methods have been attempted by practitioners for the removal of ſtricture in theſe diſorders ; all of which may be comprehended under two general heads.</p><p>I. Such as effect a reduction of the protruded parts, without the interposition of inciſion or any chirurgical operation properly ſo called ; and,</p><p>II. A diviſion of the parts producing the ſtricture, ſo as to admit of a replacement of the deranged viscera, conſtituting what is termed the <hi rend="italic">operation for the hernia.</hi></p><p>The remedies to be employed for accompliſhing the firſt of theſe are, a proper poſture of the patient, with the manual aſſiſtance of a practitioner ; blood-letting, ſtimulating clyſters, opiates, the warm bath, and proper applications to the tumor itſelf. If theſe fail, there is then no other means of cure left but the operation of dividing the integuments, and replacing the viſcera.</p><p>As soon as the aſſiſtance of a practitioner is desired for the removal of ſymptoms in caſes of hernia, the firſt circumſtance requiring his attention is the placing of his patient in such a poſture as will moſt probably favour the return of the protruded parts. Placing the patient’s feet over the ſhoulders of another perſon, while his body is allowed to hang downwards, and cauſing him to be a good deal jolted about, has on ſome occaſions anſwered when other means have failed.</p><p>The ſurgeon ſhould at the same time endeavour to aſſiſt the return of the bowels, by means of gentle preſſure with his hands and fingers. In the inguinal or ſcrotal hernia, this preſſure ſhould be made obliquely upwards and outwards to correspond with the opening in the external oblique muſcle; in the femoral hernia it ought to be made directly upwards ; in the Umbilical and ventral hernia directly backwards.—— The ſwelling ſhould be graſped with one hand at the bottom, while with the fingers of the other hand an attempt is made to puſh gently the contents of the tumor into their place, always obſerving that the parts laſt protruded be firſt reduced. This operation is by authors termed the <hi rend="italic">taxis.</hi></p><p>When the means now mentioned have failed, no remedy affords more relief than blood-letting. The quantity to be drawn ought chiefly to be determined by the ſtrength of the patient. There is ſcarcely any diseaſe, however, where ſuch large quantities of blood can with propriety be taken from weak people. Blooding till the patient is in a ſtate of deliquium animi, is frequently known to produce a more effectual relaxation of the muſcles than can be done by any other means. On that account it is ſometimes adviſed in caſes of hernia, and the practice is now and then attended with advantage.</p><p>As an obſtinate coſtiveneſs is commonly one of the most alarming ſymptoms of hernia, it has been a common practice to exhibit a variety of ſtimulating purgatives both by the mouth and anus ; but they are very ſeldom of much ſervice, and in that case almoſt universally do injury, by increasing not only the ſickneſs at ſtomach, but the tension and pain of the tumor. When they are to be employed, they ought to be thrown up by the anus. For this purpoſe aloes and other ſtimulating ſubſtances, but particularly tobacco- ſmoke, are employed ; and although this laſt remedy, which is to be thrown in by double bellows, &amp;c. does not always act as a purgative, it may be uſefully employed as an anodyne. Where an evacuation by ſtool is wanted, it may in general be readily procured by the injection of warm water, in which a little Caſtile ſoap is dissolved, in the proportion of a drachm or a drachm and a half of the latter to a pound of the former. Warm bathing is another remedy greatly extolled, either by general immersion of local application.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0158.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0152"/>
by means of warm water put into ox-bladders covered with flannel, and lard acroſs the abdomen.</p><p>To diminiſh the ſize of the tumor, remedies of an oppoſite quality from theſe have been uſed ; and though by ſome this practice has been conſidered as hazardous, yet by others, particularly by the late Dr Monro and Mr Benjamin Bell, more advantage has been found from cooling applications than from thoſe of a different nature. Snow, ice, or cloths dipped in a recent ſolution of ſal ammoniac in water and vinegar, or cold ſaturnine applications, or cold water and vinegar, have been employed with advantage. If, notwithſtanding theſe remedies, the diſeaſe becomes worſe, and no probability remains of ſucceſs, the diviſion of the parts producing the ſtricture can alone ſave the life of the patient.</p><p>To determine the exact time at which to proceed to an operation, has been conſidered as one of the niceſt points in ſurgery. In general, when every attempt has failed, and no repetition of the former remedies is likely to ſucceed, the ſurgeon ought certainly to proceed to the operation. A few hours, even when aſſiſtance has been early applied, is perhaps all the time which ought ever to be confirmed in trials of this nature. But however necessary this operation may be when a patient’s life is in danger, as it is always attended with ſome degree of hazard, it ought never to be practiſed where ſymptoms of ſtrangulation do not exiſt.</p><p>In that kind of hernia called <hi rend="italic">chronic,</hi> the circulation of the part forming the hernia, as well as the periſtaltic motion of ſuch parts of the alimentary canal as have been protruded, go freely and regularly on. There are many instances of large herniæ falling down even to the bottom of the ſcrotum, and continuing there for many years, without producing any interruption to the uſual diſcharge by ſtool. All that can be done here is, to prevent any accumulation of feces in the inteſtine, by preſcribing a proper diet, and the occaſional uſe of gentle laxatives ; and obviating any inconvenience which might ariſe from the weight of the tumor, by the application of a proper truſs or ſuſpenſary bandage ; to warn them of the riſk to which they are conſtantly liable, and to caution them againſt violent exerciſe, particularly leaping, and every sudden exertion. The truſs ought to be fitted exactly to the part for which it is intended, for without the utmoſt nicety in this reſpect, it muſt always do more harm than good : for the ſole purpoſe of a bandage, in caſes of hernia, is to prevent effectually the falling down of ſuch parts as have been newly replaced. If therefore the pad or bolſter of the bandage does not bear properly againſt the opening upon which it is placed, a portion of gut may slip out, and be materially injured by the pressure of the pad. Fig. 74. repreſents a truſs for an inguinal or femoral hernia of one side, fig. 75. a truſs for the same diſeaſe in both ſides, and fig. 76. a truſs for an umbilical hernia.</p><p>We ſhall now proceed to deſcribe the circumſtances to be attended to in performing the operation for hernia in general. A table of convenient ſize and height being placed in a proper light, the patient muſt be ſo laid on it as to relax the diſeaſed parts as much as poſſible, and then ſecured by proper aſſiſtance. To lessen the contents of the abdomen as much as poſſible, the bladder ought to be emptied previous to the operation. An inciſion is to be made with a common round-edged ſcalpel through the ſkin and part of the cellular ſubſtance, long enough to allow the ſtricture to be fully expoſed. The rest of the cellular ſubſtance is then to be divided with the greateſt attention. That part of the muſcle forming the ſtricture or ring muſt next be laid diſtinctly in view. A ſmall portion of the protruding ſac muſt alſo be expoſed ; after which the directory (fig. 73.) is to be paſſed between the ring and the ſac. A ſtraight probe-pointed ſcalpel is now to be introduced into the groove of the directory, and by it the ring is to be dilated till the point of the finger can be introduced. The finger is here conſidered as the ſafeſt director ; for it being insinuated into the aperture in the tendon immediately above the protruded parts, the point of the knife is eaſily introduced upon it ; and by keeping the end of the finger always a little before the knife, the opening may be enlarged to any neceſſary extent without riſk of wounding any of the contiguous parts.</p><p>By the eaſe with which the finger is introduced, the operator will be enabled to judge when the ring is sufficiently dilated ; and if the ſtrangulation was entirely in the ring, it will now be evident that every obſtacle to the reduction muſt be removed, and of conſequence that the prolapſed parts maybe returned with little difficulty. If the patient be young, or if the diſeaſe has continued a conſiderable time, ſuch a degree of inflammation frequently entues in the neck of the ſac as to produce thickening and ſtraitness ; ſo that, after the ſac and its contents have been entirely freed from the ſtricture of the ring, the inteſtines cannot be reduced. We judge this to be the case when, after the ſtricture of the ring has been removed, the parts prolapſed do not expand into their natural ſize, and farther, when they make reſiſtance when we attempt to return them. In this caſe, the neck of the ſac muſt be opened with the utmoſt caution, to avoid wounding the parts within it.</p><p>If the herniary ſac, under the ſtraitened place of its neck, be thin and tranſparent, and there is little or no reaſon to ſuſpect an adheſion of the bowels to the ſac, the beſt method, as Dr Monro, in his publication on the Bursae Mucosae, obſerves, will be to make a ſmall hole in the ſac below the ſtricture, and then to introduce a ſmall furrowed probe, and to cut cautiouſly upon it. But if the ſac be thick and dark coloured, and there is likewiſe a ſuſpicion that the bowels may adhere to it, the eaſieſt and ſafeſt manner will be to make the hole in the peritoneum above the ſtricture ; then to introduce a common probe, bent near its point into a ſemicircle, with its point directed downwards through the ſtricture into the ſac ; and upon the point of it to make, with great caution, another ſmall hole ; after which we may either cut upon the probe, or introduce a furrowed probe, and divide the neck of the ſac.</p><p>After this, the bowels are to be returned by pressure upon the ſac, without opening it farther ; and the ſides of the wound in the ſkin are to be brought together, and kept ſo by means of slips of adheſive plaſter, though ſtitches made at the diſtance of a finger-breadth from each other will exclude the air, and prevent the return of the bowels more effectually. Over theſe are to be laid ſeveral folds of charpee, and the whole is to be ſecured by a bandage adapted to the nature of the part.</p><p>The patient, upon being carried to bed, ſhould be ſo placed as to have the part upon which the operation was performed higher than the reſt of his body, or at leaſt as high as the ſituation of the part operated upon will allow, in order to prevent a return of the diſeaſe. After the operation, opiates are particularly uſeful, and ought to be repeated as circumſtances may require. It is likewiſe necessary that the patient be kept cool. In plethoric habits, blood lotting is proper, together with a rigid attention to low diet. A frequent uſe of clyſters and gentle laxatives, to keep the belly moderately open, ought not to be neglected. When the conſtitution has been previously much reduced, inſtead of blood letting and a low diet, a nouriſhing regimen is neceſſary. The dreſſings ought not to be removed till the third or fourth day after the operation, when the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0159.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0153"/>
sides of the wound will be found almoſt adhering together ; and if attention be paid to the ſubſequent treatment, the sore will be generally healed in two or three weeks. As ſoon as the wound is firmly cicatrized, a truſs ought to be properly fitted to the part, and ſhould never, on any future period of life, be laid aſide.</p><p>When the hernia is of long standing, and when there is reaſon to think adhesions have taken place between the ſac and bowels, or that mortification has already begun, or that ſome filaments run acroſs the ſac and prevent the reduction, or that there is water in the ſac, or that the gut is in danger of being entangled from a part of the omentum being down, a different method of operating becomes necessary.</p><p>The patient is to be placed as already directed. The operator is to graſp the tumor with the one hand, ſo as to make the ſkin tenſe on the fore part of it, while with the ſcalpel in the other he divides the ſkin from one end of the tumor to the other. The cellular ſubſtance is by gentle strokes to be divided, till not only the ring, but the whole length of the ſac, is laid bare. An opening is now, in the moſt cautious manner, to be made into the ſac by slight ſcratches, to avoid hurting any of its contents.</p><p>In making this perforation, which is conſidered as the niceſt part of the operation, conſiderable aſſiſtance is obtained from the uſe of the ſmall directory, upon the point of which the fibres of the ſac are to be ſucceſſively raised and divided till an opening is made. The opening is to be enlarged till it admit the fore-finger of the left hand, which ſerves as a directory for conducting the ſtraight probe- pointed ſcalpel with which the ſac is to be divided through its whole length.</p><p>The ſac being laid fully open, the parts contained in it ought to be examined with the niceſt attention, to diſcover whether they are all ſound or not ; and if, upon an attentive inspection, it is found that they are not evidently in a gangrenous ſtate, even although they ſeem conſiderably inflamed, they ſhould be immediately returned into the abdomen. When adhesions take place between different parts of the protruded gut, the greateſt caution is necessary in ſeparating them. When one part of a gut adheres ſo firmly to another as not to be ſeparated but with difficulty, it is much better to return the whole, even in that ſtate, into the abdomen, than to run the riſk of hurting the inteſtine materially by uſing much force. When adhesions occur between the hernial sac and the gut, or between the gut and omentum, if the filaments producing the connection cannot be otherwiſe removed, as there is no great hazard in wounding the omentum, and ſtill leſs in hurting the ſac, a very ſmall portion of theſe may be dissected, and returned with the gut into the abdomen. When the bowels cannot be reduced with eaſe, the ring is to be dilated by the blunt-pointed ſcalpel in the manner already directed. After returning the contents of the ſac into the cavity of the abdomen, it has been propoſed by ſome authors to paſs a ligature round the neck of the ſac, with a view of procuring a reunion of its ſides, ſo as to prevent a future deſcent of the bowels ; and various other methods, even actual and potential cauteries, have been propoſed : but as none of them yet attempted have been found ſufficiently to anſwer the purpoſe, the only thing that can be recommended is a well made truſs.</p><p>When the bowels are actually in a ſtate of gangrene, as the returning of ſuch mortified parts might be attended with the very worſt conſequences, a great degree of caution is necessary. When the omentum is found in a mortified ſtate, as the exciſion of a portion of this ſubſtance is not attended with much riſk, it is the common practice to cut away the diſeaſed parts, and to obviate any inconvenience which might enſue from the hemorrhagy. We are adviſed to make a ligature on the sound parts previous to the removal of thoſe which are mortified ; whilſt the ends of the ligature being left hanging out of the wound, the ſurgeon has it in his power to remove them when circumſtances appear to render it proper. Theſe ligatures on the omentum, however, are frequently productive of bad conſequences. No hemorrhagy of any importance ever occurs from a diviſion of this membrane, even in a ſound unmortified ſtate ; ſuch parts as have become gangrenous may therefore be freely cut off, and the remaining ſound parts be afterwards, without the intervention of ligatures, ſafely introduced into the abdomen. If a veſſel of any ſize in the omentum has been divided, a ligature may be passed above the veſſel itſelf, and the ends left hanging out of the wound ; the threads may be afterwards pulled away at pleaſure. When a rupture has been of long duration, it ſometimes happens, that from the pressure made by the truſs, and other circumſtances, portions of the omentum are collected together into hard lumps. If theſe be ſmall, they may be returned into the abdomen without producing any inconvenience ; but if from their bulk and hardneſs they are likely to do miſchief, they ought to be cut off. When part of the omentum is to be removed, it ought to be previouſly expanded and divided with ſcissars, which will be more convenient than any other instrument. When again a ſmall portion of gut is found mortified, we are to endeavour, by means of a needle-ligature, to connect the ſound part of the gut immediately above the mortified ſpot to the wound in the abdomen already made. By this means, when the mortified part ſeparates, or perhaps what is better, when it has been immediately cut out, the fæces are diſcharged by the wound ; and there are different inſtances where, after ſuch a diſcharge has continued for ſome time, the wound has entirely healed.</p><p>But when the mortified portion of gut is of conſiderable extent, and includes the whole circumference of the inteſtine, all that can be done is to remove it, and to draw, by means of a ligature, the upper end of the gut towards the under, and afterwards connect them to the inner edges of the wound. This at leaſt affords a chance of the ends of the gut being brought to reunite ; and if unfortunately that event ſhould not take place, a paſſage of the faeces will still be ſecured. All ſuch mortified parts as are to be removed ought to be cut off, and the remaining ſound intestine retained, before the opening in the ring can be dilated with ſafety, leſt the gangrenous portion slip in together with the ſound. The parts forming a hernia being all completely replaced, when the ſac in which they were contained is found thick, hard, and much enlarged, as in ſuch a ſtate no good ſuppuration can take place, and as its preſervation cannot be in any degree uſeful, ſuch parts of it as can be cut away with propriety ought to be removed. All the lateral and fore parts of the ſac may be cut off with ſafety ; but as it is commonly firmly connected with the ſpermatic vessels behind, this part of it ought not to be touched.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Bubonocele, or Inguinal and Scrotal Hernia.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> ſpecies of hernia is formed by a protruſion of ſome of the abdominal bowels through the rings of the external oblique muſcles. It is known by the general ſymptoms of hernia already enumerated, and by a ſoft and ſomewhat elaſtic ſwelling, beginning in the groin, and deſcending by degrees into the ſcrotum in men, and into the labia pudendi in women. When the hernia contains omentum only, the ſwelling is both more ſoft, compreſſible, and more unequal than when the gut alone is down ; the ſcrotum becomes more oblong than in the inteſtinal hernia ; and when the quantity of omentum is large, it is alſo much more weighty than a gut rupture of the ſame ſize ; but frequently the tu-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0160.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0154"/>
mor is compoſed of both gut and omentum, and then the diſtinguiſhing ſymptoms of each can never be ſo clearly marked.</p><p>Bubonocele may be confounded with certain other diſeaſes ; but may be diſtinguiſhed by the following marks which are preſent in theſe disorders, while the ſymptoms of hernia are abſent : From venereal bubo, by the preſence of that incompreſſible hardneſs with which all ſuch ſwellings are at first attended, and by the fluidity of matter which in the suppurative ſtate is always obſervable ; From hernia humeralis, or ſwelling of the teſtes, by the abſence of the hardened and enlarged ſtate of the teſtis and epidydimus, and likewiſe of the pain, the tumor of the teſticle being remarkably heavy in proportion to the bulk, the ſpermatic proceſs being commonly free from the ſwelling. In the hernia humeralis also the inteſtines are unobſtructed, and the general ſymptoms of hernia are wanting. From the hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis teſtis, by the tumor generally feeling more ſmooth to the touch than in hernia, by the ſwelling here beginning in the under part of the ſcrotum and aſcending, by the ſpermatic cord being always free and diſtinct, and by a fluctuation being evident. From hydrocele of the ſpermatic cord, ſometimes with much difficulty, and therefore it requires here particular attention. In every case of tumor in the teſtes, where the moſt perfect certainty is not obtained, and when it is neceſſary to have recourſe to an operation, the ſurgeon ought to proceed as in a case of real hernia.</p><p>The treatment of bubonocele is the same with that already adviſed in the treatment of hernia in general, only making allowance for the ſituation of the diſeaſe. In attempting the reduction by means of the hand, the preſſure ſhould be obliquely upwards and outwards, correſponding with the ring of the abdominal muſcle. In performing the operation, the patient ſhould be laid on a table, with his head and body almoſt horizontal, whilſt at the same time his buttocks are ſomewhat elevated by pillows placed beneath them. The legs hanging over the edge of the table ought to be ſeparated, ſo as to admit the operator between them ; and ſhould in that ſituation be firmly ſecured by an aſſiſtant on each side, who ſhould take care to keep the thighs so far raiſed as to relax all the abdominal muſcles. The parts being previouſly ſhaved, an inciſion muſt be made with a common round-edged ſcalpel through the ſkin and part of the cellular ſubſtance, beginning at leaſt an inch above the ſuperior end of the tumor, and continuing it down to between two and three inches below the ring.</p><p>Although in by much the greateſt proportion of hernial ſwellings the ſpermatic vessels lie behind the protruded parts, yet on ſome occaſions they have been found on the anterior part of the tumor ; so that in order to avoid the risk of wounding them, as ſoon as the skin is divided, the remainder of the operation ought to be done in the moſt cautious manner, care being taken to avoid every large blood-veſſel which makes its appearance. The ring muſt now be laid diſtinctly in view ; a ſmall portion of the protruding sac muſt allo be expoſed; after which the directory is to be introduced between the ring and the ſac, placing the point of the inſtrument obliquely upwards and outwards. A blunt pointed biſtoury is now to be introduced into the groove of the directory, and by it the ring is to be dilated till the point of the finger can be introduced. The directory is now to be laid aſide, and the finger uſed in place of it through the reſt of the operation. After the operation is finiſhed, the dreſſings are to be applied, and the whole ſecured by a T bandage, or ſuſpenſory bag, properly ſtuffed with ſoft lint.</p><p>The patient, on being carried to bed, ſhould have a pillow under the buttocks, to elevate them a little above the reſt of the body, and ſhould be treated in the manner which has been already directed. As ſoon as the wound is firmly cicatrized, a truſs ought to be properly fitted and uſed through the reſt of the perſon’s life. Females are liable to this ſpecies of rupture as well as men ; and as the opening in the external oblique muſcles is exceedingly similar in both ſexes, the treatment of this ſpecies of hernia in females is very ſimilar to what is found to anſwer in men. When clyſters, blood-letting, and the other remedies formerly enumerated, fail, the same operation of enlarging the opening in the tendon of the oblique muſcle is here equally proper as in the other ſex.</p><p>As modeſt women are apt to conceal disorders of this kind, they may frequently happen when the ſurgeon receives no information about them. Whenever, therefore, ſuch ſymptoms of colic occur as give reaſon to ſuſpect the exiſtence of hernia, a particular examination ought always to be made, in order, if poſſible, to detect the cauſe of the miſchief, from the removal of which alone a cure can be expected.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Hernia Congenita.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> teſtes in the fœtus are, till near the time of delivery, lodged in the cavity of the abdomen. When they deſcend into the ſcrotum, they puſh before them a portion of the peritonaeum, which afterwards forms the vaginal coat. The paſſages by which they deſcend are ſoon ſhut up ; but ſometimes the contrary happens, and then a portion of ſome of the abdominal viſcera paſſing down, forms that ſpecies of hernia to which new-born infants are liable, termed by Haller the <hi rend="italic">hernia congenita.</hi> The teſticle and protruded inteſtine being here in contact with one another, the tunica vaginalis teſtis forms the hernial ſac.</p><p>It has been affirmed by ſome of the lateſt writers, that hernia congenita cannot be diſtinguiſhed from that contained in the common herniary ſac ; and that though there was a diſtinction, it could be of no material uſe in practice. But Dr Monro obſerves, that a hernia congenita may be diſtinguiſhed in an adult by an evident external mark ; which is, that the bowels puſh down between the ſac and the forepart and ſides of the teſticle, ſo as often in a great meaſure to conceal it ; whereas, in the common hernia, every part of the teſticle can be felt diſtinctly : And that it is of material uſe to make the diſtinction; because in whatever manner we operate in hernia congenita, unleſs we take the utmoſt care to exclude the air, there will be a more violent inflammation and greater diſtreſs than in common cases, becauſe the teſticle will partake of the inflammation.</p><p>In the treatment of ruptures of the congenital kind, little difference occurs from the management of the common scrotal hernia ; only a truſs ought never to be applied to infants, unleſs the teſticle can be felt in the ſcrotum, after the contents of the hernia have been reduced ; as it would entirely prevent the descent of the teſticle, which yet remains in the abdomen. If any operation has been performed, the teſticle ſhould, immediately after the bowels are reduced, be covered with the vaginal coat, and at each dreſſing care ſhould be taken that the air be excluded.

immediately over the femoral vessels, ſometimes on the outſide of thefe, but more frequently they lie upon their inner side. The diſeaſe is more frequent in women than in men, on account of the width of the female pelvis, and of consequence the length and laxity of the ligament. The femoral hernia is more in danger of being confounded with inguinal hernia than with any other ; the tumor, however, is deeper, and the ring of the abdominal muſcles, which lies entirely above the tumor in femoral hernia, completely surrounds the parts in that of the inguinal kind.</p><p>In the treatment of femoral hernia, when ſymptoms of ſtrangulation occur, we muſt uſe all the remedies commonly practiſed for hernia in general ; only that here, in attempting to reduce the parts by the hand, the preſſure ſhould be made directly upwards. An inciſion of sufficient length is to be made through the integuments, ſo as to allow that part of the tendon which forms the ſtricture to be laid fairly in view ; and after dividing the integuments, we are cautiouſly to cut the faſcia lata of the thigh, and ſeparate any glands which may come in the way till the ſtricture and part of the ſac diſtinctly appear. The ſtricture is then to be divided, by cutting fibre after fibre ſucceſſively. The ſpermatic veſſels in the male, or round ligament in the uterus in the female, may be avoided by cutting in a direction towards the umbilicus, carefully dividing the tendon tranſversely. Some authors, from a ſense of the danger attending this part of the operation, have recommended merely to dilate the paſſage, inſtead of dividing the tendon ; but in inch a ſituation, to attempt a farther dilatation without the aſſiſtance of the knife, would probably be seldom attended with any advantage. After the parts are reduced, the wound is to be dreſſed as directed in the treatment of hernia in general: a piece of thin leather ſpread with ſome adhesive plaſter retains the dreſſings better, and with much more ease, than any other bandage.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of other Species of Hernia.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> umbilical hernia the parts protruded paſs out at the umbilicus, and are commonly the inteſtines, or omentum, or both ; ſometimes part of the ſtomach, the liver, and even the ſpleen, have been found in the ſac. Here, as in other ruptures, the peritonæum forms the ſac, and in recent cases it is generally very evident ; but by the size of its contents, or a long continuance of the diſorder, it sometimes becomes ſo connected with the ſurrounding parts, that by many its exiſtence has been doubted, and ſometimes the ſwelling has increaſed to ſuch a degree as to burſt even the ſkin itſelf. The diſeaſe occurs moſt frequently in infancy, ſoon after birth. In the adult ſtate corpulent people are more subject to it than thoſe of a contrary habit ; and pregnant women are particularly ſubject to it, on account of the size of the uterus. The diagnosis in this diſeaſe is readily made, as the diſorder can scarcely be confounded with any other. If the diſeaſe be attended to in due time, a bandage properly fitted will generally effect a cure ; and in such swellings as Occur in pregnancy, delivery will commonly remove the disorder ; but even in cases of pregnant women, a bandage early applied and properly used will give considerable relief, till a cure can be obtained by delivery. In this diſeaſe the omentum is more frequently puſhed out than any other viſcus; hence umbilical herniæ in general are not productive of ſuch bad ſymptoms as uſually occur in the other kinds of rupture. When, however, the inteſtines protrude, the uſual ſymptoms of a ſtrangulated hernia are apt to be induced ; and when the means uſually employed for returning the gut into the abdomen do not ſucceed, a cure it is evident muſt depend entirely on a thorough removal of the ſtricture. In performing this operation, an inciſion through the integuments is the first ſtep to be taken, ſo as to expose the ſtricture of the tendon and the neck of the ſac. The ſtricture is to be removed in the manner already deſcribed ; and as the tendon completely ſurrounds the neck of the ſac, the ſtricture may be cut wherever it can be moſt readily dilated. A radical cure ſimilar to that for the other ſpecies has been propoſed, but with as little probability of ſucceſs.</p><p>Ventral rupture is a protrusion of ſome of the bowels through the interſtices of the abdominal muſcles, and is moſt frequently obſerved in ſome of the parts moſt contiguous to the linea alba. The treatment of this ſpecies of diſeaſe is exactly the ſame with that of exomphalos.</p><p>Hernia of the bladder of urine, though leſs frequent than that of the omentum or inteſtines, is not very uncommon. The ſituation in which it occurs is in the groin, through the abdominal ring, in the fore part of the thigh, under Poupart’s ligament, ſo as to form inguinal or crural hernia. Inſtances have likewiſe occurred of the bladder being puſhed into the perinæum. Sometimes it occurs by itſelf, without any complication; at other times it is accompanied with inteſtines and omentum, both in inguinal and femoral herniæ : when complicated with bubonocele, the protruded part of the bladder is ſituated between the inteſtine and ſpermatic cord.</p><p>The uſual ſymptoms are a tumor, attended with fluctuation either in the groin, in the fore part of the thigh, or perinæum, which generally ſubſides when the patient voids urine. When the ſwelling is large, before water can be made with freedom, it is commonly neceſſary to have recourſe to preſſure, at the ſame time that the tumor, when in the groin or thigh, is as much elevated as poſſible ; but when the ſwelling is ſmall, and eſpecially when no ſtricture is as yet produced, the patient generally makes water with great case, and without any aſſiſtance from external preſſure. When the diſeaſe occurs without any complication, it is commonly owing to a ſuppreſſion of urine. In the diagnoſis care ought to be taken not to miſtake it for a hydrocele. In recent cases, the part protruding may in general be eaſily reduced, eſpecially if we attend to the ſuppreſſion of urine, which probably gave riſe to the diſeaſe. A proper truss ought afterwards to be worn for a conſiderable time. When the diſeaſe has been of long ſtanding, adhesion takes place between the bladder and cellular ſubſtance of the ſcrotum. In this caſe, therefore, as long as no ſymptoms occur to render the operation neceſſary, a ſuſpenſory bandage, ſo fitted as effectually to ſupport the prolapſed parts, is the only probable means of relief.</p><p>Sometimes the bladder, owing to a ſuppreſſion of urine, at other times part of the inteſtines, have been found to protrude through the vagina. In the former caſe a fluctuation of water is perceptible to the touch.</p><p>The reduction is made by laying the patient on her back with her loins somewhat raised, and preſſing with the forefinger from the vagina. Deſcents may in future be generally prevented, by evacuating the urine often, and by the uſe of a peſſary introduced into the vagina. Nearly the ſame means are employed in reducing the inteſtine when it is found to protrude.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXIV. <hi rend="italic">Of Hydrocele.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Every</hi> tumor formed by a collection of water might with propriety be named <hi rend="italic">hydrocele,</hi> but the chirurgical acceptation of the term implies a watery ſwelling ſituated in the ſcrotum or ſpermatic cord.

The ſcrotum with its contents are liable<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0162.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0156"/>
to both varieties of the diſeaſe ; ſo is the ſpermatic cord with its coverings.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. A <hi rend="italic">naſarcous Hydrocele of the Scrotum.</hi></p><p>As ſoon as water has collected in any conſiderable quantity in the ſcrotum, a ſoft, inelaſtic, colourleſs tumor is obſerved over the whole of it ; impreſſions are eaſily received and retained for some time ; the ſkin at firſt preſerves its natural appearance, and the rugæ of the ſcrotum are not much altered ; but as the ſwelling advances, they gradually diſappear, and are at laſt totally obliterated. The ſwelling, from being at firſt ſoft, and of a conſiſtence ſimilar to dough, by degrees turns more firm, and the ſkin at laſt acquires an unnatural white ſhining appearance. The tumor at length becomes large ; and though originally confined to the ſcrotum, it at laſt ſpreads up the groin. The penis likewiſe becomes affected, and often so ſwelled and diſtorted as to excite much inconvenience and diſtreſs ; and although the ſcrotum is compoſed of parts which readily admit of dilatation, the tumor ſometimes becomes ſo enormous that it burſts from one end to the other.</p><p>In the ſurgical treatment of this diſeaſe punctures made with the point of a lancet are moſt adviſable, as large ſcarifications, in anaſarcous habits, are ſometimes apt to produce inflammation and mortification ; while simple punctures readily heal, and can be renewed with very little pain as frequently as may be necessary : and besides, punctures are equally uſeful with the incisions; for as the cells of the ſcrotum communicate freely, if the punctures be made fairly through the ſkin, the water drains off very readily, though not ſo ſoon as by ſcarification. Previous to the operation, beſmearing the part with ſome tough ointment of an innocent nature, and afterwards keeping it as dry as poſſible by a frequent renewal of dry ſoft linen cloths, in order to imbibe the moiſture, is here a necessary piece of attention. The want of this ſeems to be the cauſe of much of the miſchief which frequently enſues from operations of this kind. When ſcarifications or punctures go wrong by beginning to inflame and turn painful, &amp;c. a cold ſolution of ſaccharum faturni, applied upon ſoft linen, proves moſt effectual in putting a ſtop to the farther progreſs of the inflammation, and affords moſt immediate relief to the patient in the present diſtreſs. Lime water, employed in the ſame manner, proves alſo a very uſeful application. When, however, the diſorder proceeds to gain ground by a real mortification coming on, we ſhould immediately have recourſe to bark and other medicines uſually employed in ſuch affections.</p><p>Although the anaſarcous hydrocele, for the moſt part, depends upon a general dropsical tendency, ſome inſtances occur of a local cauſe producing a mere local dropſy of the ſcrotum. Thus, it has been known to happen from ſwellings in the groin and in the abdomen obſtructing the paſſage of the lymphatics. When this is the caſe, if tumors producing ſuch obſtructions can be extirpated, no other means will afford ſuch effectual relief; but when they are ſo deeply ſeated as to render any attempt for removing them improper, the practice we have already pointed out of making punctures in the moſt depending part of the tumor muſt be employed with a view to palliate ſuch ſymptoms as occur. It ſometimes happens in ſuppreſſion of urine, whether ariſing from ſtrictures in the urethra or from ſtones impacted in it, that the urethra burſts, and the urine in this manner getting acceſs to the cellular texture of the ſcrotum, an anaſarcous ſwelling rises immediately over the whole of it ; nor does it commonly diminiſh till the cauſe by which it is produced is removed.</p><p>In order to prevent the formation of ſinuſes, which in ſuch circumstances will otherwiſe be apt to occur, an inciſion ſhould be made into the tumor, and carried to ſuch a depth as is sufficient for reaching the wound in the urethra. In this manner a free vent will not only be given to the urine already diffuſed, but the farther collection of it may probably be prevented. If a ſtone impacted in the urethra be found to be the cauſe of effuſion, it ſhould be cut out ; and if the obſtruction be produced by ſtrictures in the urethra, they muſt be removed by a proper uſe of bougies The cauſe being thus removed, if the habit of body of the patient is good, and untainted with any venereal or other general affection, by dressing the ſore properly with ſoft eaſy applications, the opening into the urethra will probably heal, and a complete cure will in this manner be obtained. But when theſe ailments are complicated with any general affection, particularly with old venereal complaints, it frequently happens that neither mercury nor any other medicine has much influence in removing them.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis Testis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the healthy ſtate of the body, a ſmall quantity of aqueous fluid is exhaled for lubricating the ſurface of the teſticle, the ſuperfluous part of which is abſorbed by vessels appointed for that purpoſe. When the ſecretion of this fluid is either morbidly increaſed, or its abſorption diminiſhed, a preternatural collection of water is formed in the cavity of the vaginal coat, and hydrocele of the vaginal coat produced.</p><p>The ſymptoms are, a fulneſs at firſt obſerved about the inferior parts of the teſticle, and moſt remarkable when the patient is erect, becoming gradually more tenſe as the diſeaſe advances ; the tumor by degrees changing from the globular to the pyramidical form; no degree of pressure making the ſwelling diſappear at any period of the diſeaſe. In the early part of the diſeaſe therefore, if it be not combined with hernia, or with a hydrocele of the cord, the ſpermatic proceſs may be diſtinctly felt, becauſe the ſwelling does not extend beyond the ſcrotum. In its more advanced ſtate, it cannot be diſtinguiſhed : the weight of the tumor now drags the ſkin of the neighbouring parts ſo much as to cauſe the penis almoſt to diſappear ; and in this ſtate of the diſeaſe the teſticle cannot be felt without much difficulty. On a minute examination, a hardneſs is always to be felt along that part of the ſcrotum where the teſticle is situated ; and at this point pressure excites ſome uneafineſs. Fluctuation of a fluid may in general be diſtinguiſhed through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe. In late ſtages, however, the appearance of a fluid is not very evident.</p><p>The tranſparency of the tumor has been generally suppoſed to be the principal criterion of this ſpecies of the diſorder ; but this muſt depend upon the nature of the contents, or thickneſs oſ the ſac ; ſo that, though the transparency of the tumor is a certain ſign of the exiſtence of water, its opacity cannot upon any account be conſidered as an indication of its abſence. Through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe the tumor is not attended with pain, but ſome uneasineſs is commonly felt in the back by the weight of the ſwelling of the ſpermatic cord. This is more particularly the caſe when a ſuſpenſory bandage is not uſed.</p><p>In the radical cure of hydrocele, in whatever way it is attempted, ſome degree of fever and inflammation will take place. Under the circumſtances mentioned in the prognoſis, the operation, if properly performed, is generally attended with the moſt complete ſucceſs. But if the patient be very old, infirm, and diſeaſed, an operation may be attended with ſuch a degree of inflammation, and conſequent ſup-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0163.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0157"/>
puration, as to be in danger of deſtroying a constitution already greatly impaired, and therefore ought not to be performed.</p><p>Various methods have been propoſed for the cure of hydrocele, all of which may be reduced to two general heads : Such as have in view only a temporary relief, and which is therefore termed the palliative cure ; and ſuch as are meant to effect a radical cure. When the tumor has become ſo large as to be inconvenient from its ſize, an evacuation of the water by ſurgical means becomes necessary. In this caſe, if the patient either refuſes to ſubmit to the operation for a radical cure, or if his ſtate of health render that operation improper, the palliative treatment, or a mere evacuation of the water by puncture, is the only means which can be employed.</p><p>A lancet-pointed trocar was many years ago recommened for drawing off the water in this manner by the preſent Dr Monro ; and ſince that time it has in an improved ſtate (fig. 77.), been recommended by Mr Andree ; another (fig. 78.) has been propoſed by Mr Bell. With any of theſe an opening may be made into the tunica vaginalis with ſafety.</p><p>The operator with one hand ſhould graſp the tumor behind, to press the contained fluid to the anterior and under part of it. If a round trocar is to be uſed, a puncture with a lancet ſhould be made where the trocar is to enter ; but where a flat trocar is to be employed, the aſſiſtance of the lancet is unnecessary.</p><p>As ſoon as the inſtrument has pierced the vaginal coat, the ſtilette ſhould be withdrawn, and the canula left in the ciſt. The water will now run off ; and if the tumor be not uncommonly large, it may be all drawn off at once ; but as the ſudden diſcharge of it, by taking off the ſupport, might be in danger of rupturing ſome of the veſſels, it ſhould be diſcharged by slow degrees. When the whole is evacuated, a piece of adheſive plaſter ſhould be immediately applied to the orifice ; and a compreſs of ſoft linen being laid over the ſcrotum, the whole ſhould be firmly supported with a ſuſpenſory bag (fig. 79.) or a T bandage. The patient in this ſtate being laid in bed, all kind of uneaſineſs is in a few minutes commonly gone, and he is able to follow his ordinary buſineſs without interruption.</p><p>The intention of every means now in uſe for the radical cure of this ſpecies of the diſeaſe, is to induce ſuch a degree of inflammation on the parts in which it is ſcated as may obliterate entirely the cavity of the tunica vaginalis, by making it adhere to the ſurface of the teſticle. The means at preſent generally employed for effecting a cure are, exciſion of the tunica vaginalis; the application of cauſtic ; the uſe of a ſeton ; a ſimple inciſion of the ſac ; and the injecting of acrid liquors into the tunica vaginalis, after drawing off the fluid which it contained. The method of cure, by the removal of the vaginal coat, is, firſt to lay open the vaginal coat, and then to cut it away by different ſnips of a pair of ſcissars. The ſac being removed, the parts are to be dressed and treated in the ſame manner as in the operation where ſimple inciſion is uſed.</p><p>The cure by cauſtic is attempted in the following manner : The ſcrotum being ſhaved, a piece of common paſte cauſtic, properly ſecured with adheſive plaſter, is applied, of about a finger’s breadth, the whole length of the tumor ; and if, on removing the cauſtic, it has not penetrated into the vaginal coat, an opening is made in it with a ſcalpel, ſo as to evacuate the contents, lay bare the teſticle, and admit of proper dreſſings. But Mr Elſe, one of the lateſt writers in favour of the method of cure by cauſtic, says, that there is no neceſſity for ſuch an extenſive application of cauſtic as many have recommended ; that an eschar of the ſize of a shilling is ſufficient; that this may be always fully obtained by the application of cauſtic paſte of the ſize of a ſixpence, which is to be laid on the anterior and under part of the ſcrotum, and to be properly ſecured by plaſter, in order to prevent it from ſpreading. The cauſtic commonly produces all its effects in five or six hours, and may then be removed. At this time digeſtives, or an emollient poultice, muſt be applied over the ſcrotum, and the whole ſuspended with a bandage. Inflammation, Mr Elſe obſerves, is ſoon induced over the whole tunica vaginalis ; and the febrile ſymptoms which ſucceed, he adviſes to be kept moderate by bloodletting, injections, emollient poultices, and a low regimen. In a few days the eſchar of the ſcrotum ſeparates, and comes away ; and in a gradual manner, in the courſe of four, five, or six weeks, the whole tunica vaginalis comes off, when the wound for the moſt part ſoon heals, and a complete cure is obtained.</p><p>Where it is intended to treat hydrocele by means of a ſeton, it may be done in the following manner : An opening is made with a ſcalpel, or the ſharp-pointed biſtoury, in the ſuperior part of the tumor, large enough to admit with eaſe a thick cord of common white ſewing ſilk. A director, with an eye at one end, in which the cord is inſerted, is introduced at this opening ; and its farther extremity being carried down to the moſt depending part of the tumor, an opening is there made, of about half an inch in length, by cutting upon the director with the biſtoury ; the director being now drawn till a ſufficient quantity of ſilk is left hanging out below, the operation is in this manner finiſhed.</p><p>Another very ſimple method of introducing a ſeton is by means of a ſilver canula and perforator.</p><p>In the operation for a radical cure by inciſion, the patient being laid upon a table of convenient height, and properly ſecured by aſſiſtants, with the ſcrotum lying nearly on the edge of the table, the operator with one hand ſhould graſp the tumor behind, ſo as to keep it firm and make it ſomewhat tenſe anteriorly : With a common round edged ſcalpel in the other hand, he ſhould now divide the external integuments by one continued inciſion from the upper to the under end of the tumor. An opening is next to be made in the vaginal coat with a large lancet, or a ſharp pointed biſtoury (fig. 80.), at the upper end of the firſt inciſion. This opening ſhould be of ſuch a ſize as freely to receive the finger of the operator, which is to conduct a blunt pointed biſtoury, ſo as to divide the ſac down to its bottom, which is conſidered as being of advantage, by preventing partial adheſions and the riſk of a return of the diſeaſe.</p><p>The inciſion being completed, the teſticle is now brought fully into view ; and if the tunica vaginalis be found, the dreſſing may be finiſhed immediately. But if the ſac be diſeaſed, it is to be removed, which may be readily accompliſhed by a ſcalpel or biſtoury.</p><p>When the hydrocele, as ſometimes happens, affects both ſides at the ſame time, if, when the operation is done on one side, an opening be made into the vaginal coat of the oppoſite side, at the upper part, through the ſeptum ſcroti, and the inciſion carried down to the bottom of the tumor, the ciſt can be equally well laid open, the water as completely evacuated, and a return of the disease as much prevented, as when the operation is done in the uſual manner, and at different times.</p><p>In whichever way the inciſion is made, if the teſticle be found, the wound ought to be quickly dressed ; for it is found, that on this much of the succeſs of the operation depends. For if the vaginal coat be merely applied to the teſticle, or united by futures, as ſome have adviſed, partial adheſions are apt to take place, before a degree of inflammation is produced over the whole ſufficient for making a<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0164.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0158"/>
complete cure. In this manner cavities are left, which either fill with pus during the cure, and require to be laid open, or they afterwards give rise to collections of water, and thereby occaſion a return of the diſeaſe. The practice of fluffing the cavity of the ſore with dreſſings is alſo a frequent cause of miſchief, by exciting too great a degree of inflammation in the part. But when the dreſſings are properly managed, ſymptoms of violence almoſt never occur. The lateſt authors adviſe, that in dreſſing the parts after the operation, two pieces of lint or ſoft old linen are to be dipped in oil, or in a liniment of wax and oil, and then, by the help of a probe, are to be inferred into the bottom of the ſac on each side of the teſticle, leaving a sufficient quantity of the pledgets hanging out of the wound, ſo as to admit of being easily withdrawn at the first or second dressing. The edges of the wound are next to be dreſſed with pledgets of cerate, and the ends of the oiled pledgets turned over on each side. Several pieces of ſoft lint are then to be laid over the wound, and theſe ſhould be more or leſs numerous in proportion to the heat of the ſeaſon. A compreſs of linen is now to be laid over the whole, and the dreſſings ſupported by a T bandage or ſuſpenſory bag properly fitted. The patient is then to be carried to bed ; an anodyne ſhould be given, eſpecially if there be much pain ; and he ought to be adviſed to lie as much as poſſible upon his back for a few days after the operation.</p><p>In the third or fourth day after the operation, all the dreſſings, except thoſe between the teſticle and tunica vaginalis, are to be removed ; and if this cannot be done readily, as the parts are otherwise apt to become uneaſy, a ſponge dipped in warm water ſhould be applied. On ſome occasions, at the first dreſſing, and always at the ſecond or third, the pledgets inſerted between the tunica vaginalis come away ; and whenever this happens, they ſhould be renewed. It is alſo proper to renew them daily for the first fourteen or fifteen days after the operation ; not however of the same depth as the first, for during the latter part of the cure they need only to be inſerted as far as to prevent the divided edges of the tunica vaginalis from adhering to the teſticle, before the adheſive process has taken place in the parts more deeply ſeated. Particular attention however is necessary to this part of the treatment ; for when the diſeaſe returns, it has been found to be chiefly owing to the edges of the vaginal coat being allowed to adhere to the teſticle, before adheſion had taken place between the deeper parts.</p><p>A complete adheſion of the two coats of the teſticle, the tunica vaginalis, and tunica albuginea, takes place moſt frequently about the third week after the operation. Previous to this time, inflammation continuing gradually to increaſe, the tumor becomes larger till it acquire ſomewhat of the ſize of a ſwelled testicle from gonorrhoea ; but after this period it gradually ſubſides, and the ſore produced by the inciſion, and now reduced to a line, heals in ſome time between the fourth and eight week, according to the habit of body, age of the patient, and other circumſtances.</p><p>Having thus given an account of the methods uſually employed in the cure of hydrocele, we ſhall now make a few observations on the comparative advantages of the three last. From the teſtimony of many authors of credit, it is evident, that any of theſe methods, in moſt inſtances, prove effectual ; but every practitioner being apt to be prejudiced in favour of a particular method, he generally continues to follow that mode and no other ; and finding it commonly ſucceed, be by degrees perſuades himſelf, that other methods of cure, with which he has not had ſuch opportunities of becoming acquainted, are liable to objections, which thoſe who have practiſed them do not find to be the caſe. The reſult of Mr B. Bell’s obſervations upon this ſubject is, that although all the three modes of operating, by cauſtic, the ſeton, and ſimple inciſion, are perhaps equally capable of producing a radical cure ; yet, that of the three, the latter, viz. the mode by the ſimple inciſion, is liable to feweſt objections, and effects a cure, both with leaſt trouble to the operator and leaſt risk to the patient : and of the other two, the treatment by cauſtic appears to be the beſt. He has ſeen all the three produce troubleſome ſymptoms, ſuch as, pain and tenſion of the abdomen, inflammation, and fever ; but heſitates not to say, that the ſeton is more frequently productive of theſe effects than any of the other methods.</p><p>Besides the methods already mentioned, another has been lately revived, viz. the injecting of irritating liquors into the vaginal coat of the testicle. This method is particularly deſcribed by a Monſieur Lambert of the laſt century, and may be of much older date for any thing which is known to the contrary. From ſome cause or other it ſeems to have been entirely laid aſide till about the middle of the preſent century, when it was practiſed by Mr Monro (afterwards a phyſician-general in the West Indies), under the sanction of the late Dr Monro, and favourably received and followed by some of the first ſurgeons of this place. But in general, though the cure appeared complete, the diſeaſe returned.</p><p>The preference is uſually given to wine, and commonly that is somewhat diluted ; but where no pam is excited by the injection, the liquor ſhould be diſcharged, and a ſtronger one used. For where no pain takes place, a cure is not to be expected.</p><p>The following is the moſt approved method of performing the operation : The operator ſhould be provided with a flat trocar and canula, and with a bag of reſina elaſtica, fitted with a ſtop-cock and pipe, which ought exactly to suit the canula. See fig. 81.</p><p>The patient being laid in an horizontal poſture, either upon a bed or a table, the water ſhould be drawn entirely off from the tumor by a flat trocar paſſed into the under and fore part of it. The operator ſecuring the canula with the one hand, is with the other to pals the tube of the injection-bag fairly through it, and with gentle pressure to force in as much of the liquid as may reach the whole ſurface of the vaginal coat, as well as the whole ſurface of the teſticle. The bag ſhould now be removed, leaving the tube within the canula of the trocar, so that by turning the ſtop- cock the injection may be retained in the cavity of the tumor. The canula of the trocar ought ſtill to be kept fixed, otherwise it might recede, by which the liquid would inſinuate into the cellular ſubſtance of the ſcrotum. The liquor ſhould likewiſe be brought into contact with every part of the cavity; and after remaining about four, or at the moſt five, minutes in the ſac, it ſhould be entirely diſcharged through the canula of the trocar, after withdrawing the tube of the elaſtic bag.</p><p>Sometimes intenſe pain is felt immediately after the liquor is thrown in. When this is the caſe, it ſhould be diſcharged as ſoon as it has paſſed over the different parts of the tunica vaginalis. Some recommend a repetition of the same kind of injection immediately after the first has been diſcharged, and to be retained for the same period, though this is not commonly practiſed.</p><p>The whole of the injection ſhould be completely diſcharged, after which the ſcrotum ſhould be covered with a pledget of cerate, a compreſs being applied over it, and retained with a suspensory bag. The patient ought to be in bed for ſeveral days, and ſupport the ſcrotum in the bandage by means of a ſmall pillow.</p><p>Though it is difficult to aſcertain the proportion of thoſe<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0165.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0159"/>
who are cured by the method of injections, and though it is to be regretted that hitherto the diſeaſe is found to return in a great proportion of thoſe upon whom this operation has been performed ; yet, on account of the facility with which it can be done, the comparatively ſmall pain with which it is attended, the quickneſs of the cure, and chiefly becauſe it does not, in caſe of a return of the diſeaſe, preclude the future operation of incision, it appears a method which, in all probability, will be more and more adopted into practice.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Hydrocele of the Spermatic Cord.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Anasarcous</hi> hydrocele of the ſpermatic cord ſometimes accompanies aſcites, and at other times it is found to be confined to the cellular ſubſtance in or about the ſpermatic cord. The cauſes of this diſeaſe may be, obſtructions in the lymphatics leading from the part in conſequence of ſcirrhous affections of the abdominal viſcera, or the preſſure of a truſs applied for the cure of hernia.</p><p>When the affection is connected with anaſarca in other parts, it is then ſo evident as to require no deſcription. When it is local, it is attended with a colourleſs tumor in the courſe of the ſpermatic cord, ſoft and inelaſtic to the touch, and unaccompanied with fluctuation. In an erect poſition of the body it is of an oblong figure ; but when the body is recumbent, it is flatter and ſomewhat round. Generally it is no longer than that part of the cord which lies in the groin, though ſometimes it extends as far as the teſticle, and even ſtretches the ſcrotum to an uncommon ſize ; an inſtance of which is related by Mr Pott, who from a ſwelling of this kind diſcharged 11 Engliſh pints at once. By preſſure a great part of the ſwelling can always be made to recede into the abdomen. It inſtantly, however, returns to its former ſituation on the preſſure being withdrawn.</p><p>When the tumor is connected with general anaſarca of the ſyſtem, it can only be cured along with the rest of the diſeaſe ; but when the ſwelling is local, the remedy is also to be locally applied. An inciſion is to be made of ſuch a ſize as may be ſufficient for diſcharging the whole of the water ; in the performance of which, attention is necessary to guard againſt hurting the ſpermatic veſſels. The contents of the tumor being diſcharged, the ſore is to be treated like any other simple wound.</p><p>Encyſted hydrocele of the ſpermatic cord ſometimes begins in the upper, but generally at the lower part of the ſpermatic cord. On its firſt appearance it is ſo ſmall as to give little or no trouble ; hence it is ſeldom particularly attended to till it has acquired a conſiderable ſize. By degrees it extends as far as the abdominal muſcles, and ſometimes reaches to the bottom of the ſcrotum; and to a person unacquainted with the appearance of the diſorder may be miſtaken for a hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis. But here the tumor is always above the teſticle, which is diſtinctly felt below ; and even in the advanced ſtate of the diſeaſe the teſticle is found in the back part of it perfectly unconnected with the ſwelling ; whereas, in the advanced ſtages of hydrocele in the vaginal coat, although ſome hardneſs is diſcovered where the tunica vaginalis adheres to the testicle, yet when the ſwelling is great the teſticle cannot be distinctly felt. In the encyſted hydrocele of the cord, the figure and ſize of the penis is little altered ; whereas, in caſes of common hydrocele, the penis frequently diſappears almoſt entirely. In other respects the two diſeaſes are nearly ſimilar. It ſometimes happens that the water is contained in two diſtinct cells. In that caſe the tumor is ſomewhat puckered up, or diminiſhed in its diameter. A ſimilar appearance alſo occurs, when this variety of the diſeaſe is connected with hydrocele of the tunica vaginalis, which ſometimes takes place.</p><p>The only other tumors with which this one may be confounded are, the anasarcous hydrocele of the ſpermatic cord, and a real hernia. But in neither of theſe is the fluctuation of a fluid perceptible, and to the touch they are both ſoft and inelaſtic ; whereas, in this variety of hydrocele, the tumor has a ſpringy feel, and a fluctuation is ſenſible to the touch ; and in both the one and the other the ſwelling recedes ſomewhat upon preſſure, which it never does here.</p><p>From hernia it is chiefly diſtinguished by the tumor beginning ſome way down the cord. In hernia the tumor turns leſs when the patient is in an horizontal poſture, and is conſiderably affected by coughing and ſneezing ; but this kind of hydrocele is not altered in ſize by any ſuch circumſtances, nor has it the common ſymptoms which attend a hernia.</p><p>Infants are frequently ſubject to this diſeaſe, as well as to an anaſarcous ſwelling of the cord, and an œdematous tumor of the ſcrotum. But here the complaint is ſeldom permanent ; for in moſt inſtances it readily yields to gentle friction, with any ſtimulating or aſtringent application, as a ſtrong ſolution of ſal ammoniac in vinegar, &amp;c. But in adults, the ciſt, in every variety of encyſted hydrocele, becomes ſo firm as not to be affected by external applications; ſo that when the tumor becomes large, it is neceſſary to uſe means for producing either a palliative or radical cure, in the same manner as is done for a hydrocele in the vaginal coat.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Haematocele Scroti.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">We</hi> ſhall mention in this place the diſeaſe called ha <hi rend="italic">matocele scroti,</hi> which is occaſioned by blood extravalated in the inner ſubſtance of the ſcrotum, in the tunica vaginalis, or in the ſpermatic cord but the uſual ſituation is in the tunica vaginalis teſtis.</p><p>Tumors of this kind may be produced by any thing which ruptures the blood veſſels of the part, but they are commonly the conſequence of external violence. In the tunica vaginalis this diſorder may be produced by the point of a trocaror of a lancet in tapping for hydrocele. In ſuch a caſe, we are commonly informed of the accident by blood being diſcharged along with the water ; though ſometimes it does not appear till the whole of the water is evacuated, and then a tumor of a conſiderable ſize ſuddenly takes place. Sometimes it happens where the quantity of water has been ſo uncommonly great that the hidden dilcharge of it, by taking away the ſupport which the veſſels have been accuſtomed to receive, has been the cauſe of their rupture ; and it ſeems certain, that whenever a tumor is produced either in the ſcrotum or cord ſuddenly after the water of a hydrocele has been evacuated by tapping, that it is entirely owing to an extravaſation of blood.</p><p>In the ſpermatic cord injuries of the same kind will be attended with a ſimilar effect upon the veſſels of the ſac containing the water. The diſtinction between blood and water in the ſubſtance of the ſcrotum is readily made by the colour ; for where the diſeaſe is produced by blood, it forms a real eſchymoſis. The tumor feels heavier in the tunica vaginalis when filled with blood than where it is filled merely with water; the treatment is nearly the same with that in hydrocele. In the commencement of the anasarcous or diffuſed hæmatocele, when produced from slight external violence, the application of ſtimulating or aſtringent fluids will ſometimes diſcuſs it ; but if this prove ineffectual, the tumor is to be laid open, and treated exactly as was directed for hydrocele ; only if a ruptured veſsel be diſcovered, it muſt be ſecured by ligature. In like manner, all collections<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0166.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0160"/>
of blood either in the vaginal coat or ſpermatic cord are to be laid open, and treated as in hydrocele. If bleeding veſſels appear, they are to be ſecured. Sometimes, however, theſe cannot be detected ; an oozing takes place which it is difficult to reſtrain, even by the uſe of bark, vitriolic acid, and other means generally employed in ſuch caſes. It has been uniformly found, that local remedies prove chiefly uſeful here, particularly the application of ardent ſpirits, sether, or tincture of myrrh, to the ſurface of the ſore. Pledgets of ſoft lint, ſoaked in one or other of theſe, not only ſerve to check the diſcharge of blood, but in general tend to promote the formation of good matter.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXV. <hi rend="italic">Of Varicocele, Circocele, Spermatocele, and Pneumatocele.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Varicocele</hi> is a preternatural diſtenſion of the veins of the ſcrotum, which in this ſtate form a tumor of hard, knotty inequalities, ſeldom painful, and generally attended with no inconvenience excepting what ariſes from its bulk. Circocele is ſimilar in its nature to the former, but ſituated in the ſpermatic cord, extending from the abdominal ring to the superior part of the ſcrotum, and produced by a varicoſe ſtate of the ſpermatic vein. Both of theſe diſorders are occaſionally produced by obſtruction in the veins; but are moſt frequently owing to a relaxed ſtate of theſe vessels ; to which we may add, that on account of the ſmallneſs of the corresponding artery, they are not ſufficiently affected by its influence. The tumor produced by theſe diſorders is ſometimes ſo large as to appear like a hernia or hydrocele; but we diſtinguiſh it from theſe by the touch, for varicoſe veins are like worms filled with elaſtic matter. We have another mark upon which we can ſtill more depend : The tumor in the erect poſture of the body is much increaſed, while in the horizontal ſituation it almoſt entirely diſappears.</p><p>Another diſorder is obſerved by late authors, where a collection of blood is ſometimes found within the tunica albuginea teſtis, and is ſuppoſed to be a kind of hæmatocele, er more probably varicocele. Sometimes the collection is ſo conſiderable, that a fluctuation reſembling that of an hydrocele of the vaginal coat of the teſticle is obſervable. When this is miſtaken for hydrocele, and an opening is made into it with a trocar, a diſcharge is produced of a duſky-coloured blood, ſomewhat reſembling thin chocolate : But though the tumor may be diminiſhed by the evacuation thus obtained, yet the alteration is inconſiderable ; nor is the patient ever relieved, but on the contrary made worſe by ſuch an operation. Caſtration, after this, becomes necessary ; but even this has been found ineffectual : ſo that the patient had better be adviſed to truſt to nature, aſſiſted by a proper ſuſpenſory bandage, than to ſuffer the attempt of a radical cure ; for it has been obſerved, that in ſome inſtances they have remained ſtationary for many years, whereas they never fail to become much worſe by any attempt to evacuate the fluid.</p><p>When tumors, er the pressure of a truſs, has been the cauſe of ſuch complaints, a proper attention to theſe ought to be the firſt attempt towards a cure. But when a relaxed ſtate of the veins is ſuſpected, we ought to recommend a ſuſpenſory bandage, an horizontal poſture, the cold bath, and the application of a ſolution of alum and other aſtringents. By a proper exhibition of theſe, the diſeaſe may at leaſt be prevented from increaſing, ſo as to render any operation unneceſſary.</p><p>By ſpermatocele is underſtood a morbid diſtenſion of the vas deferens and epidydimis. The diſeaſe may ariſe from tumors, ſtricture, or inflammation about the vas deferens, or its termination in the penis ; but more probably from inflammation there. When an inflammatory dispoſition is diſcovered, general and topical blood letting, gentle laxatives, a low cooling diet, and reſt of body, will commonly be found the best remedies. When tumors are found to preſs upon the vas deferens, they ought either to be brought to a ſtate of ſuppuration, or entirely extirpated, if that can be properly effected. If the diſeaſe proceed from a venereal cauſe, nothing can be ſo uſeful as a courſe of mercury properly directed.</p><p>By pneumatocele is underſtood a diſtenſion of the ſcrotum from a collection of air.</p><p>The principal cauſe of this diſeaſe, which rarely happens, is wounds in the lungs, by which air passes through the common cellular ſubſtance into the ſcrotum ; but from whatever cauſe the tumor is produced, the diſeaſe is to be treated by making ſmall punctures with the point of a lancet, as in the case of anaſarcous ſwellings formed by water.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXVI. <hi rend="italic">Of Sarcocele, or Scirrhous Testicle.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sarcocele</hi> implies a fleſhy, enlarged ſtate of the testicle, much firmer and harder to the touch than is obſerved in hernia humeralis or inflamed teſticle.</p><p>The ſymptoms vary exceedingly in different patients ; but the following are the moſt general : The firſt symptom is commonly a ſmall enlargement, without much pain, and no diſcoloration of the part. The tumor becomes gradually larger, and the hardneſs increaſes; but for a considerable time the ſurface remains ſmooth ; and when the conſtitution is otherwiſe good, the diſorder will ſometimes remain in this ſituation for a conſiderable number of years ; and in a few rare inſtances, by a moderate diet, keeping the belly open, ſuſpending the tumor properly, and avoiding violent exerciſe, or any thing which may conſiderably increaſe the impetus of the blood, the diſorder has not only been prevented from increaſing, but has in a gradual manner diſappeared entirely. More commonly, however, the tumor increaſes in ſize, and becomes ragged and unequal on its ſurface. Smart and ſevere ſhooting pains are frequently felt through its ſubſtance. Sometimes ſerum is extravaſated in the vaginal coat, or matter is collected in different parts of the tumor. The ſcrotum, now much distended, burſts, and thin, fetid, bloody matter diſcharging, the diſeaſe terminates in an ulcerated cancer of the worſt kind.</p><p>The ſpermatic cord is commonly unaffected till the tumor has acquired a conſiderable ſize, and generally not till collections of matter have been formed. After this, from being at firſt only ſlightly ſwelled, it gradually increaſes in hardneſs and bulk ; after which it becomes very painful, knotty, or unequal through its whole extent. The diſcharge from the ſcrotum ſtill continues ; but although the matter increaſes in quantity, the ſize of the tumor is not thereby diminiſhed, but, on the contrary, continually increaſes ; the edges of the ſore become hard, livid, and retorted, and fungous excreſcences puſh out from every part of it ; the health of the patient becomes entirely deſtroyed, and he is at laſt carried off in great miſery.</p><p>Hernia humeralis produced by venereal infection has been conſidered, by ſome authors, as a frequent cauſe of the worſt kind of ſcirrhous teſticle ; but the fact is very much otherwiſe ; and ſuch an idea has this bad tendency, that it prevents the perſeverance in the uſe of ſuch remedies as might have removed the diſeaſe without the neceſſity of extirpation.</p><p>Another cauſe mentioned by authors as producing<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0167.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0161"/>
ſcirrhus of the teſticle, is the hydrocele of the vaginal coat ; but though ſarcocele is frequently combined with this diſeaſe, there is every reaſon to think that the primary diſorder was in the teſticle itſelf, and that the water is only a conſequence of the other complaint. When the hydrocele happens to be the original diſeaſe, the teſticle is also found frequently altered in its appearance. lt is here paler than in its natural ſtate. It is ſometimes diminiſhed, but more frequently enlarged. The enlargement however is ſoft, harmleſs, and free from pain ; and in such a ſituation ſhould never be extirpated. To this point particular attention ought to be paid, otherwiſe we run the riſk of committing a miſtake, into which practitioners have been too frequently led—the extirpation of a teſticle which ought to have been laved. To keep free of this error, we ought to attend to the following circumſtances.</p><p>When the diſeaſe begins in the teſticle itſelf, eſpecially in the body or glandular part, or when it becomes hard and enlarged previous to any collection of water in the vaginal coat, it is to be conſidered as of a different nature from that in which an enlargement of the part ſucceeds to a collection of water ; or if, upon evacuating the water, the teſticle be found hardened, enlarged, and attended with pain and other marks of ſcirrhus, eſpecially if the ſurface be unequal or ulcerated, extirpation ought certainly to be performed. The ſymptoms above mentioned ſometimes, though rarely, begin in the epidydimis. In ſuch caſes, however, extirpation will ſeldom be adviſable, as there is here always a ſuſpicion of a venereal affection ; and then we ought by all means to try the remedies commonly uſed in ſuch diſeaſes. In the prognoſis, we attend to the age and habit of the body, as well as to the ſtate of the diſeaſe and length of time it has continued.</p><p>When the patient is young and the conſtitution unbroken, we may always hope for a cure, although the ſymptoms ſhould be very considerable ; whereas, in old infirm people, and in habits attended with an emaciated look, with indigeſtion, and other ſymptoms of obſtructed viſcera, whatever ſtate the diſeaſe may be in, there will be but a ſmall chance of success.</p><p>If the diſeaſe has ſubſiſted for a long time without considerably increaſing in ſize, we may reaſonably think it is of a milder nature than where it has made a rapid progress. As long as the teſticle is only hard and free from the formation of matter, we may expect a favourable event ; but where collections of matter have already formed, either in the ſubſtance or upon the ſurface of the testicle, there is no other chance of ſaving the patient than by means of extirpation. Previous to this, however, we are to attend to the ſtate of the ſpermatic cord ; for were any of it left in a diſeaſed ſtate, little advantage could be derived from extirpation ; nor ought the operation ever to be performed but where we can reach the whole of the diſeaſed parts. We are not to be prevented from performing it though the cord ſhould be considerably enlarged, providing it do not evidently partake of the diſeaſe of the teſticle ; for the cord is generally ſomewhat enlarged in the diſeaſed ſtate of the teſticle ; but this enlargement is for the most part merely either a varicoſe ſtate of the veins, or a watery diſpoſition of the cellular ſubſtance.</p><p>But ſuppoſing no obſtacle to the operation, the method of doing it may be this. The parts being previouſly ſhaved, the patient is to be laid upon a ſquare table of about three feet four inches high, letting his legs hang down ; which, as well as the rest of his body, must be held firm by afliſtants ; or, he may be laid acroſs a bed in the ſame manner. Then with a knife the inciſion is to be begun above the rings of the abdominal muſcles, that there may be room afterwards to ſecure the veſſels ; then carrying it through the membrana adipoſa, it must be continued downward to the bottom of the ſcrotum. A firm, waxed, flat ligature, compoſed of ſmall threads, is next, by means of a curved needle, to be paſſed round the ſpermatic cord, at leaſt an inch above the diſeaſed part, or as near the abdominal ring as poſſible ; after which the vesſels are to be secured by a running knot, and divided about a quarter or half an inch below the ligature. The cord and teſticle are then to be removed from the ſurrounding parts by diſſecting from above downwards, and no infiniment is better for this purpoſe than the common ſcalpel. After the diſeaſed parts are removed, the knot upon the cord muſt be ſlackened to diſcover the ſpermatic arteries and veins ; both of which, by means of the tenaculum or a common forceps, are to be taken up. The ligature upon the ſpermatic cord is now to be left looſe, ſo as to act as a tourniquet if a hemorrhagy ſhould enſue ; nor is there more occaſion for leaving the ligature tied than for leaving a tourniquet firmly applied to one of the extremities after amputation ; beſides, where patients have ſuffered ſuch pain as is ſometimes mentioned by authors, it has been found to be owing to the tightneſs of the ligature rather than to any other cauſe. In dividing the ligatures of the blood- veſſels at the extremities of the cord, they muſt be left of ſuch a length without the wound as to be readily removed, however much the cord may retract in the time of the cure.</p><p>In ſeparating the teſticle, a conſiderable hemorrhagy ſometimes enſues from the diviſion of the ſcrotal arteries. In ſuch a case, they ought always to be fixed with ligatures before proceeding in the operation. The parts being removed, and the blood-vessels ſecured, the wound is to be cured, if poſſible, by the firſt intention ; and for this purpoſe the sides of the ſcrotum are to be brought together in the moſt accurate manner, beginning at the under end, and ſecuring the parts by adheſive plaſter as we proceed upwards, and in ſuch a way that the ſides of the ſore may be kept properly together. About two inches of the ligatures of the cord are to be left out, and this part of the wound treated in the ſame manner as the reſt ; the whole to be ſecured by a compreſs of linen and a T bandage.</p><p>The patient ſhould now be laid to reſt, and an opiate adminiſtered ; and if, upon the ſecond or third day, any inflammatory ſymptoms enſue, they are to be removed by methods commonly employed upon theſe occaſions ; as, topical blood letting, gentle laxatives, and keeping the part conſtantly moiſt with a ſolution of ſugar of lead. The dreſſings ought not to be allowed to ſhift, elſe the cure will be greatly retarded. They are to be examined about four or five days arter the operation ; and if nothing material has happened, they may be allowed to remain two or three days longer, by which time generally the ligature can be readily removed ; and the wound will be healed by the firſt intention, excepting ſome ſmall opening in the skin, more eſpecially where the ligatures were placed. Theſe are to be drawn together by adhesive ſtraps, and dreſſed in the ſame manner as formerly. In this way, if the patient be otherwiſe healthy, a cure may be expected in little more than a fortnight</p><p>The method of dreſſing moſt frequently practiſed is to apply a quantity of ſoft lint to the sore, and then a compress of linen over it, and to ſecure the whole with a T bandage or a suſpenſory bag. The patient is then laid to reſt, and an opiate given. The ſore is not to be touched till a free ſuppuration takes place, which will commonly be<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0168.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0162"/>
about the fifth or ſixth day, and then the dreſſings are to be removed, and renewed from time to time ; once every two days, or oftener, as the quantity of matter may render it necessary. Sometimes after the operation the patient complains of pain in the ſore, and of tension and uneaſineſs in the belly. In ſuch a case, warm fomentations ſhould be applied to the abdomen, and the ſore covered with an emollient poultice, and this repeated as offen as may be necessary.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXVII. <hi rend="italic">Of the Stone.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Stone in the Bladder.</hi></p><p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">variety</hi> of cauſes have been aſſigned as tending to the formation of calculi in the bladder of urine ; as, a decompoſition of a ſuperabundant quantity of earthy matter from the blood, on account of a ſedentary life ; certain articles of diet or drink, containing a greater quantity of earthy matter than others ; a continued uſe of ſolid food without a sufficient quantity of drink ; the peculiar action of absorbent veſſels ; the particular structure of the kidney ; the nature of the different excretory vessels ; the time the urine may remain in the kidney ; the habit of retaining the water in the bladder ; particles of blood getting into the kidney or bladder, and attracting the ſtony matter ſo as to form a nucleus. A certain change of the vessels of the kidney forming the urine has by ſome been conſidered as a more probable cauſe than any of the former. The formation of calculus ſometimes begins in the kidneys, at other times in the bladder.</p><p>After a calculus has begun to be formed, it ſometimes acquires a great ſize in a few months from the firſt obvious symptoms ; but ſometimes it remains in the bladder for many years without arriving at any conſiderable ſize.</p><p>The symptoms commonly come on gradually, and bear ſome kind of proportion to the ſize and inequalities of the ſtone. One of the firſt commonly taken notice of is an uneaſy ſenſation at the point of the urethra, which for ſome time is perceptible only upon making water, or upon uſing violent or jolting exerciſe. This ſenſation gradually increaſes ; and there is along with it a frequent deſire to make water, which is commonly voided in ſmall quantities, and ſometimes only in drops. When running in a full stream, it often ſuddenly stops, though the patient is conſcious that a conſiderable quantity ſtill remains, and feels a ſtrong inclination to void it. If the ſtone be large, the patient has a constant dull pain about the neck of the bladder, and frequent deſire of going to ſtool. The urine is generally of a limpid colour ; but it is ſrequently thick, depoſiting a mucous ſediment, and when the diſeaſe is violent it is often tinged with blood. All theſe complaints are greatly increaſed by exerciſe, especially by riding on horſeback ; and from a long continuance of pain, the patient’s health by degrees becomes much impaired, and unleſs effectual means are employed for removing the cause of the diſorder, death alone puts an end to his miſery.</p><p>We are rendered certain of the exiſtence of calculus when ſmall pieces of ſtone are frequently paſſed along with the urine. When this does not occur, we cannot be certain that the symptoms do not ariſe from an ulcer or tumor in the body or neck of the bladder, or from the preſſure of tumors in the neighbouring parts. In doubtful caſes, however, we have one mark by which we can judge with certainly, and that is by means of founding.</p><p>This is performed by introducing an infiniment called a <hi rend="italic">ſound</hi> (fig. 82.), formed of ſteel finely poliſhed, and having the natural curvature of the urethra. The patient is to be laid upon a table or acroſs a bed, with his ſhoulders raised upon a pillow, to bring the ſtone to the neck of the bladder, and his thighs a little elevated and ſeparated from each other. A ſound adapted to the ſize of the urethra is to be choſen ; and previous to the introduction it is to be laid in warm water till it be of the heat of the body, and then wiped and rubbed over with bland oil, butter, or axunge. The ſurgeon lays hold of the penis with his left hand, while with his right he introduces the ſound with its concave side towards the abdomen. He is now with his left hand to draw the penis gently forward upon the infiniment, which is to be gradually puſhed into the bladder. If any difficulty occur about the neck of the bladder, this may be obviated by introducing the finger into the anus, and raiſing the point of the inſtrument ; or the same purpoſe is more readily anſwered by depreſſing the handle of the ſound. If ſtill it does not paſs with eaſe, much force ought by no means to be uſed, left the inſtrument perforate the membranous part of the urethra.</p><p>As ſoon as the infiniment enters the bladder, if it happen at once to touch the ſtone, a tremulous motion will be communicated to the fingers of the operator, and the buſiness of founding is then accompliſhed, the nature of the diſeaſe being now aſcertained. Great care, however, is here always necessary, as a few particles of sand, or a hardened ſtate of the bladder, have ſometimes communicated the same ſenſation. If the ſtone be not ſoon diſcovered, the inſtrument is to be moved in all directions ; and ſhould the operator be ſtill unsuccessful, one of the fingers of the left hand is to be introduced into the rectum, ſo as to raise that part of the bladder in which a ſtone may probably be concealed. If even this attempt prove ineffectual, the body of the patient is to be put into different politicos, and perhaps one of the best is depreſſing the ſhoulders and raising the pelvis. By this mean a ſtone may generally be felt, providing it is not contained in a cyst, which very rarely happens. If after all theſe different attempts the ſurgeon ſhould fail in diſcovering the ſtone, the inſtrument is to be withdrawn ; and if symptoms of ſtone be ſtrongly marked, and it appear that neither scirrhus nor inflammation, which might give rise to theſe symptoms, do exiſt, a second or even a third trial is to be made on the following days.</p><p>Various lithontriptics have been recommended for dissolving the ſtone in the bladder; ſuch as lime-water, cauſtic alkali, ſoap, &amp;c. but none of them can be conveyed in ſuch a ſtate into the bladder as to be much depended upon, as they undergo the greateſt change in the course of the circulation. To obviate theſe changes, it has been recommended to inject certain fluids of this claſs through the urethra into the bladder ; but this has not been attended with any material advantages, and has generally been found to do injury to the bladder. The only effectual method of removing ſtones from the bladder is by means of a chirurgical operation ; the ſuccess of which depends much upon the dexterity of the surgeon, as well as on the conſtitution of the patient.</p><p>When the conſtitution has been ſo much impaired that the patient complains greatly of ſickneſs and oppreſſion at ſtomach, with nausea and an inclination to vomit, eſpecially upon taking food ; when he has likewiſe a constant thirst, and the pulſe is as high as a hundred strokes in the minute— an operation is improper till theſe symptoms are removed. The operation is improper alſo when the patient labours under a ſevere fit of the ſtone; for then inflammation of the bladder is apt to enſue to ſuch a degree as to produce ſuppuration. By frequent attacks and continuance of theſe fits, the coats of the bladder are apt to be thickened and greatly contracted. This laſt circumstance may be known by the introduction of the sound ; for then it will stop af-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0169.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0163"/>
ter getting paſt the ſphincter of the bladder, and cannot be puſhed farther without conſiderable force, and at the ſame time giving the patient the moſt exquiſite pain. Nor ought the operation to be performed when the bladder is ulcerated, eſpecially where the patient is old and much debilitated, and where the diſcharge of matter is great.</p><p>Children more readily recover from the operation of lithotomy than adults ; and old people from the age of 55 to that of 70, whoſe constitutions have not been broken, are in leſs danger than thoſe in the full vigour of life, probably owing to inflammatory ſymptoms being more apt to proceed to a dangerous length in the extremes of age than at the middle period of life. When the conſtitution, however, is not much impaired by the continuance of the diſeaſe, the operation may be undertaken with a probable degree of ſucceſs almoſt at any period of the patient’s life.</p><p>Several methods have been recommended for performing this operation ; but there are only two which can be practiſed with any propriety. One is, where the operation is to be performed immediately above the pubes, in that part of the bladder which is not covered with peritonæum : the other, where it is done in the perinæum, by laying open the neck and lateral part of the bladder, ſo as to allow of the extraction of the ſtone.</p><p>Franco, a French ſurgeon, finding a ſtone in a child of two years of age too large to be extracted through an opening in perinæo (the place where the operation was then performed), was induced to make an inciſion into the bladder above the pubes ; but though the ſtone was extracted and the child recovered, Franco, who publiſhed the case in 1561, never attempted the operation again, and even diſſuades others from doing it. It does not appear indeed to have been much practiſed anywhere till ſome time after the commencement of the preſent century, about the year 1720, when it was adopted and frequently performed in Britain and other parts of Europe for the ſpace of about 12 or 15 years. The lateral operation came then to be more generally known, and ſince this period the high operation has been ſeldom practiſed.</p><p>In performing the high operation, the bladder muſt be in a diſtended ſtate, ſo as to make it rise above the ossa pubis, to allow an inciſion to be made into that part of it which is uncovered by the peritonæum, and thereby to prevent the abdomen from being opened or its contents expoſed. Some days, or even weeks, previous to the operation, the patient ought to be deſired to retain his urine as long as he can, ſo as to diſtend the bladder till it can hold at leaſt a pound and a half, when the perſen is an adult and of an ordinary ſize ; or the penis may be tied up to allow the urine to collect. As theſe methods may be attended with great diſtreſs, ſome prefer diſtending the bladder by injecting warm water by slow degrees till the bladder is ſufficiently full, which may be easily known by relaxing the abdominal muſcles and feeling above the pubes.</p><p>When the operation is to be performed, the patient is to be laid upon a table of convenient height, with the pelvis higher than the ſhoulders, that the parts may be fully on the ſtretch, and to prevent the bowels from pressing upon the bladder. The legs and arms are to be properly held by aſſiſtants. An inciſion is to be made through the ſkin, in the very middle of the under and fore part of the abdomen, from ſome way under the umbilicus to the ſymphyſis pubes. The cellular ſubſtance, the tendon of the oblique muſcles, the muſculi recti and pyramidales, are now to be ſeparated ; and it is better to make this ſeparation from the pubes upwards, ſo as to be in no danger of cutting into the abdomen. The ſurface of the bladder will now appear uncovered by the peritonaeum. Then the operator, with a common ſcalpel, or an abſceſs lancet, or, what is better, with a concave ſharp-pointed knife, makes a perforation into the moſt prominent part of the bladder, till the fore-finger of the left hand can be introduced. The ligature is now to be removed from the penis ; then with a probe-pointed bistoury, making the finger ſerve as a conductor, the wound is to be made ſufficiently large for the extraction of the calculus, taking particular care, however, not to carry the inciſion ſo high as to cut the peritonæum. This part of the operation being finiſhed, the ſtone is to be extracted with the finger ; or if that be impracticable, the forceps are to be employed. Should it unfortunately happen that the ſtone is broken in the extraction, the pieces are to be removed entirely by the fingers rather than by ſcoops, which were ſometimes uſed. The edges of the wound in the integuments are now to be drawn together by means of the twisted future, leaving about an inch and a half immediately above the pubes for the diſcharge of any urine which may be there evacuated. The patient is to be laid in bed, with the pelvis ſtill kept higher than the ſhoulders. Gentle laxatives are to be occaſionally given, and the antiphlogiſic plan ſtrictly adhered to.</p><p>The advantages of this method are, that larger ſtones can be extracted by this than by the lateral operation, and that fiſtulous sores are leſs apt to enſue. The diſadvantages are, the danger of opening or wounding the peritonæum, and thereby expoſing the abdominal bowels ; the frequent occurrence of inflammation about the beginning of the urethra, ſo as to occaſion the urine to be diffuſed in the cellular ſubſtance on the outſide of the bladder, and thereby producing ſinuſes difficult to cure ; the extreme difficulty of healing the wound, eſpecially in bad conſtitutions ; and, laſtly, the ſmall number of patients, after the age of thirty, who have been found to recover from this operation.</p><p>Frere Jacques, a French prieſt, was the inventor of the lateral operation. He first appeared at Paris in 1697, and afterwards operated in a great number of caſes.</p><p>He introduced a found through the urethra into the bladder with a ſtraight biſtoury, cut upon the ſtaff, and carried his inciſion along the ſtaff into the bladder. He then introduced the fore finger of the left hand into the bladder, ſearched for the ſtone, which, having withdrawn the sound, he extracted by means of forceps. The patient was now carried to bed, and the after treatment left to the attendants.</p><p>Profeſſor Rau of Holland improved upon this method, by making a groove in the ſtaff, which enabled him, with greater certainty, to continue his inciſion into the bladder: but inſtead of dividing the urethra and proſtate gland, the latter of which he was afraid of wounding, he dissected by the side of the gland, till the convex part of the ſtaff was felt in the bladder, where he made his inciſion, and extracted the ſtone ; but this method was too difficult to perform, and attended with too many inconveniences and dangers ever to be generally received. It ſuggeſted, however, to the celebrated Cheſelden the lateral method of cutting, as it is now with a few alterations very generally practiſed. We ſhall attempt to deſcribe the different ſteps of this operation in its preſent improved ſtate.</p><p>The manner of preparing the patient depends upon a variety of circumſtances. If he be plethoric, a few ounces of blood ſhould be taken away, and at proper intervals the bowels ought to be emptied by any gentle laxative which will not gripe. The diet ſhould conſiſt of light food for ſome time previous to the operation. If the pain be violent, opium is necessary. Sometimes it is relieved by keeping the patient in bed with the pelvis raised, ſo as to remove the ſtone from the neck of the bladder. He ought not to<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0170.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0164"/>
sit up, or take any exerciſe, in the time of preparation. The warm bath ought to be uſed two or three times, and the patient ſhould remain in it half an hour at each time. A laxative ought to be given on the day preceding the operation, and an injection a few hours before it is performed. The patient ought to drink plentifully of ſome diluent liquor, and to retain the urine ſeveral hours previous to the operation. If this cannot be readily affected, a slight compreſſion, by means of a ligature, may be made upon the penis, ſo as to have the bladder sufficiently diſtended, that there may be no danger of the poſterior ſurface being hurt by the end of the gorget. The perinæum and parts about the anus ſhould be well ſhaved.</p><p>A table ſomewhat more than three feet in height, and of sufficient ſtrength, is now to be firmly placed, and properly covered with blankets, pillows, &amp;c. Upon this the patient is to be laid and properly ſecured ; and for this purpose there ought to be two pieces of broad firm tape, each about five feet in length, which are to be doubled, and a noose formed upon them. A nooſe is then to be put upon each wriſt, and the patient deſired to lay hold of the middle of his foot upon the outſide. One end of the ligature is to go round the hand and foot, and the other round the ankle and hand, and croſs again, ſo as to repeat the turns in the reverse way. A running knot is then to be tied, by which the hand and foot will be properly ſecured. The buttocks are then to be made to project an inch or two over the table, and to be raiſed conſiderably higher than the ſhoulders by a couple or more pillows, and one ought to be put under his head.</p><p>The operator is now to introduce a grooved staff (fig. 83.) of proportionable size, and open to the very end, through the urethra into the bladder ; and having again fully ſatisfied himſelf of the exiſtence of a ſtone, he inclines the ſtaff, if the ſurgeon be right-handed, obliquely over the right groin, ſo that the convex part of the staff may be felt in the perinæum on the left side of the raphe. He then fixes it, and delivers it to his aſſiſtant, who is to hold it with his right hand, desiring him to preſs it gently, in order to make the ſulcus of the ſtaff project in the direction in which he received it With his left hand the ſame aſſiſtant is to raiſe and ſupport the ſcrotum.</p><p>The thighs of the patient being sufficiently ſeparated by the aſſiſtants, and the ſurgeon being ſeated upon a chair of a proper height, and in a convenient light, he makes an inciſion with a common convex edged ſcalpel through the ſkin and cellular ſubſtance, immediately below the ſymphyſis of the oſſa pubis, which is a little below the ſcrotum, and where the crus penis and bulb of the urethra meet, and on the left side of the raphe, and continues it in a slanting direction downwards and outwards to the ſpace between the anus and tuberoſity of the iſchium, ending ſomewhat lower than the baſis of that proceſs, by which a cut will be made or three or four inches in length. This inciſion ought not to be shorter than is here directed, otherwiſe there will not be room for the rest of the operation. As ſoon as the integuments are thus divided, he ought to introduce two of the fingers of the left hand. With one he keeps back the lip of the wound next the raphe, and with the other he preſſes down the rectum. He ought likewiſe particularly to guard against cutting the crures of the penis, which he can readily feel, and ſeparate at their under part with one of the fingers. He next makes a second inciſion almoſt in the ſame direction with the firſt, but rather nearer to the raphe and anus, by which he preſerves the trunk of the arteria pudica. By this inciſion he divides the tranſverſalis penis, and as much of the levator ani and cellular ſubſtance within theſe as will make the proſtate gland perceptible to the finger.</p><p>If any conſiderable vessel be cut, it is immediately to be ſecured, though this is ſeldom necessary. After this he will have a view of the membranous part of the urethra, which is diſtinguiſhed from that covered by the bulb by being very thin. He is now to ſearch for the groove of the ſtaff with the fore finger of his left hand, the point of which be preſſes along from the bulb oſ the urethra to the proſtate gland, which ſurrounds the neck of the bladder. He keeps it there ; and turning the edge of the knife upwards, he cuts upon the groove of the ſtaff, and freely divides the membranous part of the urethra, from the proſtate gland to the bulb of the urethra, till the ſtaff can be felt perfectly bare, and that there is room to admit the point of the finger ; and as the finger aſſiſts in keeping the parts ſtretched, and effectually prevents the rectum from being hurt the inciſion into the urethra may be made with perfect eaſe and ſafety.</p><p>The next part of the operation, viz. dividing the prostate gland and neck of the bladder, might, by a dexterous operator, be ſafely performed with a common ſcalpel, with the edge turned the oppoſite way. But to guard against accidents, a more convenient inſtrument, called the <hi rend="italic">cutting gorget</hi> (fig. 84.), is now in general uſe. It was originally invented by Mr Hawkins of London, and ſince his time has undergone various alerations. Fig. 85. is a double gorget invented by Dr Monro. The inner plate, which, is blunt, is made to slip forwards to protect the back part of the bladder. The membranous part of the urethra being now divided, and the fore-finger still retained in its place, the point of the gorget, previously fitted to the groove., is to be directed along the nail of the finger, which will ſerve to conduct it into the groove of the ſtaff ; and as this is one of the niceſt parts of the operation, the moſt particular attention is here required that the point of the gorget be diſtinctly heard to rub in the bare groove, and that nothing is interpoſed.</p><p>In the introduction of the gorget into the bladder, if the aſſiſtant could be depended upon, the staff might be allowed to remain in his hand : the operator, however, generally chooſes to manage it himſelf. He now riſes from his feat, takes the ſtaff from the aſſiftant, raiſes it to near a right angle, and preſſes the concave part againſt the ſymphyſis of the oſſa pubes ; ſatisfies himſelf again that the point or beak is in the groove, and then puſhes on the gorget, following the direction of the groove till the beak slip from the point of the staff into the bladder. The gorget is not to be puſhed farther than this, otherwiſe it may wound the oppoſite side of the bladder, &amp;c.</p><p>The gorget having now entered the bladder, which is readily known by the diſcharge of urine from the wound, the ſtaff is to be withdrawn, and the finger introduced along the gorget to ſearch for the ſtone, which, when felt, will point out the direction to be given to the forceps ; at any rate, the introduction of the finger ſerves to dilate the wound in the bladder ; and this being done, a pair of forceps (fig. 8 <hi rend="italic">6.)</hi> of a proper ſize, and with their blades as nearly together as their form will allow, are to be introduced, and the gorget withdrawn slowly, and in the ſame direction in which it entered, ſo as to prevent it from injuring the parts in its return. After the forceps are introduced, and paſſed till they meet with a gentle reſiſtance, but no farther, the handles ought to be depreſſed till they are ſomewhat in an horizontal direction, as this will moſt correſpond with the fundus of the bladder. One blade of the forceps is to be turned towards the ſymphyſis of the pubes to defend the ſoft parts there, the other of conſequence will guard the return. After they have diſtinctly touched the ſtone, by moving them a little in various directions, they are then to be opened; and the ſtone laid hold of, which may gene<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0171.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0165"/>
rally be done with conſiderable eaſe. It frequently happens, however, that when the ſtone is ſmall, it is not readily felt with the forceps ; and inſtances may happen where the under and back part of the bladder may be ſo depreſſed as to conceal the stone. In ſuch a ſituation, nothing will more readily bring it in the way of the forceps than to introduce the finger into the rectum, and elevate this part of the bladder. Straight forceps are generally uſed; crooked ones, in ſome very rare cases, however, may be neceſſary, and therefore the ſurgeon ought to be provided with them.</p><p>After the forceps has laid hold of the ſtone, if it be ſmall and properly placed, it may readily be extracted ; but if, on the contrary, the handles of the forceps are now obſerved to be greatly expanded, it is certain the stone is improperly fixed, or that it is remarkably large : in either case it ſhould not be held faſt, but allowed to move into the moſt favourable ſituation ; or the finger is then to be introduced ſo as to place it properly for extraction. If this cannot be done with the finger, it ought to be allowed to slip out of the forceps, in order to get it more properly fixed ; and as the moſt common form of the ſtone is flat and oval, or somewhat like a flattened egg, the forceps ſhould have hold of the ſmalleſt diameter, while an end presents to the neck of the inſtrument. The ſtone ſhould be graſped with no greater firmneſs than is merely ſufficient to bring it fairly out. It ſhould be extracted in a slow and gradual manner.</p><p>When a ſtone is broken in the bladder, all the larger pieces are to be extracted by the forceps, which are to be introduced by means of the finger ſerving as a director. The ſmaller parts are to be removed by means of a ſcoop (fig. 87.), or probably the finger may be more convenient ; and as the leaſt particle allowed to remain, or which is not waſhed off by the urine, may ſerve as the nucleus of another ſtone, a large quantity of water, properly warmed, is to be injected by a bag and pipe, or by a ſyringe ; and for this purpoſe the body of the patient ſhould approach at leaſt to an upright poſture ; and to give the particles of ſtone an opportunity of collecting near the inciſion of the bladder, the wound may be ſtopped for a little after the injection is thrown in.</p><p>When a ſtone is extracted of a regular, firm, and rough ſurface, it ſeldom happens that any others remain in the bladder. On the contrary, when it is of an irregular ſhape, and smooth and poliſhed, particularly in certain places, with impreſſions formed upon it, there is the greateſt probability of others remaining. There are exceptions, however, to theſe rules ; and therefore the operator, inſtead of truſting to them, ſhould introduce his finger, which will anſwer the purpoſe without any other ſearcher.</p><p>If, after the operation, any conſiderable artery bleeds much, it is to be taken up with a ligature ; but if this be impracticable, the hemorrhagy ought to be ſtopped by means of pressure, and for this purpoſe a firm roller introduced at the wound anſwers ſufficiently : and to prevent any ſtoppage to the diſcharge of urine, a ſilver canula, covered with caddis, and duſted over with ſtyptic powder, may be introduced into the wound with advantage.</p><p>Sometimes it happens that a conſiderable quantity of blood, inſtead of paſſing off by the wound, is collected in the cavity of the bladder, and may produce very dangerous ſymptoms. To prevent this as much as poſſible, immediately upon the operation being finiſhed, the patient’s pelvis ſhould be made conſiderably lower than the reſt of his body; by which means the wound will be kept in a depending poſture, and the blood will eſcape more readily by the wound. But it it be found that blood is ſtill lodged in the cavity of the bladder, it muſt be immediately extracted.</p><p>As ſoon as the blooding is ſtopped, the patient is to be untied, a piece of dry ſoft charpee put between the lips of the wound, and often renewed, and the thighs brought together. He is then to be laid in a bed, in ſuch a way that the pelvis may be conſiderably lower than the reſt of the body, to give a favourable direction to any blood which may afterwards flow from the wound. A conſiderable doſe of laudanum is now to be given. From 30 to 50 drops for an adult will commonly be necessary. From this period, unleſs the ſtone has been large and difficult to extract, the patient commonly falls aſleep, or at leaſt lies quiet for a few hours ; but afterwards generally begins to complain of pain in the under part of the abdomen. Anodynes are now to be given both by the mouth and anus, and warm fomentations, by means of flannels or bladders filled with warm water, are to be applied to the region of the bladder, as the affection ſeems to be of the ſpaſmodic kind.</p><p>If by a continuance of theſe remedies the pain abates, no anxiety needs be entertained concerning it ; but if it increaſe, and eſpecially if the abdomen become hard and ſwelled, and the pulſe full and quick, and theſe ſymptoms become gradually worſe, great danger is to be apprehended, as they moſt commonly take place in conſequence of inflammation. In this ſituation, as much blood ought to be taken as the patient can bear. A large injection of warm water and oil, or linſeed tea, ſhould be given every ſix or ſeven hours, and the fomentations continued at the abdomen. If the ſymptoms continue to grow worſe, the patient ſhould be immediately put into the ſemicupium or half bath.</p><p>By a proper continuance of theſe means, with a low diet and plenty of diluent drink, the above ſymptoms may frequently be removed. The reverſe, however, is ſometimes the case. The wound becomes ſloughy and ill-conditioned; all the ſymptoms, in spite of every effort, continue to increaſe, and ſoon terminate in death.</p><p>But where matters end favourably, the wound by degrees puts on a better appearance ; the urine passes almoſt from the beginning by the urethra (moſt frequently, however, it is diſcharged by the wound for the firſt two or three weeks) ; the pain in the abdomen gradually abates, the feveriſh ſymptoms are ſoon removed, a complete cicatrix is formed, and the wound is sometimes cured in a month ; though upon other occaſions three will be neceſſary. But it muſt depend greatly on the nature of the conſtitution.</p><p>Excoriation of the buttocks may be prevented by placing a ſheet under them ſeveral times doubled the breadth to be 18 or 20 inches, and to be all rolled up, except the part which is to be laid under the patient, the reſt of the roll to be by his side, which is to be unrolled as the nurſe draws the wet part from under him. If, after the uſe of this, excoriations ſhould ſtill happen, the part may be waſhed with cold water ; or the parts round the wound, after being well dried, may be rubbed with any tough simple ointment.</p><p>In patients of a debilitated conſtitution incontinence of urine frequently occurs after this operation. In general, this is removed as the patient acquires ſtrength Nouriſhing diet, cold bath, the bark, and other tonics, are of much ſervice here ; but where theſe are afterwards found ineffectual, inſtruments for compreſſing the penis, or others for receiving the urine, have been found useful, and are now made in ſuch a convenient way as to allow them to be conſtantly used so long as they may be found neceſſary.</p><p>An operation for ſtone in the bladder is much ſeldomer required in women than in men, on account of the ſhortness of the urethra in the former allowing a readier paſſage for the ſmall calculi which get into, or are formed in, the bladder. It is likewise in women more simple, and of courſe more readily performed; It might be done in the same<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0172.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0166"/>
manner as in the male, but there would be the greateſt probability of wounding the vagina. In a few caſes the operation has been performed from the vagina itſelf ; but it is by no means adviſable, as ſtones would not only be extracted with greater difficulty, but, on account of the thinneſs of the parts, the urine would moſt probably form a fiſtulous opening, and a communication be maintained between the bladder and vagina ; or cicatrices here might be attended with great inconvenience in child-labour.</p><p>In the method commonly practiſed, the patient being placed and ſecured in the same manner as in the operation upon the male, the operator introduces a ſhort grooved ſtaff, ſlightly curved (fig. 88.), into the bladder; then by means of the common gorget already mentioned, with its point passed along the groove of the ſtaff, he lays open the whole of the urethra and the neck of the bladder. The ſtaff is now to be removed, the finger introduced upon the gorget, and to feel for the ſtone, which is to be removed as already directed for the operation on the male ſubject. Where incontinence of urine occurs after the wound is healed, a peſſary is to be uſed within the vagina, or a ſponge applied, or a tin machine to receive the urine.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Stones in the Kidneys.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> ſymptoms of ſtone in the kidneys are, pain in the region of the kidneys, ſickneſs, and vomiting, the urine ſometimes mixed with blood, at other times with mucus or even purulent matter ; but the ſame ſymptoms are often induced by other cauſes, eſpecially from inflammation and ſuppuration of the kidney. Nephritic complaints have frequently ſubſiſted for a long time, where ſtones have been blamed as being the cauſe of them ; and yet upon diſſection purulent matter alone has been detected. From this circumſtance, as well as from the great depth of the parts and the large ſize of the blood veſſels of the kidney, the operation of nephrotomy could not be performed, but with the greateſt uncertainty and moſt imminent danger, and is therefore never attempted. A few caſes indeed have appeared where inflammation induced by a ſtone in the kidney terminated in abſceſs, and the ſtones were taken out ; but it was not till they had worked their way out of the kidneys into the cellular ſubſtance, ſo that it only remained to open the abſceſs and extract them ; but otherwiſe the operation is never to be thought of.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Stones in the Urethra.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Those</hi> who are troubled with calculous complaints frequently paſs ſmall ſtones along with their urine ; and when theſe are angular or of conſiderable ſize, they ſometimes stick, and give much uneaſineſs. The ſymptoms are at firſt pain, then inflammation and ſwelling, attended with a partial, or total ſuppreſſion of urine, which, if long neglected, is apt to terminate in a rupture oſ the urethra, when the urine will be diſcharged into the neighbouring parts. The greateſt attention is therefore neceſſary to get the ſtone extracted as ſoon as poſſible.</p><p>When a ſtone is in the urethra, unleſs it be of a large ſize, or has been long impacted, and the inflammation great, attempts ought to be made with the fingers to puſh it out ; but previous to this, the penis ſhould be relaxed as much as poſſible, ſo as to remove a certain degree of ſpaſm which the preſence of ſtone here probably creates. Blood ought to be drawn by general or local means, according as the patient may be of a plethoric or emaciated habit. He ſhould be immerſed in a warm bath, and get a full doſe of laudanum, and warm oil ought alſo to be thrown into the urethra. After theſe remedies have relaxed the parts as much as may be, the extraction is to be attempted.</p><p>For this purpoſe certain inſtruments have been contrived, particularly a tube containing a pair of elastic forceps (fig. 89.), to be introduced into the urethra ſo as to lay hold of the ſtone. In ſome caſes they certainly might anſwer the purpoſe, but they have not been found very uſeful ; and as they may increaſe the irritation already preſent in the urethra, they are ſeldom, if ever, employed. Inſtead of them, the ſurgeon uſes gentle pressure on the penis to puſh the ſtone outwards ; and as calculi larger than a field bean have ſometimes been paſſed by the urethra, an operation ought not to be performed till gentler means have been perſiſted in for ſome time. When theſe means have failed, an inciſion ought to be made immediately upon the ſtone, which is then to be removed by a probe, or with a pair of ſmall forceps. When a ſtone is lodged near the neck of the bladder, after the patient has been placed and ſecured in the ſame manner as for the lateral operation, while an aſſiſtant ſupports the ſcrotum and penis, the operator introduces a finger oiled into the anus, to ſupport the ſtone in its place, and prevent it from slipping into the bladder. An inciſion is then to be made, and the ſtone turned out. The after treatment will be nearly the ſame as that after the operation of lithotomy.</p><p>When, again, a ſtone has advanced further in the urethra, the beſt method is to draw the skin ſtrongly forwards or backwards, and then to cut upon it and turn it out, when the ſkin will ſlide back ſo as to cover the wound, and prevent the urine from paſſing through it ; and by this means it will generally heal by the firſt intention. If part oſ the urine paſs through the wound, and insinuate into the cellular ſubſtance, an attempt is to be made with the hand to press it back. If that prove inſufficient, a cut is to be made through the ſkin oppoſite to the inciſion of the urethra ; but this will ſeldom be found necessary. If a ſtone is fixed near the point of the urethra, it may be removed with a pair of forceps ; or, if this fail, the urethra is to be dilated with a ſcalpel ; and if this alſo be inſufficient, an inciſion is to be made as above directed. When the cure is nearly completed, a tube formed of ſilver or elaſtic gum, or a hollow bougie, may be uſed to keep the uretha of a proper ſize.</p><p>The worſt part of the urethra for a ſtone to stick in is that immediately behind the ſcrotum ; for then the urine is apt to paſs by the inciſion into the cellular ſubſtance of the ſcrotum, ſo as to occaſion large ſwellings there. To prevent this, a ſtone ſo ſituated ought, if poſſible, to be pushed forwards with the fingers ; or if this be impracticable, it ſhould be puſhed back into the perinæum by means of a ſtaff. If both methods fail, a cut is to be made at the under part of the ſcrotum, which is to be well ſupported, and at one side of the ſeptum, and continued upwards till the ſtone is felt, when an inciſion is to be made into the urethra, and the ſtone extracted as before directed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXVIΠ. <hi rend="italic">Of Incontinence and Suppression of Urine.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Incontinence</hi> of urine may ariſe from various cauſes, as, from a loss of power in the ſphincter of the bladder, while the natural tone of that organ remains unimpaired ; or from irritation about the neck of the bladder, produced by the friction of ſtones contained in it ; or from a laceration of parts by the operation of lithotomy ; or from the pressure of the uterus in a ſtate of pregnancy.</p><p>When the diſeaſe is owing to a want of tone in the ſphincter, the cure is very difficult, becauſe the constitution in general is frequently affected. The moſt uſeful remedies are tonics, eſpecially peruvian bark, chalybeate waters, and<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0173.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0167"/>
the cold bath, both generally and locally applied. Cold ſubſtances applied to the perinæum are perhaps of greater ſervice than any thing else, as cloths wet with vinegar and cold water, or with a ſtrong ſolution of ſaccharum ſaturni in vinegar ; but the best method of applying cold is to daſh water immediately from the fountain upon the anus and perinæum. When it ariſes from the irritation of ſtones in the bladder, opiates and mucilaginous liquors plentifully uſed frequently give great relief. When incontinence of urine is owing to a laceration of parts in performing the operation of lithotomy, the diſeaſe is nearly of the ſame nature as that from the cauſe first mentioned, and therefore the same remedies are of ſervice. When theſe remedies fail in either of the caſes, compreſſion of the urethra prevents any inconvenience ariſing from the constant dripping of the urine; and for this purpoſe an inſtrument termed <hi rend="italic">jugum penis</hi> (fig. 90.) is applied to the penis ; or, to press against the urethra of the female, peſſaries (fig. 91. a and b) are contrived, which are made in ſuch a way as to be introduced into the vagina, and there to preſs upon the urethra. They are sometimes made of sponge, but thoſe of ivory or wood well poliſhed are more generally preferred. A ſmall bottle made of elaſtic gum, and open at both ends for the paſſage of the menſtrual diſeharge, anſwers the purpoſe equally well. Certain caſes however occur where preſſure upon the urethra is improper, eſpecially where there is a constant deſire to paſs water ; and here much relief is obtained from the use of receivers, which are now suited to both ſexes. Fig. 92 . repreſents one for the male, and fig. 93. one for the female.</p><p>We ſhall here treat only of that ſpecies of ſuppreſſion of urine where the urine is collected in the bladder, but from ſome obſtructing cauſe is prevented from being diſcharged. It ariſes from a variety of cauſes.</p><p>When it ariſes from a want of tone in the body of the bladder, it is often connected with palſy of the lower extremities; it is frequently owing alſo to retaining urine too long. The catheter, in this caſe, is commonly an effectual remedy, and ought to be employed as ſoon as the ſuppreſſion is evidently formed, and repeated from time to time, till the tone of the ſyſtem is recovered by the uſe of proper remedies. The method of introducing the catheter is the ſame with that already directed for founding for the stone. Fig. 94. a catheter for the male, fig. 95. one for the female.</p><p>When the affection ariſes from ſpaſm about the neck of the bladder, opiates, warm water thrown into the rectum, and afterwards the warm bath, are the best means of producing relief. When it proceeds from ſcirrhus of the prostate gland, or from other tumors, or from obstructions of the urethra in conſequence of gonorrhoea, the treatment to be afterwards deſcribed will be found beſt ſuited for ſuch complaints. When the ſuppression ariſes from the preſſure of the uterus in the latter months of pregnancy, change of poſture is ſometimes found to have ſome effect ; but if this fail, immediate relief can commonly be given by the introduction of the catheter, which in women is for the moſt part readily done.</p><p>Suppreſſion of urine from inflammation affecting the neck of the bladder is one of the moſt alarming varieties of the diſeaſe, as it produces pain, and ſuch a degree of ſwelling in the parts as to render the introduction of the catheter inadmiſſible. It may ariſe from the matter in gonorrhoea paſſing backwards along the courſe of the urethra. An improper uſe of injections has likewiſe frequently produced this ſpecies of the diſeaſe. The treatment is nearly the ſame as for inflammatory complaints in other parts of the body. Blood-letting ſhould be employed, and particularly leeches ſhould be applied to the perinæum. Opiates ought to be given in large doſes. Injections of warm water ſhould be frequently thrown up the rectum, and the whole body ſhould be immerſed in the warm bath. If theſe means be properly uſed, they will very ſeldom fail of ſucceſs ; but when they do not prove effectual, when the bladder becomes painfully diſtended, and when every attempt to introduce the catheter has failed, nothing is to be depended upon but a puncture made into the body of the bladder, in order to diſcharge the water contained in it.</p><p>Various methods have been propoſed for effecting this operation. Puncturing the bladder above the pubes has been recommended by many respectable authors. The following is the method of doing it : A lancet-pointed trocar, about two inches long, is to be at once introduced through the integuments, about an inch and half above the pubes, into the body of the bladder. The stilette is to be removed as ſoon as the water begins to flow through a groove formed in it, and the urine allowed to flow through the canula, which is ſecured to the body by means of a bandage. A cork is to be fitted to the canula, that the urine may paſs off at intervals only. The canula is to be retained till the cauſe which produced the obstruction is fo far removed that the patient can diſcharge the urine in the natural way. It ought to be removed every three or four days, and cleared from the sordes which adheres to it, otherwiſe it ſoon becomes covered with a calculous cruſt, which renders the extraction exceedingly difficult. On theſe occaſions a firm probe, of sufficient length, ought to be paſſed through it into the bladder, upon which it may again be eaſily returned as ſoon as it is properly cleaned.</p><p>This method of puncturing the bladder is not altogether free from objections: the bladder being ſuſpended for a long time on the canula, its tone is ſometimes destroyed ; and if it happen to slip off the canula, the operation muſt be repeated ; beſides, the urine may be diffuſed in the ſurrounding cellular ſubſtance.</p><p>When the bladder is to be punctured from the perinæum, the trocar, which ought to be longer than the one for punic turing above the pubes, is to be introduced at a little diſtance from the rapha perinaei, and then paſſed into the body of the bladder, a little to the upper and outside of the proſtate gland, carrying the point of the instrument a little upwards, to avoid wounding the ends of the ureter or feminal veſſels. Puncturing from the anus, or the vagina in females, are attended with ſo many inconveniences that they ought never to be attempted.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXIX. <hi rend="italic">Diſeaſes of the Penis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Obſtructions of the Urethra.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Ob</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">structions</hi> of the urethra frequently occur after repeated or ſevere attacks of the venereal diſeaſe.

They are rarely found except near the point of the urethra. They are conſidered to be nearly of the ſame nature with the warts which grow upon the prepuce or root of the glans in venereal caſes. Tumors obſtructing the passage in the urine may be occaſioned either immediately by inflammation, or in conſequened of old sores within the ure<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0174.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0168"/>
thra ; or tumors, from whatever cauſe, may be ſeated in the corpora cavernoſa contiguous to the urethra, and may preſs upon it in inch a manner as to cauſe an adheſion of its sides, and thereby produce ſtoppage of the urine. Spaſmodic ſtrictures of the urethra ſometimes ariſe from ſtone in the bladder. Sometimes in gonorrhoea there is ſuch a degree of contraction that neither ſtaff nor bougie can enter. This variety of obſtruction is known by its coming on ſuddenly, and going off ſometimes almoſt completely in the ſpace of a few hours. Of the permanent ſtricture, or ſtricture properly ſo called, Mr Hunter obſerves, that in moſt of the caſes of this kind which he has ſeen the diſeaſe extends no farther in breadth than if the part had been ſurrounded with a piece of packthread. He has however ſeen the urethra irregularly contracted for above an inch in length, owing to its coats or internal membrane being irregularly thickened and forming a winding canal. He farther obſerves, that a ſtricture does not ariſe, in all caſes, from an equal contraction of the urethra all round ; but in ſome, from a contraction of one side, which throws the paſſage to the oppoſite side, and often makes it difficult to paſs the bougie. In ſome few caſes, he ſays, there are more ſtrictures than one ; he has ſeen half a dozen in one urethra, and finds that the bulbous part is much more ſubject to ſtrictures than the whole of the urethra beſides ; that they are ſometimes on this side of the bulb, but very ſeldom beyond it ; and that they are often slow in forming, it being frequently years from the time they are perceived before they become very troubleſome. Contrary to the opinion of others, Mr Hunter doubts very much if the ſtricture commonly, or even ever, ariſes from the effects of the venereal diſeaſe, or the method of cure ; for ſtrictures are common to other paſſages, and ſometimes happen in the urethra where no venereal complaint had ever been.</p><p>When obſtructions are occasioned by caruncles in the urethra, bougies (fig. 96.) ſhould be introduced rubbed over with bland oil until a reſiſtance is met with. When a bougie cannot be introduced far enough, one with a ſmaller point is to be uſed, but not till the day following, left the part be too much irritated. They ought not to be allowed to remain long at first, particularly when they occaſion a confiderable degree of pain.</p><p>When ſuppreſſion of urine ariſes from ſwellings in or about the urethra, in conſequence of inflammation, an attempt ſhould be made to diſcuſs theſe immediately, or bring them into a ſtate of ſuppuration, and diſcharge the pus as ſoon as it is formed. But when the nature of the tumor is ſuch as not to terminate in either of theſe ways, extirpation of the diſeaſed parts, when this is found practicable, is the only probable means of relief. Bougies ſhould at the ſame time be uſed to aſſiſt in the cure.</p><p>When ſpaſmodic affections are preſent in the urethra, the remedies to be employed are, warm emollients, as rubbing the part with warm oil ; anodynes, as opium given by the mouth, but more eſpecially by the anus ; blood-letting in plethoric habits, and this to be generally and locally applied ; bliſters put to the penis or perinæum; electricity, after plethora has been removed. Some caſes may be treated with bougies ; but where the diſeaſe is purely ſpaſmodical, they are generally found to be hurtful ; though in other caſes, when the violence of the diſeaſe is ſo far removed, if they can be introduced, they are of ſervice, by relieving any obſtructions which may remain after the remedies above-mentioned have been exhibited. Coſtiveneſs ought likewiſe to be guarded againſt. The permanent ſtricture is to be cured by bougies.</p><p>Bougies act ſolely by preſſure, and by ſupporting the part ; hence they ſhould be ſo large as to fill the paſſage, and sufficiently flexible to be eaſily introduced. They are formed of various materials, as a compoſition of diachylon plaſter, oil, and wax melted and put upon linen, which is afterwards properly rolled up ; or they are formed of leather catgut, &amp;c. properly prepared : but the beſt of any are thoſe which are formed of elaſtic gum. Bougies, when properly made, can ſometimes be kept in for six or eight hours together; but the length of time proper for their retention muſt depend much upon the feelings of the patient. At all times when they give much pain they ought to be removed, and not introduced again till the part is in a ſtate fit for receiving them. They ſhould be gradually increaſed in their ſize, till the paſſage returns to its natural dimensions. They ought to be continued for ſome time after, till it appear that there is no danger of a return of the complaint.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Phymosis and Paraphymosis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> phymosis the prepuce is thickened, and contracted before the glans, ſo that it cannot be readily drawn behind it. In ſome people there is a conſtitutional phymoſis from the natural ſtraitneſs of the prepuce. Sometimes it ariſes from the matter ſecreted by the odoriferous glands at the root of the glands being confined and becoming acrid ; ſometimes from an anaſarcous ſwelling of the ſcrotum and penis ; but moſt frequently from venereal virus.</p><p>The cure muſt depend upon the nature of the cauſe producing the diſeaſe. If the ſymptoms be inflammatory and of no long continuance, fomenting the parts frequently with warm emollient decoctions, or bathing them in warm milk, and then applying emollient poultices, or keeping the diſeaſed parts conſtantly moiſt with a cold aſtringent ſolution, and turning the penis upwards and ſupporting it againſt the belly, commonly give relief. If the inflammation has ariſen from a venereal cauſe, part of the fluid ought frequently to be injected, by means of a ſyringe, between the prepuce and glans, ſo as to waſh off any matter which may there be concealed ; but if the inflammation ſtill continues to increaſe, blood-letting is neceſſary, both general and local. The veins of the penis are ſometimes adviſed to be opened with a lancet ; but this is unſafe on account of the nerves. Leeches may be applied ; but care muſt be taken, in venereal caſes, left the bites of theſe animals, by abſorbing venereal matter, turn into chancres. Along with the remedies already adviſed, gentle lexatives, low diet, and abſtinence, ought to be preſcribed. But if, after a due perſeverance in theſe means, it is found that they have had little effect in removing the diſorder, or perhaps that the ſymptoms are conſtantly increaſing, and that chancres are confined under the prepuce ; in that caſe it is neceſſary to slit open the prepuce, which is beſt done by a ſharp-pointed biſtoury, concealed in a grooved directory, fig. 98. This is to be introduced between the prepuce and glands, till the director is found by the finger to have reached the upper or back part of the prepuce. The operator is now to keep the director firm with one hand, while with the other he puſhes forward the knife, till its point paſſes through the prepuce ; then drawing the inſtrument towards him, he cuts the prepuce through its whole length.</p><p>The operation being performed, the parts are to be wasted and cleaned with warm water, and the sore dressed with a little ſoft lint, and a compreſs of linen laid over it. The whole may be retained by a ſmall bag properly adapted, and ſecured by two ſtraps to a bandage put round the body. This bag may be left open at the under end, to allow the patient to make water, without removing the dreſſings ; but if this be found impracticable, the dreſſings may be removed with little inconvenience. If the glans be<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0175.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0169"/>
much inflamed and excoriated, care ſhould be taken to inſert lint ſpread with emollient ointment between the glans and prepuce, otherwiſe troubleſome adheſions are apt to enſue. It is evident, that when this diſeaſe is of the venereal kind, the ſore will not readily heal till the poiſon be eradicated from the constitution.</p><p>In ſome caſes of phymoſis the preputium is ſo remarkably long, and the contraction ſo much confined to the point, that a circular inciſion is preferable to a longitudinal one ; and it is easily effected, by ſeparating ſuch a portion as may be found necessary of the whole circumference of the prepuce. The dreſſings in this caſe are the ſame as when the prepuce is slit open.</p><p>Paraphymoſis is the reverſe of phymoſis, being formed by a retraction of the prepuce, producing ſtricture behind the glans of the penis. Like the former diſeaſe, it ariſes moſt frequently from a venereal infection, but may be produced from whatever preternaturally enlarges the glans or conſtricts the prepuce.</p><p>In the incipient ſtate, the patient may generally be relieved by the ſurgeon puſhing the glans gently back with his thumbs, while with his fingers he brings the prepuce gradually forward. But a more effectual method than this is to incloſe the glans with one of the hands, and preſs gently on all ſides, by which the fluids forming the enlargement will be puſhed into the body of the penis behind the ſtricture. If this method be perſevered in for a conſiderable time, it will generally be found to anſwer the purpoſe : but ſhould it prove ineffectual, we may try the effects of cold applications ; and the beſt ſeem to be thoſe of the ſaturnine kind. When the penis is evidently much ſwelled and inflamed, the patient ſhould be kept cool, gentle laxatives and low diet ſhould be preſcribed, and a number of leeches applied to the penis. Should the diſeaſe ſtill continue to increaſe, and an œdematous ſwelling appear about the under part of the prepuce, an operation is necessary to prevent a mortification from taking place in the glans. An inciſion is to be made on each ſide of the penis immediately behind the glans, ſo large as completely to divide the ſtricture. The wound ought to be allowed to blood freely; after which a pledget ſpread with ſimple ointment is to be applied, and an emollient poultice laid over the whole.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of an Incomplete Urethra.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> children, eſpecially males, the urethra is ſometimes incomplete, ending before it reaches the uſual place of termination. Sometimes it does ſo without any external opening, at other times it opens at a diſtance from the common termination. In the first caſe, a small trocar is to be introduced in the direction the urethra ought to take, till the urine be diſcharged ; after which, the paſſage is to be kept open by the uſe of bougies, till the ſides be rendered callous and an opening preſerved. In the other caſe, as the opening which is already found affords a temporary paſſage for the urine, it will be better to delay doing any operation till the patient be farther advanced in life, when it is to be performed as in the former caſe.</p><p>After the operation, a piece of flexible catheter may be introduced, as well for the purpoſe of rendering the paſſage free and callous, as for carrying off the water till a cure is made.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputating the Penis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> operation is found necessary in certain diſeaſes which will not yield to other remedies ; as in caſes of mortification and cancer. The following is the method of performing it :</p><p>A circular inciſion is first to be made through the sound ſkin a little bevond the diſeaſed parts; the skin is then to be drawn back by an aſſiſtant, and the body of the penis divided by one ſtroke of the knife (fig. 99.) immediately at the edge of the retracted ſkin. The principal arteries, which are two or three on each ſide, are next to be ſecured by ligatures ; and if an oozing of blood ſtill continue, the ſurface of the ſore ought to be dusted with ſome styptic powder. To allow the patient to make water, a ſilver canula (fig. 99. <hi rend="italic">a)</hi> is to be introduced into the urethra, and retained there by two ſmall ligatures fixed to the ſide of the canula, their other extremities being faſtened to a bandage put round the body. The wound is to be dressed with ſoft lint, kept in its place by a piece of linen previouſly perforated for the introduction of the canula. The dreſſings are to be kept on by a narrow roller passed a few times, round the penis, which, by gently compreſſing the penis upon the inſtrument, will effectually prevent any farther diſcharge of blood. The after treatment of the ſore ſhould be ſimilar to wounds in other parts of the body. But it will not be necessary to make any farther compreſſion of the penis upon the canula, as the diſcharge of blood will, previous to this time, be entirely ſtopped. The tube is to be allowed to remain in the urethra during the whole time of the cure.</p><p>Before any operation of this kind is attempted, the ſurgeon ought to examine attentively, whether the diſeaſe be in the penis itſelf, or only in the skin, as the prepuce, alone is frequently ſo much enlarged and otherwiſe diſeaſed as to give cauſe for ſuſpicion that the glans and body of the penis are likewiſe affected. This precaution is the more necessary, as ſeveral instances have occurred where the glans and body of the penis have been removed, and, after the operation, have been found perfectly ſound. Previous to amputation, therefore, where there is any cauſe for ſuſpicion, the prepuce ſhould be slit open, and the glans examined, ſo as to avoid amputating more than what is abſolutely diſeaſed.</p><p>It ſometimes happens that the frænum of the penis is ſo ſhort as to give considerable uneaſineſs in time of an erection. When this is the caſe, it may be ſafely divided by a pair of ſcissars, or by a ſharp-pointed biſtoury, and the wound dressed with a little charpie.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of Fistula in Perinaeο.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> term implies a ſinuous ulcer in the perinæum, commonly communicating with the urethra, but ſometimes opening into the bladder. Thc ſame term is alſo applied to ſimilar sores opening into the ſcrotum, or into any part of the penis.</p><p>The diſeaſe may ariſe from wounds in the bladder, and of the urethra, from external violence ; from a laceration of parts when performing the operation of lithotomy ; ſrom inciſion into the urethra for the extraction of calculi impacted there ; from ſinuſes producing matter capable of corroding the membranous part of the urethra ; from ſuppuration in the perinæum in conſequence of inflammation ; from the urine paſſing through an opening in the urethra into the perinseum or other neighbouring parts, and rendering the edges of the ſore callous ; and most frequently the diſeaſe is occaſioned by venereal complaints.</p><p>In the treatment of this diſeaſe, when it is the conſequence of a general affection of the ſystem, a removal of the primary diſorder is necessary before a cure can be attempted. When the complaint is of a local nature, a ſimple inciſion into the ſinus is all that is necessary ; and for this purpoſe &amp; ſtaff is to be introduced into the urethra, ſo as to paſs the opening at which the urine, is diſcharged.

the sore till it reach the staff; and cutting upon it, the ſinns is to be laid open through its whole length till it terminate either in the urethra, or, if necesſary, in the bladder itſelf. When more openings than one are preſent, they are to be treated in the ſame manner ; and if the ſinuſes are found to be remarkably hard, the removal of a ſmall portion of the diſeaſed part will expedite the cure, though the conſequent inflammation and ſuppuration will render this ſeldom neceſsary. After the operation, the wound is to be dressed with pledgets of emollient ointment, ſo as to allow it to fill up completely from its bottom. The whole is to be covered with a pledget of emollient ointment; and proper compreſſes being applied over it, the dreſſings are to be ſupported by a T bandage.</p><p>If ſymptoms of inflammation be violent, an emollient poultice is to be applied in the courſe of twenty-four hours after the operation ; and as ſoon as free ſuppuration is formed, light eaſy dreſſings are to be uſed till the ſore is completely healed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXX. <hi rend="italic">Diſeaſes about the Anus.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> I. <hi rend="italic">Of Hemorrhoids or Piles.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> treatment of piles has been already conſidered under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine ;</hi> but it ſometimes happens, that although the means mentioned there have been employed, the diſeaſe becomes ſo violent as to require the aſſiſtance of the surgeon.

When piles arrive at ſuch a ſize as to obſtruct the paſſage of the faeces, or to produce great irritation, the removal of them by the knife or by ligature becomes necessary.

Sometimes they are only one or two in number, but commonly all the ſkin about the anus becomes covered with them. They vary in ſize from that of ordinary warts to that of ſplit garden beans. They ſeem originally to be productions of the ſkin, though at laſt they ſometimes proceed as deep as the muſcles. They frequently remain long without producing much uneaſineſs.

" When it opens externally, and has likewiſe a communication with the gut, it is termed a <hi rend="italic">complete fistula ;</hi> but if it has no communication with the rectum it is called <hi rend="italic">incomplete.</hi> When the ulcer communicates with the gut, but has no external opening, it is named an <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">occult fistula.</hi> It is likewise diſtinguiſhed into ſimple and compound. The firſt is where one or more ſinuſes communicate with the internal ulcer, but where the parts in the neighbourhood are sound. The compound fiſtula is where the parts through which the ſinus runs are hard and ſwelled, or where the ulcer communicates with the bladder, vagina, os ſacrum, and other contiguous parts.</p><p>The cauſes producing the diſeaſe may be, whatever tends to form matter about the anus, piles, condylomatous tumors, hardened feces, or any cauſe which produces irritation and inflammation, ſo as to end in ſuppuration. As ſoon as a ſwelling about the anus appears to terminate in ſuppuration, every thing ought to be done which can accelerate the formation of matter. A proper degree of heat, warm poultices, fomentations, and the steams of warm water, are the means beſt suited for this purpoſe ; and as ſoon as matter is formed, it ought to be diſcharged by a free incision in the loweſt part of the tumor. Much depends upon the proper treatment here ; for if the opening be made too small, or if long delayed, the matter gets into the looſe cellular ſubstance, and inſtead of producing one, produces many ſinuſes, and theſe ſometimes running to a great depth. The parts ought then to be covered with ſoft lint ſpread with mild ointment, and an emollient poultice kept conſtantly over the whole. By this any remaining hardneſs. will be removed, the cavity will fill up like impoſthumous tumors in other parts, and a complete cure will in general ſoon be made.</p><p>It more frequently happens, however, that the practitioner is not called in till the abſcefs has burſt of itſelf, and till matter has insinuated into the ſurrounding cellular ſubstance, and formed one or more real fistulæ.</p><p>The firſt thing to be done now is to diſcover the real courſe of the different ſinuſes, and the probe is the beſt inſtrument for this purpoſe. If there be openings in the external ſurface, there is commonly little difficulty in this. If they run along the perinæum or the muſcles, the probe will generally detect them. If they follow the direction of the gut, the beſt method is to introduce the fore finger oiled into the rectum, while the probe is entered at the external orifice. If there be a communication between the gut and the ſinus, the probe may be made to paſs till its point is felt by the finger in the rectum. We diſcover with certainty if a ſinus communicate with the gut, when air or feces are diſcharged, or when any mild fluid injected returns by the anus.</p><p>After the courſe of the ſinus has been diſcovered, the method of cure is next to be conſidered. Astringent or eſcharotic injections, preſſure, and ſetons, are inſupportable, on account of the violent pain which they produce. The only method therefore of bringing on a proper degree of inflammation is a free inciſion along the whole courſe of the ſinus. The courſe of the different ſinuſes having been previouſly diſcovered, a laxative ought to be given on the day preceding this operation, and a clyſter an hour or two before performing it. The patient is to be placed with his<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0177.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0171"/>
back towards a window, while his body leans upon a bed, table, or chair. The finger of the ſurgeon is to be rubbed over with oil, and introduced into the rectum. The end of a crooked probe-pointed biſtoury (fig. 100.) is then to be paſſed into the fiſtula, and puſhed againſt the finger in the rectum, if the ſiſtula be complete. But in caſes of incomplete fistulae, the point of the inſtrument muſt be made to perforate the gut before it can reach the finger. Some make the perforation with a ſharp-pointed biſtoury, which can be made to flip along the side of a probe-pointed one, as at fig. 101. After the biſtoury has reached the cavity of the rectum, the point of it is then to be brought out at the anus, and a cut made downwards to lay the ſinue completely open. In this operation the ſphincter ani muſcle is commonly cut, if the ſinus be high ; but no inconvenience is found to ariſe from this circumſtance. It ſometimes, though rarely, happens, that the ſinus goes beyond the reach of the finger, and even as high as the upper end of the sacrum. The only thing which can be done in this caſe is to cut as high as the finger can go, ſo as to give a free and eaſy vent to the matter.</p><p>Some practitioners, with a view to prevent troubleſome hemorrhagies, and others to free the patient from the dread of the knife, have propoſed to open the ſinuſes by means of ligature (fig. 102.). By introducing one end of a piece of silver or leaden wire into the ſinus, then bringing it out at the anus, and twiſting the ends together, the contained parts may be ſo compreſſed as to produce a complete diviſion of them. But this is both more painful and tedious than the ſcalpel, and appears to be by no means neceſſary.</p><p>When the preſence of an occult fiſtula is ſuspected, its exiſtence ought first to be fully aſcertained, by examining whether the matter which is paſſed by ſtool proceeds from an ulcer in the bowels or from an abſceſs at the side of the anus. It is diſcovered by matter from the bowels being mixed with the feces, and no pain about the anus. In occult ſiſtula, a hardness, ſwelling, and diſcoloration, are obſerved upon ſome ſpot near the anus, and there is a ſenſation of conſiderable pain upon preſſure being made upon it. The operation in this is the same with that in the other two varieties of the diſorder ; only that an opening is previouſly to be made, by a lancet or ſcalpel, in that ſpot where the matter appears to be lodged. By this the lore will be reduced to a complete ſiſtula, and the reſt of the operation will be eaſily performed.</p><p>In this manner the different ſinuſes are to be operated upon, when in a ſimple ſtate ; but in thoſe of a compound nature, where the parts in the vicinity of the ſores have been ſeparated from each other by an effuſion of matter into the cellular ſubſtance, and where all the under end of the rectum has, in ſome rare caſes, been attached from the surrounding parts, two modes of operating have been recommended ; either to remove a conſiderable portion of the external integuments, ſo as to give free vent to the matter ;or to extirpate all the lower end of the rectum which is found to be detached from the surrounding parts. But from the pain and ſubſequent diſtreſs which they occaſion, theſe methods are judiciouſly laid aſide. All that is neceſsary to be done here is to lay the detached portion of gut completely open, as in caſes of ſimple fistulae ; but if this be inſufficient for allowing the gut to apply properly to the contiguous parts, another inciſion ſhould be made on the oppoſite side. If the neighbouring bones be ſound found, and the conſtitution in other reſpects be unimpaired, a complete cure will probably be obtained.</p><p>The matter ſometimes inſinuates itſelf between the ſkin and muſcles of the perinæum, or of the hip. When this is obſerved, the ſac produced by it ſhould be laid open from one end to the other by one or more inciſions as circumſtances may require. Sometimes, from neglect or improper treatment, the matter collected does not find a proper outlet, and then the parts moſt contiguous to it inflame, become painful, and gradually acquire ſuch a morbid calloſity as to put on a ſcirrhous appearance. In ſuch caſes a cure may be effected by giving free vent to the matter, preventing every future collection, and inducing and preſerving a ſuppuration in the ſubſtance of the parts chiefly affected. To accompliſh this last circumſtance, however, it may ſometimes be neceſſary not only to lay the ſinuſes freely open, but to cut in upon the obdurated parts.</p><p>The different ſinuſes having been laid open, care muſt be taken to apply the neceſſary dressings. Upon this much of the ſucceſs attending the operation depends. Dry lint, till lately, was much uſed by practitioners ; but it has been found to produce ſo much irritation, eſpecially when too much crammed in, as to be one of the cauſes of that diarrhoea which is frequently ſo troubleſome after operations of this kind. Inſtead, therefore, of this sort of dressing, pledgets, lint, or ſoft old linen ſpread with any simple ointment, are to be preferred. After the sores have been cleared from clotted blood, the pledgets are to be gently inſinuated between their edges, but not to ſuch a depth, or with ſuch force, as to give any uneaſineſs. This being done, and a compreſs of ſoft linen with a T bandage being applied over the whole, the patient is to be carried to bed ; and the dreſſings being renewed, either after every stool, or, when theſe are not frequent, once in the twenty four hours, the sores will generally fill up from the bottom, and will at laſt cicatrize in the same manner as wounds in any other part of the body. Sometimes, however, they acquire a soft, flabby, unhealthy aspect, and the matter diſcharged from them is thin, fetid, and occaſionally mixed with blood. Theſe appearances may ſometimes ariſe from some part of a ſinus having been overlooked. In this caſe advantage may follow from the part being laid completely open. But it more uſually proceeds from ſome affection of the general ſyſtem ; and till this is eradicated the sores cannot be expected to heal.</p><p>In the cure of sores in other parts oſ the body, practitioners have ſometimes found great advantage to ariſe from the uſe of issues. The ſame thing is now found to be applicable here. Wherever therefore fistulæ are of long ſtanding, while any diſorder exiſting in the conſtitution is properly attended to, practitioners recommend, that an iſſue, in proportion to the quantity of the matter diſcharged by the sores, ſhould be immediately employed.

In ſome cases, the end of the rectum protrudes at the uſual ſituation of the anus, and is only covered with the common integuments ; but in others, no termination of that gut is diſcoverable. Sometimes the rectum ends within an inch of the uſual seat of the anus ; at others, it reaches no farther than the top of the ſacrum. In ſome caſes it terminates in the bladder ; in others, in the vagina. In the moſt favourable caſes, where the rectum protrudes, an opening may he readily made by a ſcalpel or lancet ; but when no direction of this kind is met with, an inciſion is then to be made in the place where the anus is uſually ſituated, and is to be continued in the direction of the os coccygis and ſacrum, which is the courſe the inteſtine commonly takes. The finger is to be uſed as a director along it ; the parts are to be cut either till faeces are obſerved, or till the inciſion has been made the length of the finger. If ſtill the faeces do not appear, a lancet-pointed trocar is to be puſhed forward upon the finger in ſuch a direction as the operator thinks will moſt probably reach the gut. An artificial anus is likewiſe to be attempted, where the gut terminates in the bladder or vagina. After the operation, the greateſt attention is neceſſary to preſerve the opening which has been made.

When the bone is forced entirely out of its cavity, the luxation is termed <hi rend="italic">complete ;</hi> when this is not the caſe, it is <hi rend="italic">partial</hi> or <hi rend="italic">incomplete.</hi> When there is alſo a wound of the ſoft parts communicating with the joint, it is called a <hi rend="italic">compound,</hi> and when there is no wound, a sim <hi rend="italic">ple luxation.</hi></p><p>The common ſymptoms oſ a diſlocated bone are, inability to move the injured limb ; pain, tenſion, deformity in the part affected ; and ſometimes inflammation, ſubſultus tendinum, and fever : and theſe three laſt are greateſt in partial dislocations. The ſwelling which first appears is always inflammatory; but afterwards a ſecondary ſwelling comes on, ſeemingly œdematous, and probably owing to the preſſure of the lymphatics by the diſlocated bone.</p><p>In judging of the practicability of reducing a luxation, we ought to attend to its nature and extent, the other circumſtances with which it may be complicated, and the length of time which it has continued. When a bone is only partially diſlocated, it is evident that it may be reduced with much more eaſe and certainty than where it is completely diſplaced. It is evident alſo that fracture attending diſlocation muſt render reduction much more difficult and uncertain. Indeed, when both the bones forming the joint are broken, there is the greateſt hazard of its remaining ſtiff during life, even when the greateſt attention has been paid. Luxated bones are moſt eaſily reduced immediately after they are diſplaced : the difficulty indeed of reducing them is generally proportional to the time that has intervened ſince the accident happened. When a bone has been ſome time lodged among the contiguous muſcles, it forms a ſocket for itſelf, and is firmly graſped by the furrounding ſoft parts. The cavity, too, from which it was diſlodged may be partially filled with ſome of the ſurrounding ſoft parts, or at leaſt diminiſhed by the constant action of the contiguous muſcles on its cartilaginous brim. Diſſections, however, ſhow, that inſpiſſated ſynovia does not, as was formerly ſuppoſed, fill up this cavity. In delicate conſtitutions and advanced periods of life, when the muſcles give little reſistance, dislocations are more eaſily reduced than in the vigour of youth or in robuſt conſtitutions.</p><p>In the treatment, we ought, 1. To reduce the diſlocation with as much eaſe and expedition as poſſible; 2. Retain the bone in its ſituation till the parts have recovered their tone; and, 3. Obviate all uneaſy ſymptoms.</p><p>1. When the ſurrounding ſkin and muſcles are much contuſed and inflamed, we ſhould endeavour to remove the inflammation by local blooding, ſaturnme applications, and laying the limb in an eaſy posture, before we attempt to reduce the bone, as conſiderable injury may be done by ſtretching a limb while the parts ſurrounding the joint are inflamed. The upper part oſ the limb ſhould be kept ſteady while the ſurgeon endeavours to replace the under bone, which alone is commonly diſplaced. This is not eaſily done; for the contractile power of the muſcles acts ſtrongly againſt every attempt, and not only draws it beyond the contiguous bone againſt which it ſhould be placed, but frequently forces it out of its natural ſituation, and fixes it firmly in ſome neighbouring cavity, from which it is with difficulty removed. To prevent this reſiſtance as much as poſſible, the muſcles ought to be put into a ſtate of relaxation. If this is properly done, the force neceſſary for reducing a luxated bone may generally be obtained from assiſtants alone ; ſometimes, however, machinery is required, and various instruments have been invented for this purpose. Freke’s machine is the moſt generally uſed. The force ought always to be applied in a gradual manner, and to the diſlocated bone alone, and not to any more diſtant parts of the limb. After the end of the diſlocated bone is brought into a line with that to which it<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0179.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0173"/>
is oppoſed, the reduction is eaſily completed either by the action of the muſcles alone, or, if that is not sufficient, by gentle pressure.</p><p>2. After the reduction there is ſeldom any difficulty in retaining the bone in its place, unleſs it has often been diſlocated before. All that is necessary is to place the limb in a relaxed poſture, and to ſupport the bone with a bandage till the parts have recovered their tone.</p><p>3. The moſt urgent ſymptoms which accompany diſlocations are, pain, inflammation, and ſwelling. Theſe uſually abate ſoon after the reduction. If any degree of inflammation remain, the uſe of leeches is the beſt remedy.</p><p>When diſlocated bones are accompanied with fracture near the joint, the fracture muſt be allowed to heal before reduction be attempted. This, however, is not always neceſſary in very ſmall bones, as thoſe of the fingers. When the fracture is at a diſtance from the joint, the diſlocation may generally be reduced immediately. Compound luxations are to be treated nearly as compound fractures. After the bone is replaced, leeches ſhould be applied to abate the inflammation ; after which the ſore ſhould be dressed with Goulard’s cerate, or any other mild ointment, and the pain moderated by opiates and a low regimen: care ought alſo to be taken that no matter lodge about the joint. When luxations are produced by tumors or collections of matter in the neighbourhood of the joints, they may be conſidered as incurable : when they proceed from too great a relaxation of the ligaments and tendons of the joint, the bone can hardly be prevented from being now and then diſplaced ; but the inconvenience may be ſomewhat obviated by ſupporting the limb with a proper bandage, by the uſe of the cold bath, and by electricity.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Luxations of the Bones of the Head and Neck.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">If</hi> the bones of the cranium be ſeparated by external injury, all that can well be done is, to ſupport the parts by a bandage, to prevent inflammation, to keep the patient quiet, and in a proper poſture during the cure. The bones of the noſe are ſeldom luxated without fracture : when they are, the injury is eaſily discovered by the touch. When one of the bones is driven inwards, it may be raised and reduced by puſhing a tube of a proper ſize, and covered with ſoft lint, into the noſtril ; which may be afterwards retained till there is no danger of the bone being again diſplaced. If the bone be luxated outwards, it may be reduced by the fingers, and retained by a double-headed roller. The lower jaw is luxated moſt frequently when the mouth is opened widely ; it can only take place forwards and downwards, which are leaſt surrounded by the neighbouring parts : both sides are generally luxated at once ; and in that case the mouth is opened wide, the chin thrown forwards and towards the breaſt. When only one side is diſlocated, the mouth is diſtorted, and wideſt on the found side of the jaw, which is drawn a little towards the contrary side. The patient ſhould be ſeated, and his head ſupported. The ſurgeon ſhould puſh his thumbs, protected by a covering of ſtrong leather, as far as poſſiible between the jaws, and then with his fingers, applied on the outside of the angle of the jaw, endeavour to bring it forward till it move a little from its ſituation. He ſhould then preſs it forcibly down, and the condyles will immediately slip into their place. The thumbs ought to be inſtantly withdrawn, as the patient is apt to bite them involuntarily. The patient ſhould for ſome time avoid much speaking or opening his mouth wide.</p><p>When the head is luxated, it commonly falls forward on the breaſt, the patient is inſtantly deprived of ſenſe and motion, and ſoon dies if the luxation be not quickly reduced. In reducing the luxation, the patient ſhould be placed on the ground, and ſupported by an aſſiſtant : the ſurgeon ſtanding behind ſhould gradually pull up the head, while the ſhoulders are preſſed down by the aſſiſtant till the bones are brought into their place, which is known by a ſudden crack or noiſe : if the patient be not dead, he immediately recovers his faculties, at leaſt in ſome meaſure. He ſhould then be put to bed with his head elevated and retained in one poſture. He ſhould lose a quantity of blood, and live for ſome time on a low diet.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Luxations of the Spine, Os Coccygis, Clavicle, and Ribs.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> vertebræ are ſometimes partially, but hardly ever completely, diſlocated without fracture. When they occur high up, they are attended with the ſame ſymptoms as diſlocation of the head : when farther down, beſides diſtortion of the ſpine, paralyſis enſues of every part of the body ſituated under the luxated bone ; there is commonly alſo either a total ſuppression of urine, or it is diſcharged involuntarily together with the faeces. As luxations of this kind are generally owing to falls or violent blows, the diſplaced vertebra is driven either forwards or to one side ; it is therefore very difficult to reduce it. The beſt, as well as the simpleſt method, is to lay the patient on his face over a cylindrical body, as a large caſk, and at the ſame time to attempt to replace the bone with the fingers. If the bone be very much diſplaced, there is very little reaſon to hope for ſucceſs. The os coccygis is more liable to diſiocation than any other part of the ſpine. It is ſometimes forced outwards in laborious births. This is diſcovered by the great pain which is felt at the connection of the os coccygis with the ſacrum, and by the bone appearing to be diſplaced when examined. It may generally be eaſily reduced by preſſute with the fingers. The beſt ſupport afterwards is a compress, with the T bandage. When the coccyx is luxated inwardly, the patient complains of ſevere pain, teneſmus, and a ſenſe of fulneſs in the rectum ; the faeces are passed with difficulty, and in ſome caſes a ſuppression of urine takes place. The injury is eaſily diſcovered by introducing the finger into the anus. In this caſe the bone ſhould be preſſed outwards, by introducing the sore and middle fingers of one hand dipped in oil into the rectum, and ſupporting the parts which correſpond with it externally till the reduction is accompliſhed. Diſlocations of theſe bones are apt to excite inflammation, which often terminates in dangerous abſceſses ; it ought therefore to be guarded against by every means in our power.</p><p>The clavicle is moſt frequently luxated at its junction with the ſternum ; becauſe the violence which produces the injury is generally applied to the ſhoulder. The luxation is diſcovered by pain in the part, by the projection of the bone, and by the immobility of the ſhoulder. It is eaſily reduced by puſhing the bone into its place with the fingers, while an aſſiſtant draws back the arms and ſhoulders. It is not ſo eaſy to retain the bone in its place. When it is the inner extremity of the clavicle which has been diſlocated, the ſhoulder ſhould be kept in its natural ſituation, neither raised nor depreſſed : the fore-arm ſhould be ſupported, as ſhould alſo the head and ſhoulders, and a moderate preſſure ſhould be made upon the diſplaced end of the bone. For this purpoſe the machine represented fig. 104. the invention of Mr Park of Liverpool, anſwers beſt. But when the outer extremity of the clavicle has been diſlocated, the ſhoulder muſt be considerably raised, the arm ſupported in a ſling, and the bone kept in its proper ſituation by a ſmall compreſs placed over its end, and ſecured by a roller forming the figure 8 ; or it may be retained by the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0180.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0174"/>
machine above mentioned. The bandage ought to be retained for a conſiderable time.</p><p>Luxations of the ribs are exceedingly rare. The ſymptoms are nearly the ſame with thoſe ariſing from fracture, only that the pain is more ſevere at the articulation, and that no other ſpot but that will yield to pressure. All that can be done is to bend the body forward over a caſk or ſome ſuch body, in order to aſſiſt the viſcera in preſſing out the rib. Bandages are of little uſe. The patient ſhould be kept quiet, and fed on a low diet : inflammation ſhould be prevented, and opiates given if he has a troubleſome cough.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Luxation of the Bones of the Superior Extremities.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> head of the os humeri is moſt frequently diſlocated forwards and downwards, sometimes downwards and backwards, but never upwards without a fracture of that part of the ſcapula which is placed above the joint. The luxation is diſcovered by the patient’s inability to raiſe his arm, by violent pain attending the attempt, by the luxated arm being of a different length from the other, by the head of the humerus being felt out of its natural ſituation, while a vacuity is perceived under the acromion, and by the flatneſs of the injured joint, while the sound one has its natural fulneſs. When the luxation is of long ſtanding, the whole arm is apt to become oedematous.</p><p>The patient ſhould be ſeated on a chair, and his body ſecured by a broad belt paſſed round it, and held by aſſiſtants. The elbow ſhould be bent, in order to relax the muscles on the fore part of the luxated joint. A firm leather belt four or five inches broad, with ſtrong ſtraps, and lined with flannel, is to be tied round the arm immediately above the elbow : aſſiſtants are to extend the arm gradually, by pulling theſe ſtraps, while another aſſiſtant draws back the ſcapula. The ſurgeon ſtands on the outside of the arm, directs the aſſiſtants, and varies the direction of the extenſion, according to the ſituation of the head of the bone. As ſoon as the head of the bone has cleared the brim of the socket, the muſcles draw it into its place, a crack is heard, the patient is relieved, and the anterior part of the ſhoulder acquires its uſual fulneſs.</p><p>Various other methods of extending the arm have been propoſed in difficult caſes; as, ſuſpending the patient by the luxated arm over the ſtep of a ladder or the top of a door, raising him up by the arm with ropes running over pulleys fixed in the ceiling of a room, &amp;c. The jerk produced by the body being ſuddenly raiſed and let down again on a feather bed, has ſometimes ſucceeded when other means have failed. A gentler method is to lay the patient on the floor, while two or three stout men ſtanding on a table lay hold of him by the arm and pull him up. But all theſe methods are in danger of lacerating the ſoft parts by the ſuddenneſs with which the force is applied, and even ſometimes of breaking the end of the humerus if it be preſſed againſt the neck of the ſcapula. Mr Freke’s improvement on the ambé of Hippocrates has been conſidered as the beſt machine for extending the arm. But machinery is very ſeldom necessary; even cases of long ſtanding may by proper management be reduced by means of assistants, provided reduction be at all practicable. Inflammation after the operation ſhould be obviated by the uſual remedies. If the bone be apt to ſtep out again, which ſometimes happens after repeated dislocations, the arm ſhould be ſupported in a sling till the parts have recovered their tone. Bliſters, friction, stimulating medicines applied to the ſhoulder, and cold water poured on it, have ſometimes been uſeful in reſtoring the ſtrength of the joint.</p><p>Luxations at the elbow moſt commonly happen upwards and backwards ; and then the fore-arm is shortened, the end of the ulna projects behind, and is higher than usual, while the extremity of the humerus can be felt in the bend of the elbow. The ſurgeon ſhould take hold of the wriſt with one hand, and the upper part of the forearm (which is to be moderately bent) with the other, and gradually pull the top of the fore-arm downwards, while at the ſame time he increaſes the curvature of the elbow to diſengage the ends of the bones from each other. He ſhould then pull the bones forward into their ſituation. When the luxation happens upwards and forwards, it ſhould be reduced while the arm is extended. After the reduction, the muſcles of the fore-arm ſhould be kept relaxed by bending the elbow a little till the parts have recovered their tone. When the bones of the fore-arm are diſlocated from each other, which happens moſt frequently at the wriſt, the rotatory motion of the hand is deſtroyed. After the reduction, the bones ſhould be bound together by a tight flannel roller, or a couple of ſplints ſhould be applied along the fore-arm, and the arm ſupported in a sling.</p><p>The bones of the wriſt are not ſo often luxated as might be expected from the ſmallneſs of their ſize. When they are, great ſwelling and pain enſues, and the motion of the joint is entirely deſtroyed. Great attention is necessary, leſt luxation ſhould be mistaken for a ſprain. The arm and hand ſhould be ſupported by aſſiſtants, but not ſtretched ; and then the bones ſhould be puſhed into their place, and afterwards retained by proper bandages and ſplints. The bones of the metacarpus, when they happen to be diſlocated, which is very ſeldom, are to be reduced in the same manner. Diſlocations of the thumb or fingers are eaſily diſcovered. To reduce them, an aſſiſtant ſhould hold the phalanx from which the dislocation happened, while the ſurgeon endeavours to elevate the bone from the one contiguous to it, and to paſs it into its place.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Luxations of the Bones of the inferior Extremities.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">From</hi> the great ſtrength of the hip joint, it was formerly believed that the head of the thigh-bone was never luxated by external violence ; but it is now known that it happens by no means unfrequently. The ball in ſtarting from its ſocket gencrally passes forwards and downwards into the foramen thyroideum. When this happens, the limb is conſiderably lengthened, the head of the bone is lodged near the under and fore part of the pelvis, the large trochanter is obſerved on the fore part of the thigh, a vacancy is perceived where the head of the bone and the trochanter ſhould be, and the toes are turned outwards. When the bone is diſlocated upwards and backwards, the limb is ſhortened, the great trochanter higher than uſual, the knee and foot turned inwards. When it is diſlocated upwards and forwards, the leg is ſhortened, the ball of the bone is felt on the os pubis in the groin, and the great trochanter on the upper and lower part of the thigh ; a vacancy is diſcovered in the correſponding part of the hip; the knee and toes are turned outwards. When the ball slips downwards and backwards, the leg is lengthened, the toes turned inwards, and the great trochanter is lower than that of the other limb. If the ball slip directly downwards, the leg is lengthened, but the knee and toes keep nearly their natural ſituation. It is ſometimes difficult to diſtinguiſh between luxation and fracture of the neck of the bone. In fractures the bone is moſt frequently puſhed upwards, and the leg ſhortened, the knee and point of the toes are turned inwards, and may be moved much more readily outwards and inwards than when the bone is diſlocated.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0181.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0175"/>
For reduction, the patient ſhould be laid on a mattreſs on the ſound side, and a wooden roller covered with ſeveral folds of flannel placed between his thighs, and fixed firmly by ſtraps to the wall. A ſtrong bandage of buff leather, or ſomething ſimilar, ſhould be applied to the under end of the thigh, with ſtraps fixed to it to make the extenſion. The trunk of the body ſhould be properly ſecured, and the joint of the knee bent. The extenſion ſhould be made at firſt gently, and increaſed gradually, while, at the ſame time, the thigh is made to roll in different directions. When the extenſion is sufficient, two aſſiſtants ſhould lay hold of the roller, and attempt to raiſe the bone ; the extending force ſhould then be ſlackened, and the ſurgeon ſhould puſh the head of the bone upwards and outwards, while an aſſiſtant preſſes the knee forcibly inwards. The muſcles themſelves will then commonly bring the bone into its place; and this is done with ſuch a jerk and noiſe, that it is heard by the byſtanders. If the reduction be not obtained, the extenſion muſt be repeated with greater force. Inſtead of the roller a broad ſtrap or table cloth is frequently uſed. The limb ſhould not be uſed for ſome time after reduction, and inflammation ſhould be prevented by the proper remedies.</p><p>The patella can neither be luxated upwards or downwards, without rupture of the tendons of the extenſors muſcles, or of the ſtrong ligament which fixes it to the tibia ; but it may be luxated to either side. The luxation produces lameneſs, and much pain on attempting to move the joint. In recent caſes the injury is eaſily diſcovered ; but when the ſurgeon is not called immediately, the ſwelling may be ſo great as to render it more difficult. For reduction, the limb ſhould be kept extended ; the ſurgeon, by depreſſing the edge of the patella most diſtant from the joint, is enabled to raiſe the other, and puſh the bone into its place.</p><p>It may be necessary to remain a day or two in bed till the knee recover its tone. Sometimes, after the bone has been displaced, returns of the ſame complaint become frequent. In ſuch caſes, proper machinery applied to the side of the tumor, where the bone is apt to ſtart out, is uſed with advantage.</p><p>From the ſize of the joint, and the great ſtrength of the ligaments, luxations of the tibia from the os femoris rarely occur. When it does, it is eaſily diſcovered by the pain, lameneſs, and deformity of the limb. The patient ſhould be laid on a table, the muſcles relaxed, and the thigh ſecured by aſſiſtants ; the limb ſhould then be extended, and the bones cleared of each other, when they will be eaſily replaced. After the reduction, the limb ſhould remain for ſome time perfectly at reſt ; and inflammation, which is very apt to enſue, and is attended with very bad conſequences, ſhould be aſſiduouſly guarded againſt.</p><p>If the ankle joint be diſlocated forwards, the fore part of the foot is lengthened ; if backwards, the foot is ſhortened and the heel lengthened (this is the moſt common variety) ; if to either side, there is an uncommon vacancy on the one side, and a prominency on the other. Diſlocation, however, can hardly take place outwardly without fracture of the end of the fibula.</p><p>For reduction, the limb ſhould be firmly held by aſſiſtants, the muſcles relaxed, and extenſion made till the bones are cleared of each other, when the aſtragulus will eaſily slip into its place.—The ſame rules ſhould be obſerved in reducing diſlocations of the bones of the foot. Luxations of the metatarſal bones and toes are reduced exactly in the ſame manner as the bones of the metacarpus and fingers.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXΠ. <hi rend="italic">Of Fractures.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> 1. <hi rend="italic">Of Fractures in general.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> <hi rend="italic">term fracture</hi> is generally confined to ſuch diviſions in bones as are produced by external injury.

A grating noiſe when the part is handled, diſtortion, and a certain degree of loſs of power in the injured part, accompany almoſt every fracture, except when it runs longitudinally, and the divided parts are not completely ſeparated from each other. When there is only a single bone in a limb, a fracture is eaſily detected ; but where only one of two bones of a limb has ſuffered, it is often difficult to judge with certainty, eſpecially if the contiguous ſoft parts be tenſe and painful before the practitioner is called. In that case, the opinion muſt be regulated, not only by the attendant symptoms, but, lſt, By the age and habit of the patient ; for bones are more eaſily fractured in old than in young perſons. Different diseases, too, induce brittleneſs of the bones, as the lues venerea and ſea-ſcurvy. 2d, By the ſituation of the part ; for bones are more apt to be fractured in the ſolid parts of their bodies than towards their extremities, where they are more ſoft and pliant. 3d, By the poſture of the limb ; for a weight may fracture a bone lying on an unequal ſurface, which it would have ſuſtained without injury if equally ſupported. Fractures are ſometimes attended with a great degree of echymoſis, occaſioned by the ends of the fractured bones wounding ſome of the contiguous blood-veſſels.</p><p>In giving a prognoſis of fracture, various circumſtances are to be attended to. It is evident that ſmall fractured bones are more eaſily healed than large ones, and that the fracture of the middle of a bone is not near ſo dangerous as near the extremity. A cure is effected much more readily in youth than in old age, and in good conſtitutions than in bad. We ought alſo to attend to the concomitant symptoms, and the injury which the neighbouring parts may have ſuſtained. The more moderate the symptoms, the more favourable our prognoſis may be.</p><p>The treatment of fractures conſiſt of three particulars ; replacement, retention, and obviating bad symptoms.</p><p>1. When bones are fractured directly across the parts, they are often very little moved from their natural ſituation ; but when the fracture is oblique, they are apt to paſs over each other, and to produce much uneaſineſs and deformity ; the contiguous muſcles are severely injured, and the pain is aggravated by the ſlighteſt motion. The ſurgeon ſhould put the limb into the beſt poſture for relaxing all the muſcles connected with it, according to the practice firſt introduced by Mr Pott. If it be properly attended to, the ends of the bones will in general be eaſily replaced. When any difficulty occurs, a ſmall degree of extenſion may be made, taking care to keep the muſcles as relaxed as poſſible. Much attention ſhould be paid to replacing the bones properly, otherwise the limb will remain for ever after diſtorted,</p><p>2. After the bones are replaced, the limb ſhould be laid in the easieſt poſture, and the bones afterwards retained; in their ſituation by proper compreſſes and bandages, not applied too tightly, till the cure be completed. The time necessary for this purpoſe depends on the ſize of the bone, the age and habit of the patient, the ſteadineſs with which the limb has been retained in its place, and the violence of<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0182.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0176"/>

In middle-aged perſons, and under favourable circumstances, a fracture of the thigh bone, or of the bones oſ the leg, may be cured in two months ; of the arm bone, or bones of the fore arm, in six weeks ; of the ribs, clavicles, and bones of the hand, in three weeks. In infancy the cure will take a ſhorter, and in old age a longer, time than this.</p><p>3. In ſimple fractures the inflammatory ſymptoms generally ſubſide in a few days. When they become worſe, which is ſometimes the case, aſtringent applications ſhould be employed. If theſe fail, blood ought to be drawn from the parts affected. This is of ſo much advantage, that it ought never to be omitted where the ſurrounding ſoft parts are much injured. Friction with emollient oils, warm bathing, the uſe of Bath and other ſimilar waters, are alſo of much ſervice. The limb ſometimes puts on a clumſy appearance from an overgrowth of callus. When this tendency appears, ardent ſpirits and other aſtringents are conſidered as uſeful ; ſometimes pressure on the part by a thin plate of lead fixed by a bandage may be advantageous. Many inſtances occur, however, where no remedies prove ſucceſsful: The patient ought therefore to be acquainted beforehand with the probable event, to prevent unpleaſant reflections afterwards.</p><p>Sometimes the ends of the bone remain looſe long after they might have been reunited. This may be owing to ſome conſtitutional diſeaſe, to the bones not being kept ſteadily in contact, to ſome of the ſoft parts getting in between them, or to the bone being broken in different places, and the intermediate fractures being too ſmall to adhere. Pregnancy has alſo been mentioned as a cauſe. By removing theſe obſtructions, a perfect union may in recent caſes be accompliſhed. But where the caſe is of long ſtanding, callus of the bones becomes ſo hard and ſmooth as to move with the eaſe of a joint, ſo that no advantage can be derived from laying them together. In that case, an inciſion ſhould be made through the ſoft parts, and a ſmall portion of the ends of the bone removed with a ſaw. If this be properly performed, nature will ſupply the deficiency. When ſmall pieces of bone remain long looſe, they ſhould be extracted by making an opening. The intervention of muſcles or other ſoft parts is known by the very ſevere pain and tenſion, and by particular motions of the limb cauſing great pain and twitching of the muſcles which move it. The limb ſhould be put into all the variety of ſituation; and if this does not ſucceed, an opening must be made, and the ſoft parts removed. Sometimes in fractures blood-vessels are ruptured by the ſharp spiculæ of the bone : this happens moſt commonly in compound fractures. When the effuſion of blood is great, the part ſwells ſo much that it is neceſſary to lay it open, and to ſecure the divided vessels by a ligature. When the ſwelling is not great, the abſorption of the blood is truſted to nature. When the blood remains long in contact with the fractured bone, it ſometimes prevents the formation of callus ; the perioſteum ſeparates from a conſiderable portion of the bone, and a thin fetid ſanies is diſcharged at the wound. When this happens, no cure can be expected till the parts of the bone deprived of perioſteum have exfoliated, or have been ſeparated by a ſaw.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Fractures of the Bones of the Face.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fractures</hi> of the noſe may impede reſpiration, affect the ſpeech and ſenſe of ſmelling, give rise to polypi and tedious ulcers, and may beſides be dangerous from their vicinity to the brain. When any part of the bones of the noſe has been raiſed above the reſt, it is to be preſſed into its place with the fingers ; if it has been puſhed into the noſtril, it is to be raiſed with the end oſ a ſpatula or other ſimilar inſtrument. If any portion be almoſt entirely separated from the reſt, it ſhould be removed ; but if it adheres with conſiderable firmneſs, it is to be replaced. If the bones, after being replaced, do not remain in their proper ſituation, they are to be retained either by tubes introduced into the noſtrils, or by a double-headed roller, with proper compreſſes as the caſe may require. Inflammation ſhould be prevented by the proper remedies.</p><p>Much care is necessary in replacing the fractured bones of the face, and in dreſſing them, in order to prevent deformity. The dreſſings may be retained by adheſive plaſters. Inflammation, by which the eyes, noſe, or antrum maxillare is apt to be injured, ſhould be prevented. When matter collects in the antrum, it is to be removed by the metthods formerly deſcribed.</p><p>For replacing fractures of the lower jaw, the patient ſhould be ſeated in a proper light, with his head firmly ſecured. The ſurgeon ſhould preſs with one hand on the inside of the bone, while with the other he guards againſt inequalities on the outſide. If a tooth come in the way, it ſhould be extracted ; when any of the others are forced out of their ſockets, they ſhould be replaced, and tied to the neighbouring teeth till they become firm. The fractured parts being kept firm by an aſſiſtant, a thick compreſſs of linen or cotton ſhould be laid over the chin, and made to extend from ear to ear over it ; a four-headed roller ſhould. be applied firm enough to keep the fractured parts in contact. The patient ſhould be kept quiet during the cure, and fed upon ſpoon-meat. The dreſſings ſhould be removed as ſeldom as poſſible. When the fracture is accompanied with an external wound, the parts ſhould be ſupported by an aſſiſtant during the dreſſing of it.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Fractures of the Clavicles, Ribs, Sternum, and Spine.</hi></p><p>A <hi rend="smallcaps">fracture</hi> of the clavicle is eaſily diſcovered by the grating noiſe in the fractured bone upon moving the arm freely, by the ends of the bone yielding to pressure, and by the motion of the humerus being impeded. All that can be done is to raiſe the arm, and ſupport it at a pιroper height, either by a sling, or, which is better, by the leather caſe recommended in caſe of luxation of this bone. By this the fractured parts will be brought together, ſo far at leaſt as to prevent deformity, and render the bone sufficiently ſtrong.</p><p>Fractures of the ribs are diſcovered by pressures with the fingers. The ſymptoms are commonly moderate, and the patient ſoon gets well. In ſome caſes, however, the pain is ſevere, the breathing becomes difficult, attended with cough, and perhaps with ſpitting of blood, and the pulſe is quick, full, and ſometimes oppreſſed. Theſe ſymptoms ariſe from the ribs being beat in on the lungs.</p><p>In the treatment, it is proper in every caſe to discharge ſome blood. If one end of the rib rise, it ought to be repreſſed by moderate pressure ; and to prevent its rising again, a broad leather belt ſhould be applied pretty tight, and continued for ſome weeks. When a portion of the rib is forced inwards, an opening ſhould be made over it with a ſcalpel, and then it ſhould be elevated with the fingers or a forceps. When diſtreſſing ſymptoms proceed from air or blood collected in the cavity of the cheſt, theſe fluids ought to be diſcharged by an operation.</p><p>The ſymptoms of a fractured ſternum are nearly the ſame with those of the ribs. It requires great attention frorm the vicinity of the heart and large blood-vessels. The patient ought to loſe a quantity of blood, and be kept on an anti- phlogiſtic regimen. If the pain, cough, and oppressed breathing, do not yield to theſe remedies, an inciſion ſhould be<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0183.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0177"/>
made on the injured part, and the depressed piece raiſed with a levator. Should this be inſufficient, it may be affected by means of the trepan : this indeed requires the greatest caution, but it may certainly be attended with advantage when the patient’s life is in danger.</p><p>Fractures of the vertebræ generally end fatally. We judge of the existence of fracture there by examining the parts, by the ſeverity of the pain, and by palsy occurring in the parts ſituated below the injured part.</p><p>When any parts of the vertebræ near the integuments are loosie, they may be replaced with the fingers, and retained by proper bandages. When this is impoſſible, ſome of the latest authors think it adviſable to make an inciſion, and raise any portions of the bone which may be depreſſed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. F <hi rend="italic">racture of the Bones of the Superior Extremities.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> ſcapula is ſeldom fractured; when it is, the fracture is eaſily diſcovered by the pain, the immobility of the arm, and by the touch. The parts may be replaced with greater eaſe if the muſcles connected with them be relaxed. They are retained with difficulty. A long roller ſhould be employed for this purpoſe, with which the head and ſhoulders are alsp to be ſupported. The arm ſhould alſo be ſuſpended to relax the muſcles as much as poſſible, and inflammationi particularly guarded against by local bloodings.</p><p>fractures of the humerus are easily diſcovered by the pain, the immobility of the arm, and a grating noiſe on handling the parts. In reducing the fracture, the muſcles ſhould be completely relaxed by bending the arm and raising it to a horizontal posture. Extenſion, if neceſſary, may be made by one aſſiſtant graſping the arm between the fracture; and the ſhoulder, and another between the fracture and the elbow. After the reduction, one ſplint covered with flannel ſhould be laid along the whole outſide, and another along the whole inside of the arm; and then a flannel roller applied ſufficiently tight to ſupport the parts without interrupting the circulation. The arm may either be ſupported in a sling or Mr Park's leather caſe, (fig. 104). The bandages ſhould not be removed or several days, unleſs ſome urgennt symptoms render it neceſſary. In about a week, however, the arm ſhould be examined to ſee whether the bones have been properly ſet.</p><p>When both of the bones of the fore-arm are broken, the fracture is easily diſcovered ; but when only one bone is fractured, eſpecially if it be the radius, the firmneſs of the other renders the difcovery more difficult ; the grating noiſe, however, on moving the bone in different directions, will generally be a sufficient ſymptom that a fracture has taken place. When the fracture happens near the wriſt, particular attention is neccessary in order to prevent a ſtiff joint. In order to replace the parts, the muſcles are to be relaxed by bending the joints of the elbow and wriſt, and the limb extended a little above and below the fracture. After reduction, a ſplint reaching from the elbow to the ends of the fingers is to the applied along the radius, and another along the ulna ; and both are to be ſecured with a roller or twelve tailed bandage. When the ſplints are applied, the palms ſhould be turned towards the breaſt as the moſt convenient poſture. The arm ſhould be hung in a sling. A partial dislocation of the bones of the wriſt ſometimes attends a fracture of the radius, by which a stiff joint, under the beſt practice, is apt to mine, or permanent painful ſwellings of the sore arm. In ſuch caſes, the patient ought to be warned of the danger, that no blame may be afterwards incurred.</p><p>When the olecrarum is fractured, the arm muſt be kept in am extended ſtate during the cure, by applying a ſplint opposite to the joint of the elbow, reaching from the middle of the humerus to the points of the fingers. The arm ſhould be hung by the patient’s side, to which it ſhould be fixed by means of ſtraps. To prevent the conſequences of a ſtiff joint, the dreſſings ſhould be removed about the eighth or tenth day, the fore-arm for ſome time slowly moved backwards and forwards, and the joint rubbed with an emolient oil. By a repetition of this at proper intervals, a ſtiff joint may be prevented.</p><p>Anchyloſis, or ſtiffneſs of the joint, commonly ſucceeds fractures of the bones of the wriſt, owing to the great inflammation which enſues, and to their not readily reuniting from their ſmallneſs. To prevent this as much as poſſible, after replacing the bones, the injured parts ſhould be leeched freely, and in proportion to the violence of the ſymptoms. Splints ſhould be applied exactly as in fractures of the fore-arm, and the arm ſupported by a sling.</p><p>In fractures of the metacarpal bones, a firm ſplint ſhould be applied over the whole palm and inside of the arm, from the points of the fingers to the elbow, in order to prevent the action oſ the flexors of the fingers. The beſt ſplint for a fractured finger is a piece of firm paſteboard properly fitted and ſoftened in water till it can be readily moulded into the form of the part. This ſhould be applied along the whole length of the finger, and ſecured with a narrow roller. At the ſame time, a large roller ſhould be applied over the inside of the hand to prevent the parts from being moved. To prevent ſtiffness, the dreſſings ſhould be removed about the end of the second week, and the joint cautiously bent; and this ſhould be repeated daily till the cure be completed.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Erasures of the Bones of the inferior Extremities.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fractures</hi> of the body of the thigh bone are readily diſcovered by the grating noiſe when the ends of the bones are forcibly rubbed together, by the ſhortness of the limb if the fracture be oblique, and by the limb being unable to ſuſtain the body. But fractures of the neck of the bone are often not easily diſtinguished from dislocation of the joint. In general they may be diſtinguiſhed by the circumſtances mentioned in treating of luxations of this bone. In forming a prognoſis, we ought to conſider that no fractures are more apt to diſappoint our expectations than thoſe of the thigh, eſpecially when the neck of the bone is broken, owing to the difficulty of diſcovering the place of the fracture, and of retaining the bones even after they have been replaced. In order to reduce fractures of the thigh, the muſcles are to be relaxed by moderately bending the joints of the thigh and knee : w hen this is done, unleſs there be much pain and tenſion, the bones are easily replaced by one aſſiſtant holding the upper part of the thigh, while another ſupports and gently pulls down its lower extremity, while the ſurgeon is employed in adjuſting the fractured pieces. It is more difficult to reduce fractures of the neck of the bone, on account of the great ſtrength and various directions of the surrounding muſcles. In general, however, we ſhall succeed by moderate extenſion, if we take care previouſly to relax all the muſcles as much as poſſible ; if we do not ſucceed, we muſt have recourſe to machinery.</p><p>The greateſt difficulty is to retain the bones in their situation after they are replaced. The limb muſt be firmly ſecured by ſplints made of thin slips of wood glued to leather (fig 105. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b),</hi> or of thick paſteboard. One ſplint, broad enough to cover half of the thigh, ſhould reach from the top of the hip joint to a little below the knee, and another, covering about a third part of the thigh, from the groin to a little below the knee. The ſplints ſhould be lined with flannel. They are to be ſecured by a twelve-tailed bandage, and over all a thin pillow ſhould be put nearly as long as<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0184.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0178"/>
the thigh. The ſplints and bandages may be put on in the following manner: The patient being placed on a firm hair mattreſs, with his knee moderately bent, the long ſplint bandage and pillow are to be applied to the outſide of the thigh, and the patient ſhould be turned ſomewhat towards the affected side, with the knee and leg raised a little higher than the body : the ſhort ſplint ſhould then be applied along the inside of the thigh, and the bandage already placed without the other ſplint, applied ſo tight as to make an equal moderate preſſure over the whole : (See fig. 106.). To make the part ſtill more ſecure, it is proper to inſert a long firm ſplint of timber under the middle of the pillow, and to fix it by two broad ſtraps to the upper part of the limb. To prevent the limb from being affected by involuntary ſtartings, the pillow ſhould be fixed to the bed by ſtraps : to keep off the weight of the bed-clothes, a frame with hoops ſhould be placed over the thigh. The parts ſhould be examined after ſome time to see that the bones be not diſplaced. When there is pain, ſwelling, and inflammation, leeches and other remedies ſhould be applied. To render the ſituation of the patient as eaſy as poſſible during the cure, he may be allowed after the second week to turn a little more towards his back, and at the ſame time to extend the joint of the knee in a ſmall degree : after this time a little flexion and extenſion of the limb may be daily repeated to preſerve the uſe of the joint.</p><p>The method here deſcribed generally ſucceeds. Sometimes, however, notwithſtanding all our care, the ends of the bone slip over each other. To prevent the deformity which this occaſions, it has been attempted to make extenſion and counter-extenſion by machines : but the pain and irritation have always been ſo great that little advantage has yet been derived from such means. The invention (fig. 107.) of the late Mr Gooch of Norwich, improved by the late Dr Aitken of Edinburgh, has been recommended as one of the beſt machines for oblique fractures of the thigh. After endeavouring to remove the pain, ſwelling, and inflammation, which are ſometimes ſo great as to preclude the application of the ſimpleſt bandage, this machine may be tried. But if it be found impracticable to uſe it, the cure muſt be conducted in the uſual way with the chance of the fractured pieces overlapping one another, and of courſe the limb being ſomewhat ſhortened.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">patella</hi> is moſt frequently fractured tranſverſely, ſometimes lengthwise, and ſometimes into ſeveral pieces. Fractures of this bone have been ſaid commonly to end in a ſtiff joint ; but this is perhaps moſt frequently owing to the limb being kept too long in an extended poſture. In the treatment of fractures of this bone, the leg ſhould be extended to relax as much as poſſible the soft parts connected with the bone. The patient ſhould be placed on a firm mattreſs, and a ſplint be placed under the limb long enough to reach from the top of the thigh to the under end of the leg, to which the limb ſhould be fixed by a number of ſtraps to keep it in a ſtate of extenſion. The fractured bones are then to be brought together, and ſuch a number of leeches applied to the joint as will remove as much blood as the patient can bear ; and as long as much pain and tenſion continue, ſaturnine and other aſtringents are to be uſed for removing them. When this is accompliſhed, and the parts properly adjuſted, a large pledget of Goulard’s cerate ſhould be laid over the joint, and a hooped frame employed to keep off the bed-clothes. In a longitudinal fracture the parts are eaſily kept together by a common uniting bandage or adheſive plaſter ; but in tranſverſe fractures more force is neceſſary. Various bandages have been employed for drawing the pieces together in ſuch fractures ; one of the beſt of theſe is that repreſented fig. 108. We need not be anxious, however, about bringing the pieces very cloſe together, as a cure may be made though they remain at a conſiderable diſtance. The bandages, unleſs particular ſymptoms occur, ſhould not be removed till the end of the ſecond week ; after which the joint ſhould be cautiouſly bent every ſecond day to prevent stiffness.</p><p>The leg is commonly fractured near the lower end, this being the weakeſt part of the bones. In the treatment of a fractured leg the ſame rules apply which were given for a fractured thigh bone. The muſcles ſhould be relaxed by bending the knee ; but little advantage can be derived from bending the foot, for in proportion as the muſcles behind are relaxed thoſe before are put on the ſtretch : the patient may be therefore allowed to keep the foot in the eaſieſt poſture. The bones are commonly replaced by the gentle extenſion of the upper part of the limb by an aſſiſtant, while another ſupports it at the ankle. The bones being replaced, and the limb laid on its outſide with the knee bent, two ſplints (fig. 109.) are to be applied, long enough to reach from the upper part of the knee to the edge of the ſole, ſo as to prevent the motion both of the knee and ankle. The ſplints are to be retained by a twelve-tailed bandage, as in the caſe of fractured thigh bone. See fig. 106.</p><p>If the patient be either very reſtleſs or troubled with ſpaſmodic affections of the muſcles of the leg, an additional ſplint, ſhaped to the form of the leg, ſhould be applied along the outſide of it, and fixed by a ſtrap at the upper, and another at the under part of the leg. When the patient cannot reſt when lying on either side, he may be placed on his back, and the curved ſtate of the knee ſtill preſerved by raiſing the leg a little above the level of the body on a frame made for the purpoſe. This variety of poſture may like- wiſe be uſed in fractures of the thigh. The patient may from the firſt be laid in this poſture, or he may alternately change from the one to the other. No change of poſture, however, ſhould be allowed for the firſt ten or twelve days. When the fibula only is fractured, it is apt to be conſidered as a ſprain of ſome of the muſcles ; but this ought to be particularly attended to, as the miſtake may be followed by bad conſequences. When both the bones of the leg are broken, the portion next the foot is commonly drawn towards the back part of the leg, ſo that a prominency is produced by the fractured part of the upper portion of the bone ; and this is improperly termed the rising end of the fractured bone. The appearance is entirely produced by the inferior portion falling back. Hence no advantage is derived from preſſure being made on the upper end of the bone : the inferior portion ſhould be raiſed ſo as to bring the parts into contact, and then by proper bandages they ought to be ſupported till they are perfectly united.</p><p>Fractures of the bones of the foot and toes are treated nearly in the ſame manner as fractures of the hand and fingers. Beſides the ſplint which may be neceſſary for the particular part, a large one ſhould be appled over the ſole ; nor ſhould any motion be allowed for a conſiderable time either in the foot or ankle, otherwiſe the bones may be displaced, and a proper cure prevented.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> VI. <hi rend="italic">Of Compound Fractures.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">By</hi> compound fracture is now generally meant a fracture of a bone communicating with an external wound in the integuments. They are much more dangerous than simple fractures. The generality of authors have conſidered amputation as indiſpenſable in cases of compound fractures ; while a few, particularly Mr Bilguer, ſurgeon-general to the armies of the late king of Pruſſia, affirm that it is scarcely ever neceſſary. Both ſeem to have carried matters too far. Some of the lateſt and beſt ſurgeons have recom<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0185.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0179"/>
mended never to amputate immediately in private practice, unleſs when the bones are ſo much ſhattered that they cannot reunite, or the texture of the ſoft parts completely deſtroyed ; becauſe, even if amputation be at laſt necessary, the patient will have a greater chance of recovering than if it had been performed immediately after the accident : for the ſtate of weakneſs to which he is generally reduced render the attendant ſymptoms leſs violent. On the other hand, it has been conſidered as no bad rule in the army or navy, where patients cannot be kept in a proper ſituation, and where sufficient attention cannot be given, to amputate immediately in caſes of compound fractures of the large bones of the extremities. When amputation is not performed immediately, it is not, for ſeveral days at leaſt, admiſſible. It may afterwards be rendered necessary by hemorrhagies, which cannot be stopped but by means more dangerous than amputation itſelf; by extenſive mortification ; or by the ends of the fractured bones remaining long disunited, while a great discharge of matter endangers the patient’s life.</p><p>In treating compound fractures, all extraneous bodies ſhould be removed, as alſo all thoſe ſmall pieces of bone which will probably not unite with the rest. For this purpoſe the opening, if necessary, ſhould be enlarged with a ſcalpel. The next step is to replace the bones by relaxing the muſcles as in ſimple fractures. Sometimes part of a bone projects ſo far through the integuments that it cannot be replaced without either ſawing off the end of it, or enlarging the wound. If the fractured bone be long, ſharp, and projecting much, it is beſt to ſaw it off ; for though it were reduced, it would not readily reunite, and it would be apt to excite much pain and inflammation : But if it be broad at the baſe, and of no great length, it ought certainly to be ſawed, even though it cannot be reduced without enlarging the wound. For the most part, it is only the ſkin which it is necessary to cut ; but even the muſcles ought to be divided, though as much as poſſible in the direction of their fibres, when the bone cannot otherwiſe be replaced. After the reduction, a pledget of ſome emollient ointment is to be laid over the wound, and the limb placed on a firm ſplint, and still kept in a relaxed posture. In dreſſing the wound, the limb ought not to be moved : the manytailed bandage, therefore, ſhould be uſed rather than a roller. Various contrivances have been fallen upon to allow the limb to be at reſt while the ſurgeon is dreſſing it. The fracture box, invented by the late Mr Rae ſurgeon in Edinburgh, is one of the best. When the leg is laid on this, it may be dressed with tolerable facility without moving it. We are happy to have it in our power to announce to the gentlemen of the medical faculty, that another machine has lately been invented by Mr Samuel James ſurgeon in Hoddeſden, Herts, which, we are told, will effectually relax the muscles, and retain the bones in their natural ſituation, without pain to the patient or the leaſt inconvenience to the operator. See fig. 110.</p><p>It is of the greateſt importance to prevent inflammation, which is apt either to produce mortification, or to give riſe to extenſive abſcesses. The dreſſings ſhould be removed once or twice daily according to the quantity of matter. The common application of warm poultices, on account of their inconvenience, may be deferred till they become necessary by the approach of inflammation, which they are to be conſidered as the ſureſt means of preventing by exciting a discharge of matter. Whenever the inflammation subsides, and a free diſcharge of pus is produced, the poultices ought to be laid aside, lest they do harm by relaxing the parts too much, and exciting too copious a diſcharge. The ſore ought then to be dressed with mild astringents, and the patient kept on a nouriſhing diet with tonic medicines. A free paſſage ſhould be given to the matter by putting the limb in a favourable poſture, and by making a counter opening, if necessary, to the moſt depending part. But this may be frequently avoided, by covering the sore with ſoft lint or ſponge to abſorb the matter. If the diſcharge become exceſſive, and cannot be leffened by the means above-mentioned, it will be found to proceed from a portion of looſe bone which has not been earlier noticed, by the removal of which it may be stopt. If, instead of producing matter, the inflammation terminate in gangrene, the danger is still greater than under the most extenſive abſcesses. For the treatment of this, the reader is referred to Chap. III. Sect. 2d.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXIIΓ. <hi rend="italic">Of Distortions.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Distortions</hi> of the bones may ariſe from external injuries, from diſeaſed constitutions, from a morbid state of the bones, or a contracted state of the muſcles, or both ; but the affection is most frequently owing to a weakly, delicate conſtitution, as in rickety or ſcrophulous caſes.</p><p>In the treatment of distortions of the ſpine, particular attention ought to be paid to the cauſe of the diſorder. If it appear to ariſe from the patient continuing too long in any particular posture, every habit of this kind ſhould be guarded against on the first appearance of the diſeaſe. If the patient has turned too much to one ſide, the reverſe of this ſhould be adviſed. He ought to ſleep upon a firm hair mattress, that his body may lie upon an equal ſurface. He ſhould uſe an invigorating diet, the cold bath, bark, and other tonics. By a ſtrict attention to the uſe of theſe remedies the diſeaſe has ſometimes been retarded in its progreſs. Various machines have been invented for removing distortions of the ſpine by pressure ; but conſiderable caution is here required, otherwiſe much injury may ariſe from it. Some advantage, however, in certain caſes, has been derived from the uſe of the common collar (fig. 111.) ; or the stays and machinery adapted to them (fig. 112.), invented in France, and aſterwards brought into uſe in this country by Mr Jones of London, are found to be still better ſuited to this purpoſe.</p><p>The ſame cauſes which produce distortions of the ſpine may likewiſe produce distortions of the limbs. Sometimes the distortion takes place with the original formation of the bones, at other times it occurs in infancy, and now and then at a more advanced period of life. In early infancy the bones are ſo pliable as to be readily affected by the poſtures of the body. When a child is too ſoon allowed to attempt to walk, its legs are apt to become crooked from their inability to ſupport the weight of the body. Certain diſeaſes like- wise, eſpecially rickets, soften the bones ſo much, that they yield to the posture of the body, and to the common action of their muſcles.</p><p>When the distortion of a limb is owing to a curvature in a bone, if the caſe be recent, and eſpecially if it occur in childhood, it may frequently be removed, without much difficulty, by making a gradual but constant preſſure, by the uſe of machinery, on the convex ſide of the limb, till it recover its natural appearance. When the deformity occurs in the leg, a method has been uſed, in ſeveral instances, which is to fix a firm ſplint of iron, lined with leacher, in the ſhoe, on the concave ſide of the leg, the other end of the ſplint to rest against the under end of the thigh; when, if a broad strap or two be applied round the leg and ſplint, an eaſy gradual pressure may be made, and conſiderable advantage derived from it. See fig. 113.</p><p>Along with the curvature above mentioned, it commonly happens that the feet and ankles are affected. When the bones of the leg are bent outward, the fore part of the foot is turned inward, and the inner edge upwards ; and the reverſe, if the leg be bent inward.

tiions <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the feet are generally owing to the curvature of the bones of the leg. By removing the curvature of theſe, the foot will commonly regain its natural situation, and the ſplint above mentioned will for the most part be ſufficient for the purpoſe.

As long ago as the year 1679, it was proposed by Jacob Young, an Engliſh ſurgeon, in a treatiſe intitled <hi rend="italic">Currus Triumphalis ex Terebinthino,</hi> to preſerve a flap of fleſh and ſkin, which was to be folded over the bone, and which, uniting to the parts of the wound after amputation, would effectually cover the bone, and prevent the inconveniences above mentioned. No traces of the ſucceſs of this method, however, can be found till the year 1696 ; when a Latin diſſertation was publiſhed upon it by P. Adrians Verduin, an eminent ſurgeon in Amſterdam. The moſt ſanguine expectations were formed of its ſucceſs ; and it was even thought that the flap would prevent the neccessity of tying up the blood-vessels. However, it does not appear that the method as at that time practiſed either did or could succeed ; and accordingly it was entirely laid aſide ; but it has been lately revived with conſiderabſe improvements.</p><p>Amputation may be rendered neceſſary when a member is ſo much diſeaſed as to be uſeleſs, or when it puts life in danger.</p><p>The cauſes in general rendering this operation neceſſary are, bad compound fractures ; extenſive lacerated and contuſed wounds ; part of the limb being carried off by a cannon ball or otherwiſe, the bones being unequally broken and not properly covered ; extenſive mortification ; white swellings of the joints ; large exoſtoſes ; ulcers attended with extensive caries; cancer or other incurable ulcers; varicose kinds <hi rend="italic">of</hi> tumors ; particular diſtortions of the bones.</p><p>Amputation may alſo be ſometimes necessary from violent hemorrhagies of some principal artery during the cure of a fractured limb, or from ſuch a profuſe diſcharge of matter taking place that the ſtrength of the patient is exhauſted. Lacerated and contused wounds may require amputation, on account of hemorrhagy enſuing which cannot be stopped. Extenſive mortification may take place, and ſuch large quantities of matter be formed, that the patient will be unable to bear up under the diſcharge</p><p>Where part of the limb is carried off, it is neceſſary to amputate higher up, to as to cut the bone, as well as the ſoft parts, in ſuch a manner as may admit of a much speedier and ſafer cure. When mortification occurs, every thing ought to be done for the ſupport of the patient till the diſeaſe be stopped ; the first ſign of which is, the appearance of an inflamed circle between the diſeaſed and ſound parts. As ſoon as the diſeaſed begin to ſeparate from tlne found parts, amputation of the limb ought to be performed, and no time ought now to be lost, loſt the patient ſuffer from the abſorption of putreſcent matter.</p><p>No part of ſurgery is brought to greater perfection than the manner of performing amputation. Before the invention of the tourniquet, and the method of ſecuring the veſels by ligature, the operation was ſeldom undertaken ; and a great proportion of thoſe upon whom it was performed died ſoon after. In the preſent improved method, one death does not happen in twenty, or even thirty caſes. In performing the operation, particular attention is to be paid to the ſpot where the inciſion is to be made ; the quantity of ſkin and cellular ſubſtance neceſſary to be ſaved, ſo as to cover the muſcles and bone completely, without being ſtretched ; cutting the muſcles in ſuch a manner that they nay unite with each other and entirely cover the end of the bone; the prevention of hemorrhagies during the operation ; the tying of the arteries alone, without including the nerves or any of the contiguous parts ; ſecuring the integuments ſo as to prevent them from retracting after the operation ; and a proper ſubſequent treatment of the caſe.</p><p>The following are the general ſteps of the operation : The patient being properly placed, with aſſiſtants to attend, and the apparatus in proper order, the flow of the blood to the limb is to be stopped by the tourniquet (fig. 16. ). The first inciſion is to be made through the ſkin and cellular subſtance by one, or rather by two, ſtrokes of the amputating knife repreſented in fig. 116. Theſe are next to be separated from the muſcles, as far as may appear ſufficient for covering the ſtump. The ſeparated ſkin or flap ſhould be ſtrongly drawn up, or what perhaps anſwers better, turned up all round the limb, leaving this part of the muscles quite bare. The flap is to be kept in this ſituation by an asſiſtant, while the operator makes the next inciſion at tlhe edge of the reflected ſkin, and cuts till he comes to the bone. This inciſion ſhould be begun on the lower side of the limb, that the blood may not prevent the eye from readily following the edge of the knife during the whole cut. The muſeles are now to be separated from the bone as high as may enable them afterwards completely to cover it. The soft parts in general are then to be drawn up by retractors, which may be either of leather, as in fig. 117. or metal, as in fig 118 a and <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> The perioſteum is to be divided at the place where the saw is to be applied ; but no part of the bone is to be denuded of this membrane, which is afterwards to cover the ſtump, otherwiſe trubleſome exfoliations may enſue. At this place the ſaw (fig. 119. ) is to be applied, and the bone divided with long ſteady ſtrokes. In this part of the operation a good deal depends upon the steadiness of the aſſiſtant who holds the limb ; for if it be held too high, the motion of the ſaw will be impeded ; while the bone may be ſplintered if it be not ſufficiently raised. Any points or ſplinters which may be left ſhould be immediately removed with the pincers (fig. 120.). The retractors are now to be laid aſide, and the principal arteries ſeparated from the nerves, and ſecured by the tenaculum (fig. 17.), or forceps (fig. 120. a), and ligatures.</p><p>The tourniquet ſhould next be a little ſlackened, to allow the different branches to be diſcovered : The clotted blood is to be cleared away with a warm sponge. The patient ſhould get ſome warm cordial drink, and all the arterial branches which can be diſcovered ought to be taken up. The ends of the ligatures are then to be cut of ſuch a length as to allow them to hang without the lips of the wound. The muſcles and ſkin are now to be drawn down, and brought<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0187.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0181"/>
into cloſe contact, that the stump may be completely covered. The parts are next to be ſecured by proper bandaging ; and if the operation has been properly performed, the cure wll commonly be made by the firſt intention, and may be completed in the courſe of three or four weeks, and ſometimes in a ſhorter period. This however muſt depend much upon the conſtitution of the patient, as well as the manner of performing the operation.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputating the Arm and Fore-arm.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amputation</hi> of the arm is performed according to the rules already laid down. No more of it ſhould be removed than is diſeaſed ; for the longer the ſtump is, the more uſeful it proves. The tourniquet is to be applied a little above the part where the operation is to be performed : As much of the integuments ſhould be saved as may be perfectly ſufficient for covering the sore. In taking up the artery, after the bone has been divided, the operator ought to be attention ot to include the radial nerve, which may be readily diſccovered and ſeparated, as it lies cloſe upon the fore part of the artery. The fore-arm is to be amputated nearly in the ſame manner as the leg ; only that the ſtump may be covered by amputating with the double incision, without tlne aſſiſtance of a flap, which it is neceſſary to form in the leg.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputating the Thigh.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> performing this operation, the patient ought to be placed upon a table of ordinary height, with the diſeaſed limb supported and ſecured by an aſſiſtant ſeated before him, while other aſſistants take care of the other leg and the arms. The courſe of the blood is to be stopped by applying the tourniquet over the trunk of the femoral artery, near the upper part of the thigh. No more of the thigh ouglnt to be removed than is rendered neceſſary by the diſeaſe, as the more of it is left, the more uſeful it will be to the pattient. An aſſiſtant ſhould graſp the limb with both hands a little above the place where the ſkin is to be divided, and draw it up as far as poſſible ; while the operator, ſtanding on the outſide of the limb, makes a circular inciſion down to the muſcles by one or two ſtrokes of the knife. As much of the integuments is then to be dissected with a ſcalpel from the muſcles as may cover the stump completely ; and this part of the ſkin may either be turned back, or drawn tightly up by an aſſiſtant. The muſcles may then be divided quite acroſs to the bone by the edge of the ſkin, in the common way, or cut obliquely upwards, according to the method of Allanſon, ſo as to lay the bone bare two or three fingers-breadth higher than is done in the common way. The muſcles are next to be ſeparated from the bone with a ſcalpel a little way, that a sufficient quantity may be left for covering the end of it. The rest of the operation is to be performed exactly according to the general rules laid down in the firſt ſection of this chapter. The muſcles and integuments are to be drawn over the end of the bone, and applied closely together, that the ſkin may completely cover the ſtump, and retained in this ſituation by an aſſiſtant till a flannel or cotton roller, according to the ſeason of the year, which has been previouſly fixed round the body, be applied in ſuch a manner as to ſupport and fix them. For which purpoſe it ſhould be passed two or three times, in a circular direction, round the top of the thigh, and ſhould afterwards, with ſpiral turns, be brought down near to the end of the ſtump and faſtened with pins ; and it ſhould not be tighter than may be sufficient to aſſiſt the plasters in preventing retraction.</p><p>The ends of the divided muſcles are now to be laid exactly over the bone; and the edges of the ſkin are to be brought into contact, either ſo as to form a ſtraight longitudinal line, according to the method of Mr B. Bell, &amp;c. ; or they are to be placed horizontally, “that the wound may appear only in a line with the angles at each side,” as adviſed by Allanſon. The ligatures may either hang over the edges of the wound, or be brought to the angles. After the edges of the ſkin are in this manner exactly applied to each other, either a few slips of adhesive plaſter are to be laid acroſs the face of the stump, or two large pieces of adhesive plaſter, with ſeveral pieces of tape fixed to them, are to be applied to the ſurface of the ſkin. The tapes are then to be tied with a running knot immediately over the wound ; by which the parts will be kept ſo cloſely together as to prevent any collection of matter from being formed. The whole ſurface of the stump ſhould next be covered with a large pledget ſpread with an emollient ointment, over which a compreſs of fine tow is to be put, and retained in its place by a broad croſs ſtrap of old linen, paſſing ſome way up the thigh, ſo as to be ſecured by the roller, which is now to be paſſed two or three times round the ſtump ; and the preſſure formed by the croſs ſtrap may afterwards be increased or diminiſhed at pleaſure, by drawing it with more or leſs tightneſs, and fixing it with pins to the roller. While the ſtump is dreſſing, the tourniquet is removed, but replaced again loosely to enable the attendants to check any hemorrhagy which may afterwards enſue.</p><p>The patient is now to be laid to rest, and the limb is to be placed upon a little tow covered with linen, or upon a thin soft pillow ; and to prevent the patient from involuntarily moving the limb, and to guard againft ſpaſmodic ſtartings, which frequently happen after this operation, it may be fixed to the bed by two ſtraps. A baſket or hooped frame ought to be placed over the stump to protect it from the bed-clothes. The patient ſhould immediately get an anodyne draught, which will generally procure ease through the reſt of the day. For this purpoſe, no more light ſhould be let into the room than is merely neceſſary for allowing the attendants to pay attention to the stump. As hemorrhagies ſometimes appear ſeveral hours after the operation, the person who takes the charge of the patient ſhould watch this circumstance with the greateſt attention. If there be only a slight oozing of blood, there is no occaſion for being alarmed ; but whenever it appears to proceed from a large artery, it must be ſecured. The spaſmodic affections which frequently occur after amputation are ſeldom troubleſome, unleſs ſome nerve has been included in ſecuring the arteries ; but when they do appear, laying the limb in the eaſieſt poſture, and giving opiates, are the principal means of procuring relief.</p><p>To prevent inflammation as much as poſſible, the patient is to be kept upon a ſtrict antiphlogiſtic regimen, and his bowels kept open by laxative clyſters, till the inflammatory ſtage is over, which will generally be in a few days. If, notwithstanding this treatment, the stump ſwells, and the patient complain of pain and tightneſs, we ought to endeavour to diſcover from what cauſe the uneaſineſs originates. If it be owing to the straps being too tightly fixed, they muſt be ſlackened. If the ſtump be found much ſwelled, a ſaturnine solution ſhould be applied by means of ſeveral folds of linen ; and if the patient be young and plethoric, he ought to lose a few ounces of blood from the arm ; but if he is weak and emaciated, a different mode of treatment muſt be followed.</p><p>At the end of the third, or fourth day at fartheſt, the ſtump ſhould be examined ; and if it appear ſomewhat open and flaccid, the parts muſt be brought cloſer together and ſecured more firmly. After this time the dreſſings ſhould be renewed every day, or every second day. In about a<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0188.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0182"/>
week after the operation the ligatures may generally be removed with eaſe ; but if they do not ſeparate readily, they may be gently pulled at every dreſſing, when they will, in a ſhort time, be brought away, and the wound will be ſoon healed by the firſt intention. The roller ſhould be cleaned and renewed as often as it is found ſullied ; nor ſhould it be laid entirely aſide till the end of the third or fourth week after the operation, When the roller is removed, we may depend upon the straps or tapes for keeping the parts together till the cure be quite accompliſhed. When the inflammatory ſymptoms are entirely gone, no medicines ought to be given which would debilitate the patient, nor is any thing more necessary than to keep the bowels gently open till a complete cure be made.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputating the Leg.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> leg may be amputated for a diſeaſe in the foot at two different parts ; the one a hand-breadth under the knee, the other a little above the ankle. The former makes a sufficient ſupport for the body to reſt upon an artificial leg ; but the latter does that equally well, and likewiſe preſerves the motions of the knee.</p><p>In performing the operation a little way under the knee, the patient is to be placed and ſecured in the same manner as in operating upon the thigh. The tourniquet is to be placed a little above the knee, with the cuſhion upon the artery in the ham. The ſurgeon places himſelf upon the inside of the leg, and makes a circular inciſion through the integuments down to the muſcles. The place where the inciſion ſhould be made muſt depend upon the length of the limb ; but in general it may be between six and ſeven inches under the top of the tibia in an adult, or far enough down upon the limb to save as much integuments as will cover the ſtump. After the integuments are cut through in the manner already directed, as much of the muſcles are to be divided by the knife as can be done by a circular inciſion ; and the interosseous parts are to be divided by a ſcalpel or catline, (fig. 121.). The retractors are then to be applied, and the bone ſawed off immediately below the inſertion of the tendons of the flexor muſcles. In ſawing, the operator ought to begin upon both bones at the same time, that he may finiſh upon the tibia, lest ſplinters ſhould be formed. The veſſels are next to be ſecured ; the ſoft parts drawn over the bones ; the adhesive plaſters and other bandages applied in the ſame manner as directed for amputating the thigh, only that here the roller need not be applied ſo high as in the former operation. Two or three turns above the knee, however, are necessary to prevent the dreſſings from slipping down.</p><p>In amputating upon the ankle, the operator ſhould fix upon that ſpot which will leave the ſtump of ſuch a length as may be moſt convenient for being fitted with an artificial machine reſembling the other leg. Nine inches from the joint of the knee, in a leg of ordinary length, was found by Mr Wilſon, a late ingenious artificial limb-maker in Edinburgh, to be the beſt part ſuited to this purpoſe, on account of the equal pressure it makes upon the ſurface of the leg, without making any upon the end of the tender ſtump. The operation is performed in the same manner as that a little below the knee.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. <hi rend="italic">Of Amputating at the Joints of the Extremities.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> circumſtances moſt to be attended to in performing amputation at the joints are, firſt to ſtop the circulation by the tourniquet ; or, where that is impracticable, to take up the trunk of the artery by a ligature ; to make a circular inciſion in ſuch a place as may, after the operation is over, be sufficient to cover the wound ; Then a longitudinal inciſion is to be made upon the oppoſite ſides of the limb, extending from the joint to the circular cut, and as deep as the bone, by which two flaps will be formed to cover that part of the joint which remains after the operation is finiſhed. The ligaments of the joint are next to be divided, and the affected limb or part of the limb removed.</p><p>After this part of the operation, it was formerly a frequent practice to ſcrape off the remaining cartilage, to unite the parts more firmly together. But this is now ſound to be unnecessary ; for when the fleſh is applied properly to the bone, if it do not grow to it, the union at leaſt is ſo cloſe that it afterwards gives no inconvenience to the patient.</p><p>Any branches of arteries which may have been cut during the operation are now to be ſecured ; clotted blood is to be removed ; and the muſcles and ſkin are to be brought into cloſe contact with the ends of the ligatures hanging out of the wound. The parts are to be retained by adhesive plaſters, or twiſted future, or both ; and proper bandages applied in ſuch a way that a cure may be made by the firſt intention.</p><p>Amputating the arm at the ſhoulder-joint has always been conſidered as a dangerous as well as a difficult operation. It ſhould never be attempted, when the same purpoſe can be accompliſhed by operating lower down. But caſes occaſionally occur, where the life of the patient cannot, in any other manner, be saved.</p><p>Amputation may become neceſſary here in conſequence of abſceſſes of the joint ; caries of the hurnerus reaching to the joint; compound fractures, eſpecially thoſe from gun- ſhot wounds, extending to the head of the bone ; and of mortification.</p><p>In performing the operation, the patient ſhould be laid upon a table of convenient height, covered with a mattreſs. He is then to be brought as near to the edge of it as possible, and ſecured by aſſiſtants. The circulation of the blood in the arm is next to be stopped, by an aſſiſtant preſſing strongly with a firm compreſs over the ſubclavian artery where it paſſes over the firſt rib ; or an inciſion may be made along the courſe of the artery, which may be ſecured after ſeparating from it the contiguous nerves. When the artery is compreſſed, it will readily be known whether the compression proves effectual, by obſerving when the pulse at the wriſt is entirely stopped. As ſoon as this is the caſe, a circular inciſion is to be made through the integuments at the inſertion of the deltoid muſcle into the humerus. An assistant then draws the skin a little back, and at the edge of the retracted ſkin, the muſcles are to be cut in a circular direction to the bone.</p><p>If the artery has not been taken up at the beginning of the operation, it is now to be ſecured, as well as any branches which come in the way.</p><p>The amputation-kniſe is now to be laid aſide, and the reſt of the operation finiſhed with a ſtrong ſcalpel. A perpendicular inciſion is next to be made at a little diſtance from the outſide of the artery, beginning at the acromion, and terminating in the circular inciſion, cutting as deep as the ſurface of the bone. A ſimilar inciſion is to be made upon the back part of the arm, ſo that the flaps may be nearly of an equal breadth. The arterial branches are here to be ſecured ; the flaps are to be ſeparated from the bone, guarding againſt wounding the trunk of the artery ; the flaps are to be ſupported by an aſſiſtant ; and the capſular ligament of the joint is to be cut from the ſcapula : and thus the arm will be entirely ſeparated.</p><p>After the arm has been ſeparated, any arteries which appear about the joint are to be tied, and all the ligatures brought over the edges of the wound. The parts are to be cleared of clotted blood, and the two flaps drawn over the ‘<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0189.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0183"/>
wound, and ſecured by the twiſted future. A pledget of any emollient ſhould then be applied, and a sufficient cuſhion of lint, with a compreſs of old linen, put over the whole. A moderate preſſure is next to be applied by a flannel roller ; by which the parts will be ſupported, their union facilitated, and matter moſt likely prevented from being lodged. The treatment is then the same with that after amputation in other parts of the extremities. For two or three days after the operation, it is neceſſary that an aſſiſtant sit with the patient to compreſs the artery in caſe a bleeding ſhould ensue.</p><p>When it is neceſſary to amputate the whole hand, the operation may be performed at the wriſt, ſo as to leave as much of the member as poſſible ; and the ſame rules hold here as in amputating at any of the rest of the joints. The tourniquet is to be applied to the artery in the arm, and the cure is to be completed by the firſt intention. When any of the carpal bones are affected, the ſore will not heal till they either work out by ſuppuration, or are cut out by the knife. When the middle of any of the metacarpal bones is diſeaſed, while their extremities are found, the trepan may be applied, and the diſeaſed parts removed, while the remaining sound parts are preſerved. But if the whole bodies of one or two of theſe bones be affected, while the rest remain sound, all the affected bones ought to be removed. In performing the operation, an inciſion is to be made along the courte of the part affected ; and if the operator have it in his choice, the inciſion ſhould be made upon the back part, ſo as to ſave the great vessels and nerves ſituated in the palm. The integuments are then to be diſſected, and turned to each side ; after which the diſeaſed bones or parts of bones are to be removed, guarding as much as poſſible againſt wounding the principal arteries or nerves which lie near them</p><p>The diſeaſed parts are next to be ſeparated ; any arteries which happen to be cut are to be ſecured ; and, on account of the free communication which they have with neighbouring branches, they ought to be tied at both cut ends. If after this a bleeding ſtill continue, compreſs, ſtyptics, and other remedies proper for stopping blood, are immediately to be uſed. The ſides of the wound are to be brought together, and an attempt made to cure them by the firſt intention.</p><p>In amputating the fingers, it was formerly the practice to operate upon the bodies of the bones in the ſame manner as in the larger extremities ; but at preſent the removal at the joints is more frequently practiſed.</p><p>In performing the operation, it is necessary to ſave as much skin as may cover the stump, and this ought to be done upon the side next the palm, ſo as to guard againſt the effects of friction. The general ſteps of the operation are the ſame with thoſe for amputation of the larger joints.</p><p>A circular inciſion is to be made on the finger by a crooked biſtoury, about the middle of the phalanx, and it may be carried at once to the bone. Another inciſion is to be made with a common ſcalpel at each side of the finger, beginning at the circular one and continuing it to the joint, by which two flaps will be left to cover the stump. The ligaments of the joint are now to be divided, and the bone removed. The blood-vessels are to be ſecured by ligature, and the flaps exactly applied to each other; but in order to protect the end of the bone completely, a ſmall portion may be cut from the uppermoſt flap. The flaps are to be retained by adheſive plaſter, or by the twiſted future ; but if the latter be uſed, the tendons ought to be avoided. Over the ſore an emollient pledget is to be applied, and then a compreſs and roller. If the diſeaſe be ſo ſituated, that inſtead of amputating at the cavity of the joint, the ſurgeon ſhall think proper to operate upon the body of the bone, flaps are to be formed as above, and the bone is to be divided by means of a ſmall ſpring ſaw, fig. 122.</p><p>The amputation of the thigh, at the hip joint, has always been conſidered as one of the moſt formidable operations in surgery ; ſo much so, that very few caſes appear on record of its having ever been put in practice. In the Medical Commentaries of Edinburgh, an inſtance is recorded where the thigh was amputated at this joint, and where the patient ſurvived the operation 18 days, and then died from a different cauſe, when all riſk of hæmorrhagy was over, and when the sore had even a favourable appearance, which ſhows at leaſt that the operation has been done with ſafety. It certainly ought never to be done, however, unleſs as the laſt resource, and when the life of the patient is in absolute danger ; and then only when as much ſkin and muſcles can be ſaved as will cover the ſore, and when there is alſo a probability of being able to ſtop the hemorrhagy, and prevent it from returning.</p><p>When the operation is to be performed, the patient is to be laid upon his back on a table, and properly ſecured by aſſiſtants; one of whom ſhould be ready with a firm cuſhion to preſs, if neceſſary, upon the top of the femoral artery, juſt after it paſſes from behind Poupart’s ligament to the thigh. A longitudinal inciſion is now to be made through the ſkin, beginning immediately under the ligament, and continuing it downwards along the courſe of the artery for about six or ſeven inches. The aponeuroſis of the thigh is then to be divided by gentle ſcratches till a furrowed probe can be introduced, when the opening is to be dilated by means of a ſcalpel, till two or three inches of the artery be laid bare. A ſtrong ligature is now to be put under the artery by the aſſiſtance of a curved blunt-pointed needle.</p><p>The part where the ligature ſhould be passed is immediately above the origin of the arteria profunda ; for if that artery be not affected by the ligature, the patient might ſuffer by the loss of blood during the rest of the operation. The ligature is now to be ſecured by a running-knot ; Another ligature is to be introduced a little below the former, and likewiſe ſecured ; the artery is then to be divided between the ligatures. A circular inciſion is now to be made through the integuments of the thigh, about six inches from its upper end. The retracted ſkin is then to be pulled at leaſt an inch upwards ; and at the edges of it the amputating knife is to be applied, ſo as to cut the muſcles down to the bone. This being done, a cut is to be made upon the poſterior part of the thigh, beginning a little higher than the great trochanter, and continuing it down to the circular inciſion, and as deep as the joint. A ſimilar cut is to be made on the anterior part of the thigh, at a ſmall diſtance from the artery, and this reaching likewiſe down to the bone. The two muscular flaps are to be ſeparated from the bone and joint, and held back by an aſſiſtant. Every artery which appears is now to be ſecured. Then the capſular ligament, and next the round one, are to be ſeparated from the acetabulum ; by which means the limb will be removed from the body. The acetabulum and neighbouring bone are next to be examined ; and if they appear found, the caſe will be more favourable ; but at any rate, a cure is to be attempted by the firſt intention. For which purpoſe, after removing all the clotted blood from the ſurface of the wound, and bringing the ligatures over the edges of the ſkin, the muſcles are to be placed as nearly as poſſible in their natural ſituation ; and drawing the flaps together, ſo as to cover the wound in the moſt accurate manner, they are to be kept in this ſituation by adheſive plaſter, and<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0190.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0184"/>
by the twiſted future and other dreſſings, as in amputating at the under part of the thigh. The dreſſings are to be regained by a broad flannel roller paſſed three or four times round the body, and ſpirally over the ſtump, and ſecured. The patient is then to be laid in bed on the sound side, and treated as for amputation in other parts of the body ; only that greater attention is neceſſary, as there is no aſſiſtance from a tourniquet. Uncommon attention will alſo be neceſſary to prevent inflammation, and every ſymptom of fever which may ſucceed to the operation.</p><p>When the foot is ſo much diſeaſed as to require amputation, the operation might be performed at the point of the ankle ; but for the reasons given, when treating of amputation of the leg, it is found better to do it above the ankle. When a conſiderable part remains found, it ought to be ſaved. If any or the tarſal bones are affected, theſe are to be removed. When the middle or whole body of any of the metatarſal bones are diſeaſed, they are to be removed in the same manner as directed for ſimilar operations in bones of the hand ; and if even two of them remain found, provided they be ſo placed as to ſupport the toes, they ought to be preſerved, as it is known that, by proper treatment, an oſſeous matter may afterwards fill a conſiderable part, if not the whole, of the void ; or if any cavity remain, it may be ſo stuffed that the uſe of the foot may ſtill be enjoyed.</p><p>In performing an operation of this kind, the patient ſhould be laid upon a table, and the tourniquet applied in the ham to prevent hemorrhagy. An inciſion is then to be made along the affected part ; and if the ſeat of the diſeaſe admit it, the inciſion ſhould be made upon the upper side of the foot ſo as to ſave the ſole. The integuments are to be ſeparated and turned to each side, to allow the affected parts to be completely removed.</p><p>The principal veſſels and nerves are to be ſaved as much as poſſible ; but if any particular artery be cut, it is to be ſecured, and the part treated as after the removal of ſimilar parts of the hand.</p><p>The amputation of the toes is exactly ſimilar to that of the fingers.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> V. Of <hi rend="italic">removing the Ends of Carious Bones in the Joints.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> compound fractures, the ends of bones, when they protruded in ſuch a manner that they could not otherwiſe be returned, have frequently been ſawed through ; and their place has frequently been ſupplied by a renewal of bone, ſo as to preſerve the ordinary uſe of the limb. Many caſes have likewiſe happened, where a large part of the body of the bone has been thrown out by ſuppuration, and its place ſupplied ; and a few are upon record, where either the whole of a bone, or that end next the joint, has been thrown out, and its place filled up with callus, ſo that no inconvenience has been felt. From theſe circumſtances, Mr White of Mancheſter was led to preſerve an arm by sawing off the head of a diſeaſed humerus ; and Mr Park of Liverpool, to ſave a limb, by ſawing off the ends of the bones, in a cafe or white ſwelling of the knee. When therefore it happens that the end of a bone is diſeaſed, while the other parts are found, the diſeaſed part may be removed, and the found one ſaved, ſo as in a great meaſure to preſerve the free uſe of the limb.</p><p>In performing the operation, the firſt ſtep ſhould be, to uſe such means as may enable the operator to have a full management of the circulation of the part affected. Then a longitudinal inciſion of sufficient length, and perhaps another across it, may be necessary to be made through the ſoft parts of the joint ; and this opening ought to be at a diſtance from the large blood-veſſels, that they may be in no danger of being injured. After the end of the diſeaſed bone is sufficiently laid bare, it is either to be brought out of the joint, or a ſpatula or ſome other proper ſubſtance is to be introduced between the bone and <hi rend="italic">ſoft</hi> parts, ſo as to defend the latter in time of ſawing the bone. After the diſeaſed part of the bone is removed, the arterial branches are to be ſecured, and the wound treated like any other wound of equal ſize.</p><p>During the cure the limb ought to be kept in the poſture moſt favourable for the removal of the bone, and afterwards for the preſervation of the natural motion of the joint.</p><p>In this way a limb may ſometimes be ſaved which would otherwiſe have been removed. But though the removal of the diſeaſed end of one bone may be readily effected, the removal of all that part of the bones which enters into the compoſition of a joint muſt be attended with ſo must inconvenience, that it can ſeldom be uſeful, unleſs it be where the ends of bones are deſtroyed by external violence; for then <hi rend="italic">it</hi> appears that this operation may be performed with conſiderable ſucceſs.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXV. <hi rend="italic">Of Diminiſhing Pain in Surgical Operations.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> pain induced by ſurgical operations may be lessened in two different ways. The firſt is, by diminiſhing the natural ſenſibility of the ſyſtem ; and for this purpoſe narcotics of different kinds, and particularly opium, have been uſed ; but theſe are apt to induce diſagreeable ſymptoms, eſpecially sickneſs and vomiting, which might be attended with bad conſequences after ſome operations. They are therefore ſeldom employed before an operation. When, however, they are given immediately after it, and repeated as circumſtances may require, they often give great relief.</p><p>The other method of diminishing pain is, by lesſening the ſenſibility of a particular part of the body. It has long been known, that the ſenſibility of any part may not only be lessened, but entirely ſuſpended, by compressing the nerves which ſupply it. From a knowledge of this circumſtance, an inſtrument (fig. 123.) was invented some years ago by Mr James Moore ot London, by which the principal nerves of a member might be ſo compressed as to render the parts below perfectly inſenſible. A difficulty, however, ariſes here ; for as the nerves muſt be compressed at leaſt an hour previous to the operation, in order to render the parts quite inſenſible, and as it is extremely difficult to compreſs the nerves without at the ſame time affecting the veins, the latter are therefore in danger of being burſt. To prevent this inconvenience, Mr Moore propoſes to open a vein ; but this might be attended with bad conſequences in weakly conſtitutions. Beſides, it is ſaid, that by compressing the nerves in this manner, although leſs pain may be felt in the time oſ the operation, it is proportionally greater after the compression is removed. In certain parts of the body, however, where sufficient compreſſion can be made upon the nerves without acting much upon the veins, it would appear that the method may be practiſed with advantage ; though it has not yet been done, excepting in a few inſtances.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXVI. Of <hi rend="italic">Bandages.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> proper application of bandages is an object of great importance in ſurgery : and though dexterity is only to be acquired in this branch by practice, yet a few general rules may be found uſeful. Bandages are employed for the retention of dreſſings, for stopping hemorrhagies, for re<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0191.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0185"/>
moving deformities, and for effecting the union of divided parts. They ought to be formed of ſuch materials as are ſufficiently firm, while, at the ſame time, they give no uneaſineſs to the parts to which they are applied. They may be compoſed either of linen, cotton, or flannel. Of late years the two laſt have been preferred by many for their warmth and elaſticity, on which account they are certainly moſt proper, eſpecially in winter ; and likewiſe in caſes where the parts are liable to ſwelling and inflammation, as in wounds, luxations, and fractures. Besides, they more readily, abſorb any moiſture which may be diſcharged from the sores.</p><p>When firſt applied, they ſhould be clean, ſufficiently ſtrong, and as free of ſeams as poſſible. They ſhould be ſo tightly applied as to anſwer the purpoſe for which they are intended, without being in danger of impeding the circulation. They ſhould be applied in ſuch a manner that they may be eaſily looſened, and the parts examined with as much accuracy as poſſible ; and they ſhould be laid aſide as ſoon as the purpoſe for which they are intended is accompliſhed ; for when longer continued, they frequently impede the growth of the parts upon which they are applied.</p><p>With reſpect to bandages for particular parts, we ſhall begin with the head, and then proceed to the trunk and extremities. The <hi rend="italic">couvre-chef</hi> of the French, which is a ſquare napkin folded cornerwiſe, is moſt frequently uſed where a bandage is wanted for the head ; but a nightcap, having a band to go round the head, and another to tie under the chin, appears to be more ſuitable for this purpoſe. For making compreſſion on any particular part of the head, as for flopping of bleeding veſſels, the radiated bandage may be employed.</p><p>For keeping the edges of wounds together, as in caſes of longitudinal cuts of the head, or of any other parts, the uniting bandage is uſually employed, and is always to be preferred to futures, where it retains the edges of the wound with sufficient exactneſs. For retaining dreſſings upon the eyes, ſeveral turns of a roller have been uſed, and it is termed <hi rend="italic">monoculus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">binoculus</hi> according to its being applied to one or both eyes ; but the <hi rend="italic">couvre chef,</hi> and the nightcap already mentioned, are leſs apt to slip, and therefore found more convenient for this purpoſe.</p><p>For fractures of the noſe, or wounds there, or on any other part of the face, the uniting bandage anſwers beſt. And in caſes of fracture of the lower jaw, a four-headed roller is moſt convenient : the hole in the centre of the roller receives the chin, and aſſiſts in preventing the bandage from ſhifting. The two upper heads are to be carried backwards ; and being made to paſs each other at the occiput, they are afterwards brought once or twice round the head. The two under heads of the roller being reflected over the chin, are then to be turned upwards and fixed on the upper part of the head.</p><p>The bandages neceſſary for the neck are, the machine already mentioned after the operation of bronchotomy, and one uſed in caſes of wry neck. For every other purpoſe of bandaging a common roller may anſwer perfectly well.</p><p>For fractures of the ſcapula the application of a long roller may be of ſervice.</p><p>For retaining dreſſings upon the thorax the napkin and scapulary are commonly, and very properly uſed ; and when the napkin is employed merely for retaining dreſſings, it need not be longer than to paſs once round the body ; but if it be uſed for making pressure over a fractured rib, it ought to pass two or three times round. For both purpoſes its breadth ought to be six or ſeven inches for an adult.</p><p>The ſame kind of bandages is alſo uſed for making preſſure on the abdomen, as in caſes of umbilical or ventral hernia ; and to keep the bandage properly placed, a ſcapulary is uſed for preventing it from slipping down, and one or two ſtraps connected with it behind, are brought between the thighs, and fixed to it before to prevent it from moving up. A bandage of flannel, and different kinds of belts, are contrived for compreſſing the abdomen in the operation of tap. ping ; and trusses of various conſtructions are uſed for the retention of the protruded bowels in caſes of hernia.</p><p>Bandages of cotton or flannel are uſed for ſupporting the ſcrotum in the various diſeaſes which may occur there, as well as after the operations performed upon it.</p><p>One of the beſt bandages for the penis is a linen or cotton bag, fixed by a roller round the body.</p><p>For retaining dreſſings about the anus, or between that part and the ſcrotum, the T bandage is commonly uſed ; and it is made either with one or two tails, according to the ſituation of the part to which it is to be applied.</p><p>In ſimple fractures, and moſt of the other diſeaſes of the arm, fore-arm, and hand, the roller is the bandage commonly uſed ; but in compound fractures of theſe parts, as well as in the different kinds of fractures of the lower extremities, the 12 or 18 tailed bandage is necessary.</p><p>For longitudinal wounds of the extremities, the uniting bandage is uſed with the ſame advantage as has been already mentioned for wounds of a ſimilar nature upon the head.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXVII. <hi rend="italic">The Method of opening a dead Body.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Surgeons</hi> are often called, in order to inveſtigate the cauſe and feat of diſeaſes and death, either by the relations of the deceaſed, or the magistrates to whom a repent is to be made ; therefore, at the time of performing this operation, minutes ſhould be taken of what is obſerved. The inſtruments, and all things necessary, ſhould be diſpoſed in order, as for any other operation ; as knives, a razor, a great and ſmall ſaw, ſciſſars ſtraight and curved, elevators, needles threaded, ſponges, tow, ſaw-duſt or bran, baſons with water, towels, and receivers for the viſcera when they are to be taken out of their cavities The body is to be laid upon a ſuitable table, advantageously placed for the light, having a cloth thrown over the parts which decency demands ſhould be concealed, eſpecially in females.</p><p>When it is intended only to inſpect the abdomen and its contents, a longitudinal inciſion from the xiphoid cartilage to the os pubis, interſected by a tranſverſe one at the navel, will give a fair opportunity of anſwering theſe purpoſes, when the angles are reverſed. Should it be required to examine all the three cavities, and the parts contained in them, we are to begin by opening the head, making an inciſion quite croſs to the bone, from ear to ear ; which ſection is preferable to the crucial, commonly made on this occaſion : then the ſcalp may be eaſily dissected from the ſkull, and turned down over the face, and towards the neck, giving room for the ſaw. The head muſt be held very ſteadily by an aſſiſtant during the ſawing, which ſhould be begun on the middle of the frontal, proceeding to each temporal bone, and ſo to finiſh the circle upon the middle of the occipital bone ; which may generally be done conveniently enough, by raiſing the head and inclining it forward after having proceeded as far as this bone ; or the body may then be turned prone, ſhould that poſture be found more convenient to complete the circle. The cap of the ſkull is then to be raised with the elevator, occaſionally cutting the adheſions of the dura mater ; after this the encephalon is to be removed, carefully ſeparating the other attachments of the membrane.</p><p>In order to bring the thorax and abdomen, with the parts<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0192.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0186"/>
contained in theſe cavities, under one view, an incision is to be made on each side of the ſternum, in the courſe oſ the cartilages of the ribs which are annexed to it ; dissecting from thence the muſcles with the teguments, the ſpace of two or three inches towards the ſpine ; then cutting through the cartilages, which will be ſeen, and eaſily divided with a knife a little curved near the point ; then the inciſions are to be continued from the ſternum through the abdominal cavity, in an oblique direction, to each ilium or inguen ; after which the clavicles are to be ſeparated from the ſternum, or this bone divided at its ſuperior cartilaginous junction, with a ſtrong knife, dissecting it from the mediaſtinum, and turning it downwards with the muſcles, &amp; <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> of the abdomen. This is the moſt eligible manner of opening theſe cavities, and gives an opportunity of ſewing them up with a better appearance for any person’s view afterwards. That kind of ſtitch called by ſempſtreſſes the <hi rend="italic">herring-bone</hi> or <hi rend="italic">flat ſeam</hi> has a very pretty and neat effect upon theſe occasions.</p><p>If it is propoſed to take out the thoracic and abdominal viſcera together, for further examination, the diaphragm is firſt to be cut down to the ſpine on both ſides ; then, to avoid being incommoded with blood, &amp;c. two very ſtrong ligatures are to be paſſed round the œsophagus and large blood-veſſels, in which the trachea may be included ; tying them ſtrait, and then dividing theſe parts between the ligatures : the ſame meaſures are to be taken in reſpect to the inferior vessels upon the lumbar region, a little above the bifurcation of the aorta, including the vena cava ; and alſo upon the rectum. After having obſerved theſe precautions, the viſcera, with the diaphragm, are to be removed by a wary diſſection, all the way cloſe to the ſpine ; and by gently drawing them at the ſame time, the ſeparation will be greatly facilitated.</p><p>When the thoracic and abdominal viſcera are to be taken out ſeparately, in the firſt caſe ligatures muſt be made, as have been deſcribed upon the veſſels, &amp;c. juſt above the diaphragm, and in the other juſt below it, and upon the rectum.</p><p>Should we be called upon to perform this office when the body is become very putrid, it will be absolutely neceſſary to have ſuch parts of it well waſhed with warm vinegar and brandy, and then ſprinkled with lavender-water or ſome ſuch odoriferous antiputreſcent liquor, before the examination, in order to correct the stench, and defend us againſt the noxious quality of the effluvia ; a precaution, the neglect of which may be attended with very direful effects.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> XXXVIII. <hi rend="italic">Of Embalming dead Bodies.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">in</hi> the early ages of the world, the practice of embalming dead bodies was very common, particularly among the Egyptians ;. but it has long been diſuſed in almoſt all countries, except for great perſonages. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Embalming.</hi> The following directions are taken from Mr Gooch, to whom they were communicated by a person of great character, and well acquainted with the modern practice of embalming in this kingdom.</p><p>After eviſceration, as has been directed in opening a dead body, and continuing the inciſion farther upwards, even into the mouth, and, if practicable, without cutting the ſkin of the neck, all the cavities are to be well cleanſed, and the humidity ſucked up with ſponges, then waſhed with <hi rend="italic">tinct. myrrhae,</hi> and filled with a ſpecies compounded of fragrant herbs, aromatic drugs, and gums reduced to powder not very fine, firſt reſtoring the heart to its former reſidence, after having opened its ventricles, cleanſed and waſhed them with the tincture, stuffed them with the ſpices, and ſewed them up ; and then the cavities are to be ſtitched very cloſe with the glover’s or ſpiral future. Large and deep inciſions are alſo to be made in all the moſt fleſhy parts, cleaning and waſhing them with the tincture in the ſame manner, filling them with the antiſeptic ſpices, and ſtitching them up. Then the head, trunk, and limbs, are to be perfectly well covered with cerecloth ; putting a piece under the chin, to be ſecured by ſewing on the top of the head, after having well adjuſted the cap of the ſkull, ſewed the ſcalp together, and cleaned the mouth, as has been directed for the other parts, and putting in ſome of the ſpices. The cerecloth is to be prepared, according to art, with a compoſition made of wax, rofin, ſtorax, and painter’s drying oil. After the application of the cerecloth, with great care and exactness, cut into ſuitable pieces according to the reſpective parts, and cloſing them well everywhere, the face being cloſe ſhaved, is to be covered with ſome of the above compoſition melted, and laid on with a bruſh of a proper degree of heat, and of a moderate thickneſs ; which may have a faint fleſh- colour given it with vermilion ; and when it is grown cold and stiff upon this part, it may be lightly covered with hard varniſh ; or this varniſh, applied thick, may here ſerve the purpoſe alone. A cap is to be well adapted to the head, falling down upon the neck, and to be sewed under the chin, making a few circular turns about the neck with a roller of a proper breadth. All the reſt of the corpſe is to be incloſed in a ſheet, to be artfully cut, and ſewed on very cloſe and ſmooth, with the fineſt tape, and the <hi rend="italic">flat seam</hi> mentioned in the preceding chapter ; over which an appropriate dress is to be put, as the relations or friends think fit to direct and appoint, and then laid into the coffin, which ſhould be in readineſs : but when it is ſome great perſonage, who is to lie in ſtate for public view before the funeral rites are ſolemnized, the dress muſt be appropriated to his dignity and character. The brain and other viſcera are to be put with ſome of the ſpices into a leaden box.
