. The Sãbians (<hi rend="italic">aṣ-Sābi'ūn</hi>) who are first mentioned in the Koran (ii. 59, v. 73, xxii. 17) were a semi-Christian sect of Babylonia, the Elkesaites, closely resembling the Mandaeans or so-called “ Christians of St John the Baptist,” but not identical with them. Their name is probably derived from the Aramaic ■■■ a dialectical form of ■■■, and signifies “ those who wash themselves ”; the term <hi rend="italic">al-mughtasila,</hi> which is sometimes applied to them by Arab writers, has the same meaning, and they were also known as <hi rend="italic">ήμϵροβαπτισται.</hi> How Mahomet understood the term “ Sãbians ” is uncertain, but he mentions them together with the Jews and Christians. The older Mahommedan theo-logians were agreed that they possessed a written revelation and were entitled accordingly to enjoy a toleration not granted to mere heathen. Curiously enough, the name “ Sãbian ” was used by the Meccanidolaters to denote Mahomet himself and his Moslem converts, apparently on account of the frequent ceremonial ablutions which formed a striking feature of the new religion.</p><p>From these true Sãbians the pseudo-Ṣābians of Ḥarrān <hi rend="italic">(Carrhae)</hi> in Mesopotamia must be carefully distinguished. In λ.d. 830 the Caliph Ma’mūn, while marching against the Byzantines, received a deputation of the inhabitants of IJarrãn. Astonished by the sight of their long hair and extraordinary costume, he inquired what religion they professed, and getting no satisfactory answer threatened to exterminate them, unless by the time of his return from the war they should have embraced either Islam or one of the creeds tolerated in the Koran. Con-sequently, acting on the advice of a Mahommedan jurist, the Ḥarrānians declared themselves to be “ Ṣābians,” a name which shielded them from persecution in virtue of its Koranic authority and was so vague that it enabled them to maintain their ancient beliefs undisturbed. There is no doubt as to the general nature of the religious beliefs and practices which they sought to mask. Since the epoch of Alexander the Great IJarrãn had been a famous centre of pagan and Hellenistic culture; its people were Syrian heathens, star-worshippers versed in astrology and magic. In their temples the planetary powers were propitiated by blood-offerings, and it is probable that human victims were occasionally sacrificed even as late as the 9th century of our era. The more enlightened Ḥarrānians, however, adopted a religious philosophy strongly tinged with Neoplatonic and Christian elements. They produced a brilliant succession of eminent scholars and scientists who transmitted to the Moslems the results of Babylonian civilization and Greek learning, and their influence at the court of Baghdad secured more or less toleration for Sãbianism, although in the reign of Harūn al-Rashïd the Ḥarrānians had already found it necessary to establish a fund by means of which the conscientious scruples of Moslem officials might be overcome. Accounts of these false Sãbians reached the West through Maimonides, and then through Arabic sources, long before it was understood that the name in this application was only a disguise. Hence the utmost confusion prevailed in all European accounts of them till Chwolsohn published in 1856 his <hi rend="italic">Ssabier und der Ssabismus,</hi> in which the authorities for the history and belief of the Ḥarrānians in the middle ages are collected and discussed.</p><p>See also “ Nouveaux documents pour l’étude de la religion des Harraniens,” by Dozy and De Goeje, in the <hi rend="italic">Actes</hi> of the sixth Oriental congress, ii. 281 f.
