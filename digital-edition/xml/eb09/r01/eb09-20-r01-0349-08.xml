<p>as adventurous as any boy reader of his novels could desire. He was a native of Ulster, born in 1818, and was educated for the church, but, disliking the prospect of a regular profession, went to America at the age of twenty in search of excitement and fortune. Among other experiences he made trading excursions on the Red River, and studied the ways of the retiring red man and the white pioneer on the spot. He made acquaintance with the Missouri in the same practical manner, and roved about through all the States of the Union. When the war with Mexico broke out in 1845 he obtained a commission, was present at the siege and capture of Vera Cruz, and led a forlorn hope at Chapultepec. In one of his novels he says that he believed theoretically in the military value of untrained troops, and that he had found his theories confirmed in actual warfare. But, though he saw a good deal of service in America, he was disappointed in his plans for taking part in a conflict with the regular troops of a European country. An enthusiastic republican, he offered his services to the Hungarian insurgents in 1849, raised a body of volunteers, and sailed for Europe, but arrived too late. Thereafter he settled in England, and began his career of a novelist in 1849 with the <hi rend="italic">Rifle Rangers.</hi> This was followed next year by the <hi rend="italic">Scalp Hunters.</hi> He never surpassed his first productions, except perhaps in <hi rend="italic">The White Chief</hi> (1855) and <hi rend="italic">The Quadroon</hi> (1856); but he continued to produce tales of self-reliant enterprise and exciting adventure with great fertility. Simplicity of plot and easy variety of exciting incident are among the merits that contribute to his popularity with boys. His reflexions are not profound, but are frequently more sensible than might be presumed at first sight from his aggressive manner of expressing them. He died in London, October 22, 1883.</p>
