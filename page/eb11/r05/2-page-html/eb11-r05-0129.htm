<p><span class="font0">Since 1870 the municipalities in European Russia have had institutions like those of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos.</span><span class="font0"> All owners of houses,&nbsp;and tax-paying merchants, artisans and workmen&nbsp;are enrolled on lists in a descending order according&nbsp;to their assessed wealth. The total valuation is then&nbsp;divided into three equal parts, representing three groups of&nbsp;electors very unequal in number, each of which elects an equal&nbsp;number of delegates to the municipal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">duma.</span><span class="font0"> The executive&nbsp;is in the hands of an elective mayor and an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">uprava,</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;consists of several members elected by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">duma.</span><span class="font0"> Under&nbsp;Alexander III., however, by laws promulgated in 1892 and 1894,&nbsp;the municipal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dumas</span><span class="font0"> were subordinated to the governors in the&nbsp;same way as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos.</span><span class="font0"> In 1894 municipal institutions,&nbsp;with still more restricted powers, were granted to several towns</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">in Siberia, and in 1895 to some in Caucasia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Baltic provinces (Courland, Livonia and Esthonia) the landowning classes formerly enjoyed considerable powers&nbsp;of self-government and numerous privileges in matters&nbsp;affecting education, police and the administration of&nbsp;local justice. But by laws promulgated in 1888 and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1889 the rights of police and manorial justice were transferred from the landlords to officials of the central government. Since&nbsp;about the same time a process of rigorous Russification has&nbsp;been carried through in the same provinces, in all departments&nbsp;of administration, in the higher schools and in the university&nbsp;of Dorpat, the name of which was altered to Yuriev. In 1893&nbsp;district committees for the management of the peasants’ affairs,&nbsp;similar to those in the purely Russian governments, were introduced into this part of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Judicial System.—</span><span class="font0">Not the least valuable of the gifts of the “ tsar emancipator,” Alexander II., to Russia was the judicial&nbsp;system established by the statute </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Sudebni Ustav)</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;the 20th of November 1864. The system which this&nbsp;superseded was not indigenous to Russia, but had&nbsp;been set up by Peter the Great, who had taken as his&nbsp;model the inquisitorial »procedure at that time in vogue on&nbsp;the continent of western Europe. Both civil and criminal&nbsp;procedure were secret. All the proceedings were conducted&nbsp;in writing, and the judges were not confronted with either&nbsp;the parties or the witnesses until they emerged to deliver judgment. This secrecy, combined with the fact that the judges&nbsp;were very ill paid, led to universal bribery and corruption. To&nbsp;check this courts were multiplied (there were five, six or more&nbsp;instances), which only multiplied the evil. Documents accumulated from court to court, till none but the clerks who had&nbsp;written them could tell their gist; costs were piled up; and all&nbsp;this, combined with the confusion caused by the chaotic mass of&nbsp;imperial ukazes, ordinances and ancient laws—often inconsistent&nbsp;or flatly contradictory—made the administration of justice, if&nbsp;possible, more dilatory and capricious than in the old, unreformed&nbsp;English court of chancery. Above all, there was no dividing&nbsp;line between the judiciary and the administrative functions.&nbsp;The judges were not so by profession; they were merely members&nbsp;of the official class </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(chinovniks),</span><span class="font0"> the prejudices and vices of which</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">they shared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of this system—except so far as the confusion of the laws is concerned—the reform of 1864 made a clean sweep. The new&nbsp;system established—based partly on English, partly&nbsp;on French models—was built up on certain broad&nbsp;principles: the separation of the judicial and administrative functions, the independence of the judges and&nbsp;courts, the publicity of trials and oral procedure, the equality&nbsp;of all classes before the law. Moreover, a democratic element&nbsp;was introduced by the adoption of the jury system and—so far&nbsp;as one order of tribunal was concerned—the election of judges.&nbsp;The establishment of a judicial system on these principles&nbsp;constituted, as M. Leroy-Beaulieu justly observes, a fundamental change in the conception of the Russian state, which,&nbsp;by placing the administration of justice outside the sphere of&nbsp;the executive power, ceased to be a despotism. This fact&nbsp;made the new system especially obnoxious to the bureaucracy,&nbsp;and during the latter years of Alexander II. and the reign of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alexander III. there was a piecemeal taking back of what had been given. It was reserved for the third Duma, after the&nbsp;revolution, to begin the reversal of this process.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The system established by the law of 1864 is remarkable in that it set up two wholly separate orders of tribunals, each&nbsp;having their own courts of appeal and coming in contact only&nbsp;in the senate, as the supreme court of cassation. The first of&nbsp;these, based on the English model, are the courts of the&nbsp;elected justices of the peace, with jurisdiction over petty&nbsp;causes, whether civil or criminal; the second, based on&nbsp;the French model, are the ordinary tribunals of nominated&nbsp;judges, sitting with or without a jury to hear important&nbsp;cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The justices of the peace, who must be landowners@@<sup>2</sup> or (in towns) persons of moderate property, are elected by the&nbsp;municipal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dumas</span><span class="font0"> in the towns, and by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in the country districts, for a term of three years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They are of two classes: (r) acting justices </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(uckastofaye mirovye sudi)\</span><span class="font0"> (2) honorary justices </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(pochetnye mirovye sudi).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The acting justice sits normally alone to hear causes in his&nbsp;canton of the peace </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(uchastok),</span><span class="font0"> but, at the request of both&nbsp;parties to a suit, he may call in an honorary justice as&nbsp;assessor or substitute.@@<sup>3</sup> In all civil cases involving less than&nbsp;30 roubles, and in criminal cases punishable by no more than&nbsp;three days’ arrest, his judgment is final. In other cases appeal&nbsp;can be made to the “ assize of the peace ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(mirovye syeztf),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">consisting of three or more justices of the peace meeting&nbsp;monthly (cf. the English quarter sessions), which acts both as&nbsp;a court of appeal and of cassation. From this again appeal can&nbsp;be made on points of law or disputed procedure to the senate,&nbsp;which may send the case back for retrial by an assize of the peace&nbsp;in another district.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ordinary tribunals, in their organization, personnel and procedure, are modelled very closely on those of France (see&nbsp;France, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Law and Institutions).</span><span class="font0"> From the town&nbsp;judge </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ispravnik),</span><span class="font0"> who, in spite of the principle laid&nbsp;down in 1864, combines judicial and administrative&nbsp;functions, an appeal lies (as in the case of the justices of&nbsp;the peace) to an assembly of such judges; from these again&nbsp;there is an appeal to the district court </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(okrugniya sud),</span><span class="font0"> consisting of three judges;@@<sup>4</sup> from this to the court of appeal&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(sudebniya palata);</span><span class="font0"> while over this again is the senate, which,&nbsp;as the supreme court of cassation, can send a case for retrial&nbsp;for reason shown. The district court, sitting with a jury,&nbsp;can try criminal cases without appeal, but only by special&nbsp;leave in each case of the court of appeaL The senate, as&nbsp;supreme court of cassation, has two departments, one for&nbsp;civil and one for criminal cases. As a court of justice its&nbsp;main drawback is that it is wholly unable to cope with the&nbsp;vast mass of documents representing appeals from all parts&nbsp;of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two important classes in Russia stood more or less outside the competence of the above systems: the clergy and the&nbsp;peasants. The ecclesiastical courts still retain a&nbsp;jurisdiction over the clergy which they have lost&nbsp;elsewhere in Europe; anti in them the old secret&nbsp;written procedure survives. Their interest for the laity lies</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>An </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ukazoi</span><span class="font0"> 1879 gave the governors the right to report secretly on the qualifications of candidates for the office of justice of the&nbsp;peace. In 1869 Alexander III. abolished the election of justices&nbsp;of the peace, except in certain large towns and some outlying&nbsp;parts of the empire, and greatly restricted the right of trial by&nbsp;jury. The confusion of the judicial and administrative functions&nbsp;was introduced. again by the appointment of officials as judges.&nbsp;In 1909 the thira Duma restored the election of justices of the&nbsp;peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2 </sup>The justices, though noble-landowners, are almost exclusively of very moderate means, and, though elected by the land-owning&nbsp;class, they are—according to M. Leroy-Beaulieu—prejudiced in&nbsp;favour of the poor </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mujik</span><span class="font0"> rather than of the wealthy landlord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>3</sup> These honorary justices are mainly recruited from the ranks of the higher bureaucracy and the army.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@4 </sup>This corresponds to the French </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cour d’arrondissement,</span><span class="font0"> but its jurisdiction is, territorially, much wider, often covering several&nbsp;districts or even a whole government.</span></p>
