He was honoured in Portugal with the order of Chriſt : In France he was architect and painter to the king, and member of the different academies establiſhed for the advancement of theſe arts. He received the ſame titles from the kings of Britain, Spain, Poland, and from the duke of Wirtemberg. Notwithſtanding theſe advantages, his want of economy was ſo great, that he left nothing behind him. He died at Paris in 1766. Paris is indebted to him for many of its ornaments.
