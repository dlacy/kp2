        <p><span class="font0">result from the delicacy of texture and rarity which, comparatively
                speaking, all nets exhibit, when fairly used, and no contrivances adopted for
                abusively increasing the take.&nbsp;The forms of nets vary according to the manner
                in which&nbsp;they are intended to act, and this is either by entangling&nbsp;the
                fish in their complicated folds, as in the </span><span class="font0"

                >seine.</span><span class="font0"> It is somewhat extraordinary that it was not
                until the year 1685 that&nbsp;nets were introduced into Norway, by one Claus Niels
                Sti-ningen. The fishermen set up a general outcry against&nbsp;so </span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pernicious an innovation,</span><span
                class="font0"> and, after much disputing, the&nbsp;question was decided by an appeal
                to the law, and experience has confirmed the verdict, that nets are not
                only&nbsp;not prejudicial, but highly conducive to the prosperity of&nbsp;the
                fishing trade. Of the antiquity of the art of net-making it will not be necessary to
                enter into any detail ; that&nbsp;nets were invented at a very early period, and
                have been&nbsp;universally adopted all over the world, and were, and have&nbsp;been
                ever since, put to an infinite variety of uses, requires&nbsp;no farther proof than
                can be afforded by a reference to the&nbsp;works of the most ancient authors, both
                sacred and profane, by whom constant allusion is made to network ; and&nbsp;modern
                travellers have found it to be in vogue amongst the&nbsp;most rude as well as the
                most polished nations. For much&nbsp;curious information on this head we must refer
                the reader&nbsp;to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >Beckmann.@@<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font0"> One use of the net, however,
                though known&nbsp;to the ancients, and long since adopted in Italy and
                other&nbsp;hot climates, has only quite recently, and hitherto but partially, been
                recognised in this country. It deserves notice,&nbsp;not solely on account of its
                exhibiting a curious phenomenon in the habits of certain insects highly interesting
                to the&nbsp;naturalist, but, for the sake of humanity, it is worthy also&nbsp;of the
                attention of the philanthropist. It has been found&nbsp;by careful experiments that
                a net made of the finest thread,&nbsp;of any colour, and with meshes of one inch and
                a quarter&nbsp;square, effectually keeps out the house-fly from the apartments
                across the open windows of which it is spread.@@<sup>2</sup> We&nbsp;must leave it
                to others to speculate upon the causes which&nbsp;operate on the imagination of the
                gnat and house-fly, so as&nbsp;to prevent them venturing through the “ capacious
                breadth&nbsp;of these divisions.” It has been suggested with much probability, that
                an optical delusion in the eyes of these insects&nbsp;produces this
                w<sup>,</sup>onderful effect. The fact having been so&nbsp;well ascertained, what is
                there, except prejudice, to prevent&nbsp;our taking advantage of it, as affording,
                at a very trifling&nbsp;expense, and with very little trouble, a material
                comfort,&nbsp;not only to “ the whole,” but to “ the sick ?” How refreshing will it
                prove to many a poor helpless sufferer to feel&nbsp;that he can enjoy in hot weather
                the luxury of fresh air,&nbsp;free from the irksome attacks of these persevering,
                buzzing,&nbsp;biting disturbers of his peace, at a time when he most
                needs&nbsp;repose, and every palliative that art can suggest ! But our&nbsp;limits
                warn us to commence our practical directions relating to our subject. 1.

                the loop or stitch in netting.</span><span class="font0"> Being&nbsp;so generally
                understood that any neighbour can in a few&nbsp;minutes teach the uninitiated, we
                shall not describe the process ; a little careful observation will show more than
                any&nbsp;written description can, however minute. 3. The same&nbsp;may be said
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of making accrues.</span><span
                class="font0"> It will be easily understood how a very simple manœuvre, when put in
                practice,&nbsp;becomes apparently complicated when described in words.&nbsp;It would
                be idle were we, under the plea of rendering this&nbsp;article complete, to encumber
                it with laboured explanations, if they can be called such, which leave the
                reader&nbsp;more in the dark than he was before. 4. The </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">bend-knot&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is constantly
                required for uniting two ends of twine together, &amp;c., and is thus performed. See
                fig. 4, in which A&nbsp;and B are to be joined. 5. </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">The art of mending</span><span class="font0"> is of
                great&nbsp;importance ; for, if the fisherman cannot mend an occasional rent, he
                will soon be obliged to have a new net. Two&nbsp;or three damaged meshes will, if
                neglected, speedily become a yawning hole ; whereas the engine will last a
                long&nbsp;time by taking care to replace injured parts properly, and&nbsp;without
                delay. By amateur netters and gamekeepers this&nbsp;part of the art of reticulation
                is generally unheeded, and a&nbsp;bungling confusion of threads, drawn together any
                how,&nbsp;serving rather to increase the mischief, is substituted for a&nbsp;neat
                and efficient repair. In order to explain, as clearly as&nbsp;may be, the method to
                be pursued, we must request the&nbsp;reader to suppose that a net (fig. 5) has an
                injury in the&nbsp;middle of the space indicated hy the dotted lines. We&nbsp;must
                begin by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cutting</span><span
                class="font0"> the net, that is, the hole must be&nbsp;enlarged, not only by
                removing that portion which is actually torn, but by cutting into the sound parts.
                This operation is represented in fig. 5. The parts to be cut away&nbsp;are marked by
                the transverse lines </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">baa a,
                cba a ad,</span><span class="font0"> below&nbsp;the knots of the original net. It
                will be observed that,&nbsp;whereas at </span><span class="font0"
