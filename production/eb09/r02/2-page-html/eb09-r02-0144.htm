<p><span class="font0">for roads of importance near towns. The side spaces may be from</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or 5 to 8 or 10 feet wide ; wide sides give the sun and air access&nbsp;to the road, and tend to keep it dry, and also afford space for the&nbsp;deposit of road materials and scrapings. In cuttings or on embankments the transverse section has of course to be modified. The&nbsp;road surface should have just enough convexity to throw the wet&nbsp;off freely, and a very moderate amount is sufficient when a good&nbsp;surface is maintained. On a too convex road the traffic keeps to&nbsp;the middle, and wears ruts which retain the water, so that the&nbsp;surface is not so dry as with a flatter section which allows the&nbsp;traffic to distribute itself over the whole width. Telford used a&nbsp;cross section differing slightly from an arc of a circle in being more&nbsp;convex in the middle than at the sides. Walker recommended&nbsp;two straight lines joined in the middle of the road by a curve,&nbsp;and inclined about 1 in 24 towards the sides, the objection to which&nbsp;is that the flat sides are liable to wear hollow. An arc of a circle&nbsp;is often used, and is a good form, but on the whole a curve more&nbsp;convex at the centre than towards the sides is the best. The rise&nbsp;in the curve from the sides to the centre need not exceed one-fortieth of the width, and one-sixtieth is generally enough on&nbsp;well-kept roads, and if seven-eighths of the total rise are given at&nbsp;one-fourth the distance from the centre to the sides and five-eighths&nbsp;at half that distance a curve of suitable form will be obtained. It&nbsp;is generally best to obtain the requisite convexity by rounding&nbsp;the formation surface or seat of the road and giving a uniform&nbsp;thickness to the coating of stone. When there is not a kerb there&nbsp;should be a “ shouldering” of sods and earth on each side to keep&nbsp;the road materials in place, and to form with the finished surface&nbsp;the water tables or side channels in which the surface drainage is&nbsp;collected, to be conveyed by outlets at frequent intervals to the&nbsp;side ditches. The outlets are open cuts through the sides or drains&nbsp;beneath the footpaths. The side ditches should be deep enough to&nbsp;thoroughly drain the foundation of the road, and cross or mitre&nbsp;drains under the road communicating with the side ditches may&nbsp;be required in wet soil. A thorough drainage of the subsoil is of&nbsp;the greatest importance, and it is economical in the end to go to&nbsp;considerable expense to secure it. In a cutting, or where there are&nbsp;no side ditches, the surface water may be taken off by gratings and&nbsp;under drains beneath the side channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The thickness to be given to a road made altogether of broken stone will depend on the traffic it is intended for. On a good well-drained soil a thickness of 6 inches will make an excellent road for&nbsp;ordinary traffic, and Macadam’s opinion that 10 inches of well-consolidated material was sufficient to carry the heaviest traffic on any&nbsp;substratum if properly drained has proved to be generally correct.&nbsp;In a new road the loss of thickness during consolidation must be&nbsp;allowed for, and the materials should be laid about one-half thicker&nbsp;than the coating is intended to be. When the materials are not&nbsp;rolled, a thickness of 3 to 6 inches should be laid first, and when&nbsp;that has partly consolidated under the traffic other coats may be&nbsp;added to make up the full thickness. There is great wear and waste&nbsp;of the materials in consolidating if they are laid too thickly at once.&nbsp;Inferior material is sometimes used in the lower part of the road&nbsp;coating, especially when the surface is to be of granite or other hard&nbsp;expensive stone. Thus flints or gravel may be used for the lower</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or 6 inches of a road to be coated with 3 or 4 inches of granite.&nbsp;Telford covered the broken stone of new roads with 1⅛ inches of&nbsp;gravel to act as a binding material. Macadam absolutely interdicted the use of any binding material, leaving the broken stone&nbsp;to work in and unite by its own angles under the traffic. An unsound road may be made by the improper use of a binding material,&nbsp;but there is no doubt that broken stone consolidates more quickly,&nbsp;and without losing its angular form, when binding is moderately&nbsp;used. About one half the volume of broken stone is void space,&nbsp;and, as the results of examinations into the composition of the coatings of roads when thoroughly consolidated prove that a very large&nbsp;proportion must necessarily be small stones and detritus, it is&nbsp;much better to give some portion of this at first rather than to&nbsp;obtain it by the crushing and grinding of the materials by the&nbsp;traffic. The binding material—fine gravel, sand, or road scrapings—&nbsp;should be spread over the surface after the broken stone is laid and&nbsp;not be mixed with it. Uniform consolidation is much aided by&nbsp;raking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whenever it is possible a new road should be finished with a roller. The materials are consolidated with less waste, and wear&nbsp;and tear of vehicles and horses is saved. Horse-rollers, if heavy&nbsp;enough to be efficient, require a number of horses to draw them and&nbsp;are cumbersome to use. A ton or a ton and a half weight per foot&nbsp;of width is desirable, and to obtain it a roller 4 feet wide must be&nbsp;loaded to 5 or 6 tons, and will require as many horses to draw it.&nbsp;In Great Britain horse-rollers have to a great extent been superseded by steam road rollers in consequence of the superiority and&nbsp;economy in the work done. A lδ-ton roller, 7 feet wide, giving&nbsp;upwards of 2 tons weight per foot, can thoroughly consolidate&nbsp;1000 to 2000 square yards of newly-laid materials per day. The&nbsp;materials should be formed to the proper section, and not more&nbsp;than 4 or 5 inches in thickness ; if a greater thickness is required&nbsp;it is better to roll two coats separately. After several passages of&nbsp;the roller any hollows must be filled up with small materials, and&nbsp;the rolling must be continued until it causes no motion among the&nbsp;stones. When this result has been attained the binding material&nbsp;may be added. It should be spread dry and uniformly in moderate&nbsp;quantities and should be rolled into the interstices with the aid of&nbsp;watering and sweeping. Provided that all the interstices in the&nbsp;upper stratum of stones are filled after the stones are thoroughly&nbsp;consolidated, the less binding that is used the better. By using&nbsp;binding in larger quantity, and before the stone is thoroughly consolidated, the amount of rolling required is lessened, but at the&nbsp;expense of durability in the road. Watering is necessary from&nbsp;the commencement of the rolling unless the weather is wet, but&nbsp;excessive watering, especially in the earlier stages, tends to soften&nbsp;the foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A pitched foundation like that used by Telford is always desirable for a road that is subject to heavy traffic. It consists of fiat stones carefully set on edge in courses across the road with the&nbsp;broadest edges downwards. The upper edges should not exceed 4&nbsp;inches in breadth, to hold the broken stone well. All inequalities&nbsp;must be knocked off, and small stones and chips must be firmly&nbsp;pinned into the interstices with a hammer, so as to form a regular&nbsp;convex surface, with every stone firmly fixed in place. The thickness of the pitching is generally 6 or 7 inches ; it should not be less&nbsp;than 4, and it may generally be thicker without any sensible&nbsp;increase of cost. At least 4 inches of broken stone are required over&nbsp;the pitched foundation, and, when consolidated, 6 are always sufficient. A foundation of cement concrete 6 inches thick was used&nbsp;by Sir J. Macneill on the Highgate Archway (London) road on a&nbsp;bad clay bottom, and common lime concrete was subsequently used&nbsp;elsewhere. A bed of lias lime concrete 12 inches thick was laid as&nbsp;a foundation in Southwark Street and on the Thames Embankment,&nbsp;but it is too expensive for a macadamized road under ordinary circumstances. Burned clay, gravel, or even sand may be usefully&nbsp;employed as a foundation on a clay bottom, to cut off the road&nbsp;material from the clay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The qualities required in a good road stone are hardness, toughness, and ability to resist the action of the weather, and these are not always found together in the same stone. Limestones possess&nbsp;another quality, that of furnishing a mortar-like detritus which&nbsp;binds the stone together, and enables it to wear better than a&nbsp;harder material that does not bind. For heavy traffic the best&nbsp;materials are traps, basalts, greenstones, and syenite ; quartzose&nbsp;grits and cherty sandstones are also excellent materials. For&nbsp;moderate traffic the harder limestones are sufficiently durable and&nbsp;make the smoothest and pleasantest roads. Coefficients of quality&nbsp;for various road materials have been obtained by the engineers of&nbsp;the French “ Administration des Ponts et Chaussées.” The quality&nbsp;was assumed to be in inverse proportion to the quantity consumed&nbsp;on a length of road with the same traffic, and measurements of&nbsp;traffic and wear were systematically made to arrive at correct results.&nbsp;These processes requiring great care and considerable time, direct&nbsp;experiments on resistance to crushing and to rubbing and collision&nbsp;have also been made on 673 samples of road materials of all kinds.&nbsp;The coefficients obtained by these experiments, which were found&nbsp;to agree fairly well with those arrived at by actual wear in the roads,&nbsp;are summarized in the following table. The coefficient 20 is equivalent to “excellent,” 10 to “sufficiently good,” and 5 to “bad.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Stone for a new road should be evenly broken to a size that will pass every way through a ring 2⅜ inches in diameter. For repairs,&nbsp;especially when the material is tough, a gauge of 2{ or 2 inches&nbsp;may be used with advantage, as the stone covers a larger surface,&nbsp;consolidates sooner, and makes a smoother surface. Stone is best&nbsp;broken by hand, but stone-breaking machines have been introduced&nbsp;which supersede hand-breaking to some extent, especially where&nbsp;large quantities of hard stone are to be broken. There is always a&nbsp;certain amount of crushing in breaking by a machine, from which&nbsp;softer stones suffer more, and machine-broken stone is never nearly&nbsp;so cubical, uniform in size, or durable as stone well broken by&nbsp;hand. Broken road material contains about 55 per cent, of solid&nbsp;stone to 45 of void space. In a well-consolidated road the void is&nbsp;filled up by small fragments, detritus, and mud, the result of wear,&nbsp;and specimens of good road surfaces weigh from 93 to 95 per cent,&nbsp;of the weight of the solid stone of which they are made.
