            <p>the name <hi rend="italic">hasta pura</hi> ; it is shown on the reverses of many
                Roman coins in the hand of deities and of the emperor or empress, though originally
                the <hi rend="italic">hasta pura</hi> had a very different use, being simply a mark
                of distinction given by Roman generals to soldiers who had shown unusual bravery
                (Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi> iii. 21). After the introduction of Christianity
                as the state religion, the imperial sceptre was frequently tipped with a cross
                instead of the eagle, though both were used. All through the Middle Ages both these
                forms survived, and sceptres of gold studded with jewels were used by most
                sovereigns of Europe. The gold sceptre of Charlemagne, a magnificent specimen of
                early jeweller’s work, still exists among the regalia at Vienna. Some mediaeval
                sceptres were of crystal or ivory mounted in gold. Several fine ancient examples
                existed among the regalia of England till after the death of Charles I., when the
                whole set were broken up and melted by order of the Parliament.</p>
            <p>At the Restoration, four new sceptres were made for the coronation of Charles II.
                (see <hi rend="italic">Archæologia,</hi> xxix. p. 262); and these still exist among
                the regalia in the Tower. They are—(1) the so-called St Edward’s staff of gold, 4
                feet 7 inches long, set with jewels, and surmounted with a cross and orb—a copy of
                the older one which contained in the orb a fragment of the true cross (this sceptre
                is borne in front of the sovereign during the processional part of the ceremony of
                coronation) ; (2) a gold sceptre tipped with a cross, which at the coronation is
                placed in the sovereign’s right hand by the archbishop of Canterbury; (3) a similar
                sceptre tipped with a gold dove, which is placed in the sovereign’s left hand ;@@<hi
                    rend="superscript">l</hi> (4) a small gold jewelled sceptre for the queen
                consort. Nos. (1) and (2) are both studded with diamonds. In addition to these four,
                there is a gold-mounted ivory sceptre, which was made for the queen of James II.; it
                is tipped with a gold dove and is studded with jewels. A sixth gold sceptre is that
                which was made for the queen at the coronation of William and Mary.</p>
            <p>Among the Scottish regalia at Edinburgh a fine 15th- century gold sceptre still
                exists ; and others of the same or earlier date are preserved among the royal
                insignia of several European countries.</p>
            <p>SCHADOW, a distinguished name in the annals of German art.</p>
            <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Johann Gottfried Schadow</hi> (1764-1850), an eminent
                sculptor, was born in 1764 in Berlin, where his father was a poor tailor. His first
                teacher was an inferior sculptor, Tassaert, patronized by Frederick the Great ; the
                master offered his daughter in marriage, but the pupil preferred to elope with a
                girl to Vienna, and the father-in- law not only condoned the offence but furnished
                money wherewith to visit Italy. The young man made the most of advantages which in
                those days fell to the lot of few : he gained in competition a prize for a group of
                Perseus and Andromeda ; three years’ study in Rome formed his style, and in 1788 he
                returned to Berlin to succeed his former master, Tassaert, as sculptor to the court
                and secretary to the Academy. Prussia in rising into a great kingdom had need for
                much sculpture, and Schadow brought timely talent and exceptional training. Over
                half a century, crowded with commissions, he persistently produced upwards of two
                hundred works, varied in style as in subjects. Among his ambitious efforts are
                Frederick the Great in Stettin, Blücher in Rostock, and Luther in Wittenberg. His
                portrait statues include Frederick the Great playing the flute, and the
                crown-princess Louise and</p>
            <p>her sister. His busts, which reach a total of more than one hundred, comprise
                seventeen colossal heads in the Walhalla, Ratisbon ; from the life were modelled
                Goethe, Wieland, and Fichte. Of church monuments and memorial works thirty are
                enumerated ; yet Schadow hardly ranks among Christian sculptors. He is claimed by
                classicists and idealists : the quadriga on the Brandenburger Thor and the
                allegorical frieze on the façade of the Royal Mint, both in Berlin, are judged among
                the happiest growths from the antique. Fauns, nymphs, cupids, and figures of fancy,
                scattered among plain portrait work, kept alive to an advanced age early
                associations formed in Italy. Schadow, as director of the Berlin Academy, gave proof
                of intellectual powers which made him a leader and secured many and devoted
                followers. Personal influence he extended and fortified by his books. He wrote on
                the proportions of the human figure, on national physiognomy, &amp;c. ; and . many
                volumes by himself and others describe and illustrate his method and his work. He
                died, full of honours, at Berlin in 1850.</p>

            <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rudolph Schadow</hi> (1786-1822), sculptor, son of the
                preceding, was born in Rome in 1786. His father, who returned to Berlin in 1788, was
                his first master. Rudolph in 1810 obtained the pension for Rome and received kindly
                help from Canova and Thorwaldsen. His talents were versatile : his first independent
                work was a figure of Paris, and it had for its companion a spinning girl. Following
                the example set by leading German artists then settled in Rome, he exchanged the
                Protestant for the Catholic faith, and gave pledge of his convictions by statues of
                John the Baptist and of the Virgin and Child. In England he became known by
                bas-reliefs executed for the duke of Devonshire and for the marquis of Lansdowne.
                His last composition, commissioned by the king of Prussia, was a colossal group,
                Achilles with the Body of Penthesilea; the model, universally admired for its
                antique character and the largeness of its style, had not been carried out in marble
                when in 1822 the artist died in Rome.</p>
            <p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow</hi> (1789-1862), painter, born
                in 1789 in Berlin, was the second son of Johann Gottfried Schadow the sculptor, from
                whom he received his earliest instruction. In 1806-7 he served as a soldier ; in
                1810 he went with his elder brother Rudolph to Rome. He became one of the leaders
                among the German pre-Raphaelite brethren who eschewed classicism and the Italian
                Renaissance and sought to rebuild Christian art on the principles and practice of
                early and purer times. Following the example of Overbeck and others, he joined the
                Catholic Church, and held that an artist must believe and live out the truths he
                essays to paint. The sequel showed that Schadow was qualified to shine less as a
                painter than as a teacher and director. The Prussian consul, General Bartholdi,
                befriended his young compatriots by giving them a commission to decorate with
                frescos a room 24 feet square in his house on the Pincian Hill. The artists engaged
                were Schadow, Cornelius, Overbeck, and Veit ; the subject selected was the story of
                Joseph and his brethren, and two scenes, the Bloody Coat and Joseph in Prison, fell
                to the lot of Schadow. These well-studied and sound wall-paintings brought renown to
                the brethren, who were further fortified by the friendship of Niebuhr and Bunsen ;
                the former writes— “They are all men of talent,” and “Schadow is particularly
                refined and intellectual.” Schadow was in 1819 appointed professor in the Berlin
                Academy, and his ability and thorough training gained devoted disciples. To this
                period belong pictures for churches. In 1826 the professor was made director of the
                Düsseldorf Academy, and so highly were his character and teachings esteemed that
                some of the best scholars accompanied their master. The</p>
            <p><hi rend="superscript">@@@1</hi> Both these sceptres (or rather the older ones) were
                shown, one in each hand of the fine bronze effigy of Edward III. in Westminster
                Abbey, but as a rule royal effigies were represented with only one sceptre.</p>
