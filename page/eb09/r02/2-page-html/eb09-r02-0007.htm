<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pterygia.</span><span class="font0"> They were, on the contrary, extremely divergent in certain </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dinosauria,</span><span class="font0"> and still more in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ornithosauria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every Reptile has a body composed of organs of nutrition, circulation, respiration, secretion, reproduction,&nbsp;sensation, and motion, supported internally by a solid&nbsp;framework, the internal skeleton or endoskeleton, and&nbsp;enclosed in a firm investment, constituting the external&nbsp;skeleton or exoskeleton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The External Skeleton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The external investment of the body consists of two layers. The outer of these, the epidermal layer, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">epidermis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is of an epithelial horny nature and never becomes bony.&nbsp;The deeper or dermal layer, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dermis,</span><span class="font0"> is a fibrous&nbsp;structure which may become bony. Neither hairs nor&nbsp;feathers are developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The exoskeleton is characterized in this class of animals by being composed of distinct superficial thickenings&nbsp;placed side by side and separated one from another by&nbsp;thinner interspaces. According to the size and form of&nbsp;these thickenings they are known by different names. If&nbsp;they are very small and rounded they are called “tubercles,”&nbsp;and such we see on the body of the Chamseleons and Geckos.&nbsp;If they are large, flat, and not overlapping, they are called&nbsp;shields, and such we see, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> on the head of the true&nbsp;Lizards. If the hinder part of each thickening is more or&nbsp;less prolonged over the anterior part of one or more next&nbsp;behind it, structures of this kind are called scales, such as&nbsp;we find dorsally clothing the bodies of most Lizards and&nbsp;many Serpents. If the median part of each such scale is&nbsp;still more thickened longitudinally, then such a scale is&nbsp;said to be carinate. In most of these cases the epidermis&nbsp;itself is also more or less thickened locally, as well as the&nbsp;subjacent dermis, remaining thin in the folds or interspaces.&nbsp;The dermis may be ossified, forming dense bony plates, or&nbsp;scutes, beneath the epidermal investment. The whole body&nbsp;may be thus clothed, as in the Lizard </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cyclodus</span><span class="font0"> and others,&nbsp;or the bony plates may be confined to parts of the back,&nbsp;as in some Crocodilians. The development of the exoskeleton is carried to the highest degree in Chelonians,&nbsp;when large osseous plates form, in the Land Tortoises and&nbsp;Terrapins, a complete and continuous bony case for the&nbsp;body, invested externally by a rich corneous epidermis,&nbsp;and becoming internally anchylosed with the endoskeleton&nbsp;itself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In most Ophidians the body is clothed with scales above and with large transversely elongated shields beneath&nbsp;(single or double beneath the tail), though the body may&nbsp;be entirely invested by small scales except the head, as in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops,</span><span class="font0"> or by tubercles, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aerochorclus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sometimes, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cerastes</span><span class="font0"> and the River Jack, two horny appendages are erectly developed over the nose&nbsp;and sometimes, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Herpeton tentaculatum,</span><span class="font0"> cutaneous&nbsp;appendages project from the snout, or the snout may be&nbsp;exceptionally produced. The skin of the side of the body&nbsp;just behind the head may form a distensible fold, as in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Naja,</span><span class="font0"> and there may be, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Python,</span><span class="font0"> a claw on each side&nbsp;of the vent, which claw is a rudiment of the pelvic limb,&nbsp;as will be explained in describing the appendicular skeleton.&nbsp;A peculiar cutaneous depression exists between the nostril&nbsp;and the eye in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crotalus</span><span class="font0"> and the other Pit-Vipers. For&nbsp;full details on these subjects see the separate articles on&nbsp;the orders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertilia</span><span class="font0"> we find a number of different cutaneous conditions which have been already noticed&nbsp;in describing the various groups systematically. It will&nbsp;then suffice here to remind the reader that the Amphis-bænians have quadrate shields over the entire body except&nbsp;the head, arranged in transverse rings, and that in such&nbsp;forms as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chaleis</span><span class="font0"> the scales are also verticillate, while in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scincoidea</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anguidæ</span><span class="font0"> they are imbricate, and on&nbsp;the Chamæleons granulate. Tho head may be covered&nbsp;with large shields, as in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertidse,</span><span class="font0"> or with small&nbsp;scales like those of the body, as in the Monitors, and&nbsp;there are often long sharp spines on the head and body,&nbsp;as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grammatophora, Phrynosoma,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moloch.</span><span class="font0"> The integument may also extend out from the body along the&nbsp;back and tail, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Basiliscus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lophura,</span><span class="font0"> or from beneath&nbsp;the throat, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iguana,</span><span class="font0"> or largely across the neck, as in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chlamydosaurus,</span><span class="font0"> or on cither side of the tail, as in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ptychozoon,</span><span class="font0"> or from each side of the body so as to be&nbsp;distensible and to serve as a parachute, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Draco</span><span class="font0"> ; while&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ornithosauria</span><span class="font0"> it passed from the elongated hand to&nbsp;the body and leg as in the wing of the existing Bats. It&nbsp;has also been before stated that in certain cases different&nbsp;genera are distinguished by pores, Le., the apertures of&nbsp;small cutaneous sacs placed on the inner side of each thigh&nbsp;or in front of the cloacal aperture. Folds of skin may&nbsp;invest the digits and constitute webbed feet, as in some&nbsp;Geckos, as well as in Crocodiles and Terrapins, or may&nbsp;bind the digits in two opposite bundles, as in each extremity of the Chamæleons. Normally each digit is terminated by a claw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grocodilia</span><span class="font0"> the epidermal thickenings do not overlap as in some Lizards, but form conspicuous prominences in&nbsp;the dorsal region, w<sup>,</sup>hich serve as specific characters, and&nbsp;which have bony plates beneath,—which plates may, as&nbsp;in Alligators, exist on the belly as well as the back, and&nbsp;may form continuous rings round the tail, those of each&nbsp;anterior row overlapping those of the row next behind.&nbsp;Not all the digits are provided with claws. The feet are&nbsp;webbed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia</span><span class="font0"> present considerable differences as to the exoskeleton. The Mud Tortoises, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx,</span><span class="font0"> have a soft&nbsp;epidermis, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis</span><span class="font0"> has a coriaceous outer layer of&nbsp;integument covering a carapace divided into small sub-hexagonal shields. In the other Chelonians there are large&nbsp;epidermal shields, which may overlap, as in the Tortoiseshell Turtle (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. imbricata)</span><span class="font0"> and others, or may be conterminous, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Emys.</span><span class="font0"> These shields form a&nbsp;mid-dorsal series and two lateral rows on either side, while&nbsp;there are two longitudinal series on the ventral side of the&nbsp;body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Beneath the epidermal layer of the integument osseous plates are found, which plates do not coincide either in</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
