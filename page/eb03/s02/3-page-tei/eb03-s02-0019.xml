It was plain, from the words of this manifeſto, that Henry was ſtill placable towards James; and that he would eaſily have dropt that claim, if his nephew would have made any perſonal advances towards a reconciliation.</p><p>The condition of James was now deplorable. The few faithful counſellors he had about him, ſuch as Kirkaldy of Grange, who was then lord treaſurer, plainly intimated, that he could have no dependence upon his nobles, as he was devoted to the clergy; and James, ſometimes, in a fit of diſtraction, would draw his dagger upon the cardinal and other eccleſiaſtics when they came to him with freſh propoſitions of murder and proſcriptions, and drive them out of his preſence. But he had no conſtancy of mind; and he certainly put into his pocket a bloody ſcroll that had been brought him by his prieſts, beginning with the earl of Arran, the  firſt fubject of the kingdom. In one of his cooler moments, he appointed the lord Erſkine, and ſome others of his nobility, to make a freſh attempt to gain time; and Henry even condeſcended to order the duke of Norfolk (who was then advanced as far as York), the lord privy ſeal, the biſhop of Durham, and others, to treat with him. The conferences were ſhort and unſucceſsſul. The duke bitterly complained, that the Scots ſought only to amuſe him till the ſeaſon for action was over. In ſhort, he conſidered both them and Learmouth, who was ordered to attend him, as ſo many ſpies, and treated them accordingly. It was the 21ſt of October before he entered the eaſt borders of Scotland. According to the Scotch hiſtorians, his army conſiſted of 40,000 men; but the Engliſh have fixed it at 20,000.</p><p>James affected to complain oſ this invaſion as being unprovoked; but he loſt no time in preparing to repel the danger. The ſituation of his nobility, who were preſſed by a foreign invaſion on the one hand, and domeſtic tyrants on the other, induced them to hold frequent conſultations; and in one of them, they reſolved to renew the ſcene that had been acted at Lawder bridge under James III. by hanging all his grandſon’s evil counſellors. The Scots hiſtorians ſay, that this reſolution was not executed, becauſe the nobility could not agree about the victims that were, to be ſacrificed; and that the king, who was encamped with his army at Fallamoor, having intelligence of their conſultation, removed haſtily to Edinburgh; from which he ſent orders for his army to advance, and give battle to the duke of Norfolk, who appears as yet not to have entered the Scotch borders. The anſwer of the nobility was, that they were determined not to attack the duke upon Engliſh ground; but that if he invaded Scotland, they knew their duty. The earl of Huntley, who commanded the van of the Scottiſh army, conſiſting of  10,000 men, was of the ſame opinion: but no ſooner did Norfolk paſs the Tweed, than he haraſſed the Engliſh army, cut off their foraging parties, and diſtreſſed them in ſuch a manner, that the duke agreed once more to a conference for peace; which was managed, on the part of the Scots, by the biſhop of Orkney and Sir James Learmouth; but nothing was con</p><p>cluded. The Engliſh general, finding it now impoſſible on many accounts to proſecute his invaſion, repaſſed the Tweed; and was haraſſed in his march by the earl of Huntley, who deſiſted from the purſuit the moment his enemies gained Engliſh ground.</p><p>James, whoſe army at this time amounted to above 30,000 men, continued ſtill at Edinburgh, from which he ſent frequent meſſages to order his nobility and generals to follow the duke of Norfolk into England; but theſe were diſregarded. James was flattered, that now he had it in his power to be revenged for all the indignities that had been offered by England to Scotland. In this he was encouraged by the French ambaſſador, and the high opinion he had of his own troops. About the beginning of November, he came to a reſolution of reaſſembling his army, which was disbanded upon the duke of Norfolk’s retreat. This project appeared ſo feaſible and ſo promiſing, that ſeveral of the nobility are ſaid to have fallen in with it, particularly the lord Maxwell, the earls of Arran, Caſſils, and Glencairn, with the lords Fleming, Somerville, and Erſkine: others repreſented, but in vain, that the arms of Scotland had already gained ſufficient honour, by obliging the powerful army of the Engliſh, with their moſt experienced general at their head, to make a ſhameful retreat before a handful; that the force of Scotland was inferior to that of England; and that an honourable peace was ſtill practicable. It was ſaid, in reply to thoſe conſiderations, that the ſtate of the quarrel was now greatly altered; that Henry had in his manifeſto declared his intention to enſlave their country; that he treated the nobility as his vaſſals; that the duke of Norfolk had been guilty of burning the dwellings of the deſenceleſs inhabitants, by laying above 20 villages and towns in aſhes; and that no Scotchman, who was not corrupted by Henry’s gold, would oppoſe the king’s will. The laſt, perhaps, was the chief argument that prevailed on the lord Maxwell, a nobleman of great honour and courage, to agree to carry the war into England by Solway, provided he was at the head of 10,000 men. It was at laſt agreed that the earl of Arran and the cardinal ſhould openly raiſe men, as if they intended to enter the eaſt marches, where they were to make only a feint, while the lord Maxwell was to make the real attempt upon the weſt. Private letters were everywhere circulated to raiſe the men who were to ſerve under the lord Maxwell; among whom were the earls of Caſſils and Glencairn, the lords Fleming, Somerville, Erſkine, and many other persons of great conſideration. James, who never was ſuſpected of want of courage, probably would have put himſelf at the head of this expedition, had he not been diſſuaded from it by his prieſts and minions, who reminded him of the conſultations at Fallamoor, and the other treaſonable practices of the nobility. They added, that moſt of them being corrupted by the Engliſh gold, he could not be too much on his guard. He was at laſt perſuaded to repair to the caſtle of Lochmaben or Carlaverock, and there to wait the iſſue of the inroad.</p><p>It was probably at this place that James was prevailed on to come to the fatal reſolution of appointing one Oliver Sinclair, a ſon of the houſe of Roſlin, and a favourite minion at court, to command the army in chief; and his commiſſion was made out accordingly.</p></body></text></TEI>
