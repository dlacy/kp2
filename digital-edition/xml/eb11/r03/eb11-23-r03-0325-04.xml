<p><label>RIEVAULX</label>
a village in the North Riding of Yorkshire, England, 3 m. W. by N. of the small town of Helmsley, which is served by a branch of the North-Eastern railway. Here, exquisitely situated in a deep wooded valley, are the ruins of Rievaulx Abbey, a foundation by Walter LEspec in 1131 for Cistercians. The principal remains are those of the cruciform church, mainly Early English in date, and of the finest workmanship. There are considerable fragments of the refectory, and all the important domestic huildings may be traced. A beautiful prospect over the ruins and the valley is seen from the terrace on the eastern flanking hill.</p>
