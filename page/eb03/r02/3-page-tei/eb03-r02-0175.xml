Cleopatra, however, was upon her guard, and wouid not confer with Proculus, except through the gate, which was well ſecured. In the mean time, while he deſignedly drew out the conference to ſome length, and had given Gallus,one of his fellow-ſoldiers, directions to carry on the converſation in his abſence, he entered with two more by the window at which Antony had been drawn up. As ſoon as he was entered, he ran down to the gate ; and one of the women crying out, that they were taken alive, Cleopatra, perceiving what had happened, drew a poniard, and attempted to ftab herſelf ; but Proculus prevented the blow, and gently remonſtrated that ſhe was cruel in refuſing ſo good a prince as his maſter was the pleaſure of diſplaying his clemency. He then forced the poniard out of her hand, and examined her clothes to be certain ſhe had no poiſon about her. Thus leaving every thing ſecured, he went to acquaint his maſter with his proceedings.</p><p>Octavianus was extremely pleaſed at finding her in his power : he ſent Epaphroditus to bring her to his palace, and to watch her with the utmoſt circumſpec-tion. He was likewiſe ordered to uſe her, in every reſpect, with that deference and ſubmiſſion which were due to her rank, and to do every thing in his power to render her captivity agreeable. She was permitted to have the honour of granting Antony the rites of burial, and furniſhed with every thing ſhe deſired, that was becoming his dignity to receive, or her love to offer. Yet ſtill ſhe languiſhed under her new confinement. Her exceſſive ſorrow, her many loſſes, and the blows ſhe had given her boſom, produced a fever which ſhe ſeemed willing to increaſe. She reſolved to abſtain from taking any nouriſhment, under the pretence of a regimen neceſſary for her diſorder ; but Octavianus being made acquainted with the real motive by her phyſician, began to threaten her with regard to her children, in caſe ſhe perſiſted. This was the only puniſhment that could now affect her ; ſhe allowed herſelf to be treated as they thought proper, and received whatever was preſcribed for her recovery.</p><p>In the mean time Octavianus made his entry into Alexandria ; taking care to mitigate the fears of the inhabitants, by converſing familiarly as he went along with Areus, a philoſopher, and a native of the place. The citizens, however, trembled at his approach ; and when he placed himſelf upon the tribunal, they pro-ſtrated themſelves, with they· faces to the ground, before him, like criminals who waited the ſentence of their execution. Octavianus preſently ordered them to riſe; telling them, that three motives induced him to pardon them : His reſpect for Alexander, who was the founder of their city ; his admiration of its beauty ; and his friendſhip for Areus, their fellow-citizen. Two only of particular note were put to death upon this occaſion ; Antony’s eldeſt ſon Antyllus, and Cæſario, the ſon of Julius Cæſar ; both betrayed into his hands by their respective tutors, who themſelves ſuffered for their perfidy ſhortly after. As for the reſt of Cleopatra’s children, he treated them with great gentleneſs, leaving them to the care of thoſe who were entruſted with their education, who had orders to provide them with every thing ſuitable to their birth. When ſhe was recovered from her late indiſpoſition, he came to viſit her in perſon.— Cleopatra had been preparing for this interview, and</p><p>made uſe of every method ſhe could think, of to propi-' tiate the conqueror, and to gain his affection ; but in vain. However, at his departure, Octavianus imagined that he had reconciled her to life, and to the indignity of being ſhown in the intended triumph, which he was preparing for on his return to Rome: but in this he was deceived, Cleopatra, all this time, had kept a correſpondence with Dolabella, a young Roman of high birth, in the camp of Octavianus ; who, perhaps, from compaſſion, or ſtronger motives, was intereſted in the misfortunes of that princeſs. From him ſhe learnt the intentions of Octavianus, and that he was determined to ſend her off in three days, together with her children, to Rome. She now therefore determined upon dying; but previouſly intreated permiſſion to pay her oblations at Antony’s tomb. This requeſt being granted her, ſhe was carried with her two female attendants to the ſtately monument where he was laid. There ſhe threw herſelf upon his coffin, bewailed her captivity, and renewed her proteſtations not to ſurvive him. She then crowned the tomb with garlands of flowers ; and having kiſſed the coffin a thouſand times, ſhe returned home to execute her fatal reſolution. Having bathed, and ordered a ſumptuous banquet, ſhe attired herſelf in the moſt ſplendid manner. She then feaſted as uſual ; and ſoon after ordered all but her two attendants, Charmi-on and Iras, to leave the room. Then, having previouſly ordered an aſp to be ſecretly conveyed to her in a bafl&lt;et of fruit, ſhe ſent a letter to Octavianus, informing him of her fatal purpoſe, and deſiring to be buried in the ſame tomb with Antony. Octavianus, upon receiving this letter, inſtantly diſpatched meſſengers to prevent her, but they arrived too late. Upon entering the chamber, they beheld Cleopatra lying dead upon a gilded couch, arrayed in her royal robes. Near her,</p><p>Iras, one of her faithful attendants, was ſtretched liſeleſs at the ſeet of her miſtreſs : and Charmion herſelf, almoſt expiring, was ſettling the diadem upon Cleopatra’s head. She died at the age of thirty-nine, after having-reigned twenty-two years. Her death put an end to the monarchy in Egypt, which had flouriſhed there from time immemorial.</p><p>Octavianus ſeemed much troubled at Cleopatra’s death, as it deprived him of a principal ornament in his intended triumph. However, the manner of it a good deal exalted her character among the Romans, with whom ſuicide was conſidered as a virtue. Her dying requeſt was complied with, her body being laid by Antony’s, and a magnificent funeral prepared for her and her two faithful attendants.</p><p>After having ſettled the affairs of Egypt, he leſt Alexandria in the beginning of September, in the year of Rome 720, with a deſign to return through Syria, Aſia Minor, and Greece, to Italy. On his arrival at Antioch, he found there Tiridates, who had been raiſed to the throne of Parthia in oppoſition to Phrahates, and likewiſe ambaſſadors from Phrahates, who were all come on the ſame errand ; to wit, to ſolicit the aſſiſtance of the Romans againſt each other. Octavianus gave a friendly anſwer both to Tiridates and the ambaſſadors of Phrahates, without intending to help either ; but rather with a deſign to animate the one againſt the other, and by that means to weaken both, ſo far as to render the Parthian name no longer formidable to Rome. After this, having appointed Meſſala</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
