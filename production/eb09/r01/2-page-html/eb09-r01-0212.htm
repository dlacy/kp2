<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">grew up. Of these, Thomas, the second, died in 1846 ; William, the third, went to India in the Civil Service, and died some years&nbsp;before his father (1819) ;@@<sup>1</sup> Jane, the eldest, married Captain Rodd,&nbsp;afterwards Yice-Admiral Sir John Tremayne Rodd, K.C.B., and&nbsp;survived both her brothers, dying in 1863. It was through Lady&nbsp;Rodd’s active filial zeal that Rennell’s posthumous works were published, including, besides the two already named, a second edition&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herodotus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What has been said in the enumeration of his writings sufficiently shows how laboriously he worked. But to this great industry were&nbsp;joined in all his works sagacity, excellent judgment, and a love&nbsp;of truth which made him never ashamed to confess a difficulty,&nbsp;and always ready to do justice to other writers. The man whom&nbsp;we find already at fourteen serving as a midshipman in time of war&nbsp;could have grown up with little instruction but what he sought, and&nbsp;found for himself, in the course of his career. On many of the subjects on which he wrote, fresh light has been so abundant that the&nbsp;value of his works as guides has in great measure passed away, yet&nbsp;even now no one can deal with Herodotus or Xenophon without consulting Rennell’s views, directly or indirectly. Obliged to depend, as&nbsp;regards the former, for his text on the inaccurate translation of&nbsp;Beloe, it has been shown that Rennell’s sagacity often discerned&nbsp;the true meaning of the historian when his interpreter had gone&nbsp;astray. What he did for the geography of India, not by his own&nbsp;surveys merely, but by his labour on the often remoulded </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Memoir,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in coordinating the information gathered during forty years, may&nbsp;be best appreciated by a comparison of the celebrated D’Anville’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Éclaircissemens Géographiques sur la Carte de VInde</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1753) with&nbsp;the final edition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Memoir</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1793). Putting aside the great&nbsp;additions to positive knowledge which favoured the later writer,&nbsp;we are mistaken if the perusal of both works will not leave the impression that, in most of the qualities of a geographer, Rennell’s&nbsp;place is not in any respect behind that of the famous Frenchman,&nbsp;for whom he himself always entertained and expressed the deepest&nbsp;respect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We conclude with an extract from a tribute to his memory which appeared in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Times</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the day after his funeral in the Abbey:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“Another characteristic of this amiable philosopher was the generous facility with which he imparted his stores of learning in conversation. A memory&nbsp;remarkably tenacious, and so well arranged as to be equally ready for the reception or for the distribution of knowledge, made him a depository of facts to which&nbsp;few ever applied in vain; adapting himself to the level of all who consulted him,&nbsp;he had the happy art of correcting their errors without hurting their feelings,&nbsp;and of leading them to truth without convicting them of ignorance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Till Rennell’s time it could hardly be said that England could boast of any geographer of the first class. His pre-eminence in that&nbsp;character is still undisputed, like that of D’Anville in France, and&nbsp;of Ritter in Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this sketch of Rennell’s career, use has been made of a mass of letters addressed, during his service in the navy and in India, to the Rev. G. Burlington,&nbsp;kindly lent by Hr C. Langley of Chudleigh ; of papers courteously communicated&nbsp;by Rennell’s descendants; of the “Memorials” quoted above; and of India&nbsp;Office records ; supplemented by a good deal of other research.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RENNES, a town of France, formerly the capital of Brittany and now the chief town of the department of&nbsp;Ille-et-Yilaine, is situated at the meeting of the Ille and&nbsp;the Vilaine and at the junction of several lines of railway&nbsp;connecting it with Paris (232 miles east-north-east), St&nbsp;Malo (51 miles north), Brest (147 west-north-west), Ac.&nbsp;It is the seat of an archbishop and the headquarters of&nbsp;the 10th corps d’armée (with a large arsenal and barracks). For the most part rebuilt on a regular plan&nbsp;since the seven days’ fire of 1720, the town is rendered&nbsp;more monotonous by the houses being of dark-coloured&nbsp;granite and nearly all after the same type. Of trade&nbsp;and industry there is little trace in the dull and deserted streets. The main portion of the old town occupies a hill which looks down on the confluence of the&nbsp;streams. Along the north side flows the Vilaine in a deep&nbsp;hollow bordered with quays and crossed by four bridges&nbsp;leading to the new town near the railway station. The&nbsp;canalized Ille forms the first section of the Ille and Ranee&nbsp;Canal which unites St Malo to Rennes, and then descends&nbsp;the Vilaine to Redon, and the canal from Nantes to Brest.&nbsp;The cathedral of Rennes is rebuilt in a pseudo-ionic style&nbsp;on the site of two churches dating originally from the&nbsp;4th century. The archbishop’s palace occupies in part&nbsp;the site of the abbey of St Melaine, whose church is the&nbsp;sole specimen in the town of 11-13th century architecture. A colossal statue of the Virgin was placed above&nbsp;the dome of this church in 1867. In the palace is preserved the old altar screen from the cathedral, perhaps the&nbsp;finest in all France. The Mordelaise Gate, by which the&nbsp;dukes and bishops used to make their state entry into the&nbsp;town, is a curious example of 15th century architecture,&nbsp;and accidentally preserves a Latin inscription of the 3d&nbsp;century, a dedication by the Redones to the emperor&nbsp;Gordianus. Architecturally the finest building in the&nbsp;town is the old parliament house (now the court-house),&nbsp;designed by Jacques Debrosse in the 17th century, and&nbsp;decorated with statues of legal celebrities, carved work,&nbsp;and paintings by Coypel and Jouvenet. The town-house&nbsp;was erected in the first half of the 18th century by&nbsp;Gabriel, the architect· of the Place de la Concorde in Paris.&nbsp;In the modern building occupied by the faculties of law,&nbsp;science, and literature there are scientific collections of&nbsp;various kinds, and one of the finest picture galleries outside of Paris, with pieces by Paul Veronese, Tintoretto,&nbsp;Vandyck, Rembrandt, Rubens, Ac., and sketches by&nbsp;Michelangelo, Titian, and other great masters. The town&nbsp;library contains 50,000 volumes and 220 MSS.; and the&nbsp;municipal archives are of primary importance for the&nbsp;history of Brittany. The Promenade du Thabor, with a&nbsp;statue of Duguesclin, the adjoining botanic gardens, the&nbsp;Promenade de la Motte a little lower down, and the Mail,&nbsp;a fine avenue planted in 1657 by the duke of Chaulnes,&nbsp;add greatly to the beauty of Rennes. About 2 miles&nbsp;from the town is the castle of La Prévalaye. The local&nbsp;industries are varied but not extensive. The population&nbsp;of the town in 1881 numbered 57,430; that of the commune 60,974.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rennes, the chief city of the Redones, was formerly (like some other places in Gaul) called Condate (hence </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Condat,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Condé), probably from its position at the confluence of two streams. Under the&nbsp;Roman empire it was included in Lugdunensis Tertia, and became&nbsp;the centre of various Roman roads still recognizable in the vicinity.&nbsp;The name </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Urbs Rubra</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> given to it in the oldest chroniclers is&nbsp;explained by the bands of red brick still found in the foundations&nbsp;of its first circuit of walls. In 843 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Nornenoé, Charles the&nbsp;Bald’s lieutenant, declared himself independent and took the title&nbsp;of king of the Bretons ; but the country was afterwards torn to&nbsp;pieces by the struggles of the various counts who wished to make&nbsp;themselves masters of it and by the invasions of the Normans.&nbsp;About the close of the 10th century Conan le Tort, count of Rennes,&nbsp;subdued the whole province, and it was his son and successor&nbsp;Geoffrey who first took the title duke of </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Brittany </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q. v.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> ). It was at&nbsp;Rennes the dukes were crowned, and before entering the city by the&nbsp;Mordelaise Gate they had to swear to preserve the privileges of the&nbsp;church, the nobles, and the commons of Brittany. During the War&nbsp;of Succession the city was captured by Jean de Montfort in 1341,&nbsp;by Charles of Blois in 1342, and again by Jean de Montfort.&nbsp;During the troubles of the League the duke of Mercœur attempted&nbsp;to make himself independent at Rennes (1589), but his scheme was&nbsp;defeated by the loyalty of the local parliament. Henry IV.&nbsp;entered the city in state on May 9, 1598. An insurrection at&nbsp;Rennes caused by the taxes imposed by Louis XIV., in spite of&nbsp;the advice of the parliament, was cruelly suppressed by the duke&nbsp;of Chaulnes, governor of the province. The parliament was&nbsp;banished to Vannes till 1689, and the inhabitants crushed with&nbsp;forfeits and in great numbers put to death. The fire of 1720&nbsp;which destroyed eight hundred houses completed the ruin of the&nbsp;town. During the last year of the monarchy Rennes more than&nbsp;once resisted the imposition of taxes not authorized by the states&nbsp;of Brittany. In 1765 the celebrated procureur-général La Chalotais&nbsp;was imprisoned, and in 1788 the parliament was suspended from&nbsp;May to October. At the commencement of the Revolution Rennes&nbsp;was again the scene of bloodshed caused by the discussion about&nbsp;doubling the third estate for the convocation of the states-general.&nbsp;On January 26, 1789, the students, with Moreau (afterwards general)&nbsp;at their head, broke into the hall where the nobles satin council in&nbsp;defiance of the decree of suspension issued against them by the&nbsp;Government. During the Reign of Terror Rennes suffered less than&nbsp;Nantes, partly through the courage and uprightness of the mayor&nbsp;Leperdit. It was soon afterwards the centre of the operations of&nbsp;the republican army against La Vendée. After the 10 th of&nbsp;Brumaire it was accused of royalism and put to ransom by Brune.&nbsp;Besides La Chalotais, Gerbier the advocate and Admiral De la&nbsp;Motte-Picquet were born at Rennes.</span></p>
