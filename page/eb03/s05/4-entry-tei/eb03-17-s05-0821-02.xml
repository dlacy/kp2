a pain occaſioned by the violent extension of ſome membranous or tendinous part.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Strain,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Stress,</hi> in mechanics, are terms indiſcriminately uſed to express the force which is <hi rend="italic">excited</hi> in any part of a machine or ſtructure of any kind tending to break it in that part. Thus every part of a rope is <hi rend="italic">equally</hi> ſtrained by the weight which it ſuspends. Every part of a pillar is <hi rend="italic">equally</hi> ſtrained by the load which it ſupports. A mill axle is <hi rend="italic">equally</hi> twiſted and ſtrained in every part which lies between the part of the wheel actuated by the moving power and the part which is reſiſted by the work to be performed. Every part of a lever or joiſt is <hi rend="italic">differently</hi> ſtrained by a force acting on a diſtant part.</p><p>It is evident that we cannot make the ſtructure fit for its purpoſe, unleſs the ſtrength in every part be at least equal to the ſtreſs laid on, or the ſtrain excited in that part. It is no leſs plain, that if we are ignorant of the principles which determine this ſtrain, both in intensity and direction, in relation to the magnitude and the ſituation of its remote cauſe, the only ſecurity we have for ſucceſs is to give to every part of the aſſem-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0828.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0822"/>
blage ſuch ſolidity that we can leave no doubt of its ſufficiency. But daily experience ſhows us that this vague ſecurity is in many caſes uncertain, if we are thus ignorant. In all caſes it is ſlovenly, unlike an artiſt, attended with uſeleſs expence, and in machines is attended with a loss of power which is waſted in changing the motions of a needleſs load of matter.</p><p>It muſt therefore greatly tend to the improvement of all profeſſions occupied in the erection or employment of ſuch ſtructures to have a diſtinct notion of the ſtrains to which their parts are expoſed. Frequently, nay generally, theſe ſtrains are not immediate, but ariſe from the action of forces on diſtant parts, by which the aſſemblage is ſtrained, and there is a tendency to rupture in every part. This ſtrain is <hi rend="italic">induced</hi> on every part, and is there modified by fixed mechanical laws. Theſe it is our buſineſs to learn ; but our chief object in this inveſtigation is to determine the ſtrength of materials which it is neceſſary to oppoſe in every part to this ſtrain ; and how to oppoſe this ſtrength in ſuch a manner that it ſhall be exerted to the beſt advantage. The notions of ſtrain and ſtrength therefore hardly admit of ſeparation; for it is even by means of the ſtrength of the intermediate parts that the ſtrain is propagated to, or excited in, the part under conſideration. It is proper therefore to conſider the whole together under the article <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Strength</hi> <hi rend="italic">of Materials</hi> in mechanics.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
