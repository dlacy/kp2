<p><span class="font2">made him commandant of Kassa, and was elected prince of Transylvania on the 26th of November 1630 by the diet of&nbsp;Segesvár. He followed the policy of Gabriel Bethlen, based&nbsp;on the maintenance of the political and religious liberties of the&nbsp;Hungarians. His alliance with Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden&nbsp;for that purpose was no secret at Vienna, where the court&nbsp;estimated at their right value Rákóczy’s hypocritical assurances&nbsp;of pacific amity. On the 2nd of February 1644, at the solicitation of the Swedish and French ambassadors, and with the&nbsp;consent of the Porte, he declared war against the Emperor&nbsp;Ferdinand III. Nearly the whole of imperial Hungary was&nbsp;soon in his hands, and Ferdinand, hardly pressed by the Swedes&nbsp;at the same time, was compelled to conclude (Sept. 16, 1645)&nbsp;with Rákóczy the peace of Linz, which accorded full religious&nbsp;liberty to the Magyars, and ceded to Rákóczy the fortress of&nbsp;Regéc and the Tokaj district. On the death of Wladislaus IV.&nbsp;(1648) Rákóczy aimed at the Polish throne also, but died before&nbsp;he could accomplish his design. His capital, Gyula Fehérvár,&nbsp;was a great Protestant resort and asylum.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">George II., prince of Transylvania (1621-1660), was the eldest son of George I. and Susannah Lorántffy.

On ascending the throne&nbsp;(Oct. 11</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">,</span><span class="font2"> 1648), his first thought was to realize his father’s&nbsp;Polish ambitions. With this object in view, he allied himself,&nbsp;in the beginning of 1649, with the Cossack hetman, Bohdan&nbsp;Chmielnicki, and the hospodars of Moldavia and Wallachia.&nbsp;It was not, however, till 1657, as the ally of Gustavus Adolphus,&nbsp;that he led a rabble of 40, 000 semi-savages against the Polish&nbsp;king, John Casimir. He took Cracow and entered Warsaw&nbsp;with the Swedes, but the moment his allies withdrew the&nbsp;whole scheme collapsed, and it was only on the most humiliating&nbsp;terms that the Poles finally allowed him to return to Transylvania. Here (Nov. 3, 1657) the diet, at the command of the&nbsp;Porte, deposed him for undertaking an unauthorized war, but&nbsp;in January 1658 he was reinstated by the Medgyes Diet. Again&nbsp;he was deposed by the grand vizier, and again reinstated as&nbsp;if nothing had happened, but all in vain. The Turks again&nbsp;invaded Transylvania, and Rákóczy died at Nagyvárad of the&nbsp;wounds received at the battle of Gyula (May 1660).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Francis I., prince of Transylvania (1645-1676), was the only son of George Rákóczy II. and Sophia Báthory. He was elected&nbsp;prince of Transylvania during his father’s lifetime (Feb. 18,&nbsp;1652), but lost both crown and father at the same time, and&nbsp;withdrew to the family estates, where, at Patak and Makovica,&nbsp;he kept a splendid court. His mother converted him to&nbsp;Catholicism, and on the 1st of March 1666 he married Helen&nbsp;Zrinyi. In 1670 he was implicated in the Zrinyi-Frangepán&nbsp;conspiracy, and only saved his life by the interposition of the&nbsp;Jesuits on the payment of an enormous ransom.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Francis II., prince of Transylvania (1676-1735), was bom at Borsi, Zemplén county, on the 27th of March 1676. Having&nbsp;lost his father during infancy, he was educated under the&nbsp;guardianship of his heroic mother, Helen Zrinyi, in an ultra-patriotic Magyar environment, though the Emperor Leopold I.&nbsp;claimed a share in his tutelage. In 1682 his mother wedded&nbsp;Imre Thököly, who took no part in the education of Rákóczy,&nbsp;but used him for his political purposes. Unfortunately his&nbsp;stepfather’s speculations suffered shipwreck, and Rákóczy lost&nbsp;the greater part of his estates. It is said that the imperialists&nbsp;robbed him of 1, 000, 000 florins’ worth of plate and supported&nbsp;a whole army corps out of his revenues (1683-85). As a child&nbsp;of twelve he witnessed the heroic defence by his mother of&nbsp;his ancestral castle of Munkács against Count Antonio Caraffa&nbsp;(d. 1693). On its surrender (Jan. 7, 1688) the child was&nbsp;transferred to Vienna that he might be isolated from the&nbsp;Hungarian nation aud brought </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">up </span><span class="font2">as an Austrian magnate.&nbsp;Cardinal Kollonics, the sworn enemy of Magyar separatism,&nbsp;now became his governor, and sent him to the Jesuit college&nbsp;at Neuhaus in Bohemia. In 1690 he completed his course at&nbsp;Prague, and in 1694 he married Maria Amelia of Hesse-Rheinfels, and lived for the next few years on his Hungarian estates.&nbsp;At this time Rákóczy’s birth, rank, wealth and brilliant&nbsp;qualities made him the natural leader of the Magyar nation,&nbsp;and his name was freely used in all the insurrections of the&nbsp;period, though at first he led a life of the utmost circumspection (1697-1700). Hungary was then regarded at Vienna as a&nbsp;conquered realm, whose naturally rebellious inhabitants could&nbsp;only be kept under by force of arms. Kollonics was the supreme&nbsp;ruler of the kingdom, and his motto was “ Make of the Magyar&nbsp;first a slave, then a beggar, and then a Catholic. ” It was a&nbsp;matter of h*fe or death for the Magyars to resist such a reign of&nbsp;terror and save the national independence by making Hungary&nbsp;independent of Austria as heretofore. Rákóczy and a few&nbsp;other patriotic magnates deeply sympathized with the sufferings of the nation, and on the eve of the war of the Spanish&nbsp;Succession they entered into correspondence with Louis XIV.&nbsp;for assistance through one Longueval, a Belgian general in&nbsp;the Austrian service, who professed to be a friend of the&nbsp;Rákóczyans, who initiated him into all their secrets. Longueval&nbsp;betrayed his trust, and Rákóczy was arrested and imprisoned&nbsp;at Eperjes. His wife saved him from certain death by enabling&nbsp;him to escape to Poland in the uniform of a dragoon officer.&nbsp;On the 18th of June 1703 he openly took up arms against the&nbsp;emperor, most of whose troops were now either on the Rhine&nbsp;or in upper Italy; but, unfortunately, the Magyar gentry&nbsp;stood aloof from the rising, and his ill-supported peasant levies&nbsp;(the Kuruczes) were repeatedly scattered. Yet at first he had&nbsp;some success, and on the 26th of September was able to write&nbsp;to Louis XIV. that the whole kingdom up to the Danube was&nbsp;in his power. He also issued his famous manifesto, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Recrudescunt&nbsp;υulnera inclytae gentis Hungariae,</span><span class="font2"> to justify himself in the eyes&nbsp;of Europe. The battle of Blenheim made any direct help&nbsp;from France impossible, and on the 13th of June 1704 his&nbsp;little army of 7000 men was routed by the imperialists at&nbsp;Koronco and subsequently at Nagyszombat. Want of arms,&nbsp;money, native officers and infantry, made, indeed, any permanent success in the open field impossible. Nevertheless, in&nbsp;May 1705, when the Emperor Leopold I. was succeeded by&nbsp;Joseph I., the position of Rákóczy was at least respectable.&nbsp;With the aid of several eminent French officers and engineers&nbsp;he had drilled his army into some degree of efficiency, and had&nbsp;at his disposal 52 horse and 31 foot regiments. Even after the&nbsp;rout of Pudmerics (Aug. 11, 1705), he could put </span><span class="font0">I00, 000&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">men in the field. In September 1705 he was also able to hold&nbsp;a diet at Szécsény, attended by many nobles and some prelates,&nbsp;to settle the government of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rákóczy, who had already been elected Prince of Transylvania (July 6, 1704), now surrounded himself with a council of state of 24 members. The religious question caused him&nbsp;especial difficulty. An ardent Catholic himself, nine-tenths&nbsp;of his followers were nevertheless stem Calvinists, and in his&nbsp;efforts to secure them toleration he alienated the pope, who&nbsp;dissuaded Louis XIV. from assisting him. Peace negotiations&nbsp;with the emperor during 1705 came to nothing, because the&nbsp;court of Vienna would not acknowledge the independence of&nbsp;Transylvania, while France refused to recognize the rebels&nbsp;officially till they had formally proclaimed the deposition of&nbsp;the Habsburgs, which last desperate measure was actually&nbsp;accomplished by the Ónod diet on the 13th of June 1707. This&nbsp;was a fatal mistake, for it put an end to any hope of a compromise, and alienated both the emperor’s foreign allies and the</span></p>
