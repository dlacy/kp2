<p><span class="font1">mony that reigned between them and the people, thought it expedient to create a dictator. The two&nbsp;conſuls were therefore impαwersd to name one of themſelves to that dignity ; whereupon Virginius readily&nbsp;yielded it to his colleague Poſthumius, as the more able&nbsp;commander. The new dictator, having created Æbutius Elva his general of the horſe, and divided his army&nbsp;into four bodies, left one ol them, under the command&nbsp;of Sempronius, to guard the city ; and with the other&nbsp;three, commanded by himſelf, Virginius, and Æbutius, marched out againſt the Latins, who, with an&nbsp;army of 40,000 foot and 30c0 horſe, under the command of f&gt;extus Tarquinius, Titus Tarquinius, and&nbsp;Mamilius, had already made themſe lves maſters of Corbin, a ſtrong-hold belonging to the republic, and put&nbsp;the garriſcn to the ſword. Poſthumius encamped in&nbsp;the night on a ſteep hill near the lake Rεgillus, and&nbsp;Virginius on another hill over-againſt him. Æbutius&nbsp;was ordered to march ſilently in the night, with the&nbsp;cavalry and light-armed infantry, to take poiſeſſion of&nbsp;a third hill upon the road, by which proviſions muſt be&nbsp;brought to the Latins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before Æbutius had fortified his new camp, he was vigorouſly attacked by Lucius Tarquinius, whom he&nbsp;rcpulſed three times with great loſs, the dictator having ſent him a timely reinforcement. After this, Æ-butius intercepted two couriers ſent by the Volſci to&nbsp;the Latin generals, and, by letters found upon them,&nbsp;diſcovered, that a conſiderable army of the Volſci and&nbsp;Hernici were to join the Latin forces in three days.&nbsp;Upon this intelligence, Poſthumius drew his three bodies of troops together, which amounted in all to no&nbsp;more than 24,000 toot and ιcoo horſe, with a deſign&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font1">engage the enemy before the arrival of the ſuccours&nbsp;they expected. Accordingly he encouraged his men,&nbsp;and, with his army in battle-array, advanced to the&nbsp;piâce where the enemy was encamped. '1 he Latins,&nbsp;who were much ſuperior to the Romans in numbers,&nbsp;and beſides began to want proviſions, did not decline the&nbsp;engagement. Titus Tarquinius, at the head of the&nbsp;Roman exiles and deſertcrs, was in the centre, Mami-hſis in the right wing, and Sextus Tarquinius in the&nbsp;left. In the Roman army the dictator commanded in&nbsp;the centre, Æbutius in the left wing, and Virginius in&nbsp;the right.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The firſt body which advanced was that of the dictator ; and, as ſoon as it began to march, T. Tarquinius, ſinglmg out the dictator, ran full ſpeed againſt him. The dictator did not decline the encounter, but,&nbsp;iiying at his adverſary, wounded him with a javelin in&nbsp;the right </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ide. Upon this, the firſt line of the Latins&nbsp;advanced to cover their general ; but he being carried&nbsp;out of the field, they made but a faint reſiſtance when&nbsp;charged bv the troops of the dictator. They were deſtitute of a leader ; and therefore began to retire, when&nbsp;fi&gt;extus Tarquinius, taking the place of his brother,&nbsp;brought them back to the charge, and renewed the&nbsp;fight with ſuch vigour, that the victory in the centre&nbsp;was ſtill doubtlul. On the </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ide of Mamilius and Æbutius, both parties, encouraged by the example of their&nbsp;leaders, fought.with incredible bravery and reſolution.&nbsp;After a long and bloody conteſt, the two generals&nbsp;»greed to determine the doubtful victory by a ſingle&nbsp;combat. Accordingly the champions puſlitd on their&nbsp;horſes againſt each other. Æbuâuâ with his lance</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">wounded Mamilius in the breaſt ; and Mamilius with his ſword Æbutius in the right arm. Neither of the&nbsp;wounds were mortal ∣ but, both generals falling from&nbsp;their horſes, put an end to the combat. Marcus Valerius, the brother of Poplicola, ſupplying the place of&nbsp;Æbutius, endeavoured, at the head of the Roman&nbsp;horſe, to break the enemy’s battalions ; but was repulſed by the cavalry of the Roman royaliſts. At the&nbsp;ſame time Mamilius appeared again in the van, with a&nbsp;conſiderable body of horſe and flight-armed infantry.&nbsp;Valerius, with the aſſiſtance of his two nephews, the&nbsp;ſons of Poplicola, and a choſen troop of volunteers,&nbsp;attempted to break through the Latin battalions, in&nbsp;order to engage Mamilius ; but, being </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">urrounded by&nbsp;the Roman exiles, he received a mortal wound in hi⅜&nbsp;ſide, ſell from his horſe, and died. The dead body&nbsp;was carried off by the two ſons of Poplicola, in ſpite&nbsp;of the utmoſt efforts of the exiles, and delivered to Valerius’s ſervants, who conveyed it to the Roman camp;&nbsp;but the young heroes being alterwards inveſted on alt&nbsp;ſides, and overpowered by numbers, were both killed&nbsp;on the ſpot. Upon their death, the left wing of the&nbsp;Romans began to give ground, but were ſoon brought&nbsp;back by Poſthumius ; who, with a body of Roman&nbsp;knights, flyiqg to their aſſiſtance, charged the royaliſts&nbsp;with ſuch fury, that they were, after an obſtinate reſiſtance, obliged to give way, and retire in the utmoſt&nbsp;confu</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ion. In the mean time Titus Horminius, one&nbsp;of the dictator’s lieutenants, having rallied thoſe who&nbsp;had fled, ſell upon ſome cloſe battalions of the enemy’3&nbsp;right wing, which ſtill kept their ground under the&nbsp;command of Mamilius, killed him with his own hand,&nbsp;and put that body to flight. But while he was buſy&nbsp;in ſtripping the body of his enemy, he received himſelf a wound, of which</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font1">he died ſoon after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sextus Tarquinius in the mean time maintained the fight with great bravery, at the head of the left wing*&nbsp;againſt the conſul Virginius ; and had even broke thro’&nbsp;the right wing of the Roman army, when the dictator&nbsp;attacked him unexpectedly with his victorious ſqua-drons. ſt hen Sextus, having loſt at once all hopes of&nbsp;victory, threw<sup>,</sup> himſelf, like one in deſpair, into the&nbsp;midſt of the Roman knights, and there ſunk under a&nbsp;multitude of wounds, after he had diſtinguiſhed himſelf&nbsp;in a moſt eminent manner. The death of the three&nbsp;generals was followed by the entire defeat of the Latin&nbsp;army. Their camp was taken and plundered, and moſt&nbsp;of their troops cut in pieces; for, of the 43,oco men&nbsp;who came into the field, ſcarce 10,000 returned home.&nbsp;The next morning the Volſci and Hernici came, according to their agreement, to aſſiſt the Latins ; but&nbsp;finding, upon their arrival, how matters had gone, ſome&nbsp;of them were for falling upon the Romans before they&nbsp;could recover from the fatigue of the preceding day ;&nbsp;but others thought it more ſafe to ſend ambaſſadors to&nbsp;the dictator, to congratulate him on his victory, and&nbsp;aſſure him that they had leſt their own country with&nbsp;no other deſign than to afliſt Rome in ſo dangerous a&nbsp;war. Poſthumius, by producing their courier’s and letters, gave them to underſtand that he w<sup>,</sup>as well appriſed&nbsp;of their deſigns and treacherous proceedings. However, out of a regard to the law of nations, he ſent&nbsp;them back unhurt, with a challenge to their generals&nbsp;to fight the next day ; but the Volſei, and their confederates,. aot caring to engage a victorious army, de-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
