                testator on the&nbsp;technical ground of non-compliance with the purely formal
                requirements of the law, that practically introduced what Justinian calls&nbsp;the
                praetorian testament.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">One of the commonest provisions in the testaments of the period was

                to&nbsp;enter to the inheritance and thereafter denude wholly or partially&nbsp;in
                favour of a third party. It was introduced in the time of&nbsp;Augustus by (it is
                said) a testator who had married a peregrin wife,&nbsp;and desired thus indirectly
                to give to his peregrin children the&nbsp;succession which, as not being citizens,

                failed to&nbsp;comply with the request of his testator, indicated his approval
                of&nbsp;the new institution by remitting the matter to the consuls of the&nbsp;day,
                with instructions to do in the circumstances what they thought&nbsp;just. So quickly
                did it establish itself in public favour, and so&nbsp;numerous did the questions
                become as to the construction and fulfilment of testamentary trusts, that before
                long it was found necessary to institute a court specially charged with their
                determination,&nbsp;—that of the </span><span class="font1"

                class="font1"> In theory the&nbsp;imposition upon the heir of a trust in favour of a
                beneficiary, whether&nbsp;it required him to denude of the whole or only a part of

                of&nbsp;the responsibilities of the position ; and at common law therefore&nbsp;he
                was entitled to decline the succession, often to the great prejudice&nbsp;of the
                beneficiary. In order to avoid such a mischance, and at the&nbsp;same time to

                superfluous by two senatusconsults,&nbsp;the Trebellian in the time of Nero and the
                Pegasian in that of&nbsp;Vespasian, which at once secured the beneficiary against

                of&nbsp;the testator’s and himself ingather the corporeal items of
                the&nbsp;inheritance.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It was one of the advantages of a trust-bequest, whether universal or
                singular, that it might be conferred in a codicil, even though&nbsp;unconfirmed by
                any relative testament. The codicil </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">{codiciUi),</span><span class="font1"> also&nbsp;an
                invention of the time of Augustus, was a deed of a very simple&nbsp;nature. It was
                inappropriate either for disherison of </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">sui</span><span class="font1"> or institution of an heir;
                but if confirmed by testament it might contain&nbsp;direct bequests, manumissions,
                nominations of tutors, and the like,&nbsp;and whether confirmed or unconfirmed
                might, as stated, be utilized&nbsp;as a vehicle for trust-gifts. Latterly it was
                held operative even in&nbsp;the absence of a testament, the trusts contained in it
                being regarded&nbsp;as burdens on the heir-at-law.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The most important changes in the law of intestate succession during
                the period were those accomplished by the Tertullian and&nbsp;Orphitian
                senatusconsults, fruits of that respect for the precepts of&nbsp;natural law which
                in so many directions was modifying the doctrines&nbsp;of the </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pis civile.</span><span class="font1"> The
                first was passed in the reign of Hadrian, the&nbsp;second in the year 178, under
                Marcus Aurelius. Down to the time&nbsp;of the Tertullian senatusconsult a mother and
                her child by a marriage that was unaccompanied with </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font1"> stood related to
                each&nbsp;other only as cognates, being in law members of different families
                ;&nbsp;consequently their chance of succession to each other was remote,&nbsp;being
                postponed to that of their respective agnates to the sixth or&nbsp;seventh degree.
                The purpose of the senatusconsult was to prefer a&nbsp;mother to all agnates of her
                deceased child except father and brother and sister; father and brother excluded her
                ; but with a sister of the deceased, and in the absence of father or brother, she
                shared&nbsp;equally. While there can be little doubt that it was natural
                considerations that dictated this amendment, yet its authors were too&nbsp;timid to
                justify it on the abstract principle of common humanity,&nbsp;lest thereby they
                should seem to impugn the wisdom of </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">thejus civile,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and so
                they confined its application to women who had thejus </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">liber-orum, i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> to women of
                free birth who were mothers of three children&nbsp;and freedwomen who were mothers
                of four, thus making it ostensibly a reward of fertility. The Orphitian
                senatusconsult was the&nbsp;counterpart of the Tertullian. It gave children, whether
                legitimate&nbsp;or illegitimate, a right of succession to their mother in preference
                to&nbsp;all her agnates; and subsequent constitutions extended the principle,
                admitting children to the inheritance not only of their maternal grandparents but
                also to that of their paternal grandmother.</span></p>

                whether&nbsp;the action or exception should or should not be granted, and,
                if&nbsp;granted, whether it should be according to the style exhibited on&nbsp;the

        <p><span class="font1">Although it was not until the early empire that this system of
