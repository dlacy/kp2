<p><label>RETICULUM</label>
is a Latin word, signifying a <hi rend="italic">little net</hi> or <hi rend="italic">casting net.</hi> It was applied by the Romans to a particular mode of constructing their buildings. In the city of Salino may still be seen remains of some walls, evidently of Roman origin, from the <hi rend="italic">reticulum.</hi> This structure consists of small pieces of baked earth, cut lozenge-wis e, and disposed with great regularity on the angles, so as to exhibit to the eye the appearance of cut diamonds; and it was called <hi rend="italic">reticular,</hi> from its resemblance to fishing-nets. The Romans always concealed it under a regular coating of other matter ; and Mr Houel informs us, that this was the only specimen of it which he saw in his travels through Sicily, Malta, and the Lapari Islands. It appears to be the remains of some baths, which had been built for the convenience of sea-bathing.</p>
