<p><span class="font2">eqnſeript fathers aſſembled </span><span class="font1">at Theſſalonſea </span><span class="font2">decreed, that they alone repreſented the Roman ſenate, and that thoſe&nbsp;who reſided at Rome were encouragers </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">tyranny, and&nbsp;friends to the tyrant. And indeed, as the flower of the&nbsp;nobility was with Pompey, and the moſt virtuous men&nbsp;in the republic had taken refuge in his camp, he was&nbsp;generally looked upon as the only hope and ſupport of&nbsp;the public liberty. Hence many perſons- of eminent&nbsp;probity, who had hitherto ſtood neuter, flocked to him&nbsp;from all parts. Anlong theſe were young Brutus, who&nbsp;afterwards conſpired againſt Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar, Tidius Sextius, and&nbsp;Labienus. Brutus, whoſe father had been put to death&nbsp;in Galatia by Pompey’s order, had never ſpoken to&nbsp;him, or ſo much as ſaluted him ſince that time : but&nbsp;as he now looked upon him as the defender of the public liberty, he joined him, ſacriſicing therein his private&nbsp;reſentment to the intereſt of the public. Pompey received him with great joy, and was willing to confer&nbsp;upon him ſome command ; but he declined the offer.&nbsp;Tidius Sextius, though extremely old and lame, yet&nbsp;left Rome, and went as far as Macedonia to join Pompey there. Labienus likewiſe forſook his old benefactor, under whom he had ſerved during the whole courſe&nbsp;of the Gauliſh war, and went over to his rival, though&nbsp;Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar had appointed him commander in chief of all the&nbsp;forces on the other ſide the Alps. Tn ſhort, Pompey’s&nbsp;partv grew into ſuch reputation, that his cauſe was generally called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">good envle,</span><span class="font2"> while Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar’s adherents&nbsp;were looked upon as enemies to their country, and abettors of tyranny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As ſoon as Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar landed, he marched directly </span><span class="font0">.to </span><span class="font2">Oricurn, the neareſt city in Epirus, which was taken&nbsp;without oppoſition, The like ſucceſs attended him at&nbsp;Apollonia, which was in no condition to </span><span class="font1">ſtand</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font2">a ſiege ;&nbsp;and theſe two conqueſts opened a way to Dyrrhachium,&nbsp;where Pompey had his magazines of arms and proviſions. This ſucceſs, however, was interrupted by the&nbsp;news that the fleet which he had ſent back to Brunduſium to tranſport the reſt of his troops had been attacked by Bibulus, one of Pompey’s admirals, who had&nbsp;taken 30, and inhumanly burnt them with the ſeamen&nbsp;on board. This gave Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar great uneaſineſs, eſpecially&nbsp;as he heard that Bibulus, with 1 10 ſhips of war, had&nbsp;taken po</span><span class="font1">ſſ</span><span class="font2">e</span><span class="font1">ſſ</span><span class="font2">ion of all the harbours between Salonium&nbsp;and Oricurn ; ſo that the legions at Brunduſium could&nbsp;not venture to croſs the ſea without great danger </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">falling into the enemy’s hands. By this Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar was ſo&nbsp;much embarra</span><span class="font1">ſſ</span><span class="font2">ed, that he made propoſals of accommodation upon very moderate terms ; being no other&nbsp;than that both Pompey and he ſhould diſhand their armies within three days, renew their former friendſhip&nbsp;with ſolemn oaths, and return together to Italy. Theſe&nbsp;propoſals were ſent by Vibullius Rufus, an intimate ſriend&nbsp;of Pompey, whom Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar had twice taken priſoner.&nbsp;Pompey, however, probably elated with his late good&nbsp;fortune, anſwered that he would not hearken to any&nbsp;terms, leſt it ſhould be ſaid that he owed his liſe and&nbsp;return to Italy to Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar’s ſavour. However, the latter&nbsp;again ſent one Vatinius to confer with Pompey about a&nbsp;treaty of peace. Labienus was appointed to receive the&nbsp;propoſals ; but while they were conferring together, a&nbsp;party of Pompey’s men coming up to them, diſeharged&nbsp;their darts at Vatinius and thoſe who attended him.&nbsp;Some of the guards were wounded, and Vatinius narrowly eſeaped with his life«·</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">In </span><span class="font1">the jnean time </span><span class="font2">Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar advanced towards </span><span class="font1">Dyrrha</span><span class="font2">chium, in hopes of ſurpriſing that important place ; but Pompey unexpectedly appearing, he halted on the&nbsp;other </span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ide of the river Aρ.us, where he intrenched himſelf, as having but a ſmall number of troops in com·&nbsp;pariſon of the formidable army which attended Pompey. The Utter, however, notwithſtanding his ſuperiority, durſt not croſs the river in Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar s light; ſo that&nbsp;the two armies continued for ſome time quiet in their&nbsp;reſpective camps. Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar wrote letter after letter to·&nbsp;Marc Antony, who commanded the legions he had left&nbsp;in Italy, to come to his aſſiſtance; but receiving no anſwer, Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar diſguiſed himſelf in the habit of a </span><span class="font0">ſlave,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and with all imaginable ſecrecy went on board a ſiſher-man’s bark, with a deſign to go over to Brunduſium,&nbsp;though the enemy’s fleet was cruiſing on the coaſts&nbsp;both of Greece and Italy. This deſign, however, miſcarried, by reaſon of the boat being put back by contrary winds; and thus Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar was reſtored to his ſoldiers,&nbsp;who had been very uneaſy at his abſence. He was no&nbsp;ſooner landed than he diſpatched Poſthumius, one of his&nbsp;lieutenants, with moſt preſſing orders to Marc Antony,&nbsp;Gabinius, and Calenus, to bring the troops to him at&nbsp;all adventures. Gabinius, unwilling to expoſe all the&nbsp;hopes of his general to the hazards of the ſea, thought&nbsp;it ſafer to march a great way about by Illyricum, and&nbsp;therefore engaged all the legionaries he could to follow&nbsp;him by land. But the Illyrians, who had, unknown to&nbsp;him, declared for Pompey, fell unexpectedly upon him&nbsp;and killed him and his men, not one eſcaping. Marc&nbsp;Antony and Calenus, who went by ſea, were in the&nbsp;greateſt danger from one of Pompey's∙ admirals ; but&nbsp;had the good luck to bring their troops ſafe to ſhore at&nbsp;Nyphæum, in the neighbourhood of Apollonia. As&nbsp;loon as it was known that Antony was landed, Po n-pey marched to prevent his joining Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar. On the&nbsp;other hand, Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar inſtantly de&lt;,kimped, and haſtening to&nbsp;the relief of his lieutenant, joined him before Pompey&nbsp;came up. Then Pompey,, not caring to engage them&nbsp;when united, retired to an advantageous poſt in the&nbsp;neighbourhood of Dyrrhachium, known by the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aſparagium</span><span class="font2">, and there encamped. Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar having thus at&nbsp;length got all his troops together, reſolved to finiſh the&nbsp;war by one general action, and determine the fate of the&nbsp;world, either by his own death or by that of his rival.&nbsp;To this end he offered Pompey battle, and kept his army a great while drawn up in light of the enemy. But&nbsp;Pompey declining an engagement, he decamped, and&nbsp;turned towards Dyrrhachium, as if he deſigned to ſur</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">priſe it, hoping by this means to draw Pompey into the plain. But Pompey, looking upon the taking of&nbsp;Dyrrhachium as a chimerical project, followed Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar at&nbsp;ſome diſtance, and letting him draw near to the city,&nbsp;encamped on a hill called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Petra,</span><span class="font2"> which commanded the&nbsp;ſea, whence he could be ſupplied with proviſions ſrom&nbsp;Greece and Aſia, while Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar was forced to bring corn&nbsp;by land from Epirus, at a vaſt expence, and· through&nbsp;many dangers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This inconvenience put Cæ</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ar upon a new deſign, which was to ſurround an army far more numerous&nbsp;than his own, and, by {hutting them up within a narrow tract of ground, diſtreſs them as much ſor want of&nbsp;forage as his troops were diſtre</span><span class="font1">ſſ</span><span class="font2">ed for want of corn.&nbsp;Pu-ſuant to this deſign, be drew a line of circιιmvalla-tion from the ſea quite round Pompey’s camp, and kept</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
