<p><span class="font1">down as a condition of the alliance that the duchies should only be separated from Denmark by common consent of the two&nbsp;German powers. Bismarck, however, insisted that the question&nbsp;of the ultimate destination of the duchies should be left open;&nbsp;and, when he backed his argument with the threat that unless&nbsp;Austria accepted his proposal Prussia would act alone, Rechberg&nbsp;gave way. His action was made the object of violent attacks&nbsp;in the Austrian Lower House (28-30 January 1864), and when&nbsp;the war was victoriously concluded and Prussia’s designs on&nbsp;the duchies had become evident, public opinion turned more&nbsp;and more against him, demanding that Austria should support&nbsp;the duke of Augustenburg even at the risk of war. Rechberg&nbsp;yielded so far as to assure the duke’s representative at Vienna&nbsp;that Austria was determined to place him in possession of the&nbsp;duchies, but only on condition that he did not sign away any&nbsp;of his sovereign rights to Prussia. The outcome of this was&nbsp;that the duke refused the terms offered by King William and&nbsp;Bismarck.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the 22nd of August there was a meeting of the emperor Francis Joseph and King William at Schönbrunn, both Rechberg and Bismarck being present. Rechberg himself was in&nbsp;favour of allowing Prussia to annex the duchies, on condition&nbsp;that Prussia should guarantee Austria’s possession of Venice&nbsp;and the Adriatic coast. On the first point no agreement was&nbsp;reached; but the principles of an Austro-Prussian alliance in&nbsp;the event of a French invasion of Italy were agreed upon. This&nbsp;latter proposal was, however, received with violent opposition&nbsp;in the ministry, where Rechberg’s influence had long been over-shadowed by that of Schmerling; public opinion, utterly distrustful of Prussian promises, was also greatly excited; and on&nbsp;the 27th of October Rechberg handed in his resignation, receiving&nbsp;at the same time the order of the Golden Fleece from the&nbsp;emperor as a sign of special favour. He had been made an&nbsp;hereditary member of the Upper House of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reichsrat</span><span class="font1"> in 1861and as late as 1879 continued occasionally to take part in&nbsp;debates. He died at his château of Kettenhof near Vienna on&nbsp;the 26th of February 1899. He had married, in 1834, Barbara&nbsp;Jones, eldest daughter of the 6th Viscount Ranelagh, by whom&nbsp;he had one son, Count Louis (b. 1835).</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">See the biography by Franz Ilwof in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie,</span><span class="font1"> B. 53. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nachträge</span><span class="font2"> (Leipzig, 1907).</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">RECIDIVISM (from Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">récidiver,</span><span class="font1"> to relapse and fall again into the same fault, or repeat the same offence as one committed&nbsp;before), a modern expression for “ habitual crime.’’ The&nbsp;recidivist is now universally known to exist in all civilized&nbsp;countries as one who has adopted wrong-doing and law-breaking&nbsp;as a profession. His persistency is ceaseless and inextinguishable by the ordinary methods of combating crime. Penal&nbsp;justice as generally exercised is unavailing, and is little better&nbsp;than an automatic machine which draws in a vast number&nbsp;within its wheels and casts them out again practically unchanged&nbsp;in character to qualify again for the ineffective treatment.&nbsp;This dangerous contingent is for ever on the move, into prison&nbsp;and out of it and in again; a large proportion of it, the criminal&nbsp;residuum, the very essence of the criminality of a country,&nbsp;resists all processes devised for its regeneration and cure.&nbsp;Nothing will mend it; neither severity nor kindness, neither&nbsp;the most irksome restraints nor the philanthropic methods of&nbsp;moral and educational persuasion. This failure has encouraged&nbsp;some ardent reformers to recommend the system of indefinite&nbsp;imprisonment or the indeterminate sentence, by which the&nbsp;enemy once caught is kept perpetually or for a lengthy period,&nbsp;and thus rendered innocuous. Habitual offenders, it is argued,&nbsp;should be detained as hostages until they are willing to lay&nbsp;down their arms and consent to make no further attempt to&nbsp;attack or injure society. The theory is sound and has been&nbsp;adopted in part in several countries, especially in the United&nbsp;States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was not until 1909 that the system of preventive detention was put into operation in the United Kingdom, when, by the&nbsp;Prevention of Crime Act 1908, power was given to the courts&nbsp;to pass on habitual criminals a sentence of preventive detention&nbsp;in addition to one of penal servitude. This further period may&nbsp;range within limits of from five to ten years, according to the&nbsp;discretion of the court. The English system is hardly more&nbsp;than tentative at present; the machinery is admittedly capable&nbsp;of improvement. The charge of being an habitual criminal&nbsp;has to be inserted in the indictment on which the offender is&nbsp;to be tried, and this cannot be done without the consent of&nbsp;the director of pubh'c prosecutions and after certain notice has&nbsp;been given to the officer of the court trying the prisoner and to&nbsp;the offender himself. The decision to charge a prisoner with&nbsp;being an habitual criminal has hitherto rested on the local&nbsp;poh*ce authorities, and it has been felt that a more even and a&nbsp;more general application of such a drastic method of treatment&nbsp;would result if the decision were transferred to one authority,&nbsp;and some such reform was foreshadowed by the Home Secretary&nbsp;in a speech in the House of Commons on prison reform on the&nbsp;2oth of July 1910.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RECIFE, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pernambuco,</span><span class="font1"> a city and seaport of Brazil, capital of the state of Pernambuco, in 8° 3' S. and 34° 55' W.,&nbsp;near the extreme eastern point of South America. Pop. (1904&nbsp;estimate) 186,000. Recife is frequently called the “ Venice&nbsp;of America ”; it is at the mouths of the rivers Beberibe and&nbsp;Capibaribe which unite to form a small lagoon or bay inside&nbsp;the sea beach. In the angle between the two rivers is the delta&nbsp;island of Antonio Vaz. The city is built on the southern&nbsp;extremity of the sandy sea beach, on the island of Antonio Vaz,&nbsp;and on the mainland to the westward, the river channels being&nbsp;crossed by numerous bridges. With the exception of the hills&nbsp;on which Olinda is built about 5 m. northward, the surrounding&nbsp;country is low and flat, the general elevation averaging 10 ft.&nbsp;As the tide rises about 6 ft., the general level of the city and&nbsp;neighbouring coast, which is wet and swampy to the southward,&nbsp;is too low to be generally healthy, and Pernambuco has a high&nbsp;death-rate (52½ per 1000 in 1904), with malaria as one of&nbsp;the principal causes of death. The climate is hot, although&nbsp;agreeably tempered by the S.E. trade winds; the temperature&nbsp;ranges from an absolute minimum of 61<sup>o</sup> to an absolute maximum of 99° (1904). The rainfall (1904) is 75∙3 in. The three&nbsp;principal parishes of the city are known as Sāo José do Recife,&nbsp;occupying the sandy peninsula or beach north of the outlet of the&nbsp;united rivers; Santo Antonio, on the island of Antonio Vaz,&nbsp;which was called Mauritia or Mauritzstad during the Dutch&nbsp;occupation; and Boa Vista, on the mainland to the westward,&nbsp;which is the most modern and the most rapidly growing part.&nbsp;The first is the oldest and most crowded section, and is now&nbsp;devoted chiefly to the commercial and financial interests of the&nbsp;port; here are the custom house, merchants’ exchange (Praça&nbsp;do Commercio), shipping offices, banks and wholesale houses.&nbsp;Santo Antonio dates from the Dutch occupation. Prince&nbsp;Maurice of Nassau, when governor-general, built here his private&nbsp;residence (Fribourg House) and made it his capital. Its&nbsp;business edifices and residences are largely of Dutch architecture, with many storeys and steep roofs. 'The older part of&nbsp;Boa Vista dates from the 17th century. Recife has few public&nbsp;squares or gardens, and its streets are not usually well cared&nbsp;for. The older buildings are of the Portuguese type, usually&nbsp;plain, low and heavy, constructed of broken stone and mortar,&nbsp;and plastered and coloured on the outside. The city has gas&nbsp;and electric illumination, street and suburban railways, drainage&nbsp;and a public water supply drawn from a small tributary of the&nbsp;Beberibe about 7 m. to the N.W., in the direction of Caxangá.&nbsp;Among its notable public buildings and institutions are the old&nbsp;government palace in Santo Antonio built upon the foundations&nbsp;of the official residence of Prince Maurice of Nassau, with a&nbsp;pretty garden attached; a theatre facing upon the Praça da&nbsp;Republica, dating from the second empire; the palace of the&nbsp;Provincial Assembly in Boa Vista, built in 1860-66, surmounted by a high dome; the municipal palace, or prefecture,&nbsp;on Rua do Imperador, with the public library (Biblioteca&nbsp;Publica) occupying its third floor and containing about 30,000&nbsp;volumes; the Gymnasium, a large plain building of two floors&nbsp;standing near the legislative palace; the Pedro II. hospital</span></p>
