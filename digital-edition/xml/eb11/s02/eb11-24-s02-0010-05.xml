Frederick St John, second son of Frederick, second Viscount Bolingbroke, was born on the 3rd of December 1809. He was educated at Midhurst, Sussex, and about 1828 obtained a clerkship in the treasury, but resigned in 1834, in which year he married a lady with some fortune. He ultimately settled in the “ Laigh ” of Moray, “ within easy distance of mountain sport.” In 1853 a paralytic seizure deprived him of the use of his limbs, and for the benefit of his health he removed to the south of England. He died at Woolston, near Southampton, on the 22nd of July 1856. His works are <hi rend="italic">Wild Sports and Natural History of the Highlands</hi> (1846, 2nd cd. 1848, 3rd ed. 1861); <hi rend="italic">Tour in Sutherland</hi> (1849, 2nd ed., with recollections by Captain H. St John, 1884); <hi rend="italic">Notes of Natural History and Sport in Morayshire,</hi> with Memoir by C. Innes (1863, 2nd ed. 1884). They are written in a graphic style, and illustrated with engravings, many of them from clever pen-and-ink sketches of his own.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
