<p><span class="font2">II. (which is well organized), national museum, institute of history, geography, and ethnology (1838), polytechnic&nbsp;institute, national educational museum, polytechnic school,&nbsp;military, naval, and normal schools, lyceum of arts, musical&nbsp;conservatory, geographical society, and astronomical and&nbsp;meteorological observatory deserve special mention. The&nbsp;great national library owes its foundation to the bequest of&nbsp;Joao VL, and now numbers upwards of 120,000 volumes&nbsp;open to the public daily (see Libraries, vol. xiv. p. 530,&nbsp;where the lesser libraries are also mentioned). One of&nbsp;the pleasant features of the city is the abundant supply&nbsp;of excellent water distributed to numerous stately fountains&nbsp;in the streets and public squares. The chief aqueduct,&nbsp;begun in the middle of the 17th century, starts at Tijuca,&nbsp;about 12 miles distant, and crosses the valley (740 feet&nbsp;wide and 90 feet deep) between Monte de Santa Theresa&nbsp;and Monte de Santo Antonio by a beautiful double tier&nbsp;of arches (erected in 1750), which form a striking feature&nbsp;in some of the finest views of the city. Its entire length&nbsp;being covered in with stone work, the water is kept remarkably cool. As the city has extended, other aqueducts of&nbsp;less architectural pretensions have had to be constructed ;&nbsp;and a good deal has been done by an English company&nbsp;in recent years to provide a proper system of sewers.&nbsp;The bay of Rio de Janeiro has been the subject of poetic&nbsp;panegyric ever since it was discovered ; and the traveller&nbsp;who comes to it after a voyage round the world seems as&nbsp;susceptible to its charm as if it were his first tropical&nbsp;experience.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> The actual entrance, between Fort St Juan&nbsp;and Fort Santa Cruz, is 1700 yards wide. Within there&nbsp;are fifty square miles of anchorage, or even more for&nbsp;vessels of light draught, the bay having a width varying&nbsp;from 2 to 7 miles and stretching inland from the sea for&nbsp;16 miles. Its coast-line, neglecting minor indentations,&nbsp;measures 60 miles. Such a sheet of water would be&nbsp;beautiful anywhere ; but, when on all sides it is surrounded&nbsp;by hills of the most varied contour, the beauty is enhanced&nbsp;a thousandfold. Its surface is broken by a large number of islands—from the Ilha do Governador (6 miles&nbsp;long and 2 broad; population 2500) down to the little&nbsp;cluster of the Jerubahibas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rio is the seat of the principal arsenal in the empire, and most of the Brazilian cruisers have been built in its dockyards. The&nbsp;roadstead for vessels of war is between Villegagnon Island, with&nbsp;its fort, and the islands at the north-east angle of the town called&nbsp;respectively Ilha das Cobras (Snake Island) and Ilha dos Ratos&nbsp;(Rat Island). On the north side of Ilha das Cobras is the naval&nbsp;arsenal with two large docks. On Ilha das Enchadas (Coaling&nbsp;Island) there is a fine commercial dock 385 feet long, on keel&nbsp;blocks, 45 feet wide at the entrance and 23 feet deep. Between&nbsp;1846 and 1855 the average number of vessels that cleared from the&nbsp;port of Rio was over 680 with an average total burden of 221,280&nbsp;tons. In 1867 1311 vessels (522,407 tons) entered and 1032&nbsp;(596,663 tons) cleared ; in 1883 1218 (1,220,330 tons) entered and&nbsp;1067 cleared, while, besides, the coasting trade was represented&nbsp;by 1414 vessels (454,739) entering. England has the greatest&nbsp;share of the foreign shipping trade, Germany ranking next, and&nbsp;France third. How completely (in spite of the fact that Santos&nbsp;and Rio Grande have become more independent) Rio de Janeiro&nbsp;is the commercial as well as the political capital of Brazil is&nbsp;evident from the fact that the exports from Rio are on the average&nbsp;fully equal in value to those from the rest of Brazil ; for instance,&nbsp;the value of the exports from the capital in 1859-60 was&nbsp;£5,933,850 out of £11,826,121 from the empire, in 1879-80&nbsp;£10,566,800 out of £18,928,635, and in 1881-82 £7,550,966 out of&nbsp;£18,522,050. To this large total coffee has long contributed 40-50&nbsp;per cent., and in 1880-81 (an exceptional year) the ratio rose to 86&nbsp;per cent. Though the coffee plant was not introduced till 1770,&nbsp;Brazil is the greatest coffee-producing country in the world, and Rio&nbsp;de Janeiro is consequently the largest coffee-exporting city. The&nbsp;other exports of moment are brandy (in decreasing quantities), sugar,&nbsp;hides, diamonds, tapioca (mainly to France), tobacco and cigars,&nbsp;medicinal herbs, gold dust, and jacaranda, rosewood, and other&nbsp;timbers. The imports comprise cotton goods, machinery, pitch&nbsp;pine, and petroleum. Among the comparatively few local industries&nbsp;are the weaving of coloured buckskins (by a German firm) and&nbsp;other woollen and half woollen stuffs, the extensive manufacture&nbsp;of artificial mineral waters and liquors, brewing, carriage-building,&nbsp;and hat-making. Rio de Janeiro is the terminus of the Dorn Pedro&nbsp;II. Railway, and thus of nearly the whole railway system of the&nbsp;country ; and it communicates regularly by steamer with Nitherohi&nbsp;on the other side of the bay, which is the terminus of another line.&nbsp;The population of the municipality of Rio de Janeiro was in 1850&nbsp;stated at 266,466, of which 205,906 were in the town proper ; but&nbsp;this, like most of the earlier figures, appears to be an exaggeration,&nbsp;as the census in 1872 gave only 274,972, of which about 190,000&nbsp;were in the town and suburbs, the slaves numbering 48,939 and&nbsp;the foreigners (mainly Germans, French, and Italians) 84,279. The&nbsp;Italian element has been rapidly increasing. The bulk of the&nbsp;population is Portuguese with a mixture of Negro blood. The&nbsp;native Indian races are scarcely represented.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> “This bay,” says Mr Gallenga, “is the very gate to a tropical paradise. There is nowhere so bold a coast, such a picturesque cluster&nbsp;of mountains, such a maze of inlets and outlets, such a burst of all-pervading vegetation. The city itself is like Lima or Buenos Ayres,&nbsp;a mere chess-board of shabby narrow streets. But the environs all&nbsp;round—the Botafogo Bay, the vale of Larangerias, the height of Tejuca,&nbsp;San Cristoval, Santa Teresa, and others .... may well challenge&nbsp;comparison with any of the loveliest localities of either hemisphere.&nbsp;You are bidden drive out to the Botanic Gardens (at Botafogo), but&nbsp;the whole road inland or along the water is nothing but a continuous&nbsp;garden.”</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">The annual rainfall at Rio de Janeiro is about 60 inches, the greatest precipitation taking place in February (12 inches), and&nbsp;the least in August (under 1 inch). The monthly ranges of temperature for 1882 were—January 97<sup>o</sup>-68<sup>o</sup>, February 95°-68<sup>o</sup> ; March&nbsp;95°-69<sup>o</sup> ; April 87<sup>o</sup>-64<sup>o</sup> ; May 84°-60<sup>o</sup> ; June 82<sup>o</sup>-59<sup>o</sup> ; July 85<sup>0</sup>-59°; August 98°-54°; September 80<sup>o</sup>-50<sup>o</sup>j October 92°-59<sup>J</sup>; November 97<sup>o</sup>-59<sup>o</sup> ; December 96<sup>o</sup>-62°.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The bay of Rio de Janeiro, the Nitherohi or “ Hidden Water” of the natives, was first observed on 1st January (hence the name)&nbsp;by Alphonso de Souza, who supposed, as the Rio indicates, that he&nbsp;had discovered the mouth of a large river. How Villegagnon in&nbsp;1558 took possession of the island which now bears his name but&nbsp;was then called after his patron Coligny, and how his colony was&nbsp;destroyed by the Portuguese, has been told in the article Brazil&nbsp;(vol. iv. p. 229). The city of Rio de Janeiro did not become the&nbsp;capital of the viceroyalty till 1763, when José I. chose it in&nbsp;preference to Bahia because it was a better centre for defensive&nbsp;operations against the Spaniards. In 1711 it had been captured&nbsp;by· Duguay-Trouin, who exacted 70,000 cruzados as ransom. It&nbsp;became the residence of the Portuguese royal family in 1808 ; in&nbsp;the same year its port was declared free to foreign trade ; and in&nbsp;the course of a short time it was made by Dorn Joâo VI. the seat&nbsp;of so many important institutions that Portugal became jealous at&nbsp;finding the relation between mother country and colony practically&nbsp;reversed. When Joâo VI. returned to Portugal and Pedro was&nbsp;declared emperor of Brazil in 1822, Rio de Janeiro naturally&nbsp;remained the capital of the new state. Ecclesiastically the city&nbsp;was at first (from the foundation of the church of Sào Sebastiäo by&nbsp;Mendo de Sa in 1567) subject to the diocese of Bahia (San&nbsp;Salvador). It was made a suffragan bishopric of Bahia by papal&nbsp;bull of 19th July 1576 ; and when Bahia was by the bull of 16th&nbsp;November 1676 created the metropolitan archbishopric of Brazil,&nbsp;Rio de Janeiro was (along with Pernambuco) declared a bishopric,&nbsp;the bishop’s authority extending over the province of Espirito&nbsp;Santo northwards and southwards to the Rio de la Plata (Rio da&nbsp;Prata). The first bishop relinquished his dignity without taking&nbsp;possession ; and the second did not reach his diocese till 1682,&nbsp;when he made the church of St Sebastian on the Castle Hill&nbsp;his cathedral. This distinction was in 1734 transferred to the&nbsp;Church of the Cross and in 1738 to that of the Rosary. A new&nbsp;cathedral was begun in 1749 by D. Frei Antonio do Desterro, but&nbsp;the works were discontinued on his death, and in 1840 the materials&nbsp;served for the military academy.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RIO GRANDE (that is, “ Great River ” in both Spanish and Portuguese), a descriptive epithet which in a vast&nbsp;number of cases has become a proper name. (1) Rio&nbsp;Grande (or Rio Bravo) del Norte, which rises in the&nbsp;Rocky Mountains between the La Plata and San Juan&nbsp;ranges in the south-west of Colorado, has a total course of&nbsp;about 1800 miles, and forms for 1100 miles the boundary&nbsp;between the United States and Mexico, but owing to&nbsp;the shallowness of its ordinary current is navigable for&nbsp;steamers only to Kingsbury’s Rapids, 450 miles from the&nbsp;sea.
