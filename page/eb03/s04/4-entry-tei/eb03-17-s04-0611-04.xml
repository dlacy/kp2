in matters of government, is applied to the ſupreme magiſtrate or magiſt rates of an independent government or ſtate ; becauſe their authority is only bounded by the laws of God and the laws of the ſtate : ſuch are kings, princes, &amp; c.

For it is at any time in the option of the legiſlature to alter that form and adminiſtration by a new edict or rule, and to put the execution of the laws into whatever hands it pleaſes : and all the other powers of the ſtate muſt obey the legiſlative power in the execution of their ſeveral functions, or elſe the conſtitution is at an end.<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Blackst.
