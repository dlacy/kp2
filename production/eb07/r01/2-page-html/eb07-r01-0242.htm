<p><span class="font0">tainous district, containing two cities, sixteen market-towns, with many villages and hamlets, and 65,750 inhabitants.&nbsp;The capital is the city of the same name situated on the river&nbsp;Belino, near its junction with the Turano. It contains ten&nbsp;parish churches, five monasteries, seven nunneries, and 9270&nbsp;inhabitants, who subsist chiefly by the trade in silk, and by&nbsp;tanning and currying leather. Long. 12. 46. 50. E. Lat.&nbsp;42. 24. 25. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIGA, a city of the province of Livonia, a part of the Russian empire in Europe. It is the capital of a circle of&nbsp;the same name as well as of the province. The circle extends over 4180 square miles, and contains, in two cities,&nbsp;one market-town, and thirty-nine parishes, about 150,000&nbsp;inhabitants. The city of Riga, called in the language of&nbsp;Esthonia </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Riolin,</span><span class="font0"> and in that of Livonia </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Righo,</span><span class="font0"> is situated&nbsp;on the right bank of the river Duna or Dwina, about seven&nbsp;miles from its entrance into the Baltic. As a barrier on the&nbsp;western frontier of Russia, it is strongly fortified, both on&nbsp;the land and the sea side. It is composed of large old&nbsp;houses, and of narrow crooked streets ill paved. The principal public buildings are the palace of the governor, the&nbsp;barracks, and the town-hall, used now as the exchange. It&nbsp;contains 1240 private dwellings, with about 30,000 inhabitants, exclusive of the garrison. The people are mostly of&nbsp;the German race, and their language is far more common&nbsp;than that of Russia or of Livonia. The Germans have four&nbsp;Lutheran and one reformed church ; and there are three&nbsp;Greek churches for the Russians and the troops. The city&nbsp;formerly was one of the Hanse Towns, and has now considerable export trade in the raw materials which are produced in the extended districts through which the river&nbsp;passes. At some seasons England draws much corn from&nbsp;this place. It has some considerable establishments for&nbsp;making leather, sail-cloth, linen, and some iron, steel, and&nbsp;other metallic articles. It imports large quantities of fruit,&nbsp;beer, wine, salt, sugar, tea, coffee, spices, and manufactured&nbsp;clothing. It has several institutions for education, and many&nbsp;for the relief of poverty, age, aud sickness. Long. 23. 57.&nbsp;10. E. Lat. 56. 56. 32. N.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIGGING </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of a Ship,</span><span class="font0"> a general name given to all the ropes employed to support the masts, and to extend or reduce the sails, or arrange them to the disposition of the&nbsp;wind. The former, which are used to sustain the masts,&nbsp;remain usually in a fixed position, and are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">standing&nbsp;rigging ;</span><span class="font0"> such are the shrouds, stays, and backstays. The&nbsp;latter, whose office is to manage the sails, by communicating with various blocks or pulleys situated in different parts&nbsp;of the masts, yards, shrouds, &amp;c. are comprehended in the general term of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">running rigging.</span><span class="font0"> Such are the braces, sheets,&nbsp;haliards, clue-lines, and brails.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIGHT, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geometry,</span><span class="font0"> signifies the same with straight ; thus, a straight line is called a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">right</span><span class="font0"> one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Right is a title conferred, 1. together with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reverend, </span><span class="font0">upon all bishops ; 2. together with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Honourable,</span><span class="font0"> upon earls,&nbsp;viscounts, and barons ; 3. by courtesy, together with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Honourable,</span><span class="font0"> upon the sons of dukes, marquises, and the eldest&nbsp;sons of earls ; 4. together with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Honourable,</span><span class="font0"> upon the&nbsp;speaker of the House of Commons, but upon no other commoner excepting those who are members of her majesty’s&nbsp;most honourable privy council, and the three lords mayors&nbsp;of London, York, and Dublin, and the lord provost of Edinburgh, during their office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIGHTS, in the common acceptation of the word, are of various kinds ; they are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">natural</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">adventitious, alienable&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">unalienable, perfect</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperfect, particular</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Natural</span><span class="font0"> rights are those which a man has to his life, limbs, and liberty ; to the produce of his personal labour ;&nbsp;to the use, in common with others, of air, light, and water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That every man has a natural right or just claim to these things, is evident from their being absolutely necessary to'&nbsp;enable him to answer that purpose, whatever it may be, for&nbsp;which he was made a living and a rational being. This&nbsp;shows undeniably that the Author of his nature designed&nbsp;that he should have the use of them, and that the man who&nbsp;should wantonly deprive him of any one of them, would be&nbsp;guilty of a breach of the divine law, as well as act inconsistently with the fitness of things in every sense in which&nbsp;that phrase can possibly be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Adventitious</span><span class="font0"> rights are those which a king has over his subjects, a general over his soldiers, a husband to the person and affections of his wife, and which every man has to&nbsp;the greater part of his property. The important question&nbsp;is, how are adventitious rights acquired? In answer to&nbsp;this question, the moralist who deduces the laws of virtue&nbsp;from the will of God, observes, that as God appears from&nbsp;his works to be a benevolent Being who wills the happiness&nbsp;of all his creatures, he must of course will every thing which&nbsp;naturally tends to promote that happiness. But the existence of civil society evidently contributes in a great degree&nbsp;to promote the sum of human happiness ; and therefore&nbsp;whatever is necessary for the support of civil society in general, or for the conduct of particular societies already established, must be agreeable to the will of God : but the&nbsp;allegiance of subjects to their sovereign, the obedience of&nbsp;soldiers to their leader, the protection of private property,&nbsp;and the fulfilling of contracts, are all absolutely necessary&nbsp;to the support of society ; and hence the rights of kings,&nbsp;generals, husbands, and wives, &amp;c. though adventitious, and&nbsp;immediately derived from human appointments, are not less&nbsp;sacred than natural rights, since they may all be ultimately&nbsp;traced to the same source. The same conclusion may easily&nbsp;be drawn by the philosopher, who rests moral obligation on&nbsp;the fitness of things, or on a moral sense ; only it must in&nbsp;each of these cases partake of the instability of its foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rights, besides being natural or adventitious, are likewise </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">alienable</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">unalienable.</span><span class="font0"> Every man, when he becomes the member of a civil community, alienates a part of his natural rights. In a state of nature, no man has a superior on earth, and each has a right to defend his life, liberty, and property, by all tile means which nature has put&nbsp;in his power. In civil society, however, these rights are&nbsp;all transferred to the laws and the magistrate, except in&nbsp;cases of such extreme urgency as leave not time for legal&nbsp;interposition. This single consideration is sufficient to show&nbsp;that the right to civil liberty is alienable ; though, in the&nbsp;vehemence of men’s zeal for it, and in the language of some&nbsp;political remonstrances, it has often been pronounced to be&nbsp;an unalienable right. “ The true reason,” says Paley, “ why&nbsp;mankind hold in detestation the memory of those who have&nbsp;sold their liberty to a tyrant is, that, together with their&nbsp;own, they sold commonly or endangered the liberty of others;&nbsp;of which they had certainly no right to dispose.” The rights&nbsp;of a prince over his people, and of a husband over his wife,&nbsp;arc generally and naturally unalienable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another division of rights is into those which are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">perfect </span><span class="font0">and those which are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperfect.</span><span class="font0"> Perfect rights are such as&nbsp;may be precisely ascertained and asserted by force, or in&nbsp;civil society by the course of law. To imperfect rights neither force nor law is applicable. A man’s rights to his life,&nbsp;person, and property, are all perfect ; for if any of these be&nbsp;attacked, he may repel the attack by instant violence, punish&nbsp;the aggressor by the course of law, or compel the author of&nbsp;the injury to make restitution or satisfaction. A woman’s&nbsp;right to her honour is likewise perfect ; for if she cannot&nbsp;otherwise escape, she may kill the ravisher. Every poor man&nbsp;has undoubted right to relief from the rich ; but his right&nbsp;is imperfect, for if the relief be not voluntarily given, he&nbsp;cannot compel it either by law or by violence.
