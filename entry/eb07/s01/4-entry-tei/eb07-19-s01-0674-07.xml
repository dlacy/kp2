a town on the shore of the German Ocean, in the lathe of Pickering, in the north riding of the county of York, and 216 miles from London. This town is distant about five leagues north-west from Flamborough Head. It has a harbour, which is dry at low water, and of late has been so improved as to afford shelter, in all gales of wind upon the coast, to vessels capable of bearing the ground. The ancient pier has been extended, and formed into a new harbour, which may be resorted to when the old harbour is crowded, and where are placed dolphins and mooring rings. A lighthouse has been erected upon the pier, which is kept burning from half flood to half ebb, as a direction to vessels entering in the night.</p><p>Though the harbour of Scarborough is thus useful as a protection for the smaller class of vessels, the trade of the port is not extensive. The chief exports consist of bacon hams, butter, and corn ; and the chief imports arc coals, timber, flax, and iron, with wine, gin, brandy, and rum, from the places of their growth, and groceries from London. The only manufactories are those connected with shipping, such as cordage and sail-cloth. The building of ships forms some occupation, but it is a fluctuating and precarious employment.</p><p>The chief importance of Scarborough arises from its being a most agreeable bathing-place, to which strangers repair in the summer. Besides the inducement to sea-bathing, many resort to it on account of its mineral springs, called the Spa.</p><p>The situation and view of Scarborough, either from the land or the sea, is striking and picturesque. The castle, on an extensive site, now in ruins, stands on a promontory running into the sea, and rising to the height of more than 300 feet above it. It was built in the reign of King Stephen, in 1136, and must have been then a place of unassailable strength, extending over an area of nineteen acres, the walls of which can be still traced, and having within it a copious well of water. The keep is at present in tolerable preservation. It is a square Norman building, ninety feet in height, and had formerly an embattled parapet. The walls are about twelve feet in thickness, cased with squared stones ; and the mortar having been, according to ancient custom, in a fluid state, has become more durable than even the stone of the building.</p><p>The town confers the title of earl upon the family of Lumley. It returns two members to the House of Commons, as heretofore. By the municipal reform law it is now divided into two wards, in which are chosen six aldermen and eighteen councillors. The population (taken in May, when no visiters are in the town) amounted in 1801 to 6409, in 1811 to 6710, in 1821 to 8188, and in 1831 to 8760.<pb facs="chi.28490931-1526160593_Page_732.jpf" xml:id="eb07-19-s01-0675"/>
