<p><span class="font0">Fates are duennas watching Proserpine ; the entrance to Pluto’s castle is watched by the giant Cerberus. Hercules conquers Spain&nbsp;and takes Merida from Geryon. The book is translated into&nbsp;English as Hercules of Greece (n.d.). The marquis de Villena took&nbsp;from the same source his prose Lιbrο de los Trabajos de Hercules&nbsp;(Zamora, 1498), and Fernandez dc Heredia wrote Tmbajos de&nbsp;Hercules (1682), also in prose. Le Fatiche JErcοle (1475) is a&nbsp;romance in poetic prose by Pietro Bassi, and the Dodeci Travagli&nbsp;di Ercοle (1544), a poem by J. Perillos.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jason.—Les fais et prouesses du noble et vaillant chevalier Jason was composed in the middle of the 15th century by Lefèvre on&nbsp;the basis of Benoit, and presented to Philip of Burgundy, founder&nbsp;of the order of the Toison d’Or. Jason is shown as a foremost figure&nbsp;in tournaments, overthrowing all competitors at one held by the&nbsp;king of Bœotia to celebrate the knighting of his son Hercules.&nbsp;The two become staunch friends and attend the marriage ceremony&nbsp;of Hippodamia. Centaurs interrupt and are exterminated by Jason.&nbsp;He performs other knightly exploits, and on his return is maliciously sent by his uncle Peleus (Pelias) on the Argonautic expedition.&nbsp;The narrative of the journey to Lemnos and Colchos, the love of&nbsp;Medea, and the episode of the Golden Fleece follows the classical&nbsp;traditions. When Jason returns to the country of the Myrmidons,&nbsp;Medea by enchantment restores the old king to youth and brings&nbsp;about the death of Peleus. For this last good deed Medea is&nbsp;bauished, with Jason’s consent, and is carried oft’ by four dragons.&nbsp;She soars long over Greece before she is able to find her lover ; at&nbsp;length she discovers that he is going to wed the princess of Corinth.&nbsp;She descends amid thunder and lightning, kills the two children&nbsp;she bore to Jason, and allows her attendant dragons to destroy&nbsp;with fire Corinth and all its inhabitants. She then inveigles the&nbsp;old Egeus, king of Athens, into marriage, but is banished upon&nbsp;suspicion of attempting to poison her new son-in-law Theseus.&nbsp;Meeting with Jason, who had escaped the burning of Corinth, she&nbsp;becomes reconciled to him, and, abjuring magic, on the death of&nbsp;Eson becomes a good wife and queen. The manners and sentiments of the 15th century are made to harmonize with the classical&nbsp;legends after the fashion of the Italian pre-Raphaelite painters,&nbsp;who equipped Jewish warriors with knightly lance and armour.&nbsp;The story is well told ; the digressions are few ; and there are&nbsp;many touches of domestic life and natural sympathy. The first&nbsp;edition is believed to have been printed at Bruges in 1474 ; the&nbsp;type is the same as that used in the first edition of the Recueil.&nbsp;Caxton translated the book at the command of the duchess of&nbsp;Burgundy. A Dutch translation appeared at Haarlem in 1495.&nbsp;M. Paulin Paris doubts whether the romance was written by Lefèvre,&nbsp;whose authorship is distinctly asserted by Caxton. Montfaucon&nbsp;refers to a MS. by Guido delle Colonne, Historia Medeæ et Jasonis&nbsp;(unpublished). There is a Histoire de la Tlιοisοn J Or (1516) by&nbsp;Guillaume Fillastre, written about 1440-50.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(Edipus.—A kind of introduction to the Recueil is Le Roman d'Œdipus, Fils de Lαyus (n.d.), written in the 15th century by an&nbsp;unknown pen. The story follows the fable told by the Greek&nbsp;poets, adapted, of course, to the taste and habits of later times.&nbsp;The sphinx is drawn as a giant of great subtlety and ferocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. The wonders revealed through the Asiatic expedition of Alexander gave rise to a remarkable development of&nbsp;the marvellous in historical composition. The histories of&nbsp;Onesicritus, Aristobulus, and Clitarchus, themselves members of the expedition, were so full of unheard-of things&nbsp;that they soon fell into disrepute. Callisthenes, another&nbsp;companion of Alexander, also wrote an account, which is&nbsp;lost, but his name remains connected with a spurious work&nbsp;in which were crystallized all the fabulous tales of the conqueror. The life of Alexander had every quality to appeal&nbsp;to the imagination. His marvellous career, his genius as&nbsp;a soldier and ruler, the beauty of his person, his early&nbsp;death, were subjects for legend almost in his own day ;&nbsp;and a cloud of mythical story soon floated round his&nbsp;memory. Quintus Curtius, who drew from some of these&nbsp;suspicious sources, is a more critical authority, though he&nbsp;allowed rhetorical fancy to embellish his narration. It&nbsp;is a great fall from the Latin historian to the Pseudo-Callisthenes. The work we possess under the latter title&nbsp;represents the second stage of the Alexander myth. Some&nbsp;of the MSS. attribute it to Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Æsop,&nbsp;as well as to Callisthenes,—all with equal verisimilitude.&nbsp;To reconstruct the true from the spurious work is an impossible task after the increased vogue given to the latter&nbsp;by the re-opening of the East to Europe by the Romans,&nbsp;when all the traditions became remoulded in the form they&nbsp;now possess. Among the histories separate from Pseudo-Callisthenes and subsequent to Quintus Curtius is an&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Itinerarium Alexandra,</span><span class="font1"> in Latin, but of Greek origin,&nbsp;which is little else than an amplification of the apocryphal&nbsp;letter of Alexander to Aristotle. It is dedicated to Con-stans, son of the emperor Constantine. Similarities between the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Itinerarium</span><span class="font1"> and the Latin version of Pseudo-Callisthenes prove that the stories were current in the 4th&nbsp;century, and may have emanated from the same source ;&nbsp;but, while the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Itinerarium</span><span class="font1"> is inferior in authority to&nbsp;Quintus Curtius, it is less a collection of mere fables than&nbsp;is Callisthenes. The Greek text of the latter is supposed&nbsp;to have been written in Alexandria at the commencement&nbsp;of the third century, and to have been translated into&nbsp;Latin by Julius Valerius before 340. The translation&nbsp;was abridged in Latin some time before the 9th century.&nbsp;Much of the work is a running travesty of the true history&nbsp;of the conqueror. The first book deals with his birth and&nbsp;early exploits. The trace of Alexandrian influence is to&nbsp;be found in the pretence that his actual father was Nec-tanebus, a fugitive king of Egypt. The latter was a great&nbsp;magician, able, by operating upon waxen figures of the&nbsp;armies and ships of his enemies, to obtain complete power&nbsp;over their real actions. He was obliged, however, to fly to&nbsp;Pella, where he established himself as a doctor and was&nbsp;visited by Queen Olympias to get advice upon her continued sterility. He promised that Jupiter Ammon should&nbsp;perform the cure in the shape of a dragon. To make&nbsp;quite sure Nectanebus himself took the place of the animal,&nbsp;and nine months afterwards Philip became the father of&nbsp;the future Alexander. At first there was some unpleasantness, but a reappearance of the dragon convinced everybody that the infant really was the son of a god, so that&nbsp;the putative father could no longer object. Alexander&nbsp;was small and somewhat deformed, but of great courage&nbsp;and intelligence. He was educated under the supervision&nbsp;of Nectanebus, who at last died through a fall into a pit,&nbsp;into which he had been playfully pushed by his royal&nbsp;pupil. The second book continues the various conquests,&nbsp;and the third contains the victory over Porus, the relations&nbsp;with the Brahmans, the letter to Aristotle on the wonders&nbsp;of India, the histories of Candaces and the Amazons, the&nbsp;letter to Olympias on the marvels of Further Asia, and&nbsp;lastly the account of Alexander’s death in Babylon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Callisthenes was translated into Syriac and Armenian in the 5th century. A second Latin abridgment is known&nbsp;as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia de Præliis.</span><span class="font1"> The letter from Alexander to&nbsp;Aristotle on the marvels of India, the correspondence&nbsp;between the king and the wise Brahman Dindimus, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Geηtibus Indiæ,</span><span class="font1"> ascribed to Palladius, are different parts&nbsp;of the same legend. The myth had a wider circulation&nbsp;than any of the others we have yet dealt with, and the&nbsp;East contributed its share as well as the West. Persians&nbsp;and Arabs told the deeds of Iskander; and Firdousi made&nbsp;use of the story in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shah-Namah.</span><span class="font1"> Another early&nbsp;Persian poet, Nizami, made the story specially his own.&nbsp;The crusaders brought back fresh developments ; Gog and&nbsp;Magog (partly Arab and partly Greek) and some Jewish&nbsp;stories were then added. In the llth century Simeon&nbsp;Seth, protovestiarius at the Byzantine court, translated the&nbsp;fabulous history from the Persian back into Greek. In&nbsp;the following century was built up the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geste d<sup>,</sup>Alexandre&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">by the successive labours of Lambert le Cort, Alexandre&nbsp;Bernai, Jehan le Nevelais, Gautier de Cambrai, Pierre de&nbsp;Saint-Cloud, Brisebarre, &amp;c. Alexander becomes then a&nbsp;knightly king, surrounded by his twelve paladins. Bernai&nbsp;says that the foundation was Latin (? Valerius or some&nbsp;other Latin version of Pseudo-Callisthenes) :</span></p>
