<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">the 29th natural order, </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Camtanacea.</span><span class="font4"> The capfule is bilocular, the corolla cylindrical, and villous without;&nbsp;the iligma bifid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">REUd I.INGEN, a handſome, free, and imperial town oſ Germany, in the circle oſ Suabia, and duchy&nbsp;of wirtemberg ; ſeated in a plain on the river Eſchez,&nbsp;near the Neckar, adorned with handſome public build-ings, and has a well frequented college. E. Long. 9.&nbsp;10. N. Lat. 48. 31.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">REVE, Reeve, or </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Grew,</span><span class="font4"> the bailiff of a franchife, or manor, thus called, eſpecially in the weft of Eng-land. Hence ſhire-reeve, iheriff, port-greve, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">REVEILLE, a beat of drum about break of day, to give notice that it is time for the ſoldiers to ariſe,&nbsp;and that the ſentries are to forbear challenging.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RE∙vEL, a port town of Livonia, ſituated at the ſouth entrance of the gulph of Finland, partly in a plain&nbsp;and partly on a mountain ; 133 miles ſouth-weft of Pe-terſhurg, and 85 ſonth-eaſt of Abo. It is a place of&nbsp;great trade, and holds two Υtrirs yearly, which are vi-ſited by merchants from all countries, but particularly&nbsp;by thoſe oſ England and Holland. It is a ſtrong and&nbsp;a rich place, with a capital harbour. It is ſurrounded&nbsp;with high walls and deep ditches, and defended by a&nbsp;caſtle and ſtout baſtions. It was confirmed to the&nbsp;Swedes at the peace of oliva, conquered by Peter the&nbsp;Great in 1710, and ceded to Ruſſia in 1721. The&nbsp;conqueſt of it was again attempted by the Swedes in&nbsp;1790. The duke of Sudermania, with the Swediih&nbsp;fleet, attempted to carry the harbour ; but after an ob-ſtinate engagement with the Ruffian fleet, he was obliged to give it up ; but it was but for a very ſhort&nbsp;while. He retired about 10 leagues from the harbour,&nbsp;to repair the damage his fleet had fuſtained, and to prepare for a ſecond attack before any relief could be afforded to the Ruſſian fleet. As ſoon as he had refitted,&nbsp;he failed for the harbour, at a league diſtant from&nbsp;which the Ruſſian fleet was diſcovered, ready to dispute&nbsp;with the Swedes the entrance. Upon a council being&nbsp;held by the Duke, it was reſolved to attack the Ruffians ; and the ſignals being given, the fleet bore down&nbsp;for the attack, which was maintained for near fix hours&nbsp;with the utmoſt fury : at length the Swedes broke the&nbsp;Ruſſian line, which threw them into much confuſion ;&nbsp;when the Swedes, taking the advantage of the general&nbsp;confuſion into which the Ruffians were thrown, followed them with their whole force into the harbour, where&nbsp;the conflict and carnage were dreadful on both ſides,&nbsp;though the Swedes certainly had the worſt of it ; at the&nbsp;fame time that their ſkill and bravery is indiſputable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">This valuable place was again confirmed to Ruſſia by the peace. The government of Revel or Eſt-honia is one of the diviſions of the Ruffian empire, containing five diſtricts. 1. Revel, on the Baltic ſea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Baltic-port, about 40 verſts weſtward ſrom Revel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Habſal, or Hapſal, a maritime town. 4. weiffen-ſtein, on the rivulet Saida, about 80 verſts from Revel.&nbsp;5. weſenberg, about 100 verſts from Revel, at about&nbsp;an equal diſtance from that town and Naιva.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">REVELATION, the act of revealing, or making a thing public that was before unknown ; it is alſo uſtd&nbsp;for the diſcoveries made by God to his prophets, and&nbsp;by them to the world ; and more particularly for the&nbsp;books of the Qld and New Teſtament. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bible<sub>;</sub></span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

<p><span class="font4">The principal teſts of the truth of any revelation, are the tendency of its practical doctrines ; its conliſten-cy with itſelf, and with the known attributes of God ;&nbsp;and ſome fatisfactory evidence that it cannot have been&nbsp;derived from a human ſouree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Before any man can receive a written book as a re-velation from God, he muſt be convinced that God ex-iſts, and that he is poffeffed oſ almighty power, infinite wildom, and perfect jnſtice Now ſhould a book&nbsp;teaching abſurd or immoral doctrines (as many chapters&nbsp;of the Koran do, and as all the traditionary fyſtems&nbsp;of Paganiſm did), pretend to be revealed by a God of&nbsp;wiſdom and juſtice, we may ſafely reject its pretenfions&nbsp;without farther examination than what is neceffary to&nbsp;ſatisfy us that we have not mifunderſtood its doctrine.&nbsp;Should a book claiming this high origin, enjoin in one&nbsp;part oſ it, and forbid in another, the ſame thing to be&nbsp;done under the ſame circumſtances, we may reject it&nbsp;with contempt and indignation ; becauſe a being of infinite wiſdom can never act capriciouſly or abſurdlv.&nbsp;Still, however, as it is impoſſible for us to know how&nbsp;far the powers of men may reach in the inveſtigation or&nbsp;diſcovery of uſeful truth, ſome farther evidence is neceſ-ſary to prove a doctrine of divine origin, than its mere&nbsp;confiſtency with itſelf', and with the principles of&nbsp;morality ; and this evidence can be nothing but the&nbsp;power of working miracles exhibited by him by whom&nbsp;it was originally revealed. Tn every revelation confirmed by this evidence, many doctrines are to be looked&nbsp;for which human reaſon cannot fully comprehend ; and&nbsp;theſe are to be believed on the teſtimony oſ God, and&nbsp;ſuffered to produce their practical conſequences. At&nbsp;this kind of belief the ſhallow infidel may ſmile con-temptuouſiy ; but it has place in arts and ſciences as</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">well as in religion, whoever avails himfelf of the demon-ſtrations of Newton, Bernoulli, and others, refpectinœ the refiſtance of fluids, and applies their conclu lions to&nbsp;the art of flιip-h&gt;uilding, is as implicit a believer, if he&nbsp;underſtand not the principles of fluxions, as any Chri-ſtian ; and yet no man will fay that his faith is not pro-ductive of important practical confequences. He believes, however, in man, while the Chriſtian believes in&nbsp;God ; and therefore he cannot pretend that his faith&nbsp;reſts on a ſurer foundation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr Locke, in laying down the diſtinct provinces of reaſon and faith, obſerves, 1. That the fame truths&nbsp;may be diſcovered by revelation which are discoverable to us by reaſon. 2. That no revelation can bc&nbsp;admitted againſt the clear evidence of reafon. 3. That&nbsp;there are many things of which we have but imper-fect notions, or none at all ; and ethers, of whoſe&nbsp;paſt, prefent, or future exiſtence, by the natural uſe&nbsp;of our faculties we cannot have the leaſt knowledge:&nbsp;and theſe, being beyond the diſcovery of our faculties,&nbsp;and above reafon, when revealed, become the proper&nbsp;object of our faith. He then adds, that our reafon&nbsp;is not injured or diſturbed, but aſſiſted and improved,&nbsp;by new diſcoveries of truth coming from the fountain&nbsp;of knowledge, whatever Gβd has revealed is certainly&nbsp;true ; but whether it be a divine re velation. or not, rea-fon muſt judge, which can never permit the mind to&nbsp;reject a greater evidence to embrace what is leſs evi-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
