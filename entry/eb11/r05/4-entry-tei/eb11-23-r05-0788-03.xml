<p><label>ROWLOCK</label>
(pronounced <hi rend="italic">rullock</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rollock),</hi> a device on the gunwale of a boat in or on which an oar rests, forming a fulcrum for the oar in rowing. The word is a corruption due to “ row ” of the earlier “ oar-lock,” O.E. <hi rend="italic">arldc,</hi> a lock or enclosed place for an oar. The simplest form of rowlock is a notch, square or rounded, on the gunwale, in which the oar rests; other kinds are formed by two pins or pegs, “ thole pins ” (thole being ultimately the same word as Norw. <hi rend="italic">toll,</hi> a young fir-tree), and by a swivel with two horns of metals, pivoted in the gunwale or on an outrigger (see Oar).</p>
