<p><span class="font2">The history of Rhodes during the Persian wars is quite obscure. In the 5th century the three cities were enrolled in&nbsp;the Delian League, and democracies became prevalent. In&nbsp;412 the island revolted from Athens and became the headquarters of the Pelopoimesian fleet. Four years later the inhabitants for the most part abandoned their former residences&nbsp;and concentrated in the newly founded city of Rhodes. This&nbsp;town, which was laid out on an exceptionally fine site according&nbsp;to a scientific plan by the architect Hippodamus of Miletus,&nbsp;soon rose to considerable importance, and attracted much of&nbsp;the Aegean and Levantine commerce which had hitherto been&nbsp;in Athenian hands. In the 4th century its poIitical development was arrested by constant struggles between oligarchs and&nbsp;democrats, who in turn brought the city under the control of&nbsp;Sparta (412-395, 391-378), of Athens (395“39U 378-357), and&nbsp;of the Carian dynasty of Maussollus (357-340). It seems that&nbsp;about 340 the island was conquered for the Persian king by his&nbsp;Rhodian admiral Mentor; in 332 it submitted to Alexander&nbsp;the Great. Upon Alexander’s death the people expelled their&nbsp;Macedonian garrison, and henceforth not only maintained their&nbsp;independence but acquired great political influence. The&nbsp;expansion of Levantine trade which ensued in the Hellenistic&nbsp;age brought especial profit to Rhodes, whose standard of coinage&nbsp;and maritime law became widely accepted in the Mediterranean.&nbsp;Under a modified type of democracy, in which the chief power&nbsp;would seem to have rested normally with the six </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Trpvravets,</span><span class="font2"> or&nbsp;heads of the executive, the city enjoyed a long period of remarkably good administration. The chief success of the government&nbsp;lay in the field of foreign politics, where it prudently avoided&nbsp;entanglement in the ambitious schemes of Hellenistic monarchs,&nbsp;but gained great prestige by energetic interference against&nbsp;aggressors who threatened the existing balance of power or the&nbsp;security of the seas. The chief incidents of Rhodian history&nbsp;during this period are a memorable siege by Demetrius Polior-cetes in 304, who sought in vain to force the city into active&nbsp;alliance with King Antigonus by means of his formidable fleet&nbsp;and artillery; a severe earthquake in 227, the damages of which&nbsp;all the other Hellenistic states contributed to repair, because they&nbsp;could not afford to see the island ruined; some vigorous campaigns against Byzantium, the Pergamene and the Pontic&nbsp;kings, who had threatened the Black Sea trade-route (220 sqq.),&nbsp;and against the pirates of Crete. In accordance with their&nbsp;settled policy the Rhodians eagerly supported the Romans when&nbsp;these made war upon Philip V. of Macedon and Antiochus III.&nbsp;of Syria on behalf of the minor Greek states. In return for&nbsp;their more equivocal attitude during the Third Macedonian&nbsp;.War they were deprived by Rome of some possessions in Lycia,&nbsp;and damaged by the partial diversion of their trade to Delos&nbsp;(167). Nevertheless during the two Mithradatic wars they&nbsp;remained loyal to the republic, and in 88 successfully stood a&nbsp;siege by the Pontic king. The Rhodian navy, which had distinguished itself in most of these wars, did further good service&nbsp;on behalf of Pompey in his campaigns against the pirates and&nbsp;against Julius Caesar. A severe blow was struck against the&nbsp;city in 43 by C. Cassius, who besieged and ruthlessly plundered&nbsp;the people for refusing to submit to his exactions. Though&nbsp;Rhodes continued a free town for another century, its commercial&nbsp;prosperity was crippled and a series of extensive earthquakes&nbsp;after </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 155 completed the ruin of the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ln the days of its greatest power Rhodes became famous as a centre of pictorial and plastic art it gave rise to a school of eclectic&nbsp;oratory whose chief representative was Apollonius Molon, the&nbsp;teacher of Cicero; it was the birthplace of the Stoic philosopher&nbsp;Panaerius; the home of the poet Apollonius Rhodius and the&nbsp;historian Posidonius. Protogenes embellished the city with his&nbsp;paintings, and Chares of Lindus with the celebrated colossal statue&nbsp;of the sun-god, which was 105 ft. high. The colossus stood for&nbsp;fifty-six years, till an earthquake prostrated it in 224 </span><span class="font2">B.c. </span><span class="font1">lts&nbsp;enormous fragments continued to excite wonder in the time of&nbsp;Pliny, and were not removed till a.d. 656, when Rhodes was conquered by the Saracens, who sold the remains for old metal to a&nbsp;dealer, who employed nine hundred camels to carry them away.&nbsp;The notion that the colossus once stood astride over the entrance&nbsp;to the harbour is a medieval fiction. During the later Roman&nbsp;empire Rhodes was the capital of the province of the islands. Its&nbsp;history under the Byzantine rule is uneventful ,but for some temporary&nbsp;occupations by the Saracens (653-658, 717-718), and the gradual&nbsp;encroachment of Venetian traders since 1082. In the 13th century&nbsp;the island stood as a rule under the control of Italian adventurers,&nbsp;who were, however, at times compelled to acknowledge the overlordship of the emperors of Nicaea, and failed to protect it against&nbsp;the depredations of Turkish corsairs. In 1309 it was conquered&nbsp;by the Knights Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem at the instigation of the pope and the Genoese, and converted into a great fortress&nbsp;for the protection of the southern seas against the Turks. Under&nbsp;their mild and just rule both the native Greeks and the Italian&nbsp;residents were able to carry on a brisk trade. But the piratical&nbsp;acts of these traders, in which the knights themselves sometimes&nbsp;joined, and the strategic position of the island between Constantinople and the Levant, necessitated its reduction by the Ottoman&nbsp;sultans. A siege in 1480 by Mahomet II. led to the repulse&nbsp;of the Turks with severe losses; after a second investment, during&nbsp;which Sultan Suleiman I. is said to have lost </span><span class="font2">90,000 </span><span class="font1">men out of a&nbsp;force of 200,000, the knights evacuated Rhodes under an honourable&nbsp;capitulation (1522). The population henceforth dwindled in consequence of pestilence and emigration, and although the island&nbsp;recovered somewhat in the 18th century under a comparatively&nbsp;lenient rule it was brought to a very low ebb owing to the severity&nbsp;of its governor during the Greek revolution. The sites of Lindus,&nbsp;lalysus, and Camirus, which in the most ancient times were the&nbsp;principal towns, of the island, are clearly marked, and the first&nbsp;of the three is still occupied by a small town with a medieval castle,&nbsp;both of them dating, from the time of the knights, though the&nbsp;castle occupies the site of the ancient acropolis, of the walls of&nbsp;which considerable remains are still visible. There are no ruins&nbsp;of any importance on the site of cither lalysus or Camirus, but&nbsp;excavations, at the latter place have produced valuable and interesting results in the way of ancient vases and other antiquities, which&nbsp;are now in the British Museum. Rhodes was again famous for&nbsp;its. pottery in medieval times; this was a lustre ware at first&nbsp;imitated from Persian, though it afterwards developed into an&nbsp;independent style of fine colouring and rich variety of design.</span></p>
