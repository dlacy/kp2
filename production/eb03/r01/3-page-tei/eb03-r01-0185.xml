Barretin, the keeper of the feals, next addreſſcd the aſſembly<hi rend="sup">,</hi>in a congratulatory and unintereſting ſpeech. He was followed by the popular miniſter M. Neckar, who ſpoke for three hours. Though much applauded on account of the clear financial details which his ſpeech contained, he encountered a certain degree of cenſure from all parties, on account of the cautious ambiguity which he obferved with regard to the future proceedings of the ſtates-generah</p><p>Next day the three orders aſſembled ſcparately. The deputies of the <hi rend="italic">tiers etat</hi>  amounted to 600 in number, and thoſe of the nobles and clergy to 300 each. During their firſt fittings much time was ſpent in unimportant debates about trifling points of form ; but the firſt important queſtion, that neceſſarily became the fubject of their diſcuſſion, was the <hi rend="italic">verification •ſ thctr powers,</hi>  or production of the commiſſions of the members, and inveſtigation of their authenticity. The commons <hi rend="italic">(tiers etat)</hi>  laid hold of this as a pretext for opening the grand controverſy, whether the ſtates-general ſhould fit in one or in three feparate chambers ? They ſent a deputation inviting the nobles and the clergy to meet along with them in the common hall for the purpoſe of <hi rend="italic">verifying their powers</hi>  in one common aſſembly. In the chamber of the clergy 114 members voted for the performance of this ceremony in the general aſſembly ; and 133 againſt it. But in the more haughty order of the nobles, the refolution for the verification in their own aſſembly was carried by a majority of 188 againſt 47. The commons paid no regard to this. They were conducted by bold and ſkilful leaders, who diſ-cerned the importance of the point in conteſt, and re-folved not to abandon it. Aware of the exigencies of the ſtate, they knew that the crown was nearly verging upon bankruptcy ; and that ſuch were the deficiencies of the revenue that only a ſhort delay was neceſſary to accompliſh the abſolute diſſolution of the government. They ſuſſered five weeks to pals away therefore in total inactivity. During this period propoſals were made on the part of the miniſtry for a pacification between the three orders, and conferences were opened by com-miſſioners from each. But no art could ſeduce the commons from their original purpoſe, or prevail with them to enter upon the bull nefs of the ſtate.</p><p>The nation had expected much from the aſſembling of the ſtates-general, and learnt the news of their inaction with no fmall degree of concern. The <hi rend="italic">tiers etat</hi>  was naturally popular, and the public cenſure could not readily devolve upon that favourite order. Moreover, ſrom the firſt period of their aſſembling the commons made every effort to augment their own natural popularity. They admitted all perſons promiſcuoufly into the galleries, and even into the body of their hail. No reſtraint was attempted to be laid upon the moſt vehement marks oſ popular applauſe or cenſure. Lifts of the voters names were publicly taken and ſent to Paris upon every remarkable occaſion ; and the members ſud-denly found themſelves become, according to their political ſentiments, the objects of general execration or applauſe. The new and bold notions of liberty that were daily advanced by the leaders of the <hi rend="italic">tiers etat</hi>  were received with acclamation by their hearers. The capi-tal became intereſted in the iſſue of every debate ; and the political fervor was eagerly imbibed by the nation with that vivacity which is ſo peculiar to the French. The commons accuſed the nobles of obſtinately impeding the buſineſs of the ſtate, by refuſing to verify their powers in one common aſſembly. The accuſation was ſwallowed by the multitude, who ſaw not, or were unwilling to ſee, that the attack was made by their own favourite order. In the mean time the nobles became rapidly more and more unpopular. Their perfons were inſulted, new publications daily came forth, and were greedily bought up, which reviled their whole order, and repreſented them as an uſeleſs or pernicious body of men, whoſe exiſtence ought not to be tolerated in a free ſtate. whoever adhered to them was branded with the odious appellation of <hi rend="italic">Briβocrate.</hi>  The clergy, from the influence of the pariſh <hi rend="italic">curés</hi>  or parfons, feemed ready</p><p>to defert their cauſe. They were even oppoſed by a minority of their own body, which derived luſtre from ha-ving at its head the duke of orleans, the firſt prince of the blood. Still, however, the majority of the nobles remained firm ; well aware, that if they once con-fented to lit in the ſame aſſembly, and to vote promif-cuouſly, with the ambitious and more numerous body of the commons, their wdιole order, and all its ſplendid privileges, muſt ſpeedily be overthrown.</p><p>The leaders of the commons ſaw the change that was taking place in the minds of men ; and they at length regarded the period as arrived when they ought to emerge from their inactivity, and execute the daring project of ſeizing the legiſlative authority in their country. They declared that the reprefentatives of the nobles and the clergy were only the deputies of particular incorporations whom they would allow to fit and vote along with themſelves ; but who had no title in a collective capacity to act as the legiſlators of Franc,e. For conducting buſineſs with more facility, they appointed 20 committees. In conſequence of a propoſal by the Abbé Sieyes, a final meſſage was fent to the privileged orders requiring their attendance as individuals, and intimating that the commons, as thc deputies of 96 out of every hundred of their country-men, were about to affume the exclufive power of le-giſlation. None of the nobles obeyed this ſummons ; but three cures, Meſſrs Ceſve, Ballard, and Jalot, preſented their commiſſions, and were received with loud acclamations. They were next day followed by five more, among whom were Meſſrs Gregoire, Dillon, and Bodineau. After ſome debate concerning the appella-tion which they ought to affirme, the commons, with ſuch of the clergy as had joined them, ſolemnly voted themſelves the fovereign legiſlators of their country un-derthe name of the <hi rend="italic">National Λffembly,</hi>  The reſultof the vote was no ſooner declared, than the hall reſounded</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
