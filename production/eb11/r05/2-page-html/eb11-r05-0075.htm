<p><span class="font0">ferries. Rumania has no canals, and the canalization of its rivers is impeded by drought and floods. The Pruth and Sereth are&nbsp;navigable for a short distance by small sailing craft; the conservancy&nbsp;of the Danube </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> is controlled by a European commission, which&nbsp;sits at Galatz. Besides river services, the state maintains lines of&nbsp;sea-going ships from Constantza to Constantinople and the Aegean&nbsp;Islands, and from Braila to Rotterdam. In 1908 the ports of&nbsp;Rumania were entered by 32,888 vessels of 9,269,000 tons, of which&nbsp;30,504 of 6,529,000 tons belonged to the river (Danubian) trade.&nbsp;The merchant navy of Rumania comprised about 495 vessels of&nbsp;145,000 tons, including 88 steamers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Population.—</span><span class="font0">The population </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">Rumania numbered 5,912,520 in 1899, and about 6,850,000 in 1910. Fully 6,000,000&nbsp;of these were Rumans or Vlachs (g.v.). The population of&nbsp;foreign descent comprises many Jews, Armenians, gipsies,&nbsp;Greeks, Germans, Turks, Tatars and Magyars, Servians and&nbsp;Bulgarians. The Jews increase more rapidly than any of these&nbsp;peoples except the Armenians. They usually congregate in the&nbsp;larger towns, though in northern Moldavia there are a few&nbsp;purely Jewish villages, recalling those of Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The bitter feeling against them in Rumania is not so much due to religious fanaticism as to the fear that if given political and&nbsp;other rights they will gradually possess themselves of the whole&nbsp;soil. In many towns in northern Moldavia the Jews are in a&nbsp;majority, and their total numbers in Rumania are about 300,000,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> about one-twentieth of the entire population, a larger ratio&nbsp;than exists in any other country in the world. In many places&nbsp;they have the monopoly of the wine and spirit shops, and retail&nbsp;trade generally; and as they arc always willing to advance&nbsp;money on usury, and are more intelligent and better educated&nbsp;than the ordinary peasant, there is little doubt that in a country&nbsp;where the large landowners are proverbially extravagant, and&nbsp;the peasant proprietors needy, the soil would soon fall into the&nbsp;hands of the Jews were it not for the stringent laws which prevent them from owning land outside the towns. When in&nbsp;addition it is considered that the Moldavian Jews, who are&nbsp;mostly of Polish and Russian origin, speak a foreign language,&nbsp;wear a distinguishing dress and keep themselves aloof from&nbsp;their neighbours, the antipathy in which they are held by the&nbsp;Rumanians generally may be understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The gipsies, who are mostly converts to the Orthodox Church, still, as a rule, cling to their vagabond existence, though their&nbsp;skill at all handicrafts finds them ready employment in the towns.&nbsp;During their centuries of slavery, they were organized into&nbsp;castes, as musicians, metal workers, masons, &amp;c.; but after&nbsp;about 1850 the bonds of caste were gradually relaxed and&nbsp;gipsies began to intermarry with Rumans. The Greeks form a&nbsp;floating population of merchants and small traders, anxious to&nbsp;amass a fortune and return home. German and Austrian&nbsp;business men visit the country in large numbers, and colonics&nbsp;of German farmers flourish among the mountains of Little&nbsp;Walachia. In central Moldavia there is a large population of&nbsp;Magyar descent, and the Servian and Bulgarian elements are&nbsp;strong near the Danube. The interior of the Dobrudja is occupied largely by Turks and Bulgarians, with Tatars, Russians and&nbsp;Armenians, but here the Ruman steadily gains ground at the&nbsp;expense of the alien. At Megidia, a flourishing town of about&nbsp;10,000 inhabitants, which sprang up after 1S60 between Cerna-voda and Constantza<sup>1</sup>, the Tatars predominate. Russians of&nbsp;the Lipovan sect live in exile in Bucharest and other cities,&nbsp;earning a livelihood as cab-drivers, and wearing the long coats&nbsp;and round caps of their countrymen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">National Characteristics.—</span><span class="font0">Two dissimilar types are noticeable among the Rumans. One is fair-haired, florid and blue-eyed;&nbsp;the other, more frequent among the Carpathians, is dark,&nbsp;resembling the southern Italians. Both alike are hardy,&nbsp;though rarely tall; both, when of the peasant class, frugal&nbsp;and inured to toil amid the rigours of their native climate.&nbsp;Proud of their race and country, they acquired, with their&nbsp;independence, an ardent sense of nationality; and they look&nbsp;forward to the day which will reunite them to their kinsmen&nbsp;in Transylvania and Bessarabia. They have been taught,&nbsp;originally in the interests of Transylvanian Roman Catholicism,&nbsp;to regard themselves as true descendants of the Romans. The&nbsp;peasants retain their distinctive dress, long discarded, except&nbsp;on festivals and at court, by the wealthier classes. Men wear&nbsp;a long linen tunic, leather belt, white woollen trousers and&nbsp;leather gaiters, above Turkish slippers or sandals. The low-landers’ head-dress is generally a high cylindrical cap of rough&nbsp;cloth or felt, while the mountaineers prefer a small round&nbsp;straw hat. Sundays and holidays bring out a sleeveless jacket,&nbsp;embroidered in red and gold; and both sexes wear sheepskins&nbsp;in cold weather. The linen dresses of women are fastened by&nbsp;a long sash or girdle, wound many times round the waist;&nbsp;the holiday attire being a white gown covered with embroideries,&nbsp;one or more brightly coloured aprons and necklaces of beads&nbsp;or coins. The standard of comfort is lowest along the Danube&nbsp;and in parts of the Dobrudja. As the land becomes higher,&nbsp;the dwellings improve; but, despite the presence of a doctor&nbsp;in each commune, disease is everywhere rife. Many villages&nbsp;are wholly built of timber and thatch, especially amongst the&nbsp;Carpathians, the floors being frequently raised on piles, several&nbsp;feet above the ground. The inner walls are often hung with&nbsp;hand-woven tapestries, which harmonize well with the smoke-blackened rafters, the primitive loom and the huge Dutch&nbsp;stove characteristic of a prosperous Rumanian farm. Many&nbsp;pagan beliefs linger on in the country, where vampires, witches&nbsp;and the evil eye are dreaded by all. The peasants reassure&nbsp;themselves by the use of charms and spells, and by a strict&nbsp;observance of the forms which their creed prescribes. A cross&nbsp;guards every well or spring; every home has its </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ikons</span><span class="font0"> or sacred&nbsp;pictures. Church festivals and fasts are kept with equal care.&nbsp;For months together a Ruman will subsist </span><span class="font1">cm </span><span class="font0">vegetables and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mamaliga,</span><span class="font0"> the maize porridge that forms his staple diet. Beef&nbsp;and mutton are rarely touched, and in some districts pork is&nbsp;only eaten on St Hilary’s day (the 20th of December, O.S.).&nbsp;Veal is the one kind of meat generally consumed. Wine and&nbsp;plum-spirit, or the more powerful brandy distilled from grain,&nbsp;are drunk in great quantities by the townsfolk, more sparingly&nbsp;by countrymen;* Rumans generally being more sober than&nbsp;the western Europeans. The ceremonies which accompany a&nbsp;wedding preserve the tradition of marriage by capture; a&nbsp;peasant bride must enter her new home carrying bread and&nbsp;salt, and in parts of Walachia a flower is painted on the outer&nbsp;wall of cottages in which there is a girl old enough to marry.&nbsp;Young men swear eternal brotherhood; girls, eternal sisterhood; and the Church ratifies their choice in a service at&nbsp;which the feet of the pair arc chained together. This relationship is morally and legally regarded as not less binding than&nbsp;kinship by birth. The dead are borne to the grave with uncovered faces, and a Rumanian funeral is a scene of much&nbsp;barbaric display. All classes delight in music and dancing.&nbsp;Women hold spinning-parties at which the leader begins a&nbsp;ballad, and each in turn contributes a verse. A number of&nbsp;satirical folk-tales (largely of Turkish origin) are current at&nbsp;the expense of Jew, gipsy or parish priest. The Rumanian&nbsp;folk-songs, sung and often improvised by the villagers, or by a&nbsp;wandering guitar-player </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(cobzar),</span><span class="font0"> are of exceptional interest&nbsp;and beauty (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Literature,</span><span class="font0"> below). The national dances&nbsp;and music closely resemble those of the Southern Slavs (see&nbsp;Montenegro and Bulgaria).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Constitution—</span><span class="font0">In 1866, Prince Charles of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringcn was chosen prince of Rumania by a constituent assembly elected under universal suffrage. This body at the&nbsp;same time drew up a constitution, which remains in force,&nbsp;though modified in 1879 and 1884. In 1881, Prince Charles&nbsp;was proclaimed king. As he proved childless, the succession&nbsp;was accepted by his brother, Prince Leopold, on behalf of his&nbsp;son William; and in 1888 William renounced his claim in&nbsp;favour of Ferdinand his younger brother. Thus the monarchy&nbsp;became hereditary in the family of Hohenzollem-Sigmaringcn.&nbsp;No woman may ascend the throne; and, in default of a male&nbsp;heir, the representatives of the people can choose a king among&nbsp;the royal families of western Europe.</span></p>
