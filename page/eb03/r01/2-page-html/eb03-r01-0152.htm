<p><span class="font4">markabIe </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as the </span><span class="font4">body is larger, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font4">eſpecially as it is longer. This may be diſtinctly obſerved. All floating bodies go into the ſtream of the river, becaufe there they&nbsp;find the ſmalleſt obſtruction to the acquiſition of this&nbsp;motion along the inclined plane ; and when a number&nbsp;of bodies are thus floating down the ftream, the largeft&nbsp;and longeft outſtrip the reft. A log of wood floating&nbsp;down in this manner may be obſerved to make its way&nbsp;very faſt among the chips and ſaw-duſt which float a-longſide of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Now when, in the courſe of our experiments, a body is ſupported againſt the action of a ſtream, and the im-pulſe is meaſured by .the force employed to fupport it,&nbsp;it ⅛ plain that part of this force is employed to act&nbsp;againſt that tendency which the body has to outſtrip&nbsp;the ſtream. This does not appear in our experiment,&nbsp;when we move a body with the velocity of this ſtream&nbsp;through ſtill water having a horizontal furface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The other diſtinguiſhing circumſtance is, that the re-tardations of a ſtream ariſing from friction are found to be nearly as the velocities, when, therefore, a&nbsp;ſtream moving in a limited canal is checked by a body&nbsp;put in its way, the diminution of velocity occaſioned by&nbsp;the friction of the ſtream having already produced its effect, the impulſe is not affected by it ; but when the&nbsp;body puts the ftill water in motion, the friction of the&nbsp;bottom produces ſome effect, by retarding the receſs&nbsp;of the water. This, however, muſt be next to no-</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The chief difference will ariſe from its being almoſt impoſſible to make an exact compariſon of the veloci-ties : for when a body is moved againſt the ftream, the&nbsp;relative velocity is the ſame in all the filaments. But&nbsp;■when we expoſe a body to a ftream, the velocity of the&nbsp;different filaments is not the ſame ; becauſe it decreaſes&nbsp;from the middle of the flream to the ſides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr Buat found the total ſenſible refιftance of a plate 12 inches ſquare, and meaſured, not by the height of&nbsp;water in the tube of the perforated box, but by weights&nbsp;acting on the arm of a balance, having its centre 15&nbsp;inches under the ſurface of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font4">ſtream moving three feet&nbsp;per ſecond, to be 19,46 pounds; that of a cube of&nbsp;the ſame dimenfions was 15,22 ; and that of a priſm&nbsp;three feet long was 13,87 ; that of a priſm fix feet long&nbsp;was 14,27. The three ſirſt agree extremely well with&nbsp;the determination of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">q,</span><span class="font4"> by the experiments with&nbsp;the perforated box. The total reſiſtance of the laſt&nbsp;was undoubtedly much increaſed by friction, and by&nbsp;the retrograde force of ſo long a priſm floating in an in-clined ſtream. This laſt by computation is 0,223 pounds;&nbsp;this added to </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">h (m</span><span class="font4"> -j- y), which is 13,59,gives <sup>l</sup>3&gt;θ<sup>1</sup>,&nbsp;leaving 0,46 for the effect of friction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">If the ſame reſiſtances be computed on the ſuppoſi-tion that the body moves in ſtill water, in which caſe we have </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font4"> = 1, and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font4"> for a thin plate = 0,433 » and&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">if </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">q</span><span class="font4"> be computed for the lengths of the other two bo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">dies by the formula 1 — L 1,42 +^^7- ; we ſhall get for </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vs</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">the reſiſtances 14,94; 12,22 ; and 11,49.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hence Mr Buat concludes, that the reſiſtances in theſe two ſtates are nearly in the ratio of 13 to ιo⅛&nbsp;This, he thinks, will account for the difference ohſer-ved in the experiments of different authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr Buat next endeavours to afeertain the quantity </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of water </span><span class="font4">which </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is made to adhere in ſome degree to a</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">body which is carried along thro’ ſtill water, or which remains nearly ſtagnant in the midſt of a ſtream. He&nbsp;takes the ſum of the motions in the direction </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">the&nbsp;ſtream, viz. the ſum of the actual motions of all thoſe&nbsp;particles which have loſt part of their motion, and he&nbsp;divides this ſum by the general velocity of the ſtream.&nbsp;The quotient is equivalent to a certain quantity of water perfectly ſtagnant round the body, without being&nbsp;able to determine this with precilion, he obſerves, that&nbsp;it augments as the reſiſtance diminiſhes ; for in the caſe&nbsp;of a longer body, the filaments are obferved to con-verge to a greater diſtance behind the body. The&nbsp;ſtagnant maſs a-head of the body is more conſtant ; for&nbsp;the deflection and reſiſtance at the prow are obſervcd&nbsp;not to be affected by the length of the body. Mr Buat,&nbsp;by a very nice analyſis of many circumſtances, comes&nbsp;to this conclufion, that the whole quantity of fluid,&nbsp;which in this manner accompanies the ſolid body, re-mains the ſame whatever is the velocity. He might&nbsp;have deduced it at once, from the conſtderation that the&nbsp;curves deſcribed by the filaments are the ſame in all ve-locities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">He then relates a number of experiments made to ſ certain the abſolute quantity thus made to accompany&nbsp;the body. Theſe were made by cauſing pendulums to&nbsp;oſcillate in fluids. Newton had determined the re-ſiſtances to fuch oſcillation by the diminution of the&nbsp;arches of vibration. Mr Buat determines the quantity&nbsp;of dragged fluid by the increaſe of their duration ; for&nbsp;this ſtagnation or dragging is in fact adding a quantity of matter to be moved, without any addition to the&nbsp;moving force. It was ingeniouſly obſerved by Newton,&nbsp;that the time of oſcillation was not fenſibly affected by&nbsp;the reſiſtance of the fluid : a compenfation, almoſt complete, being made by the diminution of the arches of&nbsp;vihration ; and experiment confirmed this. If, there-fore, a great augmentation of the time of vibration be&nbsp;obſerved, it muſt be afcribed to the additional quantity&nbsp;of matter which is thus dragged into motion, and it may&nbsp;be employed for its meafurement. Thus, let a be the&nbsp;length of a pendulum ſwinging féconds in vacuo, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font4"> the length of a ſecond’s pendulum ſwinging in a fluid.&nbsp;Let </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font4"> be the weight of the body in the fluid, and P&nbsp;the weight of the fluid diſplaced by it j.
