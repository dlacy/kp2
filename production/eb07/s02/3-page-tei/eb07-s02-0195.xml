After the Dutch retired, the works were repaired, and have been from time to time vastly strengthened. It is now a complete marine fortress, and a powerful protection to the important anchorage at the Nore, where, in time of war, especially if the port of Antwerp should be in possession of an enemy, it is necessary always to have a strong naval force ready to act. These fortifications were found of great service during the mutiny of the fleet at the Nore in the year 1796. Many of the crews were soon tired of their state of rebellion, rose upon their committees, and slipping their cables, ran under the guns of the forts, and were protected from their associates.</p><p>It is now a regular marine arsenal, chiefly used for repairing ships, and well furnished with every necessary kind of stores, and of late years well supplied with what was previously scarce, good spring-water. It is a part of the parish of Minster, the population of which amounted in 1801 to 5061, in 1811 to 7008, in 1821 to 8414, and in 1831 to 7983. The town itself has diminished from 1422 to sixty- one inhabitants, as dwellings have been removed to make space for ports. It has a market on Saturday, and there is a chapel of ease to Minster church.</p><p>SHEFFIELD, an ancient, large, and flourishing market- town in the west riding of the county of York, 160 miles north-north-west from London. It derives its name from the river Sheaf, which here flows into the Don. These rivers descend from the boldly swelling hills west of the town, and form, with their mountain-tributaries, interesting features in that beautiful scenery for which the neighbourhood has always been noted. The town itself, which used formerly to be described as built upon a gentle hill, rising within an ample valley, has long since stretched over the ascending slopes on every side of its original site, particularly to the west, which is a large suburb of beautiful villas. The inequalities of the ground have not been compensated, either by the regularity of the streets, or by any thing like uniformity in the buildings. The town has been said to be black ; and certainly the smoke emitted from upwards of one hundred steam-engine chimneys, and ten times that number of forges, workshops, &amp;c., to say nothing of what issues from so many dwellings, in a place where coal is cheap, does occasionally form a considerable cloud; but the houses are not more dingy, and the streets generally much cleaner, than in other manufacturing towns of the same size. Few persons have approached the town in any direction, without being struck with the beauty of the surrounding neighbourhood, resembling, in many respects, the varied character of a nobleman’s park ; and it would be difficult to find a single street from which a glimpse of the landscape cannot be obtained. Many of the neighbouring villas are built of a light-coloured stone, while those in the town are mostly of a dark-red brick. A great proportion of the latter, particularly in the newer streets, are small, being the residences of the artisans and working classes generally, almost every family living in a separate dwelling. This independent occupancy, added to the fact that in few cases are the labours of the workmen carried on at home, bespeaks a degree of comfort and cleanliness scarcely to be looked for in buildings where a single room serves at once as the workshop of the industrious man and the residence of his family.</p><p>Sheffield is the modern capital of a somewhat undefined district, which for ages has been called Hallamshire, the present Hallam, a hamlet west of the town, having been considered the site of the ancient capital, where stood the <hi rend="italic">aula,</hi> or chief residence of the Saxon lord.</p><p>Since the sixteenth century, the records of the place show a singularly rapid increase of the population. In 1615 the town contained 2207 souls, in 1755 this number was multiplied sixfold, in 1796 the census was 29,013, in 1821 the population of the entire parish of Sheffield was 65,275, and</p><p>in 1831 the inhabitants wore 91,692; at present they are estimated at 110,000. Of these, about 96,000 may be said to reside in the town and suburbs, the remainder in the out townships. A proportionate increase has taken place in the number of houses. These in 1831 were stated to be 19,700 ; they are now 25,000.</p><p>Sheffield has no municipal head, no stipendiary magistrate, or other paramount local governor. Some of the west-riding magistrates, generally those nearest, for none of them reside within the township, sit in the town-hall twice a week for the current disposal of offenders and other business. In the same building is held the manor court for the recovery of small debts ; and here too are the offices of a night and day police. An attempt was made in 1838 to obtain a corporation, in conformity with the recent act of parliament; but a great majority of the inhabitants opposing the design, it was abandoned.</p><p>The vicinity of Sheffield abounds with the natural elements of prosperity ; and of these the inhabitants were prompt to avail themselves, long before the means of a perfect intercommunication throughout the country had generalized these advantages. On every side of the town coal has been got, and actually within the town itself, the seams, although wrought for centuries, appearing in some places almost inexhaustible. With the coal is found ironstone, which is smelted in the neighbourhood; while clay, slate, and sandstone are abundant, and of excellent quality. A navigable canal, opened in 1819, completed a water-communication between Sheffield and the German Ocean; and in 1838, a railway to Rotherham (six miles) was finished. The line of a railway between Sheffield and Winchester is in progress, including a tunnel of three miles under the English Apennines. The number and rapid descent of the streams west of the town afford innumerable waterfalls, on which grinding establishments have been built, and in which, previous to the introduction of steam power, all the edge- tools and cutlery made in the district were ground and polished.</p><p>Sheffield has long been celebrated, not only throughout Great Britain, but all over the world, for its cutlery manufactures. The origin of this celebrity dates as far back as the reign of Edward III., when “ Sheffield whittles,” as certain common kinds of knives were then and afterwards called, appear to have been in repute. As early as the middle of the sixteenth century, the staple trade was fostered by the feudal lords of Hallamshire, there being still extant the various “ acts and ordinances agreed upon by the whole fellowship of cutlers, and by the assent of George earl of Shrewsbury.” About a century afterwards, when, in consequence of the growing reputation of the various articles manufactured at Sheffield, and the insufficiency of the manor court to restrain the making and vending of spurious wares, the credit of the trade was likely to be endangered, an act of parliament was obtained, by which, under certain regulations, the cutlers of Sheffield were constituted a body corporate. This important act, which bears date April 1624, was designed “ for the good order and government of the makers of knives, sickles, shears, scissors, and other cutlery wares in Hallamshire, in the county of York, and parts adjoining ;" the latter words having reference to a part of Derbyshire immediately south of Sheffield, where vast quantities of scythes and sickles have been made ever since the reign of Elizabeth.</p><p>The Cutlers’ Company consisted of a master elected annually, two warders, six searchers, twenty-four assistants, and the commonalty. Their duties were generally to register apprentices, grant corporate marks to be struck on the wares of the members, and by other means to maintain the integrity of the staple trades. This corporation continued in force, with a slight modification, until the year 1814, when, by an act (54th Geo. III.), the local manufac-</p></body></text></TEI>
