a public place, wherein the languages, the arts, or ſciences, are taught. Thus we ſay, a grammar <hi rend="italic">ſchool,</hi> a writing s <hi rend="italic">chool,</hi> a s <hi rend="italic">cbοοl</hi> of natural philoſophy, &amp;c. — The word is formed from the Latin <hi rend="italic">ſchοla,</hi> which, according to Du Cange, ſigniſies <hi rend="italic">discipline</hi> and <hi rend="italic">correction;</hi> he adds, that it was anciently uſed, in general, for all places where ſeveral perſons met together, either to ſtudy, to converſe, or do any other matter. Accordingly, there were <hi rend="italic">ſcholae palatinae,</hi> being the ſeveral polls wherein the emperor’s guards were placed; <hi rend="italic">ſchola ſcutariorum. ſchola gentilium,</hi> &amp;c. At length the term paſſed alſo to civil magiſtrates; and accordingly in the code we meet with <hi rend="italic">ſchola chartulariorum, ſchοla agentium,</hi> &amp;c.; and even to eccleſiaſtics, as <hi rend="italic">ſchola cantorum, ſchola ſacerdotum,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>The Hebrews were always very diligent to teach and ſtudy the laws that they had received from Moſes. The father of the family ſtudied and taught them in his own family. The Rabbin taught them in the temple, in the ſynagogucs, and in the academies. They pretend, that even before the deluge there were ſchools for knowledge and piety, of which the patriarchs had the direction. — They place Adam at their head, then Enoch, and laſtly Noah. Melchiſedec, as they ſay, kept a ſchool in the city of Kajrath-fepher, otherwiſe Hebron, in Paleſtine. Abraham, who had been inſtructed by Heber, taught in Chaldaea and in Egypt. From him the Egyptians learned aſtronomy and arithmetic. Jacob ſucceeded Abraham in the office of teaching. The ſcripture ſays, he was “a plain man dwelling in tents; ” which, according to the Chaldee paraphraſt, is, ‘that he was a perfect man, and a miniſter of the houſe of doctrine. ”</p><p>All this, indeed, muſt be very precarious and uncertain. It cannot be doubted but that Moſes, Aaron, and the elders of Iſrael, inſtructed the people in the wilderneſs, and that many good Iſraelites were very induſtrious to inſtruct their families in the fear of God. But all this does not prove to us that there were any ſuch ſchools as we are now inquiring after. Under Joshua we ſee a kind of academy of the prophets, where the children of the prophets, that is, their diſciples, lived in the exerciſe of a retired and auſtere life, in ſtudy, in the meditation and reading of the law of God. There were ſchools of the prophets at Naioth in Ramah; 1 Sam. xix. 12, 20, &amp;c. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Prophet.</hi></p><p>Theſe ſchools, or ſocieties of the prophets, were ſucceeded by the ſynagogues. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Synagogue.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Charity-Schools</hi> are thoſe ſchools which are ſet apart by public contributions or private donations for the inſtruction of poor children, who could not otherwiſe enjoy the benefits of education.

theſe more numerous than in Great Britain, where charity and benevolence are characteriſtic of the nation at large. The following is a ſummary view of the number of charity-ſchools in Great Britain and Ireland, according to the beſt information at preſent, 1795.</p><table> <row> <cell/> <cell> Schools. </cell> <cell> Boys. </cell> <cell> Girl’s. </cell> </row> <row> <cell> At London </cell> <cell> 182 </cell> <cell> 4,442 </cell> <cell> 2,870 </cell> </row> <row> <cell> In other parts of South Britain </cell> <cell> 1,329 </cell> <cell> 19,506 </cell> <cell> 3,915 </cell> </row> <row> <cell> In North Britain, by the account publiſhed in 1786 </cell> <cell> 135 </cell> <cell> 5, 187 </cell> <cell> 2,618 </cell> </row> <row> <cell> In Ireland, for teaching to read and write only </cell> <cell> 168 </cell> <cell> 2,406 </cell> <cell> 600 </cell> </row> <row> <cell> In ditto, erected-purſuant to his majeſty's charter, and encouraged by his bounty of L. 1000 <hi rend="italic">per annum,</hi> for inſtructing, employing, and wholly maintaining the children, excluſive of the Dublin work-houfe ſchool </cell> <cell> 42 </cell> <cell> 1,935 </cell> <cell/> </row> <row> <cell> Total of ſchools, &amp;c. </cell> <cell> 1,856 </cell> <cell> 33,476 </cell> <cell> 10,003 </cell> </row> </table><p><hi rend="italic">Sunday-SCHOOLS</hi> are another ſpecies of charity-ſchools lately inſtituted, and now pretty common in Great Britain. The inſtitution is evidently of the firſt importance; and if properly encouraged muſt have a very favourable effect on the morals of the people, as it tends not only to preſerve the children of the poor from ſpending Sunday in idleneſs, and of conſequence in diſſipation and vice, but enables them to lay in for the conduct and comfort of their future life a ſtock of uſeful knowledge and virtuous principles, which, if neglected in early life, will ſeldom be ſought for or obtained amidſt the hurry of buſineſe and the cares and temptations of the world.</p><p>The excellent founder of Sunday-ſchools was Mr Raikes, a gentleman of Glouceſterſhire, who, together with Mr Stock, a clergyman in the ſame county, and who, we believe, was equally inſtrumental in the buſineſs with Mr Raikes, ſhewed the example, and convinced many of the utility of the plan. From Glouceſterſhire the inſtitution was quickly adopted in every county and almoſt every town and pariſh of the kingdom; and we have only further to remark on a plan ſo generally known, ſo much approved, and ſo evidently proper, that we hope men of eminence and weight will always be found ſufficiently numerous and willing to beſtow their time and countenance in promoting it to the utmoſt of their power.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
