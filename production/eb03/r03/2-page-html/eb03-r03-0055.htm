<p><span class="font0">This theorem may be thus expreſſed in general terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If a body revolves round an axis paſſing through its centre of gravity with the angular velocity «, while this&nbsp;axis is carried round another axis, alſo paſſing through&nbsp;its centre of gravity, with the angular velocity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font0"> theſe&nbsp;two motions compoſe a motion of every particle of the&nbsp;body round a third axis, lying in the plane of the other&nbsp;two, and inclined to each of the former axes in angles&nbsp;whoſe fines are inverſely as the angular velocities round&nbsp;them ; and the angular velocity round this new axis is&nbsp;to that round one of the primitive axes as the fine of inclination of the two primitive axes is to the line of the&nbsp;inclination of the new axis to the other primitive axis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When we ſay that we owe the enunciation of this theorem to P. Friſi, we grant at the ſame time that&nbsp;ſomething like it has been ſuppoſed or aſſumed by other&nbsp;authors. Newton ſeems to have conſidered it as true,&nbsp;and even evident, in homogeneous ſpheres ; and this has&nbsp;been tacitly acquieſced in by the authors who followed&nbsp;him in the problem of the preceſſion. Inferior writers&nbsp;have careleſsly aſſumed it as a truth. Thus Nollet,&nbsp;Graveſande, and others, in their contrivances for exhibiting experiments for illuſtrating the compoſition of&nbsp;vortices, proceeded on this aſſumption. Even authors&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">more ſcrupulous reſeareh have ſatisſied themſelves&nbsp;with a very imperfect proof. Thus Mr Landen, in his&nbsp;excellent diſſertation on rotatory motion, Philoſophical&nbsp;Tranſactions, Vol. LXVII. contents himſelf with ihow-mg, that, by the equality and oppoſite directions of the&nbsp;motions round the axes A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> and B </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font0"> the point C will&nbsp;be at reſt, and from thence concludes that CG </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> will be&nbsp;the new axis of rotation. But this is exceedingly haſty&nbsp;(note alſo, that this diſſertation was many years poſte-rior to that of P. Friſi) : For although the ſeparate&nbsp;motions of the point C may be equal and oppoſite, it&nbsp;is by no means either a mathematical or a mechanical&nbsp;conſequence that the body will turn round the axis C </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In order that the point C may remain at reſt, it is neceſſary that all tendencies to motion be annihilated : this is not even thought of in making the aſſumption.&nbsp;Friſi has ſhown, that in the motion of every particle·&nbsp;round the axis C c, there is involved a motion round the&nbsp;two axes A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> and B </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font0"> with the velocities </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b ;</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;it is a conſequence of this, and of this only, that the&nbsp;impulſes which would ſeparately produce the rotations&nbsp;of every particle round A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> and B </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> will, either in ſucceſſion or in conjunction, produce a rotation round Cλ&nbsp;Moreover, Mr Landen’s not having attended to this,&nbsp;has led him, as we imagine, into a miſtake refpe ⅜β&nbsp;the velocity with which the axis changes its poſition ;&nbsp;and though his proceſs exhibits the path of evagation&nbsp;with accuracy, we apprehend that it does not aſſign the&nbsp;true times of the axes arriving at particular points of&nbsp;this path.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It follows from this propoſition, that if every particle of a body, whether ſolid or fluid, receives in one inſtant a ſeparate impulſe, competent to the production&nbsp;of a motion of the particle round an axis wfith a certain angular velocity, and another impulſe competent to&nbsp;the production of a motion round another axis with a&nbsp;certain velocity*, the combined effect of all theſe impulſions will be a motion of the whole ſyſtem round a third&nbsp;axis given in poſition, with an angular velocity which is&nbsp;alſo given : and this motion will obtain without any ſe-paration or diſunion of parts ; for we ſee that a motion round two axes conſtitute a motion round a third&nbsp;axis in every particle, and no ſeparation would take&nbsp;place although the ſyſtem were incoherent like a main&nbsp;of fand, except by the action of the centrifugal forces&nbsp;ariſing from rotation. Mr Simpſon therefore erred in&nbsp;his ſolution of the problem of the preceſſion, by ſuppo-ſing another force neceſſary for enabling the particles&nbsp;of the fluid ſpheroid to accompany the equator when&nbsp;diſplaced from its former ſituation. The very force&nbsp;which makes the diſplacement produces the accompaniment, as far as it obtains, which we ſhall ſee preſent-ly is not to the extent that Mr Simpſon and other&nbsp;authors who treat this problem have ſuppoſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the ſame reaſon, if a body be turning round any axis, and every particle in one inſtant get an impulſe&nbsp;preciſely ſuch as is competent to p∣oduce a given angular velocity round another axis, the body will turn,&nbsp;round a third axis given in poſition, with a given angular velocity : for it is indifferent (as it is in the ordinary compoſition of motion) whether the forces act&nbsp;on a particle at once or in lucceſſion. The final motion is the ſame both in reſpect of direction and velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Laſtly, when a rigid body acquires a rotation round an axis by the action of an impulſe on one part of it,&nbsp;and at the ſame time, or afterwards, gets an impulſe on&nbsp;any part which, alone, would have produced a certain&nbsp;rotation round another axis, the effect of the combined&nbsp;actions will be a rotation round a third axis, in terms of&nbsp;this propoſition ; for when a rigid body acquires a motion round an axis, not by the ſimultaneous impulſe of&nbsp;the preciſely competent force on each particle, but by&nbsp;an impulſe on one part, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">there has been propagated tβ every&nbsp;particle</span><span class="font0"> (by means of the connecting forces) an impulſe&nbsp;preciſely competent to produce the motion which the&nbsp;particle really acquires ; and when a rigid body, al-</span></p>
