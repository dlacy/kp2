<p><span class="font2">The apparatus being now expofed to the ſtream, with the perforated plate looking down the ſtream,</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">Here was a great diminution of the non-preſſions produced by the diſtance between the prow and the&nbsp;poop.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">3d, Poop of the long box &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3’<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Theſe are moſt valuable experiments. They plainly ſhow how important it is to confider the action on the&nbsp;hinder part of the body. For the whole impulſe or&nbsp;refiſtance, which muſt be withſtood or overcome by the&nbsp;external force, is the ſum of the active preffure on the&nbsp;fore-part, and of the non-preffure on the hinder-part ;&nbsp;and they ſſiow that this does not depend ſolely on the&nbsp;form of the prow and poop, but alſo, and perhaps chiefly, on the length of the body. We ſee that the non-preffure on the hinder-part was prodigiouſly diminiſhed&nbsp;(reduced to one-fourth) by making the length of the&nbsp;body triple of the breadth. And hence it appears, that&nbsp;merely lengthening a ſhip, without making any change&nbsp;in the form either of her prow or her poop, will greatly&nbsp;diminiſh the refiſtance to her motion through the water ; and this increaſe of length may be made by continuing the form of the midſhip frame in ſeveral timbers&nbsp;along the keel, by which the capacity of the ſhip, and&nbsp;her power of carrying fail, will be greatly increaſed,&nbsp;and her other qualities improved, while her ſpeed is&nbsp;augmented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is ſurely of importance to confider a little the phyfical cauſe of this change. The motions are extremely complicated, and we muſt be contented if we&nbsp;can but perceive a few leading circumſtances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The water is turned aſide by the anterior part of the body, and the velocity of the filaments is increafed, and&nbsp;they acquire a divergent motion, by which they alſo&nbsp;puſh afide the ſurrounding water. Οη each fide of the&nbsp;body, therefore, they are moving in a divergent direc-tion, and with an increaſed velocity. But as they are&nbsp;on all tides preſſed by the fluid without them, their&nbsp;motions gradually approach to parallelism, and their velocities to an equality with the ſtream. The progreſ-five velocity, or that in the direction of the ſtream, is&nbsp;checked, at leaſt at firſt. But fince we obſerve the fi-laments conſtipated round the body, and that they are&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">got deflected at right angles to their former direction,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">it is plain that the real velocity of a filament in its ob-lique path is augmented. We always obferve, that a ſtone lying in the ſand, and expofed to the waih of the&nbsp;lea, is laid bare at the bottom, and the ſand is generally&nbsp;waſhed away to ſome diſtance all round. This is owing to the increaſed velocity of the water which comes&nbsp;into contact with the ſtone. It takes up more ſand&nbsp;than it can keep floating, and it depofits it at a little&nbsp;diſtance all around, forming a little bank, which fur-rounds the ſtone at a ſmall diſtance. when the filaments of water have paffed the body, they are preſſid&nbsp;by the ambient fluid into the place which it has quitted, and they glide round its ſtern, and fill up the ſpace&nbsp;behind. '1 he more divergent and the more rapid they&nbsp;are, when about to fall in behind, the more of the circumambient preffure muſt be employed to turn them in-to the trough behind the body, and leſs of it will remain to preſs them to the body itſelf. The extreme&nbsp;of this muſt obtain when the liream is obſtructed by a&nbsp;thin plane only. But when there is fome diſtance between the prow and the poop, the divergency of the fi-laments which had been turned afide by the prow, ia&nbsp;diminiſhed by the time that they have come abreaſt of&nbsp;the ſtern, and ſhould turn in behind it. They are&nbsp;therefore more readily made to converge behind the&nbsp;body, and a more confiderable part of the ſurrounding&nbsp;preſſure remains unexpended, and therefore preſſes the&nbsp;water againſt the fiern ; and it is evident that this advantage muſt be ſo much the greater as the body is&nbsp;longer. But the advantage will ſoon be ſuſceptible of&nbsp;no very confiderable increaſe : for the lateral and divergent, and accelerated filaments, will ſoon become ſo&nbsp;nearly parallel and equally rapid with the reſt of thc&nbsp;ſtream, that a great increafe of length will not make&nbsp;any confiderable change in thefe particulars ; and it&nbsp;muſt be accompanied with an increaſe of friction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Theſe are very obvious reflections. And if we attend minutςly to the way in which thc almoſt ſtagnant ſtuid&nbsp;behind the body is expended and renewed, we ſhall ſee&nbsp;all theſe effects confirmed and augmented. But as&nbsp;we cannot ſay any thing on this ſubject that is preciſe, or that can be made the ſubject of computation,&nbsp;it is needleſs to enter into a more minute diſcuſſion.&nbsp;The diminution of the non-preſſure towards the centra&nbsp;moſt probably arifes from the ſmaller force which is ne-ceſſary to be expended in the inflection of the lateral fi .&nbsp;laments, already inflected in ſome degree, and having&nbsp;their velocity diminiſhed. But it 13 a ſubject highly defer vi ng the attention of the mathematicians ; and we&nbsp;preſume to invite them to the ſtudy of the motions of&nbsp;thefe lateral filaments, paſſing the body, and preſſed&nbsp;into its wake by forces which are ſufceptible of no difficult inveſtigation. It ſeems highly probable, that if&nbsp;a prifmatic box, with a fquare ſtern, were fitted with an&nbsp;addition precifely ſhaped like the water which would&nbsp;(abſtracting tenacity and friction) have been ſtagnant&nbsp;behind it, the quantity of non-preſſion would be thc&nbsp;fmalleſt poſſible. The mathematician would ſurely diſ-cover circumſtances which would furniſh ſome maxims&nbsp;of conſtruction for the hinder part as well as for the&nbsp;prow. And as h,is ſpeculations on tins laſt have not been&nbsp;wholly fruitleſs, we may expect advantages from his attention to this part, ſo much neglected.</span></p>
