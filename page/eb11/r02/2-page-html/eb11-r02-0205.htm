<p><span class="font3">number of sheep in the province is comparatively small, and is, indeed, not greatly in excess of that of the goats. The&nbsp;wooded hills are well stocked with deer, and a stray wolf&nbsp;occasionally finds its way from the forests of the Ardennes into&nbsp;those of the Hunsrück. The salmon fishery of the Rhine is&nbsp;very productive, and trout abound in the mountain streams.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The great mineral wealth of the Rhine province probably furnishes its most substantial claim to the title of the “ richest&nbsp;jewel in the crown of Prussia.” Besides parts of the carboniferous measures of the Saar and the Ruhr, it also contains&nbsp;important deposits of coal near Aix-la-Chapelle. Iron ore is&nbsp;found in abundance near Coblenz, the BIeiberg in the Eifcl&nbsp;possesses an apparently inexhaustible supply of lead, and zinc&nbsp;is found near Cologne and Aix-la-Chapelle. The mineral products of the district also include lignite, copper, manganese,&nbsp;vitriol, lime, gypsum, volcanic stones (used for millstones)&nbsp;and slates. By far the most important itcm is coal. Of the&nbsp;numerous mineral springs the best known are those of Aix-la-Chapelle and Kreuznach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The mineral resources of the Prussian Rhine province, coupled with its favourable situation and the facüities of transit&nbsp;afforded by its great waterway, have made it the most important&nbsp;manufacturing district in Germany. The industry is mainly&nbsp;concentrated round two chief centres, Aix-la-Chapelle and&nbsp;Düsseldorf (with the valley of the Wupper), while there are&nbsp;naturally few manufactures in the hilly districts of the south&nbsp;or the marshy flats of the north. The largest iron and steel&nbsp;works are at Essen, Oberhausen, Duisburg, Düsseldorf and&nbsp;Cologne, while cutlery and other small metallic wares are&nbsp;extensively madè at Solingen, Remscheid and Aix-la-Chapelle.&nbsp;The cloth of Aix-la-Chapelle and the silk of Crefeld form&nbsp;important articles of export. The chief industries of Elberfeld-Barmen and the valley of the Wupper are cotton-weaving,&nbsp;calico-printing and the manufacture of turkey red and other&nbsp;dyes. Linen is largely made at Gladbach, leather at Malmedy,&nbsp;glass in the Saar district and beetroot sugar near Cologne.&nbsp;Though the Rhineland is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">par excellence</span><span class="font3"> the country of the vine,&nbsp;beer is largely produced; distilleries are also numerous, and&nbsp;large quantities of sparkling Moselle are made at Coblenz,&nbsp;chiefly for exportation to England. Commerce is greatly&nbsp;aided by the navigable rivers, a very extensive network of railways, and the excellent roads constructed during the French&nbsp;regime. The imports consist mainly of raw material for working&nbsp;up in the factories of the district, while the principal exports&nbsp;are coal, fruit, wine, dyes, cloth, silk and other manufactured&nbsp;articles of various descriptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The population of the Rhine province in 1905 was 6,435,778, including 4,472,058 Roman Catholics, 1,877,582 Protestants&nbsp;and 55,408 Jews. The Roman Catholics muster strongest on&nbsp;the left bank, while on the right bank about half the population&nbsp;is Protestant. The great bulk of the population is of Teutonic&nbsp;stock, and about a quarter of a million are of Flemish blood.&nbsp;On the north-west frontier reside about 10,000 Walloons, who&nbsp;speak French or Walloon as their native tongue. The Rhine&nbsp;province is the most thickly populated part of Prussia, the&nbsp;general average being 617 persons per sq. m. The province&nbsp;contains a greater number of large towns than any other&nbsp;province in Prussia. Upwards of half the population are supported by industrial and commercial pursuits, and bareIy a&nbsp;quarter by agriculture. There is a university at Bonn, and&nbsp;elementary education is especially successful. For purposes&nbsp;of administration the province is divided into the five districts&nbsp;of Coblenz, Düsseldorf, Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle and Trier.&nbsp;CobIenz is the official capital, though Cologne is the largest and&nbsp;most important town. Being a frontier province the Rhineland is strongly garrisoned, and the Rhine is guarded by the&nbsp;three strong fortresses of Cologne with Deutz, CobIenz with&nbsp;Ehrenbreitstein, and Wesel. The province sends 35 members&nbsp;to the German Reichstag and 62 to the Prussian house of&nbsp;representatives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font2">The present Prussian Rhine province was formed in 1815 out of the duchies of Cleves, Berg, Gelderland and Jülich,&nbsp;the ecclesiastical principalities of Trier and Cologne, the free cities&nbsp;of Aix-la-Chapelle and Cologne, and nearly a hundred small lord-ships and abbeys. At the earliest historical period we find the&nbsp;territories between the Ardennes and the Rhine occupied by the&nbsp;Treviri, the Eburones and other Celtic tribes, who, however, were&nbsp;all more or less modified and influenced by their Teutonic neighbours. On the right bank of the Rhine, between the Main and&nbsp;the Lahn, were the settlements of the Mattiaci, a branch of the&nbsp;Germanic Chatti, while farther to the north were the Usipetes&nbsp;and Tenctcri- Julius Caesar conquered the tribes on the left bank,&nbsp;and Augustus established numerous fortified posts on the Rhine,&nbsp;but the Romans never succeeded in gaining a firm footing on the&nbsp;right bank. As the power of the Roman empire declined the Franks&nbsp;pushed forward along both banks of the Rhine, and by the end of&nbsp;the 5th Centuiy had regained all the lands that had formerly been&nbsp;under Teutonic influence. The German conaucrors of the Rhenish&nbsp;districts were singularly little affected by tne culture of the provincials they subdued, and all traces of Roman civilization were&nbsp;submerged in a new flood of paganism. By the 8th century the&nbsp;Frankisn dominion was firmly established in central Germany and&nbsp;northern Gaul. On the division of the Carolingian realm the part&nbsp;of the province to the east of the river fell to the share of Germany, while that to the west remained with the evanescent kingdom&nbsp;of Lotharingia. By the time of Otto 1. (d. 973) both banks of the&nbsp;Rhine had become German, and the Rhenisn territory was divided&nbsp;between the duchies of Upper and Lower Lxjrraine, the one on the&nbsp;Mosel and the other on the Meuse. Subsequently, as the central&nbsp;power of the German sovereign became weakened, the Rhineland&nbsp;followed the general tendency and split up into numerous small&nbsp;independent principalities, each with its separate vicissitudes and&nbsp;special chronicles. The old Lotharingian divisions passed wholly&nbsp;out of use, and the name of Lorraine, became restricted to the&nbsp;district that still bears it. In spite of its dismembered condition,&nbsp;and the sufferings it underwent at the hands of its French neighbours in various periods of warfare, the Rhenish territory prospered&nbsp;greatly and stood in the foremost rank of German culture and&nbsp;progress. Aix-la-Chapelle was fixed upon as the place of coronation of the German emperors, and the ecclesiastical principalities&nbsp;of the Rhine bulk largely in German history. Prussia first set fool&nbsp;on the Rhine in 1609 by the joint occupation of Cleves; and about&nbsp;a century later Upper Gelderland and Mors also became Prussian.&nbsp;At the peace of Basel in 1795 the whole of the left bank of the Rhine&nbsp;was resigned to France, and in 1806 the Rhenish princes all joined&nbsp;the Confederation of the Rhine. The congress of Vienna assigned&nbsp;the whole of the lower Rhenish districts to Prussia, which had the&nbsp;tact to leave them in undisturbed possession of the liberal institutions they had become accustomed to under the republican rule of&nbsp;the French.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RHINOCEROS, the designation for such perissodactyle (odd-toed) ungulate mammals as carry one or more horns on&nbsp;the head, and their extinct relatives (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Perissodactyla).&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Rhinoceroses are of large size and massive build, but have little&nbsp;intelligence, and are generally timid in disposition, though&nbsp;ferocious when wounded or brought to bay. The African&nbsp;species use the nasal horns as weapons, with which they strike&nbsp;and toss their assailant, but the Asiatic rhinoceroses employ&nbsp;their sharp lower tusks much as does a boar. Rhinoceroses are&nbsp;dull of sight, but their hearing and scent are remarkably acute.&nbsp;They feed on herbage, shrubs and leaves of trees, and, like so&nbsp;many other large animals which inhabit hot countries, sleep&nbsp;the greater part of the day, and are most active in the cool of&nbsp;the evening or even during the night. Some are found in more&nbsp;or less open plains, while others inhabit swampy districts.&nbsp;Members of the group have existed in both east and west&nbsp;hemispheres since the beginning of the Miocene period; but in&nbsp;America they all became extinct before the end of the Pliocene&nbsp;period, and in the Old World their distribution has become&nbsp;greatly restricted. They are, for instance, no longer found in&nbsp;Europe and North Asia, but only in Africa and in portions of the&nbsp;Indian and Indo-Malayan regions. Living rhinoceroses may&nbsp;be arranged in three groups: (1) With a single nasal horn, and&nbsp;very thick skin, which is raised into strong, definitely arranged&nbsp;ridges or folds. In this group there are two well-marked species.&nbsp;The Indian rhinoceros </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Rhinoceros unicornis),</span><span class="font3"> the largest of the&nbsp;Asiatic forms, is the most widely known, from its being exhibited&nbsp;in zoological gardens. A famous rhinoceros presented to the&nbsp;Zoological Society of London in July 1864 lived till December&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1904. </span><span class="font3">This species stands from 5 ft. to 5 ft. </span><span class="font2">9 </span><span class="font3">in. at the&nbsp;shoulder and is blackish grey in colour; the hom rarely&nbsp;exceeds a foot in length, but one in the British Museum&nbsp;measures </span><span class="font2">19 </span><span class="font3">in. This species is now only met with in a wild</span></p>
