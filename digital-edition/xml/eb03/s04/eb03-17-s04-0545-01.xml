(Sir Thomas), was born at Walden in Eſſex in 1512. At 14 he was ſent to Queen’s college Cambridge, where he diſtinguiſhed himſelf ſo much, that he was made Henry VIII.’s ſcholar together with John Cheke. He was choſen a fellow of his college in 1531, and appointed two years after to read the public Greek lecture. The common mode of reading Greek at that time was very faulty ; the ſame found being given to the letters and diphthongs ι, η, υ, ει, οι, υι. Mr Smith and Mr Cheke had been for ſome time ſenſible that this pronunciation was wrong : and after a good deal of conſultation and reſearch, they agreed to introduce that mode of reading which prevails at preſent. Mr Smith was lecturing on Arist <hi rend="italic">otle de Republica</hi> in Greek. At firſt he dropped a word or two at intervals in the new pronunciation, and ſometimes he would stop as if he had committed a miſtake and correct himſelf. No notice was taken of this ſor two or three days ; but as he repeated more frequently, his audience began to wonder at the unuſual founds, and at laſt ſome oſ his friends mentioned to him what they had remarked. He owned that ſomething was in agitation, but that it was not yet ſufficiently digeſted to be made public. They entreated him earneſtly to diſcover his protect : he did ſo ; and in a ſhort time great numbers reſorted to him for information. The new pronunciation was adopted with enthuſiaſm, and ſoon became universal at Cambridge. It was afterwards oppoſed by biſhop Gardiner the chancellor ; but its superiority to the old mode was ſo viſible, that in a few years it spread over all England.</p><p>In 1539 he travelled into foreign countries, and ſtudied ſor ſome time in the univerſities of France and Italy. On his return he was made regius profeſſor of civil law at Cambridge. About this time he publiſhed a</p><p>treatiſe on the mode of pronouncing Engliſh. He was uſeful likewiſe in promoting the reformation. Having gone into the family of the duke of Somerſet, the protector during the minority of Edward VI. he was employed by that nobleman in public affairs ; and in 1548 was made ſecretary of ſtate, and received the honour of knighthood. While that nobleman continued in office, he was ſent ambaſſador, firſt to Brussels and afterwards to France.</p><p>Upon Mary’s acceſſion he loſt all his places, but was fortunate enough to preſerve the friendſhip of Gardiner and Bonner. He was exempted from perſecution, and was allowed, probably by their influence, a penſion of L. 100. During Elizabeth’s reign he was employed in public affairs, and was ſent three times by that princeſs as her ambaſſador to France. He died in 1577. His abilities were excellent, and his attainments uncommonly great : He was a ρhilosopher, a phyſician, a chemiſt, mathematician, linguiſt, hiſtorian, and architect. He wrote, 1. A treatiſe called the <hi rend="italic">Engliſh Commonwealth.</hi> 2. A letter <hi rend="italic">De Recta et Emendata Linguæ Graecae Pronunciatiοne.</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">De Moribus Turcarum.</hi> 4. <hi rend="italic">De Druidum Moribus.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Smith</hi> (Edmund), a diſtinguiſhed Engliſh poet, the only ſon of Mr Neale an eminent merchant, by a daughter of baron Lechmere, was born in 1668. By his father’s death he was left young to the care of Mr Smith, who had married his father’s sister, and who treated him with ſo much tenderneſs, that at the death of his generous guardian he aſſumed his name. His writings are not many, and thoſe are ſcattered about in miſcellanies and collections : his celebrated tragedy of Phædra and Hippolitus was acted in 1707 ; and being introduced at a time when the Italian opera ſo much engroſſed the polite world, gave Mr Addiſon, who wrote the prologue, an opportunity to rally the vitiated taſte of the public. However, notwithſtanding the eſteem it has always been hdd in, it is perhaps rather to be conſidered as a fine poem than as a good play. This tragedy, with a Poem to the memory of Mr John Philips, three or four Odes, with a Latin oration ſpoken at Oxford <hi rend="italic">in laudem Thomae Bodleii,</hi> were publiſhed as his works by his friend Mr Oldiſworth. Mr Smith died in 1710, sunk into indolence and intemperance by poverty and diſappointments ; the hard fate of many a man of genius.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Smith</hi> (John), an excellent mezzotinter, flouriſhed about 1700; but neither the time of his birth nor death are accurately known. He united ſoftneſs with ſtrength, and finiſhed with freedom. He ſerved his time with one Tillet a painter in Moorſields; and as ſoon as he became his own maſter, learned from Becket the ſecret of mezzotinto, and being farther inſtructed by Van der Vaart, was taken to work in Sir Godfrey Kneller’s houſe ; and as he was to be the publisher of that maſter’s works, doubtleſs received conſiderable hints from him, which he amply repaid. “ To poſterity perhaps his prints (ſays Mr Walpole) will carry an idea of ſomething burleſque ; perukes of an enormous length flowing over suits of armour, compoſe wonderful habits. It is equally ſtrange that faſhion could introduce the one, and eſtabliſh the practice of repreſenting the other, when it was out of faſhion. Smith excelled in exhibiting both, as he found them in the portraits of Knel-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0552.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0546"/>
ler, who was less happy in what he ſubſtituted to armour. In the Kit-cat club he has poured full bottoms chiefly over night-gowns. If thoſe ſtreams of hair were <hi rend="italic">incommode</hi> in a battle, I know nothing (he adds) they were adapted to that can be done in a night-gown. Smith compoſed two large volumes, with proofs of his own plates, for which he asked L. 50. His fineſt works are duke Schomberg on horſeback ; that duke’s ſon and ſuccessor Maynhard ; the earls of Pembroke, Dorſet, and Albemarle ; three plates with two figures in each, of young perſons or children, in which he ſhone ; William Cowper ; Gibbons and his wife; Queen Anne; the duke of Glouceſter, a whole length, with a flowerpot ;a very curious one of Queen Mary, in a high head, fan, and gloves ; the earl of Godolphin ; the ducheſs of Ormond, a whole length, with a black ; Sir George Rooke, &amp; c There is a print by him of James II. with an anchor, but no inſcription ; which not being finiſhed when the king went away, is ſo ſcarce that it is ſometimes ſold for above a guinea. Smith alſo performed many hiſtoric pieces ; as the loves of the gods, from Titian, at Blenheim, in ten plates; Venus ſtanding in a ſhell, from a picture by Correggio, and many more, of which perhaps the moſt delicate is the holy family with angels, after Carlo Maratti.”</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Smith</hi> (Dr Adam), the celebrated author of the Inquiry into the Nature and Cauſes of the Wealth of Nations, was the only ſon of Adam Smith controller oſ the cuſtoms at Kirkaldy, and of Margaret Douglas daughter of Mr Douglas of Strathenry. He was born at Kirkaldy on the 5th June 1723, a few months after the death of his father. His conſtitution during his infancy was infirm and ſickly, and required all the care oſ his ſurviving parent. When only three years old he was carried by his mother to Strathenry on a viſit to his uncle Mr Douglas ; and happening one day to be amuſing himſelf alone at the door of the houſe, he was ſtolen by a party of thoſe vagrants who in Scotland are called <hi rend="italic">tinkers.</hi> Luckily he was miſſed immediately, and the vagrants purſued and overtaken in Leſlie wood ; and thus Dr Smith was preſerved to extend the bounds of ſcience, and reform the commercial policy of Europe.</p><p>He received the rudiments of his education in the ſchool of Kirkaldy under David Miller, a teacher of conſiderable eminence, and whoſe name deserves to be recorded on account of the great number of eminent men which that ſeminary produced while under his direction. Dr Smith, even while at ſchool, attracted notice by his paſſionate attachment to books, and by the extraordinary powers of his memory ; while his friendly and generous diſpoſition gained and ſecured the affection of his ſchool fellows. Even then he was remarkable for thoſe habits which remained with him through life, of ſpeaking to himſelf when alone and of abſence in company. He was ſent in 1737 to the univerſity of Glaſgow, where he remained till 1740, when he went to Baliol college Oxford, as an exhibitioner on Snell’s foundation. His favourite purſuits while at the univerſity were mathematics and natural philoſophy. After his removal to England he frequently employed himſelf in tranſlating, particularly from the French, with a view to the improvement of his own ſtyle : a practice which he often recommended to all who wiſhed to cul</p><p>tivate the art of compoſition. It was probably then alſo that he applied himſelf with the greateſt care to the ſtudy of languages, of which, both ancient and modern, his knowledge was uncommonly extenſive and accurate.</p><p>After ſeven years reſidence at Oxford he returned to Kirkaldy, and lived two years with his mother without any fixed plan for his future life. He had been deſigned for the church of England ; but disliking the eccleſiaſtical profeſſion, he reſolved to abandon it altogether, and to limit his ambition to the proſpect of obtaining ſome of thoſe preferments to which literary attainments lead in Scotland. In 1748 he fixed his reſidence in Edinburgh, and for three years read a courſe of lectures on rhetoric and belles lettres under the patronage of Lord Karnes. In 1751 he was elected profeſſor of logic in the univerſity of Glaſgow, and the year following was removed to the professorship of moral philosophy, vacant by the death of Mr Thomas Craigie the immediate ſucceſſor of Dr Hutcheſon. In this ſituation he remained 13 years, a period he uſed frequently to look back to as the moſt uſeful part of his life. His lectures on moral philoſophy were divided into four parts: The firſt contained natural theology ; in which he conſidered the proofs of the being and attributes of God, and thoſe truths on which religion is founded : the ſecond comprehended ethics, ſtrictly ſo called, and conſiſted chiefly of thoſe doctrines which he afterwards publiſhed in his theory of moral ſentirnertts : in the third part he treated more at length of that part of morality called <hi rend="italic">justice ;</hi> and which, being ſuſceptible of preciſe and accurate rules, is for that reaſon capable of a full and accurate explanation : in the laſt part of his lectures he examined thoſe political regulations which are founded, not upon the principle of juſtice, but of expediency ; and which are calculated to increaſe the riches, the power, and the prosperity of a ſtate. Under this view he conſidered the political inſtitutions relating to commerce, to finances, to eccleſiaſtical and military governments : this contained the subſtance of his W <hi rend="italic">ealth of Nations.</hi> In delivering his lectures he truſted almoſt entirely to extemporary elocution : his manner was plain and unaffected, and he never failed to intereſt his hearers. His reputation ſoon roſe very high, and many ſtudents reſorted to the univerſity merely upon his account.</p><p>When his acquaintance with Mr Hume firſt commenced is uncertain, but it had ripened into friendſhip before the year 1752.</p><p>In 1759 he publiſhed his Theory of Moral Sentiments ; a work which deſervedly extended his reputation : for, though ſeveral of its conclusions be ill- founded, it muſt be allowed by all to be a lingular effort of invention, ingenuity, and ſubtilty. Beſides, it contains a great mixture of important truth ; and, tho' the author hits ſometimes been misled, he has had the merit of directing the attention of philoſophers to a view of human nature, which had formerly in a great meaſure eſcaped their notice. It abounds everywhere with the pureſt and moſt elevated maxims concerning the practical conduct of life; and when the ſubject of his work leads him to addreſs the imagination and the heart, the variety and felicity of his illuſtrations, the richneſs and fluency of his eloquence, and the skill with<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0553.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0547"/>
which he wins the attention and commands the paſſions of his readers, leave him among our Britiſh moraliſis without a rival.</p><p>Towards the end of 1763 Dr Smith received an invitation from Mr Charles Townſend to accompany the Duke of Buccleugh on his travels ; and the liberal terms in which this propoſal was made induced him to reſign his office at Glaſgow. He joined the Duke of Buccleugh at London early in the year 1704, and ſet out with him for the continent in the month of March following. After a stay of about ten days at Paris, they proceeded to Thoulouſe, where they fixed their residence for about 18 months; thence they went by a pretty extenſive route through the ſouth of France to Geneva, where they paſſed two months. About Christmas 1765 they returned to Paris, and remained there till October following. The ſociety in which Dr Smith paſſed theſe ten months may be conceived in conſequence of the recommendation of Mr Hume. Turgot, Queſnai, Necker, D’Alembert, Helvetius, Marmontel, Madame Riccoboni, were among the number of his acquaintances ; and ſome of them he continued ever after to reckon among the number of his friends. In October 1766 the duke of Buccleugh returned to England.</p><p>Dr Smith ſpent the next ten years of his life with his mother at Kirkaldy, occupied habitually in intenſe study, but unbending his mind at times in the company of ſome of his old ſchoolfellows, who still continued to reſide near the place of their birth. In 1776 he publiſhed his <hi rend="italic">Inquiry into the Nature and Cauſes of the Wealth of Nations ;</hi> a book ſo univerſally known, that any panegyric on it would be uſeleſs. The variety, importance, and (may we not add) novelty, of the information which it contains ; the skill and comprehenſiveneſs of mind displayed in the arrangement ; the admirable illuſtrations with which it abounds ; together with a plainneſs and perſpicuity which makes it intelligible to all—render it unquestionably the moſt perfect work which has yet appeared on the general principles of any branch of legiſiation.</p><p>He ſpent the next two years of his life in London, where he enjoyed the ſociety of ſome of the most eminent men of the age : but he removed to Edinburgh in 1778, in conſequence oſ having been appointed, at the request of the duke of Buccleugh, one of the commiſſioners of the customs in Scotland. Here he ſpent the last twelve years of his life in an affluence which was more than equal to all his wants. But his studies ſeemed entirely ſuſpended till the infirmities of old age reminded him, when it was too late, of what he yet owed to the public and to his own fame. The principal materials of the works which he had announced had long ago been collected, and little probably was wanting but a few years of health and retirement to complete them. The death of his mother, who had accompanied him to Edinburgh in 1784, together with that of his couſin Miſs Douglas in 1788, contributed to fruſtrate theſe projects. They had been the objects of his affection for more than 60 years, and in their Society he had enjoyed from his infancy all that he ever knew of the endearments of a family. He was now alone and helpleſs ; and though he bore his loſs with equanimity, and regained apparently his former cheerfulneſs, yet his health and ſtrength gradually declined till the period of</p><p>his death, which happened in July 1790. Some days before his death he ordered all his papers to be burnt except a few eſſays, which have ſince been publiſhed.</p><p>Of the originality and comprehenſiveneſs oſ his views; the extent, the variety, and the correctneſs of his information ; the inexhaustible fertility of his invention—he has left behind him laſting monuments. To his private worth, the most certain of all teſtimonies may be found in that confidence, reſpect, and attachment, which followed him through all the various relations oſ life. He was habitually abſent in converſation, and was apt when he ſpoke to deliver his ideas in the form of a lecture. He was rarely known to start a new topic himſelf, or to appear unprepared upon thoſe topics that were introduced by others. In his external form and appearance there was nothing uncommon. When perfectly at eaſe, and when warmed with converſation, his gestures were animated and not ungraceful ; and in the ſociety oſ thoſe he loved, his features were often brightened by a ſmile of inexpreſſible benignity. In the company of strangers, his tendency to abſence, and perhaps still more his conſciouſneſs of that tendency, rendered his manners ſomewhat embarraſſed ; an effect which was probably not a little heightened by thoſe ſpeculative ideas of propriety which his recluſe habits tended at once to perfect in his conception, and to diminiſh his power of realizing.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
