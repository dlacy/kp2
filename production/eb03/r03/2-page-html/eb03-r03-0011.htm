<body><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">perſon will perceive by attending to its conſtruction {See </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Price,</span><span class="font1"> Plate OP).</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 28. repreſents a dome executed irι the Regiſter Office in Edinburgh by James and Robert Adams,&nbsp;and is very agreeable to mechanical principles. The&nbsp;ſpan is 50 feet clear, and the thickneſs is only 4⅛.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">We cannot take leave of the ſubject without taking ſome notice of wlιat we have already ſpoken of with&nbsp;commendation by the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Norman roofs.</span><span class="font0"> We&nbsp;called them </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Norman,</span><span class="font0"> becauſe they were frequently executed by that people ſoon after their eſtabliſhment in&nbsp;Italy and other parts of the ſouth of Europe, and became the prevailing taſte in all the great baronial caſ-tles. Their architects were rivals to the Saracens and&nbsp;Moors, who about that time built many Chriſtiari&nbsp;churches ; and the architecture which we now call Gothic ſeems to have ariſen from their joint labours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principle of a Norman roof is extremely ſimple. The rafters all butted on joggled king-poſts AF, BG,&nbsp;CH, &amp;c. (fig. 29.), and braces or ties were then diſpoſed in the intervals. In the middle of the roof HB&nbsp;and HD are evidently ties in a ſtate of extenſion,&nbsp;while the poſt CH is compreſſed by them. Towards&nbsp;the walls on each ſide, as between B and F, and between F and L, they are braces, and are compreſſed.&nbsp;The ends of the poſts were generally ornamented with&nbsp;knots of flowers, emboſſed globes, and the like, and&nbsp;the whole texture of the truſs was exhibited and dreſſed&nbsp;out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This conſtruction admits of employing very ſhort timbers; and this very circumſtance gives greater ſtrength&nbsp;to the truſs, becauſe the angle which the brace or tie&nbsp;makes with the rafter is more open. We may alſo perceive that all thruſt may be taken off the walls. If&nbsp;the pieces AF, BF, LF, be removed, all the remaining&nbsp;diagonal pieces act as ties, and the pieces directed to&nbsp;the centre act as ſtruts ; and it may alſo be obſerved,&nbsp;that the principle will apply equally to a ſtraight or&nbsp;flat roof or to a floor. A floor ſuch as </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a be,</span><span class="font0"> having&nbsp;the joint in two pieces </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a b, be,</span><span class="font0"> with a ſtrut </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">bd,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;two ties, will require a much greater weight to break&nbsp;it than if it had a continued joiſt </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a c</span><span class="font0"> of the ſame ſcantling. And, laſtly, a piece of timber acting as a tie is&nbsp;much ſtronger than the ſame piece acting as a ſtrut :&nbsp;for in the latter ſituation it is expoſed to bending, and&nbsp;when bent it is much leſs able to withſtand a very great&nbsp;ſtrain. It muſt be acknowledged, however, that this&nbsp;advantage is balanced by the great inferiority of the&nbsp;joints in point of ſtrength. The joint of a tie depends&nbsp;wholly on the pins ; for this reaſon ties are never uſed&nbsp;in heavy works without ſtrapping the joints with iron.&nbsp;In the roofs we are now deſcribing the diagonal pieces&nbsp;of the middle part only act purely as ties, while thoſe&nbsp;towards the ſides act as ſtruts or braces. Indeed they&nbsp;are ſeldom of ſo very ſimple conſtruction as we have&nbsp;deſcribed, and are more generally conſtructed like the&nbsp;ſketch in ſig. 30. having two ſets of rafters AB, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a b,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the angles are filled up with thin planks, which give&nbsp;great ſtiffneſs and ſtrength. They have alſo a doublé&nbsp;ſet of purlins, which connect the different truffes. The&nbsp;roof being thus divided into ſquares, other purlins run&nbsp;between the middle points E of the rafters. The rafter is ſupported at E by a check put between it and&nbsp;the under rafter. The middle point of each ſquare of&nbsp;the roof is ſupported and ſtiffened by four </span><span class="font1">braces, one&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of which ſprings from </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font0"> and its oppoſite from the ſi-milar part of the adjoining truſs. The other two braces ſpring from the middle points of the lower purlins,&nbsp;wſhich go horizontally from </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> to the next truſs,&nbsp;and are ſupported by planks in the ſame manner as the&nbsp;rafters. By this contrivance the whole becomes very&nbsp;ſtiff and ſtrong.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We hope that the reader will not be diſpleaſed with &lt; our having taken ſome notice of what was the pride of&nbsp;our anceſtors, and conſtitnted a great part of the finery&nbsp;of the grand hall, where the feudal lord aſſembled his&nbsp;vaffals and diſplayed his magnificence. The intelligent&nbsp;mechanic will ſee much to commend ; and all who look&nbsp;at theſe roofs admire their apparent flimſy lightneſs,&nbsp;and wonder at their duration. We have ſeen a hall of&nbsp;57 feet wide, the roof of which Was in four diviſions,&nbsp;like a kirb roof, and the truffes were about 1</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">6</span><span class="font0"> feet aſun-der. They were ſingle rafters, as in fig. 30. and their&nbsp;dimenſions were only eight inches by fix. The roof&nbsp;appeared perfectly found, and had been ſtanding ever&nbsp;ſince the year 1425.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Much of what has been ſaid on this ſubject may be applied to the conſtruction of wooden bridges and the&nbsp;centres for turning the arches of ſtone-bridges. But&nbsp;the farther diſcuſſion of this muſt be the employment of&nbsp;another article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROOFING, the materials of which the roof of a houſe is compoſed. See the foregoing article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROOK, in ornithology. See Corvus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rooks are very deſtructive of corn, eſpecially of wheat. Theyſearch out the lands where it is fown, and&nbsp;watching them more carefully than the owners, they&nbsp;perceive when the ſeed firſt begins to ſhoot up its&nbsp;blade ; this is the time’of their feeding on it. They will&nbsp;not be at the pains of ſearching for it at random in the&nbsp;ſown land, for that is more trouble than fo ſmall </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">grain will requite them for : but as ſoon as theſe blade»&nbsp;appear, they are by them directed, without loſs of time&nbsp;or pains, to the places where the grains lie ; and in&nbsp;three or four days time they will root up ſuch' vaſt&nbsp;quantities, that a good crop is oſten thus deſtroyed in&nbsp;embryo. After a few days the wheat continuing to&nbsp;grow, its blades appear green above ground ; and then&nbsp;the time of danger from theſe birds is over ; for then&nbsp;the ſeeds are fo far robbed of their mealy matter, that&nbsp;they are of no value to that bird, and it will no longer&nbsp;give itſelf the trouble to deſtroy them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wheat that is ſown ſo early as to ſhoot up its green blades before the harveſt is all carried in, is in no danger from theſe birds ; becauſe while it is in a ſtate&nbsp;worth their ſearching for, the ſcattered corn in the harveſt fields is eaſier come at, and they feed wholly on&nbsp;this, neglecting the ſown grain. But as this cannot always be done, the farmers, to drive away theſe ravenous&nbsp;and miſchievous birds, dig holes in the ground and ſtick&nbsp;up the feathers of rooks in them, and hang up dead&nbsp;rooks on ſticks in ſeveral parts of the fields : but all&nbsp;this is of very little uſe ; for the living rooks will tear&nbsp;up the ground about the feathers, and under the dead&nbsp;ones, to ſteal the feed3. A much better way than either is to tear ſeveral rooks to pieces, and to ſeatter the&nbsp;pieces over the fields ; but this laſts but a little while,&nbsp;for the kites and other birds of prey ſoon carry off the&nbsp;pieces and feed upon them. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A </span><span class="font0">gun is a good remedy</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
