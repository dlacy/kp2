a name common to three cantons of Paleſtine. The firſt lay between mount Tabor and the ſea of Tiberias ; the ſecond between the city of Cæsarea of Paleſtine, and Joppa ; and the third lay beyond Jordan. To give an idea of perfect beauty, Iſaiah said, the glory of Lebanon and the beauty of Carmel muſt be joined to the abundance of Sharon. (Iſaiah xxxiii. 9. xxxi. 2.) The plains of Sharoa are of vaſt extent ; and, when ſurveyed by the Abbé Mariti a few years ago, they were ſown with cucumbers ; and he informs us, that ſuch a number is annually produced, as not only to ſupply the whole neighbourhood, but alſo all the coaſts of Cyprus and the city of Damietta. In the middle of the plain, between Arſus and Lydda, riſes a ſmall mountain, upon the ridge of which there is a ſmall village called Sharon, from the name of the ancient city whoſe king was conquered by Joſhua.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
