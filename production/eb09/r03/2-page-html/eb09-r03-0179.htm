<p><span class="font0">in the ISth could banish from the dreams of man, as we see in even such juvenile work as the pen and ink&nbsp;drawings of Gretchen in the Chapel, and Genevieve.&nbsp;In that great rebellion against the renascence of classicism&nbsp;which (after working much good and much harm) resulted&nbsp;in 18th-century materialism,—in that great movement of&nbsp;man’s soul which may be appropriately named “the&nbsp;Renascence of the Spirit of Wonder in Poetry and Art”&nbsp;—he became the acknowledged protagonist before ever&nbsp;the pre-Raphaelite brotherhood was founded aud down to&nbsp;his last breath at Birchington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And it was by inevitable instinct that Rossetti turned to that mysterious side of nature and man’s life which to&nbsp;other painters of his time had been a mere fancy-land, to&nbsp;be visited, if at all, on the wings of sport. It is not only&nbsp;in such masterpieces of his maturity as Dante’s Dream, La&nbsp;Pia, &amp;c., but in such early designs as Plow they Met&nbsp;Themselves, La Belle Dame Sans Merci, Cassandra, &amp;c.,&nbsp;that Rossetti shows how important a figure he is in the&nbsp;history of modern art, if modern art claims to be anything&nbsp;more than a mechanical imitation of the facts of nature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For if there is any permanent vitality in the Renascence of Wonder in modern Europe—if it is not a mere passing&nbsp;mood—if it is really the inevitable expression of the soul&nbsp;of man in a certain stage of civilization (when the sanctions which have made and moulded society are found&nbsp;to be not absolute and eternal, but relative, mundane,&nbsp;ephemeral, and subject to the higher sanctions of unseen&nbsp;powers that work behind “ the shows of things ”), then&nbsp;perhaps one of the first questions to ask in regard to any&nbsp;imaginative painter of the 19th century is, In what&nbsp;relation does he stand to the newly awakened spirit of&nbsp;romance? Had he a genuine and independent sympathy&nbsp;with that temper of wonder and mystery which all over&nbsp;Europe had preceded and now followed the temper of imitation, prosaic acceptance, pseudo-classicism, and domestic&nbsp;materialism ? or was his apparent sympathy with the temper&nbsp;of wonder, reverence, and awe the result of artistic environment dictated to him by other and more powerful&nbsp;and original souls around him ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We do not say that the mere fact of a painter’s or a poet’s showing but an imperfect sympathy with the&nbsp;Renascence of Wonder is sufficient to place him below a&nbsp;poet in whom that sympathy is more nearly complete,&nbsp;because we should then be driven to place some of the&nbsp;disciples of Rossetti above our great realistic painters, and&nbsp;we should be driven to place a poet like the author of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Excursion</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Prelude</span><span class="font0"> beneath a poet like the&nbsp;author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Queen's Wake</span><span class="font0"> ; but we do say that, other&nbsp;things being equal or anything like equal, a painter or&nbsp;poet of our time is to be judged very much by his sympathy with that great movement which we call the Renascence of Wonder—call it so because the word romanticism&nbsp;never did express it even before it had been vulgarized by&nbsp;French poets, dramatists, doctrinaires, and literary harlequins. To struggle against the prim traditions of the l8th&nbsp;century, the unities of Aristotle, the delineation of types&nbsp;instead of characters, as Chateaubriand, Madame de Staël,&nbsp;Balzac, and Hugo struggled, was well. But in studying&nbsp;Rossetti’s works we reach the very key of those “high&nbsp;palaces of romance ” which the English mind had never,&nbsp;even in the 18th century, wholly forgotten, but whose&nbsp;mystic gates no Frenchman ever yet unlocked. Not&nbsp;all the romantic feeling to be found in all the French&nbsp;romanticists (with their theory that not earnestness but&nbsp;the grotesque is the life-blood of romance) could equal&nbsp;the romantic spirit expressed in a single picture or drawing&nbsp;of Rossetti’s, such, for instance, as Beata Beatrix or&nbsp;Pandora. For, λvhile the French romanticists—inspired by&nbsp;the theories (drawn from English exemplars) of Novalis,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tieck, and Herder—cleverly simulated the old romantic feeling, the “beautifully devotional feeling” which Holman&nbsp;Hunt speaks of, Rossetti was steeped in it : he was so full&nbsp;of the old frank childlike wonder and awe which preceded the great renascence of materialism that he might&nbsp;have lived and worked amidst the old masters. Hence,&nbsp;in point of design, so original is he that to match such&nbsp;ideas as are expressed in Lilith, Hesterna Rosa, Michael&nbsp;»Scott’s Wooing, the Sea Spell, &lt;fcc., we have to turn to&nbsp;the sister art of poetry, where only we can find an&nbsp;equally powerful artistic representation of the idea at&nbsp;the core of the old romanticism—the idea of the evil&nbsp;forces of nature assailing man through his sense of&nbsp;beauty. We must turn, we say, not to art—not even&nbsp;to the old masters themselves—but to the most perfect&nbsp;efflorescence of the poetry of wonder and mystery—to such&nbsp;ballads as the “ Demon Lover,” to Coleridge’s “ Christa-bel” and “Kubla Khan,” to Keats’s “La Belle Dame&nbsp;sans Merci,” for parallels to Rossetti’s most characteristic&nbsp;designs. Now, although the idea at the heart of the&nbsp;highest romantic poetry (allied perhaps to that apprehension of the warring of man’s soul with the appetites of the&nbsp;flesh which is the basis of the Christian idea) may not&nbsp;belong exclusively to what we call the romantic temper&nbsp;(the Greeks, and also most Asiatic peoples, were more or&nbsp;less familiar with it, as we see in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saldmdn and Absal</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Jami), yet it became peculiarly a romantic note, as is seen&nbsp;from the fact that in the old masters it resulted in that&nbsp;asceticism which is its logical expression and which was&nbsp;once an inseparable incident of all romantic art. But, in&nbsp;order to express this stupendous idea as fully as the poets&nbsp;have expressed it, how is it possible to adopt the asceticism&nbsp;of the old masters? This is the question that Rossetti&nbsp;asked himself, and answered by his own progress in art.&nbsp;Not that it is possible here to give a chronological catalogue&nbsp;of Rossetti’s pictures. Moreover this has been already done&nbsp;in great measure by Mr William Sharp, Mr W. M. Rossetti,&nbsp;and others. We shall only dwell upon a few of those&nbsp;which most strongly indicate the course his genius took.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In all of them, however, the poorest and the best, is displayed that power which Blake calls vision—the power&nbsp;which, as he finely says, is “ surrounded by the daughters&nbsp;of inspiration,” the power, that is, of seeing imaginary&nbsp;objects and dramatic actions—physically seeing them as&nbsp;well as mentally—and flashing them upon the imaginations (even upon the corporeal senses) of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was as early as 1819 that Rossetti exhibited in the so-called Free Exhibition the Girlhood of the Virgin, one&nbsp;of the most beautiful and characteristic of all his works.&nbsp;He scarcely ever exhibited again in London, though just&nbsp;before his death his largest and most ambitious picture,&nbsp;Dante’s Dream, was exhibited at Liverpool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Then came, in 1850, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Germ,</span><span class="font0"> that short-lived magazine of four numbers upon which so much has of late been written. If </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Germ</span><span class="font0"> was really “ an official manifesto· or&nbsp;apologia of pre-Raphaelitism,” all that it had to preach&nbsp;was the noble doctrine of the sacredness, the saving grace,&nbsp;of conscience in art. In it appeared Rossetti’s poem the&nbsp;“Blessed Damozel,” the prose poem “Hand and Soul”&nbsp;(written as early as 1848), six sonnets, and four lyrics, but&nbsp;none of his designs, though two illustrations had been&nbsp;Jjrepared and discarded on account of their unsatisfactory&nbsp;condition when reproduced. Like the other contributors&nbsp;to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Germ</span><span class="font0"> Rossetti had a belief that can only be called&nbsp;passionate in the value of subject in art. For some years&nbsp;liis fecundity as a designer was called into astonishing&nbsp;activity, but not always in the field of wonder and poetic&nbsp;mystery. The artist who had had the strongest influence&nbsp;upon Rossetti’s early tastes was Madox Brown, whose&nbsp;genius, dramatic aud historic, has at length obtained</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
