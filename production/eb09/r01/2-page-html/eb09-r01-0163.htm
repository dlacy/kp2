<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Hume’s sceptical dissolution of knowledge. Reid’s theory of sensation, indeed, deserves more attention than has been&nbsp;generally bestowed upon it. According to this theory,&nbsp;sensations are not the objects of our perception, not even,&nbsp;as Kant maintained, the “ matter ” of our perceptions on&nbsp;which the “ form ” is superinduced; they are merely the&nbsp;“signs” which introduce us to the knowledge of real&nbsp;objects. The latter “are presented to the mind” by&nbsp;means of, or on occasion of, certain corresponding sensations; but the sensation and the perception “appear upon&nbsp;accurate reflexion not only to be different things, but as&nbsp;unlike as pain is to the point of a sword” (Hamilton’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reid,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 122). Sensation, it might be expressed, is the&nbsp;condition of perception, but there is no sort of community&nbsp;between the two. They are distinct in kind, and therefore&nbsp;the possibility of deriving the one from the other—&nbsp;of melting down the real world into subjective sensations&nbsp;—is once for all shut out. Reid’s position here enables&nbsp;him to escape also from the phenomenalism of the Kantian&nbsp;theory. Inasmuch as the permanent objects presented to&nbsp;us in perception are not in any sense a manipulation of&nbsp;subjective sensations, there is not even an apparent&nbsp;warrant for branding them as “ merely ” phenomenal.&nbsp;They are real in the full sense of the word; we know the&nbsp;world as it really exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The relativism or phenomenalism which Hamilton afterwards adopted from Kant and sought to engraft upon&nbsp;Scottish philosophy is thus wholly absent from the&nbsp;original Scottish doctrine. One or two passages may&nbsp;certainly be quoted from Reid in which he asserts that we&nbsp;know only properties of things and are ignorant of their&nbsp;essence. But the exact meaning which he attaches to&nbsp;such expressions is not quite clear; and they occur,&nbsp;moreover, only incidentally and with the air of current&nbsp;phrases mechanically repeated. In Dugald Stewart,&nbsp;however, the merely qualitative nature of our knowledge&nbsp;is consciously emphasized, and made the foundation of&nbsp;philosophical arguments; so that Stewart in this respect&nbsp;paves the way for the more thoroughgoing philosophy of&nbsp;nescience elaborated by Hamilton. But since Hamilton’s&nbsp;time the most typical Scottish thinkers have repudiated&nbsp;his relativistic doctrine, and returned to the original&nbsp;tradition of the school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Authorities</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—For the life, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Memoir</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> by Dugald Stewart, prefixed to Hamilton’s edition of Reid’s works, may be consulted,&nbsp;along with the account given by Dr M'Cosh in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Scottish Philosophy</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1875). The complete edition of the works by Sir William&nbsp;Hamilton, published in two volumes with notes and supplementary dissertations by the editor (6th ed. 1863), has superseded all&nbsp;others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A.

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REID, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Sir William </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1797-1858), administrator and man of science, was born in 1797 at the manse of Kin-glassie, Fifeshire, Scotland, and entered the army in 1809&nbsp;as a lieutenant of royal engineers. He saw active service&nbsp;in the Peninsula under Wellington, and afterwards took&nbsp;part in the bombardment of Algiers in 1816. It was&nbsp;while governor of Bermuda that in 1838 he published the&nbsp;work by which he is now known, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Law of Storms,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">which obtained a wide popularity and did good service in&nbsp;furthering the progress of this department of meteorology.&nbsp;In 1851 he was chairman of the executive committee of&nbsp;the Great Exhibition; on the completion of the work he&nbsp;was made a K.C.B. and appointed governor of Malta. He&nbsp;died in October 1858, shortly after his return to England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REIGATE, a market town and municipal borough of Surrey, is situated at the head of the long valley of Holms-dale Hollow, on three railway lines, 23 miles south of&nbsp;London. It consists principally of one long street, with&nbsp;surrounding houses and villas inhabited chiefly by persons&nbsp;having their occupations in London. Of the old castle,&nbsp;supposed to have been built before the Conquest, to com</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">mand the pass through the valley, there only remains the entrance to a cave beneath, 150 feet long and from 10 to&nbsp;12 feet high, excavated in the sand, which the barons&nbsp;used as a guardroom. The grounds have been laid out as&nbsp;a public garden. Near the market house is the site of an&nbsp;ancient chapel dedicated to Thomas h Becket. In the&nbsp;chancel of the parish church of St Mary, a building ranging from Transition Norman to Perpendicular, which dates&nbsp;from the beginning of the reign of Henry VII., were buried&nbsp;Archbishop Ussher and Lord Howard, the commander of&nbsp;the English navy against the Spanish Armada. Above&nbsp;the vestry there is a library containing some choice manuscripts and rare books. The grammar school was founded&nbsp;in 1675. Among the other public buildings are the town-hall, the public hall, the market-hall, and the working&nbsp;men’s institute. The town has some agricultural trade,&nbsp;and in the neighbourhood are quarries for freestone, hearthstone, and white sand. The area of the municipal borough&nbsp;is 6015 acres, with a population in 1871 of 15,916, and&nbsp;in 1881 of 18,662.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Domesday the town was called “ Cliurchfelle,” or “ the church in the field, ” and afterwards it was called Churchfield in Reigate,&nbsp;the earlier reading of the latter name being “Ridgegate.” The&nbsp;castle was taken by Louis the Dauphin in the reign of John. In&nbsp;the time of the Confessor the manor belonged to his queen Edith.&nbsp;A market was granted by Edward III. The town returned two&nbsp;members to parliament from the reign of Edward I. to the reign of&nbsp;William IV., and one from 1832 to 1867, when it was disfranchised&nbsp;for corrupt practices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REIMARUS, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Hermann Samuel </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1694-1768), known to history chiefly as the author of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Wolfenbiittel&nbsp;Fragments,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> was born at Hamburg, December 22, 1694.&nbsp;His father, the son of a clergyman and married into a&nbsp;patrician family of that city, was one of the masters&nbsp;in the Johanneum college, a good scholar and excellent&nbsp;teacher. Until his twelfth year the son received his&nbsp;education almost entirely from his father. He passed&nbsp;from his father’s tuition into the class of the famous&nbsp;scholar Johann Albrecht Fabricius, whose son-in-law he&nbsp;subsequently became. In his twentieth year he entered&nbsp;the university of Jena, where he studied theology, ancient&nbsp;languages, and philosophy. After making a tour in&nbsp;Holland and England (1720), he became privat-docent in&nbsp;the university of Wittenberg; and in 1723 he accepted the&nbsp;post of rector of the high, school at Wismar in Mecklenburg, which he exchanged four years afterwards for that of&nbsp;professor of Hebrew and Oriental languages in the high&nbsp;school of his native city. This post he held till his death,&nbsp;though offers of more lucrative and distinguished positions&nbsp;were at various times made to him. His professional&nbsp;duties were but light, and he employed his ample leisure&nbsp;in the study of philology, mathematics, philosophy,&nbsp;history, political economy, natural science, and natural&nbsp;history, for which he made expensive collections. Philosophy and theology, however, became with his advancing&nbsp;years the chief subjects of pursuit. From 1744 to 1768&nbsp;lie had in hand the theological work from which Lessing&nbsp;published the notorious </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fragments</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in 1774-78. Reimarus&nbsp;was held by his contemporaries in the highest esteem as a&nbsp;scholar, a thinker, an author, and a man. His house was&nbsp;the centre of the highest culture of Hamburg, and a&nbsp;monument of his influence in that city still remains in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">linns </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">der </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">patriotischen Gesellschaft,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> where the learned and&nbsp;artistic societies partly founded by him still meet. His&nbsp;wife bore him seven children, three only of whom lived to&nbsp;grow up, namely his only surviving son׳—the distinguished&nbsp;physician Johann Albrecht Heinrich—and two daughters,&nbsp;one of them being Elise, Lessing’s friend and correspondent.&nbsp;Ten days before his death he invited a select number of&nbsp;friends to dine with him, and, with his wonted cheerfulness&nbsp;and amiability, declared to them solemnly that this was h!3</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
