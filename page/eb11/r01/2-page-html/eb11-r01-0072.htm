<p><span class="font1">out of London with a ruling gradient of 1 in 1320. Other engineers, however, such as Joseph Locke, cheapened the&nbsp;cost of construction by admitting long slopes of 1 in 80 or 70. One of the steepest gradients in England on an important line&nbsp;is the Lickey incline at Bromsgrove, on the Midland railway&nbsp;between Birmingham and Gloucester, where the slope is 1 in&nbsp;37 for two miles. The maximum gradient possible depends&nbsp;on climatic conditions, a dry climate being the most favourable.&nbsp;The theoretical limit is about 1 in 16; between 1 in 20 and&nbsp;1 in 16 a steam locomotive depending on the adhesion between&nbsp;its wheels and the rails can only haul about its own weight.&nbsp;In practice the gradient should not exceed 1 in 22½, and even&nbsp;that is too steep, since theoretical conditions cannot always be&nbsp;realized; a wet rail will reduce the adhesion, and the gradients&nbsp;must be such that some paying load can be hauled in all weathers.&nbsp;When an engineer has to construct a railway up a hill having&nbsp;a still steeper slope, he must secure practicable gradients by&nbsp;laying out the line in ascending spirals, if necessary tunnelling&nbsp;into the hill, as on the St Gothard railway, or in a series of&nbsp;zigzags, or he must resort to a rack or a cable railway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rack Railways. —</span><span class="font0">In rack railways a cog-wheel on the engine engages in a toothed rack which forms part of the permanent way.&nbsp;The earliest arrangement of this kind was patented by John Blen-kinsop, of the Middleton Colliery, near Leeds, in 1811, and an engine&nbsp;built on his plan by Mathew Murray, also of Leeds, began in 1812&nbsp;to haul coals from Middleton to Leeds over a line 3½ m. long. Blenkinsop placed the teeth on the outer side of one of the running rails,&nbsp;and his reason for adopting a rack was the belief that an engine&nbsp;with smooth wheels running on smooth rails would not have sufficient&nbsp;'adhesion to draw the load required. It was not till more than half&nbsp;a century later that an American, Sylvester Marsh, employed the&nbsp;rack system for the purpose of enabling trains to surmount steep&nbsp;slopes on the Mount Washington railway, where the maximum&nbsp;gradient was nearly 1 in 2½. In this case the rack had pin teeth&nbsp;carried in a pair of angle bars. The subsequent development of&nbsp;rack railways is especially associated with a Swiss engineer, Nicholas&nbsp;Riggenbach, and his pupil Roman Abt, and the forms of rack&nbsp;introduced by them are those most commonly used. That of the&nbsp;latter is multiple, several rack-plates being placed parallel to each&nbsp;other, and the teeth break joint at ½, ⅓ or ¼ of their pitch, according&nbsp;to the number of rack-plates. In this way smoothness of working&nbsp;is ensured, the cog-wheel being constantly in action with the rack.&nbsp;Abt also developed the plan of combining rack and adhesional&nbsp;working, the engine working by adhesion alone on the gentler&nbsp;slopes but by both adhesion and the rack on the steeper ones.&nbsp;On such lines the beginning of a rack section is provided with a&nbsp;piece of rack mounted on springs, so that the pinions of the engine&nbsp;engage smoothly with the teeth. Racks of this type usually&nbsp;become impracticable for gradients steeper than 1 in 4, partly because&nbsp;of the excessive weight of the engine required and partly because&nbsp;of the tendency of the cog-wheel to mount the rack. The Locher&nbsp;rack, employed on the Mount Pilatus railway, where the steepest&nbsp;gradient is nearly 1 in 2, is double, with vertical teeth on each side,&nbsp;while in the Strub rack, used on the Jungfrau line, the teeth are cut&nbsp;in the head of a rail of the ordinary Vignoles type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cable Railways. —</span><span class="font0">For surmounting still steeper slopes, cable railways may be employed. Of these there are two main systems:&nbsp;(1) a continuous cable is carried over two main drums at each end&nbsp;of the line, and the motion is derived cither (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0">) from the weight&nbsp;of the descending load or (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0">) from a motor acting on one of the&nbsp;main drums; (2) each end of the cable is attached to wagons, one&nbsp;set of which accordingly ascends as the other descends. The weight&nbsp;required to cause the downward motion is obtained either by means&nbsp;of the material which has to be transported to the bottom of the&nbsp;hill or by water ballast, while to aid and regulate the motion generally&nbsp;steam or electric motors are arranged to act on the main drums,&nbsp;round which the cable is passed with a sufficient number of turns&nbsp;to prevent slipping. When water ballast is employed the water&nbsp;is filled into a tank in the bottom of the wagon or car, its quantity,&nbsp;if passengers are carried, being regulated by the number ascending&nbsp;or descending.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Curves. </span><span class="font1">—The curves on railways are either simple, when they consist of a portion of the circumference of a single circle,&nbsp;or compound, when they are made up of portions of the cir-cumference of two or more circles of different radius. Reverse&nbsp;curves are compound curves in which the components are&nbsp;of contrary flexure, like the letter S; strictly the term is only&nbsp;applicable when the two portions follow directly one on the&nbsp;other, but it is sometimes used of cases in which they are&nbsp;separated by a “ tangent ” or portion of straight line. In&nbsp;Great Britain the curvature is defined by stating the length of&nbsp;the radius, expressed in chains (1 chain = 66 ft. ), in America&nbsp;by stating the angle subtended by a chord 100 ft. long; the&nbsp;measurements in both methods are referred to the central line&nbsp;of the track. The radius of a ι-degree curve is 5730 ft., or&nbsp;about 86⅔ chains, of a 15-degree curve 383 ft. or rather less&nbsp;than 6 chains; the former is reckoned easy, the latter very&nbsp;sharp, at least for main lines on the standard gauge. On some&nbsp;of the earlier English main lines no curves were constructed&nbsp;of a less radius than a mile (80 chains), except at places where&nbsp;the speed was likely to be low, but in later practice the radius&nbsp;is sometimes reduced to 40 or 30 chains, even on high-speed&nbsp;passenger lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When a train is running round a curve the centrifugal force which comes into play tends to make its wheel-flanges press&nbsp;against the outer rail, or even to capsize it. If this pressure is&nbsp;not relieved in some way, the train may be derailed either (1) by&nbsp;“ climbing ” the outer rail, with injury to that rail and, generally,&nbsp;to the corresponding wheel-flanges; (2) by overturning about&nbsp;the outer rail as a hinge, possibly without injury to rails or&nbsp;wheels; or (3) by forcing the outer rail outwards, occasionally&nbsp;to the extent of shearing the spikes that hold it down at the&nbsp;curve, thus spreading or destroying the track. In any case the&nbsp;details depend upon whether the vehicle concerned is an engine,&nbsp;a wagon or a passenger coach, and upon whether it runs on&nbsp;bogie-trucks or not. If it is an engine, particular attention&nbsp;must be directed to the type, weight, arrangement of wheels&nbsp;and height of centre of gravity above rail level. In considering&nbsp;the forces that produce derailment the total mass of the vehicle&nbsp;or locomotive may be supposed to be concentrated at its centre&nbsp;of gravity. Two lines may be drawn from this point, one to&nbsp;each of the two rails, in a plane normal to the rails, and the&nbsp;ends of these lines, where they meet the rails, may be joined&nbsp;to complete a triangle, which may conveniently be regarded as a&nbsp;rigid frame resting on the rails. As the vehicle sweeps round&nbsp;the curve the centre of gravity tends to be thrown outwards,&nbsp;like a stone from a horizontal sling. The vertical pressure of the&nbsp;frame upon the outer rail is thus increased, while its vertical&nbsp;pressure on the inner rail is diminished. Simultaneously the&nbsp;frame as a whole tends to slide horizontally athwart the rails,&nbsp;from the inner towards the outer rail, urged by the same centrifugal forces. This sliding movement is resisted by placing a&nbsp;check rail on the inner side of the inner rail, to take the lateral&nbsp;thrust of the wheels on that side. It is also resisted in part by&nbsp;the conicity of the wheels, which converts the lateral force&nbsp;partly into a vertical force, thus enabling gravity to exert a&nbsp;restoring influence. When the lateral forces are too great to&nbsp;be controlled “ climbing ” occurs. Accidents due to simple&nbsp;climbing are, however, exceedingly rare, and are usually found&nbsp;associated with a faulty track, with “ plunging ” movements of&nbsp;the locomotive or vehicle, or with a “ tight gauge ” at curves&nbsp;or points.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From consideration of the rigid triangular frame described above, it is clear that the “ overturning ” force acts horizontally&nbsp;from the centre of gravity, and that the length of its lever arm&nbsp;is, at any instant, the vertical distance from the centre of gravity&nbsp;to the level of the outer rail. This is true whatever be the tilt&nbsp;of the vehicle at that instant. The restoring force exerted by&nbsp;gravity acts in a vertical line from the centre of gravity; and&nbsp;the length of its lever arm is the horizontal distance between&nbsp;this vertical line and the outer rail. If therefore the outer rail&nbsp;is laid at a level above that of the inner rail at the curve, overturning will be resisted more than would be the case if both&nbsp;rails were in the same horizontal plane, since the tilting of the&nbsp;vehicle due to this “ superelevation ” diminishes the overturning&nbsp;moment, and also increases the restoring moment, by shortening&nbsp;in the one case and lengthening in the other the lever arms at&nbsp;which the respective forces act. The amount of superelevation&nbsp;required to prevent derailment at a curve can be calculated@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>under perfect running conditions, given the radius of curvature,&nbsp;the weight of the vehicle, the height of the centre of gravity, the&nbsp;distance between the rails, and the speed; but great experience</span></p>
