The ribands being judiciouſly arranged with regard to their height and diſtance from&nbsp;each other, and forming regular ſweeps about the ſhip’s&nbsp;body, will compoſe a kind of frame, whoſe interior ſur-face will determine the curve of all the intermediate&nbsp;or filling-timbers which are ſtationed between the principal ones. As the figure of the ſhip’s bottom approaches to that of a conoid, and the ribands have a&nbsp;limited breadth, it is apparent that they cannot be applied to this convex ſurface without forming a double&nbsp;curve, which will be partly vertical and partly horizontal ; ſo that the vertical curve will increaſe by approaching the ſtem, and ſtill more by drawing near the&nbsp;iiern-poſt. It is alſo evident, that by deviating from&nbsp;the middle line of the ſhip’s length, as they approach&nbsp;the extreme breadth at the midſhip-frame, the ribands&nbsp;will alſo form an horizontal curve. The loweſt of theſe,&nbsp;which is termined upon the ſtem and ſtern-poſt, at&nbsp;the height of the riſing-line of the floor, and anſwers&nbsp;to the upper part of the floor-timber upon the midſhip-frame, is called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">floor-riband.</span><span class="font0"> That which coincides&nbsp;with the wing-tranſom, at the height of the lower-deck&nbsp;upon the midſhip-frame, is termed the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">breadth riband ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">all the reſt, which are placed between theſe two, are&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">intermediate ribands.</span><span class="font0"> See Ship-building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIBES, the Currant and Gooseberry-bush: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the pen-tandria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 36th order, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pomaceœ.</span><span class="font0"> There are five&nbsp;petals, and ſtamina inſerted into the calyx ; the ſtyle is&nbsp;bifid ; the berry polyſpermous, inferior.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The currant and the gooſeberry were long conſider-ed each as a ſeparate genus ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ribes</span><span class="font0"> the currant, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">groſſularia</span><span class="font0"> the gooſeberry ; but they are now joined&nbsp;together, the groſſularia being made a ſpecies of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">riles ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">all the currant kinds having inermous or thornleſs&nbsp;branches, and racemous cluſters of flowers and fruit ;&nbsp;and the gooſeberry have ſpinous branches, and flowers&nbsp;and fruit for the molt part ſingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are three ſpecies of the currant-tree, two of which, and their varieties, merit culture for their fruit;&nbsp;the other as a plant of variety or obſervation : all of&nbsp;which are inermous or unarmed, having no thorns on&nbsp;the branches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I. Rubrum, common red-currant tree, &amp;c. hath a ſhrubby ſtem, dividing low into many branches, forming a buſhy head, five or fix feet high or more, without&nbsp;thorns ; broad trilobate leaves, and ſmooth pendulous&nbsp;cluſters of plane greeniſh flowers, ſucceeded by ſmall&nbsp;cluſters of berries. It grows naturally in woods and the&nbsp;hedges in moſt parts ol Europe, and compriſes all ſorts&nbsp;of red and white currants ; as, common ſmall red currant—large bunched red currant—Champaigne pale-red currant—common ſmall white currant—large white&nbsp;Hutch currant—yellow blotched-leaved currant—ſil-ver ſtriped leaved—gold ſtriped leaved.—gooſeberry-leaved. All theſe ſorts are varieties of one ſpecies,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tabes rubrum,</span><span class="font0"> or common red currant ; it being the&nbsp;parent from which all the others were firſt obtained&nbsp;from the ſeed, and improved by culture. They all&nbsp;flower in the ſpring, and the fruit ripens in June and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">July ; and by having the trees in different ſituations and modes of training, ſuch as plantations of ſtandards in&nbsp;the open quarters for the general ſupply, others trained againſt walls or pales of different aſpect, the fruit&nbsp;may be continued ripe in good perfection from about&nbsp;the middle of June until November, provided the later&nbsp;crops are defended with mats or nets from the birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The nigrum, or black currant tree, hath a ſhrubby ſtem, dividing low into many branches, forming a&nbsp;buſhy head five or fix feet high ; broad trilobate leaves&nbsp;of a rank odour, and having racemous cluſters of oblong greeniſh flowers, ſucceeded by thin cluſters of&nbsp;black berries. The fruit of this ſpecies being of a&nbsp;ſtrong flavour, and ſomewhat phyſical teliſh, is not generally liked; it, however, is accounted very wholeſome:&nbsp;there is alſo made of it a ſyrup of high eſtimation&nbsp;for fore throats and quinſies ; hence the fruit is often&nbsp;called</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſquinancy berries.</span><span class="font0"> There is a variety called the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pennſylvanian black currant,</span><span class="font0"> having ſmaller ſhoots and&nbsp;leaves, not ſtrong ſcented, and ſmall fruit but of little&nbsp;value ; ſo the ſhrub is eſteemed only for variety and&nbsp;ſhrubberies. The mode of bearing of all the varieties&nbsp;of currants is both in the old and young wood all&nbsp;along the ſides of the branches and ſhoots, often upon&nbsp;a ſort of ſmall ſprigs and ſnags, producing the fruit in&nbsp;numerous long pendulous cluſters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The groſſularia, or common gooſeberry buſh, riſes&nbsp;with a low ſhrubby ſtem, dividing low into a very branchy buſhy head, armed with ſpines ; trilobate ſmalliſh&nbsp;leaves, having hairy ciliated footltalks ; and ſmall green-iſh flowers, ſucceeded by hairy berries.’ It conflits of&nbsp;many varieties, of different ſizes and colours.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reclinatum, or reclinated broad-leaved gooſe-berrybuſh, riſes with a low ſhrubby ſtem, and reclinated ſomewhat prickly branches, trilobate broadiſh leaves,&nbsp;and ſmall greeniſh flowers, having the pedunculi fur-niſhed with triphyllous bractea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The oxyacanthoides, or oxyacantha-leaved gooſeberry, hath a ſhrubby ſtem, and branches armed on&nbsp;all ſides with ſpines, and largiſh trilobate hawthorn&nbsp;leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The uva criſpa, or ſmooth gooſeberry, hath a&nbsp;ſhrubby ſtem, and branches armed with ſpines ; trilobate leaves ; pedicles having monophyllous bractea ; and&nbsp;ſmooth fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thecynoſhati, or prickly-fruited gooſeberry buſh,&nbsp;hath a ſhrubby ſtem and branches, armed with ſpines,&nbsp;moſtly at the axillas, and prickly fruit in cluſters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the above ſeven ſpecies of ribes, both currants· and gooſeberry kinds, and their reſpective varieties,&nbsp;are very hardy ſhrubs, that proſper almoit anywhere,&nbsp;both in open and ſhady ſituations, and in any common ſoil ; bearing plentifully in any expoſure, though&nbsp;in open funny ſituations they produce the largeſt and&nbsp;faireſt fruit, ripening to a richer vinous flavour ; but&nbsp;it is eligible to plant them in different ſituations and&nbsp;aſpects, in order to have the fruit as early and late as&nbsp;poſſible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">They are commonly planted in the kitchen-garden,-moſtly as dwarf ſtandards, in the open quarters, for the general ſupply ; being diſpoſed ſometimes in continued plantations in rows, eight or ten feet by ſix&nbsp;aſunder, where great quantities of the fruit are required for market or other large ſupplies ; and are·&nbsp;ſometimes diſpoſed in ſingle ranges round the outward</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
