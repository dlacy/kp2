<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">thc goδd and a </span><span class="font1">hell </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">for </span><span class="font1">the wicked. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In this heaven </span><span class="font1">the faints dwell in the preſence of God and the unin-terrupted ſplendors- of day. Thoſe who have been wife&nbsp;ſhine as the firmament, and thoſe who have converted&nbsp;many to righteouſneſs as the ſtars. Their bodies are&nbsp;glorious, immortal, incorruptible, not ſubject to diſeaſe,&nbsp;to pain, or to death. Their minds are ſtrangers to ſor-rtrw, to crying, to diſappointment ; all their deſires are&nbsp;preſently ſatisſied ; while they are calling, they are aπ-ſwered ; while they are fpeaking, they are heard. Their&nbsp;mental faculties are alſo enlarged ; they no more ſee&nbsp;things obfcurely, and as through a cloud, but continu-ally beholding new wonders and beauties in creation,&nbsp;are conſtantly exclaiming^ &quot; Holy, holy, holy ! is the&nbsp;Lord of Hoſts, worthy is he to receive glory, and honour, and th’inkſgiving ; and to him be afcribed wiſdom, and power, and might; for great and marvellous are&nbsp;his works, and the whole univerſe is filled with his glory.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Their notions of hell differ conſiderably. Some un-derſtanding the Scriptures literally, have plunged the v⅛ icſked into an abyſs without any bottom ; have made&nbsp;this g∏lρh darker than night ; have ſilled it with rancorous and malignant ſpirits, that are worſe than furies ;&nbsp;and have deſcribed it as lull of ſulphur, burning for&nbsp;ever. This frightful gulph has by ſome been placed&nbsp;in the bowels of the earth ; by ſome in the fun ; by&nbsp;ſome in the moon ; and by ſome in a comet : but as&nbsp;the Scriptures have determined nothing on the ſubject,&nbsp;all ſuch conjectures are idle and groundless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">others imagine, that the fire and ſulphur are here to be taken in a figurative ſenfe. Thefe fuppoſe the&nbsp;torments of hell to be troubles of mind and remorfes&nbsp;of conſcience ; and ſupport their opinion by obſerving,&nbsp;that matter cannot act upon ſpirit ; forgetting, perlιaps,&nbsp;that at the reſurrection the fpirſt is to he clothed with&nbsp;a body, and, at any rate, that ſt is not for man vainly&nbsp;to preſcribe bounds to omnipotence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">what ſeems to have tortured the genius of divines much more than heaven or hell, is a middle ſtate. Οη this ſubject there being little revealed in Scripture, many have&nbsp;thought it incumbent upon them to lupply the defect ;&nbsp;which they ſeem to have done in different ways. From&nbsp;the Scriptures ſpeaking frequently of the dead as ſleeping&nbsp;in their graves, thoſe who imagine that the powers of&nbsp;the mind are dependent on the body, ſuppoſe that they&nbsp;ſleep till the reſurrection, when they are to be awakened by the trump &lt;⅛f God, reunited to their bodies, have&nbsp;their faculties reſtored, and their ſentence awarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This opinion they Γupport by what St Peter ſays in the Acts, that David is not aſcended into heaven ; and&nbsp;that this patriarch could not poſſibly be ſpeaking of&nbsp;himſelf when he ſaid, “ Thou wilt not leave my ſoul in&nbsp;hell, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> the place of the dead.” They obſerve, too, that&nbsp;the victory of Chriſt over death and the grave ſeems to&nbsp;imply, that our fouls are ſubject to their power ; that&nbsp;accordingly the Scripture ſpeaks frequently of the foul’s&nbsp;drawing near to, of its being redeemed from, and of its&nbsp;deſcending into, the grave ; that the Pſalmiſt, however,&nbsp;declares plainly, that when the breath of man goeth&nbsp;forth, he returneth to his earth, and that very day his&nbsp;thoughts pcriſh. And ſhould any one choofe to con-fult Eccleſiaſtes, he will find, that the living know that&nbsp;they ſhall die, but that the dead know not any thing :&nbsp;that their love, and their hatred, and their envy, are&nbsp;periſhed-; aud- that there is </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">no work, nor </span><span class="font1">device, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">nor</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">wiſdom, nor knowledge, in the grave, whether theÿ are gone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thoſe who believe that the foul is not for the exer-cife of its faculties dependent on the body, are upon its feparation at death obliged to diſpoſe of it ſome other&nbsp;way. In eſtabliſhing their theory, they uſually begin&nbsp;with attempting to prove, from Scripture or tradi-tion, both its active and ſeparate exiſtence ; but with&nbsp;proofs from tradition we intend not to meddle. Their&nbsp;arguments from Scripture being of more value, deſerve&nbsp;our ferions conſtderation ; and are nearly as follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Abraham, they ſay, Ifaac, and Jacob, are ſtill living, becauſe Jehovah is their God, and he, it is allowed, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">is&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">not the God of the dead, but of the living. But their&nbsp;opponents reply, That this is the argument which our&nbsp;Saviour brought from the writings of Mofes to prove </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">future refurrection of the dead ; and that aay perfon who looks into the context, will ſee it was not&nbsp;meant ol a middle ſtate. From the dead living unto&nbsp;God, our Saviour infers nothing more than that they&nbsp;ihall live at the reſurrection ; and that theſe gentlemen would do well in future to make a diſtinction&nbsp;between limply living and living unto God : For though.&nbsp;Abιaham, lfaac, and Jacob, be living unto God, our&nbsp;Saviour~has affured us that Abraham is dead, and thé&nbsp;prophets dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A ſecond argument is that glimpfe which St PauI had oſ paradiſe about 14 years before he had written&nbsp;his Second Epiſtle to the Corinthians. To this argument their opponents reply, That as St Paul could not&nbsp;tell whether, on that occafion, he was out of the body&nbsp;or in the body, it is more than probable that the whole&nbsp;was a viſion ; and, at any rate, it is no prooſ oſ a ſeparate exiſtence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A third argument is, St Paul’s wiſhing to be abſent from the body, and preſent with the Lord. But, fay<sup>r&nbsp;</sup>their opponents, St Paul defιred not to be unclothed, but&nbsp;to be clothed upon r. and as ſome oſ thoſe who maintain a ſeparate exiſtencce, bring Scripture to prove that&nbsp;thc body ,∣ continues united to Chriſt till the reſurrec-tiυn ; in that cale, St. Paul, if he wiſhed to be preſertt&nbsp;with the Lord, ſhould have rather remained with his&nbsp;body than leſt it-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A fourth argument is, the appearance oſ Moſes and Elias upon the mount of transfiguration. To which&nbsp;their opponents reply, that theſe ſaint's appeared in&nbsp;their bodies ; that Elias was never diverted oſ his body;&nbsp;and that the account which we have oſ the burial of&nbsp;Moſes, has led fome of the ableſt critics and foundeſt&nbsp;divines to conclude, that he was likewiſe tranſlated to&nbsp;heaven without tailing death. At any rate, ſay they,&nbsp;he might have beeιr raifed from the dead for the very&nbsp;purpoſe of being preſent at the transfiguration, as the&nbsp;bodies of other faints certainly were, to bear teſtimony&nbsp;to our Lord's reſurrection and victory over the grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A fifth argument is, what our Saviour ſaid to the thief, “ verily I ſay unto thee, to-day thou ſhalt be&nbsp;with me in paradiſc.” The objection uſually made&nbsp;here is, that the expreſſion is evidently ambiguous, and'&nbsp;that the ſenſe depends entirely on the punctuation : for&nbsp;if the point be placed after </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to-day,</span><span class="font1"> the meaning will be&nbsp;&quot; verily, even now, I tell thee, thou ſhalt be with me&nbsp;in paradiſe.” But the import of paradiſe in this place,&nbsp;ſay the opponents, is likewiſe doubtful, we learn from&nbsp;St Peter’s explanation of the 16th Pſalm, that our Sa-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
