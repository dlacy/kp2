<p><span class="font1">As early as the 8th century, and probably still earlier, a stream of Slav colonization, advancing E. from the Danube, poured&nbsp;over the plains of S.W. Russia. It is also most probable that&nbsp;another similar stream—the N., coming from the Elbe, through&nbsp;the basin of the Vistula—ought to be distinguished. In the&nbsp;9th century the Slavs occupied the upper Vistula, the S. of the&nbsp;Russian lacustrine region, and the W. of the central plateau.&nbsp;They had Lithuanians to the W.; various Finnish tribes, intermingled towards the S.E. with Turkish (the present Bashkirs);&nbsp;the Bulgars, whose origin still remains doubtful, on the middle&nbsp;Volga and Kama; and to the S.E. the Turkish-Mongol races of&nbsp;the Pechencgs, Polovtsi, Uzes, &amp;c., while in the S., along the&nbsp;Black Sea, was the empire of the Khazars, who had under their&nbsp;rule several Slav tribes, and perhaps also some of Finnish origin.&nbsp;In the 9th century also the Ugrians are supposed to have left&nbsp;their Ural abodes and to have traversed S.E. and S. Russia&nbsp;on their way to the basin of the Danube. If the Slavs be&nbsp;subdivided into three hranches—the W. (Poles, Czechs and&nbsp;Wends), the S. (Servians,Bulgarians, Croatians, &amp;c.),and the E.&nbsp;(Great, Little and White Russians), it will be seen that, with&nbsp;the exception of some 3,000,000 Little Russians, now settled&nbsp;in East Galicia and in Poland, and of a few on the southern slope&nbsp;of the Carpathians, the whole of the E. Slavs occupy, as a compact&nbsp;body, W., central and S. Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Like other races of mankind, the Russian race is not pure. The Russians have absorbed and assimilated in the course of&nbsp;their history a variety of Finnish and Turko-Finnish elements.&nbsp;Still, craniological researches show that, notwithstanding this&nbsp;fact, the Slav type has been maintained with remarkable persistency: Slav skulls ten and thirteen centuries old exhibit&nbsp;the same anthropological features as those which characterize&nbsp;the Slavs of our own day. This may be explained by a variety&nbsp;of causes, of which the chief is the maintenance by the Slavs&nbsp;down to a very late period of gentile or tribal organization and&nbsp;gentile marriages, a fact vouched for, not only in the pages of&nbsp;the Russian chronicler Nestor, but still more by visible social&nbsp;evidences, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> later developing into the village community,&nbsp;and the colonization being carried on by large co-ordinated&nbsp;bodies of people. The Russians do not emigrate as isolated&nbsp;individuals; they migrate in whole villages. The overwhelming&nbsp;numerical superiority of the Slavs, and the very great differences&nbsp;in ethnical type, belief and mythology between the Indo-European and the Ural-Altaic races, may have contributed to&nbsp;the same end. Moreover, while a Russian man, far away from&nbsp;home among Siberians, readily marries a native, the Russian&nbsp;woman seldom does the like. All these causes, and especially&nbsp;the first-mentioned, have enabled the Slavs to maintain their&nbsp;ethnical purity in a relatively high degree, whereby they have&nbsp;been enabled to assimilate foreign elements and make them&nbsp;intensify or improve the ethnical type, without giving rise to&nbsp;half-breed races. The very same N. Russian type has thus been&nbsp;maintained from Novgorod to the Pacific, with but minor&nbsp;differentiations on the outskirts—and this notwithstanding the&nbsp;great variety of races with which the Russians have come into&nbsp;contact. But a closer observation of what is going on in the&nbsp;recently colonized confines of the empire—where whole villages&nbsp;live without mixing with the natives, but slowly bringing them&nbsp;over to the Russian manner of life, and then slowly taking in a&nbsp;few female elements from them—gives the key to this feature of&nbsp;Russian life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Not so with the national customs. There are features—the wooden house, the oven, the bath—which the Russian never&nbsp;abandons, even when swamped in an alien population. But&nbsp;when settled among these the Russian—the N. Russian—&nbsp;readily adapts himself to many other differences. He speaks&nbsp;Finnish with Finns, Mongolian with Buriats, Ostiak with&nbsp;Ostiaks; he shows remarkable* facility in adapting his agricultural practices to new conditions, without, however, abandoning the village community; he becomes hunter, cattle-breeder&nbsp;or fisherman, and carries on these occupations according to&nbsp;local usage; he modifies his dress and adapts his religious&nbsp;beliefs to the locality he inhabits. In consequence of all this,&nbsp;the Russian peasant (not, he it noted, the trader) proves himself&nbsp;to be an excellent colonist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Three different branches can be distinguished among the Russians from the dawn of their history:—the Great Russians, the Little&nbsp;Russians (Malorusses or Ukrainians), and the White&nbsp;Russians (the Byelorusses). These correspond to the two&nbsp;currents of immigration mentioned above—the N.’and S.,&nbsp;with perhaps an intermediate stream, the proper place&nbsp;of the White Russians not having been as yet exactly&nbsp;determined. The primary distinctions between these branches&nbsp;have been increased during the last nine centuries by their contact&nbsp;with different nationalities—the Great Russians absorbing Finnish&nbsp;elements, the Little Russians undergoing an admixture ol Turkish&nbsp;blood, and the White Russians submitting to Lithuanian influence.&nbsp;Moreover, notwithstanding the unity of language, it is easy to detect among the Great Russians themselves two separate branches,&nbsp;differing from one another by slight divergences of language and&nbsp;type and deep diversities of national character—the Central&nbsp;Russians and the Novgorodians. The latter extend throughout&nbsp;N. Russia into Siberia. Many minor anthropological differentiae&nbsp;can be distinguished among both the Great ana the Little Russians,&nbsp;depending probably on the assimilation of various minor subdivisions&nbsp;of the Ural-Altaians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Great Russians occupy in one compact mass the space enclosed by a line drawn from the White Sea to Like Pskov, the&nbsp;upper courses of the W. Dvina and the Donets, and thence, through&nbsp;the mouth of the Sura, by the Vetluga, to the Mezen. To the E. of&nbsp;this boundaiy they are intermingled with Turko-Finns, but in the&nbsp;Ural mountains they reappear in a second compact body, and thence&nbsp;extend through S. Siberia and along the courses of the Lena and the&nbsp;Amur. Great Russian Nonconformists are disseminated among&nbsp;Little Russians in the governments of Chernigov and Mogilev, and&nbsp;they reappear in greater masses in Novoroissa </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font1"> S. Russia), as also&nbsp;in N. Caucasia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Little Russians occupy the steppes of S. Russia, the S.W. slopes of the central plateau and those of the Carpathian and Lublin&nbsp;mountains, and the Carpathian plateau, that is, the governments of&nbsp;Podolia, Volhynia, Poltava, and Kiev. The Zaporozhian Cossacks&nbsp;colonized the steppes farther E., towards the Don, where they met&nbsp;with a large population of Great Russian runaways, constituting&nbsp;the present Don Cossacks. The Zaporozhian Cossacks, sent by&nbsp;Catherine II. to colonize the E. coast of the Sea of Azov, constituted&nbsp;there the Black Sea and later the Kuban Cossacks (part of whom,&nbsp;the Nekrasovsty, migrated to Turkey). They have also peopled&nbsp;large parts of the government of Stavropol and of N. Caucasia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The White Russians, intermingled to some extent with Great and Little Russians, Poles and Lithuanians, occupy the upper parts of&nbsp;the W. slope </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the central plateau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Finnish races, which in prehistoric times extended from the Ob all over N. Russia, even then were subdivided into Ugrians,&nbsp;Permyaks, Bulgarians and Finns proper, who drove back the previous Lapp population from what is now Finland, and about the&nbsp;7th century penetrated to the S. of the Gulf of Finland, in the region&nbsp;of the Livs and Kurs, where they fused to some extent with the&nbsp;Lithuanians and the Letts. At present the races of Finnish origin&nbsp;are represented in Russia by the following: (a) the W. Finns;&nbsp;the Tavasts, in central Finland; the Kvaens, in N.W. Finland;&nbsp;the Karelians, in the E., who also occupy the lake regions of Olonets&nbsp;and Archangel, and have settlements in Novgorod and Tver; the&nbsp;Izhores, on the Neva and the S.E. coast of the Gulf of Finland;&nbsp;the Esths, in Esthonia and the N. of Livonia; the Livs, on the Gulf&nbsp;of Riga; and the Kurs, intermingled with the Letts; (6) the N.&nbsp;Finns, or Lapps, in N. Finland and on the Kola peninsula, and the&nbsp;Samoyedes in Archangel and W. Siberia; (c) the Volga Finns, or&nbsp;rather the old Bulgarian branch, to which belong the Mordvinians,&nbsp;and the Cheremisses in Kazan, Kostroma and Vyatka, though they&nbsp;are classified by some authors with the following: (&lt;Z) the Permyaks,&nbsp;or Cis-Uralian Finns, including the Votiaks on the E. of Vyatka, the&nbsp;Permyaks in Perm, the Syryenians or Zyryans in Vologda, Archangel,&nbsp;Vyatka and Perm; (e) the Ugrians, or Trans-Uralian Finns, including the Voguls on both slopes of the Urals, the Ostiaks in Tobolsk&nbsp;and partly in.Tomsk, and the Magyars, or Ugrians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The following are the chief subdivisions of the Turko-Tatars in European Russia :—(1) The Tatars, of whom three different branches&nbsp;must be distinguished: (a) the Kazan Tatars on both banks of the&nbsp;Volga, below the mouth of the Oka, and on the lower Kama, but&nbsp;penetrating farther S. in Ryazan, Tambov, Samara, Simbirsk and&nbsp;Penza; (6) the Tatars of Astrakhan at the mouth of the Volga; and&nbsp;(c) those of the Crimea, a great many of whom emigrated to Turkey&nbsp;after the Crimean War (1854-56). There are, besides, a certain&nbsp;number of Tatars in.the S.E. in Minsk, Grodno and Vilna. (2) The&nbsp;Bashkirs, who inhabitkthe slopes of the S. Urals, that is, the steppes&nbsp;of Ufa and Orenburg, extend also into Perm and Samara. (3) The&nbsp;Chuvashes, on the right bank of the Volga, in Kazan and Simbirsk.&nbsp;(4) The Meshcheryaks, -a tribe of Finnish origin who formerly&nbsp;inhabited the basin of the Oka, and, driven thence during the 15th&nbsp;century by the Russian colonists, immigrated into Ufa and Perm,&nbsp;where they now live among tne Baskhirs, having adopted their&nbsp;religion and customs. (5) The Teptyars, also of Finnish origin,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
