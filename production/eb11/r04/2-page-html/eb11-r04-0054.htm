<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> he had never been, such as a paternal or maternal grandfather, when there was a natural </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> to underlie and justify the civil one—or when an ancestor gave in adoption a grandchild&nbsp;who was in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font1"> but would not become </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris</span><span class="font1"> by his death.&nbsp;The mode of strict adoption also was simplified, the old procedure&nbsp;by sales and manumissions, which degraded the child too much to&nbsp;the level of a slave, was abolished. The modes of legitimation of&nbsp;children born of a concubine, especially that by subsequent marriage&nbsp;of the parents, first introduced </span><span class="font0">by </span><span class="font1">Constantine, were regulated, and&nbsp;the extent of the rights of the legitimated issue carefully defined.&nbsp;Emancipation was simplified in a similar way to that of strict&nbsp;adoption. Tutory at law was opened to the pupil's nearest kinsman,&nbsp;whether on ’the father’s side or the mother’s; and the mother&nbsp;herself, or the child's grandmother, might be allowed, under certain&nbsp;conditions, to act as its guardian. Slavery was often converted&nbsp;into the milder condition of colonate; but, even where this did not&nbsp;happen, the rights of owners were not allowed to be abused; for&nbsp;slaves were permitted to claim the protection of the magistrate, and&nbsp;cruelty by a master might result in his being deprived of his human&nbsp;property. Kinship that had arisen between two persons when one&nbsp;or both were slaves </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(serviliscognatio)</span><span class="font1"> was recognized as creative not&nbsp;only of disabilities but of rights. The modes of manumission were&nbsp;multiplied, and the restriction of the legislation of the early empire&nbsp;abolished; and a freedman invariably became a citizen, Junian&nbsp;Latinity and dediticiancy being no longer recognized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amendments on the Law of Property and Obligation.—A</span><span class="font1">n the law of property the principal changes of the Christian Empire were the&nbsp;simplification of the forms of conveyance, the extension&nbsp;of the colonate, the introduction and regulation of emphyteusis and the remodelling of the law of prescription.&nbsp;Simplification of the forms of conveyance was necessary only in the&nbsp;case of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">resmancipi,</span><span class="font1"> for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">resnecmancipt</span><span class="font1"> had always passed by deliveiy.&nbsp;From the Theodosian Code it is apparent that movable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">usually passed in the same way from very early in the period, and that&nbsp;for the mancipation of lands and houses—for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in jure cessio</span><span class="font1"> had disappeared with the formular system—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asolemnis traditio, i.e.</span><span class="font1"> a written&nbsp;instrument and delivery following thereon, and both before witnesses,&nbsp;had been gradually substituted. Of this there is no trace in the&nbsp;Justinianian Code. For Justinian abolished all remains of the distinction between </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> between full&nbsp;ownership, bonitarian ownership and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nudum jus Quiritium,</span><span class="font1"> placing&nbsp;movables and immovables on a footing of perfect equality so far as&nbsp;their direct conveyance was concerned. But, as regarded the possession required of an acquirer to cure any defect in the conveyance,&nbsp;he made a marked difference between immovables and movables.&nbsp;For, amalgamating the old positive, usucaption of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> with&nbsp;the negative “ prolonged possession ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(longi temporis possessio)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">that had been first introduced for immovables in the provinces&nbsp;(probably by the provincial edict), and afterwards by rescripts of&nbsp;Caracalla for movables,<sup>@@1</sup> he declared that possession on a sufficient&nbsp;title and in good faith should in future make the possessor legal&nbsp;owner of the thing possessed by him, provided that the possession of&nbsp;himself and his author had endured uninterruptedly for three years&nbsp;in the case of a movable, and in the case of an immovable for ten&nbsp;years if the party against whom he possessed was resident in the&nbsp;same province, or for twenty if he resided in another one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The same causes that led to the colonate induced the introduction of emphyteusis,<sup>@@2 </sup>an institution which had already existed in some&nbsp;of the Eastern provinces when independent, and which&nbsp;came to be utilized first by the emperors, then by the&nbsp;church, and afterwards by municipalities and private&nbsp;landowners, for bringing into cultivation the large tracts of provincial&nbsp;land belonging to them which were unproductive and unprofitable&nbsp;through want of supervision on the spot. Its nature and conditions&nbsp;(which bore a certain similarity to the earlier </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus in agro vectigali</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;the Western Empire, with which it was ultimately fused, and to&nbsp;hereditary leases sometimes granted in the early Empire) were&nbsp;carefully defined by Zeno and amended by Justinian. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphyteuta,</span><span class="font1"> as the grantee of the right was ultimately called, did&nbsp;not become owner; the granter still remained </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dominus,</span><span class="font1"> all that the&nbsp;grantee enjoyed being </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a jus in re aliena,</span><span class="font1"> but so extensive as hardly&nbsp;to be distinguishable from ownership. It conferred upon him and&nbsp;his heirs a perpetual right in the lands included in the grant, in consideration of a fixed annual payment to the lord </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(canon)</span><span class="font1"> and due&nbsp;observance of conventional and statutory conditions; but he was&nbsp;not entitled to abandon it, nor able to free himself of the obligations&nbsp;he had undertaken, without the lord’s consent. The latter was&nbsp;entitled to hold the grant forfeited if the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">canon</span><span class="font1"> fell into arrear&nbsp;for three years (in church lands for two), or if the land-tax was in&nbsp;arrear for the same period, or if the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emphyteuta</span><span class="font1"> allowed the lands to&nbsp;deteriorate, or if he attempted to alienate them </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(alienare meliora-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tiones</span><span class="font1"> as the text says) without observance of statutory requirements. These were that he should intimate an intended alienation and the&nbsp;name of the intended alienee to the lord, so that the latter, before&nbsp;giving his assent, might satisfy himself that he would not be a loser&nbsp;by the transaction; and, if the alienation was to be by sale, he had&nbsp;to state the price fixed, so as to give the lord the opportunity of&nbsp;exercising his statutory right of pre-emption at the same figure. If&nbsp;those requirements were complied with, and. the lord (himself declining to purchase) stated no reasonable objection to the proposed&nbsp;alienee, he was not entitled to resist the alienation, provided </span><span class="font0">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">payment </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(laudemium)</span><span class="font1"> was made.to him of 2% of the sale price&nbsp;or of the value of the lands in consideration of his enforced&nbsp;consent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The changes in the law of obligation were more superficial than those in the law of property, and consisted principally&nbsp;in the simplification of formalities and in some cases&nbsp;in their entire abolition. To describe them, however,&nbsp;would carry us into details which would here be out of place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Changes in the Law of Succession.—</span><span class="font1">The changes made in the law of succession by Justinian’s Christian predecessors, especially&nbsp;Theodosius 11. and Anastasius, were far from insignificant;&nbsp;but hisown were in somedirectionspositively revolutionary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The testament </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram</span><span class="font1"> of the/us </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">civile</span><span class="font1"> probably never obtained any firm footing in the East; for it was only&nbsp;by Caracalla’s constitution conferring citizenship on all his&nbsp;free subjects that provincials generally acquired </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">testamenli factio;</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;by that time a testament bearing.externally the requisite number of&nbsp;seals had been recognized as sufficient for a grant of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">unchallengeable by the heirs-at-law, even though they were able to&nbsp;prove that neither </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae mancipatio</span><span class="font1"> nor </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">testamenli nuncupatio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">had intervened. Hence th£ universal adoption of what Justinian&nbsp;calls the praetorian testament, which, however, underwent considerable reform at the hands of the emperors, notably Theodosius 11.&nbsp;and Valentinian 111., in the requirement (in the ordinary case) of&nbsp;signature by the testator and subscription by the witnesses, thereby&nbsp;becoming what Justinian calls the tripartite testament. There&nbsp;was much hesitating legislation on the subject before the law was&nbsp;finally established as it stands in the Justinianian books; and even&nbsp;at the last we find it encumbered with many exceptions and reservations in favour of testaments that were merely deeds of division by&nbsp;a parent among his children, testaments made in time of plague,&nbsp;testaments made before a magistrate and recorded in books of court,&nbsp;testaments entrusted to the safe keeping of the emperor, and so&nbsp;forth. Codicils had become deeds of such importance as, in the&nbsp;absence of a testament, to be dealt with as imposing a trust on the&nbsp;heir-at-law; it was therefore thought expedient to deny effect to&nbsp;them unless attested by at least five witnesses. And a most important step in advance was taken by Justinian in the recognition&nbsp;of the validity of an o<sup>r</sup>al </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa</span><span class="font1"> trust; for he declared that, if it&nbsp;should be represented to a competent judge that a person on his&nbsp;death-bed had.by word of mouth directed his heir to give something&nbsp;to the complainant, the heir should be required either on his oath&nbsp;to deny the averment or to give or pay what was claimed.<sup>@@3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the matter of intestacy there had been long a halting between two opinions—a desire still further to amend the law in the direction&nbsp;taken by the praetors and by the legislature in the Ter-tullian and Orphitian senatusconsults, and yet a hesitancy&nbsp;about breaking altogether from the time-hallowed principle&nbsp;of agnation. Justinian in his Code went far beyond his&nbsp;predecessors, making a mother’s right of succession independent&nbsp;altogether of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus liberorum;</span><span class="font1"> extending that of a daughter or&nbsp;sister to her descendants, without any deduction in favour of agnates. thus excluded; admitting emancipated collaterals and their&nbsp;descendants as freely as if there had been no </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio&nbsp;minima;</span><span class="font1"> applying to agnates the same </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">successio graduum</span><span class="font1"> that the&nbsp;praetors had allowed to cognates, and so forth. But it was by his&nbsp;Novels, especially the 118th and 127th, that he revolutionized&nbsp;the system, by eradicating agnation altogether (except as regard?&nbsp;adopted children) and settling the canons of descent—which were the&nbsp;same, for real and personal estate—solely on the basis of blood&nbsp;kinship, whether through males or females, and whether crossed or&nbsp;not by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio.</span><span class="font1"> First came descendants of the intestate,&nbsp;male and female alike, taking </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per capita</span><span class="font1"> if all were of the same&nbsp;degree,, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per stirpes</span><span class="font1"> if of different degrees. Failing descendants, the&nbsp;succession passed to the nearest ascendants, and, concurrently with&nbsp;them, to brothers and sisters of full blood </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(germani)</span><span class="font1"> and (by Nov. 127)&nbsp;the children of any that had predeceased. Where there were ascendants alone, one-half of the succession went to the paternal line&nbsp;and one-half to the maternal; where there were ascendants and&nbsp;brothers and sisters, or only brothers and sisters, the division&nbsp;was made equally </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per capita;</span><span class="font1"> when children of a deceased brother&nbsp;or sister participated J t was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per stirpes.</span><span class="font1"> In the third class came&nbsp;brothers and sisters of half blood and their children, and grandchildren of brothers and sisters german; the division here was on&nbsp;the same principle as in the second class. The fourth class included&nbsp;all other collaterals according to propinquity, apparently to the&nbsp;remotest degree, and without distinction between full and half blood;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
