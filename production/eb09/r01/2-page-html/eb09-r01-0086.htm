<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and his touch can with more or less certainty be traced in some of Perugino’s panels which were executed about 1502.&nbsp;Many of those who, like Messrs Crowe and Cavalcasene,&nbsp;adopt the earlier date of Raphael’s apprenticeship believe&nbsp;that his hand is visible in the execution of the beautiful&nbsp;series of frescos by Perugino in the Sala del Cambio, dated&nbsp;1500 ; as does also M. Muntz in his excellent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Raphael,&nbsp;sa Vie,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Paris, 1881, in spite of his accepting the end of&nbsp;1499 as the period of Raphael’s first entering Perugino’s&nbsp;studio,—two statements almost impossible to reconcile.&nbsp;Considering that Raphael was barely seventeen when these&nbsp;frescos were painted, it is hardly reasonable to attribute&nbsp;the finest heads to his hand ; nor did he at an early age&nbsp;master the difficulties of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fresco buono.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Resurrection&nbsp;of Christ in the Vatican and the Diotalevi Madonna in the&nbsp;Berlin Museum are the principal pictures by Perugino in&nbsp;parts of which the touch of Raphael appears to be visible,&nbsp;though any real certainty on this point is unattainable.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">About 1502 Raphael began to execute independent works ; four pictures for churches at Città di Castello&nbsp;were probably the earliest of these, and appear to have&nbsp;been painted in the years 1502-4. The first is a guild-banner painted on one side with the Trinity, and below,&nbsp;kneeling figures of S. Sebastian and S. Rocco ; on the&nbsp;reverse is a Creation of Eve, very like Perugino in style, but&nbsp;possessing more grace and breadth of treatment. These&nbsp;are still in the church of S. Trinità.@@<sup>2</sup> Also for Città di&nbsp;Castello were the coronation of S. Niccolo Tolentino, now&nbsp;destroyed, though studies for it exist at Oxford and Lille&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Gaz. d. B. Arts,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1878, i. p. 48), and the Crucifixion, now&nbsp;in the Dudley collection, painted for the church of S.&nbsp;Domenico, and signed RAPHAEL VRBINAS P. It is a&nbsp;panel 8 feet 6 inches high by 5 feet 5 inches wide, and&nbsp;contains noble figures of the Virgin, St John, St Jerome,&nbsp;and St Mary Magdalene. The fourth painting executed&nbsp;for this town, for the church of S. Francesco, is the&nbsp;exquisitely beautiful and highly finished Sposalizio, now&nbsp;in the Brera at Milan, signed and dated RAPHAEL&nbsp;VRBINAS MDIIII. This is closely copied both in composition and detail from Perugino’s painting of the same&nbsp;subject now at Caen, but is far superior to it in sweetness&nbsp;of expression and grace of attitude. The Temple of&nbsp;Jerusalem, a domed octagon with outer ambulatory in&nbsp;Perugino’s picture, is reproduced with slight alterations&nbsp;by Raphael, and the attitudes and grouping of the figures&nbsp;are almost exactly the same in both. The Connestabile&nbsp;Madonna is one of Raphael’s finest works, painted during&nbsp;his Perugian period ; it is a round panel ; the motive, the&nbsp;Virgin reading a book of hours, is a favourite one with&nbsp;him, as it was with his father Giovanni. This lovely&nbsp;picture was lost to Perugia in 1871, when Count Connestabile sold it to the emperor of Russia for ¿613,200.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Second or Florentine Period</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">150J/.-1508</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—From 1504 to 1508 Raphael’s life was very stirring and active. In the&nbsp;first half of 1504 he visited Urbino, where he painted two&nbsp;small panels for Duke Guidobaldo, the St George and the&nbsp;St Michael of the Louvre. His first and for him momentous visit to Florence was made towards the end of&nbsp;1504, when he presented himself with a warm letter of&nbsp;recommendation @@<sup>3</sup> from his patroness Joanna della Rovere</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to the gonfaloniere Pier Soderini. In Florence Raphael was kindly received, and, in spite of his youth (being&nbsp;barely of age), was welcomed as an equal by the majority&nbsp;of those great artists who at that time had raised Florence&nbsp;to a pitch of artistic celebrity far above all other cities of&nbsp;the world. At the time of his arrival the whole of artistic&nbsp;Italy was being excited to enthusiasm by the cartoons of&nbsp;the battle of Anghiari and the war with Pisa, on which&nbsp;Da Vinci and Michelangelo were then devoting their&nbsp;utmost energies (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Leonardo </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Michelangelo). To&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">describe the various influences under which Raphael came&nbsp;and the many sources from which he drank in stores of&nbsp;artistic knowledge would be to give a complete history&nbsp;of Florentine art in the 15th century.@@<sup>4</sup> With astonishing&nbsp;rapidity he shook off the mannerisms of Perugino, and&nbsp;put one great artist after another under contribution for&nbsp;some special power of drawing, beauty of colour, or grace&nbsp;of composition in which each happened to excel. Nor was&nbsp;it from painters only that Raphael acquired his enlarged&nbsp;field of knowledge and rapidly growing powers. Sculptors&nbsp;like Ghiberti and Donatello must be numbered among&nbsp;those whose works helped to develop his new-born style.@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>The Carmine frescos of Masaccio and Masolino taught&nbsp;this eager student long-remembered lessons of methods&nbsp;of dramatic expression.@@<sup>6</sup> Among his contemporaries it&nbsp;was especially Signorelli and Michelangelo who taught&nbsp;him the importance of precision of line and the necessity&nbsp;of a thorough knowledge of the human form.@@<sup>7</sup> From Da&nbsp;Vinci he learned subtleties of modelling and soft beauty&nbsp;of expression,@@<sup>8</sup> from Fra Bartolomeo nobility of composition and skilful treatment of drapery in dignified folds.@@<sup>9&nbsp;</sup>The friendship between Raphael and the last of these&nbsp;was very close and lasted for many years. The architect&nbsp;Baccio d’Agnolo was another of his special friends, at&nbsp;whose house the young painter enjoyed social intercourse&nbsp;with a large circle of the chief artists of Florence, and&nbsp;probably learned from him much that was afterwards useful in his practice as an architect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The transition in Raphael’s style from his first or Perugian to his second or Florentine manner is well shown&nbsp;in the large picture of the Coronation of the Virgin painted&nbsp;for Maddalena degli Oddi, now in the Vatican, one of the&nbsp;most beautiful that he ever produced, and especially remarkable for its strong religious sentiment,—in this respect&nbsp;a great contrast to the paintings of his last or Roman&nbsp;manner which hang near it. The exquisite grace of the&nbsp;angel musicians and the beauty of the faces show signs&nbsp;of his short visit to Florence, while the general formality&nbsp;of the composition and certain details, such as the fluttering ribbands of the angels, recall peculiarities of Perugino&nbsp;and of Pinturicchio, with whose fine picture of the same&nbsp;subject hung close by it is interesting to compare it.&nbsp;Raphael’s painting, though by far the more beautiful of&nbsp;the two, is yet inferior to that of Pinturicchio in the&nbsp;composition of the whole; an awkward horizontal line&nbsp;divides the upper group of the Coronation from that below,&nbsp;the apostles standing round the Virgin’s tomb, filled with&nbsp;roses and lilies (Dante, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Par.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> xxiii. 73), while the older&nbsp;Perugian has skilfully united the two groups by a less&nbsp;formal arrangement of the figures. The predella of this&nbsp;masterpiece of Raphael is also in the Vatican; some of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Parts of Perugino’s beautiful triptych of the Madonna, with the&nbsp;archangels Raphael and Michael, painted for the Certosa near Pavia&nbsp;and now in the National Gallery of London, have been attributed to&nbsp;Raphael, but with little reason. Perugino’s grand altar-piece at&nbsp;Florence of the Assumption of the Virgin shows that he was quite&nbsp;capable of painting figures equal in beauty and delicacy to the St&nbsp;Michael of the Certosa triptych. See Frizzoni, L'Arte Italiana nella&nbsp;Gal. Nat. di Londra, Florence, 1880.</span></p>
