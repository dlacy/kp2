See Prerogative.</p><p>Regalia is aſſo uſed for the apparatus of a coronation ; as the crown, the ſceptre with the crofs, that with the dove, St Edward’s ſtaff, the globe, and the erb with the croſs, four ſeveral ſwords, &amp;c.—The re-galia of Scotland were depofited in the caſtle of Edinburgh in the year 1707, in what is called the <hi rend="italic">Jewel GJfi.ee.</hi> This room was lately opened by ſome commſſ-fioners appointed by the king, when the large cheſt in which it is ſhppoſed they were placed was found ; but as it has not, that we have heard of, been opened, it is impoſſible to ſay whether they be there or not. It is very generally thought they were carried to the Tower of London in the reign of Queen Anne ; and a crown is there ſhewn which is called the Scotch crown. AVe do not believe, however, that that is the real crown of Scotland; and think it probable that the Scotch regalia are in the cheſt which was lately found. If they are not there, they muſt have been taken away by ſtealth, and either deſtroyed or melted down, for we do not believe that they are in the Tower of London.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> <hi rend="italic">of</hi> REGALITY, in Scots law.
