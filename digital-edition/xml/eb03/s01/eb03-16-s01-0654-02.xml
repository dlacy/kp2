 in botany: A genus of the order of polygamia aequalis, belonging to the ſyngeneſia claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 49th order, <hi rend="italic">Compoſite.</hi> The receptacle is paleaceous; there is no pappus; the calyx imbricated and hemiſpherical.</p><p>The moſt remarkable ſpecies are, 1. The chamaecy-pariſus, or common lavender-cotton, which has been long known in the Engliſh gardens; it was formerly titled <hi rend="italic">abrotanum ſaemina,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ſemale ſouthernwood,</hi> and by the corruption of words was called <hi rend="italic">brοtany</hi> by the market- people: it grows naturally in Spain, Italy, and the warm parts of Europe. This hath a ligneous ſtalk, dividing into many branches, garniſhed with ſlender hoa</p><p>ry leaves, that are four ways indented, and have a rank, ſtrong, odour when handled. The branches are terminated by a ſingle flower, compoſed of many hermaphrodite florets, which are ſiſtular, cut into five parts at the top, of a ſulphur colour, and are included in one common ſcaly empalement, having no borders or rays. Theſe are ſucceeded by ſmall, oblong, ſtriated ſeeds, which are ſeparated by ſcaly chaff, and ripen in the empalement; the plants love a dry ſoil and a ſheltered ſituation. 2. The villoſa, with woolly leaves, has a ſhrubby ſtalk, which branches out like the former, but the plants ſeldom grow ſo tall. The branches are garniſhed very cloſely below with leaves ſhaped like thoſe of the other fort, but ſhorter, thicker, and whiter; the flowers are much larger, and the brims of the florets are more reflexed; they are of a deeper ſulphur colour than the other. It grows naturally in Spain. 3. The decumbens, with linear leaves, is of lower ſtature than either of the former, ſeldom riſing more than 15 or 16 inches high. The branches ſpread horizontally near the ground, and are garniſhed with ſhorter leaves than either of the former, which are hoary and finely indented; the ſtalks are terminated by ſingle flowers, of a bright yellow colour, which are larger than thoſe of the firſt fort. 4. The virens, with very long linear leaves, riſes higher than either of the former. The branches are more diffuſed; they are ſlender, ſrnooth, and garniſhed with very narrow long leaves, which are of a deep green colour, but two ways indented; the ſtalks are ſlender, naked towards the top, and terminated by ſingle flowers of a gold colour. 5. The roſmarinifolia, with linear entire leaves, hath ſhrubby ſtalks, which riſe about three feet high, ſending out long ſlender branches, garniſhed with ſingle linear leaves of a pale-green colour. The ſtalks are terminated by large, ſingle, globular flowers, of a pale ſulphur colour. 6. The minor, with linear obtuſe leaves, is ſomewhat like the fifth; but the branches are ſhorter, thicker, and cloſer garniſhed with leaves, which come out in cluſters. The flower- ſtalks are ſparſedly diſpoſed, and have leaves to their top; the flowers are ſmall, and of a yellow colour. 7. The chamsemelifolia, with obtuſe woolly leaves, hath ſhrubby ſtalks, which riſe three feet high, garniſhed with broader leaves than either of the former, whoſe indentures are looſer, but double; they are hoary, and when bruiſed have an odour like chamomile. The leaves are placed pretty far aſunder, and the ſtalks are garniſhed with them to the top. The ſtalks are divided likewiſe at the top into two or three foot-ſtalks, each ſuſtaining one pretty large ſulphur-coloured flower.</p><p>All theſe plants may be cultivated ſo as to become ornaments to a garden, particularly in ſmall boſquets of ever-green ſhrubs, where, if they are artfully intermixed with other plants of the ſame growth, and placed in the front line, they will make an agreeable variety; eſpecially if care be taken to trim them twice in a ſummer, to keep them within bounds, otherwiſe their branches are apt to ſtraggle, and in wet weather to be borne down and diſplaced, which renders them unſightly; but when they are kept in order, their hoary and different-coloured leaves will have a pretty effect in ſuch plantations. —They may be propagated by planting ſlips or cuttings during the ſpring, in a<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0661.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0655"/>
border of light freſh earth, but muſt be watered and ſhaded in hot dry weather, until they have taken root; after which they will require no farther care but to keep them clean from weeds till autumn, when they ſhould be tranſplanted where they are deſigned to remain: but if the ground is not ready by that time to receive them, it will be proper to let them remain in the border until ſpring; for if they are tranſplanted late in autumn, they are liable to be deſtroyed by cold in winter.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
