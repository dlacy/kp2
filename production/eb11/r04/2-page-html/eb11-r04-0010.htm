<p><span class="font0">daughters on emancipation ceased to be of the family of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> who had emancipated them. A . daughter’s&nbsp;children could never as such be members of the family of their&nbsp;maternal grandfather; for children born in lawful marriage&nbsp;followed the family of their father, while those who were illegitimate ranked from the moment of birth as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patresfamilias</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">matresfamilias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the early Romans, as with the Hindus and the Greeks, marriage was a religious duty a man owed alike to his ancestors&nbsp;and to himself. Believing that the happiness of the&nbsp;dead in another world depended on their proper&nbsp;burial and on the periodical renewal by their descendants of&nbsp;prayers and feasts and offerings for the repose of their souls, it&nbsp;was incumbent upon him above all things to perpetuate his&nbsp;race and his family cult. The Romans were always strictly&nbsp;monogamous. In taking to himself a wife, he was about to&nbsp;detach her from her father’s house and make her a partner of&nbsp;his family mysteries. With the patrician at least this was to&nbsp;be done only with divine approval, ascertained by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">auspicia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">His choice was limited to a woman with whom he had </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">connubinm&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(ertyajuia) or right of intermarriage. This was a matter of&nbsp;state arrangement; and in the regal period Roman citizens&nbsp;could have it outside their own bounds only with members of&nbsp;states with which they were in alliance, and with which they&nbsp;were connected by the bond of common religious observances.&nbsp;A patrician citizen, therefore, if his marriage was to be reckoned&nbsp;lawful </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(justae nuptiae),</span><span class="font0"> had to wed either a fellow-patrician or&nbsp;a woman who was a member of an allied community. In either&nbsp;case it was essential that she should be outside his sobrinal&nbsp;circle, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> more remote in kinship than the sixth degree. The&nbsp;ceremony was a religious one, conducted by the chief pontiff&nbsp;and the flamen of Jupiter, in presence of ten witnesses, representatives probably of the ten curies of the bridegroom’s tribe,&nbsp;and was known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">farreum</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">confarreatio.</span><span class="font0"> Its effect was to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">dissociate the wife entirely from her father’s house, and to make <sub>t </sub>her a member of her husband’s; for confarreate marriage involved </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in manum conventio,</span><span class="font0"> the passage of the wife into her&nbsp;husband’s “ hand” or power, provided he was himself </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pater-Jamilias}</span><span class="font0"> if he was not, then, though nominally in his hand,&nbsp;she was really subject like him to his family head. Any property she had of her own—which was possible only if she had&nbsp;been independent before marriage—passed to him as a matter&nbsp;of course; if she had none, her </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> usually provided&nbsp;her a dowry </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(dos),</span><span class="font0"> which shared the same fate. In fact, so far&nbsp;as her patrimonial interests were concerned, she was in much&nbsp;the same position as her children; and on her husband’s death&nbsp;she had a share with them in his inheritance as if she had been&nbsp;one of his daughters. In other respects </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> conferred more&nbsp;limited rights than </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas]</span><span class="font0"> for Romulus is said to have&nbsp;ordained that, if a man put away his wife except for adultery&nbsp;or one or two other grave offences, he forfeited his estate half&nbsp;to her and half to Ceres, while if he sold her he was to be given&nbsp;over to the infernal gods.<sup>@@1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Patria potestas</span><span class="font0"> was the name given to the power exercised by a father, or by his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> if he was himself </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">over the issue of such </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">justae nuptiae.</span><span class="font0"> The Roman&nbsp;jurists boasted that it was a right enjoyed by none&nbsp;but Roman citizens; and it certainly was peculiar to&nbsp;them in this sense, that nowhere else, except perhaps among&nbsp;the Latin race from which they had sprung, did the paternal&nbsp;power attain such an intensity. The omnipotence of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> and the condition of utter subjection to him of&nbsp;his children </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font0"> became greatly modified in the course&nbsp;of centuries; but originally the children, though in public</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">life on an equality with the house-father, in private life, and so long as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font0"> lasted, were subordinated to him to such&nbsp;an extent as, according to the letter of the law, to be in his hands&nbsp;little better than his slaves. They could have nothing of their&nbsp;own: all they earned was his; and, though it was quite common&nbsp;when they grew up for him to give them </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peculia,</span><span class="font0"> “ cattle of their&nbsp;own,” to manage for their own benefit, these were only </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de facto&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">theirs, but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de jure</span><span class="font0"> his. For offences committed by them outside&nbsp;the family circle, for which he was not prepared to make&nbsp;amends, he had to surrender them to the injured party, just&nbsp;like slaves or animals that had done mischief. If his right to&nbsp;them was disputed, he used the same action for its vindication&nbsp;that he employed for asserting his ownership of his field or his&nbsp;house: if they were stolen, he proceeded against the thief by&nbsp;an ordinary action of theft; if for any reason he had to transfer&nbsp;them to a third party, it was by the same form of conveyance&nbsp;that he used for the transfer of things inanimate. Nor was&nbsp;this all; for, according to the old formula recited in that sort&nbsp;of adoption known as adrogation, he had over them the power&nbsp;of life and death, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus vitae necisque.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It might happen that a marriage was fruitless, or that a man saw all his sons go to the grave before hirn, and that&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> had thus to face the prospect of the&nbsp;extinction of his family and of his own descent to&nbsp;the tomb without posterity to make him blessed. To&nbsp;obviate so dire a misfortune, he resorted to the practice of&nbsp;adoption, so common in India and Greece. If it was a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> that he adopted, the process was called adrogation&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(adrogatio)</span><span class="font0">; if it was a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfaniilias</span><span class="font0"> it was simply </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">adoptio.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The latter, unknown probably in the earlier regal period, was,&nbsp;as we first know it, a somewhat complicated conveyance of&nbsp;a son by his natural parent to his adopter, the purpose of course&nbsp;being expressed; its effect was simply to transfer the child&nbsp;from the one family to the other. But the former was much&nbsp;more serious, for it involved the extinction of one family that&nbsp;another might be perpetuated. It was therefore an affair of&nbsp;state. It had to be approved by the pontiffs,. who probably&nbsp;had to satisfy themselves that there were relatives of the adro-gatee to attend to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manes</span><span class="font0"> of the ancestors whose cult he was&nbsp;renouncing; and on their favourable report it had to be sanctioned by a vote of the curies, as it involved the deprivation&nbsp;of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> of their possible right of succession to him and&nbsp;possible prejudice to creditors through </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio.</span><span class="font0"> If&nbsp;it was sanctioned, then the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">adrogatus,</span><span class="font0"> from being himself the head&nbsp;of a house, sank to the position of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font0"> in the house&nbsp;of his adopting parent; if he had had wife or children subject&nbsp;to him, they passed with him into his new family, and so did&nbsp;everything that belonged to him and that was capable of&nbsp;transmission from one person to another. The adopting&nbsp;parent acquired </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font0"> over the adopted child exactly as if&nbsp;he were the issue of his body; while the latter enjoyed in his&nbsp;new family the same rights exactly that he would have had if&nbsp;he had been bom in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font0"> represent the masterful aspects of the patrician’s domestic establishment. Its conjugal&nbsp;and parental ones, however, though not so prominent&nbsp;in the pages of the jurists, are not to be lost sight of.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The patrician family in the early history of the law was governed as much by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fas</span><span class="font0"> as by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus.</span><span class="font0"> The husband was priest&nbsp;in the family, but wife and children alike assisted in its prayers,&nbsp;and took part in the sacrifices to its lares and penates. As the&nbsp;Greek called his wife the house-mistress, ¿«nron'a, so did the&nbsp;Roman speak of his as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">materfamilias,<sup>@@2</sup> </span><span class="font0">the house-mother. She&nbsp;was treated as her husband’s equal. As for their children, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font0"> was so tempered by the natural sense of parental duty&nbsp;on the one side and filial affection on the other that in daily life&nbsp;it was rarely felt as a grievance; while the risk of an arbitrary&nbsp;exercise of the domestic jurisdiction, whether in the heat of&nbsp;passion or under the impulse of justifiable resentment, was</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>See Plutarch, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rom.</span><span class="font0"> 22; Marquardt, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rom. Altert.</span><span class="font0"> v. 7. The question whether a husband could in early law sell his wife is one&nbsp;on which modern writers are not agreed. The better opinion is&nbsp;that he could not do so if the marriage was by confarreation. Apart&nbsp;from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex regia</span><span class="font0"> above mentioned, it would have been inconsistent with her dignity as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">materfamitias..</span><span class="font0"> There.is certainly no&nbsp;trace of its having been done. In marriages by coemption and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">usus,</span><span class="font0"> on the other hand, it is not improbable that it was allowed,&nbsp;though here also there is no evidence ot it.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>@@@2 </sup>Materfamilias</span><span class="font0"> is used, in the texts in two distinct senses— (1) as a woman </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> not subject to any family head;&nbsp;and (2) as a wife </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in manu mariti.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
