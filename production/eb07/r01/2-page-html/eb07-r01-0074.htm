<p><span class="font0">the scorching sun of India, and the biting frosts of Iceland, were equally braved and disregarded. But, with all this&nbsp;apparent superiority to ordinary infirmities, he fell a victim&nbsp;to consumption, brought on, it is believed, by those habits of&nbsp;intense application, and abstinence from proper nutriment,&nbsp;to which we have already alluded ; and he died at that period of life (forty-eight) when the faculties of the human&nbsp;mind have little more than attained their maturity, leaving&nbsp;behind him a name that will not soon be forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The acquirements of Professor Rask were multifarious and extraordinary, and such as justly entitled him to our&nbsp;respect and admiration. There never perhaps existed any&nbsp;scholar whose study of language had been directed to a wider&nbsp;circle, and assuredly none who had made the structure of language so much an object of attention. He was the great comparative anatomist of philology; not building up theories out&nbsp;of scattered fragments, collected as it were by accident, but&nbsp;drawing his conclusions from the most profound and elaborate research, and, by comparison, comprehension, and exhaustion, initiating us into those curious inquiries which&nbsp;have for the most part been perfunctorily handled by the&nbsp;majority of critics. Not that Rask’s writings have enabled&nbsp;the world to form an accurate estimate of his extraordinary&nbsp;learning. To have written the best Icelandic, and the bes t&nbsp;Anglo-Saxon Grammar ; to have tracked, through Hebrew&nbsp;or Kieroglyphical records, the chronology of the Egyptian&nbsp;kings ; to have edited Eddas or Sagas, and carried oft' prizes&nbsp;for essays on this or the other limited inquiry ; all these constituted little compared to what this extraordinary man was&nbsp;capable of effecting, had it pleased God to prolong his life.&nbsp;He was one of the few men qualified to write on philology,&nbsp;with a sufficient knowledge of the subject in all its bearings ;&nbsp;who had seen with his own eyes, and heard with his own ears,&nbsp;the tribes and the tongues which overspread the surface of&nbsp;the globe ; who, if he had not girdled the whole earth, had&nbsp;at least explored those tracts in which so many nations were&nbsp;cradled ; and who, travelling throughout the East in quest&nbsp;of philological knowledge, carried with him a mind so well&nbsp;trained, and exercised, and cultivated, that nothing could&nbsp;be wasted upon it Of this we have ample evidence furnished to us at every stage in his protracted expedition. His&nbsp;progress was like that of Fame in Virgil, continually gaining&nbsp;fresh accessions of knowledge, and increasing in intellectual&nbsp;stature, but, unlike the impersonation of the poet, never&nbsp;raising aloft his head so as to plunge it into the region of&nbsp;the clouds. His primary object was the collection of sufficient materials to serve as the basis of a most enlarged induction ; his next was to employ analysis or resolution in&nbsp;decomposing, separating, and classifying these materials, so&nbsp;as to render them disposable for the purposes of general investigation ; and his last by synthetical reasoning, to lay a&nbsp;solid foundation for the science of philology, and to deduce&nbsp;those general laws of connection, resemblance, or filiation,&nbsp;which may be discovered in every branch of the great family of languages. He lived to accomplish the first, and&nbsp;he had even entered upon his analytical labours, when exhausted nature sunk under the toil, and the grave swallowed&nbsp;up the fruits of all his researches. Rask was no theorist ;&nbsp;and, if his life had happily been prolonged, he would have&nbsp;finally settled the question, which has long been agitated, viz.&nbsp;whether induction be really applicable as an instrument of&nbsp;investigation and discovery in the science of philology, (a.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RASTADT, a city of the grand duchy of Baden, in Germany, the capital of a bailiwick of its own name. It is situated on the river Murg, just before that stream joins the Hhine. There is a fine palace of the prince, now used as&nbsp;a college or gymnasium, a nunnery, an hospital, 568 houses,&nbsp;and 4400 inhabitants. Peace was made here in 1715; and&nbsp;in 1797 and 1798 a congress was held to negotiate a peace&nbsp;between the German empire and France, but it came to no&nbsp;pacific termination. It has some few small manufactures</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0">RATAFIA, a fine spirituous liquor, prepared from the kernels and other parts of several kinds of fruits, particularly cherries and apricots. Ratafia of cherries is prepared&nbsp;by bruising the cherries, and putting them into a vessel&nbsp;wherein brandy has long been kept ; then adding to them&nbsp;the kernels of cherries, with strawberries, sugar, cinnamon,&nbsp;white pepper, nutmeg, cloves, and to twenty pounds of&nbsp;cherries ten quarts of brandy. The vessel is left open ten&nbsp;or twelve days, and then stopped close for two months before it be tapped. Ratafia of apricots is prepared in two&nbsp;ways, namely, either by boiling the apricots in white wine,&nbsp;adding to the liquor an equal quantity of brandy, with sugar, cinnamon, mace, and the kernels of apricots, infusing&nbsp;the whole for eight or ten days, then straining the liquor,&nbsp;and putting it up for use ; or by infusing the apricots, cut&nbsp;in pieces, in brandy, for a day or two, passing it through a&nbsp;straining bag, and then putting in the usual ingredients.</span></p>
