It is especially valuable in the treatment of duodenal&nbsp;catarrh or catarrh of the biliary ducts with jaundice ; and&nbsp;in certain skin diseases it has proved to be a valuable&nbsp;medicine, the results obtained being probably due to the&nbsp;chrysophan contained in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The botanical source of Chinese rhubarb cannot be said to have beeu as yet definitely cleared up by actual identification of plants&nbsp;observed to be used for the purpose. Rheum palmatum, R.&nbsp;officinale, R. palmatum (var. tanguticuni), R. colinianum, and&nbsp;R. Fraηzeηbaxhii have been variously stated to be the source of&nbsp;it, but the roots produced by these species under cultivation in&nbsp;Europe do not present the characteristic network of white veins&nbsp;exhibited by the best specimens of the Chinese drug (see Goebel&nbsp;and Kunze, pt. ii., pi. i. figs. 25, 35).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Chemistry.—The chief chemical constituents of Chinese rhubarb are chrysophan (Cι<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>4</sub>), rheotannic acid (C<sub>20</sub>H<sub>2ti</sub>Oj<sub>4</sub>), emodin&nbsp;(C<sub>15</sub>H<sub>10</sub>O<sub>5</sub>), a neutral colourless crystalline substance having the&nbsp;formula C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, a white and a dark brown crystalline resin; it&nbsp;also contains mucilage in the proportion of 11 to 17 per cent.,&nbsp;and a considerable quantity of oxalate of lime. An albuminoid&nbsp;principle containing nitrogen and sulphur is also found in the&nbsp;root, which, in the presence of water, as recently shown by&nbsp;Kubli,@@<sup>1</sup> decomposes the chrysophan into chrysophanic acid and&nbsp;glucose, and apparently exerts a similar action on rheotannic&nbsp;acid, giving rise to the formation of rheumic acid (C<sub>2θ</sub>H<sub>16</sub>O<sub>9</sub>) and&nbsp;a fermentable sugar. Rheumic acid is a reddish-brown powder,&nbsp;sparingly soluble in cold water. The albuminoid principle is insoluble in rectified spirit of wine ; consequently a preparation of&nbsp;the root made with that menstruum contains the active principles&nbsp;of the drug in the natural state, whilst an aqueous extract contains&nbsp;them in an altered condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Production and Commerce.—Rhubarb is produced in the four northern provinces of China proper (Chih-li, Shan-se, Shen-se, and&nbsp;Ho-uan), in the north-west provinces of Kan-suh formerly included&nbsp;in Shen-se, but now extending across the desert of Gobi to the&nbsp;frontier of Tibet, in the Mongolian province of Tsing-hai,&nbsp;including the salt lake Koko-nor, and the districts of Tangut,&nbsp;Sifan, and Turfan, and in the mountains of the western provinces&nbsp;of Sze-chuen. According to Richthofen the best rhubarb is&nbsp;collected exclusively from wild plants in the high mountains of&nbsp;western Sze-chuen between the sources of the Hoang-ho and the&nbsp;rivers Ya-lung Keang and Min-keang, and comes into trade under&nbsp;the name of Shen-se rhubarb.@@<sup>2</sup> Two of the most important centres&nbsp;of the trade are Sining-fu in the province of Kan-suh and Kwan-hien in Sze-chuen. From Shen-se, Kan-suh, and Sze-chuen the&nbsp;rhubarb is.forwarded to Hankow, and thence carried to Shanghai,&nbsp;whence it is shipped to Europe. Lesser quantities are shipped&nbsp;from Tien-tsin, and occasionally the drug is exported from Canton,&nbsp;Amoy, Fuh-chow, and Ning-po.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Very little is known concerning the mode of preparing the drug for the market. According to Mr Bell, who on a journey from St&nbsp;Petersburg to Peking had the opportunity of observing the plant in a&nbsp;growing state, the root is not considered to be mature until it is six&nbsp;years old. It is then dug up, usually in the autumn, and deprived&nbsp;of its cortical portion and smaller branches, and the larger pieces&nbsp;are divided in half longitudinally ; these pieces are bored with&nbsp;holes and strung up on cords to dry, in some cases being previously&nbsp;subjected to a preliminary drying on stone slabs heated by fire&nbsp;underneath. In Bhutan the root is said to be hung up in a kind&nbsp;of drying room, in which a moderate heat is regularly maintained.&nbsp;The effect produced by the two drying processes is very different ;&nbsp;when dried by artificial heat, the exterior of the pieces becomes&nbsp;hardened before the interior has entirely lost its moisture, and&nbsp;consequently the pieces decay in the centre, although the surface&nbsp;may show no change. These two varieties are technically known&nbsp;as kiln-dried and sun-dried ; and it was on account of this&nbsp;difference in quality that the Russian officer at Kiachta had every&nbsp;piece examined by boring a hole to its centre. The best rhubarb&nbsp;occurs in pieces of a yellowish colour externally, more or less&nbsp;marked with a network of whitish veins, the surface being convex&nbsp;and smooth. Internally it presents no signs of decay, but is&nbsp;compact, marbled with reddish-brown and white, mixed sometimes&nbsp;with iron grey. The smaller cylindrical sections of the root which&nbsp;have not been divided longitudinally are technically known as&nbsp;“rounds,” and have usually a hole with a piece of string left in&nbsp;it ; the flat pieces are more rarely pierced. Inferior qualities are&nbsp;shrunken and shrivelled on the surface, and externally of a&nbsp;brownish tint, showing traces of the darker bark, and when broken&nbsp;opeu are frequently decayed in the centre.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to Mr F. Newcombe, Mea. Press and Cire., August&nbsp;2, 1882, the Chinese esteem the Shen-se rhubarb as the best, that&nbsp;coming from Kanchow being the most prized of all ; Sze-chuen rhubarb&nbsp;has a rougher surface and little flavour, and brings only about half&nbsp;the price ; Chung-chi rhubarb also is greatly valued, while the Chi-chuang, Tai-huang, and Shan-huang varieties are considered worthless.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">European Rhubarb.—As early as 1608 Prosper Alpinus of Padua cultivated as the true rhubarb a plant which is now known as&nbsp;Rheum Rhapontieum, L., a native of southern Siberia and the basin&nbsp;of the Volga. This plant was introduced into England through&nbsp;Sir Matthew Lister, physician to Charles I., who gave seed obtained&nbsp;by him in Italy to the botanist Parkinson. The culture of this&nbsp;rhubarb for the sake of the root was commenced in 1777 at Banbury&nbsp;in Oxfordshire, by an apothecary named Hayward, the plants&nbsp;being raised from seed sent from Russia in 1762, and with such&nbsp;success that the Society of Arts awarded him a silver medal in&nbsp;1789 and a gold one in 1794. The cultivation subsequently extended to Somersetshire, Yorkshire, and Middlesex, but is now&nbsp;chiefly carried on at Banbury. English rhubarb root is sold&nbsp;at a cheaper rate than the Chinese rhubarb, and forms a considerable article of export to America, and is said to be used in&nbsp;Britain in the form of powder which is of a finer yellow colour&nbsp;than that of Chinese rhubarb. The Banbury rhubarb appears to&nbsp;be a hybrid between R. Rhapontieum and A. undulaturn,—the&nbsp;root, according to E. Colin, not presenting the typical microscopic&nbsp;structure of the former. During the last few years very good&nbsp;rhubarb has been grown at Banbury from Kheum officinale, but&nbsp;these two varieties are not equal in medicinal strength to the&nbsp;Chinese article, yielding less extract,—Chinese rhubarb affording,&nbsp;according to H. Seier, 58 per cent., English rhubarb 21 per cent.,&nbsp;and R. officinale 17 per cent. In France the cultivation of rhubarb&nbsp;w<sup>,</sup>as commenced in the latter half of the last century,—R. com-pactum, R. palmatum, R. Rhapontieum, and R. undulaturn, L.,&nbsp;being the species grown. The cultivation has, however, now&nbsp;nearly ceased, small quantities only being prepared at Avignon&nbsp;and a few other localities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The culture of Rheum compaetum was begun in Moravia in the beginning of the present century by Prikyl, an apothecary in&nbsp;Austerlitz, and until twenty-five or thirty years ago the root was&nbsp;largely exported to Lyons and Milan, where it was used for dyeing&nbsp;silk. As a medicine 5 parts are stated to be equal to 4 of Chinese&nbsp;rhubarb. Rhubarb root is also grow<sup>ι</sup>n at Auspitz in Moravia and&nbsp;at Ilmitz, Kremnitz, and Frauenkirchen in Hungary; A. Emodi is&nbsp;said to be cultivated for the same purpose in Silesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The cultivation of Rheum palmatum, var. tangutieum, has been begun within the last few' years in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhubarb is also prepared for use in medicine from wild species in the Himalayas and Java.</span></p>
