<p><span class="font1">ter, and there deposits them in safety, the tadpole soon issuing forth, and swimming immediately. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prickly toad,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">' B. spinosus</span><span class="font1"> of Daudin, which derives its name from strong projections on its tubercles, seems also to possess a singular peculiarity. It is never met with on the surface of the&nbsp;soil, and is only procured by means of the plough. The&nbsp;country people are persuaded it never leaves its retreat voluntarily ; and Daudin suspects that it deposits its ova in&nbsp;the earth, in humid places, near the subterranean sources&nbsp;of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Most of the toads of tropical climates are remarkable for their great size. Of this we give an instance in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">marine toad, Rana marina,</span><span class="font1"> Gmel., a native of South America,&nbsp;the length of whose body extends to nearly a foot. It is&nbsp;also remarkable for its </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">post-aural</span><span class="font1"> projections, which are an&nbsp;inch long, and oval shaped. The feet are not webbed ; the&nbsp;toes are terminated with round knobs, and furnished with&nbsp;short claws resembling the human nails in miniature. There&nbsp;are many other recorded species of toads proper, on which,&nbsp;however, we cannot dwell ; and we now proceed to several genera which have recently been separated from the&nbsp;group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Genus Bombinator. This genus differs from the other toads only in having the tympanum, or sort covering of the&nbsp;ear, hid under the skin. Rhinella of Fitzinger (Oxyr-hyncus of Spix) is distinguished by a prolonged muzzle.&nbsp;(See Plate CCCCXXXIII. fig. 4.) M. Gay has lately informed us </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann. des Sc. Nat., Avril</span><span class="font1"> 1836, p. 224), that in&nbsp;Chili there is a genus allied to Rhinella, consisting of several agreeably coloured species, which are always viviparous.&nbsp;In the same locality he made a similar remark regarding&nbsp;several species of snakes. To these two genera succeed the&nbsp;Otilopha of Cuvier, which has also an acute snout, and&nbsp;on each side of the head a projecting crest extending to the&nbsp;gland called parotid. In the genus Breviceps of Merrem&nbsp;(part of Fitzinger’s genus Engystoma), neither the tympanum nor parotids are apparent ; the body is oval, the head&nbsp;and mouth are remarkably small, and the feet scarcely at&nbsp;all webbed. (See Plate CCCCXXXIII. fig. 5.) We shall&nbsp;here introduce a very few species belonging to these genera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To the genus Bombinator belongs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">B. bοmbiηus (Rαnα bοmbina,</span><span class="font1"> Gmel.), which is the smallest and most aquatic&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">the European toads. It is gray or brown above, blackish blue with orange spots beneath. The hind feet are&nbsp;completely webbed, and nearly as long as those of frogs,&nbsp;so that it leaps nearly as well as they do. It affects morasses. Of the genus Rhinella, Spix has depicted and described five species, most of which, according to Cuvier, it&nbsp;is difficult to distinguish from the proper toads. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mitred&nbsp;toad</span><span class="font1"> of English writers, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">margaritifera</span><span class="font1"> of Gmelin, is usually adduced as a type of the genus Otilopha. It is a native&nbsp;of Brazil, and about the size of the common toad ; it is rufous brown above and whitish beneath, beset with numerous small tubercles of a bluish or pearly cast, whence the&nbsp;French name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">crapaud perlé ;</span><span class="font1"> but its principal characteristic is the subtriangular form of its head, the sides of which,&nbsp;beyond each eye, project into an angular protuberance. From&nbsp;the nose likewise an elevated white line runs along each side&nbsp;of the head, over the shoulder, to the sides ; the fore feet&nbsp;are unwebbed, the hind are partly so. Genuine specimens&nbsp;of the genus Breviceps present animals not a little singular&nbsp;in their forms. Such are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">short-headed</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">indistinct&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">toad</span><span class="font1"> of British authors, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rαna breνiceps</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. systoma&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of Schneider. They are oval-shaped like eggs, with scarcely&nbsp;any projecting head ; and one of them has actually been&nbsp;called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">headless toad. (Rana acephala,</span><span class="font1"> Schn.). The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">shortheaded toad</span><span class="font1"> is a very small animal, about half the size of&nbsp;the common toad ; the head is completely blended and incorporated with the thorax, and the surface is rather wrinkled&nbsp;than tuberculous. It is a native of Africa, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">li. systoma</span><span class="font1"> comes from the East Indies, and has a thick rounded&nbsp;body, with a head so lost in the general outline that the&nbsp;mouth is scarcely apparent ; the legs, too, are peculiarly&nbsp;short, and appear almost as if imbedded in the wrinkled skin&nbsp;of the sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We now advance to tile genus Pipa, which is universally distinguished from the toads. Its generic characters are&nbsp;the following : The body is flattened horizontally ; the head&nbsp;is broad and triangular ; the tongue is so adherent that it&nbsp;appears to be wanting (it is often said to be so) ; the tympanum is hid beneath the skin ; the small eyes are placed&nbsp;toward the margin of the lower jaw ; the extremities of all&nbsp;the fingers are divided into four small points ; and finally,&nbsp;the male has an enormously sized larynx, like a triangular&nbsp;osseous box, which encloses two moveable ossiculi which&nbsp;occasionally close the branchiæ. Of this genus, that well-known and most singular animal commonly called the&nbsp;Surinam toad </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Pipa Surinamensis,</span><span class="font1"> Laurenti,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ranapipa&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of Linnæus), may be taken as a type. It seems to have&nbsp;been introduced to the notice of naturalists at the close of&nbsp;the seventeenth century, and was first described by the celebrated Ruysch. It is one of the most uncouth and hideous of nature’s creatures, and is especially signalizcd for&nbsp;some of the most extraordinary phenomena regarding the&nbsp;growth of its young which are to be found throughout the&nbsp;range of the animal kingdom. The size of the Surinam&nbsp;toad considerably exceeds that of our common species.&nbsp;The mouth is very wide ; the hands are tetradactylous ; the&nbsp;fingers long and slender, and each divided at the tip into&nbsp;four distinct processes, all of which, when narrowly inspected with a glass, are found to be again subdivided in nearly&nbsp;a similar manner. The web of the hind feet reaches to the&nbsp;tips of the toes. The male is rather larger than the female,&nbsp;sometimes attaining the length of seven inches. The back&nbsp;is studded with granules, which are somewhat more numerous and larger on the female ; the skin round the neck, in&nbsp;both sexes, forms a kind of loose wrinkled collar. The&nbsp;general colour of both is a dark blackish brown. This reptile has been long celebrated for the manner in which its&nbsp;young are perpetuated ; and on this account it has become&nbsp;the object of much attention. It was for a time supposed&nbsp;that the ova issued from the deeper seated parts of the back,&nbsp;and were then enclosed in small cells on its surface till they&nbsp;were regularly hatched. Later observations in correcting&nbsp;this mistake have demonstrated a not less peculiar history.&nbsp;The precise truth was first made known by Dr Fermin,&nbsp;who had an opportunity, during his residence at Surinam,&nbsp;to investigate the creature’s structure in a more satisfactory&nbsp;manner than had previously been practicable. His account&nbsp;is, that the female Pipa spawns at the brink of some stagnant water, and that the male immediately collects and&nbsp;amasses the heap of ova, and after impregnation </span><span class="font3">■</span><span class="font1"> deposits&nbsp;them with great care on the back of the female, where they&nbsp;are received into cellules which at this period are open&nbsp;for their reception, but speedily close upon them. They&nbsp;are there retained to the time of their second birth, which&nbsp;happens in somewhat less than three months. During this&nbsp;period the cells gradually enlarge, till the young emerge&nbsp;from the back of the parent in a completely formed state.&nbsp;During the time of their concealment, however, they undergo the usual change which is effected upon tlleir congeners,&nbsp;being first hatched from the ova in the form of a tadpole ;&nbsp;and then, after gradually acquiring their perfect shape,&nbsp;losing their tail, and so forth, they are extruded from the&nbsp;cellules. This strange process has since been examined&nbsp;and verified by Camper, Spallanzani, Blumenbach, and other&nbsp;naturalists, and is now established as a phenomenon equally&nbsp;true as extraordinary. Fermin found the brood he observed amount to seventy-five, and the period of their extrusion&nbsp;as young Pipas occupied five days. When they had made&nbsp;their escape, the female, having rubbed the epidermis from&nbsp;her back on some hard substance, returned to land. This</span></p>
