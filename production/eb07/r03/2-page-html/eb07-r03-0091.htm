<p><span class="font1">RUTH, a canonical book of the Old Testament, being </span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1"> a kind of appendage to the book of Judges, and an intro- :&nbsp;duction to those of Samuel, and having its title from the&nbsp;person whose story is there principally related. In this story&nbsp;are observable the ancient rights of kindred and redemption ; and the manner of buying the inheritance of the deceased, with other particulars of great note and antiquity.&nbsp;The canonicalness of this book was never disputed ; but&nbsp;the learned are not agreed about the epoch of the history&nbsp;which it relates. Ruth the Moabitcss is found in the genealogy of our Saviour. (Matt. i. 5.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUTHERGLEN, or by contraction Rugi.en, the head burgh of the nether ward of Lanarkshire, in Scotland, is&nbsp;situated about two miles south-east of Glasgow, and nine&nbsp;west of Hamilton. Few towns in Scotland can lay claim to&nbsp;greater antiquity than Rutherglen. It was erected into a&nbsp;royal burgh by King David I. about the year 1126.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The territory under the jurisdiction of the burgh was extensive, and the inhabitants enjoyed many distinguished&nbsp;privileges, which were, however, gradually wrested from&nbsp;them by political influence in favour of Glasgow, which in&nbsp;latter times rose into consequence by trade and manufactures. The ancient dimensions of the place are now unknown ; but in the fields and gardens towards the east, the&nbsp;foundations of houses are occasionally discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About a hundred and fifty yards to the south of the main street is a kind of lane, known by the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dins-dykes.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">This place has acquired an opprobrious celebrity, from the&nbsp;circumstance which befell the unfortunate Queen Mary when&nbsp;her forces were routed at the battle of Langside. Her majesty, who, during the battle, stood on a rising ground about&nbsp;a mile from Rutherglen, no sooner saw her army defeated,&nbsp;than she took her precipitate flight to the south. Dins-dykes unluckily lay in her way. Two rustics, who were at&nbsp;that instant cutting grass hard&quot; by, seeing her majesty flying&nbsp;in haste, rudely attempted to intercept her, and threatened&nbsp;to cut her in pieces with their scythes if she presumed to&nbsp;proceed a step further. Neither beauty nor royalty would&nbsp;have secured her escape, had not some of her followers come&nbsp;to her relief.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Adjoining to a lane called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bach-row</span><span class="font1"> stood the castle of Rutherglen, originally built at a period coeval, it is reported, with the foundation of the town. This ancient fortress underwent several sieges during the unhappy wars in&nbsp;the days of King Robert Bruce, and it remained a place of&nbsp;strength until the battle of Langside ; soon after which it&nbsp;was destroyed by order of the regent, to revenge himself on&nbsp;the Hamilton family, in whose custody it then was. The&nbsp;foundations of the buildings are now erased, and the site&nbsp;converted into dwelling-houses and gardens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rutherglen, in conjunction with Renfrew, Dumbarton, Kilmarnock, and Port-Glasgow, sends a member to the British parliament. The fairs of this town are generally well&nbsp;attended, and have long been famous for a great show of&nbsp;horses, of the Lanarkshire breed, which are esteemed the&nbsp;best draught-horses in Britain. The inhabitants of this&nbsp;borough still retain some customs of a very remote antiquity. One of these is the making of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rutherglen sour cakes.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The operation is attended with some peculiar rites, which&nbsp;lead us to conclude that the practice is of Pagan origin. In</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">1821 the population of Rutherglen was about 1800, and including the parish it was 4640 ; in 1831 that of the town&nbsp;and parish was 5503.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUTHIN, a borough and market town of the county of Denbigh, within the parish of Ruabon. It was formerly&nbsp;surrounded with walls, which are dilapidated ; but it now&nbsp;consists of only one long street. It ls governed by four&nbsp;aldermen and twelve councillors. There are markets,&nbsp;which are held on Mondays and Saturdays. The population&nbsp;amounted in 1801 to 1115, in 1811 to 1292, in 1821 to 1294,&nbsp;and in 1831 to 3376. The apparent increase on the last&nbsp;census arises from the parish of Llanfurog being then, but&nbsp;not before, included in that of the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUTLAMGUR, a town of Hindustan, in the Mahratta territories, and province of Malwah, forty-seven miles north-north-west from Oojain. Long. 75. 26. E. Lat. 28. 46. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUTLANDSHIRE, an English county, nearly in the centre of the kingdom, and the smallest of all the divisions&nbsp;so denominated. It is bounded by Lincolnshire on the&nbsp;east and north-east, by Leicestershire on the north-west&nbsp;and west, and by Northamptonshire on the south. Its&nbsp;length from north to south is sixteen, and its breadth from&nbsp;east to west is twelve miles. The square contents are&nbsp;149 square statute miles, or 95,360 acres. It is divided&nbsp;into five hundreds, and contains two market-towns, Uppingham and Okeham, and forty-nine parishes ; being a greater&nbsp;number, in proportion to its extent, than any other county&nbsp;in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It gives only one title at present, that of duke, to the family of Manners ; two former peerages, that of Ferrars&nbsp;of Okeham, and Noel of Exton, being extinct. Only two&nbsp;members are returned to the House of Commons from the&nbsp;county, and none from either of the towns. In judicial affairs it is on the midland circuit of the judges ; and in'ec-clesiastical matters it has formed, since the year 1541, a&nbsp;portion of the bishopric of Peterborough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The appearance of this small county is pleasing to the traveller. It is much diversified by ranges of moderate&nbsp;hills running from east to west, in some parts well timbered. Betw<sup>r</sup>een these ranges of hills, the valleys, of about&nbsp;half a mile in breadth, are luxuriant and verdant. The&nbsp;principal vale, called Catmose, is in the centre of the county,&nbsp;having to the north a tract of table-land overlooking the&nbsp;well-wooded plains of Leicester, Lincoln, and Nottinghamshire. The eastern part is more diversified ; the southern&nbsp;division of it consisting of a beautiful valley, stretching towards Northamptonshire, and the western, bordering on&nbsp;Leicestershire; being abundantly wooded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The soil on the eastern and south-eastern parts is chiefly shallow, resting upon a basis of limestone, composed of clays&nbsp;and loams. The other parts consist principally of a tenacious but fertile loam ; but the vale of Catmose enjoys a&nbsp;most fertile soil of good clay, or red loam, or a grateful&nbsp;mixture of both these earths. A peculiarity of the soil is&nbsp;a redness, which generally prevails, and which tinges all the&nbsp;waters of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr Parkinson, surveyor for the Board of Agriculture, estimates the land of the county in the following manner, viz. pasture land, 34,861 acres; arable land, 42,536; wastes,&nbsp;30; woods, 2815 ; meadows, 9356; commons, 693; plantations, 65 ; lakes and ponds, 44 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The woods of this county were far more extensive in former ages than they are at present. The ancient forest&nbsp;of Leafield, and the chase of Beaumont, though now<sup>r</sup> under&nbsp;the plough, once occupied a great portion of the surface.&nbsp;The climate is generally accounted peculiarly soft and&nbsp;healthy ; and the elevation is of that medium kind which&nbsp;equally exempts it from the pernicious effects of moist ex-, halations and cold mountain fogs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The agriculture, though it has partaken of some modern , improvements, is not, upon the whole, conducted in the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
