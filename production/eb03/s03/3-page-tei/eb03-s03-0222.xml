We learn from doomſday-book, that at that time, when a widow of this town married, ſhe paid 20 ſhillings to the king, and a virgin 10. The above-mentioned Roger founded alſo, and endowed here, a Benedictine monastery and a collegiate church. When old age came upon him, he quitted the world, and ſpent the rest of his days as a monk in the abbey, and when he died was interred in its church. From the hiſtory of this church and monaſtery, it appears, that eccleſiaſtical benefices about that time were hereditary. The abbey became so rich afterwards, that the abbot was mitred, and sat in parliament. Beſides this abbey, in after times there were three others, viz. a Eranciſcan, Dominican, and Auguſtin, and likewiſe two collegiate churches ; one dedicated to St Chad and the other to St Mary. In the conteſt between the empreſs Maud and Stephen, this town, and its governor William Fitz-Allan, ſided with the empreſs. In Henry III.’s time, a part of it was burnt down by the Welch ; and in Richard II.'s reign a parliament was held in it. At a place called <hi rend="italic">Battlefield,</hi> near this town, Henry Percy the younger, ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">Hotſpur, </hi>was killed in an engagement with Henry IV. againſt whom he had rebelled. The king afterwards built a chapel upon the ſpot, and endowed it ſor the support of two prieſts to pray for the souls of the ſlain. Two of Edw. IV.’s ſons were born here ; namely, Richard, duke of York, whom Perkin Warbeck afterwards personated, and who was murdered in the Tower; and George Plantagenet, who died before his brothers. Here firſt broke out the ſweating-ſickneſs, which carried off great numbers ſo ſuddenly, that thoſe who were ſeized with it either died or recovered in the ſpace of 24 hours. In the beginning of the civil wars, king Charles I. came hither, and formed an army, with which he marched towards London ; but was met by the parliament’s forces at Edgehill. He continued here from the 20th of September to the 12th of October, during which time he was joined by prince Rupert, and many of the gentry and nobility of theſe parts. This town anciently gave title of earl to the Montgomeries, and afterwards to the Talbots, by whom it is ſtill retained. Here is a free grammar-school, with three masters, and ſeveral uſhers, well endowed by Edward VI. and queen Elizabeth, and not inferior to many colleges in the universities. It has a good library and chapel, and there are ſeveral ſcholarships appropriated to it in the univerſity of Cambridge. Here are also ſeveral hospitals, alms-houses, and charity-ſchools. This town is one of the moſt flouriſhing in England, having two great weekly markets for corn, cattle, and proviſions ; and another for Welch cottons and flannels, of which great quantities are sold. A great trade is carried on with the Welch, who bring their commodities hither, as to the common mart of both nations. The town is large and well-built, and the ſituation extremely pleaſant. There is a very beautiful walk called the <hi rend="italic">quarry,</hi> between the town walls and the Severn, delightfully shaded with rows of lime-trees, ſo that it is not inferior to the Mall in St James’s Park. The town is alſo noted ſor its gallantry and politeneſs, being full of gentry, for whom there are always balls and asſemblies once a-week all the year round.— Here is a fine houſe and gardens, which belonged to the earl of Bradford ; and in the neighbourhood, at Wroxeter, the Roman highway, called Watling-ſtreet,</p><p>may be ſeen for ſeveral miles, where Roman coins are frequently found. In Shrewſhury are 12 incorporated trading companies ; and the corporation has a power to try even capital cauſes of itſelf, except high treaſon. It is ſaid that thigh-hones of dead men have been found here a yard long, and teeth three inches round and three long.</p><p>SHRIKE.

Its length is between 49 and 50 miles, its breadth about 38, and its circumference about 210. It is an inland county, containing 890,000 acres, 113,680 inhabitants, and 15 hundreds, in which are 170 parishes, and 15 market towns. It makes a part of three biſhoprics, viz. Hereford, Coventry and Litchfield, and St Aſaph. Some part of it lies on the north, and ſome on the ſouth side of the Severn. Beſides the Severn, it is alſo watered by the <hi rend="italic">Temd</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tefidiauc,</hi> as it is called in Welch, which flows from the mountains of Radnorſhire ; and by the Tern, which has its riſe and name from one of thoſe pools called <hi rend="italic">tearnes,</hi> in Staffordshire. All theſe abound with fiſh, eſpecially trouts, pikes, lampreys, graylings, carp, and eels. The air, especially upon the hills, with which the county abounds, is very wholesome. There is as great a diversity of soil as in moſt other counties. On the hills, where it is poor, is very good paſture for ſheep ; and in the low grounds, where it is very rich, along the Severn in particular, there is plenty of graſs for hay and black cattle, with all sorts of corn. No county is better provided with fuel than this, having in it many inexhauſtible pits of coal, and alſo mines of lead and iron. Over moſt of the coal-pits in this county lies a ſtratum or layer of blackiſh porous rock, of which, by grinding and boiling, they make pitch and tar, which are rather better than the common sort for caulking ships, as they do not crack, but always continue close and ſmooth. Quarries of lime-ſtone and iron-ſtone are common enough in the county, and the ſoil in many places is a reddiſh clay. As it lies upon the borders of Wales, it was anciently full of caſtles and walled towns. On the side next that country there was an almoſt continued line of caſtles, to guard the county againſt the inroads and depredations of the Welch. The borders here, as thoſe between England and Scotland, were called <hi rend="italic">marches,</hi> and there were certain noblemen intitled <hi rend="italic">barones marchie, marchiones de marchia Walliae,</hi> “ lords of the marches, or marquisses of the marches of Wales,” who were veſted with a fort of palatine juriſdiction, held courts of juſtice to determine controverſies, and enjoyed many privileges and immunities, the better to enable and encourage them to protect the county againſt the incurſions of the Welch, and to maintain order amongſt the borderers ; but they often abuſed their power, and were the greateſt of tyrants.</p><p>As to the eccleſiaſtical government of the county, the far greater part, namely, all that belongs to the biſhoprics of Hereford, and of Litchfield and Coventry,</p></body></text></TEI>
