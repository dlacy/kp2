A dismantled fort built by the Egyptians (who occupied the place between 1875 and 1884) is the most prominent object. In January 1889 Sagallo was occupied by a Cossack chief named Achinov, who was accompanied by the archimandrite Païsi and some 200 people, including priests, women and children. Païsi had been entrusted by the metropolitan of Novgorod with an evangelistic mission to the Abyssinian Church; while Achinov stated that he had a commission from the Negus for the purchase of arms and ammunition. The presence of Achinov at Sagallo (where he occupied the fort, which he found deserted) was regarded by the French government as an invasion of French territorial rights. The Russian foreign office having disavowed (7th of February) any connexion with Achinov, instructions were sent from Paris to secure the removal of the Cossacks. On the 17th of February French warships appeared off the port, and an ultimatum was sent to Achinov calling on him to surrender, but without effect. The fort was bombarded, and seven persons killed, two being women and four children. The Cossacks then surrendered, not having fired a shot. They were subsequently deported to Suez, whence they returned to Russia. Achinov was interned by the Russian government for some months (until October 1889). In 1891 he returned to Abyssinia. Païsi was promoted by his ecclesiastical superiors. In Paris the incident caused great excitement amongst the Russophils, and the consequent demonstrations led to the suppression of the League of Patriots and the prosecution of M. Paul Déroulède.</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">L'Archimandrite Païsi et l'Ataman Achinoff,</hi> by vicomte de Constantin (Paris, 1891).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
