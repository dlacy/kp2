<p><span class="font0">rifle with metallic cartridge-case, which secured the perfect obturation of the breech. The Snider breech was a hinged&nbsp;block, a type much in favour at the time. The French similarly converted their muzzle-loaders, the converted weapon&nbsp;being known as the Tabatière or snuff-box. Other breech&nbsp;actions on the same principle were the Austrian Werndl and the&nbsp;Bavarian Podewils and Werder rifles. But these were only&nbsp;transitional arms. In 1866 France adopted the bolt-action&nbsp;Chassepdt </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> in 1867 Sweden the Hagström, and Russia the&nbsp;Carte; in 1868 Italy the Carcano. All these were breechloaders firing paper cartridges containing their own means of&nbsp;ignition. After further experiments by a fresh committee the&nbsp;AIartini-Henry rifle (fig. 2) was definitely adopted by the British Government in 1871, with the short chamber Boxer-Henry&nbsp;ammunition. This rifle was a combination of Martini’s block action&nbsp; breech mechanism with Henry’s barrel of 45-in. calibre,&nbsp;firing a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">papered</span><span class="font0"> bullet of 480 grains from Boxer cases with a wad&nbsp;of wax lubrication at base of bullet, as proposed by Henry.&nbsp;The Henry rifling had seven grooves with one turn in 22 in.;&nbsp;the lands and the centres of the grooves were contained in the&nbsp;same circle. About the same time or a little later the various&nbsp;powers re-armed their infantry with breech-loaders of different&nbsp;patternsandnames, all of which were of about it mm. (433 in.)&nbsp;calibre, and nearly all of the bolt-action type.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next stage in the history of military firearms was the introduction of the repeating or magazine system. The&nbsp;Winchester rifle, an American invention which appeared in&nbsp;1865, was one of the earliest magazine rifles. This weapon was&nbsp;used by Turkey to some extent in the Russo-Turkish War of&nbsp;1877-78, but Germany was the first great power to provide its&nbsp;army with a magazine rifle. In 1884 it converted the 1871&nbsp;pattern Mauserof 443-in. bore into a magazine rifle, holding eight&nbsp;cartridges in a tube magazine in the fore end. In 1885 France&nbsp;followed with the Lebel, which had an enormous advantage in&nbsp;its smokeless powder. In 1886 the question of the best calibre&nbsp;for small arms was reopened in England. In this year, 1886,&nbsp;Austria had adopted a Mannlicher rifle, 433 bore, with a straight-pull bolt. This rifle was the first adopted by any European&nbsp;nation embodying Lee’s box magazine, an invention patented&nbsp;in 1879 and 1882, and consisting of a box, in rear of and below&nbsp;the entrance to the chamber, containing the cartridges. Another</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">important improvement, the steel clip loader containing five cartridges, was also introduced with this rifle. In 1888 these&nbsp;rifles were converted to .315 bore, firing black powder cartridges;&nbsp;and in 1890, on the introduction of smokeless powder, the sights&nbsp;were re-graduated. In 1887 the British SmallArms Committee,&nbsp;after experiments with the small-calibre rifle invented in 1883&nbsp;by the Swiss Major Rubin, director of the Federal laboratory&nbsp;at Thun, recommended the small calibre for adoption into the&nbsp;British service. The essential features of Rubin’s system were&nbsp;the employment of a compound bullet with a leaden core in a&nbsp;copper envelope, and the use of a compressed charge of black&nbsp;powder. In 1888 a pattern of 303-01. calibre rifle, rifled on&nbsp;the Metford system and with the improved Lee bolt and magazine, was approved for trial by British troops. The Metford&nbsp;rifling is as follows:—diameter of bore, 30310.; depth of rifling,&nbsp;004 in.; width of lands, -023 in.; twist of rifling, one turn in&nbsp;to in. (left-hand); radial grooves, seven in number. About 1862,&nbsp;and later, W. E. Metford had carried out an exhaustive series of&nbsp;experiments on bullets and rifling. He invented the important&nbsp;system of light rifling, with increasing spiral with a hardened&nbsp;bullet. The Metford match rifle was prominent in all N.R.A.&nbsp;competitions from 1871 to 1894. In 1887 he laid down for&nbsp;the Small Arms Committee the proper proportions for the&nbsp;grooving, spiral and cartridge chamber of the 303 military&nbsp;rifle. This weapon proved satisfactory and was adopted by the&nbsp;War Office as the Lee-Metford rifle, AIark I., in December 1888.&nbsp;It had a magazine of eight cartridges. In 1891 the Alark II.&nbsp;pattern was approved, with a ten-cartridge magazine, a simplified bolt, and many minor improvements. A magazine carbine&nbsp;with barrel 2r in. long and a six-cartridge magazine, otherwise&nbsp;identical with the Lee-Metford Mark II., was also approved.&nbsp;The Lee-Metford Mark II. rifle was subsequently further improved in its rifling to resist the wear of smokeless powder, and&nbsp;also in its bolt action, and became known as the Lee-Enfield&nbsp;rifle, and under that name was officially adopted as the rifle of&nbsp;the British army. The number of grooves were reduced from&nbsp;seven to five. Neither the Lee-Aletford nor the Lee-Enfield&nbsp;has increasing spiral grooves, which are found inconvenient for&nbsp;military arms from a manufacturing point of view@@<sup>1</sup> The L.AI.&nbsp;and L.E. carbines are similar to the shorter models of the&nbsp;rifles, but are covered for the whole length of the barrel by a&nbsp;wooden handguard and take only six cartridges; the fore-sights&nbsp;are protected by wings on the nose-cap, and the long-range&nbsp;sights are omitted. These, as also the Alartini-Metford and&nbsp;AIartini-Enfield carbines (falling-block action small-bores), have&nbsp;practically been replaced by the “short” rifle described below.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The efficiency of the modem small-bore magazine rifle is largely due to the production of smokeless nitro-compound&nbsp;powder. France was the first country to adopt, about 1885, a&nbsp;smokeless powder with the Lebel magazine rifle. It was known&nbsp;as “ Vieille ” powder, or “ Poudre B ” (after General Boulanger).&nbsp;Since then smokeless explosives have been universally adopted&nbsp;in all small-bore magazine military rifles. The smokeless&nbsp;explosive known as “ Cordite ’’or“ Cordite Al.D.” (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cordiie)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is used for the cartridges of the Lee-Aletford and Lee-Enfield&nbsp;rifles and rifle-calibre machine guns.(H. S.-K.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Military Rifles of To-day.</span><span class="font0">—About 1900, the various armies were equipped with weapons of nearly equal efficiency. The&nbsp;weights varied between 8} and 9J lb, the lengths between&nbsp;49 and 52 in.; the calibres were 315, 311, 303, with one or&nbsp;two 256. None of the rifles were sighted to less than 2000 yds.,&nbsp;and nearly all had a “ fixed ” or “ battle ” sight. All were&nbsp;bolt-action rifles, and had a muzzle velocity of about 2000 f.s.&nbsp;(the -256 Mannlichers, about 2300 f.s.). Except France, with&nbsp;the tube-magazine Lebel, Denmark and the U.S.A. with the&nbsp;horizontal-box Krag-Jorgensen, and Great Britain, all nations&nbsp;used multiple-loading by clip or charger. With Lebel and&nbsp;Krag-Jorgensen weapons, multiple-loading is a practical impossibility, but in Great Britain the charger was deliberately rejected. It was desired to use the rifle normally as a</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
