        <p><span class="font1">of the inhabitants. He estimates the number of children receiving a
                home education at 597,424 individuals, which&nbsp;would give to Russia one pupil
                enjoying education for every&nbsp;fifty of the inhabitants. According to M.
                Ouvaroff's last&nbsp;report, this proportion had in 1837 become one in forty-five.
                The data upon which both the minister and Krusenstern make their calculations are
                very problematical. We&nbsp;greatly doubt if the proportion is so high as it is here
                given.&nbsp;Mr Bremner states@@<sup>1</sup> that “ popular education is
                advancing&nbsp;but slowly ; for in many of the governments of the interior, out of
                every four or five hundred of the population,&nbsp;there is not more than
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font1">
                young person attending school.&nbsp;The educational schemes of the government have
                hitherto&nbsp;been unsuccessful in the provinces, because the people,&nbsp;being
                ignorant of the value of instruction, seldom think of&nbsp;sending their children to
                school. In the large cities, however, public seminaries are most successfully
                conducted and&nbsp;numerously attended.” With regard to the provinces, considering
                the character both of the country and of the peasantry, we think that there may be
                some truth in Mr Bremner’s statement ; but it cannot be of very extensive
                application, the discrepancy being so great between it and those&nbsp;of the
                individuals mentioned.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1"> Independently of the institutions occupied directly in the education
                of youth, Russia has further her academies of&nbsp;science, her learned societies,
                her public libraries, and her&nbsp;museums. The number of scientific establishments
                in St&nbsp;Petersburg is very great ; and the merits of the Imperial&nbsp;Academy of
                Sciences, in relation to its mathematical, astronomical, mineralogical, and
                geographical labours, are incontestable. The universities of Moscow and Dorpat are
                also&nbsp;highly celebrated. The institution last named would appear&nbsp;to be the
                most prosperous of all the universities in Russia,&nbsp;many of its professors, such
                as Struve the astronomer, Parrot the traveller, and others, being men of great
                eminence&nbsp;in the scientific world. Of the Russian libraries, that of
                St&nbsp;Petersburg is the richest and most considerable, containing 413,000 volumes.
                After it rank the Hermitage Library,&nbsp;consisting of 100,000 volumes ; the
                library, of the Academy&nbsp;of Sciences, 90,000 volumes; and those belonging to
                the&nbsp;universities of Dorpat, Moscow, Kief, Kazan, Kharkov, and&nbsp;St
                Petersburg, each being highly respectable, as w ill be&nbsp;seen from a table
                already given. In 1837, the total amount&nbsp;of books in the public libraries of
                Russia amounted to&nbsp;858,635 volumes. It ought to be mentioned, however,
                that&nbsp;about two thirds of the scientific and literary treasure of&nbsp;Russia
                have been plundered from unhappy Poland. The number of literary and scientific
                institutions throughout the empire, including several purely philanthropic
                associations, may&nbsp;be estimated at fifty, of which twenty belong to St
                Petersburg alone.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In Russia proper, the owners of estates are under obligations to
                provide their peasantry w’ith the means of support, and in times of distress to
                relieve them. On the estates&nbsp;belonging to the crown, a methodical system of
                parochial&nbsp;relief is established, each parish being compelled to supply&nbsp;its
                destitute poor, in poor-houses, with fuel, food, and clothing. In Courland,
                Esthonia, and Livonia, a similar compulsory system is established, the landowners
                and farmers&nbsp;contributing in proportion to their occupations or rental,&nbsp;and
                the overseers being elected by the rate-payers. Public&nbsp;begging is forbidden,
                and vagrants set to work by the overseers. Even in Siberia the authorities are under
                legal obligation to prevent any individual of the people committed&nbsp;to their
                charge from suffering want, or remaining without&nbsp;assistance when in distress.
                In the Russo-Polish provinces&nbsp;a similar system prevails as in Russia
                proper.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The productions of the Russian press are no index to the national
                cultivation. Amongst the great body of the&nbsp;people there is little or no taste
                for literature. It is only&nbsp;amongst the higher classes that any thing like a
                reading public is to be found ; so that it may well be believed native&nbsp;authors,
                or translators of foreign literature, have little encouragement held out to them, at
                least of a public nature.&nbsp;It redounds, however, to the credit of the late
                sovereigns of&nbsp;Russia, and the more wealthy of the nobles, that they
                have&nbsp;done much to foster Russian literature, by the munificent favours which
                they have bestowed on native writers. But that&nbsp;ready market, a large and
                intelligent reading community, is&nbsp;alone calculated to draw forth to any great
                extent the talents&nbsp;and the genius of native writers, and to promote the
                interests of literature. Thus, although many eminent men have&nbsp;appeared in
                Russia as authors, such as Lomonoscoff, Mura-vieff, Karamzin, Pouschkin (a
                celebrated poet, who perished&nbsp;in a duel in the flower of his age, February
                1837), and some&nbsp;others, its literature is yet in an infant or imitative
                state.&nbsp;The greater number of the books that are published are&nbsp;translations
                from the German and French, and their circulation is limited. Karamzin’s History of
                Russia, the most&nbsp;popular work ever published in that country, and said to
                be&nbsp;the one most widely circulated, sold only to the extent of&nbsp;1500 copies
                in two editions. In the Russian empire are&nbsp;published eighty papers and minor
                periodicals, and about&nbsp;twelve scientific and literary journals. Of course,
                nothing&nbsp;like the liberty of the press is known in Russia. Indeed&nbsp;there
                cannot be said to exist a press at all in the common&nbsp;acceptation of the term,
                as the newspapers are published by&nbsp;the government, and no periodical literature
                of a political&nbsp;character exists in the Russian language. In 1837, the printing
                establishments in the empire were 171, of which ninety-four were maintained by
                government, and seventy-seven by&nbsp;private persons. There were seventy-four
                lithographic establishments, nine of which were supported by government.&nbsp;A
                strict censorship of the press has been instituted, and its&nbsp;jealous vigilance
                is particularly directed to English newspapers, all but the </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Post</span><span class="font1">
                being absolutely prohibited from entering the capital. The censorships of the
                press&nbsp;are conducted according to the precepts of a new regulation,&nbsp;which
                is due to the solicitude of the Emperor Nicholas, and&nbsp;was issued in 1828. In
                university towns it is intrusted to&nbsp;committees, and everywhere else committed
                to censors appointed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ad
                hoc.</span><span class="font1"> The censorship of works relating to
                religion&nbsp;rests with the ecclesiastical authorities. Every book hostile&nbsp;to
                the creed of the Greek church, to monarchical or autocratical authority, to decency,
                to morality, to the honour of individuals, is prohibited. The first duty of the
                censors in examining a book, is “ to consider what is the object that
                the&nbsp;author has proposed to himself.” These rules apply alike to&nbsp;national
                and to foreign Works. Literary property is a vested&nbsp;interest during the life of
                the author, and for twenty-five&nbsp;years after his death. Literary piracy is
                punished by a fine&nbsp;equivalent to double the cost of an edition of twelve
                hundred&nbsp;copies. In 1835, seven hundred and eight works were printed in Russia,
                and three thousand foreign volumes were imported. Mr Bremner informs us, that in
                spite of all restrictions, “ Russian literature is advancing with great
                rapidity.”</span></p>
