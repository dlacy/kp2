<p><span class="font0">permanency in an uniform ſoil neceſſarily ſuppoſes. Reaſoning after the ſame manner for all the portions&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c d<sub>i</sub> b c, a b, s a,</span><span class="font0"> we ſee that the regimen will be ſucceſſively eſtabliſhed in them, and that the ſlope neceſſary&nbsp;for this purpoſe will be greater as we approach the river head. The vertical ſection or profile of the courſe&nbsp;of the river </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sabedeſ</span><span class="font0"> will therefore reſemble the line&nbsp;SABCDEF which is ſhetehed below, having its different parts variouſly inclined to the horizontal line&nbsp;HF.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such is the proceſs of nature to be obſerved in every river on the ſurface of the globe. It long appeared a&nbsp;kind of puzzle to the theoriſts ; and it was this obſer-vation of the increaſing, or at leaſt this continued velocity with ſmaller ſlope, as the rivers increaſed by the&nbsp;addition of their tributary ſtreams, which cauſed Gu-glielmini to have recourſe to his new principle, the energy of deep waters. We have now ſeen in what this&nbsp;energy conſiſts. It is only a greater quantity of motion remaining in the middle of a great ſtream of water after a quantity has been retarded by the ſides and&nbsp;bottom ; and we ſee clearly, that ſince the addition of&nbsp;a new and perhaps an equal ſtream does not occupy a ∙&nbsp;bed of double ſurface, the proportion of the retardations to tire remaining motion muſt continually diminiſh&nbsp;as a river increaſes by the addition of new ſtreams. If&nbsp;therefore the ſlope were not diminiſhed, the regimen&nbsp;would be deſtroyed, and the river would dig up its channel. We have a full confirmation of this in the many&nbsp;works which have been executed on the Po, which runs&nbsp;with rapidity through a rich and yielding ſoil. About&nbsp;the year' 16oo, the waters of the Panaro, a very conſiderable river, were added to the Po Grande ; and although it brings along with it in its freſhes a vaſt quantity of fand and mud, it has'greatly deepened the whole&nbsp;Tronco di Venezia from the confluence to the ſea.&nbsp;This point was clearly aſcertained by Manfredi about&nbsp;the 1720, when the inhabitants of the valleys adjacent&nbsp;were alarmed by the project of bringing in the waters,&nbsp;of the Rheno, which then ran through the Ferrareſe.&nbsp;Their fears were overcome, and the Pυ Grande continues to deepen its channel every day with a prodigious&nbsp;advantage to the navigations ; and there are ſeveral ex-tenlive marſhes which now drain off by it, after having&nbsp;been for ages under water : and it is to be particularly&nbsp;remarked, that the Rheno is the fouleſt river in its&nbsp;freſhes of any in that country. We inſert this remark,&nbsp;becauſe it may be of great practical utility, as pointing&nbsp;out a method of preſerving and even improving tire&nbsp;depth of rivers or drains in flat countries, which is not&nbsp;obvious, and rather appears improper : but it is ſtrictly&nbsp;conformable to a true theory, and to the operations of&nbsp;nature, which never fails to adjuſt every thing ſo as to&nbsp;bring about an equilibrium. Whatever the declivity of&nbsp;the country may have been originally, the regimen begins to be ſettled at the mouths of the rivers, and the&nbsp;Hopes are diminiſhed in ſucceſſion as we recede from the&nbsp;coaſt. The original ſlopcs inland may have been much&nbsp;greater; but they will (when buſy nature has completed her work) be left ſomewhat, and only ſo much&nbsp;greater, that the velocity may be the ſame notwithſtaiid-ing the diminution of the ſection and mean depth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Freſhes will diſturb this methodical progreſs relative only to the ſucceſſive permanent additions ; but their&nbsp;effects chiefly accelerate the deepening of the bed, and</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">the diminution of the ſlope, by augmenting the velocity during their continuance. But when the regimen of the permanent additions is once eſtabliſhed, the freſhes&nbsp;tend chiefly to widen the bed, without greatly deepening it : for the aquatic plants, which have been growing&nbsp;and thriving during the peaceable ſtate of the river, are&nbsp;now laid along, but not ſwept away, by the freſhes&nbsp;and protect the bottom from their attacks ; and the&nbsp;ſtones and gravel, which muſt hâve been left bare in a&nbsp;courſe of years, working on the ſoil, will alſo collect in&nbsp;the bottom, and greatly augment its power of reſiſtance ; and even if the floods ſhould have deepened the&nbsp;bottom ſome ſmall matter, ſome mud will be depoſited&nbsp;as the velocity of the freſhes diminiſhes, and this will&nbsp;remain till the next flood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have ſuppoſedthe ſoil uniform through the wholc courſe : This ſeldom happens ; therefore the circum-ſtances which inſure permanency, or the regimen of a&nbsp;river, may be very different in its different parts and&nbsp;in different rivers. We may ſay in general, that the&nbsp;farther that the regimen has advanced up the ſtream in&nbsp;any river, the more ſlowly will it convey its waters to&nbsp;the ſea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are ſome general circumſtances in the motion of rivers which it will be proper to take notice of juſt&nbsp;now, that they may not interrupt our more minute examination of their mechaniſm, and their explanations&nbsp;will then occur of themſelves as corollaries of the proposions which we ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In a valley of ſmall width the river always occupies the loweſt part of it ; and it is obſerved, that this is ſeldom&nbsp;in the middle of the valley, and is neareſt to that ſide&nbsp;on which the ſlope from the higher grounds is ſteepeſt/&nbsp;and this without regard to the line of its courſe. The&nbsp;river generally adheres to the ſteepeſt hills, whether&nbsp;they advance into the plaiu or retire ſrom it. This&nbsp;general feature may be obſerved over the whole globe.&nbsp;It is divided into copartments by great ranges of moιiu-tains ; and it may be obſerved, that the great rivers hold&nbsp;their courſe not very far from them, and that their chief&nbsp;feeders come ſrom the other ſide. In every copàrtment&nbsp;there is a ſwell of the low<sup>r</sup> country at a diſtance from&nbsp;the bounding ridge of mountains ; and on the ſummit&nbsp;of this ſwell the principal feeders of the great river have&nbsp;their ſources.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">valley</span><span class="font0"> is given with leſs propriety to theſe immenſe regions, and is more applicable to tracks of&nbsp;champaign land which the eye can take in at one view.&nbsp;Even here we may obſerve a reſemblance. It is not&nbsp;always in the very loweſt part of this valley that the&nbsp;river has its bed ; although the waters of the river flow&nbsp;in a channel below its immediate banks, theſe banks are&nbsp;frequently higher than the grounds at the foot of the&nbsp;hills. This is very diſtinctly ſeen in Lower Egypt, by&nbsp;means of the canals which are carried backward from&nbsp;the Nile for accelerating its fertilizing inundations;&nbsp;When the caliſhes are opened to admit the waters, it </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">is&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">always obſerved that the diſtricts moſt remote are the&nbsp;firſt covered, and it is ſeveral days before the immediately adjoining fields partake of the bleſſing. This is a&nbsp;conſequence of that general operation of nature by&nbsp;which the valleys are formed. The river in its floods&nbsp;is loaded with mud, which it retains as long as it&nbsp;rolls rapidly along its limited bed, tumbling its w<sup>τ</sup>aters&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">over and over, and taking up in every ſpot as </span><span class="font0">much as</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
