<p><span class="font0">each petal so that there are ten in each row; a second row of ten alternates with the first, a third with the second, and so on. By&nbsp;repeated radial and tangential branching a vast number of stamens&nbsp;are ultimately produced, and when these stamens assume a petaloid&nbsp;aspect we have as a consequence the double flowers which are so&nbsp;much admired. The carpels are much less subject to this petaloid&nbsp;change, and, as it generally happens in the most double of roses&nbsp;that some few at least of the anthers are formed with pollen, the&nbsp;production of seed and the possibility of cross-breeding become&nbsp;intelligible. Under natural circumstances rose flowers do not&nbsp;secrete honey, the attraction for insects being provided bv the colour&nbsp;and perfume and the abundance of pollen for food. I he stigmas&nbsp;and anthers come to maturity at the same time, and thus, while&nbsp;cross-fertilization by insect agency is doubtless most common,&nbsp;self-fertilization is not prevented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The large number of species, subspecies, varieties and forms described as British may be included under about a dozen&nbsp;species. Among them may be mentioned 2?. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">spinosissima,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the Scotch rose, much less variable than the others; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. rubiginosa</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. eglantcria),</span><span class="font0"> the sweet-brier, represented by&nbsp;several varieties; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. canina</span><span class="font0">, the dog rose (see fig.)» including</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">numerous subspecies and varieties; the large-fruited apple rose,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. pomífera;</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. arvensis,</span><span class="font0"> the parent of the Ayrshire roses.&nbsp;Cultivated roses are frequently “ buddecj ” or worked upon the&nbsp;stems of the brier or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. canina,</span><span class="font0"> or upon young seedling plants&nbsp;of the same species; and upon stems of an Italian rose called&nbsp;the Manetti, raised in the Milan Botanic Gardens about 1837.&nbsp;Other species, notably </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. polyantha,</span><span class="font0"> also are used for stocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roses have been grown for so many centuries and have been crossed and recrossed so often that it is difficult to refer the&nbsp;cultivated forms to their wild prototypes. The older roses&nbsp;doubtless originated from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. gallica,</span><span class="font0"> a native of central and&nbsp;southern Europe. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. centifolia</span><span class="font0"> (the cabbage rose), a native of&nbsp;the Caucasus, contributed its share. A cross between the two&nbsp;species named.may have been the source whence originated&nbsp;the Bourbon roses. The yellow-flowered Austrian and Persian&nbsp;brier originated from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. lútea,</span><span class="font0"> a native of Austria and the East.&nbsp;The monthly or China roses sprang from the Chinese </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. Índica,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and these, crossed with others of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. centifolia</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gallica</span><span class="font0"> type,&nbsp;are the source of the <sup>a</sup> hybrid perpetuáis ” so commonly grown&nbsp;nowadays, because, in addition to their other attractions, their&nbsp;blooming season is relatively prolonged, and, moreover, is&nbsp;repeated in the autumn. Tea roses and noisettes, it is to&nbsp;be presumed, also acknowledge </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. indica</span><span class="font0"> as one of their progenitors.. A magnificent race called “hybrid teas” have&nbsp;been evolved of late years, by crossing the tea roses and hybrid&nbsp;perpetuáis. They are much more vigorous in constitution than&nbsp;the true tea roses, while quite as beautiful in blossom and more&nbsp;perpetual in bloom than the hybrid perpetuáis. Recently, by&nbsp;crossing the Japanese </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. Wichuraiana</span><span class="font0"> with hybrid perpetuáis,&nbsp;a beautiful and vigorous race of climbers has been produced.&nbsp;The Banksian rose is a Chinese ^limbing species, with small&nbsp;white or fawn-coloured flowers of great beauty, but rarely&nbsp;seen; the Macartney rose (2?. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bracteata)</span><span class="font0"> is also of Chinese&nbsp;origin. Its nearly evergreen deep green leaves and large white&nbsp;flowers are very striking. The Japanese </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. rugosa</span><span class="font0"> is also a&nbsp;remarkable species, notable for its bold rugose foliage, its large&nbsp;white or pink flowers, and its conspicuous globular fruit.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. damascena</span><span class="font0"> is cultivated in some parts of the Balkans for&nbsp;the purpose of making attar of roses. In Germany the same&nbsp;variety of rose is used, while at Grasse a strain of the&nbsp;Provence rose is cultivated for the same purpose. In India&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. damascena</span><span class="font0"> is grown largely near Ghazipur for the purpose&nbsp;of procuring attar of roses and rose water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rose water is chiefly produced in Europe from the Provence or cabbage rose, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. centifolia,</span><span class="font0"> grown for the purpose at Mitcham&nbsp;and much more abundantly in the south of-France. Conserve&nbsp;of roses and infusion of roses, two medicinal preparations retained for their agreeable qualities rather than for any special&nbsp;virtue, are prepared from the petals of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. gallica,</span><span class="font0"> one variety&nbsp;of which was formerly grown for the purpose near the town&nbsp;of Provins. Conserve of dog rose is made from the ripe hips&nbsp;of the dog rose, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. canina.</span><span class="font0"> Its only use is in the manufacture&nbsp;of pills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rose is so universal a favourite that some portion of the garden must necessarily be devoted to it, if the situation be at all&nbsp;favourable. Many choice roses will not, however, thrive in the&nbsp;vicinity of large towns, since they require a pure air, and do not&nbsp;endure a smoky atmosphere. The best, soil for them is a deep&nbsp;rich strong loam free from stagnant moisture. Very light sandy&nbsp;or gravelly soils, or soils which are clayey and badly drained, are&nbsp;not suitable, and both must be greatly improved if rose-growing&nbsp;on them is attempted. Light soils would be improved by a dressing&nbsp;of strong loam in conjunction with cow-dung or nightsoil; the latter,&nbsp;provided it is properly prepared and not too fresh, is indeed the&nbsp;very best manure for roses in all but soils which are naturally very&nbsp;rich. Heavy soils are improved by adding burned earth or gritty&nbsp;refuse, with stable manure and leaf-mould, peat moss litter, &amp;c. ;&nbsp;and damp soils must necessarily be drained by trenching. Tea&nbsp;roses may, however, be grown to perfection in a gravel soil, provided&nbsp;it be well manured, cow manure being best. Roses generally&nbsp;require a constant annual supply of manure, and, if this is given&nbsp;as a mulching in autumn, it serves to protect their roots through&nbsp;the winter. They also require liberal supplies of water during the&nbsp;growing season, unless the surface is mulched or top-dressed from&nbsp;time to time with well-rotted manure. Aphides and caterpillars&nbsp;of all kinds may be checked by syringing with dilute tobacco water&nbsp;or some of the many insecticides now provided to facilitate this&nbsp;rather troublesome task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some growers prefer roses grown on their own roots, some on the Manetti and others on the brier stock. There is this to be&nbsp;said in favour of their own roots that, if the tops are killed down by&nbsp;accident or by severe weather, the roots will usually throw up new&nbsp;shoots true to their kind, which cannot be looked for if they are&nbsp;worked ; though it is sometimes recommended to plant deep in order&nbsp;that the rose itself may learn to do without its foster parent the&nbsp;stock. Too often, however, in the case of persons unfamiliar with&nbsp;roses, the choice rose dies, and the stock usurps its place. This&nbsp;is especially true of the Manetti stock, as its foliage is more like&nbsp;that of many cultivated forms than the brier, and therefore more&nbsp;easily overlooked. Where standards or half-standards are required,&nbsp;the brier stock from the hedges is always used. It forms the most&nbsp;reliable stock for dwarfs of all kinds, and especially for tea roses,&nbsp;most of which fail on the Manetti stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An open situation, not shaded but sheltered from strong winds, is what the rose prefers. October and November are the best&nbsp;months for planting roses, but if the weather be wet or frosty and the&nbsp;soil sticky, the plants should be placed in a sheltered place and&nbsp;protected by green boughs or matting until suitable conditions prevail. The planting should never be deep, the uppermost layer of&nbsp;roots being about J or 3 in. below the general level of the surface,&nbsp;and the soil should always be kept stirred with the hoe during the&nbsp;summer months. In regard to pruning, roses vary considerably,&nbsp;some requiring close cutting and others only thinning out; some&nbsp;again, such as strong growing climbers, may be safely pruned in&nbsp;autumn, and others are better left till spring. Instructions on this&nbsp;point as to the several groups of varieties will be found in most rose&nbsp;catalogues, and may be followed, provided the variety is true to&nbsp;name. It may.be laid down as a general rule that the more strongly&nbsp;growing varieties should be less severely cut back than the weakly&nbsp;varieties; and, again, the more tender the variety, the later in the&nbsp;spring should the pruning be done, April being the best month for&nbsp;pruning teas and noisettes. It should be remembered also that no</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
