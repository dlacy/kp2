<p><span class="font1">ready turning round an axis A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 17. J, receives an impulſe which makes it actually turn round another&nbsp;axis C r, there </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">has been propagated to each particle</span><span class="font1"> a force&nbsp;preciſely competent to produce, not the motion, but the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">change</span><span class="font1"> of motion which takes place in that particle,&nbsp;that is, a force which, when compounded with the inherent force </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">its primitive motion, produces the new&nbsp;motion ; that is (by this theorem), a force wſhich alone&nbsp;would have cauſed it to turn round a third axis B </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">with a rotation making the other conſtituent of the actual rotation round C </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This muſt be conſidered as one of the moſt important propofitions in dynamics, anti gives a great extenſion to&nbsp;the doctrine of the compofition of motion. We ſee that&nbsp;rotations are compounded in the ſame manner as other&nbsp;motions, and it is extremely eaſy to diſcover the compofition. We have only to ſuppoſe a ſphere deſeribed&nbsp;round the centre of the body ; and the equator of this&nbsp;ſphere correſponding to any primitive poſition of the&nbsp;axis of rotation gives us the direction and velocity of&nbsp;the particles ſituated in it. Let another great circle&nbsp;cut this equator in any point ; it will be the equator&nbsp;oſ another rotation. Set off an arch of each from the&nbsp;point of interſection, proportional to the angular velocity of each rotation, and complete the ſpherical parallelogram. The great circle, which is the diagonal&nbsp;of this parallelogram, will be the equator of the rotation, wſhich is actually compounded of the other two.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">And thus may any two rotations be compounded. We have given an inſtance </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">this in the ſolution of the&nbsp;problem of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Precession of the Equinoxes,</span><span class="font1"> Vol. XV.&nbsp;p. 463.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It appears plainly in the demonſtration of this theorem that the axis C </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1"> is a new line in the body. The change of rotation is not accompliſhed by a transference&nbsp;' of the poles and equator of the former rotation to a&nbsp;new ſituation, in which they are again the poles and&nbsp;equator of the rotation ; for we ſee that in the rotation round the axis C </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c,</span><span class="font1"> the particle of the body which&nbsp;was formerly the pole A is deſeribing a circle round the&nbsp;axis C </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> Not knowing this compofition of rotations,&nbsp;Newton, Walmefly, Simpſon, and other celebrated mathematicians, imagined, that the axis of the earth’s rotation remained the fame, but changed its poſition. In this&nbsp;they were confirmed by the conſtancy of the obſerved latitudes of places on the ſurface of the earth. But the&nbsp;axis of the earth’s rotation really changes its place, and&nbsp;the poles ſhift through different points of its ſurface ;&nbsp;but theſe different points are too near each other to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">make the change ſenſible to the niceſt obſervation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It would ſeem to rtſult from theſe obſervations, that it is impoſſible that the axis of rotation can change its&nbsp;poſition in abſolute ſpace without changing its poſition&nbsp;in the body, contrary to wſhat we∙ experience in a thouſand familiar inſtances ; and indeed this is impoſſible by&nbsp;any one change. We cannot by the impulſe of any&nbsp;one force make a body which is turning round the axis&nbsp;Aa change its poſition and turn.round the ſame material axis brought into the poſition C r. In the ſame&nbsp;way that a body muſt paſs through a ſeries of intermediate points, in going from one end of a line to the&nbsp;other, ſo it· muſt acquire an infinite ſeries of intermediate rotations (each of them momentary) before the&nbsp;fame material axis paſſes into another poſition, ſo as to&nbsp;become an. axis’ of rotation. </span><span class="font2">A </span><span class="font1">momentary impulſe&nbsp;may make a great change of the poſition of the axis </span><span class="font2">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">rotation, as it may make in the velocity of a rectilineal&nbsp;motion. Thus although the rotation round A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> be indefinitely ſmall, if another equally ſmall rotation be&nbsp;impreſſed round an axis B </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1"> perpendicular to A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;axis will at once ſhift to C </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1"> half way between them ;&nbsp;but a ſucceſſion of rotations is necefl'ary for carrying the&nbsp;primitive material axis into a new poſition, wſhere it is&nbsp;again an axis. This transference, however, is poſſible,&nbsp;but gradual, and muſt be accompliſhed by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">continuation&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of impulſes totally different from what we would at firſt&nbsp;ſuppoſe. In order that A may paſs from A to C, it&nbsp;is not enough that it gets an impulſe in the direction&nbsp;AC. Such an impulſe would carry it thither, if the&nbsp;body had not been whirling round A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> by the mere&nbsp;perſeverance of matter in its ſtate of motion; but wſhen&nbsp;the body is already whirling round A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font1"> the particles&nbsp;in the circle IP </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1"> are moving in the circumference of&nbsp;that circle ; and ſince that circle alſo partakes of the&nbsp;motion given to A, every particle in it muſt be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">incejſant-ly</span><span class="font1"> deflected from the path in which it is moving. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">continual</span><span class="font1"> agency of a force is therefore neceſſary for this&nbsp;purpoſe ; and if this force be diſeontinued, the point&nbsp;A will immediately quit the plane of the arch AC,&nbsp;along which we are endeavouring to move it, and will&nbsp;ſtart up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is the theorem which we formerly ſaid would enable us to overcome the difficulties in the inveſtigation of the axis oſ rotation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus we can diſcover what Mr Landen calls the evagations of the poles of rotation by the action of cen∙ ,&nbsp;trifugal forces: For in fig. 16. the known velocity of∣&nbsp;the ball A and the radius AC of its circle of rotation'&nbsp;will give us the centrifugal force by wſhich the balls&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tend</span><span class="font1"> to turn in the plane DA&lt;∕BD. This gives the,&nbsp;axis D </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1"> a tendency to move in a plane perpendicular&nbsp;to the plane of the figure ; and its ſeparation from the&nbsp;poles 1&gt; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1"> does not depend on the ſeparation of the&nbsp;connecting rod A B from its preſent inclination to D </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">but on the angle which the ſpiral path of the ball&nbsp;makes with the plane of a circle of rotation round </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dd.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The diſtance of the new poles from D and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1"> is an arch&nbsp;of a circle which meaſures the angle made by the ſpiral&nbsp;w<sup>,</sup>ith the . circle of rotation, round the primitive axis.&nbsp;This-wall gradually increaſe, and the mathematical axis&nbsp;of rotation will be deſeribing a ſpiral round D and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">gradually ſeparating from , theſe points, and again approaching them, and coinciding with them again, at&nbsp;the time that the balls themſelves are moſt of all removed from their primitive ſituation, namely, when A is&nbsp;in the place of B.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ſame theorem·'alio, enables us </span><span class="font2">to-</span><span class="font1">find the inci-. pient axis of rotation in the complicated caſes which<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>are almoſt inaceeſſible by- means oſ the elementary prin-'&nbsp;ciples of rotation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus, when the centres of oſcillation and-percuſſion do not coincide,, as we ſuppoſed in fig. 5. and 12. .Suppoſe, firſt,.that they do coincide, and find the poſition&nbsp;of the axis.a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font1"> and the angular .velocity of the rotation.&nbsp;Then find the centre of percuſſion, the axis P</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">p,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;the momentum.round it, and the angular velocity which&nbsp;this momentum would produce. Thus we have obtained tw<sup>τ</sup>o rotations round given axes, and with given angular velocities. Compound theſe rotations by this&nbsp;theorem, and we obtain the required poſition of the</span></p>
