<p><label>RISIBLE</label>
any thing capable of exciting laughter.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Ludicrous</hi> is a general term, ſignifying, as may appear ſrom its derivation, what is playſome, ſportive, or jocular. <hi rend="italic">Ludicrous</hi> therefore ſeems the genus, of which <hi rend="italic">riſible</hi> is a ſpecies, limited as above to what makes us laugh.</p><p>However eaſy it may be, concerning any particular object, to ſay whether it be riſible or not, it ſeems difficult, if at all practicable, to eſtabliſh any general character, by which objects of that kind may be diſtin-guiſhed from others. Nor is that a ſingular caſe ; for, upon a review, we find the ſame difficulty in moſt of the articles already handled. There is nothing more eaſy, viewing a particular object, than to pronounce that it is beautiful or ugly, grand or little : but were we to attempt general rules for ranging objects under different claſſes according to theſe qualities, we ſhould be much gravelled. A ſeparate cauſe increaſes the difficulty of diſtinguiſhing riſible objects by a general character : all· men are not equally affected by riſible objects, nor the fame man at all times ; for in high ſpi-rits a thing will make him laugh outright, which will ſcarce provoke a ſmile in a grave mood. Riſible objects, However, are circumſcribed within certain limits. No object is riſible but what appears flight, little, or trivial ; for we laugh at nothing that is of importance to our own intereſt or to that of others. A real diſtreſs raiſes pity, and · therefore cannot be riſible ; but a flight or imaginary diſtreſs, which moves not pity, is riſible. The adventure of the fulling-mills in Don Quixote, is extremely riſible ; ſo is the ſcene where Sancho, in a dark night, tumbling into a pit, and at</p><p>taching himſelf to the ſide by hand and foot, hangs there in terrible diſmay till the morning, when he dif-covers himſelf to be within a foot of the bottom. A noſe remarkably long or ſhort, is riſible ; but to want it altogether, ſo ſar from provoking laughter, raiſss horror in the ſpectator. With reſpect to works both of nature and of art, none of them are riſible but what are out of rule ; ſome remarkable defect or exceſs, a very long viſage, for example, or a very ſhort one. Hence nothing juſt, proper, decent, beautiful, proportioned, or grand, is riſible.</p><p>Even from this flight ſketch it will be readily conjectured, that the emotion raiſed by a riſible object is of a nature ſo ſingular, as ſcarce to find place while the mind is occupied with any other paſſion or emotion ; and the conjecture is verified by experience ; for we ſcarce ever find that emotion blended with any other. ' One emotion we muſt except ; and that is, contempt raiſed by certain improprieties : every improper act inſpires us with ſome degree of contempt for the author ; and if an improper act be at the ſame time riſible to provoke laughter, of which blunders and abſurdities are noted inſtances, the two emotions of contempt and of laughter unite intimately in the mind, and produce externally what is termed a <hi rend="italic">laugh of derifiοn</hi> or <hi rend="italic">of ſcorn.</hi> Hence objects that cauſe laughter may be diſtinguiſhed into two kinds : they are either <hi rend="italic">rifible</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ridiculous.</hi> A riſible object is mirthful only ; a ridiculous object is both mirthful and contemptible. The firſt raiſes an emotion of laughter that is altogether pleaſant : the pleaſant emotion of laughter raiſed by the other, is blended with the painful emotion of contempt ; and the mixed emotion is termed <hi rend="italic">the emotion of ridicule. .</hi> The pain a ridiculous object gives me, is reſented and puniſhed by a laugh of deriſion. A riſible object, on the other hand, gives me no pain; it is altogether pleaſant by a certain ſort of titillation, which is expreſſed externally by mirthful laughter. See Ridicule.</p><p>Riſible objects are ſo common, and ſo well underſtood, that it is unneceſſary to confirme paper or time upon them. Take the few following examples :</p><p><hi rend="italic">Falſtaff.</hi> I do remember him at Clement’s inn, like a man made after flipper of a cheeſe-paring. When· he was naked, he was for all the world like a forked radiſh, with a head fantaſtically carved upon it with a knife. <hi rend="italic">Second part, Henry</hi> IV. <hi rend="italic">aft.</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">ſc.</hi> 5.</p><p>The foregoing is of diſproportion. The following examples are of flight or imaginary misfortunes.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Falſtaff.</hi> Go fetch me a quart of ſack, put a toaſt in’t. Have I liv’d tσ be carried in a baſket, like a bar-row of butcher’s offal, and to be thrown into the Thames ! Well, if I be ſerved ſuch another trick, I’ll have my brains ta’en out and butter’d, and give them to a dog for a new-year’s gift. The rogues flighted me into the river with as little remorſe as they would have drown’d a bitch’s blind puppies, fifteen i'th'litter ; and you may know by my ſize that I have a kind of alacrity in finking ; if the bottom were as deep as hell, I ſhould down. I had been drown’d, but that the ſhore was ſhelvy and ſhallow ; a death that I abhor : for the water ſwells a man ; and what a thing ſhould I have been when I had been ſwell’d ? I ſhould have been a mountain of mummy.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Merry Wives of Wiηdfor <hi rend="sub">i</hi> aft fſe- iζ.</hi></p>

<p><hi rend="italic">Ralſtaff.</hi> Nay, you ſhall hear, Maſter Brook, what I have buffer’d to bring this woman to evil for your good. Being thus cramm’d in the baſket, a couple of Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were call’d forth by their miſtreſs, to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane. They took me on their ſhoulders, met the jealous knave their maſter in the door, who aſk’d them once or twice what they had in their baſket. I quak’d ſor fear, left the lunatic knave would have ſearch’d it ; but Fate, ordaining he ſhould be a cuckold, held his hand. Well, on went he for a ſearch, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the ſe-quel, Maſter Brook. I ſuffer’d the pangs of three egregious deaths : firſt, an intolerable fright, to be detected by a jealous rotten bell-weather ; next, to be compaſs’d like a good bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head ; and then to be ſtopt in, like a ſtrong diſtillation, with ſtinking clothes that fretted in their own greaſe. Think of that, a man of my kidney ; think of that, that am as ſubject to heat as butter ; a man of continual diſſolution and thaw ; it was a miracle to 'ſcape ſuffocation. And in the height of this bath, when I was more than half ſtew’d in greaſe, like a Dutch diſli, to be thrown into the Thames, and cool’d glowing hot, in that ſurge, like a horſe-ſhoe ; think of that ; hilſing hot ; think of that, Mr Brook.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Merry Wives of Windfοr, aft $»ſc.</hi> 17.</p>
