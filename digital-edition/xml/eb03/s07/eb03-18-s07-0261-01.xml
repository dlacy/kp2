a very ancient kingdom of Aſia, lying between the Mediterranean on the west, the Euphrates on the eaſt, and Arabia Deſerta, Phoenicia, and Paleſtine, on the ſouth.</p><p>In ancient times this country was called <hi rend="italic">Aram,</hi> from Aram the youngeſt ſon of Shem, who ſettled here ; but in proceſs of time the name came to be changed into <hi rend="italic">Syria,</hi> from one <hi rend="italic">Syrus,</hi> according to ſome ; though others think it is only a contraction of the word <hi rend="italic">Assyria.</hi> At first it was undoubtedly parcelled out into ſeveral petty ſtates ; all of which ſeem afterwards to have been reduced under ſubjection to the four principal ones, Zobah, Damaſcus, Hamath, and Geſhur. Afterwards the whole country was divided into two parts only, viz. Coeleſyria and Phoenicia; though the Phoenicians, Idumeans, Jews, Gazites, and Azotites, or the whole country of the Philiſtines, was included. Alter the death of Alexander, Syria, in the great extent of the word, was divided, according to Strabo, into Comagene, Seleucis of Syria, Coeleſyria, Phoenice on the ſea-coaſt, and Judea in the midland. Ptolemy, however, ſubdivides theſe ; and in the Proper Syria reckons only Comagene, Pieria, Cyrrhistica or Cyrrheſtica, Seleucis, Caſſiotis or Caſiotis, Chalybonitis, Chalcidice or Chalcidene, Apamene, Laodicene, Phoenicia Mediterranea, Coeleſyria and Palmyrene.</p><p>The hiſtory of the ancient Syrians, till the time of their being carried away by the kings of Aſſyria, is totally unknown, excepting a few particulars which may be gathered from Scripture, and which it is needleſs here to repeat. During the continuance of the Aſſyrian, Babylonian, and Perſian monarchies, the hiſtory of this country affords nothing remarkable; but after the death of Alexander, it gave name to a very conſiderable empire, which makes a conſpicuous figure in ancient hiſtory. At this time, however, it was not confined to Syria properly ſo called, but comprehended all thoſe vaſt provinces of the Upper Aſia which formed the Perſian empire ; being, in its full extent, bounded by the Mediterranean upon one side, and the river Indus on the other. The first king was Seleucus, one of the generals of Alexander the Great ; who, after the death of that conqueror, being made governor of Babylon, was tempted, by the example of Alexander’s other captains, to set up for himſelf. Eumenes, who had ſincerely at heart the intereſt of Alexander’s family, ſolicited his aſſiſtance againſt Antigonus, who had openly revolted ; but Seleucus not only refused this aſſiſtance, but attempted to deſtroy Eumenes himſelf with his whole army, by cutting the ſluices of the Euphrates, and laying under water the whole plain where they were encamped. Eumenes, however, found means to eſcape the danger without the loſs of a man. Upon this Seleucus endeavoured to gain over his troops : but finding that impoſſible, he made a truce with Eumenes, and granted him a safe paſſage through his province; but at the ſame time ſent an express to Antigonus, deſiring him to fall upon him before he was joined by the governors of Upper Aſia. Antigonus did not fail to follow his advice ; but having prevailed againſt Eumenes through treachery, he next thought of bringing Seleucus himſelf under ſubjection. On his return to Babylon, therefore, after having been feaſted with his whole army by Seleucus, he demanded of him an account oſ the revenues of his province. Receiving an unfavourable answer to this queſtion, Antigonus was ſo much exaſperated, that Seleucus, not thinking himſelf a match for him at that time, thought proper to fly into Egypt.</p><p>By the flight of Seleucus, Antigonus was left maſter of all his provinces ; but his ſon Demetrius being afterwards defeated by Ptolemy at Gaza, Seleucus began to think of recovering what he had loſt. Being furniſhed by Ptolemy with 1000 foot and 200 horſe, he ſet out with that ſlender force to attempt the recovery of Babylon. Nothing could have a more deſperate appearance than this undertaking ; yet Seleucus was not diſcouraged. On his arrival at Carrhæ in Meſopotamia, partly by force and partly by perſuaſion, he prevailed on the Macedonians who garriſoned that place to revolt from Antigonus and join him. Being thus reinforced, he entered the territories of Babylon, where new ſupplies were continually added to his army ; his ancient ſubjects flocking to him from all parts, and declaring themſelves ready to ſtand by him with their lives and fortunes. This happened in conſequence of the lenity with which they had been treated by Seleucus; whereas Antigonus was universally deteſted on account of his ſeverity. — As he approached the city, those who favoured Antigonus retired into the citadel, but were soon obliged to ſurrender ; and in that fortreſs Seleucus found his children, friends, and domeſtics, whom Antigonus had kept priſoners ever ſince his flight into Egypt.</p><p>Seleucus having thus made himſelf maſter of Babylon, in the year 512 B. C. began to prepare for encountering Antigonus, who he knew would soon attack him with all his force. Nicanor, governor of Media under Antigonus, first advanced againſt him at the head of 10,000 foot and 7000 horſe ; but Seleucus, with only 3000 foot and 400 horſe, having drawn him into an ambuſh, cut off almoſt the whole, of his army, and ſuch of the ſoldiers as had eſcaped the ſlaughter willingly enliſted under his banner.</p><p>The conſequence of this victory was the ſubmiſſion of all Media and Suſiana; which alarming Antigonus, he sent his ſon Demetrius with an army of 5000 Macedonian foot, 10,000 mercenaries, and 4000 horſe. Seleucus was then in Media ; and Patrocles, wisdom he had left to take care of Babylon, finding his force inadequate to that purpoſe, compelled the inhabitants to lcave the city and diſperſe themſelves in the adjacent countries, while he himſelf, with what troops he had, retired into two forts, which he thought could ealily be defended. When therefore Demetrius entered Babylon, he was ſurpriſed to find it deſerted, upon which he inſtantly attacked the forts. One was quickly reduced ; but as the other held out till the expiration of the time which had been allowed him by his father, he left 5000 toot and 1000 horſe under the command of Archelaus to carry on the ſiege. With the reſt he marched away, buffering his ſoldiers to live at diſcretion as he went along; which so provoked the Babylonians, that they were ever after attached to Seleucus as if he had been their natural prince.</p><p>On the return of Seleucus to Babylon, he eaſily drove out the troops left by Antigonus, recovered the caſtle which he had garriſoned, and ſettled his authority on ſuch a firm foundation, that it could never afterwards be moved. Having then marched again into Media, he defeated and killed with his own hand Nicanor or Nicator, whom Antigonus had ſent againſt him ; after which, having ſettled the affairs of Media, he reduced all Perſia, Bactria, and Hyrcania, ſubjecting to his new empire theſe and all the other provinces on this side the Indus which had been conquered.</p><p>Seleucus being now maſter of all the countries which lie between the Euphrates and the Indus, took the title of king of Babylon and Media. But, not ſatisfied with theſe possessions, ample as they were, he croſſed the Indus, in order to conquer thoſe regions which had ſubmitted to Alexander beyond that river. But, during the time that the generals of Alexander had been making war upon his family and up<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0268.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0262"/>
on one another, one Sandracottus, a native of India, had driven out the Macedonians, and made himſelf maſter of the whole country. He oppoſed Seleucus with an army of <hi rend="smallcaps">600,000</hi> men, and a prodigious number of elephants; which intimidated the Macedonian ſo much, that he offered to leave Sandracottus in quiet poſſeſſion of his dominions, provided he would furniſh him with 500 elephants. To this Sandracottus readily assented ; upon which Seleucus marched back into the west againſt Antigonus, and, in conjunction with Lyſimachus and Ptolemy, engaged and totally defeated and killed him at Ipſus. After this Seleucus marched into Upper Syria, which he reduced entirely, and built the city of Antioch on the Orontes. In the ſame country he built ſeveral other cities ; one of which he called <hi rend="italic">Seleucia,</hi> from his own name ; another <hi rend="italic">Apamea,</hi> from his wife Apama, the daughter of one Artabazus a Perſian; and a third <hi rend="italic">Laodicen,</hi> from his mother Laodice. He firſt entered into an alliance with Demetrius, and married Stratonice his daughter; but ſoon after aſſiſted Lyſimachus and Ptolemy to deprive him of the beſt part of his dominions. Thus Demetrius being reduced ſo low that he could give him no farther jealouſy, Seleucus betook himſelf to the building of another city, which he called likewiſe <hi rend="italic">Seleucia,</hi> and which ſtood on the place where the city of Bagdad now stands. Beſides theſe, he built a great many others ; 16 of which he called <hi rend="italic">Antioch,</hi> ſrorn the name of his brother Antiochus ; nine <hi rend="italic">Seleucia,</hi> from his own name ; three <hi rend="italic">Apamea,</hi> from Apama his firſt wife ; one <hi rend="italic">Stratonicea,</hi> from his ſecond wife Stratonice ; and six <hi rend="italic">Laodicea,</hi> from his mother Laodice.</p><p>In 284 Seleucus entered into a war with Lyſimachus, with whom he had hitherto lived in ſtrict amity. Out of 36 general officers left by Alexander the Great, they two only ſurvived, and both were upwards of 70 years old. Nevertheleſs they were both filled with the ambition and animoſity of young men. The two armies met at a place called <hi rend="italic">Curopedion</hi> in Phrygia, where an obſtinate engagement took place. Victory was long doubtful : but at laſt Lyſimachus was run through with a spear, and died on the ſpot; on which his troops betook themſelves to flight, and left Seleucus maſter of their baggage. This victory added to the poſſeſſions of Seleucus all thoſe provinces which had formerly been ſubject to Lyſimachus. The former exulted much in his good fortune ; being chiefly pleaſed that he was now the laſt of Alexander’s captains, and by this victory became, as he ſtyled it, <hi rend="italic">the conqueror of conquerors;</hi> and on this account he is generally called <hi rend="italic">Nicator,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the conqueror.</hi> His triumph, however, on this occaſion, was but ſhort-lived ; for, ſeven months after, as he was marching towards Macedon to take posſession of that kingdom, he was treacherouſly murdered by Ptolemy Ceraunus, on whom he had conferred innumerable favours. Philetærus prince of Pergamus purchaſed his body at a great price from Ptolemy, and sent it to his ſon Antiochus ; who, with extraordinary pomp, burned it in Seleucia on the ſea coaſt, erecting on the place a magnificent chapel, which he called from Iris ſurname <hi rend="italic">Nicatorium.</hi></p><p>Seleucus was ſucceeded by his ſon Antiochus Soter, who held the empire 19 years. He reſigned to Antigonus Conatus all pretensions to the crown of Macedon ; and having engaged in a war with Eumenes king of Pergamus, he was defeated by him, and obliged to yield up part of his dominions. He died in 261 B. C. and was ſucceeded by his ſon Antiochus Theos ; who having engaged in a war with Ptolemy Philadelphus king of Egypt, the Parthians and Bactrians took an οppοrtunity to revolt, and could never afterwards be reduced. In 246 B. C. he was poiſoned by his wife Laodice, whom he had divorced for Berenice daughter to Ptolemy, with whom he made peace on the revolt of the Bactrians. On the death of Ptolemy, Antiochus divorced Berenice, and took back Laodice ; who, to ſecure herſelf againſt the effects of his fickle diſpoſition, poiſoned him, as we have juſt mentioned, and raised to the throne her own ſon, named <hi rend="italic">Seleucus Callinicus.</hi> Not thinking herſelf ſafe, however, as long as Berenice lived, Laodice began immediately to concert meaſures for putting both her and her ſon to death. Berenice attempted to ſave herſelf by retiring to Daphne, where ſhe ſhut herſelf up in an aſylum built by Seleucus Nicator. There ſhe was cloſely besieged by the ſons of Seleucus ; of which the cities of Aſia having intelligence, formed a confederacy in her favour. Her brother the king of Egypt alſo haſtened to her relief with a conſiderable army; but before either of theſe could come to her aſſiſtance, both ſhe and her ſon were barbarouſly murdered, with all the Egyptians who attended them.</p><p>Ptolemy, on hearing the melancholy news of his ſiſter’s death, determined to take the moſt ſevere vengeance on her murderers. Joining his forces to thoſe of the Aſiatics, he carried every thing before him. Having in the firſt place put an end to the life of Laodice, he made himſelf maſter of all Syria and Cilicia ; then paſſing the Euphrates, he ſubdued all the country as far as Babylon and the Tigris ; and had not the progreſs of his arms been interrupted by a ſedition which obliged him to return to Egypt, it is more than probable that he would have ſubdued the whole Syrian empire. As ſoon as he was returned, Seleucus attempted to revenge himſelf ; but his fleet being deſtroyed by a violent ſtorm, and his land-army defeated by Ptolemy, he concluded a truce for ten years. During all this time the Parthian prince had eſtabliſhed himſelf ſo firmly on the throne, that it was in vain to think of diſpoſtessing him. However, as ſoon as his other affairs would permit, Seleucus undertook an expedition againſt Arsaces the Parthian monarch ; by whom he was utterly defeated, taken prisoner, and carried into Parthia, where he died four years after. He was ſucceeded by his eldeſt ſon Seleucus Ceraunus, a weak prince, who was poiſoned by a conſpiracy of two of his officers, when he had reigned one year; after which his brother Antiochus, ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Great,</hi> aſcended the throne in 225 B. C.</p><p>In the very beginning of his reign, two of his generals, Alexander and Molo, rebelled againſt him. The former had been appointed governor of Persia, and the latter of Media; but they, deſpiſing the king’s youth, refuſed to obey. The occaſion of this revolt is ſaid to have ſeen their dread of the cruelty of Hermias the king’s prime miniſter; and as they hoped to draw into their ſchemes Achæus governor of the provinces off Asia Minor, they doubted not of ſucceſs. In this, however, they failed; but this did rot diſcourage them from proceeding in their rebellion. Epigenes, the commander of the troops about the king’s perſon, adviſed him to march without delay againſt the rebels; but as Hermias reproached him with treachery and a deſign to betray the king into the hands of his enemies, Antiochus sent two of his generals into the eaſt, while he himſelf undertook an expedition againſt Ptolemy Philadelphus, with a view of recovering Coeleſyria. In this attempt, however, he was diſappointed ; and the generals whom he had sent into the eaſt were totally defeated, and their troops cut off : upon which he determined to lay aſide for the preſent his Syrian enterprise, and march in person againſt the rebels. This was again oppoſed by Hermias ; but as he found it impoſsible to alter the king’s mind, the treacherous miniſter found means to get Epigenes the author of this project executed, under pretence of holding a correspondence with Molo one of the rebel chiefs. Antiochus in the mean time pursued<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0269.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0263"/>
his march againſt the rebels, whom he defeated in a pitched battle ; upon which their chiefs laid violent hands on themſelves. On his return he received the submiſſion of the Atropatii, a barbarous people in Media ; and put to death his prime miniſter Hermias, whom he found hatching treacherous deſigns againſt him. During his lifetime, however, the traitor, by accusing Achæus of treaſon, had obliged him to revolt in his own defence.·, ſo that the king had ſtill two important wars on his hands, viz. that with Ptolemy king of Egypt, and the other againſt Achæus. After ſome deliberation, he reſolved to march firſt againſt the king of Egypt ; and was at firſt very ſucceſsful, reducing many cities in Coelesyria and Paleſtine, and defeating the Egyptians in a pitched battle : but in the year 217 B. C. being worſted in the battle of Ravhia, he was obliged to abandon all his conqueſts ; of which Ptolemy immediately took poſſession, and Antiochus was obliged to cede them to him, that he might be at leiſure to purſue the war againſt Achæus.</p><p>Antiochus having made vaſt preparations for his expedition, ſoon reduced Achæus to such diſtreſs, that he was obliged to ſhut himſelf up in the city of Sardis, which he defended for ſome time with great bravery ; till at laſt, being betrayed by two Cretans, he was delivered up to the king, and by his order put to death. Antiochus then undertook an expedition againſt the Parthians, whom he obliged to conclude a peace on very advantageous terms. He then turned his arms againſt the king of Bactria, whom he alſo compelled to agree to his terms ; one of which was, that he ſhould give him up all his elephants. For the confirmation of the treaty, the king of Bactria ſent his ſon to Antiochus ; who being taken with his majeſtic mien and agreeable converſation, gave him one of his daughters in marriage. He then croſſed Mount Caucaſus, and entered India ; where having renewed his alliance with the king of that country, he received alſo of his elephants, which increaſed his ſtock to 150. From India he marched into Arachoſia, Drangiana, and Carmania, eſtabliſhing order and diſcipline in all thoſe countries : then paſſing through Perira, Babylonia, and Meſopotamia, he returned to Antioch, after an abſence of ſeven years.</p><p>In the year 204 B. C. Antiochus entered into a league with Philip of Macedon, on purpoſe to deprive Ptolemy Epiphanes, the infant king of Egypt, of all his dominions. The Egyptians, however, put the young king under the tuition of the Romans ; who immediately required the confederate princes to deſiſt from any enterprise againſt the king of Egypt, under the penalty of incurring the diſpleaſure of the republic. After delivering this message, M. Emilius Lepidus, one of the ambaſſadors, repaired to Egypt, where he took upon himſelf the office of regent and guardian to the young king. Having regulated affairs there in the best manner he could, he returned to Rome, after having appointed one Ariſtomenes, an Acarnanian, to be chief miniſter to the king. Ariſtomenes being a man of prudence and fidelity, acquitted himſelf very well in his new ſtation. Having taken care to recruit his army as well as he could, he ſent one Scopas, a man of great authority among the Ætolians, into that country, to raiſe auxiliaries. Scopas ſoon raised an army of 6000 Ætolians, at that time reputed the best ſoldiers in the world ; and having joined the Egyptian army, reduced all Judea, put a garriſon into the caſtle at Jeruſalem, and, on the approach of winter, returned to Alexandria loaded with booty. Theſe exploits, however, were performed when Antiochus was abſent in Asia Minor; and no ſooner was he returned, than the face of affairs was changed. Scopas was defeated in a pitched battle, where one half of his men were deſtroyed. He himſelf eſcaped to Sidon, where he ſhut himſelf up with 10,000 of his ſoldiers; but Antiochus having inveſted the place, Scopas was reduced to the neceſſity of ſurrendering at diſcretion. The king purſued his conqueſts ; recovered all Paleſtine and Cœleſyria ; after which he invaded Aſia Minor, in hopes of reducing it alſo, and reſtoring the Syrian empire to the ſame extent it had in the time of Seleucus Nicator. The free cities in Aſia Minor immediately had recourse to the Romans, who ſent an embaſſy to Antiochus on the occaſion ; but as both parties put on thoſe haughty and imperious airs to which they thought the greatneſs of their power gave them a right, no ſatisfaction was given, but every thing tended to an open rupture. While matters were in this ſituation, Hannibal the Great being obliged to leave his own country, fled to Antiochus : from whom he met with a gracious reception. As Hannibal had, while a child, ſworn perpetual enmity againſt the Romans, he uſed all his eloquence to perſuade Antiochus to make war with them ; and as the many victories which he had gained over them left no room to doubt of his capacity, Antiochus doubted nothing of being able, by his aſſiſtance, to conquer that haughty people. Several embaſſies passed between the two nations; but chiefly with a deſign, on the part of Antiochus, to gain time. Hannibal endeavoured to draw his countrymen into the confederacy againſt Rome, but without effect. Antiochus having ſtrengthened himſelf by ſeveral alliances, at laſt reſolved to begin the war in earneſt. To consult on the meaſures proper to be taken, he called a council of war ; but excluded from it the only man whoſe advice he ought to have followed ; namely, Hannibal the Carthaginian. The reaſon of this was, that he had become jealous of him from the too great intimacy, as he thought, which he had kept with the Roman ambaſſadors. However, in this council it was agreed that the war ſhould be immediately commenced. The King himſelf was prevailed upon by the Ætolians to paſs over into Greece, and at the ſame time entirely to reject the advice which Hannibal had formerly given, of sending him with an army into Italy. Here he was made generaliſſimo of all the Greek forces.; but made none of thoſe efforts that had formerly obtained him the title of Great. Indeed it now plainly appeared, not only that he was incapable of carrying on war againſt ſuch enemies as the Romans, but even of accepting proper advice when it was given him. In another council, into which Hannibal was admitted, that commander adviſed the king, before he undertook any thing else, to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to gain over Philip of Macedon ; which, he ſaid, was a lien ſo important, that if it could be gained, they might, without much ado, become masters of all Greece. But if Philip could not be prevailed on to make war on the Romans, he was of opinion that the king ſhould send his ſon Seleucus into Macedon at the head of an army, and thus prevent Philip from giving the Romans any aſſiſtance. But he ſtill maintained, that the only way to defeat the Romans was to send an army into Italy. This advice was again rejected ; and the king imprudently became the aggreſſor, by falling on a body of 500 Romans before war had been declared. He alſo made king Philip his enemy, by entertaining the regent of Athamania, who was a pretender to the crown of Macedon. To complete all, he himſelf fell in love, tho’ above 40 years of age, with a beautiful young woman of Chalcis, whom he married ; and became ſo great a ſlave to this paſſion, that he entirely neglected his affairs ; the army gave themſelves up entirely to diſſipation and debauchery, and every trace of military diſcipline vaniſhed.</p><p>In the year 191 B. C. Antiochus was raised from his lethargy by a declaration of war againſt him at Rome, and ſet out for Ætolia. His army at this time amounted to no more than 10,000 foot and 500 horſe. He had been made.<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0270.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0264"/>
to believe that he would receive a vaſt reinforcement in Ætolia : but when he came to make the experiment, he ſoon found his miſtake ; all the troops he could raiſe there amounted to no more than 4000 men. With this force, ſo exceedingly inadequate to the purpoſe, he was obliged to oppoſe the Roman army, who were advancing in conjunction with the Macedonians, and had already made ſurpriſing progress. Antiochus ſeized the Straits of Thermopylae; but was driven from them by the Romans, the king himſelf being the firſt that fled. Almoſt his whole army was deſtroyed in the battle or in the purſuit, and Antiochus returned with disgrace into Aſia.</p><p>Soon after his return, Antiochus equipped a fleet of 200 ſail ; on which he immediately embarked for the Thracian Cherſoneſus, now Crim Tartary, where he fortified the cities of Lyſirhachia, Seſtus, and Abydos, with others in that neighbourhood, to prevent the Romans from croſſing the Helleſpont. In the mean time Polyxenidas the Syrian admiral ſent intelligence to the king that the Roman fleet had appeared off Delos; upon which he deſired him to ſeek them out and engage them at all events. He did ſo, and was defeated with the loſs of 40 ſhips taken or sunk in the engagement. This was ſoon after revenged by the deſtruction of the Rhodian fleet by the artifice of Polyxenidas ; but in the end the king’s affairs went everywhere to wreck. Having laid siege to the city of Pergamus, he was obliged to raiſe it with loſs ; the Phoenician fleet commanded by Hannibal was defeated by the Rhodians ; and ſoon after the Syrian fleet under Polyxenidas was utterly defeated by the Romans. Antiochus was ſo much diſheartened by theſe repeated defeats, that he appeared like one infatuated. Inſtead of fortifying more ſtrongly thoſe cities which lay on the frontiers of his kingdom, he entirely deſerted them: and thus Lyſimachia and Abydos, the two keys to Aſia, fell into the hands of the Romans without the leaſt reſiſtance.</p><p>The arrival of the Romans in Aſia ſtruck Antiochus with ſuch terror, that he inſtantly ſued for peace. The terms he offered were indeed very advantageous, but by no means agreeable to the expectations of the Romans. They therefore gave him this final anſwer : 1. That ſince he had drawn upon himſelf the war; he ſhould defray the whole expence of it ; 2. That he ſhould reſtore liberty in general to all the Greek cities in Aſia; and, 3. That to prevent future hostilities, he ſhould relinquiſh all Asia on this side Mount Taurus. Theſe terms, however, ſtill appeared to him ſo intolerable, that he reſolved to continue the war ; and determined alſo to take the moſt imprudent method of carrying it on, namely, by hazarding all on the event of a general engagement. The king encamped near Magneſia, and ſtrongly fortified his camp. The Romans inſulted him in his trenches, and propoſed to attack his fortifications if he continued to decline an engagement. At laſt the king, thinking it would be ſhameful for him longer to refuſe an engagement, being at the head of an army far more numerous than that of the enemy, in a friend’s country, and in the midſt of his allies, resolved at all events to accept the challenge, and accordingly prepared for a decisive battle.</p><p>The Roman army cosiſted of four legions, partly Romans and partly Latins, each legion at this time containing 5500 men, and of 7000 auxiliaries ſent by the kings of Pergamus and Macedon; but of theſe 2000 were ordered to guard the camp during the action. The Romans were polled in the centre, and the Latins in the two wings, the left of which extended to the river. On the side of the right wing, to cover and ſupport it, the conſul potted the auxiliary troops of Eumenes, a ſmall body of horſe, and ſome Trallians and Cretans lightly armed. Sixteen elephants which the Romans had were placed behind the army by way of corps-de-reserve, the conſul not thinking it proper to oppoſe them to thoſe of the enemy, which were far more numerous, being in all 52, and besides excelled the Roman elephants in ſtrength, height, and courage, the former being brought from India and the latter from Africa. As for the Syrian army, all the nations of the eaſt ſeemed to be affembſed to ſupport the cauſe of Antiochus. But the main ſtrength of it confiſted in 16,000 toot, armed after the Macedonian manner, who compoſed the phalanx. This body faced every way, was armed with long pikes, and taught to fight in cloſe order, as the ſoldiers of Alexander the Great had formerly been. Antiochus did not draw up his phalanx as uſual, but divided it into 10 companies ſeparated from each other, placing, in the ſpaces between each of the companies, an elephant loaded with a tower full of armed men. On the right of the phalanx was drawn up in a line part of the cavalry, viz. 1500 Aſiatic Gauls, 3000 horſe armed cap-a-pee, and 1000 more, the flower of the Median cavalry. At ſome diſtance from theſe followed the cavalry of the king’s houſehold richly clothed, and wearing bucklers plated over with ſilver. In the ſame line 1200 Scythians on horſeback, armed with bows and arrows, made a great figure, being all choſen men, and of an extraordinary size. The light-armed troops, to the number of 3000, partly Trallians and partly Cretans, with 10,000 Myſian archers and 4000 men more, partly Cyrtoeans armed with slings, partly Persians armed with bows, and partly Arabians mounted on dromedaries, cloſed the right wing, which was led on by thc king in perſon, ſurrounded by a body of Syrians and Lydians well mounted, but not heavily armed. The left wing was commanded by Seleucus and Antipater; the former the king’s ſon, and the latter his nephew, and diſpoſed thus: Cloſe to the phalanx were poſted 1500 Galatians and 2000 Cappadocians, which king Ariarathes had ſent to the aſſiſtance of his father-in-law. Next to theſe were placed 2700 auxiliaries ſent from different countries ; theſe were followed by 3000 cuiraſſiers well mounted; and, laſtly, in the flank of this wing marched 2000 horſe lightly armed. At ſome diſtance were placed ſeveral ſmall bodies of light-armed troops both foot and horſe; among which were 2500 Galatian horſe, ſome Tarentines, Cretans, Carians, Cilicians, &amp;c. The phalanx, which was in the centre, was commanded by three officers of diſtinction, viz. Minio, Zeuxis, and Philip. A vaſt number of chariots, armed with hooks and ſcythes, were drawn up before the firſt line, as were likewiſe a great many elephants carrying towers with ſeveral floors, all filled with slingers and archers ; beſides many camels, animals then unknown to the Roman troops, mounted by Arabians armed with ſwords six feet long, that the riders might from their backs reach the enemy. The Romans had never ſeen a more numerous army, nor one more finely adorned; nevertheleſs they never ſhowed ſo great a contempt for an army as for this which they were now going to attack.</p><p>On the day of the battle the weather proved very favourable to the Romans ; for a thick fog rising in the morning, the day was almoſt turned into night, ſo that the Syrian commanders could not have all the corps under their command in view, on account of their great uxtent, nor lend them proper orders in time; whereas the fog was not thick enough to prevent the Roman generals from ſeeing their ſeveral bodies at the greateſt diſtance, as they took up but little ground. Beſides, the damp which was occasioned by the fog ſlackened the ſtrings of the enemy’s bows, ſo that the Aliatics who uſed them could ſhoot their darts and arrows but faintly. The whole dependence of Antiochus in the firſt attack was on his armed chariots, which were to cut their way into the Roman army. For this purpoſe they<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0271.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0265"/>
had long halberts faſtened to their poles, and ſharp hooks to their axle-trees ; the former were about the height of a man’s head, and the latter almoſt ſwept the ground, and cut off the legs of all who ſtood in their way. But Eumenes undertook to render them uſeleſs, and even fatal, to the enemy. This brave prince, putting himſelf at the head of the bowmen and slingers, ordered them to charge, not in a body, but divided in platoons, and to aim only at the horſes in the chariots. Accordingly, as ſoon as the chariots moved, Eumenes advanced at the head of his men, who pouring on them from every quarter darts, ſtones, and javelins, and at the ſame time ſhouting as loud as they could, so frightened the horſes that they could no longer be kept in order, but ſcouring up and down, and turning againſt their own troops, fell on the Arabians who ſupported them, which occaſioned a great confuſion in that quarter. Thoſe in the Syrian army who were at a diſtance, hearing the noise and outcries, and not knowing the cauſe of them, were ſtruck with no ſmall terror. After this advantage, the Roman cavalry advanced, and fell on thoſe whom the chariots had put in diſorder. The Syrians being already intimidated, after a faint reſiſtance gave way ; and the Romans made a great ſlaughter of their men and horſes, both being borne down with the weight of their heavy armour. Eumenes charged the left-wing, in which Seleucus commanded, with ſuch vigour, that he put it to flight ; and the fugitives flying to the phalanx for protection, put that body likewiſe in diſorder ; which Domitius obſerving, advanced againſt it at the head of his legionaries, but could not break it till he ordered his men to attack the elephants ; which, as before obſerved, were placed in the ſpaces between the companies. The Romans had learned, in their wars with Pyrrhus and Hannibal, not to fear thoſe monſters which were once ſo terrible to them. They attacked them, therefore, with great reſolution ; and driving them againſt the phalanx, put that body into diſorder, by means of thoſe very animals which had been poſted there for its defence.</p><p>But in the mean time advice was brought that the left wing of the Romans was in great danger. Antiochus, who had obſerved that the flanks of the left wing were quite open and uncovered, the four ſquadrons which covered it having joined the reſt of the cavalry to fall upon the enemy’s left wing, had charged it at the head of all his auxiliaries, not only in front but in flank. The Roman infantry, seeing themſelves in imminent danger of being ſurrounded and hemmed in on all ſides, fled in great diſorder to their camp, which was guarded by 2000 men under the command of a legionary tribune called <hi rend="italic">Æmilius.</hi> This man feeing the Romans flying towards him, marched out at the head of all his troops to meet them ; and after having bitterly reproached them for their cowardice and ignominious flight, ordered his men to draw their ſwords, and cut in pieces ſuch as ſhould advance one ſtep farther, or refuſe to face about againſt the enemy. This order, given ſo ſeaſonably, and put in execution without mercy againſt ſome, had the deſired effect. Thoſe who were flying firſt halted ; and</p><p>then, being both reinforced and encouraged by Æmilius, returned under his conduct to wipe off the diſhonour of their flight. At the ſame time Attalus the brother of Eumenes, having left the right wing on his receiving advice that the left was in danger, arrived very ſeaſonably with 200 horſe. Antiochus obſerving that the troops which had fled were returning to the battle, and that the enemy's right wing was ready to fall upon him, turned his horſe about and fled. This ſerved in a manner as a ſignal for the reſt of the troops, for the whole Syrian army immediately turned their backs. Eumenes alone pursued them at the head of the cavalry, and made a moſt dreadful havock of the fugitives. The Romans walking over heaps of dead bodies, eſpecially where the phalanx ſtood, marched up to the Syrian camp, attacked, and plundered it. The riches they found in it are not to be deſcribed : but the taking of it cost the Romans a new battle, which proved more fatal to the Syrians than that in the field ; for the Romans having, in ſpite of a moſt deſperate reſiſtance, forced the intrenchments, gave no quarter, but put all to the ſword without diſtinction. There fell this day in the battle, in the purſuit, and in the plunder of the camp, 50,000 foot and 4000 horſe ; 1500 were taken priſoners, and 15 elephants. In the conſular army there were but 300 foot killed and 25 horſe. Eumenes had only 15 of his men killed ; ſo that this victory, as we are told by the ancients, ſeemed a prodigy to all nations both of the eaſt and west.</p><p>Antiochus retired to Sardis with as many of his forces that had eſcaped the ſlaughter as he could draw together. From Sardis he ſoon marched to rejoin his ſon Seleucus, who had fled to Apamea. As for the conſul, he took advantage of the king’s defeat and flight, making himself master of all the neighbouring countries. Deputies haſtened to him from all parts ; the cities of Thyatira, Magnesia, Trallis, Magneſia in Caria, all Lydia, and Epheſus itſelf, though highly favoured by Antiochus, declared for the Romans. Polyxenidas, upon the news of the king’s defeat, left the port of Epheſus, and ſailed to Patara, where he landed with a very ſmall guard, and returned by land into Syria. The conſul took the road to Sardis, which opened its gates to him. As he stopped there, his brother Africanus, as ſoon as his health allowed him, came and joined him in that city, and congratulated him on the glory he had ſo lately acquired.</p><p>Antiochus finding his affairs in a bad ſituation both by ſea and land, and not daring to appear before the conſular army in the field, ſent Antipater his brother’s son, and Zeuxis, who had been governor of Lydia and Phrygia, to ſue for a peace. They were ordered to treat chiefly with the elder brother, of whoſe clemency and good nature Antiochus entertained a high opinion. Accordingly, on their arrival at Sardis, where the conſul then was with his brother, they addreſſed the latter, and were by him preſented to thc conſul. Their ſpeech was very ſubmiſſive, and ſuch as became a vanquiſhed people.</p><p>Hereupon a council was ſummoned, and after long debates the ambassadors were called in ; and Scipio Africanus being desired by the conſul to acquaint the deputies with the reſolutions of the aſſembly, is ſaid to have expresſed himſelf in the following terms : “ We are ſenſible that the victory which we have lately gained is owing to the gods, and therefore ſhall treat the vanquiſhed with moderation, demanding little more of them now than we did at our firſt entering into Aſia. Antiochus ſhall obtain a peace upon the following terms : That he give up his pretenſions to Europe, confine his dominions to Aſia beyond Mount Taurus ; and that he pay 15,000 Euboec talents for the expences of the war ; 500 down, 2500 when the ſenate and people ſhall confirm the articles, and 1000 more every year for 12 years together. We alſo inſiſt upon his ſatisfying king Eumenes, and his paying him the 400 talents he owes him, and what remains due for the corn which his father ſent to the king of Syria. It is likewiſe the pleaſure of the council that you deliver up to us Hannibal the Carthaginian, Thoas the AEtolian. Mnesilochus the Acarnanian, and Philo and Eubulus two Chalcidians; for theſe have been the authors of our divisions, the incendiaries who kindled the preſent war. Laſtly, the king of Syria, for a further proof of his sincerity, ſhall give us 20 ſuch hoſtages as we ſhall chooſe, of whom Antiochus his youngeſt ſon ſhall be one.”<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0272.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s07-0266"/>
The ambaſsadors of Antiochus had been ordered to refuſe no terms; and therefore theſe were accepted, and the whole affair concluded. So that the Syrian ambaſſadors now prepared to ſet out for Rome, to get the conditions of peace propoſed by Scipio ratified there. In the mean time, the conſul dividing his army into three bodies, put it into winter-quarters ; one part continued at Magneſia, another was ſent to Trallis, and the third to Epheſus, where the Scipios took up their quarters. There they received a new embaſſy from Antiochus, with the hoſtages he had promiſed, the Roman priſoners and deſerters, and the ſtrangers which the conſul had demanded, except Hannibal, who after the king’s defeat had fled out of his dominions ; and Thoas the Ætolian, who, as ſoon as he heard that a treaty was on foot between Antiochus and the Romans, had returned to Ætolia, where a war was likely to break out between that republic and Rome. L. Aurelius Cotta was ſent with the ambaſſadors to Rome, to acquaint the ſenate with the particulars of the treaty. When they appeared before the conſcript fathers, they ſpoke with great ſubmiſſion, and only deſired them to ratify the articles which the Scipios had offered to their maſter. The ſenate, after examining them, ordered that a treaty of peace ſhould be concluded with Antiochus, and the articles of it engraved on braſs, and fixed up in the Capitol. They only added one clauſe, which was, That the Syrians ſhould change every year all their hoſtages, except the ſon of king Antiochus, who ſhould continue at Rome as long as the republic thought fit. The peace being thus ratified, and all Aſia on this ſide Mount Taurus delivered into the hands of the Romans, the Greek cities were by them reſtored to their liberty, the provinces of Caria and Lydia given to the Rhodians, and all the reſt that had belonged to Antiochus beſtowed upon Eumenes.</p><p>Antiochus did not long ſurvive his misfortune at Magneſia. Some tell us, that being greatly puzzled how to raiſe the ſum he had engaged to pay to the Romans, he ſeized on the riches which had for many ages been depoſited in a temple of Jupiter Belus in the province of Elymais ; upon which the populace roſe in arms, and slew him and all his attendants. Others inform us, that he was killed at an entertainment by one of his gueſts.</p><p>Antiochus the Great died in 187, and with him the glory of the Syrian empire. The Romans now gave laws to the kings of Syria, inſomuch, that when Antiochus Epiphanes the grandſon of Antiochus the Great hesitated at obeying the commands of the ſenate, one of the ambaſſadors drew a circle round him with a rod on the floor, and told him that he ſhould not go out of that ſpot before he had told him what he was to do. The moſt remarkable tranſactions of this prince are his wars with the Jews, and perſecutions of them ; of which a full account is given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Jews.</hi> After a variety of uſurpers and tyrants, the kingdom of Syria fell under Tigranes king of Armenia in the year 83 B. C. ; and upon his overthrow by the Romans, it became a province of the dominions of the republic. From them it was taken by the Saracens in the reign of the caliph Omar, and is now a province of Turkey in Aſia.</p><p>Syria is in ſome meaſure only a chain of mountains, varying in their levels, ſituation, and appearances. The part of the country, however, next the ſea is in general low, and beſides this there are ſeveral extenſive valleys. The climate on the ſea-coaſt and in theſe valleys is very hot, but in the higher parts of the country it bears a good deal of resemblance to that of France. Syria is exceedingly fertile, and the variety of its productions is very great. Beſides wheat, rye, barley, beans, and the cotton plant, which is cultivated everywhere, Paleſtine abounds in ſeſamum, from which oil is procured, and doura as good as that of Egypt. Maize thrives in the light ſoil of Balbec, and even rice is cultivated with ſucceſs on the borders of the marſhy country of Havula. They have lately begun to plant ſugarcanes in the gardens of Saide and of Bairout, and they find them equal to thoſe of the Delta. Indigo grows without cultivating on the banks of the Jordan, in the country of Biſan, and only requires care to make it of an excellent quality. The hill-ſides of Latakia produce tobacco. Gaza produces dates like Mecca, and pomegranates like Algiers ;<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Volney's Travels, vol. i.</p></note> Tripoli affords oranges equal to thoſe of Malta ; Bairout figs like thoſe of Marſeilles, and bananas not inferior to thoſe of St Domingo ; Aleppo enjoys the excluſive advantage of producing piſtachios ; and Damaſcus juſtly boaſts of poſſeſſing all the fruits known in our provinces. Its ſtony ſoil ſuits equally the apples of Normandy, the plums of Touraine, and the peaches of Paris. Twenty sorts of apricots are reckoned there, the ſtone of one of which contains a kernel highly valued through all Turkey. The cochineal plant, which grows on all that coaſt, contains perhaps that precious inſect in as high perfection as it is found in Mexico and St Domingo.</p><p>The inhabitants may be divided into three principal clasſes : the deſcendants of the Greeks of the Lower Empire ; the Arabs, their conquerors; and the Turks, the preſent ruling power: and theſe again, the first into three, the ſecond into four, classes ; beſides three wandering tribes of Turkomen, Curds, and Bedouin Arabs. The ancient inhabitants before the Greeks under Alexander are entirely loſt. The inhabitants are in general of a middling ſtature, and the eyes of the women almoſt everywhere beautiful, and their ſhape correct and well proportioned. The general language is Arabic. Syriac is a dead language.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
