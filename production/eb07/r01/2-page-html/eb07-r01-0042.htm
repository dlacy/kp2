<p><span class="font0">part of the fire-box and body of the boiler, by screws two inches apart. The wooden covering on the fire-box is&nbsp;finished to ⅞ -⅛ thick, and is made fast to the boiler by two&nbsp;hoops ; and round the fire door it is lined with thin sheet&nbsp;iron under the hoops ; the sheets being 6 feet long, and 2&nbsp;feet 3 inches broad, with a hole cut out for the furnace, and&nbsp;secured at the ends by screw nails 2 inches apart, to prevent&nbsp;the fire from burning the wood casing on the boiler. The casing on the barrel of the boiler is secured by four hoops, with&nbsp;a strip of brass under the fore-end hoop, about 2½ inches in&nbsp;breadth, to cover the ends of the lining and the rivet heads&nbsp;at the junction of the barrel of the boiler, and the smoke-box. The boiler is wrapped in at least three thicknesses&nbsp;of flannel all over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The lagging on the boiler is put together with iron feathers I by ⅛ ; the boiler is covered over the lagging with thin sheet lead, about 3½ feet broad along the top of the&nbsp;barrel. The smoke-box is No. 7 wire guage thick, and&nbsp;the chimney is No. 13 wire guage. The cover on the lockup safety valve is of brass, secured to the boiler ; there is a&nbsp;brass frame round the door of the smoke-box, and a brass&nbsp;handle to the small door in the middle of the large one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the pins of the joints are of steel, and hardened when practicable, but if not, they are steeled and hardened, and&nbsp;the working parts of the engine, which are of iron, are case-hardened. In making the boilers, the sharp edges of the&nbsp;rivet holes are taken off on both sides, and the rivets and&nbsp;rivet heads made to correspond. The engines are furnished with a wooden guard, and two leather buffers stuffed&nbsp;with cotton flock; and there are a draw-bar, draw-pin, and&nbsp;loop in the centre of the wooden guard, to connect them to&nbsp;the tender. They have three water guage cocks, and a glass&nbsp;water guage, with a lamp stand ; also a whistle, and a number plate on each side of the boiler ; and they are furnished&nbsp;with a complete set of screw-keys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the screws in all the engines correspond, for which purpose, either master taps, or sets of stocks and dies, at&nbsp;the option of other makers, are furnished them by Mr. Bury.&nbsp;They receive two coats of paint, and are finished with two&nbsp;coats of the best varnish. They are guaranteed for one&nbsp;month, or 1000 miles, during which trial, no other work is&nbsp;allowed but the tightening of cotters, and the very best&nbsp;workmanship and materials that can be produced, are in all&nbsp;cases rigidly insisted on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The framing of the tenders is of well-seasoned oak, or ash timber, thoroughly secured with iron knees and bolts,&nbsp;having an iron box, No. 7 wire guage thick, underneath, to&nbsp;carry the coke, which box is secured to the wooden frame.&nbsp;The tank contains 700 gallons of water. The wheels are&nbsp;of cast-iron, turned to receive a tire of either Bowling or&nbsp;Lowmoor iron, bored out to secure a perfect fit, and finished&nbsp;to l¼ inches thick. The axles are 3¼ inches in thickness, of&nbsp;the best hammered scrap iron ; and the journals are 2¼ inches&nbsp;in diameter, case-hardencd, with brass bushes and oil box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Steadiment for the axles consists of two plates, one outside, and the other inside the framing ; both of them&nbsp;being bolted through the framing, and secured together below, by a piece of iron between the plates for steadying the&nbsp;axle bushes. These are made completely parallel, and the&nbsp;bushes fitted into these so as to move up and down, but in&nbsp;no other direction. The tenders have buffers, a spring to&nbsp;which the load is attached, and also four springs by which&nbsp;they are supported, one over each oil box.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tank is No. 10 wire guage thick, having two brass cocks or valves, and rod handles with bushes for the top&nbsp;of the rods ; also two copper pipes, 1¾ inches in diameter, for&nbsp;carrying water from the tender to the engine. The tender&nbsp;frame and tank have two coats of paint inside and out, and&nbsp;two coats of varnish. They are fitted up with a brake, and&nbsp;furnished with a complete tool box ; a wire sieve in the main&nbsp;hole of the tank to prevent dirt or water from getting into&nbsp;the tank ; and two Macintosh hose pipes, one to each suction&nbsp;piece, with the necessary connexion to attach them to the&nbsp;engine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When water requires to be pumped from the tender into the boiler of the engine, previous to the starting of the train,&nbsp;it is the usual practice to run the engine backwards and forwards for a short distance, in order to work the force pumps.&nbsp;This increases the wear and tear both of the engine and the&nbsp;road, besides inducing a liability in a crowded station of running foul of something, if great care be not taken. The following contrivance will obviate the necessity of this inconvenient method of filling the boiler. A square pit should be&nbsp;sunk in some convenient part of the line, selected with reference to its intended use. This pit should be large enough&nbsp;to admit a pair of three-feet wheels fixed on an axle similar to&nbsp;the carriage wheels. There should be no flanges, and a part&nbsp;of the circumference Of these wheels should come up through&nbsp;the rails, which must be cut so as to admit them, additional&nbsp;chairs being put in to support the ends of the rails. This&nbsp;part of the circumference of the wheels thus becomes a part&nbsp;of the railway, the wheels being made to lock at pleasure ;&nbsp;but when the engine requires to pump water into the boiler,&nbsp;it must be brought with its driving wheels directly on those&nbsp;in the pit, and these latter being then unlocked, the steam&nbsp;is let gradually on, and the pumps worked as long as is found&nbsp;necessary to fill the boiler, without the engine advancing&nbsp;from the exact spot in which it was first placed, the only&nbsp;effect produced by the driving wheels of the engine, being&nbsp;to turn round the wheels fixed in the pit. When the boiler&nbsp;is filled, the pit wheels are locked, and the engine proceeds&nbsp;to the performance of her assigned duty. How much more&nbsp;advantageous this mode of filling the boiler is, will be readily seen, particularly when it is remembered that if engine-men&nbsp;are not looked well after, they will oil the driving wheels&nbsp;and the rails when in the engine-house, and then letting on&nbsp;the steam, fill their boiler by means of the wheels slipping&nbsp;round on the rails. We have often seen this carried to such&nbsp;an extent, that streams of sparks have been struck out by&nbsp;the attrition. When no better plan can be obtained, the engine should have one end lifted by screw-jacks, till the driving wheels are off the rails, and the steam may then be let&nbsp;on without any damage being done.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Caliban engine, made by Sharp, Roberts, and Company, of Manchester, drew 80 tons up an inclination of 1 in 180, on the Grand Junction Railway, for 3.<sup>1</sup>∣ miles, at 13¼&nbsp;miles per hour, at a steam pressure of 50 lbs. per square inch,&nbsp;and with a consumption of coke of 480 lbs. The average&nbsp;of 14 trips of three quarters of a mile each, up 1 in 90, from&nbsp;Euston Square to Camden Town, on the London and Birmingham railway, with the great engine made by Robert&nbsp;Stephenson and Company to work the trains up the inclination till the fixed engine was ready, amounted to 15 miles&nbsp;an hour, with 70 tons, viz. 14 carriages and 148 passengers,&nbsp;at a steam pressure of 50 lbs. per square inch. The average of 12 trips of 24¾ miles, up 1 in 440, on the Grand Junction Railway, with six engines, three made by Robert Stephenson and Company, and three by Sharp, Roberts, and&nbsp;Company, was 23¾ miles per hour, with a weight of 58 tons.&nbsp;The coke consumed was 864 lbs., and the steam power 48&nbsp;lbs. per square inch ; this coke, however, was very bad. The&nbsp;average of 14 trips of 23 miles, up 1 in 440, on the London&nbsp;and Birmingham line, with No. 16 engine, built by Mr. Hawthorn of Newcastle, was 22 miles an hour, with a gross weight,&nbsp;including the tender, of 70 tons. The coke consumed was&nbsp;486 lbs., and the steam pressure 48. The engine No. 7, on&nbsp;the London and Birmingham line, built by Mr. Bury of Liverpool, went 10 miles in ten minutes, 3d October 1838, with&nbsp;only one cylinder working, namely, from Hampton to Birmingham, being for 4½ miles, up 1 in 660, 3⅙ miles, up </span><span class="font1">1&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in 1370 ; the rest of the way was level, and the time included&nbsp;the getting up and slacking down the speed.</span></p>
