<p><span class="font1">returned to Bruſſels, and thence paffed over into Eng-' land in 1630 with a commiſſion from the Catholic king to negociate a peace between the two crowns. He&nbsp;was ſucceſsful in his negociation, and a treaty was concluded. Charles I. who then filled the Britiſh throne,&nbsp;could not receive Rubens in a public character on ac*&nbsp;count of his proſeſſion ; nevertheleſs, he treated him&nbsp;with every mark of reſpect. Having engaged him to&nbsp;paint ſome of the apartments of Whitehall, he not only&nbsp;gave him a handſome ſum of money, but, as an acknowledgment of his merit, created him a knight ; and the&nbsp;duke </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">Buckingham, his friend and patron, purchaſed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of him a collection of pictures, ſtatues, medals, and antiques, with the ſum ©f L. 10,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He returned to Spain, where be was magnificently honoured and rewarded for his ſervices. He was created a gentleman of ⅛the king’s bedchamber, and named&nbsp;ſecretary to the council of ſtate in the Netherlands.&nbsp;Rubens, however, did not lay aſide his proſeſſion. He&nbsp;returned to Antwerp, where he married a ſecond wife&nbsp;called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Helena Forment,</span><span class="font1"> who, being an eminent beauty,&nbsp;helped him much in the figures of his women. He&nbsp;died on 30th May 1640, in the 63d year of his age ;&nbsp;leaving vaſt riches to his children. Albert his eldeſt ſon&nbsp;ſucceeded him in the office of ſecretary of ſtate in Flan-ders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As Rubens was poſſeſſed of all the ornaments and advantages that render a man worthy to be eſteemed or&nbsp;courted, he was always treated as a perſon of conſequence. His figure was noble, his manners engaging,&nbsp;and his converſation lively ; his learning was univerſal.&nbsp;Though his favourite ſtudy muſt have occupied him&nbsp;much, yet he found time to read the works of the moſt&nbsp;celebrated authors, and eſpecially the poets. He ſpoke&nbsp;ſeveral languages perfectly, and was an excellent ſtates-man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His houſe at Antwerp was enriched with everything in the arts that was rare and valuable. It contained&nbsp;one ſpacious apartment, in imitation of the rotunda at&nbsp;Rome, adorned with a choice collection of pictures&nbsp;which he had purchaſed in Italy; part of which he fold&nbsp;to the duke of Buckingham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His genius qualified him to excel equally in every thing that can enter into the compoſition of a picture.&nbsp;His invention was ſo fertile, that, if he had occaſion to&nbsp;paint the ſame ſubject ſeveral times, his imagination always ſupplied him with ſomething ſtriking and new.&nbsp;The attitudes of his figures are natural and varied, the&nbsp;carriage of the head is peculiarly graceful, and his ex-preffion noble and animated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He is by all allowed to have carried the art of colouring to its higheſt pitch; he underſtood ſo thoroughly the true principles of the chiaro-ſcuro, that he gave to&nbsp;his figures the utmoſt harmony, and a prominence reſembling real life. His pencil is mellowed, his ſtrokes bold&nbsp;and eaſy, his carnation glows with life, and his drapery&nbsp;is ſimple, but grand, broad, and hung with much ſkill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The great excellence of Rubens appears in his grand compoſitions; for as they are to be viewed at a diſtance,&nbsp;he laid on a proper body of colours with uncommon&nbsp;boldneſs, and fixed all his tints in their proper places ;&nbsp;ſo that he never impaired their luſtre by breaking or&nbsp;torturing them ; but touched them in ſuch a manner as&nbsp;to give them a laſting force, beauty, and harmony.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">It is generally allowed, that Rubens wanted correct-</span></h2>
<p><span class="font1">neſs in drawing and deſigning ; ſome of his figures being heavy and too ſhort, and the limbs in ſome parts not being juſtly ſketched in the outline. Though he&nbsp;had ſpent ſeven years in Italy in ſtudying thoſe antiques&nbsp;by which other celebrated artiſts had modelled their taſte;&nbsp;though he had examined them with ſuch minute attention&nbsp;as not only to perceive their beauties, but to be qualified&nbsp;to deſcribe them in a Diſſertation which he wrote on&nbsp;that ſubject : yet he ſeems never to have diverted htm-ielſ oſ that heavy ſtyle of painting, which, being pe-culiar to his native country, he had inſenfibly acquired.&nbsp;The aſtoniſhing rapidity too with which he painted,&nbsp;made him fall into inaccuracies, from which thoſe works&nbsp;that he ſiniſhed with care are entirely exempted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among his finiſhed pieces may be mentioned the Crucifixion of Jeſus Chriſt between the two Thieves,&nbsp;which was very lately to be ſeen at Antwerp·; but of&nbsp;all his works the. paintings in the palace^of Luxemburg beſt diſplay his genius and his ſtyle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is the obſervation of Algarotti, that he was more moderate in his movements than Tintoretto, and more&nbsp;ſoft in his chiaro-ſcuro than Carravaggio ; but not ſo&nbsp;rich in his compoſitions, nor ſo light in his touches, as&nbsp;Paolo Veroneſe ; in his carnations leſs true than Titian,&nbsp;and leſs delicate than Vandyck. Yet he contrived to&nbsp;give his colours the utmoſt tranſparency and harmony,&nbsp;notwithſtanding the extraordinary deepneſs of them ;&nbsp;and he had a ſtrength and grandeur of ſtyle entirely&nbsp;his own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUBIA, madder : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the tetrandria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 47th order, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stellate</span><span class="font1"> The corolla is monopetalous and campanulated;&nbsp;and there are two monoſpermous berries. There are&nbsp;three ſpecies, of which the moſt remarkable is the tinc-torum, or dyer’s madder, ſo much uſed by the dyer’s&nbsp;and callico-printers. This hath a perennial root and&nbsp;annual ſtalk: the root is compoſed of many long, thick,&nbsp;ſucculent fibres, almoſt as large as a man’s little finger;&nbsp;theſe are joined at the top in a head like aſparagus,&nbsp;and run very deep into the ground. From the upper&nbsp;part, or head of the root, come out many ſide-roots,&nbsp;which extend juſt under the ſurface of the ground to&nbsp;a great diſtance, whereby it propagates very faſt ; for&nbsp;theſe ſend up a great number of ſhoots, which, if carefully taken off in the ſpring ſoon after they are above&nbsp;ground, become ſo many plants. Theſe roots are of a&nbsp;reddiſh colour, ſomewhat tranſparent ; and have a yel-lowiſh pith in the middle, which is tough and of a bit-teriſh taſte. From this root ariſe many’ large four-cornered jointed ſtalks, which, in good land, wall grow&nbsp;live or ſix feet long, and, if ſupported, ſometimes ſeven&nbsp;or eight: they are armed with ſhort herbaceous prickles;&nbsp;and at each joint are placed five or ſix ſpear-ſhaped&nbsp;leaves: their upper ſurfaces are ſmooth: but their midrib on the under ſide is armed with rough herbaceous&nbsp;ſpines, and the leaves fit cloſe to the branches in whorls.&nbsp;From the joints of the ſtalk come out the branches,&nbsp;wſhich ſuſtain the flowers : they .are placed by pairs oppoſite ; each pair croffing the other : theſe have a few&nbsp;ſmall leaves towaιd the bottom, which are by threes,&nbsp;and upwards by pairs oppoſite : the branches are terminated by looſe branching ſpikes of yellow flowers,&nbsp;which are cut into four parts reſembling ſtars. Theſe&nbsp;appear in June, and are ſometimes ſucceeded by ſeeds,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
