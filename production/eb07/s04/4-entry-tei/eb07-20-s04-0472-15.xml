 a Spanish writer, of an ancient and illustrious family, was born at Placentia, in Old Castile, on the 18th of July 1610. He was intended for the law ; but his inclination toward poetry prevailed, and he culti- vated it with great success. Philip IV. of Spain made him one of his secretaries ; and after the king’s death, the queen-regent appointed him historiographer of the Indies, a place of great profit and honour. His history of the conquest of Mexico, shows that she could not have named a fitter person. “ Historia de la Conquista de Mexico." Madrid, 1684, fol. He is better known by this history, than by his poetry and dramatic writings, though in these he was also distinguished. At the age of fifty-six he took orders. He died at Madrid on the 19th of April 1686.<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0540.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s04-0473"/>
