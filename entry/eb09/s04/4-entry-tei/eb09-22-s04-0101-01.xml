On the latter hill there stood till the fire of 1810 a medi√¶val fortress, and previous to the 15th century it contained a Latin church of traditional celebrity. The lower town along the river consists of modern houses, mostly erected since 1870, and is the scene of busy commercial life, especially during the</p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s04-0102" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0118.jp2"/><p>grain-export season. The principal church, completed in 1867, is a large and costly building with an imposing dome. Sistova was one of the first of the Bulgarian towns to introduce the national language into its schools (1833), some of which are now well-endowed and flourishing. More than half the inhabitants, who numbered 11,560 in 1881, are Bulgarians, the rest being Turks, Walachians, and Gipsies.</p><p>Sistova is identified with the old Roman colony <hi rend="italic">Novas</hi> mentioned by Ptolemy and others. The exact site appears to have been Staklen, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> cluster of vineyards with remains of ancient buildings to the west of the present town, which has gradually moved eastward since the 16th century, when it was reduced by the Turkish wars to a miserable village. It was at Sistova that the peace of 1790 was signed, by which the Austrian-Turkish boundary was determined. The town was burned in 1810 by the Russian general Saint Priest ; but subsequent to 1820 it began to revive, and the introduction of steam traffic on the lower Danube (1835) restored its prosperity in spite of the effects of the Russian war of 1828-29, when the Walachian town of Alexandria was founded by fugitives from Sistova. In 1877 the Russians entered Bulgaria by passing the river just below Sistova.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
