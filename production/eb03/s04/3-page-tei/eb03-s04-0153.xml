Solon died in the iſland of Cyprus, about the 80th year of his age. Statues were erected to his memory both at Athens and Salamis. His thirſt after knowledge continued to the laſt : “ I grow old (ſaid he) learning many things.” Among the apothegms and precepts which have been aſcribed to Solon, are the following : Laws are like cobwebs, that entangle the weak, but are broken through by the ſtrong. He who has learned to obey, will know how to command. In all things let reaſon be your guide. Diligently contemplate excellent things. In every thing that you do, conſider the end.</p><p>SOLSTICE, in aſtronomy, that time when the ſun is in one of the ſolſtitial points ; that is, when he is at his greateſt diſtance ſrom the equator ; thus called becauſe he then appears to ſtand ſtill, and not to change his diſtance from the equator for ſome time; an appearance owing to the obliquity of our ſphere, and which thoſe living under the equator are ſtrangers to.</p><p>The ſolſtices are two in each year ; the æstival or ſummer ſolſtice, and the hyemal or winter ſolſtice. The ſummer ſolſtice is when the sun ſeems to deſcribe the tropic of cancer, which is on June 22. when he makes the longeſt day : the winter ſolstice is when the ſun enters the firſt degree, or ſeems to deſcribe the tropic of capricorn, which is on December 22. when he makes the ſhorteſt day. This is to be underſtood as in our northern hemisphere ; for in the ſouthern, the ſun’s entrance into capricorn makes the ſummer ſolſtice, and that into cancer the winter ſolſtice. The two points of the ecliptic, wherein the ſun’s greateſt aſcent above the equator, and his deſcent below it, are terminated, are called the solst<hi rend="italic">itial points ;</hi> and a circle, ſuppoſed to paſs through the poles of the world and theſe points, is called the <hi rend="italic">ſolſtitial colure.</hi> The ſummer ſolſtitial point is in the beginning of the firſt degree of cancer, and is called the aestival or <hi rend="italic">ſummer point</hi> ; and the winter ſolſtitial point is in the beginning of the firſt degree of capricorn, and is called the <hi rend="italic">winter point.</hi> Theſe two points are diametrically oppoſite to each other.</p><p>SOLUTION, in chemiſtry, denotes an intimate union of ſolid with fluid bodies, ſo as to form a tranſparent liquor.

He was educated at Oxford, and afterwards entered himſelf at the Middle- Temple, where he ſtudied the law with great vigour. In 1688 he was one of the counſel for the ſeven biſhops at their trial, and argued with great learning and eloquence againſt the diſpenſing power. In the convention which met by the prince of Orange’s ſummons, January 22. 1689, he repreſented Worceſter ; and was one of the managers for the Houſe of Commons, at a conference with the Houſe of Lords upon the word <hi rend="italic">abdicated. </hi>Soon after the acceſſion of King William and Queen Mary to the throne, he was appointed ſolicitor-general, and received the honour of knighthood. In 1692 he was made attorney general, and in 1693 advanced to the poſt of lord keeper of the great ſeal of England. In 1695 he propoſed an expedient to prevent the practice of clipping the coin. In 1697 he was created lord Somers, baron of Eveſham, and made lord high chancellor of England. In the beginning of 1700 he was removed from his poſt of lord chancellor, and the year after was impeached of high crimes and miſdemeanors by the Houſe of Commons, of which he was acquitted upon trial by the Houſe of Lords. He then retired to a ſtudious courſe of life, and was choſen preſident of the Royal Society. In 1706 he propoſed a bill for the regulation of the law ; and the ſame year was one of the principal managers for the union between England and Scotland. In 1708 he was made lord preſident of the council; from which poſt he was removed in 1710, upon the change of the miniſtry. In the latter end of Queen Anne’s reign his lordſhip grew very infirm in his health ; which is ſuppoſed to be the reaſon that he held no other poſt than a ſeat at the council-table, after the acceſſion of King George I. He died of an apoplectic fit in 1716. Mr Addiſon has drawn his character very beautifully in the Freeholder.</p><p>SOMERSETSHIRE, a county of England, taking its name from Somerton, once the capital, between 50⁰ and 51⁰ 27' north latitude, and between 1⁰ 25' and 2⁰ 59' weſt longitude. It is bounded on the west by Devonſhire, on the ſouth by Dorſetſhire, on the north by Briſtol Channel or the Severn Sea, on the north-eaſt by a ſmall part of Glouceſterſhire, and on the eaſt by Wiltſhire. It is one of the largeſt counties in England, extending in length from eaſt to weſt about 68 miles ; in breadth, where breadeſt, from ſouth to north, about 47 ; and 240 in circumference. It is divided into 42 hundreds, in which are 3 cities, 32 market towns, 1700 villages, 385 pariſhes of which 132 are vicarages, containing more than 1,000,000 of acres, and about 300,000 ſouls. It sends 18 members to Parliament, viz. two for the county, two for Briſtol, two for Bath, two for Wells, two forTaunton, two for Bridgewater, two for Ilcheſter, two for Milbourn-port, and two for Minehead.</p><p>The air of this county is very mild and wholeſome, eſpecially that of the hilly part. The ſoil in general is exceeding rich, ſo that ſingle acres very commonly produce forty or fifty buſhels of wheat, and there have been inſtances of ſome producing sixty of barley. As there is very fine paſture both for ſheep and black cattle, it abounds in both, which are as large as thoſe of</p></body></text></TEI>
