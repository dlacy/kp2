<p><span class="font0">Whilst corn and cattle constitute the riches of the central districts, the southern abound in productions of a more precious or delicate nature. The peninsula of Crimea is&nbsp;adapted, by climate and soil, for all the productions of Italy&nbsp;and Greece, and here, indeed, many of them are indigenous. Government has taken a most lively interest in developing the resources of each district of the empire ; and&nbsp;in consequence of this the cultivation of the vine, an indigenous plant, and the mulberry tree and sugar-cane, has been&nbsp;carried to a considerable extent. In 1835 there were planted in Crimea 1,454,000 feet of vines, the annual produce&nbsp;of which, in a few years, will be at least 75,000 vedros, or&nbsp;250,000 gallons. The vine cultivation is extending with&nbsp;great success in the south, in the governments of Astra-can, Kherson, Podolia, the country of the Don Cossacks,&nbsp;and especially in the Taurida. In 1837, 1,150,000 vedros&nbsp;of wine were produced, and 1,300,000 to be distilled ; while&nbsp;in 1836 the whole quantity was not more than 800,000&nbsp;vedros. The mulberry tree has been as carefully attended to as the vine, and the result has been, upon the whole,&nbsp;favourable. Vast plantations of mulberries have been formed near all the principal towns of the southern districts.&nbsp;Every encouragement is held out to planters by the government. In Crimea and the countries of the Caucasus, the&nbsp;rearing of the silk-worm is likewise rapidly advancing. Experiments have also been made to cultivate sugar-cane and&nbsp;indigo ; but it is doubtful if they will succeed. The corktree was transplanted from Portugal to the Crimea in 1817,&nbsp;but we see no notice of it in recent works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Southern Russia, a region whose climate differs little from that of Asia Minor, we find a similar abundance and&nbsp;variety of fruits and vegetables. The flora of Russia is&nbsp;very abundant in the south. As Pallas informs us, the&nbsp;country presents the most enchanting aspect. On the&nbsp;mountain side, in the valley, in the forest, everywhere, the&nbsp;earth is clothed with a profusion of the loveliest flowers, and&nbsp;aromatic herbs, whose delicate odours embalm all the surrounding atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russia further produces hops (not sufficient for home consumption), and tobacco, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nicotiana paniculata,</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;which the young leaves are gradually removed, dried in the&nbsp;<sub>t</sub> shade, and buried beneath hay-ricks, where they become&nbsp;of a brownish-yellow colour. Of garden vegetables there&nbsp;are the usual varieties found in Europe. Spanish pepper&nbsp;is raised on the Samara and Lower Volga ; poppy in Char-kov, where it yields a return of a hundred and sixty fold ;&nbsp;rhubarb, which grows wild in Taurida ; rhapontick, which&nbsp;grows wild in the Urals; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">polygonum minus,</span><span class="font0"> which in&nbsp;the Ukraine engenders worms that yield a beautiful crimson dye used as paint by the Cossack women. Genuine&nbsp;turpentine might be collected to a great extent. Many&nbsp;plants useful for dyeing are produced in a wild state ; and&nbsp;for tanning there are several valuable plants. In short, the&nbsp;Crimea presents great facilities for rendering this a lucrative&nbsp;branch of manufacture. It only remains to be stated with&nbsp;regard to the vegetation of Russia, that in the south there&nbsp;is abundance of excellent food for cattle, consisting not&nbsp;only of a great variety of grasses, but also of the best vegetables recommended for artificial meadows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The quadrupeds of Russia are numerous. Some appear to be peculiar to the country, but our business is chiefly&nbsp;with the domesticated animals. Cattle of every description are bred in vast numbers in the steppes, and they have&nbsp;increased with the improvement of agriculture. Black&nbsp;cattle and oxen are raised as far north as the sixty-fourth&nbsp;parallel, especially in Podolia and the Ukraine. Some of&nbsp;the calves of the latter territory weigh from 480 to 600&nbsp;lbs. Sheep are reared to a great extent, there being supposed to be between sixty and seventy millions of these&nbsp;useful animals in different parts of the country. In Taurida a poor Tartar may have in his possession 1000, and&nbsp;a rich Tartar 50,000. The Merino breed of sheep has&nbsp;been naturalized in Little Russia, in the governments comprised under the name of New Russia on the south and&nbsp;east, and in those of the shores of the Baltic Sea. These&nbsp;different regions, so remote from one another, are too dissimilar to enjoy precisely the same advantages ; nevertheless, the perseverance and judicious management of the cultivators have been crowned with success. Even in those&nbsp;districts least favoured by nature rapid improvement has&nbsp;been made. In 1826 the exports of wool from Odessa&nbsp;were only 18,000 poods, valued at ten roubles each ; in&nbsp;1835 they were 116,000 poods, the price being advanced to thirty roubles per pood. At Taganrog the exports&nbsp;have increased in the same proportion ; and in Little Russia this branch of commerce is acquiring fresh activity.&nbsp;The wool trade is now also cultivated in Siberia, where&nbsp;a wool-company was established in 1832. In fine, Russia, lately so poor in this species of produce that even in&nbsp;1824 her exports did not exceed annually 35,000 poods,&nbsp;valued at only 600,000 roubles, in 1834 sold 281,450 poods,&nbsp;the value of which amounted to 1,557,066 roubles. This&nbsp;is of course independently of the demands for the cloth&nbsp;manufactories in the interior, which have increased to a&nbsp;very great extent. The report of the minister of the interior for 1837 states the extensive advancement made in&nbsp;agricultural industry, and the improvement of the breeds of&nbsp;cattle and sheep, especially the great increase in the number of Merino sheep in New Russia, as well as in Esthonia,&nbsp;Livonia, and Courland. Amongst the animals are horses of&nbsp;very different races, to improve the breed of which, races&nbsp;have been instituted ; goats, from the silken hair of some&nbsp;of which animals the celebrated Cashmere shawls are woven ;&nbsp;camels in the warm and saline steppes of Taurida and&nbsp;Kherson ; asses, which are especially domesticated in Taurida ; swine ; rein-deer, so valuable in the north ; the buffalo, and others. Amongst useful insects there are bees,&nbsp;which yield an abundance of honey and wax for exportation. There are many wild animεils, the skins or furs of&nbsp;which constitute important items of trade in the northern&nbsp;parts of Russia ; and abundance of others, whose flesh is&nbsp;useful as food. Birds are very numerous, including field&nbsp;and water game of various kinds. Fish abound in the seas,&nbsp;lakes, and rivers ; and the fishcries constitute an important&nbsp;branch of productive industry, as will be afterwards shown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">European Russia consists of’a variety of countries, viz. that part improperly termed Muscovy, which is Russia strictly so<sup>i&nbsp;</sup>called, and forms the nucleus of the empire ; the country of&nbsp;the Cossacks of the Don and of the Black Sea ; the king- '&nbsp;doms of Kazan and Astracan, wrested from the Tartars ;&nbsp;Biarmia ; the greater part of Lapland ; Ingria, Karelia, Finland, Astrobothnia, Esthonia, Livonia, the archipelagos of&nbsp;Abo and Aland, and the islands of Dago, Oesel, &amp;c., countries formerly appendages of the Swedish crown ; the largest&nbsp;portion of the once independent kingdom of Poland, comprising the governments of Vitebsk, Moghilev, Minsk, Vol-hynia, Grodno, Vilna, Podolia, the province of Bialystok,&nbsp;and the new kingdom of Poland ; the former khanate of the&nbsp;Crimea, with Little Tartary, Bessarabia, and part of Moldavia, territories conquered from the Ottoman empire ; and&nbsp;the region beyond the Caucasus, wrested from the natives,&nbsp;Turks, and Persians. “ The Russian government,” says&nbsp;Balbi, “ does not recognise the distinction made by geographers betwixt Russia in Europe, Russia in Asia, and&nbsp;Russia in America. The first two are blended in several&nbsp;governments. For instance, Perm and Orenburg, being traversed by the Urals, have one part of their territory in Europe and another in Asia. However, having determined&nbsp;the boundaries of Europe by the crest of the Urals and</span></p>
