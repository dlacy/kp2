                <p>The authenticity of the Old Teſtament may be pro ved from the character of the
                    Jews, from internal evidence, and from teſtimony.</p>
                <p>I. The character of the Jews affords a ſtrong preſumptive evidence that they have
                    not forged or corrupted the Old Teſtament. Were a perſon brought before a court
                    of juſtice on a ſuſpicion of forgery, and yet no preſumption or poſitive
                    evidence of his guilt could be produced, it would be allowed by all that he
                    ought to be acquitted. But farther, if the forgery alleged were inconſiſtent
                    with the character of the accuſed; if it tended to expoſe to diſgrace and
                    reproach his general principles and conduct; or if we were aſſured that be
                    conſidered forgery as an impious and abominable crime—it would require very
                    ſtrong teſtimony to eſtabliſh his guilt. The cafe now mentioned correſponds
                    exactly with the character and ſituation of the Jews. If a Jew had forged any
                    book of the Old Teſtament, he muſt have been impelled to ſo bold and dangerous
                    an enterpriſe by ſome very powerful motive. It could not be national pride, for
                    there is ſcarcely one of there books which does not ſeverely cenſure the
                    national manners. It could not be the love of fame; for that paſſion would have
                    taught him to flatter and extol the national character; and the puniſhment, if
                    detected, would have been infamy and death. The love of wealth could not produce
                    ſuch a forgery; for no wealth was to be gained.</p>
                <p>The Jews were ſelected from the other nations of the world, and preſerved a
                    diſtinct people from the time of their emigration from Egypt to the Babyloniſh
                    captivity, a period of 892 years. The principal purpoſes for which they were
                    ſelected was to preſerve in a world running headlong into idolatry the knowledge
                    and worſhip of the one true God, and to be the guardians of thoſe ſacred books
                    that contained the prophecies which were to prove to future ages the divine
                    miſſion of the Redeemer of mankind. To fit them for theſe important trufts, the
                    ſpirit of their laws and the rites of their religion had the ſtrongeſt tendency.
                    Miracles were openly performed, to convince them that the God of Iſrael was the
                    God of all the earth, and that he alone was to be worſhipped. Public calamities
                    always befel them when they became apoſtates to their God; yet they continued
                    violently attached to idolatry till their captivity in Babylon made them for
                    ever renounce it.</p>
                <p>The Jews then had two oppoſite characters at different periods of their hiſtory:
                    At firſt they were addicted to idolatry; afterwards they acquired a ſtrong
                    antipathy againſt it.</p>
                <p>Had any books of the Old Teſtament been forged before the Babyloniſh captivity,
                    when the Jews were devoted to idolatry, is it to be conceived that the impoſtor
                    would have inveighed ſo ſtrongly againſt this vice, and ſo often imputed to it
                    the calamities of the ſtate; ſince by ſuch conduct he knew that he would render
                    himſelf obnoxious to the people and to thoſe idolatrous monarchs who perſecuted
                    the prophets?</p>
                <p>But it may next be ſuppoſed, that “the ſacred books were forged after the
                    Babyloniſh captivity, when the principles of the Jews would lead them to inveigh
                    againſt the worſhip of idols. But theſe principles would ſurely never lead them
                    to expoſe the character of their anceſtors, and to detail their follies and
                    their crimes. Never had any people more national pride, or a higher veneration
                    for their anceſtors, than the Jews. Miracles and prophecies ceaſed ſoon after
                    their return to Jeruſalem; and from that period their reſpect for the ſacred
                    books approached to ſuperſtition. They preſerved them with pious care, they read
                    them often in their ſynagogues, and they conſidered every attempt to alter the
                    text as an act of ſacrilege. Is it poſſible that ſuch men could be guilty of
                    forgery, or could falſe "writings be eaſily impoſed on them?</p>
                <p>2. There is an internal evidence in the books of the Old Teſtament that proves
                    them to have been written by different perſons, and at diſtant periods; and
                    enables us with preciſion to aſcertain a time at or before which they muſt have
                    been compoſed. It is an undeniable fact that Hebrew ceaſed to be the living
                    language of the Jews during the Babyloniſh captivity, and that the Jewiſh
                    productions after that period were in general written either in Chaldee or in
                    Greek. The Jews of Paleſtine, ſome ages before the coming of our Saviour, were
                    unable, without the aſſiſtance of a Chaldee para- phraſe, to underſtand the
                    Hebrew original. It neceſſarily follows, therefore, that every book which is
                    written in pure Hebrew was compoſed either before or about the time of the
                    Babyloniſh captivity. This being admitted, we may advance a ſtep farther, and
                    contend that the period which elapſed between the compoſition of the moſt
                    ancient and the moſt modern book of the Old Teſtament was very conſiderable; or,
                    in other words, that the moſt ancient books of the Old Teſtament were written
                    many ages before the Babyloniſh captivity.</p>
                <p>No language continues ſtationary; and the Hebrew, like other tongues, paſſed
                    through the ſeveral ſtages of infancy, youth, manhood, and old age. If
                    therefore, on compariſon, the ſeveral parts of the Hebrew Bible are found to
                    differ not only in regard to ſtyle, but alſo in regard to character and
                    cultivation, we have ſtrong internal marks that they were compoſed at different
                    and diſtant periods. No claſſical ſcholar would believe, independent of the
                    Grecian hiſtory, that the poems aſcribed to Homer were written in the age of
                    Demoſthenes, the Orations of Demoſthenes in the time of Origen, or the
                    Commentaries of Origen in the time of Daſcaris and Chryſhloras. For the very
                    ſarne reaſon, it is certain that the five books which arc aſcribed to Moſes were
                    not written in the time of David, the Pſalins of David in the age of Iſaiah, nor
                    the prophecies of Iſaiah in the time of Malachi; and ſince the Hebrew became a
                    dead language about the time of the Babyloniſh captivity, the book of Malachi
                    could not have been written much later. Before that period there- fore were
                    written the prophecies of lſaiah, ſtill earlier the Pſalms of David, and much
                    earlier than theſe the books which are aſcribed to Moſes.<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0114.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0108"/> 3. Let us now
                    conſider the evidence of teſtimony for the authenticity of the Old Teſtament. As
                    the Jews were a more ancient people than the Greeks or Romans, and for many ages
                    totally unconnected with them, it is not to be expected that we ſhould derive
                    much evidence from the hiſtorians of thoſe nations: it is to the Jews alone we
                    muſt look for information. But it has unfortunately happened that few of their
                    works except the Scriptures themſelves have been preſerved to poſterity.
                    Joſephus is the moſt ancient of the Jewiſh hiſtorians to whom we can appeal. He
                    informs us, that the Old Teſtament was divided into three parts, the Law, the
                    Prophets, and the Hagiographa or poetical books. No man, ſays he, hath ever
                    dared to add or take away from them. He tells us alſo, that other books were
                    written after the time of Artaxerxes; but as they were not compoſed by prophets,
                    they were not reckoned worthy of the ſame credit.</p>
                <p>Since the promulgation of the Chriſtian religion, it is impoſſible that any
                    material alterations or corruptions could have taken place in the books of the
                    Old Teſtament; for they have been in the hands both of Jews and Chriſtians from
                    that period. Had the Jews attempted to make any alterations, the Chriſtians
                    would have detected and expoſed them; nor would the Jews have been leſs ſevere
                    againſt the Chriſtians if they had corrupted the ſacred text. But the copies in
                    the hands of Jews and Chriſtians agree; and therefore we juſtly conclude, that
                    the Old Teſtament is ſtill pure and uncorrupted.</p>
                <p>The diviſion mentioned by our Saviour into the Law, the Prophets, and the Pſalms,
                    correſponds with that of Joſephus. We have therefore ſufficient evidence, it is
                    hoped, to convince even a deiſt, that the Old Teſtament exiſted at that time.
                    And if the deiſt will only allow, that Jeſus Chriſt was a perſonage of a
                    virtuous and irreproachable character, he will acknowledge that we draw a fair
                    concluſion when we aſſert that the Scriptures were not corrupted in his time:
                    for wſhen he accuſed the Phariſees of making the law of no effect by their
                    traditions, and when he injoined his hearers to ſearch the Scriptures, he could
                    not have failed to mention the corruptions or forgeries of Scripture, if any in
                    that age had exiſted. But we are aſſured, by very respectable authority, that
                    the canon of the Old Teſtament was fixed ſome centuries before the birth of
                    Jeſus Chriſt. Jeſus the ſon of Sirach, the author of Eccleſiaſticus, makes
                    evident references to the prophecies of Iſaiah<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Ecclesiasticus xlviii.
                        22.</p></note> *, Jeremiah<note anchored="true" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>† xlix. 6.</p></note> †, and Ezekiel<note anchored="true" n="4" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>‡ xlix.
                        8.</p></note> ‡, and mentions theſe prophets by name. He ſpeaks alſo of the
                    twelve minor prophets<note anchored="true" n="5" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>[m] A. xlix. 10.</p></note> A. It appears alſo from the prologue,
                    that the law and the prophets, and other ancient books, exiſted at the ſame
                    period. The book of Eccleſiaſticus, according to the calculations of the beſt
                    chronologers, was written in Syriac about A. M. 3772, that is, 232 years before
                    the Chriſtian era, and was tranſlated into Greek in the next century by the
                    grandſon of the author. The prologue was added by the tranſlator: but this
                    circumſtance does not diminiſh the evidence for the antiquity of Scripture; for
                    he informs us, that the law and the prophets, and the other books of their
                    fathers, were ſtudied by his grandfather: a ſufficient proof that they exiſted
                    in his time. As no authentic books of a more ancient date, except the ſacred
                    writings themſelves, have reached our time, we can aſcend no higher in ſearch of
                    teſtimony.</p>
                <p>There is, however, one remarkable hiſtorical fact, which proves the exiſtence of
                    the law of Moſes at the diſſolution of the kingdom of Iſrael, when the ten
                    tribes were carried captive to Aſſyria by Shalmaneſer, and diſperſed among the
                    provinces of that extenſive empire; that is, about 741 years before Chriſt. It
                    was about that time the Samaritans were tranſported from Aſſyria to repeople the
                    country, which the ten captive tribes of Iſrael had formerly inhabited. The
                    poſterity of the Samaritans ſtill inhabit the land of their fathers, and have
                    preſerved copies of the Pcntateuch, two or three of which were brought to this
                    country in the laſt century. The Samaritan Pentateuch is written in old Hebrew
                    characters (fee <hi rend="smallcaps">Philology,</hi> n⁰ 28). and therefore muſt
                    have exiſted before the time of Ezra. But ſo violent were the animoſities which
                    ſubſiſted between the Jews and Samaritans, that in no period of their hiſtory
                    would the one nation have received any books from the other. They muſt therefore
                    have received them at their firſt ſettlement in Samaria from the captive prieſt
                    whom the Aſſyrian monarch ſent to teach them how they ſhould fear the Lord (2
                    Kings xvii.)</p>
                <p>The canon of the Old Teſtament, as both Jewiſh and Chriſtian writers agree, was
                    completed by Ezra and ſome of his immediate ſucceſſors (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Bible).</hi> In our copies the ſacred books are divided into 39. The Jews
                    reckoned only 22, correſponding to the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet.
                    They united the books of Judges and Ruth; they joined the two books of Samuel;
                    the books of Kings and Chronicles were reckoned one; Ezra and Nehemiah one; the
                    Prophecies and Lamentations of Jeremiah were taken under the ſame head; and the
                    12 minor prophets were conſidered as one book—ſo that the whole number of books
                    in the Jewiſh canon amounted to 22.</p>
                <p>The Pentateuch conſiſts of the five books Geneſis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
                    and Deuteronomy. Several obſervations have been already made reſpecting the
                    authenticity of theſe under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pentateuch;</hi>
                    but ſeveral additional remarks have occurred, which may not improperly be given
                    in this place. For many of theſe we acknowledge ourſelves indebted to a ſermon
                    publiſhed by the reverend Mr Marſh, whoſe reſearch and learning and critical
                    accuracy will be acknowledged by every reader of diſcernment.</p>
                <p>One of the ſtrongeſt arguments that have occurred to us in ſupport of the
                    authenticity of the Pentateuch, and the inſpiration of the writer, has already
                    been given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Religion,</hi> n⁰ 14,
                    &amp;c. which ſee: But we ſhall in this place preſent two arguments of a
                    different kind, which would be ſufficient to prove at leaſt the former of theſe
                    concluſions. We argue from the language and contents of the Moſaic writings, and
                    from the teſtimony of the other books of Scripture.</p>
                <p>From the contents and language of the Pentateuch there ariſes a very ſtrong
                    preſumption that Moſes was its author. The very mode of writing in the four laſt
                    books diſcovers an author contemporary with the events which he relates; every

                    interwoven with each other, that neither of them could have been written by a
                    man who lived in a later age. The account which is given in the book of Exodus
                    of the conduct of Pharaoh towards the children of Iſrael, is ſuch as might be
                    expected from a writer who was not only acquainted with the country at large,
                    but had frequent acceſs to the court of its ſovereign: and the minute
                    geographical deſcription of the paſſage thro’ Arabia is ſuch, as could have been
                    given only by a man like Moſes, who had ſpent 40 years in the land of Midian.
                    The language itſelf is a proof of its high antiquity, which appears partly from
                    the great ſimplicity of the ſtyle, and partly from the uſe of archaiſms or
                    antiquated expreſſions, which in the days even of David and Solomon were

                    to ſhow that the Pentateuch was written by a man born and educated in Egypt, is
                    the uſe of Egyptian words; words which never were, or ever could have been, uſed
                    by a native of Paleſtine: and it is a remarkable circumſtance, that the very
                    ſame thing which Moſes had expreſſed by a word that is pare Egyptian, Iſaiah, as
                    might be expected from his birth and education, has expreſſed by a word that is

                <p>That Moſes was the author of the Pentateuch is proved alſo from the evidence of
                    teſtimony. We do not here quote the authority of Diodorus Siculus, of Longinus,
                    or Strabo, becauſe their information muſt have been derived from the Jews. We
                    ſhall ſeek no authority but that of the ſucceeding ſacred books themſelves,
                    which bear internal evidence that they were written in different ages, and
                    therefore could not be forged unleſs we were to adopt the abſurd opinion that
                    there was a ſucceſſion of impoſtors among the Jews who united together in the
                    ſame fraud. The Jews were certainly beſt qualified to judge of the authenticity
                    of their own books. They could judge of the truth of the facts recorded, and
                    they could have no intereſt in adopting a forgery. Indeed, to ſuppoſe a whole
                    nation combined in committing a forgery, and that this combination ſhould
                    continue for many hundred years, would be the moſt chimerical ſuppoſition that
                    ever entered into the mind of man. Yet we muſt make this ſuppoſition, if we
                    reject the hiſtorical ſacts of the Old Teſtament. No one will deny that the
                    Pentateuch exiſted in the time of Chriſt and his apoſtles; for they not only
                    mention it, but quote it. “This we admit,” reply the advocates for the
                    hypotheſis which we are now combating; “but you cannot therefore conclude that
                    Moſes was the author; for there is reaſon to believe it was compoſed by Ezra.”
                    But unfortunately for men of this opinion, both Ezra and Nehemiah aſcribe the

                    in the time of Joſhua. One paſſage maybe quoted where this fact is ſtated. The
                    Divine Being makes uſe of theſe words to Joſhua: “Only be thou ſtrong, and very

                <p>To the foregoing demonſtration objections may be ſtated. “We will admit the force
                    of your arguments, and grant that Moſes actually wrote a work called the book of
                    the law; but how can we be certain that it was the very work which is now
                    current under his name? And unleſs you can ſhow this to be at leaſt probable,
                    your whole evidence is of no value.” To illuſtrate the force or weakneſs of this
                    objection, let us apply it to ſome ancient Greek author, and ſee whether a
                    claſſical ſcholar would allow it to be of weight. “It is true that the Greek
                    writers ſpeak of Homer as an ancient and celebrated poet; it is true alſo that
                    they have quoted from the works which they aſcribe to him various paſſages that
                    we find at preſent in the Iliad and Odyſſey: yet ſtill there is a poſſibility
                    that the poems wſhich were written by Homer, and thoſe which we call the <hi
                        rend="italic">Iliad and Odyſſey,</hi> were totally diſtinct productions” Now
                    an advocate for Greek literature would reply to this objection, not with a
                    ſerious anſwer, but with a ſmile of contempt; and he would think it beneath his
                    dignity to ſilence an opponent who appeared to be deaf to the cleareſt
                    conviction. But ſtill more may be ſaid in defence of Moſes than in defence of
                    Homer; for the writings of the latter were not depoſited in any temple or ſacred
                    archive, in order to ſecure them from the devaſtations of time; whereas the copy
                    of the book of the law, as written by Moſes, was intruſted to the prieſts and
                    the elders, preſerved in the ark of the covenant,<pb

                            of the covenant of the Lord, and unto all the elders of Iſrael. And
                            Moſes commanded them, ſaying, At the end of every ſeven years, in the
                            ſolemnity of the year of releaſe, in the feaſt of tabernacles, when all

                            ſhall chooſe, thou ſhalt read this law before all Iſrael in their
                            hearing. And it came to paſs, when Moſes had made an end of writing the
                            words of this law in a book until they were finiſhed, that Moſes
                            commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord,
                            laying, Take this book of the law, and put it in the ſide of the ark of

                    not only for the preſervation of the original record, but that no ſpurious
                    production ſhould be ſubſtituted in its ſtead. And that no ſpurious production
                    ever has been ſubſtituted in the ſtead of the original compoſition of Moſes,
                    appears from the evidence both of the Greek and the Samaritan Pentateuch. For as
                    theſe agree with the Hebrew, except in ſome trifling variations<note

                    it is abſolutely certain that the five books which we now aſcribe to Moſes are
                    one and the ſame work with that which was tranſlated into Greek in the time of
                    the Ptolemies, and, what is of ſtill greater importance, with that which exiſted
                    in the time of Solomon. And as the Jews could have had no motive whatſoever,
                    during that period which elapſed between the age <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    Joſhua and that of Solomon, for ſubſtituting a ſpurious production inſtead of
                    the original as written by Moſes, and, even had they been inclined to attempt
                    the impoſture, would have been prevented by the care which had been taken by
                    their lawgiver, we muſt conclude that our preſent Pentateuch is the very
                    identical work that was delivered by Moſes.</p>
                <p>The poſitive evidence being now produced, we ſhall endeavour to anſwer ſome
                    particular objections that have been urged. But as moſt of theſe occur in the
                    book of Geneſis, we ſhall reſerve them for ſeparate examination, and ſhall here
                    only conſider the objections peculiar to the four laſt books. They may be
                    compriſed under one head, viz. expreſſions and paffages in theſe books which
                    could not have been written by Moſes. I. The account of the death of Moſes, in
                    the laſt chapter of Deuteronomy, we allow muſt have been added by ſome
                    ſucceeding writer; but this can never prove that the book of Deuteronomy is
                    ſpurious. What is more common among ourſelves than to ſee an account of the life
                    and death of an author ſubjoined to his works, without informing us by whom the
                    narrative was written? 2. It has been objected, that Moſes always ſpeaks of
                    himſelf in the third perſon. This is the objection of fooliſh ignorance, and
                    therefore ſcarcely deferves an anſwer. We ſuſpect that ſuch perſons have never
                    read the claſſics, particularly Caeſar’s Commentaries, where the author
                    uniformly ſpeaks of himſelf in the third perſon, as every writer of correct
                    taſte will do who reflects on the abſurdity of employing the pronoun of the
                    ſirſt perſon in a work intended to be read long after his death. (See <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Grammar,</hi> n⁰ 33.) 3. As to the objection, that in ſome
                    places the text is defective, as in Exodus xv. 8. it is not directed againſt the
                    author, but againſt ſome tranſcriber; for what is wanting in the Hebrew is
                    inſerted in the Samaritan. 4. The only other objection that deſerves notice is
                    made from two paſſages. It is ſaid in one place that the bed of Og is at Ramah
                        <hi rend="italic">to this day;</hi> and in another (Deut. iii. 14.), “Jair
                    the ſon of Manaſſeh took all the country of Argob unto the coaſts of Geſhuri and
                    Maacathi, and called them after his own name, Baſhan-havoth-jair, <hi
                        rend="italic">unto this day.”</hi> The laſt clauſe in both theſe paſſages
                    could not have been written by Moſes, but it was probably placed in the margin
                    by ſome tranſcriber by way of explanation, and was afterwards by miſtake
                    inſerted in the text. Whoever doubts the truth of this aſſertion may have
                    recourſe to the manuſcripts of the Greek Teſtament, and he will find that the
                    ſpurious additions in the texts of ſome manuſcripts are actually written in the
                    margin of others<note anchored="true" n="16" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                                ><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(f) To</hi> mention only two examples.
                            1.The common reading, I Cor. xvi. 2. is μιαν σαΒΒατων; but the Codex
                            Pitavian 1 3. has την χυριαχην in the margin; and in one of the
                            manuſcripts which Beza used, this marginal addition has been obtruded in
                            the text. See his note on this paſſage. 2. Another inſtance is, I John
                            ii. 27. where the genuine reading is χρισμα; but Wetſtein quotes two
                            manuſcripts, in which τνευμα is written in the margin; and this marginal
                            reading has found its way not only into the Codex Covelli 2, but into
                            the Coptic and Ethiopic verſions.</p></note>

                <p>That the Pentateuch, therefore, at leaſt the four laſt books of it, was written
                    by Moſes, we have very ſatisfactory evidence; which, indeed, at the diſtance of
                    3000 years is wonderful, and which cannot be affirmed of any profane biſtory
                    written at a much later period.</p>
                <p>The book of Geneſis was evidently not written by a perſon who was contemporary
                    with the facts which he records; for it contains the hiſtory of 2369 years, a

                    hiſtorical books of the Old Teſtament put together. Moſes has been acknowledged
                    as the author of this book by all the ancient Jews and Chriſtians; but it has
                    been a matter of diſpute from what ſource he derived his materials; ſome
                    affirming that all the facts were revealed by inſpiration, and others
                    maintaining that he procured them from tradition.</p>
                <p>Some who have looked upon themſelves as profound philoſophere, have rejected many
                    parts of the book of Geneſis as fabulous and abſurd: but it cannot be the wiſdom
                    of philoſophy, but the vanity of ignorance, that could lead to ſuch an opinion.
                    In fact, the book of Geneſis affords a key to many difficulties in philoſophy
                    which cannot otherwiſe be explained. It has been ſuppoſcd that the diverſities
                    among mankind prove that they are not deſcended ſrom one pair; but it has
                        been<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0117.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0111"/> fully
                    ſhewn that all theſe diverſities may be accounted for by natural cauſes. It has
                    been reckoned a great difficulty to explain how foſſil ſhells were introduced
                    into the bowels of the earth; but the deluge explains this fact better than all
                    the romantic theories of philoſophers. It is impoſſible to account for the
                    origin of ſuch a variety of languages in a more ſatisfactory manner than is done
                    in the account of the confuſion of tongues which took place at Babel. It would
                    be no eaſy matter to ſhew why the ſea of Sodom is ſo different from every other
                    ſea on the globe which has yet been explored, if we had not poſſeſſed the
                    ſcriptural account of the miraculous deſtructiou of Sodom and Gomorrah. It is
                    ſaturated with bitumen and ſalt, and contains no fiſhes. Theſe are very Angular
                    facts, which have been fully eſtabliſhed by late travellers. The book of
                    Geneſis, too, has been treated with contempt, becauſe it makes the world leſs
                    ancient than is neceſſary to ſupport the theories of modern philoſophers, and
                    becauſe it is difficult to reconcile the chronologies of ſeveral nations with
                    the opinion that the world is not above 6000 or 7000 years old. The Chaldeans,
                    in the time of Cicero, reckoned up 470,000 years. The Egyptians pretend that
                    they have records extending 50,000 years back; and the Hindoos go beyond all
                    bounds of probability, carrying back their chronology, according to Halhed, more
                    than 7,000,000 of years.</p>
                <p>An attempt has been made by M. Bailly, lately mayor of Paris, to reconcile theſe
                    magnified calculations with the chronology of the Septuagint, which is juſtly
                    preferred to the Hebrew. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Septuagint.)</hi> He informs
                    us, that the Hindoos, as well as the Chaldeans and Egyptians, had years of
                    arbitrary determination. They had months of 15 days, and years of 60 days, or
                    two months. A month is a night and day of the patriarchs; a year is a night and
                    day of the gods; four thouſand years of the gods are as many hundred years of
                    men. By attention to ſuch modes of computation, the age of the world will be
                    found very nearly the ſame in the writings of Moſes, and in the calculations and
                    traditions of the Bramins. With theſe alſo we have a remarkable coincidence with
                    the Perſian chronology. Bailly has eſtabliſhed theſe remarkable epochas from the
                    Creation to the Deluge.</p>

                <p>Having made theſe few remarks, to ſhew that the facts recorded in Geneſis are not
                    inconſiſtent with truth, we ſhall now, by a few obſervations, confirm the
                    evidence, from teſtimony, that Moſes was the author, and anſwer the objections
                    that ſeem ſtrongeſt.</p>
                <p>There ariſes a great probability, from the book of Geneſis itſelf, that the
                    author lived near the time of Joſeph; for as we advance towards the end of that
                    book,</p>
                <p>the facts gradually become more minute. The materials of the antediluvian hiſtory
                    are very ſcanty. The account of Abraham is more complete; but the hiſtory of
                    Jacob and his family is ſtill more fully detailed. This is indeed the caſe with
                    every hiſtory. In the early part, the relation is very ſhort and general; but
                    when the hiſtorian approaches his own time, his materials accumulate. It is
                    certain, too, that the book of Geneſis muſt have been written before the reſt of
                    the Pentateuch; for the alluſions in the laſt four books to the hiſtory of
                    Abraham, of Iſaac, and Jacob, are very frequent. The ſimplicity of the ſtyle
                    ſhows it to be one of the moſt ancient of the ſacred books; and perhaps its
                    ſimilarity to the ſtyle of Moſes would determine a critic to aſcribe it to him.
                    It will be allowed, that no man was better qualified than Moſes to compoſe the
                    hiſtory of his anceſtors. He was learned in all the wiſdom of the Egyptians, the
                    moſt enlightened nation of his time, and he had the beſt opportunities of
                    obtaining accurate information. The ſhort account of the antediluvian world
                    could eaſily be remembered by Abraham, who might obtain it from Shem, who was
                    his contemporary. To Shem it might be conveyed by Methufelah, who was 340 years
                    old when Adam died. From Abraham to Moſes, the interval was leſs than 400 years.
                    The ſplendid promiſes made to that patriarch would certainly be carefully
                    communicated to each generation, with the concomitant facts: and thus the
                    hiſtory might be conveyed to Moſes by the moſt diſtinguiſhed perſons. The
                    accounts reſpecting Jacob and his ſon Joſeph might be given to Moſes by his
                    grandfather Kohath, who muſt have been born long before the deſcent to Egypt;
                    and Kohath might have heard all the facts reſpecting Abraham and Iſaac from
                    Jacob himſelf. Thus we can eaſily point out how Moſes might derive the materials
                    of the book of Geneſis, and eſpecially of the laſt 38 chapters, from the moſt
                    authentic ſource.</p>
                <p>It will now be neceſſary to conſider very ſhortly the objections that have been
                    ſuppoſed to prove that Geneſis could not have been written by Moſes. 1. It is
                    objected, that the author of the firſt chapters of Geneſis muſt have lived in
                    Meſopotamia, as he diſcovers a knowledge of the rivera that watered Paradiſe, of
                    the cities Babylon, Erech, Reſen, and Calneh; of the gold of Piſon; of the
                    bdellium and onyx ſtore. But if he could not derive this knowledge from the
                    wiſdom of the Egyptians, which is far from being improbable, he might ſurely
                    obtain it by tradition from Abraham, who was born and brought up beyond the
                    Euphrates. 2 <hi rend="italic">.</hi> In Geneſis xiv. 14. it is ſaid, Abraham
                    pursued the four confederate kings to Dan, yet that name was not given till
                    after the conqueſt of Paleſtine<note anchored="true" n="17" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Judges chap. xviii. 22.</p></note> *. We anſwer,
                    this might be inſerted by a tranſcriber. But ſuch a ſuppoſition is not
                    neceſſary; for though we are told in the book of Judges that a city originally
                    called Laiſh received then the name of Dan, this does not prove that Laiſh was
                    the ſame city with the Dan which is mentioned in Geneſis. The ſame anſwer may be
                    given to the objection which is brought from Geneſis xxxv. 21. where the tower
                    of Edar is mentioned, which the objectors ſay was the name of a tower over one
                    of the gates of Jeruſalem. But the tower of Edar ſignifies the tower of the
                    flocks, which in the paſtoral country of Canaan might be a very common name. 3.
                    The moſt formidable objection is derived from theſe two paſſages, Gen. xii.
                        6.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0118.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0112"/> "And
                    the Canaanite was then in the land.” Gen.xxxvi. 31. “Theſe are the kings that
                    reigned over the land of Edom, <hi rend="italic">before there reigned any king
                        over the children oſ Iſrael."</hi> Now, it is certain that neither of theſe
                    paſſages could be written by Moſes. We allow they were added by a later writer;
                    but this circumſtance cannot invalidate the evidence which has been already
                    produced. It does not prove that Moſes was not the author of the book of
                    Genefis, but only that the book of Geneſis has received two alterations ſince
                    his death.</p>
                <p>According to Rivet, our Saviour and his Apoſtles have cited 27 paſſages verbatim
                    from the book of Geneſis, and have made 38 alluſions to the ſenſe.</p>
                <p>The book of Exodus contains the hiſtory of the Iſraelites for about 145 years. It
                    gives an account of the ſlavery of the Iſraelites in Egypt; of the miracles by
                    which they were delivered; of their paſſage through the Red Sea, and journey
                    through the wilderneſs; of the ſolemn promulgation of the Decalogue on Mount
                    Sinai, and of the building and furniture of the Tabernacle. This book is cited
                    by David, by Daniel, and other ſacred writers. Twenty-five paſſages are quoted
                    by our Saviour and his apoſtles in expreſs words, and they make 19 alluſions to
                    the ſenſe.</p>
                <p>The book of Leviticus contains the hiſtory of the Iſraelites for one month. It
                    conſiſts chiefly of laws. Indeed, properly ſpeaking, it is the code of the
                    Jewiſh ceremonial and political laws. It deſcribes the conſecration of Aaron and
                    his ſons, the daring impiety and exemplary puniſhment of Nadab and Abihu. It
                    reveals alſo ſome predictions reſpecting the puniſhment of the Iſraelites in
                    caſe of apoſtacy; and contains an aſſurance that every ſixth year ſhould produce
                    abundance to ſupport them during the ſeventh or ſabbatical year. This book is

                    about 38 years, reckoning from the firſt day of the ſecond month after their
                    departure from Egypt. It contains an account of two numberings of the people;
                    the firſt in the beginning of the ſecond year of their emigration, the ſecond in
                    the plains of Moab towards the concluſion of their journey in the

                    elders, the miraculous cure performed by the brazen ſerpent, and the miſconduct
                    of Moſes when he was commanded to bring water from the rock. There is alſo added
                    an account of the death of Aaron, of the conqueſt of Sihon and Og, and the ſtory

                <p>The book of Deuteronomy comprehends a period of nearly two months. It conſiſts of
                    an intereſting addreſs to the Iſraelites, in which Moſes recals to their
                    remembrance the many inſtances of divine favour which they. had experienced, and
                    reproaches them for their ingratitude. He lays, before them, in a compendious
                    form, the laws which he had formerly delivered, and makes ſome explanatory
                    additions. This was the more neceſſary, becauſe the Iſraelites, to whom they had
                    been originally promulgated, and who had ſeen the miracles in Egypt, at the Red
                    Sea, and Mount Sinai, had died in</p>

                    were ſanctioned, muſt already have been well known to them; yet a ſolemn
                    recapitulation of theſe by the man who had miraculouſly fed the preſent
                    generation from their infancy, who by the lifting. up of his hards had procured
                    them victory in the day of battle, and who was going to leave the world to give
                    an account of his conduct to the God of Iſrael, could not but make a deep and
                    laſting impreſſion on the minds of all who heard him. He inculcates theſe laws
                    by the moſt powerful motives. He preſents before them the moſt animating
                    rewards, and denounces the ſevereſt puniſhments to the rebellious. The
                    prophecies of Moſes towards the end of this book, concerning the fate of the
                    Jews, their diſperſions and calamities, the conqueſt of Jeruſalem by the Romans,
                    the miſeries of the beſieged, and the preſent ſtate of the Jewiſh nation, cannot
                    be read without aſtoniſhment. They are perſpicuous and minute, and have been

                    Kings I. and II. Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Eſther. Theſe, if conſidered
                    diſtinctly from the Pentateuch, and the writings more properly ſtyled
                    prophetical, contain a compendium of the Jewiſh hiſtory from the death of Moſes,
                    A. M. 2552, to the reformation eſtabliſhed by Nehemiah after the return from the
                    captivity, A. M. 3595, comprehending a period of 1043 years.</p>
                <p>To enable us to diſcover the authors of theſe books, we have no guide to conduct
                    us but conjecture, internal evidence, or the authority of the modern Jews. From
                    the frequent references in Scripture, and from the teſtimony of Joſephus, it
                    appears that the Jews were in poſſeſſion of many hiſtorical records which might
                    have thrown much light upon this ſubject if they had ſtill been preſerved. But
                    during the calamities which befel that infatuated nation in their wars with the
                    Romans, and the diſperſion which followed, theſe writings have periſhed. But
                    though we can produce no teſtimony more ancient than the age of our Saviour to
                    authenticate the hiſtorical books, yet there are ſome facts reſpecting the mode
                    of their preſervation which entitle them to credit. The very circumſtance
                    itſelf, that the Jews have preſerved them in the ſacred volume to this day,
                    while their other ancient books have been loſt, is a proof that they conſidered
                    them as the genuine records of their nation. Joſephus<note anchored="true" n="23" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>† Contra Apion, lib.
                        I.</p></note> †, whoſe authority is of great importance, informs us, that it
                    was the peculiar province of the prophets and prieſts to commit to writing the
                    annals of the nation, and to preſerve them to poſterity. That theſe might be
                    faithfully preſerved, the ſacerdotal function was made hereditary, and the
                    greateſt care was obſerved to prevent intermarriages either with foreigners or
                    with the other tribes. No man could officiate as a prieſt who could not prove
                    his deſcent in a right line by unqueſtionable evidence<note anchored="true" n="24" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>‡Ezra ii. 61, 62.</p></note> ‡.
                    Regiſters were kept in Jeruſalem, which at the end oſ every war were regularly
                    reviſed by the ſurviving prieſts; and new ones were then compoſed. As a proof
                    that this has been faithfully performed, Joſephus adds, that the names of all
                    the Jewiſh prieſts, in an uninterrupted ſucceſſion from father to ſon, had been
                    regiſtered for 2000 years; that is, from the time of Aaron to the age of
                        Joſephus.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0119.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0113"/>
                    The national records were not allowed to he written by any man who might think
                    himself fit for the office; and if a prieſt falſified them, he was excluded from
                    the altar and depoſed from his office. Thus we are aſſured, the Jewiſh records
                    were committed to the charge of the prieſts; and as they may be conſidered as
                    the same family from Aaron to the Babyloniſh captivity and downwards, the ſame
                    credit is due to them that would be due to family records, which by antiquarians
                    are eſteemed the moſt authentic ſources of information.</p>
                <p>Of the 22 books which Joſephus reckoned himſelf bound to believe, the hiſtorical
                    books from the death of Moſes to the reign of Artaxerxes, he informs us, were
                    written by contemporary prophets. It appears, then, that the prophets were the
                    compoſers, and the prieſts the hereditary keepers, of the national records.
                    Thus, the beſt proviſion poſſible was made that they ſhould be written
                    accurately, and be preſerved uncorrupted. The principal office of theſe prophets
                    was to inſtruct the people in their duty to God, and occaſionally to communicate
                    the predictions of future events. For this ρurpoſe they were educated in the
                    ſchools of the prophets, or in academies where ſacred learning was taught. The
                    prophets were therefore the learned men of their time, and conſequently were
                    beſt qualified for the office of hiſtorians. It may be objected, that the
                    prophets, in concert with the prieſts, might have forged any writings they
                    pleaſed. But before we ſuſpect that they have done ſo in the hiſtorical books of
                    the Old Teſtament, we muſt find out ſome motive which could induce them to
                    commit ſo daring a crime. But this is impoſſible. No encomiums are made either
                    upon the prophets or the prieſts; no adulation to the reigning monarch appears,
                    nor is the favour of the populace courted. The faults of all ranks are
                    delineated without referve. Indeed there is no hiſtory extant that has more the
                    appearance of impartiality. We are preſented with a ſimple detail of facts, and
                    are left to diſcover the motives and intentions of the ſeveral characters; and
                    when a character is drawn, it is done in a few words, without exaggerating the
                    vices or amplifying the virtues.</p>
                <p>It is of no real conſequence, therefore, whether we can aſcertain the authors of
                    the different books or not. From Joſephus we know that they exiſted in his time;
                    and from his account of the manner in which they were preſerved we are aſſured
                    they were not in danger of being corrupted. They exiſted alſo when the Septua-
                    gint tranſlation was made. Frequent references are made to them in the writings
                    of the later prophets; ſometimes the ſame facts are related in detail. In ſhort,
                    there is ſuch a coincidence between the hiſtorical books and the writings of
                    thoſe prophets who were contemporary, that it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe the
                    latter true without receiving the former.</p>
                <p>Indeed, to ſuppoſe that the Jews could have received and preſerved with ſuch care
                    for ſo many hundred years falſe records, which it muſt have been in the power of
                    every perſon to diſprove, and which at the ſame time do ſo little credit to the
                    character of their nation,</p>
                <p>is to ſuppoſe one of the greateſt abſurdities in the world: it is to ſuppoſe that
                    a whole nation could act contrary to all thoſe principles which have always
                    predominated in the human mind, and which muſt always predominate till human
                    nature undergo a total revolution.</p>
                <p>The book which immediately follows the Pentateuch has been generally aſcribed to
                    Joſhua the ſucceſſor of Moſes. It contains, however, ſome things which muſt have
                    been inſerted after the death of Joſhua. It is neceſſary to remark, that there
                    is ſome accidental derangement in the order of the chapters of this book, which
                    was probably occaſioned by the ancient mode of fixing together a number of
                    rolls. If chronologically placed, they ſhould be read thus, 1ſt chapter to the
                    10th verſe, then the 2d chapter; then from the 10th verſe to the end of the 1ſt
                    chapter; afterwards ſhould follow the vi. vii. viii. ix x. and xi. chapters;
                    then the xxii.; and laſtly the xii. and xiii. chapters to the 24th verſe of the
                    latter.</p>

                    therefore, to aſcribe this book to Samuel.</p>
                <p>The hiſtory of this book may be divided into two parts; the firſt contains an
                    account of the Judges from Othniel to Samſon, ending at the 16th chap. The
                    ſecond part relates ſeveral remarkable tranſactions which occurred ſoon after
                    the death of Joſhua; but are thrown to the end of the book, that they might not
                    interrupt the courſe of the hiſtory. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Judges.</hi></p>
                <p>The book of Ruth is a kind of ſupplement to the book of Judges, and an
                    introduction to the hiſtory of David, as it is related in the books of Samuel.
                    Since the genealogy which it contains deſcends to David, it muſt have been
                    written after the birth of that prince, but not at any conſiderable time after
                    it; for the hiſtory of Boaz and Ruth, the great-grandfather and
                    great-grandmother of David, could not be remembered above two or three
                    generations. As the elder brothers of David and their sons are omitted, and none
                    of his own children are mentioned in the genealogy, it is evident that the book
                    was compoſed in honour of the Hebrew monarch, after he was anointed king by
                    Samuel, and before any of his children were born; and conſequently in the reign
                    of Saul. The Jews aſcribe it to Samuel; and indeed there is no perſon of that
                    age to whom it may be attributed with more propriety. We are informed (1 Sam. x.
                    25.) that Samuel was a writer,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0120.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0114"/> and are aſſured that no perſon in the reign of
                    Saul was ſo well acquainted with the ſplendid proſpects of David as the prophet
                    Samuel.</p>
                <p>The Greeks denominate the books of Samuel, which follow next in order, <hi
                        rend="italic">The Books oſ Kingdoms;</hi> and the Latins, <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Books of Kings L and II.</hi> Anciently there were but two books of
                    Kings; the firſt was the two books of Samuel, and the ſecond was what we now
                    call the two books of Kings. According to the preſent diviſion, theſe two books
                    are four, viz. the firſt and ſecond books of <hi rend="italic">Samuel,</hi> and
                    the firſt and ſecond books of <hi rend="italic">Kings.</hi></p>
                <p>Concerning the author of the two books of Samuel there are different opinions.
                    Some think that Samuel wrote only twenty or twenty-four chapters of the firſt
                    book, and that the hiſtory was continued by Nathan and Gad. This opinion they
                    ground on the following paſſage in <hi rend="italic">Chronicles</hi><note anchored="true" n="29" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>§ I Chron.
                            xxix. 29.</p></note> § <hi rend="italic">,</hi> “Now the acts of David
                    the king, firſt and laſt, behold they are written in the book of Samuel the s
                        <hi rend="italic">eer,</hi> and in the book of Nathan the <hi rend="italic"
                        >pro- fleet,</hi> and Gad the <hi rend="italic">feer."</hi> Others think
                    they were compiled by Ezra from ancient records; but it is evident that the
                    books of Samuel were written before the books of Kings and Chronicles; for on
                    compariſon it will be found, that in the laſt mentioned books many circumſtances
                    are taken from the former. The firſt book carries down the hiſtory of the
                    Iſraelites from the birth of Samuel to the fatal battle of Gilboa, comprehending
                    a period of about 80 years. The ſecond relates the hiſtory of David from his
                    ſucceſſion to the throne of Iſrael till within a year or two of his death,
                    containing 40 years. There are two beautiful paſſages in theſe books which every
                    man of ſentiment and taſte muſt feel and admire, the lamentation or elegy on
                    Saul and Jonathan, and the parable of Nathan. The impartiality of the hiſtorian
                    is fully atteſted by the candour and freedom with which the actions of Saul and
                    David are related. There are ſome remarks interſperſed which were probably added
                    by Ezra.</p>
                <p>When the two books of Kings were written, or by whom they were compiled, is
                    uncertain. Some have ſuppoſed that <hi rend="italic">David, Solomon,</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Hezekiah,</hi> wrote the hiſtory of their own times.
                    Others have been of opinion that the prophets, viz. <hi rend="italic">Isaiah,
                        Jeremiah, Gad,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nathan,</hi> each of them wrote
                    the hiſtory of the reign in which he lived. But it is generally believed that
                        <hi rend="italic">Ezra</hi> wrote theſe two books, and publiſhed them in the
                    form in which we have them at preſent. There can be no doubt but the prophets
                    drew up the lives of the kings who reigned in their times; for the names and
                    writings of thoſe prophets are frequently mentioned, and cited. Still, however,
                    it is evident that the two books of Kings are but an abridgment of a larger
                    work, the ſubſtance of which is contained in the books before us. In ſupport of
                    the opinion that Ezra is the author of theſe books, it is ſaid, That in the time
                    of the penman, the ten tribes were captives in Aſſyria, whither they had been
                    carried as a puniſhment for their ſins: That in the ſecond of theſe books the
                    author makes ſome reflections on the calamities of Iſrael and Judah, which
                    demonſtrate that he lived after that event. But to this it is objected, That the
                    author of theſe books expreſſes himſelf throughout as a contemporary, and as one
                    would have done who had been an eye and ear witneſs of what he related. To this
                    objection it is anſwered,</p>
                <p>That Ezra compiled theſe books from the prophetic waitings which he had in his
                    poſſeſſion; that he copied them exactly, narrating the facts in order as they
                    happened, and interſperſed in his hiſtory ſome reflections and remarks ariſing
                    from the ſubjects which he handled.</p>
                <p>The firſt book compriſes a period oſ 126 years, from the death of David to that
                    of Jehoſhaphat. The ſecond book records the tranſactions of many kings of Judah
                    and Iſrael for the ſpace of about 300 years, from the death of Jehoſhaphat to
                    the deſtruction of Jeruſalem and the temple, A. M. 3416. A. C. 588.</p>

                    as if theſe two books were a kind of ſupplement to inform us what had been
                    omitted or too much abridged in the books of <hi rend="italic">Kings.</hi> The
                    two books of Chronicles contain indeed ſeveral particulars which are not to be
                    met with in the other books of ſcripture: but it is not therefore to be ſuppoſed
                    that they are the records of the kings of Judah and Iſrael, ſo often referred to
                    in the books of Kings. Thoſe ancient regiſters were apparently much more copious
                    than the books before us; and the compiler of the books of Chronicles often
                    refers to them, and makes long extracts from them.</p>
                <p>Some ſuppoſe that the author of theſe two books was the ſame with that of the two
                    books of Kings. The Jews say that they were written by Ez <hi rend="italic"
                        >ra,</hi> after the return from the captivity, aſſiſted by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Zechariah</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Haggai,</hi> who were then alive. But
                    events are mentioned in them of ſo late a date as to ſhow that he could not have
                    written them in their preſent form; and there is another objection to his being
                    their author, which is little leſs forcible: between the books of <hi
                        rend="italic">Kings</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chronicles</hi> there is a
                    great number of variations both in dates and facts, which could not have
                    happened if <hi rend="italic">Ezra</hi> had been the author of them, or indeed
                    if they had been the work oſ any one perſon.</p>
                <p>The books of Chronicles are not to be conſidered merely as an abridgment of
                    former hiſtories with ſome uſeful additions, but as books written with a
                    particular view; which ſeems to have been to furniſh a genealogical regiſter of
                    the twelve tribes, deduced from the earlieſt times, in order to point out thoſe
                    diſtinctions which were neceſſary to diſcriminate the mixed multitude that
                    returned from Babylon; to aſcertain the lineage of Judah; and to reeſtabliſh on
                    their ancient footing the pretenſions and functions of each individual
                    tribe.</p>
                <p>The book of Ezra, and alſo that of Nehemiah, are attributed by the ancients to
                    the former of theſe prophets; and they called them the lſt and 2d books of
                    Eſdras; which title is ſtill kept up by the Latin church. It is indeed highly
                    probable that the former of theſe books, which compriſes the hiſtory of the Jews
                    from the time that Cyrus made the decree for their return until the twentieth
                    year of Artaxerxes Longimanus (which was about 100 years, or as others think 79
                    years), was all compoſed by Ezra, except the firſt fix chapters, which contain
                    an account of the firſt return oſ the Jews upon the decree of Cyrus; whereas
                    Ezra did not return till the time of Artaxerxes. It is of this ſecond return
                    therefore that he writes the account; and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0121.tif"

                    compoſed to his hand, he made it a complete hiſtory of the Jewiſh
                    reſtoration.</p>
                <p>This book 13 written in Chaldee from chap. iv. 8. to chap. vii. 27. As this part
                    of the work chiefly contains letters, converſations, and decrees expreſſed in
                    that language, the fidelity of the hiſtorian has probably induced him to take
                    down the very words which were uſed. The people, too, had been accuſtomed to the
                    Chaldee during the captivity, and probably underſtood it better than Hebrew; for
                    it appears from Nehemiah’s account, chap. viii. 2, 8. that all could not
                    underſtand the law.</p>
                <p>The book of Nehemiah, as has been already obſerved, bears, in the Latin bibles,
                    the title of the <hi rend="italic">ſecond book</hi> of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Eſdras;</hi> the ancient canons likewiſe give it the ſame name, becauſe,
                    perhaps, it was conſidered as a ſequel to the book of Ezra. In the Hebrew bibles
                    it has the name of <hi rend="italic">Nehemiah</hi> prefixed to it; which name is
                    retained in the Engliſh bible. But though that chief is by the writer of the
                    ſecond book of Maccabees affirmed to have been the author of it, there cannot,
                    we think, be a doubt but that either it was written at a later period, or had
                    additions made to it after Nehemiah’s death.</p>
                <p>With the book of Nehemiah the hiſtory of the Old Teſtament concludes. This is
                    ſuppoſed to have taken place about A. M. 3574- A. C. 434. But Prideaux with more
                    probablity has fixed it at A. M. 3595. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nehemiah.</hi></p>
                <p>It is uncertain who was the author of the book of Eſther. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Clement</hi> of Alexandria, and many commentators, have aſcribed it to
                    Mordecai; and the book itſelf ſeems to favour this opinion; for we are told in
                    chap. ix. 20. that “Mordecai wrote theſe things.” Others have ſuppoſed that Ezra
                    was the author; but the more probable opinion of the Talmudiſts is, that the
                    great ſynagogue (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Synagogue),</hi> to perpetuate the
                    memory of the deliverance of the Jews from the conſpiracy of Hainan, and to
                    account for the origin of the feaſt of Purim, ordered this book to be compoled,
                    very likely of materials left by Mordecai, and afterwards approved and admitted
                    it into the ſacred canon. The time when the events which it relates happened, is
                    ſuppoſed by ſome to have been in the reign of Artaxerxes Longimanus, and by
                    others in that of Darius the ſon of Hyſtaſpes, called by the ſacred penman <hi

                <p>Concerning the author of the book of Job there are many different opinions. Some
                    have ſuppoſed that Job himſelf wrote it in <hi rend="italic">Syriac</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Arabic,</hi> and that it was afterwards tranſlated by Moſes.
                    Others have thought that El <hi rend="italic">ihu</hi> wrote it; and by others
                    it is aſcribed to Moſes, to Solomon, to Iſaiah, and to Ezra. To give even an
                    abridgment of the arguments brought in ſupport of theſe various opinions would
                    fill a volume, and at laſt leave the reader in his preſent uncertainty. He who
                    has leiſure and inclination to weigh them may ſtudy the ſecond ſection of the
                    ſixth book of Warburton’s Divine Legation of Moſes, together with the ſeveral
                    works there referred to; but the queſtion at iſſue is of very little importance
                    to us. The book of job, by whomſoever it was written, and whether it be a real
                    hiſtory, or a dramatical poem founded on hiſtory, has been always eſteemed a
                    portion of canonical ſcripture, and is one of the moſt ſublime compoſitions in
                    the ſacred volume.</p>
                <p>The book of Job appears to ſtand ſingle and unparalleled in the ſacred volume. It
                    ſeems to have little connection with the other writings of the Hebrews, and no
                    relation whatever to the affairs of the Iſraelites. The ſcene is laid in

                            was the grandſon of Seir the Horite, Gen. xxxvi. 20, 21, 28. 1. Chron.
                            i. 38, 42. Seir inhabited that mountainous tract which was called by his
                            name antecedent to the time of Abraham; but his poſterity being
                            expelled, it was occupied by the Idumaeans: Gen. xiv. 6. Deut. ii. 12.
                            Two other men are mentioned of the name <hi rend="italic">Uz;</hi> one
                            the grandſon of Shem, the other the ſon of Nachυr, the brother of

                            clear. Idumæa is a part of Arabia Petræa, ſituated on the ſouthern
                            extremity of the tribe of Judah: Numb, xxxiv. 3. Joſh. xv. 1, 21. The
                            land of Uz therefore appears to have been between Egypt and Philiſtia,
                            Jer. xxv. 20. where the order of the places ſeems to have been
                            accurately obſerved in reviewing the different nations from Egypt to
                            Babylon; and the ſame people ſeem again to be deſcribed in exactly the

                            Euphrates, bordering upon judea from the ſouth to the call; the
                            Idumaeans, the Amalekites, the Midianites, the Moabites, the Ammonites.
                            See Judges vi. 3. and Iſa. xi. 14. Of theſe the Idumaeans and Amalekites
                            certainly poſſeſſed the ſouthern parts. See Numb. xxxiv. 3, xiii. 29. 1
                            Sam. xxvii. 8, 10. This appears to be the true ſtate of the cale: The
                            whole region between Egypt and Euphrates was called the Eaſt, at firſt
                            in reſpect to Egypt (where the learned Joſ. Mede thinks the Iſraelites
                            acquired this mode ofſpeaking. Mede’s <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> p.
                            580.), and afterwards abſolutely and without any relation to ſituation
                            or circumſtances. Abraham is ſaid to have ſent the ſons of his
                            concubines, Hagar and Keturah, “eaſtward, to the country which is
                            commonly called the Eaſt." Gen. xxv. 6. where the name of the region
                            ſeems to have been derived from the ſame ſituation. Solomon is reported
                            “to have excelled in wiſdom all the Eaſtern people, and all Egypt,” 1
                            Kings iv. 30.; that is, all the neighbouring people on that quarter: for
                                <pb n="116"/> there were people beyond the boundaries of Egypt, and
                            bordering on the ſouth of Judea, who were famous for wiſdom, namely, the
                            Idumaeans (ſee Jer. xlix. 7. Ob, 8.), to whom we may well believe this
                            paſſage might have ſome relation. Thus Jehovah addreſſes the
                            Babylonians; “Ariſe, aſcend unto Kedar, and lay waſte the children of
                            the Eaſt,” (Jer. xlix. 28). notwithſtanding theſe were really ſituated
                            to the weſt of Babylon. Although Job, therefore, be accounted one of the
                            orientals, it by no means follows that his reſidence muſt be in Arabia
                            Deſerta.</p>

                            The Eliphaz of Job was without a doubt of this race. Teman is certainly
                            a city of Idumaea, (Jer. xlix, 7, 20. Ezek. XXV. 13. Amos i. 11, 12. Ob.

                            in the diſtrict of Egypt, (I Sam. xv. 7.) Havilah cannot, therefore, be

                            facts, I think we may venture to conclude, ſtill with that modeſty which
                            ſuch a queſtion demands, that Job was an inhabitant of Arabia Petraea,
                            as well as his friends, or at leaſt of that neighbourhood. To this
                            ſolution one objection may be raided: it may be aſked, How the
                            Chaldeans, who lived on the borders of the Euphrates, could make
                            depredations on the camels of Job, who lived in Idumaea at ſo great a
                            diſtance? This too is thought a ſufficient cauſe for aſſigning Job a
                            ſituation in Arabia Deſerta, and not far from the Euphrates. But what
                            ſhould prevent the Chaldeans, as well as the Sabaeans, a people addicted
                            to rapine, and roving about at immenſe diſtances for the ſake of
                            plunder, from wandering through theſe defenceleſs regions, which were
                            divided into tribes and families rather than into nations, and pervading
                            from Euphrates even to Egypt? Further, I would aſk on the other hand,
                            whether it be probable that all the friends of Job who lived in Idumaea
                            and its neighbourhood, ſhould inſtantly be informed of all that could
                            happen to Job in the deſert of Arabia and on the confines of Chaldea,
                            and immediately repair thither ? Or whether it be reaſonable to think,
                            that, ſome of them being inhabitants of Arabia Deſerta, it ſhould be
                            concerted among them to meet at the reſidence of Job; ſince it is
                            evident, that Eliphaz lived at Theman, in the extreme parts of Idumaea?

                    characters who ſpeak are Idumaeans, or at leaſt Arabians of the adjacent
                    country, all originally of the race of Abraham. The language is pure Hebrew,
                    although the author appears to be an Idumaean; for it is not improbable that all

                    family of Keturah or Iſhmael, ſpoke for a conſiderable length of time one common
                    language. That the Idumaeans, however, and the Temanites in particular, were
                    eminent for the reputation of wiſdom, appears by the teſtimony of the prophets

                <p>The principal perſonage in this poem is Job; and in his character is meant to be
                    exhibited (as far as is conſiſtent with human infirmity) an example of perfect
                    virtue. This is intimated in the argument or introduction, but is ſtill more
                    eminently diſplayed by his</p>
                <p>own actions and ſentiments. He is holy, devout, and moſt piouſly and reverently
                    impreſſed with the ſacred awe of his divine Creator; he is alſo upright, and
                    conſcious of his own integrity; he is patient of evil, and yet very remote from
                    that inſenſibility or rather ſtupidity to which the Stoic ſchool pretended.
                    Oppreſſed therefore with unparalleled misfortunes, he laments his miſery, and
                    even wiſhes a releaſe by death; in other words, he obeys, and gives place to the
                    dictates of nature. Irritated, however, by the unjuſt inſinuations and the
                    severe reproaches of his pretended friends, he is more vehemently exaſperated,
                    and the too great confidence in his own righteouſneſs leads him to expoſtulate
                    with God in terms ſcarcely conſiſtent with piety and ſtrict decorum.</p>
                <p>It muſt be obſerved, that the firſt ſpeech of Job, though it burſts forth with
                    all the vehemence of paſſion, consists wholly of complaint, “the words and
                    ſentiments of a deſpairing perſon, empty as the wind<note anchored="true" n="35" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Job vi. 26.</p></note> *;”<pb

                    indeed the apology that he immediately makes for his conduct; intimating, that
                    he is far from preſuming to plead with God, far from daring to call in queſtion
                    the divine decrees, or even to mention his own innocence in the presence of his
                    all-juſt Creator: nor is there any good reaſon for the cenſure which has been
                    paſſed by ſome commentators upon this paſſagc. The poet ſeems, with great
                    judgment and ingenuity, to have performed in this what the nature of his work
                    required. He has depicted the affliction and anguiſh of Job, as flowing from his
                    wounded heart in a manner ſo agreeable to human nature (and certainly ſo far
                    venial), that it may be truly ſaid, “in all this Job finned not with his lips.”
                    It is, nevertheleſs, embelliſhed by ſuch affecting imagery, and inſpired with
                    ſuch a warmth and force of ſentiment, that we find it afforded ample ſcope for
                    calumny; nor did the unkind witneſſes of his ſufferings permit ſo fair an
                    opportunity to eſcape. The occaſion is eagerly embraced by Eliphaz to rebuke the
                    impatience of Job; and, not ſatisſied with this, he proceeds to accuſe him in
                    direct terms of wanting fortitude, and obliquely to inſinuate ſomething of a
                    deeper dye. Though deeply hurt with the coarſe reproaches of Eliphaz, ſtill,
                    however, when Job afterwards complains of the ſeverity of God, he cautiouſly
                    refrains from violent expoſtulations with his Creator, and, contented with the
                    ſimple expreſſion of affliction, he humbly confeſſes himſelf a ſinner<note anchored="true" n="36" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>⁋ See chap.
                            vii. 20.</p></note> ⁋. Hence it is evident, that thoſe vehement and
                    perverſe atteſtations of his innocence, thoſe murmurs againſt the divine
                    Providence, which his tottering virtue afterwards permits, are to be conſidered
                    merely as the conſequences of momentary paſſion, and not as the ordinary effects
                    of his ſettled character or manners. They prove him at the very worſt not an
                    irreligious man, but a man poſſeſſed of integrity, and too confident of it; a
                    man oppreſſed with almoſt every imaginable evil, both corporal and mental, and
                    hurried beyond the limits of virtue by the ſtrong influence of pain and
                    affliction. When, on the contrary, his importunate viſitors abandon by ſilence
                    the cauſe which they had ſo wantonly and ſo maliciouſly maintained, and ceaſe
                    unjuſtly to load him with unmerited criminations; though he defends his argument
                    with ſcarcely leſs obſtinacy, yet the vehemence of his grief appears gradually
                    to ſubſide; he returns to himſelf, and explains his ſentiments with more candour
                    and ſedateneſs: and however we may blame him for aſſuming rather too much of
                    arrogance in his appeals to the Almighty, certainly his defence againſt the
                    accuſations of Eliphaz is no more than the occaſion will ſtrictly juſtify.
                    Obſerve, in the firſt place, how admirably the confidence and perſeverance of
                    Job is diſplayed in replying to the ſlander of his falſe friends:</p>
                <p>As God liveth, who hath removed my judgment;</p>
                <p>Nay, as the Almighty liveth, who hath embittered my</p>

                <p>And I will not give up my ſtation:</p>

                <p>But what can be more engaging than the purity of his devotion, and his reverence
                    for the Supreme Being, founded upon the beſt and moſt philoſophical principles?
                    Beſides that through the whole there runs a ſtrain of the moſt amiable
                    tenderneſs and humanity:</p>
                <p>For what is the portion which God diſtributeth from above,</p>
                <p>And the inheritance of the Almighty from on high?</p>

                <p>Doth he not ſee my ways?</p>

                <p>And when he viſiteth, what anſwer could I make him? Did not he who formed me in

                <p>The three friends are exactly ſuch characters as the nature of the poem required.
                    They are ſevere, irritable, malignant cenſors, readily and with apparent
                    ſatisfaction deviating from the purpoſe of conſolation into reproof and
                    contumely. Even from the very firſt they manifeſt this evil propenſity, and
                    indicate what is to be expected from them. The firſt of them, indeed, in the
                    opening of his harangue, aſſumes an air of candour:</p>
                <p>Wouldſt thou take it unkindly that one ſhould eſſay to ſpeak to thee<note anchored="true" n="42" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>⁋ Chap. iv.

                    predominant:</p>

                <p>The ſecond flames forth at once:</p>

                <p>Or ſhall a man be acquitted for his fine ſpeeches?</p>
                <p>Shall thy prevarications make men ſilent?</p>

                <p>The lenity and moderation of Elihu ſerves as a beautiful contraſt to the
                    intemperance and aſperity of the other three. He is pious, mild, and equitable;
                    equally free from adulation and ſeverity; and endued with ſingular wiſdom, which
                    he attributes entirely to the inspiration of God: and his modeſty, moderation.
                    and wiſdom, are the more entitled to commendation when we Conſider his unripe
                    youth. As the characters of his detractors were in all reſpects calculated to
                    inflame the mind of Job, that of this arbitrator is admirably adapted to ſooth
                    and compoſe it: to this point the whole drift of the argument tends, and on this
                    the very purport of it ſeems to depend.</p>
                <p>Another circumſtance deſerving particular attention in a poem of this kind, is
                    the ſentiment; which muſt be agreeable to the ſubject, and embelliſhed with
                    proper expreſſion. It is by Ariſtotle enumerated among the eſſentials of a
                    dramatic poem; not indeed as peculiar to that ſpecies of poetry alone, but as
                    common, and of the greateſt importance, to all. Manners or character are
                    eſſential only to that poetry in which living perſons are introduced; and all
                    ſuch poems muſt afford an exact repreſentation of human manners: but ſentiment
                    is eſſential to every poem, indeed to every compoſition whatever. It reſpects
                    both perſons and things. As far as it regards perſons, it is particularly
                    concerned in the delineation of the manners and paſſions: and thoſe instances to
                    which we have just been adverting are ſentiments expreſſive of manners. Thoſe
                    which relate to the delineation of the paſſions, and to the deſcription of other
                    objects, yet remain unnoticed.</p>
                <p>The poem oſ Job abounds chiefly in the more vehement paſſions, grief and anger,
                    indignation and violent contention. It is adapted in every reſpect to the
                    incitement of terror; and, as the ſpecimens already quoted will ſuſſiciently
                    prove, is univerſally animated with the true ſpirit of ſublimity. It is however
                    not wanting in the gentler affections. The following complaints, for inſtance,
                    are replete with an affecting ſpirit of melancholy:</p>
                <p>Man, the offspring of a woman,</p>
                <p>Is of few days, and full of inquietude;</p>
                <p>He ſpringeth up, and is cut off like a flower;</p>
                <p>He fleeteth like a ſhadow, and doth not abide: Up on ſuch a creature doſt thou
                    open thine eyes?</p>
                <p>And wilt thou bring even me into judgment with thee? Turn thy look from him, that
                    he may have ſome reſpite,</p>
                <p>Till he ſhall, like a hireling, have completed his day<note anchored="true" n="45" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>∣∣ Chap xiv. 1, 2, 3,

                <p>The whole paſſage abounds with the moſt beautiful imagery, and is a moſt perfect
                    ſpecimen of the Elegiac. His grief afterwards becomes more fervent; but is at
                    the ſame time ſoft and querimonious.</p>
                <p>Plow long will ye vex my foul,</p>
                <p>And tire me with vain harangues?</p>
                <p>Theſe ten times have ye loaded me with reproaches, Are ye not aſhamed that ye are
                    ſo obſtinate againſt me? Pity me, O pity me, ye are my friends,</p>
                <p>For the hand of God hath ſmitten me.</p>

                <p>Let it ſuffice to ſay, that the dignity of the ſtyle is anſwerable to that of the
                    ſubject; its force and energy, to the greatneſs of thoſe paſſions which it
                    deſcribes: and as this production excels all the other remains of the Hebrew
                    poetry in economy and arrangement, ſo it yields to none in ſublimity of ſtyle
                    and in every grace and excellence of compoſition. Among the principal of theſe
                    may be accounted the accurate and perfectly poetical conformation oſ the
                    ſentences, which is indeed generally moſt obſervable in the moſt ancient of the
                    poetical compoſitions of the Hebrews. Here, however, as is natural and proper in
                    a poem of ſo great length and ſublimity, the writer’s ſkill is diſplayed in the
                    proper adjuſtment of the period, and in the accurate diſtribution of the
                    members, rather than in the antitheſis of words, or in any laboured adaptation

                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0119"/> collection of divine ſongs. The Chriſtian church
                    has from the beginning made them a principal part of her holy ſervices; and in
                    the primitive times it was almoſt a general rule that every biſhop, prieſt, and
                    religious perſon, ſhould have the pſalter by heart.</p>
                <p>Many learned fathers, and not a few of the moderns, have maintained that <hi
                        rend="italic">David</hi> was the author of them all. Several are of a
                    different opinion, and inſiſt that David wrote only 72 of them; and that thoſe
                    without titles are to be aſcribed to the authors oſ the preceding pſalms, whoſe
                    names are affixed to them. Thoſe who ſuppoſe that David alone was the author,
                    contend, that in the New Teſtament, and in the language of the church universal,
                    they are expreſsly called the <hi rend="italic">Pſalms oſ David.</hi> That David
                    was the principal author of theſe hymns is univerſally acknowledged, and
                    therefore the whole collection may properly enough go under his name; but that
                    he wrote them all, is a palpable miſtake. Nothing certain can be gathered from
                    the titles of the pſalms; for although unqueſtionably very ancient, yet authors
                    are not agreed as to their authority, and they differ as much about their
                    ſignification. The Hebrew doctors generally agree that the 92d pſalm was
                    compoſed by Adam; an opinion which for many reaſons we are not inclined to
                    adopt. There ſeems, however, to be no doubt but that ſome of them were written
                    by Moſes; that Solomon was the author of the 49th; and that others were
                    occaſioned by events long poſterior to the flouriſhing era of the kingdom of
                    Judah. The 137th particularly is one of thoſe which mentions the captivity of
                    Babylon.</p>
                <p>The following arrangement of the Pſalms, after a careful and judicious
                    examination, has been adopted by Calmet.</p>
                <p>1. Eight Pſalms of which the date is uncertain, <hi rend="italic">viz. 1</hi>, 4,
                    19, 81, 91, 110, 139, 145. The firſt of theſe was compoſed by David or Ezra, and
                    was ſung in the temple at the feaſt of trumpets held in the beginning of the
                    year and at the feaſt of tabernacles. The 81ſt is attributed to Aſaph, and 110th
                    to David. The authors of the reſt are unknown.</p>
                <p>2. The Pſalms compoſed by David during the persecution of Saul. Theſe are
                    ſeventeen, 11, 31, 34, 56, 16, 54, 52, 109, 17, 22, 35, 57, 58, 142, 140, 141,
                    7.</p>
                <p>3. The Pſalms compoſed by David at the beginning of his reign, and after the
                    death of Saul. Theſe are ſixteen, 2,9, 24, 63, 101, 29, 20, 21, 28, 39, 40, 41,
                    6, 51, 32, 33.</p>
                <p>4. The Pſalms written by David during the rebellion of Abialom are eight in
                    number; 3, 4, 53, 62, 70, 71, 143, 144.</p>
                <p>5. The Pſalms written between the death of Abſalom and the captivity, which are
                    ten, 18, 30, 72, 47, 78, 82, 83, 76, 74, 79: of theſe David wrote only three;
                    18, 30, and 72.</p>
                <p>6. The Pſalms compoſed during the captivity, which amount to forty. Theſe were
                    chiefly compoſed by the of Rendants of Aſaph and Korah: they are, 10, 12, 13,
                    14, 53, 15, 25, 26, 27, 28, 36, 37, 42, 43, 44, 49, 50, 60, 64, 69, 73, 75, 77,
                    80, 84, 86, 88, 89, 90, 92, 93, 94, 95, 99, 120, 121, 123, 130, 131, 132.</p>
                <p>Laſtly, Thoſe hymns of joy and thankſgiving, written upon the releaſe from the
                    Babyloniſh captivity, and at the building and dedication of the temple. Theſe
                    are, 122, 61, 63, 124, 23, 87, 85, 46, 47, 48, from 96 to 117 incluſive, 126,
                    133 to 137 incluſive, 149, 150, 146, 147, 148, 59, 65, 66, 67, 118, 125,</p>
                <p>127, 128, 129, 138. According to this diſtribution, only 45 are poſitively
                    aſſigned to David.</p>
                <p>Joſephus, and moſt of the ancient writers, aſſert, that the Pſalms were compoſed
                    in numbers: little, however, reſpecting the nature and principles of the Hebrew
                    verſification is known.</p>
                <p>There exiſted a certain kind of poetry among the Hebrews, principally intended,
                    it ſhould ſeem, for the aſſiſtance of the memory; in which, when there was
                    little connection between the ſentiments, a fort of order or method was
                    preſerved, by the initial letters oſ each line or ſtanza following the order of
                    the alphabet. Of this there are ſeveral examples extant among the ſacred
                        poems<note anchored="true" n="49" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    (I); and in theſe examples the verſes are ſo exactly marked and defined, that it
                    is impoſſible to miſtake them for proſe; and particularly if we attentively
                    conſider the verſes, and compare them with one another, ſince they are in
                    general ſo regularly accommodated, that word anſwers to word, and almoſt
                    ſyllable to ſyllable. This being the caſe, though an appeal can ſcarcely be made
                    to the ear on this occaſion, the eye itſelf will diſtinguiſh. the poetic
                    diviſion and arrangement, and alſo that ſome labour and accuracy has been
                    employed in adapting the words to the meaſure.</p>
                <p>The Hebrew poetry has likewiſe another property altogether peculiar to metrical
                    compoſition. It admits foreign words and certain particles, which ſeldom occur
                    in proſe compoſition, and thus forms a diſtinct poetical dialect. One or two of
                    the peculiarities alſo of the Hebrew verſification it may be proper to remark,
                    which as they are very obſervable in thoſe poems in which the verſes are defined
                    by the initial letters, may at leaſt be reaſonably conjectured of the reſt. The
                    firſt of theſe is, that the verſes are very unequal in length; the ſhorteſt
                    conſifting oſ ſix or ſeven ſyllables; the longeſt extending to about twice that
                    number: the ſame poem is, however, generally continued throughout in verſes not
                    very unequal to each other. It muſt alfo be obſerved, that the cloſe of the
                    verſe generally falls where the members of the ſentences are divided.</p>
                <p>But although nothing certain can be defined concerning the metre of the
                    particular verſes, there is yet another artifice of poetry to be remarked of
                    them when in a collective ſtate, when ſeveral of thcm are taken together. In the
                    Hebrew poetry, as is before remarked, there may be obſerved a certain
                    conformation of the ſentences ; the nature of which is, that a complete ſenſe is
                    almoſt equally infuſed into every component part, and that every member
                    conſtitutes an entire verſe. So that as the poems divide themſelves in a manner
                    ſpontane- ouſly into periods, for the moſt part equal; ſo the periods themſelves
                    are divided into verſes, moſt common-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0126.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0120"/> ly couplets, though frequently of greater
                    length. This is chiefly obſervable in thoſe paſſages which frequently occur in
                    the Hebrew poetry, in which they treat one ſubject in many different ways, and
                    dwell upon the ſame ſentiment; when they expreſs the ſame thing in different
                    words, or different things in a ſimilar form of words; when equals refer to
                    equals, and oppoſites to oppoſites: and ſince this artifice of compoſition
                    ſeldom fails to produce even in proſe an agreeable and meaſured cadence —we can
                    ſcarcely doubt that it muſt have imparted to their poetry, were we maſters of
                    the verification, an exquiſite degree of beauty and grace.</p>
                <p>The elegant and ingenious Dr Lowth has with great acuteneſs examined the
                    peculiarities of Hebrew poetry, and has arranged them under general diviſions.
                    The correſpondence of one verſe or line with another he calls <hi rend="italic"
                        >ρarallelism.</hi> When a propoſition is delivered, and a ſecond is
                    ſubjoinued to it, equivalent or contracted with it in ſenſe, or ſimilar to it in

                    reduces to three ſorts; parallels ſynonymous, parallels antithetic, and
                    parallels ſynthetic. Of each of theſe we ſhall preſent a few examples.</p>
                <p>First, of parallel lines ſynonymous, which correſpond one to another by

                    one another by an oppoſition of terms and ſentiments; when the ſecond is
                    contracted with the firſt, ſometimes in expreſſions, ſometimes in ſenſe only.
                    Accordingly the degrees of antitheſis are various: from an exact contrapoſition
                    of word to word through the whole ſentence, down to a general diſparity, with
                    ſomething of a contrariety, in the two propoſitions. Thus in the following
                    examples:</p>
                <p>A wiſe ſon rejoiceth his father;</p>
                <p>But a fooliſh ſon is the grief of his mother.</p>
                <p>Prov. X. I.</p>
                <p>Where every word hath its oppoſite: for the terms <hi rend="italic">father</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">mother</hi> are, as the logicians ſay, relatively
                    oppoſite.</p>
                <p>The memory of the juſt is a bleſſing;</p>
                <p>But the name of the wicked ſhall rot. Prov. x. 7.</p>
                <p>Here there are only two antithetic terms: for <hi rend="italic">memory</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">name</hi> are ſynonymous.</p>
                <p>There is that ſcattereth, and ſtill increaſeth;</p>
                <p>And that is unreaſonably ſparing, yet groweth poor.</p>
                <p>Prov. xi. 24.</p>
                <p>Here there is a kind of double antitheſis; one between the two lines themſelves;
                    and likewiſe a ſubordinate oppoſition between the two parts of each.</p>
                <p>Theſe in chariots, and thoſe in horſes;</p>
                <p>But we in the name of Jehovah our God will be ſtrong. They are bowed down, and
                    fallen;</p>
                <p>But we are riſen, and maintain ourſelves firm.</p>
                <p>Pſ. XX. 7, 8.</p>
                <p>For his wrath is but for a moment, his favour for life; Sorrow may lodge for the
                    evening, but in the morning</p>
                <p>gladneſs. Pſ. xxx. 5.</p>
                <p>Yet a little while, and the wicked ſhall be no more; Thou ſhalt look at his
                    place, and he ſhall not be found: But the meek ſhall inherit the land;</p>
                <p>And delight themſelves in abundant proſperity.</p>

                    the two parts of a ſtanza of four lines, the latter diſtich being oppoſed to the
                    former. So likewiſe the following:</p>
                <p>For the mountains ſhall be removed;</p>
                <p>And the hills ſhall be overthrown:</p>
                <p>But my kindneſs from thee ſhall not be removed;</p>

                <p>Iſaiah by means of the antithetic paralleliſm, without departing from his uſual
                    dignity, adds greatly to the ſweetneſs of his compoſition in the following
                    inſtances:</p>
                <p>in a little anger have I forſaken thee;</p>
                <p>But with great mercies will I receive thee again:</p>
                <p>In a ſhort wrath I hid my face for a moment from thee; But with everlaſting
                    kindneſs will I have mercy on thee.</p>

                    be confounded;</p>
                <p>Behold my ſervants ſhall ſing aloud, for gladneſs of heart,</p>
                <p>But ye ſhall cry aloud for grief of heart;</p>

                <p>Iſaiah lxv. 13, 14.</p>
                <p>Frequently one line or member contains two ſentiments:</p>
                <p>The nations raged; the kingdoms were moved;</p>
                <p>He uttered a voice; the earth was diſſolved:</p>
                <p>Be ſtill, and know that I am God:</p>
                <p>I will be exalted in the nations, I will be exalted in the</p>
                <p>earth. Pſ. xlvi. 6. 10.</p>
                <p>When thou paſſeſt through waters I am with thee; And through rivers, they ſhall
                    not overwhelm thee: When thou walkeſt in the fire thou ſhalt not be ſcorched;
                    And the flame ſhall not cleave to thee. Iſaiah xliii. 2.</p>
                <p>The third fort of parallels is the ſynthetic or conſtructive: where the
                    paralleliſm conſiſts only in the ſimilar form of conſtruction; in which word
                    does not anſwer to word, and ſentence to ſentence, as equivalent or oppoſite;
                    but there is a correſpondence and equality between different propoſitions, in
                    reſpect of the ſhape and turn of the whole ſentence, and of the conſtructive
                    parts; ſuch as noun anſwering to noun, verb to verb, member to member, negative
                    to negative, interrogative to interrogative.</p>
                <p>Lo! he withholdeth the waters, and they are dried up: And he ſendeth them forth,

                <p>That a man ſhould afflict his ſoul for a day?</p>
                <p>Is it, that he ſhould bow down his head like a bulruſh, And ſpread ſackcloth and

                <p>Shall this be called a faſt,</p>

                <p>And that ye ſhould break aſunder every yoke?</p>
                <p>Is it not to diſtribute thy bread to the hungry;</p>
                <p>And to bring the wandering poor into thy houſe?</p>
                <p>When thou ſeeſt the naked, that thou clothe him;</p>
                <p>And that thou hide not thyſelf from thine own fleſh? Then ſhall thy light break

                <p>And thy wounds ſhall ſpeedily be healed over:</p>
                <p>And thy righteouſneſs ſhall go before thee;</p>

                <p>Iſaiah lviii. 5 —8.</p>
                <p>We ſhall produce another example of this ſpecies of paralleliſm from Pſ. xix.
                    8—11. from Dr Lowth:</p>
                <p>The law of Jehovah is perfect, reſtoring the ſoul;</p>
                <p>The teſtimony of Jehovah is ſure, making wife the</p>
                <p>ſimple:</p>
                <p>The precepts of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart The commandment of Jehovah
                    is clear, enlightening the eyes:</p>
                <p>The fear of Jehovah is pure, enduring for ever;</p>
                <p>The judgments of Jehovah are truth, they are juft altogether.</p>
                <p>More deſirable than gold, or than much fine gold;</p>
                <p>And ſweeter than honey, or the dropping of honeycombs.</p>
                <p>Synonymous parallels have the appearance of art and concinnity, and a ſtudied
                    elegance; they prevail chiefly in ſhorter poem ; in many of the Pſalms; in
                    Balaam’s prophecies; frequently in thoſe of Iſaiah, which are moſt of them
                    diſtinct poems of no great length. The antithetic paralleliſm gives an acuteneſs
                    and force to adages and moral ſentences; and therefore abounds in Solomon’s
                    Proverbs, and elſewhere is not often to be met with. The poem of Job, being on a
                    large plan, and in a high tragic ſtyle, though very exact in the diviſion of the
                    lines and in the paralleliſm, and affording many fine examples of the ſynonymous
                    kind, yet conſiſts chiefly of the conſtructive. A happy mixture of the ſeveral
                    forts gives an agreeable variety: and they ſerve mutually to recommend and ſet
                    off one another.</p>
                <p>The reader will perceive that we have derived every thing we have ſaid relating
                    to Hebrew poetry from the elegant Lectures of Dr Lowth, which are beautifully
                    tranſlated by Mr Gregory, a diſtinguiſhed author as well as tranſlator.</p>
                <p>The book of Proverbs has always been accounted canonical. The Hebrew title of it
                    is <hi rend="italic">Mishli</hi><note anchored="true" n="51" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* משל׳</p></note>
                    <hi rend="italic">*</hi>, which ſignifies “ſimilitudes.” It has always been
                    aſcribed to Solomon, whoſe name it bears, though ſome have doubted whether he
                    really was the author of every one of the maxims which it contains. Thoſe in
                    chap. xxx. are indeed called <hi rend="italic">the words of Agur</hi> the ſon of
                        <hi rend="italic">Jakeh,</hi> and the title of the 31ſt or laſt chapter is
                        <hi rend="italic">the words</hi> of King <hi rend="italic">Lemuel.</hi> It
                    ſeems certain that the collection called the <hi rend="italic">Proverbs of
                        Solomon</hi> was digeſted in the order in which we now have it by different
                    hands; but it is not, therefore, to be concluded that they are not the work of
                    Solomon. Several perſons might have made collections of them: Hezekiah, among
                    others, as mentioned chapter xxv. Agur and Ezra might have done the ſame. From
                    theſe ſeveral collections the work was compiled which we have now in our
                    hands.</p>
                <p>The book of Proverbs may be conſidered under five diviſions. 1. The firſt, which
                    is a kind of preface, ex-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0128.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0122"/> tends to the 10th chapter. This contains general
                    cautions and exhortations for a teacher to his pupil, expreſſed in elegant
                    language, duly connected in its parts, illuſtrated with beautiful deſcription,
                    and well contrived to engage and intereſt the attention.</p>
                <p>2. The ſecond part extends from the beginning of chap. X. to chap, xxii. 17. and
                    conſiſts of what may ſtrictly and properly be called proverbs, viz. unconnected
                    ſentences, expreſſed with much neatneſs and ſimplicity. They are truly, to uſe
                    the language of their ſage author, “apples of gold in pictures of ſilver.”</p>
                <p>3. In the third part, which is included between chapter xxii. 16. and chapter
                    xxv. the tutor drops the ſententious ſtyle, addreſſes his pupil as preſent, and
                    delivers his advices in a connected manner.</p>
                <p>4. The proverbs which are included between chapter xχv. and chapter xxx. are
                    ſuppoſed to have been ſelected by <hi rend="italic">the men oſ Hezekiah</hi>
                    from ſome larger collection of Solomon, that is, by the prophets whom he
                    employed to reſtore the ſervice and writings of the church. Some of the proverbs
                    which Solomon had introduced into the former part of the book are here
                    repeated.</p>
                <p>5. The prudent admonitions which Agur delivered to his pupils Ithiel and Ucal are
                    contained in the 30th chapter, and in the 31ſt are recorded the precepts which
                    the mother of Lemuel delivered to her ſon.</p>
                <p>Several references are evidently made to the book of Proverbs by the writers of
                    the New Teſtament<note anchored="true" n="52" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    *.</p>
                <p>The Proverbs of Solomon afford ſpecimens of the didactic poetry of the Hebrews.
                    They abound with antithetic parallels; for this form is peculiarly adapted to
                    that kind of writing, to adages, aphoriſms, and detached ſentences. Indeed, the
                    elegance, acuteneſs, and force of a great number of Solomon’s wiſe ſayings ariſe
                    in a great meaſure from the antithetic form, the oppoſition of diction and
                    ſentiment. Take the following examples:</p>
                <p>The blows of a friend are faithful;</p>
                <p>But the kiſſes of an enemy are treacherous.</p>
                <p>The cloyed will trample upon an honeycomb;</p>
                <p>But to the hungry every bitter thing is ſweet.</p>
                <p>There is who maketh himſelf rich, and wanteth all</p>
                <p>things;</p>
                <p>Who maketh himſelf poor, yet hath much wealth.</p>
                <p>The rich man is wiſe in his own eyes,</p>
                <p>But the poor man that hath diſcernment to trace him</p>
                <p>out will deſpiſe him<note anchored="true" n="53" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The Hebrew title of the book which we call Eccleſiaſtes is <hi rend="italic"
                        >Keleth,</hi> that is, the <hi rend="italic">Gatherer</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Collector;</hi> and it is ſo called, either becauſe the work
                    itſelf is a <hi rend="italic">colle3ioη</hi> of maxims, or becauſe it was
                    delivered to an aſſembly <hi rend="italic">gathered</hi> together to hear them.
                    The Greek term <hi rend="italic">Ecclefiaſles</hi> is of the ſame import,
                    ſignifying one who <hi rend="italic">gathers</hi> together a congregation, or
                    who <hi rend="italic">diſcourses</hi> or <hi rend="italic">preaches</hi> to an
                    aſſembly convened. That Solomon was the author of this book is beyond all doubt;
                    the beautiful deſcription of the phenomena in the natural world, and their
                    cauſes; of the circulation of the blood, as ſome think<note anchored="true" n="54" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* See <hi rend="italic"
                                >Horsley's Sermon before the Humane Society.</hi></p></note> *, and
                    the economy of the human frame, ſhews it to be the work of a philoſopher. At
                    what period of his life it was written may be eaſily found out. The affecting
                    account of the infirmities of old age which it contains, is a ſtrong indication
                    that the author knew by experience what they were; and his complete conviction
                    of the vanity of all earthly enjoyments proves it to have been the work of a
                    penitent. Some paſſages in it ſeem, indeed, to expreſs an Epicurean notion of
                    Providence. But it is to be obſerved, that the author, in an academic way,
                    diſputes on both ſides of the queſtion; and at laſt concludes properly, that to
                    “fear God and keep his commandments is the whole duty of man; for God (ſays he)
                    will bring every work to judgment, and every ſecret thing, whether it be good,
                    or whether it be evil.”</p>
                <p>The general tenor and ſtyle of Eccleſiaſtes is very different from the book of
                    Proverbs, though there are many detached ſentiments and proverbs interſperſed.
                    For the whole work is uniform, and confined to one ſubject, namely, the vanity
                    of the world exemplified by the experience of Solomon, who is introduced in the
                    character of a perſon inveſtigating a very difficult queſtion, examining the
                    arguments on either ſide, and at length diſengaging himſelf from an anxious and
                    doubtful diſputation. It would be very difficult to diſtinguiſh the parts and
                    arrangement of this production; the order of the ſubject, and the connection of
                    the arguments, are involved in ſo much obſcurity, that ſcarcely any two
                    commentators have agreed concerning the plan of the work, and the accurate
                    diviſion of it into parts or ſections. The truth is, the laws of methodical
                    compoſition and arrangement were neither known by the Hebrews nor regarded in
                    their didactic writings. They uniformly retained the old ſententious manner, nor
                    did they ſubmit to method, even where the occaſion appeared to demand it. The
                    ſtyle of this work is, however, ſingular; the language is generally low; it is
                    frequently looſe, unconnected, approaching to the incorrectneſs of converſation;
                    and poſſeſſes very little of the poetical character, even in the compoſition and
                    ſtructure of the periods: which peculiarity may poſſibly be accounted for from
                    the nature of the ſubject. Contrary to the opinion of the Rabbies, Eccleſiaſtes
                    has been claſſed among the poetical books; though, if their authority and
                    opinions were of any weight or importance, they might perhaps on this occaſion
                    deſerve ſome attention.</p>
                <p>The Song of Solomon, in the opinion of Dr Lowth, is an <hi rend="italic"
                        >epithalamium</hi> or nuptial dialogue, in which the principal characters
                    are Solomon, his bride, and a chorus of virgins. Some are of opinion that it is
                    to be taken altogether in a literal ſenſe; but the generality of Jews and
                    Chriſtians have eſteemed it wholly allegorical, expreſſing the union of Jeſus
                    Chriſt and the church. Dr Lowth has ſupported the common opinion, by ſhowing
                    that the ſacred writers often apply metaphors to God and his people derived from
                    the conjugal ſtate. Our Saviour is ſtyled a <hi rend="italic">bridegroom</hi> by
                    John the Baptiſt (John iii.), and is repreſented in the ſame character in the
                    parable of the ten virgins. Michaelis, on the other hand, rejects the argument
                    drawn from analogy as inconcluſive, and the opinion of Jews and Chriſtians as of
                    no greater authority than the opinion of the moderns.</p>
                <p>The ſecond of thoſe great diviſions under which the Jews claffed the books of the
                    Old Teſtament was that of the Prophets, which formerly comprehended 16
                    books.</p>
                <p>The Prophets were 16 in number: Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Hoſea, Joel,
                    Amos, Obadiah, Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk, Zephaniah, Haggai, Ze-<pb

                    Malachi. The four firſt are called the <hi rend="italic">greater</hi> prophets;
                    the other twelve are denominated the <hi rend="italic">minor</hi> prophets.</p>
                <p>The writings of the Prophets are to Chriſtians the moſt intereſting part of the
                    Old Teſtament; for they afford one of the moſt powerful arguments for the divine
                    origin of the Chriſtian religion. If we could only prove, therefore, that theſe
                    prophecies were uttered a ſingle century before the events took place to which
                    they relate, their claim to inſpiration would be unquestionable. But we can
                    prove that the interval between their enunciation and accompliſhment extended
                    much farther, even to 500 and 1000 years, and in ſome cafes much more.</p>
                <p>The books of the prophets are mentioned by Joſephus, and therefore ſurely exiſted
                    in his time; they are alſo quoted by our Saviour, under the general denomination
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Prophets.</hi> We are informed by Tacitus and
                    Suetonius, that about 60 years before the birth of our Saviour there was an
                    univerſal expectation in the eaſt of a great perſonage who was to ariſe; and the
                    ſource of this expectation is traced by the ſame writers to the ſacred books of
                    the Jews. They exiſted alſo in the time of Amtiochus Epiphanes, A. C. 166; for
                    when that tyrant prohibited the reading of the law, the books of the Prophets
                    were ſubſtituted in its place, and were continued as a part of the daily ſervice
                    after the interdict againſt the law of Moſes was taken off. We formerly
                    remarked, that references are made by the author of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ecclesiasticus,</hi> A. C. 200, to the writings of Iſaiah, Jeremiah, and
                    Ezekiel, and that he mentions the 12 Prophets. We can aſcend ſtill higher, and
                    aſſert from the language of the Prophets, that all their writings muſt have been
                    compoſed before the Babyloniſh captivity, or within a century after it; for all
                    of them, except Daniel and Ezra, are compoſed in Hebrew, and even in them long
                    paſſages are found in that language: but it is a well known fact, that all the
                    books written by Jews about two centuries after that era are compoſed in the
                    Syriac, or Chaldaic, or Greek language.</p>
                <p>"Let any man (ſays Michaelis) compare what was written in Hebrew after the
                    Babyloniſh exile, and, I apprehend, he will perceive no leſs evident marks of
                    decay than in the Latin language.” Even in the time of Ezra, the common people,
                    from their long reſidence in Babylonia, had forgotten the Hebrew, and it was
                    neceſſary for the learned to interpret the law of Moſes to them. We can
                    therefore aſcertain with very conſiderable preciſion the date of the prophetic
                    writings; which indeed is the only important point to be determined: For whether
                    we can diſcover the authors or not, if we can only eſtabliſh their ancient date,
                    we ſhall be fully entitled to draw this concluſion, that the predictions of the
                    Prophets are inſpired.</p>
                <p>Much has been written to explain the nature of inſpiration, and to ſhow by what
                    methods God imparted to the prophets that divine knowledge which they were
                    commanded to publiſh to their countrymen. Attempts have been made to diſcloſe
                    the nature of dreams and viſions, and to deſcribe the ecſtacy or rapture to
                    which the prophets were ſuppoſed to be raiſed while they uttered their
                    predictions. Not to mention the degrading and indecent compariſon which this
                    laſt circumſtance ſuggeſts, we ſhall only inform thoſe who expect here an
                    explanation of the prophetic dreams and</p>
                <p>viſions, that <hi rend="italic">we ſhall not attempt to be wiſe above what it
                        written.</hi> The manner in which the allwiſe and unſeen God may think
                    proper to operate upon the minds of his creatures, we might expect a <hi
                        rend="italic">priori</hi> to be myſterious and inexplicable. Indeed ſuch an
                    inquiry, though it were ſucceſsful, would only gratify curioſity, without being
                    in the leaſt degree conducive to uſeful knowledge.</p>
                <p>The buſineſs of philoſophy is not to inquire how almighty power produced the
                    frame of nature, and beſtowed upon it that beauty and grandeur which is
                    everywhere conſpicuous, but to diſcover thoſe marks of intelligence and deſign,
                    and the various purpoſes to which the works of nature are ſubſervient.
                    Philoſophy has of late been directed to theology and the ſtudy of the Scriptures
                    with the happieſt effects; but it is not permitted to enter within the vail
                    which the Lord of Nature has thrown over his councils. Its province, which is
                    ſufficiently extenſive, is to examine the language of the prophecies, and to
                    diſcover their application.</p>
                <p>The character of the prophetic ſtyle varies according to the genius, the
                    education, and mode of living of the reſpective authors; but there are ſome
                    peculiarities which run through the whole prophetic books. A plain unadorned
                    ſtyle would not have ſuited thoſe men who were to wrap the myſteries of futurity
                    in a veil, which was not to be penetrated till the events themſelves ſhould be
                    accompliſhed. For it was never the intention of prophecy to unfold futurity to
                    our view, as many of the raſh interpreters of prophecy fondly imagine; for this
                    would be inconſiſtent with the free agency of man. It was therefore agreeable to
                    the wiſdom of God that prophecies ſhould be couched in a language which would
                    render them unintelligible till the period of their completion; yet ſuch a
                    language as is diſtinct, regular, and would be eaſily explained when the events
                    themſelves ſhould have taken place. This is preciſely the character of the
                    prophetic language. It is partly derived from the hieroglyphical ſymbols of
                    Egypt, to which the Iſraelites during their ſervitude were familiarized, and
                    partly from that analogy which ſubſiſts between natural objects and thoſe which
                    are moral and political.</p>
                <p>The prophets borrowed their imagery from the moſt ſplendid and ſublime natural
                    objects, from the hoſt of heaven, from ſeas and mountains, from ſtorms and
                    earthquakes, and from the moſt ſtriking revolutions in nature. The <hi
                        rend="italic">cele</hi> ſt <hi rend="italic">ial bodies</hi> they uſed as
                    ſymbols to expreſs thrones and dignities, and thoſe who enjoyed them. <hi
                        rend="italic">Earth</hi> was the ſymbol for men of low eſtate. <hi
                        rend="italic">Hades</hi> repreſents the miſerable. Asc <hi rend="italic"
                        >ending to heaven,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">depending to earthy</hi> are
                    phraſes which expreſs riling to power, or falling from it. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Great earthquakes</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">peaking oſ heaven and
                        earth,</hi> denote the commotions and overthrow of kingdoms. The sun
                    represents the whole race of kings ſhining with regal power and glory. The <hi
                        rend="italic">moon</hi> is the ſymbol of the common people. The st <hi
                        rend="italic">ars</hi> are ſubordinate princes and great men. <hi
                        rend="italic">Light</hi> denotes glory, truth, or knowledge. <hi
                        rend="italic">Darkneſs</hi> expreſſes obſcurity of condition, error, and

                    ſubjects. <hi rend="italic">Tempestuous winds,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">motion

                    belonging to them. <hi rend="italic">Houſes and ſhips</hi> ſtand for families,
                    aſſemblies, and towns. A <hi rend="italic">forest</hi> is put for a kingdom. A

                <p>Animals, as a <hi rend="italic">lion, bear, leopard, goat,</hi> are put for
                    kingdoms or political communities correſponding to their reſpective characters.
                    When a man or beaſt is put for a kingdom, the head repreſents thoſe who govern;
                    the tail thoſe who are governed; the <hi rend="italic">horns</hi> denote the
                    number of military powers or ſtates that riſe from the head. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Seeing</hi> ſignifies underſtanding; <hi rend="italic">eyes</hi> men of

                    loweſt of the people.</p>
                <p>Such is the preciſion and regularity of the prophetic language, which we learn to
                    interpret by comparing prophecies which are accompliſhed with the facts to which
                    they correſpond. So far is the ſtudy of it carried already, that a dictionary
                    has been compoſed to explain it; and it is probable, that in a ſhort time it may
                    be ſo fully underſtood, that we ſhall find little difficulty in explaining any
                    prophecy. But let us not from this expect, that the prophecies will enable us to
                    penetrate the dark clouds of futurity: No! The difficulty of applying prophecies
                    to their correſponding events, before completion, will ſtill remain
                    unſurmountable. Thoſe men, therefore, however pious and well- meaning they may
                    be, who attempt to explain and apply prophecies which are not yet accompliſhed,
                    and who delude the credulous multitude by their own romantic conjectures, cannot
                    be acquitted of raſhneſs and preſumption.</p>
                <p>The predictions of the prophets, according to the opinion of Dr Lowth, are
                    written in a poetic ſtyle. They poſſeſs indeed all the characteriſtics of Hebrew
                    poetry, with the ſingle exception, that none of them are alphabetical or
                    acroſtic, which is an artificial ar</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">rangement utterly repugnant to the nature of prophecy.</hi></p>
                <p>The other arguments, however, ought to be particularly adverted to upon this
                    ſubject: the poetic dialect, for inſtance, the diction ſo totally different from
                    the language oſ common life, and other ſimilar circumſtances, which an attentive
                    reader will eaſily diſcover, but which cannot be explained by a few examples;
                    for circumſtances which, taken ſeparately, appear but of ſmall account, are in a
                    united view frequently of the greateſt importance. To theſe we may add the
                    artificial conformation of the ſentences; which are a neceſſary concomitant of
                    metrical compoſition, the only one indeed which is now apparent, as it has
                    always appeared to us.</p>
                <p>The order in which the books of the minor prophets are placed is not the fame in
                    the Septuagint as in the Hebrew<note anchored="true" n="55" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Chronology of the Prophets.</p></note> *. According
                    to the latter, they ſtand as in our tranſlation; but in the Greek, the ſeries is
                    altered as to the ſix firſt, to the following arrangement: Hoſea, Amos, Micah,
                    Joel, Obadiah, Jonah. This change, however, is of no conſequence, ſince neither
                    in the original, nor in the Septuagint, are they placed with exact regard to the
                    time in which their ſacred authors reſpectively flouriſhed.</p>
                <p>The order in which they ſhould ſtand, if chronologically arranged, is by Blair
                    and others ſuppoſed to be as follows: Jonah, Amos, Hoſea, Micah, Nahum, Joel,
                    Zephaniah, Habbakuk, Obadiah, Haggai, Zechariah, Malachi. And this order will he
                    found to be generally conſiſtent with the periods to which the Prophets will be
                    reſpectively aſſigned in the following pages, except in the inſtance of Joel,
                    who probably flouriſhed rather earlier than he is placed by theſe chronologers.
                    The preciſe period of this prophet, however, cannot be aſcertained; and ſome
                    diſputes might be maintained concerning the priority of others alſo, when they
                    were nearly contemporaries, as Amos and Hoſea; and when the firſt prophecies of
                    a later prophet were delivered at the ſame time with, or previous to, thoſe of a
                    prophet who was called earlier to the ſacred office. The following ſcheme,
                    however, in which alſo the greater prophets will be introduced, may enable the
                    reader more accurately to comprehend the actual and relative periods in which

                    aſunder with a wooden ſaw by the command of that tyrant: but when we recollect
                    how much the traditions of the Jews were condemned by our Saviour, we will not
                    be diſpoſed to give them much credit. The time of the delivery of ſome of his
                    prophecies is either expreſsly marked, or ſufficiently clear from the hiſtory to
                    which they relate. The date of a few others may with ſome probability be deduced
                    from internal marks; from expreſſions, deſcriptions, and circumſtances
                    interwoven.</p>
                <p>Iſaiah, the firſt of the prophets both in order and, dignity, abounds in ſuch
                    tranſcendant excellencies, that</p>
                <p>he may be properly ſaid to afford the moſt perfect model of the prophetic poetry,
                    He is at once elegant and ſublime, forcible and ornamented; he unites energy
                    with copiouſneſs, and dignity with variety.<note anchored="false" n="57" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Loweth's Isaiah.</p></note> In his
                    ſentiments there is uncommon elevation and majeſty; in his imagery the utmoſt
                    propriety, elegance, dignity, and diverſity; in his language uncommon beauty and
                    energy; and, notwithſtanding the obſcurity of his ſubjects, a ſurpriſing degree
                    of clearneſs and ſimplicity. To theſe we may add, there is ſuch ſweetneſs in the
                    poetical compoſition of his ſentences, whether it proceed from art or genius,
                    that if the Hebrew poetry at preſent is poffeſſed of any remains of its native
                    grace and harmony, we ſhall chiefly find them in the writings of Iſaiah: ſo that
                    the laying of Ezekiel may moſt juſtly be applied to this prophet:</p>

                    greatly excels too in all the graces of method, order, connection, and
                    arrangement: though in afferting this we muſt not forget the nature of the
                    prophetic impulſe, which bears away the mind with irreſiſtible violence, and
                    frequently in rapid tranſitions from near to remote objects, from human to
                    divine; we muſt alſo be careful in remarking the limits of particular
                    predictions, ſince, as they are now extant, they are often improperly connected,
                    without any marks of diſcrimination; which injudicious arrangement, on ſome
                    occaſions, creates almoſt insuperable difficulties. It is, in fact, a body or
                    collection of different prophecies, nearly allied to each other as to the
                    ſubject, which, for that reaſon, having a ſort of connection, are not to be
                    ſeparated but with the utmoſt difficulty. The general ſubject is the reſtoration
                    of the church. Its deliverance from captivity; the deſtruction of idolatry; the
                    vindication of the divine power and truth; the conſolation of the Iſraelites,
                    the divine invitation which is extended to them, their incredulity, impiety, and
                    rejection; the calling in of the Gentiles; the reſtoration of the choſen people;
                    the glory and felicity of the church in its perfect ſtate; and the ultimate
                    deſtruction of the wicked—are all ſet forth with a ſufficient reſpect to order
                    and method. If we read theſe paſſages with attention, and duly regard the nature
                    and genius of the myſtical allegory, at the ſame time remembering that all theſe
                    points have been frequently touched upon in other prophecies promulged at
                    different times, we ſhall neither ſind any irregularity in the arrangement of
                    the whole, nor any want of order and connection as to matter or ſentiment in the
                    different parts. Dr Lowth eſteems the whole book of Iſaiah to be poetical, a few
                    paſſages excepted, which, if brought together, would not at moſt exceed the bulk
                    of five or ſix chapters.</p>
                <p>The 14th chapter of Iſaiah is one of the moſt ſublime odes in the Scripture, and
                    contains one of the nobleſt perſonifications to be found in the records of
                    poetry.</p>
                <p>The prophet, after predicting the liberation of the Jews from their ſevere
                    captivity in Babylon, and their reſtoration to their own country, introduces
                    them as reciting a kind of triumphal long upon the fall of the Babyloniſh
                    monarch, replete with imagery, and with the moſt elegant and animated
                    perfonifications. A ſudden exclamation, expreſſive of their joy and admiration
                    on the unexpected revolution in their affairs, and the deſtruction of their
                    tyrants, forms the exordium of the poem. The earth itſelf triumphs with the
                    inhabitants thereof; the fir-trees amd the cedars of Lebanon (under which images
                    the parabolic ſtyle frequently delineates the kings and princes of the Gentiles)
                    exult with joy, and perſecute with contemptuous reproaches the humbled power of
                    a ferocious enemy:</p>
                <p>The whole earth is at reſt, is quiet; they burſt forth into a joyful ſhout:</p>
                <p>Even the fir-trees rejoice over thee, the cedars of Lebanon:</p>
                <p>Since thou art fallen, no feller hath come up againſt us.</p>
                <p>This is followed by a bold and animated perſonification of Hades, or the infernal
                    regions;</p>
                <p>Hades from beneath is moved becauſe of thee, to meet thee at thy coming;</p>
                <p>He rouſeth for thee the mighty dead, all the great chiefs of the earth;</p>
                <p>He maketh to riſe. up from their thrones all the kings of the nations.</p>
                <p>Hades excites his inhabitants, the ghoſts of princes, and the departed ſpirits of
                    kings: they riſe immediately from their ſeats, and proceed to meet the monarch
                    of Babylon; they inſult and deride him, and comfort themſelves with the view of
                    his calamity;</p>
                <p>Art thou, even thou too, become weak as we? art thou made like unto us?</p>
                <p>Is then thy pride brought down to the grave; the found of thy ſprightly
                    inſtruments?</p>
                <p>Is the vermin become thy couch, and the earthworm thy covering?</p>
                <p>Again, the Jewiſh people are the ſpeakers, in an exclamation after the manner of
                    a funeral lamentation, which indeed the whole form of this compoſition exactly
                    imitates. The remarkable fall of this powerful monarch is thus beautifully
                    illuſtrated:</p>
                <p>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, ſon of the morning!</p>
                <p>Art cut down from earth, thou that didſt ſubdue the nations!</p>
                <p>Yet thou didſt ſay in thy heart, I will aſcend the heavens;</p>
                <p>Above the ſtars of God I will exalt my throne;</p>
                <p>And I will ſit upon the mount of the divine preſence,</p>
                <p>on the ſides of the north;</p>
                <p>I will aſcend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like the moſt High.</p>
                <p>But thou ſhalt be brought down to the grave, to the ſides of the pit.</p>
                <p>He himſelf is at length brought upon the ſtage, boaſting in the moſt pompous
                    terms of his own power; which furniſhes the poet with an excellent opportunity
                    of diſplaying the unparalleled miſery of his downfal. Some perſons are
                    introduced, who find the dead carcaſe of the king of Babylon call out and
                    expoſed; they attentively contemplate it, and at laſt ſcarcely know it to be
                    his:</p>
                <p>Is this the man that made the earth to tremble, that ſhook the kingdoms?</p>
                <p>That made the world like a deſert, that deſtroyed the cities?</p>
                <p>That never diſmiſſed his captives to their own home? All the kings of the
                    nations, all of them,</p>
                <p>Lie down in glory, each in his own ſepulchre:</p>
                <p>But thou art caſt out of the grave, as the tree abominated;</p>
                <p>Clothed with the ſlain, with the pierced by the ſword, With them that go down to
                    the ſtones of the pit; as a trodden carcaſe.</p>
                <p>Thou ſhalt not be joined unto them in burial;</p>
                <p>Becauſe thou haſt deſtroyed thy country, thou haſt ſlain</p>
                <p>thy people:</p>
                <p>The ſeed of evil doers ſhall never be renowned.</p>
                <p>They reproach him with being denied the common rites of ſepulture, on account of
                    the cruelty and atrocity of his conduct; they execrate his name, his offspring,
                    and their poſterity. A ſolemn addreſs, as of the Deity him-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0133.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0127"/> ſelf, cloſes
                    the ſcene, and he denounces againſt the king of Babylon, his poſterity, and even
                    againſt the city which was the ſeat of their cruelty, perpetual deſtruction, and
                    confirms the immutability of his own counſels by the ſolemnity of an oath.</p>
                <p>How forcible is this imagery, how diverſified, how ſublime! how elevated the
                    diction, the figures, the ſentiments! — The Jewiſh nation, the cedars of
                    Lebanon, the ghoſts of departed kings, the Babyloniſh monarch, the travellers
                    who find his corpſe, and laſt of all Jehovah himſelf, are the characters which
                    ſupport this beautiful lyric drama. One continued action is kept up, or rather a
                    ſeries of intereſting actions are connected together in an incomparable whole.
                    This, indeed, is the principal and diſtinguiſhed excellence of the ſublimer ode,
                    and is diſplayed in its utmoſt perfection in this poem of Iſaiah, which may be
                    conſidered as one of the moſt ancient, and certainly the moſt finiſhed, ſpecimen
                    of that ſpecies of compoſition which has been tranſmitted to us. The
                    perſonifications here are frequent, yet not confuſed; bold, yet not improbable:
                    a free, elevated, and truly divine ſpirit, pervades the whole; nor is there any
                    thing wanting in this ode to defeat its claim to the character of perfect beauty
                    and ſublimity. “If (ſays Dr Lowth) I may be indulged in the free declaration of
                    my own ſentiments on this occaſion, I do not know a ſingle inſtanee in the whole
                    compaſs of Greek and Roman poetry, which, in every excellence of compoſition,
                    can be ſaid to equal, or even approach it.”</p>
                <p>Jeremiah was called to the prophetic office in the 13th year of the reign of
                    Joſiah the ſon of Amon, A. M. 3376, A. C. 628, and continued to prophecy upwards
                    of 40 years, during the reigns of the degenerate princes of Judah, to whom he
                    boldly threatened thoſe marks of the divine vengeance which their rebellious
                    conduct drew on themſelves and their country. After the deſtruction of Jeruſalem
                    by the Chaldeans, he was ſuffered by Nebuchadnezzar to remain in the deſolate
                    land of Judea to lament the calamities of his infatuated countrymen. He was
                    afterwards, as he himſelf informs us, carried with his diſciple Baruch into
                    Egypt, by Johanan the ſon of Kareah.</p>
                <p>It appears from ſeveral paſſages that Jeremiah committed his prophecies to
                    writing. In the 36th chapter we are informed, that the prophet was commanded to
                    write upon a roll all the prophecies which he had uttered; and when the roll was
                    deſtroyed by Jehoiakim the king, Jeremiah dictated the ſame prophecies to
                    Baruch, who wrote them together with many additional circumſtances. The works of
                    Jeremiah extend to the laſt verſe of the 51ſt chapter; in which we have theſe
                    words, “Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.” The 52d chapter was therefore added
                    by ſome other writer. It is, however, a very important ſupplement, as it
                    illuſtrates the accompliſhment of Jeremiah’s prophecies rejecting the fate of
                    Zedekiah.</p>
                <p>The prophecies of Jeremiah are not arranged in the chronological order in which
                    they were delivered.</p>
                <p>What has occaſioned this tranſpoſition cannot now be determined. It is generally
                    maintained, that if we conſult their dates, they ought to be thus placed :</p>
                <p>In the reign of Joſiah the firſt 12 chapters.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Jehoiakim, chapters xiii. xx. xxi. v. 11, 14.; xxii. xxiii, xxv.
                    xxvi. xxxv. xxxvi. xlv.-xlix. 1 —33.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Zedekiah, chap. xxi. 1—10. xxiv, xxvii. xxxiv xxxvii. xxxix.
                    xlix. 34— 39. 1. and li.</p>
                <p>Under the government of Gedaliah, chapters xl. xliv. The prophecies which related
                    to the Gentiles were contained in the 46th and five following chapters, being
                    placed at the end, as in ſome meaſure unconnected with the reſt. But in ſome
                    copies of the Septuagint theſe ſix chapters follow immediately after the 13th
                    verſe of the 25th chapter.</p>
                <p>Jeremiah, though deficient neither in elegance nor ſublirnity, muſt give place in
                    both to Iſaiah. Jerome ſeems to object againſt him a fort of ruſticity of
                    language, no veſtige of which Dr Lowth was able to diſcover. His ſentiments, it
                    is true, are not always the moſt elevated, nor are his periods always neat and
                    compact; but theſe are faults common to thoſe writers whoſe principal aim is to
                    excite the gentler affections, and to call forth the tear of ſympathy or ſorrow.
                    This obſervation is very ſtrongly exemplified in the Lamentations, where theſe
                    are the prevailing paſſions; it is, however, frequently inſtanced in the
                    prophecies of this author, and moſt of all in the beginning of the book<note

                    poetical. The middle of it is almoſt entirely hiſtorical. The latter part,

                    ſeveral different predictions, which are diſtinctly marked; and in theſe the
                    prophet approaches very near the ſublimity of Iſaiah. On the whole, however, not
                    above half the book of Jeremiah is poetical.</p>
                <p>The book of Lamentations, as we are informed in the title, was compoſed by
                    Jeremiah. We ſhall preſent to our reader an account of this elegiac poem from
                    the elegant pen of Dr Lowth.</p>
                <p>The Lamentations of Jeremiah (for the title is properly and ſignificantly plural)
                    conſiſt of a number of plaintive effuſions, compoſed upon the plan of the
                    funeral dirges, all upon the ſame ſubject, and uttered without connection as
                    they roſe in the mind, in a long courſe of ſeparate ſtanzas. Theſe have
                    afterwards been put together, and formed into a collection or oorreſpondent
                    whole. If any reader, however, ſhould expect to find in them an artificial and
                    methodical arrangement of the general ſubject, a regular diſpoſition of the
                    parts, a perfect connection and orderly ſucceſſion in the matter, and with all
                    this an uninterrupted ſeries of elegance and correctneſs, he will, really expect
                    what was foreign to the prophet’s deſign. In the character of a mourner, he
                    celebrates in plaintive ſtrains the obſequies of his ruined country: whatever
                    preſented itſelf to his mind in the midſt of deſolation and miſery, whatever
                    ſtruck him as particularly wretched and calamitous, whatever the inſtant
                    ſentiment of ſorrow dictated, he pours forth<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0134.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0128"/> in a kind of
                    ſpontaneous effuſion. He frequently parties, and, as it were, ruminates upon the
                    ſame object; frequently varies and illuſtrates the ſame thought with different
                    imagery, and a different choice of language; ſo that the whole bears rather the
                    appearance of an accumulation of correſponding ſentiments, than an accurate and
                    connected ſeries of different ideas, arranged in the form of a regular treatiſe.
                    There is, however, no wild incoherency in the poem; the tranſlations are eaſy
                    and elegant.</p>
                <p>The work is divided into five parts; in the firſt, ſecond, and fourth chapters,
                    the prophet addreſſes the people in his own perſon, or introduces Jeruſalem as
                    ſpeaking. In the third chapter a chorus of the Jews is repreſented. In the fifth
                    the whole captive Jews pour forth their united complaints to Almighty God. Each
                    of theſe five parts is diſtributed into 22 ſtanzas, according to the number of
                    the letters of the alphabet. In the three firſt chapters theſe ſtanzas confiſt
                    of three lines. In the four firſt chapters the initial letter of each period
                    follows the order of the alphabet; and in the third chapter each verſe of the
                    ſame ſtanza begins with the ſame letter. In the fourth chapter all the ſtanzas
                    are evidently diſtichs, as alſo in the fifth, which is not acroſtic. The
                    intention of the acroſtic was to aſſiſt the memory to retain ſentences not much
                    connected. It deferves to be remarked, that the verſes of the firſt four
                    chapters are longer by almoſt one half than Hebrew verſes generally are: The
                    length of them ſeems to be on an average about 12 ſyllables. The prophet appears
                    to have choſen this meaſure as being ſolemn and melancholy<note anchored="false" n="61" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Lowth.</p></note>.</p>
                <p>"That the ſubject of the Lamentations is the deduction of the holy city and

                    theſe events are deſcribed as actually accompliſhed, and not in the ſtyle of
                    prediction merely, muſt be evident to every reader; though ſome authors of
                    conſiderable reputation<note anchored="true" n="62" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Josephus, Jerome, Usserius, c.</p></note> * have
                    imagined this poem to have been compoſed on the death of king Jofiah. The
                    prophet, indeed, has ſo copiouſly, ſo tenderly, and poetically, bewailed the
                    misfortunes of his country, that he ſeems completely to have fulfilled the
                    office and duty of a mourner. In my opinion, there is not extant any poem which
                    diſplays ſuch a happy and ſplendid ſelection of imagery in ſo concentrated a
                    ſtate. What can be more elegant and poetical, than the deſcription of that once
                    flouriſhing city, lately chief among the nations, fitting in the character of a
                    female ſolitary, afflicted, in a ſtate of widowhood, deſerted by her friends,
                    betrayed by her deareſt connections, imploring relief, and ſeeking conſolation
                    in vain? What a beautiful perſoniſication is that of “the ways of Sion mourning
                    becauſe none are come to her ſolemn feaſts?” How tender and pathetic are the
                    following complaints?</p>

                <p>Which Jehovah inflicted on me in the day of the violence of his wrath.</p>
                <p>For theſe things I weep, my eyes ſtream with water; becauſe the comforter is far

                <p>Ezekiel was carried to Babylon as a captive, and received the firſt revelations
                    from heaven, in the fifth year of Jehoiakim’s captivity, A. C. 595. The book of
                    Ezekiel is ſometimes diſtributed under different heads. In the three firſt
                    chapters the commiſſion of the prophet 19 deſcribed. From the fourth to the
                    thirty-ſecond chapter incluſive, the calamities that befel the enemies of the
                    Jews are predicted, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> the Ammonites, the Moabites, and
                    Philiſtines. The ruin of Tyre and of Sidon, and the fall of Egypt, are
                    particularly foretold; prophecies which have been fulfilled in the moſt literal
                    and aſtoniſhing manner, as we have been often aſſured by the relation of
                    hiſtorians and travellers. From the 32d chapter to the 40th he inveighs againſt
                    the hypocriſy and murmuring ſpirit of his countrymen, admoniſhing them to
                    reſignation by promiſes of deliverance. In the 38th and 39th chapters he
                    undoubtedly predicts the final return of the Jews from their diſperſion in the
                    latter days, but in a language ſo obſcure that it cannot be underſtood till the
                    event take place. The nine laſt chapters of this book furniſh the deſcription of
                    a very remarkable viſion of a new temple and city, of a new religion and
                    polity.</p>
                <p>“Ezekiel is much inferior to Jeremiah in elegance; in ſublimity he is not even
                    excelled by Iſaiah: but his ſublimity is of a totally different kind. He is
                    deep, vehement, tragical; the only ſenſation he affects to excite is the
                    terrible: his ſentiments are elevated, fervid, full of fire, indignant; his
                    imagery is crouded, magnificent, terrific, ſometimes almoſt to diſguſt: his
                    language is pompous, ſolemn, auſtere, rough, and at times unpoliſhed: he employs
                    frequent repetitions, not for the ſake of grace or elegance, but from the
                    vehemence of paſſion and indignation.<note anchored="false" n="63" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Lowth.</p></note> Whatever ſubject he treats of,
                    that he ſedulouſly purſues, from that he rarely departs, but cleaves as it were
                    to it; whence the connection is in general evident and well preſerved. In many
                    reſpects he is perhaps excelled by the other prophets; but in that ſpecies of
                    compoſition to which he ſeems by nature adapted, the forcible, the impetuous,
                    the great and ſolemn, not one of the ſacred writers is ſuperior to him. His
                    diction is ſufficiently perſpicuous; all his obſcurity conſiſts in the nature of
                    the ſubject. Viſions (as for inſtance, among others, thoſe of Hoſea, Amos, and
                    Jeremiah) are neceſſarily dark and confuted. The greater part of Ezekiel,
                    towards the middle of the book eſpecially, is poetical, whether we regard the
                    matter or the diction. His periods, however, are frequently ſo rude and
                    incompact, that I am often at a loſs how to pronounce concerning his performance
                    in this reſpect.</p>
                <p>“Iſaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, as far as relates to ſtyle, may be ſaid to hold
                    the ſame rank among the Hebrews, as Homer, Simonides, and Æſchylus among the
                    Greeks.”</p>
                <p>So full an account of Daniel and his writings has been already given under the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Daniel,</hi> that little remains to be ſaid on that
                    ſubject. Daniel flouriſhed during the ſucceſſive reigns of ſeveral Babyloniſh
                    and Median kings to the conqueſt of Babylon by Cyrus. The events recorded in the
                    6th chapter were contemporary with Darius the Mede; but in the 7th and 8th
                    chapters Daniel returns to an earlier period, to relate<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0135.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0129"/> the viſions
                    which he beheld in the three firſt years of Belſhazzar’s reign; and thoſe which
                    follow in the four laſt chapters were revealed to him in the reign of Darius.
                    The ſix laſt chapters are compoſed of prophecies delivered at different times;
                    all of which are in some degree connected as parts of one great ſcheme. They
                    extend through many ages, and furniſh the moſt ſtriking deſcription of the fall
                    of ſucceſſive kingdoms, which were to be introductory to the eſtabliſhment of
                    the Meſſiah’s reign. They characterize in deſcriptive terms the four great
                    monarchies of the world to be ſucceeded by “that kingdom which ſhould not be
                    deſtroyed.”</p>
                <p>The whole book of Daniel being no more than a plain relation of facts, partly
                    paſt and partly future, muſt be excluded the claſs of poetical prophecy. Much
                    indeed of the parabolic imagery is introduced in that book; but the author
                    introduces it as a prophet only; as viſionary and allegorical ſymbols of objects
                    and events, totally untinctured with the true poetical colouring. The Jews,
                    indeed, would refute to Daniel even the character of a prophet: but the
                    arguments under which they ſhelter this opinion are very futile; for thoſe
                    points which they maintain concerning the conditions on which the gift of
                    prophecy is imparted, the different gradations, and the diſcrimination between
                    the true prophecy and mere inſpiration, are all trifling and abſurd, without any
                    foundation in the nature of things, and totally deſtitute of ſcriptural
                    authority. They add, that Daniel was neither originally educated in the
                    prophetic diſcipline and precepts, nor afterwards lived conformably to the
                    manner of the prophets. It is not, however, eaſy to comprehend how this can
                    diminiſh his claim to a divine miſſion and inſpiration; it may poſſibly enable
                    us, indeed, to aſſign a reaſon for the diſſimilarity between the ſtyle of Daniel
                    and that of the other prophets, and for its poſſeſſing ſo little of the diction
                    and character of poetry, which the reſt ſeem to have imbibed in common from the
                    ſchools and diſcipline in which they were educated.</p>
                <p>The prophecies of Daniel appear ſo plain and intelligible after their
                    accompliſhment, that Porphyry, who wrote in the 3d century, affirms, that they
                    were written after the events to which they refer took place. A little
                    reflection will ſhow the abſurdity of this ſuppoſition. Some of the prophecies
                    of Daniel clearly refer to Antiochus Epiphanes, with whoſe oppreſſions the Jews
                    were too well acquainted. Had the book of Daniel not made its appearance till
                    after the death of Epiphanes, every Jew who read it muſt have diſcovered the
                    forgery. And what motive could induce them to receive it among their ſacred
                    books? It is impoſſible to conceive <hi rend="italic">one.</hi> Their character
                    was quite the reverſe: their reſpect for the Scriptures had degenerated into
                    ſuperſtition. But we are not left to determine this important point from the
                    character of the Jews; we have acceſs to more deciſive evidence; we are ſure
                    that the book of Daniel contains prophecies, for ſome of them have been
                    accompliſhed ſince the time of Porphyry; particularly thoſe reſpecting
                    Antichriſt: now, if it contains any prophecies, who will take upon him to affirm
                    that the divine Spirit, which dictated theſe many centuries before they were
                    fulfilled, could not alſo have delivered prophecies concerning Antiochus
                    Epiphanes?</p>
                <p>The language in which the book of Daniel is competed proves that it was written
                    about the time of the Babyloniſh captivity. Part of it is pure Hebrew; a
                    language in which none of the Jewiſh books were compoſed after the age of
                    Epiphanes. Theſe are arguments to a deiſt. To a Chriſtian the internal marks of
                    the book itſelf will ſhow the time in which it was written, and the teſtimony of
                    Ezekiel will prove Daniel to be at leaſt his contemporary<note anchored="true" n="64" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Ezek. xiv. 14. xxviii

                <p>The twelve minor prophets were ſo called, not from any ſuppoſed inferiority in
                    their writings, but on account of the ſmall ſize of their works. Perhaps it was
                    for this reaſon that the Jews joined them together, and conſidered them as one
                    volume. Theſe 12 prophets preſent in ſcattered hints a lively ſketch of many
                    particulars relative to the hiſtory of Judah and of Iſrael, as well as of other
                    kingdoms: they propheſy with hiſtorical exactneſs the fate of Babylon, of
                    Nineveh, of Tyre, of Sidon, and of Damaſcus<note anchored="false" n="65" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Gray's Key to the Old
                        Testament.</p></note>. The three laſt prophets eſpecially illuſtrate many
                    circumſtances at a period when the hiſtorical pages of Scripture are cloſed, and
                    when profane writers are entirely wanting. At firſt the Jewiſh prophets appeared
                    only as ſingle lights, and followed each other in individual ſucceſſion; but
                    they became more numerous about the time of the captivity. The light of
                    inſpiration was collected into one blaze, previous to its ſuſpenſion; and it
                    ſerved to keep alive the expectations of the Jews during the awful interval
                    which prevailed between the expiration of prophecy and its grand completion on
                    the advent of Chriſt.</p>
                <p>Hoſea has been ſuppoſed the moſt ancient of the 12 minor prophets. He flouriſhed
                    in the reign of Jeroboam II. king of Iſrael, and during the ſucceſſive reigns of
                    Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. He was therefore nearly
                    contemporary with Iſaiah, Amos, and Jonah. The prophecies of Hoſea being
                    ſcattered through the book without date or connection, cannot with any certainty
                    be chronologically arranged.</p>
                <p>Hoſea is the firſt in order of the minor prophets, and is perhaps, Jonah
                    excepted, the moſt ancient of them all. His ſtyle exhibits the appearance of
                    very remote antiquity; it is pointed, energetic, and conciſe. It bears a
                    diſtinguiſhed mark of poetical compoſition, in that priſtine brevity and
                    condenſation which is obſervable in the tentences, and which later writers have
                    in ſome meaſure neglected. This peculiarity has not eſcaped the obſervation of
                    Jerome: “He is altogether (ſays he, ſpeaking of this prophet) laconic and
                    ſententious.” But this very circumſtance, which anciently was ſuppoſed no doubt
                    to impart uncommon force and elegance, in the preſent ruinous ſtate of the
                    Hebrew literature is productive of ſo much obſcurity, that although the general
                    ſubject of this writer be ſufflciently obvious, he is the moſt difficult and
                    perplexed of all the prophets. There is, however, another reaſon for the
                    obſcurity of his ſtyle: Hoſea propheſied during the reigns of the four kings of
                    Judah, Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. The duration of his miniſtry,
                    therefore, in whatever manner we calculate, muſt include a very conſiderable
                    ſpace of time. We have now only a ſmall volume of his remaining, which ſeems to
                    contain his principal prophecies; and theſe are extant in a continued ſeries,
                    with no marks of diſtinction as to the times in which they were publiſhed, or
                    the ſubjects of which they treat. There is therefore no cauſe to wonder if, in

                <p>Concerning the date of the prophecy of Joel there are various conjectures. The
                    book itſelf affords nothing by which we can diſcover when the author lived, or
                    upon what occaſion it was written. Joel ſpeaks of a great famine, and of
                    miſchiefs that happened in conſequence of an inundation of locuſts; but nothing
                    can be gathered from ſuch general obſervations to enable us to fix the period of
                    his prophecy. St Jerome thinks (and it is the general opinion) that Joel was
                    contemporary with Hoſea. This is poſſibly true; but the foundation on which the

                    known. As this rule is not infallible, it therefore ought not to hinder us from
                    adopting any other opinion that comes recommended by good reaſons. Father Calmet
                    places him under the reign of Joſiah, at the ſame time with Jeremiah, and thinks
                    it probable that the famine to which Joel alludes, is the same with that which
                    Jeremiah predicted ch. viii. 13.</p>
                <p>The ſtyle of Joel is essentially different from that of Hoſea; but the general
                    character of his diction, though of a different kind, is not leſs poetical. He
                    is elegant, perſpicuous, copious, and fluent; he is alſo ſublime, animated, and
                        energetic.<note anchored="true" n="66" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    second chapters he diſplays the full force of the prophetic poetry, and ſhows
                    how naturally it inclines to the uſe of metaphors, allegories, and compariſons.
                    Nor is the connection of the matter leſs clear and evident than the complexion
                    of the ſtyle: this is exemplified in the diſplay of the impending evils which
                    gave riſe to the prophecy; the exhortation to repentance; the promiſes of
                    happineſs and ſucceſs both terreſtrial and eternal to thoſe who become truly
                    penitent; the reſtoration of the Israelites; and the vengeance to be taken of
                    their adverſarics. But while we allow this juſt commendation to his perſpicuity
                    both in language and arrangement, we muſt not deny that there is ſometimes great
                    obſcurity obſervable in his ſubject, and particularly in the latter part of the

                <p>Amos was contemporary with Hoſea. They both began to prophecy during the reigns
                    of Uzziah over Judah, and of Jeroboam II. over Iſrael. Amos ſaw his firſt viſion
                    two years before the earthquake, which Zechariah informs us happened in the days
                    of Uzziah. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Amos.</hi></p>
                <p>Amos was a herdſman of Tekoe, a ſmall town in the territory of Judah, and a
                    gatherer of ſycamore fruit. In the simplicity of former times, and in the happy
                    climates of the Eaſt, theſe were not conſidered as diſhonourable occupations. He
                    was no prophet (as he informed Amaziah<note anchored="true" n="68" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>† Amos vii. 25.</p></note> †), neither
                    was he a prophet’s ſon, that is, he had no regular education in theſchools of
                    the prophets.</p>
                <p>The prophecies of Amos consiſt of several diſtinct diſcourſes, which chiefly
                    reſpect the kingdom of Iſrael; yet ſometimes the prophet inveighs againſt Judah,
                    and threatens the adjacent nations, the Syrians, Philiſtincs, Tyrians, Edomites,
                    Ammonites, and Moabites.</p>

                            2 Cor. xi. 6.</p></note> §. “Many (says Dr Lowth) have followed the
                    authority of Jerome in ſpeaking of this prophet, as if he were indeed quite
                    rude, ineloquent, and deſtitute of all the embelliſhments of composition. The
                    matter is, however, far otherwiſe. Let any perſon who has candour and
                    perspicacity enough to judge, not from the man but from his writings, open the
                    volume of his predictions, and he will, I think, agree with me, that our
                    ſhepherd ‘is not a whit behind the very chief of the prophets<note anchored="true" n="71" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>‖ 2 Cor. zi.
                            5.</p></note> ‖. He will agree, that as in fublimity and magnificence he
                    is almoſt equal to the greateſt, ſo in ſplendour of diction and elegance of
                    expreſſion he is ſcarcely inferior to any. The ſame celeſtial Spirit indeed
                    actuated Iſaiah and Daniel in the court and Amos in the ſheep-folds; conſtantly
                    ſelecting ſuch interpreters of the divine will as were beſt adapted to the
                    occaſion, and ſometimes ‘from the. mouth of babes and ſucklings perfecting
                    praiſe:’ occaſionaliy employing the natural eloquence of ſome, and occaſionaliy
                    making others eloquent.”</p>
                <p>Mr Locke has observed, that the compariſons of this prophet are chiefly drawn
                    from lions and other animals with which he was most accuſtomed; but the fineſt
                    images and alluſions are drawn from ſcenes of nature. There are many beautiful
                    passages in the writings of Amos, of which we ſhall preſent one ſpecimen:</p>

                    to the ten tribes under the reign of Joaſh and Jeroboam. The book of Jonah is
                    chiefly hiſtorical, and contains nothing of poetry but the prayer of the
                    prophet. The ſacred writers, and our Lord himſelf, ſpeaks of Jonah as a prophet

                <p>The ſtvle of Micah is for the moſt part cloſe, forcible, pointed, and conciſe;
                    fometimes approaching the obſcurity of Hoſea; in many parts animated and
                    ſublime; and in general truly poetical. In his prophecies there is an elegant
                    poem, which Dr Lowth thinks is a citation from the anſwer of Balaam to the king
                    of the Moabites:</p>
                <p>Wherewith ſhall I come before Jehovah?</p>
                <p>Wherewith ſhall I bow myſelf unto the High God? Shall I come before him with
                    burnt-offerings,</p>
                <p>With calves of a year old?</p>
                <p>Will Jehovah be ρleaſed with thouſands of rams?</p>
                <p>With ten thouſands of rivers of oil?</p>
                <p>Shall I give my firſt-born for my tranſgreſſion?</p>
                <p>The fruit of my body for the ſin of my ſoul?</p>
                <p>He hath ſhowed thee, O man, what is good;</p>
                <p>And what doth Jehovah require of thee,</p>
                <p>But to do juſtice, and to love mercy,</p>
                <p>And to be humble in walking with thy God?</p>
                <p>Joſephus aſſerts, that Nahum lived in the time of Jotham king of Judah; in which
                    caſe he may be ſuppoſed to have propheſied againſt Nineveh when Tiglath-Pileſer
                    king of Aſſyria carried captive the natives of Galilee and other parts about A.
                    M. 3264. It is, however, probable, that his prophecies were delivered in the
                    reign of Hezekiah; for he appears to ſpeak of the taking of No-Ammon a city of
                    Egypt, and of the inſolent meſſengers of Sennacherib, as of things paſt; and he
                    like- wiſe deſcribes the people of Judah as ſtill in their own country, and
                    deſirous of celebrating their festivals.</p>
                <p>While Jeruſalem was threatened by Sennacherib, Nahum promiſed deliverance to
                    Hezekiah, and predicted that Judah would ſoon celebrate her ſolemn feaſts ſecure
                    from invaſion, as her enemy would no more diſturb her peace. In the ſecond and
                    third chapters Nahum foretels the downfal of the Aſſyrian empire and the final
                    deſtruction of Nineveh, which was probably accompliſhed by the Medes and
                    Babylonians, whoſe combined forces overpowered the Aſſyrians by ſurpriſe “while
                    they were folden together as thorns, and while they were drunken as drunkards,"
                    when the gates of the river were opened, the palace demoliſhed, and an
                    “overrunning flood” aſſiſted the conquerors in their devaſtation; who took an
                    endleſs ſtore of ſpoil of gold and ſilver, making an utter end of the place of
                    Nineveh, of that vaſt and populous city, whoſe walls were 100 feet high, and ſo
                    broad that three chariots could paſs abreaſt. Yet ſo completely was this
                    celebrated city deſtroyed, that even in the 2d century the ſpot on which it
                    flood could not he aſcertained, every veſtige of it being gone.</p>
                <p>It is impoſſible to read of the exact accompliſhment of the prophetic
                    denunciations againſt the enemies of the Jews, without reflecting on the
                    aſtoniſhing proofs which that nation enjoyed of the divine origin of their
                    religion. From the Babyloniſh captivity to the time of Chriſt they had
                    numberleſs inſtances of the fulfilment of their prophecies.</p>
                <p>The character of Nahum as a writer is thus deſcribed by Dr Lowth: "None of the
                    minor prophets ſeem to equal Nahum in boldneſs, ardour, and ſublimity. His
                    prophecy, too, forms a regular and perfect poem; the exordium is not merely
                    magnificent, it is truly majeſtic; the preparation for the deſtruction of
                    Nineveh, and the description of its downfal and deſolation, are expreſſed in the
                    moſt vivid colours, and are bold and luminous in the higheſt degree.”</p>
                <p>As the prophet Habakkuk makes no mention of the Aſſyrians, and ſpeaks of the
                    Chaldean invaſions as near at hand, he probably lived after the deſtruction of
                    the Aſſyrian empire in the fall of Nineveh A. M. 3392, and not long before the
                    devaſtation of Judea by Nebuchadnezzar. Habakkuk was then nearly contemporary
                    with Jeremiah, and predicted the ſame events. A general account of Habakkuk’s
                    prophecies have already been given under the word <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>Zephaniah, who was contemporary with Jeremiah, propheſied in the reign of Joſiah
                    king of Judah; and from the idolatry which he deſcribes as prevailing at that
                    time, it is probable that his prophecies were delivered before the laſt
                    reformation made by that pious prince A. M. 3381.</p>
                <p>The account which Zephaniah and Jeremiah give of the idolatries of their age is
                    ſo ſimilar, that St Iſiodere aſſerts, that Zephaniah abridged the deſcriptions
                    of Jeremiah. But it is more probable that the prophecies of Zephaniah were
                    written ſome years before thoſe of his contemporary; for Jeremiah ſeems to
                    repreſent the abuſes as partly removed which Zephaniah deſcribes as flagrant and

                <p>In the firſt chapter Zephaniah denounces the wrath of God againſt the idolaters
                    who worſhipped Baal and the hold of heaven, and againſt the violent and
                    deceitful. In the ſecond chapter the prophet threatens deſtruction to the
                    Philiſtines, the Moabites, the Ammonites, and Ethiopians; and deſcribes the fate
                    of Nineveh in emphatic terras; “Flocks ſhall lie down in the midſt of her; all
                    the beaſts off the nations, both the cormorant and bittern, ſhall lodge in her;
                    their voice ſhall ſing in the windows; deſolation ſhall be in the threſholds.”
                    In the third chapter the prophet inveighs againſt the pollutions and oppreſſions
                    of the Jews; and concludes with the promiſe, “That a remnant would be ſaved, and
                    that multiplied bleſſings would be beſtowed upon the penitent.” The ſtyle of
                    Zephaniah is poetical, but is not diſtinguiſhed by any peculiar elegance or
                    beauty, though generally animated and impreſſive.</p>
                <p>Haggai, the tenth of the minor prophets, was the firſt who flouriſhed among the
                    Jews after the Babyloniſh captivity. He began to propheſy in the ſecond</p>
                <p>year of Darius Hyſtafpes, about 520 years before Chriſt.</p>
                <p>The intention of the propheſy of Haggai was to encourage the diſpirited Jews to
                    proceed with the building of the temple. The only, prediction mentioned refers
                    to the Meſſiah, whom the prophet aſſures his countrymen would fill the new
                    temple with glory. So well was this prediction underſtood by the Jews, that they
                    looked with earneſt expectation for the Meſſiah’s appearing in this temple till
                    it was deſtroyed by the Romans. But as the victorious Meſſiah, whom they
                    expected, did not then appear, they have ſince applied the prophecy to a third
                    temple, which they hope to ſee reared in ſome future period.</p>
                <p>The ſtyle of Haggai, in the opinion of Dr Lowth, is proſaic. Dr Newcome thinks
                    that a great part of it is poetical.</p>
                <p>Zechariah was undoubtedly a contemporary of Haggai, and began to prophecy two
                    months after him, in the eighth month of the ſecond year of Darius Hyſtaſpes, A.
                    M. 3484, being commiſſioned as well as Haggai to exhort the Jews to proceed in
                    the building of the temple after the interruption which the work had ſuffered.
                    We are informed by Ezra (vi. 14.), that the Jews proſpered through the
                    propheſying of Zechariah and Haggai.</p>
                <p>Zechariah begins with general exhortations to his countrymen, exciting them to
                    repent from the evil ways of their fathers, whom the prophets had admoniſhed in
                    vain. He deſcribes angels of the Lord interceding for mercy on Jeruſalem and the
                    deſolate cities of Judah, which had experienced the indignation of the Moſt High
                    for 70 years while the neighbouring nations were at peace. He declares, that the
                    houſe of the Lord ſhould be built in Jeruſalem, and that Zion ſhould be
                    comforted. The prophet then repreſents the increaſe and proſperity of the Jews
                    under ſeveral typical figures. He deſcribes the eſtabliſhment of the Jewiſh
                    government and the coming of the Meſſiah. He admoniſhes thoſe who obſerved
                    ſolemn faſts without due contrition, to execute juſtice, mercy, and compaſſion,
                    every man to his brother; not to oppreſs the widow nor the fatherleſs, the
                    ſtranger nor the poor. He promiſes, that God would again ſhow favour to
                    Jeruſalem; that their mournful faſts ſhould be turned into cheerful feaſts; and
                    that the church of the Lord ſhould be enlarged by the acceſſion of many
                    nations.</p>
                <p>The 12th verſe of the 11th chapter of this book, which exhibits a prophetic
                    deſcription of ſome circumſtances afterwards fulfilled in our Saviour, appears
                    to be cited by St Matthew (xxvii. 9, 10.) as ſpoken by Jeremiah; and as the
                    11th, 12th, and 13th chapters have been thought to contain ſome particulars more
                    ſuitable to the age of Jeremiah than to that of Zechariah, ſome learned writers
                    are of opinion that they were written by the former prophet, and have been from
                    ſimilarity of ſubject joined by miſtake to thoſe of Zechariah. But others are of
                    opinion, that St Matthew might allude to ſome traditional prophecy of Jeremiah,
                    or, what is more probable, that the name of Jeremiah was ſubſtituted by miſtake
                    in place of Zechariah.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0139.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0133"/> The 12th, 13th, and 14th chapters contain
                    prophecies which refer entirely to the Chriſtian dispenlation; the circumſtances
                    attending which he deſcribes with a clearneſs which indicated their near
                    approach.</p>
                <p>The ſtyle of Zechariah is ſo ſimilar to that of Jeremiah, that the Jews were
                    accuſtomed to remark that the ſpirit of Jeremiah had paſſed into him. He is
                    generally proſaic till towards the concluſion of his work, when he becomes more
                    elevated and poetical. The whole is beautifully connected by eaſy tranſitions,
                    and preſent and future ſcenes are blended with the greateſt delicacy.</p>
                <p>Malachi was the laſt prophet that flouriſhed under the Jewiſh diſpenſation; but
                    neither the time in which he lived, nor any particulars of his hiſtory, can now
                    be aſcertained. It is even uncertain whether the word Malachi be a proper name,
                    or denote, as the Septuagint have rendered it, h <hi rend="italic">is

                    ſuppoſed, that Malachi was an angel incarnate, and not a man. The ancient
                    Hebrews, the Chaldee paraphraſt, and St Jerome, are of opinion he was the ſame
                    perſon with Ezra: but if this was the caſe, they ought to have aſſigned ſome
                    reaſon for giving two different names to the ſame perſon.</p>
                <p>As it appears from the concurring teſtimony of all the ancient Jewiſh and
                    Chriſtian writers, that the light of prophecy expired in Malachi, we may ſuppoſe
                    that the termination of his miniſtry coincided with the accompliſhment of the
                    firſt ſeven weeks of Daniel’s prophecy, which was the period appointed for
                    ſealing the viſion and prophecy. This, according to Prideaux’s account, took
                    place in A. M. 3595; but, according to the calculations of Biſhop Lloyd, to A.
                    M. 3607, twelve years later. Whatever reckoning we prefer, it muſt be allowed
                    that Malachi completed the canon of the Old Teſtament about 400 years before the
                    birth of Chriſt.</p>
                <p>It appears certain that Malachi propheſied under Nehemiah, and after Haggai and
                    Zechariah, at a time when great diſorders reigned among the prieſts and people
                    of Judah, which are reproved by Malachi. He inveighs againſt the prieſts (i. 6,
                    amp;c. ii. 1, 2, amp;c.); he reproaches the people with having taken ſtrange
                    wive3 (ii. 11.); he reproves them for their inhumanity towards their brethren
                    (ii. 10. iii. 5.); their too frequently divorcing their wives; their neglect of
                    paying their tithes and firſt-fruits (Mal. iii. 13.). He ſeems to allude to the
                    covenant that Nehemiah renewed with the Lord (iii. 10. and ii. 4, 5, amp;c.),
                    aſſiſted by the prieſts and the chief of the nation. He ſpeaks of the ſacriſice
                    of the new law, and of the abolition of thoſe of the old, in theſe words (i. 10,
                    11, 12, 13.): “I have no pleaſure in you, faith the Lord of hoſts, neither will
                    I accept an offering at your hand. For from the riſing of the ſun, even unto the
                    going down of the ſame, my name ſhall be great among the Gentiles, and in every
                    place incenſe ſhall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering: for my name
                    ſhall be great among the Heathen, ſaith the Lord of hoſts.” He declares that the
                    Lord was weary with the impiety of Iſrael; and aſſures them, that the Lord whom
                    they fought</p>
                <p>ſhould ſuddenly come to his temple preceded by the meſſenger of the covenant, who
                    was to prepare his way; that the Lord when he appeared ſhould purify the ſons of
                    Levi from their unrighteouſneſs, and refine them as metal from the droſs; and
                    that then the offering of Judah, the ſpiritual ſacriſice of the heart, ſhould be
                    pleaſant to the Lord. The prophet, like one who was delivering a laſt meſſage,
                    denounces deſtruction againſt the impenitent in emphatic and alarming words. He
                    encourages thoſe who feared the name of the Lord with the animating promiſe,
                    that the “Sun of righteouineſs ſhould ariſe with ſalvation in his rays,” and
                    render them triumphant over the wicked. And now that prophecy was to ceaſe, and
                    miracles were no more to be performed till the coming of the Meſſiah; now that
                    the Jews were to be left to the guidance of their own reaſon, and the written
                    inſtructions of their prophets—Malachi exhorts them to remember the law of
                    Moſes, which the Lord had revealed from Horeb for the ſake of all Iſrael. At
                    length he ſeals up the prophecies of the Old Teſtament, by predicting the
                    commencement of the new diſpenſation, which ſhould be uſhered in by John the
                    Baptiſt with the power and ſpirit of Elijah; who ſhould turn the hearts of
                    fathers and children to repentance; but if his admonitions ſhould be rejected,
                    that the Lord would ſmite the land with a curſe.</p>

                    ſolid, the Chriſtian religion is fully eſtabliſhed. The proofs for the
                    authenticity of the New Teſtament have this peculiar advantage, that they are
                    plain and ſimple, and involve no metaphyſical ſubtilties.— Every man who can

                    blinded by prejudice, or corrupted by licentiouſneſs, as to attempt by ſophiſtry
                    to elude them, their ſophiſtry will be eaſily detected by every man of common
                    underſtanding, who has read the hiſtorical evidence with candour and attention.
                    Inſtead, therefore, of declaiming againſt the infidel, we ſolicit his attention
                    to this ſubject, convinced, that where truth reſides, it will ſhine with ſo
                    conſtant and clear a light, that the combined ingenuity of all the deiſts ſince
                    the beginning of the world will never be able to extinguiſh or to obſcure it. If
                    the books of the New Teſtament are really genuine, oppoſition will incite the
                    Chriſtian to bring forward the evidence; and thus by the united efforts of the
                    deiſt and the Chriſtins, the arguments will be ſtated with all the clearneſs and
                    accuracy of which they are ſuſceptible in ſo remarkable a degree.</p>
                <p>It is ſurpriſing that the adverſaries of Chriſtianity have not always made their
                    firſt attacks in this quarter; for if they admit that the writings of the New
                    Teſtament are as ancient as we affirm, and compoſed by the perſons to whom they
                    are aſcribed, they muſt allow, if they reaſon fairly, that the Chriſtian
                    religion is true.</p>
                <p>The apoſtles allude frequently in their epiſtles to the gift of miracles, which
                    they had communicated to the Chriſtian converts by the impoſition of hands, in
                    confirmation of the doctrine delivered in their ſpeeches and writings, and
                    ſometimes to miracles which they themſelves had performed.<note anchored="false" n="86" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Michaelis's Introduction to
                            the New Testament.</p></note> Now if theſe epiſtles are really genuine,
                    it is hardly poſſible to deny thoſe miracles to be true. The caſe is here
                    entirely different from that of an hiſtorian, who relates extraordinary events
                    in the courſe of his narrative, ſince either credulity or an actual intention to

                    the Chriſtian religion make this objection: but to write to perſons with whom we

                    would require ſuch an incredible degree of effrontery, that he who poſſeſſed it

                    adverſaries the faireſt opportunity to detect his impoſture, would ruin the

                    it by the perſecution of the populace. In this epiſtle he appeals to the
                    miracles which he had performed, and to the gifts of the Holy Spirit which he
                    had communicated. Now, is it poſſible, without forfeiting all pretenſions to
                    common ſenſe, that, in writing to a community which he had lately eſtabliſhed,
                    he could ſpeak of miracles performed, and gifts of the Holy Ghoſt communicated,
                    if no member of the ſociety had ſeen the one, or received the other?</p>

                    as the third century, no leſs ſevere were they in their inquiries, and guarded
                    againſt deception, at the introduction of Chriſtianity. This character is given
                    them even by Lucian, a writer of the ſecond century, who vented his ſatire not

                <p>It is readily acknowledged, that the arguments drawn from the authenticity of the
                    New Teſtament only eſtabliſh the truth of the miracles performed by the
                    apoſtles, and are not applicable to the miracles of our Saviour; yet, if we
                    admit the three firſt goſpels to be genuine, the truth of the Chriſtian religion
                    will be proved from the prophecies of Jeſus. For if theſe goſpels were compoſed
                    by Matthew, Mark, and Luke, at the time in which all the primitive Chriſtians
                    affirm, that is, previous to the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, they muſt be
                    inſpired; for they contain a circumſtantial prophecy of the deſtruction of
                    Jeruſalem, and determine the period at which it was accompliſhed. Now it was
                    impoſſible that human ſagacity could foreſee that event; for when it was
                    predicted nothing was more improbable. The Jews were reſolved to avoid an open
                    rebellion, well knowing the greatneſs of their danger, and ſubmitted to the
                    oppreſſions of their governors in the hope of obtaining redreſs from the court
                    of Rome.— The circumſtance which gave birth to theſe misfortunes is ſo trifling
                    in itſelf, that, independent of its conſequences, it would not deſerve to be
                    recorded. In the narrow entrance to a ſynagogue in Caeſarea, ſome perſon had
                    made an offering of birds merely with a view to irritate the Jews. The inſult
                    excited their indignation, and occaſioned the ſhedding of blood. Without this
                    trifling accident, which no human wiſdom could foreſee even the day before it
                    happened, it is poſſible that the prophecy of Jeſus would never have been
                    fulfilled. But Florus, who was then procurator of Judea, converted this private
                    quarrel into public hoſtilities, and Compelled the Jewiſh nation to rebel
                    contrary to its wiſh and reſolution, in order to avoid what the Jews had
                    threatened, an impeachment before the Roman emperor for his exceſſive cruelties.
                    But even after this rebellion had broken out, the deſtruction of the temple was
                    a very improbable event. It was not the practice of the Romans to deſtroy the
                        magnificent<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0141.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0135"
                    /> edifices of the nations which they ſubdued; and of all the Roman generals,
                    none was more unlikely to demoliſh ſo ancient and auguſt a building as Titus
                    Veſpaſian.</p>
                <p>So important then is the queſtion, Whether the books of the New Teſtament be
                    genuine? that the arguments which prove their authenticity, prove alſo the truth
                    of the Chriſtian religion. Let us now conſider the evidence which proves the
                    authenticity of the New Teſtament.</p>
                <p>We receive the books of the New Teſtament as the genuine works of Matthew, Mark,
                    Luke, John, and Paul, for the ſame reaſon that we receive the writings of
                    Xenophon, of Polybius, of Plutarch, of Caeſar, and of Livy. We have the
                    uninterrupted teſtimony of all ages, and we have no reaſon to ſuſpect
                    impoſition. This argument is much ſtronger when applied to the books of the New
                    Teſtament than when applied to any other writings; for they were addreſſed to
                    large ſocieties, were often read in their preſence, and acknowledged by them to
                    be the writings of the apoſtles.— Whereas, the moſt eminent profane writings
                    which ſtill remain were addreſſed only to individuals, or to no perſons at all:
                    and we have no authority to affirm that they were read in public; on the
                    contrary, we know that a liberal education was uncommon; books were ſcarce, and
                    the knowledge of them was confined to a few individuals in every nation.</p>
                <p>The New Teſtament was read over three quarters of the world, while profane
                    writers were limited to one nation or to one country. An uninterrupted
                    ſucceſſion of writers from the apoſtolic ages to the preſent time quote the
                    ſacred writings, or make alluſions to them: and theſe quotations and alluſions
                    are made not only by friends but by enemies. This cannot be aſſerted of even the
                    beſt claſſic authors. And it is highly probable, that the tranſlations of the
                    New Teſtament were made ſo early as the ſecond century; and in a century or two
                    after, they became very numerous. After this period, it was impoſſible to forge
                    new writings, or to corrupt the ſacred text, unleſs we can ſuppoſe that men of
                    different nations, of different ſentiments and different languages, and often
                    exceedingly hoſtile to one another, ſhould all agree in one forgery. This
                    argument is ſo ftrong, that if we deny the authenticity of the New Teſtament, we
                    may with a thouſand times more propriety reject all the other writings in the
                    world: we may even throw aſide human teſtimony itſelf. But as this ſubject is,
                    of great importance, we ſhall conſider it at more length; and to enable our
                    readers to judge with the greater accuracy, we ſhall ſtate, from the valuable
                    work of Michaelis, as tranſlated by the judicious and learned Mr Marfh, the
                    reaſons which may induce a critic to ſuſpect a work to be ſpurious.</p>
                <p>I. When doubts have been made from its firſt appearance in the world, whether it
                    proceeded from the author to whom it is aſcribed. 2. When the immediate friends
                    of the pretended author, who were able to decide upon the ſubject, have denied
                    it to be his production. 3. When a long ſeries of years has elapſed after his
                    death, in which the book was unknown, and in which it muſt unavoidably have been
                    mentioned and quoted, had it really exiſted. 4. When the ſtyle is different from
                    that of his other writings, or, in caſe no other remain, different from that
                    which might reaſonably be expected. 5. When events are recorded which happen
                    later than the time of the pretended author. 6. When opinions are advanced which
                    contradict thoſe he is known to maintain in his other writings. Though this
                    latter argument alone leads to no poſitive concluſion, ſince every man is liable
                    to change his opinion, or through forgetfulneſs to vary in the circumſtances of
                    the ſame relation, of which Joſephus, in his Antiquities and War of the Jews,
                    affords a ſtriking example.</p>
                <p>I. But it cannot be ſhown that any one doubted of its authenticity in the period
                    in which it firſt appeared. 2. No ancient accounts are on record whence we may
                    conclude it to be ſpurious. 3. No conſiderable period elapſed after the death of
                    the apoſtles, in which the New Teſtament was unknown; but, on the contrary, it
                    is mentioned by their very contemporaries, and the accounts of it in the ſecond
                    century are ſtill more numerous. 4. No argument can be brought in its disfavour
                    from the nature of the ſtyle, it being exactly ſuch as might be expected from
                    the apoſtles, not Attic but Jewiſh Greek. 5. No facts are recorded which
                    happened after their death. 6. No doctrines are maintained which contradict the
                    known tenets of the authors, ſince, beſide the New Teſtament, no writings of the
                    apoſtles exiſt. But, to the honour of the New Teſtament be it ſpoken, it
                    contains numerous contradictions to the tenets and doctrines of the fathers in
                    the ſecond and third century, whoſe morality was different from that of the
                    goſpel, which recommends fortitude and ſubmiſſion to unavoidable evils, but not
                    that enthuſiaſtic ardour for martyrdom for which thoſe centuries are
                    diſtinguiſhed; it alludes to ceremonies which in the following ages were either
                    in diſuſe or totally unknown; all which circumſtances infallibly demonſtrate
                    that the New Teſtament is not a production of either of thoſe centuries.</p>
                <p>We ſhall now conſider the poſitive evidence for the authenticity of the New
                    Teſtament. Theſe may be arranged under the three following heads;</p>
                <p>1. The impoſſibility of a forgery, ariſing from the nature of the thing itſelf.
                    2. The ancient Chriſtian, Jewiſh, and Heathen teſtimony in its favour. 3. Its
                    own internal evidence.</p>
                <p>I. The impoſſibility of a forgery ariſing from the nature of the thing itſelf is
                    evident. It is impoſſible to eſtabliſh forged writings as authentic in any place
                    where there are perlons ſtrongly inclined and well qualified to detect the
                    fraud. Now the Jews were the moſt violent enemies of Ghriſtianity. They put the
                    founder of it to death; they perſecuted his diſciples with implacable fury; and
                    they were anxious to ſtifle the new religion in its birth. If the writings of
                    the New Teſtament had been forged, would not the Jews have detected the
                    impoſture? Is there a ſingle inſtance on record where a few individuals have
                    impoſed a hiſtory upon the world againſt the teſtimony of a whole nation? Would
                    the inhabitants of Paleſtine have received the goſpels, if they had not had
                    ſufficient evidence that Jeſus Chriſt really appeared among them, and performed
                    the miracles aſcribed to him? Or would the churches of Rome or of Corinth have
                    acknowledged the epiſtles addreſſed to them as the genuine works of Paul, if
                    Paul had never preached among them? We might as well think to prove, that the
                    hiſtory of the Reformation is the in-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0142.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0136"/> vention of hiſtorians; and that no revolution
                    happened in Great Britain during the laſt century.</p>
                <p>2. The second kind of evidence which we produce to prove the authenticity of the
                    New Teſtament, is the teſtimony of ancient writers, Chriſtians, Jews, and
                    Heathens.</p>
                <p>In reviewing the evidence of teſtimony, it will not be expected that we ſhould
                    begin at the preſent age, and trace backwards the authors who have written on
                    this ſubject to the ſirſt ages of Chriſtianity. This indeed, though a laborious
                    taſk, could be performed in the moſt complete manner; the whole ſeries of
                    authors, numerous in every age, who have quoted from the books of the New
                    Teſtament, written commentaries upon them, tranſlated them into different
                    languages, or who have drawn up a list of them, could be exhibited ſo as to form
                    ſuch a perfect body of evidence, that we imagine even a jury of deiſts would
                    find it impoſſible, upon a deliberate and candid examination, to reject or
                    diſbelieve it. We do not, however, ſuppoſe that ſcepticiſm has yet arrived at ſo
                    great a height as to render ſuch a tedious and circumſtantial evidence
                    neceſſary. Paſſing over the intermediate ſpace, therefore, we ſhall aſcend at
                    once to the fourth century, when the evidence for the authenticity of the New
                    Teſtament was fully eſtabliſhed, and trace it back from that period to the age
                    of the apoſtles. We hope that this method of ſtating the evidence will appear
                    more natural, and will afford more ſatisfaction, than that which has been
                    uſually adopted.</p>
                <p>It is ſurely more natural, when we inveſtigate the truth of any fact which
                    depends on a ſeries of teſtimony, to begin with thoſe witneſſes who lived
                    neareſt the preſent age, and whoſe characters are beſt eſtabliſhed. In this way
                    we ſhall learn from themſelves the foundation of their belief, and the
                    characters of thoſe from whom they derived it; and thus we aſcend till we arrive
                    at its origin. This mode of inveſtigation will give more ſatisfaction to the
                    deiſt than the uſual way; and we believe no Chriſtian, who is confident of the
                    goodneſs of his cauſe, will be unwilling to grant any proper conceſſions. The
                    deiſt will thus have an opportunity of examining, ſeparately, what he will
                    conſider as the weakeſt parts of the evidence, thoſe which are exhibited by the
                    earlieſt Chriſtian writers, conſiſting of expreſſions, and not quotations, taken
                    from the New Teſtament. The Chriſtian, on the other hand, ought to wiſh, that
                    theſe apparently weak parts of the evidence were diſtinctly examined, for they
                    will afford an irrefragable proof that the New Teſtament was not forged: and
                    ſhould the deiſt reject the evidence of thoſe early writers, it will be
                    incumbent on him to account for the origin of the Chriſtian religion, which he
                    will find more difficult than to admit the common hypotheſis.</p>
                <p>In the fourth century we could produce the teſtimonies of numerous witneſſes to
                    prove that the books of the New Teſtament exiſted at that time; but it will be
                    ſufficient to mention their names, the time in which they wrote, and the
                    ſubſtance of their evidence. This we ſhall preſent in a conciſe form in the
                    following table, which is taken from Jones’s New and Full Method of eſtabliſhing

                <p> We now <hi rend="italic">go</hi> back to Euſebius, who wrote about the year 315,
                    and whole catalogue of the books of the New Teſtament we ſhall mention at more
                    length. “Let us ebſerve (ſays he) the writings of the apoſtle John, which are
                        <hi rend="italic">uncontradicted;</hi> and, firſt of all, muſt be mentioned,
                    as acknowledged of all, the goſpel, according to him, well known to all the
                    churches under heaven.” The author then proceeds to relate the occaſions of
                    writing the goſpels, and the reaſons for placing St John’s the laſt, manifeſtly
                    ſpeaking of all the four as equal in their authority, and in the certainty of
                    their original. The ſecond paſſage is taken from a chapter, the tide of which
                    is, Of the Scriptures univerſally acknowledged, and of thoſe that are not ſuch.”
                    Euſebius begins his enumeration in the following manner: “In the firſt place,
                    are to be ranked the ſacred four Goſpels, then the book of the Acts of the
                    Apoſtles; after that are to be reckoned the Epiſtles of Paul: in the next place,
                    that called the firſt Epiſtle of John and the Epiſtle of Peter are to be
                    eſteemed authentic: after this is to be placed, if it be thought fit, the
                    Revelation of John; about which we ſhall obſerve the different opinions at
                    proper ſeaſons. Of the controverted, but yet well known or approved by the moſt,
                    are that called the Epiſtle of James and that of Jude, the ſecond of Peter, and
                    the ſecond and third of John, whether they were written by the evangeliſt or by
                    another of the ſame name.” He then proceeds to reckon up five others, not in our
                    canon, which he calls in one place <hi rend="italic">ſpurious,</hi> in another
                        <hi rend="italic">controverted;</hi> evidently meaning the ſame thing by

                            evident from a clauſe in this very chapter, where, ſpeaking of the
                            Goſpels of Peter and Thomas, and Matthias and ſome others, he ſays,
                            “They are not ſo much as to be reckoned among the <hi rend="italic"
                                >ſpurious,</hi> but are to be rejected as altogether abſurd and

                <p>A. D. 290, Victorin biſhop of Pettaw in Germany, in a commentary upon this text
                    of the Revelation, “The firſt was like a lion, the ſecond was like a calf, the
                    third like a man, and the fourth like a flying eagle,” makes out, that by the
                    four creatures are intended the four goſpels; and to (how the propriety of the
                    ſymbols, he recites the ſubject with which each evangeliſt opens his hiſtory.
                    The explication is fanciful, but the teſtimony poſitive. He alſo expreſsly cites
                    the Acts of the Apoſtles.</p>
                <p>A. D. 230, Cyprian biſhop of Carthage gives the following teſtimony: “The church
                    (ſays this father) is watered like Paradiſe by four rivers, that is, by four
                    goſpels.” The Acts of the Apoſtles are alſo frequently quoted by Cyprian under
                    that name, and under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Divine Scriptures.”</hi>
                    In his various writings are ſuch frequent and copious citations of Scripture, as
                    to place this part of the teſtimony beyond controverſy. Nor is there, in the
                    works of this eminent African biſhop, one quotation of a ſpurious or apocryphal
                    Chriſtian writing.</p>
                <p>A. I). 210, Origen is a moſt important evidence. Nothing can be more peremptory
                    upon the ſubject now under conſideration, and, from a writer of his learning and
                    information, nothing more ſatisfactory, than the declaration of Origen,
                    preſerved in an extract of his works by Euſebius: “That the four goſpels alone
                    are received without diſpute by the whole church of God under heaven:” to which
                    declaration is immediately ſubjoined</p>
                <p>a brief hiſtory of the reſpective authors, to whom they were then, as they are
                    now, aſcribed. The ſentiments expreſſed concerning the goſpels in all the works
                    of Origen which remain, entirely correſpond with the teſtimony here cited. His
                    atteſtation to the Acts of the Apoſtles is no leſs poſitive: “And Luke alſo once
                    more founds the trumpet relating the Acts of the Apoſtles.” That the Scriptures
                    were then univerſally read, is plainly affirmed by this writer in a paſſage in
                    which he is repelling the objections of Celſus, “That it is not in private
                    books, or ſuch as arc read by few only, and thoſe ſtudious perſons, but in books
                    read by every body, that it is written, the inviſible things of God from the
                    creation of the world are clearly ſeen, being underſtood by things that are
                    made.” It is to no purpoſe to ſingle out quotations of Scripture from ſuch a
                    writer as this. We might as well make a ſelection of the quotations of Scripture
                    in Dr Clarke’s ſermons. They are ſo thickly ſown in the works of Origen, that Dr
                    Mill ſays, “If we had all his works remaining, we ſhould have before us almoſt
                    the whole text of the Bible.”</p>
                <p>A. D. 194, Tertullian exhibits the number of the goſpels then received, the names
                    of the evangeliſts, and their proper deſignations, in one ſhort ſentence.— “
                    Among the apoſtles, John and Matthew teach us the faith; among apoſtolical men,
                    Luke and Mark refreſh it.” The next paſſage to be taken from Tertullian affords
                    as complete an atteſtation to the authenticity of the goſpels as can be well
                    imagined. After enumerating the churches which had been founded by Paul at
                    Corinth, in Galatia, at Philippi, Theſſalonica, and Epheſus, the church of Rome
                    eſtabliſhed by Peter and Paul, and other churches derived from John, he proceeds
                    thus: “I ſay then, that with them, but not with them only which are apoſtolical,
                    but with all who have fellowſhip with them in the ſame faith, is that goſpel of
                    Luke received from its firſt publication, which we ſo zealouſly maintain;” and
                    presently afterwards adds, “The ſame authority of the apoſtolical churches will
                    ſupport the other goſpels, which we have from them, and according to them, I
                    mean John’s and Matthew’s, although that likewiſe which Mark publiſhed may be
                    ſaid to be Peter’s, whoſe interpreter Mark was.” In another place Tertullian
                    affirms, that the three other goſpels, as well as St Luke’s, were in the hands
                    of the churches from the beginning. This noble teſtimony proves inconteſtably
                    the antiquity of the goſpels, and that they were univerſally received; that they
                    were in the hands of all, and had been ſo from the firſt. And this evidence
                    appears not more than 150 years after the publication of the books. Dr Lardner
                    obſerves, “that there are more and larger quotations of the ſmall volume of the
                    New Teſtament in this one Chriſtian author, than there are of all the works of
                    Cicero, in writers of all characters, for ſeveral ages.”</p>
                <p>A. D. 178, Irenæus was biſhop of Lyons, and is mentioned hy Tertullian, Euſebius,
                    Jerome, and Photius. In his youth he had been a diſciple of Polycarp, who was a
                    diſciple of John. He aſſerts of himſelf and his contemporaries, that they were
                    able to rec-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0144.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0138"/>
                    kon up in all the principal churches the ſucceſſion of biſhops to their firſt
                    inſtitution. His teſtimony to the four goſpels and Acts of the Apoſtles is
                    expreſs and poſitive. “We have not received,” ſays Irenæus, “the knowledge of
                    the way of our ſalvation by any others than thoſe by whom the goſpel has been
                    brought to us. Which goſpel they firſt preached, and afterwards, by the will of
                    God, committed to writing, that it might be for time to come the foundation and
                    pillar of our faith. For after that our Lord roſe from the dead, and they (the
                    apoſtles) were endowed from above with the power of the Holy Ghoſt coming down
                    upon them, they received a perfect knowledge of all things. They then went forth
                    to all the ends of the earth, declaring to men the bleſſing of heavenly peace,
                    having all of them, and every one alike, the goſpel of God. Matthew then, among
                    the Jews, wrote a goſpel in their own language, while Peter and Paul were
                    preaching the goſpel at Rome, and founding a church there. And after their exit,
                    Mark alſo, the diſciple and interpreter of Peter, delivered to us in writing the
                    things that had been preached by Peter. And Luke, the companion of Paul, put
                    down in a book the goſpel preached by him (Paul). Afterwards John, the diſciple
                    of the Lord, who alſo leaned upon his breaſt, likewiſe publiſhed a goſpel while
                    he dwelt at Epheſus in Alia.” Irenæus then relates how Matthew begins his
                    goſpel, how Mark begins and ends his, and gives the ſuppoſed reaſons for doing
                    ſo. He enumerates at length all the paſſages of Chriſt’s hiſtory in Luke, which
                    are not found in any of the other evangeliſts. He ſtates the particular deſign
                    with which St John compoſed his goſpel, and accounts for the doctrinal
                    declarations which precede the narrative. If any modern divine ſhould write a
                    book upon the genuineneſs of the goſpels, he could not aſſert it more expreſsly,
                    or ſtate their original more diſtinctly, than Irenæus hath done within little
                    more than 100 years after they were publiſhed.</p>
                <p>Reſpecting the book of the Acts of the Apoſtles, and its author, the teſtimony of
                    Irenæus is no leſs explicit. Referring to the account of St Paul’s converſion
                    and vocation, in the ninth chapter of that book, “Nor can they (ſays he, meaning
                    the parties with whom he argues ſhow) that he is not to be credited, who has
                    related to us the truth with the greateſt exactneſs.” Tn another place, he has
                    actually collected the ſeveral texts, in which the writer of the hiſtory is
                    repreſented as accompanying St Paul, which led him to exhibit a ſummary of
                    almoſt the whole of the laſt twelve chapters of the book.</p>
                <p>According to Lardner, Irenæus quotes twelve of Paul’s epiſtles, naming their
                    author; alſo the firſt epiſtle of Peter, the two firſt epiſtles ol John, and the
                    Revelation. The epiſtles of Paul which he omits are thoſe addreſſed to Philemon
                    and the Hebrews. Euſebius ſays, that he quotes the epiſtle to the Hebrews,
                    though he does not aſcribe it to Paul. The work, however, is loſt.</p>
                <p>A. D. 172, Tatian, who is ſpoken of by Clemens Alexandrinus, Origen, Euſebius,
                    and Jerome, compoſed a harmony of the four goſpels, which he called <hi
                        rend="italic">Diateſſaron</hi> of the four. This title, as well as the work,
                    is remarkable, becauſe it ſhows that then as well as now there were four, and
                    only four, goſpels in general uſe among Chriſtians.</p>
                <p>A. D. 170, the churches of Lyons and Vienne in France ſent an account of the
                    ſufferings of their martyrs to the churches of Aſia and Phrygia, which has been
                    preſerved entire by Euſebius. And what carries in ſome meaſure the teſtimony of
                    theſe churches to a higher age is, that they had now for their biſhop Pothinus,
                    who was 90 years old, and whoſe early life conſequently muſt have immediately
                    followed the times of the apoſtles. In this epiſtle are exact references to the
                    goſpels of Luke and John, and to the Acts of the Apoſtles. The form of reference
                    is the fame as in all the preceding articles. That from St John is in theſe
                    words: “Then was fulfilled that which was ſpoken by the Lord, that whoſoever
                    killeth you, will think that he doth God ſervice<note anchored="true" n="90" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* John xvi. 2.</p></note> *.”</p>
                <p>Diſtinct references are alſo made to other books, viz. Acts, Romans, Epheſians,
                    Philippians, 1. Timothy, l Peter, 1 John, Revelation.</p>
                <p>A. D. 140, Juſtin Martyr compoſed ſeveral books, which are mentioned by his
                    diſciple Tatian, by Tertullian, Methodius, Euſebius, Jerome, Epiphanius, and
                    Photius. In his writings between 20 and 30 quotations from the goſpels and Acts
                    of the Apoſtles are reckoned up, which are clear, diſtinct, and copious; if each
                    verſe be counted ſeparately, a much greater number; if each expreſſion, ſtill
                    more. Jones, in his book on the Canon of the New Teſtament, ventures to affirm
                    that he cites the books of which it conſiſts, particularly the four goſpels,
                    above 200 times.</p>
                <p>We meet with quotations of three of the goſpels within the compaſs of half a
                    page; “and in other words, he ſays, Depart from me into outer darkneſs, which
                    the Father hath prepared for Satan and his Angels,” (which is from Matthew xxv.
                    41.) “And again he ſaid in other words, I give unto you power to tread upon
                    ſerpents and ſcorpions, and venomous beaſts, and upon all the power of the
                    enemy.” (This from Luke X. 19.) “And, before he was crucified, he ſaid,</p>
                <p>The ſon of man muſt ſuffer many things, and be rejected of the Scribes and
                    Phariſees, and be crucified, and riſe again the third day; (this from Mark viii.
                    31)</p>
                <p>All the references in Juſtin are made without mentioning the author; which proves
                    that theſe books were perfectly well known, and that there were no other
                    accounts of Chriſt then extant, or, at leaſt, no others ſo received and credited
                    as to make it neceſſary to add any marks of diſtinction. But although Juſtin
                    mentions not the authors names, he calls the books <hi rend="italic">Memoirs
                        compoſed by the Apostles; Memoirs compoſed by the Apοstles and their
                        Companions</hi>; which deſcriptions, the latter eſpecially, exactly ſuit the
                    titles which the Goſpels and Acts of the Apoſtles now bear.</p>
                <p>He informs us, in his firſt apology, that <hi rend="italic">the memoirs oſ the
                        Aρostles;</hi> or the writings of the prophets, are read according as the
                    time allows; and, when the reader has ended, the preſident makes a diſcourſe,
                    exhorting to the imitation of ſuch excellent things.</p>
                <p>A few ſhort obſervations will ſhow the value of this teſtimony. 1. The Memoirs of
                    the Apoſtles, Juſtin in another place expreſsly tells us are what are called <hi
                        rend="italic">goſpels.</hi> And that they were the goſpels which we now uſe
                    is made certain by Juſtin’s numerous quotations of them, and his ſilence about
                    any others. 2. He deſcribes the general uſage of the Chriſtian church. 3. He
                    does not ſpeak of it as recent or newly inllituted, but in the terms in which
                    men ſpeak of eſtabliſhed cuſtoms.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0145.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0139"/> Juſtin alſo makes ſuch alluſions to the
                    following books as ſhows that he had read them: Romans, 1 Corinthians,
                    Galatians, Epheſians, Philippians, Coloſſians, 2 Theſſalonians, Hebrews, 2
                    Peter; and he aſcribes the Revelation to John the Apoſtle of Chriſt.</p>
                <p>A. D. 116, Papias, a hearer of John, and companion of Polycarp, as Irenæus
                    attests, and of the apoſtolical age as all agree, in a paſſage quoted by
                    Euſebius, from a work now lost, expreſsly aſcribes the two firſt goſpels to
                    Matthew and Mark; and in a manner which proves that theſe gospels must have
                    publicly borne the names of theſe authors at that time, and probably long
                    before; for Papias does not ſay, that one goſpel was written by Matthew, and
                    another by Mark; but, affirming this as perfectly well known, he tells us from
                    what materials Mark collected his account, viz. from Peter’s preaching, and in
                    what language Matthew wrote, viz. in Hebrew. Whether Papias was well informed in
                    this ſtatement or not, to the point for which this teſtimony is produced,
                    namely, that theſe books bore theſe names at this time, his authority is
                    complete.</p>
                <p>Papias himſelf declares that he received his accounts of Chriſtianity from thoſe
                    who were acquainted with the apoſtles, and that those accounts which he thus
                    received from the older Chriſtians, and had committed to memory, he inſerted in
                    his books. He farther adds, that he was very ſolicitous to obtain every poſſible
                    information, eſpecially to learn what the apoſtles ſaid and preached, valuing
                    ſuch information more than what was written in books<note anchored="true" n="91" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Praesat. in Op. apud. Euseb. Hist.

                <p>A. D. 108, Polycarp was the biſhop of Smyrna, and diſciple of John the Apoſtle.
                    This teſtimony concerning Polycarp is given by Irenæus, who in his youth had
                    ſeen him. I can tell the place,” faith Irenæus, “in which the bleſſed Polycarp
                    ſat and taught, and his going out and coming in, and the manner of his life, and
                    the form of his perſon, and the diſcourſes he made to the people, and how he
                    related his conversation with John and others who had ſeen the Lord, and how he
                    related their ſayings, and what he had heard concerning the Lord, both
                    concerning his miracles and his doctrine, as he had received them from the
                    eye-witnesses of the word of life; all which Polycarp related agreeable to the
                    ſcriptures.”</p>
                <p>Of Polycarp, whoſe proximity to the age and country and perſons of the apoſtles
                    is thus atteſted, we have one undoubted epiſtle remaining; which, though a ſhort
                    performance, contains nearly 40 clear alluſions to the books of the New
                    Teſtament. This is ſtrong evidence of the reſpect which was paid to them by
                    Christians of that age. Amongſt theſe, although the writings of St Paul are more
                    frequently uſed by Polycarp than other parts of ſcripture, there are copious
                    alluſions to the goſpel of St Matthew, ſome to paſſages found in the goſpels
                    both of Matthew and Luke, and ſome which more nearly reſemble the words in
                    Luke.</p>
                <p>He thus fixes the authority of the Lord’s Prayer, and the uſe of it among
                    Chriſtians. If, therefore, we pray the Lord to <hi rend="italic">forgive us, we
                        ought alſo to forgive.</hi> And again, With ſupplication <hi rend="italic"
                        >befeeching</hi> the all-ſeeing God no <hi rend="italic">t to lead us into
                        temptation.</hi></p>
                <p>In another place, he quotes the words of our Lord: "But remembering what the Lord
                    ſaid, teaching, Judge not, that ye be not judged. Forgive, and ye shall be
                    forgiven; be ye merciful, that ye may obtain mercy; with what meaſure ye mete,
                    it ſhall be meaſured to you again<note anchored="true" n="92" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Matc. viii. 1. i. 2. v. 7.</p></note> *. Suppoſing
                    Polycarp to have had theſe words from the books in which we now find them, it is
                    manifeſt that theſe books were conſidered by him, and by his readers, as he
                    thought, as authentic accounts of Chriſt’s diſcourſes; and that this point was
                    inconteſtable.</p>
                <p>He quotes alſo the following books, the firſt of which he aſcribes to St Paul: 1
                    Corinthians, Epheſians, Philippians, 1 and 2 Theſſalonians; and makes evident
                    references to others, particularly to Acts, Romans, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, 1
                    Timothy, 2 Timothy, 1 Peter, 1 John.</p>
                <p>Ignatius, as it is teſtified by ancient Chriſtian writers, became biſhop of
                    Antioch about 37 years after Chriſt’s aſcenſion; and therefore, from his time,
                    and place, and station, it is probable that he had known and converſed with many
                    of the apoſtles. Epiſtles of Ignatius are referred to by Polycarp his
                    contemporary. Paſſages, found in the epiſtles now extant under his name, are
                    quoted by. Irenæus, A. D. 178, by Origen, A. D. 230; and the occaſion of writing
                    them is fully explained by Euſebius and Jerome. What are called the ſmaller
                    epiſtles of Ignatius are generally reckoned the ſame which were read by Irenæus,
                    Origen, and Eulebius.</p>
                <p>They are admitted as genuine by Voſſius, and have been proved to be ſo by biſhop
                    Pearson with a force of argument which ſeems to admit of no reply. In theſe
                    epiſtles are undoubted alluſions to Matt. iii. 15. xi. 16. to John i-ii. 8.; and
                    their venerable author, who often ſpeaks of St Paul in terms of the higheſt
                    reſpect, once quotes his epiſtle to the Epheſians by <hi rend="italic"
                        >name.</hi></p>
                <p>Near the concluſion of the epiſtle to the Romans, St Paul, amongſt others, ſends
                    the following ſalutation: “Salute Aſyncritus, Phlegon, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hermas,</hi> Patrobus, Hermes, and the brethren which are with them.” Of
                    Hermas, who appears in this catalogue of Roman Chriſtians as contemporary with
                    St Paul, there is a book ſtill remaining, the authenticity of which cannot be
                    diſputed. It is called the <hi rend="italic">Shepherd,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pastor oſ Hermas.</hi> Its antiquity is inconteſtable, from the quotations
                    of it in Irenæus, A. D. 178, Clement of Alexandria, A. D. 194, Tertullian, A. D.
                    200, Origen, A D. 230. The notes of time extant in the epiſtle itſelf agree with
                    its title, and with the teſtimonies concerning it, which intimate that it was
                    written during the lifetime of Clement. In this piece are tacit alluſions to St
                    Matthew’s, St Luke’s, and St John’s goſpels; that is to ſay, there are
                    applications of thoughts and expreſſions found in theſe goſpels, without citing
                    the place or writer from which they were taken. In this form appear in Hermas
                    the confeſſing and denying of Chriſt<note anchored="true" n="93" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>† Matt. 1. 32, 33. or Luke xii. 8, 9.</p></note> †;
                    the parable of the ſeed ſown<note anchored="true" n="94" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>‡ Matt. xiii. 3. or Luke viii. 5.</p></note> ‡; the
                    compariſon of Chriſt’s diſciples to little children; the ſaying, “he that

                            18.</p></note> §;” the singular expreſſion, “having received all power
                    from his Father,” is probably an alluſion to Matthew xxviii. 18. and Chriſt
                    being the “gate,” or only way of coming “to God,” is a plain alluſion to John
                    xiv. 6. X. 7, 9. There is alſo a probable alluſion to Acts V. 3 2.</p>
                <p>The Shepherd of Hermas has been conſidered as a fanciful performance. This,
                    however, is of no importance in the preſent caſe. We only adduce it as evidence
                    that the books to which it frequently alludes exiſted in the firſt century; and
                    for this purpoſe it is ſatis-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0146.tif"

                    quetioned. However abſurd opinions a man may entertain while he retains his
                    underſtanding, his teſtimony to a matter of fact will ſtill be received in any
                    court of juſtice.</p>
                <p>A. D. 96, we are in poſſeſſion of an epiſtle written by Clement biſhop of Rome,
                    whom ancient writers, without any doubt or ſcruple, assert to have been the
                    Clement whom St Paul mentions Philippians iv. 3. “with Clement alſo, and other
                    my fellow labourers, whole names are in the book of life.” This epiſtle is
                    spoken of by the ancients as an epiſtle acknowledged by all; and, as Irenæus
                    well repreſents its value, “written by Clement, who had ſeen the bleſſed
                    apoſtles and converſed with them, who had the preaching of the apoſtles ſtill
                    founding in his ears, and their traditions before his eyes.” It is addreſſed to
                    the church of Corinth; and what alone may ſeem a deciſive proof of its
                    authenticity, Dionyſius biſhop of Corinth, about the year 170, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i. e.</hi> about 80 or 90 years after the epiſtle was written, bears
                    witneſs, “that it had been uſually read in that church from ancient times.” This
                    epiſtle affords, amongſt others, the following valuable paſſages: “Eſpecially
                    remembering the words of the Lord Jeſus, which he ſpake, teaching gentleneſs and

                    ſhould offend one of my little ones<note anchored="true" n="97" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Chap. 1. 29.</p></note> (U).”</p>
                <p>He aſcribes the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians to Paul, and makes ſuch
                    alluſions to the following books as is ſufficient to ſhew that he had ſeen and
                    read them: Acts, Romans, 2 Corinthians, Galatians, Epheſians, Philippians,
                    Coloſſians, 1 Theſſalonians, 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, 1 Peter, 2 Peter.</p>
                <p>It may be ſaid, as Clement has not mentioned the books by name from which we
                    aſſert theſe alluſions or references are made, it is uncertain whether he refers
                    to any books, or whether he received theſe expreſſions from the diſcourſes and
                    converſation of the apoſtles. Mr Paley has given a very ſatisfactory anſwer to
                    this objection: 1ſt, That Clement, in the very ſame manner, namely, without any
                    mark of reference, uſes a paffage now found in the epiſtle to the Romans<note
                        anchored="true" n="98" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(U) Matt. xviii.
                            6. “ But whoſo ſhall offend one of theſe little ones which believe in
                            me, it were better for him that a millſtone were hanged about his neck,
                            and that he were caſt into the ſea.” The latter part of the paſſage in
                            Clement agrees more exactly with Luke xvii. 2. "It were better for him
                            that a millſtone were hanged about his neck, and he caſt into the ſea,
                            than that he ſhould offend one of theſe little ones.”</p></note> *;
                    which paſſage, from the peculiarity of the words that compoſe it, and from their
                    order, it is manifeſt that he muſt have taken</p>
                <p>from the epiſtle. The ſame remark may be applied to ſome very Angular ſentiments
                    in the epiſtle to the Hebrews. Secondly, That there are many ſentences of St
                    Paul’s firſt epiſtle to the Corinthians to be found in Clement’s epiſtle,
                    without any ſign of quotation, which yet certainly arc quotations; becauſe it
                    appears that Clement had St Paul’s epiſtle before him; for in one place he
                    mentions it in terms too expreſs to leave us in any doubt. “Take into your hands
                    the epiſtle of the bleſſed apoſtle Paul.” Thirdly, That this method of adopting
                    words of ſcripture, without reference or acknowledgment, was a method in general
                    uſe amongſt the moſt ancient Chriſtian writers. Theſe analogies not only repel
                    the objection, but caſt the preſumption on the other ſide; and afford a
                    conſiderable degree of poſitive proof, that the words in queſtion have been
                    borrowed from the places oſ ſcripture in which we now find them. But take it, if
                    you will, the other way, that Clement had heard theſe words from the apoſtles or
                    firſt teachers of Chriſtianity; with reſpect to the preciſe point of our
                    argument, viz. that the ſcriptures contain what the apoſtles taught, this
                    ſuppoſition may ſerve almoſt as well.</p>
                <p>We have now traced the evidence to the times of the apoſtles; but we have not
                    been anxious to draw it out to a great length, by introducing every thing. On
                    the contrary, we have been careful to render it as concile as poſſible, that its
                    force might be diſcerned at a glance. The evidence which has been ſtated is of
                    two kinds. Till the time of Juſtin Martyr and Irenæus it conſiſts chiefly of
                    alluſions, references, and expreſſions, borrowed from the books of the New
                    Teſtament, without mentioning them by name. After the time of Irenæus it became
                    uſual to cite the ſacred books, and mention the authors from whom the citations
                    were taken.</p>
                <p>The firſt ſpecies of evidence will perhaps appear to ſome exceptionable; but it
                    muſt be remembered that it was uſual among the ancient Chriſtians as well as
                    Jews to adopt the expreſſions of Scripture without naming the authors. Why they
                    did ſo it is not neceſſary to inquire. The only point of importance to be
                    determined is, whether thole references are a ſufficient proof of the exiſtence
                    of the books to which they allude? This, we preſume, will not be denied;
                    eſpecially in the preſent age, when it is ſo common to charge an author with
                    plagiariſm if he happen to fall upon the ſame train of ideas, or expreſs himſelf
                    in a ſimilar manner with authors who have written before him. We may farther
                    affirm, that theſe tacit references afford a complete proof that thoſe ancient
                    writers had no intention of impoſing a forgery upon the world. They prove the
                    exiſtence of the Chriſtian religion and of the apoſtolical writings, without
                    ſhowing any ſuſpicious earneſtneſs that men ſhould believe them. Had theſe books
                    been forged, thoſe who wiſhed to paſs them upon the world would have been at
                    more pains than the firſt Chriſtians were to prove their authenticity. They
                    acted the part of<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0147.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0141"/> honeſt men; they believed them themſelves, and
                    they never imagined that others would ſuſpect their truth.</p>
                <p>It is a conſideration of great importance, in reviewing the evidence which has
                    been now ſtated, that the witneſſes lived in different countries; Clemens
                    flouriſhed at Rome, Polycarp at Smyrna, Juſtin Martyr in Syria, Irenæus in
                    France, Tertullian at Carthage, Origen at Alexandria, and Euſebius at Cæſarea.
                    This proves that the books of the New Teſtament were equally well known in
                    diſtant countries by men who had no intercourſe with one another.</p>
                <p>The ſame thing is proved by teſtimonies if poſſible leſs exceptionable. The
                    ancient heretics, whoſe opinions were ſometimes groſſer and more impious than
                    thoſe which any modern ſectary has ventured to broach, and whoſe zeal in the
                    propagation of them equalled that of the moſt flaming enthuſiaſt of the laſt
                    century, never called in queſtion the authenticity of the books of the New
                    Teſtament. When they met with any paſſage in the goſpels or epiſtles which they
                    could not reconcile to their own heretical notions, they either eraſed it, or
                    denied that the author was inſpired; but they nowhere contend that the book in
                    which it flood was not, written by the apoſtle or evangeliſt whoſe name it bore.
                    Euſebius relates, that the Ebionites rejected all the epiſtles of Paul, and
                    called him an apoſtate, becauſe he departed from the Levitical law; and they
                    adopted as their rule of faith the goſpel of St Matthew, though indeed they
                    greatly corrupted it. This proves therefore that the goſpel according to Matthew
                    was then publiſhed, and that St Paul’s epiſtles were then known.</p>
                <p>Of the heretics who eraſed or altered paſſages to make the Scriptures agree with
                    their doctrines, we may produce Marcion as an inſtance, who lived in the
                    beginning of the 2d century. He lived in an age when he could have eaſily
                    diſcovered if the writings oſ the New Teſtament had been forged; and as he was
                    much incenſed againſt the orthodox party, if ſuch a forgery had been committed,
                    unqueſtionably he would not have failed to make the diſcovery, as it would have
                    afforded the moſt ample means of revenge and triumph, and enabled him to
                    eſtabliſh his own opinions with leſs difficulty. But his whole conduct ſhows
                    clearly, that he believed the writings of the New Teſtament to be authentic. He
                    ſaid that the goſpel according to St Matthew, the epiſtle to the Hebrews, with
                    thoſe of St Peter and St James, as well as the Old Teſtament in general, were
                    writings not for Chriſtians but for Jews. He publiſhed a new edition of the
                    goſpel according to Luke, and the firſt ten epiſtles of Paul; in which it has
                    been affirmed by Epiphanius, that he altered every paſſage that contradicted his
                    own opinions: but as many oſ theſe alterations are what modern critics call <hi
                        rend="italic">various readings,</hi> though we receive the teſtimony of
                    Epiphanius, we muſt not rely upon his opinion<note anchored="true" n="99"

                    Teſtament above-mentioned did then exiſt, and were acknowledged to be the works

                    companions.”</p>
                <p>Celſus and Porphyry, both enemies of the Chriſtian religion, are powerful
                    witneſſes for the antiquity of the New Teſtament. Celſus, who lived towards the
                    end of the ſecond century, not only mentions by name, but quotes paſſages from
                    the books of the New Teſtament: and that the books to which he refers were no
                    other than our preſent goſpels, is evident from the alluſions to various
                    paſſages ſtill found in them. Celſus takes notice of the genealogies, which
                    fixes two of theſe goſpels; of the precepts, Reſiſt not him that injures you,
                    and, If a man ſtrike thee on the one cheek, offer to him the other alſo; of the
                    woes denounced by Chriſt; of his predictions; of his ſaying that it is
                    impoſſible to ſerve two maſters; of the purple robe, the crown of thorns, and
                    the reed wſhich was put into the hand of Jeſus; of the blood that flowed from
                    his body upon the croſs, a circumſtance wſhich is recorded only by John; and
                    (what is instar <hi rend="italic">omnium</hi> for the purpoſe for which we
                    produce it) of the difference in the accounts given of the reſurrection by the
                    evangeliſts, ſome mentioning two angels at the ſepulchre, others only one.</p>
                <p>It is extremely material to remark, that Celſus not only perpetually referred to
                    the accounts of Chriſt contained in the four goſpels, but that he referred to no
                    other accounts; that he sounded none of his objections to Chriſtianity upon any
                    thing delivered in ſpurious goſpels.</p>
                <p>The teſtimony of Porphyry is ſtill more important than that of Celſus. He was
                    born in the year 213, of Tyrian origin. Unfortunately for the preſent age, ſays
                    Michaelis, the miſtaken zeal of the Chriſtian emperors has baniſhed his writings
                    from the world; and every real friend of our religion would gladly give the
                    works of one of the pious fathers to reſcue thoſe of Porphyry from the flames.
                    But Mr Marſh, the learned and judicious tranſlator of Michaelis, relates, that,
                    according to the accounts of Iſaac Voſſius, a manuscript of the works of
                    Porphyry is preſerved in the Medicean library at Florence, but kept ſo ſecret
                    that no one is permitted to fee it. It is universally allowed, that Porphyry is
                    the moſt ſenſible, as well as the moſt ſevere, adverſary of the Chriſtian
                    religion that antiquity can produce. He was verſed not only in hiſtory, but alſo
                    in philoſophy and politics. His acquaintance with the Chriſtians was not
                    confined to a ſingle country; for he had converſed with them in Tyre, in Sicily,
                    and in Rome. Enabled by his birth to ſtudy the Syriac as well as the Greek
                    authors, he was of all the adverſaries to the Chriſtian religion the beſt
                    qualified to inquire into the authenticity of the ſacred writings. He poſſeſſed
                    therefore every advantage which natural abilities or a ſcientific education
                    could afford to diſcover wſhether the New Teſtament was a genuine work of the
                    apoſtles and evangeliſts, or whether it was impoſed upon the world after the
                    deceaſe of its pretended authors. But no trace of this ſuſpicion is anywhere to
                    be found in his writings. In the fragments wſhich ſtill remain,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0148.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0142"/> mention is
                    made of the goſpels of St Matthew, St Mark, and St John, the Acts of the
                    Apoſtles, and the epiſtle to the Galatians; and it clearly appears from the very
                    objections of Porphyry, that the books to which he alludes were the ſame which
                    we poſſeſs at preſent. Thus he objects to the repetition of a generation in St
                    Matthew’s genealogy; to Matthew’s call; to the quotation of a text from lſaiah,
                    which is found in a pſalm aſcribed to Aſaph; to thc calling of the lake of
                    Tiberias a ſea; to the expreſſion in St Matthew, "the abomination of
                    deſolation;” to the variation in Matthew and Mark upon the text “the voice of
                    one crying in the wilderneſs,” Matthew citing it from Iſaias, Mark from the
                    prophets; to John’s application of the term <hi rend="italic">Word;</hi> to
                    Chriſt’s change of intention about going up to the feaſt of tabernacles (John
                    vii. 8.); to the judgement denounced by St Peter upon Ananias and Sapphira,
                    which he calls an imprecation of death.</p>
                <p>The inſtances here alleged ſerve in ſome meaſure to ſhow the nature of Porphyry’s
                    objections, and prove that Porphyry had read the goſpels with that ſort of
                    attention which a writer would employ who regarded them as the depoſitaries of
                    the religion which he attacked. Beſide theſe ſpecifications, there exiſts in the
                    writings of ancient Chriſtians general evidence, that the places of Scripture,
                    upon which Porphyry had made remarks, were very numerous.</p>
                <p>The internal evidence to prove the authenticity of the New Teſtament conſiſts of
                    two parts: The nature of the ſtyle, and the coincidence of the New Teſtament
                    with the hiſtory of the times.</p>
                <p>The ſtyle of the New Teſtament is ſingular, and differs very widely from the
                    ſtyle of claſſical authors. It is full of Hebraiſms and Syriaſms; a circumſtance
                    which pious ignorance has conſidered as a fault, and which, even ſo late as the
                    preſent century, it has attempted to remove; not knowing that theſe very
                    deviations from Grecian purity afford the ſtrongeſt preſumption in its favour;
                    for they prove, <hi rend="italic">that the New Testment was written by men of
                        Hebrew origin, and is therefore a production of the first century.</hi>
                    After the death of the firſt Jewiſh converts, few of the Jews turned preachers
                    of the goſpel; the Chriſtians were generally ignorant of Hebrew, and
                    conſequently could not write in the ſtyle of the New Teſtament. After the
                    deſtruction of Jeruſalem and the diſperſion of the Jews, their language muſt
                    have been blended with that of other nations, and their vernacular phraſeology
                    almoſt entirely loſt. The language of the early fathers, though not always the
                    pureſt claſſic Greek, has no reſemblance to that of the New Teſtament, not even
                    excepting the works of the few who had a knowledge of the Hebrew; as Origen,
                    Epiphanius, and Juſtin Martyr, who being a native of Paleſtine, might have
                    written in a ſtyle ſimilar to that of the New Teſtament, had ſuch a ſtyle then
                    prevailed. He that ſuſpects the New Teſtament to be the forgery of a more recent
                    period, ought to produce ſome perſon who has employed a ſimilar diction; but
                    thoſe who are converſant with eaſtern writings know well that a foreigner, who
                    has not been enured to eaſt</p>
                <p>ern manners and modes of thinking from his infancy, can never imitate with
                    ſucceſs the oriental ſtyle, much leſs forge a hiſtory or an epiſtle which
                    contains a thouſand incidental alluſions, which nothing but truth could ſuggeſt.
                    To imitate cloſely the ſtyle of the New Teſtament is even more difficult than to
                    imitate that of any other oriental book; for there is not a ſingle author, even
                    among the Jews themſelves, ſince the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, that has compoſed
                    in a ſtyle in the leaſt degree like it<note anchored="true" n="101"

                            perhaps be an exception. By many eminent critics it has been thought to
                            like to that oſ the epiſtle to the Hebrews, as to give room for the
                            opinion that Clement either was the author of that epiſtle, or was the
                            perſon who tranſlated it from the Syro-Chaldaic language, in which it
                            was originally compoſed.</p></note> (z).</p>
                <p>But though the books of the New Teſtament bear ſo cloſe a reſemblance in idiom,
                    there is a diverſity of ſtyle which ſhows them to be the work of different
                    perſons. Whoever reads with attention the epiſtles of Paul, muſt be convinced
                    that they were all written by the ſame author. An equal degree of ſimilarity is
                    to be found between the goſpel and 1ſt epiſtle of John. The writings of St John
                    and St Paul exhibit marks of an original genius which no imitation can ever
                    attain. The character of Paul as a writer is drawn with great judgement by
                    Michaelis: “His mind overflows with ſentiment, yet he never loſes fight of his
                    principal object, but hurried on by the rapidity of thought, diſcloſes
                    frequently in the middle a concluſion to be made only at the end. To a profound
                    knowledge of the Old Teſtament he joins the acuteneſs oſ philoſophical wiſdom,
                    which he diſplays in applying and expounding the ſacred writings; and his
                    explanations are therefore ſometimes ſo new and unexpected, that ſuperficial
                    obſervers might be tempted to ſuppoſe them erroneous. The fire of his genius,
                    and his inattention to ſtyle, occaſion frequently a twofold obſcurity, he being
                    often too conciſe to be underſtood except by thoſe to whom he immediately wrote,
                    and not ſeldom on the other hand ſo full of his ſubject, as to produce long and
                    difficult parentheſes, and a repetition of the ſame word even in different
                    lenſes. With a talent for irony and ſatire, he unites the moſt refined
                    ſenſibility, and tempers the ſeverity of his cenſures by expreſſions of
                    tenderneſs and affection; nor does he ever forget in the vehemence of his zeal
                    the rules of modeſty and decorum. He is a writer, in ſhort, of ſo ſingular and
                    wonderful a compoſition, that it would be difficult to find a rival. That truly
                    ſenſible and ſagacious philoſopher Locke was of the ſame opinion, and contended
                    that St Paul was without an equal.”</p>
                <p>Poems have been forged and aſcribed to former ages with ſome ſucceſs.
                    Philoſophical treatiſes might be invented which it would be difficult to detect;
                    but there is not a ſingle inſtance on record where an attempt has been made to
                    forge a hiſtory or a long epiſtle, where the fraud has not been either fully
                    proved, or rendered ſo ſuſpicious that few are weak enough to believe it.
                    Whoever attempts to forge a hiſtory or an epiſtle in the name of an ancient
                    author, will be in great danger of contradicting the hiſtory or the manners of
                    that age, eſpecially if he relate events which are not mentioned in general
                    hiſtory, but ſuch as refer to a ſingle city, ſect, religion, or ſchool.</p>
                <p>The difficulty of forging ſuch hiſtories as the goſpels,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0149.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0143"/> and ſuch
                    epiſtles as thoſe of Paul, cannot be overcome by all the genius, learning, and
                    induſtry, of any individual or ſociety of men that ever lived. They contain a
                    purer ſyſtem of ethics than all the ancient philoſophers could invent: They
                    diſcover a candour and modeſty unexampled: They exhibit an originality in the
                    character of Jeſus, and yet ſuch a conſiſtency as the imagination of our beſt
                    poets has never reached. Now it is a very remarkable circumſtance, that
                    hiſtories written by four different men ſhould preſerve ſuch dignity and
                    conſiſtency, though frequently relating different actions of Jeſus, and
                    deſcending to the moſt minute circumſtances in his life. The ſcene of action is
                    too extenſive, and the agreement of facts with the ſtate of the times as
                    repreſented by other hiſtorians is too cloſe, to admit the poſſibility of
                    forgery.</p>
                <p>The ſcene of action is not confined to one country, it is ſucceſſively laid in
                    the greateſt cities of the Roman empire; in Rome, in Antioch, in Corinth, in
                    Athens, as well as in Jeruſalem and the land of Paleſtine. Innumerable alluſions
                    are made to the manners and opinions of the Greeks, the Romans, and the Jews;
                    and reſpecting the Jews, they extend even to the trifles and follies of their
                    ſchools. Yet after the ſtricteſt examination, the New Teſtament will be found to
                    have a wonderful coincidence and harmony with Joſephus, the principal hiſtorian
                    of theſe times, and an enemy of Chriſtianity.</p>

                    was engaged in a war with his father-in-law Aretas, a petty king in Arabia
                    Petræa, at the very time that John was preaching in the wilderness; and the road
                    from Galilee to Arabia running through that w!ldernefs, the ſoldiers on their
                    march had this interview with the Baptiſt. A coincidence like this, which has

                    council in Jeruſalem<note anchored="true" n="104" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Acts xxiii. 2-5.</p></note> *. Krebs, in his
                    remarks taken from Joſephus, has ſhown him to have been the ſon of Nebedeni. But
                    if ſo, how can it be reconciled with chronology, that Ananias was, at that time,
                    called high prieſt, when it is certain from Joſephus that the time of his
                    holding that office was much earlier? And how comes it to paſs that St Paul
                    ſays, "I wiſt not, brethren, that he was the high prieſt?” The ſacerdotal garb
                    muſt have diſcovered who he was: a jeſt would have ill-ſuited the gravity of a
                    tribunal; and a falſehood is inconſiſtent with the character of St Paul.</p>
                <p>All theſe difficulties vaniſh as ſoon as we examine the ſpecial hiſtory of that
                    period: “Ananias the ſon of Nebedeni was high prieſt at the time that Helena
                    queen of Adiabene ſupplied the Jews with corn from Egypt, during the famine
                    which took place in the fourth year of Claudius, mentioned in the eleventh
                    chapter of the Acts. St Paul therefore, who took a journey to Jeruſalem at that
                    period, could not have been ignorant of</p>
                <p>the elevation of Ananias to that dignity. Soon aſter the holding of the firſt
                    council, as it is called, at Jeruſalem, Ananias was diſpoſſeſſed of his office,
                    in conſequence of certain acts of violence between the Samaritans and the Jews,
                    and ſent priſoner to Rome; but being afterwards releaſed, he returned to
                    Jeruſalem. Now from that period he could not be called <hi rend="italic"
                        >high-ρriest</hi> in the proper ſenſe of the word, though Joſephus has
                    ſometimes given him the title of αζχιεϧευς, taken in the more extenſive meaning
                    of a prieſt, who had a ſeat and voice in the Sanhedrim; and Jonathan, though we
                    are not acquainted with the circumſtances of his elevation, had been raiſed in
                    the mean time to the ſupreme dignity in the Jewiſh church. Between the death of
                    Jonathan, who was murdered by order of Felix, and the high- prieſthood of
                    Iſmael, who was inveſted with that dignity by Agrippa, elapſed an interval
                    during which the ſacerdotal office was vacant. Now it happened preciſely in this
                    interval that St Paul was apprehended in Jeruſalem: and, the Sanhedrim, being
                    deſtitute of a preſident, he undertook of his own authority the diſcharge of
                    that office, which he executed with the greateſt tyranny. It is poſſible
                    therefore that St Paul, who had been only a few days in Jeruſalem, might be
                    ignorant that Ananias, who had been diſpoſſeſſed of the prieſthood, had taken
                    upon himſelf a truſt to which he was not intitled; he might therefore very
                    naturally exclaim, ‘I wiſt not, brethren, that he was the high-prieſt!’
                    Admitting him on the other hand to have been acquainted with the fact, the
                    expreſſion muſt be conſidered as an indirect reproof, and a tacit refuſal to
                    recognize uſurped authority.”</p>
                <p>Could ſuch a correſpondence as this ſubſiſt between truth and falſehood, between
                    a forgery and an authentic hiſtory? or is it credible that theſe events could be
                    related by any perſon but a contemporary?</p>
                <p>Impreſſed with the love of truth, and feeling contempt as well as deteſtation at
                    pious frauds, we heſitate not to acknowledge, that in ſome particular facts
                    there is a difference either real or apparent between Joſephus and the writers
                    of the New Teſtament. The objections ariſing from theſe differences are of two
                    kinds: 1. Such as would prove a book not to have been written by the author to
                    whom it is aſcribed. 2. Such as would prove that the author was miſtaken, and
                    therefore not divinely inſpired. To the firſt claſs belongs the following
                    objection: St Paul fays (2 Cor. xi. 32.) that the governor of Damaſcus was under
                    Aretas the king: but if we are to judge from the 18th book of the Jewiſh
                    Antiquities, which correſponds with the period of St Paul’s journey to Damaſcus,
                    this city muſt have belonged at that time to the Romans; and what authority
                    could Aretas, a petty king in Arabia Petræa, have in ſuch a city? In anſwer to
                    this queſtion, J. G. Hyne, in a diſſertation publiſhed in 1755, has ſhown it to
                    be highly probable that Aretas, againſt whom the Romans, not long before the
                    death of Tiberius, made a declaration of war, which they neglected to put in
                    exedition, took the opportunity of ſeizing Damaſcus, which had once belonged to
                    his anceſtors; an event omitted by Joſephus, as forming no part of the Jewiſh
                    hiſtory, and by the Roman hiſtorians as being a matter not flattering in itſelf,
                    and belonging only to a dictant province. Secondly, That Aretas was by religion
                    a Jew; a circumſtance the more credible, when we reflect that<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0150.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0144"/> Judaism had
                    been widely propagated in that country, and that even kings in Arabia Felix had
                    recognized the law of Moſes. The difficulty then is ſo far removed, that it
                    ceaſes to create ſuſpicion againſt an epistle which has ſo many evident marks of
                    authenticity; and it is only to be regretted that, in order to place the ſubject
                    in the cleareſt point of view, we are not ſufficiently acquainted with the
                    particular hiſtory of Damaſcus.</p>
                <p>Examples of the second kind are ſuch as, if allowed their full force, might
                    indeed prove a writer not divinely inſpired, but could afford no reaſon to
                    conclude that he was not the author of the writings which bear his name, ſince
                    miſtakes may be committed by the moſt accurate hiſtorian. The chief difficulties
                    of this nature are found in the gospel according to St Luke, and do not apply to
                    the writings of Matthew, John, Paul, and Peter. Laying aside the idea of
                    inſpiration altogether, let us inquire whether Luke or Josephus be moſt intitled
                    to credit in thoſe paſſages where they differ; which of them is moſt accurate,
                    and which of them had the beſt opportunities of exploring the truth of the facts
                    which they relate. Now Joſephus relates the ſame ſtory differently in different
                    parts of his works, and is ſometimes equally miſtaken in them all. We do not
                    recollect to have ſeen ſuch inconſiſtencies in the writings of St Luke. Luke
                    knew the characters, and witneſſed many of the facts, of which he ſpeaks; and he
                    could receive the beſt information reſpecting thoſe facts which were tranſacted
                    in his abſence. Joſephus was bom A. D. 37, ſome years after our Saviour’s
                    aſcenfion. Now it is a very important obſervation of Michaelis, that the period
                    of hiſtory with which mankind are leaſt acquainted is that which includes the
                    time of their childhood and youth, together with the twenty or thirty years
                    immediately preceding their birth. Concerning the affairs tranſacted during that
                    period, we are much more liable to fall into miſtakes than concerning thoſe of a
                    remoter age. The reaſon is, that authentic hiſtory never comes down to the
                    period of our birth; our knowledge of the period immediately preceding depends
                    on hearſay; and the events, which paſs within the firſt eighteen or twenty years
                    of our lives, we are too young and heedleſs to obſerve with attention. This muſt
                    have been more remarkably the caſe in the time of Joſephus than at preſent, when
                    there were neither daily papers nor periodical journals to ſupply the want of
                    regular annals. There was no hiſtorian from whom Joſephus could derive any
                    knowledge of the times that immediately preceded his birth. There is a period
                    then of forty or fifty years, in which, even with the moſt diligent inquiry, he
                    was expoſed to error.</p>
                <p>When we find therefore the relations of Luke and Joſephus ſo different as not to
                    be reconciled, it would be very unfair to determine without any further inquiry
                    in favour of Joſephus. Let their character, and works, and ſituation, be
                    ſtrictly examined; let their teſtimony be duly weighed and compared; and then
                    let the preference be given to that author who, according to the ſtricteſt rules
                    of equity and juſtice, ſeems intitled to the higheſt degree of credit. The
                    deciſion of a jury, we ſhall venture to ſay, would in every inſtance turn out in
                    favour of Luke.</p>
                <p>Having thus aſcertained the authenticity of the books of the New Teſtament, the
                    next thing to be conſidered is their inſpiration. It is certainly of ſome
                    importance to know how far the apoſtles and evangeliſts were guided in their
                    writings by the immediate influence of the ſpirit of God; though this knowledge,
                    if attainable, is not equally important with that of the authenticity of theſe
                    writings. Michaelis indeed aſſerts, that the divinity of the New Teſtament may
                    be proved whether we can evince it to be written by immediate inſpiration or
                        not<note anchored="true" n="105" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>†
                            Chap iii. § 1.</p></note> †. “The queſtion (ſays he), whether the books
                    of the New Teſtament are inſpired? is not ſo important as the queſtion, whether
                    they are genuine? The truth of our religion depends upon the latter, not
                    abſolutely on the former. Had the Deity inſpired not a ſingle book of the New
                    Teſtament, hut left the apoſtles and evangeliſts without any other aid than that
                    of natural abilities to commit what they knew to writing, admitting their works
                    to be authentic, and poſſeſſed of a ſufficient degree of credibility, the
                    Chriſtian religion would ſtill be well founded. The miracles by which it is
                    confirmed would equally demonſtrate its truth, even if the perſons who atteſted
                    them were not inſpired, but simply human witnesses; and their divine authority
                    is never preſuppoſed, when we diſcuſs the queſtion of miracles, but merely their
                    credibility as human evidence. If the miracles are true which the evangeliſts
                    relate, the doctrines of Chriſt recorded in the goſpels are proved to be the
                    infallible oracles of God; and, even if we admit the apoſtles to be miſtaken in
                    certain not eſſential circumſtances, yet as the main points of the religion
                    which Chriſt commiſſioned them to preach are ſo frequently repeated, their
                    epiſtles would inſtruct us as well in the tenets of the Chriſtian ſyſtem, as the
                    works of Maclaurin in the philoſophy of Newton. It is poſſible therefore to
                    doubt, and even deny, the inſpiration of the New Teſtament, and yet be fully
                    perſuaded of the truth of the Chriſtian religion: and many really entertain
                    theſe ſentiments either publicly or in private, to whom we ſhould render great
                    injuſtice, if we ranked them in the claſs of unbelievers.</p>
                <p>“Yet the Chriſtian religion would be attended with difficulty, if our <hi
                        rend="italic">principium cognoſcendi</hi> reſted not on firmer ground; and
                    it might be objected, that ſufficient care had not been taken for thoſe whoſe
                    confidences were tender, and wſho were anxiouſly fearful of miſtaking the
                    ſmalleſt of the divine commands. The chief articles indeed of Chriſtianity are
                    ſo frequently repeated, both by Chriſt and his apoſtles, that even were the New
                    Teſtament not inſpired, we could entertain no doubt of the following doctrines:
                    ‘Jeſus was the Meſſias of the Jews, and an infallible meſſenger of God: he died
                    for our iniquity; and by the ſatisfaction made by his death we obtain remiſſion
                    of ſins, if on our part be faith and amendment of life: the Levitical law is
                    aboliſhed, and moral precepts, with the ceremonies of Baptiſm and the Supper of
                    the Lord, are appointed in its ſtead: after the preſent follows an everlaſting
                    life, in which the virtuous ſhall be rewarded and the wicked puniſhed, and where
                    Chriſt himſelf ſhall be the Judge.’</p>
                <p>“To the epiſtles indeed (ſays Michaelis), inſpiration is of real conſequence; but
                    with reſpect to the hiſtorical books, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> the Goſpels
                    and the Acts of the Apoſtles, we ſhould really be no loſers if we abandoned the
                    ſyſtem of inſpiration, and in ſome reſpects have a real advantage. We ſhould be
                    no loſers, if we conſidered the apoſtles in hiſtorical facts as merely human

                    as Chriſt himſelf has done in ſaying, 'Ye alſo ſhall bear witneſs, becauſe ye
                    have been with me from the beginning<note anchored="true" n="106" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* John xv.</p></note> *. And no one that attempts to
                    convince an unbeliever of the truth of Chriſtianity, would begin his
                    dernonſtration by preſuppoſing a doctrine which his adverſary denies, but would
                    ground his arguments on the credibility of the evangeliſts as human hiſtorians,
                    for the truth of the miracles, the death, and the reſurrection of Chriſt. Even
                    thoſe who examine the grounds of their faith for their own private conviction,
                    muſt treat the evangeliſts as human evidence; ſince it would be arguing in a
                    circle to conclude that the facts recorded in the goſpels are true, becauſe they
                    are inſpired, when we conclude the Scriptures to be inſpired in conſequence of
                    their contents. In theſe caſes, then, we are obliged to conſider the evangeliſts
                    as human evidence; and it would be no detriment to the Chriſtian cauſe to
                    conſider them at all times as ſuch in matters of hiſtorical fact. We find it
                    nowhere expreſsly recorded that the public tranſactions which the apoſtles knew
                    by their own experience, and of which St Luke informed himſelf by diligent
                    inquiry, ſhould be particular objects of divine inſpiration. We ſhould even be
                    conſiderable gainers, in adjuſting the harmony of the goſpels, if we were
                    permitted to ſuppoſe that ſome one of the evangeliſts had committed an
                    immaterial error, and that St John has rectified ſome trifling miſtakes in the
                    preceding goſpels. The moſt dangerous objections which can be made to the truth
                    of our religion, and ſuch as are moſt difficult to anſwer, are thoſe drawn from
                    the different relations of the four evangeliſts.”</p>
                <p>Before any inquiry is made reſpecting the inſpiration of the books of the New
                    Teſtament, it is neceſſary to determine the meaning of the term; for theologians
                    have given to it a variety of ſignifications. Moſt of the German divines make it
                    to consiſt in an infusion of words as well as ideas. Luther, Beza, and
                    Salmaſius, reſtrict it to ideas alone. Doddridge underſtands by it an
                    intervention of the Deity, by which the natural faculties of the mind were
                    directed to the diſcovery of truth. Warburton and Law think it was a negative
                    intervention to preſerve the ſacred writers from eſſential errors. Some believe
                    every circumſtance was dictated by the Holy Ghoſt; others ſuppoſe that no
                    ſupernatural aſſiſtance was granted except in the epiſtolary writings. See <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Inspiration.</hi></p>
                <p>As there is an evident diſtinction between inſpiration and revelation, and as the
                    origin of the Chriſtian religion may be ſtill proved divine, even though it were
                    denied that thoſe who record its facts and doctrines were inſpired in the act of
                    writing, it will be moſt judicious and ſafe to employ the word <hi rend="italic"
                        >inſpiration</hi> in that ſenſe which can be moſt eaſily defended and
                    ſupported. By doing this much may be gained and nothing loſt. It is difficult to
                    prove to a deiſt that the words of Scripture are divine, becauſe he ſees that
                    every writer has words and phraſes peculiar to himſelf. It is difficult alſo to
                    prove that the ideas were infuſed into the mind of the authors while they were
                    engaged in the act of writing; becauſe concerning facts they appeal not to
                    divine inſpiration, but declare <hi rend="italic">what they have ſeen and
                        heard.</hi> In reaſoning they add their own ſentiments to what they had
                    received from the Lord, and ſubjoin, eſpecially in their epiſtles, things not
                    connected with religion. The definition which Doddridge gives, ſeems</p>
                <p>applicable to ordinary gifts or the uſual endowments of rational creatures,
                    rather than to the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit, which were beſtowed
                    on the apoſtles. Thoſe who maintain that every fact or circumſtance was
                    ſuggeſted by divine inſpiration, will find it no eaſy matter to prove their
                    poſition. The opinion of Warburton and Law, with proper explanations, ſeems moſt
                    probable. The opinion of Grotius, that only the epiſtles were inſpired, may be
                    eaſily refuted.</p>
                <p>The proof of the authenticity of the New Teſtament depends on human teſtimony:
                    The proof of its inſpiration is derived from the declaration of inſpired
                    perſons.</p>
                <p>In proving that the New Teſtament is inſpired, we preſuppoſe its authenticity
                    that the ſacred books were written by the apoſtles whoſe names they bear, and
                    that they have been conveyed to us pure and uncorrupted. This we have already
                    attempted to prove, and we hope with ſucceſs. The evidence of inſpiration is the
                    teſtimony of Chriſt and his apoſtles, which we receive as credible, becauſe they
                    confirmed their doctrines by miracles. From the important miſſion of Chriſt and
                    his apoſtles, we infer that every power was beſtowed which divine wiſdom thought
                    expedient; and from their conduct we conclude, that it is morally impoſſible
                    that they could lay claim to any powers which they did not poſſeſs. It is proper
                    therefore to inquire into the declarations of Chriſt and his apoſtles concerning
                    the nature, degree, and extent, of the inſpiration beſtowed upon the writers of
                    the ſacred books.</p>
                <p>If we conſider Chriſt’s more immediate promiſes of inſpiration to the apoſtles,
                    we ſhall find that he has given them, in the moſt proper ſenſe of the word, at
                    three ſeveral periods, 1ſt, When he ſent the apoſtles to preach the goſpel<note anchored="true" n="107" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>† Matt. I. 19,
                            20.</p></note> †; 2dly, In holding a public diſcourſe relating to the
                    goſpel, at which were preſent a conſiderable multitude; 3dly, In his prophecy of
                    the deſtruction of Jeruſalem<note anchored="true" n="108" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>‡ Mark xiii. II; Luke xxi. 14, 15.</p></note> ‡. When
                    he ſent the apoſtles to preach the goſpel, he thus addreſſed them: “When they
                    deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye ſhall ſpeak, tor it ſlrall be
                    given you in that ſame hour what ye ſhall ſpeak; for it is not you that ſpeak,
                    but the ſpirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you.” The ſame promiſe was made
                    almoſt in the ſame words in the preſence of an immenſe multitude (Luke xii. 11,
                    12.) From theſe paſſages it has been urged, that if the apoſtles were to be
                    inſpired in the preſence of magiſtrates in delivering ſpeeches, which were ſoon
                    to be forgotten, it is ſurely reaſonable to conclude that they would be inſpired
                    when they were to compoſe a ſtandard of faith for the uſe of all future
                    generations of Chriſtians. If this concluſion be fairly deduced, it would follow
                    that the writings of the New Teſtament are the dictates of inſpiration, not only
                    in the doctrines and precepts, but in the very words. But it is a concluſion to
                    which ſincere Chriſtians have made objections; for, ſay they, though Chriſt
                    promiſes to aſſiſt his apoſtles in caſes of great emergency, where their own
                    prudence and fortitude could not be ſufficient, it does not follow that he would
                    dictate to them thoſe facts which they knew already, or thoſe reaſonings which
                    their own calm reflection might ſupply. Beſides, ſay they, if the New Testament
                    was dictated by the Holy Spirit, and only penned by the apoſtles, what reaſon
                    can be given for the care with which Chriſt inſtructed them both during his<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0152.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0146"/> miniſtry and
                    aſter his crucifixion in thoſe things pertaining to the kingdom of God?</p>
                <p>In anſwer to this, we may obſerve, that though it be difficult to prove that the
                    identical words of the New Teſtament were dictated by the Holy Spirit, or the
                    train of ideas infuſed into the minds of the ſacred writers, there is one
                    ſpecies of inſpiration to which the New Teſtament has an undoubted claim. It is
                    this, that the memories of the apoſtles were ſtrengthened and their
                    underſtandings preferred from falling into eſſential errors. This we prove from
                    theſe words of our Saviour, “and I will pray the Father, and he will give you
                    another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever. He ſhall teach you all
                    things, and bring all things to your rememberance whatſoever I have ſaid unto
                        you<note anchored="true" n="109" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*
                            John xiv. 16, 26.</p></note> *.” This promiſe was ſurely not reſtrained
                    to the day of Pentecoſt: it muſt have been a permanent gift enabling the
                    apoſtles at all times to remember with accuracy the diſcourſes of our Saviour.
                    When the apoſtles therefore (Matthew and John) relate thoſe precepts of Chriſt
                    which they themſelves had heard, they write indeed from memory, but under the
                    protection of the ſpirit who ſecures them from the danger of miſtake: and we
                    muſt of courſe conclude that their goſpels are inſpired.</p>
                <p>Were we called upon more particularly to declare what parts of the New Teſtament
                    we believe to be inſpired, we would anſwer, The doctrines, the precepts, and the
                    propheſies, every thing eſſential to the Chriſtian religion. From theſe the idea
                    of inſpiration is inſeparable. As to the events, the memory of the apoſtles was
                    ſufficient to retain them. If this opinion be juſt, it would enable us to
                    account for the diſcrepancies between the ſacred writers, wſhich are chiefly
                    confined to the relation of facts and events.</p>
                <p>All the books of the New Teſtament were originally written in Greek, except the
                    goſpel according to Matthew and the epiſtle to the Hebrews, which there is
                    reaſon to believe were compoſed in the Syro-Chaldaic language, which in the New
                    Teſtament is called Hebrew.</p>
                <p>Various reaſons have been aſſigned why the greateſt part of the New Teſtament was
                    written in Greek; but the true reaſon is this, It was the language beſt
                    underſtood both by writers and readers. Had St Paul written to a community in
                    the Roman province of Africa, he might have written perhaps in Latin; but
                    epiſtles to the inhabitants of Corinth, Galatia, Epheſus, Philippi, and
                    Theſſalonica, to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, from a native of Tarſus, could
                    hardly be expected in any other language than Greek. The ſame may be ſaid of the
                    epiſtles of St Peter, which are addreſſed to the Chriſtians of different
                    countries, who had no other language in common than the Greek; and likewiſe of
                    the epiſtles of St James, who wrote to Jews, that lived at a diſtance from
                    Paleſtine, and were ignorant of Hebrew. The native language of St Luke, as well
                    as of Theophilus, to whom he addreſſed his goſpel, and Acts of the apoſtles,
                    appears to have been Greek; and that St John wrote his goſpel in that language,
                    and not in Hebrew, is by no means a matter of ſurprife, ſince he wrote at
                    Epheſus.</p>
                <p><note anchored="false" n="110" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Michaelis,
                            vol. i. chap. 4. sect. I. p. 101.</p></note> With reſpect to the epiſtle
                    to the Romans, it may be aſked indeed why St Paul did not write in Latin? Now,
                    whoever propoſes this queſtion, muſt preſuppoſe that St Paul was maſter of the
                    Latin language in ſuch a degree as to find no difficulty in writing it; a
                    matter</p>
                <p>which remains to be proved. It is very probable that St Paul was acquainted with
                    the Latin; but between underſtanding a language, and being able to write it,
                    there is a very material difference. As St Paul was a native of Tarſus, his
                    native language was Greek; he had travelled during ſeveral years through
                    countries in which no other language was ſpoken, and when he addreſſed the Roman
                    centurion at Jeruſalem, he ſpoke not Latin, but Greek. Is it extraordinary,
                    then, that in writing to the inhabitants of Rome he ſhould have uſed a language
                    which was there ſo generally underſtood? It has been long remarked, that Greek
                    was at that time as well known in Rome as French in any court of modern Europe:
                    that according to Juvenal even the female ſex made uſe of Greek as the language
                    of familiarity and paſſion; and that in letters of friendſhip Greek words and
                    phraſes were introduced with greater freedom than French expreſſions in German
                    letters, as appears from Cicero’s epiſtles to Atticus, and from thoſe of
                    Auguſtus preſerved in the works of Suetonius. To this muſt be added a material
                    circumſtance, that a great part of the Roman Chriſtians conſiſted of native
                    Jews, who were better acquainted with Greek than with Latin, as either they
                    themſelves or their anceſtors had come from Greece, Alia Minor, or Egypt, in
                    which Greek was the language of the country. At leaſt they read the bible in
                    that language, as no Latin tranſlation of the Old Teſtament at that time
                    exiſted; and the Chriſtian church at that period conſiſting chiefly of Jews, the
                    heathen converts in Rome were of courſe under the neceſſity of accuſtoming
                    themſelves to the Greek language. In ſhort, St Paul in his epiſtle to the Romans
                    made uſe of a language in which alone thoſe who were ignorant of Hebrew could
                    read the bible. What has been here advanced reſpecting the epiſtle to the Romans
                    is equally applicable to the Greek of St Mark, on the ſuppoſition that it was
                    written at Rome.</p>
                <p>To the above arguments may be added the example of Joſephus, who, as well as the
                    Apoſtles, was by birth a Jew. He even lived in Rome, which is more than can be
                    ſaid of St Paul and St Mark, who reſided there only a certain time: he was
                    likewiſe younger than either; he came to Italy at an age which is highly
                    ſuitable to the learning of a language, and previous to that period had ſpent
                    ſeveral years in the Roman camp. The Jewiſh antiquities, the hiſtory of the
                    Jewiſh war, and the account of his own life, he wrote undoubtedly with a view of
                    their being read by the Romans; and yet he compoſed all theſe writings in Greek,
                    He expreſſes his motive for writing his Greek account of the Jewiſh war in the
                    following terms: “That having written in his native language (i. e. the Hebrew
                    dialect at that time ſpoken) a hiſtory of the war, in order that Parthians,
                    Babylonians, Arabians, Adiabenes, and the Jews beyond the Euphrates, might be
                    informed of thoſe events, he was now reſolved to write for the Greeks and
                    Romans, who had not been engaged in the campaigns, a more certain account than
                    had hitherto been given.” The motives which induced Joſephus to write in Greek
                    are fully as applicable to St Paul and St Mark.</p>

                    characterized the ſtyle of the New Teſtament. “The New Teſtament (ſays he) was
                    written in a language at that time common among the<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0153.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0147"/> Jews, which
                    may be named Hebraic Greek; the firſt traces of which we find in the tranſlation
                    of the LXX.</p>
                <p>“Every man acquainted with the Greek language, who had never heard of the New
                    Teſtament, muſt immediately perceive, on reading only a few lines, that the
                    ſtyle is widely different from that of the claſſic authors. We find this
                    character in all the books of the New Teſtament in a greater or leſs degree, but
                    we muſt not therefore conclude that they poſſeſs an uniformity of ſtyle. The
                    harſheſt Hebraiſms, which extend even to grammatical errors in the government of
                    caſes, are the diſtinguiſhing marks of the bowk of Revelation; but they are
                    accompanied with tokens of genius and poetical enthuſiaſm, of which every reader
                    muſt be ſenſible who has taſte and feeling. There is no tranſlation of it wſhich
                    is not read with pleaſure even in the days of childhood; and the very faults of
                    grammar are ſo happily placed as to produce an agreeable effect. The golpels of
                    St Matthew and St Mark have ſtrong marks of this Hebraic ſtyle; the former has
                    harſher Hebraiſms. than the latter, the fault of which may be aſcribed to the
                    Greek tranſlator, who has made too literal a verſion, and yet the goſpel of St
                    Mark is written in worſe language, and in a manner that is leſs agreeable. The
                    epiſtles of St James and St Jude are ſomewhat better; but even theſe are full of
                    Hebraiſms, and betray in other reſpects a certain Hebrew tone. St Luke has in
                    ſeveral paſſages written pure and claſſic Greek, of which the four firſt verſes
                    of his goſpel maybe given as an inſtance: in the ſequel, where he deſcribes the
                    actions of Chriſt, he has very harſh Hebraiſms, yet the ſtyle is more agreeable
                    than that of St Matthew or St Mark. In the Acts of the apoſtles he is not free
                    from Hebraiſms, which he ſeems to have never ſtudiouſly avoided; but his periods
                    are more claſſically turned, and ſometimes poſſeſs beauty devoid of art. St John
                    has numerous, though not uncouth, Hebraiſms both in his goſpel and epiſtles; but
                    he has written in a ſmooth and flowing language, and ſurpaſſes all the Jewiſh
                    writers in the excellence of narrative. St Paul again is entirely different from
                    them all; his ſtyle is indeed neglected and full of Hebraiſms, but he has
                    avoided the conciſe and verſe-like conſtruction of the Hebrew language, and has
                    upon the whole a conſiderable ſhare of the roundneſs of Grecian compoſition. It
                    is evident that he was as perfectly acquainted with the Greek manner of
                    expreſſion as with the Hebrew, and he has introduced them alternately, as either
                    the one or the other ſuggeſted itſelf the firſt, or was the beſt approved.”</p>
                <p>Michaelis has ſhown that the New Teſtament not only contains Hebraiſms but
                    Rabbiniſms, Syriaſms, Chaldaiſms, Arabiſms, Latiniſms, and Perſian words, of
                    which he has exhibited many ſpecimens. To theologians, whoſe duty it certainly
                    is to ſtudy the language of the New Teſtament with attention, we would
                    ſtrenouſly recommend the peruſal of this work, which in the Engliſh tranſlation
                    is one of the moſt valuable acceſſions to ſcriptural criticiſm that has yet
                    appeared. We ſpeak of the Engliſh tranſlation, which the large and judicious
                    notes of Mr Marſh has rendered infinitely ſuperior to the original.</p>
                <p>To the obſervations which have been made reſpecting the language of the New
                    Teſtament, a few remarks may be added concerning the peculiarities of the
                    ſtyle</p>
                <p>and manner of the ſacree writers, particularly the hiſtorians. Theſe remarks
                    extend to the Old Teſtament as well as to the New.— The first quality for which
                    the ſacred hiſtory is remarkable is ſimplicity in the ſtructure of the
                    ſentences. The firſt live verſes of Geneſis furniſh an example, which conſiſt of
                    eleven ſentences. The ſubſtantives are not attended by adjectives, nor the verbs
                    by adverbs, no ſynonymas, ſuperlatives, no effort at expreſſing things in a
                    bold, emphatical, or uncommon manner.</p>
                <p>2. The ſecond quality is ſimplicity of ſentiment, particularly in the Pentateuch,
                    ariſing from the very nature of the early and uncultivated ſtate of ſociety
                    about which that book is converſant.</p>
                <p>3. Simplicity of deſign. The ſubject of the narrative ſo engroſſes the attention
                    of the writer, that he himſelf is as nobody. He introduces nothing as from
                    himſelf, no remarks, doubts, conjectures, or reaſonings. Our Lord’s biographers
                    particularly excel in this quality. This quality of ſtyle we meet with in
                    Xenophon and Cæſar.</p>
                <p>The Evangeliſts may be ranked next to Geneſis for ſimplicity of compoſition in
                    the ſentences. John and Matthew are diſtinguiſhed for it more than Mark and
                    Luke. But the ſentiment is not ſo remarkable for ſimplicity in the Evangeliſt as
                    the Pentateuch. The reaſons of this difference are, the ſtate of the Jews was
                    totally changed; their manners, cuſtoms, amp;c. ſplit into factions both in
                    religion and politics. 2. The object of our Lord’s miniſtry, wſhich is the great
                    ſubject of the goſpels, was tο <hi rend="italic">inculcate a doctrine and
                        morality</hi> with which none of their ſyſtems perfectly coincided: beſides,
                    being conſtantly oppoſed by all the great men, the greater part of his hiſtory
                    conſiſts of inſtructions and diſputes. 3. As it is occupied with what our
                    Saviour ſaid and what he did, this makes two diſtinctions of ſtyle and manner;
                    that of our Saviour, and the ſacred penman’s. In their own character, they
                    neither explain nor command, promiſe nor threaten, praiſe nor blame. They
                    generally omit the names of our Lord’s enemies; thus directing our hatred at the
                    vices they committed, not at the perſons. They never mention ſuch perſons
                    without ne ceſſity; which is the cafe with the high-prieſt, Pilate, Herod, and
                    Judas: the three firſt for the chronology, the fourth to do juſtice to the
                    eleven.</p>
                <p>Herodias is indeed mentioned with diſhonour but her crime was a public one. On
                    the other hand, all perſons diſtinguiſhed for any thing virtuous are carefully
                    mentioned, Joſeph of Arimathea, Nicodemus, Zaccheus, Bartimeus, Jairus, Lazarus,
                    Mary, and Martha. They record their own faults (Peter’s, Thomas’s), nor do they
                    make any merit of their confeſſion. In one uniform ſtrain they relate the moſt
                    ſignal miracles and moſt ordinary facts.</p>
                <p>From the narrative is excluded that quality of ſtyle which is called <hi
                        rend="italic">animation.</hi> Nothing that diſcovers paſſion in the writer
                    or is calculated to excite the paſſions of the reader. Every thing is directed
                    to mend the heart.</p>
                <p>But in the diſcourſes and dialogues of our Saviour the expreſſion, without loſing
                    any thing of its ſimplicity, is often remarkable ſor ſpirit and energy.
                    Reſpecting harmony and ſmoothneſs, qualities which only add an external poliſh
                    to language, they had not the leaſt ſolicitud<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0154.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0148"/> As to
                    elegance, there is an elegance which reſults from the uſe of ſuch words as are
                    moſt in uſe with thoſe who are accounted fine writers, and from ſuch
                    arrangements in the words and clauſes as have generally obtained their
                    approbation, This is diſclaimed by the ſacred authors.</p>
                <p>But there is an elegance of a ſuperior order more nearly connected with the
                    ſentiment; and in this fort of elegance they are not deficient. In all the
                    oriental languages great uſe is made of tropes, eſpecially metaphors. When the
                    metaphors employed bear a ſtrong reſemblance, they confer vivacity: if they be
                    borrowed from objects which are naturally agreeable, beautiful, or attractive,
                    they add alſo elegance. The Evangeliſts furniſh us with many examples of this
                    kind of vivacity and elegance. Our Lord borrows tropes from cornfields,
                    vineyards, gardens, amp;c.</p>
                <p>As a valuable appendage to this part of our ſubject, we ſhall ſubjoin Dr
                    Campbell’s method of ſtudying the books of the New Teſtament. This we offer to
                    our readers as a beautiful inſtance of the judicious application of philoſophy
                    to ſacred ſtudies. It is the ſame method of diſcovering truth by analyſis and
                    induction, which was purſued by Sir Iſaac Newton with ſuch aſtoniſhing ſucceſs,
                    which ſince his time has been uniformly practiſed in natural philoſophy, and has
                    been alſo applied to chemiſtry, to medicine, to natural hiſtory, and to the
                    philoſophy of mind, by the ingenious Dr Reid. This is the path of found
                    philoſophy, which can alone lead to the diſcovery of truth. In following it, our
                    progreſs may be flow, but it will be ſure. If all theologians would ſteadily
                    adhere to it, we might then entertain the pleaſant hope of diſcarding for ever
                    thoſe abſurd ſyſtems of religion which are founded on ſingle paſſages and
                    detached fragments of ſcripture, and of eſtabliſhing opinions and doctrines on a
                    ſolid foundation.</p>
                <p>“1. To get acquainted with each writer’s ſtyle; to obſerve his manner of
                    compoſition, both in ſentences and paragraphs; to remark the words and phraſes
                    peculiar to him, and the peculiar application that he may ſometimes make of
                    ordinary words; for there are few of thoſe writers who have not their
                    peculiarities in all the reſpects now mentioned. This acquaintance with each can
                    be attained only by the frequent and attentive reading of his works in his own
                    language.</p>
                <p>“2. To inquire into the character, the ſituation, and the office of the writer,
                    the time, the place, and the occaſion of his writing, and the people for whoſe
                    immediate uſe he originally intended his work. Every one of theſe particulars
                    will ſometimes ſerve to elucidate expreſſions otherwiſe obſcure or doubtful.
                    This knowledge may in part be learned from a diligent and reiterated peruſal of
                    the book itſelf, and in part be gathered from what authentic, or at leaſt
                    probable, accounts have been tranſmitted to us concerning the compilement of the
                    canon.</p>
                <p>“3.The laſt general direction is, to conſider the principal ſcope of the book,
                    and the particulars chiefly obſervable in the method by which the writer has
                    purpoſed to execute his deſign. This direction is particularly applicable to the
                    epiſtolary writings, eſpecially thoſe of Paul.</p>
                <p>“4. If a particular word or phraſe occur, which appears obſcure, perhaps
                    unintelligible, the firſt thing we ought to do, if ſatisfied that the reading is
                    genuine, is to conſult the context, to attend to the manner wherein the term is
                    introduced, whether in a chain of reaſoning or in a hiſtorical narration, in a
                    deſcription, or included in an exhortation or command. As the concluſion is
                    inferred from the premiſſes, or as from two or more known truths a third unknown
                    or unobſerved before may fairly be deduced; ſo from ſuch attention to the
                    ſentence in connection, the import of an expreſſion, in itſelf obſcure or
                    ambiguous, will ſometimes with moral certainty be diſcovered. This, however,
                    will not always anſwer.</p>
                <p>“5. If it do not, let the ſecond conſideration be, whether the term or phraſe be
                    one of the writer’s peculiarities. If ſo, it comes naturally to be inquired,
                    what is the acceptation in which he employs it in other places? If the ſenſe
                    cannot be preciſely the ſame in the paſſage under review, perhaps, by an eaſy
                    and natural metaphor or other trope, the common acceptation may give riſe to one
                    which perfectly ſuits the paſſage in queſtion.— Recourſe to the other places
                    wherein the word or phraſe occurs in the ſame author is of conſiderable uſe,
                    though the term ſhould not be peculiar to him.</p>
                <p>“6. But thirdly, if there ſhould be nothing in the ſame writer that can enlighten
                    the place, let recourſe be had to the parallel paſſages, if there be any ſuch,
                    in the. other ſacred writers. By parallel paſſages, I mean thoſe places, if the
                    difficulty occur in hiſtory, wherein the ſame or a ſimilar ſtory, miracle, or
                    event, is related; if in teaching or reaſoning, thoſe parts wherein the ſame
                    argument or doctrine is treated, or the ſame parable propounded; and in moral
                    leſſons, thoſe wherein the ſame claſs of duties is recommended; or, if the
                    difficulty be found in a quotation from the Old Teſtament, let the parallel
                    paſſage in the book referred to, both in the original Hebrew, and in the Greek
                    verſion, be conſulted.</p>
                <p>"7. But if in theſe there be found nothing that can throw light on the expreſſion
                    of which we are in doubt, the fourth recourſe is to all the places wherein the
                    word or phraſe occurs in the New Teſtament, and in the Septuagint verſion of the
                    Old, adding to theſe the conſideration of the import of the Hebrew or Chaldaic
                    word, whoſe place it occupies, and the extent of ſignification, of which in
                    different occurrences ſuch Hebrew or Chaldaic term is ſuſceptible.</p>
                <p>“8. Perhaps the term in queſtion is one of thoſe which very rarely occur in the
                    New Teſtament, or thoſe called απαϠ λεγομενα, only once read in Scripture, and
                    not found at all in the tranſlation of the Seventy. Several ſuch words there
                    are. There is then a neceſſity, in the fifth place, for recurring to the
                    ordinary acceptation of the term in claſſical authors. This is one of thoſe
                    cases wherein the interpretation given by the earlieſt Greek fathers deferves
                    particular notice. In this, however, I limit myſelf to thoſe comments wherein
                    they give a literal expoſition of the ſacred text, and do not run into viſion
                    and allegory.”</p>
                <p>The manuſcripts of the New Teſtament are the natural ſource from which the
                    genuine readings of the Greek Teſtament are to be drawn. The printed editions
                    are either copies of more ancient editions, or of manuſcripts; and they have no
                    further authority than as they correſpond to the manuſcripts from which they
                    were originally taken. By manuſcripts of the New Teſtament, we mean thoſe only
                    which were written before<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0155.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0149"/> the invention of printing. The moſt ancient of
                    theſe are loſt, and there is no manuſcript now extant older than the ſixth
                    century. Few contain the whole New Teſtament; ſome contain the four goſpels;
                    ſome the Acts of the Apoſtles and Epiſtles; and others the book of Revelation.
                    The greateſt number are thoſe which contain the firſt part; thoſe which have the
                    ſecond, or the firſt and ſecond together, are likewiſe numerous; but thoſe of
                    the third are extremely few. It muſt be added alſo, that in many manuſcripts
                    thoſe epiſtles are omitted whoſe divine authority was formerly doubted.</p>
                <p>There are many manuſcripts which have been examined only for a ſingle text, ſuch
                    as 1 John v. 7. or at leaſt for a very ſmall number. Others have been examined
                    from the beginning to the end, but not completely, and in reſpect of all the
                    readings. A third claſs conſiſts of ſuch as either have been, or are ſaid to
                    have been, completely and accurately collated. But this requires ſuch phlegmatic
                    patience, that we can hardly expect to find in critical catalogues all the
                    various readings which have been only once collated. Wetſtein, in collating many
                    manuſcripts anew, made diſcoveries which had entirely eſcaped the notice of his
                    predeceſſors. The fourth claſs conſiſts of ſuch as have been completely and
                    accurately collated more than once; but here alſo we are in danger of being led
                    into error.— When various readings are transferred from one critical edition to
                    another, as from that of Gregory to Mill's edition, and from the latter to thoſe
                    of Bengel and Wetſtein, the manuſcripts muſt ſometimes be falſely named, and
                    various readings muſt frequently be omitted. And as Wetſtein has marked by
                    ciphers manuſcripts that in former editions had been denoted by their initial
                    letters, he could hardly avoid ſubſtituting, in ſome caſes, one figure inſtead
                    of another. The fifth claſs, which is by far the moſt valuable, conſiſts of ſuch
                    as have been printed word for word, and therefore form an original edition of
                    the Greek Teſtament. We can boaſt but of a very few manuſcripts of this kind.
                    Hearne printed at Oxford, in 1715, the Acts of the Apoſtles in Greek and Latin
                    from the Codex Laudianus 3.; Knittel has annexed to his edition of Ulphilas, p.
                    53—118, a copy of two very ancient fragments preſerved in the library of
                    Wolſembuttle; the one of the four Goſpels in general, the other of St Luke and
                    St John. Woide printed in 1786 the Codex Alexandrinus, a manuſcript of great
                    antiquity, which ſhall afterwards be more fully deſcribed; and the Univerſity of
                    Cambridge has reſolved to publiſh, in a ſimilar manner, the Cod. Cant. I. or, as
                    it is ſometimes called, the Codex Bezæ, the care of which is intruded to Dr
                    Kipling, a publication which will be thankfully received by every friend to
                    ſacred criticiſm. It was the intention of the Abbe Spoletti, a few years ago, to
                    publiſh the whole of the celebrated Codex Vaticanus; which would likewiſe have
                    been a moſt valuable acceſſion, ſince a more important manuſcript is hardly to
                    be found in all Europe. He delivered for this purpoſe a memorial to the Pope;
                    but the deſign was not put into execution, either becauſe the Pope refuſed his
                    aſſent, or the Abbé abandoned it himſelf. See the Oriental Bible, vol. xxii. n

                <p>“A very valuable library,” ſays Michaelis, “might <hi rend="italic">be compoſed
                        of the impreſſions of ancient manu</hi> ſ <hi rend="italic">cripts,</hi>
                    which, though too expenſive for a private perſon, ſhould be admitted into every
                    univerſity collection, eſpecially the Alexandrine and Cambridge manuſcripts, to
                    which</p>
                <p>I would add, if it were now poſſible to procure it, Hearne’s edition of the Codex
                    Laudianus 3. A plan of this fort could be executed only in England, by a private
                    ſubſcription, where a zeal is frequently displayed in literary undertakings that
                    is unknown in other countries; and it were to be wiſhed that the project were
                    begun before length of time has rendered the manuſcripts illegible, and the
                    attempt therefore fruitleſs. Ten thouſand pounds would go a great way toward the
                    fulfilling of this requeſt, if the learned themſclves did not augment the
                    difficulty of the undertaking, by adding their own critical remarks, and
                    endeavouring thereby to recommend their publications, rather than by preſenting
                    to the public a faithful copy of the original. Should poſterity be put in
                    poſſeſſion of faithful impreſſions of important manuſcripts, an acquiſition
                    which would render the higheſt ſervice to ſacred criticiſm, all theſe editions
                    of the New Teſtament ſhould be regulated on the ſame plan as Hearne’s edition of
                    the Acts of the Apoſtles.” It muſt be highly flattering to the patriotic ſpirit
                    of an Engliſhman to hear the encomiums which learned foreigners have ſo
                    profuſely beſtowed on our liberality in ſupporting works of genius and learning
                    and public utility. The plan which Michaelis propoſes to us, in preference to
                    all the other nations in Europe, is noble and magnificent, and would certainly
                    confer immortality on thoſe men who would give it their patronage and
                    aſſiſtance.</p>
                <p>There are many ancient manuſcripts, eſpecially in Italy, which have never been
                    collated, but lie ſtill unexplored. Here is a field where much remains to be
                    done. See Marſh’s Notes to Michaelis, vol ii. p. 643.</p>
                <p>Michaelis has given a catalogue of ancient manuſcripts, amounting in number to
                    292, to which he has added a ſhort account of each. In this place we ſhall
                    confine our obſervations to the moſt celebrated, the Alexandrian and Vatican
                    manuſcripts, which we have chiefly extracted ſrom Michaelis.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Alexandrine manuſcript</hi> conſiſts of four volumes; the
                    three firſt of which contain the Old Teſtament, the fourth the New Teſtament,
                    together with the firſt Epiſtle of Clement to the Corinthians, and a fragment of
                    the ſecond. In the New Teſtament, which alone is the object of our preſent
                    inquiry, is wanting the beginning as far as Matthew xxv. 6.ο νυμφιος ηϐχεται,
                    likewiſe from John vi. 50. to viii. 52. and from</p>
                <p>2 Cor. iv. 13. to xii. 7. It muſt likewiſe be obſerved, that the Pſalms are
                    preceded by the epiſtle of Athanaſius to Marcellinus, and followed by a
                    catalogue, containing thoſe which are to be uſed in prayer for each hour, both
                    of the day and of the night; alſo by 14 hymns, partly apocryphal, partly
                    biblical, the 11th of which is an hymn in praiſe of the Virgin Mary, entitled
                    ϖϐοσευχη μαϐιας της ϑεοτοχϖ; further, the <hi rend="italic">Hypotheses
                        Euſebii</hi> are annexed to the Pſalms, and his Canones to the Goſpels. It
                    is true, that this has no immediate reference to the New Teſtament, but may have
                    influence in determining the antiquity of the manuſcript itself.</p>
                <p>It has neither accents nor marks of aſpiration; it is written with capital, or,
                    as they are called, <hi rend="italic">uncial letters,</hi><pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0156.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0150"/> and has very
                    few abbreviations. There are no intervals between the words; but the ſenſe of a
                    paſſage is ſometimes terminated by a point, and ſometimes by a vacant ſpace.
                    Here ariſes a ſuſpicion that the copyiſt did not underſtand Greek, becauſe theſe
                    marks are ſometimes found even in the middle of a word, for inſtance Levit. v.

                <p>This manuſcript was preſented to Charles I. in 1628, by Cyrillus Lucaris
                    patriarch of Conſtantinople. Cyrillus himſelf has given the following account:
                    “We know ſo much of this manuſcript of the holy writings of the Old and New
                    Teſtament, that Thecla an Egyptian lady of diſtinction (nobilis ſaemina Ægyptia)
                    wrote it with her own hand 1500 years ago<note anchored="true" n="112"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(A) He wrote this in the year 1628.
                            According to this account, then, the manuſcript muſt have been written
                            in 328; a date to which ſo many weighty objections may be made, that its
                            moſt ſtrenuous advocates will hardly undertake to defend it. But this
                            error has furniſhed Oudin with an opportunity of producing many
                            arguments againſt the antiquity of the Codex Alexandrinus, which ſeem to
                            imply, that Grabe and others, who have referred it to the fourth
                            century, ſuppoſe it to have been written in the above-mentioned year.
                            Now it is probable, that the inference which has been deduced from the
                            account of Cyrillus is more than he himſelf intended to expreſs, as he
                            relates that Thecla lived after the council of Nicæa.</p></note> (A).
                    She lived ſoon after the council of Nicæa. Her name was formerly at the end of
                    the book; but when Chriſtianity was ſubverted in Egypt by the errors of Mahomet,
                    the books of the Chriſtians ſuffered the same fate, and the name of Thecla was
                    expunged. But oral tradition of no very ancient date (memoria et traditio
                    recens) has preſerved the remembrance of it.”</p>
                <p>But the reader will ſee that this account is merely traditional. Dr Semler very
                    properly obſerves, that there is no more reaſon to rely on a tradition
                    reſpecting the tranſcriber of an ancient manuſcript, than on a tradition which
                    relates to an ancient relic. The arguments which have been urged by Wetſtein,
                    Semler, Oudin, and Woide, to fix the date of this manuſcript, are ſo many, that
                    it would be tedious to repeat them. But, after all, its antiquity cannot be
                    determined with certainty, though it appears from the formation of the letters,
                    which reſemble thoſe of the fourth and fifth centuries, and the want of accents,
                    that it was not written ſo late as the tenth century. In this century it was
                    placed by Oudin, while Grabe and Schulze have referred it to the fourth, which
                    is the very utmoſt period that can be allowed, becauſe it contains the epiſtles
                    of Athanaſius. Wetſtein, with more probability, has choſen a mean between theſe
                    two extremes, and referred it to the fifth century: but we are not juſtified in
                    drawing this inference from the formation of the letters alone, for it is well
                    known that the ſame mode of forming the letters was retained longer in ſome
                    countries and in ſome monaſteries than in others.</p>
                <p>We are now in poſſeſſion of a perfect impreſſion of this manuſcript, which is
                    accompanied with ſo complete and ſo critical a collection of various readings,
                    as is hardly to be expected from the edition of any other manuſcript. Dr Woide
                    publiſhed it in 1786, with types caſt for that purpoſe, line for line, without
                    intervals between the words, as in the manuſcript itſelf. The copy is ſo perfect
                    a reſemblance of the original, that it may ſupply its place. Its title is Novum
                    Testamentum. Graecum e codice MS. Alexandrino qui Londini in Bibliotheca Muſei
                    Britannici aſſervatur deſcriptum It is a very ſplendid folio; and the preface of
                    the learned editor contains an accurate deſcription of the manuſcript, with an
                    exact liſt of all its various readings, that takes up no leſs than 89 pages; and
                    each reading is accompanied with a remark, in which is given an account of what
                    his predeceſſors Juninus, Walton, Fell, Mill, Grabe, and Wetſtein, had performed
                    or neglected.</p>
                <p>The Vatican manuſcript contained originally the whole Greek Bible, including both
                    the Old and New Teſtament; and in this reſpect, as well as in regard to its
                    antiquity, it reſembles none ſo much as the Codex Alexandrinus, but no two
                    manuſcripts are more diſſimilar in their readings, in the New Teſtament as well
                    as in the Old. After the Goſpels, which are placed in the uſual order, come the
                    Acts of the Apoſtles, which are immediately followed by the ſeven catholic
                    epiſtles. This muſt be particularly noted, becauſe ſome have contended that the
                    ſecond Epiſtle of St Peter, with the ſecond and third of St John, were wanting.
                    Profeſſof Hwiid, in a letter dated Rome, April 12. 1781, aſſured Michaelis that
                    he had ſeen them with his own eyes, that the ſecond Epiſtle of St Peter is
                    placed folio 1434, the ſecond of St John fol. 1442, the third folio 1443: then
                    follow the Epiſtles of St Paul, but not in the uſual order; for the Epiſtle to
                    the Hebrews is placed immediately after thoſe to the Theſſalonians: and it is
                    not improbable, that in the more ancient manuſcript, from which the Codex
                    Vaticanus was copied, this Epiſtle was even placed before that to the Epheſians,
                    and immediately after the Epiſtle to the Galatians<note anchored="true" n="113"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(B) Probably becauſe the Epiſtle to the
                            Hebrews, as well as the Epiſtle to the Galatians, relates to the
                            abolition of the Moſaic law.</p></note> (B): for the Epiſtles of St Paul
                    are divided into 93 ſections by figures written in the margin with red ink; but
                    the Epiſtle to the Galatians ends with 59, and that to the Epheſians begins with
                    70; the Epiſtle to the Hebrews, on the contrary, begins with 60, and ends with
                    69. With the words αμωμον τα δεϲ, Heb. ix. 14. the manuſcript ceaſes, the
                    remaining leaves being loſt. There is wanting, therefore, not only the latter
                    part of this Epiſtle, but the Epiſtles to Timothy, Titus, and Philemon, with the
                    Revelation of St John: but this laſt book, as well as the latter part of the
                    Epiſtle to the Hebrews, has been ſupplied by a modern hand in the 15th century.
                    In many places the faded letters have been alſo retouched by a modern, but
                    careful hand; and when the perſon who made theſe amendments, who appears to have
                    been a man of learning, found a reading in his own manuſcript which differed
                    from that of the Codex Vaticanus, he has noted it in the margin,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0157.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0151"/> and has
                    generally left the text itself untouched, though in ſome few examples he has
                    ventured to eraſe it.</p>
                <p>It is certain, that this manuſcript is of very high antiquity, though it has been

                    editors of the Roman edition of the Septuagint, in 1587, referred the date of
                    the Vatican manuſcript to the fourth century, the period to which the advocates
                    for its great rival refer the <hi rend="italic">Codex Alexandrinus.</hi> More
                    moderate, and perhaps more accurate, are the ſentiments of that great judge of
                    antiquity Montfaucon, who, in his <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                        Bibliοthecarum,</hi> p. 3. refers it to the fifth or ſixth century; and
                    adds, that though he had ſeen other manuſcripts of equal antiquity, he had found
                    none at the ſame time ſo complete.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Codex Vaticanus</hi> has a great reſemblance to the
                    manuſcripts noted by Wetſtein, C. D. L. 1. 13. 33. 69. 102. and to the Latin,
                    Coptic, and Ethiopie verſions; but it is preferable to moſt of them, in being
                    almoſt entirely free from thoſe undeniable interpolations and arbitrary
                    corrections which are very frequently found in the above-mentioned manuſcripts,
                    eſpecially in D. 1. and 69. It may be applied, therefore, as a mean not only of
                    confirming their genuine readings, but of detecting and correcting thoſe that
                    are ſpurious. It is written with great accuracy, and is evidently a faithful
                    copy of the more ancient manuſcript from which it was tranſcribed. Peculiar
                    readings, or ſuch as are found neither in other manuſcripts nor ancient
                    verſions, are ſeldom diſcovered in the <hi rend="italic">Codex Vaticanus;</hi>
                    and of the few which have been actually found, the greateſt part are of little
                    importance. But in proportion as the number of ſuch readings is ſmall, the
                    number of thoſe is great; in ſupport of which few only, though ancient
                    authorities, have been hitherto produced. But this manuſcript has not throughout
                    the whole New Teſtament the ſame uniform text.</p>
                <p>As we have now a beautiful printed edition of the Alexandrine manuſcript by Dr
                    Woide, it is much to be wiſhed that we had alſo an exact impreſſion of the
                    Vatican manuſcript. From the ſuperſtitious fears and intolerant ſpirit of the
                    inquiſition at Rome, all acceſſs to this manuſcript was refuſed to the Abbé
                    Spoletti, who preſented a memorial for that purpoſe. Unleſs the pope interpoſe
                    his authority, we muſt therefore deſpair of having our wiſhes gratified; but
                    from the liberality of ſentiment which the preſent pontiff has ſhown on ſeveral
                    occaſions, we hope that the period is not far diſtant when the Vatican library
                    will be open to the learned; and when the pope will think it his greateſt honour
                    to encourage their reſearches.</p>
                <p>The moſt valuable editions of the Greek New Teſtament are thoſe of Mill, Bengel,
                    and Wetſtein.</p>
                <p>The edition of Mill, which was only finiſhed 14 days before his death, occupied
                    the attention of the author for 30 years.</p>
                <p>The collections of various readings which had been made before the time of Mill,
                    the Veleſian, the Barberini, thoſe of Stephens, the London Polyglot, and Fell’s
                    edition, with thoſe which the Biſhop had left in manuſcript, and whatever he was
                    able to procure elſewhere, he brought together into one large collection. He
                    made likewiſe very conſiderable additions to it. He</p>
                <p>collated ſeveral original editions more accurately than had been done before: he
                    procured extracts from Greek manuſcripts, which had never been collated; and of
                    ſuch as had been before collated, but not with ſufficient attention, he obtained
                    more complete extracts. It is ſaid that he has collected from manuſcripts,
                    fathers, and verſions, not leſs than 30,000 various readings. This collection,
                    notwithſtanding its many imperfections, and the ſuperiority of that of Wetſtein,
                    is ſtill abſolutely neceſſary to every critic: for Wetſtein has omitted a great
                    number of readings which are to be found in Mill, eſpecially thoſe which are
                    either taken from the Vulgate, or confirm its readings. Mill was indeed too much
                    attached to this verſion; yet he cannot be accuſed of partiality in producing
                    its evidence, becauſe it is the duty of a critic to examine the witneſſes on
                    both ſides of the queſtion: and Wetſtein, by too frequently neglecting the
                    evidence in favour of the Vulgate, has rendered his collection leſs perfect than
                    it would otherwiſe have- been. He likewiſe added, as far as he was able,
                    readings from the ancient verſions; and is much to be commended for the great
                    attention which he paid to the quotations of the fathers; the importance of
                    which he had ſagacity enough to diſcern.</p>
                <p>It cannot, however, be denied, that Mill’s Greek Teſtament has many
                    imperfections, and ſome of real importance. His extracts from manuſcripts often
                    are not only incomplete, but erroneous; and it is frequently neceſſary to
                    correct his miſtakes from the edition of Wetſtein. His extracts from the
                    oriental verſions are alſo imperfect, becauſe he was unacquainted with theſe
                    languages; and in ſelecting readings from the Syriac, the Arabic, and Ethiopie,
                    he was obliged to have recourse to the Latin tranſlations, which are annexed to
                    thoſe verſions in the London Polyglot.</p>
                <p>The great diligence which Mill had ſhown in collecting ſo many various readings,
                    alarmed the clergy as if the Chriſtian religion had been in danger of
                    ſubverſion. It gave occaſion for a time to the triumphs of the deiſt, and
                    expoſed the author to many attacks. But it is now univerſally known, that not a
                    ſingle article of the Chriſtian religion would be altered though a deiſt were
                    allowed to ſelect out of Mill’s 30,000 readings whatever he ſhould think moſt
                    inimical to the Chriſtian cauſe.</p>
                <p>In 1734, Bengel abbot of Alpirſpach, in the duchy of Wurtemburg, publiſhed a new
                    edition of the Greek Teſtament. The fears which Mill had excited began to
                    ſubſide upon this new publication; for Bengel was univerſally eſteemed a man of
                    piety. Bengel was not only diligent in the examination of various readings, but
                    in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word conſcientious; for he conſidered it as an
                    offence againſt the Deity, if, through his own fault, that is, through levity or
                    careleſſneſs, he introduced a falſe reading into the ſacred text. His object was
                    not merely to make a collection of readings, and leave the choice of them to the
                    judgement of the reader, but to examine the evidence on both ſides, and draw the
                    inference: yet he has not given his own opinion ſo frequently as Mill, whom he
                    reſembled. in his reverence for the Latin verſion, and in the preference which
                    he gave to harſh and difficult readings, before thoſe which were ſmooth and
                    flowing. It may be obſerved in general, that he was a man of profound<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0158.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0152"/> learning, and
                    had a cool and ſound judgment, though it did not prevent him from thinking too
                    highly of the Latin readings, and of the <hi rend="italic">Codex
                        Alexandrinus,</hi> with other Latinizing manuſcripts.</p>
                <p>The imperfections of Bengel’s edition ariſe chiefly from his diffidence and
                    caution. He did not venture to inſert into the text any reading which had not
                    already appeared in ſome printed edition, even though he believed it to be the
                    genuine reading. In the book of Revelation indeed he took the liberty to inſert
                    readings which had never been printed; becauſe few manuſcripts had been uſed in
                    the printing of that book.</p>
                <p>The celebrated edition of John James Wetſtein, which is the moſt important of
                    all, and the moſt neceſſary to thoſe engaged in ſacred criticiſm, was publiſhed
                    at Amſterdam in 1751 and 1752, in two volumes folio. No man will deny that
                    Wetſtein’s <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> diſcover profound erudition,
                    critical penetration, and an intimate acquaintance with the Greek manuſcripts.
                    It is a work which in many reſpects has given a new turn to ſacred criticifm,
                    and no man engaged in that ſtudy can diſpenſe with it. Wherever Wetſtein has
                    delivered his ſentiments reſpecting a Greek manuſcript, which he has done leſs
                    frequently than Mill, and indeed leſs frequently than we could have wiſhed, he
                    ſhows himſelf an experienced and ſagacious critic. He is likewiſe more concile
                    than Mill in delivering his opinion, and does not ſupport it by producing ſo
                    great a number of readings from the manuſcript in queſtion. This conciſeneſs is
                    the conſequence of that warmth and haſte which were peculiar to Wetſtein’s
                    character, and which have ſometimes given birth to miſtakes. The fire of his
                    diſpoſition was likewiſe the cauſe of his advancing conjectures, in regard to
                    the hiſtory of his manuſcripts, which exceed the bounds of probability. But the
                    critical rules which he has delivered are perfectly juſt; and in this reſpect
                    there is a remarkable agreement between him and his eminent predeceſſors Mill
                    and Bengel. In regard to the Latin verſion alone they appear to differ: in Mill
                    and Bengel it has powerful, and perhaps partial, advocates; but in Wetſtein a
                    ſevere and ſagacious judge, who ſometimes condemns it without a cauſe. The Greek
                    manuſcripts which confirm the readings of the Vulgate, and which he ſuppoſed had
                    been corrupted from it, he of courſe condemned with equal ſeverity: and ſome
                    collections of various readings which had been made by Catholics, he made no
                    ſcruple to pronounce a forgery, ſaying, “ <hi rend="italic">Timeo Danaos, et
                        dona ferentes."</hi> But in conſequence of his antipathy to the Vulgate, his
                    collection of various readings is leſs perfect than it might have been.</p>
                <p>It has been aſked, 1. Whether he has quoted his manuſcripts either falſely or
                    imperfectly, in order to eſtabliſh his own religious opinions? or, <hi
                        rend="italic">2.</hi> Whether his diligence and accuracy has been ſuch that
                    we may at all times depend upon them? To the firſt of theſe queſtions there can
                    be no other anſwer, than that Wetſtein, in his character of a critic, is
                    perfectly honeſt. With reſpect to the ſecond, his diligence and accuracy,
                    Michaelis thinks there is leſs reaſon to pronounce him faultleſs. But Mr Marſh
                    has examined the examples on which Michaelis founds his affertion, and declares
                    that Michaelis is miſtaken in every one of them.</p>
                <p>The diligence of Wetſtein can ſcarcely be queſtioned</p>
                <p>by any who are acquainted with his hiſtory, He travelled into different
                    countries, and examined with his own eyes a much greater number of manuſcripts
                    than any of his predeceſſors. His collection of various readings amount to <hi
                        rend="italic">above a million;</hi> and he has not only produced a much
                    greater quantity of matter than his predeceſſors, but has likewiſe corrected
                    their miſtakes. The extracts from manuſcripts, verſions, and printed editions of
                    the Greek Teſtament, which had been quoted by Mill, are generally quoted by
                    Wetſtein. Whenever Wetſtein had no new extracts from the manuſcripts quoted by
                    Mill, or had no opportunity of examining them himſelf, he copied literally from
                    Mill; but wherever Mill has quoted from printed editions, as from the margin of
                    Robert Stephens’s for inſtance, or from the London Polyglot, Wetſtein did not
                    copy from Mill, but went to the original fource, as appears from his having
                    corrected many miſtakes in Mill’s quotations.</p>
                <p>In the opinion of Michaelis, there are many defects in the edition of Wetſtein,
                    which require to be ſupplied, and many errors to be corrected. Yet ſtill it muſt
                    be allowed to be a work of immenſe labour, and moſt valuable to thoſe engaged in
                    ſacred criticiſm; and it is ſurpriſing, when we conſider the difficulties and
                    labour which Wetſtein had to encounter, that his errors and imperfections are ſo
                    few.</p>
                <p>The propoſal of Michaelis, however, of a new collation of manuſcripts, in order
                    to form a complete collection of various readings, is worthy the attention of
                    the learned. In mentioning this propoſal, Michaelis turns a wiſhful eye towards
                    Britain, the only country, he ſays, which poſſeſſes the will and the means to
                    execute the taſk. Should a reſolution, he adds, be formed in this iſland, ſo
                    happily ſituated for promoting the purpoſes of general knowledge, to make the
                    undertaking a public concern, to enter into a ſubſcription, and to employ men of
                    abilities in collating manuſcripts both at home and abroad, they would be able
                    to do more in ten years than could otherwiſe be done in a century. And could
                    this nation direct its attention to any object more glorious or more uſeful than
                    in aſcertaining the text of the ſacred Sciptures, and giving to poſterity an
                    accurate edition?</p>
                <p>As the ſenſe of Scripture, as well as all other books, is affected by the
                    punctuation, it is of importance to determine whether the flops or points which
                    we find in the ſacred books were uſed by the ſacred writers, or have been
                    inſerted by modern tranſcribers.</p>
                <p>We are told by Montfaucβn, in his <hi rend="italic">Palaeοgraphia Graea,</hi> p.
                    31. that the perſon who firſt diſtinguiſhed the ſeveral parts of a period in
                    Greek writing, by the introduction of a point, was Ariſtophanes of Byzantium,
                    who lived under Ptolemæus Epiphanes, in the 145th Olympiad. But though pointe
                    were not uſed in books before this period, they were employed in inſcriptions
                    above 400 years before the birth of Chriſt. See <hi rend="italic">Mont. Pal.
                        Grac.</hi> p. 135.</p>
                <p>Under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Punctuation</hi> we mentioned, on
                    authority which we reckoned unqueſtionable, that the ancient manuſcripts were
                    written without any points. We have now, however, diſcovered, from Woide’s
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Codex Alexandrinus,</hi> that points are uſed
                    in that manuſcript, though omitted in the <hi rend="italic">fac simile</hi>
                        given<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0159.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0153"/> by
                    Montſaucon. That they are found too in the <hi rend="italic">Codex
                        Vaticanus,</hi> though not frequently, is related by Birch in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Prolegomena,</hi> p. 14.</p>
                <p>As the fact has not been generally known, that the ancients pointed their
                    manuscripts, and as it is an important and intereſting fact, we ſhall preſent
                    our readers with the firſt ſix lines of St John’s Goſpel, as they are pointed in
                    the Alexandrine manuſcript:</p>
                <p>ΕΝΑΡΧΗΝΟΛΟΓΟΣΚΑΙΟΛΟΓΟΣΗΝ</p>
                <p>ΠΡΟΣΤΟΝΘΝ ΚΑΙΘΣΗΝΟΛΟΓΟΣ·</p>

                <p>ΡΕΙΣΑϓΤΟϓΕΓΕΝΕΤΟΟϓΔΕΕΝ·</p>
                <p>ΟΓΕΓΟΝΕΝΕΝΑϓΤΩΖΩΗΗΝ·</p>
                <p>Whether any points for marking the ſenſe were uſed by the apoſtles, cannot be
                    determined; but the points now in uſe have been invented ſince.</p>
                <p>In the fourth century, Jerome began to add the comma and colon to the Latin
                    verſion; and they were then inſerted in many more ancient manuſcripts. In the
                    fifth century, Euthalius a deacon of Alexandria divided the New Teſtament into
                    lines. This diviſion was regulated by the ſenſe, ſo that each line ended where
                    ſome pauſe was to be made in ſpeaking. And when a copyiſt was diſpoſed to
                    contract his ſpace, and therefore crowded the lines into each other, he then
                    placed a point where Euthalius had terminated the line. In the eighth century,
                    the ſtroke was invented which we call a comma. In the Latin manuſcripts,
                    Jerome’s points were introduced by Paul Warnfried and Alcuin, at the command of
                    Charlemagne. In the ninth century, the Greek note of interrogation(;) was firſt
                    uſed. At the invention of printing the editors placed the points arbitrarily,
                    probably without beſtowing the neceſſary attention; and Stephens, in particular,
                    varied his points in every edition<note anchored="true" n="114" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(d)</hi> The reader will perceive
                            that the account of the origin of points is different from that given
                            under <hi rend="smallcaps">Punctuation.</hi> But the beſt authors differ
                            upon this ſubject. We ſhall perhaps reconcile the difference, by
                            ſuppoſing that points were invented at the time here mentioned, but were
                            not in general uſe till the time mentioned under the article <hi

                <p>The meaning of many paſſages in the Scripture has been altered by falſe pointing.
                    We ſhall produce one inſtance of this: Mat. v. 34. is commonly pointed in this
                    manner, εγω δε λεγω υμιν, μη ομοσαι ολως· μητε εν τω ϱραχω <hi rend="italic"
                        >,</hi> and conſequently tranſlated, “But I ſay unto you, ſwear not at all.”
                    But if, inſtead of the colon placed after ολως we ſubſtitute a comma, the
                    tranſlation will be, “But I ſay to you that you ought by no means to ſwear,
                    either by heaven, for it is his throne, or by earth, for it is his footſtool.”
                    The command of Chriſt therefore applies particularly to the abuſe of oaths among
                    the Phariſees, who on every trivial occaſion ſwore by the heaven, the earth, the
                    temple, the head, amp;c. but it implies no prohibition to take an oath in the
                    name of the Deity on ſolemn and important occaſions.</p>
                <p>The ancients divided the New Teſtament into two kinds of chapters, ſome longer
                    and ſome ſhorter. This method appears to be more ancient than St Jerome, for be
                    expunged a paſſage from the New Teſtament which makes an entire chapter. The
                    longer kind of chapters were called <hi rend="italic">breves,</hi> the ſhorter
                        <hi rend="italic">capitula.</hi> St Mat</p>
                <p>thew contained, according to Jerome, 68 breves; Mark contained 48; Luke 83; and
                    John 18. All the evangeliſts together conſiſted of 217 breves and 1126 capitula.
                    The inventor of our modern diviſion into chapters was Hugo de S. Caro, a French
                    Dominican friar who lived in the 13th century.</p>
                <p>The ancients had two kinds of verſes, one of which they called ςιχοι, and the
                    other ρηματα. The r <hi rend="italic">emata</hi> were lines which contained a
                    certain number of letters, like our printed books, and therefore often broke off
                    in the middle of a word. Joſephus’s 20 books of Antiquities contained 60,000 of
                    them, though in Ittiquis’s edition there are only 40,000 broken lines.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Stichi</hi> were lines meaſured by the ſenſe: according to an
                    ancient written lift mentioned by Father Simin, there were in the New Teſtament
                    18,612 of theſe.</p>
                <p>The verſes into which the New Teſtament is now divided are more modern, and an
                    imitation of the diviſion of the Old Teſtament. Robert Stephens, the firſt
                    inventor, introduced them in his edition in the year 1551. He made this diviſion
                    on a journey from Lyons to Paris; and, as his ſon Henry, tells us in the preface
                    to the Concordance of the New Teſtament, he made it <hi rend="italic">inter
                        equitandum.</hi> This phraſe probably means, that when he was weary of
                    riding, he amuſed himſelf with this work at his inn.</p>
                <p>This invention of the learned printer was ſoon introduced into all the editions
                    of the New Teſtament; and it muſt be confeſſed, that in conſulting and quoting
                    the Scriptures, and in framing concordances for them, a ſubdiviſion into minute
                    parts is of the greateſt utility. But all the purpoſes of utility could ſurely
                    have been gained, without adopting the haſty and indigeſted diviſion of
                    Stephens, which often breaks the ſenſe in pieces, renders plain paſſages
                    obſcure, and difficult paſſages unintelligible. To the injudicious diviſion of
                    Stephens we may aſcribe a great part of the difficulties which attend the
                    interpretation of the New Teſtament, and a great many of thoſe abſurd opinions
                    which have diſgraced the ages of the Reformation. For as ſeparate verſes appear
                    to the eyes of the learned, and to the minds of the unlearned, as ſo many
                    detached ſentences, they have been ſuppoſed to contain complete ſenſe, and they
                    have accordingly been explained without any regard to the context, and often in
                    direct oppoſition to it. Were any modern hiſtory or continued diſcourſe divided
                    into fragments with as little regard to the ſenſe, we ſhould ſoon find, that as
                    many oppoſite meanings could be forced upon them as have been forced upon the
                    books of the New Teſtament. The diviſion into verſes has been ſtill more
                    injurious to the Epiſtles than to the Goſpels, for there is a cloſe connection
                    between the different parts of the Epiſtles, which the verſes entirely diſſolve.
                    It is therefore to be wiſhed that this diviſion into verſes were laid aſide. The
                    Scriptures ought to be divided into paragraphs, according to the ſenſe; and the
                    figures ought to be thrown into the margin. In this way, the figures will retain
                    their utility<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0160.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0154"/>
                    without their diſadvantages. Dr Campbell, in his beautiful tranſlation of the
                    Goſpels, has adopted this method with great judgment and ſucceſs; and he who
                    will, read that tranſlation, will perceive that this ſingle alteration renders
                    the Goſpels much more intelligible, and, we may add, more entertaining<note anchored="true" n="115" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Hist. lib. 6.

                <p>The word ΕϒΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ſignifies any joyful tidings, and exactly correſponds to our
                    Engliſh word <hi rend="smallcaps">Gospel.</hi> In the New Teſtament this term is
                    confined to “The glad tidings of the coming of the Meſſiah.” Thus, in Mat. xi.
                    5. our Lord ſays, “The poor have the Goſpel preached;” that is, The coming of
                    the Meſſiah is preached to the poor. Hence the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Goſpel</hi> was given to the hiſtories of Chriſt, in which the good news of
                    the coming of the Meſſiah, with all its joyful circumſtances, are recorded.</p>
                <p>That the Goſpel according to Matthew was compoſed, ſays Dr Campbell, by one born
                    a Jew, familiarly acquainted with the opinions, ceremonies, and cuſtoms of his
                    countrymen; that it was compoſed by one converſant in the ſacred writings, and
                    habituated to their idiom; a man of plain ſenſe, but of little or no learning,
                    except what he derived from the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament; and finally,
                    that it was the production of a man who wrote from conviction, and had attended
                    cloſely to the facts and ſpeeches which he related, but who in writing
                    entertained not the moſt diſtant view of ſetting off himſelf—we have as ſtrong
                    internal evidence as the nature of the thing will admit, and much ſtronger than
                    that wherein the mind ninety-nine cafes out of a hundred acquieſces.</p>
                <p>That the author of this hiſtory of our bleſſed Saviour was Matthew, appears from
                    the teſtimony of the early Chriſtians. It is atteſted by Jerome, Auguſtin,
                    Epiphanius, and Chryſoſtom, and in ſuch a manner as ſhews that they knew the
                    fact to be uncontroverted, and judged it to be incontrovertible. Origen, who
                    flouriſhed in the former part of the 3d century, is alſo reſpectable authority.
                    He is quoted by Euſebius in a chapter<note anchored="true" n="116" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>† Euseb. Hist. Eccl. lib. V. cap
                            8.</p></note> * wherein he ſpecially treats of Origen’s account of the
                    ſacred canon. <hi rend="italic">“As</hi> I have learned (ſays Origen) <hi
                        rend="italic">by tradition</hi> concerning the four goſpels, which alone are
                    received without diſpute by the whole church of God under heaven; the firſt was
                    written by Matthew, once a publican, afterwards an apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi
                        rend="italic">who delivered it to the Jewiſh believers, compoſed in the
                        Hebrew language.”</hi> In another place he ſays, “Matthew writing for the
                    Hebrews who expected him who was to deſcend from Abraham and David, ſays the
                    lineage of Jeſus Chriſt, ſon of David, ſon of Abraham.” It muſt be obſerved,
                    that the Greek word παραδοσις does not exactly correſpond to the Engliſh word

                    from age to age. Παραδησις properly implies any thing tranſmitted from former

                    authority to which we ſhall have recourſe is that of Irenæus biſhop of Lyons,
                    who had been a diſciple of Polycarp. He ſays in the only book of his extant,
                    that “Matthew, among the Hebrews, wrote a<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0161.tif"

                    Paul were preaching the goſpel at Rome and founding the church there.”</p>
                <p>To the teſtimony of theſe writers it may be objected, that, except Irenæus, they
                    all lived in the third and fourth centuries, and conſequently their evidence is
                    of little importance. But there is ſuch unanimity in the teſtimony, that it muſt
                    have been derived from ſome authentic ſource. And is it fair to queſtion the
                    veracity of reſpectable men merely becauſe we knew not from what writings they
                    received their information? Many books which were then extant are now loſt; and
                    how do we know but theſe might have contained ſufficient evidence? Irenæus at
                    leaſt had the beſt opportunities of information, having been well acquainted in
                    his youth with Polycarp, the diſciple of John; no objection can therefore be
                    made to his evidence. But we can quote an authority ſtill nearer the times of
                    the apoſtles. Papias biſhop of Hierapolis, in Cæſarea, who flouriſhed about A.
                    D. 116, affirms that Matthew wrote his goſpel in the Hebrew tongue, which every
                    one interpreted as he was able<note anchored="true" n="118" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>§ Euseb. Hist. Eccl. Lib. III. cap. 39.</p></note> §.
                    Papias was the companion of Polycarp, and beſides muſt have been acquainted with
                    many perſons who lived in the time of the apoſtles. The fact therefore is fully
                    eſtabliſhed, that Matthew, the apoſtle of our Saviour, was the author of that
                    goſpel which is placed firſt in our editions of the New Teſtament.</p>
                <p>The next ſubject of inquiry reſpects the language in which it was written. This
                    we are aſſured by Papias, by Irenæus, and Origen, was the Hebrew; but the truth
                    of this fact has been diſputed by Eraſmus, Whitby, and others. Whitby urges the
                    improbability that Providence would have ſuffered the original of this goſpel to
                    be loSt, and nothing to remain but a tranſlation. This is an argument of no
                    force againſt written teſtimony; indeed we are always in danger of drawing falſe
                    concluſions when we argue from our own opinions of the conduct of Providence.
                        <hi rend="italic">For His ways are not as our ways, nor His thoughts as our
                        thoughts.</hi> But though we are forced to acknowledge that the goſpel
                    according to Matthew which we poſſeſs is a tranſlation, it is evidently a cloſe
                    one; and the very circumſtance that it has ſuperſeded the original, is a clear
                    proof that it was thought equally valuable by the ancient Chriſtians. It is
                    neceſſary to remark, that the language in which the goſpel according to Matthew
                    was originally compoſed, and which is called Hebrew by Papias, Irenæus, and
                    Origen, is not the ſame with the Hebrew of the Old Teſtament: it was what Jerome
                    very properly terms Syro-Chaldaic, having an affinity to both languages, but
                    much more to the Chaldean than to the Syrian.</p>
                <p>The time when this goſpel was compoſed has not been preciſely aſcertained by the
                    learned. Irenæus ſays that “Matthew publiſhed his goſpel when Peter and Paul
                    were preaching at Rome.” Now Paul arrived at Rome A. I). 60 or 61, and it is
                    very probable ſuffered martyrdom in A. D. 65. This may be juſtly concluded from
                    comparing the relation of Tacitus with that of Oroſius, a writer of the fifth
                        century<note anchored="false" n="119" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Lardner's Hist. of the Apostles.</p></note>. Oroſius having given an
                    account of Nero’s perſecution of the Chriſtians, and of the death of the two
                    apoſtles in it, adds, that it was followed by a peſtilence in the city, and
                    other diſaſters. And Tacitus relates that a peſtilence prevaileD in the city,
                    and violent ſtorms took place in Italy, in the year of Chriſt 65. Matthew’s
                    goſpel was therefore written between the year 60 and 65.</p>
                <p>That this hiſtory was primarily intended for the uſe of the Jews, we have,
                    beſides hIſtorical evidence, very ſtrong preſumptions from the book itſelf.<note anchored="false" n="120" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Dr.
                            Campbell's Preface to Matthew's Gospel.</p></note> Every cirumſtance is
                    carefully pointed out which might conciliate the faith of that nation; every
                    unneceſſary expreſſion is avoided, which might in any way ſerve to obſtruct it.
                    To come to particulars, there was no ſentiment relating to the Meſſiah with
                    which the Jews were more ſtrongly poſſeſſed, than that he muſt be of the race of
                    Abraham, and of the family of David. Matthew, therefore, with great propriety,
                    begins his narrative with the genealogy of Jeſus. That he ſhould be born at
                    Bethlehem in Judea, is another circumſtance in which the learned among the Jews
                    were univerſally agreed. His birth in that city, with ſome very memorable
                    circumſtances that attended it, this hiſtorian has alſo taken the firſt
                    opportunity to mention. Thoſe paſſages in the prophets, or other ſacred books,
                    which either foretel any thing that ſhould happen to him, or admit an alluſive
                    appellation, or were in that age generally underſtood to be applicable to events
                    which reſpect the Meſſiah, are never paſſed over in ſilence by this Evangeliſt.
                    The fulfilment of prophecy was always to the Jews, who were convinced of the
                    inſpiration of their ſacred writings, ſtrong evidence. Accordingly none of the
                    Evangeliſts has been more careful than Matthew, that nothing of this kind ſhould
                    be overlooked.</p>
                <p>That which chiefly diſtinguiſhes Matthew's writings from thoſe of the other
                    Evangeliſts, is the minute and diſtinct manner in which he has related many of
                    our Lord’s diſcourſes and moral inſtructions. Of theſe his ſermon on the mount,
                    his charge to the apoſtles, his illuſtrations of the nature of his kingdom, and
                    his prophecy on mount Olivet, are examples. He has alſo wonderfully united
                    ſimplicity and energy in relating the replies of his maſter to the cavils of his
                    adverſaries. Being early called to the apoſtleſhip, he was an eye and ear
                    witneſs of moſt of the things which he relates. And there are circumltances
                    which incline Dr Campbell to think that Matthew has approached as near the
                    preciſe order of time in which the events happened as any of the
                    Evangeliſts.</p>
                <p>Concerning the life of the apoſtle Matthew we have nothing to add, as the
                    principal circumſtances in his life have already been mentioned. See <hi

                <p>The Goſpel according to Matthew is cited ſeven times in the epiſtle of Barnabas,
                    twice in the firſt epiſtle of Clemens Romanus to the Corinthians, eight times in
                    the Shepherd of Hernias, ſix times in Polycarp’s ſmall epiſtle to the
                    Philippians, and ſeven times in the ſmaller epiſtles of Ignatius. Theſe

                <p>That Mark was the author of the goſpel which bears his name, and that it was the
                    ſecond in the order of time, is proved by the unanimous teſtimony of the ancient
                    Chriſtians. Many authorities are therefore unneceſſary; we ſhall only mention
                    thoſe of Papias and Irenæus. Euſebius has preſerved the following paſſage of
                        Papias<note anchored="false" n="121" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Hist. Eccl. lib. 3. cap. 39.</p></note>: “This is what was related by

                    interpreter wrote exactly whatever he remembered, not indeed in the order
                    wherein things were ſpoken and done by the Lord; for he was not himſelf a hearer
                    or follower of our Lord; but he afterwards, as I ſaid, followed Peter who gave
                    inſtructions as ſuited the occaſions, but not as a regular hiſtory of our Lord’s
                    teaching. Mark, however, committed no miſtake in writing ſuch things as occurred
                    to his memory: for of this one thing he was careful, to omit nothing which he
                    had heard, and to insert no falsehood into his narrative.” Such is the teſtimony
                    of Papias, which is the more to be regarded as he aſſigns his authority. He
                    ſpake not from hearsay, but from the information which he had received from a
                    moſt credible witneſs, John the elder, or preſbyter, a disciple of Jesus, and a
                    companion of the apoſtles.</p>
                <p>Irenæus, after telling us that Matthew publiſhed his goſpel whilſt Peter and Paul
                    were preaching at Rome, adds<note anchored="false" n="122" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Adv. Haer. lib. 3. cap. II.</p></note>: “After
                    their departure (εΕοδον), Mark alſo, the diſciple and interpreter of Peter,
                    delivered to us in writing the things which had been preached by Peter.” The
                    Greek εΣοδος, like the Engliſh word <hi rend="italic">departure,</hi> may either
                    denote death, which is a departure out of the world, or mean a departure out of
                    the city. It is probably in the former of theſe senses it is here uſed. Yet by
                    the accounts given by ſome others, Mark’s goſpel was publiſhed in Peter’s
                    lifetime, and had his approbation. The goſpel of Mark is ſuppoſed to be but two
                    years poſterior in date to that of Matthew. The preciſe year, however, cannot be
                    determined with certainty; and it is a matter of no importance, ſince we have
                    aſcertained the author and the time in which he lived.</p>
                <p>Mark has generally been ſuppoſed to be the ſame perſon who is mentioned in the
                    acts and ſome of Paul’s epiſtles, who is called John, and was the nephew of
                    Barnabas. But as this perſon was the attendant of Paul and Barnabas, and is
                    nowhere in ſcripture ſaid to have accompanied Peter in his apoſtolical mission,
                    which ancient writers inform us the author of the goſpel did, Dr Campbell has
                    justly concluded that theſe were different perſons<note anchored="false" n="123" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Preface to Mark.</p></note>. The
                    author of the goſpel is certainly meant by Peter when he ſays <hi rend="italic"
                        >Marcus my son ſaluteth you</hi><note anchored="true" n="124" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">‖</hi> I. Pet. v. 13.</p></note>
                    <hi rend="italic">‖.</hi></p>
                <p>That Mark wrote his goſpel in Greek, is as evidently conformable to the teſtimony
                    of antiquity, as that Matthew wrote his in Hebrew or Syro Chaldaic. The
                    cardinals Baronins and Bellarmine, anxious to exalt the language in which the
                    vulgate was written, have maintained that this Evangeliſt publiſhed his work in
                    Latin. The only appearance of teſtimony which has been produced in ſupport of
                    this opinion is the inſcription subjoined to this goſpel in Syriac, and in some
                    other oriental verfloss. But theſe poſtſcripts are not the teſtimonies of the
                    tranſlators: they proceed from the conjecture of ſome tranſcriber but when
                    written, or by whom, is equally unknown. Againſt poſitive teſtimony therefore
                    they are entitled to no credit.</p>
                <p>From the Hebraiſms in the ſtyle, we ſhould readily conclude that the author was
                    by birth and education a Jew. There are alſo expreſſions wſhich ſhow that he had
                    lived for ſome time among the Latins, as χεντυριαν, “centurion,” and σπεχϭλατωρ,
                    “ſentinel;” words which do not occur in the other goſpels. There are other
                    internal evidences that this goſpel was written beyond the confines of Judea,
                    The firſt time the Jordan is mentioned, ποταυος, “river,” is added to the name
                    for explanation<note anchored="true" n="125" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>[m] Dr. Campbell's Preface to Mark's Gospel.</p></note>; for though
                    no perſon in Judea needed to be informed that Jordan was a river, the caſe was
                    different in diſtant countries. The word <hi rend="italic">Gehenna,</hi> which
                    is tranſlated <hi rend="italic">Hell</hi> in the New Teſtament, originally
                    ſignified the V <hi rend="italic">alley of Hinnom,</hi> where infants had been
                    ſacriſiced by fire to Moloch, and where a continual fire was afterwards kept up
                    to conſume the filth of Jeruſalem. As this word could not have been understood
                    by a foreigner, the Evangeliſt adds, by way of explanation, πυρ το ασβεςον, “the
                    unquenchable fire.” Instead of the word <hi rend="italic">Mammon,</hi> he uſes
                    the common term “riches.” When he employs the oriental word <hi rend="italic"
                        >Corbοn,</hi> he ſubjoins the interpretation ό εςι δωρον, that is, “a gift.”
                    Theſe peculiarities will corroborate the historical evidence that has been
                    already mentioned, that Mark intended his goſpel for the uſe of the
                    Gentiles.</p>
                <p>It has been affirmed that this evangeliſt is the abridger of Matthew. It is true
                    that Mark ſometimes copies the expreſſions uſed by Matthew; but he is not to be
                    considered as a mere abridger, for he omits altogether ſeveral things related by
                    Matthew, viz. our Lord’s pedigree, his birth, the viſit of the Magians, Joſeph's
                    flight into Egypt, and the cruelty of Herod. Dr Lardner has given a list of
                    thirty-three paſſages, wherein circumſtances are related which are omitted by
                    the other evangeliſts. There is one parable, and an account of two miracles
                    peculiar to Mark. The parable or similitude is mentioned in chap. iv. 26. One of
                    theſe miracles was the curing of a deaf and dumb man, chap, vii. 31, 37. The
                    other was the giving fight to a blind man at Bethſaida, chap, viii. 22, 26. The
                    ſtyle of Mark, inſtead of being more conciſe than that of Matthew, is more
                    diffuſe. That he had read Matthew’s goſpel cannot be doubted, but that he
                    abridged it, is a miſtake.</p>
                <p>According to the teſtimony which has been already produced, Mark derived his
                    information from the apoſtle Peter. It would be improper, therefore, not to
                    remark, that this evangeliſt has omitted many things tending to Peter’s honour,
                    wſhich are related in the other goſpels, and has given the moſt particular
                    account of Peter’s fall. This goſpel is ſeven times cited by Irenæus, and nine
                    times by Tertullian.</p>
                <p>That the author of the gospel which is the third in order was Luke, the companion
                    of the apoſtle Paul, is evident from the teſtimonies of Irenæus, Clemens of
                    Alexandria, Origen, Tertullian, and many succeeding writers. But it has been
                    diſputed whether he was a Jew or a Gentile. That Luke was a Jew by birth, or at
                    leaſt by religion, may be argued from his being a constant companion of Paul. If
                    he had been an un- circumciſed Gentile, exceptions would have been made to him,
                    eſpecially at Jeruſalem; but nothing of that kind appears. It is alſo rendered
                    highly probable, from his mode of computing time by the Jewi <hi rend="italic"
                        >‖</hi> h feſtivals, and from his frequent uſe of the Hebrew idiom. It has
                    been ſuppoſed that Luke was one of the 70 diſciples; but he does not pretend to
                    have been a witneſs of our Lord’s miracles and teaching; on the contrary, be
                    tells us in his introduction, that he received his information from others.</p>
                <p>The deſign of Luke in writing his goſpel was to ſu-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0163.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0157"/> perſede ſome
                    imperfect and inaccurate hiſtories of our Saviour, which had then been
                    publiſhed. What theſe were, it is impoſſible now to determine, as they are not
                    mentioned by any contemporary writer, and probably did not ſurvive the age in
                    which they were compoſed.</p>
                <p>It has been ſuppoſed that Luke chiefly derived his information from the apoſtle
                    Paul, whom he faithfully attended in his travels; but, from Luke’s own words, we
                    are led to conclude, that the principal ſource of his intelligence, as to the
                    facts related in the goſpel, was from thoſe who had been eye and ear witneſſes
                    of what our Lord both did and taught. Now Paul evidently was not of this number.
                    It was from converſing with ſome of the twelve apoſtles or diſciples of our
                    Lord, who heard his diſcourſes and ſaw his miracles, that he obtained his
                    information.</p>
                <p>As to the time when this goſpel was written, we have hardly any thing but
                    conjecture to guide us. But as Origen, Euſebius, and Jerome, have ranged it
                    after thoſe of Matthew and Mark, we have no reaſon to doubt but they were
                    written in the ſame order.</p>
                <p>The goſpel by Luke has ſupplied us with many intereſting particulars which had
                    been omitted both by Matthew and Mark. It has given a diſtinct narration of the
                    circumſtances attending the birth of John the Baptiſt and the nativity of our
                    Saviour. It has given an account of ſeveral memorable incidents and cures which
                    had been overlooked by the rest; the converſion of Zaccheus the publican; the
                    cure of the woman who had been bowed down for 18 years; the cure of the
                    dropſical man; the cleanſing of the ten lepers; the inhoſpitable treatment of
                    our Saviour by the Samaritans, and the inſtructive rebuke which he gave on that
                    occaſion to two of his diſciples for their intemperate zeal; alſo the affecting
                    interview which he had after his reſurrection with two of his diſciples. Luke
                    has alſo added many edifying parables to thoſe which the other evangeliſts had
                    recorded. Moſt of theſe are ſpecified by Irenæus as particularly belonging to
                    this goſpel, and has thereby ſhown to us, without intending it, that the goſpel
                    of Luke was the ſame in his time that it is at preſent.</p>
                <p>The ſtyle of this evangeliſt abounds as much with Hebraiſms as any of the ſacred
                    writings, but it contains more of the Grecian idiom than any of them. It is alſo
                    diſtinguiſhed by greater variety and copiouſnefs; qualities which may be juſtly
                    aſcribed to the ſuperior learning of the author. His occupation as a phyſician
                    would naturally induce him to employ ſome time in reading, and give him eaſier
                    acceſs to the company of the great than any of the other evangeliſts. As an
                    inſtance of Luke’s copiouſnefs, Dr Campbell has remarked that each of the
                    evangeliſts has a number of words which are uſed by none of the reſt; but in
                    Luke’s goſpel the number of ſuch peculiarities or words, uſed in none of the
                    other goſpels, is greater than that of the peculiar words found in all the three
                    other goſpels put together; and that the terms peculiar to Luke are for the moſt
                    part long and compound words. The ſame judicious writer has alſo obſerved, that
                    there is more of compoſition in Luke’s ſentences than is found in the other
                    three, and conſequently lcſs ſimplicity. Of this the very firſt ſentence is an
                    example, which occupies no leſs than four verſes. Luke, too, has a greater
                    reſemblance to ether hiſtorians, in giving what may be called his own verdict in
                    the narrative part of this work; a freedom which the other evangeliſts have
                    ſeldom or never ventured to uſe. He calls the Phariſees <hi rend="italic">lovers

                    affecting ſweetneſs of manner with genuine ſimplicity.</p>
                <p>This goſpel is frequently cited by Clemens Romanus, the contemporary of the
                    Apoſtles, by Ignatius, and Juſtin Martyr. Irenæus has made above a hundred

                <p>That the goſpel which is placed laſt in our editions of the New Teſtament was
                    written by John, one of our Saviour’s apoſtles, is confirmed by the unanimous
                    teſtimony of the ancient Chriſtians. He was the ſon of Zebedee, a fiſherman of
                    Bethſaida in Galilee, by his wife Salome, and the brother of James, ſurnamed the
                    elder or greater. He was the beloved diſciple of our Saviour, and was honoured,
                    along with Peter and James, with many marks of diſtinction which were not
                    conferred on the other diſciples. He poſſeſſed a high degree of intrepidity and
                    zeal, a warm and affectionate heart, and was ſtrongly attached to his mailer.
                    His brother James and he were honoured with the title of Boanerges, or <hi
                        rend="italic">Sons oſ Thunder.</hi> He was anxious to reſtrain whatever he
                    conſidered as a mark of diſreſpect againſt his maſter, and to puniſh his enemies
                    with ſeverity. He was incenſed againſt ſome perſons for attempting to caſt out
                    demons in the name of Jeſus; and required them to deſist becauſe they were not
                    his diſciples. James and he propoſed to our Saviour to call down fire from
                    heaven to puniſh the inhoſpitable Samaritans. Nor was the courage of John leſs
                    ardent than: his zeal. When Peter had diſowned his Lord, and all the other
                    diſciples had fled, John continued to attend his maſter. He was preſent at his
                    trial, and followed him to the croſs, where he was a ſpectator of his ſufferings
                    and death. The interview between Jeſus and this diſciple at Calvary, though
                    conciſely related, is an event which will ſtrongly affect every man of feeling,
                    while it convinces him of the unalterable affection of Jeſus to his beloved
                    diſciple, as well as diſcovers his reſpectful tenderneſs for his mother. See <hi

                <p>The ancients inform us, that there were two motives which induced John to write
                    his goſpel; the one, that he might refute the hereſies of Cerinthus and the
                    Nicolaitans, who had attempted to corrupt the Chriſtian doctrine; the other
                    motive was, that he might ſupply thoſe important events in the life of our
                    Saviour which the other evangeliſts had omitted. Of the former of theſe motives
                    Irenæus gives us the following account: “John, deſirous to extirpate the errors
                    Town in the minds of men by Cerinthus, and ſome time before by thoſe called
                    Nicolaitans, publiſhed his goſpel; wherein he acquaints us that there is one
                    God, who made all things by his word, and not, as they ſay, one who is the
                    Creator of the world, and another who is the father<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0164.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0158"/> of the Lord;
                    one the ſon of the Creator, and another the Chriſt, from the ſuperceleſtial
                    abodes who deſcended upon Jeſus, the ſon of the Creator, but remained
                    impaſſible, and afterwards fled back into his own pleroma or fulneſs.” As
                    Irenæus is the moſt ancient author who has written upon this ſubject, many
                    appeals have been made to his authority. The authority of Irenæus is certainly
                    respectable, and we have often referred to his teſtimony with confidence; but we
                    think it neceſſary to make a diſtinction between receiving his teſtimony to a
                    matter of fact, and implicitly adopting his opinion. He does not tell us, that
                    he derived his information from any preceding writer, or indeed from any perſon
                    at all. Nay, he ſeems to have believed that John wrote againſt theſe hereſies by
                    a prophetic ſpirit; for he ſays in another place, chap. xx. 30. “As John the
                    diſciple of our Lord aſſures us, laying, But theſe are written, that ye might
                    believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, the Son of God, and that believing ye might
                    have life through his name; <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> foreseeing</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">theſe blaſphemous notions that divide the Lord, ſo far as it
                        is in their power.”</hi></p>
                <p>Indeed it ſeems very improbable that an apoſtle ſhould write a hiſtory of our
                    Lord on purpoſe to confute the wild opinions of Cerinthus or any other heretic.
                    Had John conſidered ſuch a confutation neceſſary, it is more likely that he
                    would introduce it into an epiſtle than blend it with the actions of his
                    venerable Maſter. But were the opinion of Irenæus well- founded, we ſhould
                    ſurely diſcover ſome traces of it in the goſpel of John; yet except in the
                    introduction, there is nothing that can with the leaſt ſhadow of probability be
                    applied to the opinions of Cerinthus; and few, we preſume, will affirm, that the
                    goſpel of John was compoſed merely for the ſake of the firſt eighteen"
                    verſes.</p>
                <p>The intention of John in writing his goſpel was far more extenſive and important
                    than to refute the opinions of a few men who were to ſink into oblivion in the
                    courſe of a few centuries. It was evidently (according to the opinion of Clemens
                    of Alexandria) to ſupply the omiſſions of the other evangeliſts: It was to
                    exhibit the evidences of the Chriſtian religion in a diſtinct and perſpicuous
                    manner: It was, as he himſelf in the concluſion of his goſpel aſſures us, to
                    convince his readers, <hi rend="italic">that Jeſus is the Messiah, the Son oſ
                        God, and that believing they might have life through his name</hi><note

                            argued ſrom a paſſage in this goſpel, that it muſt have been written
                            before the deſtruction of Jeruſalem. In ſpeaking of the pool of
                            Bethſaida, John uſes the preſent tenſe; His words are, “There <hi
                                rend="italic">is</hi>
                            <pb n="159"/>at Jeruſalem.” Now if theſe words had been written after
                            the deſtruction of Jeruſalem, it is urged the paſt tenſe would have been
                            uſed, and not the preſent. This argument is more ſpecious than forcible.
                            Though Jeruſalem was demoliſhed, does it follow that the pool of
                            Bethſaida was dried up? </p></note><hi rend="italic">*.</hi> Now it will
                    appear to any perſon who reads this goſpel with attention, that he has executed
                    his plan with aſtoniſhing ability, and has given the moſt circumſtantial and
                    ſatisfactory evidence that Jeſus was the Meſſiah the Son of God. After declaring
                    the pre-exiſtence of Jeſus, he proceeds to deliver the teſtimony of John the
                    Baptiſt, and ſelects ſome of the greateſt miracles of Jeſus to prove his divine
                    million. In the fifth chapter he preſents us with a difcourſe which our Saviour
                    delivered in the temple in the preſence of the Jews, wherein he ſtates in a very
                    diſtinct manner the proofs of his miſſion from, 1. The teſtimony of John; 2. His
                    own miracles; 3. The declaration of the Father at his baptiſm;</p>
                <p>4. The Jewriſh Scriptures. Indeed the concluſion that Jeſus was the Meſſiah the
                    Son of God, naturally ariſes from almoſt every miracle which our Saviour is ſaid
                    to have performed and from every diſcourſe that he delivered. This declaration
                    is very often made by our Saviour himſelf; particularly to the woman of Samaria,
                    to Nicodemus, and to the bhnd man whom he had cured.</p>
                <p>It muſt be evident to every reader, that John ſtudiouſly paſſes over thoſe
                    paſſages in our Lord’s hiſtory and teaching which had been treated at large by
                    the other evangeliſts, or if he mentions them at all he mentions them ſlightly.
                    This confirms the teſtimony of ancient writers, that the firſt three goſpels
                    were written and publiſhed before John compoſed his goſpel. Except the relation
                    of our Saviour’s trial, death, and reſurrection, almoſt every thing which occurs
                    in this book is new.<note anchored="true" n="127" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* John xv. 31.</p></note> The account of our
                    Saviour’s nativity, of his baptiſm, and of his temptation in the wilderneſs, is
                    omitted; nor is any notice taken of the calling of the twelve apoſtles, or of
                    their miſſion during our Saviour’s life. It is remarkable, too, that not one
                    parable is mentioned, nor any of the predictions relating to the deſtruction of
                    Jeruſalem. All the miracles recorded by the other evangeliſts are paſſed over,
                    except the miraculous ſupply of proviſion, by which five thouſand were fed: and
                    it is probable that this miracle was related for the ſake of the diſcourſe to
                    which it gave birth. The other miracles which are mentioned are few in number,
                    but in general they are minutely detailed. They conſiſt of theſe: the turning of
                    water into wine at Cana; the cure oſ the diſeaſed man at the pool of Betheſda;
                    the cure of the man that had been blind from his birth; the reſtoring of Lazarus
                    to life; and the healing of the ſervant’s ear which Peter had cut off. But
                    valuable would this goſpel be, though it had only recorded the conſolation of
                    Jeſus to his diſciples previous to his departure; which exhibits a moſt
                    admirable view of our Saviour’s character, of his care and tender regard for his
                    diſciples. Having opened every ſource of comfort to their deſponding minds;
                    exhorted them to mutual love, and to the obedience of his Father’s precepts;
                    having warned them of the impending dangers and ſorrows—our Saviour concludes
                    with a prayer, in the true ſpirit of piety and benevolence; ardent without
                    enthuſiaſm, ſober and rational without lukewarmneſs.</p>
                <p>The time in which this goſpel was written has not been fixed with any preciſion.
                    Irenæus informs us, that it was written at Epheſus, but leaves us to conjecture
                    wſhether it was written before or after John’s return from Patmos. He was
                    baniſhed to Patmos by Domitian, who reigned 15 years, and according to the beſt
                    computation died A. D. 96. The persecution which occaſioned the exile of John
                    commenced in the 14th year of Domitian’s reign. If John wrote his goſpel after
                    his return to Epheſus, which is affirmed by Epiphanius to have been the caſe, we
                    may fix the date of it about the year 97<note anchored="false" n="128" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Dr. Campbell's Preface to John's

                <p>This goſpel is evidently the production of an illite <pb

                    its ſtyle is remarkable for ſimplicity. It abounds more with Hebraiſms than any
                    of the other goſpels; and contains ſome ſtrong oriental figures which are not
                    readily underſtood by an European.</p>
                <p>This goſpel is cited once by Clemens Romanus, by Barnabas three times, by
                    Ignatius five times, by Juſtin Martyr fix times, by Irenæus, and above forty
                    times by Clemens Alexandrinus.</p>
                <p>The book which we intitle the Acts of the Apoſtles connects the goſpels and the
                    epiſtles. It is evidently a continuation of Luke’s goſpel, which appears both
                    from the introduction and from the atteſtations of ancient Christians. Both are
                    dedicated to Theophilus; and in the beginning of the Acts a reference is made to
                    his goſpel, which he calls <hi rend="italic">a former treatiſe,</hi> recording
                    the actions and diſcourſes of Jeſus till his aſcenſion to heaven. Luke is
                    mentioned as the author of the Acts of the Apoſtles by Irenæus, by Tertullian,
                    by Origen, and Euſebius.</p>
                <p>From the frequent uſe of the firſt perſon plural, it is manifeſt that Luke the
                    author was preſent at many of the tranſactions which he relates. He appears to
                    have accompanied Paul from Troas to Philippi. He attended him alſo to Jeruſalem,
                    and afterwards to Rome, where he remained for two years. He is mentioned by Paul
                    in ſeveral of thoſe epiſtles which were written from Rome, particularly in the
                    2d epiſtle to Timothy, and in the epiſtle to Philemon.</p>
                <p>This book contains the hiſtory of the Chriſtian church for the ſpace of about 28
                    or 30 years, from the time of our Saviour’s aſcenſion to Paul’s arrival at Rome
                    in the year 60 or 61. As it informs us that Paul reſided two years in Rome, it
                    muſt have been written after the year 63; and as the death of Paul is not
                    mentioned, it is probable it was compoſed beſore that event, which happened A.

                <p>All the eſſential doctrines and precepts of the Christian religion were certainly
                    taught by our Saviour himſelf, and are contained in the goſpels. The epiſtles

                <p>It is more difficult to underſtand the epiſtolary writings than the goſpels; the
                    cauſe of which is evident. Many things are omitted in a letter, or ſlightly
                    mentioned becauſe ſuppoſed to be known by the perſon to whom it is addreſſed. To
                    a ſtranger this will create much<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0166.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0160"/> difficulty. The buſineſs about which St Paul
                    wrote was certainly well known to his correſpondents; but at this diſtance of
                    time we can obtain no information concerning the occcaſion of his writing, of
                    the character and circumſtances of thoſe perſons for whom his letters were
                    intended, except what can be gleaned from the writings themſelves. It is no
                    wonder, therefore, tho’ many alluſions ſhould be obſcure. Beſides, it is evident
                    from many paſſages that he anſwers letters and queſtions which his
                    correſpondents had ſent him. If theſe had been preſerved, they would have thrown
                    more light upon many things than all the notes and conjectures of the
                    commentators.</p>
                <p>The cauſes of obſcurity which have been now mentioned are common to all the
                    writers of the epiſtles; but there are ſome peculiar to St Paul. I. As he had an
                    acute and fertile mind, he ſeems to have written with great rapidity, and
                    without attending much to the common rules of method and arrangement. To this
                    cauſe we may aſcribe his numerous and long parentheſes. In the heat of argument
                    he ſometimes breaks off abruptly to follow out ſome new thought; and when he has
                    exhauſted it, he returns from his digreſſion without informing his readers; ſo
                    that it requires great attention to retain the connection. 2. His frequent
                    change of perſon, too, creates ambiguity: by the pronoun <hi rend="italic"
                        >I</hi> he ſometimes means himſelf; ſometimes any Chriſtian; ſometimes a
                    Jew, and ſometimes any man. In uſing the pronoun <hi rend="smallcaps">we</hi> he
                    ſometimes intends himſelf, ſometimes comprehends his companions, ſometimes the
                    apoſtles; at one time he alludes to the converted Jews, at another time to the
                    converted Gentiles. 3. There is a third cauſe of obſcurity; he frequently
                    propoſes objections, and anſwers them without giving any formal intimation.
                    There are other difficulties, which ariſe from our uncertainty wſho are the
                    perſons he is addreſſing, and what are the particular opinions and practices to
                    which he refers. To theſe we may add two external cauſes, which have increaſed
                    the difficulty of underſtanding the epiſtles. 1. The dividing them into chapters
                    and verſes, which diſſolves the connection of the parts, and breaks them into
                    fragments. If Cicero’s epiſtles had been ſo disjointed, the reading of them
                    would be attended with leſs pleaſure and advantage, and with a great deal more
                    labour. 2. We are accuſtomed to the phraſeology of the epiſtles from our
                    infancy; but we have either no idea at all when we uſe it, or our idea of it is
                    derived from the articles or ſyſtem which we have eſpouſed. But as different
                    ſects have arbitrary definitions for St Paul’s phraſes, we ſhall never by
                    following them diſcover the meaning of St Paul, who certainly did not adjuſt his
                    phraſeology to any man’s ſyſtem.</p>
                <p>The beſt plan of ſtudying the epiſtles is that which was propoſed and executed by
                    Mr Locke. This we ſhall preſent to our readers in the words of that acute and
                    judicious author.</p>
                <p>“After I had found by long experience, that the reading of the text and comments
                    in the ordinary way proved not ſo ſucceſsful as I wiſhed to the end propoſed, I
                    began to ſuſpect that in reading a chapter as was uſual, and thereupon ſometimes
                    conſulting expoſitors upon ſome hard places of it, which at that time moſt
                    affected me, as relating to points then under conſideration in my own mind, or
                    in debate amongſt others, was not a right method to get into the true ſenſe of
                    theſe epiſtles. I ſaw plainly, after I began once to reflect on it, that if any
                    one ſhould write me a letter as long as St Paul’s to the Romans, concerning ſuch
                    a matter as that is, in a ſtyle as foreign, and expreſſions as dubious as his
                    ſeem to be, if I ſhould divide it into fifteen or ſixteen chapters, and read one
                    of them today, and another tomorrow, amp;c. it is ten to one I ſhould never come
                    to a full and clear comprehenſion of it. The way to underſtand the mind of him
                    that writ it, every one would agree, was to read the whole letter through from
                    one end to the other all at once, to ſee what was the main ſubject and tendency
                    of it: or if it had ſeveral views and purpoſes in it, not dependent one of
                    another, nor in a ſubordination to one chief aim and end, to diſcover what thoſe
                    different matters were, and where the author concluded one, and began another;
                    and if there were any neceſſity of dividing the epiſtle into parts, to make the
                    boundaries of them.</p>
                <p>“In the proſecution of this thought, I concluded it neceſſary, for the
                    underſtanding of any one of St Paul’s epiſtles, to read it all thro’ at one
                    fitting, and to obſerve as well as I could the drift and deſign of his writing
                    it. If the firſt reading gave me ſome light, the ſecond gave me more; and ſo I
                    perſiſted on reading conſtantly the whole epiſtle over at once till I came to
                    have a good general view of the apoſtle’s main purpoſe in writing the epiſtle,
                    the chief branches of his diſcourſe wherein he proſecuted it, the arguments he
                    uſed, and the diſpoſition of the whole.</p>
                <p>“This, I confeſs, is not to be obtained by one or two haſty readings; it muſt be
                    repeated again and again with a cloſe attention to the tenor of the diſcourſe,
                    and a perfect neglect of the diviſions into chapters and verſes. On the
                    contrary, the ſafeſt way is to ſuppoſe that the epiſtle has but one buſineſs and
                    one aim, till by a frequent peruſal of it you are forced to ſee there are
                    diſtinct independent matters in it, which will forwardly enough ſhow
                    themſelves.</p>
                <p>“It requires ſo much more pains, judgment, and application, to find the coherence
                    of obſcure and abſtruſe writings, and makes them ſo much the more unfit to ſerve
                    prejudice and preoccupation when found; that it is not to be wondered that St
                    Paul’s epiſtles have with many paſſed rather for disjointed, looſe, pious
                    diſcourſes, full of warmth and zeal, and overflows of light, rather than for
                    calm, ſtrong, coherent reaſonings, that carried a thread of argument and
                    conſiſtency all through them.”</p>
                <p>Mr Locke tells us he continued to read the ſame epiſtle over and over again till
                    he diſcovered the ſcope of the whole, and the different ſteps and arguments by
                    which the writer accompliſhes his purpoſe. For he was convinced before reading
                    his epiſtles, that Paul was a man of learning, of found ſenſe, and knew all the
                    doctrines of the goſpel by revelation. The ſpeeches recorded in the Acts of the
                    Apoſtles convinced this judicious critic that Paul was a cloſe and accurate
                    reaſoner: and therefore he concluded that his epiſtles would not be written in a
                    looſe, confuſed, incoherent ſtyle. Mr Locke accordingly followed the chain of
                    the apoſtle’s diſcourſe, obſerved his inferences, and carefully examined from
                    what premiſes they were drawn, till he obtained a general outline of any
                    particular epiſtle. If every divine would follow this method, he would ſoon
                    acquire ſuch a know-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0167.tif"

                    <hi rend="italic">ledge of Paul’s ſtyle and manner, that he would peruſe his
                        other Epiſtles with much greater eaſe.</hi></p>
                <p>That the Epiſtle to the Romans was written at Corinth by St Paul, is aſcertained
                    by the teſtimony of the ancient Chriſtians. It was compoſed in the year 58, in
                    the 24th year after Paul’s converſion, and is the ſeventh epiſtle which he
                    wrote. From the Acts of the Apoſtles we learn that it mu <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſt</hi> have been written within the ſpace of three months; for that was
                    the whole period of Paul’s reſidence in Greece, (Acts xx. 1, 2, 3.)</p>
                <p>The following analyſis of this epiſtle we have taken from a valuable little
                    treatiſe, intitled A Key to the New Teſtament, which was written by Dr Percy
                    biſhop of Dromore. It exhibits the intention of the apoſtle, and the arguments
                    which he uſes to prove his diſterent propoſitions, in the moſt conciſe,
                    diſtinct, and connected manner, and affords the be <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> t
                    view of this Epiſtle that we have ever ſeen.</p>
                <p>“The Chriſtian church at Rome appears not to have been planted by any apoſtle;
                    wherefore St Paul, left it ſhould be corrupted by the Jews, who then ſwarmed in
                    Rome, and of whom many were converted to Chriſtianity, <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>
                    ends them an abſtract of the principal truths of the goſpel, and endeavours to
                    guard them againſt thoſe erroneous notions which the Jews had of ju <hi
                        rend="italic">ſ</hi> tiſication, and of the election of their own
                    nation.</p>
                <p>“Now the Jews aſſigned three grounds for juſtification. Firſt, ‘The extraordinary
                    piety and merits of their anceſtors, and the covenant made by God with the <hi
                        rend="italic">ſ</hi> e holy men.’ They thought God could not hate the
                    children of ſuch meritorious parents: and as he had made a covenant with the
                    patriarchs to bleſs their poſterity, he was obliged thereby to pardon their <hi
                        rend="italic">ſ</hi> ins. Secondly, ‘A perfect knowledge and diligent ſtudy
                    of the law of Moſes.’ They made this a plea for the remiſſion of all their <hi
                        rend="italic">ſ</hi> ins and vices. Thirdly, ‘The works of the Eevitical
                    law,’ which were to expiate ſin, efpecially circumciſion and ſacrifices. Hence
                    they inferred that the Gentiles mu <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> t receive the whole
                    law of Moſes, in order to be ju <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> ified and ſaved.</p>
                <p>“The doctrine of the Jews concerning election was, ‘That as God had promiſed to
                    Abraham to bleſs his ſeed, to give him not only ſpiritual bleſſings, but alſo
                    the land of Canaan, to ſuffer him to dwell there in proſperity, and to conſider
                    him as his church upon earth;’ That therefore this bleſſing extended to their
                    whole nation, and that God was bound to fulfil theſe promi <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſ</hi> es to them, whether they were righteous or wicked, faithful or
                    unbelieving. They even believed that a prophet ought not to pronounce againſt
                    their nation the prophecies with which he was inſpired; but was rather to beg of
                    God to expunge his name out of the book of the living.</p>
                <p>“The <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> e previous remarks will <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>
                    erve as a key to unlock this difficult Epiſtle, of which we ſhall now give a <hi
                        rend="italic">ſ</hi> hort analyſis. See <hi rend="italic">Michaelis’s
                        Lectures on the New Testament.</hi></p>
                <p>“I. The Epiſtle begins with the u <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ual ſalutation with
                    which the Greeks began their letters, (chap. i. 1—7.)</p>
                <p>“II. St Paul profeſſes his joy at the flouriſhing ſtate of the church at Rome,
                    and his deſire to come and preach the goſpel (ver. 8— 19.): then he in <hi
                        rend="italic">ſ</hi> enſibly introduces the capital point he intended to
                    prove, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi></p>
                <p>"III. The <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ubject of the goſpel (ver. 16, 17.), that it
                    reveals a righteouſneſs unknown before, which is de</p>
                <p>rived ſolely from faith, and to which Jews and Gentiles have an equal claim.</p>
                <p>“IV. In order to prove this, he (<hi rend="italic">ſh</hi> ows (chap. i. 18.—
                    iii. 20.) that both Jews and Gentiles are ‘under <hi rend="italic">ſi</hi> n, i.
                        <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> that God will impute their ſins to Jews as well as
                    to Gentiles.</p>
                <p>“His arguments may be reduced to the <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> e ſyllogiſms (ch.
                    ii. I. 17—24.) I. ‘The wrath of God is revealed againſt thoſe who hold the truth
                    in unrighteouſ- neſs; <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> who acknowledge the truth,
                    and yet <hi rend="italic">ſin</hi> againſt it. 2. The Gentiles acknowledged
                    truths; but, partly by their idolatry, and partly by their other deteſtable
                    vices, they <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> inned againſt the truth they acknowdedged.
                    3. Therefore the wrath of God is revealed againſt the Gentiles, and puniſheth
                    them. 4. The Jews have acknowledged more truths than the Gentiles, and yet they
                    ſin. 5. Con <hi rend="italic">ſe</hi> quently the Jewiſh ſinners are yet more
                    expoſed to the wrath of God (ch. ii. 1 —12.) Having thus proved his point, he
                    anſwers certain objections to it. <hi rend="italic">Obj.</hi> 1. ‘The Jews were
                    well grounded in their knowledge, and ſtudied the law.’ He anſwers, If the
                    knowledge of the law, without obſerving it, could juſtify them, then God could
                    not have condemned the Gentiles, who knew the law by nature, (ch. ii. 13—16.)
                        <hi rend="italic">Obj.</hi> 2. ‘The Jews were circumciſed.’ <hi
                        rend="italic">Anſ.</hi> That is, ye are admitted by an outward ſign into the
                    covenant with God. This ſign will not avail you when ye violate that covenant
                    (ch. ii. 25. to the end). <hi rend="italic">Obj.</hi> 3. ‘According to this
                    doctrine of St Paul, the Jews have no advantage before others.’ <hi
                        rend="italic">Anſ.</hi> Yes, they ſtill have advantages; for unto them are
                    committed the oracles of God. But their privileges do not extend to this, that
                    God ſhould overlook their ſins, which, on the contrary, Scripture condemns even
                    in the Jews (ch. iii. 1 —19.) <hi rend="italic">Obj.</hi> 4. ‘They had the
                    Levitical law and ſacriſices.’ <hi rend="italic">Anſ.</hi> From hence is no
                    remiſſion, but only the knowledge of ſin, (ch. iii. 20.)</p>
                <p>“V. From all this St Paul concludes, that Jews and Gentiles may be juſtified by
                    the ſame means, namely, without the Levitical law, through faith in Chriſt: And
                    in oppoſition to the imaginary advantages of the Jews, he ſtates the declaration
                    of Zechariah, that God is the God of the Gentiles as well as of the Jews, (ch.
                    iii. 21. to the end.)</p>
                <p>“VI. As the whole bleſſing was promiſed to the faithful deſcendants of Abraham,
                    whom both Scripture and the Jews call his children, he proves his former
                    aſſertion from the example of Abraham; who was an idolater before his call, but
                    was declared ju <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> t by God, on account of his faith, long
                    before his circumciſion. Hence he takes occaſion to explain the nature and
                    fruits of faith, (ch. iv. 1. v. 11.)</p>
                <p>“VII. He goes on to prove from God’s juſtice, that the Jews had no advantages
                    over the Gentiles with re <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> pect to juſtification. Both
                    Jews and Gentiles had forfeited life and immortality, by the means of one common
                    father of their race, whom they them <hi rend="italic">ſe</hi> lves had not cho
                        <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> en. Now as God was willing to reſtore immortality
                    by a new ſpiritual head of a covenant, viz. Chriſt, it was juſt that both Jews
                    and Gentiles ſhould ſhare in this new repre <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> entative of
                    the whole race (ch. v. 12. to the end).—Chap. v. ver. 15, 16. amounts to this
                    negative queſtion, ‘Is it not fitting that the free gift ſhould extend as far as
                    the offence?'<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0168.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0162"/>
                    “VIII. He ſhows that the doctrine of juſtification,</p>
                <p>as ſtated by him, lays us under the ſtrongeſt obligations of holineſs, (ch. vi.
                    1. to the end.)</p>
                <p>“ IX. He ſhows that the law of Moſes no longer concerns us at all; for our
                    juſtiſication ariſes from our appearing in God’s <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ight,
                    as if actually dead with Chriſt on account of our <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ins;
                    but the law of Moſes was not given to the dead. On this occaſion he proves at
                    large, that the eternal power of God over us is not affected by this; and that
                    whilſt we are under the law of Moſes we perpetually become ſubject to death,
                    even by <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ins of inadvertency, (ch. vii. 1. to the
                    end.)</p>
                <p>“X. Hence he concludes, that all thoſe, and thoſe only, who are united with
                    Chriſt, and for the ſake of his union, do not live according to the fleſh, are
                    free from all condemnation of the law, and have an undoubted ſhare in eternal
                    life, (ch. viii. 1—17.)</p>
                <p>“XI. Having deſcribed their bleſſedneſs, he is aware that the Jews, who expected
                    a temporal happineſs, ſhould object to him, that Chriſtians notwithſtanding
                    endure much ſuffering in this world. He anſwers this objection at large, (ch.
                    viii. 18. to the end)</p>
                <p>“XII. He ſhows that God is not the leſs true and faithful, becauſe he doth not
                    juſtify, but rather rejects and puniſhes, thoſe Jews who would not believe the
                    Me <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi> iah, (ch. ix. x. xi. ) In diſcuſſing this point, we
                    may obſerve the cautious manner in which, on account of the Jewiſh prejudices,
                    he introduces it (ch. ix. I— <hi rend="italic">5.),</hi> as well as in the
                    diſcuſſion itſelf.</p>
                <p>“He ſhows that the promiſes of God were never made to all the poſterity of
                    Abraham, and that God always reſerved to himſelf the power of chooſing thole
                    ſons of Abraham whom, for Abraham’s ſake, he intended to bleſs, and of puniſhing
                    the wicked ſons of Abraham; and that with reſpect to temporal happineſs or
                    miſery, he was not even determined in his choice by their works. Thus he
                    rejected I <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> hmael, Eſau, the I <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>
                    raelites in the deſert in the time of Moſes, and the greater part of that people
                    in the time of l <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> aiah, making them a ſacrifice to his
                    juſtice, (ch. ix. 6—29.)</p>
                <p>“He then proceeds to ſhow that God had reaſon to reject mo <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſ</hi> t of the Jews then living, becauſe they would not believe in the
                    Meſſiah, though the goſpel had been preached to them plainly enough, (ch. ix.
                    30. x. to the end). However, that God had not rejected all his people, but was
                    ſtiſſ fulfilling his promiſe upon many thouſand natural de <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſc</hi> endants of Abraham, who believed in the Meſſiah, and would in a
                    future period fulfil them upon more; for that all Iſrael would be converted,
                    (ch. xi. 1—32.) And he concludes with admiring the wi <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> e
                    counſels of God, (ver. 33. to the end.)</p>
                <p>“XIII. From the doctrine hitherto laid down, and particularly from this, that God
                    has in mercy accepted the Gentiles; he argues, that the Romans ſhould conſecrate
                    and offer themſelves up wholly to God. This leads him to mention in particular
                    ſome Chriſtian duties, (ch. xii.), <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi></p>
                <p>“XIV. He exhorts them to be ſubject to magi <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> trates (ch.

                <p>“XVI. To abſtain from thoſe vices which were conſidered as things indifferent
                    among the Gentiles, (ver. 11. to the end.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“XVII. He exhorts the Jews and Gentiles in the Chriſtian church
                        to brotherly unity, (ch. xiv. 1. xv. 13.)</hi></p>
                <p>“XVIII. He concludes his Epiſtle with an excuſe for having ventured to admoniſh
                    the Romans, whom he had not converted; with an account of his journey to
                    Jeruſalem; and with ſome ſalutations to thoſe perſons whom he meant to recommend
                    to the church at Rome.” See <hi rend="italic">Michaelis's Lectures on the New
                        Testament.</hi></p>
                <p>Corinth was a wealthy and luxurious city, built upon the iſthmus which joins the
                    Morea to the northern parts of Greece. In this city Paul had ſpent two years
                    founding a Chriſtian church, which conſiſted of a mixture of Jews and Gentiles,
                    but the greater part Gentiles.</p>
                <p>About three years after the apoſtle had left Corinth, he wrote this Epiſtle from
                    Epheſus in the year 56 or 57, and in the beginning of Nero’s reign. That it was
                    written from Epheſus, appears from the ſalutation with which the Epiſtle cloſes,
                    (chap. xvi. 19.) “The churches of Aſia <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> alute you.
                    Aquila and Priſcilla ſalute you much in the Lord.” From the <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſ</hi> e words it is evident, in the 1 <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> t place,
                    that the Epiſtle was written in Aſia. 2dly, It appears from Acts xviii. 18, 19.
                    that Aquila and Priſcilla accompanied. Paul from Corinth to Epheſus, where they
                    ſeem to have continued till Paul’s departure.</p>
                <p>St Paul had certainly kept up a confiant intercourſe with the churches which he
                    had founded; for he was evidently acquainted with all their revolutions. They
                    ſeem to have applied to him for advice in thoſe difficult cafes which their own
                    underſtanding could not ſolve; and he was ready on all occaſions to correct
                    their miſtakes.</p>
                <p>This Epiſtle conſiſts of two parts. 1. A reproof for thoſe vices to which they
                    were moſt propen <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> e; 2. An anſwer to ſome queries which
                    they had propoſed to him.</p>
                <p>The Corinthians, like the other Greeks, had been accuſtomed to ſee their
                    philoſophers divide themſelves into different ſects; and as they brought along
                    with them into the Chriſtian church their former opinions and cuſtoms, they
                    wiſhed, as before, to arrange themſelves under different leaders. In this
                    Epiſtle Paul condemns theſe diviſions as inconſiſtent with the ſpirit of
                    Chriſtianity, which inculcates benevolence and unanimity, and as oppoſite to the
                    conduct of Chriſtian teachers, who did not, like the philoſophers, aſpire after
                    the praiſe of eloquence and wiſdom. They laid no claim to theſe nor to any
                    honour that cometh from men. The apoſtle declares, that the Chriſtian truths
                    were revealed from heaven; that they were taught with great plainneſs and <hi
                        rend="italic">ſi</hi> mplicity, and proved by the evidence of miracles,
                    (chap. i. 1 ). He diſſuades them from their diviſions and animoſities, by
                    reminding them of the great trial which every man’s work muſt undergo; of the
                    guilt they incurred by polluting the temple or church of God; of the vanity of
                    human wiſdom; and of glorying in men. He admoniſhes them to eſteem the teachers
                    of the goſpel only as the ſervants of Chriſt; and to remember that every
                    ſuperior advantage which they enjoyed was to be aſcribed to the goodneſs of God,
                    (chap. iii. 4).</p>
                <p>2. In the fifth chapter the apoſtle conſiders the ca <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> e
                    of a notorious offender, who had married his ſtepmo-<pb

                    tells them, that he ought to be excommunicated. He alſo exhorts the Chriſtians
                    not to a <hi rend="italic">ſſo</hi> ciate with any perſon who led ſuch an openly
                    profane life,</p>
                <p>3. He cenſures the Corinthians for their litigious diſpo <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſi</hi> tion, which cauſed them to proſecute their Chri <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſ</hi> tian brethren before the Heathen courts. He expre <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſſ</hi> es much warmth and ſurpriſe that they did not refer their
                    differences to their brethren; and concludes his exhortations on this ſubject,
                    by aſſuring them that they ought rather to allow themſelves to be defrauded than
                    to ſeek redreſs from Heathens (chap. v. 1—9).</p>
                <p>4. He inveighs againſt thoſe vices to which the Corinthians had been addicted
                    before their converſion, and eſpecially againſt fornication, the criminality of
                    which they did not fully perceive, as this vice was generally overlooked in the
                    ſy <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> tems of the philoſophers, (ch. vi. 10. to the
                    end).</p>
                <p>Having thus pointed out the public irregularities with which they were
                    chargeable, he next replies to certain queſtions which the Corinthians had
                    propoſed to him by letter. He, I. Determines ſome queſtions relating to the
                    marriage ſtate; as, 1 <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi>, Whether it was good to marry
                    under the exiſting circumſtances of the church? And, 2d, Whether they ſhould
                    withdraw from their partners if they continued unbelievers? (ch. vii).</p>
                <p>2. He inſtructs them how to act with reſpect to idol offerings. It could not be
                    unlawful in itſelf to eat the food which had been offered to idols; for the
                    conſecration of fleſh or wine to an idol did not make it the property of the
                    idol, an idol being nothing, and therefore incapable of property. But ſome
                    Corinthians thought it lawful to go to a feaſt in the idol temples, which at the
                    ſame time were places of reſort for lewdneſs, and to eat the ſacriſices whilſt
                    praiſes were ſung to the idol. This was publicly joining in the idolatry. He
                    even adviſes to abſtain from ſuch participation as was lawful, rather than give
                    offence to a weak brother; which he enforces by his own example, who had
                    abſtained from many lawful things, rather than prove a ſcandal to the goſpel,
                    (chap. viii. ix. x.)</p>
                <p>3. He anſwers a third query concerning the manner in which women ſhould deliver
                    any thing in public, when called to it by a divine impulſe. And here he cenſures
                    the unuſual dreſs of both ſexes in propheſying, which expoſed them to the
                    contempt of the Greeks, among whom the men uſually went uncovered and the women
                    veiled.</p>
                <p>Being thus led to the conſideration of the abuſes that prevailed in their public
                    worſhip, he goes on to cenſure the irregularities which were committed at their
                    love-feaſts, or, as we term them, the <hi rend="italic">Lord’s Supper.</hi> It
                    was a common practice with the Greeks at their <hi rend="italic">ſo</hi> cial
                    ſuppers for every man to bring his own proviſions along with him, not, however,
                    to ſhare them with the company, but to feaſt upon them in a ſolitary manner.
                    Thus the rich ate and drank to exceſs, while the poor were totally neglected.
                    The Corinthians introduced the ſame practice in the celebration of the Lord’s
                    Supper, thus confounding it with their ordinary meals, and without ever
                    examining into the end of the inſtitution. It was this groſs abuſe that Paul
                    reproves in the 11th chapter. He alſo cenſures their conduct in the exerciſe of
                    the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; he <hi rend="italic">ſh</hi> ows them
                    they all proceeded from the ſame ſpirit, and</p>
                <p>were intended for the inſtruction of Chriſtian <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ocieties;
                    that all Chriſtians ought to be united in mutual love; and that tenderneſs ought
                    to be ſhown to the moſt incon <hi rend="italic">ſi</hi> derable member, as every
                    one is ſubſervient to the good of the whole (chap. xii). In the 13th chapter he
                    gives a beautiful deſcription of benevolence, which has been much and juſtly
                    admired. He repreſents it as ſuperior to the ſupernatural gifts of the ſpirit,
                    to the moſt exalted genius, to univerſal knowledge, and even to faith. In the
                    14th chapter he cautions the Corinthians againſt oſtentation in the exerci <hi
                        rend="italic">ſ</hi> e of the gift of languages, and gives them proper
                    advices.</p>
                <p>4. He a <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi> erts the reſurrection of the dead, in
                    oppoſition to ſome of the Corinthians who denied it, founding it upon the
                    reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, which he conſiders as one of the moſt effential
                    doctrines of Chriſtianity. He then anſwers ſome objections to the reſurrection,
                    drawn from our not being capable of under <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> anding how
                    it will be accompliſhed, (chap, xv.) He then concludes with ſome directions to
                    the Corinthian church concerning the manner of collecting alms; promiſes them a
                    viſit, and ſalutes ſome of the members.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ſe</hi> cond Epiſtle to the Corinthians was written from
                    Macedonia in the year 57, about a year after the former. See 2 Cor. ix. 1—5.
                    viii. and xiii. 1.</p>
                <p>St Paul’s firſt Epiſtle had wrought different effects among the Corinthians: many
                    of them examined their conduct; they excommunicated the inceſtuous man;
                    requeſted St Paul’s return with tears; and vindicated him and his office againſt
                    the falſe teacher and his adherents. Others of them <hi rend="italic">ſti</hi>
                    ll adhered to that adversary of St Paul, expreſsly denied his apoſtolic office,
                    and even furniſhed themſelves with pretended arguments from that Epiſtle. He had
                    formerly promiſed to take a journey from Epheſus to Corinth, thence to viſit the
                    Macedonians, and return from them to Corinth (2 Cor. i. 15, 16). But the unhappy
                    ſtate of the Corinthian church made him alter his intention (verſe 23.), ſince
                    he found he muſt have treated them with ſeverity. Hence his adversaries partly
                    argued, 1. That St Paul was irreſolute and unſteady, and therefore could not be
                    a prophet: 2. The improbability of his ever coming to Corinth again, ſince he
                    was afraid of them. Such was the ſtate of the Corinthian church when St Paul,
                    after his departure from Epheſus, having vi <hi rend="italic">ſi</hi> ted
                    Macedonia, (Acts XX. 1.) received an account of the above particulars from Titus
                    (2 Cor. vii. 5,6.), and therefore wrote them his ſecond Epiſtle about the end of
                    the ſame year, or the beginning of 58.</p>
                <p>But to give a more di <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> inct view of the contents of this
                    Epiſtle:</p>
                <p>1. The apoſtle, after a general ſalutation, expre <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi> es
                    his grateful ſenſe of the divine goodneſs; profeſſing his confidence in God,
                    ſupported by a ſenſe of his own integrity; makes an apology for not having
                    viſited the Corinthians as he had intended, and vindicates himſelf from the
                    charge of ſickleneſs, (chap. i).</p>
                <p>2.He ſorgives the inceſtuous man, whoſe conduct had made ſo deep an impreſſiou on
                    the apoſtle’s mind, that one reaſon why he had deferred his journey to Corinth
                    was, that he might not meet them in grief, nor till he had received advice of
                    the effect of his apoſtolical admonitions. He mentions his anxiety to meet Titus
                    at Troas, in order to hear of their welfare; expreſſes<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0170.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0164"/> his
                    thankfulneſs to God for the ſucceſs attending his miniſtry, and ſpeaks of the
                    Corinthians as his credentials, written by the finger of God, (chap. ii. iii. 1—
                    6.)</p>
                <p>3. He treats of the office committed to him of preaching the redemption; and
                    highly prefers it to preaching the law: to which probably his adverſaries had
                    made great pretences. They had ridiculed his ſufferings; which he ſhows to be no
                    diſgrace to the goſpel or its miniſters; and here he gives a ſhort abſtract of
                    the doctrine he preaches, (chap. iii. 6. v. to the end).</p>
                <p>He expatiates with great copiouſneſs on the temper with which, in the mid <hi
                        rend="italic">ſ</hi> t of afflictions and perſecuticns, he and his brethren
                    executed their important embaſſy; and with great affection, and tenderneſs he
                    exhorts them to avoid the pollution of idolatry, (chap. vi). He endeavours to
                    win their confidence, by telling them how much he rejoiced in their amendment
                    and welfare, and how ſorry he had been for the diſtreſs which his neceſſafy
                    reproofs had occaſioned, (chap. vii). He then exhorts them to make liberal
                    contributions for the Chri <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> ians in Judaea. He
                    recommends to them the example of the Macedonians, and reminds them of the
                    benevolence of the Lord Jeſus. He expreſſes his joy for the readineſs of Titus
                    to aſſiſt in making the collection; and makes al <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> o
                    honourable mention of other Chriſtian brethren, whom he had joined with Titus in
                    the fame commiſſion, (chap. viii). He then, with admirable addicts, urges a
                    liberal contribution, and recommends them to the divine bleſſing, (chap.
                    ix).</p>
                <p>4. Next he obviates ſome reflections which had been thrown upon him for the
                    mildneſs of his conduct, as if it had proceeded from fear. He aſſerts his
                    apoſtolical power and authority, cautioning his opponents againſt urging him to
                    give too ſenſible demonſtrations of it, (chap. x). He vindicates himſelf againſt
                    the inſinuations of ſome of the Corinthians, particularly for having declined
                    pecuniary ſupport from the church; an action which had been ungenerouſly turned
                    to his diſadvantage. To ſhow his ſuperiority over thoſe deſigning men who had
                    oppoſed his preaching, he enumerates his ſufferings; gives a detail of ſome
                    extraordinary revelations which he had received; and vindicates himſelf from the
                    charge of boaſting, by declaring that he had been forced to it by the deſire of
                    ſupporting his apoſtolical character, (chap. xi. xii.) He cloſes the Epiſtle, by
                    aſſuring them with great tenderneſs how much it would grieve him to demonſtrate
                    his divine commiſſion by ſeverer methods.</p>
                <p>The Galatians were deſcended from thoſe Gauls who had formerly invaded Greece,
                    and afterwards ſettled in Lower Aſia. St Paul had preached the goſpel among them
                    in the year 51, ſoon after the council held at Jeruſalem, (Acts xvi. 6). Aſia
                    ſwarmed at that time with zealots for the law of Moſes, who wanted to impoſe it
                    upon the Gentiles, (Acts xv. 1). Soon after St Paul had left the Galatians,
                    theſe falſe teachers had got among them, and wanted them to be circumciſed,
                    amp;c. This occaſioned the following Epiſtle, which Michaelis thinks was written
                    in the <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ame year, before St Paul left Theſſalonica. Dr
                    Lardner dates it about the end of the year 52, or in the very beginning of 53,
                    before St Paul <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> et out to go to Jeruſalem by way of Ephe
                        <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> us.</p>
                <p>The ſubject of this Epiſtle is much the ſame with that of the Epiſtle to the
                    Romans; only this queſtion is more fully conſidered here, “Whether circumciſion,
                    and an obſervance of the Levitical law, be neceſſary to the ſalvation of a
                    Chriſtian convert?” It appears, theſe Judaizing Chriſtians, whoſe indirect views
                    St Paul expoſes (Acts xv. 1. Gal. v. 3, 9.), at firſt only repreſented
                    circumciſion as neceſſary to ſalvation; but afterwards they in <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſiſt</hi> ed upon the Chriſtians receiving the Jewiſh feſtivals, (Gal. iv.
                    10).</p>
                <p>As St Paul had founded the churches of Galatia, and inſtructed them in the
                    Chriſtian religion, he does not ſet before them its principal doctrines, as he
                    had done in the Epiſtle to the Romans; but referring them to what he had already
                    taught (chap. i. 8, 9.), he proceeds at once to the ſubject of the Epiſtle.</p>
                <p>As it appears from ſeveral paſſages of this Epiſtle, particularly chap. i. 7, 8,
                    10. and chap. v. 11. that the Judaizing Chriſtians had endeavoured to perſuade
                    the Galatians that Paul himſelf had changed his opinion, and now preached up the
                    Levitical law; he denies that charge, and affirms that the doctrines which he
                    had taught were true, for he had received them from God by immediate revelation.
                    He relates his miraculous converſion; aſſerts his apoſtolical authority, which
                    had been acknowledged by the diſciples of Jeſus; and, as a proof that he had
                    never inculcated a compliance with the Moſaic law, he declares that he had
                    oppoſed Peter at Antioch for yielding to the prejudices of the Jews.</p>
                <p>Having now vindicated his character from the ſuſpicion of <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſi</hi> ckleneſs, and ſhown that his commiſſion was divine, he argues that
                    the Galatians ought not to ſubmit to the law of Moſes: 1. Becauſe they had
                    received the Holy Ghoſt and the gifts of miracles, not by the law, but by the
                    goſpel, (chap. iii. 1—5).</p>
                <p>2. Becauſe the promiſes which God made to Abraham were not reſtricted to his
                    circumciſed deſcendants, but extended to all who are his children by faith,
                    (chap. iii. 6—18). In anſwer to the objection, <hi rend="italic">To what then
                        ſerveth the law?</hi> he replies, That it was given becauſe of
                    tranſgreſſion; that is, to preſerve them from idolatry till the Meſſiah himſelf
                    ſhould come. 3. Becauſe all men, whether Jews or Gentiles, are made the children
                    of God by faith, or by receiving the Chriſtian religion, and therefore do not
                    ſtand in need of circumciſion, (ch. iii. 26—29.) From the 1 <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſ</hi> t verſe of chapter iv. to the 11th, he argues that the law was
                    temporary, being only fitted for a ſtate of infancy; but that the world, having
                    attained a ſtate of manhood under the Meſſiah, the law was of no farther uſe. In
                    the remaining part of chap. iv. he reminds them of their former affection to
                    him, and aſſures them that he was ſtill their ſincere friend. He exhorts them to
                    ſtand faſt in the liberty with which Chriſt had made them free; for the ſons of
                    Agar, that is, thoſe under the law given at Mount Sinai, are in bondage, and to
                    be caſt out; the inheritance being deſigned for thole only who are the free-born
                    ſons of God under the ſpiritual covenant of the goſpel.</p>
                <p>The apoſtle next confutes the lalle report which had been ſpread abroad among the
                    Galatians, that Paul himſelf preached up circumciſion. He had already indirectly
                    refuted this calumny by the particular account which he gave of his life; but he
                    now directly and openly contradicts it in the following manner:<pb

                    taught ſuch falſe doctrines by him, (ver. 7, 8).</p>
                <p>4. By inſinuating that they ſhould paſs ſome cenſure on thoſe who miſled them
                    (ver. 9, 10.), by declaring that he was perſecuted for oppoſing the circumciſion
                    of the Chriſtians, (ver. 11).</p>
                <p>5. By expreſſing a wiſh that thoſe perſons ſhould be cut off who troubled them
                    with his doctrine.</p>
                <p>This Epiſtle affords a fine inſtance of Paul’s ſkill in managing an argument. The
                    chief objection which the advocates for the Moſaic law had urged againſt him
                    was, that he himſelf preached circumciſion. In the beginning of the Epiſtle he
                    overturns this ſlander by a ſtatement of facts, without taking any expreſs
                    notice of it; but at the end fully refutes it, that it might leave a ſtrong and
                    laſting impre <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi> ion upon their minds.</p>
                <p>He next cautions them againſt an idea which his arguments for Chriſtian liberty
                    might excite, that it conſiſted in licentiouſnefs. He ſhows them it does not
                    conſiſt in gratifying vicious de <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ires; for none are
                    under ſtronger obligations to moral duties than the Chriſtian. He recommends
                    gentleneſs and meekneſs to the weak (chap. vi 1—5), and exhorts them to be
                    liberal to their teachers, and unto all men (ver. 6 — 10). He concludes with
                    expofing the falſe pretences of the Judaizing teachers, and aſſerting the
                    integrity of his own conduct.</p>
                <p>Epheſus was the chief city of all Aſia on this <hi rend="italic">ſi</hi> de Mount
                    Taurus. St Paul had paſſed through it in the year 54, but without making any <hi
                        rend="italic">ſt</hi> ay, (Acts xviii. 19— 21). The following year he
                    returned to Epheſus again, and ſtaid there three years, (chap. xix.) During his
                    abode there he completed a very flouriſhing church of Chriſtians, the firſt
                    foundations of which had been laid by ſome inferior teachers. As Epheſus was
                    frequented by perſons of diſtinction from all parts of Aſia Minor, St Paul took
                    the opportunity of preaching in the ancient countries (ver. 10.); and the other
                    churches of Aſia were conſidered as the daughters of the church of Epheſus; ſo
                    that an Epiſtle to the Epheſians was, in effect, an epiſtle to the other
                    churches of Aſia at the <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ame time.</p>
                <p>Dr Lardner ſhows it to be highly probable that this Epiſtle was written in the
                    year 61, ſoon after Paul’s arrival at Rome.</p>
                <p>As Paul was in a peculiar manner the apoſtle of the Gentiles, and was now a
                    priſoner at Rome in conſequence of having provoked the Jews, by aſſerting that
                    an obſervance of the Moſaic law was not neceſſary to obtain the favour of God,
                    he was afraid left an advantage ſhould be taken of his confinement to unſettle
                    the minds of thoſe whom he had converted. Hearing that the Epheſians ſtood firm
                    in the faith of Chriſt, without ſubmitting to the law of Moſes, he writes this
                    Epiſtle to give them more exalted views of the love of God, and of the
                    excellence and dignity of Chriſt. This Epiſtle is pot compoſed in an
                    argumentative or didactic <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> yle: The firſt three
                    chapters conſiſt almoſt entirely of thanks</p>
                <p>givings and prayers, or glowing deſcriptions of the bleſſings of the Chriſtian
                    religion. This circumſtance renders them a little obſcure; but by the aſſiſtance
                    of the two following epiſtles, which were written on the fame occaſion, and with
                    the ſame deſign, the meaning of the apoſtle may be eaſily diſcovered. The laſt
                    three chapters contain practical exhortations. He firſt inculcates unity, love,
                    and concord, from the conſideration that all Chriſtians are members of the ſame
                    body, of which Chriſt is the head. He then adviſes them to forſake the vices to
                    which they had been addicted while they remained heathens. He recommends juſtice
                    and charity; ſtrenuouſly condemns lewdneſs, obſcenity, and intemperance, vices
                    which ſeem to have been too common among the Epeh <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ians.
                    In the 6th chapter he points out the duties which ariſe from the relations of
                    huſhands and wives, parents and children, maſters and ſervants; and concludes
                    with ſtrong exhortations to fortitude, which he deſcribes in an allegorical
                    manner.</p>
                <p>The church at Philippi had been founded by Paul, Silas, and Timothy (Acts xvi.),
                    in the year 51, and had continued to ſhow a ſtrong and manly attachment to the
                    Chriſtian religion, and a tender affection for the apoſtle. Hearing of his
                    impriſonment at Rome, they ſent Epaphroditus, one of their paſtors, to <hi
                        rend="italic">ſ</hi> upply him with money. It appears from this Epiſtle that
                    he was in great want of neceſſaries before this contribution arrived; for as he
                    had not converted the Romans, he did not conſider himſelf as intitled to receive
                    ſupplies from them. Being a priſoner, he could not work as formerly; and it was
                    a maxim of his never to accept any pecuniary aſſiſtance from thoſe churches
                    where a faction had been railed againſt him. From the Philippians he was not
                    averſe to receive a preſent in the time of want, becauſe he conſidered it as a
                    mark of their affection, and becauſe he was affured that they had conducted
                    themſelves as ſincere Chriſtians.</p>
                <p>It appears from the apoſtle’s own words, that this letter was written while he
                    was a priſoner at Rome, (chap i. 7, 13.iv. 22.); and from the expectation which
                    he diſcovers (chap. ii. 24.) of being ſoon releaſed and reſtored to them,
                    compared with Philemon v. 22. and Heb. xiii. 13. where he expreſſes a like
                    expectation in ſtronger terms, it is probable that this Epiſtle was written
                    towards the end of his firſt impriſonment in the year 62.</p>
                <p>The apoſtle’s deſign in this Epiſtle, which is quite of the practical kind, ſeems
                    to be, “to comfort the Philippians under the concern they had expreſſed at the
                    news of his impriſonment; to check a party-ſpirit that appears to have broke out
                    among them, and to promote, on the contrary, an entire union and harmony of
                    affection; to guard them againſt being ſeduced from the purity of the Chriſtian
                    faith by Judaizing teachers; to ſupport them under the trials with which they
                    ſtruggled; and, above all, to inſpire them with a concern to adorn their
                    profeſſion by the moſt eminent attainments in the divine life.” After ſome
                    particular admonitions in the beginning of the 4th chapter, he proceeds in the
                    8th verſe to recommend virtue in the moſt extenſive ſenſe, mentioning all the
                    different foundations in which it had been placed by the Grecian philoſophers.
                    Towards the cloſe of the Epiſtle, he makes his acknowledgments to the
                    Philippians ſor the ſeaſonable and libe-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0172.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0166"/> ral ſupply which they had ſent him, as it was ſo
                    convincing a proof of their affection for him, and their concern for the ſupport
                    of the goſpel, which he preferred far above any private <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>
                    ecular intereſt of his own; expreſsly diſclaiming all ſelfiſh, mercenary views,
                    and aſſuring them with a noble ſimplicity, that he was able upon all occaſions
                    to accommodate his temper to his circumſtances; and had learned, under the
                    teachings of Divine grace, in whatever Ration Providence might ſee fit to place
                    him, therewith to be content. After which, the apoſtle, having encouraged them
                    to expect a rich ſupply of all their wants from their God and Father, to whom he
                    devoutly aſcribes the honour of all, concludes with ſalutations from himſelf and
                    his friends at Rome to the whole church, and a ſolemn benediction, (verſe 10. to
                    the end); and declares, that he rejoiced in their liberality chiefly on their
                    own account.</p>
                <p>The Epiſtle to the Coloſſians was written while Paul was in priſon (chap. iv.
                    3.), and was therefore probably compoſed in the year 62. The intention of the
                    apoſtle, as far as can be gathered from the Epiſtle itſelf, was to ſecure the
                    Coloſſians from the influence of ſome doctrines that were ſubverſive of
                    Chriſtianity, and to excite them to a temper and behaviour worthy of their <hi
                        rend="italic">ſa</hi> cred character. A new ſect had ariſen, which had
                    blended the oriental philoſophy with the ſuperſtitious opinions of the Jews.</p>
                <p>They held, 1. That God was ſurrounded by demons or angels, who were mediators
                    with God, and therefore to be worſhipped. 2. That the foul is defiled by the
                    body; that all bodily enjoyments hurt the <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> oul, which
                    they believed to be immortal, though they ſeem to have denied the reſurrection
                    of the body, as it would only render the ſoul ſinful by being reunited to
                        it.<note anchored="false" n="129" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Percy's Key to the New Testament.</p></note>. That there was a great my
                        <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> ery in numbers, particularly in the number ſeven;
                    they therefore attributed a natural holineſs to the ſeventh or Sabbath day,
                    which they obſerved more ſtrictly than the other Jews. They ſpent their time
                    moſtly in contemplation; abſtained from marriage, and every gratification of the
                    ſenſes; uſed wa <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> hings, and thought it ſinful to touch
                    certain things; regarded wine as poiſon, amp;c.</p>
                <p>The arguments againſt theſe doctrines are managed with great skill and addreſs.
                    He begins with expreſſing great joy for the favourable character which he had
                    heard of them, and aſſures them that he daily prayed for their farther
                    improvement. Then he makes a ſhort digre <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ſion, in order
                    to deſcribe the dignity of Jeſus Chriſt; declares that he had created all
                    things, whether thrones or dominions, principalities and powers; that he alone
                    was the head of the church, and had reconciled men to the Father. The inference
                    from this deſcription is evident, that Jeſus was ſuperior to angels; that they
                    were created beings, and ought not to be worſhipped. Thus he indirectly confutes
                    one doctrine before he formally oppoſes it. Paul now returns from his digreſſion
                    in the 21ſt verſe to the ſentiments with which he had introduced it in the 13th
                    and 14th verſes, and again expreſſes his joy that the Philippians remained
                    attached to the goſpel, which was to be preached to the Gentiles, without the
                    reſtraints of the ceremonial law. Here again he ſtates a general doctrine, which
                    was inconſiſtent with the opinions of thoſe who were zealous for the law of
                    Moſes; but he leaves the Coloſſians to draw the inference, (chap, i.)</p>
                <p>Having again aſſured them of his tender concern for their welfare, for their
                    advancement in virtue, and that they might acknowledge the myſtery of God, that
                    is, that the goſpel was to ſuperſede the law of Moſes, he proceeds directly to
                    caution them againſt the philoſophy of the new teachers, and their ſuperſtitious
                    adherence to the law; ſhows the ſuperiority of Chriſt to the angels, and warns
                    Chriſtians againſt wor <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> hipping them. He cenſures the
                    obſervation of Sabbaths, and rebukes thoſe who required abſtinence from certain
                    kinds of food, and cautions them againſt per <hi rend="italic">ſo</hi> ns who a
                        <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi> ume a great appearance of wiſdom and virtue,
                    (chap, ii.)</p>
                <p>In the 3d chapter he exhorts them, that, inſtead of being occupied about external
                    ceremonies, they ought to cultivate pure morality. He particularly guards them
                    againſt impurity, to which they had before their converſion been much addicted.
                    He admoniſhes them againſt indulging the iraſcible paſſions, and againſt
                    committing falſehood. He exhorts them to cultivate the benevolent affections,
                    and humility, and patience. He recommends alſo the relative duties between
                    huſbands and wives, parents and children, ma <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> ers and
                    ſervants. He enjoins the duties of prayer and thankſgiving (ch. iv. 2.), and
                    requeſts them to remember him in their petitions. He enjoins affability and mild
                    behaviour to the unconverted heathens (verſe 6th); and concludes the Epiſtle
                    with matters which are all of a private nature, except the directions for
                    reading this Epiſtle in the church of Laodicea, as well as in the church of
                    Coloſſe.</p>
                <p>This Epiſtle is addreſſed to the inhabitants of The <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi>
                    alonica, the capital of Macedonia, a large and populous city. It appears from
                    the Acts, chapter xvii. 1. that the Chriſtian religion was introduced into this
                    city by Paul and Silas, ſoon after they had left Philippi. At firſt they made
                    many converts; but at length the Jews, ever jealous of the admiſſion of the
                    Gentiles to the <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ame privileges with themſelves, <hi
                        rend="italic">ſt</hi> irred up the rabble, which aſſaulted the houſe where
                    the apoſtle and his friends lodged; ſo that Paul and Silas were obliged to flee
                    to Berea, where their ſucceſs was ſoon interrupted by the ſame reſtleſs and
                    implacable enemies. The apoſtle then withdrew to Athens; and Timothy, at his
                    deſire, returned to Theſſalonica (1 Theſſi iii. 2.) to ſee what were the
                    ſentiments and behaviour of the inhabitants after the perſecution of the Jews.
                    From Athens Paul went to Corinth, where he <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> ayed a year
                    and <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ix months; during which, Timothy returned with the
                    joyful tidings, that the The <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi> alonians remained
                    ſtedfaſt to the faith, and firmly attached to the apoſtle, notwithſtanding his
                    flight. Upon this he ſent them this Epiſtle, A. D. 52, in the 12th year of
                    Claudius.</p>
                <p>This is generally reckoned the firſt Epiſtle which Paul wrote; and we find he was
                    anxious that it <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> hould be read to all the Chriſtians. In
                    chap. v. 27. he uſes theſe words; “I adjure you by the Lord, that this Epiſtle
                    be read unto all the holy brethren.” This direction is very properly inſerted in
                    his firſt Epiſtle.</p>
                <p>The intention of Paul in writing this Epiſtle was evidently to encourage the The
                        <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi> alonians to adhere to the Chriſtian religion. This
                    church being <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> ill in its infancy, and oppreffed by the
                    powerful Jews, required to be eſtabli <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> hed in the faith.
                    St Paul, therefore, in the three firſt chapters, endeavours to convince the
                    Theſſalonians of the truth and divinity of his goſpel, both by<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0173.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0167"/> the
                    miraculous gifts of the Holy Ghoſt which had been imparted, and by his own
                    conduct when among them.</p>
                <p>While he appeals, in the firſt chapter, to the miraculous gifts of the Holy
                    Spirit, he is very liberal in his commendations. He vindicates himſelf from the
                    charge of timidity, probably to prevent the Theſſalopians from forming an
                    unfavourable opinion of his fortitude, which his flight might have excited. He
                    aſ <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> erts, that he was not influenced by ſelfiſh or
                    diſhonourable motives, but that he was anxious to pleaſe God and not man. He
                    expreſſes a ſtrong affection for them, and how anxious he was to impart the
                    bleſſings of the goſpel. He congratulates himſelf upon his ſucceſs; mentions it
                    to their honour that they received the go <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> pel as the
                    word of God and not of man, and therefore did not renounce it when perſecution
                    was raiſed by the Jews. He expreffes a ſtrong de <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> ire to
                    viſit the The <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi> alonians; and aſſures them he had been
                    hitherto retained againſt his will.</p>
                <p>As a farther proof of his regard, the apoſtle informs them, that when he came to
                    Athens, he was ſo much concerned, leſt, being diſcouraged by his ſufferings,
                    they ſhould be tempted to ca <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> off their profeſſion,
                    that he could not forbear ſending Timothy to comfort and <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſt</hi> rengthen them; and expreſſes, in very ſtrong terms, the ſenſible
                    pleaſure he felt, in the midſt of all his afflictions, from the favourable
                    account he received of their faith and love; to which he adds, that he was
                    continually praying for their farther eſtabli <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> hment in
                    religion, and for an opportunity of making them another viſit, in order to
                    promote their edification, which lay ſo near his heart, (chap. iii.
                    throughout.)</p>
                <p>Having now ſhown his paternal affection for them, with great addreſs he improves
                    all that influence which his zeal and fidelity in their ſervice mu <hi
                        rend="italic">ſt</hi> naturally have given him to inculcate upon them the
                    precepts of the goſpel. He recommends chaſtity, in oppoſition to the prevailing
                    practice of the heathens; juſtice, in oppoſition to fraud. He praiſes their
                    benevolence, and encourages them to cultivate higher degrees of it. He
                    recommends induſtry and prudent behaviour to their heathen neighbours. In order
                    to comfort them under the loſs of their friends, he aſſures them that thoſe who
                    were fallen aſleep in Jeſus ſhould be raiſed again at the laſt day, and ſhould,
                    together with thoſe who remained alive, be caught up to meet their Lord, and
                    ſhare his triumph, (chap. iv.) He admoni <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> hes them to
                    prepare for this ſolemn event, that it might not come upon them unawares; and
                    then concludes the Epiſtle with various exhortations.</p>
                <p>The ſecond Epiſtle to the Theffalonians appears to have been written ſoon after
                    the firſt, and from the ſame place; for Silvanus or Silas, and Timothy, are
                    joined together with the apoſtle in the inſcriptions of this Epiſtle, as well as
                    of the former.</p>
                <p>The apoſtle begins with commending the faith and charity of the Theſſalonians, of
                    which he had heard a favourable report. he expreſſes great joy on account of the
                    patience with which they <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> upported perſecution; and ob
                        <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> erves that their persecution was a proof of a</p>
                <p>righteous judgment to come, where their perſecutors would meet with their proper
                    recompenſe, and the righteous be delivered out of all their afflictions. He
                    aſſures them of his con <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> ant prayers for their farther
                    improvement, in order to attain the felicity that was promi <hi rend="italic"

                <p>From miſunderſtanding a paſſage in his former letter, it appears that the
                    Theſſalonians believed the day of judgment was at hand. To rectify this miſtake,
                    he informs them that the day of the Lord will not come till a great apoſtacy has
                    overſpread the Chriſtian world, the nature of which he deſcribes<note

                                rend="smallcaps">(g)</hi> For an explanation of this prophecy, Dr
                            Hurd’s Sermons may be conſulted. He applies it to the papal power, to
                            which it correſponds with aſtoniſhing exactneſs.</p></note>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(g).</hi> Symptoms of this my!tery of iniquity had then
                    appeared; but the apoſtle expreſſes his thankfulneſs to God that the
                    Theſſalonians had eſcaped this corruption. He exhorts them to <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſteadfastnes</hi> s, and prays that God would comfort and <hi rend="italic"
                        >ſt</hi> rengthen them, (chap. ii.).</p>
                <p>He requeſts the prayers of the Theſſalonians for him and his two aſſiſtants, at
                    the ſame time expreſſing his confidence that they would pay due regard to the
                    inſtructions which he had given them. He then proceeds to correct ſome
                    irregularities. Many of the Theſſalonians ſeem to have led an idle diſorderly
                    life; theſe he ſeverely reproves, and commands the faithful to ſhun their
                    company if they ſtill remained incorrigible.</p>
                <p>When the firſt Epiſtle to Timothy was written, it is difficult to aſcertain.
                    Lardner dates it in 56; Mill, Whitby, and Macknight, place it in 64; but the
                    arguments on which each party founds their opinion are too long to inſert
                    here.</p>
                <p>Timothy was the intimate friend and companion of Paul, and is always mentioned by
                    that apoſtle with much affection and e <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> eem. Having
                    appointed him to ſuperintend the church of Epheſus during a journey which he
                    made to Macedonia, he wrote this letter, in order to direct him how to diſcharge
                    the important truſt which was committed to him. This was the more neceſſary, as
                    Timothy was young and unexperienced, (1 Tim. iv. 12.) In the beginning of the
                    Epiſtle he reminds him of the charge with which he had intruſted him, to wit, to
                    pre <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi> erve the purity of the goſpel againſt the
                    pernicious doctrines of the Judaizing teachers, whoſe opinions led to frivolous
                    controverſies, and not to a good life. He ſhows the uſe of the law of Moſes, of
                    which theſe teachers were ignorant. This account of the law, he aſſures Timothy,
                    was agreeable to the repreſentation of it in the goſpel, with the preaching of
                    which he was intruſted. He then makes a digreſſion, in the fulneſs of his heart,
                    to expreſs the ſenſe which he felt of the goodneſs of God towards him.</p>
                <p>In the ſecond chapter the apoſtle preſcribes the manner in which the worſhip of
                    God was to be performed in the church of Epheſus; and in the third explains the
                    qualifications of the perſons whom he was to ordain as biſhops and deacons. In
                    the fourth chapter he foretels the great corruptions of the church which were to
                    prevail in future times, and in <hi rend="italic">ſt</hi> ructs him how to
                    ſupport the ſacred character. In the fifth chapter<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0174.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0168"/> he teaches
                    Timothy how to admoniſh the old and young of both ſexes; mentions the age and
                    character of ſuch widows as were to be employed by the ſociety in ſome peculiar
                    office; and ſubjoins ſome things concerning the reſpect due to elders. In the
                    ſixth chapter he deſcribes the duties which Timothy was to inculcate on ſlaves;
                    condemns trifling controverſies and pernicious diſputes; cenſures the exceſſive
                    love of money, and charges the rich to be rich in good works.</p>
                <p>That the ſecond Epiſtle to Timothy was written from Rome is univerſally agreed;
                    but whether it was during his firſt or ſecond impriſonment has been much
                    diſputed That Timothy was at Epheſus or in Aſia Minor when this Epiſtle was ſent
                    to him, appears from the frequent mention in it of perſons reſiding at Epheſus.
                    The apoſtle ſeems to have intended to prepare Timothy for thoſe ſufferings which
                    he foreſaw he would be expoſed to. He exhorts him to conſtancy and perſeverance,
                    and to perform with a good conſcience the duties of the ſacred function.</p>
                <p>The falſe teachers, who had before thrown this church into confuſion, grew every
                    day worſe: inſomuch that not only Hymenaeus, but Philetus, another Epheſian
                    heretic, now denied the reſurrection of the dead. They were led into this error
                    by a diſpute about words. At firſt they only annexed various improper
                    ſignifications to the word <hi rend="italic">reſurrection</hi>, but at laſt they
                    denied it altogether<note anchored="true" n="131" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(h)</hi> This is by no means
                            uncommon amongſt men; to begin to diſpute about the ſigniſication of
                            words, and to be led gradually to deny the thing ſignified. This appears
                            to have been the cauſe of moſt diſputes, and the general beginnings of
                            ſcepticiſm and infidelity.</p></note> (H); pretending that the
                    reſurrection of the dead was only a reſurrection from the death of ſin, and ſo
                    was already paſt. This error was probably derived from the eaſtern philoſophy,
                    which placed the origin of ſin in the body, (chapter ii.) He then forewarns him
                    of the fatal apoſtacy and declenſion that was beginning to appear in the church;
                    and at the ſame time animates him, from his own example and the great motives of
                    Chriſtianity, to the moſt vigorous and reſolute diſcharge of every part of the
                    miniſterial office.</p>
                <p>This Epiſtle is addreſſed to Titus, whom Paul had appointed to preſide over the
                    church of Crete. It is difficult to determine either its date or the place from
                    which it was ſent. The apoſtle begins with reminding Titus of the reaſons for
                    which he had left him at Crete; and directs him on what principles he was to act
                    in ordaining Chriſtian paſtors: the qualifications of whom he particularly
                    deſcribes. To ſhow him how cautious he ought to be in ſelecting men for the
                    ſacred office, he reminds him of the arts of the Judaizing teachers, and the bad
                    character of the Cretans, (chapter i).</p>
                <p>He adviſes him to accommodate his exhortations to the reſpective ages, ſexes, and
                    circumſtances, of thoſe whom it was his duty to inſtruct; and to give the
                    greater weight to his inſtructions, he admoniſhes hint to be an example of what
                    he taught, (chap. ii). He exhorts him alſo to teach obedience to the civil
                    magiſtrate, becauſe the Judaizing Chriſtians affirmed that no obedience was due
                    from the worſhippers of the true God to magiſtrates who were idolaters. He
                    cautions</p>
                <p>againſt cenſoriousness and contention, and recommends meekneſs; for even the beſt
                    Chriſtians had formerly been wicked, and all the bleſſings which they enjoyed
                    they derived from the goodneſs of God He then enjoins Titus ſtrenuouſly to
                    inculcate good works, and to avoid uſeleſs controverſies; and concludes with
                    directing him how to proceed with thoſe heretics who attempted to ſow diſſenſion
                    in the church.</p>
                <p>The Epiſtle to Philemon was written from Rome at the ſame time with the Epiſtles
                    to the Coloſſians and Philippians, about A. D. 62 or 63. The occaſion of the
                    letter was this: Oneſimus, Philemon’s ſlave, had robbed his maſter and fled to
                    Rome; where, happily for him, he met with the apoſtle, who was at that time a
                    priſoner at large, and by his inſtructions and admonitions was converted to
                    Chriſtianity, and reclaimed to a ſenſe of his duty. St Paul ſeems to have kept
                    him for ſome conſiderable time under his eye, that he might be ſatisfied of the
                    reality of the change; and, when he had made a ſufficient trial of him, and
                    found that his behaviour was entirely agreeable to his profeſſion, he would not
                    detain him any longer for his own private convenience, though in a ſituation
                    that rendered ſuch an aſliſtant peculiarly deſirable (compare ver. 13, 14.), but
                    ſent him back to his maſter; and, as a mark of his eſteem, entruſted him,
                    together with Tychicus, with the charge of delivering his Epiſtle to the church
                    at Coloſſe, and giving them a particular account of the ſtate of things at Rome,
                    recommending him to them, at the ſame time, as a faithful and beloved brother,
                    (Col. iv. 9). And as Philemon might well be ſuppoſed to be ſtrongly prejudiced
                    againſt one who had left his ſervice in ſo infamous a manner, he ſends him this
                    letter, in which he employs all his influence to remove his ſuſpicions, and
                    reconcile him to the thoughts of taking Oneſimus into his family again. And
                    whereas St Paul might have exerted that authority which his character as an
                    apoſtle, and the relation in which he ſtood to Philemon as a ſpiritual father,
                    would naturally give him, he chooſes to intreat him as a friend; and with the
                    ſofteſt and moſt inſinuating addreſs urges his ſuit, conjuring him by all the
                    ties of Chriſtian friendſhip that he would not deny him his requeſt: and the
                    more effectually to prevail upon him, he repreſents his own peace and happineſs
                    as deeply intereſted in the event; and ſpeaks of Oneſimus in ſuch terms as were
                    beſt adapted to ſoften his prejudices, and diſpoſe him to receive one who was ſo
                    dear to himſelf, not merely as a ſervant, but as a fellow Chriſtian and a
                    friend.</p>
                <p>It is impoſſible to read over this admirable Epiſtle, without being touched with
                    the delicacy of ſentiment, and the maſterly addreſs that appear in every part of
                    it. We ſee here, in a moſt ſtriking light, how perfectly conſiſtent true
                    politeneſs is, not only with all the warmth and ſincerity of the friend, but
                    even with the dignity of the Chriſtian and the apoſtle. And if this letter were
                    to be conſidered in no other view than as a mere human compoſition, it mull be
                    allowed a maſter-piece in its kind. As an illuſtration of this remark, it may
                    not be<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0175.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0169"/>
                    improper to compare it with an epiſtle of Pliny, that ſeems to have been written
                    upon a ſimilar occaſion, <hi rend="italic">[lib. ix. let.</hi> 21.); which,
                    though penned by one that was reckoned to excel in the epiſtolary ſtyle, and
                    though it has undoubtedly many beauties, yet muſt be acknowledged, by every
                    impartial reader, vallly inferior to this animated compoſition of the
                    apoſtle.</p>
                <p>The Epiſtle to the Hebrews has been generally aſcribed to Paul; but the truth of
                    this opinion has been ſuſpected by others, for three reaſons: 1. The name of the
                    writer is nowhere mentioned, neither in the beginning nor in any other part of
                    the Epiſtle. 2. The ſtyle is ſaid to be more elegant than Paul’s. 3. There are
                    expreſſions in the Epiſtle which have been thought unſuitable to an apoſtle’s
                    character. 1. In anſwer to the firſt objection, Clemens Alexandrinus has
                    aſſigned a very good reaſon: “Writing to the Hebrews (ſays he), who had
                    conceived a prejudice againſt him, and were ſuſpicious of him, he wiſely
                    declined ſetting his name at the beginning, left he ſhould offend them.” 2.
                    Origen and Jerome admired the elegance of the ſtyle, and reckoned it ſuperior to
                    that which Paul has exhibited in his Epiſtles: but as ancient teſtimony had
                    aſſigned it to Paul, they endeavoured to anſwer the objection, by ſuppoſing that
                    the ſentiments were the apoſtle’s, but the language and compoſition the work of
                    ſome other perſon. If the Epiſtle, however, be a tranſlation, which we believe
                    it to be, the elegance of the language may belong to the tranſlator. As to the
                    compoſition and arrangement, it cannot be denied that there are many ſpecimens
                    in the writings of this apoſtle not inferior in theſe qualities to the Epiſtle
                    to the Hebrews. 3. It is objected, that in Heb. ii. 3. the writer of this
                    Epiſtle joins himſelf with thoſe who had received the goſpel from Chriſt’s
                    apoſtles. Now Paul had it from Chriſt himſelf. But Paul often appeals to the
                    teſtimony of the apoſtles in ſupport of thoſe truths which he had received from
                    Revelation: We may inſtance 1 Cor. XV. 5, 6, 7, 8.; 2 Tim. ii. 2.</p>
                <p>This Epiſtle is not quoted till the end of the ſecond century, and even then does
                    not ſeem to have been univerſally received. This ſilence might be owing to the
                    Hebrews themſelves, who ſuppoſing this letter had no relation to the Gentiles,
                    might be at no pains to diffuſe copies of it. The authors, however, on whoſe
                    teſtimony we receive it as authentic, are entitled to credit; for they lived ſo
                    near the age of the apoſtles, that they were in no danger of being impoſed on;
                    and from the numerous liſt of books which they rejected as ſpurious, we are
                    aſſured that they were very careful to guard againſt impoſition. It is often
                    quoted as Paul’s by Clemens Alexandrinus, about the year 194. It is received and
                    quoted as Paul’s by Origen, about 230; by Dionyſius biſhop of Alexandria in 247;
                    and by a numerous liſt of ſucceeding writers.</p>
                <p>The Epiſtle to the Hebrews was originally written in Hebrew, or rather
                    Syro-Chaldaic; a fact which we believe on the teſtimony of Clemens Alexandrinus,
                    Jerome, and Euſebius To this it has been objected, that as theſe writers have
                    not referred to any authority, we ought to conſider what they ſay on this
                    ſubject merely as an opinion. But as they ſtate no reaſons for adopting this
                    opinion, but only mention as a fact that Paul wrote to the Hebrews in their
                    native language, we muſt allow that it is their teſtimony which they</p>
                <p>produce, and not their opinion. Euſebius informs us, that ſome ſuppoſed Luke the
                    Evangeliſt, and others Clemens Romanus, to have been the tranſlator.</p>
                <p>According to the opiniom of ancient writers, particularly Clemens Alexandrinus,
                    Jerome, and Euthalius, this Epiſtle was addreſſed to the Jews in Paleſtine.— The
                    ſcope of the Epiſtle confirms this opinion.</p>
                <p>Having now given ſufficient evidence that this Epiſtle was written by Paul, the
                    time when it was written may be eaſily determined: For the ſalutation from the
                    ſaints of Italy (chap. iv. 24.), together with the apoſtle’s promiſe to ſee the
                    Hebrews (ver. 2 3.), plainly intimate, that his confinement was then either
                    ended or on the eve of being ended. It muſt therefore have been written ſoon
                    after the Epiſtles to the Coloſſians, Epheſians, and Philemon, and not long
                    before Paul left Italy, that is, in the year 61 or 62.</p>
                <p>As the zealous defenders of the Moſaic law would naturally inſiſt on the divine
                    authority of Moſes, on the majeſty and glory attending its promulgation by the
                    miniſtry of angels, and the great privileges it afforded thoſe who adhered to
                    it; the apoſtle ſhows,</p>
                <p>I. That in all theſe ſeveral articles Chriſtianity had an infinite ſuperiority to
                    the law.</p>
                <p>This topic he purſues from chap. i. to xi. wherein he reminds the believing
                    Hebrews of the extraordinary favour ſhown them by God, in ſending them a
                    revelation by his own ſon, whoſe glory was far ſuperior to that of angels (chap.
                    i. throughout); very naturally inferring from hence the danger of deſpiſing
                    Chriſt on account of his humiliation, which, in perfect conſiſtence with his
                    dominion over the world to come, was voluntarily ſubmitted to by him for wife
                    and important reaſons; particularly to deliver us from the fear of death, and to
                    encourage the freedom of our acceſs to God (chap. ii. throughout). With the ſame
                    view he magnifies Chriſt as ſuperior to Moſes, their great legiſlator; and from
                    the puniſhment inflicted on thoſe who rebelled againſt the authority of Moſes,
                    infers the danger of contemning the promiſes of the goſpel (chap.</p>
                <p>iii. 2 — 13). And as it was an eaſy tranſition to call to mind on this occaſion
                    that reſt in Canaan to which the authority inveſtcd in Moſes was intended to
                    lead them; the apoſtle hence cautions them againſt unbelief, as what would
                    prevent their entering into a ſuperior ſtate of reft to what the Jews ever
                    enjoyed (chap. iii. 14. iv. 11). This caution is ſtill farther enforced by awful
                    views of God’s omniſcience, and a lively repreſentation of the high-prieſthood
                    of Chriſt (chap. iv. to the end; and Chap. v. throughout). In the next place, he
                    intimates the very hopeleſs ſituation of thoſe who apoſtatiſe from Chriſtianity
                    (chap. vi. 1 — 9.); and then, for the comfort and confirmation of ſincere
                    believers, diſplays to them the goodneſs of God, and his faithful adherence to
                    his holy engagements; the performance of which is ſealed by the entrance of
                    Chriſt into heaven as our forerunner (chap. vi. 9. to the end). Still farther to
                    illuſtrate the character of our Lord, he enters into a parallel between him and
                    Melchizedec as to their title and deſcent; and, from inſtances wherein the
                    prieſthood of Melchizedec excelled the Levitical, infers, that the glory of the
                    prieſthood of Chriſt ſurpaſſed that under the law (chap. vii. 1—17). From theſe
                    premiſes the apoſtle argues, that the Aaronical prieſthood was not only
                    excelled, but conſummated by that of Chriſt,<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0176.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0170"/> to which it
                    was only introductory and ſubſervient; and of courſe, that the obligation of the
                    law was henceforth diſſolved (chap. vii. 18. to the end). Then recapitulating
                    what he had already demonſtrated concerning the fuperior dignity of Chriſt’s
                    prieſthood, he thence illuſtrates the diſtinguiſhed excellence of the new
                    covenant, as not only foretold by Jeremiah, but evidently enriched with much
                    better promiſes than the old (ch. viii. throughout): Explaining farther the
                    doctrine of the prieſthood and interceſſion of Chriſt, by comparing <hi
                        rend="italic">it</hi> with what the Jewiſh high-prieſts did on the great day
                    of atonement (chap. ix. 1—14) Afterwards he enlarges on the neceſſity of
                    ſhedding Chriſt’s blood, and the ſufficiency of the atonement made by it (chap
                    ix. 15. to the end); and proves that the legal ceremonies could not by any means
                    purify the confidence: whence he infers the inſufficiency of the Moſaic law, and
                    the neceſſity of looking beyond it chap. x. 1—15. i He then urges the Hebrews to
                    improve the privileges which ſuch an high-prieſt and covenant conferred on them,
                    to the purpoſes of approaching God with confidence, to a confiant attendance on
                    his worſhip, and moſt benevolent regards to each other (chap x 15—25).</p>
                <p>The apoſtle having thus obviated the inſinuations and objections of the Jews, for
                    the ſatisfaction and ehabliſhment of the believing Hebrews, proceeds,</p>
                <p>II. To prepare and fortify their minds againſt the ſtorm of perſecution which in
                    part had already befallen them, which was likely to continue and be often
                    renewed, he reminds them of thoſe extremities they had endured, and of the fatal
                    effects which would attend their apoſtacy (chap x. 26. to the end); calling to
                    their remembrance the eminent examples of faith and fortitude exhibited by holy
                    men, and recorded in the Old Teſtament (chap. xi. 1—29). He concludes his
                    diſcourſe with glancing at many other illuſtrious worthies; and, beſides thoſe
                    recorded in Scripture, refers to the caſe of ſeveral who ſuſſered under the
                    perſecution of Antiochus Epiphanes (2 Maccab. chap. viii. amp;c. chap. xi. 30.
                    xii. 2).</p>
                <p>Having thus finiſhed the argumentative part of the Epiſtle, the apoſtle proceeds
                    to a general application; in which he exhorts the Hebrew Chriſtians to patience,
                    peace, and holineſs (Chap. xii. 3—14.): cautions them againſt ſecular views and
                    ſenſual gratifications, by laying before them the incomparable excellence of the
                    bleſſings introduced by the goſpel, which even the Jewiſh economy, glorious and
                    magnificent as it was, did by no means equal; exhorts them to brotherly
                    affection, purity, compaſſion, dependence on the divine care, ſtedfaſtneſs in
                    the proſeſſion of truth, a life of thankfulneſs to God, and benevolence to man:
                    and concludes the whole with recommending their pious miniſters to their
                    particular regard, intreating their prayers, ſaluting and granting them his
                    uſual benediction.</p>
                <p>The ſeven following Epiſtles, one of James, two of Peter, three of John, and one
                    of Jude, have been diſtinguiſhed by the appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                        >catholic</hi> or <hi rend="italic">general</hi> epiſtles, becauſe moſt of
                    them are inſcribed, not to particular churches or perſons, but to the body of
                    Jewiſh or Gentile converts over the world. The authenticity of ſome of theſe has
                    been frequently queſtioned, viz. the Epiſtle of James, the ſecond of Peter, the
                    Epiſtle of Jude, and the ſecond and third of John. The ancient Chriſtians were
                    very cautious in admitting any books into their canon whoſe authenticity they
                    had any reaſon to ſuſpect. They rejected all the writings forged by heretics in
                    the name of the apoſtles, and certainly, therefore, would not receive any
                    without firſt ſubjecting them to a ſevere ſcrutiny.<note anchored="false" n="132" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Macknight on the
                        Epistles.</p></note> Now, though theſe five epiſtles were not immediately
                    acknowledged as the writings of the apoſtles, this only (hows that the perſons
                    who doubted had not received complete and inconteſtable evidence of their
                    authenticity. But as they were afterwards univerſally received, we have every
                    reaſon to conclude, that upon a ſtrict examination they were found to be the
                    genuine productions of the apoſtles. The truth is, ſo good an opportunity had
                    the ancient Chriſtians of examining this matter, ſo careful were they to guard
                    againſt impoſition, and ſo well founded was their judgment concerning the books
                    of the New Teſtament, that, as Dr Lardner obſerves, no waiting which they
                    pronounced genuine has yet been proved ſpurious, nor have we at this day the
                    leaſt reaſon to believe any book genuine which they rejected.</p>
                <p>That the Epiſtle of James was written in the apoſtolical age is proved by the
                    quotations of ancient authors. Clemens Romanus and Ignatius ſeem to have made
                    references to it. Origen quotes it once or twice.</p>
                <p>There are ſeveral reaſons why it was not more generally quoted by the firſt
                    Chriſtian writers. Being written to correct the errors and vices which prevailed
                    among the Jews, the Gentiles might think it of leſs importance to them, and
                    therefore take no pains to procure copies of it. As the author was ſometimes
                    denominated James the Juſt, and often called biſhop of Jeruſalem, it might be
                    doubted whether he was one of the apoſtles. But its authenticity does not ſeem
                    to have been ſuſpected on account of the doctrines which it contains. In modern
                    times, indeed, Luther called it a ſtrawy epiſtle <hi rend="italic">(epistola
                        straminea),</hi> and excluded it from the ſacred writings, on account of its
                    apparent oppoſition to the apoſtle Paul concerning juſtification by faith.</p>
                <p>This Epiſtle could not be written by James the Elder, the ſon of Zebedee, and
                    brother of John, who was beheaded by Herod in the year 44, for it contains
                    paſſages which refer to a later period. It muſt, therefore, have been the
                    compoſition of James the Leſs, the ſon of Alpheus, who was called <hi
                        rend="italic">the Lord’s brother,</hi> becauſe he was the ſon of Mary, the
                    ſiſter of our Lord’s mother. As to the date of this Epiſtle, Lardner fixes it in
                    the year 61 or 62.</p>
                <p>James the Leſs ſtatedly reſided at Jeruſalem, whence he hath been ſtyled by ſome
                    ancient fathers biſhop of that city, though without ſuſſicient foundation.<note anchored="false" n="133" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Doddridge's
                            Family Expositor.</p></note> Now James being one of the apoſtles of the
                    circumciſion, while he confined his perſonal labours to the inhabitants of
                    Judea, it was very natural for him to endeavour by his writings to extend his
                    ſervices to the jewiſh Christians who were diſperſed abroad in more diſtant
                    regions. For this purpoſe, there are two points which the apoſtle ſeems to have
                    principally aimed at, though he hath not purſued them in an orderly and logical
                    method, but in the free epiſtolary manner, handling them jointly or diſtinctly
                    as occaſions naturally offered. And theſe were, “to correct thoſe errors both in
                    doctrine and practice into which the Jewiſh Chriſtians had fallen, which might
                    otherwiſe have produced fatal conſequen-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0177.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0171"/> ces; and then to eſtabliſh the faith and animate
                    the hope of ſincere believers, both under their preſent and their approaching
                    ſufferings.”</p>
                <p>The opinions which he is moſt anxious to refute are theſe, that God is the author
                    of ſin, (ch. i. 13.); that the belief of the doctrines of the goſpel was
                    ſufficient to procure the favour of God for them, however deficient they were in
                    good works, (ch. ii.) He diſſuades the Jews from aſpiring to the office of
                    teachers in the third chapter, becauſe their prejudices in favour of the law of
                    Moſes might induce them to pervert the doctrines of the goſpel. He therefore
                    guards them againſt the ſins of the tongue, by repreſenting their pernicious
                    effects; and as they thought themſelves wiſe and intelligent, and were ambitious
                    of becoming teachers, he adviſes them to make good their pretenſions, by ſhowing
                    themſelves poſſeſſed of that wiſdom which is from above, (ch. iii.).</p>
                <p>The deſtruction of Jeruſalem was now approaching; the Jews were ſplit into
                    factions, and often ſlaughtered one another; the apoſtle, therefore, in the
                    fourth chapter, admoniſhes them to purify themſelves from thoſe vices which
                    produced tumults and bloodſhed. To rouſe them to repentance, he foretels the
                    miſeries that were coming upon them. Laſtly, he checks an irreligious ſpirit
                    that ſeems to have prevailed, and concludes the Epiſtle with ſeveral
                    exhortations.</p>
                <p>The authenticity of the firſt Epiſtle of Peter has never been denied. It is
                    reſerred to by Clemens Romanus, by Polycarp, and is quoted by Papias, Irenæus,
                    Clemens Alexandrinus, and Tertullian. It is addreſſed to the ſtrangers ſcattered
                    through Pontus, amp;c. who are evidently Chriſtians in general, as appears from
                    chap. ii. 10. “In time paſt they were not a people, but are now the people of
                    God.” From Peter’s ſending the ſalutation of the church at Babylon to the
                    Chriſtians in Pontus, amp;c. it is generally believed that he wrote it in
                    Babylon. There was a Babylon in Egypt and another in Aſſyria. It could not be
                    the former, for it was an obſcure place, which ſeems to have had no church for
                    the four firſt centuries. We have no authority to affirm that Peter ever was in
                    Aſſyria. The moſt probable opinion is that of Grotius, Whitby, Lardner, as well
                    as of Euſebius, Jerome, and others, that by Babylon Peter figuratively means
                    Rome. Lardner dates it in 63 or 64, or at the lateſt 65.</p>
                <p>St Peter’s chief deſign is to confirm the doctrine of St Paul, which the falſe
                    teachers pretended he was oppoſing; and to aſſure the proſelytes that they flood
                    in the true grace of God, (ch. v. 12.) With this view he calls them elect; and
                    mentions, that they had been declared ſuch by the effufion of the Holy Ghoſt
                    upon them, (ch. i. 1,2.) He aſſures them that they were regenerate without
                    circumciſion, merely through the goſpel and reſurrection of Chriſt, (ver. 3, 4.
                    21—25.); and that their ſufferings were no argument of their being under the
                    diſpleaſure of God, as the Jews imagined, (ver. 6—12.) He recommends it to them
                    to hope for grace to the end, (ver. 13.) He teſtifies, that they were not
                    redeemed by the Paſchal lamb, but through Chriſt, whom God had preordained for
                    this purpose before the foundation of the world, (ver. 18—20.)</p>
                <p>The second Epiſtle of Peter is not mentioned by any ancient writer extant till
                    the fourth century, from which</p>
                <p>time it has been received by all Chriſtians except the Syrians. Jerome acquaints
                    us, that its authenticity was diſputed, on account of a remarkable difference
                    between the ſtyle of it and the former Epiſtle. But this remarkable difference
                    in ſtyle is confined to the 2d chapter of the 2d Epiſtle. No objection, however,
                    can be drawn from this circumſtance; for the ſubject of that chapter is
                    different from the rest of Peter’s writings, and nothing is ſo well known than
                    that different ſubjects ſuggeſt different ſtyles. Peter, in deſcribing the
                    character of ſome flagitious impoſtors, feels an indignation which he cannot
                    ſuppreſs: it breaks out, therefore, in the bold and animated figures of an
                    oriental writer. Such a diverſity of ſtyle is not uncommon in the beſt writers,
                    eſpecially when warmed with their ſubject.</p>
                <p>This objection being removed, we contend that this Epiſtle was written by Peter,
                    from the inſcription, <hi rend="italic">Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of
                        Jesus Christ.</hi> It appears from chap. i. 16, 17, 18, that the writer was
                    one of the diſciples who ſaw the transfiguration of our Saviour. Since it has
                    never been aſcribed to James or John, it muſt therefore have been Peter. It is
                    evident, from chap. iii. 1. that the author had written an Epiſtle before to the
                    ſame perſons, which is another circumſtance that proves Peter to be the
                    author.</p>
                <p>It is acknowledged, however, that all this evidence is merely internal; for we
                    have not been able to find any external evidence upon the ſubject. If,
                    therefore, the credit which we give to any fact is to be in proportion to the
                    degree of evidence with which it is accompanied, we ſhall allow more authority
                    due to the goſpels than to the epiſtles; more to thoſe epiſtles which have been
                    generally acknowledged than to thoſe which have been controverted; and therefore
                    no doctrine of Chriſtianity ought to be founded ſolely upon them. It may alſo be
                    added, that perhaps the beſt way of determining what are the eſſential doctrines
                    of Chriſtianity would be to examine what are the doctrines which occur oſteneſt
                    in the goſpels; for the goſpels are the plaineſt parts of the New Teſtament; and
                    their authenticity is moſt completely proved. They are therefore beſt fitted for
                    common readers. Nor will it be denied, we preſume, that our Saviour taught all
                    the doctrines of the Christian religion himself; that he repeated them on
                    different occaſions, and inculcated them with an earneſtneſs proportionable to
                    their importance. The Epiſtles are to be considered as a commentary on the
                    eſſential doctrines of the goſpel, adapted to the ſituation and circumſtances of
                    particular churches, and perhaps ſometimes explaining doctrines of inferior
                    importance. 1. The eſſential doctrines are therefore firſt to be fought for in
                    the goſpels, and to be determined by the number of times they occur. 2.They are
                    to be ſought for, in the next place, in the uncontroverted Epiſtles, in the ſame
                    manner. 3.No eſſential doctrine ought to be founded on a ſingle paſſage, nor on
                    the authority of a controverted Epiſtle.</p>
                <p>That Peter was old, and near his end, when he wrote this Epiſtle, may be inferred
                    from chap. i. 14. “Knowing that ſhortly I muſt put off this tabernacle, even as
                    our Lord Jeſus has ſhewn me.” Lardner thinks it was written ſoon after the
                    former. Others, perhaps with more accuracy, date it in 67.</p>
                <p>The general deſign of this Epiſtle is, to confirm the doctrines and inſtructions
                    delivered in the former; “to excite the Chriſtian converts to adorn, and
                    ſtedfaſtly ad-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0178.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0172"/>
                    here to their holy religion, as a religion proceeding from God, notwithſtanding
                    the artifices of falſe teachers, whoſc character is at large deſcribed; or the
                    perfection of their bitter and inveterate enemies.”</p>
                <p>The firſt Epiſtle of John is aſcribed by the unanimous ſuffrage of the ancients
                    to the beloved diſciple of our Lord. It is referred to by Polycarp, is quoted by
                    Papias, by Irenæus, and was received as genuine by Clemens Alexandrinus, by
                    Dionyſius of Alexandria, by Cyprian, by Origen, and Euſebius. There is ſuch a
                    reſernblance between the ſtyle and ſentiments of this Epiſtle and thoſe of the
                    goſpel according to John, as to afford the higheſt degree of internal evidence
                    that they are the compoſition of the ſame author. In the ſtyle of this apoſtle
                    there is a remarkable peculiarity, and eſpecially in this Epiſtle. His
                    ſentences, conſidered ſeparately, are exceeding clear and intelligible; but when
                    we ſearch for their connection, we frequently meet with greater difficulties
                    than we do even in the Epiſtles of St Paul. The principal ſignature and
                    characteriſtic of his manner is an artleſs and amiable ſimplicity, and a
                    singular modeſty and candour, in conjunction with a wonderful ſublimity of
                    ſentiment. His conceptions are apparently delivered to us in the order in which
                    they aroſe to his own mind, and are not the product of artificial reaſoning or
                    laboured inveſtigation.</p>
                <p>It is impoſſible to fix with any preciſion the <hi rend="italic">date</hi> of
                    this Epiſtle, nor can we determine to what perſons it was addreſſed.</p>
                <p>The leading deſign of the apoſtle is to ſhow the inſufficiency of faith, and the
                    external profeſſion of religion, ſeparate from morality; to guard the Chriſtians
                    to whom he writes againſt the deluſive arts of the corrupters of Chriſtianity,
                    whom he calls Antichriſt; and to inculcate univerſal benevolence. His
                    admonitions concerning the neceſſity of good morals, and the inefficacy of
                    external profeſſions, are ſcattered over the Epiſtle, but are moſt frequent in
                    the 1ſt, 2d, and 3d chapters. The enemies or corrupters of Chriſtianity, againſt
                    whom he contends, ſeem to have denied that Jeſus was the Meſſiah, the Son of God
                    (chap. ii. 22. V. 1.), and had actually come into the world in a human form,
                    (chap. iv. 2, 3.) The earneſtneſs and frequency with which this apoſtle
                    recommends the duty of benevolence is remarkable. He makes it the diſtinguiſhing
                    characteriſtic of the diſciples of Jeſus, the only ſure pledge of our love to
                    God, and the only aſſurance of eternal life, (chap. iii. 14, 15.) Benevolence
                    was his favourite theme, which he affectionately preſſed upon others, and
                    conſtantly practiſed himſelf. It was conſpicuous in his conduct to his great
                    Maſter, and in the reciprocal affection which it inſpired in his ſacred breaſt.
                    He continued to recommend it in his laſt words. When his extreme age and
                    infirmities had ſo waſted his ſtrength that he was incapable to exerciſe the
                    duties of his office, the venerable old man, anxious to exert in the ſervice of
                    his Maſter the little ſtrength which ſtill remained, cauſed himſelf to be
                    carried to church, and, in the midſt of the congregation, he repeated theſe
                    words,</p>
                <p>"Little children, love one another.”</p>
                <p>It has been obſerved by Dr Mill that the ſecond and third Epiſtles of John are ſo
                    ſhort, and reſemble the firſt ſo much in ſentiment and ſtyle, that it is not
                    worth while to contend about them. The ſecond Epiſtle conſiſts only of 13
                    verſes; and of theſe eight may be found in the 1ſt Epiſtle, in which the ſenſe
                    or language is preciſely the ſame.</p>
                <p>The ſecond Epiſtle is quoted by Irenaeus, and was received by Clemens
                    Alexandrinus, Both were admitted by Athanaſius, by Cyril of Jeruſalem, and by
                    Jerome. The ſecond is addreſſed to a woman of diſtinction whoſe name is by ſome
                    ſuppoſed to be <hi rend="italic">Cyria</hi> (taking χυρια for a proper name), by
                    others <hi rend="italic">Eclecta.</hi> The third is inſcribed to Gaius, or Caius
                    according to the Latin orthography, who, in the opinion of Lardner, was an
                    eminent Chriſtian, that lived in ſome city of Alia not far from Epheſus, where
                    St John chiefly reſided after his leaving Judea. The time of writing theſe two
                    Epiſtles cannot be determined with any certainty. They are ſo ſhort that an
                    analyſis of them is not neceſſary.</p>
                <p>The Epiſtle of Jude is cited by no ancient Chriſtian writer extant before Clemens
                    Alexandrinus about the year 194; but this author has tranſcribed eight or ten
                    verſes in his Stromata and Pedagogue. It is quoted once by Tertullian about the
                    year 200; by Origen frequently about 230. It was not however received by many of
                    the ancient Chriſtians, on account of a ſuppoſed quotation from a book of Enoch.
                    But it is not certain that Jude quotes any book. He only ſays that <hi
                        rend="italic">Enoch prophesied, ſaying, The Lord Cometh with ten thοuſand of
                        his faints.</hi> Theſe might be words of a prophecy preſerved by tradition,
                    and inſerted occaſionally in different writings. Nor is there any evidence that
                    there was ſuch a book as Enoch’s propheſies in the time of Jude, though a book
                    of that name was extant in the ſecond and third centuries. As to the date of
                    this Epiſtle nothing beyond conjecture can be produced.</p>
                <p>The deſign of it is, by deſcribing the character of the falſe teachers, and the
                    puniſhments to which they were liable, to caution Chriſtians againſt liſtening
                    to their ſuggeſtions, and being thereby perverted from the faith and purity of
                    the goſpel.</p>
                <p>The Apocalypſe or Revelation has not always been unanimouſly received as the
                    genuine production of the apoſtle John. Its authenticity is proved, however, by
                    the teſtimony of many reſpectable authors of the firſt centuries. It is referred
                    to by the martyrs of Lyons: it was admitted by Juſtin Martyr as the work of the
                    apoſtle John. It is often quoted by Irenæus, by Theophilus biſhop of Antioch, by
                    Clement of Alexandria, by Tertullian, by Origen, and by Cyprian of Carthage. It
                    was alſo received by Heretics, by Novatus and his followers, by the Donatiſts,
                    and by the Arians. For the firſt two centuries no part of the New Teſtament was
                    more univerſally acknowledged, or mentioned with higher reſpect. But a diſpute
                    having ariſen about the millennium, Caius with ſome others, about the year 212,
                    to end the controverſy as ſpeedily and effectually as poſſible, ventured to deny
                    the authority of the book which had given occaſion to it.</p>
                <p>The book of Revelation, as we learn from Rev. i. 9. was written in the iſle of
                    Patmos. According to the general teſtimony of ancient authors, John was baniſhed
                    into Patmos in the reign of Domitian, and reſtored by his ſucceſſor Nerva. But
                    the book could not be publiſhed till after John’s releaſe, when he returned to
                    Epheſus. As Domitian died in 96, and his perſecution<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0179.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0173"/> did not
                    commence till near the end of his reign, the Revelation might therefore be
                    publiſhed in 96 or 97.</p>
                <p>Here we ſhould conclude; but as the curious reader may deſire to be informed how
                    the predictions revealed in this book of St John have uſually been interpreted
                    and applied, we ſhall conſiſtently with our ſubject ſubjoin <hi rend="italic">a
                        key to the prophecies contained in the Revelation.</hi> This is extracted

                <p>Nothing of a prophetical nature occurs in the firſt three chapters, except, 1.
                    What is ſaid concerning the church of Epheſus, that her “candleſtick ſhall be
                    removed: out of its place,” which is now verified, not only in this, but in all
                    the other Aſiatic churches which exiſted at that time; the light of the goſpel
                    having been taken from them, not only by their hereſies and diviſions from
                    within, but by the arms of the Saracens from without: And, 2. Concerning the
                    church of Smyrna, that ſhe ſhall. “have tribulation ten days;” that is, in
                    prophetic language, “ten years;” referring to the perſecution of Diocleſian,
                    which alone of all the general perſecutions laſted ſo long.</p>
                <p>The next five chapters relate to the opening of the <hi rend="italic">Seven
                        Seals;</hi> and by theſe ſeals are intimated ſo many different periods of
                    the prophecy. Six of theſe ſeals are opened in the ſixth and ſeventh
                    chapters.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">first ſeal</hi> or period is memorable for conqueſts. It
                    commences with Veſpaſian, and terminates in Nerva; and during this time Judea
                    was ſubjugated. The se <hi rend="italic">cond ſeal</hi> is noted for war and
                    ſlaughter. It commences with Trajan, and continues through his reign, and that
                    of his ſucceſſors. In this period, the Jews were entirely routed and diſperſed;
                    and great was the ſlaughter and devaſtation occaſioned by the contending
                    parties. The <hi rend="italic">third ſeal</hi> is characteriſed by a rigorous
                    execution of juſtice, and an abundant proviſion of corn, wine, and oil. It
                    commences with Septimius Severus. He and Alexander Severus were juſt and ſevere
                    emperors, and at the ſame time highly celebrated for the regard they paid to the
                    felicity of their people, by procuring them plenty of every thing, and
                    particularly corn, wine, and oil. This period laſted during the reigns of the
                    Septimian family. The <hi rend="italic">fourth ſeal</hi> is diſtinguiſhed by a
                    concurrence of evils, ſuch as war, famine, peſtilence, and wild beaſts; by all
                    which the Roman empire was remarkably infeſted from the reign of Maximin to that
                    of Diocleſian. The <hi rend="italic">fifth ſeal</hi> begins at Diocleſian, and
                    is ſignalized by the great perſecution, from whence aroſe that memorable era,
                    the Era of Martyrs. With Conſtantine begins the <hi rend="italic">ſixth
                        ſeal,</hi> a period of revolutions, pictured forth by great commotions in
                    earth and in heaven, alluding to the ſubverſion of Paganiſm and the
                    eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity. This period laſted from the reign of Conſtantine
                    the Great to that of Theodoſius the firſt. The <hi rend="italic">ſeventh
                        ſeal</hi> includes ander it the remaining parts of the prophecy, and
                    comprehends ſeven periods diſtinguiſhed by the founding of ſeven trumpets.</p>
                <p>As the ſeals foretold the ſtate of the Roman empire before and till it became
                    Chriſtian, ſo the trumpets foreſhow the fate of it afterwards; each trumpet
                    being an alarm to one nation or other, rouſing them up to overthrow that
                    empire.</p>
                <p>Four of theſe trumpets are founded in the eighth chapter.</p>
                <p>At the founding of the firſt, Alaric and his G0th3 invade the Roman empire,
                    beſiege Rome twice, and ſet it on fire in ſeveral places. At the founding of the
                    second, Attila and his Huns waſte the Roman provinces, and compel the eaſtern
                    emperor Theodoſius the ſecond, and the weſtern emperor Valentinian the third, to
                    ſubmit to ſhameful terms. At the founding of the third, Genſeric and his Vandals
                    arrive from Africa; ſpoil and plunder Rome, and ſet ſail again with immenſe
                    wealth and innumerable captives. At the founding of the fourth, Odoacer and the
                    Heruli put an end to the very name of the weſtern empire; Theodoric founds the
                    kingdom of the Oſtrogoths in Italy; and at laſt Italy becomes a province of the
                    eaſtern empire, Rome being governed by a duke under the exarch of Ravenna. As
                    the foregoing trumpets relate chiefly to the downfal of the weſtern empire, ſo
                    do the two following to that of the eaſtern. They are founded in the ninth,
                    tenth, and part of the eleventh chapters. At the founding of the fifth trumpet,
                    Mahomet, that blazing ſtar, appears, opens the bottomleſs pit, and with his
                    lecuſts the Arabians darkens the ſun and air. And at the founding of the ſixth,
                    a period not yet finiſhed, the four angels, that is, the four ſultanes, or
                    leaders of the Turks and Othmans, are looſed from the river Euphrates.. The
                    Greek or Eaſtern empire was cruelly "hurt and tormented” under the fifth
                    trumpet; but under the ſixth, it was “ſlain,” and utterly deſtroyed.</p>
                <p>The Latin or Weſtern Church not being reclaimed by the ruin of the Greek or
                    Eaſtern, but ſtill perſiſting in their idolatry and wickedneſs; at the beginning
                    of the tenth chapter, and under the ſound of this ſixth trumpet, is introduced a
                    viſion preparative to the prophecies reſpecting the Weſtern Church, wherein an
                    angel is repreſented, having in his hand a little book, or. codicil, deſcribing
                    the calamities that ſhould overtake that church. The meaſuring of the temple
                    ſhows, that during all this period there will be ſome true Chriſtians, who will
                    conform themſelves to the rule of God’s word, even whilſt the outer court, that
                    is, the external and more extenſive part of this temple or church, is trodden
                    under foot by Gentiles, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> ſuch Chriſtians as, in
                    their idolatrous worſhip and perſecuting practice, reſemble and outdo the
                    Gentiles themſelves. Yet againſt theſe corrupters of religion there will always
                    be ſome true witneffes to proteſt, who, however they may be over- borne at
                    times, and in appearance reduced to death, yet will ariſe again from time to
                    time, till at laſt they triumph and glorioully aſcend. The eleventh chapter
                    concludes with the founding of the ſeventh trumpet.<pb

                    Chriſtian church; by the great red dragon, the heathen Roman empire; by the
                    man-child whom the woman bore, Conſtantine the Great; and by the war in heaven,
                    the conteſts between the Chriſtian and Heathen religions.</p>
                <p>In the thirteenth chapter, by the beaſt with ſeven heads and ten horns, unto whom
                    the dragon gave his power, feat, and great authority, is to be underſtood, net
                    Pagan but Chriſtian, not imperial but papal Rome; in ſubmitting to whole
                    religion, the world did in effect ſubmit again to the religion of the dragon.
                    The ten-horned beaſt therefore repreſents the Romiſh church and ſtate in
                    general: but the beaſt with two horns like a lambis the Roman clergy; and that
                    image of the ten-horned beaſt, which the two-horned beaſt cauſed to be made, and
                    inſpired with life, is the pope; whoſe number is 666, according to the numerical
