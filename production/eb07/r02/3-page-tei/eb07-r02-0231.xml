The total number of schools in the county was 309 ; of which seventeen, containing 545 pupils, were maintained by grants of public money ; thirty-eight, containing 1954 pupils, by the voluntary contributions of societies or individuals ; and the remaining 254 schools, which afforded the means of instruction to 12,147 pupils, were maintained wholly by the pupils’ fees. The report of the Commissioners of National Education in 1837 (the latest published) states the number of schools, teachers, and pupils, connected with their board, as follows : Schools, eleven ; teachers, twelve ; boys, 941 ; girls, 757 ; total of pupils, 1698. The diocesan school of the see of Elphin is in the county.</p><p>The habits of the population are so thoroughly rural, that there are but four towns of which the population of each exceeds a thousand souls, two of them containing between three and four thousand, and the other two between one and two thousand. There are several fine mansions and demesnes in the hands of resident noblemen and gentlemen, and numerous villas and country-seats belonging to independent landed proprietors ; but as to the small farmers and cottiers, the appearance of their dwellings and homesteads in many cases are far from showing those indications of internal comfort that might be expected in a district so highly favoured by nature. Agriculture is carried on with much spirit amongst the higher classes, by whom the latest improvements in tillage, and the best constructed vehicles and implements, have been introduced ; but the old customs and antiquated implements are pertinaciously adhered to by most of the smaller farmers. Wheat is largely sown ; a judicious rotation system is carried on ; and green crops are frequent, with the exception of turnips and mangel-wurzel, which have not been found to answer. In the mountainous districts the spade is frequently used instead of the plough. In these also the neighbouring landholders generally club their labour together, particularly in planting and raising potatoes, all uniting to complete the work of one farm, and then proceeding successively in a body to execute that of the other partners in the amicable joint-stock concern. The pastures are amongst the best in Ireland, and as their proprietors are almost fastidiously particular in the selection of live stock of every description, the best-fed beasts are to be met with here. This is peculiarly the case with respect to bullocks ; the sheep also are of first-rate quality, both as to fleece and flavour of carcass. In prime grazing land an acre feeds a bullock and a sheep. Notwithstanding the superior capabilities of the soil for pasturage, there are not many large dairies. But few farms, however small, are without one cow, if not more, so that butter of excellent quality is made, not only sufficient for the internal demand, but for forming a material article of export. The breed of horses is much esteemed. The annual fair of Ballinasloe, in October, is the principal mart at which the black cattle and sheep are disposed of. Fences in general are made of stone-walls, raised to a considerable height, as they arc considered to afford better shelter for cattle than those of timber. That the county was once well wooded, appears not only from the evidence of history, but from the fact that wherever the impediments to its growth are removed, the soil spontaneously throws up shoots of those species of forest-</p><lb/><p>trees with which the whole face of the country was once covered. The excessive clearing of the woods, without precautionary measures to secure a new growth, has left the surface very bare ; but this defect, equally unsightly to the eye of taste and injurious to the progress of improvement, is annually diminishing, through the exertions of the landed gentry, many of whose mansions are surrounded with noble plantations. Manufactures, with the exception of those already noticed, and of coarse woollens and linens for domestic consumption, are almost unknown. The articles of export are confined to agricultural produce and live stock, for which the recent improvements on the course of the Shannon have afforded great facilities. The navigation of this fine river, which, as has already been said, skirts the county along the whole of its eastern verge, was so much obstructed by several rapids as to render it useless as a channel of enlarged inland traffic. These impediments have been obviated by means of short canals along the side of the river in those parts where the rapids occur. The first is from Lough Allen in Leitrim to Battlebridge, whence the river-stream is available somewhat farther than Carrick, where a second canal serves to avoid the rapids between Jamestown and Drumsna. Other short canals occur at the falls of Ruskey, of Lanesborough, and of Athlone. Thence the channel is clear to the junction with the Suck, where it quits the county. The connection by water with the eastern counties to Dublin is maintained by the Royal and Grand Canals, which communicate with the Shannon at Tarmonbarry and Shannon Harbour. The principal exports are corn and butter, all the coal as yet raised being not more than sufficient for the supply of the districts surrounding the collieries. As all the great lines of land conveyance to Connaught from Leinster and Ulster pass through the county, the roads are numerous, and generally well kept up.</p><p>The monastic antiquities are very numerous. The ruins of the abbey of Boyle still exhibit a large part of its highly ornamented church, with its tower rising from the middle of the building, and resting on four colum∏3 of colossal dimensions, enriched with a variety of sculptures ; and the Dominican friary at Roscommon contains a monument of an ancient member of the O’Conor family, exhibiting an effigy of an armed warrior in a lying posture, with four other armed figures on the base. Derhan Abbey, in the neighbourhood of Roscommon, is little more than a heap of stones. The others of which some relics still exist, are Trinity Abbey in Lough Kea, Tulsk, Clonshanvill, and Clontuskert, in which there are several monuments and inscriptions relating to the O’Kellys and other ancient families. In the parish of Oran on the Suck, in the west of the county, are the remains of an ancient pillar-tower, about ten feet high ; and in every part there are raths so numerous that nearly five hundred are still visible. The county contained a great number of small fortresses, evidently built when it was one of the marches or border districts, to repress the incursions of the Connaught Irish, besides which there were a few of great extent and strength, as is testified by that of Roscommon, forming a quadrangle of 220 by 180 feet, with towers at the angles and at the gateway, and containing the remains of a large building, supposed to be the residence of the governor. The most remarkable of the other castles are those of Athlone, Ballinasloe, Ballynafad, and Lough Glynn.</p><p>Roscommon, the county town, is built on the sides of a hill, near the middle of the county, in a plain between the Shannon and the Suck. It consists but of one main street, with several minor avenues branching out into five main roads, in various directions. It was incorporated at a very early period, and was considered to be one of the chief places in these parts. Writs for the better defence of the town and castle are frequent among the earlier records. It returned</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
