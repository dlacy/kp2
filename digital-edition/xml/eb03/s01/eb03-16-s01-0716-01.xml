a town of Scotland, remarkable for being the place where the kings were anciently crowned. W. Long. 3. 10. N. Lat. 56. 28. Here was once an abbey of great antiquity, which was burnt by the reformers at Dundee. Kenneth II. upon his conqueſt of the Picts in the ninth century, having made Scone his principal reſidence, delivered his laws, called the <hi rend="italic">Macalpine laws,</hi> from a <hi rend="italic">tumulus</hi>, named the <hi rend="italic">Mote Hill oſ Scone.</hi> The preſent palace was begun by the earl of Gowrie; but was completed by Sir David Murray of Goſpatrie, the favourite of king James VI. to whom that monarch had granted it; and the new poſſeſſor in gratitude to his benefactor put up the king’s arms in ſeveral parts of the houſe. It is built around two courts. The dining room is large and handſome; and has an ancient and magnificent chimney-piece, and the king’s arms, with this motto:</p><p>Nobis haec invicta miſerunt centum ſex proavi.</p><p>Beneath are the Murray arms. In the drawing room is ſome good old tapeſtry, with an excellent figure of Mercury. In a ſmall bed-chamber is a medley ſcripture-piece in needle-work, with a border of animals, pretty well done, the work of queen Mary during her confinement in Loch Leven Caſtle. The gallery is about 155 feet long, the top arched, divided into compartments filled with paintings in water-colours. The pieces repreſented are various kinds of huntings; that of Nimrod, and king James and his train, appear in every piece. Till the deſtruction of the abbey, the kings of Scotland were crowned here, fitting in the famous wooden chair which Edward I. tranſported to Weſtminſter abbey, to the great mortification of the Scots, who looked upon it as a kind of palladium. Charles II. before the battle of Worceſter, was crowned in the preſent chapel. The old pretender reſided for ſome time at Scone in 1715; and his ſon paid it a viſit in 1745.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
