<p><span class="font0">to their camp, he was immediately proclaimed; and ſuch were the hopes of his virtues, that all men began&nbsp;to affect his intereſts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Macrinus, who at this time was purſuing his pleaſures at Antioch, gave but little attention to the firſt report ; only ſending his lieutenant Julian, with ſome&nbsp;legions, to quell the inſurrection. However, theſe, like&nbsp;the reſt, ſoon declared for Heliogabalus, and flew their&nbsp;general. It was then that Macrinus found he had&nbsp;treated the rebellion too ſlightly ; he therefore reſolved,&nbsp;with his ſon, to march directly againſt the ſeditious legions, and force them to their duty. Both parties met&nbsp;on the confines of Syria : the battle was for ſome time&nbsp;furious and obſtinate ; but at laſt Macrinus was overthrown, and obliged to ſeek ſafety by flight. His principal aim was to get to Rome, where he knew his preſence was deſired ; wherefore he travelled through the&nbsp;provinces of Aſia Minor with the utmoſt expedition&nbsp;and privacy, but unfortunately ſell ſick at the city of&nbsp;Chalcedon. There thoſe who were ſent in purſuit,&nbsp;overtook and put him to death, together with his ſon&nbsp;Diadumenus, after a ſhort reign of one year and two&nbsp;months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſenate and citizens of Rome being obliged to ſubmit to the appointment of the army as uſual, Heliogabalus aſcended the throne at the age of 14. One at&nbsp;ſo early an age, inveſted with unlimited power, and fur-rounded with flatterers, could be expected to act only&nbsp;as they thought proper to direct. This young emperor was entirely led by them ; and being ſenſible that&nbsp;it was in his power to indulge all his appetites, he ſtudied only their gratification. As he is deſcribed by&nbsp;hiſtorians, he appears a monſter of ſenſuality. His&nbsp;ſhort liſe therefore is but a tiſſue of effeminacy, luſt,&nbsp;and extravagance. He married, in the ſmall ſpace of&nbsp;four years, ſix wives, and divorced them all. He built&nbsp;a temple to the ſun ; and willing that his god ſhould&nbsp;have a wife as well as himſelf, he married him to Pallas,&nbsp;and ſhortly after to the moon. His palace was a place&nbsp;of rendezvous for all the proſtitutes of Rome, whom&nbsp;he frequently met naked, calling them </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">his fellow ſoldiers, and companions in the field.</span><span class="font0"> He was ſo fond of the&nbsp;ſex, that he carried his mother with him to the ſenate-houſe, and demanded that ſhe ſhould always be preſent&nbsp;when matters of importance were debated. He even&nbsp;went ſo far as to build a ſenate-houſe for women, with&nbsp;ſuitable orders, habits, and diſtinctions, of which his&nbsp;mother was made preſident. They met ſeveral times ;&nbsp;all their debates turning upon the faſhions of the day,&nbsp;and the different formalities to be uſed in giving and&nbsp;receiving viſits. To theſe follies, he added great cruelty&nbsp;and boundleſs prodigality ; ſo that he was heard to ſay,&nbsp;that ſuch diſhes as were cheaply obtained were ſcarce&nbsp;worth eating. His ſuppers therefore generally coſt&nbsp;6000 crowns, and oſten 60,000. He was always&nbsp;dreſſed in cloth of gold and purple, enriched with&nbsp;precious ſtones, and yet never wore the ſame habit&nbsp;twice. His palace, his chambers, and his beds, were&nbsp;all furniſhed of the richeſt ſtuffs, covered with gold and&nbsp;jewels. Whenever he took horſe, all the way between&nbsp;his apartment and the place of mounting was covered&nbsp;with gold and ſilver duſt ſtrewn at his approach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe exceſſes were ſoon perceived by his grandmother Mæfa , whoſe intrigues had firſt raiſed him to the throne ; ſo that ſhe thought to leſſen his power by di-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">viding it. Tor this purpoſe, under a pretence of freeing him from the cares of public buſineſs, ſhe perſuaded him to adopt his couſin-german, Alexander, as his ſucceffor ; and likewiſe to make him his partner in the&nbsp;conſulſhip. Heliogabalus, having thus raiſed his couſin,&nbsp;had ſcarce given him his power, when he wiſhed again&nbsp;to take it away ; but the virtues of this young prince&nbsp;had ſo greatly endeared the people and the army to&nbsp;him, that the attempt had like to have been fatal to&nbsp;the tyrant himſelf. The prætorian ſoldiers mutinying,&nbsp;attempted to kill him as he was walking in his gardens;&nbsp;but he eſcaped, by hiding himſelf from their fury.&nbsp;However, upon returning to their camp, they continued the ſedition ; requiring that the emperor ſhould&nbsp;remove ſuch perſons from about him as oppreſſed the&nbsp;ſubject, and contributed to contaminate him. They&nbsp;required alſo the being permitted to guard the young&nbsp;prince themſelves, and that none of the emperor’s favourites or familiars ſhould ever be permitted to con-verſe with him. Heliogabalus was reluctantly obliged&nbsp;to comply ; and conſcious of the danger he was in,&nbsp;made preparations for death, when it ſhould arrive, in&nbsp;a manner truly whimſical and peculiar. He built a&nbsp;lofty tower with ſteps of gold and pearl, from whence&nbsp;to throw himſelf headlong in caſe of neceſſity. He alſe&nbsp;prepared cords of purple ſilk and gold to ſtrangle himſelf with ; he provided golden ſwords and daggers te&nbsp;ſtab himſelf with ; and poiſon to be kept in boxes of&nbsp;emerald, in order to obtain what death he choſe beſt&nbsp;Thus ſearing all things, but particularly ſuſpſeious of&nbsp;the deſigns of the ſenate, he baniſhed them all out of&nbsp;the city : he next attempted to poiſon Alexander, and&nbsp;ſpread a report of his death ; but perceiving the ſoldiers begin to mutiny, he immediately took him in his&nbsp;chariot to the canrp, where he experienced a freſh mortification, by finding all the acclamations of the army&nbsp;directed only to his ſucceſſor. This not a little raiſed&nbsp;his indignation, and excited his deſire of revenge. He&nbsp;returned towards the city, threatening the moſt ſevere&nbsp;puniſhments againſt thoſe who had diſpleaſed him, and&nbsp;meditating freſh cruelties. However, the ſoldiers were&nbsp;unwilling to give him time to put his deſigns in execution : they followed him directly to his palace, purſued&nbsp;him from apartment to apartment, and at laſt found&nbsp;him concealed in a privy ; a ſituation very different&nbsp;from that in which he expected to die. Having dragged him from thence through the ſtreets, with the moſt&nbsp;bitter invectives, and having diſpatched him, they attempted once more to ſqueeze his pampered body into&nbsp;a privy; but not eaſily effecting this, they threw it into&nbsp;the Tiber, with heavy weights, that none might afterwards find or give it burial. This was the miſerable&nbsp;and ignominious death of Heliogabalus, in the 18th&nbsp;year of his agc, after a deteſtable reign of four years.&nbsp;His mother alſo was ſlain at the ſame time by the ſoldiers ; as were alſo many of the opprobrious aſſociates&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">his criminal pleaſures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alexander being, without oppoſition, declared emperor, the ſenate, in their uſual method of adulation, were for conferring new titles upon him ; but he modeſtly declined them all, alleging, that titles were only&nbsp;honourable when given to virtue, not to ſtation. This&nbsp;outſet was an happy omen of his future virtues ; and&nbsp;few princes in hiſtory have been more commended by&nbsp;his contemporaries, or indeed more deſerved commenda-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
