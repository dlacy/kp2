In the autumn, when the decayed leaves are removed, if the ſhoveling of the alleys are thrown over the crowns of the plants, it will be found of ſervice.</p><p>His mode of cultivating the fame plant by offsets is thus given : " On taking up ſome plants the laff ſpiing, I flipped off ſeveral offsets from the heads of large plants : theſe I ſet with a dibble about a foot apart, in order, if I found them thrive, to remove them into other beds. On examining them in the autumn, I was ſurpriſed to ſee the progreſs they had made, and pleaſed to be able to furniſh my beds with 40 plants in the moſt thriving ſtate. Though this was my ſirſt experiment oſ its kind, I do not mean to arrogate the difcovery to myſelf, having known it recently tried by others, but without being informed of their ſucceſs. I have rea-ſon to think this valuable drug will, by this method, be brought much ſooner to perfection than from ſeed.”</p><p>His method of curing rhubarb is thus deſcribed : " The plants may be taken up either early in the ſpring, or in autumn, when the leaves are decayed, in dry wea-ther if poſſible, when the roots are to be cleared from dirt (without waſhing) : let them be cut into pieces, and with a ſharp knife freed from the outer coat, and expoſed to the ſun and air for a few days, to render the outſide a little dry. In order to accelerate the curing of the largeſt pieces, a hole may be ſcooped out with a penknife : thefe and the ſmaller parts are then to be ſtrung on packthread, and hung up in a warm room ( I have always had the conveniency of ſuch a one over a baker’s oven), where it is to remain till perfectly dry. Each piece may be rendered more ſſghtly by a common file, fixing it in a ſmall vice during that operation : afterwards rub over it a very ſine powder, which the ſmall roots ſurniſh in beautiful perfection, for this and every other purpoſe where rhubarb is required.”</p><p>In the year 1794, too, the Society adjudged the gold medal to Mr Ball for his method of curing the true rhubarb, which is as follows ; " I take the roots up when I ſind the ſtalks withering or dying away, clean them from the earth with a dry bruſh, cut them in ſmall pieces of about four or ſive inches in breadth, and about two in depth, taking away all the bark, and make a hole in the middle, and ſtring them on packthread, keeping every piece apart ; and every morning, if the weather is clear and fine, I place them in the open part of the garden, on ſtages, erected by fixing ſmall poſts about ſix feet high in the ground, and ſix feet aſunder, into which I ſix horizontal pegs, about a foot apart, beginning at the top ; and the rhubarb being ſtringed croſs-wiſe on ſmall poles, I place them on theſe pegs ; ſo that if it ſhould rain, I could eaſily remove each pole with the ſufpended pieces, into any covered place. I never ſuffer them to be out at night, as the damps at this ſea-ſon would be apt to mould them ; and if at any time I perceive the leaſt mark of mould, I rub it off with a dry cloth. In ſome of the pieces of rhubarb which I have cured this year, I have made holes about half an inch diameter in the middle, for the free paſſage of air, and have found that every one of theſe pleces dried better than the others where no ſuch holes were made ; and have likewife hung ſeveral ffrings in the kitchen, and never expoſed them in the open air, and found them to dry exceedingly well, and much better than thoſe in the open air. Some years ſince I dried a quantity of rhubarb on a malt-kiln, keeping up the thermometer to 80 degrees, which anſwered well, but I think rather dried too quick <hi rend="italic">ί</hi>  the roots which I have cured this year are a part of the plantation of 1789, aud for which the Society was ſo kind as to give me a medal @@(A)<hi rend="smallcaps">.”</hi></p><p>RHEXIA, in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the octandria clafs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking with thoſe of the 17th order, <hi rend="italic">Calycanthemce.</hi>  The calyx is quadriſid, with four petals inſerted into it ; the antheræ are declining ; the capſule is quadrilocular, within the belly of the calyx.</p><p>RHINzANTHUS, in botany: A genus of the an-gioſpermia order, belonging to the didynamia claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 40th order, <hi rend="italic">Perfonatœ.</hi>  The calyx is quadriſid, and ventricoſe ; the capſule bilocular, obtuſe, and compreſ-fed.</p><p>RHINE, a large river of Germany, famous both in ancient and modern hiſtory.
