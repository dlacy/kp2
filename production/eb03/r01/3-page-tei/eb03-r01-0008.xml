Phile <hi rend="italic">(De propriet. anim.</hi>  p. 85.J gives much the ſame relation. We are inclined to give them credit, ſince a modern writer, of undoubted autho-rity *, gives the very ſame account of a fiſh found in the South Seas, the terror of thoſe employed in the pearl.ſiſhery. It is a ſpecies of ray, called there <hi rend="italic">manta,</hi>  or the <hi rend="italic">quilt,</hi>  from its ſurrounding and wrapping up the unhappy divers till they are ſuffocated ; there-fore the negroes never go down without a ſharp knife to defend themſelves againſt the affaults of this terrible enemy.</p><p>3.    The aſpera, or rough ray, is found in Loch-Broom in Scotland. The length from the noſe to the tip of the tail is two feet nine. The tail is almoſt of the ſame length with the body. The noſe is very ſhort. Before each eye is a large hooked ſpine ; and behind each another, beſet with leſſer. The upper part of the body is of a cinereous brown mixed with white, and ſpotted with black; and entirely covered with fmall ſpines. Οη the tail are three rows of great ſpines : all the reſt of the tail is irregularly bεfet with leſſer. The fins and under fide of the body are equally rough with the upper. The teeth are flat and rhυmboidal.</p><p>4.    The fullonica, or fuller, derives its Latin name from the inſtrument fullers make uſe of in ſmoothing cloth, the back being rough and ſpiney. The noſe is ſhort and ſharp. At the corner of each eye are a few ſpines. The membrane of nictitation is fringed. Teeth ſmall and ſharp. Οη the upper part of the pectoral fins are three rows of ſpines pointing towards the back, crooked like thoſe on a fuller’s inſtrument. Οη the tail are three rows of ſtrong ſpines: the middle row reaches up part of the back. The tail is ſlender, and rather longer than the body. The colour of the upper part of the body is cinereous, marked uſually with numerous black ſpots : the lower part is white. This, as well as moſt other ſpecies of rays, vary a little in colour, ac-cordιng to age. <hi rend="sup">r</hi>Fhιs grows to a iιze equal to the ſkate» It is common at Scarborough, where it is called the <hi rend="italic">white hans,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">gullet.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">ζ.</hi>  The ſhagreen ray increaſes to the ſize of the ſkate; is fond of launces or ſand-eels, which it takes generally as a bait. The form is narrower than that of the common kinds ; the noſe long and very ſharp ; pupil of the eye ſapphirine; on the noſe are two ſhort rows of ſpines; on the corner oſ the eyes another of a ſemicircular form; on the tail are two rows, continued a little up the back, ſmall, ſlender, and very ſharp : along the ſides of the tail is a row of minute ſpines, intermixed with innumerable little fpiculæ. The upper part of the body is of a cinereous brown, covered cloſely with ſhagreen-like tubercles, reſembling'the ſkin of the dog-fiſh: the under fide of the body is white ; from the noſe to the begin-ning of the pectoral fins is a tubercπlated ſpace. The teeth ſlender, and ſharp as needles.</p><p>6. The torpedo, cramp-ſiſh, or electric ray, is frequently taken in Torbay : has been once caught off Pembroke, and ſometimes near waterford in Ireland. It is generally taken, like other flat ſiſh, with the trawl ; but there is an inſtance of its taking the bait. It com-</p><p>monly lies in water of about 40 fathoms depth ; and m company with the congenerous rays. The. torpedo, brings forth its yo&lt;ung at the autumnal equinox, as affirmed by Ariſtotle. A gentleman of La Rochelle, on diffecting certain females of this fpecies, the 10th of September, found in the matrices ſeveral of the fcetuſes quite formed, and nine eggs in no ſtate of forwardnefs : ſuperfcetation ſeems therefore to be a property of this fiſh-The food of the torpedo is fiſh ; a ſurmullet and a plaife have been found in the ſtomach of two of them. The fur-mullet is a fiſh of that ſwiftnefs, that it was impoffible for the torpedo to take it by purſuit. It is probable, therefore, that by their electric ſtroke they ſtupify their prey ; yet the crab and ſea-leech will venture to annoy them. They will live 24 hours out of the fea; and but very little longer if placed in freſh water. They inha-bit fandy places ; and will bury themfelves ſuperſicially in it, by flinging the ſand over, by a quick flapping of all the extremities. It is in this ſituation that the tor-pedo gives his moſt forcible ſhock, which throws down the aſtoniſhed paffenger who inadvertently treads upon him. In our ſeas it grows to a great ſize, and above 80 pounds weight. The tail is thick and round ; the caudal fin broad and abrupt. The head and body, which are indiſtinct, are nearly round ; attenuating to extreme thinneſs on the edges ; below the body, the ventral fins form on each ſide a quarter of a circle. The two dorſal fins are placed on a trunk of the tail. The eyes are ſmall, placed near each other : behind each is a round ſpiracle, with fix ſmall cutaneous rags on their in-ner circumference. Mouth ſmall ; teeth minute, ſpicu-lar. Five openings to the gills, as in others of this ge-nus. The ſkin everywhere ſmooth ; cinereous brown above, white beneath. See further the article Elec-tricitv, n<hi rend="sup">o</hi>  258 — 261.</p><p>7.    The clavata, or thornback, is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the others by the rows of ſtrong ſharp ſpines diſ-poſed along the back and tail. In a large one ſeen by Mr Pennant, were three rows on the back, and five on the tail, all inclining towards its end. Οη the noſe, and on the inner ſide of the forehead, near the eyes, were a few ſpines, and others were ſcattered without any order on the upper part of the pectoral fins. The mouth was ſmall, and filled with granulated teeth : The upper part of the body was oſ a pale aſh colour, mark-ed with ſhort ſtreaks of black, and the ſkin rough, with ſmall tubercles like ſhagreen. The belly white, croffed with a ſtrong ſemilunar cartilage beneath the lkin : in general, the lower part was ſmooth, having only a few ſpines on each ſide. The young ſiſh have very few ſpines on them ; and their backs are often ſpotted with white, and each ſpot is encircled with black. This ſpecie-s frequents our ſandy ſhores; are very voracious, and feed on all forts of flat fiſh ; are particularly fond of herrings and ſand-eels ; and ſometimes eat cruſtaceous animals, ſuch as crabs. Thefe ſometimes weigh 14 or 15 pounds, but with us ſeldom exceed that freight. They begin to generate in June, and bring forth their young in Ju-Iy and Auguſt, which (as well as thofe of the ſkate) be-fore they are old enough to breed, are called <hi rend="italic">maids.</hi>  The thornback begins to be in ſeaſon in November, and con-tinues ſo later than the ſkate, but the young of both are good at all times of the year.</p><p>8.    The paſtinaca, or ſting ray, does not grow to the bulk of the others : The body is quite ſmooth, of ſhape almoſt round, and is of a much greater thickneſs and</p></body></text></TEI>
