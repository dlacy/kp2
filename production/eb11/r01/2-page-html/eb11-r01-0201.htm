<p><span class="font1">Hertogenbosch, Groningen, Haarlem, Maastricht, Middelburg and Utrecht.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Town archives are for the most part well preserved. Printed inventories generally exist, and in some cases, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> at Doesburg,&nbsp;the archives contain information as to the relations between the&nbsp;Hanse and England in the 14th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Dutch repositories have no administrative inter-connexion. Each archivist reports yearly to the archivist-in-chieí of the&nbsp;kingdom, and since 1878 these </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Verslagen omtrent Rijks oude Archieven</span><span class="font1"> have been printed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The English Public Record Office has four volumes of transcripts from Dutch archives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Italy.—The administration of the public records of the kingdom is attached to the Ministry of the Interior, for which office Signor&nbsp;Vazio published (1883) his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Relazione sugli archivi di stato italiani.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">There are seventeen repositories, representing the ancient divisions&nbsp;of the kingdom. The most important are the following:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Florence,</span><span class="font1"> containing records of the foreign correspondence of the dukes of Tuscany and the Florentine republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Genoa,</span><span class="font1"> records of the republic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Milan,</span><span class="font1"> records of the duchy, in particular the registers called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L'Archivio Panigarola.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Modena,</span><span class="font1"> records of the family of Este.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Naples,</span><span class="font1"> in particular the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cancelleria Angioina,</span><span class="font1"> records of the Angevin kings of Naples, containing documents relative to their&nbsp;extensive dominions in Provence, Anjou and elsewhere, for a&nbsp;bibliographical account of which see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Archives angevines de&nbsp;Naples; études sur les registres du Roi Charles I<sup>er</sup>,</span><span class="font1"> by Paul Durrieu.&nbsp;Naples also possesses the important </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archivio Farnesiano,</span><span class="font1"> mainly&nbsp;records of the duke of Parma, brought there by Charles I. of Bourbon&nbsp;on his accession to the throne of the Two Sicilies in 1735.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Palermo,</span><span class="font1"> the records of the island of Sicily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rome,</span><span class="font1"> the most important records of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archivio di Slato</span><span class="font1"> are those relating to the papal government which were not transferred&nbsp;to the Vatican in 1871.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Turin,</span><span class="font1"> the archives of the house of Savoy, especially the letters from envoys at foreign courts, a series of very important reports.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Venice,</span><span class="font1"> the convent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dei Frari</span><span class="font1"> contains probably the most interesting collection of records in Italy. Rawdon Brown, G.&nbsp;Cavendish Bentinek, and H. F. Brown have edited many of the&nbsp;principal documents relating to England in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers:&nbsp;Venetian</span><span class="font1"> (Record Office), which are still in progress. The Record&nbsp;Office also possesses two hundred and ten volumes of transcripts&nbsp;from Venetian archives, mostly the reports and correspondence&nbsp;of ambassadors, together with Rawdon Brown’s large collection&nbsp;of similar materials, mainly originals or early copies (see Report 46).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Vatican.</span><span class="font1">—For the history of the papal archives the work of H. Bresslau, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Handbuch der Urkundenlehre für Deutschland und&nbsp;Italien</span><span class="font1"> (Leipzig, 1889), may be consulted. The best English&nbsp;account is contained in an article in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">American Historical Review&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(October 1896), by C. H. Haskins. But certain of the prefaces&nbsp;to the Record Office Calendar mentioned below may be consulted;&nbsp;and the description given by Langlois and Stein </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(op. cit.)</span><span class="font1"> is useful.&nbsp;The Vatican archives have been open to students only since the&nbsp;year 1881. The chief portion of the collection is that called the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archivio Segreto,</span><span class="font1"> which may be divided into two heads, the original&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archivio Segreto</span><span class="font1"> and the archives added to it from Avignon, from&nbsp;the castle of St Angelo and from special offices such as the Consistory,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dataria Apostolica, Rota, Secretaria Brevium, Signatura Gratiae,&nbsp;Penitentiary,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Master of the Ceremonies.</span><span class="font1"> The records of the&nbsp;congregations of the Index, the Holy Office and the Propaganda&nbsp;are not usually accessible to students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since 1881 the importance of the archives has attracted to Rome many bands of students. Most European governments have&nbsp;arranged for the publication of records dealing with their own&nbsp;countries. The classes of documents that have received most&nbsp;attention arc the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Regesta,</span><span class="font1"> or registers of bulls and briefs, issued&nbsp;by the papal chancery; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Supplicationes,</span><span class="font1"> or petitions; and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nuntiaturae,</span><span class="font1"> or despatches received from the nuncios and instruc-tions sent to them. An account of the numerous publications&nbsp;will be found in the works already mentioned. Here it is only&nbsp;possible to mention the English publications. The Record Office&nbsp;in London has published one volume of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Petitions,</span><span class="font1"> 1342-1417,&nbsp;and a Calendar from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Regesta,</span><span class="font1"> which covers the period 1198-1431.&nbsp;The French government is publishing a complete Calendar of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Regesta</span><span class="font1"> up to the end of the 13th century. There are in the English&nbsp;Public Record Office one hundred and sixty-two volumes of transcripts&nbsp;from the Vatican archives arranged in two series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Norway.—The records of Norwav are preserved at Christiania, and include a collection of papers of Christian II., king of Denmark.&nbsp;For the contents of the collection, see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diplomatarium Norvegicum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">by Lange and Unger (1849-1891); and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Norske Rigsregistranter&nbsp;tildeels i uddrag,</span><span class="font1"> dealing with the 16th and 17th centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Portugal.—Portuguese royal records are in the monastery of São Bento at Lisbon. The collection suffered much during the&nbsp;earthquake of 1755. It includes the registers of the Chancery&nbsp;since the 13th century, and a large number of documents subsidiary&nbsp;to them. In addition to this repository there are collections at&nbsp;the various ministries; from the records of the Ministry for Foreign</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Affairs, Borges de Castro, and afterwards Judice Biker, published their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cοllecçãο dos Tratados . . . entre a Corona de Portugal e as&nbsp;mais potentias.</span><span class="font1"> There are three volumes of transcripts from&nbsp;Portuguese records in the English Public Record Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Russia.—The records of the Russian government are distributed in various repositories in Moscow ana St Petersburg. At the&nbsp;former are preserved the records of the foreign relations of Russia&nbsp;down to 1801; permission to use them can be obtained from the&nbsp;Minister for Foreign Affairs: there are no printed lists, but many&nbsp;in manuscript. At Moscow are also preserved the records of the&nbsp;Ministry of Justice. In vol. xliv. of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Revue historique</span><span class="font1"> (1890)&nbsp;there is an article by J.-J. Chemko and L.-M. Balffol on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Archives&nbsp;de l'empire russe à Moscow.</span><span class="font1"> The records of government offices&nbsp;at St Petersburg are not open to students. There are minor repositories at various provincial capitals, and the records of the Grand&nbsp;Duchy of Finland are at Helsingfors. There are three volumes&nbsp;of transcripts from Russian records at the English Public Record&nbsp;Office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Spain.—The nearest approach to a central Record Office for Spain is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archivo General Central,</span><span class="font1"> established by a royal ordinance of 1858 at Alcalá de Henares, near Madrid. The collection&nbsp;there includes, in addition to the general administrative records of&nbsp;the kingdom, valuable historical matter concerning the Inquisition,&nbsp;the Jesuits, and other subjects. There is also at Madrid a repository&nbsp;known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archivo Histórico Nacional,</span><span class="font1"> which contains the archives&nbsp;of crown lands and suppressed monasteries, with a printed inventory.&nbsp;The remaining records are distributed locally in separate repositories containing the archives of the old kingdoms. Those </span><span class="font0">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Castile are partly at Simancas and partly at Alcala de Henares.&nbsp;Those of Aragon are at Barcelona in the Palacio de los Condes.&nbsp;Those of Navarre are at Pamplona and difficult of access. The&nbsp;remainder are of small importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In addition to these there are two collections requiring notice, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archivo general de Indias</span><span class="font1"> at Seville and the papers of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Con-sulado del Mar</span><span class="font1"> at Bilbao.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The English Public Record Office is publishing a Calendar of the papers relating to England in Spanish and other connected archives.&nbsp;The introduction to the first volume, edited by C. Bergenroth,&nbsp;contains a sketch of the records used by him; and the series, under&nbsp;the successive editorship of Bergenroth, Don Pasquale de Gayangos&nbsp;and Major Martin Hume, now extends from the reign of Henry VIII.&nbsp;to the year 1603. The Record Office possesses sixty-five volumes&nbsp;of transcript from Spanish archives.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sweden.—The archives have not yet been centralized, and large collections exist at the various ministries. The most important&nbsp;records, however, are the Royal Archives </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rigsarchivet),</span><span class="font1"> preserved in the island of Riddarholmen, Stockholm. A great many publications have been based on these: there are for instance an&nbsp;inventory, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Middlelanden fran Svenska Rigsarchivet ;</span><span class="font1"> a work bearing&nbsp;generally on Scandinavian history, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Handlingar rorande Scandinnaviens historia</span><span class="font1"> ; and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Diplomatarium Suecicum,</span><span class="font1"> which is still&nbsp;in progress. The English Record Office has seven volumes of&nbsp;transcripts from the Stockholm archives, with a report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Private collections are numerous and valuable, and a society for exploring and publishing such records is supported by the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Switzerland.—The Swiss records are of two kinds: records of the confederation, and records of the several cantons. The first&nbsp;are in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bιιndes-Archiv</span><span class="font1"> at Berne, and date from 1798; see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">General&nbsp;Repertorium der Acten des helvetischen Centralarchivs in Bern,&nbsp;1798-1803,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Schweizerisches Urkunden-Register,</span><span class="font1"> by B. Hidber,&nbsp;vol. ii. (Berne, 1877). The Cantonal records, some of them of&nbsp;very early date, are at the chief town of each canton, and for the&nbsp;most part are provided with manuscript inventories. For those&nbsp;of Geneva, see also </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Archives de Geneve,</span><span class="font1"> edited by F. Turrettini&nbsp;and A. C. Grivel (1877). For the records of the Abbey of St Gall,&nbsp;see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Urkundenbuch der Abtei St Gallen,</span><span class="font1"> edited by H. Wartmanne&nbsp;(1863-1882); and for those of Zurich, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Urkundenbuch der Stadt und&nbsp;Landschaft Zürich,</span><span class="font1"> by P. Schweitzer and E. Escher (1889-1892).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are in the English Public Record Office five volumes of transcripts from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Βundes-Archiv.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">United States of America</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The records, among which transcripts made in England, France, and Holland hold an important place, may be divided into: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Federal,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">kept at Washington ; those in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">private collections</span><span class="font1"> ; and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Records&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">at the various state capitals. The publication and care of all&nbsp;these are often the work of private bodies subsidized or recognized&nbsp;by government. Thus, although </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Federal archives</span><span class="font1"> are now centralized&nbsp;under the charge of the head of the division of Manuscripts in the&nbsp;Library of Congress, which office is acquiring important collections&nbsp;of the papers of former presidents, and may also have transferred&nbsp;to it departmental records not in current use, publication of guides&nbsp;is the concern of the historical section of the Carnegie Institution&nbsp;and of the Archives Commission of the Historical Association.&nbsp;The same association explores </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">private collections</span><span class="font1"> through its Historical Manuscripts Commission; and numerous societies publish&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">state records.</span><span class="font1"> Some states, however, have themselves published&nbsp;American and European documents relating to their history;&nbsp;and mention must be made of the large series of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">American Archives&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State Papers</span><span class="font1"> published from 1832 onwards by Congress.</span></p>
