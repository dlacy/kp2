<p><span class="font0">The permanency of the next reach requires that its axis ſhall be in the direction of the line EP which&nbsp;makes the angle GEP=FEN. If the next reach&nbsp;has the direction EQ, MR, the wave reflected in the&nbsp;line ES will work on the bank at S, and will be reflected in the line ST, and work again on the oppoſite bank at T. We know that the effect of the ſuperſicial motion is great, and that it is the principal&nbsp;agent in deſtroying the banks of canals. So ſar therefore Mr Buat is right. We cannot ſay with any pre-ciſion or confidence how the actions of the under filaments are modified ; but we know no reaſon for not&nbsp;extending to the under filaments what appears ſo probable with reſpect to the ſurface water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third poſition is no leſs evident. We do not&nbsp;know the mode of action of the water on the bank ;&nbsp;but our general notions on this ſubject, confirmed by&nbsp;common experience, tell us that the more obliquely&nbsp;a ſtream of water beats on any bank, the leſs it tends to&nbsp;undermine it or waſh it away. A ſtiff and coheſive&nbsp;foil therefore will ſuffer no more from being almoſt&nbsp;perpendicularly buffetted by a ſtream than a friable&nbsp;fand would ſuffer from water gliding along its face.&nbsp;Mr Buat thinks, from experience, that a clay bank is&nbsp;not ſenſibly affected till the angle FEB is about 36&nbsp;degrees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since there are cauſes of retardation, and we ſtill&nbsp;ſuppoſe that the diſcharge is kept up, and that the mean&nbsp;velocity, which had been diminiſhed by the enlargement of the ſection, is again reſtored, we muſt grant&nbsp;that there is provided, in the mechaniſm of theſe motions, an accelerating force adequate to this effect.&nbsp;There can be no accelerating force in an open ſtream&nbsp;but the ſuperſicial ſlope. In the preſent caſe it is undoubtedly ſo 5 becauſe by the deepening of the bottom&nbsp;where there is an elbow in the ſtream, we have of neceſſity a counter ſlope. Now, all this head of water,&nbsp;which muſt produce the augmentation of velocity in&nbsp;that part of the ſtream which ranges round the convex&nbsp;bank, will ariſe from the check which the water gets&nbsp;from the concave bank. This occaſions a gorge or&nbsp;ſwell up the ſtream, enlarges a little the ſection at&nbsp;BVC; and this, by the principle of uniform motion,&nbsp;will augment all the velocities, deepen the channel,&nbsp;and put every thing again into its train as ſoon as the&nbsp;water gets into the next reach. The water at the bottom of this baſon has very little motion, but it defends&nbsp;the bottom by this very circumſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such are the notions which Mr de Buat entertains of this part of the mechaniſm of running waters. We&nbsp;cannot ſay that they are very ſatisfactory, and they are&nbsp;very oppoſite to the opinions commonly entertained on&nbsp;the ſubject. Moſt perſons think that the motion is moſt&nbsp;rapid and turbulent on ' the ſide of the concave bank,&nbsp;and that it is owing to this that the bank is worn away&nbsp;till it become perpendicular, and that the oppoſite bank&nbsp;is flat, becauſe it has not been gnawed away in this&nbsp;manner. With reſpect to this general view of the matter, theſe perſons may be in the right ; and when a&nbsp;ſtream is turned into a crooked and yielding channel for&nbsp;the firſt time, this is its manner of action. But Mr&nbsp;Buat’s aim is to inveſtigate the circumſtauces which obtain in the caſe of a regimen ; and in this view he is&nbsp;undoubtedly right as to the facts, though his mode of&nbsp;accounting for theſe facts may be erroneous. And as</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">this is the only uſeful view to be taken of the ſubject, it ought chiefly to be attended to in all our attempts to&nbsp;procure ſtability to the bed of a river, without the ex-penlive helps of mafonry, &amp;c. If we attempt to ſecure permanency by deepening on the inſide of the elbow, our bank will undoubtedly crumble down, diminiſh the paſſage, and occaſion a more violent action on&nbsp;the hollow bank. The moſt effectual mean of fecurity&nbsp;is to enlarge the ſection : and if we do this on the inſide bank, we muſt do it by widening the ſtream very&nbsp;much, that we may give a very Hoping bank. Our attention is commonly drawn to it when the hollow bank&nbsp;is giving way, and with a view to ſtop the ravages of&nbsp;the ſtream. Things are not now in a ſtate of permanency, but nature is working in her own way to bring&nbsp;it about. <sup>r</sup>Γhis may not fuit </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">our</span><span class="font0"> purpoſe, and we muſt&nbsp;thwart her. The phenomena which we then obſerve&nbsp;are frequently very unlike to thoſe deſcribed in the preceding paragraphs. We ſee a violent tumbling motion&nbsp;in the ſtream towaιds the hollow bank. We ſee an&nbsp;evident accumulation of water on that ſide, and the&nbsp;point B is frequently higher than C. This regorging&nbsp;of the water extends to ſome diſtance, and is of itſelf&nbsp;a cauſe of greater velocity, and contributes, like a head&nbsp;of ſtagnant water, to force the ſtream through the bend,&nbsp;and to deepen the bottom. This is clearly the caſe&nbsp;when the velocity is exceſſive, and the hollow bank&nbsp;able to abide the ſhock. In this ſituation the water&nbsp;thus heaped up eſcapes where it beſt can ; and as the&nbsp;water, obſtructed by an obſtaele put in its way, eſcapes&nbsp;by the ſides, and there has its velocity increaſed, ſo here&nbsp;the water gorged up againſt the hollow bank ſwells over&nbsp;towards the oppoſite ſide, and paſſes round the convex&nbsp;bank with an increaſed velocity. It depends much on&nbsp;the adjuſtment between the velocity and conſequent accumulation, and the breadth of the ſtream and the&nbsp;angle of the elbow, whether this augmentation of velocity ſhall reach the convex bank ; and we ſometimes&nbsp;ſee the motion very languid in that place, and even depoſitions of mud and land are made there. The whole&nbsp;phenomena are too complicated to be accurately deſcribed in general terms, even in the caſe of perfect regimen : for this regimen is relative to the conſiſtence&nbsp;of the channel; and when this is very great, the motions&nbsp;may be moſt violent in every quarter. But the preceding obſervations are of importance, becauſe they&nbsp;relate to ordinary caſes and to ordinary channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is evident, from Mr Buat’s ſecond poſition,'that the proper form of an elbow depends on the breadth&nbsp;of the ſtream as well as on the radius of curvature, and&nbsp;that every angle of elbow will require a certain proportion between the width of the river and the radius of&nbsp;the ſweep. Mr Buat gives rules and formulæ for all&nbsp;theſe purpoſes, and ſhows that in one ſweep there may&nbsp;be more than one reflection or rebound. It is needleſs&nbsp;to enlarge on this matter of mere geometrical diſcuſſion.&nbsp;It is with the view of enabling the engineer to trace&nbsp;the windings of a river in ſuch a manner that there ſhall&nbsp;be no rebounds which ſhall direct the ſtream againſt&nbsp;the ſides, but preſerve it always in the axis of every&nbsp;reach. This is of conſequence, even when the bends of&nbsp;the river are to be ſecured by maſonry or piling ; for&nbsp;we have ſeen the neceſſity of increaſing the ſection, and&nbsp;the tendency which the waters have to deepen the channel on that ſide where the rebound is made. This tends</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
