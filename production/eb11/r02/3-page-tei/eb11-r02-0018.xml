The antlers of females are simple and generally smaller. The muzzle is entirely hairy; the ears and tail are short; and the throat is maned. The coat is unspotted at all ages, with a whitish area in the region of the tail. The main hoofs are short and rounded and the lateral hoofs very large. There is a tarsal, but no metatarsal gland and tuft. In the skull the gland-pit is shallow, and the vacuity of moderate size; the nasal bones are well developed, and much expanded at the upper end. Upper canines are wanting; the cheek-teeth are small and low-crowned, with the third lobe of the last molar in the lower jaw minute. The lateral metacarpal bones are represented only by their lower extremities; the importance of this feature being noticed in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Deer.</hi></p><p>In spite of the existence of a number of more or less well-marked geographical forms, reindeer from all parts of the northern hemisphere present such a marked similarity that it seems preferable to regard them as all belonging to a single widespread species, of which most of the characters will be the same as those of the genus. American naturalists, however, generally regard these as distinct species. The coat is remarkable for its density and compactness; the general colour of the head.and upper parts being clove-brown, with more or less white or whitish grey on the under parts and inner surfaces of the limbs, w hile there is also some white above the hoofs and on the muzzle, and there may be whitish rings round the eyes; there is a white area in the region of the tail, which includes the sides but not the upper surface of the latter ; and the tarsal tuft is generally white. The antlers are smooth, and brownish white in colour, but the hoofs jet black. Albino varieties occasionally occur in the wild state. A height of 4 ft. io in. at the shoulder has been recorded in the case of one race.</p><p>The wild Scandinavian reindeer <hi rend="italic">(Rangifer tarandus)</hi>  may be regarded as the typical form of the species. It is a smaller animal than the American woodland race, with antlers approximating to those of the barren-ground race, but less elongated, and with a distinct back-tine in the male, the brow-tines moderately palmated and frequently nearly symmetrical, and the bez-tine not excessively expanded. Female antlers are generally much smaller than those of males, although occasionally as large, but with much fewer points. The antlers make their appearance at an unusually early age.</p><p>Mr Madison Grant considers that American reindeer, or caribou, may be grouped under two types, one represented by the barren-ground caribou R. <hi rend="italic">tarandus arcticus,</hi>  which is a small animal with immense antlers characterized by the length of the beam, and the consequent wide separation of the terminal palmation from the brow-tine; and the other by the woodland-caribou <hi rend="italic">(R. t. caribou), </hi>which is a larger animal with shorter and more massiye antlers, in which the great terminal expansions are in approximation to the brow-tine owing to the shortness of the beam. Up to 1902 seven other American races had been described, four of which are grouped by Grant with the first and three with the second type. Some of these forms are, however, more or less intermediate between the two main types, as is a pair of antlers from Novaia Zemlia described by the present writer as <hi rend="italic">R. t. pearsoni,</hi>  The Scandinavian reindeer is identified by Mr Grant with the barren-ground type.</p><p>Reindeer are domesticated by the Lapps and other nationalities of northern Europe and Asia, to whom these animals are all-important. Domesticated reindeer have also been introduced into Alaska.</p><p>See Madison Grant, “ The Caribou,” <hi rend="italic">7th Annual Report, New York Zoological Society</hi>  (1902); J. G.

At the age of eleven he made his first appearance as a pianist, and when scarcely eighteen he went on a successful tour through Denmark and Sweden. After a stay in Leipzig, where he studied under Mendelssohn and under Schumann, Reinecke went on tour with Konigslow and Wasielewski, Schumann’s biographer, in North Germany and Denmark. From 1846 to 1848 Reinecke was court pianist to Christian VIII. of Denmark. After resigning this post he went first to Paris, and next to Cologne, as professor in the Con-servatorium. From 1854 to 1859 he was music director at Barmen, in the latter year filling this post at Breslau University;</p><p>in i860 he became conductor of the famous Leipzig Gewandhaus, a post which (together with that of professor at the Conserva-torium) he held with honour and distinction for thirty-five years. He finally retired into private life in 1902 and died in March 1910. During this time Reinecke continually made concert tours to England and elsewhere. His pianoforte playing belonged to a school now almost extinct. Grace and neatness were its characteristics, and at one time Reinecke was probably unrivalled as a Mozart player and an accompanist. His grand opera <hi rend="italic">König Manfred,</hi>  and the comic opera <hi rend="italic">Auf hohen Befehl, </hi>were at one time frequently played in Germany; and his cantata <hi rend="italic">Hakon Jarl</hi>  is melodiously beautiful, as are many of his songs; while his Friedensfeier overture was once quite hackneyed. By far his most valuable works are those written for educational purposes. His sonatinas, his “ Kindergarten ” and much that he has ably edited will keep his name alive.</p><p>REINHART, CHARLES STANLEY (1844-1896), American painter and illustrator, was bom at Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, and after having been employed in railway work and at a steel factory, studied art in Paris and at the Munich Academy under Straehuber and Otto. He afterwards settled in New York, but spent the years 1882-1886 in Paris. He was a regular exhibitor at the National Academy in New York, and contributed illustrations in black and white and in colours to the leading American periodicals. He died in 1896. Among his best-known pictures are: “ Reconnoitring,” “ Caught Napping,” “ September Morning,” “ Mussel Fisherwoman,” “ At the Ferry,” “ Normandy Coast,” “ Gathering Wood,” “ The Old Life Boat,” “ Sunday,” and “ English Garden but it is as an illustrator that he is best known.'</p><p>REINHART, JOACHIM CHRISTIAN (1761-1847), German painter and etcher, was bom at Hof in Bavaria in 1761, and studied under Oeser at Leipzig and under Klingel at Dresden. In 1789 he went to Rome, where he became a follower of the classicist German painters Carstens and Koch. He devoted himself more particularly to landscape painting and to aquatint engraving. Examples of his landscapes are to be found at most of the important German galleries, notably at Frankfort, Munich, Leipzig and Gotha. In Rome he executed a series of landscape frescoes for the Villa MassimL He died in Rome in 1847.</p><p>REINHOLD, KARL LEONHARD (1758-1823), German philosopher, was bom at Vienna. At the age of fourteen he entered the Jesuit college of St Anna, on the dissolution of which (1774) he joined a similar college of the order of St Barnabas. Finding himself out of sympathy with monastic life, he fled in 1783 to North Germany, and settled in Weimar, where he became Wieland's <hi rend="italic">collaborateur</hi>  on the <hi rend="italic">German Mercury,</hi>  and eventually his son-in-law. In the <hi rend="italic">German Mercury</hi>  he published, in the years 1786-87, his <hi rend="italic">Briefe Über die Kantische Philosophie, </hi>which were most important in making Kant known to a wider circle of readers. As a result of the <hi rend="italic">Letters,</hi>  Reinhold received a call to the university of Jena, where he taught from 1787 to 1794. In 1789 he published his chief work, the <hi rend="italic">Versuch einer neuen Theorie des menschlichen Vorstellungsvermögens,</hi>  in which he attempted to simplify the Kantian theory and make it more of a unity. In 1794 he accepted a call to Kiel, where he taught till his death in 1823, but his independent activity was at an end. In later life he was powerfully influenced by Fichte, and subsequently, on grounds of religious feeling, by Jacobi and Bardili. His historical importance belongs entirely to his earlier activity. The development of the Kantian standpoint contained in the “ New Theory of Human Understanding ” (1789), and in the <hi rend="italic">Fundament des philosophischen Wissens</hi>  (1791), was called by its author <hi rend="italic">Elementarphilosophie.</hi></p><p>, “ Reinhold lays greater emphasis than Kant upon the unity and activity of consciousness. The principle of consciousness tells us that every idea is related both to an object and a subject, and is partly to be distinguished, partly united to both. Since form cannot produce matter nor subject object, we are forced to assume a thing-in-itself. But this is a notion which Js self-contradictory if consciousness be essentially a relating activity.
