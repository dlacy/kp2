<p><span class="font0">the barbarians who ſurrounded it kept it in continual alarms. They were frequently repulſed'into their native wilds, but they as certainly returned with freſh&nbsp;rage and increaſed ferocity. The Goths and Vandals,&nbsp;finding the emperor engaged in quelling domeſtic diſputes, renewed their accuſtomed inroads, and once more&nbsp;felt the puniſhment of their preſumptions. They were&nbsp;conquered in ſeveral engagements ; and Probus returned in triumph to Rome. His active temper, however,&nbsp;would not ſuffer him to continue at reſt whilſt a ſingle&nbsp;enemy was left to conquer. In his laſt expedition he&nbsp;led his ſoldiers againſt the Perſians ; and going through&nbsp;Sirmium, the place of his nativity, he there employed&nbsp;ſeveral thouſands of his ſoldiers in draining a fen that&nbsp;was incommodious to the inhabitants. The fatigues of&nbsp;this undertaking, and the great reſtraint that was laid&nbsp;upon the ſoldiers licentious manners, produced a conſpiracy, which ended in his ruin : for taking the opportunity as he was marching into Greece, they ſet upon and flew him after he had reigned ſix years and four&nbsp;months with general approbation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Carus, who was prætorian prefect to the deceaſed emperor, was choſen by the army to ſucceed him; and&nbsp;he, to ſtrengthen his authority, named his two ſons&nbsp;Carinus and Numerianus with him in command ; the&nbsp;former of whom was as much ſullied by his vices, as&nbsp;the youngeſt was virtuous, modeſt, and courageous.&nbsp;The new emperor had ſcarce time to puniſh the murderers of the late monarch, when he was alarmed by a&nbsp;freſh irruption of the Sarmatians ; over whom he gained a ſignal victory. The Perſian monarch alſo made&nbsp;ſome attempts upon the empire ; but Carus aſſured his&nbsp;ambaſſadors, that if their maſter perſiſted in his obſtinacy, all his fields ſhould ſhortly be as bare as his own&nbsp;bald head, which he ſhowed them. In conſequence of&nbsp;this threat, he n,arched to the very walls of Cteſiphon,&nbsp;and a dreadful battle enſuing, he once more gained a&nbsp;complete victory. What the reſult of this ſucceſs&nbsp;might have been, is not known ; for he was ſhortly after ſtruck dead by lightning in his tent, with many&nbsp;.others that were round him. Numerianus, the youngeſt ſon, who accompanied his father in this expedition,&nbsp;was inconſolable for his death; and brought ſuch a diſorder upon his eyes with weeping, that he was obliged&nbsp;to be carried along with the army, ſhut up in a cloſe&nbsp;litter. The peculiarity of his ſituation, after ſome time,&nbsp;excited the ambition of Aper, his father-in-law, who&nbsp;ſuppoſed that he could now, without any great danger,&nbsp;aim at the empire himſelf. He therefore hired a mercenary villain to murder the emperor in his litter ; and&nbsp;the better to conceal the fact, gave out that he was ſtill&nbsp;alive, but unable to endure the light. In this manner&nbsp;was the dead body carried about for ſome days, Aper&nbsp;continuing to attend it with the utmoſt appearance of&nbsp;reſpect, and to take orders as uſual. The offenſiveneſs,&nbsp;however, of its ſmell at length diſcovered the treachery,&nbsp;and excited an univerſal uproar throughout the army.&nbsp;In the midſt of this tumult, Diocleſian, one of the moſt&nbsp;noted commanders of his time, was choſen emperor,&nbsp;3nd with his own hand flew Aper ; having thus, as it&nbsp;is ſaid, fulfilled a prophecy, which had ſaid, that Dio-eleſian ſhould be emperor after he had ſlain*a boar ; alluding to the name of his rival, which ſigniſies· a boar.&nbsp;Garinus, the remaining ſon, did not long ſurvive hie&nbsp;fa,ther and. brother j for giving himſelf up&quot; to his vices,&nbsp;and yet at the ſame time oppoſing the new-made emperor, the competitors led their forces into Mæfia ;&nbsp;where Diocleſian being victorious, Carinus was ſlain by&nbsp;a tribune of his own army, whoſe wife he had formerly&nbsp;abuſed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Diocleſian was a perſon of mean birth ; being accounted, according to ſome, the ſon of a ſcrivener ; and of a ſlave, according to others. He received his name&nbsp;from Dioclea, H.e town in which he was born ; and&nbsp;was about 40 years old when he was elected to the&nbsp;empire. He pardoned all who had joined Carinus,&nbsp;without injuring either their fortunes or honours. Conſcious alſo that the weight of empire was too heavy for&nbsp;one alone to ſuſtain, he took in Maximian, his general,&nbsp;as a partner in the fatigues of duty, making him his&nbsp;equal and companion on the throne. Thus mutually&nbsp;aſſiſting each other, theſe two continued to live in ſtrict&nbsp;friendſhip ; and though ſomewhat differing in temper&nbsp;(as Maximian was rather.aman of vicious inclinations),&nbsp;yet they concurred in promoting the general good, and&nbsp;humbling their enemies- And it muſt be obſerved, that&nbsp;there never was a period in which there were more numerous or formidable enemies to oppoſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The peafants and labourers in Gaul made a dangerous inſurrection, under the conduct of Amandus and Helianus, but were ſubdued by Maximian. Achilleus,&nbsp;who commanded in Egypt, proclaimed himſelf emperor ; and it was not without many bloody engagements that he was overcome, and condemned by Diocleſian to be devoured by lions. In Africa, the Roτ&nbsp;man legions, in like manner, joined with many of the&nbsp;natives, ſeized upon the public revenues, and plundered&nbsp;thoſe who continued in their duty. Theſe were alſo&nbsp;ſubdued by Maximian ; and, after a long dubious war<sub>r&nbsp;</sub>conſtrained to ſue for peace. About the ſame time, a.&nbsp;principal commander in Britain, named </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Carattjius,</span><span class="font0"> proclaimed himſelf emperor, and poſſeſſed himſelf of the&nbsp;iſland. To oppoſe this general’s claims, Maximianmade choice of Conſtantius Chlorus, whom he created:&nbsp;Cæſar, and married to Theodora his daughter-in-law.&nbsp;He, upon his arrival in Britain, finding Carauſius very&nbsp;ſtrong, and continually reinforced from Germany,,&nbsp;thought proper to come to an accommodation ; io that&nbsp;this uſurper continued for ſeven years in quiet poſſeſſion&nbsp;of the whole iſland, till he was ſlain by Alectus, his&nbsp;friend and intimate. About this time alſo, Narſes,&nbsp;king of Perſia, began a dangerous war upon the empire,&nbsp;and invaded Meſopotamia. To ſtop the progreſs of the&nbsp;enemy upon this quarter, Diocleſian made choice of Ga-lerius (ſurnamed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Armentarius,</span><span class="font0"> from the report of his&nbsp;being born of a cow-herd in Dacia) ; and he likewiſe&nbsp;was created Cæſar. His ſucceſs alſo, though very,&nbsp;doubtful in the beginning, was in the end terminated&nbsp;according to his wiſhes. The Perſians were overcome&nbsp;in a deciſive engagement, their camp plundered and ta,&nbsp;ken, and their king’s wives and children made priſoners&nbsp;of war. There only remained, of all the enemies of&nbsp;the Roman empire, thoſe who lay to the northward un?&nbsp;ſubdued. Theſe were utterly unconquerable, as well&nbsp;upon account of their ſavage fierceneſs, as the inholpi-table ſeverity of the climate and ſoil ſrom whence they&nbsp;iſſued. Ever at war with the Romans, they iſſued&nbsp;forth, when the armies that were to repreſs their inva-fions were called away ; and upon their return, they as&nbsp;ſuddenly withdrew into cαld<sub>i</sub> barren, and inacceſſible</span></p>
