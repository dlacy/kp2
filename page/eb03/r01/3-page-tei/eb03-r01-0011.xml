The confequence of this muſt be, that as the action of the ſolar light continues to bring down the electric matter, and the earth continues to difcharge an equal quantity of it into the atmoſphere, ſome part of the atmoſphere muſt at laſt become overloaded with it, and attempt to throw it back into the earth. This attempt wiſl be vain, until a vent is found for the electricity at ſome other place ; and as foon as this happens, the electrified atmoſphere begins to throw off its ſuperfluous electricity, and the earth to receive it. As the atmoſphere itſelf is a bad conductor, and the more ſo the drier it is, the electric matter attacks the ſmaſl aqueous particles which are detained in it by means of the latent heat. Thefe being unable to bear the im-petus of the fluid, throw out their latent heat, which eaſily eſcapes, and thus makes a kind of vacuum in the electrified part of the atmoſphere. The conſequences of this are, that the aqueous particles being driven together in large quantity, at laſt become vi-ſible, and the <hi rend="italic">jky</hi>  is covered with clouds ; at the fame time a wind blows againſt thefe clouds, and, if there is no reſiſtance in the atmoſphere, wiſl drive them away.</p><p>7.    But if the atmofphere all round the cloud is ex-cεedingly electrified, and the earth is in no condition to receive the ſuperfluous fluid excepting in that place ■which is directly under the cloud, then the whole electricity of the atmofphere for a vaſt way round wiſl tend to that part only, and the cloud wiſl be electrified to an extreme degree. A wind wiſl now blow againſt the cloud from all quarters, more and more of the vapour wiſl be extricated from the air by the electric matter, and the cloud wiſl become darker and thicker, at the ſame time that it is' in a manner ſtationary, as· being acted upon by oppoſite winds ; though its ſize is enlarged with great rapidity by the continual ſupplies of vapour brought by the winds.</p><p>8.    The vapours which were formerly ſuſpended in-viſibly by means of the latent heat are now ſuſpended viſibly by the electric fluid, which wiſl not let them" fall to the earth, until it is in a condition to rε-ceive the electric matter deſcending with the rain.— It is eaſy to ſee, however, that thus every thing is prepared for a violent ſtorm of thunder and lightning as well as rain. The ſurface of the earth becomes electrified from the atmoſphere : but when this has con-tinued for ſome time, a zone of earth conſiderably below the ſurface acquires an electricity oppoſite to that of the clouds and atmoſphere ; of conſequence the elec-tricity in the cloud being violently preſſed on aſl ſides, wiſl at laſt burſt out towards that zone where the re-ſiſtance is leaſt, as explained under the article Light-ning.—The vapours now having loſt that which ſup-ported them, wiſl fall down in rain, if there is not a ſufficient quantity of electric matter to keep them in the ſame ſtate in which they were before : but if this happens to be the cafe, the cloud wiſl inſtantly be charged again, while little or no rain wiſl faſl ; and hence very violent thunder fometimes takes place with-</p><p>out any rain at aſl, or ſuch as is quite inconfiderable in quantity.</p><p>9. when the electricity is leſs violent, the rain wilI deſcend in vaſt quantity, efpecially after every flaih of lightning ; and great quantities of electric matter wiſl thus be conveyed to the earth, inſomuch that ſometimes the drops have been obſerved to ſhine as if they were on fire, which has given occaſion to the reports of fiery rain having fallen on certain occaſions. If the quantity of electric matter is ſmaller, ſo that the rain can convey it all gradually to the ground, there wiſl be rain without any thunder ; and the greater the quantity of electricity the more violent wiſl be the rain.</p><p>From this account of the cauſes of rain, we may ſee the reaſon why in warm climates the rains are exceffive, and for the moſt part accompanied with thun-der ; for there the electricity of the atmoſphere is im-menfely greater than it is with us. we may alld fee why in certain places, according to the ſituation of mountains, ſeas, &amp;c. the rains will be greater than in others, and likewiſe why fome parts of the world are exempted from rain altogether ; but as a particular diſcuſſion of thefe would neceſſarily include an explana-tion of the cauſes and phenomena of Thunder, we ſhall foi this reaſon refer the whole to be treated of under that article.</p><p>whether this theory be juſt, however, it would be too ⅛ affuming in us to ſay. It may admit of difpute, for we muſt grant that in the very beſt ſyſtems, though an occur-rence ſo frequent, the theory of rain is but very imperfectly underſtood. Dr James Hutton, Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, whofe ſpeculations are always ingenious, though generally extraordinary, and much out of the common way, gives us a new theory of rain in the firſt volume of the Tranſactions of that ſociety. It is well known that atmoſpheric air is capable of diſſolving, with a certain degree of heat, a gi-ven quantity of water. The Doctor aſcertains the ra-tio of the diſſolving power of air, in relation to water, in different degrees of heat ; and ſhows, that by mixing a portion of tranfparent humid warm air with a portion of cold air, the mixture becomes opake, and part of the water wiſl be precipitated ; or, in other words, the va-pour yfill be condenſed into rain. The ratio which he ſtates, however, does not appear to us to be ſupported by experience. whether the electricity of the air changes in conſequence of its depoſiting the water diſ-ſolved in it, or the change is a caufe of this depoſition, muſt remain uncertain ; but, in either view, there muſt be an agent different from heat and cold, ſince the changes in theſe reſpects do not in other operations change the ſtate of electricity. Dr Hutton ſuppoſes that heat and folution do not increaſe by equal increments ; but that, in reality, if heat be ſuppoſed to in-creaſe by equal increments along a ſtraight line, ſolution wiſl be expreſſed by ordinates to a curve whoſe convex ſide is turned towards that line. That the power of ſolution is not increaſed in the ſame ratio with heat, is, however, hypothetical, except when we riſe pretty high in the ſcale, when its proportional increaſe is a littler doubtful ; and it is not, in this paper, fupported by ex-periment. The condenſation of the breath in air is not an obſervation in point, except in air already ſaturated with vapour. It can amount, in any view, to no more than this, that to render it viſible, the heat muſt be di-</p></body></text></TEI>
