Many such ports have been&nbsp;provided on several German and North American rivers;&nbsp;where the port, being near a town, is lined with quay walls,&nbsp;it can also be used for river traffic, a plan adopted at the refuge&nbsp;port on the Main just below Frankfort (fig. 8).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Regulalion of Riversfor Navigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As rivers flow onward towards the sea, they experience a considerable diminution in their fall, and a progressive increase&nbsp;in the basin which they drain, owing to the successive influx&nbsp;of their various tributaries. Thus gradually their current&nbsp;becomes more gentle and their discharge larger in volume&nbsp;and less subject to abrupt variations; and, consequently,&nbsp;they become more suitable for navigation. Eventually, large&nbsp;rivers, under favourable conditions, often furnish important&nbsp;natural highways for inland navigation in the lower portion&nbsp;of their course, as, for instance, the Rhine, the Danube and&nbsp;the Mississippi; and works are only required for preventing&nbsp;changes in the course of the stream, for regulating its depth,&nbsp;and especially for fixing the low-water channel and concentrating the flow in it, so as to increase as far as practicable&nbsp;the navigable depth at the lowest stage of the water-level.&nbsp;Regulation works for increasing the navigable capabilities of&nbsp;rivers can only be advantageously undertaken in large rivers&nbsp;with a moderate fall and a fair discharge at their lowest stage;&nbsp;for with a large fall the current presents a great impediment&nbsp;to up-stream navigation, and there are generally great variations in water-level, and when the discharge becomes very&nbsp;small in the dry season it is impossible to maintain a sufficient&nbsp;depth of water in the low-water channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Removal of Shoals.—</span><span class="font0">The possibility of securing uniformity of depth in a river by the lowering of the shoals obstructing the channel&nbsp;depends upon the nature of the shoals. A soft shoal in the bed of&nbsp;a river is- due to deposit from a diminution in velocity of flow,&nbsp;produced by a reduction in fall and by a widening of the channel,&nbsp;or to a loss in concentration of the scour of the main current in passing&nbsp;over from one concave bank to the next on the opposite side. The&nbsp;lowering of such a shoal by dredging merely effects a temporary&nbsp;deepening, for it soon forms again from the causes which produced&nbsp;it. The removal, moreover, of the rocky obstructions at rapids,&nbsp;though increasing the depth and equalizing the flow at these places,&nbsp;produces a lowering of the river above the rapids by facilitating the&nbsp;efflux, which may result in the appearance of fresh shoals at the&nbsp;low stage of the river. Where, however, narrow rocky reefs or&nbsp;other hard shoals stretch across the bottom of a river and present&nbsp;obstacles to the erosion by the current of the soft materials forming&nbsp;the bed of the river above and below, their removal may prove a&nbsp;permanent improvement by enabling the river to deepen its bed by&nbsp;natural scour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The deepening of the bed of a non-tidal river along a considerable length by dredging merely lowers the water-level of the river during&nbsp;the low stage; and though this deepening facilitates the passage&nbsp;of floods in the first instance, it does not constitute a permanent&nbsp;improvisment even in this respect, for the deposit of the detritus&nbsp;brought down by the river as the floods abate soon restores the&nbsp;river to its original condition. Nevertheless, where sand-banks&nbsp;obstruct and divert the low-state channel of a river at its low stage,&nbsp;as in parts of the Mississippi below Cairo, it has been found possible&nbsp;before the river has fallen to its lowest level to form a channel&nbsp;through these sand-banks, with a depth of 9 or 10 ft. and 250 ft.&nbsp;wide, by suction dredgers, aided by revolving cutters or water-jets&nbsp;(see Dredging), which discharge the sand through floating tubes&nbsp;into a part of the river away from the channel ; and the navigation&nbsp;can thus be maintained throughout the low stage at a reasonable&nbsp;cost. Though, however, these channels across the shoals, connecting the deeper parts of the river, can be easily kept open on the&nbsp;Mississippi till the return of the floods, they are obliterated by the&nbsp;currents in flood-time, and have to be dredged out again afresh&nbsp;every year on the abatement of the floods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Regulation of the Low-Water Channel.—</span><span class="font0">The capability of a river to provide a waterway for navigation during the summer or throughout&nbsp;the dry season depends upon the depth that can be secured in the&nbsp;channel at the lowest stage. Owing to the small discharge and&nbsp;deficiency in scour during this period, it is important to restrict&nbsp;the width of the low-water channel, and concentrate the flow in it,&nbsp;and also to fix its position so that, forming the deepest part of the&nbsp;bed along, the line of the strongest current, it may be scoured out&nbsp;every year by the floods, instead of remaining an undefined and&nbsp;shifting channel. This is effected by closing subsidiary low-water&nbsp;channels with dikes across them,, and narrowing the channel at the&nbsp;low stage by low-dipping cross dikes extended from the river banks&nbsp;down the slope, and pointing slightly up-stream so as to direct the&nbsp;water flowing over them into a central channel (figs. 4 and 5).&nbsp;The contraction also of the channel is often still more effectually&nbsp;accomplished at some parts, though at a greater cost, by low</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">longitudinal dikes placed along either side of the low-water channel, some distance forward from the banks but connected with them&nbsp;generally at intervals by cross dikes at the back to prevent the&nbsp;current from scouring out a channel behind them during floods&nbsp;(figs. 4 and 6). By raising these dikes only slightly above the&nbsp;surface of the bed of the river, except where it is expedient to&nbsp;produce accretion for closing an old. disused channel or rectifying&nbsp;the course of the river, the capacity of the channel for discharging&nbsp;floods is not affected; for the slight obstruction to the flow produced by the dikes at the sides is fully compensated for by the&nbsp;deepening of the low-water channel in the central course of the&nbsp;river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This system of obtaining a moderate increase in depth during the low stage of a river, whilst leaving the river quite open for&nbsp;navigation, has been adopted with satisfactory results on several&nbsp;large rivers, of which the Rhone, the Rhine and the Mississippi furnish&nbsp;notable examples. Regulation works were preferred on the Rhone&nbsp;to canalization from Lyons nearly to its outlet, in spite of its large fall,&nbsp;which reaches in some places 1 in 250, on account of the considerable&nbsp;quantities of shingle and gravel carried down by the river; the&nbsp;comparative regularity of the discharge, owing to the flow being&nbsp;derived from tributaries having their floods at different times of&nbsp;the year, has aided the effects of the works, which have produced&nbsp;an increase of about 3I ft. in the available navigable depth below&nbsp;Lyons at the lowest water-level. Owdng, however, to the unfavourable natural condition of the river, the depth does, not exceed 5 ft.&nbsp;at this stage; and the rapid current forms a serious impediment&nbsp;to up-stream navigation. The Rhine is much better adapted for&nbsp;improvement by regulation works than the Rhone, for it has a&nbsp;basin more than double the area of the Rhone basin, and its fall&nbsp;does not exceed 3-1 ft. per mile up at Strassburg and 2-5 ft. per&nbsp;mile through the rocky defile from Bingen to Kaub, and is much&nbsp;less along most of the length below Strassburg. These works&nbsp;systematically carried out in wide shallow reaches between the&nbsp;Dutch frontier and Mainz, aided by dredging where necessary, have&nbsp;secured a navigable depth at the low stage of the river of 10 ft.&nbsp;from the frontier to Cologne, 8J ft. from Cologne to. Kaub, and&nbsp;61 ft. through the rocky defile up to Bingen, beyond which the same&nbsp;depth is maintained up to Philippsburg, 22J m. above Mannheim.&nbsp;Works, moreover, arc in progress by which it is anticipated that the&nbsp;minimum depth of 6J ft. will be extended up to Strassburg by 1916.&nbsp;The Mississippi also, with its extensive basin and its moderate fall&nbsp;in most parts, is w<sup>r</sup>ell suited for having its navigable depth increased</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
