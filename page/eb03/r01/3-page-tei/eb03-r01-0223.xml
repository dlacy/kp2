The <hi rend="italic">milliare,</hi>  or thou-ſand ffjf/rij, is ſubſtituted for the mile ; and the <hi rend="italic">are, </hi>■for the arpent in land-ineaſure. The latter two are -to each other as 49 to <hi rend="italic">25.</hi>  The aſtronomical circles •with which M. M. de Borda and Caffini made the obſer-"vations, are divided according to this plan. The qua-•drant contains 1O0 degrees, and each degree 100 mi-' nutes. Hence the minute of a great circle on our globe is equal to a <hi rend="italic">miUiare,</hi>  or new French mile. If, for the reduction of -this meafure, we eſtimate the Paris toiſe, according to the compariſon made with the ſtandard kept in the Royal Society of London, at 6.3925 Engliſh feet, the <hi rend="italic">milliare</hi>  or minute will be equal to 1093.f?33 y<hi rend="sup">ai</hi>^<hi rend="sup">s</hi>&gt; <hi rend="sup">an</hi>ſt the<hi rend="italic">metre</hi>  3.280899 feet.</p><p>. At the ſame period a new kalendar was formed.— By it the year is made to begin with the autumnal ‘equinox, and is divided into 12 months. Theſc are ‘called Vindemaire, Brumaire, Frimaire, Nivos, Ventos, •Pluvios, Germinal, Frorial, Praireal, Meffidor, Fervi-’dor, and Fructider. The months conſiſt of 30 days each, and are divided into three decades. The days of oach decade are known by the names of Primidi, Duo-"di, Tridi, &amp;c. to Decadi ; and the day of reſt is ap-"pointed for every tenth day, inſtead of the ſeventh. The day (which begins at midnight) is diſtributed into tell parts, and theſe are decimally divided and ſubdivided. Five ſupernumerary days are added every year after the 30th of Fructidor. To theſe is given the ab-ſurd appellation of <hi rend="italic">Sans Cullottides,</hi>  a word borrowed from a term of reproach <hi rend="italic">(fans cullotte),</hi>  which had often been beſtowed on the republican party from the jneannefs of their rank and fortune ; but which that party now attempted to render honourable and popular. The childiſh folly of this innovation has ſtruck every perſon with ſurprize, as it can ſerve no good purpoſe whatever. It is a wonderful inſtance of the way-wardneſs of the human mind, which can occupy itſelf one moment with deeds of ſavage barbarity, and the next with a matter ſo unimportant as the artificial diviſion of time.</p><p>The religion of France had been gradually Iofing its influence ; and on the 7th of November, Gobet biſhop of Paris, along with a great multitude of other eccle-ſiaſtics, came into the hall of the convention, and ſolemn-ly refigned their functions and renounced the Chriſtian religion. All the clergymen, whether Proteſtant or Catholic, that were members of the convention, followed this example, excepting only Gregoire, whom we formerly mentioned as having been one of the firſt prieſts that joined the <hi rend="italic">Tiers Fiat</hi>  after the meeting of the States General. He had the courage to profefs himſelf a Chriſtian, although he faid that the emoluments of his biſhoprſc were at the ſervice of the republic, with the acclamations of the convention, it was decreed that the only French deities hereafter ſhould be Liberty, Equality, Reaſon, &amp;c. and they would ſeem to have conſecrated theſe as a kind of new objects of worſhip.— what political purpofe the leaders in the convention intended to ſerve by this proceeding does pot clearly ap-pear ; unlefs, perhaps, their object was to render the French manners and modes of thinking ſo completely new', that it ſhould never be in their power to return to the ſtate from which they had juſt emerged, or to unite</p><lb/><p>in intercourſe with the other nations of Europe. The populace, however, could not at once relinquiſh en-tirely the religion of their fathers. The Commune oſ Paris ordered the churches to be ſhut up, but the Convention found it neceſſary to annul this order ; and Robefpierre gained no ſmali degree of popularity by ſupporting the liberty of religious worſhip on this occaſion. Hebert and Fabre d’Eglantine, who led the op-poſite party, haſtened their own fall by this ill-judged contempt of popular opinion.</p><p>For, now that the republic ſaw itſelf fuccefsful in all quarters, when the Mountain party and the Jacobins had no rival at home, and accounted themſelves in no immediate danger from abroad, they began to ſplit into factions, and the fierceſt jealouſies aroſe. The Jacobin Club was the uſual place in which their conteſts were carried 011 ; and at this time Robefpierre acted the part of a mediator between all parties. Fie attempted with great art to turn their attention from private animoſities to public affairs. He ſpread a report that an invaſion of Great Britain was fpeedily to take place. He therefore propoſed that the Jacobin Club ſhould ſet themſelves to work to diſeover the vulnerable parts of the Brſtiſh conſtitutſon and government. They did ſo : They made ſpeeches, and wrote eſſays without number. And in this way was the moſt fierce and turbulent band of men that ever perhaps exiſted in any country occupied and amuſed for a very conſiderable time, what is no leſs ſingular, a great number of Britiſh ſubjects favoured the plans of theſe reforming Atheiſts, and, under the fpecious appellation of the <hi rend="italic">Friends of the People, </hi>acted in concert with the French Jacobins.</p><p>The winter paſſed away in tolerable quſetneſs, and no military enterpriſe was undertaken either by the allies or by the French. On the iſt of February, Barrere aſſerted in the Convention that the confederate powers were willing <hi rend="italic">provifionally</hi>  to acknowledge the French republic, to conſent to a ceſſation oi hoſtilities for two years, at the end of which a laſting peace ſhould be ratified by the French people. But this propoſal the Convention declared itſelf determined to reject, as affording to the other nations of Europe the means of undermining their new government. In the mean time, the revolutionary government was gradually becoming ' more vigorous. Thirty committees of the Convention managed the whole buſineſs of the ſtate, without ſha-ring^much of the direct executive government, which reſted in the committee of public fafety. Theſe diffe-rent committees were engaged in the utmoſt variety of objects. The ruling party had no competitors for power, without confuſion or oppoſition, therefore, the moſt extenſive plans were rapidly carried into effect. The Convention was little more than a court in which</p><p>every project was ſolemnly regiſtered. In the ſame ſeſ-iion 30 decrees would ſometimes be paſſed upon objects the moſt widely different. The finances were under one committee, at the head of which was Cambon.— This committee found reſources for the moſt laviſh ex-penditure. The affignats were received as money throughout the ſtate ; and thus a paper mill was ſaid to have become more valuable than a mine of gold. Their credit was ſupported by an arbitrary law regulating the <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi>  or higheſt price of all proviſions, and by the immenſe maſs of wealth which had come into the hands of the Convention by ſeizing the church lands, and by confiſcating the property of royaliſts, emigrants, and</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
