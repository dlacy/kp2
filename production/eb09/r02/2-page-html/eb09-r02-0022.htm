<p><span class="font0">junction between the spinal nerves and the sympathetic cords there are ganglia, and from these sympathetic nerves proceed to the&nbsp;viscera, the heart, and the various blood-vessels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Ear.—</span><span class="font1">The auditory organ may consist of three parts—the external, median, and internal ear. The external ear, however, hardly exists in Reptiles, for there is&nbsp;no external fold of skin representing the external ear of&nbsp;Mammals in any save in the Crocodiles, and in them it is&nbsp;little more than a rudiment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The true internal ear always exists, and is composed of two parts—(1) a membranous labyrinth, containing fluid,&nbsp;enclosed in (2) a bony labyrinth, which has also fluid contents. The former consists of three membranous semicircular canals which open into a membranous sac, the&nbsp;vestibule, which is connected with a tubular structure,&nbsp;the membranous cochlea. It is to these parts that the&nbsp;ultimate fibres of the auditory nerve are distributed. The&nbsp;bony labyrinth is formed of the otic bones (prootic, epiotic,&nbsp;and opisthotic), which enclose it completely save at the&nbsp;points where openings are left called the fenestra ovalis&nbsp;and the fenestra rotunda. The latter is entirely surrounded by the opisthotic. The fenestra ovalis is partly&nbsp;enclosed by the prootic and partly by the opisthotic. The&nbsp;prootic specially protects and shelters the anterior vertical&nbsp;semicircular canal of the membranous labyrinth, and correspondingly constitutes that of the bony labyrinth. The&nbsp;posterior vertical semicircular canal is similarly related&nbsp;to the epiotic, and the external horizontal semicircular&nbsp;canal is sheltered by the prootic and opisthotic. The&nbsp;membranous cochlea helps to almost divide the bony&nbsp;chamber in which it lies into two parts called scalæ, which&nbsp;communicate at the apex of the cavity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such being the innermost ear of Reptiles and an outermost ear existing only in rudiment in Crocodiles, there is also a median ear which may or may not exist in this&nbsp;class of animals. This median ear is the tympanic cavity&nbsp;or chamber. It is into this cavity when present that the&nbsp;fenestra ovalis looks, while the fenestra rotunda looks into&nbsp;the cochlea. Both fenestræ are closed with membrane,&nbsp;so that the fluid in which the membranous labyrinth is&nbsp;suspended cannot escape through them. The fenestra&nbsp;ovalis has fitted to the outer side of its closing membrane&nbsp;a small ossicle of similar shape to itself, which generally&nbsp;has projecting from its outer side a more or less elongated&nbsp;and slender ossicle, the stapes or columella auris. This&nbsp;rod may be wanting, however, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops, Rhinophis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tortrix.</span><span class="font1"> When a middle or tympanic cavity exists,&nbsp;the stapes traverses it from the ossicle, closing the fenestra&nbsp;ovalis to become attached to a membrane, the tympanic&nbsp;membrane, which forms part of the external wall of the&nbsp;tympanum. Where there is no tympanic cavity, the stapes&nbsp;simply extends outwards amongst the muscles which lie&nbsp;external to the internal ear. In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidia</span><span class="font1"> and Amphis-bænians and some other Snake-like Lacertilians there is no&nbsp;tympanic cavity, and there is none in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria.</span><span class="font1"> Its presence is sometimes inconstant in those Lizards ; thus in&nbsp;the Slow Worm, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis fragilis,</span><span class="font1"> it may exist in some individuals and not in others. When it exists, it may not&nbsp;show any external indication of its presence as in the&nbsp;Chamæleons and some Chelonians, Generally, however,&nbsp;the tympanic membrane is covered by a scale of corresponding size, so that its presence is plainly marked externally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tympanic cavity communicates with the back of the mouth by a wide opening in Lacertilians ; but in&nbsp;Chelonians this communication is contracted into a&nbsp;narrow passage, the Eustachian tube, which opens (one&nbsp;from each tympanum) by a separate aperture on the roof&nbsp;of the mouth. In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font1"> these passages become&nbsp;further complicated and connected so that, in addition to&nbsp;the aperture on either side of the mouth, there is also a&nbsp;median aperture which is connected with both the Eustachian&nbsp;tubes, that of the right ear and that of the left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Eye.—</span><span class="font1">All Reptiles have eyes, although in some forms they are quite rudimentary and hidden beneath the&nbsp;skin, which is not at all or but very slightly modified in&nbsp;structure where it passes over them, as, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The eye consists of the same parts as in other Vertebrates, namely, of a nervous expansion at the back (the retina) derived from the optic nerve, a coloured lining&nbsp;(the choroid), a transparent medium (the vitreous humour)&nbsp;separated from one more anterior (the aqueous humour)&nbsp;by a sort of diaphragm (the iris), and a solid, transparent&nbsp;body (the crystalline lens), whilst the whole structure is&nbsp;enclosed by a fibrous membrane, the sclerotic, to form the&nbsp;“ ball of the eye,” a superficial part of the sclerotic being&nbsp;transparent and distinguished as the cornea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ball may have the skin which invests it externally separated in front of it into two folds, the eyelids. When&nbsp;the skin is not so separated, then a closed sac of delicate&nbsp;transparent membrane, the conjunctiva, lies over the&nbsp;cornea between it and the skin, and when the skin is&nbsp;divided into folds or eyelids then the conjunctiva is divided&nbsp;also, one layer lying as before next to the cornea, and the&nbsp;other layer being reflected from the outer margin of the&nbsp;cornea into the inside of the eyelids which it lines. There&nbsp;is often a third eyelid, which can be drawn obliquely over&nbsp;the eye, and is called the nictitating membrane. A&nbsp;glandular structure, the lacrymal gland, lies on the outer&nbsp;side of the front of the eyeball, its secretion passing into&nbsp;the mouth by the lacrymal canal ; another gland, the&nbsp;Harderian gland, may lie on the inner side of the eyeball.&nbsp;The sclerotic may be strengthened by bony plates being&nbsp;formed within it. A vascular coloured membrane, the&nbsp;pecten, may project into the vitreous humour from near the&nbsp;entrance of the optic nerve. The ball of the eye is moved&nbsp;by four straight and two oblique muscles, and may also&nbsp;be suspended by a funnel-shaped muscular sheath, the&nbsp;choanoid muscle. There are also special muscles of the&nbsp;eyelids.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Οphidia the eye is generally rather large, but very small in the Typhlopidæ and Uropeltidæ. In no Ophidians is the skin&nbsp;over the eyes divided into eyelids, so that the sac of the conjunctiva beneath it is never subdivided. In the Eurystomatous&nbsp;Ophidians, however, the skin, when it passes over the eyeball, is&nbsp;transparent. The outer (or epidermal) layer of the skin is cast&nbsp;with the rest of the skin of the body. The lacrymal canal is&nbsp;wide, but opens into the mouth by a narrow aperture on the inner&nbsp;side of the palatine bone. In some Trigonoeephali the lacrymal&nbsp;gland extends almost all round the eyeball. The sclerotic never&nbsp;develops bony plates in any Serpent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amongst the Lacertilia, many, such as the Amphisbænians, the Geckos, and many Skinks, have the eyelids undivided, as they are&nbsp;in Ophidians. Most Lizards, however, have an upper and an under&nbsp;eyelid, and also a nictitating membrane, and there may be a&nbsp;cartilaginous or bony disk in the lower eyelid. Many Skinks have&nbsp;the lower eyelid more or less transparent. The eye of the&nbsp;Cliamæleon is most peculiar. The larger eyelids have but a&nbsp;minute aperture, and the two eyeballs can be rotated independently,&nbsp;so that their axes may be differently directed simultaneously.&nbsp;There is a rudiment of a third eyelid, and there is a bony plate in&nbsp;the lower part of the large eyelid. The Harderian gland is large,&nbsp;but the lacrymal is small. The lacrymal canal opens below in&nbsp;the outer wall of the posterior nares. In most Lacertilians there&nbsp;are overlapping bony plates in the sclerotic, but these are wanting&nbsp;in Chamæleons and Geckos. There is mostly a pecten. In some&nbsp;species the lacrymal gland appears to be wanting. The nictitating or third eyelid is drawn over the eye by the simultaneous action&nbsp;of two curiously arranged structures. One of these is a muscle&nbsp;which takes origin from the postero-inner orbital wall and ends by&nbsp;forming a fibrous loop. The other is a tendon which passes&nbsp;through the loop to be attached at one end to the nictitating&nbsp;membrane, and at the other to the inner wall of the orbit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Hatteria there are eyelids—the lower with a cartilaginous disk—and a nictitating membrane. The sclerotic contains osseous&nbsp;lamellæ, and there is no pecten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Crocodilia have three eyelids, and no bony plate in any part</span></p>
