<p><span class="font1">mistake of fancying the three estates to be king, lords and commons. The ecclesiastical members of the House of Lords kept their seats&nbsp;there;, but the parliamentary representation of the clergy as an&nbsp;estate came to nothing. So far as the clergy kept any parliamentary&nbsp;powers, they exercised them in the two provincial convocations.&nbsp;These anomalous assemblies, fluctuating between the character of&nbsp;an ecclesiastical synod and of a parliamentary estate, kept, from&nbsp;Edward I. to Charles II., the parliamentary power of self-taxation.&nbsp;For a long time lords and commons taxed themselves separately.&nbsp;So did the clergy; so sometimes did other bodies. . . .</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">This summary shows clearly how the idea of “ representation ” as opposed to “ presence in person ” was applied to the English parliament, so as to give the commons a&nbsp;proper voice in it as well as the lords. It is unnecessary&nbsp;here to trace further the gradual increase in power of&nbsp;the House of Commons till it became the predominant&nbsp;partner in the English bicameral constitution (see Parliament).&nbsp;But from the point of view of historical theory it is important to&nbsp;note that its representative character does not essentially depend&nbsp;upon the particular method (election </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">by vote)</span><span class="font0"> by which its members&nbsp;have for so long been chosen. It is a common error to regard the&nbsp;House of Commons as having a national authority higher than&nbsp;that of the House of Lords merely on the ground that it is&nbsp;composed of elected members, and to stigmatize the House of&nbsp;Lords as “unrepresentative” because it is not elected. But in&nbsp;strictness the question of election, as such, has nothing to do&nbsp;with the matter.@@<sup>2</sup> The proper distinction (ignoring for the&nbsp;moment the later inclusion in the House of Lords of a certain&nbsp;representative element—strictly so regarded—in the Scotch and&nbsp;Irish peers) is that the House of Lords, as still constituted in&nbsp;1910, remained a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">presentative</span><span class="font0"> chamber, while the House of&nbsp;Commons was essentially a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">representative</span><span class="font0"> one; in the former&nbsp;the members, summoned personally as individuals, were entitled&nbsp;to speak in the great council of the nation, while in the latter&nbsp;the members were returned as the mouthpieces of whole </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">communi-iates,</span><span class="font0"> to whom, in the person of the sheriffs, thc summons had&nbsp;been directed to send persons to speak for them.@@<sup>3</sup> The preponderant authority of the House of Commons is due not to its&nbsp;members being elected—that is only one way of settling who the&nbsp;mouthpieces of the commons shall be—but to the progress of&nbsp;popular government. The two British houses have historically&nbsp;existed as assemblies of the separate estates of the realm—the&nbsp;House of Lords of the two estates of lords spiritual and temporal,&nbsp;and thc House of Commons of the commons. The third estate&nbsp;has so increased in power as to become predominant in the&nbsp;country; but the authority of its own assembly simply depends&nbsp;on the powers of those it represents. If the balance of political&nbsp;power had not been shifted in the country itself, the authority&nbsp;and competence of the peers, speaking for themselves in a&nbsp;primary assembly, would in theory actually appear higher, so&nbsp;far as their order is concerned, than that of members of the&nbsp;House of Commons, who can only “ represent ” the popular&nbsp;constituencies. Moreover, the fact that most members of the&nbsp;House of Commons are elected by a party vote is apt to make&nbsp;them very often even less authoritative spokesmen of their&nbsp;constituencies—the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Communitates—</span><span class="font0">than if they were selected&nbsp;by some method which would indicate that they had the full&nbsp;confidence of the whole body they “ represent.” It is notorious&nbsp;that many members of a modern House of Commons, or of any&nbsp;other “ representative ” assembly, have only been elected by&nbsp;the votes of a minority of their constituency, or (where there&nbsp;have been more than two candidates) a minority even of those&nbsp;who voted; and there always comes a time when it is certain&nbsp;that if a representative has to come again before the electorate&nbsp;for their votes he will be defeated; he, in fact, no longer reflects&nbsp;their views, while he still sits and legislates. The real desires&nbsp;of the commons in a certain British constituency may even be&nbsp;more faithfully, even if only accidentally, reflected by a local&nbsp;peer whose only right to speak in parliament is technically&nbsp;presentative. In his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication of the British Constitution&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1835), Disraeh*, writing of the Reform Bill of 1832, observed&nbsp;that “ in the effort to get rid of representation without election,&nbsp;it will be well if eventually we do not discover that we have only&nbsp;obtained election without representation.” A truer word was&nbsp;never spoken. A man may be representative, practically&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">consensu omnium,</span><span class="font0"> although no vote, resulting from a division of&nbsp;opinion, has been taken for thc purpose of selecting him. The&nbsp;vote is merely a method of selection when there is a definite&nbsp;division of opinion involving an uncertainty; and even in the&nbsp;modern House of Commons many members are returned “unopposed,” no actual voting taking place. A well-recognized&nbsp;representative character (as regards the functions involved)&nbsp;attaches, for instance, in British public life to other persons in&nbsp;whose selection the method of popular voting has had no&nbsp;place; such as the king himself, the Cabinet (in relation to thc&nbsp;political party in power), or the bishops (as regards the Church&nbsp;of England).</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Election ” in these early times has its simple meaning of&nbsp;“ choice.” “ We must guard ourselves from supposing that the&nbsp;citizens and burgesses, who were summoned to Parliament, were&nbsp;absolutely elected by the inhabitants of the towns as their representatives. Their presence in Parliament is another instance of&nbsp;representation without election. They were often nominated by the&nbsp;sheriff of the county, and even when that great officer, from negligence or favour, permitted the return to be made by those interested&nbsp;in the transaction, the nomination was confined to the small governing body, who returned two of their members, in general very unwilling missionaries, to the great council ” (Disraeli, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vindication of&nbsp;ike British Constitution,</span><span class="font1"> 1835).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In thc American federal system the bicameral legislature is&nbsp;divided into a “ House of Representatives,” composed of members&nbsp;elected by popular vote in each state, and a “Senate,” composed&nbsp;of members elected by the legislature in each state. In spite of the&nbsp;nomenclature, both houses are really composed of “ representatives.”&nbsp;But under a republican system there is no room for a purely presentative assembly, and the term “ representative ” comes to&nbsp;imply a more direct choice by the “ commons.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>3 </sup>There was at one time, it may be noted, a sort of “ representative ” element even in the case of the House of Lords, in so far as peers&nbsp;(including peeresses in their own right, abbesses, &amp;c.) could send&nbsp;deputies or proxies. But it must be remembered that the privilege&nbsp;flowed directly from the personal and presentative character of the&nbsp;summons to a peer, who as such coula name a deputy, lt is quite&nbsp;illegitimate to strain from it an analogy with the election of a representative by thc commons, who had no personal right to a summons.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">The question of remodelling the constitution of the British House of Lords was prominently before the country in 1910;&nbsp;and a large number even of those who were prepared to&nbsp;defend its actions in the past were ready to accept&nbsp;changes which would make it in form and composition a Second Chamber representative of the nation&nbsp;rather than presentative of its historic order. But&nbsp;it is important to remember, in connexion with the House of&nbsp;Lords question, that, in a country like England, where the constitution has provided for a Second Chamber which is composed&nbsp;of members of an estate or estates distinct in the nation from&nbsp;the estate of the commons, these persons may to a predominant&nbsp;degree nevertheless be really representative men by common&nbsp;consent; while their being so, though not theoretically the&nbsp;reason for their legislative power, is substantially the reason&nbsp;why it has so long persisted. In the absence of a written&nbsp;constitution, theoretical considerations have in England&nbsp;always been second to the force of circumstances. Most&nbsp;people regarded the House of Lords, as still unreformed&nbsp;in 1910, as purely a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hereditary</span><span class="font0"> body; its members had been&nbsp;summoned to parliament as peers (the important question of&nbsp;their right to a summons need not here bc discussed), and most&nbsp;peers enjoyed their titles by hereditary succession. But thc&nbsp;constant creation of peers by both political parties had in fact&nbsp;introduced even into the constitution of the House of Lords</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
