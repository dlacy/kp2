As the Latin nation was much ſuperior to them in ſtrength, they ſent deputies to ſolicit ſuc-cours from the ſeveral ſtates with which they were ſurrounded : but their negociations proved every where unſucceſsful; and, what was worſe than all, the republic had rebellious ſons in her own boſom, who refuſed to lend their aid in defence of their country. The poorer fort of people, and the debtors, refuſed to take the military oaths, or to ſerve ; alleging their poverty, and the fruitleſs hazards they ran in fighting for the defence of a city, where they were oppreſſed and enilaved by their creditors. This ſpirit of mutiny ſpread among the inferior claſſes, moſt of them refuſing to liſt themſelves, unleſs their debts were all remitted by a decree of the ſenate ; nay, they began to talk of leaving the city, and ſettling elſewhere.</p><p>The ſenate, apprehending a general inſurrection, aſſembled to deliberate on the means of quieting thoſe domeſtic troubles. Some were for a free remiſſion of all debts, as the ſafeſt expedient at that juncture; others urged the dangerous conſequences of ſuch a condeſcen-ſion, adviſing them to liſt ſuch only as were willing to ſerve, not doubting but thoſe who refuſed their aſſiſtance would offer it of their own accord when it was no longer deſired. Several other expedients were propoſed : but at length this prevailed ; to wit, that all actions for debts ſhould be ſuſpended till the conclulion of the war with the Latins. But this the indigent debtors thought only a ſuſpenſion of their miſery ; and therefore it had not the intended effect on the minds of the unruly multitude. The ſenate might indeed have proſecuted the ringleaders of the ſedition ; but the law of Poplicola, called the <hi rend="italic">Palerian law,</hi>  which allowed appeals to the aſſembly of the people, was a protection ſor the ſeditious, who were ſure of being acquitted by the accomplices of their rebellion. The ſenate, therefore, to elude the effect of a privilege that put ſuch a reſtraint upon their power, reſolved to create one ſupreme magiſtrate, who, with the title of <hi rend="italic">di8ator, </hi>ſhould have an abſolute power for a time : but as this could not be done without ſtriking at the law of Poplicola, and transferring the power of the people in criminal caſes to a magiſtrate ſuperior to all laws, it was, neceſſary to uſe artifice, in order to obtain the conſent of the curiæ. They therefore repreſented to them in a public aſſembly, that, in ſo difficult a conjuncture, when they had their domeſtic quarrels to decide, and at the ſame time a powerful enemy to repulſe, it would be expedient to put the commonwealth under a lingle governor, who, ſuperior to the conſuls themſelves, ſhould be the arbiter of the laws, and as it were the father of his country ; that his power ſhould have no limits : but, however, leſt he ſhould abuſe it, they ought not to truſt him with it above ſix months.</p><p>The people, not foreſeeing the conſequences of this change, agreed to it ; but the greateſt difficulty was to find a man duly qualified in all reſpects for ſo great a truſt. T. Lartius, one of the conſuls, ſeemed to be of all men the moſt unexceptionable ; but the ſenate, fearing to offend his colleague by an invidious preference, gave the conſuls the power of chooſing a dictator, and obliged them to name one of themſelves, not doubting but Clœlius would yield to the ſuperior talents of his colleague ; nor were they diſappointed in their expectations. But Lartius, with the ſame readi-neſs, named Cloelius ; and the only contcſt was, which of the two ſhould raiſe the other to the ſupreme authority. Each perſiſted obſtinately in remitting the dignity to his colleague, till Cloelius, ſtarting up on a hidden, abdicated the conſulſhip, and, after the manner of an interrex, proclaimed Titus Lartius dictator, who thereupon was obliged to take upon him the government of the republic.</p><p>Lartius indeed took as much ſtate upon him, after he had entered upon his office, as he had ſhown mo-deſty in refuſing it. He began by creating, without the participation either of the ſenate or people, a general of the Roman horſe ; an office which laſted only during the dictatorſhip, and which all ſubſequent dictators revived immediately after their election. Sp. Caſſius, formerly conſul, and honoured with a triumph, was the perſon he advanced to this ſecond ſtation in the republic. Lartius, having by this means ſecured the Roman knights, reſolved, in the next place, to make the people reſpect and fear him. With this view he never appeared in public, without being attended by 24 lictors, to whoſe faſees he again added the axes which Poplicola had cauſed to be taken from them. The novelty of this fight was alone ſufficient to awe the ſeditious, and, without executions, to ſpread con-ſternation throughout Rome. The murmurs of the inferior claſſes being by this means ſilenced, the dictator commanded a cenſus to be taken, according to the in-ſtitution of King Servius. Every one, without exception, brought in his name, age, the particulars of his eſtate, &amp;c. and there appeared to be in Rome x 50,700 men who were paſt the age of puberty. Out of theſe the dictator formed four armies : the firſt he commanded himſelf; the ſecond he gave to Clœlius his late colleague; the third to Sp. Caſſius his general of the horſe; and the fourth he left in Rome, under the command of his brother Sp. Lartius, who was to guard the city. The Latins not being ſo forward in their preparations as was expected, all their hoſtilities againſt Rome this campaign amounted to no more than the ſending a detachment into the Roman territory to lay it waſte. The dictator gained ſome advantage over that party ; and the great humanity with which he treated the priſoners and woμnded, diſpoſed the Latins to liſten the more readily to the overtures which he at the ſame time made them for a ſuſpenſion of hoſtilities. At length a truce was agreed on for a year ; and then Lartius, feeing the republic reſtored to its former tranquillity, reſigned the dictatorſhip, though the time appointed for its duration was not yet expired.</p><p>The following conſulſhip of Sempronius Atratinus and Mimιtius Angurinus, produced nothing memorable. But the next year the truce expired, when Aulus Poſthumius and T. Virginius took poſſeſſion of the conſulſhip. Both Romans and Latins were buſied in making the neceſſary preparations for war. The nobility of Latium, who were ſor the moſt part in the intereſt of the Tarquins, having found means to exclude the citizens from the Latin diets, carried all before them in thoſe aſſemblies : whereupon many of the citizens removed with their families to Rome, where they were well received.
