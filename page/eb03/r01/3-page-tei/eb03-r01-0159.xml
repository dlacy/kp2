Happening to peep into the region of me-t&lt;ιphyfics, he was ſomewhat ſurpriſed on obſerving the ideas which we derive from reflection and conſciouſneſs; and ſuppoſing that they could not have entered by the ſenſes, he naturally, though not very juſtly, concluded, that we muſt have received them in ſome ſtate of prior exiſtence.</p><p>As, according to him, the foul was eternal, as well as the matter which compoſed the body, and as thcir union was only temporary and accidental, he might have been ſatisfied that the death of the ſoul was not to be the conſequence of their ſeparation. But, ſome how or other, ſatisfied he was not. He had recourſe to a new argument. As the ſoul, he faid, was an active principle, and a ſelf-moving, it did not depend for its life on another ; and therefore would always continue to exiſt, though the body were reduced to the general mafs out of which it was formed. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics, </hi>Part III. chap. iv.</p><p>whether Plato had borrowed any of his doctrines from the eaſtern magi, we pretend not to fay. AVe on-ly obferve a ſtriking limilarity, in fome reſpects, between his and theirs. In Plato’s philoſophy, the ſun, moon, and ſtars, were animated beings, and a fort of divinities that originally had ſprung from the great fountain of Jιeat.and light, and our earthly bodies a fort of dungeons in which our miferable fouls are benighted and debafed by deſires, appetites, and paſſions. In the ma-.gian philoſophy, the Supreme Being was called <hi rend="italic">Oromaſ-■des ;</hi>  was the god of light, or was light itſelf, and re-preſented by Mithras, a ſubordinate divinity, and the ſame with the fun. Another deity of very great power was Arimanes, the god of darkneſs, who preſided over matter, and was the origin of all evil (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Polytheism).</hi></p><p>The ancient Gndſtics, who derived their tenets from this fource, believed, with Pythagoras and Plato, in a great number of ſubordinate genii ; and ſaid, that De-miurgus, the god of matter and the ſoul or ſpirit of this world, had contrived the bodies of men and brutes; and in the former particularly, as in fo many priſons, had confined a number of celeſtial ſpirits, that by expofing them to the low deſires of appetite and paſſion, he might feduce them from their allegiance to the God of light, and render them more fubmiſſive to himſelf. From theſe priſons the Supreme Being was continually making attempts to reſcue them; and in the mean time was frequently fending divine meffengers to en-lighten and inſtruct them, and to render them capable oſ returning to the regions of light and happineſs, to which they had belonged <hi rend="smallcaps">(e).</hi></p><p>'Γhe Stoics attempted to ſimplify this ſyſtem, which appears anciently to have pervaded Egypt and the eaſt, and which would ſecm to be no more than variouſly modified by orpheus, Pythagoras, Plato, and others of the more northerly and weſtern nations. None of them allowed a creation out of nothing; and the ſhapingand modelling of matter into forms was variouſiy explained, according as they happened to be moſt addicted to ſuperſtition, to morals, or to phyfics. Some afcribed theſe operations to ancient Time, Chaos, and Darkneſs, and explained the future changes in nature by the genealo-gies of theſe deities ; ſome obferving attraction and repulſion, or at leaſt a fort of agreement and diſcor-dance among bodies, were inclined to afcribe them to Friendſhip and Hatred, or Love and Antipathy ; ſome obſerving, that while one body roſe another defcended, made Levity and Gravity primary agents ; and ſome taking notice that living bodies ſprung from corruption, were diſpoſed to confer the ſame powers on Moiſture and Heat.</p><p>The phyfical hypotheſes were what had moſt charms for the Stoics. From their ſyſtem immaterial beings were openly excluded ; all things were regulated by phyfical laws or inexorable fate ; and all things origi-nated in the To 'Ey or the <hi rend="italic">Firβ One,</hi>  which was probably ſuggeſted by the of Pythagoras.
