<p><span class="font0">success was almost unprecedented, for it reached a fifth edition within the space of a year. “ The printer in Salis-bury-court,” says Mrs Barbauld, “ was to create a new species of writing ; his name was to be familiar in the mouths&nbsp;of the great, the witty, and the gay, and he was destined to&nbsp;give one motive more to the rest of Europe to learn the&nbsp;language of his country.” The moral tendency of this&nbsp;novel was considered as so excellent, that it was even recommended from the pulpit, particularly by Dr Slocock of&nbsp;Christ Church in Surrey. This estimate may now excite&nbsp;some degree of surprise ; and Dr Watts, to whom the author had sent his two volumes, wrote to him that he understood the ladies could not read them without blushing.&nbsp;Other inconsistencies in the work were powerfully ridiculed&nbsp;by Fielding in his History of Joseph Andrews, whom he&nbsp;introduces to his readers as the brother of Pamela. This&nbsp;was an injury which Richardson, though an amiable and&nbsp;benevolent man, found it very difficult, if not impossible to&nbsp;forgive. In his correspondence with his admiring friends,&nbsp;he predicted that Fielding would speedily sink into oblivion.&nbsp;But, in the present age, for every reader of Pamela and&nbsp;Clarissa there are at least five hundred of Joseph Andrews&nbsp;and Tom Jones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The brilliant success of this novel prompted some nameless individual to write and publish a continuation of the story, under the title of “ Pamela in high Life.” Richardson, who might very safely have disregarded such an attempt to invade his province, was thus induced to add a&nbsp;second part, which however made no addition to his reputation. “ These volumes,” says Mrs Barbauld, “ two in&nbsp;number, are, like most second parts, greatly inferior to the&nbsp;first. They are superfluous, for the plan was already completed ; and they are dull, for instead of incident and passion, they are filled with heavy sentiment, in diction far&nbsp;from elegant. A great part of it aims to palliate, by counter-criticism, the faults which had been found in the first&nbsp;parts. It is less a continuation, than the author’s defence&nbsp;of himself.” On the story of Pamela, the famous dramatist&nbsp;Goldoni has written two of his plays, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela Nubile</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela Maritata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"> In the year 1749, he published the first two volumes of “ The History of Clarissa Harlowe.” This work, which he&nbsp;extended to eight volumes, is the chief foundation of his&nbsp;celebrity as an original and inventive writer. Notwithstanding its inordinate length, the book long continued to&nbsp;enjoy an almost unrivalled share of public favour, and, whatever may be its defects or redundancies, this favour could&nbsp;only be secured by the author’s power over the imagination&nbsp;and moral feelings. The outline of the story is sufficiently&nbsp;simple, nor is the curiosity of the reader excited by intricate plots and marvellous adventures. It is a work, not of&nbsp;action and enterprise, but of character and sentiment. Clarissa was exhibited in a French dress by Prevost ; but he&nbsp;has given an abridgement rather than a translation ; and, as&nbsp;he has stated, the book required some softening to adapt it&nbsp;to the more delicate taste of his countrymen. A more faithful version was afterwards published by Le Tourneur. It&nbsp;was translated into Dutch by Stinstra, and into German&nbsp;under the auspices of the illustrious Haller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His next production was “ The History of Sir Charles Grandison,” published in 1753, in seven volumes. In his&nbsp;previous works he had given ample delineations of female&nbsp;character, and he now endeavoured to exhibit a pattern of&nbsp;a perfect man. Whatever is graceful and engaging in the&nbsp;man of spirit and the fine gentleman, it was his aim to&nbsp;unite with every moral virtue, and with the strict observance of Christian principles. This was certainly a difficult&nbsp;enterprise ; and the writer’s genius is more successfully displayed in delineating the character of Clementina, than in&nbsp;delineating that of his hero. Of all the representations&nbsp;of madness, says Dr Warton, that of Clementina “ is the&nbsp;most deeply interesting. I know not whether even the&nbsp;madness of Lear is wrought up, and expressed by so many&nbsp;little strokes of nature and passion. It is absolute pedantry&nbsp;to prefer the madness of Orestes in Euripides to that of&nbsp;Clementina.” But it is the great fault of Richardson, that&nbsp;he never knows when to withdraw his hand from the canvass ; and he has diminished the effect of this character by&nbsp;prolonging her appearances beyond the proper crisis for her&nbsp;retirement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The nervous system of Richardson was naturally weak ; and during his latter years his hand shook, and he was subject to frequent fits of giddiness. His disorders having at&nbsp;length terminated in apoplexy, he died on the 4th of July&nbsp;1761, at the age of seventy-two. He left behind him the&nbsp;character of a virtuous and benevolent man, highly respected in all the relations of private life. His chief weakness&nbsp;seems to have been vanity, which is sufficiently displayed&nbsp;in his private correspondence. His success in literature&nbsp;was so great and so unexpected, and he received so much&nbsp;flattery from his friends, especially from his female friends,&nbsp;that it would have required a very firm texture of mind to&nbsp;resist the access of that passion which so easily converts a&nbsp;wise man into a fool. </span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Richardson was twice married. His first wife was Martha the daughter of Allington Wilde, a printer of Clerken-well. She bore him five sons and a daughter, who all died young. His second wife, who survived him for many years,&nbsp;was Elizabeth the sister of Mr Leake, a bookseller of Bath.&nbsp;She became the mother of a son and five daughters. The&nbsp;son died at an early age, but four of the daughters survived him ; Mary, married in 1757 to Mr Ditcher, an eminent surgeon of Bath ; Martha, married in 1762 to Edward&nbsp;Bridgen, Esq.; Anne, who died unmarried in 1804; and&nbsp;Sarah, married to Mr Crowther, surgeon of Boswell-court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides his three novels in nineteen volumes, he published some other works. 1. The Negociations of Sir Thomas Roe, in his Embassy to the Ottoman Porte, from 1621 to 1628 inclusive. 1740, fol. 2. An edition of Æsop’s&nbsp;Fables, with Reflections. 3. Familiar Letters to and from&nbsp;several Persons upon business, and other subjects. He&nbsp;furnished some additions to tile sixth edition of De Foe’s&nbsp;Tour through Great Britain ; and some of his contributions&nbsp;are to be found in periodical works. Long after his death&nbsp;appeared “ The Correspondence of Samuel Richardson,&nbsp;author of Pamela, Clarissa, and Sir Charles Grandison ; selected from the original manuscripts bequeathed by him to&nbsp;his family. To which are prefixed a biographical account&nbsp;of that author, and observations on his writings, by Anna&nbsp;Lætitia Barbauld.” Lond. 1804, 6 vols. 12mo. This publication has no tendency to augment his reputation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The most eminent writers of our own, and even of foreign countries, have paid their tribute to the talents of Richardson, whose works have been published in almost&nbsp;every language and country of Europe. They have been&nbsp;greatly admired, notwithstanding every dissimilitude of manners, and every disadvantage of translation. Diderot, in RlS&nbsp;Essay on Dramatic Poetry, speaking of the means employed to move the passions, mentions Richardson as a&nbsp;perfect master of that art. “ How striking,” says he, “ how&nbsp;pathetic are his descriptions ! His personages, though silent,&nbsp;are alive before me ; and of those who speak, the actions are&nbsp;still more affecting than the words.” Rousseau, in his letter to M. d’Alembert, speaking of the novels of Richardson,&nbsp;asserts, “ that nothing was ever written equal to, or even&nbsp;approaching them, in any language.” Dr Johnson, in his&nbsp;introduction to the ninety-seventh number of the Rambler,&nbsp;which was written by Richardson, observes that the reader&nbsp;was indebted for that day’s entertainment to an author&nbsp;“ from whom the age has received greater favours, who&nbsp;has enlarged the knowledge of human nature, and taught&nbsp;the passions to move at the command of virtue.” In his</span></p>
