<p><label>RETAIL</label>
the sale of goods or commodities in small quantities to the immediate consumer, opposed to a sale wholesale or in gross. The O. Fr. <hi rend="italic">retaille,</hi> from which the word is taken, meant a piece cut off, from <hi rend="italic">tailler,</hi> to cut, Med. Lat. <hi rend="italic">taleare,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">talea,</hi> a rod, cutting for planting. The English meaning appears in Anglo-French and in the Italian <hi rend="italic">retaglio,</hi> selling by the piece. The other meaning of “ retail,” to repeat a story, is a transferred sense of an early meaning, “ to sell at second hand.” The Latin source is also seen in the related words “entail,” “tailor,” “detail” and “tally.”</p>
