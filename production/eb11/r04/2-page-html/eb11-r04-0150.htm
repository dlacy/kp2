<p><span class="font0">6th century, their power increased to such an extent that in the times of the Franks they already formed a species of papal&nbsp;cabinet with a share and sometimes a predominance&nbsp;in the affairs of the republic. There were seven principal&nbsp;administrators, but two of them held the chief power—&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">primicerius notariorum</span><span class="font0"> and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">secundicerius, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the first&nbsp;and under secretaries of state. When, on the constitution of&nbsp;the new empire, these ministers were declared to be palatine&nbsp;or imperial as well as papal officials, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">primicerius</span><span class="font0"> and the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">secundicerius</span><span class="font0"> were also in waiting on the emperor, who sat&nbsp;in council with them when in Rome. Next came the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">arcarius,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or treasurer ; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sacellarius,</span><span class="font0"> or cashier; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">protoscriniarius,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">who was at the head of the papal chancery; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">primus defensor,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">who was the advocate of the church and administered its&nbsp;possessions. Seventh and last came the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nomenclátor, or&nbsp;adminicutator,</span><span class="font0"> who pleaded the cause of widows, orphans and&nbsp;paupers. There were also some other officials, such as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vestiarius,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vicedominus</span><span class="font0"> or steward, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cubicularius</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;major-domo, hut these were of inferior importance. They were&nbsp;ecclesiastics, but not bound to be in priest’s orders. The first&nbsp;seven were those specially known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proceres clericorum</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;oftener still as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices de clero,</span><span class="font0"> since they speedily assumed&nbsp;judicial functions and ranked among the chief judges of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But as ecclesiastics they did not give decisions in criminal cases. Thus Rome had two tribunals, that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices de&nbsp;clero,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ordinarii,</span><span class="font0"> presided over by the pope, and that of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices de militia,</span><span class="font0"> leaders of the army, dukes and tribunes, also&nbsp;bearing the generic title of consuls. First appointed by the&nbsp;exarch and then frequently by the pope, these decided both civil&nbsp;and criminal cases. In the latter they were sole judges under the&nbsp;presidency of the prefect. .</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pope was thus at the head of a large administrative body with judicial and civil powers that were continually on&nbsp;the increase, and, in addition to his moral authority&nbsp;over Christendom, was possessed of enormous revenues.&nbsp;So in course of time he considered himself the real&nbsp;representative of the Roman Republic. Gregory II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(715-31) accepted in the name of the republic the submission of other cities, and protested against the conquest by the Lombards of those already belonging to Rome. He&nbsp;seemed indeed to regard the territory of the duchy as the patrimony of the church. The duke was always at the head of&nbsp;the army, and, officially, was always held to be an imperial&nbsp;magistrate. But the empire was now powerless in Italy.&nbsp;Meanwhile the advance of the Lombards was becoming more&nbsp;and more threatening; they seized Ravenna in 751, thus putting&nbsp;an end to the exarchate, and next marched towards Rome,&nbsp;which had only its own forces and the aid of neighbouring&nbsp;cities to rely upon. To avoid being crushed by the brute&nbsp;force of a foreign nation unfit to rule, and only capable of&nbsp;oppression and pillage, it was necessary to make an energetic&nbsp;stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Accordingly, the reigning pope, Stephen II. (752-57), appealed to Pippin, king of the Franks, and concluded with that monarch an alliance destined to inaugurate a new&nbsp;epoch of the world’s history. The pope consecrated&nbsp;Pippin king of the Franks, and named him </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patricius&nbsp;Romanorum.</span><span class="font0"> This title, as introduced by Constantine,&nbsp;had no longer the ancient meaning,but now became asign&nbsp;of lofty social rank. When, however, it was afterwards conferred&nbsp;on barbarian chieftains such as Odoacer and Theodoric, and then&nbsp;on the representative of the Byzantine empire in Italy, it acquired the meaning of a definite dignity or office. In fact, the&nbsp;title was now given to Pippin as defender of the church, for&nbsp;the pope styled him at the same time </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patricius Romanorum&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">defensor</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">protector eedesiae.</span><span class="font0"> And the king pledged&nbsp;himself not only to defend the church but also to wrest&nbsp;the exarchate and the Pentapolis from the Lombards and&nbsp;give them to Rome, or rather to the pope, which came to&nbsp;the same thing. This was considered as a restitution made&nbsp;to the head of the church, who was also the representative of&nbsp;the republic and the empire. And, to preserve the character&nbsp;of a restitution, the famous “ donation of Constantine was&nbsp;invented during this period (752-77). Pippin brought his&nbsp;army to the rescue (754-55) and fulfilled his promise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The pope accepted the donation in the name of St Peter, and as the visible head of the church. Thus&nbsp;in 755 central Italy broke its connexion with the empire and&nbsp;became independent; thus was inaugurated the temporal&nbsp;power of the papacy, the cause of so much subsequent warfare&nbsp;and revolution in Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Its first consequences were speedily seen. In 767 the death of Paul I. was followed by a fierce revolt of the nobles under&nbsp;Duke To to (Theodoro) of Nepi, who by violent means raised&nbsp;his brother Constantine to the chair of St Peter, although&nbsp;Constantine was a layman and had first to be ordained. For&nbsp;more than a year the new pontiff was a pliable tool in the hands&nbsp;of Toto and of the nobles. But the genuine papal faction,&nbsp;headed by a few </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices de clero,</span><span class="font0"> asked the aid of the Lombards&nbsp;and made a formidable resistance. Their adversaries were&nbsp;defeated, tortured and put to death. Toto was treacherously&nbsp;slain during a fight. The pope was blinded and left half dead&nbsp;on the highway. Fresh and no less violent riots ensued, owing&nbsp;to the public dread lest the new pope, Stephen III. (768-72),&nbsp;elected by favour of the Lombards, should give them the city&nbsp;in return. But Stephen went over to the Franks, whom he had&nbsp;previously deserted, and his successor, Adrian I. (772-95),&nbsp;likewise adhered to their cause, called the city to arms to resist&nbsp;King Desiderius and his Lombard hordes, and besought the&nbsp;assistance of Charlemagne. This monarch accordingly made a&nbsp;descent into Italy in 773, and not only gained an&nbsp;easy victory over Desiderius, but destroyed the&nbsp;Lombard kingdom and seized the iron crown. Entering&nbsp;Rome for the first time in 774, he confirmed and augmented&nbsp;the donation of Pippin by the addition of the dukedom of&nbsp;Spoleto. He returned several times to Italy and Rome, making&nbsp;new conquests and fresh concessions to Adrian I., until the&nbsp;death of the latter in 795.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The position of Rome and of the pope is now substantially changed. Duke, prefect, militia and the people exist as&nbsp;heretofore, but are all subordinate to the head of&nbsp;the church, who, by the donations of Pippin and&nbsp;Charlemagne, has been converted into a powerful&nbsp;temporal sovereign. Henceforth all connexion with&nbsp;Byzantium is broken off, but Rome is still the&nbsp;mainspring of the empire, the Roman duchy its sole surviving fragment in Italy, and the pope stands before the&nbsp;world as representative of both. And, although it is difficult&nbsp;to determine how this came about, the pope is now regarded&nbsp;and regards himself as master of Rome. In the year 772 he&nbsp;entrusts the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vestiarius</span><span class="font0"> with judicial powers over the laity,&nbsp;ecclesiastics, freemen and slaves </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nostrae Romanae reipublicae.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">He writes to Charlemagne that he has issued orders for the&nbsp;burning of the Greek ships employed in the slave trade,&nbsp;“ in our city of Civita Vecchia ” (Centumcellae), and he always&nbsp;speaks of Rome and the Romans as “ our city,” <sup>a</sup> our republic,”&nbsp;“ our people.” The donations of Pippin and Charlemagne are&nbsp;restitutions made to St Peter, the holy church and the republic at the same time. It is true that Charlemagne held&nbsp;the supreme power, had an immensely increased authority and&nbsp;actively fulfilled his duties as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patricius.</span><span class="font0"> But his powxr was&nbsp;only occasionally exercised in Rome; it was the result of services rendered to the church, and of the church’s continual&nbsp;need of his help; it was, as it were, the power of a mighty and&nbsp;indispensable ally. The pope, however, was most tenacious of&nbsp;his own authority in Rome, made vigorous protest whenever&nbsp;rebels fled to Charlemagne or appealed to that monarch’s&nbsp;arbitration, and contested the supremacy of the imperial&nbsp;officials in Rome. Yet the pope was no absolute sovereign,&nbsp;nor, in the modern sense of the term, did any then exist. He&nbsp;asserted supremacy over many lands which continually rebelled&nbsp;against him, and which, for want of an army of his own, he was&nbsp;unable to reduce to obedience without others’ help. Neither&nbsp;did the republic acknowledge him as its head. It profited by</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
