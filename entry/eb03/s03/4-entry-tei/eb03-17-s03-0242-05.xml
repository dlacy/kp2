or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sedre,</hi> the high-prieſt of the ſect of Ali among the Perſians. The ſedre is appointed by the emperor of Perſia, who uſually confers the dignity on his neareſt relation. The juriſdiction of the ſedre extends over all effects deſtined for pious purpoſes, over all moſques, hoſpitals, colleges, ſepulchres, and monaſteries. He diſpoſes of all eccleſiaſtical employments, and nominates all the ſuperiors of religious houſes. His deciſions in matters of religion are received as ſo many infallible oracles; he judges of all criminal matters in his own houſe without appeal. His authority is balanced by that of the mudſitehid, or firſt theologue of the empire.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
