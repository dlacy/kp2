<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and such cells are asexually produced spores. In the latter case the reproductive organs are such that they do&nbsp;not singly give rise to cells capable, each by itself, of&nbsp;developing into a new organism. These are sexual reproductive organs. In some instances the sexual organ does&nbsp;not give rise to reproductive cells at all until it has&nbsp;received into itself more or less of the protoplasmic&nbsp;contents of another different, at least physiologically,&nbsp;sexual organ; and the cells which it then produces are&nbsp;capable, each by itself, of developing into a new organism.&nbsp;In others the sexual organ produces reproductive cells&nbsp;without any such previous fusion of protoplasm, but the&nbsp;cells thus produced are incapable, each by itself, of&nbsp;developing into a new organism. Such cells are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sexual&nbsp;reproductive cells.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> It is only by the fusion of two such&nbsp;cells, physiologically different, that a reproductive cell is&nbsp;formed which is capable of developing into a new organism.&nbsp;The fusion either of the protoplasmic contents of two&nbsp;different sexual organs or of two different sexual cells&nbsp;constitutes the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sexual process.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> It may take place,&nbsp;according to circumstances, either within the organs or,&nbsp;in those cases in which sexual cells are produced and are&nbsp;set free, externally to them. The resulting cells are&nbsp;sexually produced spores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">In some exceptional cases the normal production, sexual or asexual, of spores does not take place, but the new organism is&nbsp;developed vegetatively from the parent. When the sexual&nbsp;y production of spores is suppressed, the case is one of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">apogamy</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">when the asexual production of spores is suppressed, the case is one </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">r.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">apospory.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> The following are instances of apogamy : in certain&nbsp;Ferns (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ptcris cretica, Aspidium falcatum)</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the prothallium produces&nbsp;no sexual organs, but the fern-plant rises vegetatively as a bud&nbsp;upon it. Apospory lias been observed to occur in Mosses and in&nbsp;some Ferns (</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Athyrium Filix-foemina, Polystichum angulare):</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> in&nbsp;Mosses a new plant may be developed vegetatively from the&nbsp;tissue of the sporogonium ; in Athyrium the sporangium, instead&nbsp;of producing spores, develops into a fern-prothallium. In the&nbsp;Characeae apospory appears to be the rule. Apogamy and apospory&nbsp;will be more fully discussed subsequently in connexion with the&nbsp;subject of alternation of generations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Asexual Reproduction.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—Reproduction by means of asexually produced spores is common to nearly all&nbsp;families of plants. It is wanting, among the Algae, in&nbsp;the Conjugatae, the Fucaceae, and the Characeae; among&nbsp;the Fungi, in a few Peronsporeae (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pythiurn vexans,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Arto-trogus), in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ancylistes Closterii,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aplanes Braunii,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> among&nbsp;the Saprolegnieae; and, among the Ascomycetes, in Ere-mascus, Sordaria (Hypocopra), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ascobolus furfuraceus,&nbsp;Pyronema</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peziza) conjluens,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Gynmoascus, the Collemaceae,&nbsp;and most other Lichen-Fungi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the simplest case the spore is developed from a single cell of the plant, which surrounds itself with the&nbsp;characteristic thick wall. This occurs only in plants of&nbsp;low organization; Nostoc and Bacillus are examples of it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In other cases the contents of the cell undergo division, each portion of the protoplasm constituting a spore.&nbsp;Examples of this are afforded, among unicellular plants,&nbsp;by Yeast and Protococcus, and in multicellular plants by&nbsp;the Confervaceae, the Ulvaceae, and some Florideae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In this case each cell, the protoplasm of which divides to form spores, may be regarded as a rudimentary&nbsp;reproductive organ of the nature of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sporangium.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> In&nbsp;more highly organized plants special organs are differentiated for the production of spores. In the majority of&nbsp;cases the special organ is a sporangium, that is, a hollow&nbsp;capsule iu the interior of which the spores are developed.&nbsp;In the Thallophytes the sporangium is a single cell. In&nbsp;the Muscineai it is a multicellular capsule; in Riccia, in&nbsp;which the structure of the capsule is simple, the whole of&nbsp;the internal cells give rise by division to spores; in other&nbsp;Liverworts, and in the Mosses, in which the structure of&nbsp;the capsule becomes progressively more and more complex,&nbsp;a portion only of the internal cells give rise to spores. In</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the Ferns, Equisetacem, and Lycopodiacese the sporangium is multicellular, but simple in structure. This is true also&nbsp;in the llhizocarpaj and in the Ligulatee (Selaginella,&nbsp;Isoetes), but in these plants there is this peculiarity that&nbsp;there are sporangia of two kinds,—some, namely, which&nbsp;produce one, or a few, large spores, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">macrospores,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and are&nbsp;hence termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">macrosporangia,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and others which give rise to&nbsp;a large number of small spores, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">microspores,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and are hence&nbsp;termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">microsporangia.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The Phanerogams also bear two&nbsp;kinds of sporangia, which have received special names :—&nbsp;the macrosporangium, which produces only one mature&nbsp;spore, is termed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ovule</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">; the microsporangium, which&nbsp;produces a large number of microspores, is termed the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pollen-sac.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> In some cases among the Fungi the spores are :&nbsp;not produced in the interior of a sporangium, but are<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>formed by abstraction. This occurs in some Mucorini, <sup>1&nbsp;</sup>such as Chaetocladium, in the Ustilagineae, the Entomoph-'&nbsp;thorem, the Peronosporem, the Ascomycetes, the Rusts&nbsp;(Uredine&lt;e), and the Basidiomycetes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">These asexually produced reproductive cells are com monly spoken of simply as spores, but in many cases some&nbsp;addition has been made to the word, or an altogether&nbsp;different name is applied to them, in order to mark some&nbsp;peculiarity in their mode of origin, to indicate their order&nbsp;of development, or to assign them without periphrasis to&nbsp;a particular group of plants. Thus, as has been mentioned,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">zoospores</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> are motile spores unprovided, for a time at least,&nbsp;with a cell-wall; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stylospores</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> are spores which are developed,&nbsp;not in sporangia, but by abstriction as mentioned above;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tetraspores</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> is the name given to the spores of the Floride®&nbsp;to denote the fact that four spores are produced by the&nbsp;division of the mother-cell. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uredospores</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the&nbsp;Uredinese are those which are produced during the&nbsp;summer, whereas the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">teleutospores</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of these plants are those&nbsp;which are formed in the autumn, at the end of the period&nbsp;of growth. It was the custom, at one time, to speak of&nbsp;the spores of Fungi as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">conidia;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and at the present time the&nbsp;macrospores and the microspores of Phanerogams are better&nbsp;known as embryo-sacs and pollen-grains l’espectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The organs which give rise to the asexually produced spores are usually not confined to a particular part of the&nbsp;plant in the Thallophytes. Instances of this do, however,&nbsp;occur among the Ascomycetous Fungi—namely, in the&nbsp;Pyrenomycetes. Here the production of the stylospores&nbsp;takes place in definite receptacles known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pycnidia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the vascular plants (Pteridophyta, Phanerogams), the&nbsp;development of sporangia, speaking generally, is confined&nbsp;to the leaves. In many of the Pteridophyta the sporan-giferous leaves do not differ in appearance from the&nbsp;foliage-leaves; but in other cases they undergo considerable modification, as in the Equisetacem, Marsiliacese, some&nbsp;species of Lycopodium and Selaginella, and notably in the&nbsp;Phanerogams. In the Phanerogams the modification is so&nbsp;great that the sporangiferous leaves have received special&nbsp;names; those which bear the microsporangia (pollen-sacs)&nbsp;are termed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stamens,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and those which bear the macrosporangia (ovules) are termed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">carpels.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> When the&nbsp;sporangiferous leaves are thus modified they are usually&nbsp;aggregated together, and such an aggregate of sporangiferous leaves constitutes a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">flower.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sexual Reproduction.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—In nearly all classes of plants above the Protophyta spores are formed by a sexual&nbsp;process; and in those in which no such process can be&nbsp;detected its absence is due, not, as in the Protophyta, to&nbsp;the fact that sexuality has not yet been developed, but to&nbsp;its gradual disappearance. The phenomena of sexual&nbsp;reproduction will be most intelligibly stated by tracing&nbsp;them in the different main divisions of the Vegetable&nbsp;Kingdom—the Algae, the Fungi, the Arcliegoniata, and the&nbsp;Phanerogams.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
