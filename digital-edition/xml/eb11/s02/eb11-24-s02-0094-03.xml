In 302 B.c. a temple was dedicated to Salus on the Quirinal (Livy x. 1); and in later times public prayers were offered to her on behalf of the emperor and the Roman people at the beginning of the year, in time of sickness, and on the emperorâ€™s birthday. In 180 B.c., on the occasion of a plague, vows were made to Apollo, Aesculapius and Salus (Livy xl. 37). Here the special attribute of the goddess appears to be health ; and in later times she was identified with the Greek goddess of health, Hygieia.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
