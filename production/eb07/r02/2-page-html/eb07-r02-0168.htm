<p><span class="font0">of preventing them from being taught, that they might sink into insignificance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His attempt to rebuild the temple of Jerusalem was one of the most remarkable ofhis systematic endeavours to overthrow Christianity. He was sufficiently acquainted with the&nbsp;scriptures to know, that the final desolation of Jerusalem and&nbsp;dispersion of the Jews had been predicted, and was a standing miracle testifying to the truth of Christianity. This he&nbsp;endeavoured to refute, and turn against the cause, by rebuilding the temple in more than its original splendour, and&nbsp;restoring the Jews to their long-lost capital. But in this&nbsp;daring attempt he was signally defeated. If we may credit tlle testimony of contemporaneous historians, the workmen were driven from the attempt by thunders, whirlwinds,&nbsp;and flames bursting from the foundations which they were&nbsp;vainly endeavouring to lay, till terrified by these supernatural events, they were compelled to abandon the enter-prize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From these fruitless endeavours for the subversion of Christianity, Julian was called to take the field against the&nbsp;Persians, who had renewed their aggressions. Though peculiarly desirous of literary and philosophic fame, Julian was&nbsp;by no means destitute of military ambition. He returned&nbsp;a very haughty answer to the Persian ambassadors who had&nbsp;come to treat with him ; and set out at the head of a powerful army of skilful veterans, determined to humble the pride&nbsp;and the power of the Persian monarch. For some time his&nbsp;expedition was one continued series of brilliant achievements, till bearing down all opposition, he reached the walls&nbsp;of Ctesiphon. But there he found himself too far from his&nbsp;resources to be able to continue his operations in the siege&nbsp;of a place which promised no speedy conquest. To advance&nbsp;was impossible, to retreat highly dangerous, to remain destruction. Reluctantly he commenced a disastrous retreat,&nbsp;through sandy deserts, oppressed with intolerable heat, deficient in provisions for his troops, and surrounded by clouds&nbsp;of swift Arabian cavalry. Several sharp encounters took&nbsp;place, in which the Roman forces gained the advantage&nbsp;whenever the enemy came to close combat, but suffered&nbsp;dreadfully from the light skirmishing warfare which they&nbsp;generally waged. At length a Persian arrow pierced the&nbsp;unguarded breast of Julian, inflicting a wound of which he&nbsp;died in a few hours, after an active reign of about twenty&nbsp;months.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The distressed army could not be without a leader ; and after a short consultation Jovian, thc </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">first of the domestics,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a title which conferred senatorial dignity, and a rank equal&nbsp;to that of the military </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">duces,</span><span class="font0"> was proclaimed emperor ; and&nbsp;after some severe conflicts with the Persians, was obliged&nbsp;to conclude a treaty neither advantageous nor honourable&nbsp;to the empire, except that it was necessary for the preservation of the wreck of the army. Returning to his own dominions, he immediately revoked all the decrees issued by&nbsp;Julian against Christianity, and in favour of paganism, thus&nbsp;restoring the former to the supremacy which it had enjoyed&nbsp;since the time of Constantine. Before he reached Constantinople, to which he was directing his course, Jovian was&nbsp;found dead in his bed, having been suffocated, as was supposed, by charcoal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After a period of ten days spent in consultation and debate, Valentinian was chosen by the imperial ministers and generals, and the army cordially ratified the choice. Soon&nbsp;after his elevation, Valentinian raised his brother Valens&nbsp;to the dignity of Augustus, and divided with him the empire, giving to Valens the eastern territories, and retaining&nbsp;to himself Illyricum, Italy, Gaul, Spain, Britain, and Africa.&nbsp;Thus were the Roman dominions once more divided into&nbsp;tlle eastern and western empires ; and from the time of Valentinian, they were never again thoroughly united. Valentinian established his court, not at Rome, but at Milan, being&nbsp;nearer the centre of his dominions ; and he was almost im</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">mediately engaged in hostilities with the restless and warlike tribes of the Germanic race. He made the most energetic&nbsp;efforts to drive back these invaders, and to maintain the&nbsp;extent of the empire undiminished ; a task every year more&nbsp;and more difficult, from the increasing torrent of invaders,&nbsp;and the sinking strength of the exhausted empire. Not&nbsp;only were the German tribes in motion, pressing into&nbsp;Gaul, but the tribes bordering on the Baltic were beginning those piratical depredations which made them so long&nbsp;the terror of the adjacent maritime countries. In Britain&nbsp;the Scots and Picts were overpowering the Roman province, so tllat in every quarter of the western empire,&nbsp;nothing was to be seen but the march and countermarch of&nbsp;contending armies. Theodosius, the Roman general in&nbsp;Britain, succeeded in defending that province from its assailants, and thus gained the friendship of the emperor.&nbsp;To give the appearance of greater stability to his throne,&nbsp;Valentinian raised his son Gratian to the rank of Cæsar,&nbsp;and caused him to be received by the army as his successor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time a dangerous war arose in Africa, where the avarice and cruelty of Count Romanus, the military&nbsp;governor, had excited general dissatisfaction. The complaints of the injured Africans having been guilefully misrepresented to Valentinian, he punished the complainers.&nbsp;Despairing of redress, the people revolted, and chose Firmus,&nbsp;the son of a man of great wealth and influence in the country, for their leader. Romanus was quite unable to suppress this rebellion ; but Valentinian despatched the warlike Theodosius with a strong force, to reduce them to subjection. Immediately on his arrival, the aspect of affairs&nbsp;was changed. Firmus was defeated with great loss, and&nbsp;fled to a friendly tribe in the interior ; but fearing to be&nbsp;betrayed, he committed suicide, to avoid falling into the&nbsp;hands of the conqueror. Valentinian himself had in the&nbsp;mean time been engaged in conducting an expedition&nbsp;against the Quadi, and other nations on the Danube, in.&nbsp;which he was successful ; but died suddenly of apoplexy,&nbsp;near the modern city of Guntz in Hungary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gratian, the eldest son of Valentinian, succeeded his<sup>, </sup>father in the western empire, and immediately associated&nbsp;with himself his brother Valentinian II., at that time only&nbsp;a youth of five years old, assigning to him Italy and Illyricum. Among the first and the worst acts of his reign, was&nbsp;the sanctioning the execution of Theodosius, whose brave&nbsp;and skilful conduct had preserved Britain, and recovered&nbsp;Africa. To this he was instigated by the calumnious insinuations of envious courtiers, who both hated and feared&nbsp;the rising merit of that gallant warrior. The reign of Valentinian, though filled with wars, had been so prosperous&nbsp;that it had secured for his sons a period of comparative&nbsp;tranquillity, more suited to their youth and inexperience.&nbsp;But the eastern empire had neither enjoyed equal prosperity, nor was enjoying the prospect of equal tranquillity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Almost at the very commencement of his reign, Valens, the eastern emperor, was compelled to make preparations&nbsp;for a new Persian war ; and, in the midst of these preparations, was alarmed by a dangerous rebellion. This was&nbsp;raised by Procopius, a distant relation of Julian, whose&nbsp;pretensions to the throne were founded partly on his consanguinity to the former emperor, and partly on a rumour&nbsp;that Julian had himself secretly invested him with the purple. Procopius was at first successful ; but his haughty&nbsp;and cruel temper disgusting his own supporters, he was deserted by them, taken by the emperor, and put to de3th.&nbsp;The Persian war proceeded favourably, Sapor receiving a&nbsp;severe defeat, which was soon followed by a peace. But a&nbsp;more important event occurred, formidable not only to Valens, but also to the whole of tlle western world. This was&nbsp;the appearance of a new moving nation of barbarians, called&nbsp;Huns. Respecting tlle origin of this people, there are va-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
