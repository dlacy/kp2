. emperor of the Turks, ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Magnificent,</hi> was the only ſon of Selim I. whom he ſucceeded in 1520. He was educated in a manner very different from the Ottoman princes in general; for he was inſtructed in the maxims of politics and the ſecrets of government. He began his reign by reſtoring thoſe persons their poſſeſſions whom his father had unjuſtly plundered. He re-eſtabliſhed the authority of the tribunals, which was almoſt annihilated, and beſtowed the government of provinces upon none but perſons of wealth and probity : “ I would have my viceroys (he uſed to ſay) reſemble thoſe rivers that fertilize the fields through which they paſs, not thoſe torrents which ſweep every thing before them.”</p><p>After concluding a truce with Iſmael Sophy of Perſia, and subduing Gozeli Bey, who had raiſed a rebellion in Syria, he turned his arms againſt Europe. Belgrade was taken in 1521, and Rhodes fell into his hands the year following, after an obſtinate and enthuſiaſtic defence. In 1526 he defeated and flew the king of Hungary in the famous battle of Mohatz. Three years after he conquered Buda, and immediately laid siege to Vienna itſelf. But after continuing 20 days before that city, and aſſaulting it 20 times, he was obliged to retreat with the loss of 80,000 men. Some time after he was defeated by the Perſians, and diſappointed in his hopes of taking Malta. He ſucceeded, however, in diſpoſſeſſing the Genoeſe of Chio, an iſland which had belonged to that republic for more than 200 years.</p><p>He died at the age of 76, while he was beſieging Sigeth, a town in Hungary, on the 30th Auguſt 1566.</p><p>He was a prince of the ſtricteſt probity, a lover of justice, and vigorous in the execution of it ; but he tarniſhed all his glory by the cruelty of his diſpoſition. After the battle of Mohatz he ordered 1500 priſoners, moſt of them gentlemen, to be ranged in a circle, and beheaded in preſence of his whole army.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0608.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0602"/>
Soliman thought nothing impossible which he commanded : A general having received orders to throw a bridge over the Drave, wrote him, that it was impoſſible. The ſultan ſent him a long band of linen with theſe words written on it : “ The emperor Soliman, thy maſter, orders thee to build a bridge over the Drave in ſpite of the difficulties thou mayeſt meet with. He informs thee at the ſame time, that if the bridge be not finiſhed upon his arrival, he will hang thee with the very linen which informs thee of his will.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
