<p><span class="font0">which prohibited foreigners from holding lands. The bill was carried by the government in April 1895, as well as another&nbsp;important measure favouring the construction of local railways by private contractors. The Liberal opposition protested, retired from the chamber, and took no further part in&nbsp;legislative proceedings. The Liberal party had been • out of&nbsp;office for eight years, the Conservative-Junimist coalition&nbsp;had practically carried out its complete programme, and legislation was at a deadlock owing to the abstention of the Liberal&nbsp;opposition. As the electorate showed itself in favour of a&nbsp;change of ministry, Catargiu resigned, and a new Liberal&nbsp;government was formed by D. Sturdza.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The advent to power of a statesman who had recently been making such violent attacks on the Hungarian government&nbsp;caused some anxiety in Austria-Hungary. When&nbsp;once office was obtained, it was to the interest of the&nbsp;new government that the agitation should subside.&nbsp;The official opening by the emperor of Austria of the&nbsp;new channel through the Iron Gates of the Danube,&nbsp;on the 27th of September T896, was the means of bringing&nbsp;about a great improvement in the relations between the two&nbsp;countries. It led to an exchange of visits between the emperor&nbsp;and King Charles, who also visited the tsar Nicholas II. in August&nbsp;1898. The visit was the symbol of a reconciliation between&nbsp;the Rumanians and the Russians, the relations between whom&nbsp;had been the reverse of cordial since 1878. As regards home&nbsp;politics, the overwhelming majority of the Liberal party at&nbsp;the elections of 1895, instead of being a source of strength,&nbsp;proved the very reverse. It caused the party to split up into&nbsp;factions—Sturdzists, Aurelianists and Flevists, so called after&nbsp;the names of their respective chiefs. Sturdza himself soon&nbsp;had to retire. The head of the Orthodox Church, the metropolitan Gennadius, had for some years past, as head of the&nbsp;philanthropic establishments founded by the princess Branco van, desired to obtain the entire management of these wealthy&nbsp;foundations, and had made violent attacks on the two administrators, Prince George Bibescu and Prince Stirbei, both&nbsp;members of the Brancovan family. In the quarrel that ensued&nbsp;the prelate was openly accused of simony, of heresy, and other&nbsp;matters more suitable for a criminal court. After a public&nbsp;trial before the Holy Synod, he was found guilty of certain&nbsp;canonical offences, and sentenced to be deposed. The same&nbsp;night, he was seized by the police, and removed by force to a'&nbsp;neighbouring monastery. This harsh treatment of the head&nbsp;of the Church led to an attack on Sturdza. On the 3rd of&nbsp;December 1896, the president of the council, M. Aurelian,&nbsp;was called on to reconstitute a Liberal cabinet, with the principal&nbsp;object of calming public opinion by the settlement of this&nbsp;question. Aurelian then appealed to the patriotic sentiments&nbsp;of the Conservative party to help to solve the difficulty, and&nbsp;with the aid of Lascar Catargiu and Tache Ionescu the following decision was reached: the Holy Synod was to reverse&nbsp;its judgment, and the metropolitan was to be restored to his&nbsp;ecclesiastical rank; but, after holding it for a few days, he was&nbsp;voluntarily to resign and to receive as compensation a handsome&nbsp;pension. Calm was thus restored, but Aurelian and his colleagues were not inclined to hand over their portfolios to Sturdza&nbsp;and his partisans. The struggle terminated in the success of&nbsp;Sturdza, who in April 1897 returned to power and remained&nbsp;president of the council until 1899. Few of the important&nbsp;measures promised in the Liberal programme were passed, one&nbsp;for the reform of public instruction being the most noteworthy.&nbsp;Sturdza’s government, which had risen to power mainly on&nbsp;the national question, was also destined to fall on it. A popular&nbsp;agitation was raised on the subject of certain subsidies made by&nbsp;the Rumanians for the support of the Rumanian schools at Kronstadt in Transylvania, and Sturdza was accused of too great&nbsp;subserviency to the Hungarian government. The agitation culminated in street riots at Bucharest. On the same evening that&nbsp;Sturdza tendered his resignation to the king (April 1899) the&nbsp;veteran Conservative statesman Lascar Catargiu suddenly died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Conservatives, led by G. G. Cantacuzene, returned to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">office with an overwhelming majority. They were immediately confronted by an acute economic crisis. The financial&nbsp;position of the country had hitherto on the surface&nbsp;been very satisfactory. The public debt, mostly&nbsp;placed in Germany, amounted to about £5t,ooo,ooo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The interest had been regularly paid. But the facility with which money had always been borrowed gave rise to great&nbsp;extravagance. Expenses which ought to have been defrayed&nbsp;out of the ordinary budget, such as the erection of magnificent&nbsp;public offices at Bucharest, were frequently defrayed out of the&nbsp;loans; and the custom had arisen when money was scarce of&nbsp;issuing treasury bonds. When the Conservatives came into&nbsp;office they found that the payment of 2 J millions of these&nbsp;bonds would shortly become due, and there were no resources&nbsp;in the treasury to meet them. Owing to the Transvaal War&nbsp;and other causes, the money market was most unfavourable,&nbsp;especially in Germany; and there was an almost entire failure&nbsp;of the harvest. The value of cereals exported in 1898 was about&nbsp;9 millions sterling, in 1899 only 3 J millions. The government&nbsp;managed to extricate itself from its immediate difficulties in&nbsp;the autumn of 1899, by raising a loan of £7,000,000 in Berlin,&nbsp;but on very stringent terms. Besides paying a much higher&nbsp;rate of interest than heretofore, it bound itself not to contract&nbsp;any further loans until this one was paid. The Conservatives&nbsp;were united in wishing to meet the financial crisis by a moderate&nbsp;reduction'of expenditure and a large increase of taxation,&nbsp;while the Liberal opposition advocated the permanent reduction&nbsp;of the annual expenditure of £800,000, which woul$ necessitate&nbsp;the raising of £200,000 only by fresh taxation. The Conservative programme was naturally impopular; Carp and the&nbsp;Junimists were unwilling to co-operate with the government, and,&nbsp;on the 26th of February 1901, D. Sturdza again became premier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His administration lasted until the 31st of December 1904, and averted the impending bankruptcy of Rumania by a policy&nbsp;of strict retrenchment. In 1904 Sturdza was able to&nbsp;exceed the proposed limit of annual expenditure,&nbsp;£8,740,000, owing to a great increase in the value&nbsp;of the tobacco monopoly. Even a recurrence of agricultural&nbsp;depression during the same year left the national credit intact.&nbsp;Another financial reform was undertaken by the Conservatives, who returned to power on the 4th of January 1905,&nbsp;with G. G. Cantacuzene as prime minister, and in May floated&nbsp;the conversion loan, already described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief causes of the agrarian insurrection in March 1907 have been outlined above (under </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Land Tenure},</span><span class="font0"> But&nbsp;an additional cause was the harsh treatment of the&nbsp;peasants on the state and communal lands leased to&nbsp;Jewish middlemen. At first an attack on the Jews&nbsp;alone, the rising soon became a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jacquerie</span><span class="font0"> directed against all&nbsp;the large landowners. Numerous towns and villages were&nbsp;sacked and partly burned, and 140,000 soldiers were employed&nbsp;to suppress the revolt. On the 24th of March the Cantacuzene&nbsp;ministry resigned and was succeeded by a Liberal government&nbsp;under the leadership of D. Sturdza, who completed the restoration of order by strong military measures and afterwards initiated remedial legislation. He abolished the system by which&nbsp;public lands were leased to middlemen, reduced the land tax&nbsp;on small holdings, and granted new facilities for obtaining credit&nbsp;to the peasants. After a general election in June 1907, Sturdza&nbsp;remained in office with an overwhelming majority. To meet&nbsp;the cost of agrarian reform, and of the reorganization of the&nbsp;army (1908), he introduced various fiscal changes, notably an&nbsp;alteration in the budget system, by which the total revenue and&nbsp;expenditure were shown for the first time (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Finance,</span><span class="font0"> above).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rumania was little affected by the political changes in the Balkan Peninsula (1908-10) coincident with the Turkish&nbsp;revolution, the annexation of Bosnia and Herzegovina&nbsp;by the Dual Monarchy, the proclamation of Bulgarian&nbsp;independence and the erection of Montenegro&nbsp;into a kingdom. South of the Danube its chief&nbsp;political interest centred in the Kutzo-Vlach communities in Macedonia, which were the object of a Panhellenic</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
