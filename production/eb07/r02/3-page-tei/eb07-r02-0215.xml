Woolders are stout pins</p><p>with a rope fastened to one end,</p><p>and are used to assist the action of</p><p>the machine in twisting the rope.</p><p>In addition to the above, there is</p><p>used in making white ropes a rub</p><p>ber, formed of steel rings inter</p><p>woven like linked mail ; and it is</p><p>probably from the resemblance that it is termed a mail.</p><p>In the operation of laying, the yarn is first warped for the strands. The haul is run out along the bearers of the laying walk, and the number of yams for the size of rope about to be made is separated from it by means of the nettling. The separated yams are then divided into three equal portions. Each portion is laid in a separate division of the bearers, and hung upon its hooks at the tackle-board and sledge. The sledge is then pulled backwards by the tackle-purchase before described, until the yarns are all stretched tight, and press-barrels are now laid on. When things are in this position the threads are examined, and if any be longer than the others, they are drawn up until every yam is equally tight. The hooks at each end are now heaved round <hi rend="italic">in time,</hi>  and in a direction contrary to the spinning twist ; and each collection of yarns is twisted round its axis, and becomes a strand. The twisting of the strands shortens them, and draws the sledge up the walk.</p><p>When the torsion in all the strands is sufficient, or when, in technical language, the strands are full hard, the twisting is stopped. The sledge is then drawn up the walk a small piece to slacken the strands and allow the outer ones to be taken off their hooks and hung on the middle hook. It is again drawn back by the purchase, and the top (fig. 12) is inserted among the strands which will occupy its grooves.</p><p>The top is now forced back as near the hook of the sledge as possible, and the workmen at the head again turn their hooks in the same direction as before. As soon as the workmen at the sledge perceive it moving forward, they remove some of the pressure, and begin to turn their hook in a direction contrary to its former motion. The top is by this forced forward, and the three strands closing behind it form the rope. When the top gets far enough from the sledge to admit of their application, the tails are wrapped round the rope, and by their friction they enable the workmen to keep the top from moving forward by jerks, and they also make the rope close better. The care of the topman is to regulate the speed of his top in relation to the twist at both ends, the mean of doing which is simple. He makes a mark across the strands at every bearer previous to putting in the top. If, when the top reaches a bearer, he find the mark above the bearer, then the turning at the foreend is too fast for the motion of the top ; and if below the bearer, then the turning is too slow.</p><p>In the case of a very thick rope, the power of the men applied to the h∞k of the sledge is insufficient of itself to pass the turn up the rope. To aid them, other workmen apply the woolders at necessary intervals between the sledge and the top. The strap of the woolder is wrapped round the rope, and the pin used as a lever to heave round the twist ; the workmen at the woolders keeping time in their heaving with those at the hook of the sledge. And in the case of a heavy rope, the top sledge (fig. 13) is made use of to support the top.</p><p>The mail is used for white ropes only. When the strands are hardened, and before the top is put in, workmen rub the strands with the mail to smooth down any rough fibres, and give a good surface to the rope.</p><p>We have now seen that in the processes described, every step is dependent on the skill of the workmen. In supplying fibres of hemp in due quantity to form the thread, in giving the proper degree of twist to the thread, in giving</p><p>the strand the degree of hardness required, and in the proper speed of the laying top, the workman has no certain guide ; and it is surprising that, although machinery for the improvement of almost every other manufacture had been introduced, no attempt appears to have been made to apply it to the art under consideration, until about 1783, when a machine to supersede the necessity of a rope-ground was invented by a Mr Sylvester ; and this invention was followed up by many others. Such of these as have come under our notice are briefly described in the following account of them, arranged according to their dates.</p><p>1783.    About this time Mr Sylvester’s machinery was invented. In it the threads were spun by bobbins and spindles ; the three several quantities required for the strands were wound on three separate reels, which turned individually round their axes, and also round a common centre, by which motions the rope was formed ; and by the machinery it was further wound up as it was made. This invention was not patented, and was never carried into effect.</p><p>1784.    In this year a patent was taken out by a Mr Seymour for improvements in rope-making ; but the invention consisted in the substitution of animal for human power to drive the ordinary machinery of the rope-work.</p><p>1792.    In this year the Rev. Edward Cartwright took out a patent for a rope-machine, which he called a cordelier. A part of this machine was adopted by Mr Huddart in a patent taken out by him in 1805.</p><p>In the machines of Sylvester and Cartwright the only advantage proposed was the saving of labour. There was no attempt made to improve upon the old defective principles of rope-making ; the merit of the first attempt to do this is due to the next inventor.</p><p>1793,    March 16. John Daniel Belfour, of Elsineur, obtained a patent for machinery “ to improve the manufacture of ropes and cordage, by making every yarn employed in the composition thereof bear its proper and equal proportion cf the stress.” This the patentee proposed to effect by keeping every yarn tight at the time of its being twisted into the strand, so as to prevent its being puckered up in the inside of it. For this purpose the yarns were by machinery wound regularly on separate reels. The reels were suspended in tiers in a square frame on iron spindles on which they could turn freely ; and by a contrivance the reels could be made to turn round along with the spindles when required, and motion in a similar direction could be given to all the spindles at the same time. The yarns were spread regularly on the reels by a simple apparatus. When the yarns were so wound upon the reels in the frame, the ends of those on the first or lowest tier of reels w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ere carried down the rope-walk, and dropped into the separators, one of which was placed at every fifteen fathoms or so. These separators consisted of a series of vertical bars, fixed to a frame at their lower end, the upper ends being left free ; into the intervals between these bars the yarns were dropped, and the different tiers kept separate by horizontal iron rods passed through holes in the side bars, so as to divide the whole frame into a series of reticulations ; and these rods were so contrived as to be withdrawn separately or together. By being passed through these reticulations, the threads would be suspended at equal distances from each other from the top to the bottom of the walk, and, if meant to form one strand, would be hung on the hook which was to give them motion ; and on the reels in the frame would be left just so much yarn as the strand should ⅛ke up in hardening. The strand would then be ready for twisting ; and to do this in such a manner as to make every yam occupy its proper place, Mr Belfour employed an instrument called a top-minor. This was a block of wood formed somewhat like a sugar-loaf and having inserted round its larger circumference a number of projecting pins. Into the recesses formed by these pins the yarns were inserted, and motion being</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
