When he went to mass, for which purpose alone he left his apartment, he appeared perfectly indifferent about the event of the election. He joined no party, yet flattered all.</p><p>He knew early that there would be great divisions in the conclave, and he was aware that when the leaders of the different parties were disappointed in their own views, they all frequently agreed in the election of some old and infirm cardinal, the length of whose life would merely enable them to prepare themselves sufficiently for the next vacancy. These views directed his conduct, nor was he mistaken in his hopes of success.</p><p>Three cardinals, the leaders of opposite factions, being unable to procure the election which each of them wished, unanimously agreed to make choice of Montalto. When they came to acquaint him with their intention, he fell into such a violent fit of coughing, that every person thought he would expire on the spot. He told them that his reign would last but a few days ; that, besides a continual difficulty in breathing, he wanted strength to support such a weight, and that his small experience rendered him very unfit for so important a charge. He conjured them all three not to abandon him, but to take the whole weight of affairs upon their own shoulders; and declared that he would never accept the mitre upon any other terms. “ If you are resolved,” added he, “ to make me pope, it will only be placing yourselves on the throne. For my part, I shall be satisfied with the bare title. Let the world call me pope, and I make you heartily welcome to the power and authority.” The cardinals swallowed the bait, and exerted themselves so effectually that Montalto was elected. He now pulled off the mask which he had worn for fourteen years. No sooner was his election secured, than he started from his seat, flung down his staff in the middle of the hall, and appeared almost a foot taller than he had done for several years.</p><p>After his accession to the pontificate he sent for his family to Rome, with express orders that they should appear in a decent and modest manner. Accordingly his sister Camilla came thither, accompanied by her daughter and two grandchildren. Some cardinals, in order to pay court to the pope, went out to meet her, and introduced her in a very magnificent dress. Sixtus pretended not to know her. and asked two or three times who she was. Upon this one of the cardinals said, “ it is your sister, holy father.” “ I have but one sister,” replied Sixtus with a frown, “ and she is a poor woman at Le Grotte ; if you have introduced her in this disguise, I declare I do not know her ; yet I think I would know her again, if I saw her in the clothes she used to wear.”</p><p>Her conductors at last found it necessary to carry her to an inn, and strip her of her finery. When Camilla was introduced a second time, Sixtus embraced her tenderly, and said, “Now we know indeed that it is our sister; nobody shall make a princess of you but ourselves.” He stipulated with his sister, that she should neither ask any favour in matters of government, nor intercede for criminals, nor interfere in the administration of justice; declaring that every request of that kind would meet with a certain refusal. These terms being agreed to, and punctually observed, he made the most ample provision, not only for Camilla, but for his whole relations.</p><p>This great man was also an encourager of learning. He caused an Italian translation of the Bible to be published, which raised a good deal of discontent amongst the Catholics. When some cardinals reproached him for his conduct in this respect, he replied, “ It was published for the benefit of you cardinals who cannot read Latin.”</p><p>Sixtus died in 1590, after having reigned little more than five years. His death was ascribed to poison, said to have been administered by the Spaniards ; but the story seems rather improbable.' It was to the indulgence of a disposition naturally formed for severity, that all the defects of tins wonderful man are to be ascribed. Clemency was a stranger to his bosom ; his punishments were often too cruel, and seemed sometimes to border on revenge. But though the conduct of Sixtus seldom excites love, it generally commands our esteem, and sometimes our admiration. He strenuously defended the cause of the poor, the widow, and the orphan ; he never refused audience to the injured, however wretched or forlorn their appearance was. He never forgave those magistrates who were capable of partiality or corruption ; nor suffered crimes to pass unpunished, whether committed by the rich or the poor. He was frugal, temperate, sober, and never neglected to reward the smallest favour which had been conferred on him before his exaltation. When he mounted the throne, the treasury was not only exhausted, but in debt ; at his death it contained five millions of gold. Rome was indebted to him for several of her greatest embellishments, particularly the Vatican library ; it was by him, too, that trade was first introduced into the ecclesiastical state.</p><p>SIZAR, or SIZER, in Latin <hi rend="italic">Sizator,</hi> an appellation by which the lowest order of students in some universities are distinguished, is derived from the word <hi rend="italic">size,</hi> which has a peculiar meaning. To <hi rend="italic">size,</hi> in the language of the university, is to get any sort of victuals from the kitchens, which the students may want in their own rooms, or in addition to their commons in the hall, and for which they pay the cooks or butchers at the end of each quarter. A size of any thing is the smallest quantity of that thing which can be thus bought ; two sizes, or a part of beef, being nearly equal to what a young person will eat of that dish to his dinner, and a size of ale or beer being equal to half an English pint. In Oxford, the order similar to that of sizar is denominated servitor, a name evidently derived from the menial duties which they perform. The sizars are not upon the foundation, and therefore whilst they continue sizars, are not capable of being elected fellows; but they may at any time, if they choose, become pensioners, and they generally sit for scholarships immediately before they take their first degrees. If successful, they are then on the foundation, and are entitled to become candidates for fellowships when they have got their degree. In the mean time, whilst they continue sizars, besides free commons they enjoy many benefactions, which have been made at different times, under the name of <hi rend="italic">sizar’s prætor, exhibitions, </hi>and the like, and the rate of tuition, the rent of rooms, and other things of that sort within their respective colleges, is less than to the other orders. But though their education is thus obtained at a less expence, they are not now considered as a menial order ; for sizars, pensioner-scholars, and even sometimes fellow-commoners, mix together with the utmost cordiality.</p><p>SIZE, the name of an instrument used for finding the bigness of fine round pearls. It consists of thin pieces or leaves, about two inches in length, and half an inch in breadth, fastened together at one end by a rivet. In each of these are round holes drilled of different diameters. Those in the first leaf serve for measuring pearls from half a grain to seven grains ; those of the second for pearls from eight grains or two carats to five carats ; and those of the third, for pearls from six carats and a half to eight carats and a half.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Size</hi>, is also a sort of paint, varnish, or glue, used by painters and others. The shreds and parings of leather, parchment, or vellum, being boiled in water and strained, make size. This substance is much used in many trades. The manner of using size is to melt some of it over a gentle fire, and scraping as much whiting into it as will just colour it, let them be well incorporated together. After it</p></body></text></TEI>
