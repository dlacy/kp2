<p><span class="font0">REMAGEN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine Protince, on the left bank of the Rhine, 12 m. above Bonn, by&nbsp;the railway from Cologne to Coblenz, and at the junction of the&nbsp;Ahr valley railway to Adenau. Pop. (1900) 3534. The (Roman&nbsp;CathoUc) parish church is remarkable for a gate (Romertor)&nbsp;with grotesque sculptures of animals, dating from the 12th&nbsp;century. Archaeologists have variously interpreted its original&nbsp;purpose, whether as church door, city gate or palace gate. The&nbsp;industry of the place is almost wholly concerned with the&nbsp;preparation of wine, in which a large export trade is done.&nbsp;Just below the town, on a height overlooking the Rhine, stands&nbsp;the Apollinaris church, built 1839-53 on the site of a chapel&nbsp;formerly dedicated to St Martin, and containing the relics of&nbsp;St Apollinaris. It is a frequent place of pilgrimage from all&nbsp;parts of the lower Rhine. According to legend, the ship conveying the relics of the three kings and of Bishop Apollinaris&nbsp;from Milan to Cologne in 1164 could not be got to move away&nbsp;from the spot until the bones of St Apollinaris had been interred&nbsp;in St Martin’s chapel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Remagen (the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rigomagus</span><span class="font0"> of the Romans) originally belonged to the duchy of Jülich. Many Roman antiquities have been&nbsp;discovered here. In 1857 a votive altar dedicated to Jupiter,&nbsp;Mars and Mercury was unearthed, and is now in the Provincial&nbsp;Museum at Bonn.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">REMAINDER, REVERSION. In the view of English law a remainder or reversion is classed either as an incorporeaI&nbsp;hereditament or, ’with greater correctness, as an estate in&nbsp;expectancy. That is to say, it is a present interest subject to&nbsp;an existing estate in possession called the particular estate,&nbsp;which must determine before the estate in expectancy can&nbsp;become an estate in possession. A remainder or reversion is&nbsp;in strictness confined to real estate, whether legal or equitable,&nbsp;though a similar interest may exist in personalty. The particular estate and the remainder or reversion together make up&nbsp;the whole estate over which the grantor has power of disposition.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Accordingly a remainder or reversion limited on an estate in fee&nbsp;simple is void. The difference between a remainder and a&nbsp;reversion, stated as simply as possible, is that the latter is that&nbsp;undisposed-of part of the estate which after the determination&nbsp;of the particular estate will fall into the possession of the original&nbsp;grantor or his representative, while a remainder is that part of&nbsp;the estate which under the same circumstances will fall into the&nbsp;possession of a person other than the original grantor or his</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">representative. A reversion, in fact, is a special instance of a remainder, distinguishable from it in two important respects:&nbsp;(1) a reversion arises by operation of law on every grant of an&nbsp;estate where the whole interest is not parted with, whereas&nbsp;a remainder is created by express words; (2) tenure exists&nbsp;between the reversioner and the tenant of the particular estate,&nbsp;but not between the latter and the remainderman. Accordingly&nbsp;rent service is said to be an incident of a reversion but not of a&nbsp;remainder, and a reversioner could distrain for it at common&nbsp;law. A reversion may be limited upon any number of remainders,&nbsp;each of them as it falls into possession becoming itself a particular&nbsp;estate. A remainder or reversion may be alienated either by&nbsp;deed or by will. A conveyance by the tenant of a particular&nbsp;estate to the remainderman or reversioner is called a surrender;&nbsp;a conveyance by the remainderman or reversioner to the tenant&nbsp;is a release.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Remainder.—</span><span class="font1">Remainders are either vested or contingent. “ An estate is vested in interest when there is a present fixed right of&nbsp;future enjoyment. An estate is contingent when a right of enjoyment is to accrue on an event which is dubious and uncertain. A&nbsp;contingent remainder is a remainder limited so as to depend on an&nbsp;event or condition which may never happen or be performed, or&nbsp;which may not happen or be performed till after the determination&nbsp;of the preceding estate ” (Fearne, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Contingent Remainders,</span><span class="font0"> 2, 3).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Contingent remainders are of two kinds, those limited to uncertain&nbsp;persons and those limited on uncertain events. A grant by A to B&nbsp;for life, followed by a remainder in fee to the heir of C is an example&nbsp;of a contingent remainder.@@<sup>2</sup> Until the death of C he can have no&nbsp;heir. If C die during the lifetime of B, the contingent remainder&nbsp;of his heir becomes vested; if C survive B, the remainder is at&nbsp;common law destroyed owing to the determination of the particular estate, for every remainder must have a particular estate&nbsp;to support it. In the case of a contingent remainder, it must become&nbsp;vested during the continuance of the particular estate or at the&nbsp;instant of its determination. This rule of law no doubt arose&nbsp;from the disfavour shown by the law to contingent remainders&nbsp;on their first introduction. They were not firmly established even&nbsp;when Littleton wrote in the reign of Edward IV. (see Williams,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Real Property).</span><span class="font1"> The inconveniences resulting from this liability&nbsp;of contingent remainders to destruction were formerly overcome by&nbsp;the device of appointing trustees to preserve contingent remainders&nbsp;at law. Equitable contingent remainders, it should be noticed,&nbsp;were indestructible, for they were supported by the legal estate.&nbsp;In modern times the matter has been dealt with by act of Parliament. By the Real Property Act 1845, § 8, a contingent remainder&nbsp;is rendered capable of taking effect notwithstanding the determination by forfeiture, surrender or merger of any preceding&nbsp;estate of freehold in the same manner as if such determination had&nbsp;not happened. The case of determination by any other means&nbsp;is met by the Contingent Remainders Act 1877. The act provides&nbsp;that a contingent remainder which would have been valid as a&nbsp;springing or shifting use or executory devise or other limitation&nbsp;had it not had a sufficient estate to support it as a contingent remainder is, in the event of the particular estate determining before the&nbsp;contingent remainder vests, to be capable of taking effect as though&nbsp;the contingent remainder had originally been created as a springing&nbsp;or shifting use or executory devise or other executory' limitation.&nbsp;It will accordingly only be good if the springing use, &amp;c. (for which&nbsp;see Trust), would be good. If the springing use be void as a breach&nbsp;of the rule against perpetuities (see Perpetuity), the remainder&nbsp;will likewise be void. Apart from this act, there is some uncertainty as to the application of the rule against perpetuities to&nbsp;remainders. The better opinion is that it applies to equitable&nbsp;remainders and to legal remainders expectant upon an estate for&nbsp;life limited to an unborn person. In the latter case the rule as&nbsp;applied to contingent remainders is somewhat different from that&nbsp;affecting executory interests. The period is different, the remainder&nbsp;allowing the tying up of property for a longer time than the executory interest. There is also the further difference that the rule&nbsp;does not affect a contingent remainder if it become vested before&nbsp;the determination of the particular estate. An executory interest&nbsp;is void if it may transgress the rule, even though it do. not actually&nbsp;do so. For the rule in Shelley’s case, important in connexion&nbsp;with remainders, see that title.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The state laws of the United States affecting remainders will be found, in Washburn, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Real Property,</span><span class="font1"> ii. bk. ii. As a general&nbsp;rule contingent remainders have been rendered of little practical&nbsp;importance by enactments that they shall take effect as executory&nbsp;devises or shall not determine on determination of the particular&nbsp;estate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reversion.—</span><span class="font1">Unlike remainders, all reversions are present or vested estates. The law of reversion, like that of remainder, has&nbsp;been considerably modified by statute. It was formerly considered</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
