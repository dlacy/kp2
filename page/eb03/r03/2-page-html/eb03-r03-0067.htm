<p><span class="font1">bier, author of the Literary Hiſtory of Geneva : “ His confeſſions (ſays he) appear to me to be a very dangerous book, and paint Rouſſeau in ſuch colours as we&nbsp;would never have ventured to apply to him. The excellent analyſes which we meet with of ſome ſentiments,&nbsp;and the delicate anatomy which he makes of ſome actions, are not ſuſſicient to counterbalance the deteftable&nbsp;matter which is found in them, and the unceaſing obloquies everywhere to be met with.” It is certain,&nbsp;that if Rouſſeau has given a faithful delineation of ſome&nbsp;perſons, he has viewed others through a cloud, which&nbsp;formed in his mind perpetual ſuſpſeions. He imagined&nbsp;he thought juſtly and ſpoke truly ; but the ſimpleſt&nbsp;thing in nature, ſays M. Serv mt, if diſtilled throu⅛ his&nbsp;violent and ſuſpſeious head, might becom poiſom Rouſſeau, in what he fays of himſelf, makes ſuch acknowledgments as certainly prove that there were better&nbsp;men than he, at leaſt if we may judge him from the&nbsp;ſirſt ſix books of his memoirs, where nothing appears&nbsp;but his vices. They ought not perhaps to be ſeparated&nbsp;from the ſix laſt books, where he ſptaks of the virtues&nbsp;which make reparation ſor them ; or rather the work&nbsp;ought not to have been publiſhed at all, iſ it be truc&nbsp;(which there can be little doubt of) that in his conſeſ-ſions hς injured the public manners, both by the baſe-neſs of the vices be diſcloſed, and by the manner in&nbsp;which he united them ith the virtues. The other&nbsp;pieces which we find in this new edition oſ his works&nbsp;are, I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Reveries oſ a Solitary ÏV .ndeιer,</span><span class="font1"> being a&nbsp;journal of the latter part of his life. In this he&nbsp;confeſſes, that he liked better to ſend his children&nbsp;into hofpitals deſtined ſor orphans, than to take upon&nbsp;himſelf the charge of their maintenance and education ; and endeavours to palliate this error, which&nbsp;nothing can exculpate. 2. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cοηfιderations upon the Government oſ Poland.</span><span class="font1"> 3. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of l ord Ed&nbsp;∙tυ rd,</span><span class="font1"> a novel, being a kind of ſupplement to the new&nbsp;Heloiſa. 4· </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Famous Memoirs and Eugitive Pieces,</span><span class="font1"> with&nbsp;a great number of letters, ſome of which are very long,&nbsp;and written with too much ſtudy, but containing ſome&nbsp;eloquent paſſages and ſome deep thought. 5. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emilia&nbsp;and Sophia.</span><span class="font1"> 6. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Levite of Ephraim,</span><span class="font1"> a poem in proſe,&nbsp;in 4 cantos ; written in a truly ancient ſtyle oſ ſimplicity. 7. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mers to Sara.</span><span class="font1"> 8. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">An Opera and a Comedy.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">9. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tranβations of thefrfl book oſ Tacitus’s Hiβory, oſ&nbsp;the Epiſode of Olinda and Sophrοnia, taken from Taff),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">&amp;c. &amp;c. Like all the other writings of Rouſſeau, we&nbsp;find in theſe poſthumous pieces many admirable and&nbsp;ſome uſeful things ; but they alſo abound with contradictions, paradoxes, and ideas very unfavourable to religion. In his letters eſpecially we ſee a man chagrined at misfortunes, which he never attributes to himſelf,&nbsp;ſuſpſeious of every body about him, calling and believing himſelf a lamb in the midſt of wohes ; in one&nbsp;word, as like Paſcal in the ſtrength of his genius, as in&nbsp;his fancy of always feeing a precipice about him. This&nbsp;is the reflection oſ M. Servant, who knew him, aſſiſted&nbsp;him, and careſſed him during his retreat at Grenoble&nbsp;in 768. This magiſtrate having been very attentive&nbsp;in obſerving his character, ought the rather to be believed, as he inſpected it without either malice, envy,&nbsp;or reſcntment, and only from the concern he had for&nbsp;this philoſopher. whom he loved and admired.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">ROUT, in law, is applied to an aſſembly of perſons</span></h2>

<p><span class="font1">ROWE (Nicholas), deſcended of an ancient family in Devoriſhire, was born in 1673- He acquired a complete taſte of the claſſic authors under the fa r.ous Dr&nbsp;Buſhy in Weſtminſter ſchool; but poetry wao his early and darling ſtudy. His father, who was a lawyct,&nbsp;and de’ gned him for his own proſeſſion, entered him a&nbsp;ſtudent in the Middle Temple He made remarkable&nbsp;advances in the ſtudy of the law ; but the love of thc&nbsp;belles lettres, and of poetry in particular, ſtopt him in&nbsp;h’s career. His firſt tragedy, the Ambitious Stepmother, meeting with univerſal applauſe, he laid aſide all&nbsp;thoughts of riſing by the law. He afterward compoſed ſeveral tragedies ; but that which he valued himſelf&nbsp;moſt upon, was his Tame. lane. The others are, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fair&nbsp;Penitent Uiffs,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Royal Cοnv rt, Jane Shore,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lady J .r&gt;e G' eν.</span><span class="font1"> He alſo wrote a poem called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Piter,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and ſeveral poems upon different ſubjects, which have&nbsp;been publiſhed under the title of Mifcellane0u3 Works, in&nbsp;one volume, as his dramatic works have been in two.&nbsp;Rowe is chiefly to be conſidered (Dr Johnſon ob-ſerves) in the light of a tragic writer and a tranſlator.&nbsp;In his attempt at comedy, he failed ſo ignominiouſly,&nbsp;that his Biter is not inſerted in his works ; and his oc-ca onal poems and ſhort compofitions are rarely worthy of either praiſe or cenſure, for they ſeem the ca-ſual ſports of a mind ſeek ng rather to amuſe its leiſure&nbsp;$han to exerciſe its powers. In the conſtruction of his&nbsp;dramas there is not much art ; he is not a nice obſerver&nbsp;of the unities. He extends time, and varies place, as&nbsp;his convenience requires. To vary the place is not (in&nbsp;the opinion oſ the learned critic from whom theſe ob-ſervations are borrowed) any violation of nature, if&nbsp;the change be made between the acts ; for it is no leſs&nbsp;eaſy for the ſpectator to ſuppoſe himſelf at Athens in&nbsp;the ſecond act, than at Thebes in the ſirſt ; but to&nbsp;change the ſcent, as is done by Rowe in the middle of&nbsp;an act, is to add more acts to the play, lmce an act is&nbsp;ſo much of the bufineſs as is tranſacted without interruption. Rowe, by this licence, eaſily extricates him-ſelt from difficulties ; as in Lady Jane Gray, when we&nbsp;have been terrified with all the dreadful pomp of public&nbsp;execution, and are wondering how the heroine or the&nbsp;poet will proceed, no ſooner has Jane pronounced ſome&nbsp;prophetic rhimes, than—paſs and be gone—the ſcene&nbsp;cloſes, and Pembroke and Gardiner are ruined out upon the ſtage. I know not (ſays Dr Johnſon) that there&nbsp;can be found in his plays any deep ſearch into nature,&nbsp;any accurate diſcriminations of kindred qualities, or&nbsp;nice diſplay of paſſion in its progreſs ; all is general and&nbsp;undefined. Nor does he much intereſt or affect the auditor, except in Jane Shore, who is always ſeen and&nbsp;heard writh pity. Alicia is a character of empty noiſe,&nbsp;with no reſemblairce to real ſorrow or to natural madneſs.&nbsp;Whence then -has Rowe his reputation ? From the rea-ſonableneſs and propriety of ſome ot his ſcenes, from&nbsp;the elegance of his diction, and the ſuavity of his&nbsp;verſe. He ſeldom moves either pity or terror, but he&nbsp;often elevates the ſentiment; he ſeldom pierces the breaſt,&nbsp;but he always delights the ear, and often improves the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
