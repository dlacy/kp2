<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">IL Reproduction of Plants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The various modes by which plants are reproduced may be conveniently classified in two groups, namely, vegetative multiplication and true reproduction, the distinction&nbsp;between them being this, that, whereas in the former the&nbsp;production of the new individual may be effected by&nbsp;organs of the most various kinds, in the latter it is always&nbsp;effected by means of a specialized reproductive cell. This&nbsp;distinction will become apparent in the following discussion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vegetative Multiplication.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—The simplest case of vegetative multiplication is afforded by unicellular plants. When the cell which constitutes the body of the plant has&nbsp;attained its limit of size, it gives rise to two, either by&nbsp;division or gemmation ; the two cells then grow, and at&nbsp;the same time become separated from each other, so that&nbsp;eventually two new distinct individuals are produced, each&nbsp;of which precisely resembles the original organism. A&nbsp;good example of this is to be found in the gemmation of&nbsp;the Yeast plant. This mode of multiplication is simply&nbsp;the result of the ordinary processes of growth. All plant-cells thus grow and divide at some time of their life;&nbsp;but, whereas in a multicellular plant the products of&nbsp;division remain coherent, and add to the number of the&nbsp;cells of which the plant consists, in a unicellular plant they&nbsp;separate and constitute new individuals. In more highly&nbsp;organized plants vegetative multiplication may be effected&nbsp;by the separation of the different parts of the body from&nbsp;each other, each such part subsequently developing the&nbsp;missing members and thus constituting a new individual.&nbsp;This takes place spontaneously, and in a marked manner&nbsp;in Mosses. The main stem gradually dies away from behind forwards ; the lateral branches thus become isolated,&nbsp;and constitute new individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The remarkable regenerative capacity of plant-members is largely made use of for the artificial propagation of&nbsp;plants. A branch removed from a parent-plant will,&nbsp;under appropriate conditions, develop roots, and so constitute a new plant ; this is the theory of propagation by&nbsp;“cuttings.” A portion of a root will similarly develop&nbsp;one or more shoots, and thus give rise to a new plant.&nbsp;An isolated leaf will, in many cases, produce a shoot and&nbsp;a root, in a word, a new plant ; it is in this way that&nbsp;Begonias, for instance, are propagated. The production&nbsp;of new plants from the leaves occurs also in nature, as, for&nbsp;instance, in the so-called “ viviparous ” plants, of which&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bryophyllum calycinum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Crassulaceæ) and many Ferns&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(JV</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eplirodium </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">\Lastræa\ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Filix-mas, Asplénium \Athyrium</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">]&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Filix-fœmina,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and other species of Asplénium) are&nbsp;examples. An interesting case of the vegetative development of new individuals from other plant-organs is afforded&nbsp;by Strasburger’s observations on </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cœlebogyne ilicifolia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Funkia¡ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nothoscordum fragrans,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Citrus ; he found,&nbsp;namely, that in these plants, an adventitious formation of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> embryos takes place by budding from the tissue of the&nbsp;nucellus bounding the embryo-sac. But it is in the&nbsp;Mosses, of all plants, that the capacity for vegetative&nbsp;propagation is most widely diffused. Any part of a moss,&nbsp;whether it be the stem, the leaves, the rliizoids, or the&nbsp;sporogonium, is capable, under appropriate conditions, of&nbsp;giving rise to filamentous protonema on wdiich new moss-plants are then developed as lateral buds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In a large number of plants we find that provision is made for vegetative multiplication by the development of&nbsp;f more or less highly specialized organs. In Lichens, for&nbsp;instance, there are the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">soredia,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> wdiich are minute buds of&nbsp;the thallus containing both algal and fungal elements ;&nbsp;these are set free on the surface in large numbers, and&nbsp;each grows into a thallus. In the Characeæ there are the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bulbils</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> or “ starch-stars ״ of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chara stelligera,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> which are underground nodes, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">branches with naked base&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pro-embryonic branches</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> found by Pringsheim on old&nbsp;nodes of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chara fragilis.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> In the Mosses small tuberous&nbsp;bulbils frequently occur on the rhizoids, and in many&nbsp;instances (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bryum annotinum, Aulacomnion androgynum,&nbsp;Tetraphis pellucida</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;kc.)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> stalked fusiform or lenticular&nbsp;multicellular bodies containing· chlorophyll, termed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">gemmae,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">are produced on the shoots, either in the axils of the leaves&nbsp;or in special receptacles at the summit of the stem.&nbsp;Gemmae of this kind are produced in vast numbers in&nbsp;Marchantia and Lunularia among the Liverworts.&nbsp;Similar gemmae are also produced by the prothallia of&nbsp;Ferns. In some Ferns </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g., Nephrolepis tuberosa</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">N.&nbsp;undulata)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> the buds borne on the leaves or in their axils&nbsp;become swollen and filled with nutritive materials, constituting bulbils which fall off and give rise to new plants.&nbsp;This conversion of buds into bulbils which subserve&nbsp;vegetative multiplication occurs also occasionally among&nbsp;Phanerogams, as, for instance, in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lilium bulbiferum.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> But&nbsp;many other adaptations of the same kind occur among&nbsp;Phanerogams, notably among annuals. Bulbous plants,&nbsp;for instance, produce each year at least one bulb or corm&nbsp;from which a new plant is produced in the succeeding&nbsp;year. In other cases, as in the case of the Potato, tubers&nbsp;are developed from subterranean shoots, each of which&nbsp;in the following year gives rise to a new individual. In&nbsp;other cases, again, as in Dahlia, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Thladiantha dubia,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> &amp;c.,&nbsp;tuberous swellings are found on the roots, from each of&nbsp;which a new individual may spring.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">True Reproduction.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—It was mentioned above that the true reproduction of plants is effected by specialized cells;&nbsp;these cells may be generally designated </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">spores.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> The&nbsp;structure of a spore is essentially this : it consists of a&nbsp;nucleated mass of protoplasm, enclosing starch or oil as&nbsp;reserve nutritive material, usually enclosed by a cell-wall.&nbsp;In those cases in which the spore is capable of germinating&nbsp;immediately on its development the cell-wall is a single&nbsp;delicate membrane consisting of cellulose; but in those&nbsp;cases in which the spore may or must pass through a&nbsp;period of quiescence before germination the wall becomes&nbsp;thickened and may consist of two layers, an inner, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">endospore,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> wdiich is delicate and consists of cellulose, and&nbsp;an outer, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">exospore</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, which is thick and rigid, frequently&nbsp;darkly coloured and beset externally with spines or bosses,&nbsp;and which consists of cutin. In some few־׳ cases among&nbsp;the Fungi multicellular spores are produced; these&nbsp;approximate somewhat to the gemmae mentioned above as&nbsp;highly specialized organs for vegetative multiplication.&nbsp;In some cases, particularly among the Algae and also in&nbsp;some Fungi (Peronosporese, Saprolegnieoe, Myxomycetes,&nbsp;Cliytridiaceoe), spores are produced wdiich are for a time&nbsp;destitute of any cell-w<sup>T</sup>all, and are further peculiar in that&nbsp;they are motile, and are therefore termed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">zoospores;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> they&nbsp;move, sometimes in an amoeboid manner by the protrusion&nbsp;of pseudopodia, but more frequently they are provided&nbsp;with one, two, or many, delicate vibratile protoplasmic&nbsp;filaments, termed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cilia,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> by the lashing of wdiich the spore&nbsp;is propelled through the water. The zoospore eventually&nbsp;comes to rest, withdraws its cilia, surrounds itself wdth a&nbsp;cell-wall, and then germinates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Spores are developed in various w־ays, and a prefix is in many cases added to the w<sup>r</sup>ord “ spore ” to indicate the&nbsp;nature of the process of development. Leaving details for&nbsp;subsequent discussion, we will now confine our attention&nbsp;to the main fact that all spores are developed in one or other&nbsp;of two ways, either </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">asexually</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sexually.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> In the former&nbsp;case a single reproductive organ gives rise to cells wdiich&nbsp;are capable, each by itself, of developing into a new<sup>r&nbsp;</sup>organism ; such an organ is an asexual reproductive organ,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
