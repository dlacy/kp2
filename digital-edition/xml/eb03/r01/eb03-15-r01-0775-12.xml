<p><label>RADNOR</label>, 
the county-town of Radnorſhire, in South wales. It is a poor little place, diſtant from London about 150 miles. It is ſituated near the ſpring-head of the river Somergil, in a fruitful valley at the bottom of a hill, where there are ſheep grazing in abundance. It is a very ancient borough-town, whoſe juriſdiction extends near 12 miles round about : the government of it is veſted in a bailiff and 25 burgeſſes. Though it is the county-town, the affizes are held at Preſteign: it has one privilege, however, that is very extraordinary, beſides that of fending one member to par-liament ; and that is, it keeps a court of pleas for all actions, without being limited to any particular ſum.. It was formerly fenced with a wall and a ſtrong caſtle ⅛ but both were in a great meaſure demoliſhed by ûwen Gleπdower, when he aſſumed the title of Prince of wales, upon the depoſition of King Richard II. W. Long. 2. 45. N. Lat. 52. io.</p>
