        <p><span class="font2">slide and bed arrangement of the British “ short ” rifle. The special
                feature of the Belgian Mauser is a thin steel casing </span><span class="font1">fpr
                </span><span class="font2">the barrel,</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">which is supposed to act as a hand-guard or cooler and to free the
                barrel from disturbing influences due to its connexion with the&nbsp;fore-end; but
                it is expensive, and if strong adds unduly to the weight</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">of the weapon. The older German magazine rifle, pattern 1888, had a
                barrel casing, but this&nbsp;was given up when the new 1898 pattern
                was&nbsp;introduced. The bayonets of the Belgian and&nbsp;Spanish patterns are very
                short knives.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The Mannlicher rifle, which is extensively used for sporting and
                target work, has been&nbsp;adopted for military purposes by various
                states,&nbsp;notably Austria-Hungary. Both the 1890 and1895 patterns of Austrian
                Mannlicher have “ straight-pull”&nbsp;bolts; that is, bolts which are not turned for
                locking. The</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">bolts are in two parts, which telescope ” into each other. In the
                1890 pattern (see fig. 12), when the bolt I is home&nbsp;against the cartridge and
                the “ lever cylinder I', which carries&nbsp;the bolt knob, is further pushed
                forward, the hinged block R&nbsp;is caused to drop in front of the resistance-piece
                Q, and so locks&nbsp;the bolt I against the cartridge. ln the 1895 pattern
                (see&nbsp;fig· !3), the final pushing forward of the lever cylinder causes&nbsp;the
                head of the bolt 1 to turn and projections on its head to lock&nbsp;into recesses SS
                just in rear of the breech. The turning is due to&nbsp;helical feathers (20) on the
                inside of the lever cylinder I' Working&nbsp;in grooves in the rear of the bolt I.
                The 1890 pattern has a double&nbsp;pull-off. It will be seen from the figure that as
                the trigger is pulled&nbsp;the bearing is taken first at (8) and then at (9). This
                gives, owing</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font2">to the change of leverage, power at the commencement and rapidity
                    at the end of the pull. The weapon is a clip loader. The Dutch.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Rumanian and other Mannlichers have not straight-pull bolts, but
                    the usual turn-over levers and locking-lugs.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">France.—</span><span class="font2">The
                    breech mechanism of this rifle (see fig. 15) calls for no special remark. Its
                    bolt is. very similar to that of the British&nbsp;rifle. Its special peculiarity
                    is the once popular tube magazine&nbsp;under the fore-end. This has many defects
                    as compared with the&nbsp;box magazine. It is more cumbrous for the same number
                    of cartridges; its feed and cut-off mechanism is very complicated;
                    the&nbsp;balance of the rifle is altered as the magazine empties; the
                    placing&nbsp;of the cartridges base to point, even when the bullet has a flat
                    point,&nbsp;is not unattended with danger, especially when the magazine
                    is&nbsp;full and the spiral spring strongly compressed; lastly, loading
                    by&nbsp;any form of charger is practically impossible</span><span class="font0"
                    style="font-weight:bold;">.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">United States.—</span><span
                    class="font2">Up to 1904 the U.S. army had the Krag-Jorgensen rifle, in which,
                    as shown in fig. 17, the magazine was placed horizontally under the breech
                    action. At this time most 01 the second&nbsp;line troops had still the
                    old-fashioned (black powder) Springfield&nbsp;rifle, a single loader with a
                    hinged block similar to the rifles of the&nbsp;“ sixties ” in Europe, such as
                    the Snider, the Tabatière and the&nbsp;Werndl.@@<sup>1</sup> Since 1904, however,
                    the regular army has been re-armed&nbsp;with a short rifle (fig. 18) which in
                    its action has a general resemblance to a Mauser. As at first issued, the new
                    Springfield had a rod&nbsp;bayonet which, whbe not in use, lay within the
                    fore-end of the stock,&nbsp;and when required was run forward and fastened by a
                    catch. This&nbsp;novelty was, however, soon discarded in favour of a sword
                    bayonet&nbsp;16 in. long. The United States navy had until about 1900
                    the&nbsp;Lee “ straight-pull ” rifle. The </span><span class="font2"
