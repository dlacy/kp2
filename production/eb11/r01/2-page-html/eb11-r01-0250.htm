<p><span class="font1">parliament (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inst.,</span><span class="font1"> vol. iv. p</span><span class="font2">. </span><span class="font1">58), and in modern times provision for a regency has always been made by act of parliament. In Scotland&nbsp;the appointment of regents was always cither by the assent of a&nbsp;council or of parliament. Thus in 1315 the earl of Moray was appointed regent by Robert I. in a council. At a later period appointment by statute was the universal form. Thus by an act of 1542&nbsp;the earl of Arran was declared regent during the minority of Mary.&nbsp;By an act of 1567 the appointment by Mary of the earl of Moray as&nbsp;regent was confirmed. As late as 1704 provision was made for a&nbsp;regency after the death of Anne. The earliest regency in England&nbsp;resting upon an express statute was that created by 28 Hen. VIII.&nbsp;c. 7, under which the king appointed his executors to exercise the&nbsp;authority of the crown till the successor to the crown should attain&nbsp;the age of eighteen if a male or sixteen if a female. They delegated&nbsp;their rights to the protector Somerset, with the assent of the lords&nbsp;spiritual and temporal. No other example of a statutory provision&nbsp;for a regency occurs till 1751. In that year the act of 24 Geo. II.&nbsp;c. 24 constituted the princess-dowager of Wales regent of the kingdom&nbsp;in case the crown should descend to any of her children before such&nbsp;child attained the age of eighteen. A council, called the council of&nbsp;regency, was appointed to assist the princess. A prescribed oath&nbsp;was to be taken by the regent and members of the council. Their&nbsp;consent was necessary for the marriage of a successor to the crown&nbsp;during minority. It was declared to be unlawful for the regent to&nbsp;make war or peace, or ratify any treaty with any foreign power, or&nbsp;prorogue, adjourn or dissolve any parliament without the consent of&nbsp;the majority of the council of regency, or give her assent to any bill&nbsp;for repealing or varying the Act of Settlement, the Act of Uniformity,&nbsp;or the Act of the Scottish parliament for securing the Protestant&nbsp;religion and Presbyterian church government in Scotland (1707, c. 6).&nbsp;The last is an invariable provision, and occurs in all subsequent&nbsp;Regency Acts. The reign of George III. affords examples of provision&nbsp; for a regency during both the infancy and incapacity of a&nbsp;king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The act of 5 Geo. III. c. 27 vested in the king power to appoint  a regent under the sign manual, such regent to be one of&nbsp;certain named members of the royal family. The remaining provisions closely followed those of the act of George II. In 1788 the&nbsp;insanity of the king led to the introduction of a Regency bill. In&nbsp;the course of the debate in the House of Lords the duke of York&nbsp;disclaimed on behalf of the prince of Wales any right to assume the&nbsp;regency without the consent of parliament. Owing to the king’s&nbsp;recovery the bill ultimately dropped. On a return of the malady in&nbsp;1810 the act of 51 Geo. III. c. 1 was passed, appointing the prince&nbsp;of Wales regent during the king’s incapacity. The royal assent was&nbsp;given by commission authorized by resolution of both Houses. By&nbsp;this act no council of regency was appointed. There was no&nbsp;restriction on the regent’s authority over treaties, peace and war,&nbsp;or parliament, as in the previous acts, but his power of granting&nbsp;peerages, offices and pensions was limited. At the accession of&nbsp;William IV. the duchess of Kent was, by 1 Will. IV. c. 2, appointed&nbsp;regent, if necessary, until the Princess Victoria should attain the&nbsp;age of eighteen. No council of regency was appointed. By 1 Vict.&nbsp;c. 72 lords justices were nominated as a kind of regency council&nbsp;without a regent in case the successor to the crown should be out&nbsp;of the realm at the queen’s death. They were restricted from&nbsp;granting peerages, and from dissolving parliament without directions from the successor. By 3 &amp; 4 Vict. c. 52 Prince Albert was&nbsp;appointed regent in case any of Queen Victoria’s children should&nbsp;succeed to the crown under the age of eighteen. The only restraint&nbsp;on his authority was the usual prohibition to assent to any bill&nbsp;repealing the Act of Settlement, &amp;c. When George V. came to the&nbsp;throne a Regency Bill was again required, as his eldest son was under&nbsp;age, and Queen Mary was appointed. By 10 Geo. IV. c. 7 the&nbsp;office of regent of the United Kingdom cannot be held by a Roman&nbsp;Catholic. A similar disability is imposed in most, if not all, Regency&nbsp;Acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REGGIO CALABRIA (anc. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Regium, q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> a town and archiepiscopal  see of Calabria, Italy, capital of the province of&nbsp;Reggio, on the Strait of Messina, 248 m. S.S.E. from Naples&nbsp;by rail. Pop. (1906) 39,941 (town); 48,362 (commune). It is&nbsp;the terminus of the railways from Naples along the west coast,&nbsp;and from Metaponto along the east coast of Calabria. The&nbsp;straits are here about 7 m. wide, and the distance to Messina&nbsp;nearly 10 m. The ferryboats to Messina therefore cross by&nbsp;preference from Villa S. Giovanni, 8 m. N. of Reggio, whence&nbsp;the distance is only 5 m. In 1894 the town suffered from an&nbsp;earthquake, though less severely. than in 1783. It was totally&nbsp;destroyed, however, by the great earthquake of December 1908;&nbsp;in the centre of the town about 35,000 out of 40,000 persons&nbsp;perished. The cathedral, which dated from the 17th century,&nbsp;and the ancient castle which rose above it, were wrecked.&nbsp;Great damage was done by a seismic wave following the shock.&nbsp;The sea front was swept away, and the Level of the land hereabouts was lowered. (See further Messina.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REGGIO NELL’ EMILIA, a city and episcopal see of Emilia, Italy, the capital of the province of Reggio nell’ Emilia (till&nbsp;1859 part of the duchy of Modena), 38 m. by rail N.W. of Bologna.&nbsp;Pop. (1906) 19,681 (town); 64,548 (commune). The cathedral&nbsp;, originally erected in the 12th century, was reconstructed&nbsp;in the 15th and 16th; the façade shows traces of both periods,&nbsp;the Renaissance work being complete only in the lower portion.&nbsp;S. Prospero, close by, has a façade of 1504, in which are incorporated&nbsp; six marble lions belonging to the original Romanesque&nbsp;edifice. The Madonna della Ghiara, built in 1597 in the form&nbsp;of a Greek cross, and restored in 1900, is beautifully proportioned&nbsp;and finely decorated in stucco and with frescoes of the Bolognese&nbsp;school of the early 17th century. There are several good palaces&nbsp;of the early Renaissance, a fine theatre (1857) and a museum&nbsp;containing important palaeo-ethnological collections, ancient&nbsp;and medieval sculptures, and the natural history collection&nbsp;of Spallanzani. Lodovico Ariosto, the poet (1474-1533), was&nbsp;born in Reggio, and his father’s house is still preserved. The&nbsp;industries embrace the making of cheese, objects in cement,&nbsp;matches, and brushes, the production of silkworms, and printing;&nbsp;and the town is the centre of a rich agricultural district. It&nbsp;lies on the main line between Bologna and Milan, and is connected by branch lines with Guastalla and Sassuolo (hence a&nbsp;line to Modena).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Regium Lepidi or Regium Lepidum was probably founded by M. Aemilius Lepidus at the time of the construction of the Via&nbsp;Aemilia (187 </span><span class="font0">B.C</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.). </span><span class="font1">It lay upon this road, half-way between Mutina&nbsp;and Parma. It was during the Roman period a flourishing municipium, but perhaps never became a colony ; and it is associated with&nbsp;no event more interesting than the assassination of M. Brutus, the&nbsp;father of Cæsar’s friend and foe. The bishopric dates perhaps from&nbsp;the 4th century A.D.  Under the Lombards the town was the seat&nbsp;of dukes and counts; in the 12th and 13th centuries it formed a&nbsp;flourishing republic, busied in surrounding itself with walls (1229),&nbsp;controlling the Crostolo and constructing navigable canals to the Po,&nbsp;coining money of its own, and establishing prosperous schools.&nbsp;About 1290 it first passed into the hands of Obizzo d’Este, and the&nbsp;authority of the Este family was after many vicissitudes more&nbsp;formally recognized in 1409. In the contest for liberty which began&nbsp;in 1796 and closed with annexation to Piedmont in 1859, Reggio&nbsp;took vigorous part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REGICIDE (Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rex,</span><span class="font2"> a king, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">caedere,</span><span class="font2"> to kiwi), the name given to any one who kills a sovereign. Regicides is the name&nbsp;given in English history at the Restoration of 1660 to those&nbsp;persons who were responsible for the execution of Charles I.&nbsp;On the 4th of April 1660 charges II. in the Declaration of Breda&nbsp;promised a free pardon to all his subjects “ excepting only such&nbsp;persons as shall hereafter be excepted by parliament,” and on&nbsp;the 14th of May the House of Commons ordered the immediate&nbsp;arrest of “ all those persons who sat in judgment upon the late&nbsp;king’s majesty when sentence was pronounced.” The number&nbsp;of regicides was estimated at 84, this number being composed&nbsp;of the 67 present at the last sitting of the court of justice,&nbsp;ii others who had attended earlier sittings, 4 officers of the&nbsp;court and the 2 executioners. Many of them were arrested or&nbsp;surrendered themselves, and the House of Commons in considering&nbsp; the proposed bill of indemnity suggested that only&nbsp;twelve of the regicides, who were named, should forfeit their&nbsp;lives; but the House of Lords urged that all the king’s judges,&nbsp;with three exceptions, and some others, should be treated in&nbsp;this way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Eventually a compromise was agreed upon, and the bill as passed on the 29th of August 1660 divided the regicides into six classes for&nbsp;punishment: (1) Four of them, although dead—Cromwell, Ireton,&nbsp;Bradshaw and Pride—were to be attainted for high treason.&nbsp;(2) The estates of twenty others, also dead, were to be subjected to&nbsp;fine or forfeiture. </span><span class="font2">(3) </span><span class="font1">Thirty living regicides were excepted from all&nbsp;indemnity. (4) Nineteen living regicides were also excepted, but&nbsp;with a saving clause that their execution was to be suspended until&nbsp;a special act of parliament was passed for this purpose. (5) Six&nbsp;others were to be punished, but not capitally. (6) Two, Colonels&nbsp;Hutchinson and Thomas Lister, were simply declared incapable&nbsp;of holding any office. Two regicides—Ingoldsby, who declared he&nbsp;had only signed the warrant under compulsion, and Colonel Matthew&nbsp;Thomlinson—escaped without punishment. A court of thirty-four&nbsp;commissioners was then appointed to try the regicides, and the&nbsp;trial took place in October 1660. Twenty-nine were condemned </span><span class="font2">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">death, but only ten were actually executed, the remaining nineteen</span></p>
