<p><span class="font0">the Baltic, and the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland, their present forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The great mineral repositories of this empire occur in the Ural and Altaic chains; those in European Russia are&nbsp;few in number, and of little importance. A tract called&nbsp;the central mining district of Russia extends from the Oka&nbsp;to near the town of Kalouga, including portions of the governments OfNiznei-Novgorod<sub>1</sub> Vladimir, Tambov, Riazan,&nbsp;and Kalouga. But it is for the most part a poor sandy district,&nbsp;containing iron ore ; and as the metal is manufactured in&nbsp;the localities where it is found, several extensive iron-works&nbsp;are situated at intervals along the line mentioned. The&nbsp;ore is described as occurring in regular beds, sixty feet below the surface. It is of several varieties, the lightest coloured producing the most iron. Few minerals occur in&nbsp;that large and sandy plain which we have noticed as forming the northern and central portion of Poland. The land,&nbsp;as in all the northern countries on our globe, is incrusted&nbsp;with a ferruginous deposit, and every marsh and every&nbsp;meadow contains iron in a greater or less proportion. The&nbsp;iron is of indifferent quality ; and the existing veins of lead,&nbsp;gold, and silver, which, it appears, were once productive,&nbsp;lie beyond the Russian territory. At Petrozavodsk, near&nbsp;Lake Onega, in Finland, there are iron-works, which, it is&nbsp;believed, are the largest in the north of Russia. Bog-iron&nbsp;ore abounds in the neighbourhood ; and for a long time this&nbsp;was the only kind smelted ; but thirteen different mines are&nbsp;now wrought. Vast quantities are obtained by simply&nbsp;dragging the lakes. Another great iron-work of the same&nbsp;description is situated four versts from St Petersburg, on&nbsp;the road to Riga. Finland also yields copper and tin, but&nbsp;only one mine of the former is wrought. Coal is found in&nbsp;very inconsiderable quantities in European Russia. There&nbsp;is a small mine worked at Tula, another at Bakhmout in&nbsp;the government of Ikaterinoslav, but neither seem to be&nbsp;of much utility. In Southern Poland and Cracow there&nbsp;are numerous beds of black bituminous coal, resembling&nbsp;that of Great Britain, some of which are thirty feet in&nbsp;thickness. These occur in the secondary formation. In&nbsp;the tertiary districts deposits of brown coal are met with,&nbsp;which also yields amber, the exudation of a dicotyledonous&nbsp;tree. Russia possesses a great treasure in the numerous&nbsp;salt-lakes and marshes of the Siberian steppes, and the&nbsp;country to the north of the Caspian Sea. There are also&nbsp;mines of salt dispersed throughout the empire, and from&nbsp;these sources immense quantities are annually obtained,&nbsp;the amount increasing indefinitely with the population.&nbsp;There is a tract of country called the Northern Salt District, which stretches in a line parallel with the Petersburg&nbsp;limestone, for a thousand versts. It makes its first appearance in the island of Oesel, and is w<sup>τ</sup>orked in several parts of&nbsp;the south of Livonia. Quarries of gypsum are also situated in this great tract. A central salt district is described&nbsp;as existing in the course of the Volga. Along the course&nbsp;of the river Kama there is also a rich and extensive marl,&nbsp;salt, and gypsum tract, probably connected on the south&nbsp;with that of the Volga, and on the north with that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font0"> Vologda. The principal salt-works are in the neighbourhood&nbsp;of Solikamsk ; and the gypsum grottoes of Koungour, in&nbsp;the government of Perm, are of great size and magnificence.&nbsp;There are in Poland large mines of rock-salt, which annually yield immense supplies of the article. They form part&nbsp;of that enormous layer of fossil-salt which extends along&nbsp;the Carpathian Mountains, and is large enough to supply&nbsp;the consumption of all the nations of the earth for an indefinite period of time. Copper-sand is found throughout a&nbsp;vast tract of country extending over the governments of&nbsp;Perm, Viatka, and Oufa. It completely skirts the south&nbsp;and west sides of the Ural Mountains. The sand is of a&nbsp;dull red or green colour, and is usually worked for copper.&nbsp;It contains fossil-wood impregnated with the metal. But</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">it is in the Asiatic territory of Russia that the most abundant mines of copper are found, as well as those of gold, silver, platina, and other metals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In a country of such vast dimensions, the soil must of course vary considerably in different situations. There is a&nbsp;vast tract of territory 65,000 geographical square leagues&nbsp;in extent, which possesses a peculiar and rather remarkable&nbsp;soil. Indeed, Ritter, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Erdhunde,</span><span class="font0"> informs us that&nbsp;there is only one other place on the surface of the earth&nbsp;where any thing similar in soil has been discovered, and&nbsp;that is the north of Hindustan. It consists entirely of decomposed vegetable matter, and is deposited in a thick&nbsp;layer. It is situated in the south of Russia, stretching in&nbsp;a broad belt from Volhynia in a north-easterly direction,&nbsp;to the foot of the Ural chain, near Perm. It is prolonged&nbsp;on one side from this to the shores of the Black Sea ; and&nbsp;on the other it stretches from Perm to Orenburg, and thence&nbsp;to the Caspian Sea. All this vast tract, exceeding in extent France, Spain, and Prussiaunited, is covered throughout with a stratum of vegetable mould, which varies in&nbsp;thickness from three to five feet. It is so extremely productive as to stand in no need of manure. Its fertility is&nbsp;shown in the large returns of grain, especially rye, which it&nbsp;yields, and in the excellent breeds of cattle which are reared upon it. From the thinness of the population, this vegetable mould is far from being wholly laid out in corn -fields ;&nbsp;vast tracts still remaining unoccupied. The soils of the&nbsp;steppes which cover so large a portion of the surface of&nbsp;Russia we have already adverted to when describing these&nbsp;plains. What remains to be said regarding the soil of this&nbsp;country must be stated in reference to specific localities, a&nbsp;general description being impracticable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The country between the Dniester and the Dnieper has a soil impregnated with nitre, a substance deleterious to vegetation ; yet, as soon as it is removed or diminished, wheat,&nbsp;millet, and the arbute melon, may be cultivated with great&nbsp;success. The mildest and most fruitful region in all the&nbsp;Russian empire is that continuation of valleys arranged in&nbsp;natural amphitheatres at the southern base of Taurida,&nbsp;along the coasts of the Black Sea. Proceeding eastward,&nbsp;we meet the government of Astracan, only part of the&nbsp;soil of which is fertile. This portion includes the low districts on the banks of the Volga, the Ural, and the Terek,&nbsp;and is by no means large ; but here vegetables attain an&nbsp;enormous size. The soil is impregnated with saline and&nbsp;bituminous substances. Higher up, the land on the Volga&nbsp;becomes sandy and unproductive. The soil of Little Russia and the Polish Ukraine is partly sandy and not very&nbsp;fruitful, partly very rich and fertile. A great part of&nbsp;Western Russia is sandy, and intersected by vast marshes&nbsp;and bogs. Large tracts are covered with immense forests,&nbsp;the retreat of the bear, wolf, and wild boar; whilst not&nbsp;an inconsiderable portion of this westerly territory ranks&nbsp;amongst the most fertile in the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It thus appears, with regard to the soil of Russia, taking a summary view of it along with the climate, that from the&nbsp;forty-fourth to the fiftieth parallel of north latitude, comprising Bessarabia, Podolia, Kherson, Ikaterinoslav, and&nbsp;Taurida, it is for the most part low and level, little wooded, partly very fruitful, partly arid and unfruitful, and here&nbsp;and there impregnated with salt. The winters are short,&nbsp;with little snow; but in some parts the cold is severe. The&nbsp;spring is early and mild ; the summer is of long duration,&nbsp;with oppressive heat and little rain ; autumn follows late&nbsp;in the year. In the heat of summer a dangerous disease&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jassia</span><span class="font0"> is generated ; it is fatal to the lower animals&nbsp;as well as to man. Violent whirlwinds are frequent. The&nbsp;south of Russia is subject to a north-easterly wind called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mitel,</span><span class="font0"> often accompanied by snow, which is drifted with&nbsp;great violence, and much dreaded by the inhabitants. The&nbsp;middle or temperate district, extending from 50° to 57°,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
