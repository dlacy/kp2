<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">its small paintings, especially that of the Annunciation to the Virgin, are interesting as showing his careful study&nbsp;of the rules of perspective.@@<sup>1</sup> Several&nbsp;preparatory sketches&nbsp;for this picture exist :&nbsp;fig. 1 shows a study,&nbsp;now at Lille, for the&nbsp;two principal figures,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Christ setting the crown on His mother’s&nbsp;head (see fig. 2). It&nbsp;is drawn from two&nbsp;youths in the ordinary dress of the&nbsp;time; and it is interesting to compare&nbsp;it with his later&nbsp;studies from the&nbsp;nude, many of which&nbsp;are for figures which&nbsp;in the future picture&nbsp;were to be draped,&nbsp;made at a time when his developed style required a more&nbsp;careful rendering of the human form than was necessary&nbsp;for the simpler and more religious manner of Perugia.&nbsp;It was at Florence, as Vasari says, that Raphael began</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">serious life studies, not only from nude models but also by making careful anatomical drawings from dissected&nbsp;corpses and from skeletons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">His first visit to Florence lasted only a few months; in 1505 he was again in Perugia painting his first fresco,&nbsp;the Trinity and Saints for the Camaldoli monks of San&nbsp;Severo, now a mere wreck from injury and restorations.&nbsp;The date MDV and the signature were added later, probably in 1521. Part of this work was left incomplete by the&nbsp;painter, and the fresco was finished in 1521 (after his</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">death) by his old master Perugino.@@<sup>2</sup> It was probably earlier than this that Raphael visited Siena and assisted&nbsp;Pinturicchio with sketches for his Piccolomini frescos.@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>The Madonna of S. Antonio was also finished in 1505,&nbsp;but was probably begun before the Florentine visit.@@<sup>4</sup> A&nbsp;record of his visit to Siena exists in a sketch of the&nbsp;antique marble group of the Three Graces, then in the&nbsp;cathedral library, from which, not long afterwards, he&nbsp;painted the small panel of the same subject now in Lord&nbsp;Dudley’s collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1506 Raphael was again in Urbino, where he painted for the duke another picture of St George, which was sent&nbsp;to England as a present to Henry VII. The bearer of this&nbsp;and other gifts was Guidobaldo’s ambassador, the accomplished Baldassare </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Castiglione </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a friend of Raphael’s,&nbsp;whose noble portrait of him is in the Louvre. At the&nbsp;court of Duke Guidobaldo the painter’s ideas appear to&nbsp;have been led into a more secular direction, and to this&nbsp;stay in Urbino probably belong the Dudley Graces, the&nbsp;miniature Knight’s Dream of Duty and Pleasure in the&nbsp;National Gallery (London),@@<sup>5</sup> and also the Apollo and&nbsp;Marsyas, sold in 1882 by Mr Morris Moore to the Louvre&nbsp;for ¿10,000, a most lovely little panel, painted with&nbsp;almost Flemish minuteness, rich in colour, and graceful in&nbsp;arrangement.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Towards the end of 1506 Raphael returned to Florence, and there (before 1508) produced a large number of his&nbsp;finest works, carefully finished, and for the most part&nbsp;wholly the work of his own hand. Several of these are&nbsp;signed and dated, but the date is frequently very doubtful,&nbsp;owing to his custom of using Roman numerals, introduced&nbsp;among the sham Arabic embroidered on the borders of&nbsp;dresses, so that the I’s after the V are not always distinguishable from the straight lines of the ornament. The&nbsp;following is a list of some of his chief paintings of this&nbsp;period:—the Madonna del Gran Duca (Pitti); Madonna del&nbsp;Giardino, 1506 (Vienna); Holy Family with the Lamb,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1506 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or 1507 (Madrid); the Ansidei Madonna, 1506 or</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1507 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(National Gallery); theBorghese Entombment, 1507;&nbsp;Lord Cowper’s Madonna at Panslianger, 1508; La bella&nbsp;Giardiniera, 1508 (Louvre); the Eszterhazy Madonna, probably the same year; as well as the Madonna del Cardellino&nbsp;(Uffizi), the Tempi Madonna (Munich), the Colonna&nbsp;Madonna (Berlin), the Bridgew<sup>r</sup>ater Madonna (Bridgewater&nbsp;House), and the Orleans Madonna (Due d’Aumale’s collection). The Ansidei Madonna was bought in 1884 for&nbsp;the National Gallery from the duke of Marlborough for&nbsp;£70,000, more than three times the highest price ever&nbsp;before given for a picture.@@<sup>7</sup> It was painted for the Ansidei</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> While at Florence he is said to have taught the science of perspective to his friend Fra Bartolomeo, who certainly gave his young instructor valuable lessons on composition in return.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fresco of the Last Supper, dated 1505, in the refectory of S.&nbsp;Onofrio at Florence is not now claimed as a work of Raphael’s, in spite&nbsp;of a signature partly introduced by the restorer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raphael probably had no hand in the actual execution of the&nbsp;paintings ; see Sehmarsow, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Raphael und Rinturicchio in Siena,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Stuttgart, 1880, and Milanesi, in bis edition of Vasari, iii. p. 515 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">sq.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">appendix to life of Pinturicchio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@4</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fine altar-piece, with many large figures, is now the property&nbsp;of the heirs of the duke of Ripalta, and is stored in the basement of&nbsp;the National Gallery, London.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@5</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This missal-like painting is about 7 inches square ; it was bought&nbsp;in 1847 for 1000 guineas. The National Gallery also possesses its&nbsp;cartoon, in brown ink, pricked for transference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@6</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In spite of some adverse opinions, frequently expressed with ex ■&nbsp;treme virulence, the genuineness of this little gem can hardly be&nbsp;doubted by any one who carefully studies it without bias. Sketches&nbsp;for it at Venice and in the Uffìzi also appear to bear the impress of&nbsp;Raphael’s manner. See Delaborde, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Études sur les B. Arts ... en&nbsp;Italie</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, i. p. 236; Gruyer, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Raphaël et VAntiquité,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> ii. p. 421 ; Eitelberger,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Rafael's Apollo und Marsyas,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Vienna, 1860 ; Batté, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Le Raphaël de M.&nbsp;Moore,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Paris, 1859 ; and also various pamphlets on it by its former&nbsp;owner, Mr Morris Moore.</span></p>
