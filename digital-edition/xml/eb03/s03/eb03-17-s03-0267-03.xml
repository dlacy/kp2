the leaf of the caſſia ſenna of Linnæus. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cassia.</hi></p><p>Senna appears to have been cultivated in England in the time of Parkinſon (1640) ; and Miller tells us, that by keeping theſe plants in a hot-bed all the ſummer, he frequently had them in flower ; but adds, it is very rarely that they perfect their feeds in England. There can be little doubt, however, but that ſome of the Britiſh poſſeſſions may be found well enough adapted to the growth of this vegetable, and that the patriotic views of the Society for encouraging Arts, &amp;c. which has offered a reward to thoſe who ſucceed in the attempt, will be ultimately accompliſhed.</p><p>Senna, which is in common uſe as a purgative, was firſt known to the Arabian phyſicians Serapion and Meſue : the firſt among the Greeks who takes any notice of it is Actuarius, but he only ſpeaks of the fruit, and not of the leaves. To remove the diſagreeable taſte of this medicine, Dr Cullen recommends coriander feeds; and, for preventing the gripings with which it is sometimes attended, he thinks the warmer aromatics, as cardamoms or ginger, would be more effectual.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Senna Italica,</hi> or blunt-leaved ſenna, is a variety of the Alexandrian ſpecies; which, by its cultivation in the ſouth of France (Provence), has been found to asſume this change. It is leſs purgative than the pointed-leaved ſenna, and is therefore to be given in larger doses. It was employed as a cathartic by Dr Wright at Jamaica, where it grows on the ſand-banks near the sea.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
