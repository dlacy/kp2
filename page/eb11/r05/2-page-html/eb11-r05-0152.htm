<p><span class="font3">equal in rank with the head of the Holy Roman Empire. Gradually, however, the chancelleries had to withdraw their&nbsp;protests, for it came to be generally recognized that the semi-barbarian, who died at the early age of fifty-three, had transformed the oriental tsardom of Muscovy into a state of the&nbsp;Western type and had made it a powerful member of the&nbsp;European family of nations (see Peter I.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">IV. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Modern Empire.—</span><span class="font3">On the death of Peter (1725) the internal tranquillity and progress of the empire were again&nbsp;seriously threatened by the uncertainty of the order of succession, and the autocratic power which he had wielded so vigorously passed into the hands of a series of weak, indolent&nbsp;sovereigns who were habitually guided by personal caprice and&nbsp;the advice of intriguing favourites rather than by serious political considerations. During this period, which lasted from 1725&nbsp;to 1762, the male line of the Romanov dynasty became extinct,&nbsp;and the succession passed to various members of the female fine,&nbsp;which intermarried with German princes. In this way German&nbsp;influence was enormously increased, and was represented by&nbsp;men of considerable capacity holding the highest official positions, such as Biren, Miinnich and Ostermann. The main events&nbsp;of the period may be summarized very briefly. Peter, by his&nbsp;first marriage, had a son, the unhappy cesarevich Alexius (q.v.),&nbsp;who figures more largely in imaginative literature than in&nbsp;history—a narrow-minded, obstinate, pious youth, who had&nbsp;no sympathy with his father's violent innovations, and was&nbsp;completely under the influence of the old Muscovite reactionary&nbsp;faction. Intimidated by the paternal anger and threats he took&nbsp;refuge in Austria, and when he had been induced by illusory&nbsp;promises to return to Russia he was tried for high treason by a&nbsp;special tribunal, and after being subjected to torture died in&nbsp;prison (1718). To avert the danger of a man of this type&nbsp;succeeding to the throne Peter made a law by which the reigning&nbsp;sovereign might choose his successor according to his own&nbsp;judgment, and two years later he caused his second wife,&nbsp;Catherine, the daughter of a Lithuanian peasant, to&nbsp;be crowned with all due solemnity, “ in recognition&nbsp;of the courageous services rendered by her to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Russian Empire.” This gave Catherine a certain right to the throne at her husband’s death, and her claims were&nbsp;supported by Peter’s most influential coadjutors, especially&nbsp;by Prince Menshikov, an ambitious man of humble origin who&nbsp;had been raised by his patron to the highest offices of state.&nbsp;On the other hand the great nobles of more conservative&nbsp;tendencies wished to get the young son of the cesarevich&nbsp;Alexius made emperor under their own control. The former&nbsp;faction triumphed, and Catherine reigned for about a year and&nbsp;a half, after which the son of the cesarevich Alexius, Peter II.,&nbsp;occupied the throne from 1727 to 1730. At first he&nbsp;was under the tutelage of Menshikov, who wished him&nbsp;to marry his daughter, but he soon contrived, with&nbsp;the aid of the Dolgorukis and other old families, to get&nbsp;his imperious tutor arrested and exiled to Siberia. The Dol-gorukis and their friends thus came into power, and on the&nbsp;death of Peter II. in 1730 they offered the throne to Anne,&nbsp;duchess of Courland, a daughter of Ivan V., elder brother&nbsp;of Peter the Great, on condition of her signing a formal document by which the seat of government should be transferred&nbsp;from St Petersburg to Moscow, and the autocratic power should&nbsp;be limited and controlled by a grand council composed of their&nbsp;own faction. Anne accepted the condition and&nbsp;became empress, but when she discovered that the&nbsp;attempt to limit her powers in favour of a small&nbsp;conservative oligarchy was extremely unpopular among all&nbsp;classes, she submitted the question to an assembly of 800&nbsp;ecclesiastical and lay dignitaries, and at their request the&nbsp;unlimited autocratic rule was re-established. Her reign</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(1730-40) was a régime of methodical German despotism on the Unes laid down by her uncle, Peter the Great, and as she&nbsp;was naturally indolent and much addicted to frivolous amusements, the administration was directed by her favourite Biren&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font3"> and other men of German origin. Having no male issue,&nbsp;she chose as her successor the infant son of her niece, Anna&nbsp;Leopoldovna, duchess of Brunswick, and at her death the&nbsp;child was duly proclaimed emperor, under the name of Ivan VI.,&nbsp;but in little more than a year he was dethroned by the partisans&nbsp;of the Princess Elizabeth, a daughter of Peter the Great and&nbsp;Catherine I. As a true daughter of the great Russian&nbsp;reformer, Elizabeth (1741-61) relegated the German&nbsp;element to a subordinate position in the administration and gave her confidence to genuine Russians like&nbsp;Bestuzhev, Vorontsov, Razumovski (her morganatic husband)&nbsp;and the Shuvalovs. Her hatred of Germans showed itself likewise in her persistent struggle with Frederick the Great, which&nbsp;cost Russia 300,000 men and 30 millions of roubles—an enormous sum for those days—but in the choice of a successor she&nbsp;could not follow her natural inclinations, for among the few&nbsp;descendants of Michael Romanov there was no one, even in the&nbsp;female line, who could be called a genuine Russian. She proclaimed, therefore, as heir-apparent the son of her deceased&nbsp;elder sister Anna, Charles Peter Ulrich, duke of Holstein-Gottorp, a German in character, habits and religion, and tried&nbsp;to Russianize him by making him adopt the Eastern Orthodox&nbsp;faith and live in St Petersburg during the whole of her reign;&nbsp;but her well-meant efforts were singularly unsuccessful. Impervious to Russian influence, he remained true to his original&nbsp;nationality, and by his undisguised aversion to everything in&nbsp;his adopted country and his passionate, childish admiration&nbsp;of Frederick the Great, he made himself so unpopular that within&nbsp;a few months of his accession, in December 1761, he was&nbsp;dethroned and assassinated by the partisans of his ambitious&nbsp;and able consort, the famous Catherine II. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the long reign of Catherine II. (1762-96) Russia made rapid progress in civilization, and came to be fully recognized as one of the Great Powers. Coming after a&nbsp;series of incompetent rulers, the German princess&nbsp;proved herself a worthy successor to Peter the Great&nbsp;both in home and in foreign affairs; but she was not a&nbsp;mere imitator. Peter had endeavoured to import from western&nbsp;Europe the essentials of good government and such of the&nbsp;useful arts as were required for the development of the natural&nbsp;resources of the country; Catherine did likewise, but she did&nbsp;not restrict herself to purely utilitarian aims in the narrower&nbsp;sense of the term. She strove to impart also something of the&nbsp;refinement and ornamental attributes of Western civilization,&nbsp;and aspired to raise her adopted fatherland intellectually&nbsp;and artistically to the west-European level. This new departure she lost no time in proclaiming to the world. Within&nbsp;a few months of her accession, having heard tha't the publication of the famous French </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopédie</span><span class="font3"> was in danger of being&nbsp;stopped by the French government on account of its irreh’gious&nbsp;spirit, she proposed to Diderot that he should complete his&nbsp;great work in Russia under her protection. Four years later&nbsp;she endeavoured to embody in a legislative form the principles&nbsp;of enlightenment which she had imbibed from the study of the&nbsp;French philosophers. A Grand Commission, which might be&nbsp;called a consultative parliament, composed of 652 members&nbsp;of all classes—officials, nobles, burghers and peasants—and</span></p>
