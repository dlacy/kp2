<p><span class="font2">scales, notably in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Acanthophis.</span><span class="font2"> The use of such a tail probably consists in attracting or fixing the attention of small animals,&nbsp;by slightly raising and vibrating the tip. The rattle no doubt&nbsp;acts as a warning, every snake preferring being left alone to&nbsp;being forced to bite. Many a man has been warned in time by&nbsp;the shrill sound, and this principle applies undoubtedly to other&nbsp;mammals. Moreover, rattlesnakes are rather sluggish, and&nbsp;comparatively not vicious. First they try to slink away;&nbsp;when overtaken or cornered they use every means of frightening&nbsp;the foe by swelling up, puffing, rattling and threatening atti-tudes; it is as a rule not until they are touched, or provoked&nbsp;by a rapid movement, that they retaliate, but then they strike&nbsp;with fury. They are viviparous, and as destroyers of rats, mice&nbsp;and other small rodents they are useful. The surest way of&nbsp;clearing a ground of them and any other snakes is to drive in&nbsp;pigs, which are sure to find and to eat them, without harm to&nbsp;themselves. They inhabit localities to which the sun has free&nbsp;access, prairies, rough stony ground, &amp;c. Specimens of 5 ft.&nbsp;in length are not rare. Formerly common in the eastern parts&nbsp;of the United States, and still so in thinly inhabited districts,&nbsp;rattlesnakes, like the vipers of Europe, have gradually succumbed&nbsp;to the persecution of man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rattlesnakes are confined to the New World. North-American authors distinguish a great number of different kinds, S. W. Garman&nbsp;(“ Reptiles and Batrachians of North America,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harvard Mus.&nbsp;Zool. Mem.,</span><span class="font1"> 1883, 4to) enumerating twelve species and thirteen&nbsp;additional varieties. E. D. Cope has split them into twenty; but&nbsp;all these species or varieties fall into two groups. One, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sistrurus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">has the upper side of the head covered with the ordinary nine shields;&nbsp;only three species, of comparatively small size, in North America&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sistrurus miliarius</span><span class="font1"> from Florida to Sonora; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">S.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">catenatus</span><span class="font1"> in many&nbsp;of the middle states of the Union, and elsewhere, as far north as&nbsp;Michigan; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">S.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ravus</span><span class="font1"> in Mexico).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second group forms the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crοtalus,</span><span class="font1"> in which the shields between and behind the eyes are broken up and replaced by small&nbsp;scales. This genus ranges throughout the United States through&nbsp;Central and South America into Patagonia, but is not represented&nbsp;on any of the West Indian islands. C. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">horridus,</span><span class="font1"> with the tail uniformly black, from Maine to Kansas and Louisiana to Florida.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. adamanteus,</span><span class="font1"> tail light, with black crossbands, body with a handsome pattern of rhombs with lighter centres and yellowish edges;&nbsp;chiefly south-eastern states, to Arizona and Mexico; the largest&nbsp;of rattlers, giants of 8 ft. in length having been recorded. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. confluentus,</span><span class="font1"> tail with brown or indistinct bands; with a continuous&nbsp;series of large brown or reddish rhomboidal spots on the back;&nbsp;Texas to California. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. cerastes,</span><span class="font1"> with a pair of horns above the&nbsp;eyes; the “sidewinder” of Arizona and California to Nevada.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">C. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">terrificus,</span><span class="font1"> easily distinguished by the possession of three pairs&nbsp;of symmetrical shields on the top of the muzzle, ranging from Arizona&nbsp;into Argentina. It is the only kind of rattlesnake in Central and&nbsp;South America. C. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">triseriatus,</span><span class="font1"> a small species, with a feebly&nbsp;developed rattle, on Mexican mountains, on the pic of Orizaba&nbsp;up to 12,500 ft.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(St G.

<p><span class="font2">RAU, KARL HEINRICH (1792-1870), German political economist, was born at Erlangen on the 29th of November 1792.&nbsp;He studied from 1808 to 1812 at the university there, where he&nbsp;afterwards remained as a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Privatdozent.</span><span class="font2"> In 1814 he obtained&nbsp;the prize offered by the academy of Göttingen for the best&nbsp;treatment of the question how the disadvantages arising from&nbsp;the abolition of trade gilds might be removed. His memoir,&nbsp;greatly enlarged, was published in 1816 under the title </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Über das&nbsp;Zunftwesen und die Folgen seiner Aufhebung.</span><span class="font2"> In the same&nbsp;year appeared his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Primae lineae historiae politices.</span><span class="font2"> In 1818 he&nbsp;became professor at Erlangen. In 1822 he was called to the&nbsp;chair of political economy at Heidelberg where the rest of his&nbsp;life was spent, in the main, in teaching and research. He took&nbsp;some part, however, in public affairs: in 1837 he was nominated&nbsp;a member of the first chamber of the duchy of Baden, and in&nbsp;1851 he was one of the commissioners sent to England on the&nbsp;part of the Zollverein to study the Industrial Exhibition. A&nbsp;result of this mission was his account of the agricultural imple-ments exhibited at London (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die landwirthschaftlichen Geräthe&nbsp;der Londoner Ausstellung,</span><span class="font2"> 1853). He was elected a corresponding member of the French Institute in 1856. He died at&nbsp;Heidelberg on the 18th of March 1870.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His principal work is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lehrbuch der politischen Ökonomie </span><span class="font2">(1826-37), an encyclopaedia of the economic knowledge of his&nbsp;time, written with a special view to the guidance of prac-tical men. The three volumes are respectively occupied with&nbsp;(1) political economy, properly so called, or the theory of&nbsp;wealth, (2) administrative science (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Volkswirthschaftspolitik)</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;(3) finance. The two last he recognizes as admitting of variations in accordance with the special circumstances of different&nbsp;countries, whilst the first is more akin to the exact sciences, and&nbsp;is in many respects capable of being treated, or at least illustrated,,&nbsp;mathematically. This threefold division marks his close&nbsp;relation to the older German cameralistic writers, with whose&nbsp;works he was familiarly acquainted. It is a consequence in&nbsp;part of his conformity to their method and his attention to administrative applications that his treatise was found peculiarly&nbsp;adapted for the use of the official class, and long maintained its&nbsp;position as their special text-book. He was the economic&nbsp;teacher, says Roscher, of the well-governed middle states of&nbsp;Germany from 1815 to 1848. The book has passed through&nbsp;many editions; in that of 1870 by Adolf Wagner it was transformed into a new book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the earlier part of his scientific life Rau tended strongly towards the relative point of view and an historical method in&nbsp;economics, but he never actually joined the historical school.&nbsp;To the end he occupied a somewhat indeterminate position with&nbsp;respect to that school; on the whole, however, he more and more&nbsp;subordinated historical investigation to immediate practical&nbsp;interests, and in his economic politics moved in the direction of&nbsp;limiting rather than extending the sphere of state action. His&nbsp;genera] merits are thoroughness of treatment, accuracy of state-ment, and balance of judgment; he shows much industry in the</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
