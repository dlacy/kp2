<p><span class="font2">lord president of the council in Scotland. He was lord treasurer of Scotland from 1663 till 1667, when he was made lord chancellor of Scotland for life. His estates having been sequestrated&nbsp;by the parliament in 1651, he received a* re-grant in 1663 of&nbsp;the earldom of Rothes, together with the title of Lord Leslie&nbsp;and Ballinbreich, with remainders to his heirs male and female,&nbsp;providing that in every case where a female should succeed&nbsp;to the peerage the name of Leslie should be assumed by her&nbsp;husband. In 1680 the earl was advanced to the dignity of&nbsp;duke of Rothes and marquess of Ballinbreich, but these titles&nbsp;became extinct at his death without a son in the following&nbsp;year. The earldom of Rothes and the other older titles now&nbsp;passed, under the special remainder mentioned above, to his&nbsp;daughter Margaret, whose husband, Charles Hamilton, 5th&nbsp;earl of Haddington, accordingly took the name of Leslie, at&nbsp;the same time making an arrangement by which his own&nbsp;peerage should pass to a younger son in order to keep the&nbsp;two earldoms separate. Margaret’s son John, who on her&nbsp;death became pth earl of Rothes, was vice-admiral of Scotland&nbsp;from 1713 to 1722, and fought with distinction against the&nbsp;Jacobite rebels in 1715; and her grandson, the 10th earl,&nbsp;who sold the estates of Ballinbreich to the Dundas family,&nbsp;was commander-in-chief in Ireland in 1754, and became a&nbsp;general in 1763. The office of sheriff of Fife, which had been&nbsp;an hereditary right of the earls of Rothes since 1540, was sold&nbsp;by the 10th earl under the Heritable Act of 1747. On several&nbsp;subsequent occasions the earldom again passed through the&nbsp;female line, and in 1893 Mary Elizabeth, countess of Rothes&nbsp;in her own right, was succeeded by her grandson, Norman&nbsp;Evelyn Leslie (b. 1877), as 19th earl of Rothes.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROTHESAY, a royal, municipal and police burgh, and the chief town of the county and island of Bute, Scotland. Pop.&nbsp;(1901) 9378. It is situated on a beautiful bay, 40 m. S.W.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">Glasgow, with which there is regular communication by&nbsp;railway steamers from Wemyss Bay, Gourock, Greenock&nbsp;(Prince’s Pier) and Craigendoran, as well as by many other&nbsp;steamers from Glasgow and the Clyde ports. It is a popular&nbsp;watering-place, and as the bay is sheltered by low wooded&nbsp;hills and affords excellent anchorage, it is well patronized by&nbsp;yachts. Loch Striven, on the opposite shore of Argyllshire,&nbsp;is known as the “ Rothesay weather-glass,” its appearance&nbsp;furnishing a certain clue to meteorological conditions. The&nbsp;town is under the jurisdiction of a provost and council. Rothesay has ceased to be a manufacturing centre, fishing being now&nbsp;its chief industry. Owing to its mild and equable climate&nbsp;it is a resort of invalids. There is a tramway to Port Banna-tyne, pleasantly situated on the east horn of Karnes Bay,&nbsp;and Craigmore, about 1 m. west of Rothesay, is a fashionable&nbsp;suburb. Ardbeg Point, Loch Fad, Loch Ascog and Barone&nbsp;Hill (530 ft.) are all within a mile and a half of the town, and&nbsp;there are numerous excursions by road to other points of&nbsp;interest. The Kyles of Bute are within a short sail of Rothesay.&nbsp;In the centre of the town are the ruins of a castle erected in&nbsp;1098 either by Magnus Barefoot, king of Norway, or by the&nbsp;Scots as a defence against the Norwegians, with whom during&nbsp;the 13th century, and earlier, there was constant strife. The&nbsp;village which grew up round the castle was made a royal burgh&nbsp;by Robert III., who, in 1398, created his eldest son David&nbsp;duke of Rothesay, a title which became the highest Scottish&nbsp;title of the heir-apparent to the crown of the United Kingdom.&nbsp;During the Commonwealth the castle was garrisoned by Cromwell’s troops. It was burned by the followers of Argyll in&nbsp;1685, and remained neglected till the rubbish was cleared&nbsp;away by the second marquess of Bute in 1816. It was repaired&nbsp;by the third marquess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROTHSCHILD, the name of a Jewish family which has acquired an unexampled position from the magnitude of its&nbsp;financial transactions. The original name was Bauer, the&nbsp;founder of the house being </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mayer Anselm</span><span class="font2"> (1743-1812), the son&nbsp;of Anselm Moses Bauer, a small Jewish merchant of Frankfort-on-the-Main. His father wished him to become a rabbi, but he&nbsp;set up as a money-lender at the sign of the “ Red Shield ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Rothschild)</span><span class="font2"> in the Frankfort Judengasse. He had already&nbsp;acquired some standing as a banker when his numismatic tastes&nbsp;obtained for him the friendship of William, ninth landgrave and&nbsp;afterwards elector of Hesse-Cassel, who in 1801 made him his&nbsp;agent. In the following year Rothschild negotiated his first&nbsp;great government Ioan, ten million thalers for the Danish&nbsp;government. When the landgrave was compelled to flee from&nbsp;his capital on the entry of the French, he placed his silver and&nbsp;other bulky treasures in the hands of Rothschild, who, not&nbsp;without considerable risk, took charge of them and buried&nbsp;them, it is said, in a comer of his garden, whence he dug them&nbsp;up as opportunity arose for disposing of them. This he did&nbsp;to such advantage as to be able afterwards to return their&nbsp;value to the elector at 5% interest. He died at Frankfort on the&nbsp;19th of September 1812, leaving ten children, five sons and five&nbsp;daughters. Branches of the business were established at Vienna,&nbsp;London, Paris and Naples, each being in charge of one of the&nbsp;sons, the chief of the firm always residing at Frankfort. By a&nbsp;system of co-operation and joint counsels, aided by the skilful&nbsp;employment of subordinate agents, they obtained unexampled&nbsp;opportunities of acquiring an accurate knowledge of the condition&nbsp;of the financial market, and practically embraced the whole&nbsp;of Europe within their financial network. The unity of the&nbsp;interests of the several members of the firm has been preserved&nbsp;by the system of intermarriages which has been the general&nbsp;practice of the descendants of the five brothers. Each </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the&nbsp;brothers received in 1815 from Austria the privilege of hereditary&nbsp;landowners, and in 1822 they were created barons by the same&nbsp;country. The charge of the Frankfort house devolved on the&nbsp;eldest, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anselm Mayer</span><span class="font2"> (1773-1855), bom on the 12th of June&nbsp;1773, who was chosen a member of the royal Prussian privy&nbsp;council of commerce, and, in 1820, Bavarian consul and court&nbsp;banker. The Vienna branch was undertaken by </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Solomon</span><span class="font2"> (1774-1826), bom on the 9th of December 1774, who entered into intimate relations with Prince Metternich, which contributed in no&nbsp;small degree to bring about the connexion of the firm with the&nbsp;allied powers. The third brother, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Nathan Mayer</span><span class="font2"> (1777-1836),&nbsp;bom on the 16th of September 1777, has, however, generally&nbsp;been regarded as the financial genius of the family, and the chief&nbsp;originator of the transactions which have created for the house&nbsp;its unexampled position in the financial world. He went to&nbsp;Manchester about 1800 to act as a purchaser for his father of&nbsp;manufactured goods; but at the end of five years he removed to&nbsp;London. The boldness and skill of his financial transactions,&nbsp;which caused him at first to be regarded as unsafe by the leading banking firms and financial merchants, later awakened their&nbsp;admiration and envy. By the employment of carrier-pigeons&nbsp;and of fast-sailing boats of his own for the transmission of news&nbsp;he was able to utilize to the best advantage his special sources of&nbsp;information, while no one was a greater adept in the art of promoting the rise and fall of the stocks. The colossal influence of&nbsp;the house dates from an operation of his in 1810. In that year&nbsp;Wellington made some drafts which the English government&nbsp;could not meet; these were purchased by Rothschild at a liberal&nbsp;discount, and renewed to the government, which finally redeemed&nbsp;at par. From this time the allied powers negotiated Ioans to&nbsp;carry on the war against Napoleon chiefly through the house&nbsp;of Rothschild. Rothschild never lost faith in the ultimate overthrow of Napoleon, his all being virtually staked on the issue of&nbsp;the contest. He is said to have been present at the battle of&nbsp;Waterloo. Being able to transmit to London private information of the allied success several hours before it reached the&nbsp;public, he effected an immense profit by the purchase of stock,&nbsp;which had been depressed on the news of Blucher’s defeat two&nbsp;days previously. Rothschild was the first to popularize foreign&nbsp;loans in Britain by fixing the rate in sterling money and making&nbsp;the dividends payable in London and not in foreign capitals.&nbsp;Latterly he became the financial agent of nearly every civilized&nbsp;government, although persistently declining contracts for&nbsp;Spain or the American States. He did not confine himself to</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
