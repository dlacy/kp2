<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">then the </span><span class="font4">ordinary theory will furniſh </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">maxims </span><span class="font4">of con· ftruction which will be very ſerviceable. This will be&nbsp;attempted in its proper place ; and we ſhall endeavour,&nbsp;in our treatment of all the practical queſtions, to derive&nbsp;uſeful information from all that has been delivered on&nbsp;the preſent occaſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">RESOLUTION √Ιdeδs. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Logic,</span><span class="font4"> Parti, ch. 3,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolution, in muſic. To </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">reſolve</span><span class="font4"> a diſcord or diſ-ſonauce, fays Rouffeau, is to carry it according to rule into a conſonance in the ſubſequent chord. There is&nbsp;for that purpofe a procedure preſcribed, both for the&nbsp;fundamental baſs of the diffonant chord, and for the&nbsp;part by which the diffonance is formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">There is no poſſible manner of reſolving a diffo-nance which is not derived from an operation of cadence: it is then by the kind of cadence which we wiſh to&nbsp;form, that the motion of the fundamental baſs is de-termined, (ſee Cadence), with reſpect to the part&nbsp;by which the diſibnance is formed, it ought neither to&nbsp;continue in its place, nor to move by disjointed gra-dations ; but to riſe or deſcend diatonically, accord-ing to the nature of the diffonance. Theoriſts ſay,&nbsp;that major diffonances ought to riſe, and minor to de-ſcend ; which is not however without exception, ſince&nbsp;in particular chords of harmony, a ſeventh, although&nbsp;major, ought not to riſe, but to deſcend, unleſs in&nbsp;that chord which is, very incorrectly, called </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">the chord&nbsp;of the ſeventh redundant.</span><span class="font4"> It is better then to ſay, that&nbsp;the ſeventh and all its derivative diffonanees ought to&nbsp;deſcend ; and that the ſixth ſnperadded, and all its de-rivative diffonances, ſhould riſe. This is a rule truly&nbsp;general, and without any exception. It is the ſame&nbsp;cafe with the rule of reſolving diffonances. There are&nbsp;ſome diffonances which cannot be prepared ; but there&nbsp;is by no means one which ought not to be reſolved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">with reſpect to the ſenſible note, improperly called a </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">major diſfonance,</span><span class="font4"> if it ought to aſcend, this is leſs on&nbsp;account of the rule for reſolving diffonanees, than on&nbsp;account of that which preſcribes a diatonic procedure,&nbsp;and prefers the ſhorteſt road ; and in reality, there are&nbsp;caſes, as that of the interrupted cadence, in which this&nbsp;fenſible note does not aſcend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In chords by ſuppoſition, one ſingle chord often produces two diffonances ; as the ſeventh and ninth, the&nbsp;ninth and fourth, &amp;c.· Then theſe two diffonances&nbsp;ought to have been prepared, and both muff iikewiſe&nbsp;be reſolved ; it is becauſe regard ſhould be paid to&nbsp;every thing which is diſcordant, not only in the fun-damental, but even in the continued baſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolution, in chemiſtry, the reduction of a mixed body into its component parts or ſirſt principles, as far as can be done by a proper analyſis.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font4" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Resolution,</span><span class="font2"> in medicine, the diſappearſhg of any tumor without coming to fuppuration or forming an&nbsp;abſceſs.</span></h3>
