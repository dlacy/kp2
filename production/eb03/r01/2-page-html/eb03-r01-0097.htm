<p><span class="font2">mnndhig his freight in a furly tone, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">an uxorious </span><span class="font2">monarch, are objects too familiar and ludicrous not </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">degrade the dignity of thoſe awful ſcenes which are&nbsp;repreſented as the manſions of the dead, and to prevent&nbsp;them from making a deep enough impreffion on the&nbsp;imagination. The actions and qualities, too, for which&nbsp;departed fpirits were admitted into Elyſium, or doomed to the regions of fijſſering, were not always of ſuch&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">nature as under a well-regulated government on earth&nbsp;would have been thought to merit reward, or to be&nbsp;worthy of puniſhment. It was not always virtue or&nbsp;wiſdom which conducted to the Elyſian fields, or gained admiſſion into the fociety of the immortal gods.—&nbsp;Ganimede was for a very different reaſon promoted to&nbsp;be the cup-bearer oſ Jove ; and Hercules and Bacchus&nbsp;could not finely plead that any merits of that kind entitled them to feats in the council, and at the banquets&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the immortals. That doctrine, likewife, which repreſented mortals ns hurried by fate to the commiſſion&nbsp;of crimes, which they could no more abſtain from committing than the ſword can avoid to obey the impulſe&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">a powerful and furious arm plunging it into the&nbsp;breaſt of an unreſiſting antagυnift, could not but produce effects unfavourable to virtue ; and it afforded a&nbsp;ready excuſe for the moſt extravagant crimes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ύ </span><span class="font2">ct, after all, he who attentively conſiders the ideas of the Greeks and Romans concerning the moral&nbsp;government of the world and a future ſtate of rewards&nbsp;and puniſhments, will probably acknowledge, that their&nbsp;general influence muſt have been favourable to virtue and&nbsp;moral order. Allow them to have been incorrect and&nbsp;daſhed with abſurdity ; ſtill they repreſent puniſhments&nbsp;prepared for ſuch qualities and actions as were injurious&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font2">the welfare </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">ſociety ; whilſt, for thoſe qualities which&nbsp;rendered men eminently ufefùl in the world, they hold&nbsp;forth a reward. Though incorrect, their ideas concerning a future ſtate were exceedingly diſtinct ; they&nbsp;were not vague or general, but ſuch as might be readi-Iy conceived by the imagination, in all their circumftances, as really exiſting. when a man is told that&nbsp;for ſuch a deed he will be put to death, he may ſhud--&lt;ier and be alarmed, and think of the deed as what he&nbsp;jrtuſt by no means commit ; but place before him the&nbsp;ſcene and the apparatus for his execution, call him to&nbsp;behold ſome other criminal mounting the ſcaffold, ad-βheffing his laſt words in a wild ſcream of defpair to&nbsp;the ſurrounding ſpectators, and then launching into&nbsp;eternity—his horror of the crime, and his dread of the&nbsp;puniſhment, will now be much more powerfully excited.&nbsp;In the ſame manner, to encourage the ſoldier marching&nbsp;cut </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">te </span><span class="font2">battle, or the mariner fetting ſail under the proſpect of a ſtorm, promiſ¢ not, merely in general terms,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">liberal reward ; be ſure to ſpecify the nature of the&nbsp;reward which you mean to beſtow; deſcribe it ſo as that&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font2">may take hold on the imagination, and may riſe in&nbsp;oppoſition to the images of death and danger with&nbsp;which his courage is to be aſſailed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If thefe phenomena of die human mind are fairly ftated, if it be true that general ideas produce no very&nbsp;powerful effects oa the fentimentβ and diſpoſitions of&nbsp;the human heart, it muſt then be granted, that though&nbsp;the ſcenes of future reward and puniſhment, which the&nbsp;heathens conſidered as prepared for the righteous and&nbsp;the wicked, were of a ſomewhat motley complexion ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">yet ſtill, as they were </span><span class="font2">diſtinct </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and even </span><span class="font2">minute draughts,</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font0">they muſt </span><span class="font3">have been </span><span class="font0">favbtιrable to virtue, and contribu-ted in no inconfiderable degree to the fupport of civil order.</span></h3>
<p><span class="font2">Another thing </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">which we may take notice under this head, is the vaſt multiplicity of deities with which&nbsp;the Greek and Roman mythology peopled all the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">regions</span><span class="font2"> of nature. Flocks and fields, and woods and&nbsp;oaks, and flowers, and many much more minute objects,&nbsp;had all their guardian deities. Tlieſe were ſomewhat&nbsp;capricious at times, it is true, and expected to have attention paid them. But yet the faithful ſhepherd, and&nbsp;the induſtrious farmer, knew generally how to acquire&nbsp;their friendſhip ; and in the idea of deities enjoying the&nbsp;ſame ſimple pleaſures, partaking in the ſame labours,&nbsp;protecting their poſſeſſions, and bringing forward the&nbsp;fruits of the year, there could not but be fomething of&nbsp;a very pleating nature, highly favourable to induſtry,&nbsp;which would animate the labours, and cheer the feſtivals, of the good people who entertained ſuch a notion ;&nbsp;nay, would diſſuſe a new charm over all the fcene6 of&nbsp;the country, even in the gayeſt months of the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From all of theſe particular obfervations, we think ourſelves warranted to conclude, that notwithſtanding&nbsp;the mixed characters of the deities who were adored by&nbsp;the celebrated nations of antiquity ; though they are in&nbsp;many inſtances repreſented as conſpicuous for vices and&nbsp;frolics ; however vain, abfurd, and morally criminal, ſome&nbsp;of the rites by which they were worſhipped may have&nbsp;been, and however incorrect the notions of the heathens&nbsp;concerning the moral government of the univerſe and&nbsp;a future ſtate of retribution ; yet ſtill, after making </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">juſt allowance for all theſe imperfections, the general influence of their religious ſyſtem was rather favourable&nbsp;thaπ unfavourable to virtue and to the order and happineſs of fociety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was not without good reaſon that the earlieſt legiſlators generally endeavoured to eſtabliſh their laws and conſtitutions on the baſis of religion ; government needs&nbsp;the ſupport of opinion ; the governed muſt be im-preſſed with a belief that the particular eſtabliſhment&nbsp;to whieh they are required to ſubmit, is tbe beſt calculated for their ſecurity and happineſs, or is ſupported&nbsp;on ſome ſuch ſolid foundation, that it muſt prove,im-poſſible for them to overturn it, or is connected with&nbsp;ſome awful ſanction, which it would hc the moſt heinous impiety to oppoſe. Οί thefe feveral notions, the&nbsp;laſt will ever operate on moſt men with the moſt ſteady&nbsp;influence. AVe are frequently blind to our own intereſt ;&nbsp;even when eager for the attainment of happineſs, we often&nbsp;refuſc to take the wiſeſt meaſures for that end. The&nbsp;great bulk of the people in every community are ſo little capable of reafoning and foreſight, that the public&nbsp;miniſter who ſhall moſt ſteadily direct his views to the&nbsp;public good will often be the moſt unpopular. Thoſe&nbsp;laws, and that ſyſtem of government, which arc the&nbsp;moſt beneficial, will often excite the ſtrongeſt popular&nbsp;diſcontents. Again, it is not always eaſy to perſuade&nbsp;people that your power is ſuperior to theirs, when it is&nbsp;not really fo. No one man will ever be able to perſuade&nbsp;a thouſand that he is ſtronger than they all together ;&nbsp;and therefore, in order to perſuade one part of his fub-jects or army that it is abſolutely neceſſary for them to&nbsp;ſubmit to him, becauſe any attempts to reſiſt his power</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">would prove ineffectual, a monarch or general muſt take </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">care ſirſt to perſuade another part that it is ſor their in-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
