<p><span class="font0">ROXBURY, formerly a city of Norfolk county, Massachusetts, U.S.A., situated between Boston and Dorchester, but since 1868 a part of Boston. It is primarily a residential&nbsp;district. Among its institutions are the Roxbury Latin School,&nbsp;established in 1645,@@<sup>1</sup> the Fellowes Athenaeum (a part of the&nbsp;Roxbury branch of the Boston Public Library), -with about&nbsp;26,000 volumes in 1909, and the New England Hospital for&nbsp;Women and Children (1863), the New England Baptist Hospital&nbsp;(1893), the Woman’s Charity Club Hospital (1890), the Roxbury&nbsp;Homoeopathic Dispensary (1886), the Roxbury Home for&nbsp;Children and Aged Women (1856), a Home for Aged Couples&nbsp;(1884) and the Massachusetts Home,for Intemperate Women&nbsp;(1879). On Mount Bellevue, in West Roxbury (set apart from&nbsp;Roxbury in 1851 and annexed to Boston in 1873), there is an&nbsp;observatory (erected in 1869 by the city of Boston as a standpipe for the high service water supply). Among the manufactures of the district are cotton and woollen goods, cordage,&nbsp;carpets, shoes and foundry products. The town of Roxbury&nbsp;(at first usually spelled Rocksbury) was founded in 1630 by&nbsp;some of the Puritan immigrants who came with Governor John&nbsp;Winthrop; the settlers were led by William Pynchon, who in&nbsp;1636 led a party from here and founded Springfield, Mass. At&nbsp;the home of Rev Thomas Welde (d. 1662), the first minister,&nbsp;Anne Hutchinson </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> was held in custody during the winter&nbsp;of 1637-38. Associated as teacher with Welde and his successors, Samuel Danforth and Nehemiah Walter, was John&nbsp;Eliot, the apostle to the Indians, who removed to Roxbury in&nbsp;1632 and died here in 1690. Roxbury was the home also&nbsp;of Thomas Dudley, of his son Joseph and of his grandson Paul;&nbsp;of Robert Calef (d. 1719), the leader of the opposition to the&nbsp;witchcraft craze; of General Joseph Warren, and of William&nbsp;Eustis (1753-1825), who was U.S. secretary of war (1809-12), minister to the Netherlands (1814-18), and governor of&nbsp;Massachusetts (1823-25); and from 1837 to 1845 Theodore&nbsp;Parker was the pastor of the Unitarian Church of West Roxbury.&nbsp;Of special interest in the old Roxbury burial-ground is the&nbsp;“ Ministers’ Tomb,” containing the remains of John Eliot, and&nbsp;the tomb of the Dudleys. West Roxbury was the scene of&nbsp;the Brook Farm experiment (see Brook Farm). Roxbury was</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROY, WILLIAM (1726-1790), a famous British surveyor, military draughtsman, antiquary, &amp;c. In 1746, when an&nbsp;assistant in the office of Colonel Watson, deputy quartermaster-general in North Britain, he began the survey of the mainland&nbsp;of Scotland, the results of which were embodied in what is&nbsp;known as the “duke of Cumberland’s map.” In 1755 he&nbsp;obtained his commission in the 4th King’s Own Foot, and in&nbsp;1759 gained his lieutenancy and went to serve in Germany in&nbsp;the Seven Years’ War. In 1765 he appears as deputy quartermaster-general to the forces, surveyor-general of coasts and&nbsp;engineer-director of military surveys in Great Britain; in 1767&nbsp;he became F.R.S., in 1781 major-general, in 1783 director of&nbsp;Royal Engineers. Besides his Campaigns and observations in&nbsp;Germany, his visits to Ireland (1766) and to Gibraltar (1768)&nbsp;were important. In 1783-84 he conducted observations for&nbsp;determining the relative positions of the French and English&nbsp;royal observatories. His measurement of a base-line for that&nbsp;purpose on Hounslow Heath in 1784, the germ of all subsequent surveys of the United Kingdom, gained him in 1785 the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> This school was founded, primarily through the influence of the Rev. John Eliot, by inhabitants of Roxbury. In 1672 Thomas Bell,&nbsp;one of the original founders, bequeathed to the school all his Roxbury&nbsp;lands. In 1789 the school was incorporated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Copley medal of the Royal Society. Roy’s measurements (not fully utilized till 1787, when the Paris and Greenwich&nbsp;observatories were properly connected) form the basis of the&nbsp;topographical survey of Middlesex, Surrey, Kent and Sussex.&nbsp;He was finishing an account of this work for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phil. Trans.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">when he died on the 1st of July 1790.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roy’s principal book-publication is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain</span><span class="font0"> (1793).

<p><span class="font0">ROYAL FERN, in botany, the common name for the fern </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Osmunda regalis,</span><span class="font0"> a native of Britain, where it grows in bogs,&nbsp;marshy woods, &amp;c. It is a handsome plant with bi-pinnate&nbsp;fronds 2 to 6 ft. long and 1 ft. or more broad; the tops of the&nbsp;fronds are fertile, the fertile pinnae being cylindrical and&nbsp;densely covered with the spore-cases, giving the appearance of a&nbsp;dense panicle of flowers, whence the plant is known as the&nbsp;flowering fern. There are various cultivated forms—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cristata&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">has the ends of the fronds and the pinnae finely crested, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">corymbifera</span><span class="font0"> has curiously forked and crested fronds. Several&nbsp;other species, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">0. cinnamomea, O. Claytoniana,</span><span class="font0"> are&nbsp;known as handsome greenhouse ferns (see also Ferns).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROYAL SOCIETY, THE, thé oldest scientific society in Great Britain, and one of the oldest in Europe. The Royal Society&nbsp;(more fully, The Royal Society of London for Improving&nbsp;Natural Knowledge) is usually considered to have been founded&nbsp;in the year 1660, but a nucleus had in fact been in existence for&nbsp;some years before that date. As early as the year 1645 weekly&nbsp;meetings were held in London of “ divers worthy persons,&nbsp;inquisitive into natural philosophy and other parts of human&nbsp;learning, and particularly of what hath been called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New&nbsp;Philosophy</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Experimental Philosophy/’</span><span class="font0"> and there can be little&nbsp;doubt that this gathering of philosophers is identical with the&nbsp;“ Invisible College ” of which Boyle speaks in sundry letters&nbsp;written in 1646 and 1647. These weekly meetings, according&nbsp;to Wallis, were first suggested by Theodore Haak, “ a German&nbsp;of the Palatinate then resident in London,” and they were held&nbsp;sometimes in Dr Goddard’s lodgings in Wood Street, sometimes&nbsp;at the Bull-Head Tavern in Cheapside.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some of these “ Philosophers,” resident in Oxford about 1648, formed an association there under the title of the Philosophical&nbsp;Society of Oxford, and used to meet, most usually in the roonis&nbsp;of Dr Wilkins, warden of Wadham College. A close intercommunication was maintained between the Oxford and&nbsp;London Philosophers; but ultimately the activity of the&nbsp;society was concentrated in the London meetings, which were&nbsp;held principally at Gresham College.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On November 28, 1660, the first journal book of the society was opened with a “ memorandum,” from which the following&nbsp;is an extract: “ Memorandum that Novemb. 28.1660, These persons following, according to the usuall custom of most of them,&nbsp;mett together at Gresham Colledge to heare Mr Wren’s lecture,&nbsp;viz. The Lord Brouncker, Mr Boyle, Mr Bruce, Sir Robert&nbsp;Moray, Sir Paul Neile, Dr Wilkins, Dr Goddard, Dr Petty,&nbsp;Mr Ball, Mr Rooke, Mr Wren, Mr Hill. And after the lecture&nbsp;was ended, they did, according to the usuall manner, withdrawe&nbsp;for mutuall converse. Where amongst other matters that were&nbsp;discoursed of, something was offered about a désigné of founding&nbsp;a Colledge for the promoting of Physico-Mathematicall Experimental! Learning.” It was agreed at this meeting that the&nbsp;company should continue to assemble on Wednesdays at three&nbsp;o’clock; an admission fee of ten shillings with a subscription of&nbsp;one shilling a week was instituted; Dr Wilkins was appointed&nbsp;chairman; and a list of forty-one persons judged likely and fit&nbsp;to join the design was drawn up. On the following Wednesday&nbsp;Sir Robert Moray brought word that the king (Charles II.)&nbsp;approved the design of the meetings; a form of obligation was&nbsp;framed, and was signed by all the persons enumerated in the&nbsp;memorandum of the 28th of November and by seventy-three&nbsp;others. On the 12th of December another meeting was held at</span></p>
