                appropriated Italy and the West ; while Lepidus&nbsp;was forced to content himself
                with Africa.@@<sup>1</sup> For the next&nbsp;twelve years, while Antony was
                indulging in dreams of&nbsp;founding for himself and Cleopatra an empire in the
                East,&nbsp;and shocking Roman feeling by his wild excesses and&nbsp;his affectation
                of oriental magnificence,@@<sup>2</sup> Octavian was&nbsp;patiently consolidating
                his power. Of his only two rivals,&nbsp;Lepidus his fellow triumvir was in 36
                ejected from Africa&nbsp;and banished to Circeii, while Sextus Pompeius, who
                had&nbsp;since his defeat at Munda maintained a semi-piratical&nbsp;ascendency in
                the western Mediterranean, was decisively&nbsp;defeated in the same year, and his
                death in 35 left&nbsp;Octavian sole master of the West. The inevitable trial
                of&nbsp;strength between himself and Antony was not long&nbsp;delayed. In 32 Antony
                inflicted one more outrage upon&nbsp;Roman feeling, and openly challenged the
                hostility of&nbsp;Octavian by divorcing Octavia in favour of the beautiful&nbsp;and
                daring Egyptian princess, with whom, as the heiress&nbsp;of the Ptolemies, he
                aspired to share the empire of the&nbsp;Eastern world. By a decree of the senate
                Antony was&nbsp;declared deposed from his command, and war was declared&nbsp;against
                Queen Cleopatra.@@<sup>3</sup> On September 2, 31, was&nbsp;fought the battle of
                    Actium.@@<sup>4</sup> Octavian’s victory was&nbsp;complete. Antony and Cleopatra
                committed suicide (30),&nbsp;and the Eastern provinces submitted in 29.
                Octavian&nbsp;returned to Rome to celebrate his triumph and mark the&nbsp;end of the
                long-continued anarchy by closing the temple&nbsp;of Janus;@@<sup>5</sup> at the end
                of the next year he formally laid&nbsp;down the extraordinary powers he had held
                siuce 43, and&nbsp;a regular government was established.</span></p>

                    anarchy,@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>to the task of establishing a government which
                should as&nbsp;far as possible respect the forms and traditions of
                the&nbsp;republic, without sacrificing that centralization of authority which
                experience had shown to be necessary for the&nbsp;integrity and stability of the
                empire. It was a task for&nbsp;which Octavian was admirably fitted. To great
                administrative capacity and a quiet tenacity of purpose he united&nbsp;deliberate
                caution and unfailing tact ; while his bourgeois&nbsp;birth@@<sup>7</sup> and
                genuinely Italian sympathies enabled him to&nbsp;win the confidence of the Roman
                community to an extent&nbsp;impossible for Cæsar, with his dazzling pre-eminence
                of&nbsp;patrician descent, his daring disregard of forms, and his&nbsp;cosmopolitan
                tastes.</span></p>

                the republic under the leadership of a “ princeps.”@@<sup>9</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Octavian voluntarily resigned the extraordinary powers which he had
                held since 43, and, to quote his own words,&nbsp;“handed over the republic to the
                control of the senate&nbsp;and people of Rome.@@<sup>10</sup> The old constitutional
                machinery&nbsp;was once more set in motion ; the senate, assembly,
                and&nbsp;magistrates resumed their functions@@<sup>11</sup> ; and Octavian himself
                was hailed as the “restorer of the commonwealth&nbsp;and the champion of
                    freedom.”@@<sup>12</sup> It was not so easy to&nbsp;determine what relation he
                himself, the actual master of&nbsp;the Roman world, should occupy towards this
                revived&nbsp;republic. His abdication, in any real sense of the word,&nbsp;would
                have simply thrown everything back into confusion.&nbsp;The interests of peace and
                order required that he should&nbsp;retain at least the substantial part of his
                    authority;@@<sup>13</sup> and&nbsp;this object was in fact accomplished, and the
                rule of the&nbsp;emperors founded, in a manner which has no parallel
                in&nbsp;history. Any revival of the kingly title was out of the&nbsp;question, and
                Octavian himself expressly refused the&nbsp;dictatorship.@@<sup>14</sup> Nor was any
                new office created or any new&nbsp;official title invented for his benefit. But by
                senate and&nbsp;people he was invested according to the old
                constitutional&nbsp;forms with certain powers, as many citizens had been&nbsp;before
                him, and so took his place among the lawfully&nbsp;appointed magistrates of the
                republic;—only, to mark his&nbsp;pre-eminent dignity, as the first of them all, the
                senate&nbsp;decreed that he should take as an additional cognomen&nbsp;that of
                    “Augustus,”@@<sup>15</sup> while in common parlance he was&nbsp;henceforth
                styled “princeps,” a simple title of courtesy,&nbsp;familiar to republican usage,
                and conveying no other idea&nbsp;than that of a recognized primacy and precedence
                over his&nbsp;fellow citizens.@@<sup>16</sup> The ideal sketched by Cicero in his
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;Republica,</span><span
                class="font1"> of a constitutional president of a free republic,&nbsp;was apparently
                realised ; but it was only in appearance.&nbsp;For in fact the special prerogatives
                conferred upon&nbsp;Octavian gave him back in substance the
                autocratic&nbsp;authority he had resigned, and as between the restored&nbsp;republic
                and its new princeps the balance of power was&nbsp;overwhelmingly on the side of the
                latter.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Under one form or another Octavian had held the “ imperium ” since
                43, and in 33 he had been formally&nbsp;acknowledged as “imperator,” by the consent
                of all.@@<sup>17</sup>&nbsp;For this somewhat irregular authority was substituted
                in&nbsp;27 the regular “ proconsular imperium,”@@<sup>18</sup> the
                authority&nbsp;under which for nearly two centuries the provinces had&nbsp;been
                governed and the legions led to war. He received&nbsp;it in the orthodox way, by
                decree of the senate ; and the&nbsp;decree, as was customary, defined the area of
                his command.&nbsp;The essential difference between the “ proconsular imperium ”
                granted to Octavian and that which had been&nbsp;voted year after year to the
                ordinary proconsuls, lay in its&nbsp;unprecedentedly wide extent and in its long
                duration.&nbsp;All the provinces, with the exception of those where no&nbsp;military
                authority or force was required, were placed under&nbsp;his command, to be governed
                directly by “ Iegati ” appointed&nbsp;by him and responsible only to
                    him.@@<sup>19</sup> The “ unarmed</span></p><div>
