<p><span class="font1">strengthened at intervals by counterforts. The thickness of the wall varies from 11 ft. 6 in. at the base to 3 ft. at the top, and is</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">surmounted by a dressed cornice and coping; the length is 340 yards. The work was constructed, </span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1">1888, at a cost of £10,000,&nbsp;or £29, 8s. per lineal yard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Walls with almost vertical faces, or slightly stepped, appear to be the best. Unless, however, the foreshore consists of hard&nbsp;rock, or a raised beach maintained by groynes, a wall of this&nbsp;kind should be protected by an apron, in order to prevent the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">destructive undermining to which such forms of wall are necessarily liable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Where the coast is fringed with sand dunes, and the beach protected from erosion by a regular series of groynes, as at Ostend&nbsp;(Belgium), the sand dunes, or an embankment for a promenade&nbsp;in front of them, may be sufficiently protected by a simple slope,&nbsp;paved with brickwork or masonry, and having a maximum&nbsp;inclination of two to one. The paving requires to be laid on a&nbsp;bed of clay, rubble or concrete. Parts of the sea bank at Ostend</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">(see fig. 8) have been carried out beyond high-water mark to gain a strip of land for the esplanade; and these portions have</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">had to be protected from undermining at the toe with piles and planks, and an apron of concrete or pitching, laid on fascines,&nbsp;extending down the foreshore. For&nbsp;the parts above high-water mark a&nbsp;short paved slope, with moderate&nbsp;protection at the toe, has been found&nbsp;sufficient. The top face of these&nbsp;slopes is reflexed so as to protect the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">esplanade from surf during storms. Sea-walls are very costly and, while</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">temporarily resisting, do not diminish, but actually increase, the erosive action of the sea. In short, sea-walls&nbsp;are a most unsatisfactory type of&nbsp;protective work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The protection afforded to the coast by groynes is based on a totally different principle, which may be summarized as that of promoting natural&nbsp;accretion by the construction of artificial shelter. Along most coasts there is a littoral drift of sand&nbsp;or shingle; by means of groynes, projecting from the coast-line&nbsp;down the beach, this drift may be intercepted so as to produce&nbsp;accretion to the foreshore, where previously there has been&nbsp;constant erosion. The problem, however, of coast protection&nbsp;by this method presents difficulties. Littoral drift is the&nbsp;product of erosion, and the fate of a large portion of this drift&nbsp;is to be deposited in deep water. Any scheme, therefore, of&nbsp;stopping erosion altogether by means of groynes would be&nbsp;purely chimerical; in the same way, partial failure of groynes,&nbsp;from lack of drift and inability to stop wastage, must be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">expected</span><span class="font1"> in many localities. Another difficulty may be illustrated&nbsp;by the action of such natural projections as Dungeness; this&nbsp;point, by completely arresting the easterly drift of shingle,&nbsp;causes a rapid accretion to the beach on the one side, but a&nbsp;corresponding denudation on the other. The old type of high&nbsp;groyne, erected at Cromer and Hastings, has produced the&nbsp;same undesirable result; moreover, the general effect of groyning certain portions of the foreshore is to render the adjacent&nbsp;unprotected portions more liable to erosion. Nevertheless,&nbsp;the benefit which may be derived locally from suitable groyning is very great. The timber groynes erected between&nbsp;Lancing and Shoreham raised the shingle beach sufficiently&nbsp;to cause high-water mark to recede 85 ft. seawards in the course</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of a few years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The eroding action of the river Scheldt in front of Blanken-berghe has been arrested by carrying out groynes at right angles to the coast-line, and down to below low water (see </span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">figs. 9, 10). These, on the average, are about 820 ft. long and 680 ft. apart: they are made wide, with a curved top&nbsp;raised only slightly above the beach, so as to minimize the&nbsp;scour from currents and wave action, and facilitate the even</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
