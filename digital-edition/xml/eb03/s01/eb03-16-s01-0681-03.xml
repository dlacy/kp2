(Joſeph), an eminent French mathematician, born at La Fleche in 1653. He was abfolutely dumb until he was ſeven years of age; and even then his organs of ſpeech did not diſengage themſelves ſo freely, but that he was ever after obliged to ſpeak with great deliberation. Mathematics were the only ſtudies he had any reliſh for, and theſe he cultivated with extraordinary ſucceſs; ſo that he commenced teacher at 20 years of age, and was ſo ſoon in vogue, that he had prince Eugene for his ſcholar. He was made mathematical profeſſor in the royal college in 1686; and ten years after was admitted a member of the Academy of Sciences. He died in 1716; and his writings, which conſiſt rather of detached papers than of connected treatiſes, are all inſerted in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences. He was twice married; and by the laſt wife had a ſon, who, like himſelf, was dumb for the firſt ſeven years of his life.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
