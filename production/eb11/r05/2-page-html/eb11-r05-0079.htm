<p><span class="font0">the Tatar khan withdrew with the loss of his hravest followers, and, in the great victory of Man tin on the Danube (1595), the&nbsp;Turkish army was annihilated, and its leader, Mustafa, slain.&nbsp;The sultan now sent Sinan Pasha, “ the Renegade,” to invade&nbsp;Walachia with 100,000 men. Michael withdrew to the mountains&nbsp;before this overwhelming force, but, being joined by Bâthory&nbsp;with a Transylvanian contingent, the voivode resumed the offensive, stormed Bucharest, where Sinan had entrenched a Turkish&nbsp;detachment, and, pursuing the main body of his forces to the&nbsp;Danube, overtook the rearguard and cut it to pieces, capturing&nbsp;enormous booty. Sinan Pasha returned to Constantinople to&nbsp;die, it is said, of vexation; and in 1597, the sultan, weary of a&nbsp;disastrous contest, sent Michael a red flag in token of reconciliation, reinvested him for life in an office of which he had&nbsp;been unable to deprive him, and granted the succession to&nbsp;his son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1599, on the abdication of Sigismund Bâthory in Transylvania, Michael, in league with the imperialist forces, and in connivance with the Saxon burghers, attacked and&nbsp;defeated his successor Andreas Bâthory near Hermann-stadt, and, seizing himself the reins of government,&nbsp;secured his proclamation as prince of Transylvania. The&nbsp;emperor consented to appoint him his viceroy </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{locum tenens&nbsp;per Transylvaniam),</span><span class="font0"> and the sultan ratified his election. As&nbsp;prince of Transylvania he summoned diets in 1599 and 1600,&nbsp;and, having expelled the voivode of Moldavia, united under&nbsp;his sceptre three principalities. The partiality that he showed&nbsp;for the Ruman and Szekler parts of the population alienated,&nbsp;however, the Transylvanian Saxons, who preferred the direct&nbsp;government of the emperor. The imperial commissioner&nbsp;General Basta lent his support to the disaffected party, and&nbsp;Michael was driven out of Transylvania by a successful revolt,&nbsp;while a Polish army invaded Walachia from the Moldavian side.&nbsp;MichaePs coolness and resource, however, never deserted him.&nbsp;He resolved to appeal to the emperor, rode to Prague, won over&nbsp;Rudolph by his singular address, and, richly supplied with funds,&nbsp;reappeared in Transylvania as imperial governor. In conjunction with Basta he defeated the superior Transylvanian&nbsp;forces at Goroslo, expelling Sigismund Bâthory, who had&nbsp;again aspired to the crown, and taking one hundred and fifty&nbsp;flags and forty-five cannon. But at the moment of his returning&nbsp;prosperity Basta, who had quarrelled with him about the supreme&nbsp;command of the imperial forces, procured his murder on the&nbsp;19th of August 1601. Not only had Michael succeeded in&nbsp;rolling back for a time the tide of Turkish conquest, but for&nbsp;the first and last time in modern history he united what once&nbsp;had been Trajan's Dacia, in its widest extent, and with it the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">whole Ruman race north of the Danube, under a single sceptre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">MichaePs wife Florika and his son Nicholas were carried off into Tatar captivity, and §erban or Sherban, of the Bassaraba&nbsp;family, was raised to the voivodeship of Walachia by imperialist&nbsp;influences, while Sigismund resumed the government of Transylvania. On his deposition by the Porte in 1610, there followed a succession of princes who, though still for the most&nbsp;part of Ruman origin, bought their appointment at Stambul.&nbsp;Walachian contingents were continually employed by the Turks&nbsp;in their Polish wars, and the settlement of Greeks in an official&nbsp;or mercantile capacity in the principality provoked grave&nbsp;discontent, which on one occasion took the form of a massacre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The reign of the voivode Matthias Bassaraba (1633-54) was an interval of comparative prosperity. Matthias repulsed&nbsp;his powerful rival, Basil the Wolf, the voivode of&nbsp;Moldavia and his Tatar and Cossack allies. His last&nbsp;days were embittered, however, by an outbreak of&nbsp;military anarchy. His illegitimate son and successor, Constantine §erban (1654-58), was the last of the Bassaraba&nbsp;dynasty to rule over Walachia; and on his death the Turkish&nbsp;yoke again weighed heavier on his country. The old capital,&nbsp;Tirgovishtea, was considered by the Divan to be too near the&nbsp;Transylvanian frontier, and the voivodes were accordingly&nbsp;compelled to transfer their residence to Bucharest, which was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">finally made the seat of government in 1698.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mechanical skill of the Walachians was found useful by the Turks, who employed them as carpenters and pontonniers;&nbsp;and during the siege of Vienna in 1683 the Walachian&nbsp;contingent, which, under the voivode §erban Cantacu-zene, had been forced to co-operate with the Turks,&nbsp;was entrusted with the construction of the two bridges over the&nbsp;Danube above and below Vienna. The Walachian as well as&nbsp;the Moldavian prince, who had been also forced to bring his&nbsp;contingent, maintained a secret system of communication with&nbsp;the besieged, which was continued by §erban after his return&nbsp;to Walachia. The emperor granted him a diploma creating&nbsp;him count of the empire and recognizing his descent from the&nbsp;imperial house of Cantacuzene, §erban meanwhile collecting&nbsp;his forces for an open breach with the Porte. His prudence,&nbsp;however, perpetually postponed the occasion, and Walachia&nbsp;enjoyed peace to his death in 1688. This peaceful state of the&nbsp;country gave the voivode leisure to promote its internal culture,&nbsp;and in the year of his death he had the satisfaction of seeing&nbsp;the first part of a Walachian Bible issue from the first printing-press of the country, which he had established at Bucharest.&nbsp;He had also caused to be compiled a history of Walachia, and&nbsp;had called to the country many teachers of the Greek language,&nbsp;whose business it was to instruct the sons of the boiars in&nbsp;grammar, rhetoric and philosophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Immediately on §erban’s death the boiars, to prevent the Porte from handing over the office to the Greek adventurer who&nbsp;bid the highest, proceeded to elect his sister’s son&nbsp;Constantine Brancovan. The Turkish envoy then in&nbsp;Bucharest was persuaded to invest Brancovan with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">caftan,</span><span class="font0"> or robe of office, in token of Turkish approval,&nbsp;and the patriarch of Constantinople, who was also present,&nbsp;and the archbishop of Walachia, Theodosius, consecrated him&nbsp;together at the high altar of the cathedral, where he took the&nbsp;coronation oath to devote his whole strength to the good of his&nbsp;country and received the boiars’ oath of submission. Brancovan, it is true, found it expedient to devote his predecessor’s&nbsp;treasure to purchasing the confirmation of his title from the&nbsp;Divan, but the account of his coronation ceremony remains&nbsp;an interesting landmark in the constitutional history of the&nbsp;country. In his relations with the Habsburg power he displayed&nbsp;the same caution as the voivode §erban. In spite of defeats&nbsp;inflicted on the Turks by the imperial troops at Pozharevats,&nbsp;Nish and Vidin, in 1689, it was only by an exercise of force that&nbsp;they secured winter quarters in Walachia; and though, after&nbsp;the battle of Poltava in 1709, Brancovan concluded a secret&nbsp;treaty with the tsar Peter the Great, he avoided giving open&nbsp;effect to it. The tranquillity which he thus obtained was&nbsp;employed by Brancovan as by his predecessor in furthering the&nbsp;internal well-being of the country, with what success is best&nbsp;apparent from the description of Walachia left by the Florentine&nbsp;Del Chiaro, who visited the country in 1709 and spent&nbsp;seven years there. He describes the stoneless Walachian&nbsp;plain, with its rich pastures, its crops of maize and&nbsp;millet, and woods so symmetrically planted and&nbsp;carefully kept by Branco van’s orders that hiding in&nbsp;them was out of the question. Butter and honey were exported&nbsp;to supply the sultan’s kitchen at Stambul; wax and cattle&nbsp;to Venice; and the red and white wine of Walachia, notably&nbsp;that of Pitesei, to Transylvania. The Walachian horses were&nbsp;in demand among the Turks and Poles. Near Ribnik and&nbsp;elsewhere were salt-mines which supplied all the wants of the&nbsp;Transdanubian provinces of Turkey; there were considerable&nbsp;copper mines at Maidan; and iron was worked near Tirgovishtea.&nbsp;The gipsy community was bound to bring fifteen pounds weight&nbsp;of gold from the washings of the Argesh. Many of the boiars&nbsp;were wealthy, but the common people were so ground down&nbsp;with taxation that <sup>a</sup> of their ancient Roman valour only&nbsp;the name remained.” To avoid the extortion of their rulers&nbsp;numbers had emigrated to Transylvania and even to the Turkish&nbsp;provinces. The principal Walachian city was Bucharest, containing a population of about 50,000; but, except for two&nbsp;large </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hans</span><span class="font0"> or merchants’ halls built by Brancovan and his</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
