or SI <hi rend="smallcaps">να,</hi> a famous mountain of Arabia Petræa, upon which God gave the law to Moſes. It ſtands in a kind of peninſula, formed by the two arms of the Red Sea, one of which ſtretches out towards the north, and is called the <hi rend="italic">Gulph of Kolſum;</hi> the other extends towards the eaſt, and is called the <hi rend="italic">Gulph of Elan,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Elanih Sea.</hi> At this day the Arabians call Mount Sinai by the name of <hi rend="italic">Tor,</hi> that is, the “ mountain,’ way of excellence ; or <hi rend="italic">Gibel</hi> or J <hi rend="italic">ibel Mouſa,</hi> “ the mountain oſ Moſes.” It is 260 miles from Cairo, and generally it requires a journey of ten days to travel thither. The wilderneſs of Sinai, where the Israelites continued incamped for almoſt a year, and where Moſes erected the tabernacle of the covenant, is conſiderably elevated above the reſt oſ the country ; and the aſcent to it is by a very craggy way, the greateſt part of which is cut out oſ the rock ; then one comes to a large ſpace of ground, which is a plain ſurrounded on all ſides by rocks and eminences, whoſe length is nearly 12 miles. Towards the extremity of this plain, on the north side, two high mountains ſhow themſelves, the higheſt of which is called <hi rend="italic">Sinai</hi> and the other <hi rend="italic">Horeb.</hi> The tops of Horeb and Sinai have a very ſteep aſcent, and do not ſtand upon much ground, in cempariſon to their extraordinary height : that of Sinai is at leaſt one-third part higher than the other, and its aſcent is more upright and difficult.</p><p>Two German miles and a half up the mountain ſtands the convent of St Catharine. The body of this monaſtery is a building 120 feet in length and almoſt as many in breadth. Before it ſtands another ſmall building, in which is the only gate of the convent, which remains always ſhut, except when the bishop is here. At other times, whatever is introduced within the convent, whether men or provisions, is drawn up by the roof in a baſket, and with a cord and a pulley. The whole building is of hewn ſtone ; which, in ſuch a defert, muſt have coſt prodigious expence and pains. Near this chapel issues a fountain of very good fresh water ; it is looked upon as miraculous by ſome who cannot conceive how water can flow from the brow of ſo high and barren a mountain. Five or six paces frona it they ſhow a ſtone, the height oſ which is four or five feet, and breadth about three, which, they ſay, is the very ſtone whence Moſes cauſed the water to guſh out. Its colour is of a ſpotted grey, and it is as it were ſet in a kind of earth, where no other rock appears. This ſtone has 12 holes or channels, which are about a foot wide, whence it is thought the water came forth for the Israelites to drink.</p><p>Much has been ſaid of the writings to be ſeen at Sinai and in the plain about it ; and ſuch were the hopes oſ diſcoveries reſpecting the wanderings of the Iſraelites from theſe writings, that Dr Clayton biſhop of Clogher offered L. 500 Sterling to defray the expences of journey to any man of letters wſho would undertake to copy them. No man, we believe, undertook this taſk : and the accurate Daniſh traveller Niebuhr found no writings there but the names of perſons who had visited the place from curiosity, and of Egyptians who had choſen to be buried in that region.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
