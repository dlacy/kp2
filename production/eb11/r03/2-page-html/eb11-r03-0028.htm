<p><span class="font1">certain operation of war. Enfilade fire by itself was neutralized by traverses </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> in the defences, but by the new method a&nbsp;shot could be so aimed as to skip over each successive traverse&nbsp;and thus to search ground that was immune from direct fire.&nbsp;The application of ricochet fire to operations in the field came&nbsp;somewhat later. In the 18th century field artillery, which was&nbsp;not, before Napoleon’s time, sufficiently mobile to close with the&nbsp;enemy, relied principally upon the ricochet of round shot,&nbsp;which, sweeping a considerable depth of ground, took effect&nbsp;upon several successive lines of hostile troops. But once&nbsp;artillery was able to gallop up to the enemy and to use its far&nbsp;more terrible close-range projectile, case-shot, ricochet fire came&nbsp;to be used less and less, until finally, with the general adoption&nbsp;of shell (which, of course, burst at the first contact with the&nbsp;ground), the round shot disappeared altogether from the battlefield. Similarly in siege warfare, as soon as high-angle fire with&nbsp;shells became sufficiently accurate, there was no further need&nbsp;of round shot and ricochet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The term “ ricochet ” is now only applied, in modern rifle shooting, to the graze of a bullet that has struck short. A&nbsp;modern bullet that has ricochetted inflicts a very severe wound,&nbsp;as its nickel or other hard envelope is torn and jagged by its&nbsp;contact with the ground. With its high remaining velocity&nbsp;it is dangerous even after more than one ricochet, except at&nbsp;extreme ranges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICOLD OF MONTE CROCE (1242-1320), Italian Dominican missionary, was born at Monte Croce, near Florence. In 1267&nbsp;he entered the Dominican house of Santa Maria Novella in&nbsp;Florence, and in 1272 that of St Catherine in Pisa. He started&nbsp;for Acre with a papal commission to preach in 1286 or 1287:&nbsp;in 1288 or 1289 he began to keep a record of his experiences&nbsp;in the Levant; this record he probably reduced to final book&nbsp;form in Bagdad. Entering Syria at Acre, he crossed Galilee&nbsp;to the Sea of Tiberias; thence returning to Acre he seems&nbsp;to have travelled down the coast to Jaffa, and so up to Jerusalem. After visiting the Jordan and the Dead Sea he quitted&nbsp;Palestine by the coast road, retracing his steps to Acre and&nbsp;passing on by Tripoli and Tortosa into Cilicia. From the&nbsp;Cilician port of Lajazzo he started on the great high road to&nbsp;Tabriz in north Persia. Crossing the Taurus he travelled on&nbsp;by Sivas of Cappadocia to Erzerum, the neighbourhood of&nbsp;Ararat and Tabriz. In and near Tabriz he preached for several&nbsp;months, after which he proceeded to Bagdad via Mosul and&nbsp;Tekrit. In Bagdad he stayed several years, studying the&nbsp;Koran and other works of Moslem theology, for controversial&nbsp;purposes, arguing with Nestorian Christians, and writing. In&nbsp;1301 Ricold again appeared </span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1">Florence: some time after&nbsp;this he proposed to submit his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Confutalio Alcorani</span><span class="font1"> to the pope,&nbsp;but did not. He died on the 31st of October 1320. As a&nbsp;traveller and observer his merits are conspicuous. His account&nbsp;of the Tatars and his sketch of Moslem religion and manners&nbsp;are especially noteworthy. In spite of strong prejudice, he&nbsp;shows remarkable breadth of view and appreciation of merit&nbsp;in systems the most hostile to his own. [sic] fifteen</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RICOTTI-MAGNANI, CESARE (1822- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), Italian general</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and knight of the Annunziata, was born at Borgo Lavezzaro on the 30th of June 1822. As artillery lieutenant he distinguished himself and was wounded at the siege of Peschiera&nbsp;in 1848, and in 1852 gained further distinction by his efforts&nbsp;to prevent the explosion of a burning powder magazine. After&nbsp;serving from 1856 to 1859 as director of the Artillery School,&nbsp;he became general of division in 1864, commanding the 5th&nbsp;division at the battle of San Martino. In the war of 1866 he&nbsp;stormed Borgoforte, to open a passage for CialdinFs army.&nbsp;Upon the death of General Govone in 1872 he was appointed&nbsp;minister of war, and after the occupation of Rome bent all his&nbsp;efforts to army reform, in accordance with the lessons of the&nbsp;Franco-German War. He shortened the period of military&nbsp;service; extended conscription to all able-bodied men; created&nbsp;a permanent army, a mobile militia and a reserve; commenced the renewal of armaments; and placed Italy in a&nbsp;position to put 1,800,000 men on a war footing. Ricotti fell&nbsp;from power with the Right in 1876, but returned to office with&nbsp;Depretis in 1884, and amended his previous scheme of reform.&nbsp;Resigning in April 1887, he became a member of the senate in&nbsp;1890, but took little part in public life until 1896, when, after&nbsp;the battle of Adowa, he was entrusted by King Humbert with&nbsp;the formation of a cabinet. Having constructed his ministry,&nbsp;he made over the premiership to the marquis di Rudini, retaining for himself the portfolio of war, and seeking to satisfy&nbsp;popular demands for the reduction of military expenditure&nbsp;by consolidating the tactical structure of the army without&nbsp;weakening its fighting power. Rudini, however, finding that&nbsp;RicottPs ideas, which he himself shared, were not acceptable&nbsp;at court, obliged him to resign office. His prestige as creator&nbsp;of the modern Italian army remained unimpaired, and his views&nbsp;on army consolidation enjoyed a large measure of technical and&nbsp;public favour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIDDING, GEORGE (1828-1904), English headmaster and bishop, was born at Winchester College, of which his father,&nbsp;the Rev. Charles Ridding, vicar of Andover, was a fellow, on&nbsp;the 16th of March 1828. He was educated at Winchester&nbsp;and at Balliol College, Oxford. He became a&lt; fellow of Exeter&nbsp;College and was a tutor from 1853 to 1863. In 1853 he&nbsp;married Mary Louisa Moberly, who died within a year of her&nbsp;marriage. He was appointed second master of Winchester&nbsp;College in 1863, and on the retirement of his father-in-law,&nbsp;Dr Moberly, he succeeded to the headmastership. During&nbsp;the tenure of this office (1867-1884) he carried out successfully&nbsp;a series of radical reforms in the organization of the school,&nbsp;resulting in a great increase both in its reputation and numbers.&nbsp;In 1884 he became the first bishop of Southwell, and brought&nbsp;his powers of organization and conspicuous tact and moderation to bear on the management of the new diocese. He took&nbsp;an active share in its educational and social work, and&nbsp;was materially assisted in these respects by his second wife,&nbsp;Lady Laura Palmer, daughter of the ist earl of Selborne. He&nbsp;resigned his see a short time before his death, which took place&nbsp;on the 30th of August 1904.</span></p>

They spring from man’s earliest&nbsp;perception that there are such things as analogies in nature.&nbsp;Man observes an example of analogy, puts his observations&nbsp;in the form of a question, and there is the riddle ready made.&nbsp;Some Boeotian humorist, for example, detected the analogy&nbsp;between the life of humanity—the child on all fours, the man&nbsp;erect on two legs, old age with its staff—on one side, and on the&nbsp;other the conception of an animal with a varying number of&nbsp;limbs. Put this in a question and it is the riddle of the Sphinx.&nbsp;Another instance is the question, “ What we caught we threw&nbsp;away, what we could not catch we kept.” Homer is said to&nbsp;have died of vexation at not being able to discover the answer&nbsp;to this riddle, still current on the coast of Brittany, in Germany&nbsp;and in Gascony. After inventing the riddle, men began to&nbsp;use it in a kind of game; bets were staked on the answer and&nbsp;sides were made, each side backing its champion. These&nbsp;sports in Marriner’s time were common in Tonga; they are&nbsp;no less popular among the African Woloffs. Samson’s riddle&nbsp;set to the Philistines is an instance of the sport in a Semitic&nbsp;country.
