<p>the moſt .eaſy is by means of the pentagraph, or paral-klogram ; but this hath its defects. See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pen-</hi> TAGRAPH.</p><p>The beſt and moſt ufual methods of reduction are as follow: i. To reduce a figure, as ABCDE (n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> ι.), into a lefs compaſs. About the middle of the figure, as z, pitch on a point, and from this point draw lines to its feveral angles A, B, C, &amp;c. then drawing the line <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> parallel to AB, <hi rend="italic">b c</hi> parallel to BC, &amp;c. you will have the figure <hi rend="italic">αb e de</hi> fimilar to ABCDE.</p><p>If the figure <hi rend="italic">abode</hi> had been required to be enlarged, there needed nothing but to produce the lines from the point beyond the angles, as <hi rend="italic">z</hi> D, <hi rend="italic">ζ</hi> C, &amp;c. and to draw lines, viz. DC, CB, &amp;c. parallel to the ſides <hi rend="italic">d c, cb,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>2. To reduce a figure by the angle of proportion, ſuppofe the figure ABCDE (n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 2.) required to be diminiſhed in the proportion of the line AB to <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> (n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 3.), draw the indefinite line GH (n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 4.), and frofn G to H ſet off the line AB. Οη G defcribe the arch HI. Set off the line <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> as a chord on HI, and draw GI. Then with the angle IGH, you have all the meafures of the figure to be drawn. Thus to lay down the point <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> take the interval BC, and upon the point G deſcribe the arch KL. Alſo on the point G deſcribe MN ; and upon A, with the diſtance MN, deſcribe an arch cutting the preceding one in <hi rend="italic">c,</hi> which will determine the fide <hi rend="italic">b c.</hi> And after the ſame manner are the other ſides and angles to be deſcribed. The ſame proceſs will alſo ſerve to enlarge the figure.</p><p>3. To reduce a figure by a ſcale. Meaſure all the fides of the figure, as ABCDE (n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> <hi rend="italic">2.}</hi> by a ſcale, and lay down the ſame meafures refpectively from a fmaller fcale in the proportion required.</p><p>4. To reduce a map, defign, or figure, by ſquares. Divide the original into little fquares, and divide a freſh paper of the dimenfions required into the ſame number of ſquares, which are to be larger or leſs than the former, as the map is to be enlarged or diminiſhed. This done in every ſquare of the ſecond figure, draw what you find in its correſpondent one in the firſt.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Reduction,</hi> in metallurgy, is the bringing back metalline fubſtances which have been changed into fcoriæ or aſhes, or· otherwiſe diverted of their metallic form, into their natural and original ſtate of metals again. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Metallurgy,</hi> <hi rend="italic">I <hi rend="sup">a</hi> Jfi <hi rend="sup">m</hi> &gt;</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry,</hi> n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 140.. and 320.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Reduction,</hi> in ſurgery, denotes an operation whereby a diſlocated, luxated, or fractured bone, is reſtored to its former ſtate or place.</p>
