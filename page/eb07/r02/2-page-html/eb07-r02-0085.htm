<p><span class="font0">ally throw into the background the wilder passions and more stormy impulses of our nature, until they acquire an&nbsp;importance which not only justifies, but renders their introduction into any fictitious narrative which represents the&nbsp;peculiarities of the time, necessary ; and for this purpose,&nbsp;the calm and even march of the novel, and the detailed development both of sentiment and incident which it allows,&nbsp;is found to be admirably adapted. It is in the works of our&nbsp;novelists, therefore, rather than our dramatists, and in those&nbsp;passages in our essayists of Queen Anne’s time, in which&nbsp;they treat of past fashions, manners, whims, and humours, that&nbsp;we must look for the changes which society has undergone,&nbsp;and from which we must try to realize to ourselves the&nbsp;features which it exhibited at any particular period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The novel, then, affords a wider field for accurate and complete delineation of plissions and feelings than the&nbsp;drama, and certainly one more in harmony with the dispositions of a modern public. In powerful effects no doubt&nbsp;it cannot compete with the stage. The whole range of&nbsp;novel or romance contains nothing, for instance, which in its&nbsp;tremendous impression, can be compared with the explosion of passion in the third act of Othello ; but, on the other&nbsp;hand, it has greatly the advantage in the impression of verisimilitude which it leaves behind, produced by the accumulation of many particulars and minute traits of character ; in pleasing interchanges of action and repose ; in the&nbsp;delineation of emotions, which the drama, speaking only to&nbsp;the eye and the ear, cannot lay before us ; in the descriptions of external scenery, which, in the hand of a writer of&nbsp;genius, are far more effective, when presented in words to&nbsp;the imagination, than when counterfeited to the eye upon&nbsp;the stage, even by all the united resources of the scene-painter and the mechanist ; and which, from the strong connection which exists between the state of our feelings and&nbsp;external influences, are found in the hands of a judicious&nbsp;novelist, to afford powerful materials for deepening the pervading tone of sentiment which he aims to produce ; just&nbsp;as in painting relief and effect are obtained by the tone&nbsp;and character of the background against which the figures&nbsp;are opposed. Another advantage obtained by the substitution of narrative fiction for the drama, was, that a much&nbsp;wider licence was obtained in the conduct of the plot. A&nbsp;good plot is no doubt as essential to the novel as the drama ;&nbsp;but the kind of plot which may be used with effect in each,&nbsp;and the manner in which the incidents are to be conducted,&nbsp;differ materially. A play in which every scene does not&nbsp;grow out of the preceding, and lead directly into the next,&nbsp;with a visible progress of plot, is in that respect faulty. On&nbsp;the contrary, in the novel and romance, as in real life, much&nbsp;is admissible which is episodical, which does not directly&nbsp;help forward nor produce the catastrophe, but merely tends&nbsp;to bring out some point of character in the personages represented, or to increase the air of verisimilitude in the main&nbsp;story, by the appearance of minute and literal correctness&nbsp;in the details. In the novel or romance, too, it has been&nbsp;generally remarked that the catastrophe maybe made to turn&nbsp;upon accident, but that this is inadmissible in the drama.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Thus the catastrophe in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bride of Lammermoor,</span><span class="font0"> where&nbsp;Ravenswood is swallowed up by a quicksand, is singularly&nbsp;grand in romance, but would be inadmissible in a drama.&nbsp;And on the same principle, Schiller has, in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fiesco,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">thought himself compelled to deviate from the actual truth&nbsp;of history, and to ascribe the Count’s death, not to an accidental stumble from a plank, but to the hand of the republican Verrina. In a novel, the real catastrophe would have&nbsp;been far more impressive in its moral effect than the imaginary one ; but Schiller held, and we think rightly, that in&nbsp;the drama nothing must be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">accident,</span><span class="font0"> but every thing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although, as compared with the romance, tbe term novel</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">may be said to indicate a class of fictions dealing more witll calm feelings, and with manners and humours, than with&nbsp;strong passions, and deriving its interest more from the probability than the marvellous nature of its incidents, this definition is not to be taken too literally ; for there are many&nbsp;works which we might call novels, in as much as the scene&nbsp;is laid in modern times, and the general course of the incidents is that of every-day life, but in which the even tenor&nbsp;of the story is occasionally broken by scenes of powerful&nbsp;passion, or incidents of a mysterious and terrible character,&nbsp;elevating the composition for the time into the sphere of&nbsp;the romantic ; so that perhaps the word tale, as a middle&nbsp;term between the others, would most appropriately describe&nbsp;them. It has been doubted whether, although such a union&nbsp;of the common-place with tlle extraordinary, be not unfre-quently met with in the course of real life, a more cautious separation of these elements would not, on the whole,&nbsp;be most favourable to the effect of a narrative as a work of&nbsp;art ; and whether the attempt to blend them, does not produce in fiction, something of that illegitimate effect which&nbsp;is the result of the melo-drama on the stage. It is certain,&nbsp;however, that the tendency for some time past, and particularly since the school of fiction introduced by Sir Walter&nbsp;Scott, has been towards a mixture of the novel and romance in the same composition, so that broad comedy is&nbsp;often found alternating with the pathetic, the gaiety of a&nbsp;ball-room with midnight murders upon lonely heaths, and&nbsp;the disclosure of some piece of fashionable scandal standing&nbsp;side by side with the discovery of some secret and fearful crime.&nbsp;In the hands of our great masters of fiction, we admit the&nbsp;fine effect which these occasionally produce. Judiciously&nbsp;arranged, these opposites are the light and shadow of the&nbsp;composition ; but even in our greatest modern novelist, we&nbsp;could point out not a few instances in which this sort of&nbsp;contrast is carried too far ; while in many of his imitators, it&nbsp;is so regularly and mechanically introduced, that, as in the&nbsp;case of Mr. Puff’s stage arrangements, we can always predict&nbsp;that the discharge of cannon wilt be followed by soft music.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the declining popularity of tlle pastoral and heroic romance of the seventeenth century, suggested the&nbsp;necessity of opening a new vein in fiction, it is probable&nbsp;that the stilted, unnatural, and exaggerated character of&nbsp;those effete compositions led the public taste, by a natural&nbsp;recoil of feeling, into the opposite extreme, viz. the selection of topics and characters from common, and even from&nbsp;vulgar life, and a literal adherence to nature, even at the risk&nbsp;of the sacrifice of art. For we pass over the tiresome and&nbsp;licentious love stories of Mrs. Aphra Behn, with the just remark of Sir Richard Steele, that the lady appears to have&nbsp;“ understood the practical part of love better than the speculative,” as well as those of her imitator, Mrs. Heywood, in&nbsp;which the struggle between the high sentimental character&nbsp;of the heroic romance, and the growing taste for a style of&nbsp;portraiture more true to the life, is very obvious, and come&nbsp;at once to the writer by whom the inspiration of reality was&nbsp;carried to its greatest perfection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Defoe, (1661—1731) without high imagination, with no power of raising the passions, with little pathos and no&nbsp;eloquence, had yet that peculiar genius which enabled&nbsp;him to excel within the peculiar department which he&nbsp;chose for himself ; that of counterfeiting homely truth by&nbsp;fiction, and forging, as it were, the handw<sup>τ</sup>ritιng of nature&nbsp;herself, with a dexterity which defied detection. Whether&nbsp;Defoe was led to the selection of his peculiar themes, by&nbsp;a real sympathy with roguery, (and his conduct in regard to&nbsp;the well-known imposture of Mrs. Veal’s Ghost would justify us in believing him to be like Gil Blas, “ tant soi peu&nbsp;fripon ;”) or by the influence of the Spanish romances of&nbsp;roguery, such as Lazaro de Tormes, Marcos de Obregon,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
