<p><span class="font0">brood-cells are amoebulae (pseudopodiospores) (fig. 5, 4) which grow into the multinucleate B type, with a nonspiculate&nbsp;theca (fig. S, s). The resolution of the B type&nbsp;is preceded by rapid multiplication of the&nbsp;nuclei by mitosis (fig. 5, 7), and the uninucleate&nbsp;cells are 2-flagellate zoospores (fig. 5, 9).
