<p>May 1781. His father (who died in 1822) was much esteemed in Anhalt, where, as “ kammerdirector,” he did excellent service to agriculture. Raumer was educated at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium, Berlin, and at the universities of Halle and Göttingen. In 1801 he began to practise as a lawyer in the Brandenburg chamber, and in the following year he was made assessor. From 1806 to 1808 he was connected with a department of the crown lands chamber at Wusterhausen near Berlin. Having been made a councillor in 1809, he was called in 1810 to a post in the office for the national debt, and soon afterwards received an appointment in the bureau of the chancellor, Hardenberg. He was made a professor at the university of Breslau in 1811, and in 1819 he became professor of political science and history at Berlin. In 1815 he had carried on historical investigations in Venice, and in the two following years he had travelled much in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. At Berlin he was for some time a member of the Upper Board of Censors and secretary of the Academy of Sciences. The former office he resigned in 1831, the latter in 1847. His professorship at the Berlin university he did not give up until 1853, and even then he did not altogether cease to lecture. In 1848 he was elected a member of the national assembly at Frankfort, where he associated himself with the right centre ; and from Frankfort he was sent on a mission to Paris. At a later period he was a member of the first chamber of the Prussian parliament. He died at Berlin on 14th June 1873.
