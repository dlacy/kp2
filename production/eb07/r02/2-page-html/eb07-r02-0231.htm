<p><span class="font0">The state of education, according to the parliamentary returns made in 1821 and 1824-26, was as follows:</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Of the numbers stated in the latter of these returns, 1041 were Episcopalian Protestants, and 13,262 Roman Catholics ; the religious persuasion of the remaining 343 was not&nbsp;specified. The total number of schools in the county was&nbsp;309 ; of which seventeen, containing 545 pupils, were maintained by grants of public money ; thirty-eight, containing&nbsp;1954 pupils, by the voluntary contributions of societies or individuals ; and the remaining 254 schools, which afforded the&nbsp;means of instruction to 12,147 pupils, were maintained wholly&nbsp;by the pupils’ fees. The report of the Commissioners of&nbsp;National Education in 1837 (the latest published) states the&nbsp;number of schools, teachers, and pupils, connected with&nbsp;their board, as follows : Schools, eleven ; teachers, twelve ;&nbsp;boys, 941 ; girls, 757 ; total of pupils, 1698. The diocesan&nbsp;school of the see of Elphin is in the county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The habits of the population are so thoroughly rural, that there are but four towns of which the population of each exceeds a thousand souls, two of them containing between three&nbsp;and four thousand, and the other two between one and two&nbsp;thousand. There are several fine mansions and demesnes&nbsp;in the hands of resident noblemen and gentlemen, and&nbsp;numerous villas and country-seats belonging to independent&nbsp;landed proprietors ; but as to the small farmers and cottiers,&nbsp;the appearance of their dwellings and homesteads in many&nbsp;cases are far from showing those indications of internal&nbsp;comfort that might be expected in a district so highly favoured by nature. Agriculture is carried on with much&nbsp;spirit amongst the higher classes, by whom the latest improvements in tillage, and the best constructed vehicles and&nbsp;implements, have been introduced ; but the old customs&nbsp;and antiquated implements are pertinaciously adhered to&nbsp;by most of the smaller farmers. Wheat is largely sown ; a&nbsp;judicious rotation system is carried on ; and green crops are&nbsp;frequent, with the exception of turnips and mangel-wurzel,&nbsp;which have not been found to answer. In the mountainous&nbsp;districts the spade is frequently used instead of the plough.&nbsp;In these also the neighbouring landholders generally club&nbsp;their labour together, particularly in planting and raising&nbsp;potatoes, all uniting to complete the work of one farm, and&nbsp;then proceeding successively in a body to execute that&nbsp;of the other partners in the amicable joint-stock concern.&nbsp;The pastures are amongst the best in Ireland, and as their&nbsp;proprietors are almost fastidiously particular in the selection&nbsp;of live stock of every description, the best-fed beasts are to&nbsp;be met with here. This is peculiarly the case with respect&nbsp;to bullocks ; the sheep also are of first-rate quality, both as&nbsp;to fleece and flavour of carcass. In prime grazing land an&nbsp;acre feeds a bullock and a sheep. Notwithstanding the superior capabilities of the soil for pasturage, there are not&nbsp;many large dairies. But few farms, however small, are&nbsp;without one cow, if not more, so that butter of excellent&nbsp;quality is made, not only sufficient for the internal demand,&nbsp;but for forming a material article of export. The breed of&nbsp;horses is much esteemed. The annual fair of Ballinasloe,&nbsp;in October, is the principal mart at which the black cattle&nbsp;and sheep are disposed of. Fences in general are made of&nbsp;stone-walls, raised to a considerable height, as they arc considered to afford better shelter for cattle than those of timber. That the county was once well wooded, appears not&nbsp;only from the evidence of history, but from the fact that&nbsp;wherever the impediments to its growth are removed, the&nbsp;soil spontaneously throws up shoots of those species of forest-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">trees with which the whole face of the country was once covered. The excessive clearing of the woods, without&nbsp;precautionary measures to secure a new growth, has left&nbsp;the surface very bare ; but this defect, equally unsightly to&nbsp;the eye of taste and injurious to the progress of improvement, is annually diminishing, through the exertions of the&nbsp;landed gentry, many of whose mansions are surrounded with&nbsp;noble plantations. Manufactures, with the exception of&nbsp;those already noticed, and of coarse woollens and linens for&nbsp;domestic consumption, are almost unknown. The articles&nbsp;of export are confined to agricultural produce and live&nbsp;stock, for which the recent improvements on the course of&nbsp;the Shannon have afforded great facilities. The navigation of this fine river, which, as has already been said, skirts&nbsp;the county along the whole of its eastern verge, was so&nbsp;much obstructed by several rapids as to render it useless&nbsp;as a channel of enlarged inland traffic. These impediments&nbsp;have been obviated by means of short canals along the side&nbsp;of the river in those parts where the rapids occur. The&nbsp;first is from Lough Allen in Leitrim to Battlebridge, whence&nbsp;the river-stream is available somewhat farther than Carrick,&nbsp;where a second canal serves to avoid the rapids between&nbsp;Jamestown and Drumsna. Other short canals occur at the&nbsp;falls of Ruskey, of Lanesborough, and of Athlone. Thence&nbsp;the channel is clear to the junction with the Suck, where&nbsp;it quits the county. The connection by water with the&nbsp;eastern counties to Dublin is maintained by the Royal and&nbsp;Grand Canals, which communicate with the Shannon at&nbsp;Tarmonbarry and Shannon Harbour. The principal exports are corn and butter, all the coal as yet raised being&nbsp;not more than sufficient for the supply of the districts surrounding the collieries. As all the great lines of land&nbsp;conveyance to Connaught from Leinster and Ulster pass&nbsp;through the county, the roads are numerous, and generally&nbsp;well kept up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The monastic antiquities are very numerous. The ruins of the abbey of Boyle still exhibit a large part of its highly&nbsp;ornamented church, with its tower rising from the middle&nbsp;of the building, and resting on four colum∏3 of colossal dimensions, enriched with a variety of sculptures ; and the Dominican friary at Roscommon contains a monument of an&nbsp;ancient member of the O’Conor family, exhibiting an effigy&nbsp;of an armed warrior in a lying posture, with four other&nbsp;armed figures on the base. Derhan Abbey, in the neighbourhood of Roscommon, is little more than a heap of&nbsp;stones. The others of which some relics still exist, are&nbsp;Trinity Abbey in Lough Kea, Tulsk, Clonshanvill, and&nbsp;Clontuskert, in which there are several monuments and inscriptions relating to the O’Kellys and other ancient families. In the parish of Oran on the Suck, in the west of&nbsp;the county, are the remains of an ancient pillar-tower, about&nbsp;ten feet high ; and in every part there are raths so numerous&nbsp;that nearly five hundred are still visible. The county contained a great number of small fortresses, evidently built when&nbsp;it was one of the marches or border districts, to repress the&nbsp;incursions of the Connaught Irish, besides which there were&nbsp;a few of great extent and strength, as is testified by that of&nbsp;Roscommon, forming a quadrangle of 220 by 180 feet, with&nbsp;towers at the angles and at the gateway, and containing&nbsp;the remains of a large building, supposed to be the residence&nbsp;of the governor. The most remarkable of the other castles&nbsp;are those of Athlone, Ballinasloe, Ballynafad, and Lough&nbsp;Glynn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roscommon, the county town, is built on the sides of a hill, near the middle of the county, in a plain between the&nbsp;Shannon and the Suck. It consists but of one main street, with&nbsp;several minor avenues branching out into five main roads,&nbsp;in various directions. It was incorporated at a very early&nbsp;period, and was considered to be one of the chief places in&nbsp;these parts. Writs for the better defence of the town and&nbsp;castle are frequent among the earlier records. It returned</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
