It is found also in the southern hemisphere, on the coasts of Tasmania and New Zealand, where, however, it seems to be less abundant, since its presence at the antipodes has been discovered only recently, and it does not seem to be the object of a regular fishery. Sprats are very often confounded with young herrings, which they much resemble, but can always be distinguished by the following characters : they do not possess any teeth on the palate <hi rend="italic">(vomer),</hi> like herrings ; their gill-covers are smooth, without the radiating striæ which are found in the shad and the pilchard ; the anal fin consists of from seventeen to twenty rays, and the lateral line of forty-seven or forty-eight scales. The ventral fins are even with the origin of the dorsal fin ; and the spine consists of from forty-seven to forty-nine vertebræ. The sprat is one of the more important food-fishes on account of the immense numbers which are caught when the shoals approach the coasts. They are somewhat capricious, however, as regards the place and time of their appearance, the latter falling chiefly in the first half of winter. They are caught with the sein or with the bag-net in the tideway. Large quantities are consumed fresh, but many are pickled or smoked, and others prepared like anchovies. Frequently the captures are so large that the fish can be used as manure only.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
