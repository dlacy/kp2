of Chios, a Greek geographer of uncertain date, known to us only by a few references in later writers, but perhaps identical with the Scymnus Chius of a Delphic inscription of the beginning of the 2d century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>,<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Rhode, in <hi rend="italic">Rhein.

Meineke showed conclusively that this piece cannot be by Scymnus. It is dedicated to a King Nicomedes, probably Nicomedes III. of Bithynia, and so would date from the beginning of the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> See MÃ¼ller, <hi rend="italic">Geog. Gr. Min.,</hi> vol. i., where the poem is edited with sufficient prolegomena.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
