<p><span class="font0">both a foretaste and earnest of what it was destined to secure, “ on earth peace, and good-will towards men.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But this universal calm was of brief duration. The Roman forces in Germany had been entrusted to the command of Quintilius Varus, who exercised his power in a harsh and&nbsp;oppressive manner. This the high-spirited Germans could&nbsp;not brook, and a revolt was planned and executed under&nbsp;the management of Arminius (Herman), who succeeded in&nbsp;drawing the Roman army into a position in which they&nbsp;could neither fight nor fly. Varus himself, with three legions and six cohorts, perished on the field, or in an ineffectual attempt to secure a retreat. The destruction of&nbsp;this army preyed deeply on the spirits of Augustus, who&nbsp;nevertheless exerted himself to remedy the disaster, by sending first Tiberius, and then Germanicus, the son of Drusus,&nbsp;into Germany, at the head of a more numerous force. These&nbsp;German wars were continued with more or less vigour&nbsp;throughout the remainder of the reign of Augustus, and&nbsp;with more or less success, generally under the brave and&nbsp;skilful command of Germanicus, who acquired for himself a&nbsp;very brilliant renown, and the esteem of the whole empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to these public troubles, Augustus suffered great affliction from the misconduct and the calamities of&nbsp;his family. Not having a son to succeed him in the empire,&nbsp;his wife Livia engaged in the most restless intrigues to secure the succession to her own children by her former husband. Augustus, on the other hand, destined the empire&nbsp;to Marcellus, his nephew and son-in-law, to whom he had&nbsp;given in marriage his only daughter Julia. Upon the early&nbsp;death of Marcellus, a youth of high promise in every respect, Augustus manifested his intention of leaving the empire to his grandsons, the sons of Julia by Agrippa, to whom&nbsp;she had been married after the death of Marcellus. He gave&nbsp;them the title of “princes of the youth ;” and this undisguised favour so much offended Tiherius, that he withdrew&nbsp;from the court. The premature death of the two young&nbsp;princes, not without suspicion of having been poisoned by&nbsp;the empress Livia, to make way for her own son, cat∙ed the&nbsp;recall of Tiberius. Augustus bestowed upon him his daughter Julia, the widow of Marcellus and Agrippa, requiring&nbsp;him at the same time to adopt Drusus Germanicus, the son&nbsp;of his brother Drusus. The infamously licentious conduct&nbsp;of Julia at length so much disgusted her father, that he banished her to the island of Pandataria. Thus harassed by&nbsp;domestic troubles, the master of the world found that imperial power could not secure happiness, or lessen one of the&nbsp;pangs tllat waste the weary heart. He was seized with&nbsp;a dangerous illness while at Naples, and becoming worse&nbsp;while on his return, was unable to reach Rome, but expired&nbsp;at Nola, in the seventy-sixth year of his age, after having&nbsp;swayed the sceptre of imperial power during forty-four&nbsp;years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The vacant throne was now ascended by Tiberius Claudius Nero, son of Livia, and latterly adopted son of Augustus. Almost the first act of Tiberius was to secure the empire by causing the murder of Agrippa Posthumus, the third son of Agrippa by Julia, thus completing the bloody policy&nbsp;by which his mother had opened his way to the sovereignty.&nbsp;He was in his fifty-sixth year when he succeeded to the&nbsp;empire ; and though he had given evidence of the possession of by no means contemptible talents in his younger&nbsp;days, especially in his German wars, he had so long practised the arts of dissimulation and guile, that all his better&nbsp;mind seemed to have perished, and his baser qualities alone&nbsp;remained, or rather to have been stimulated into unnatural&nbsp;strength. Though now possessed of absolute power, he&nbsp;still continued to practise the subtle wiles of a. dark and&nbsp;crooked policy, and to seek to accomplish by deceit what&nbsp;he could easily have done by strength. The murder of&nbsp;young Agrippa removed the most formidable rival ; but the&nbsp;high renown of his nephew Germanicus, then waging suc</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">cessful war in the country whence he acquired his name, excited at once his envy, his hatred, and his fear; and he recalled him, on pretence of giving him the honours of a triumph. The residence of Germanicus at Rome could not long be endured by Tiberius ; he was therefore sent into&nbsp;Syria, to quell the disorders of the east. Along with him&nbsp;were sent Piso and his wife, whose secret directions may be&nbsp;conjectured from their actual conduct, which was to harass&nbsp;him by every means in their power; and when he died,&nbsp;there were not wanting pregnant causes of suspicion that his&nbsp;death had been hastened by poison. The death of Germanicus was deplored by the whole Roman people, as a&nbsp;great public calamity, which none seemed more to deplore&nbsp;than Tiberius, while he inwardly rejoiced in the success of&nbsp;his atrocious villany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In public life Tiberius was equally deceitful and cruel as he had been in private, and to his own relatives. Towards&nbsp;the senate he professed great respect, at the very time&nbsp;when he was depriving them of even the slender power&nbsp;which Augustus had left. Any remains of public virtue, wdfich the senate had hitherto possessed, died rapidly&nbsp;away ; and ceasing to exercise an independent authority in&nbsp;a free state, it became the passive instrument of the most&nbsp;brutal tyranny. Every deceitful person is necessarily at the&nbsp;same time suspicious. Full of guile himself, the dark-hearted&nbsp;emperor suspected every other man to be equally guileful.&nbsp;Hence his encouragement of innumerable spies and informers, who were ready fabricators of accusations, when&nbsp;they could detect no real criminality. The constant terrors&nbsp;of the suspicious tyrant increased his natural cruelty, till he&nbsp;ripened into a perfect monster of barbarity, delighting to&nbsp;glut his eyes with the agonies of his tortured victims.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the most suspicious of tyrants must trust some person, were it but to have an instrument to execute their crimes; and as none but abandoned persons can be their&nbsp;instruments, they never trust without being betrayed. Tiberius reposed his chief confidence on Sejanus, præfect of the&nbsp;prætorian guard, a man whose crimes, if possible, surpassed&nbsp;those of the emperor himself. For eight successive years&nbsp;did Sejanus retain an undivided influence over the mind of&nbsp;Tiberius ; and during that period he contrived to procure the&nbsp;death or banishment of almost every person who might have&nbsp;checked his progress to the possession of imperial power,&nbsp;which was the object of his treacherous ambition. The&nbsp;death of Drusus, the emperor’s son, is attributed to Sejanus, as also the death of the two eldest sons of Germanicus, and the banishment of their mother Agrippina. The&nbsp;youngest son probably escaped in consequence ofhis almost&nbsp;constant residence with' the army. But the master-stroke&nbsp;of policy by which Sejanus strove to secure his object, was&nbsp;his persuading the emperor to remove from the cares and&nbsp;dangers of Rome, and to indulge his passions in a retirement&nbsp;where he would have none around him but his depraved&nbsp;ministers of vice. Tiberius retired to Capreæ, where he&nbsp;abandoned himself to the perpetration of the most disgusting and unnatural vices, leaving Sejanus at Rome, in the&nbsp;possession of all but the name of imperial power. To this&nbsp;base and bloody favourite the senate displayed the utmost&nbsp;servility ; the people gave him honours second only to those&nbsp;of the emperor ; and the sceptre itself seemed on the point&nbsp;of passing into his grasp, when he was accused to Tiberius&nbsp;of plotting his death. The imperial dissembler conferred&nbsp;the consulship on Sejanus ; and by the messenger who conveyed this honour, sent a letter to the senate, accusing him&nbsp;of treason. When Sejanus came to the senate to receive&nbsp;his official dignity, he met his accusation, was instantly condemned, dragged through the streets, and put to death with&nbsp;the utmost ignominy by those who a few hours before followed him with acclamations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fall of Sejanus seemed only to increase the suspicions and the barbarous cruelty of the debauched and monstrous</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
