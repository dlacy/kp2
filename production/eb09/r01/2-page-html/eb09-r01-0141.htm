<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of the New Testament, and in 1526 we hear of its introduction into Oxford by Thomas Garret, and of the volume being burnt at Paul’s Cross. On 27th November 1527&nbsp;Bilney and Arthur were examined at the Chapter House&nbsp;at Westminster before Wolsey and other ecclesiastics, as&nbsp;to whether they had preached or taught to the people&nbsp;the opinions of Luther or any others condemned by the&nbsp;church. Owing to the proximity of Cambridge to the&nbsp;seaports and commercial towns of the eastern counties, such&nbsp;as Yarmouth, Harwich, and Norwich, the university would&nbsp;appear to have become familiarized with the Lutheran&nbsp;doctrines much sooner than Oxford. From 3d July to&nbsp;20th September 1527 Wolsey was in France, intent on&nbsp;bringing about the marriage of Princess Mary with the&nbsp;duke of Orleans, and on gaining the support of Francis&nbsp;in the matter of the royal divorce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Henry himself had at this time fully resolved to carry the latter project into effect, and the doubts raised with&nbsp;respect to the validity of his marriage and the legitimacy&nbsp;of Mary cannot be regarded as anything more than official&nbsp;formalities, designed to give a veil of decency to his real&nbsp;purpose. While in France Wolsey learned from Flanders&nbsp;that the emperor had become apprised of Henry’s real&nbsp;intentions, and he himself now proceeded (to quote his&nbsp;own words) to employ “all possible ways and practices&nbsp;for the obtaining of the pope’s consent.” Unfortunately&nbsp;for the success of his efforts, Henry at this juncture conceived the design of sending another agent to Home, to&nbsp;act altogether independently of Wolsey, and charged to&nbsp;procure, not only the appointment of a commission empowered to dissolve the marriage with Catherine, but also&nbsp;a dispensation removing all obstacles to the king’s second&nbsp;marriage with Anne Boleyn. Clement was still a prisoner&nbsp;in the castle of St Angelo, but on the evening of the&nbsp;9th December 1527, disguised in a blouse and carrying a&nbsp;basket and an empty sack on his back, he effected his&nbsp;escape, and with the assistance of a guide arrived the&nbsp;next morning at Orvieto. From that day his resolve&nbsp;was probably definitively taken, and, notwithstanding his&nbsp;previous promises and his subsequent apparent concessions, he would seem to have been firmly resolved not to&nbsp;grant his consent to a measure deeply humiliating to himself and certain to expose him to the full brunt of the&nbsp;emperor’s resentment. But at Orvieto Henry’s delegate,&nbsp;Knight, although untrained and ill qualified for the task of&nbsp;a diplomatist, obtained both a commission and a dispensation, which, however, on his reaching England, were both&nbsp;found to be worthless, owing to designed non-observance&nbsp;of the necessary technicalities. In the following year&nbsp;Foxe and Gardiner were despatched on a like errand.&nbsp;The latter was far better suited for the work than Knight;&nbsp;and he did not scruple to threaten the trembling pontiff&nbsp;with the complete withdrawal of Henry’s support, and to&nbsp;predict as the inevitable consequence the collapse of the&nbsp;already tottering apostolic see,—a result which, he declared, “ would be attended by the applause and satisfaction of the whole world.” By such menaces Clement was&nbsp;eventually induced again to grant a commission and a&nbsp;dispensation. A decretal bull, formally annulling Henry’s&nbsp;first marriage, was handed to Campeggio, which he was&nbsp;instructed to show to the king and then to destroy. But&nbsp;in the meantime the celebrated brief executed by Julius&nbsp;IL, in which the dispensation for Henry’s first marriage&nbsp;was re-enacted in more precise and unqualified terms, was&nbsp;discovered in the Spanish archives. It was sought to&nbsp;show that the brief was a forgery, but to this view of&nbsp;the matter Clement altogether refused to assent. At&nbsp;length, however, in May 1529 the legate proceeded to&nbsp;open his court at Westminster. The courageous conduct&nbsp;of Catherine put honourable men to shame; and no</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">slight impression was produced by Bishop Fisher’s heroic declaration of his willingness to stake his life that her&nbsp;marriage with the king was perfectly valid. Campeggio,&nbsp;under various pretexts, still hesitated and delayed. In&nbsp;July the news of the peace of Cambray arrived, and it&nbsp;was known that the influence of the emperor would henceforth be paramount in Italy, while it was believed that&nbsp;the projected marriage between the French monarch and&nbsp;the sister of the emperor augured a durable peace between&nbsp;the empire and France. Then the legate adjourned the&nbsp;court and the pontiff revoked the cause to Borne. All&nbsp;around Wolsey saw the plans which he had laid with so&nbsp;much toil and skill breaking up, and on him the royal&nbsp;displeasure vented itself. He died 30tli November 1530,&nbsp;a victim to the wanton caprice of one whom he had served&nbsp;only too faithfully, and with him the ablest supporter of&nbsp;papal influence and the most formidable opponent of&nbsp;Beformation principles in England disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Henry would not condescend׳ to appear before a Boman court, and as a last expedient it was proposed that the&nbsp;question of the legality of his first marriage should be&nbsp;submitted to the learned bodies, the universities and eminent canonists of Europe. This scheme had already been&nbsp;recommended by the episcopal bench, but to Cranmer’s&nbsp;ingenuity is attributed the further suggestion that the&nbsp;opinion thus obtained should be carried into effect by a&nbsp;court convened in England. Commissioners, among whom&nbsp;Bichard Croke appears as the most conspicuous and indefatigable, were accordingly despatched on the proposed&nbsp;errand. The means to which they had recourse in order&nbsp;to obtain opinions such as their royal employer desired&nbsp;are plainly described by a contemporary writer, who says&nbsp;that “ there was inestimable sums of money given to the&nbsp;famous clerks to choke them, and in especial to such as&nbsp;had the governance and custody of their universities’&nbsp;seals.”@@<sup>1</sup> The evidence more recently brought to light&nbsp;enables us to accept this statement as substantially correct.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>The unpopularity of the divorce among the nation at large&nbsp;was especially shown at the two universities, where the&nbsp;junior members made demonstrations of the greatest dissatisfaction, while their seniors were mostly bribed or intimidated into acquiescence by the royal agents ; nor could&nbsp;the authorities at either Oxford or Cambridge disguise&nbsp;the fact that they found themselves at variance with the&nbsp;feeling of the country at large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It is at this juncture that Cranmer assumes a foremost C place as a leader of the English Beformation. He had&nbsp;written in defence of the divorce, and had taken a part&nbsp;in embassies sent by Henry to treat on the question with&nbsp;the emperor and the pope; and Clement had shown his&nbsp;sense of the value of his influence by appointing him to&nbsp;the lucrative post of grand penitentiary for England, in&nbsp;the hope of winning him over to the papal interests.&nbsp;Cranmer’s whole policy, however, had been directly opposed&nbsp;to that of Wolsey. He had used his best efforts to confirm the commercial relations with the Netherlands, and&nbsp;had superintended the negotiation of a commercial treaty&nbsp;between that country and England. He had resided for&nbsp;some months in Germany, and while there had married&nbsp;Margaret, the daughter of Andrew Osiander, a distinguished preacher and leader of the Lutheran party at&nbsp;Nuremberg. From Germany he was now summoned back&nbsp;to England to become the successor of Warham, the primate, who had died in August 1532. As there had as&nbsp;yet been no formal rupture with the see of Borne, it became&nbsp;necessary for him to apply to Clement for the customary&nbsp;bull of consecration, and also for his pallium as metro-</span></p>
