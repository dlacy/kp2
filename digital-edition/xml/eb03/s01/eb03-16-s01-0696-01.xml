in its primary ſenſe, denoted a theatre, or the place where dramatic pieces and other public (Hows were exhibited; for it does not appear that the ancient poets were at all acquainted with the modern way of changing the ſcenes in the different parts of the play, in order to raiſe the idea of the perſons repreſented by the actors being in different places.</p><p>The original ſcene for acting of plays was as ſimple as the representations themſelves; it conſiſted only of a plain plot of ground proper for the occaſion, which was in ſome degree ſhaded by the neighbouring trees, whole branches were made to meet together, and their vacancies ſupplied with boards, ſticks, and the like; and to complete the ſhelter, theſe were ſometimes covered with ſkins, and ſometimes with only the branches of other trees newly cut down, and full of leaves. Afterwards more artificial ſcenes, or ſcenical repreſentations, were introduced, and paintings uſed inſtead of the objects themſelves. Scenes were then of three forts; tragic, comic, and ſatyric. The tragic ſcene repreſented ſtately magnificent edifices, with decorations of pillars, ſtatues, and other things ſuitable to the palaces of kings: the comic exhibited private houſes with balconies and windows, in imitation of common buildings: and the ſatyric was the repreſentation of groves, mountains, dens, and other rural appearances; and theſe decorations either turned on pivots, or ſlid along grooves, as thoſe in our theatres.</p><p>To keep cloſe to nature and probability, the ſcene ſhould never be ſhiſted from place to place in the courſe of the play: the ancients were pretty ſevere in this reſpect, particularly Terence, in ſome of whoſe plays the ſcene never ſhifts at all, but the whole is tranſacted at the door of ſome old man’s houſe, whither with inimitable art he occaſionally brings the actors. The French are pretty ſtrict with reſpect to this rule; but the Engliſh pay very little regard to it.</p><p>Scene is alſo a part or diviſion of a dramatic poem. Thus plays are divided into acts, and acts are again ſubdivided into ſcenes; in which ſenſe the ſcene is properly the perſons preſent at or concerned in the action on the ſtage at ſuch a time: wſhenever, therefore, a new actor appears, or an old one diſappears, the action is changed into other hands; and therefore a new ſcene then commences.</p><p>It is one of the laws of the ſtage, that the ſcenes be well connected; that is, that one ſucceed another in ſuch a manner as that the ſtage be never quite empty till the end of the act.
