<p><span class="font4">RECURVIROSTRA, in ornithology ; a genus belonging to the order of grallæ of Linnaeus, and that of palmipedes of Pennant and Latham. The bill is&nbsp;long, ſubulated, bent back, ſharp and flexible at the&nbsp;point. The feet are webbed, and furniſhed with three&nbsp;toes forwards, and a ſhort one behind. Mr Latham&nbsp;notes of this genus three fpecies, viz. the Avofetta, or&nbsp;the one commonly known, the Americana, and the&nbsp;Alba. This laſt, it is probable, has ſome affinity to the -Americana. The recurviroſtra avoſetta is about the ſize&nbsp;of a lapwing in body, but has very long legs. The&nbsp;fubſtance of the bill is foft, and almoſt membranous at&nbsp;its tip ; it is thin, weak, ſlender, compreffed horizontally, and incapable of defence or effort. Thefe birds are&nbsp;variegated with black and white, and during the win-ter are frequent on the eaſtern ſhores of Great Britain.&nbsp;They viſit alſo the Severn, and ſometimes the pools of&nbsp;Shropſhire. They feed on worms and infects, which&nbsp;they ſcoop out of the fand with their bills. They lay&nbsp;two eggs, white, with a greeniſh hue, and large ſpots&nbsp;of black ; theſe eggs are about the ſize of a pigeon’s.—&nbsp;They are found alſo in various parts of the continent&nbsp;of Europe, in Ruſſia, Denmark, and Sweden, but they&nbsp;are not numerous. They are alſo found in Siberia, but&nbsp;oftener about the ſalt lakes of the Tartarian deſert, and&nbsp;about<sup>r</sup> the Caſpian ſea. They are found likewiſe on&nbsp;the coaſts of Picardy in France in April and November, and at orleans, but rarely. In breeding-time they&nbsp;are very plentiful on the coaſts of Bas Poictou. They&nbsp;do not appear to wander farther ſouth in Europe than</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Italy, whether from timidity or addreſs, the avoſet ſhuns ſnares, and is not eaſily taken. The American&nbsp;avoſet is rather larger and longer than the laſt. The&nbsp;bill is ſimilar, and its colour black : the forehead is&nbsp;duſky white : the head, neck, and upper part of the&nbsp;breaſt, arc of a deep cream-colour : the lower parts of&nbsp;the neck behind white : the back is black, and the uιf-der parts from the breaſt pure white : the wings are&nbsp;partly black, partly white, and partly aſh-coloured.&nbsp;Theſe birds inhabit North America, and were found by&nbsp;Dampier in Shark’s Bay, on the coaſt of New Holland. See Plate CCCCXXXV.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Tlie recurviroſtra, or ſcolopax alba, is about 14 inches and a quarter long, its colour white, the inferior coverts&nbsp;of its wings duſkiſh, its bill orange, its legs brown. Edwards remarks, that the bill of this bird is bent upwards, as in the avoſet ; its bill black at the tip, and&nbsp;orange the reſt of its length ; all the plumage is white,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
