<p><span class="font0">Rochester is the author of both these imperishable descriptions of Charles IL, and by them and his poem “ Upon Nothing,” and his death-bed conversation with Bishop&nbsp;Burnet he is now chiefly known. His poetry has hardly&nbsp;had a fair chance against that of his contemporaries, for&nbsp;owing to his scandalous character, which was probably&nbsp;worse than the time only in respect of his ostentatious&nbsp;defiance of proprieties, all kinds of indecencies were&nbsp;fathered upon him and inserted in unauthorized editions&nbsp;of his works. This has ensured his exclusion from decent&nbsp;libraries, an edition issued in 1691 by friends careful of&nbsp;his memory having been pushed out of sight by these&nbsp;more piquant publications. His letters to his wife and&nbsp;his son show that the real man was much better than the&nbsp;public estimate of him, which he invited by his occasional&nbsp;daring breaches of decorum and morality. Some of his&nbsp;lyrics are very pretty, full of ingenious fancy and musical&nbsp;rhythm, but wit and intellect are more marked in his&nbsp;writing than the free flow of lyrical sentiment. For wit,&nbsp;versatility, and intense vitality of intellect this strangely&nbsp;wasted life stood high above the level of its age. In his&nbsp;youth Rochester distinguished himself in the Dutch wars&nbsp;by acts of signal personal bravery ; his alleged cowardice&nbsp;afterwards in street brawls and personal quarrels looks&nbsp;rather like daringly contemptuous cynicism. Rochester&nbsp;had a taste for the humours of low life, and is said to&nbsp;have haunted the low quarters of the town in various&nbsp;disguises, on one occasion personating a mountebank on&nbsp;Tower Hill. He died on 26th July 1680, at the early&nbsp;age of thirty-three, and the common account is that his&nbsp;constitution was undermined and exhausted by profligate&nbsp;excesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCHE-SUR-YON, La, a town of France, the chief town of the department of La Vendée, lies 278 miles southwest of Paris by the railway to Sables d’Olonne, on an&nbsp;eminence 164 feet above the sea on the right bank of the&nbsp;Yon, a little tributary of the Lay, itself an affluent of the&nbsp;Pertuis Breton. In 1881 the population of the town was&nbsp;9965, of the commune 10,634. The castle of La Roche-sur-Yon, which probably existed before the time of the&nbsp;crusades, and which was frequently attacked or taken in&nbsp;the Hundred Years’ War and in the wars of religion, was&nbsp;finally dismantled under Louis XIII. ; and when Napoleon&nbsp;in 1805 made this place the chief town of a department&nbsp;the stones from its ruins were employed in the erection of&nbsp;the administrative buildings, which, being all produced at&nbsp;once after a regular plan, have a monotonous effect. The&nbsp;equestrian statue of Napoleon I. in an immense square overlooking the rest of the town ; the statue of General Travot,&nbsp;who was engaged in the “ pacification ” of La Vendée ; the&nbsp;museum, with several paintings by P. Baudry, a living&nbsp;native artist of note, are the only objects of interest. The&nbsp;dog fairs of Roche-sur-Yon are important. Napoleon-Vendée and Bourbon-Vendée, the names borne by the town&nbsp;according to the dominance of either dynasty, gave place to&nbsp;the original unpolitical name after the revolution of 1870.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROCKFORD, a city of the United States, the county seat of Winnebago county, Illinois, on both banks of the&nbsp;Rock river, which, rising in Wisconsin, falls into the Mississippi after a course of 350 miles. By rail it lies 92&nbsp;miles north-west of Chicago and is a junction of the&nbsp;Chicago and North-Western, the Chicago, Milwaukee, and&nbsp;St Paul, and the Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroads. Abundant water-power was secured by a dam 800&nbsp;feet long constructed across the river in 1844. The chief&nbsp;objects of industry of Rockford, one of the largest manufacturing centres in the Mississippi valley, are agricultural&nbsp;implements, furniture, watches, silver-plated ware, cutlery,&nbsp;tacks and nails, bolts, wire-cloth, netting, woollen and cotton&nbsp;goods, paper, flour, oatmeal, glucose. Waterworks on the&nbsp;Holly system (1874) are capable of pumping 5,500,000&nbsp;gallons through the mains in twenty-four hours. The city&nbsp;stands in a fine agricultural district, is handsomely built&nbsp;and well shaded, and has a public library, a public high&nbsp;school, and ten other public school buildings, a seminary&nbsp;for girls (1849), five banks, and twenty-one churches. The&nbsp;population was 6976 in 1860, 11,049 in 1870, and 13,129&nbsp;in 1880 (township, 14,525). Rockford was settled about&nbsp;1836 ; in 1852 it received incorporation as a city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCKHAMPTON, a town of Queensland, is situated some 40 miles up the Fitzroy river, nearly on the Tropic of&nbsp;Capricorn. The streets are well formed and kept, bordered&nbsp;by trees, with ever-flowing water down the channels. Embosomed in hills, it has a climate, in spite of heat, of&nbsp;singular salubrity, the death-rate being only about half&nbsp;that of London. The population in 1884 -was about&nbsp;11,000. Rockhampton is the gateway to a fine pastoral&nbsp;interior and is a port of export for wool. The hills in&nbsp;its neighbourhood are rich in metallic wealth ; and Mount&nbsp;Morgan, 30 miles from Rockhampton, seems likely to&nbsp;eclipse the production of Victoria and New South Wales.&nbsp;If anything be needed to complete the prospective importance of Rockhampton, it is the growing development&nbsp;of sugar plantations at no great distance from the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCKINGHAM, Charles Watson Wentworth, second Marquis of (1730-1782), twice prime minister of&nbsp;England, was the only son of Thomas Watson Wentworth,&nbsp;whose father had inherited the great Wentworth estates in&nbsp;Yorkshire on the death of William Wentworth, fourth earl&nbsp;of Strafford, and who had himself succeeded his second&nbsp;cousin as sixth Lord Rockingham in 1746 and been created&nbsp;marquis of Rockingham in the same year. Charles Watson&nbsp;Wentworth was born in 1730 on the 19th of March (Albemarle), or the 13th of May (Collins), and was educated at&nbsp;Eton. He showed his spirit as a boy by riding across&nbsp;from Wentworth to Carlisle in 1745 with but one servant,&nbsp;to join the duke of Cumberland in his pursuit of the Young&nbsp;Pretender. He was created earl of Malton in the peerage&nbsp;of Ireland on 4th September 1750, and succeeded his&nbsp;father as second marquis of Rockingham on 14th December&nbsp;in the same year. In 1751 he became lord-lieutenant of&nbsp;the North and West Ridings of Yorkshire and a lord of&nbsp;the bedchamber, and in 1760 was made a knight of the&nbsp;Garter. After George III. had begun his policy of dividing the great Whig families, those Whig noblemen and&nbsp;gentlemen who did not choose to join the sections headed&nbsp;by the Grenvilles, the duke of Bedford, or any other great&nbsp;nobleman, selected as their chief the young marquis of&nbsp;Rockingham. In May 1762 the king’s favourite, the earl&nbsp;of Bute, became first lord of the treasury, and the marquis&nbsp;of Rockingham was amongst those who in the following&nbsp;year were dismissed from their lord-lieutenancies. The&nbsp;opposition now grew so strong that Lord Bute resigned&nbsp;in April 1763 and the king, true to his policy, appointed&nbsp;George Grenville to be his successor. But Grenville’s&nbsp;section of the Whig party was not strong enough to maintain him in power long, and on 12th July 1765 Lord&nbsp;Rockingham formed his first administration with General&nbsp;Conway and the duke of Grafton as secretaries of state.&nbsp;The cabinet seemed stronger than it really was, for it was&nbsp;divided by intestine quarrels, and the earl of Chatham&nbsp;refused to have anything to do with it. Nevertheless&nbsp;Rockingham recovered his lord-lieutenancies and won&nbsp;reputation as a good administrator. In May 1766 the&nbsp;duke of Grafton, a far abler man than Rockingham, though&nbsp;neither so conciliatory in his manners nor so generally&nbsp;popular, seceded from the Government, and in August</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
