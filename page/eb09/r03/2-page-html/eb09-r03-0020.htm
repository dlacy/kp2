                leave the cause in the hands of the magistrate from beginning to end. This course
                was adopted sometimes&nbsp;because the claim that was being made rested rather on
                moral than&nbsp;on legal right, and sometimes in order to avoid unnecessary
                disclosure of family misunderstandings. Thus, the earliest questions&nbsp;that were
                raised about testamentary trusts were sent for consideration and disposal to the
                consuls, apparently because, in the existing&nbsp;state of jurisprudence, it was
                thought incompetent for a beneficiary&nbsp;to maintain in reference to the heir (who
                had only been </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"

                the&nbsp;supreme power with which they were invested. This manifested&nbsp;itself
                principally in the form of (1) interdicts ; (2) praetorian stipulations; (3)

                style="font-style:italic;">jus praetorium.</span><span class="font1"> The
                characteristic of the procedure by interdict was this,—that in it the&nbsp;praetor
                reversed the ordinary course of things, and, instead of waiting for an inquiry into
                the facts alleged by a complainer, provisionally assumed them to be true and
                pronounced an order upon the&nbsp;respondent, which he was bound either to obey or
                show to be&nbsp;unjustified. The order pronounced might be either
                restitutory,&nbsp;exhibitory (in both cases usually spoken of in the texts as a
                decree),&nbsp;or prohibitory:—restitutory, when, for example, the respondent
                was&nbsp;ordained to restore something he was alleged to have taken possession of by
                violent means, to remove impediments he had placed&nbsp;in the channel of a river,
                and so on ; exhibitory, when he was&nbsp;ordained to produce something he was
                unwarrantably detaining,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> the body of a freeman he was holding as his slave,
                or a will&nbsp;in which the complainer alleged that he had an interest; prohibitory,
                as, for example, that he should not disturb the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">status quo</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;possession
                as between the complainer and himself, that he should&nbsp;not interfere with a
                highway, a watercourse, the access to a&nbsp;sepulchre, and so forth. If the
                respondent obeyed the order pronounced in a restitutory or exhibitory decree, there
                was an end of&nbsp;the matter. But frequently, and perhaps more often than not,
                the&nbsp;interdict was only the commencement of a litigation, facilitated
                by&nbsp;sponsions and restipulations, in which the questions had to be
                tried&nbsp;(1) whether the interdict or injunction was justified, (2)
                -whether&nbsp;there had been breach of it, and, (3) if so, what damages were due
                in&nbsp;consequence. The procedure therefore was often anything
                but&nbsp;summary.</span></p>

                litigation&nbsp;about ownership, and for the purpose of deciding which of
                the&nbsp;parties, as possessor, was to have the advantage of standing on&nbsp;the

            </span><span class="font1">That they were so used in&nbsp;his time, as in that of
                Justinian, cannot be doubted. But it is&nbsp;amazing that they should have been, for

                class="font1"> did&nbsp;to movables. Both parties being present, the prsetor
                addressed&nbsp;them to this effect: “I forbid that one of you two who does
                not&nbsp;possess the house in question to use force in order to prevent
                the&nbsp;other who is in possession, provided he is so neither by clandestine or
                violent exclusion of the first, nor in virtue of a grant from&nbsp;him during
                pleasure, from continuing to possess as at present.”&nbsp;It is manifest that this
                decided nothing; it was no more than a prohibition of disturbance of the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">status quo</span><span
                class="font1"> ; it left the question entirely&nbsp;open which of the parties it was
                that was in possession, and which&nbsp;that was forbidden to interfere. The manner
                of its explication was&nbsp;somewhat singular. Each of the parties was bound at once
                to&nbsp;commit what in the case of one of them must have been a breach of&nbsp;the
                interdict, by a pretence of violence offered to the other </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">(vis ex&nbsp;conventu)@@<sup>5</sup></span><span
                class="font1"> each of them was thus in a position to say to the other&nbsp;—“We
                have both used force ; but it was you alone that did it in&nbsp;defiance of the
                interdict, for it is I that am in possession. ” The&nbsp;interim enjoyment of the
                fruits was then awarded to the highest&nbsp;bidder, who gave his stipulatory promise
                to pay for them to his&nbsp;adversary in the event of the latter being successful in
                the long&nbsp;run; penal sponsions and restipulations were exchanged upon
                the&nbsp;question which of them had committed a breach of the interdict;&nbsp;and on

                a secondary&nbsp;interdict, required to abstain from disturbing the other “in all
                time&nbsp;coming.” Whatever we may think of the action system of the&nbsp;Romans in
                the period of the classical jurisprudence, one cannot&nbsp;help standing aghast at a
                procedure so cumbrous and complex as&nbsp;that of their possessory
                interdicts.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A praetorian stipulation@@<sup>6 </sup>was a
                stipulatory engagement imposed upon a man by a magistrate or judge, in order to
                secure a&nbsp;third party from the chance of loss or prejudice through some
                act&nbsp;or omission either of him from whom the engagement was exacted&nbsp;or of
                some other person for whom he was responsible. Although&nbsp;called praetorian,
                because the cases in which such stipulations&nbsp;were exigible were set forth in
                the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edict,</span><span
                class="font1"> there can be no question&nbsp;that they originated in the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span
                class="font1">; in fact they were just a&nbsp;means of assuring to a man in advance
                the benefit of an action of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> whereby he might
                obtain reparation for any injury&nbsp;suffered by him through the occurrence of the
                act or omission&nbsp;contemplated as possible. Ulpian classifies them as
                cautionary&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(cauti
                anales),</span><span class="font1"> judicial, and common. The first were purely
                precautionary, and quite independent of any action already in dependence between the
                party moving the magistrate to exact the stipulation and him on whom it was desired
                to impose it. There were&nbsp;many varieties of them, connected with all branches of
                the law,—&nbsp;for example, the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">cautio damni infecti,</span><span class="font1"> security
                against damage to&nbsp;a man’s property in consequence, say, of the ruinous
                condition of his&nbsp;neighbour’s house, the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">cautio usufructuaria</span><span class="font1"> that
                property usufructed&nbsp;should revert unimpaired to the owner on the expiry of the
                usufructuary’s life interest, the sedilian stipulation against faults in
                a&nbsp;thing sold, and so forth. In all these cases the stipulation
                or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cautio</span><span
                class="font1"> was a guarantee against future loss or injury, usually corroborated
                by sureties, and made effectual by an action on the stipulation in the event of loss
                or injury resulting. J udicial stipulations,&nbsp;according to Ulpian’s
                classification, were those imposed by a judge&nbsp;in the course of and with
                reference to an action in dependence before&nbsp;him, as, for example, the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cautio judicatum
                solvi</span><span class="font1"> (that the defendant&nbsp;would satisfy the

                be fraudulently impaired in the meantime),&nbsp;and many others. Common were such as
                might either be imposed&nbsp;by a magistrate apart from any depending action or by a
                judge&nbsp;in the course of one, such as that taken from a guardian for
                the&nbsp;faithful administration of his office, or from a procurator that
                his&nbsp;principal would ratify what he did.</span></p>
