<p><span class="font1">In order, however, to obtain a direct proof of the genetic relation between uranium and radium, it is necessary to show that&nbsp;radium appears after some time in a uranium compound from&nbsp;which all trace of radium has been initially removed. It can&nbsp;readily be calculated that the growth of radium should be easily&nbsp;observed by the emanation method in the course of one week,&nbsp;using a kilogram of uranium nitrate.. Experiments of this kind&nbsp;were first made by Soddy (37), but initially no definite evidence&nbsp;was obtained that radium grew in the solution at all. The rate&nbsp;of production of radium, if it took place at all, was certainly&nbsp;less than 1/10, 000th part of the amount to be expected if uranium&nbsp;were transformed directly into radium. It thus appeared&nbsp;probable that one or more products of slow period of trans-formation existed between uranium and radium. Since uranium&nbsp;must be transformed through these intermediate stages before&nbsp;radium appears, it is evident that the initial rate of production&nbsp;of radium under these conditions might be extremely small.&nbsp;This conclusion has been confirmed by Soddy, who has shown&nbsp;that radium does appear in the solution which has been placed&nbsp;aside for several years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the direct parent of radium must be present in radio-active minerals, one of the constituents separated from the mineral must grow radium. This was shown to be the case by&nbsp;Boltwood (38), who found that actinium preparations produced&nbsp;radium at a fairly rapid rate. By the work of Rutherford and&nbsp;Boltwood, it was found that the growth of radium was not due&nbsp;to actinium itself, but to a new substance separated in some&nbsp;cases with the actinium. This new substance, which emits&nbsp;α rays, was separated by Boltwood (38), and called by him&nbsp;“ Ionium. ” It has chemical properties very similar to thorium.&nbsp;Soddy has shown that the period of ionium is probably not&nbsp;less than 20, 000 years, indicating that ionium must exist in&nbsp;uranium minerals in not less than ten times the quantity of&nbsp;radium. It has not yet been directly shown that uranium&nbsp;produces ionium, but there can be no doubt that it does do so.&nbsp;Since ionium produces radium, Boltwood (38) has determined&nbsp;by direct experiment that radium is half transformed in 2000&nbsp;years—a number in good agreement with other data on that&nbsp;subject. The constant relation between uranium and radium&nbsp;will only hold for old minerals where there has been no opportunity for chemical alteration or removal of its constituents&nbsp;by the action of percolating water or other agencies. It is&nbsp;quite possible that altered minerals of no great age will not&nbsp;show this constant relation. It seems probable that this is&nbsp;the explanation of some results of Mlle Gleditsch, where the&nbsp;relation between uranium and radium has been found not to&nbsp;be constant for some mineral specimens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Connexion of the Radioelements. —</span><span class="font1">We have already seen that a number of slowly transforming radioactive substances, viz.&nbsp;polonium (radium F), radiolead (radium D) and ionium are&nbsp;linked up to the uranium-radium series of transformations.&nbsp;Boltwood (39) has made a systematic examination of the&nbsp;relative activity in the form of very thin films due to each&nbsp;of the products present in the uranium-radium family. The&nbsp;results are shown in the following table, where the activity of&nbsp;pure uranium itself is taken as unity: —</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Taking into account the differences in the ionization due to an α particle from the various products, the results indicate&nbsp;that uranium expels two α particles for one from each of the&nbsp;other α ray products in the series of transformations. This&nbsp;indicates either that two particles are expelled during the&nbsp;transformation of the atom of uranium, or that another α ray&nbsp;product is present which has so far not been separated from the&nbsp;uranium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although thorium is nearly always present in old uranium minerals and uranium in thorium minerals, there does not&nbsp;appear to be any radioactive connexion between these two&nbsp;elements. Uranium and thorium are to he regarded as two&nbsp;distinct radioactive elements. With regard to actinium, there&nbsp;is still no definite information of its place in the scheme of&nbsp;transformations. Boltwood has shown that the amount of&nbsp;actinium in uranium minerals is proportional to the content&nbsp;of uranium. This indicates that actinium, like radium, is&nbsp;in genetic connexion with uranium. On the other hand, the&nbsp;activity of actinium with its series of α ray products is less than&nbsp;that of radium itself or uranium. In order to explain this&nbsp;anomaly, Rutherford has suggested that at a certain stage of&nbsp;disintegration of the uranium-radium series, the disintegration&nbsp;is complex, and two distinct kinds of matter appear, one in&nbsp;much larger quantity than the other. On this view, the smaller&nbsp;fraction is actinium, so that the latter is a branch descendant&nbsp;of the main uranium-radium series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">End Products of Transformation. —</span><span class="font1">It is now definitely established that the α particle expelled from any type of radioactive matter is an atom of helium, so that helium is a necessary accom-paniment of radioactive changes involving the expulsion of&nbsp;α particles. - After the radioactive transformations have come&nbsp;to an end, each of the elements uranium and thorium and&nbsp;actinium should give rise to an end or final product, which&nbsp;may be either a known element or some unknown element of&nbsp;very slow period of transformation. Supposing, as seems&nbsp;probable, that the expulsion of an α particle lowers the atomic&nbsp;weight of an element by four units—the atomic weight of&nbsp;helium—the atomic weights of each of the products in the&nbsp;uranium and radium series can be simply calculated. Since&nbsp;uranium expels two α particles, the atomic weight of the next&nbsp;ray product, ionium, is 238‧5-8 or 230‧5. The atomic weight&nbsp;of radium comes out to be 266‧5, a number in good agreement&nbsp;with the experimental value. Similarly the atomic weight of&nbsp;polonium is 210‧5, and that of the final product after the trans-formation of polonium should be 206‧5. This value is very&nbsp;close to the atomic weight of lead, and indicates that this sub-stance is the final product of the transformation of radium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This suggestion was first put forward by Boltwood (40), who has collected a large amount of evidence bearing on this subject.&nbsp;Since in old minerals the transformations have been in progress&nbsp;for periods of time, in some cases measured by hundreds of&nbsp;millions of years, it is obvious that the end product, if a stable&nbsp;element, should be an invariable companion of the radioelement&nbsp;and be present in considerable quantity. Boltwood has shown&nbsp;that lead always occurs in radioactive minerals, and in many&nbsp;cases in amount about that to be expected from their uranium&nbsp;content and age. It is difficult to settle definitely this very&nbsp;important problem until it can be experimentally shown that&nbsp;radium is transformed into lead, or, what should prove simpler&nbsp;in practice, that polonium changes into helium and lead. Unfortunately for a solution of this problem within a reasonable&nbsp;time, a very large quantity of polonium would be necessary.&nbsp;Mme. Curie and Debierne have obtained a very active pre-paration of polonium containing about ⅒th milligram of pure&nbsp;polonium. Rutherford and Boltwood and Curie and Debierne&nbsp;have both independently shown that polonium produces helium&nbsp;—a result to be expected, since it emits α particles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Production of Helium. —</span><span class="font1">In 1902 Rutherford and Soddy sug-gested that the helium which is invariably found in radioactive minerals was derived from the disintegration of radioactive&nbsp;matter. In 1903 Ramsay and Soddy definitely showed that&nbsp;helium was produced by radium and also by its emanation.&nbsp;From the observed mass of the α particle, it seemed probable&nbsp;from the first that the a particle was an atom of helium.&nbsp;This conclusion was confirmed by the work of Rutherford and&nbsp;Geiger (41), who showed that the α particle was an atom of&nbsp;helium carrying two unit charges of electricity. In order to&nbsp;prove definitely this relation, it was necessary to show that the&nbsp;α particles, quite independently of the active matter from&nbsp;which they were expelled, gave rise to helium. This was done&nbsp;by Rutherford and Royds (42), who allowed the α particles&nbsp;from a large quantity of emanation to be fired through the</span></p>
