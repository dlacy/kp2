<p><label>RETINUE</label>
(O. Fr. <hi rend="italic">retenue,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">retenir,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">retenere,</hi> hold back, retain), a body of persons “ retained ” in the service of a noble or royal personage, a suite of “ retainers.” Such retainers were not in the domestic service of their lord, but were his “ livery ” and claimed his protection. They were a source of trouble and abuse in the 15th and early 16th century (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Livery</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Maintenance).</hi></p>
