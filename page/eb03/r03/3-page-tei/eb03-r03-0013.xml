Two hay bands twiſted together would be called a<hi rend="italic">rope.</hi>  All the different kinds of this manufacture, from a ſiſhing-line or whip cord to the cable of a firſt rate ſhip of war, go by the general name of Cordage.</p><p>Ropes are made of every ſubſtance that is ſuſſiciently fibrous, flexible, and tenacious, but chiefly of the barks of plants. The Chineſe and other orientals even make them of the ligneous parts of ſeveral plants, ſuch as certain bamboos and reeds,<hi rend="sub">x</hi> the Items oſ the aloes, the fibrous covering of the cocoa nut, the filaments of the cotton pod, and the leaves of ſome graſſes, ſuch as the ſparte<hi rend="italic">(Lygeum,</hi>  Linn.) The aide <hi rend="italic">(Agave,</hi>  Linn.) and the ſparte exceed all others in ſtrength. But the barks of plants are the moſt productive oſ fibrous matter fit for this manufacture. Thoſe of the Linden tree. <hi rend="italic">(Teloa),dl</hi>  the willow, the bramble, the nettle, are frequently uſed : but hemp and flax are of all others the beſt ; and of theſe the hemp is preferred, and employed in all cordage exceeding the lize of a line, and even in many of this denomination.</p><p>Hemp is very various in its uſeſul qualities. Theſe are great ſtrength, and the length and ſineneſs oſ the fibre. Being a plant oſ very greedy growth, it ſucks up much of the unaltered juices of the foil, and therefore difi⅛rs greatly according to its toil, cljmate, and culture. The beſt in Europe comes to us through Riga, to which port it is brought from very diſtant places to the fouthw∙ard. It is known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Riga rein</hi>  (that is, clean) hemp. Its fibre is not the longeſt (at leaſt in the dreſſed ſtate in which we get it) of all others, but it is the ſineſt, moſt flexible, and ſtrongeſt. The next to this is ſuppoſed to be the Pe-terſhurgh braak hemp. Other hemps are eſteemed nearly in the following * der :—Riga outſhot, Peterſ-burgh outſhot, hemp from Koningſhurgh, Archangel, Sweden, Memel. <hi rend="italic">Chucking</hi>  is a name given to a hemp that comes from various places, long in the fibre, but coarſe and harſh, and its ſtrength is inferior to hemps which one would think weaker. Its texture is ſuch, that it does not admit ſplitting with the hatchet ſo as to be more completely dreſſed. It is therefore kept in its coarſe form, and uſed for inferior cordage. It is however a good and ſtrong hemp, but wall not make fine work. There are doubtleſs many good hemps in the ſouthern parts of Europe, but little of them is brought to our market. Codilla, half clean, &amp;c. are portions of the above-mentioned hemps, ſeparated by the dreffiπg, and may be conſidered as broken fibres oſ thoſe hemps.</p><p>Only the firſt qualities are manufactured for the rigging of the royal navy and for the flιips of the Eaſt India company.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rop5-.∙.!Λ~ing is an art of very great importance; and there are few that better deſerve the attention of the intelligent obſerver. Hardly any art can be carried on without the aſſiſtance oſ the rope-maker. Cordage makes the very ſinevvs and muſcles of a ſhip; and</hi><hi rend="sup">, </hi>every improvement which can be made in its prépara-' tiυn, either in reſpect to ſtrength or pliablenefs, muſt be of immenſe ſervice to the mariner, and t√ the commerce and the defence of nations.</p><p>We ſhall give a very ſhort account of the manufacture, which will not indeed fully inſtruct the artificers, but will give ſuch a view of the proceſs as ſhall enable the reader to judge, from principle, of the propriety of the different parts of the manipulation, and perceive its defects, and the means ſor removing them.</p><p>The aim oſ the rope-maker is to unite the ſtrength of a great number oſ fibres. This would be done in the completed manner by<hi rend="sup">r</hi> laying the fibres parallel to J each other, and faltening the bundle at the two ends : <hi rend="sub">1 </hi>but this would be of very limited uſe, becauſe the fibres are ſhort, not exceeding three feet and a half at an average. They muſt therefore be entangled together, in ſuch a manner that the ſtrength of a fibre ſhall not be able to draw<hi rend="sup">r</hi> it out from among the reſt of the bundle. This is done by twilling or twining them together, which cauſes them mutually to compreſs each other. When the fibres are ſo diſpoſed in a long , ſkain, that their ends ſucceed each - other along its length, without many of them meeting in one place, and this ſkain is twiſted round and round, we may cauſe them to compreſs each other to any degree we pleaſe, and the friction on a fibre which we attempt to pull out may be more than its coheſion can overcome. It will therefore break. Conſequently, if we pull at this twiſted ſkain, we will not ſeparate it by drawing one parcel out from among thereſt, but the whole fibres will break ; and if the diſtribution of the fibres has been very equable, the fi&lt;ain will be nearly of the ſame ſtrength in every part. If there is .any part where many ends of fibres meet, the ſkain will break</p><p>in that part.</p><p>We know very well that w-e can twiſt a ſkain of fibres ſo very hard, that it will break with any attempt to twiſt it harder. In this ſtate all the fibres are already ſtrained to the utmoſt of their ſtrength. Such a ſkain of fibre· can have no ſtrength. It cannot carry a weight, becauſe each fibre is already ſtrained in the ſame manner as if loaded with as much weight as it is able to bear. What we have ſaid of this extreme caſe is true in a certain extent of every degree of twiſt that we give the fibres. Whatever force is actually exerted by a twuſted fibre, in order that it may ſuſſiciently compreſs the reſt to hinder them from being drawn out, muſt be conſidered as a weight hanging on that fibre, and muſt be deduced from its abſolute ſtrength of coheſion, before we can eſtimate the ſtrength of the ſkain. The ſtrength of the ſkain is the remainder of the abſolute ſtrength of the fibres, after we have deduced the force employed in twuſting them together.</p><p>From this obſervation may be deduced a fundamental principle in rope-making, that all twiſting, beyond what is neceſſary ſor preventing the fibres from being drawm out without breaking, diminiſhes the ſtrength of the cordage, and ſhould be avoided when in our power. It is of importance to keep this in mind.</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
