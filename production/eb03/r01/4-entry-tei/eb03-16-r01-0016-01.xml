<p><label>RAVILLIAC</label>
(Francis), the infamous aſſaſſin of .Henry IV. of France, was a native of Angouleſme, and at the time of his execution was about one or two and thirty years of age. See France, n <hi rend="sup">0</hi> 146, and Henry IV. of France. Ravilliac was the ſon of pa-rents who lived upon alms. His father was that ſovt of inferior retainer to .the law, to which the vulgar give the name of a <hi rend="italic">pettifogger,</hi> and his fon had been bred up in the ſame way. Ravilliac had ſet up a claim to an eſtate, but the cauſe went againſt him : this diſappointment affected his mind deeply : he afterwards taught a fchool, and, as himſelf ſaid, received chari-table gifts, though but of a very ſmall value, from the parents of thoſe whom he taught ; and yet his diſtreſs was ſo great, that he had much ado to live, when he was ſeized for the king’s murder, he was very looſely guarded ; all were permitted to ſpeak with him who pleaſed ; arid it was thought very remarkable that a Jeſuit ſhould ſay to him, " Friend, take care, whatever you do, that you don’t charge honeſt people.” He was removed next day from the houſe of Efpernûn to the Conciergerie, the proper priſon of the parliament of. Paris. ΛVhen he was firſt interrogated, he anſwered with great boldneſs, " That he had done it, and would do it, if it were to do again.” when he was told that the king, though dangerouſly wounded, was living, and might recover, he ſaid that he had ſtruck him home, and that he was ſure he was dead. In his ſubſequent examinations he owned that he had long had an intention to kill the king, becauſe he ſuf-fered two religions in his kingdom ; and that he endeavoured to obtain an audience of him, that he might admoniſh him. He alſo ſaid that he underſtood the king’s great armament to be againſt the pope, and that, in his opinion, to make war againſt the pope, was to make war againſt God. WC have no diſtinct account of the three laſt examinations ; but he is ſaid to have perfiſted,</p><p>in the moſt ſolemn aſſeverations, that he had no accomplices, and that nobody had perſuaded him to the fact. He appeared ſurpriſed at nothing ſo much as at the univerſal abhorrence of the people, which, it ſeems, he did not expect. They were forced to guard him ſtrictly from his fellow-priſoners, who would otherwiſe have murdered him. The butchers of Paris deſired to have him put into their hands, affirming that they would flay him alive, and that he ſhould ſtill live 12 days, when he was put to the torture, he broke out into horrid execrations, and always inſiſted that he did the fact from his own motive, and that he could accuſe nobody. Οη the day of his execution, after he had made the <hi rend="italic">amende honourable</hi> before the church of Notre Dame, he was carried to the Greve; and, being brought upon a ſcaffold, was tied to a wooden engine in the ſhape of a St Andrew’s crofs. The knife with which he did the murder being faſtened in his right hand, it was firſt burnt in a flow fire ; then the ſſeſhy parts of his body were torn with red-hot pincers, and melted lead, oil, pitch, and roſin, poured into the wounds,</p><p>and through a clay funnel into his bowels by the navel. The people refuſed to pray for hirn ; and when, according to the ſentence pronounced upon him, he came to be dragged to pieces by four horfes, one of thoſe that were brought appearing to be but weak, one of the ſpectators offered his own, with which the criminal was much moved : he is ſaid to have then made a con-feſſion, which was ſo written by the greffier Voifιn, that not ſo much as one word of it could ever be read. He was very earneſt for abſolution, which his confeſſor refufed, unleſs he would reveal his accomplices ; " Give it me conditionally (ſaid he) ; upon condition that I have told the truth,” which they did. His body was ſo robuſt, that it reſiſted the force of the horſes ; and the executioner was at length obliged to cut him into quarters, which the people dragged through the ſtreets. The houſe in which he was born was demoliſhed, and a column of infamy erected ; his father and mother were baniſhed from Angouleſme, and ordered to quit the kingdom upon pain 6f being hanged, if they returned, without any form of proceſs ; his brothers, ſiſters, uncles, and other relations, were commanded to lay aſide the name of Ravilliac, and to affume ſome other. Such was the fate of this execrable monſter, who, ac-cording to his own account, ſuſſered himſelf to be im-pelled to ſuch a fact by the ſeditious fermons and books of the Jefuits, whom Henry, rather out of fear than love, had recalled and careſſed, and to whom he had bequeathed his heart.</p><p>Neither the dying words of Ravilliac, nor ſo much of his proceſs as was publiſhed, were credited by his cotemporaries. Regalt the hiſtorian ſays, that there were two different opinions concerning this aſſaffina-tion ; one, that it was conducted by ſome grandees, who ſacrificed that monarch to their old reſentments; the other, that it was done by the emiſſaries of the Spaniards. Letters from Bruſſels, Antwerp, Mechlin, and other places, were received before the 15th of May, with a report of the king’s death. Though nothing occurs in the examinations of Ravilliac that were firſt publiſhed, in reference to hi3 journeys to Naples and other places; yet as theſe are ſet down as certain truths by good authors, ſo there are probable grounds to believe that they were not fictitious. It appears from Sir Ralph win wood’s Memorials, that Ravilliac had been not long before at Bruſſels. Amongſt other cir-cumſtances that created a very great doubt, whether the aſſaſſin ſpoke truth, were the things found in his pocket at the time he was feized ; amongſt which was a chaplet, the figure of a heart made in cotton, in the centre of which he ſaid there was a bit of the true croſs, but when cut there was none, which he affirmed was given him by a canon at Angouleſme, a piece o£ paper with the arms of France painted upon it, ano-ther full of characters, and a third containing verſes for the meditation of a criminal going to execution. The provoſt of Pluviers, or Petiviers, in Beauce, about fix miles from Paris, had ſaid openly on the day that Henry IV. was murdered, " This day the king is either ſlain or dangerouſly wounded.” After the king’s death w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> as known, he was ſeized and ſent priſoner to Paris ; ‘ but, before he was examined, he was found hanged in the firings of his drawers. His body was, notwith-ſtanding, hung up by the heels on the common gibbet on the 19th of June, what increaſed the ſuſpicions</p>

<p>grounded on this man’s end, was his having two ſons Jeſuits, and his being a dependent on the family of Monſieur d’Entragues,</p>
