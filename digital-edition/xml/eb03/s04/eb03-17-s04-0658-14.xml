                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Specifics,</hi> in medicine. By specifics is not meant ſuch
                    as infallibly and in all patients produce ſalutary effects. Such medicines are
                    not to be expected, becauſe the operations and effects of remedies are not
                    formally inherent in them, but depend upon the mutual action and reaction of the
                    body and medicine upon each other ; hence the various effects of the same
                    medicine in the ſame kind of diſorders in different patients, and in the ſame
                    patient at different times. By ſpecific medicines we underſtand ſuch medicines
                    as are more infallible than any other in any particular diſorder.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Gravity,</hi> is a term much employed in the diſcuſſions of
                    modern phyſics. It expreſſes the weight of any particular kind of matter, as
                    compared with the weight of the ſame bulk of ſome other body of which the weight
                    is ſuppoſed to be familiarly known, and is therefore taken for the ſtandard of
                    companion. The body generally made uſe of for this purpoſe is pure water. See
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydrostatics,</hi> Sect. III.</p>
                <p>The ſpecific gravity of bodies is a very intereſting queſtion both to the
                    philoſopher and to the man of buſineſs. The philoſopher considers the weights of
                    bodies as meaſures of the number of material atoms, or the quantity of matter
                    which they contain. This he does on the ſupposition that every atom of matter is
                    of the ſame weight, whatever may be its ſensible form. This ſupposition,
                    however, is made by him with caution, and he has recourſe to ſpecific gravity
                    ſor aſcertaining its truth in various ways. This shall be conſidered by and by.
                    The man of buſineſs entertains no doubt of the matter, and proceeds on it as a
                    sure guide in his most intereſting tranſactions. We meaſure commodities of
                    various kinds by tons, pounds, and ounces, in the ſame manner as we meaſure them
                    by yards, feet, and inches, or by buſhels, gallons, and pints ; nay, we do this
                    with much greater confidence, and prefer this meaſurement to all others,
                    whenever we are much intereſted to know the exact proportions of matter that
                    bodies contain. The weight of a quantity of grain is allowed to inform us much
                    more exactly of its real quantity of uſeſul matter than the moſt accurate
                    meaſure of its bulk. We ſee many circumſtances which can vary the bulk of a
                    quantity of matter, and theſe are frequently ſuch as we can-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0665.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0659"/> not regulate
                    or prevent ; but we know very few indeed that can make any ſenſible change in
                    this weight without the addition or abſtraction of other matter. Even taking it
                    to the ſummit of a high mountain, or from the equator to the polar region, will
                    make no change in its weight as it is aſcertained by the balance, becauſe there
                    is the ſame real diminution of weight in the pounds and ounces uſed in the
                    examination.</p>
                <p>Notwithſtanding the unavoidable change which heat and cold make in the bulk of
                    bodies, and the permanent varieties of the ſame kind of matter which are cauſed
                    by different circumſtances of growth, texture, &amp; c. moſt kinds of matter
                    have a certain conſtancy in the denſity of their particles, and therefore in the
                    weight of a given bulk. Thus the purity of gold, and its degree of adulteration,
                    may be interred ſrom its weight, it being purer in proportion as it is more
                    denſe. The denſity, therefore, of different kinds of tangible matter becomes
                    characteriſtic of the kind, and a teſt oſ its purity ; it marks a particular
                    appearance in which matter exiſts, and may therefore be called, with propriety,
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Specific.</hi></p>
                <p>But this denſity cannot be directly obſerved. It is not by comparing the
                    diſtances between the atoms of matter in gold and in water that we say the firſt
                    is 19 times denser than the laſt, and that an inch of gold contains 19 times as
                    many material atoms as an inch of water ; we reckon on the equal gravitation of
                    every atom of matter whether of gold or of water ; therefore the weight of any
                    body becomes the indication oſ its material denſity, and the weight of a given
                    bulk becomes ſpecific of that kind of matter, marking its kind, and even
                    aſcertaining its purity in this form.</p>
                <p>It is evident that, in order to make this compariſon of general uſe, the ſtandard
                    muſt be familiarly known, and muſt be very uniform in its denſity, and the
                    compariſon of bulk and denſity muſt be eaſy and accurate. The moſt obvious
                    method would be to form, with all nicety, a piece of the ſtandard matter of ſome
                    convenient bulk, and to weigh it very exactly, and keep a note of its weight:
                    then, to make the compariſon of any other ſubſtance, it muſt be made into a maſs
                    of the ſame preciſe bulk, and weighed with equal care ; and the moſt convenient
                    way of expreſſing the ſpecific gravity would be to conſider the weight of the
                    ſtandard as unity, and then the number expreſſing the ſpecific gravity is the
                    number of times that the weight of the ſtandard is contained in that of the
                    other ſubſtance. This compariſon is moſt easily and accurately made in fluids.
                    We have only to make a veſſel of known dimenſions equal to that of the ſtandard
                    which we employ, and to weigh it when empty, and then when filled with the
                    fluid. Nay, the moſt difficult part of the proceſs, the making a veſſel of the
                    preciſe dimenſions of the ſtandard, may be avoided, by uſing ſome fluid
                    ſubſtance for a ſtandard. Any veſſel will then do ; and we may enſure very great
                    accuracy by uſing a veſſel with a ſlender neck, ſuch as a phial or matrass ; for
                    when this is filled to a certain mark in the neck, any error in the eſtimation
                    by the eye will bear a very ſmall proportion to the whole. The weight of the
                    ſtandard fluid which fills it to this mark being carefully aſcertained, is kept
                    in remembrance. The ſpecific gravity of any other fluid is had by weighing the
                    contents of this veſſel when filled with it, and dividing the weight by the
                    weight of the ſtandard. The quotent is the ſpecific gravity of the fluid. But in
                    all other</p>
                <p>caſes this is a very difficult problem: it requires very nice hands, and an
                    accurate eye, to make two bodies of the ſame bulk. An error of one hundredth
                    part in the linear dimenſions of a ſolid body makes an error of a 30th part in
                    its bulk ; and bodies of irregular ſhapes and friable ſubſtance, ſuch as the
                    ores of metals, cannot be brought into convenient and exact dimenſions for
                    meaſurement.</p>
                <p>From all theſe inconveniences and difficulties we are freed by the celebrated
                    Archimedes, who, from the principles of hydroſtatics diſcovered or eſtabliſhed
                    by him, deduced the accurate and eaſy method which is now univerſally practiſed
                    for discovering the ſpecific gravity and denſity of bodies. (See <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Archimedes</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydrostatics,</hi>
                    n⁰ 11.) Inſtead of meaſuring the bulk off the body by that of the displaced
                    fluid (which would have been impoſſible for Archimedes to do with any thing like
                    the neceſſary preciſion), we have only to obſerve the loſs of weight iuſtained
                    by the ſolid. This can be done with great eaſe and exactneſs. Whatever may be
                    the bulk of the body, this loſs of weight is the weight of an equal bulk of the
                    fluid ; and we obtain the ſpecific gravity of the body by ſimply dividing its
                    whole weight by the weight loſt : the quotient is the ſpecific gravity when this
                    fluid is taken for the ſtandard, even though we ſhould not know the abſolute
                    weight of any given bulk of this ſtandard. It alſo gives us an eaſy and accurate
                    method of aſcertaining even this fundamental point. We have only to form any
                    ſolid body into an exact cube, ſphere, or priſm, of known dimenſions, and
                    obſerve what weight it loses when immerſed in this ſtandard fluid. This is the
                    weight of the ſame bulk of the ſtandard to be kept in remembrance ; and thus we
                    obtain, by the by, a moſt eaſy and accurate method for meaſuring the bulk or
                    ſolid contents of any body, however irregular its ſhape may be. We have only to
                    ſee how much weight it loses in the ſtandard fluid ; we can compute what
                    quantity of the ſtandard fluid will have this weight. Thus ſhould we find that a
                    quantity of sand, or a furze buſh, loses 250 ounces when immerſed in pure water,
                    we learn by this that the ſolid meaſure of every grain of the fand, or of every
                    twig and prickle of the furze, when added into one ſum, amounts to the fourth
                    part of a cubic foot, or to 432 cubic inches.</p>
                <p>To all theſe advantages of the Archimedean method of aſcertaining the ſpecific
                    gravity of bodies, derived from his hydroſtatical doctrines and diſcoveries, we
                    may add, that the immediate ſtandard of compariſon, namely, water, is, of all
                    the ſubſtances that we know, the fitteſt for the purpoſe of an univerſal
                    ſtandard of reference. In its ordinary natural ſtate it is ſufficiently conſtant
                    and uniform in its weight for every examination where the utmoſt mathematical
                    accuracy is not wanted ; all its variations ariſe from impurities, from which it
                    may at all times be ſeparated by the ſimple proceſs of diſtillation : and we
                    have every reaſon to think that when pure, its denſity, when of the ſame
                    temperature, is invariable.</p>
                <p>Water is therefore univerſally taken for the unit of that ſcale on which we
                    meaſure the ſpecific gravity of bodies, and its weight is called 1. The ſpecific
                    gravity of any other body is the real weight in pounds and ounces, when of the
                    bulk of one pound or one ounce of water. It is therefore of the firſt
                    importance, in all<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0666.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0660"/> diſcuſſions reſpecting the ſpecific gravity of
                    bodies, to have the preciſe weight of ſome known bulk of pure water. We have
                    taken ſome pains to examine and compare the experiments on this ſubject, and
                    ſhall endeavour to aſcertain this point with the precision which it deserves. We
                    ſhall reduce all to the Engliſh cubic foot and avoirdupois ounce of the
                    Exchequer ſtandard, on account of a very convenient circumſtance peculiar to
                    this unit, viz. that a cubic foot contains almoſt preciſely a thouſand ounces of
                    pure water, ſo that the speciſic gravity of bodies expreſſes the number of ſuch
                    ounces contained in a cubic foot.</p>
                <p>We begin with a trial made before the houſe of commons in 1696 by Mr Everard. He
                    weighed 2145,6 cubic inches of water by a balance, which turned ſenſibly with 6
                    grains, when there were 30 pounds in each ſcale. The weights employed were the
                    troy weights, in the depoſit of the Court of Exchequer, which are ſtill
                    preſerved, and have been moſt ſcrupulouſly examined and compared with each
                    other. The weight was 1131ounces 14 pennyweights. This wants juſt 11 grains of a
                    thouſand avoirdupois ounces for 1728 cubic inches, or a cubic foot ; and it
                    would have amounted to that weight had it been a degree or two colder. The
                    temperature indeed is not mentioned ; but as the trial was made in a comfortable
                    room, we may preſume the temperature to have been about 55⁰ of Fahrenheit’s
                    thermometer. The dimensions of the veſſel were as accurate as the nice hand of
                    Mr Abraham Sharp, Mr Flamſtead’s aſſiſtant at Greenwich, could execute, and it
                    was made by the Exchequer ſtandard of length.</p>
                <p>This is confided in by the naturaliſts of Europe as a very accurate ſtandard
                    experiment, and it is confirmed by many others both private and public. The
                    ſtandards of weight and capacity employed in the experiment are ſtill in
                    exiſtence, and publicly known, by the report of the Royal Society to parliament
                    in 1742, and by the report of a committee of the houſe of commons in 1758. This
                    gives it a ſuperiority over all the meaſures which have come to our
                    knowledge.</p>
                <p>The firſt experiment, made with proper attention, that we meet with, is by the
                    celebrated Snellius, about the year 1615, and related in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Eratosthenes Batavus.</hi> He weighed a Rhinland cubic foot of diſtilled
                    water, and found it 62,79 Amſterdam pounds. If this was the ordinary weight of
                    the ſhops, containing 7626 Engliſh troy grains, the Engliſh cubic foot muſt be
                    62 pounds 9 ounces, only one ounce more than by Everard’s experiment. If it was
                    the Mint pound, the weight was 62 pounds 6 ounces. The only other trials which
                    can come into competition with Mr Everard’s are ſome made by the Academy oſ
                    Sciences at Paris. Pſeart, in 1691, found the Paris cubic foot of the water of
                    the fountain d’Arcueil to weigh 69,588 pounds <hi rend="italic">poids de
                        Paris.</hi> DuHamel obtained the very ſame reſult ; but Mr Monge, in 1783,
                    ſays that filtered rain-water oſ the temperature 12⁰ (Reaumur) weighs 69,3792.
                    Both theſe meaſures are conſiderably below Mr Everard’s, which is 62,5, the
                    former giving 62,053, and the latter 61,868. M. Lavoiſier states the Paris cubic
                    foot at 70 pounds, which makes the Engliſh foot 62,47. But there is an
                    inconſistency among them which makes the comparison impoſſible. Some changes
                    were made in</p>
                <p>1688, by royal authority, in the national standards, both of weight and length ;
                    and the academicians are exceedingly puzzled to this day in reconciling the
                    differences, and cannot even ascertain with perfect aſſurance the lineal
                    meaſures which were employed in their moſt boaſted geodetical operations.</p>
                <p>Such variations in the meaſurements made by perſons of reputation for judgment
                    and accuracy engaged the writer of this article ſome years ago to attempt
                    another. A veſſel was made of a cylindrical form, as being more eaſily executed
                    with accuracy, whoſe height and diameter were 6 inches, taken from a moſt
                    accurate copy of the Exchequer ſtandard. It was weighed in diſtilled water of
                    the temperature 55⁰ ſeveral times without varying 2 grains, and it loſt 42895
                    grains. This gives for the cubic foot 998,74 ounces, deficient from Mr Everard’s
                    an ounce and a quarter; a difference which may be expected, ſince Mr Everard
                    uſed the New River water without diſtillation.</p>
                <p>We hope that theſe obſervations will not be thought ſuperfluous in a matter of
                    ſuch continual reference, in the moſt intereſting queſtions both to the
                    philoſopher and the man of buſineſs; and that the determination which we have
                    given will be conſidered as sufficiently authenticated.</p>
                <p>Let us, therefore, for the future take water for the ſtandard, and ſuppoſe that,
                    when of the ordinary temperature of ſummer, and in its ſtate of greateſt natural
                    purity, viz. in clean rain or ſnow, an Engliſh cubic foot of it weighs a
                    thouſand avoirdupois ounces of 437,5 troy grains each. Divide the weight of any
                    body by the weight of an equal bulk of water, the quotient is the ſpecific
                    gravity of that body ; and if the three first figures of the decimal be
                    accounted integers, the quotient is the number of avoirdupois ounces in a cubic
                    foot of the body. Thus the ſpecific gravity of the very fineſt gold which the
                    refiner can produce is 19,365, and a cubic foot of it weighs 19365 ounces.</p>
                <p>But an important remark muſt be made here. All bodies of homogeneous or
                    unorganiſed texture expand by heat and contract by cooling. The expansion and
                    contraction by the same change of temperature is very different in different
                    bodies. Thus water, when heated from 60⁰ to 100⁰, increaſes its volume nearly
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 167</hi> of its bulk,
                    and mercury only <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 243</hi>
                    and many ſubſtances much leſs. Hence it follows, that an experiment determines
                    the ſpecific gravity only in that very temperature in which the bodies are
                    examined. It will therefore be proper always to note this temperature ; and it
                    will be convenient to adopt ſome very uſeful temperature for ſuch trials in
                    general : perhaps about 60⁰ of Fahrenheit’s thermometer is as convenient as any.
                    It may always be procured in theſe climates without inconvenience. A temperature
                    near to freezing would have ſome advantages, becauſe water changes its bulk very
                    little between the temperature 32⁰ and 45⁰. But this temperature cannot always
                    be obtained. It will much conduce to the facility of the compariſon to know the
                    variation which heat produces on pure water. The following table, taken from the
                    obſervations of Dr Blagden and Mr Gilpin (Phil. Tranſ. 1792) will answer this
                    purpoſe.</p>

                <p>Thoſe gentlemen obſerved the expanſion of water to be very anomalous between 32⁰
                    and 45⁰. This is diſtinctly ſeen during the gradual cooling of water to the
                    point of freezing. It contracts for a while, and then ſuddenly expands. But we
                    ſeldom have occaſion to meaſure ſpecific gravities in ſuch temperature.</p>
                <p>The reader is now sufficiently acquainted with the principles of this
                    hydrostatical method of determining the ſpecific gravity of bodies, and can
                    judge of the propriety of the forms which may be propoſed for the
                    experiment.</p>
                <p>The ſpecific gravity of a fluid may be determined either by filling with it a
                    veſſel with a narrow neck, or by weighing a ſolid body that is immerſed in it.
                    It is hard to ſay which is the beſt way. The laſt is not ſubject to any error in
                    filling, becauſe we may ſuſpend the ſolid by a fine wire, which will not
                    diſplace any ſenſible quantity of the fluid ; and if the ſolid is but a little
                    heavier than the fluid, the balance being loaded only with the exceſs, will be
                    very ſenſible to the ſmalleſt want of equilibrium. But this advantage is perhaps
                    compenſated by an obstruction to the motion of the ſolid up or down in the
                    fluid, ariſing from viscidity. When the weight in the oppoſite ſcale is yet too
                    ſmall, we ſlowly add more, and at laſt grain by grain, which gradually brings
                    the beam to the level. When it is exactly level, the weight in the ſcale is
                    ſomewhat too great; for it not only balances the preponderance of the ſolid, but
                    alſo this viſcidity of the fluid. But we may get rid of this error. Add a ſmall
                    quantity more ; this will bring the beam over to the other side. Now put as much
                    into the ſcale on the ſame side with the ſolid ; this will not reſtore the beam
                    to its level. We muſt add more till this be accompliſhed ; and this addition is
                    the meaſure of the viſeidity of the fluid, and muſt be ſubtracted from the
                    weight that was in the other ſcale when the beam came first to a level. This
                    effect of viſcidity is not inſenſible, with nice apparatus, even in the pureſt
                    water, and in many fluids it is very conſiderable—and, what is worſe, it is very
                    changeable. It is greatly diminiſhed by heat ; and this is an additional reaſon
                    for making thoſe trials in pretty warm temperatures. But for fluids of which the
                    viſcidity is conſiderable, this method is by no means proper ; and we muſt take
                    the</p>
                <p>other, and weigh them in a veſſel with a narrow neck. Mercury muſt alſo be
                    treated in this way, becauſe we have no ſolid that will sink in it but gold and
                    platina.</p>
                <p>It is not ſo eaſy as one would imagine to fill a veſſel preciſely to the ſame
                    degree upon every trial. But if we do not operate on too ſmall quantities, the
                    unavoidable error may be made altogether inſignificant, by having the neck of
                    the veſſel very ſmall. If the veſſel hold a pound of water, and the neck do not
                    exceed a quarter of an inch (and it will not greatly retard the operation to
                    have it half this ſize), the examinator muſt be very careleſs indeed to err one
                    part in two thouſand ; and this is perhaps as near as we can come with a
                    balance. We muſt always recollect that the capacity of the veſſel changes by
                    heat, and we muſt know this variation, and take it into the account. But it is
                    affectation to regard (as Mr Homberg would make us believe that he did) the
                    diſtenſion of the veſſel by the preſſure of the fluid. His experiments of this
                    kind have by no means the conſiſtency with each other that ſhould convince us
                    that he did not commit much greater errors than what aroſe from diſtenſion.</p>
                <p>In examining either ſolids or fluids, we muſt be careful to free their ſurface,
                    or that of the veſſel in which the fluid is to be weighed, from air, which
                    frequently adheres to it in a peculiar manner, and, by forming a bubble,
                    increaſes the apparent bulk of the ſolid, or diminiſhes the capacity of the
                    veſſel. The greateſt part of what appears on thoſe occaſions ſeems to have
                    exiſted in the fluid in a ſtate of chemical union, and to be ſet at liberty by
                    the ſuperior attraction of the fluid for the contiguous ſolid body. Theſe air
                    bubbles muſt be carefully bruſhed off by hand. All greasy matters muſt be
                    cleared off for the ſame reaſon : they prevent the fluid from coming into
                    contact.</p>
                <p>We muſt be no leſs careful that no water is imbibed by the ſolid, which would
                    increaſe its weight without increaſing its bulk. In ſome caſes, however, a very
                    long maceration and imbibition is neceſſary. Thus, in examining the ſpecific
                    gravity of the fibrous part of vegetables, we ſhould err exceedingly if we
                    imagined it as ſmall as appears at firſt. We believe that in moſt plants it is
                    at leaſt as great as water, for after long maceration they sink in it.</p>
                <p>It is almoſt needleſs to ſay that the niceſt and moſt ſenſible balances are
                    neceſſary for this examination. Balances are even conſtructed on purpoſe, and
                    fitted with ſeveral pieces of apparatus, which make the examination eaſy and
                    neat. We have deſcribed (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Balance)</hi> Mr Graveſande’s
                    as one of the moſt convenient of any. His contrivance for obſerving the
                    fractions of a grain is extremely ingenious and expeditious, eſpecially for
                    detecting the effect of viſcidity.</p>
                <p>The hydrometer, or aecometer, is another inſtrument for aſcertaining the ſpecific
                    gravity of fluids. This very pretty inſtrument is the invention of a lady, as
                    eminent for intellectual accompliſhments as ſhe was admired for her beauty.
                    Hypatia, the learned daughter of the celebrated mathematician Theon of
                    Alexandria, became for eminent for her mathematical knowledge, that ſhe was made
                    public profeſſor of the ſcience in the firſt ſchool in the world. She wrote a
                    commentary on the works of Apollonius and of Diophantus, and compoſed
                    Aſtronomical Tables ; all of which are loſt. Theſe rare<pb

                    accompliſhments, however, could not ſave her from the fury of the fanatics of
                    Alexandria, who cut her in pieces for having taken an offenſive part in a
                    diſpute between the governor and patriarch.—We have deſcribed ſome of the moſt
                    approved of theſe inſtruments in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Hydrometer,</hi> and ſhall in this place make a few obſervations on the
                    principles of their conſtruction, not as they are uſually made, accommodated to
                    the examination of particular liquors, but as indicators of pure ſpecific
                    gravity. And we muſt premiſe, that this would, for many reaſons, be the beſt way
                    of conſtructing them. The very ingenious contrivances for accommodating them to
                    particular purpoſes are unavoidably attended with many ſources of error, both in
                    their adjuſtment by the maker and in their uſe ; and all that is gained by a
                    very expenſive inſtrument is the saving the trouble of inſpecting a table. A
                    ſimple ſcale of ſpecific gravity would expoſe to no error in conſtruction,
                    becauſe all the weights but one, or all the points of the ſcale but one, are to
                    be obtained by calculation, which is incomparably more exact than any manual
                    operation, and the table can always be more exact than any complex obſervation.
                    But a ſtill greater advantage is, that the inſtruments would by this means be
                    fitted for examining all liquors whatever, whereas at preſent they are almoſt
                    uſeleſs for any but the one for which they are conſtructed.</p>
                <p>Hydrometers are of two kinds. The moſt ſimple and the moſt delicate are just a
                    ſubſtitute for the hydroſtatical balance.<note anchored="false" n="1"

                    of a ball (or rather an egg or pear-ſhaped veſſel, which moves more eaſily
                    through the fluid) A (fig. I.) having a foot projecting down from it, terminated
                    by another ball B, and a ſlender ſtalk or wire above, carrying a little diſh C.
                    The whole is made ſo light as to float in the lighteſt fluid we are acquainted
                    with ; ſuch as vitriolic or muriatic æther, whoſe ſpecific gravity is only 0,73.
                    This number ſhould be marked on the diſh, indicating that this is the ſpecific
                    gravity of the fluid in which the inſtrument floats, sinking to the point D of
                    the stem. The ball B is made heavy, and the foot is of ſome length, that the
                    inſtrument may have liability, and ſwim erect, even if conſiderably loaded above
                    ; and, for the ſame reaſon, it muſt be made very round, otherwiſe it will lean
                    to a ſide. When put into a heavier liquor, its buoyancy will cauſe it to float
                    with a part of the ball above the ſurface. Weights are now put into the ſcale C,
                    till the inſtrument sink to D. The weight put into the ſcale, added to the
                    weight of the inſtrument, is the weight of the diſplaced fluid. This, compared
                    with the weight of the whole when the instrument is ſwimming in pure water,
                    gives the ſpeciſic gravity of the fluid. All trouble of calculation may be
                    avoided by marking the weights with ſuch numbers as ſhall indicate the ſpecific
                    gravity at once. Thus having loaded the inſtrument to as to sink it to D in pure
                    water, call the whole weight 1000 ; then weigh the inſtrument itſelf, and ſay, “
                    as the weight when ſwimming in water is to its preſent weight, ſo is</p>
                <p>1000 to a 4th proportional.” This is the ſpeciſic gravity of the liquor which
                    would float the unloaded inſtrument. Suppoſe this to be 730. The hydrometer
                    would juſt float in muriatic æther, and this ſhould he marked on the ſide. Now
                    make a ſet of ſmall</p>
                <p>weights, and mark them, not by their weights in grains, but in ſuch units that
                    270 of them ſhall be equal to the weight which fits the inſtrument for pure
                    water.</p>
                <p>Suppoſe that, in order to float this inſtrument in a certain brandy, there are
                    required 186 in theſe ſmall weights. This added to 730 gives 916 for the
                    ſpeciſic gravity, and ſhows it to be preciſely exciſe proof ſpirit. Nine
                    weights, viz, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1, will ſuffice for all liquors
                    from æther to the ſtrongeſt worts. And that the trouble in changing the weights
                    may be greatly leſſened, let a few circles <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, d, e,</hi>
                    be marked on the top of the ball. When we ſee it float unloaded at the circle C
                    for instance, we know it will require at leaſt 128 to sink it to D thaton the
                    ſtem.</p>
                <p>If the weights to be added above are conſiderable, it raiſes the centre of
                    gravity ſo much, that a ſmall want of equilibrium, by laying the weights on one
                    ſide, will produce a great inclination of the inſtrument, which is unſightly.
                    Inſtead therefore of making them looſe weights, it is proper to make them round
                    plates, with a ſmall hole in the middle, to go on a pin in the middle of the
                    ſcale. This will keep the inſtrument always upright. But unleſs the hydrometer
                    is of a conſiderable ſize, it can hardly be made ſo as to extend from the
                    lighteſt to the heavieſt fluid which we may have occaſion to examine, even
                    though we except mercury. Some of the mineral acids are conſiderably more than
                    twice the weight of æther. When there is ſuch a load at top, the hydrometer is
                    very apt to overſet, and inclines with the ſmallest want of equilibrium. Great
                    ſize is inconvenient even to the philoſopher, becauſe it is not always in his
                    power to operate on a quantity of fluid sufficient to float the inſtrument.
                    Therefore two, or perhaps three, are neceſſary for general examination. One may
                    reach from æther to water ; another may ſerve for all liquors of a ſpeciſic
                    gravity between 1 and 14 ; and the third, for the mineral acids, may reach from
                    this to 2. If each of theſe be about two ſolid inches in capacity, we may eaſily
                    and expeditiouſly determine the ſpeciſic gravity within one ten thouſandth part
                    of the truth : and this is preciſion enough for moſt purpoſes of ſcience or
                    busineſs.</p>
                <p>The chief queſtions are, 1. To aſcertain the ſpeciſic gravity of an unknown
                    fluid. This needs no farther explanation. 2. To aſcertain the proportion of two
                    fluids which are known to be in a mixture. This is done by diſcovering the
                    ſpeciſic gravity of the mixture by means of the hydrometer, and then deducing
                    the proportion from a compariſon of this with the ſpecific gravities of the
                    ingredients.</p>
                <p>In this mode of examination the bulk is always the ſame ; for the hydrometer is
                    immerged in the different fluids to the ſame depth. Now if an inch, for example,
                    of this bulk is made up of the heavieſt fluid, there is an inch wanting of the
                    lighteſt ; and the change made in the weight of the mixture is the difference
                    between the weight of an inch of the heavieſt and of an inch of the lighteſt
                    ingredients. The number of inches therefore of the heavieſt fluid is
                    proportional to the addition made to the weight of the mixture. Therefore let B
                    and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> be the bulks of the heavieſt and lighteſt fluids in
                    the bulk of the mixture ; and let D, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and ϧ be the
                    denſities, or the weights, or the ſpecific gravities (for they are in one<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0669.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0663"/> ratio) <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> the heavy fluid, the light fluid, and the mixture
                    (their bulk being that of the hydrometer). We have β = B + b. The addition which
                    would have been made to the bulk β, if the lighteſt fluid were changed entirely
                    for the heavieſt, would be D — <hi rend="italic">d ;</hi> and the change which
                    is really made is ϐ <hi rend="italic">—d.</hi> Therefore β : b = D— <hi
                        rend="italic">d : ϐ—d.</hi> For ſimilar reaſons we ſhould have β : B = D -
                    d: D — ϐ <hi rend="italic">;</hi> or, in words, “ <hi rend="italic">the
                        difference between the ſpecific gravities of the two fluids, is to the
                        difference between the ſpecific gravities of the mixture and of the lightest
                        fluid, as the bulk of the whole to the bulk of the heaviest contained in the
                        mixture ;"</hi> and “ <hi rend="italic">the difference of the ſpecific
                        gravities of the two fluids, is to the difference of the ſpecific gravities
                        of the mixture and of the heaviest fluids, as the bulk of the whole to that
                        of the lightest contained in the mixture.”</hi> This is the form in which
                    the ordinary buſineſs of life requires the anſwer to be expreſſed, becauſe we
                    generally reckon the quantity or liquors by bulk, in gallons, pints, quarts. But
                    it would have been equally eaſy to have obtained the anſwer in pounds and ounces
                    ; or it may be had from their bulks, ſince we know their ſpecific gravities.</p>
                <p>The hydrometer more commonly uſed is the ancient one of Hypatia, conſiſting of a
                    ball, A (fig. 2.), made ſteady by an addition B, below it like the former, but
                    having a long ſtem CF above. It is ſo loaded that it sinks to the top F of the
                    ſtem in the lighteſt of all the fluids which we propoſe to meaſure with it, and
                    to ſink only to C in the heavieſt. In a fluid of intermediate ſpecific gravity
                    it will ſink to ſome point between C and F.</p>
                <p>In this form of the hydrometer the weight is always the ſame, and the immediate
                    information given by the inſtrument is that of different bulks with equal
                    weight. Becauſe the inſtrument sinks till the bulk of the diſplaced fluid equals
                    it in weight, and the additions to the diſplaced fluid are all made by the ſtem,
                    it is evident that equal bulks of the ſtem indicate equal additions of volume.
                    Thus the ſtem becomes a ſcale of bulks to the ſame weight.</p>
                <p>The only form in which the ſtem can be made with ſufficient accuracy is
                    cylindrical or priſmatical. Such a ſtem may be made in the moſt accurate manner
                    by wire-drawing, that is, paſſing it through a hole made in a hardened ſteel
                    plate. If ſuch a ſtem be divided into equal parts, it becomes a ſcale of bulks
                    in arithmetical progreſſion. This is the eaſieſt and moſt natural diviſion of
                    the ſcale ; but it will not indicate denſities, ſpecific gravities, or weights
                    of the ſame bulk in arithmetical progreſſion. The ſpecific gravity is as the
                    weight divided by the bulk. Now a ſeries of diviſors (the bulks), in
                    arithmetical progreſſion, applied to the ſame dividend (the bulk and weight of
                    the hydrometer as it floats in water), will not give a ſeries of quotients (the
                    ſpecific gravities) in arithmetical progreſſion : they will be in what is called
                        <hi rend="italic">harmonic progreſsion,</hi> their differences continually
                    diminiſhing. This will appear even when physically conſidered. When the
                    hydrometer sinks a tenth of an inch near the top of the ſtem, it diſplaces one
                    tenth of an inch of a light fluid, compared with that diſplaced by it when it is
                    floating with all the ſtem above the ſurface. In order therefore that the
                    divisions of the ſtem may indicate equal changes of ſpecific gravity, they muſt
                    be in a ſeries of harmonic progreſſionals increasing. The point at which the
                    inſtrument floats in pure water ſhould be marked 1000, and thoſe above it 999,
                    998, 997, &amp; c. ; and thoſe below the water mark muſt be numbered 1001, 1002,
                    1003, &amp; c. Such a ſcale will be a very appoſite picture of the denſities of
                    fluids, for the denſity or vicinity of the divisions will be preciſely ſimilar
                    to the denſity of the fluids. Each interval is a bulk of fluid of the ſame
                    weight. If the whole inſtrument were drawn out into wire of the ſize of the
                    ſtem, the length from the water mark would be 1000.</p>
                <p>Such are the rules by which the ſcale muſt be divided. But there muſt be ſome
                    points of it determined by experiment, and it will be proper to take them as
                    remote from each other as poſſible. For this purpoſe let the inſtrument be
                    accurately marked at the point where it ſtands, in two fluids, differing as much
                    in ſpecific gravity as the inſtrument will admit. Let it alſo be marked where it
                    ſtands in water. Then determine with the utmoſt preciſion the ſpecific gravities
                    of theſe fluids, and put their values at the correſponding points of the ſcale.
                    Then the intermediate points of the ſcale muſt be computed for the different
                    intervening ſpecific gravities, or it muſt be divided from a pattern ſcale of
                    harmonic progreſſionals in a way well known to the mathematical
                    inſtrument-makers. If the ſpecific gravities have been accurately determined,
                    the value 1000 will be ſound to fall preciſely in the water mark. If we attempt
                    the diviſion entirely by experiment, by making a number of fluids of different
                    ſpecific gravities, and marking; the ſtem as it ſtands <hi rend="italic">in</hi>
                    them, we ſhall find the divisions turn out very anomalous. This is however the
                    way uſually practiſed ; and there are few hydrometers, even from the beſt maker,
                    that hold true to a single diviſion or two. Yet the method by computation is not
                    more troubleſome; and one ſcale of harmonic progreſſionals will ſerve to divide
                    every ſtem that offers. We may make uſe of a ſcale of equal parts for the ſtem,
                    with the aſſiſtance of two little tables. One of theſe contains the ſpecific
                    gravities in harmonic progreſſion, correſponding to the arithmetical ſcale of
                    bulks on the ſtem of the hydrometer ; the other contains the divisions and
                    fractions of a diviſion of the ſcale of bulks, which correſpond to an
                    arithmetical ſcale of ſpecific gravities. We believe this to be the beſt method
                    of all. The ſcale of equal parts on the ſtem is ſo eaſily made, and the little
                    table is ſo eaſily inspected, that it has every advantage of accuracy and
                    dispatch, and it gives, by the way, an amuſing view of the relation of the bulks
                    and denſities.</p>
                <p>We have hitherto ſuppoſed a ſcale extending from the lighteſt to the heavieſt
                    fluid. But unleſs it be of a very inconvenient length, the divisions muſt be
                    very minute. Moreover, when the bulk of the ſtem bears a great proportion to
                    that of the body, the inſtrument does not ſwim ſteady ; it is therefore proper
                    to limit the range of the inſtrument in the ſame manner as thoſe of the firſt
                    kind. A range from the denſity of aether to that of water may be very well
                    executed in an inſtrument of very moderate ſize, and two others will do for all
                    the heavier liquors ; or an equal range in any other denſities as may suit the
                    uſual occupations of the experimenter.</p>
                <p>To avoid the inconveniences of a hydrometer with a very long and ſlender ſtem, or
                    the neceſſity of having a series of them, a third sort has been contrived, in<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0670.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0664"/> which the
                    principle of both are combined. Suppoſe a hydrometer with a stem, whoſe bulk is
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th of that of
                    the ball, and that it sinks in aether to the top of the ſtem ; it is evident
                    that in a fluid which is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        10</hi> th heavier, the whole ſtem will emerge ; for the bulk of the
                    displaced fluid is now <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                        10</hi> th of the whole leſs, and the weight is the ſame as before, and
                    therefore the ſpecific gravity is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th greater.</p>
                <p>Thus we have obtained a hydrometer which will indicate, by means of diviſions
                    marked on the ſtem, all ſpecific gravides from 0,73 to 0,803 ; for 0,803 is <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /1 <hi rend="subscript"> 0</hi> th greater than
                    0,7 3. Theſe diviſions muſt be made in harmonic progreſſion, as before directed
                    for an entire ſcale, placing 0,73 at the top of the ſtem and 0,803 at the
                    bottom.</p>
                <p>When it floats at the loweſt diviſion, a weight may be put on the top of the
                    ſtem, which will again ſink it to the top. This weight muſt evidently be 0,073,
                    or <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th of the
                    weight of the fluid diſplaced by the unloaded inſtrument. The hydrometer, thus
                    loaded, indicates the ſame ſpecific gravity, by the top of the ſtem, that the
                    unloaded inſtrument indicates by the loweſt diviſion. Therefore, when loaded, it
                    will indicate another ſeries of ſpecific gravities, from 0,803 to 0,8833 ( =
                    0,803 + 0,0803), and will float in a liquor of the ſpecific gravity 0,8833 with
                    the whole ſtem above the ſurface.</p>
                <p>In like manner, if we take off this weight, and put on I — 0,080,3, it will ſink
                    the hydrometer to the top of the ſtem ; and with this new weight it will
                    indicate another ſeries of ſpecific gravities from 0,8833 to 0,97163 (=0,8833 +
                    0,08833). And, in the ſame manner, a third weight = 08833 will again ſink it to
                    the top of the ſtem, and fit it for another ſeries of ſpecific gravities up to
                    1,068793. And thus, with three weights, we have procured a hydrometer fitted for
                    all liquors ſrom sether to a wort for a malt liquor of two barrels <hi
                        rend="italic">per</hi> quarter. Another weight, in the ſame progreſſion,
                    will extend the inſtrument to the ſtrongeſt wort that is brewed.</p>
                <p>This is a very commodious form of the inſtrument, and is now in very general uſe
                    for examining ſpirituous liquors, worts, ales, brines, and many ſuch articles of
                    commerce. But the diviſions of the ſcale are generally adapted to the queſtions
                    which naturally occur in the busineſe. Thus, in the commerce of ſtrong liquors,
                    it is uſual to eſtimate the article by the quantity of ſpirit of a certain
                    ſtrength which the liquor contains.— This we have been accuſtomed to call proof
                    spirit, and it is ſuch that a wine gallon weighs 7 pounds 12 ounces; and it is
                    by this ſtrength that the exciſe duties are levied. Therefore the diviſions on
                    the ſcale, and the weights which connect the ſucceſſive repetitions of the
                    ſcale, are made to expreſs at once the number of gallons or parts of a gallon of
                    proof ſpirits contained in a gallon of the liquor. Such inſtruments save all
                    trouble of calculation to the exciſeman or dealer ; but they limit the uſe of a
                    very delicate and expenſive inſtrument to a very narrow employment. It would be
                    much better to adhere to the expreſſion either of ſpecific gravity or of bulk ;
                    and then a very ſmall table, which could be compriſed in the ſmalleſt caſe for
                    the inſtrument, might rendeer to applicable to every kind of fluid.</p>
                <p>The reader cannot but have obſerved that the succeſſive weights, by which the
                    ſhort ſcale of the inſtrument is extended to a great range of ſpecific
                    gravities, do not increaſe by equal quantities. Each difference is the weight oſ
                    the liquor dilplaced by the graduated ſtem of the inſtrument when it is ſunk to
                    the top of the ſcale. It is a determined aliquot part of the whole weight of the
                    inſtrument ſo loaded, (in our example it is always <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 13</hi> th oſ it). It increaſes therefore in
                    the ſame proportion with the preceding weight of the loaded inſtrument. In
                    ſhort, both the ſucceſſive additions, and the whole weights of the loaded
                    inſtrument, are quantities in geometrical progreſſion ; and, in like manner, the
                    diviſions on the ſcale, if they correſpond to equal differences of ſpecific
                    gravity, muſt alſo be unequal.— This is not sufficiently attended to by the
                    makers ; and they commit an error here, which is very conſiderable when the
                    whole range of the inſtrument is great. For the value of one diviſion of the
                    ſcale, when the largeſt weight is on, is as much greater than its value, when
                    the inſtrument is not loaded at all, as the full loaded inſtrument is heavier
                    than the inſtrument unload, ed. No manner whatever of dividing the ſcale will
                    correſpond to equal differences of ſpecific gravity through the whole range with
                    different weights ; but if the diviſions are made to indicate equal <hi
                        rend="italic">proportions</hi> of gravity when the inſtrument is uſed
                    without a weight, they will indicate equal <hi rend="italic">proportions</hi>
                    throughout. This is evident from what we have been juſt now saying ; for the
                    proportion of the ſpecific gravities correſponding to any two immediately
                    ſucceeding weights is always the ſame.</p>
                <p>The beſt way, therefore, of conſtructing the inſtrument, ſo that the ſame
                    diviſions of the ſcale may be accurate in all its ſucceſſive repetitions with
                    the different weights, is to make theſe diviſions in geometrical progreſſion.
                    The correſponding ſpecific gravities will alſo be in geometric proportion. Theſe
                    being all inſerted in a table, we obtain them with no more trouble than by
                    inſpecting the ſcale which uſually accompanies the hydrometer. This table is of
                    the moſt eaſy conſtruction ; for the ratio of the ſucceſſive bulks and ſpecific
                    gravities being all equal, the differences of the logarithms are equal.</p>
                <p>This will be illuſtrated by applying it to the example already given of a
                    hydrometer extending from 0,73 to 1,068793 with three weights. This gives four
                    repetitions of the ſcale on the ſtem. Suppoſe this ſcale</p>
                <p>divided into 10 parts, we have 40 ſpecific gravities.</p>
                <p>Let theſe be indicated by the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, &amp; c. to 40. The mark 0 is
                    affixed to the top of the ſtem, and the diviſions downwards are marked 1, 2, 3,
                    &amp; c. the loweſt being 10. Theſe diviſions are eaſily determined. The ſtem,
                    which we may ſuppoſe 5 inches long, was ſuppoſed to be <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 10</hi> th of the capacity of the ball. It
                    may therefore be conſidered as the extremity of a rod of 11 times its length, or
                    55 inches ; and we muſt find nine mean proportionals between 50 and 55 inches.
                    Subtract each of theſe from 55 inches, and the remainders are the diſtances of
                    the points of divilion from 0, the top of the ſcale. The ſmalleſt weight is
                    marked 10, the next 20, and the third 30. If the inſtrument loaded with the
                    weight 20 sinks in ſome liquor to the mark 7, it indicates the ſpecific gravity
                    27, that is, the 27th of 40 mean proportionals between 0,73 and 1,068793, or
                    0,944242. To obtain all theſe intermediate ſpecific gravities, we have only to
                    ſubtract 9.8633229, the lo-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0671.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0665"/> garithm of 0,73. from that of 1.068793,viz.
                    0,0288937, and take 0.0041393, the 40th part of the difference. Multiply this by
                    1, 2, 3, &amp; c. and add the logarithm of 0,73 to each of the products. The
                    ſums are the logarithms of the ſpecific gravities required. Theſe will be found
                    to proceed ſo equably, that they may be interpolated ten times by a ſimple table
                    of proportional parts without the ſmalleſt ſensible error. Therefore the ſtem
                    may be divided into a hundred parts very ſenſible to the eye (each being nearly
                    the 20th of an inch), and 400 degrees of ſpecific gravity obtained within the
                    range, which is as near as we can examine this matter by any hydrometer. Thus
                    the ſpecific gravities correſponding to n⁰ 26, 27, 28, 29, are as follow :</p>

                <p>Nay, the trouble of inſpecting a table may be avoided, by forming on a ſcale the
                    logarithms of the numbers between 7300 and 1068,793, and placing along ſide of
                    it a ſcale of the ſame length divided into 400 equal parts, numbered from 0 to
                    400. Then, looking ſor the mark ſhown by the hydrometer on this ſcale of equal
                    parts, we see oppoſite to it the ſpecific gravity.</p>
                <p>We have been thus particular in the illuſtration of this mode of conſtruction,
                    becauſe <hi rend="italic">it</hi> is really a beautiful and commodious
                    inſtrument, which may be of great uſe both to the naturaliſt and to the man of
                    buſineſs. — A table may be compriſed in 20 octavo pages, which will contain the
                    ſpecific gravities of every fluid which can intereſt either, and anſwer every
                    queſtion relative to their admixture with as much preciſion as the obſervations
                    can be made. We therefore recommend it to our readers, and we recommend the very
                    example which we have given as one of the moſt convenient. The inſtrument need
                    not exceed eight inches in length, and may be contained in a pocket caſe of 2
                    inches broad and as many deep, which will alſo contain the ſcale, a thermometer,
                    and even the table for applying it to all fluids which have been examined.</p>
                <p>It is unfortunate that no graduated hydrometer can be made ſo eaſily for the
                    examination of the corrofive mineral acids<note anchored="true" n="2"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> It would be
                            worth while to try copper enamelled.</p></note>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi> Theſe muſt be made oſ glaſs, and we cannot depend
                    on the accurate cylindric form of any glaſs item. But if any ſuch can be
                    procured, the conſtruction is the ſame. The divided ſcale may either be on thin
                    paper palled on the inside of the ſtem, or it may be printed on the ſtem itſelf
                    from a plate, with ink made of a metallic calx, which will attach itſelf to the
                    glaſs with a very moderate heat. We would recommend common white enamel, or
                    arſenical glaſs, as the fitteſt material for the whole inſtrument; and the ink
                    uſed, in taking the impreſſion of the ſcale, may be the ſame that is uſed for
                    the low priced printing on Delft ware pottery. Firſt form the ſcale on the ſtem.
                    Then, having measured the ſolid contents of the graduated part as exactly as
                    poſſible, and determined on the general ſhape of the ball and counterpoiſe
                    below, calculate its ſize, ſo that it may be a little leſs than ten times that
                    of the</p>
                <p>ſtem. The glaſs blower can copy this very nearly, and join it to the ſtem. Then
                    make two brines or other liquors, which ſhall have ſpecific gravities in the
                    ratio of 10 to 11. Load the inſtrument ſo that it may link to 0 in the lighteſt.
                    When put into the heavieſt, it ſhould riſe to 10. If it does not riſe ſo high,
                    the immerſed part is too ſmall. Let the glaſs blower enlarge the ball of the
                    counterpoiſe a little. Repeat this trial till it be exact. Nothing now remains
                    but to form the weights : And here we obſerve, that when the inſtrument is to
                    have a very great range, as for examining all ſtates of the vitriolic acid, it
                    has a chance of being very tottering when loaded with the greateſt weight on the
                    top of ſo long a ſcale. To avoid this, Mr Quin and others have added ſome of.
                    their weights below.— But this will not suit the preſent conſtruction, becauſe
                    it will alter the proportion between the bulks of the ſtem and immerſed part.
                    Therefore let theſe weights consiſt of cylinders of metal ſmall enough to go
                    into the ſtem, and let them be ſoldered to the end of long wires, which will let
                    them go to the bottom, and leave a ſmall hook or ring at top. Theſe can lie
                    alongſide of the inſtrument in its caſe. This is indeed the beſt construction
                    for every hydrometer, becauſe it makes it incomparably more ſteady. The
                    inſtrument is poiſed by ſmall ſhot or mercury. But it will be much better to do
                    it with Newton’s fuſible metal (three parts of tin, five parts of lead, and
                    eight parts of biſmuth) in coarſe filings. When the exact quantity has been put
                    in, the inſtrument may be ſet in a veſſel of oil, and this kept on the fire till
                    all is completely melted. It ſoon freezes again, and remains fast. If this metal
                    is not to be had, let a few bits of ſealing-wax be added to the mercury or ſhot,
                    to make up the counterpoiſe. When heated, it will float a-top, and when it
                    freezes again it will keep all faſt. Thus we ſhall make a very complete and
                    cheap inſtrument.</p>
                <p>There is yet another method of examining the ſpecific gravities of fluids, firſt
                    propoſed by Dr Wilſon, late profeſſor of aſtronomy in the university oſ Glaſgow.
                    This is by a ſeries of ſmall glaſs bubbles, differing equally, or according to
                    ſome rule, from each other in ſpecific gravity, and each marked with its proper
                    number. When theſe are thrown into a fluid which is to be examined, all thoſe
                    which are heavier than the fluid will fall to the bottom. Then holding the
                    veſſel in the hand, or near a fire or candle, the fluid expands, and one of the
                    floating bubbles begins to sink. Its ſpecific gravity, therefore, was either
                    equal to, or a little leſs than, that of the fluid ; and the degree of the
                    thermometer, when it began to sink, will inform us how much it was deficient, if
                    we know the law of expansion of the liquor. Sets of theſe bubbles fitted for the
                    examination of ſpirituous liquors, with a little treatiſe ſhowing the manner of
                    uſing them, and calculating by the thermometer, are made by Mr Brown, an
                    ingenious artiſt of Glaſgow, and are often used by the dealers in spirits, being
                    found both accurate and expeditious.</p>
                <p>Alſo, though a bubble or two ſhould be broken, the ſtrength of ſpirits may easily
                    be had by means of the remainder, unleſs two or three in immediate ſucceſſion<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0672.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0666"/> be wanting :
                    for a liquor which answers to N⁰ 4 will sink N <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 2
                    by heating it a few degrees, and therefore N⁰ 3 may be ſpared. This is a great
                    advantage in ordinary buſineſs. A nice hydrometer is not only an expenſive
                    inſtrument, but exceedingly delicate, being ſo very thin. If broken or even
                    bruiſed, it is uſeleſs, and can hardly be repaired except by the very maker.</p>
                <p>As the only queſtion here is, to determine how many gallons of exciſe proof
                    ſpirits is contained in a quantity of liquor, the artiſt has conſtructed this
                    ſeries of bubbles in the ſimpleſt manner poſſible, by previouſly making 40 or 50
                    mixtures of ſpirits and water, and then adjuſting the bubbles to theſe mixtures.
                    In ſome ſets the number on each bubble is the number of gallons of proof ſpirits
                    contained in 100 gallons of the liquor. In other ſets the number on each bubble
                    expreſſes the gallons of water which will make a liquor of this ſtrength, if
                    added to 14 gallons of alcohol. Thus, if a liquor anſwers to N⁰ 4, then 4
                    gallons of water added to 14 gallons of alcohol will make a liquor of this
                    ſtrength. The firſt is the beſt method ; for we ſhould be miſtaken in ſuppoſing
                    that 18 gallons, which anſwer to N⁰ 4, contains exactly 14 gallons of alcohol :
                    it contains more than 14, for a reaſon to be given by and by.</p>
                <p>By examining the ſpecific gravity of bodies, the philoſopher has made ſome very
                    curious diſcoveries. The moſt remarkable of theſe is the change which the
                    denſity of bodies suffers by mixture. It is a moſt reaſonable expectation, that
                    when a cubic foot of one ſubſtance is mixed <hi rend="italic">any how</hi> with
                    a cubic foot of another, the bulk of the mixture will be two cubic feet ; and
                    that 8 gallons of water joined to 18 gallons of oil will fill a veſſel of 36
                    gallons. Accordingly this was never doubted ; and even Archimedes, the moſt
                    ſcrupulous of mathematicians, proceeded on this ſupposition in the ſolution of
                    his famous problem, the diſcovery of the proportion of ſilver and gold in a
                    mixture of both. He does not even mention it as a poſtulate that <hi
                        rend="italic">may</hi> be granted him, ſo much did he conceive it to be an
                    axiom. Yet a little reflection ſeems sufficient to make it doubtful and to
                    require examination. A box filled with muſket-balls will receive a conſiderable
                    quantity of ſmall ſhot, and after this a conſiderable quantity of fine sand, and
                    after this a conſiderable quantity of water. Something like this might happen in
                    the admixture of bodies of porous texture. But ſuch ſubſtances as metals, glaſs,
                    and fluids, where no diſcontinuity of parts can be perceived, or was suſpected,
                    ſeem free ſrom every chance oſ this kind oſ introſuſception. Lord Bacon,
                    however, without being a naturaliſt or mathematician <hi rend="italic">ex
                        professo,</hi> interred from the mobility of fluids that they consiſted of
                    diſcrete particles, which muſt have pores interpoſed, whatever be their figure.
                    And if we aſcribe the different denſities, or other ſenſible qualities, to
                    difference in ſize or figure of thoſe particles, it muſt frequently happen that
                    the ſmaller particles will be lodged in the interſtices between the larger, and
                    thus contribute to the weight of the ſenſible maſs without increaſing its bulk.
                    He therefore ſuspects that mixtures will be in general leſs bulky than the ſum
                    of their ingredients.</p>
                <p>Accordingly, the examination of this queſtion was one of the firſt employments of
                    the Royal Socſety of London, and long before its inſtitution had occupied the
                    attention of the gentlemen who afterwards composed it. The regiſter of the
                    Society’s early meetings</p>
                <p>contains many experiments on this ſubject, with mixtures of gold and ſilver, of
                    other metals, and of various fluids, examined by the hydroſtatical balance of Mr
                    Boyle. Dr Hooke made a prodigious number, chiefly on articles of commerce, which
                    were unfortunately loſt in the fire of London.</p>
                <p>It was ſoon found, however, that Lord Bacon’s conjecture had been well founded,
                    and that bodies changed their density very ſenſibly in many caſes. In general,
                    it was found that bodies which had a ſtrong chemical affinity increaſed in
                    denſity, and that their admixture was accompanied with heat.</p>
                <p>By this dilcovery it is manifeſt that Archimedes had not ſolved the problem of
                    detecting the quantity of silver mixed with the gold in King Hiero’s crown, and
                    that the phyſical ſolution of it requires experiments made on all the kinds of
                    matter that are mixed together. We do not find that this has been done to this
                    day, although we may affirm that there are few queſtions of more importance. It
                    is a very curious fact in chemiſtry, and it would be moſt deſirable to be able
                    to reduce it to ſome general laws ; For inſtance, to aſcertain what is the
                    proportion of two ingredients which produces the greateſt change of denſity.
                    This is important in the ſcience of phyſics, becauſe it gives us considerable
                    information as to the mode of action of thoſe natural powers or forces by which
                    the particles of tangible matter are united. If this introſuſception,
                    concentration, compenetration, or by whatever name it be called, were a mere
                    reception of the particles of one ſubſtance into the interſtices of thoſe of
                    another, it is evident that the greateſt concentration would be obſerved when a
                    ſmall quantity of the recipiend is mixed with, or diſſeminated through, a great
                    quantity of the other. It is thus that a ſmall quantity of fine fand will be
                    received into the interſtices of a quantity of ſmall ſhot, and will increaſe the
                    weight of the bagful, without increaſing its bulk. The caſe is nowiſe different
                    when a piece of freeſtone has grown heavier by imbibing or abſorbing a quantity
                    of water. If more than a certain quantity of fand has been added to the ſmall
                    ſhot, it is no longer concealed. In like manner, various quantities of water may
                    combine with a maſs of clay, and increaſe its ſize and weight alike. All this is
                    very conceivable, occaſioning no difficulty,</p>
                <p>But this is not the caſe in any of the mixtures we are now conſidering. In all
                    theſe, the firſt additions of either of the two ſubſtances produce but an
                    inconſiderable change of general denſity ; and it is in general moſt remarkable,
                    whether it be condensation or rarefaction, when the two ingredients are nearly
                    of equabulks. We can illuſtrate even this difference, by reflecting on the
                    imbibition of water by vegetable ſolids, ſuch as timber. Some kinds of wood,
                    have their weight much more increaſed than their bulks ; other kinds of wood are
                    more enlarged in bulk than in weight. The like happens in grains. This is
                    curious, and ſhows in the moſt unqueſtionable manner that the particles of
                    bodies are not in contact, but are kept together by forces which act at a
                    diſtance. For this diſtance between the centres of the particles is moſt
                    evidently ſuſceptible of variation ; and this variation is occaſioned. by the
                    introduction of another ſubſtance, which, by acting on the particles by
                    attraction or repulſion, diminiſhes or increaſes their mutual actions, and makes
                    new diſtances<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0673.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0667"/>
                    neceſſary for bringing all things again into equilibrium. We refer the curious
                    reader to the ingenious theory of the Abbé Boſcovſeh for an excellent
                    illuſtration of this ſubject (<hi rend="italic">Theor. Phil. Nat.</hi> de
                    Solutione Chemica).</p>
                <p>This queſtion is no leſs important to the man of buſineſs. Till we know the
                    condenſation of thoſe metals by mixture, we cannot tell the quantity of alloy in
                    gold and ſilver by means of their ſpecific gravity ; nor can we tell the
                    quantity of pure alcohol in any ſpirituous liquor, or that of the valuable ſalt
                    in any ſolution of it. For want of this knowledge, the dealers in gold and
                    ſilver are obliged to have recourſe to the tedious and difficult teſt of the
                    aſſay, which cannot be made in all places or by all men. It is therefore much to
                    be wiſhed, that ſome persons would inſtitute a ſeries of experiments in the moſt
                    intereſting caſes : for it muſt be obſerved, that this change of denſity is not
                    always a ſmall matter ; it is ſometimes very conſiderable and paradoxical. A
                    remarkable inſtance may be given of it in the mixture of braſs and tin for
                    bells, great guns, optical speculums, &amp; c. The ſpecific gravity of caſt
                    braſs is nearly 8,oc6, and that of tin is nearly 7,363. If two parts of braſs be
                    mixed with one of tin, the ſpecific gravity is 8,917 ; whereas, if each had
                    retained its former bulk, the ſpecific gravity would have been only 7,7.93</p>
                <p>2×8,006+7,363</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">= 3 A</hi> mixture of equal parts</p>
                <p>ſhould have the ſpecific gravity 7,684 ; but it is 8,441. A mixture of two parts
                    tin with one part braſs, inſtead of being 7,577, is 8,027.</p>
                <p>In all theſe caſes there is a great increaſe of ſpecific gravity, and
                    conſequently a great condenſation of parts or contraction of bulk. The firſt
                    mixture of eight cubic inches of braſs, for inſtance, with four cubic inches of
                    tin, does not produce 12 cubic inches of bell-metal, but only 10 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> nearly, having
                    ſhrunk <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>. It would
                    appear that the diſtances of the braſs particles are moſt affected, or perhaps
                    it is the braſs that receives the tin into its pores ; for we find that the
                    condenſations in theſe mixtures are nearly proportional to the quantities of the
                    braſs in the mixtures. It is remarkable that this mixture with the lighteſt of
                    all metals has made a compoſition more heavy and denſe than braſs can be made by
                    any hammering.</p>
                <p>The moſt remarkable inſtance occurs in mixing iron with platina. If 10 cubic
                    inches of iron are mixed with of platina, the bulk of the compound is only 9 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 3</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> inches. The iron
                    therefore has not ſimply received the platina into its pores : its own particles
                    are brought nearer together. There are ſimilar reſults in the ſolution of
                    turbith mineral, and of ſome other ſalts, in water. The water, inſtead of riſing
                    in the neck of the veſſel, when a ſmall quantity of the ſalt has been added to
                    it, ſinks conſiderably, and the two ingredients occupy leſs room than the water
                    did alone.</p>
                <p>The ſame thing happens in the mixture of water with other fluids and different
                    fluids with each other : But we are not able to trace any general rule that is
                    obſerved with abſolute preciſion. In moſt caſes of fluids the greateſt
                    condenſation happens when the bulks of the ingredients are nearly equal. Thus,
                    in the mixture of alcohol and water, we have the greateſt condensation when 16
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ounces of
                    alcohol are mixed with 20 ounces of water, and the condenſation is about <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 30</hi> of the whole bulk
                    of the ingredients. It is extremely va</p>
                <p>rious in different ſubſtances, and no claſſification of them can be made in this
                    reſpect,</p>
                <p>A diſsertation has been publiſhed on this ſubject by Dr Hahn of Vienna, intitled
                        <hi rend="italic">De Efficacia Mixtionis in mutandis Corporum
                        Voluminibus,</hi> in which all the remarkable inſtances of the variation of
                    denſity have been collected. All that we can do (as we have no directing
                    principle) is to record ſuch inſtances as are of chief importance, being
                    articles of commerce.</p>
                <p>The firſt that occurs to us is the mixtures oſ alcohol and water in the
                    compoſition of ſpirituous liquors. This has been conſidered by many with great
                    care. The moſt ſcrupulous examination of this, or perhaps of any mixture, has
                    been lately made by Dr Blagden (now Sir Charles Blagden) of the Royal Society,
                    on the requiſition of the Board of Exciſe. He has publiſhed an account of the
                    examination in the Philoſophical Tranſactions of London in 1791 and 1792. We
                    ſhall give an account of it under the article <hi rend="italic smallcaps">
                        Spirituous</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Liquors ;</hi> and at preſent only ſelect one column, in order
                    to ſhow the condenſation. The alcohol was almoſt the ſtrongeſt that can be
                    produced, and its ſpecific gravity, when of the temperature 60⁰, was 0,825. The
                    whole mixtures were of the ſame temperature.</p>
                <p>Column I. contains the pounds, ounces, or other meaſures by weight, of alcohol in
                    the mixture. Column 2. contains the pounds or ounces of water. Column 3. is the
                    ſum of the bulks of the ingredients, the bulk of a pound or ounce of water being
                    accounted 1. Column 4. is the obſerved ſpecific gravity of the mixture, taken
                    from Dr Blagden's diſſertation. Column 5. is the ſpecific gravity which would
                    have been obſerved if the ingredients had each retained its own ſpecific
                    gravity. This we calculated by dividing the ſum oſ the two numbers of the firſt
                    and ſecond columns by the correſponding number of the third. Column 6. is the
                    difference of column 4. and column 5. and exhibits the condenſation.</p>

                <p>It is to be remarked, that the condenſation is greateſt when 16 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ounces of alcohol
                    have been added to 20 of water, and the condenſation is 2633/91835, or nearly
                        <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 30</hi> th of the
                    computed denſity. Since the ſpecific gravity of alcohol is 0,825, it is evident
                    that 16 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> ounces of
                    alcohol and 20 ounces of water have equal bulks. So that the condenſation is
                    greateſt when the ſubſtances are mixed in equal volumes ; and 18 gallons of
                    alcohol mixed with 18 gallons of water will produce not 36 gallons of ſpirits,
                    but 35 only.</p>
                <p>We may alſo obſerve, that this is the mixture to which our revenue-laws refer,
                    declaring it to be <hi rend="italic">one to six</hi> or <hi rend="italic">one in
                        ſeven</hi> under proof, and to weigh 7 pounds 13 ounce per gallon. This
                    proportion was probably ſelected as the moſt eaſily compoſed, viz. by mixing
                    equal meaſures of water and of the ſtrongeſt ſpirit which the known proceſſes of
                    diſtillation could produce. Its ſpecific gravity is 0,939 very nearly.</p>
                <p>We muſt conſider this elaborate examination oſ the mixture of water and alcohol
                    as a ſtandard ſeries of experiments, to which appeal may always be made, whether
                    for the purpoſes of ſcience or of trade. The regularity of the progreſſion is ſo
                    great, that in the column which we have examined, viz. that for temperature 60⁰,
                    the greateſt anomaly does not amount to one part in six thouſand. The form of
                    the ſeries is alſo very judiciouſly choſen for the purpoſes of ſcience. It would
                    perhaps have been more directly ſtereometrical had the proportions of the
                    ingredients been ſtated in bulks, which are more immediately connected with
                    denſity. But the author has aſſigned a very cogent reaſon for his choice, viz.
                    that the proportion of bulks varies by a change of temperature, becauſe the
                    water and ſpirits follow different laws in their expanſion by heat.</p>
                <p>This is a proper opportunity for taking notice of a miſtake which is very
                    generally made in the conduirons drawn from experiments of this kind. Equal
                    additions of the ſpirit or water produce a ſeries of ſpecific gravities, which
                    decreaſe or increaſe by differences continually diminiſhing. Hence it is
                    inferred that there is a contraction of bulk. Even Dr Lewis, one of our</p>
                <p>moſt accompliſhed naturaliſts, advances this poſition, in a diſſertation on the
                    pot-aſh of America ; and it considerably affects his method for eſtimating the
                    ſtrength of the pot-aſh leys. Rut that it is a miſtake, appears plainly from
                    this, that although we add for ever equal quantities of the ſpirits, we ſhall
                    never produce a mix <hi rend="italic">ture</hi> which has as ſmall a ſpecific
                    gravity as alcohol. Therefore the ſeries of ſucceſſive gravities muſt
                    approximate to this without end, like the ordinates of a hyperbolic curve
                    referred to its aſſymptote.</p>
                <p>That this may appear in the moſt general terms, let <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
                    repreſent the weight of the confiant quantity of water in the mixture, and let
                        <hi rend="italic">a</hi> be the weight of the ſmall addition oſ ſpirits.
                    Alſo let <hi rend="italic">w</hi> repreſent the bulk of this quantity of water,
                    and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the bulk of the ſmall addition of alcohol. The
                    weight of the mixture is <hi rend="italic">w +a,</hi> and its bulk is <hi
                        rend="italic">w + b,</hi> and its ſpecific gravity is w + a/ w +b</p>
                <p>If we now add a ſecond equal quantity of ſpirits, the weight will be w <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">+ 2a, a</hi> nd if the ſpirit retains its denſity
                    unchanged, the bulk will be w+2b, and the ſpecific</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">w+2a</hi></p>
                <p>gravity is w + 2b and after any number <hi rend="italic">m</hi> of ſuch</p>
                <p>equal additions of ſpirits, the ſpecific gravity will be w + ma</p>
                <p>Divide the numerator of this fraction by its</p>
                <p>denominator, and the quotient or ſpecific gravity will <hi rend="italic">m×
                        a—b</hi></p>
                <p>be 1 + w + mb. This conſiſts of the conſtant part 1,</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">m (a — b)</hi></p>
                <p>and the variable part. We need attend only</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">w + mb.</hi></p>
                <p>to this part. If its denominator were conſtant, it is plain that the ſucceſſive
                    ſpecific gravities would have</p>
                <p>equal differences, each being = becauſe <hi rend="italic">m</hi></p>
                <p>w + mb,</p>
                <p>increaſes by the continual addition of an unit, and <hi rend="italic">a — b</hi>
                    is a conſtant quantity. But the denominator <hi rend="italic">w + mb</hi>
                    continually increaſes, and therefore the value of the</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">a—b</hi></p>
                <p>fraction continually diminiſhes.</p>
                <p>Therefore the gradual diminution of the increments or decrements of ſpecific
                    gravity, by equal additions of one ingredient to a conſtant meaſure of the
                    other, is not of itſelf an indication of a change of denſity of either of the
                    ingredients ; nor proves that in very diluted mixtines a greater proportion of
                    one ingredient is abſorbed or lodged in the interſtices of the other, as is
                    generally imagined. This muſt be aſcertained by comparing each ſpecific gravity
                    with the gravity expreſſed by 1 + w+ <hi rend="italic">m (a—b)</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">w + mb</hi></p>
                <p>This ſeries of ſpecific gravities reſembles ſuch a numerical ſeries as the
                    following, 1 ; ; 1,156;</p>
                <p>1,163 ; 1, + 69 ; &amp; c. the terms of which alſo conſiſt of the conſtant
                    integer 1, and the decimal fractions 0,156;</p>

                <p>0,163 ; 0,169 ; &amp; c. The fraction w + mb expreſſes</p>

                        >d =</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">w + mb</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">m a - w d</hi></p>
                <p>This will give us <hi rend="italic">b =</hi> Now <hi rend="italic">a</hi> is the
                    weight</p>
                <p>of the added ingredient, and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is the variable part of the
                    ſpecific gravity obſerved ; and thus we learn whe-<pb

                    bulk of the added ingredient, ſuffers any change. We ſhall have occaſion by and
                    by to reſume the consideration of this queſtion, which is of the firſt moment in
                    the theory of ſpecific gravities, and has great influence in many tranſactions
                    of commerce.</p>
                <p>This ſeries of ſpecific gravities is not ſo well fitted for commercial
                    tranſactions. In theſe the uſual queſtion is, how many gallons oſ alcohol is
                    there in a caſk, or ſome number of gallons of ſpirit ? and it is more directly
                    anſwered by means of a table, formed by mixing the ingredients in aliquant parts
                    of one conſtant bulk. The following table, conſtructed from the experiments of
                    Mr Briſſon of the academy of Paris, and publiſhed in the Memoirs for 1769, is
                    therefore inſerted.</p>

                </table>
                <p>In this table the whole quantity of ſpirituous liquor is always the ſame. The
                    firſt column is the number of meaſures (gallons, pints, inches, &amp; c.) of
                    water in the mixture ; and column 2d gives the meaſures of alcohol. Column 3d is
                    the ſpecific gravity which was obſerved by Mr Briſſon. Column 4th is the
                    ſpecific gravity which would have been obſerved if the ſpirits, or water, or
                    both, had retained their ſpecific density unchanged. And the 5th column marks
                    the augmentation of ſpecific gravity or density in parts of 10,000. A 6th column
                    is added, ſhowiag the bulk of the 16 cubic meaſures of the two ingredients. Each
                    meaſure may be conceived as the 16th part of 10,000, or 625 ; and we may ſuppoſe
                    them cubic inches, pints, gallons, or any solid meaſure.</p>
                <p>This table ſcarcely differs from Sir Charles Blagden’s ; and the very ſmall
                    difference that may be obſerved, ariſes from Mr Briſſon’s having uſed an alcohol
                    not ſo completely rectified. Its ſpecific gravity is 0,8371, whereas the other
                    was only 0,8250.</p>
                <p>Here it appears more diſtinctly that the condenſation is greateſt when the two
                    ingredients are of equal bulk.</p>
                <p>Perhaps this ſeries of ſpecific gravities is as declarative as the other, whether
                    or not there is a change of density induced on either of the ingredients. The
                    whole bulk being always the ſame, it is plain that the</p>
                <p>ſucceſſive equal additions to one of the ingredients is a ſucceſſive equal
                    abſtraction of the other. The change produced, therefore, in the weight of the
                    whole, is the difference between the weight of the ingredient which is taken out
                    and the weight of the equal meaſure of the other which ſupplies its place.
                    Therefore, if neither ingredient changes its density by mixture, the weights of
                    the mixtures will be in arithmetical progreſſion. If they are not, there is a
                    variation of density in one or both the ingredients.</p>
                <p>We ſee this very clearly in the mixtures of water and alcohol. The firſt ſpecific
                    gravity differs from the ſecond by 156, and the laſt differs from the preceding
                    by no more than 81. Had neither of the densities changed, the common difference
                    would have been 102. We obſerve alſo, that the augmentation of ſpecific gravity,
                    by the ſucceſſive addition of a meaſure of water, grows leſs and leſs till 12
                    meaſures of water is mixed with 4 of alcohol, when the augmentation is only 58,
                    and then it increaſes again to 81.</p>
                <p>It alſo appears, that the addition of one meaſure of water to a quantity of
                    alcohol produces a greater change of density than the mixture of one meaſure of
                    alcohol to a quantity of water. Hence ſome conclude, that the water diſappears
                    by being lodged in the interſtices of the ſpirit. But it is more agreeable to
                    the juſtest notions which we can form of the internal conſtitution of tangible
                    bodies to ſuppoſe that the particles of water diminiſh the diſtances between the
                    particles of alcohol by their ſtrong attractions, and that this diminution
                    (exceedingly minute in itſelf ) becomes ſenſible on account oſ the great number
                    or particles whoſe diſtances are thus diminiſhed. This is merely a probability
                    founded on this, that it would require a much greater diminution of diſtances if
                    it was the particles of water which had their diſtances thus diminiſhed. But the
                    greater probability is, that the condenſation takes place in both.</p>
                <p>We have been ſo particular in our conſideration of this mixture, becauſe the law
                    of variation of density has, in this inſtance, been aſcertained with ſuch
                    precision by the elaborate examination of Sir Charles Blagden, ſo that it may
                    ſerve as an example of what happens in almoſt every mixture of bodies. It merits
                    a still farther diſcuſſion, becauſe it is intimately connected with the action
                    of the corpuſcular forces; and an exact knowledge of the variations of diſtance
                    between the particles will go far to aſcertain the law of action of theſe
                    forces. But the limits of a Work like this will not permit us to dwell longer on
                    this ſubject. We proceed therefore to give another uſeful table.</p>
                <p>The vitriolic or ſulphuric acid is of extensive uſe in manufactures under the
                    name of oil of vitriol. Its value depends entirely on the ſaline ingredient, and
                    the water is merely a vehicle for the acid. This, being much denſer than water,
                    affects its ſpecific gravity, and thus gives us a method of aſcertaining its
                    ſtrength.</p>
                <p>The ſtrongeſt oil of vitriol that can be eaſily manufactured contains 612 <hi

                <p>Here is obſerved a much greater condenſation than in the mixture of alcohol and
                    water. But we cannot aſſign the proportion of ingredients which produces the
                    greateſt condenſation ; becauſe we cannot, in any caſe, say what is the
                    proportion of the ſaline and watery ingredients. The ſtrongeſt oil of vitriol is
                    already a watery ſolution; and it is by a conſiderable and uncertain detour that
                    Mr Kirwan has aſſigned the proportion of 612 and 388 nearly. If this be the true
                    ratio, it is unlike every other ſolution that we are acquainted with ; for in
                    all ſolutions of ſalts, the ſalt occupies leſs room in its liquid form than it
                    did when ſolid ; and here it would be greatly the reverſe.</p>
                <p>This ſolution is remarkable alſo for the copious emergence of heat in its
                    dilutions with more water. This has been aſcribed to the great ſuperiority of
                    water in its capacity for heat ; but there are facts which render this very
                    doubtful. A veſſel of water, and another of oil of vitriol, being brought ſrom a
                    cold room into a warm one, they both imbibe heat, and riſe in their temperature
                    ; and the water employs nearly the ſame time to attain the temperature of the
                    room.</p>
                <p>Aquafortis or nitrous acid is another fluid very much employed in commerce ; ſo
                    that it is of importance to aſcertain the relation between its ſaline ſtrength
                    and its ſpecific gravity. We owe alſo to Mr Kirwan a table for this purpoſe.</p>

                <p>There is not the ſame uniformity in the denſities of this acid in its different
                    ſtates of dilution. This ſeems owing to the variable proportion of the
                    deleterious and vital air which compose this acid. It is more denſe in</p>
                <p>proportion as it contains more of the latter ingredient.</p>
                <p>The proportions of the aeriform ingredients of the muriatic acid are ſo very
                    variable, and ſo little under our command, that we cannot frame tables of its
                    ſpecific gravity which would enable us to judge of its ſtrength.</p>
                <p>It is a general property of theſe acids, that they are more expanſible by heat as
                    they are more concentrated.</p>
                <p>There is another claſs of fluids which it would be of great conſequence to reduce
                    to ſome rules with reſpect to ſpecific gravity, namely, the ſolutions oſ ſalts,
                    gums, and reſins. It is intereſting to the philoſopher to know in what manner
                    ſalts are contained in theſe watery ſolutions, and to diſcover the relation
                    between their ſtrength and denſity ; and to the man of buſineſs it would be a
                    moſt deſirable thing to have a criterion of the quantity of ſalt in any brine,
                    or of extractible matter in a decoction. It would be equally deſirable to thoſe
                    who are to purchaſe them as to thoſe who manufacture or employ them. Perhaps we
                    might aſcertain in this way the value of ſugar, depending on the quantity of
                    ſweetening matter which it contains ; a thing which at preſent reſts on the
                    vague determination of the eye or palate. It would therefore be doing a great
                    ſervice to the public, if ſome intelligent perſon would undertake a train of
                    experiments with this view. Accuracy alone is required ; and it may be left to
                    the philoſophers to compare the facts, and draw the conſequences reſpecting the
                    internal arrangement of the particles.</p>
                <p>One circumſtance in the ſolution of ſalts is very general ; and we are inclined,
                    for ſerious reaſons, to think it univerſal: this is a diminution of bulk. This
                    indeed in ſome ſalts is inconſiderable. Sedative ſalt, for inſtance, hardly
                    ſhows any diminution, and might be conſidered as an exception, were it not the
                    ſingle inſtance. This circumſtance, and ſome conſiderations connected with our
                    notions of this kind of ſolution, diſpoſe us to think that this ſalt differs in
                    contraction from others only in degree, and that there is ſome, though it was
                    not ſenſible, in the experiments hitherto made.</p>
                <p>Theſe experiments, indeed, have not been numerous. Thoſe of Mr Achard of Berlin,
                    and of Dr Richard Watſon of Cambridge, are perhaps the only ones of which we
                    have a deſcriptive narration, by which we can judge of the validity of the
                    inferences drawn from them. The ſubject is not ſuſceptible of much accuracy ;
                    for salts in their ſolid form are ſeldom free from cavities and ſhivery
                    interſtices, which do not admit the water on their firſt immerſion, and thereby
                    appear of greater bulk when we attempt to meaſure their ſpecific gravity by
                    weighing them in fluids which do not diſſolve them, ſuch as ſpirits of
                    turpentine. They alſo attach to themſelves, with conſiderable tenacity, a
                    quantity of atmoſpheric air, which merely adheres, but makes no part of their
                    compoſition. This eſcapes in the act of ſolution, being ſet at liberty by the
                    ſtronger affinity of the water. Sal gem, however, and a few others, may be very
                    accurately meaſured; and in theſe inſtances the degree of contraction is very
                    conſtant.</p>
                <p>The following experiments of Dr Watſon appear to us the moſt inſtructive as to
                    this circumſtance. A glaſs veſſel was uſed, having a ſlender cylindrical neck,
                    and holding 67 ounces of pure water when filled to a cer<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0677.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0671"/>tain mark. The
                    neck above this mark had a ſcale of equal parts pasted on it. It was filled to
                    the mark with water. Twenty-four penny weights of ſalt were thrown into it as
                    ſpeedily as poſſible, and the bulk of the ſalt was meaſured by the elevation of
                    the water. Every thing was attended to which could retard the immediate
                    ſolution, that the error ariſing from the ſolution of the firſt particles,
                    before the reſt could be put in, might be as ſmall as poſſible ; and in order
                    that both the abſolute bulk and its variations might be obtained by ſome known
                    ſcale, 24 pennyweights of water were put in. This raiſed the ſurface 58 parts of
                    the ſcale. Now we know exactly the bulk of 24 pennyweights of pure water. lt is
                    2,275 cubic inches ; and thus we obtain every thing in abſolute meaſures : And
                    by comparing the bulk of each ſalt, both at its firſt immerſion and after its
                    complete ſolution, we obtain its ſpecific gravity, and the change made on it in
                    paſſing from a ſolid to a fluid form. The following table is an abſtract of
                    theſe experiments. The firſt column of numbers is the elevation of the ſurface
                    immediately after immerſion ; the ſecond gives the elevation when the ſalt is
                    completely diſſolved ; and the third and fourth columns are the ſpecific
                    gravities of the ſalts in theſe two ſtates.</p>

                <p>The inspection of this liſt naturally ſuggeſts two ſtates of the caſe as
                    particularly intereſting to the philoſopher studying the theory of ſolution. The
                    firſt ſtate is when the lixivium approaches to ſaturation. In the very point of
                    saturation any addition of ſalt retains its bulk unchanged. In diluted brines,
                    we ſhall ſee that the denſity of the fluid ſalt is greater, and gradually
                    diminiſhes as we add more ſalt. It is an important queſtion, Whether this
                    diminution goes on continually, till the fluid denſity of the ſalt is the ſame
                    with its ſolid denſity ? or, Whether there is an abrupt paſſage from ſome</p>
                <p>degree of the one to the fixed degree of the other, as we obſerve in the freezing
                    of iron, the ſetting of ſtucco, and ſome other inſtances ?</p>
                <p>The other intereſting ſtate is that of extreme dilution, when the differences
                    between the ſucceſſive densities bear a great proportion to the denſities
                    themſelves, and thus enable the mathematician to aſcertain with ſome preciſion
                    the variations of corpuſcular force, in conſequence of a variation of diſtance
                    between the particles. The ſketch of an inveſtigation of this important queſtion
                    given by Boſcovich, in his Theory of Natural Philoſophy, is very promiſing, and
                    ſhould incite the philoſophical chemiſt to the ſtudy. The firſt thing to be done
                    is to compare the law of ſpecific gravity ; that is, the relation between the
                    ſpecific gravity and quantity of ſalt held in ſolution.</p>
                <p>Wiſhing to make this work as uſeful as poſſible, we have ſearched for
                    experiments, and trains of experiments, on the denſity of the many brines which
                    make important articles of commerce ; but we were mortified by the ſcantineſs of
                    the information, and diſappointed in our hopes of being able to combine the
                    detached obſervations, ſuited to the immediate views of their authors, in ſuch a
                    manner as to deduce from them ſcales (as they may be called) of their ſtrength.
                    We rarely found theſe detached obſervations attended with circumſtances which
                    would connect them with others ; and there was frequently ſuch a diſcrepancy,
                    nay oppoſition, in ſerieſes of experiments made for aſcertaining the relation
                    between the denſity and the ſtrength, that we could not obtain general
                    principles which enable us to conſtruct tables of ſtrength <hi rend="italic">à
                        priori.</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Lambert, one of the firſt mathematicians and philoſophers of Europe, in a
                    diſſertation in the Berlin Memoirs (1762), gives a narration of experiments on
                    the brines of common ſalt, from which he deduces a very great condensation,
                    which he attributes to an abſorption in the weak brines of the salt, or a
                    lodgement of its particles in the interſtſees of the particles oſ water. Mr
                    Achard of the ſame academy, in 1785, gives a very great liſt of experiments on
                    the bulks of various brines, made in a different way, which ſhow no ſuch
                    introſusception ; and Dr Watson, formerly regius profeſſor of chemiſtry at
                    Cambridge, and now biſhop of Landaff, thinks this confirmed by experiments which
                    he narrates in his Chemical Eſſays. We ſee great reaſon for heſitating our
                    aſſent to either side, and do not think the experiments deciſive. We incline to
                    Mr Lambert’s opinion ; for this reaſon, that in the ſucceſſive dilutions of oil
                    of vitriol and aquafortis there is a moſt evident and remarkable condenſation.
                    Now what are these but brines, of which we have not been able to get the ſaline
                    ingredient in a ſeparate form ? The experiments of Mr Achard and Dr Watſon were
                    made in ſuch a way that a ſingle grain in the meaſurement bore too great a
                    proportion to the whole change of specific gravity. At the ſame time, ſome of Dr
                    Watſon’s are ſo ſimple in their nature that it is very difficult to with hold
                    the aſſent.</p>
                <p>In this ſtate of uncertainty, in a ſubject which ſeems to us to be of public
                    importance, we thought it our duty to undertake a train of experiments to which
                    recourſe may always be had. Works like this are ſeldom conſidered as ſources of
                    original information ; and it is thought sufficient when the know<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0678.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0672"/> ledge already
                    diffused is judſicously compiled. But a due reſpect for the public, and
                    gratitude for the very honourable reception hitherto given to our labours,
                    induce us to exert ourſelves with honeſt zeal to merit the continuance of public
                    favour. We aſſure our readers that the experiments were made with care, and on
                    quantities sufficiently large to make the unavoidable irregularities in ſuch
                    caſes quite inſignificant. The law of denſity was aſcertained in each ſubſtance
                    in two ways. We diſſolved different portions of ſalt in the ſame quantity of
                    water, and examined the ſpecific gravity of the brine by weighing it in a vessel
                    with a narrow neck. The portions of ſalt were each of them one- eighth of what
                    would make a nearly ſaturated solution of the temperature 55. We did not make
                    the brine ſtronger, that there might be no riſk of a precipitation in form of
                    cryſtals. We conſidered the ſpecific gravities as the ordinates of a curve, of
                    which the abscissæ were the numbers of ounces of dry ſalt contained in a cubic
                    foot of the brine. Having thus obtained eight ordinates correſponding to 1, 2,
                    3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 portions of ſalt, the ordinates or ſpecific gravities for
                    every other proportion of ſalt were had by the uſual methods of
                    interpoſition.</p>
                <p>The other method was, by firſt making a brine nearly ſaturated, in which the
                    proportion of salt and water was exactly determined. We then took out one-eighth
                    of the brine, and filled up the veſſel with water, taking care that the mixture
                    ſhould be complete ; for which purpoſe, beſides agitation, the diluted brine was
                    allowed to remain 24 hours before weighing. Taking out one-eighth of the brine
                    alſo takes out one eighth of the ſalt ; ſo that the proportion of ſalt and water
                    in the diluted brine was known. It was now weighed, and thus we determined the
                    ſpecific gravity for a new proportion of ſalt and water.</p>
                <p>We then took out one-ſeventh of the brine. It is evident that this takes out
                    one-eighth of the original quantity of ſalt ; an abſtraction equal to the
                    former. We filled the veſſel with water with the ſame precautions ; and in the
                    ſame manner we proceeded till there remained only one-eighth of the original
                    quantity of ſalt.</p>
                <p>The ſpecific gravities by theſe two methods agreed extremely well. In the very
                    deliqueſcent ſalts the firſt method exhibited ſome ſmall irregularities, ariſing
                    from the unequal quantities of water which they had imbibed from the atmoſphere.
                    We therefore confided moſt in the experiments made with diluted brines.</p>
                <p>That the reader may judge of the authority of the tables which we ſhall insert,
                    we ſubmit to his inſpection one ſeries of experiments.</p>
                <p>Two thouſand one hundred and eighty-eight grains of very pure and dry (but not
                    decrepitated) common ſalt, prepared in large cryſtals, were diſſolved in 6562
                    grains of diſtilled water of the temperature 55⁰. A ſmall matraſs with a narrow
                    neck, which held 4200 grains of diſtilled water, was filled with this brine. Its
                    contents weighed 5027 grains. Now 6562 + 2188 : 2188 = 5027 : 1256,75. Therefore
                    the bottle of brine contained 1256,75 grains of ſalt diſſolved in 3770,25 grains
                    of water. Its ſpecific gravity is -= 5027</p>
                <p>or 1,196905 ; and a cubic foot of brine weighs 1196,9 ounces avoirdupois. Alſo
                    5027 : 1256,75 =</p>
                <p>1196,9 : 299,28. Therefore a cubic foot of this brine contains 299,28 ounces of
                    perfectly dry ſalt.</p>
                <p>The ſubſequent ſteps of the proceſs are repreſented as follows.</p>

                <p>Thus, by repeated abſtraction of brine, ſo as always to take out <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> th of the ſalt
                    contained in one conſtant bulk, we have obtained a brine conſiſting of 157
                    grains of ſalt united with 4313— 157, or 4156 grains of water. 4313</p>
                <p>Its ſpecific gravity is 1,0279, and a cubic foot</p>
                <p>of it weighs 1028 ounces, and contains 37 <hi rend="superscript"> 4</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 10</hi> ounces of dry ſalt. In like manner may the

                    curve will be found to be extremely regular, reſembling a hyperbolic arch whoſe
                    aſſymptote makes an angle of 30⁰ with the axis. Ordinates were then interpolated
                    analytically for every 10 ounces of contained ſalt, and thus the table was
                    conſtructed. We did not, however, rest it on one ſeries alone ; but made others,
                    in which <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi> th of the
                    ſalt was repeatedly abſtracted. They agreed, in the caſe of common ſalt, with
                    great exactneſs, and in ſome others there were ſome very inconsiderable
                    irregularities.</p>
                <p>To ſhow the authority of the tables of ſtrength was by no means our only motive
                    for giving an example of the proceſs. It may be of uſe as a pattern for ſimilar
                    experiments. But, beſides, it is very inſtructive. We see, in the firſt place,
                    that there is a very ſenſible change of density in one or both of the
                    ingredients. For the ſeries is of that nature (as we have formerly explained),
                    that if the ingredients retained their denſities in every proportion of
                    commixture, the ſpecific gravities would have been in arithmetical progreſſion ;
                    whereas we ſee that their differences continually diminiſh as the brines grow
                    more dense. We can form ſome notion of this by comparing the different brines.
                    Thus in the firſt brine, weighing 5027 grains, there are 3770 grains of water in
                    a veſſel holding 4200. If the density of the water remains the ſame, there is
                    left for the ſalt only as much ſpace as would hold 430 grains of water. In this
                    ſpace are lodged 1257 grains of ſalt, and its ſpecific</p>
                <p>gravity, in its liquid form, is <hi rend="superscript"> 1257</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 430</hi> = 2,8907 very nearly. But in the 8th brine the
                    quantity of water is 4156, the ſpace left for 157 grains of ſalt is only the
                    bulk oſ 44 grains of water, and the density of the ſalt is</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> 157</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 44</hi> = 3,568,
                    conſiderably greater than before. This</p>
                <p>induced us to continue the dilution of the brine as follows, beginning with the
                    8th brine.</p>

                <p>This laſt brine contains 4198,2 grains of water, leaving only the bulk of 1,8
                    grains of water to contain 19,8 of ſalt, ſo that the ſalt is ten times denſer
                    than water. This will make the ſtrength 243 inſtead of 210 indicated by the
                    ſpeciſic gravity. But we do not pretend to meaſure the denſities with accuracy
                    in theſe diluted brines. It is evident from the proceſs that a ſingle grain of
                    exceſs or defect in taking out the brine</p>
                <p>and replacing it with water has a ſenſible proportion to the whole variation. But
                    we ſee with sufficient evidence, that from the ſtrong to the weak brines the
                    ſpace left for the portion oſ ſalt is continually diminiſhing. In the firſt
                    dilution 527 <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    grains of water were added to fill up the veſſel ; but <hi rend="superscript">
                        1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 8</hi> th of its contents of pure water is
                    only 525 ; ſo that here is a diminution of 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> grains in the ſpace occupied by the remaining
                    ſalt. The ſubſequent additions are 604,7 ; 706,5 ; 847 ; 1054,5 ; 1405 ; 2102 ;
                    2105,5 ; 2102; 2102; inſtead of 600; 700; 840; 1050; 1400 ; 2100; 2100; 2100;
                    2100. Nothing can more plainly ſhow the condenſation in general, though we do
                    not learn whether it happens in one or both of the ingredients ;nor do the
                    experiments ſhow with sufficient accuracy the progreſſion of this diminution.
                    The exceſſes of the added water being only six or ſeven grains, we cannot expect
                    a nice repartition. When the brine is taken out, the upper part of the veſſel
                    remains lined with a briny film containing a portion of ſalt and water, perhaps
                    equal or ſuperior to the differences. Had our time permitted, we ſhould have
                    examined this matter with ſcrupulous attention, uſing a veſſel with a ſtill
                    narrower neck, and in each dilution abſtracting one half of the brine. The curve
                    whoſe abſciſſae and ordinates repreſent the weight of the contained ſalt and the
                    weight of a conſtant bulk of the brine, exhibits the beſt and moſt ſynoptical
                    view of the law of condenſation, becauſe the poſition of the tangent in any
                    point, or the</p>
                <p>value of the ſymbol <hi rend="superscript"> x</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    y</hi>, always ſhows the rate at which</p>
                <p>the ſpecific gravity increaſes or diminiſhes. We are inclined to think that the
                    curve in all caſes is of the hyperbolic kind, and complete ; that is, having the
                    tangent perpendicular to the axis at the beginning of the curve. The
                    mathematical reader will eaſily gueſs the phyſical notions which incline us to
                    this opinion ; and will alſo ſee that it is hardly poſſible to diſcover this
                    experimentally, becauſe the miſtake of a ſingle grain in the very ſmall
                    ordinates will change the poſition of the tangent many degrees. It was for this
                    reaſon that we thought it uſeleſs to proſecute the dilution any farther. But we
                    think that it may be proſecuted much farther in Dr Watſon's or Mr Achard’s
                    method, viz. by diſſolving equal weights of ſalt in two veſſels, of very
                    different capacities, having tubular necks, in which the change of bulk may be
                    very accurately obſerved. We can only conclude, that the condenſation is
                    greateſt in the ſtrongeſt brines, and probably attains its maximum when the
                    quantities of true ſaline matter and water are nearly equal, as in the, caſe of
                    vitriolic acid, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>We conſider theſe experiments as abundantly ſufficient for deciding the queſtion
                    “ Whether the ſalt can be received into the pores of the water, or the water
                    into the pores of the ſalt, ſo as to increaſe its weight without increaſing its
                    bulk?" and we muſt grant that it may. We do not mean that it is simply lodged in
                    the pores as sand is lodged in the interſtices of ſmall ſhot ; but the two
                    together occupy leſs room than when ſeparate. The experiments of Mr Achard were
                    insufficient for a decision, becauſe made on ſo ſmall a quantity as 600 grains
                    of water. Dr Watſon’s experiments have, for the moſt part, the ſame defect. Some
                    of them, however, are of great value in this queſtion, and are very fit for
                        aſcer-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0680.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0674"/>
                    taining the ſpecific gravity of diſſolved ſalts. In one of them (not
                    particularly narrated) he found that a quantity of diſſolved ſalt occupied the
                    same bulk in two very different ſtates of dilution. We cannot pretend to
                    reconcile this with our experiments. We have given theſe as they flood ; and we
                    think them concluſive, becauſe they were ſo numerous and ſo perfectly confident
                    with each other ; and their reſult is ſo general, that we have not found an
                    exception. Common ſalt is by no means the moſt remarkable inſtance of
                    condenſation. Vegetable alkali, ſal ammoniac, and ſome others, exhibit much
                    greater condenſation.</p>
                <p>We thought this a proper opportunity of conſidering this queſtion, which is
                    intimately connected with the principles of chemical ſolution, and was not
                    perhaps conſidered in sufficient detail under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Chemistry.</hi> We learn from it in general, that the quantities of ſalt in
                    brines increaſe at ſomewhat a greater rate than their ſpecific gravities. This
                    difference is in many cases of ſenſible importance in a commercial view. Thus an
                    alkaline lixivium for the purpoſes of bleaching or ſoap-making, whoſe ſpecific
                    gravity is 1,234, or exceeds that of water by 234, contains 361 ounces of ſalt
                    in a cubic foot ; a ley, which exceeds the weight of water twice as much, or 468
                    ounces <hi rend="italic">per</hi> cubic foot, contains 777 ounces of ſalt, which
                    exceeds the double of 361 by 55 ounces more than 7 <hi rend="italic">per
                        cent.</hi> Hence we learn, that hydrometers for diſcovering the ſtrength of
                    brines, having equal diviſions on a cylindrical ſtem, are very erroneous ; for
                    even if the increments of ſpecific gravity were proportional to the quantities
                    of ſalt in a gallon of brine, the diviſions at the bottom of the ſtem ought to
                    be ſmaller than thoſe above.</p>

                </table>
                <p>The table differs conſiderably from Mr Lambert’s. The quantities of ſalt
                    correſponding to any ſpecific gravity are about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 18</hi> th leſs than in his table But the reader will
                    see that they correſpond with the ſeries of</p>
                <p>experiments above narrated; and theſe were but a few of many which all
                    correſponded within an hundredth part. The cauſe iof the difference ſeems to be,
                    that moſt kinds of common ſalt contain magneſian ſalts, which contain a very
                    great proportion of water neceſſary for their cryſtallization. The ſalt which we
                    uſed was of the pureſt kind, but ſuch as may be had from every ſalt work, by
                    Lord Dundonald’s very eaſy proceſs, viz. by paſſing through it a ſaturated
                    ſolution boiling hot, which carries off with it about <hi rend="superscript">
                        4</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> ths of all the bitter ſalts. Our aim
                    being to aſcertain the quantities of pure ſea- ſalt, and to learn by the by its
                    relation to water in reſpect of density, we thought it neceſſary to uſe the
                    pureſt ſalt. We alſo dried it for ſeveral days in a ſtove, ſo that it contained
                    no water not abſolutely neceſſary for its cryſtallization. An ounce of ſuch ſalt
                    will communicate a greater ſpecific gravity to water than an ounce of a salt
                    that is leſs pure, or that contains extraneous water.</p>
                <p>The ſpecific gravity 1,090 is that of ordinary pickles, which are eſtimated as to
                    ſtrength by floating an egg.</p>
                <p>We cannot raiſe the ſpecific gravity higher than 1,206 by simply diſſolving ſalt
                    in cold water. But it will become much denſer, and will even attain the ſpecific
                    gravity 1,240 by boiling, then holding about 366 ounces in the cubic foot of hot
                    brine. But it will depoſit by cooling, and when of the temperature 55⁰ or 60⁰,
                    hardly exceeds 1,206. We obtained a brine by boiling till the ſalt grained very
                    rapidly. When it cooled to 60⁰, its ſpecific gravity was 1,2063 ; for a veſſel
                    which held 3506 grains of distilled water held 4229 of this brine. This was
                    evaporated to dryneſs, and there were obtained 1344 grains of ſalt. By this was
                    computed the number interpoſed between 310 and 320 in the table. We have however
                    raiſed the ſpecific gravity to 1,217, by putting in no more ſalt than was
                    neceſſary for thi$ denſity, and uſing heat. It then cooled down to 60⁰ without
                    quitting any ſalt ; but if a few grains of ſalt be thrown into this brine, it
                    will quickly deposit a great deal more, and its denſity will decreaſe to 1,206.
                    We find this to hold in all salts ; and it is a very inſtructive fact in the
                    theory of cryſtallization ; it reſembles the effect which a magnet produces upon
                    iron filings in its neighbourhood. It makes them temporary magnets, and cauſes
                    them to arrange themſelves as if they had been really made permanent magnets.
                    Juſt ſo a cryſtal already formed diſpoſes the reſt to cryſtallize. We imagine
                    that this analogy is complete, and that the forces are ſimilar in both
                    caſes.</p>
                <p>The above table is computed for the temperature 55⁰ ; but in other temperatures
                    the ſtrength will be different on two accounts, viz. the expanſion of the brine
                    and the diſſolving power of the water. Water expands about 40 parts in 1000 when
                    heated from 60⁰ to 212⁰. Saturated brine expands about 48 parts, or <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi> th more than
                    water; and this exceſs of expanſion is nearly proportional to the quantity of
                    ſalt in the brine. If therefore any circumſtance ſhould oblige us to examine a
                    brine in a temperature much above 60⁰, allowance ſhould be made for this. Thus,
                    ſhould the ſpecific gravity of brine of the temperature 130 (which is nearly
                    half way between 60 and 212 ) be 1,140, we muſt increaſe it by 20 (half of 40 )
                    ; and having found the ſtrength 24 correſponding to this corrected ſpecific
                    gravity, we muſt correct it again by adding 1 to the ſpecific gravity for every
                    45 ounces of ſalt.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0681.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0675"/> But a much greater and more uncertain correction
                    is neceſſary on account of the variation of the diſſolving power of water by
                    heat. This indeed is very ſmall in the caſe of ſea-ſalt in compariſon with other
                    ſalts. We preſume that our readers are appriſed of this peculiarity of ſea-ſalt,
                    that it diſſolves nearly in equal quantities in hot or in cold water. But
                    although water of the temperature 60 will not diſſolve more than 320 or 325
                    ounces of the pureſt and dryeſt ſea-ſalt, it will take up above 20 ounces more
                    by boiling on it. When thus ſaturated to the utmoſt, and allowed to cool, it
                    does not quit any of it till it is far cooled, viz. near to 60⁰. It then
                    depoſits this redundant ſalt, and holds the rest till it is juſt going to
                    freeze, when it lets it go in the inſtant of freezing. If evaporated in the
                    ſtate in which it continues to hold the ſalt, it will yield above 400 ounces per
                    cubic foot of brine, in good cryſtals, but rather overcharged with water. And
                    ſince in this ſtate the cubic foot of brine weighs about 1220 ounces, it
                    follows, that 820 ounces of water will, by boiling, diſsolve 400 of cryſtallized
                    ſalt.</p>
                <p>The table ſhows how much any brine muſt be boiled down in order to grain. Having
                    obſerved its ſpecific gravity, find in the table the quantity of ſalt
                    correſponding. Call this x. Then, ſince a boiling hot graining or ſaturated
                    ſolution contains 340 ounces in the cubic foot of</p>
                <p>brine, ſay 340 : 1000 = x : <hi rend="superscript"> 1000</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 340</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> .</hi> This is the bulk</p>
                <p>to which every cubic foot (valued at 1000) muſt be boiled down. Thus ſuppoſe the
                    brine has the ſpecific gravity 1109. It holds 160 ounces <hi rend="italic"
                        >per</hi> foot, and we</p>
                <p>muſt boil it down to 1000 x 160/340 or 471 ; that is, we</p>
                <p>muſt boil off 529/1000 of every cubic foot or gallon.</p>
                <p>Theſe remarks are of importance in the manufacture of common ſalt ; they enable
                    us to appretiate the value of ſalt ſprings, and to know how far it may be
                    prudent to engage in the manufacture. For the doctrine of latent heat aſſures
                    us, that in order to boil off a certain quantity of water, a certain quantity of
                    heat is indepenſably neceſſary. After the moſt judicious application of this
                    heat, the conſumption of fuel may be too expenſive.</p>
                <p>The ſpecific gravity of ſea-water in theſe climates does not exceed 1,03, or the
                    cubic foot weighs 1030 ounces, and it contains about 41 ounces of ſalt. The
                    brine- pits in England are vaſtly richer ; but in many parts of the world brines
                    are boiled for ſalt which do not contain above 10 or 20 ounces in the cubic
                    foot.</p>
                <p>In buying ſalt by weight, it is of importance to know the degree of humidity. A
                    ſalt will appear pretty dry (if free from magneſia ſalts) though moiſtened with

                    humidity expoſes it much to farther deliqueſcence. A much ſmaller degree of
                    humidity may be discovered by the ſpecific gravity of a brine made with a few
                    ounces of the ſalt. And the inſpection of the table informs us that the brine
                    ſhould be weak ; for the differences of ſpecific gravity go on diminiſhing in
                    the stronger brines : 300 ounces of dry ſalt diſſolved in 897 ounces of water
                    ſhould give the ſpecific gravity 1197. Suppoſe it be but 1190, the quantity of
                    ſalt correſponding is only 290; but when mixed with 897 ounces of water, the
                    weight is 1197, although the weight of the cubic foot is only 1190. There is
                    therefore more than a cubic foot of the brine, and there is as much ſalt as will
                    make more than a cubic foot of the</p>
                <p>weight 1190. There is 290 x <hi rend="superscript"> 1197</hi> / <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 1190,</hi> or 291 <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi

                <p>and there is 8 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>
                    ounces of water attached to the ſalt.</p>
                <p>The various informations wlιich we have pointed out as deducible from a knowledge
                    of the specific gravity of the brines of common salt, will ſerve to ſuggeſt
                    ſeveral advantages of the knowledge of this circumſtance in other lixivia. We
                    ſhall not therefore reſume them, but ſimply give another table or two of ſuch as
                    are moſt intereſting. Of thoſe alkaline leys are the chief, being of extenſive
                    uſe in bleaching, ſoap-making, glaſs-making, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>We therefore made a very ſtrong ley of the pureſt vegetable alkali that is ever
                    uſed in the manufactories, not thinking it neceſſary, or even proper, to take it
                    in its ſtate of utmoſt purity, as obtained from cubic nitre and the like. We
                    took ſalt of tartar from the apothecary, perfectly dry, of which 3983 grains
                    were diſſolved in 3540 grains of distilled water ; and after agitation for
                    ſeveral days, and then ſtanding to deposit ſediment, the clear ley was decanted.
                    It was again agitated ; becauſe, when of this ſtrength, it becomes, in a very
                    ſhort time, rarer above and denſer at the bottom. A flaſk containing 4200 grains
                    of water held 6165 of this ley when of the temperature 55⁰. Its ſpecific gravity
                    was therefore 1,4678, and the 6165 grains of ley contained 3264 grain of ſalt.
                    We examined its ſpecific gravity in different ſtates of dilution, till we came
                    to a brine containing 51 grains of ſalt, and 4189 grains of water, and the
                    contents of the flaſk weighed 4240 grains : its ſpecific gravity was therefore
                    1,0095. In this train of experiments the progreſſion was moſt regular and
                    ſatisfactory ; ſo that when we conſtructed the curve of ſpecific gravities
                    geometrically, none of the points deviated from a moſt regular curve. It was
                    conſiderably more incurvated near its commencement than the curve for ſea-ſalt,
                    indicating a much greater condenſation in the diluted brines. We think that the
                    following table, conſtructed in the ſame manner as that for common ſalt, may be
                    depended on as very exact.</p>

                <p> We ſee the ſame augmentation of the denſity of the ſalt in the diluted brines
                    here as in the caſe of common ſalt. Thus a brine, of which the cubic foot weighs
                    1482 ounces, or which has the ſpecific gravity 1,482, contains 800 ounces of dry
                    alkali and 682 of water. Therefore, if we ſuppoſe the denſity of the water
                    unchanged, there remains the bulk of 318 ounces of water to receive 840 ounces
                    of ſalt: its denſity is therefore 800/318, = 2,512 nearly. But in the brine
                    whoſe weight <hi rend="italic">per</hi> foot is only 1016 there are 20 ounces of
                    ſalt, and therefore 996 of water ; and there is only four ounce-meaſures of
                    water, that is, the bulk of four ounces of water, to receive 20 ounces of ſalt.
                    Its ſpecific gravity therefore is 20/4, ≡ 5, almoſt twice as great as in the
                    ſtrong brine. Accordingly Mr Achard is diſpoſed to admit the abſorption (as it
                    is careleſsly termed) in the caſe of ſal tart. But it is a general (we think an
                    univerſal) fact in the ſolution of ſalts. It muſt be carefully diſtinguiſhed
                    from the firſt contraction of bulk which ſalts undergo in passing from a ſolid
                    to a fluid form. The contraction now under conſideration is analogous to the
                    contraction of oil of virtriol when diluted with water ; for oil of vitriol muſt
                    be conſidered as a very ſtrong brine which we cannot dephlegmate by
                    diſtillation, and therefore cannot obtain the dry ſaline ingredient in a
                    separate form, ſo as to obſerve its ſolid denſity, and ſay how much it contracts
                    in firſt becoming fluid. The way of conceiving the first contraction in the act
                    of ſolution as a lodging of the particles of the one ingredient on the
                    interſtices of the other, “ <hi rend="italic">ou ils ſe nichent, en augmentant
                        le poids ſans affecter le volume de la ſaumure,"</hi> as Eller and Lambert
                    expreſs themſelves, is impoſſible here, when both are fluids. Indeed it is but a
                    ſlovenly way of thinking in either caſe, and ſhould be avoided, becauſe
                    inadvertent perſons are apt to uſe as a phyſical principle what is merely a mode
                    of ſpeech.</p>
                <p>We learn from the table, that a hydrometer with equidiſtant diviſions on a
                    cylindrical or priſmatical stem is still more erroneous than in the brines of
                    common ſalt.</p>
                <p>We learn from the experiments of Kirwan, Lavoisier, and others, that dry ſalt of
                    tartar contains about ¼th of its weight of fixed air. In many applications of
                    this ſalt to the purpoſes of manufacture, this ingredient is of no uſe. In ſome
                    it is hurtful, and muſt be abstracted by lime. Soap-maker’s ley conſiſts of the
                    pure alkaline ſalt dissolved in water. It is therefore of importance to
                    aſcertain its quantity by means of the ſpecific gravity of the brine. For this
                    purpoſe, we took a ley of ſal tart whoſe ſpecific gravity was 1,20417,
                    containing 314 oz. of mild alkali in a cubic foot of ley, and we rendered it
                    nearly cauſtic by lime. The ſpecific gravity was then 1,1897. This is a very
                    unexpected reſult. Nothing is employed with more ſucceſs than quick-lime for
                    dephlegmating any watery fluid. We ſhould rather have expected an increaſe of
                    ſpecific gravity by the abſtraction of ſome of the water of the menſtruum, and
                    perhaps the water of the cryſtallization, and the aerial part of the ſalt. But
                    we muſt aſcribe this to the great denſity in which the fixed air exiſts in the
                    mild alkali.</p>
                <p>It is unneceſſary to give ſimilar tables for all the ſalts, unleſs we were
                    writing a diſſertation on the theory of their ſolution. We ſhall only obſerve,
                    that we examined with particular attention ſal ammoniac, becauſe Mr Achard, who
                    denies what is called the abſorption of ſalts, finds himſelf obliged to allow
                    ſomething like it in this ſalt. It does not, however, differ from thoſe of which
                    we have given an account in detail in any other reſpect than this, that the
                    changes of fluid denſity are much leſs than in others (inſtead of being greater,
                    as Achard’s experiments seem to indicate) in all brines of moderate ſtrength.
                    But in the very weak brines there is indeed a remarkable difference ; and if we
                    have not committed an error in our examination, the addition of one part of ſal
                    ammoniac to 64 of water occupies leſs room than the water alone. We think that
                    we have met with this as an accidental remark by ſome author, whoſe work we do
                    not recollect. But we do not choose to rest ſo much on our form of the
                    experiment in ſuch weak brines. The following mixtures will abundantly ſerve for
                    conſtructing the table of its ſtrength : Sal ammoniac = 960 grains was diſſolved
                    in 3506 grains of water, making a brine of 4466 grains. A phial which held 1600
                    grains water held 1698 of this brine. It contained 1698x960/4460, or 365 grains
                    of ſalt. The ſpecific gravity was 1690/1600,= 1061, and the cubic foot weighed
                    1061 ounces. It alſo contained1061x365/1698, or 228 ounces of ſalt. By repeated
                    abſtraction of brine, and replacing with water, we had the following ſeries

                <p>This ſeries is extremely regular, and the progreſs of denſity may be confidently
                    deduced from it.</p>
                <p>From the whole of this diſquiſition on the relation between the ſpecific
                    gravities of brines and the quantities of ſalt contained, we ſee in general that
                    it may be gueſſed at, with a uſeful degree of preciſion, from the denſity or
                    ſpecific gravity of ſaturated ſolutions. We therefore conclude with a list of
                    the ſpecific gravities of ſeveral ſaturated ſolutions, made with great care by
                    the bishop of Landaff.—Thetemperaturewas 42⁰. The first numerical column is the
                    denſity of ſaturated brine, and the next is the denſity of a brine conſiſting of
                    12 parts (by weight) of water and one of ſalt. From this may be inferred the
                    quantity in the ſaturated ſolution, and from this again may be inferred the
                    quantity correſponding to inferior denſities.</p>
