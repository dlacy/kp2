<p><span class="font0">up to the nabob of Oude, who presented the British army with eleven lacs of rupees for their services. The country&nbsp;, was in a highly cultivated and flourishing condition under&nbsp;the just administration of its native ruler Fyzoola Khan ;&nbsp;but it quickly decayed, and was reduced to a deplorable&nbsp;condition under the extortions of the British, to whom it&nbsp;was ceded in 1801.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAMPOORA, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Gujerat, and district of Chalawara. This place had formerly a respectable fort, which was destroyed in 1805. In the&nbsp;neighbourhood are many pallias or stones, erected to the&nbsp;memory of persons who have fallen in defence of the village. These monuments are also erected in honour of females who have sacrificed themselves to the memory of their&nbsp;deceased husbands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAMSAY, Allan, a Scottish poet, was born at Lead-hills in Lanarkshire, in October 1686. His father was employed in the management of Lord Hopetoun’s mines at that place ; but died whilst the poet was yet in his infancy, in&nbsp;consequence of which, and the marriage of his mother soon&nbsp;after his father’s death, it seems probable that, during the&nbsp;earlier part of his life, he continued in rather a destitute situation. He remained at Leadhills till he reached his fifteenth year, and was employed in washing, preparing the&nbsp;lead ore for smelting, and other operations about the works&nbsp;in which the children of miners and young persons are usually employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1701, when in his fifteenth year, he was bound apprentice to a wigmaker in Edinburgh ; and it appears from the record of his children’s birth in the parish register that&nbsp;he continued in the same humble profession until the year&nbsp;1716. One of the earliest of Ramsay’s productions now&nbsp;known, an address to the members of the Easy Club, appeared in 1712, when he was twenty-six years of age; and&nbsp;three years afterwards he was humorously appointed their&nbsp;poet laureat. Many of his poems written about this time&nbsp;were published in the form of separate pamphlets. When&nbsp;he had followed the occupation of wigmaker for a considerable time, he at last abandoned it for that of bookseller,&nbsp;as being more congenial to the literary turn of his mind.&nbsp;His detached pamphlets were afterwards published by him&nbsp;in the year 1721, in one volume 4to, which was encouraged&nbsp;by a very liberal subscription. The first volume of his well-known collection, the Tea-table Miscellany, was published&nbsp;in 1724·, after which a second volume soon made its appearance, a third came forth in 1727, and a fourth after another&nbsp;interval of time. He soon afterwards published what is&nbsp;called the Evergreen, being a collection of Scotch poems&nbsp;written by ingenious poets prior to the year 1600. In 1725&nbsp;appeared his Gentle Shepherd, part of which, called Patie&nbsp;and Roger, was printed in 1721, and Jenny and Meggy in&nbsp;1723, the great success of which induced him to form them&nbsp;afterwards into a regular drama.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the year 1728, he published a second volume of his poems, which was afterwards reprinted in 8vo. These performances so rapidly enlarged the circle of his fame and&nbsp;reputation, that in 1731 an edition of his poetical works was&nbsp;published by the booksellers of London, and two years afterwards they appeared at Dublin. From his shop opposite to&nbsp;Niddry Street, he removed to one at the east end of the&nbsp;Luckenbooths. In this shop he continued to sell and lend&nbsp;out books until he was far advanced in years ; and we have&nbsp;reason to believe that he was the first person who established a circulating library in Scotland. His collection of Fables appeared in 1730, after which period he may be said to&nbsp;have almost discontinued the occupation of author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such, however, was his enterprising spirit, that he built, at his own expense, the first theatre for dramatical performances ever known in Edinburgh, which took place in what is&nbsp;called CarrubbePs Close, in the year 1736 ; but he did not&nbsp;long enjoy his character of manager, for the magistrates of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Edinburgh required him to shut it up, as an act of parliament prohibited all such amusements without a special license and his majesty’s letters patent. It is generally understood that he relinquished the trade of bookseller about the year 1755, being then sixty-nine years of age, and lived&nbsp;the remainder of his days in a small house erected by himself on the north side of the Castle-hill. A scorbutic complaint, attended with excruciating pain, deprived him of his&nbsp;teeth, and, after corroding one of his jaw<sup>r</sup>-bones, put a period&nbsp;to his existence on the 7th of June 1758, in the seventy-first year of his age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ramsay possessed a very considerable share of poetical genius. Of this his Gentle Shepherd, which will continue&nbsp;to be admired as long as the language in which it is written&nbsp;shall be understood, and especially by the natives of North&nbsp;Britain, to whom only the peculiarities of dialect by which&nbsp;it is distinguished can be familiar, affords the best proof.&nbsp;Some of his songs may contain far-fetched allusions and&nbsp;childish conceits ; but many of them are equal, if not superior, in their pastoral simplicity, to productions of a similar nature in any other language. Some of the imitations&nbsp;of the ancients by this poet are extremely happy ; and several of his tales have all the excellencies that belong to that&nbsp;species of composition. But of a great proportion of his&nbsp;other productions it may be pronounced with truth that they&nbsp;are mere prosaic compositions, filled with the most commonplace observations, and destitute even of the ornament of&nbsp;smooth versification and correct rhymes. A complete edition of his w'orks, with a Life, written by the late Mr George&nbsp;Chalmers, was published in two volumes 8vo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ramsay, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Andrew Michael,</span><span class="font0"> generally known by the name of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chevalier Ramsoy,</span><span class="font0"> a polite Scotch writer, was descended of a good family, and born at Ayr in 1686. His&nbsp;parts and learning recommended him as tutor to the son of&nbsp;the Earl of Wemyss ; after which, conceiving a disgust for&nbsp;the religion in which he had been educated, he in the same&nbsp;humour reviewed other Christian churches, and, finding none&nbsp;to his liking, rested for a time in Deism. Whilst he was in&nbsp;this uncertain state of mind, he went to Leyden, where, falling into the company of one Poiret, a mystical divine, he received the infection of mysticism, which prompted him to&nbsp;consult Fénelon, the celebrated archbishop of Cambray, who&nbsp;had imbibed principles of the same nature, and who in 1709&nbsp;gained him over to the Catholic religion. The subsequent&nbsp;course of his life received its direction from his friendship&nbsp;and connection with this illustrious prelate ; and being appointed governor to the Duke de Chateau-Thierry and the&nbsp;Prince de Turenne, he was made a knight of the order of&nbsp;St Lazarus. Ramsay was sent for to Rome by the Chevalier&nbsp;de St George, to undertake the education of his children ;&nbsp;but on his arrival there in 1724, he found so many intrigues&nbsp;and dissensions, that he obtained the chevalier’s leave to return to Paris. He died in 1743, in the office of intendant&nbsp;to the Duke of Bouillon, prince de Turenne. The principal work of his composition is the Travels of Cyrus, which&nbsp;has been several times printed in English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ramsay, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">James,</span><span class="font0"> was born on the 25th of July 1733, at Frasersburgh, a small town in the county of Aberdeen.&nbsp;His parents were of most respectable character, but in circumstances by no means affluent From his earliest years&nbsp;he discovered a serious disposition, and a strong thirst for&nbsp;knowledge ; and after passing through the usual course of&nbsp;a Scotch grammar-school education, he inclined to pursue&nbsp;the studies necessary to qualify him for the profession of&nbsp;clergyman. Several circumstances, however, conspired to&nbsp;divert him for a time from his favourite pursuit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was educated in the episcopal persuasion ; and having been unhappy enough to lose his father whilst yet very young, he found, upon his advancing towards the state of&nbsp;manhood, that the joint fortunes of himself and his mother&nbsp;could not bear the expense of a regular education in either</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
