<p><span class="font1">We are too apt to take for granted that the men of the middle ages were immersed in meditations on the other world, and that their&nbsp;intellectual exercises were confined to abstractions of the&nbsp;schools, hallucinations of the fancy, allegories, visions.&nbsp;This assumption applies indeed in a broad sense to that&nbsp;period which was dominated by intolerant theology and&nbsp;deprived of positive knowledge. Yet there are abundant&nbsp;signs that the native human instincts, the natural human&nbsp;appetites, remained unaltered and alive beneath the crust of orthodoxy. In the person of a pope like Boniface VIII. those ineradicable&nbsp;forces of the natural man assumed, if we may trust the depositions&nbsp;of ecclesiastics well acquainted with his life, a form of brutal&nbsp;atheistic cynicism. In the person of an emperor, Frederick II.,&nbsp;they emerged under the more agreeable garb of liberal culture and&nbsp;Epicurean scepticism. Frederick dreamed of remodelling. society&nbsp;upon a mundane, type, which anticipated the large toleration and&nbsp;cosmopolitan enlightenment of the actual Renaissance. But his&nbsp;efforts were defeated by the unrelenting hostility of the church,&nbsp;and by the incapacity of his contemporaries to Understandhisaims.&nbsp;After being forced in his lifetime to submit to authority, he was&nbsp;consigned by Dante to hell. Frederick’s ideal of civilization was&nbsp;derived in a large measure from Provence, where a beautiful culture&nbsp;had prematurely bloomed, filling southern Europe with the perfume&nbsp;of poetry and gentle living. Here, if anywhere, it seemed as.though&nbsp;the ecclesiastical and feudal fetters of the middle ages might .be&nbsp;broken, and humanity might enter on a new stage of joyous unimpeded evolution. This was, however, not to be. The church&nbsp;preached Simon de Montfort’s crusade, and organized Dominic’s&nbsp;I nquisition ; what Quinet calls the “ Renaissance sociale par&nbsp;VAmour ” was extirpated b&gt; sword, fire, famine and pestilence.&nbsp;Meanwhile the Provençal poets had developed their modern language&nbsp;with incomparable richness and dexterity, creating forms of verse&nbsp;and modes of emotional expression which determined the latest&nbsp;medieval phase of literature in Europe. The naturalism of. which&nbsp;we have been speaking found free utterance now in the fabliaux of&nbsp;jongleurs, lyrics of minnesingers., tales of trouvères, romances of&nbsp;Arthur and his knights—compositions varied, in type and tone, but&nbsp;in all of which sincere passion and real enjoyment of life pierce&nbsp;through the thin veil of. chivalrous mysticism or of allegory with&nbsp;which they were sometimes conventionally draped. The tales of&nbsp;Lancelot and Tristram, the lives of the troubadours and the Wacht-lieder of the minnesingers, sufficiently prove with what sensual&nbsp;freedom a knight loved the lady whom.custom and art .made him&nbsp;profess to worship as a saint. We do not need to be reminded that&nbsp;Beatrice’s adorer had a wife and children, or that Laura’s poet&nbsp;owned a son and daughter by a concubine, in order to perceive that&nbsp;the mystic passion of chivalry was compatible, in the middle ages&nbsp;with commonplace matrimony or vulgar illegitimate connexions.&nbsp;But perhaps the most convincing testimony to the presence of this&nbsp;ineradicable naturalism is afforded by the Latin songs of wandering&nbsp;students, known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Carmina Burana,</span><span class="font1">. written by the self-styled&nbsp;Goliardi. In these compositions, remarkable for their&nbsp;lacile handling of medieval Latin rhymes and rhythms,&nbsp;the allegorizing mysticism which envelops chivalrous&nbsp;poetry is discarded. Love is treated from a frankly carnal point of&nbsp;view. Bacchus and Venus go hand in hand, as in the ancient ante-Christian age. The open-air enjoyments of the wood, the field, the&nbsp;dance upon the village green, are sung with juvenile lightheartedness. No grave note, warning us that the pleasures of this earth&nbsp;are fleeting, that the visible world is but a symbol of the invisible,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">that human life is a probation for the.life beyond, interrupts the tinkling music as of castanets and tripping feet which gives a novel&nbsp;charm to these unique relics of the 13th century. Goliardic poetry&nbsp;is further curious as showing how the classics even at that early&nbsp;period were a fountain-head of pagan inspiration. In the taverns&nbsp;and low places of amusement haunted by those lettered songsters,&nbsp;on the open road and in the forests trodden by their vagrant feet,&nbsp;the deities of Greece and Rome were not in exile, but at home&nbsp;within the hearts of living men. Thus, while Christendom was still&nbsp;preoccupied with the Crusades, two main forces of the Renaissance,&nbsp;naturalism and enthusiasm for antique modes of feeling, already&nbsp;brought their latent potency to light, prematurely indeed and&nbsp;precociously, yet with a promise that was destined to be kept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When due regard is paid to these miscellaneous evidences of intellectual and sensual freedom during the middle ages, it will be&nbsp;seen that there were by no means lacking elements of&nbsp;native vigour ready to burst forth. What was wanting&nbsp;was not vitality and licence, not audacity of speculation,&nbsp;not lawless instinct or rebellious impulse. It was rather&nbsp;the right touch on life, the right feeling for human independence,&nbsp;the right way of approaching the materials of philosophy, religion,&nbsp;scholarship and literature, that failed. The courage that is born of&nbsp;knowledge, the calm strength begotten by a positive attitude of mind,&nbsp;face to face with the dominant over-shadowing Sphinx of theology,&nbsp;were lacking. We.may fairly say that natural and untaught people&nbsp;had more of the just intuition that was needed than learned folk&nbsp;trained in the schools. But these people were rendered licentious&nbsp;in revolt or impotent for salutary action by ignorance, by terror,&nbsp;by uneasy dread of the doom declared for heretics and rebels. The&nbsp;massive vengeance of the church .hung over them, like a heavy&nbsp;sword suspended in the* cloudy air. Superstition and stupidity&nbsp;hedged them in on every side, so that sorcery and magic seemed the&nbsp;only means of winning power over nature or insight into mysteries&nbsp;surrounding human life. The path from darkness to light was lost;&nbsp;thought was involved in allegory; the study of nature had been&nbsp;perverted into an inept system of grotesque and pious parable-mongering; the pursuit of truth had become a game of wordy&nbsp;dialectics. The other world, with its imagined heaven and hell,&nbsp;haunted the conscience like a nightmare. However sweet this&nbsp;world seemed, however fair the flesh, both world and flesh were&nbsp;theoretically given over to the devil. It was not worth while to&nbsp;master and economize the resources of this earth, to utilize the good&nbsp;and ameliorate the evils of this life, while every one agreed, in theory&nbsp;at apy rate, that the present was but a bad prelude to an infinitely&nbsp;worse or infinitely better future. To escape from these preoccupations and prejudices except upon the path of conscious and deliberate sin was impossible for all but minds of rarest quality and&nbsp;courage; and these were too often reduced to the recantation of&nbsp;their supposed errors no less by some secret clinging sense of guilt&nbsp;than by the church’s iron hand. Man and the actual Universekept&nbsp;on reasserting their rights and claims, announcing their goodliness&nbsp;and delightfulness, in one. way or another; but they were always&nbsp;being thrust back again into Cimmerian regions of abstractions,&nbsp;fictions, visions, spectral hopes and fears, in the midst of which the&nbsp;intellect somnambulistically moved upon an unknown way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At this point thc Revival of Learning intervened to determine the course of the Renaissance. Medieval students possessed&nbsp;a considerable portion of the Latin classics, though&nbsp;Greek had become in the fullest sense of the phrase&nbsp;a dead language. But what they retained of ancient&nbsp;literature they could not comprehend in the right spirit.&nbsp;Between them and the text of poet or historian hung a&nbsp;veil of mysticism, a vapour of misapprehension. The odour&nbsp;of unsanctity clung around those relics of the pagan past. Men&nbsp;bred in the cloister and the lecture-room of the logicians, trained&nbsp;in scholastic disputations, versed in allegorical interpretations&nbsp;of the plainest words and most apparent facts, could not find&nbsp;the key which might unlock those stores of wisdom and of&nbsp;beauty. Petrarch first opened a new method in scholarship,&nbsp;and revealed what we denote as humanism. In his teaching&nbsp;lay the twofold discovery of man and of the world. For&nbsp;humanism, which was the vital element in the Revival of&nbsp;Learning, consists mainly of a just perception of the dignity of&nbsp;man as a rational, volitional and sentient being, horn upon&nbsp;this earth with a right to use it and enjoy it. Humanism&nbsp;•implied the rejection of those visions of a future and imagined&nbsp;state of souls as the only absolute reality, which had fascinated&nbsp;the imagination of the middle ages. It involved a vivid&nbsp;recognition of the goodliness of man and nature, displayed in&nbsp;the great monuments of human power recovered from the past.&nbsp;It stimulated the curiosity of latent sensihilities, provoked fresh&nbsp;inquisition into the groundwork of existence, and strengthened&nbsp;man’s self-esteem by knowledge of what men had thought and&nbsp;felt and done in ages when Christianity was not. It roused&nbsp;a desire to reappropriate the whole abandoned provinces of&nbsp;mundane energy, and a hope to emulate antiquity in works&nbsp;of living loveliness and vigour. The Italians of the 14th century,&nbsp;more precocious than the other European races, were ripe for&nbsp;this emancipation of enslaved intelligence. In the classics&nbsp;they found the food which was required to nourish the new spirit;&nbsp;and a variety of circumstances, among which must be reckoned&nbsp;the pride of a nation boasting of its descent from the Populus&nbsp;Romanus, rendered them apt to fling aside the obstacles that&nbsp;had impeded the free action of the mind through' many centuries.&nbsp;Petrarch not only set his countrymen upon the right method&nbsp;of studying the Latin classics, hut he also divined the importance&nbsp;of recovering a knowledge of Greek literature. To this task&nbsp;Boccaccio addressed himself; and he was followed hy numerous&nbsp;Italian enthusiasts, who visited Byzantium before its fall as the&nbsp;sacred city of a new revelation. The next step was to collect&nbsp;MSS., to hunt out, copy and preserve the precious relics of the&nbsp;past. In this work of accumulation Guarino and Filelfo,&nbsp;Aurispa and Poggio, took the chief part, aided by the wealth&nbsp;of Italian patricians, merchant-princes and despots, who were&nbsp;inspired by the sacred thirst for learning. Learning was then</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
