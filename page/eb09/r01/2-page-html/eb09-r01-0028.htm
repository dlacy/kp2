<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">where </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">is the absolute temperature. If / be the pressure on unit surface, 3/ is the energy per unit of volume, and&nbsp;this equation becomes</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Hence it follows at once that, if the fundamental assumptions be granted, the energy of radiation of a black body per unit volume of the enclosure is proportional to the&nbsp;fourth power of the absolute temperature. It is not a&nbsp;little remarkable that Stefan @@<sup>1</sup> had some years previously&nbsp;shown that this very expression agrees more closely with&nbsp;the experimental determinations of Dulong and Petit than&nbsp;does their own empirical formula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would appear from this expression that, if an&nbsp;impervious enclosure containing only one black body in&nbsp;thermal equilibrium is separated into two parts by an&nbsp;impervious partition, any alteration of volume of the part&nbsp;not containing the black body will produce a corresponding&nbsp;alteration of the radiation in its interior. It will now&nbsp;correspond to that of a second black body, whose temperature is to that of the first in the inverse ratio of the fourth&nbsp;roots of the volumes of the detached part of the enclosure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lecher@@<sup>2</sup> has endeavoured to show that the distribution of energy among the constituents of the radiation&nbsp;from a black body does not alter with temperature. Such&nbsp;a result, though apparently inconsistent with many well-known facts, appears to be consistent with and to harmonize&nbsp;many others. It accords perfectly with the notion of the&nbsp;absolute uniformity (statistical) of the energy in an enclosure, and its being exactly that of a black body, even if&nbsp;the contents (as in § 25) consist of a body which can radiate&nbsp;one particular quality of light alone. And if this be the&nbsp;case it will also follow that the intensity of radiation of&nbsp;any one wave-length by any one body in a given state&nbsp;depends on the temperature in exactly the same way as&nbsp;does the whole radiation from a black body. Unfortunately this last deduction does not accord with Melloni’s&nbsp;results; at least the discrepance from them would appear&nbsp;to be somewhat beyond what could fairly be set down to&nbsp;error of experiment. But it is in thorough accordance&nbsp;with the common assumption (§ 14) that the percentage&nbsp;absorption of any particular radiation does not depend on&nbsp;the temperature of the source. The facts of fluorescence&nbsp;and phosphorescence, involving the radiation of visible&nbsp;rays at temperatures where even a black body is invisible,&nbsp;have not yet been dealt with under any general theory of&nbsp;radiation; though Stokes has pointed out a dynamical&nbsp;explanation of a thoroughly satisfactory character, they remain outside the domain of Carnot’s principle, (p. G. x.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RADNOR, an inland county of South Wales, is situated between 52° 5' and 52° 25' N. lat. and between 2° 57'&nbsp;and 3° 25' W. long., and is bounded E. by Hereford and&nbsp;Shropshire, N. by Montgomery, W. by Cardigan, and S.&nbsp;by Brecknock. Its greatest length from north to south is&nbsp;about 30 miles, and its greatest breadth from east to west&nbsp;about 33 miles. The area is 276,552 acres, or 432 square&nbsp;miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The greater part of the surface of the county is hilly, and the centre is occupied by a mountainous tract called&nbsp;Radnor Forest, running nearly east and west, its highest&nbsp;summit reaching 2163 feet. Towards the south and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration:underline;">south-east the hills are much less elevated and the valleys</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;widen out into considerable plains, abounding with small&nbsp;rivulets. The hills for the most part present smooth and&nbsp;rounded outlines, but the valley of the Wye is famed for&nbsp;its beauty. The higher ranges are covered with heath,&nbsp;but there is good pasturage on the lower slopes. The&nbsp;smaller elevations are frequently clothed with wood. The&nbsp;prevailing strata are the Lower Silurian rocks; but in the&nbsp;east there is a considerable area occupied by Old Red Sandstone, and throughout the county felspathic ash and greenstone are found, while near Old Radnor there is a large&nbsp;patch of Silurian limestone. Lead and copper are said to&nbsp;exist, but not in quantities sufficient to pay the working.&nbsp;There are saline, sulphurous, and chalybeate wells at Llandrindod. The Wye enters the county in the north-west,&nbsp;18 miles from its source in Plinlimmon, and flowing in a&nbsp;south-easterly direction divides it from Brecknock, until it&nbsp;bends north-east and reaches Hay, after which it for some&nbsp;distance forms the boundary with Hereford. Its principal tributary is the Ithon, which flows south-west and&nbsp;joins it 7 miles above Builth. The Teme, flowing southeast, forms the northern boundary of the county with&nbsp;Shropshire. The Llugw, rising in the northern part of&nbsp;the county, flows south-east into Hereford, a little below&nbsp;Presteigne.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Agriculture.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—The climate is somewhat damp, and in the spring cold and ungenial. The greater part of the county is suitable only&nbsp;for pasturage, but there is some good arable land in the valleys in&nbsp;the southern and south-eastern districts, which produces excellent&nbsp;crops of turnips, oats, and Welsh barley, the soil being chiefly&nbsp;open shaly clay, although in the east there is an admixture of red&nbsp;sandstone soils. In 1884 there w<sup>r</sup>ere 156,628 acres, or about five-ninths of the total area, under cultivation, and of these 114,242&nbsp;acres, or about four-fifths, were in permanent pasture. Of the&nbsp;21,356 acres under corn crops 12,245 acres, or more than half,&nbsp;were under oats, whilst wheat occupied 5200 acres and barley 3853.&nbsp;Green crops occupied only 7100 acres, of which 1107 were under&nbsp;potatoes and 5682 under turnips. Horses numbered 9249 (3755&nbsp;used solely for agricultural purposes), cattle 30,917 (10,223 cows&nbsp;and heifers in milk or in calf), and sheep as many as 244,771.&nbsp;The inhabitants are dependent almost solely on agriculture, the&nbsp;manufactures being confined chiefly to coarse cloth, stockings, and&nbsp;flannel for home use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Railways.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—The county is intersected by several lines: the Central Wales Railway runs south-west from Knighton to Llandovery ; another line runs south-eastwards by Rhayader and Builth&nbsp;and joins the Hereford line, which passes by Hay and Talgarth ;&nbsp;while another branch line passes by Kineton to New Radnor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Administration and Population.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—Radnor comprises six hundreds, but contains no municipal borough. It has one court of quarter sessions and is divided into six petty and special sessional&nbsp;divisions. The ancient borough of Radnor (population 2005) is&nbsp;governed by the provisions of an old charter, and has a commission&nbsp;of the peace. The county contains sixty civil parishes with part of&nbsp;one other, and is partly in the diocese of St David’s and partly in&nbsp;that of Hereford. It returns one member to the House of Commons. The population in 1871 was 25,430 and in 1881 it was&nbsp;23,528, of whom 11,939 were males and 11,589 females. ,The&nbsp;number of inhabited houses was 4775. The average number of&nbsp;persons to an acre was 009־ and of acres to a person 1175־.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">History and Antiquities.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—During the Roman occupation the district was included in the province of Siluria. The Roman road&nbsp;from Chester to Caermarthen entered the northern extremity of&nbsp;the county near Newtown and, following the valley of the Ithon,&nbsp;crossed the Wye and entered Brecknockshire near the town of&nbsp;Builth. There are remains of a Roman station at Cym near Llandrindod, and at Wapley Hill near Presteigne there is a very good&nbsp;example of a British camp. The district was afterwards included&nbsp;chiefly in Powis, but partly in Gwent and partly in Feryllwge. It&nbsp;was made a county by Henry VIII. Anciently it was called Maesy-fedd. The name Radnor is also of very great antiquity, and occurs&nbsp;in the Cambrian annals as early as 1196. There are no ancient&nbsp;castles claiming special notice, and the only ecclesiastical ruin of&nbsp;importance is that of the abbey of Cwm-Hir, founded for the Cistercians in 1143, and occupying a romantic situation in the vale of&nbsp;Clywedog. A considerable portion of the ancient building has been&nbsp;used as materials for the adjoining modern mansion.</span></p>
