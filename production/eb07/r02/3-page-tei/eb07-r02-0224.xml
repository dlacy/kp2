N.</p><p>ROSCIUS, Q, a celebrated comic actor, who is spoken of in terms of the highest commendation by Cicero. The exact period of his birth is unknown ; but he must have been somewhat older than Cicero (born b. c. 106), as he had already earned a high reputation before the death of Sulla, B. c. 78. His subsequent career was said to have been predicted by a strange occurrence whilst he was still a child. His early years were spent at Solonium, near Lanuvium ; and whilst he was sleeping in his cradle, a serpent entwined itself round his body without injuring him. This circumstance in the life of the actor was afterwards represented by the artist Praxiteles, and celebrated by the poet Archias. The orator afterwards remarks, that it seems ridiculous that the gods should predict the future fate of an actor, whilst they neglected statesmen and heroes, whom the world admired. Of his education we know nothing, except that he and Æsopus the tragic actor used to attend the forum when Hortensius the orator pleaded, that they might imitate on the stage what they admired in him. He had a particular squint of the eye, hut this was of course concealed by the mask he wore. His private character was highly respected, and Cicero remarked that he was such an artist that he seemed the only one fit to appear upon the stage, and yet so excellent a man tllat it was beneath his dignity, which he thought worthy of the senate. He used to contend with Cicero which of them could represent the same sentiment in the greatest variety of ways, he by acting, and Cicero by his eloquence. So high an opinion did he entertain of his profession, that he wrote a work comparing it with oratory. He gave lessons in elocution, and used to say that he never had a pupil whom he could altogether approve of. His gains as an actor are variously stated, by Macrobius at 1000 denarii (L.32.5s. 10d.) a day ; and by Cicero at 600,000 sesterces for ten years (L.48,434. 10s.), which would make it somewhat less than L.5000 a year ; but for the last ten years he had refused to receive this pension from the Roman people. He had a dispute with one Fannius Chcerea respecting a slave, of whom they were joint owners, and he was defended by Cicero ; but at what time this took place we have no means of judging. Only a part of the speech has been preserved. He died a little before the time (about b. c. 61) that Cicero delivered his oration in defence of Archias.</p><p>ROSCOE, William, a distinguished writer, was born at Liverpool on the 8th of March 1753. He was the only son of William Roscoe, who then kept a public-house called the Bowling Green, and who is described as a man below the middle stature, but of remarkable bodily strength and activity ; of much vivacity of temperament, and greatly attached to field-sports and other amusements, for which his son never acquired any relish. He had also an only daughter, who became the wife of Daniel Daulby, Esq. With the charge of his public-house he united that of a market-garden ; but during his declining age, he retired to Charnock, his native place, and was for many years supported by his son. Two years before his death, Mr Roscoe removed him to his own house at Birchfield, where his latter days were soothed by the assiduous kindness of his two children. Having reached an advanced age, he died in 1796. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, is said to have been a woman of a superior mind and of warm affections, and to have exercised over the character of her son an influence, of which the effects were never obliterated to the latcst period of his life</p><lb/><p>The first elements of learning he acquired under the tuition of a schoolmistress ; and at the age of six, he was removed to a day-school kept by Mr Martin in Paradise Street. After an interval of about two years, he became the pupil of Mr Sykes, who, in the same house, kept a school for writing, arithmetic, and English grammar. He had a numerous seminary, and was considered as a good instructor in his own department. At the age of twelve Roscoe quitted this school, the master having reported that his scholar had learned all that he professed to teach ; which, besides English grammar, included the common rules of arithmetic, algebra, and mensuration. He acquired a very early relish for reading, and particularly for poetical reading. “ I was at this period of my life,” he has recorded, “ of a wild, rambling, and unsocial disposition ; passing many of my hours in strolling along the shore of the river Mersey, or in fishing, or in taking long walks alone....I now began to assist my father in his agricultural concerns, particularly in his business of cultivating potatoes for sale, of which he every year grew several acres, and which he sold, when produced early in the season, at very advanced prices. His mode of cultivation was entirely by the spade ; and when raised early, they were considered in that part of Lancashire as a favourite esculent. When they had attained their proper growth, we were accustomed to carry them to the market on our heads, in large baskets, for sale, where I was generally intrusted with the disposal of them, and soon became a very useful assistant to my father. In this and other laborious occupations, particularly in the care of a garden, in which I took great pleasure, I passed several years of my life, devoting my hours of relaxation to reading my books. This mode of life gave health and vigour to my body, and amusement and instruction to my mind ; and to this day I well remember the delicious sleep which succeeded my labours, from which I was again called at an early hour. If I were now asked whom I consider to be happiest of the human race, I should answer, those who cultivate the earth by their own hands.”</p><p>Having reached his fifteenth year, he found it expedient to make choice of a profession. His love of reading induced him to prefer the avocation of a bookseller ; but he was disappointed in his expectation of finding it altogether pleasant, and after a trial of a month, he returned to his rustic labours. In the course of the ensuing year, 1769, he was articled to a young attorney, who died before the completion of his clerkship. The remainder of it was passed in the office of Mr Peter Ellames, who was eminent in his profession, and who was much satisfied with his pupil’s talents and industry. During this period, he still continued to reside with his father, but he had previously the misfortune to Jose his mother. Although very punctual in his attention to business, he always found some precious intervals of leisure for the cultivation of his literary talents ; and his early love of poetry had its usual effect in purifying and refining the taste. His chief favourite was Shenstone, with whose elegant simplicity he appears to have been greatly captivated. He cultivated an intimate friendship with other ingenuous youths, who cherished the same love of literature. In conjunction with two ot these, William Clarke and Richard Lowndes, he applied himself to the study of the ancient languages ; and with these individuals, to the close of their lives, he continued in habits of the strictest intimacy. They had another associate, who was capable of directing as well as participating in their studies. This was Francis Holden, a young man of uncommon talents, who was an assistant in his uncle’s school, where it was his business to teach, not only mathematics, but likewise the Greek, Latin, Italian, and French languages. They were accustomed to meet early in the morning, and to pursue their classical studies till the hours of business called them to less genial avocations. It was the example</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
