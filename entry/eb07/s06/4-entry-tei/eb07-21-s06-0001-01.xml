                <p><label>SURVEYING</label> .</p>
                <p>THE system of rules and operations by which the relative position of any number
                    of points in a tract of country may be determined, so that it may be delineated
                    on a plane surface, is called surveying. When the extent of country is not
                    great, the subject involves little difficulty ; but when a kingdom, such as
                    Britain or France, is to be surveyed, in addition to some of the more profound
                    theories of pure mathematics, the aid of astronomy, and other branches of
                    natural philosophy, is required ; but such an extensive view of the subject will
                    not be expected in this work.</p>
                <p>As a surveyor has perpetual occasion for calculation, it is necessary that he be
                    thoroughly master of arithmetic, and understand the nature of logarithms, the
                    use of logarithmic tables, and algebraic notation. As it is his business to
                    investigate and measure lines and angles, and to describe them on paper, he
                    should be well acquainted with the elements of geometry and trigonometry, and
                    with the application of their principles to the mensuration of heights,
                    distances, and surfaces. In particular, he should be familiar with the best
                    practical methods of solving the ordinary geometrical problems, and should be
                    expert in drawing lines and describing figures. He should know something of the
                    principles of geology, optics, and magnetism, and possess some skill in drawing
                    and painting.</p>
                <p>In a survey, the most remarkable objects, such as the summits of hills, spires,
                    towers, &amp;c. must be chosen as stations, and, if necessary, marked by
                    signals. These must be considered as joined by straight lines forming a chain of
                    triangles, each connected with all the others. Thc angles of the triangles
                    should neither be very acute nor very obtuse ; their sides should be as long as
                    possible, so as to admit of two of the stations, at the angles, being seen from
                    the third: the nearer each triangle approaches to the equilateral form, the
                    better. The three angles of each triangle should be measured, if possible, for
                    although two of them be sufficient to determine the third, yet it will conduce
                    to accuracy if all the three be taken ; and if their sum hardly differ from
                    180°, it may be supposed that they have been correctly determined. The principal
                    points should also be intersected as much as possible by lines from different
                    stations, to ascertain whether different data give the same position.</p>
                <p>A theodolite is the most convenient instrument for measuring thc angles, because
                    it gives them at once reduced to the plane of the horizon. When a sextant is
                    used, the angles, if out of that plane, must be reduced to it by
                    calculation.</p>
                <p>Supposing a proper disposition of the triangles to have been made, when their
                    angles are known, if a side of any one of them were also known, then the sides
                    of all the others might be found by calculation, and a plan of the country
                    constructed. Therefore, a side of one of the triangles must be taken as a base,
                    and measured with great care, for upon this the just determination of the
                    absolute length of all the other lines depends ; and if the survey be extensive,
                    it will be proper to assume another base, called a base of verification, and
                    compare its measured with its calculated length. The base should be as long as
                    possible, and lie on a flat surface; if it is not perfectly level, its slope
                    must be measured, and its horizontal length calculated. In ordinary cases, the
                    base may be measured by a chain or tape, but more accurately by stretching a
                    rope, 100 yards or more, tight in its direction, and applying repeatedly to it a
                    twenty-feet deal-rod. A pin may be stuck in the rope at the fore-end of the rod,
                    each time it is removed, and before the rope is removed to a new position : a
                    point directly under the end of the last rod may be marked on the top of a peg
                    fixed in the ground. In the trigonometrical survey of Britain, which has been
                    going on ever since 1784, under the direction of the Board of Ordnance, an
                    original base of about five miles was measured three times over, first with
                    twenty-feet deal-rods, then with glass rods of the same length, and at a later
                    period by a hundred feet steel chain of a particular construction. Several bases
                    of verification have<pb facs="chi.12945678-1526170221_Page_0013.jpf"
                        xml:id="eb07-21-s06-0002"/> also been measured. The labour and ingenuity
                    exerted in these operations have been very great.</p>
                <p>As, generally speaking, all bodies expand by heat and contract by cold, a rod or
                    chain varies in absolute length as it varies in temperature. A steel rod at the
                    temperature of water boiling is the one thousandth part longer than at the
                    temperature of water freezing. Hence, when great accuracy is required, the
                    temperature of the measure must be noted, that its precise length may be
                    known.</p>
                <p>When the sides of the primary triangles are known, they serve as bases by which
                    the situation of objects near them may be determined. In this way, the position
                    of any number of points in a road, or the course of a river, also the situation
                    of towns, country-seats, the boundaries of enclosures, and every feature of a
                    country, may be found, and laid down in a plan or map : and to construct it with
                    accuracy, the principal points should be laid down by their calculated distances
                    from each other, rather than by the measures of the angles formed by the lines
                    joining them, because a point may be more correctly laid down by the
                    intersection of two arcs of circles, than by that of lines which make given
                    angles with a third line.</p>
                <p>A small extent of the earth’s surface may be regarded as a plane, and lines
                    perpendicular to it as parallel to one another. However, in an extensive survey,
                    such as that of Britain, the curvature of the earth must be taken into account,
                    and then its figure and magnitude enter as elements into all the
                    calculations.</p>
                <p>This connection between the figure of the earth and the magnitude and position of
                    lines traced on its surface affords, reversely, the means of determining the
                    former when the latter are known : so that such surveys, besides their immediate
                    object, are applicable to the solution of the still more sublime problem of
                    finding the magnitude and figure of the earth itself.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of Terrestrial Refraction.</hi></p>
                <p>It is a matter of experience, that the rays of light proceeding from the heavenly
                    bodies are bent from their original rectilineal direction in passing through the
                    atmosphere. A ray in its progress may be considered as passing through a very
                    great number of thin <hi rend="italic">strata</hi> of air, which are denser the
                    nearer they are to the earth ; and these, by their action on the particles of
                    light, bend the ray downwards, so that, in fact, its path is a curve line
                    concave towards the earth, and situated in a vertical plane passing through the
                    luminous object and the eye of the observer.</p>
                <p>To understand the nature of this effect, let AB (fig. 1) represent a portion of
                    the earth’s surface, and DFG the upper boundary of the atmosphere : a succession
                    of particles of light from the sun or a star S, proceed on a straight line,
                    until they arrive at F ; afterwards, in their passage through the atmosphere,
                    their path is gradually bent into the curve FE, so that when they reach the eye
                    at E, the object S appears as if it were at S', in the direction of a straight
                    line which touches the curve at E.</p>
                <p>This bending of the ray is called <hi rend="italic">refraction ;</hi> it
                    increases the apparent elevation of the heavenly bodies above the horizon,
                    except when they are in the zenith, and in that position there is no
                    refraction.</p>
                <p>The rays of light, by which terrestrial objects are rendered visible, are, in
                    their passage through the atmosphere, bent downwards, exactly as those
                    proceeding from the heavenly bodies ; so that the apparent elevation of a remote
                    object is always greater than its true elevation. This incurvation is called <hi
                        rend="italic">terrestrial refraction ;</hi> in the case of the heavenly
                    bodies, it is <hi rend="italic">astronomical</hi> refraction.</p>
                <p>Terrestrial refraction varies with the state of the atmosphere, so that an object
                    appears more elevated at one time than at another : the displacement, however,
                    is always in a vertical plane, but never sensibly in a horizontal direction. How
                    it may be found for any case will appear from the following problem.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Prob.</hi> I.</p>
                <p>Having given the apparent positions of two remote stations, as seen from each
                    other <hi rend="italic">ar the same instant,</hi> to determine the error
                    produced by refraction.</p>
                <p>Let A and B be the stations (fig. 2), and C the earth’s centre ; draw the lines
                    CA, CB, and produce them towards Z and V, the zeniths of the stations ; join AB
                    ; then the true zenith distance of B, as seen from A, is the angle ZAB, and the
                    true zenith distance of A, as seen from B, is the angle VBA. These, however,
                    cannot be directly measured, for, by refraction, the point B, as seen from A,
                    appears elevated to the position <hi rend="italic">b;</hi> and the point A, as
                    seen from B, is elevated to the position <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> The errors,
                    then, produced by refraction are the angles <hi rend="italic">b</hi> AB and <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> BA, and these will be nearly equal, if the angles be

                    same time, or making a signal at one station so as to be seen from the

                    horizontal line AH in the plane of the triangle ABC, then BAH will be the
                    apparent angle of elevation or depression of B, according as it is above or
                    below the horizon of A.</p>
                <p>Take CD = CA, and join AD ; the line BD is the difference between the heights of
                    the stations A and B, and to determine BD, the vertical angle BAD must be known
                    ; now this angle differs from the apparent elevation BAH by the angle HAD,
                    therefore HAD is the correction of the vertical angle, depending on the earth’s
                    curvature.</p>
                <p>In the isosceles triangle ACD, the sum of its angles, that is, 2CAD + C, is equal
                    to two right angles <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geom.</hi> 11 and 24, 1 ), and
                    therefore CAD + ½C = one right angle ; but CAH is a right angle, therefore CAH =
                    CAD + ½C, and taking away the common angle CAD, there remains HAD = ½C. Hence
                    the correction on account of the earth’s curvature is <hi rend="italic">half the
                        arc intercepted between the stations.</hi></p>

                    from A, the corrected vertical angle will be the sum of its apparent elevation

                    but if B be below the horizon, then it will be the excess of half C above the
                    apparent depression.</p>

                    between the stations on Wisp Hill and Cross Fell was found to be 235,018∙6 feet,
                    which, reckoning 6094½ feet to a minute, corresponds to 38' 33"∙7 on the earth’s
                    surface. From Wisp Hill, Cross Fell appeared depressed below its horizon 2' 31";
                    but, by a corresponding observation at the other station, the error arising from
                    refraction was estimated at 2’ 37"∙3. Hence the difference between the heights
                    of the stations is required.</p>
                <p>Let A be Wisp Hill, B Cross Fell. The observed depression HAB was 2' 31”; but as
                    the line AB was elevated 2' 37"∙3 by refraction, the correct value of HAB was 2'
                    31" + 2' 37"∙3 = 5' 8'∙3. This subtracted from HAD = ½C = 19' 16"∙8, leaves 14'
                    8"∙5 for the vertical angle BAD. And because in the triangle BAD the angle D is
                    almost a right angle, therefore BD will be found by this proportion ; rad.: tan.

                <p>On a survey, it will sometimes happen that the instrument cannot he conveniently
                    placed at the very centre of a station, in order to determine the angles
                    subtended by remote objects : it must then be placed at a point near the
                    station, and the angles taken at that point must be corrected by calculation, so
                    as to reduce them to the centre. How this may be done is shown in the next

                    ; also the distances C A, CB, or at least their values nearly, it is required to
                    find the difference between the angles ACB, A OB.</p>
                <p>Let I be the intersection of AC and BO; and because the angle AIB is the sum of

                    ; therefore</p>
                <p>ACB + CBO = AOB + CAO, and ACB — AOB = CAO — CBO.</p>
                <p>Now, in the triangles COA, COB,</p>
                <p>CA : CO : : sin. COA : sin. CAO, CB : CO : : sin. COB : sin. CBO.</p>
                <p>From these proportions, the angles CAO, CBO may be found, and their difference,

                    the angle C at the station. This may be done by moving it along OB until the

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of Surveying with a compass.</hi></p>
                <p>When a tract of country is to be surveyed with expedition, and no great degree of
                    accuracy is required, the compass, notwithstanding its imperfections, is
                    preferable to any other instrument. Even in a correct survey, it may be applied
                    with advantage in filling up the less important parts of a plan.</p>
                <p>The principle which renders the compass applicable to surveying is generally
                    known. The instrument should admit of being fixed in a horizontal position on
                    the top of a staff, and it should be furnished with two sights diametrically
                    opposite to each other. The circumference of a circle immediately under or
                    opposite to the point of the needle should be divided into degrees, and it may
                    be numbered both ways, beginning from the extremities of the diameter that
                    passes through the sights ; or it may be numbered all one way from 0 <hi
                        rend="superscript"> o</hi> to 360°, beginning at a point immediately under
                    one of the sights.</p>
                <p>The use of the instrument is to determine the bearings of objects as seen from
                    each other, or the angles which the lines joining them make with the magnetic
                    meridian. Thus, if the perimeter of a polygon is to be surveyed and laid down on
                    paper, the instrument must be placed at one of its angles, so that an object at
                    the next angle may be seen through the two sights. The needle of the compass
                    being then allowed to turn freely on its pivot, it will settle in the magnetic
                    meridian, and point out on the divided circle the number of degrees the line
                    deviates from thc north or south and on which side of the meridian it lies. If
                    this be done at each angle, the positions of all the lines in respect of the
                    magnetic meridians passing through their intersections will be determined. The
                    sides of the polygon may be measured in passing from one angle to another ; and
                    then, as thc meridians may be supposed parallels, sufficient data will be
                    obtained for constructing a plan of the figure, and verifying the accuracy of
                    the survey ; for any angle of the figure will manifestly be equal to the sum or
                    difference of the angles which the lines that contain it make with the meridian
                    passing through their intersection, according as they lie on opposite sides or
                    the same side of that meridian.<pb facs="chi.12945678-1526170221_Page_0018.jpf"
                        xml:id="eb07-21-s06-0007"/> All the angles of the figure may therefore be
                    found ; and, if they have been accurately observed, their sum, together with
                    four right angles, will make twice as many right angles as th figure has sides
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">(Geom.</hi> 21, 1). If the survey begin and end at thc
                    same point, the positions of the beginning and end ought to coincide in the
                    plan.</p>
                <p>If the lines which join the objects do not form an enclosed figure, still the
                    manner of proceeding may be the very same ; and the positions of many points may
                    be determined by observing their bearings from other points having given
                    positions in the plan, without the trouble of measuring distances on the ground
                    ; and, in the whole process, the compass serves merely as an instrument for
                    measuring angles.</p>
                <p>In practice, the figure may be constructed in the field, or else a mode of
                    registering the observations may be easily devised, from which a plan may be
                    afterwards made ; and it may prevent mistakes, if the bearings of all the
                    objects be reckoned from the north quite round the circle in one direction,
                    either to the right or left. Thus, proceeding to the right, we may consider all
                    lines on the east side of the meridian between due north and due south as making
                    with it angles between 0° and 180°, and all lines on the west side between due
                    south and due north as making angles between 180° and 360°.</p>
                <p>It must be recollected that the magnetic does not coincide with the true
                    meridian, and that the angle between them, called the variation of the compass,
                    changes. It varies at different times and in different places (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Magnetism).</hi> In 1823 it was 27° 48' at Edinburgh, and
                    24° 10' at London : the deviation was westerly.</p>
                <p>This mode of surveying was applied by Richard Norwood, an English mathematician
                    of the seventeenth century, to determine the magnitude of the earth. Having
                    found the latitudes of London and York, he travelled from the one place to the
                    other, measuring along the road with a chain, and taking the bearings with a
                    compass. He says, “ When I measured not, I paced ; and I believe the experiment
                    has come within a scantling of the truth.”</p>
                <p>In our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Mensuration,</hi> we have explained the
                    principal problems by which heights and distances are determined by trigonometry
                    : these find continual application in surveying. The theory of levelling is a
                    branch of the same subject ; this has been discussed in a particular article
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Levelling).</hi> Maritime surveying requires the
                    solution of this problem : <hi rend="italic">Three stations being given, and the
                        angles which the lines joining them subtend at a fourth station in their

                    printed, Dr Wallace, emeritus professor of mathematics in the University of
                    Edinburgh, lias published a work entitled “ Geometrical Theorems and Analytical
                    Formulæ,” in which various new formulas and constructions are given for this and
                    other geodetical problems.</p>
