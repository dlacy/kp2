or more properly Ribe, is a sea-port town and capital of the district of Ribe, in the province of North Jutland, Denmark, and is situated on the river Nipsaae,which here falls into the North Sea. The harbour is difficult of access, and admits only of small vessels. There is a castlc, two colleges, and a public library ; but the principal building is the cathedral, which is a handsome structure, and contains many of the tombs of the kings of Denmark. The bishopric is the most ancient, not only of Denmark, but also of Sweden and Norway. The town carries on a considerable trade in linen ; and it also exports corn, horses, and cattle. The population in the year 1834 amounted to 2365.</p>
