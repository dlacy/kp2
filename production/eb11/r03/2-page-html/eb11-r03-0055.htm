<p><span class="font1">RIGORD (c. 1150-c. 1209), French chronicler, was probably born near Alais in Languedoc, and became a physician. Afterwards becoming a monk he entered the monastery of Argenteuil,&nbsp;and then that of St Denis, and described himself as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regis&nbsp;Francorum Chronographus.</span><span class="font1"> Rigor wrote the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gesta Philippi&nbsp;Augusti,</span><span class="font1"> dealing with the Efe of the French king, Philip ,&nbsp;Augustus, from his coronation in 1179 until 1206. The work,&nbsp;which is very valuable, was abridged and continued by William&nbsp;the Breton (q.v.). The earlier part of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gesta</span><span class="font1"> speaks of the&nbsp;king in very laudatory terms, but in the latter part it is much&nbsp;less flattering in its tone. It is published in tome xvii. of&nbsp;Dom Bouquet’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Recueil des historiens des Gaules el de la France&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Paris, 1738-1876); and with introduction by H. F. Delaborde&nbsp;(Paris, 1882-85). A French translation of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gesta</span><span class="font1"> is in tome&nbsp;xi. of Guizot’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collection des mémoires relatifs à Vhistoire de&nbsp;France</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1825).

<p><span class="font1">RIGORISM (Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rigor,</span><span class="font1"> stiffness, firmness), a philosophical term appEed by Kant specially to those moralists who take up&nbsp;an anti-hedonist or ascetic standpoint. In general the term&nbsp;is opposed to “ latitudinarianism ” or “ indifferentism,”—&nbsp;respectively a morality of compromise and a morality of pure&nbsp;indifference,—and signifies insistence upon the strictest interpretation of a principle, rule or criterion. Thus, in Roman&nbsp;Catholic theology, a rigorist holds that in cases of conscience&nbsp;the proper course is to adhere to the strict wording of the law&nbsp;in question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RILEY, JAMES WHITCOMB (1853- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), American poet,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">was born in Greenfield, Indiana, in 1853. He spent several years as an itinerant sign-painter, actor and musician. During&nbsp;this vagabond experience he had opportunities to revise plays&nbsp;and compose songs, and was brought into close touch with&nbsp;the rural folk of Indiana, becoming famiEar with their life and&nbsp;speech. About 1873 he first contributed verses, especially in&nbsp;the Hoosier dialect, to the papers, and he soon became local&nbsp;editor of the Anderson (Ind.) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Democrat.</span><span class="font1"> In August 1877, over&nbsp;the initials “ E.A.P.,” he printed in the Kokomo (Indiana)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dispatch</span><span class="font1"> a poem, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Leonainie,</span><span class="font1"> in the manner of Poe.@@<sup>1</sup> The press&nbsp;throughout the country copied the oem, and many critics&nbsp;of acknowledged authority believed it to have been actually&nbsp;written by Poe, until the hoax was explained by the paper in&nbsp;which it first appeared. To the Indianapolis </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Journal&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Riley contributed many poems, the best known being a series&nbsp;in dialect which purported to have been written by one “ Benjamin F.

He wrote short stories and&nbsp;sketches, some of unusual merit, but is known almost exclusively&nbsp;as a poet. Of his poems some are in conventional English many&nbsp;others in the Hoosier dialect of the Middle-West. His materials&nbsp;are the homely incidents and aspects of village and country life, especially of Indiana, and his manner is marked by delicate&nbsp;imagination and naïve humour and tenderness. </span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> The poem was accompanied by a statement from the editor of the paper that it was “ from the gifted pen of the erratic poet,&nbsp;Edgar Allan Poe,” and by a circumstantial story to the effect that&nbsp;the poem had been found written on the fly-leaf of an old Latin-English dictionary then owned by ‘‘an uneducated and illiterate&nbsp;man ” in Kokomo, who had received it from his grandfather, in&nbsp;whose tavern, near Richmond, Va., it had been left by “ a young man&nbsp;who showed plainly the marks of dissipation.”</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

<p><span class="font1">RIMBAUD, JEAN ARTHUR (1854-1891), French poet and adventurer, was born at Charleville, in the Ardennes, on the 20th&nbsp;of October 1854. He was the second son of a captain in the&nbsp;French army, who in i860 abandoned his wife and family.&nbsp;From early childhood Arthur Rimbaud, who was severely&nbsp;brought up by his mother, displayed rich intellectual gifts and a&nbsp;sullen, violent temperament. He began to write when he was&nbsp;ten, and some of the poems which now appear in his works belong&nbsp;to his fifteenth year. Before he was sixteen, in consequence of a&nbsp;violent quarrel with his mother, the boy escaped from CharleviIle&nbsp;with a packet of his verse, was arrested as a vagabond, and for a&nbsp;fortnight was locked up in the Mazas prison, Paris. A few days&nbsp;after being taken home Rimbaud escaped again, into Belgium,&nbsp;where he Eved for some time as a tramp, Mmost starved, but&nbsp;writing verses with feverish assiduity. In February 1871 he left&nbsp;his mother for a third time, and made his way to Paris, where he&nbsp;knew no one, and whence, after very nearly dying of hunger and&nbsp;exposure, he begged his way back to Charleville. There he wrote&nbsp;in the same year the extraordinary poem of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Bateau ivre,</span><span class="font1"> which&nbsp;is now hailed as the pioneer- of the entire “ symboEst ” or&nbsp;“ decadent ” movement in French literature in aU its forms.&nbsp;He sent it to Verlaine, who encouraged the boy of seventeen&nbsp;(whom he supposed to be a man of thirty) to come again to Paris.&nbsp;Rimbaud spent from October 1871 to July 1872 in the capital,&nbsp;partly with Verlaine, partly as the guest of Théodore de Banville,&nbsp;and served in the army of the Commune. With Verlaine he&nbsp;travelled for thirteen months, after the faU of the Commune,&nbsp;through England and Belgium, where in 1873 he pubEshed the&nbsp;only work which he ever printed, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Une Saison en Enfer,</span><span class="font1"> in prose;&nbsp;in this he gives an allegorical account of his extravagant relations&nbsp;with Verlaine, which ended at Brussels by a double attempt of&nbsp;the latter to murder his young companion. On the second&nbsp;occasion Rimbaud was dangerously wounded by Verlaine’s&nbsp;revolver, and the elder poet was imprisoned at Mons for two&nbsp;years. MeanwhileRimbaud, deeply disillusioned, determined&nbsp;to abandon Europe and Eterature, and he ceased at the age of&nbsp;nineteen to write poetry. He settled for a while at Stuttgart,&nbsp;studying German, and in 1875 he disappeared. He set out on&nbsp;foot for Italy, and after extraordinary adventures found employment as a day-labourer in the docks at Leghorn. Returning to&nbsp;Paris, he obtained a little money from his mother, and then&nbsp;definitely vanished. For sixteen years nothing whatever was&nbsp;heard of him, but it is now known that he embarked as a Dutch&nbsp;soldier for the Sunda Isles, and, presently deserting, fled to&nbsp;Sumatra and then to Java, where he lived for some time in the&nbsp;forest. Returning to Europe, after a vagabond life in every&nbsp;capital, he obtained in 1880 some menial employment in the&nbsp;quarries of Cyprus, and then worked his way to Aden and up&nbsp;into Abyssinia, where he was one of the pioneers of European&nbsp;commercial adventure. Here he settled, at Harrar, as a trader&nbsp;in coffee and perfumes, to which he afterwards added gold and&nbsp;ivory; for the next eleven years, during which he led many&nbsp;commercial expeditions into unknown parts of northern Africa,&nbsp;Shoa and Harrar were his headquarters, and he lived almost&nbsp;entirely with the natives, and as one of themselves. From 1888&nbsp;to 1891, having prospered greatly as </span><span class="font0">a</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">merchant, he became&nbsp;a sort of semi-independent chieftain, intriguing for France, just</span></p>
