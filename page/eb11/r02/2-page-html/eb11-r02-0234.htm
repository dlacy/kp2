<p><span class="font2">Rhone becomes officially “ navigable,” though as far as Lyons the navigation now consists all but wholly of the floating of&nbsp;flat-bottomed boats, named </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rigues,</span><span class="font2"> laden chiefly with stone&nbsp;quarried from the banks of the river. Above Seyssel (n m.&nbsp;from Bellegarde) the Usses (left) joins the Rhone, while just&nbsp;below that village the Fier (left) flows in from the Lake of&nbsp;Annecy. Below the junction of the Fier the hills sink on either&nbsp;side, the channel of the river widens, and one may say that it&nbsp;leaves the mountains for the plains. At Culoz (41J m. by rail&nbsp;from Geneva) the railway from Geneva to Lyons (105 m.) quits&nbsp;the Rhone in order to run west by a direct route past Amberieu.&nbsp;The Rhone continues to roll on southwards, but no longer (as&nbsp;no doubt it did in ancient days) enters the Lac du Bourget, of&nbsp;which it receives the waters through a canal, and then leaves&nbsp;it on the east in order to run along the foot of the last spur of&nbsp;the Jura. It flows past Yenne (left) and beneath the picturesque&nbsp;fortress (formerly a Carthusian monastery) of Pierre Chatcl&nbsp;(right) before it attains the foot of the extreme southern spur of&nbsp;the Jura, at a height of 696 ft., not far from the village of Cordon,&nbsp;and just where the Guiers flows in (left) from the mountains&nbsp;of the Grande Chartreuse. This is nearly the last of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cluses&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">through which the river has to make its way. The very last&nbsp;is at the Pont du Saut or Sault, a little S. of Lagnieu. The river&nbsp;now widens, but the neighbouring country is much exposed to&nbsp;inundations. It receives (right) its most important tributary&nbsp;in this part of its course, the Ain, which descends from the&nbsp;French slope of the Jura and is navigable for about 60 m. above&nbsp;its junction with the Rhone. Farther down the Rhone meanders&nbsp;for a time with shifting channels in a bed about 2 m. broad,&nbsp;but it gathers into a single stream before its junction with the&nbsp;Saône, just below Lyons. The Saône </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> which has received&nbsp;(left) the Doubs, is the real continuation of the Rhone, both&nbsp;from a geographical and a commercial point of view, and it is&nbsp;by means of canals branching off from the course of the Saône&nbsp;that the Rhone communicates with the basins of the Loire,&nbsp;the Seine, the Rhine and the Moselle. In fact, up to Lyons,&nbsp;the Rhone (save when it expands into the Lake of Geneva) is&nbsp;a huge and very unruly mountain torrent rather than a great&nbsp;European river.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. Below Lyons, however, the Rhone becomes one of the&nbsp;great historical rivers of France. It was up its valley that&nbsp;first Greek, then Latin civilization penetrated from the Mediterranean to Lyons, as well as in the 10th century the Saracen&nbsp;bandits from their settlement at La Garde Freinet, near the&nbsp;coast of Provence. Then, too, from Lyons downwards, the&nbsp;Rhone serves as a great medium of commerce by which central&nbsp;France sends its products to the sea. Its length from Lyons&nbsp;to the sea is some 230 m., though its fall is but 530 ft. But&nbsp;during this half of its course it can boast of having on its left&nbsp;bank (the right bank is very poor in this respect) such historical&nbsp;cities as Vienne, Valence, Avignon, Tarascon and Arles, while&nbsp;it receives (left) the Isère, the Drôme and the Durance rivers,&nbsp;all formed by the union of many streams, and bringing down&nbsp;the waters that flow from the lofty snowy Dauphiné Alps.&nbsp;The Ardèche is the only considerable affluent from the right.&nbsp;Near Arles, about 25 m. from the sea, and by rail 175! m. from&nbsp;Lyons, the river breaks up into its two main branches, the&nbsp;Grand Rhone running S.E. and the Petit Rhone S.W.; they&nbsp;enclose between them the huge delta of the Camargue, which&nbsp;is cultivated on the banks of the river only, but elsewhere is&nbsp;simply a great alluvial plain, deposited in the course of ages&nbsp;by the river, and now composed of scanty pasturages and of&nbsp;great salt marshes. Between Lyons and the sea, the Rhone&nbsp;divides four departments on its right bank (Rhône, Loire,&nbsp;Ardèche and Gard) from as many on its left bank (Isère,&nbsp;Drôme, Vaucluse and Bouches du Rhone).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RHÔNE, a department of south-eastern France, formed in 1793 from the eastern portion of the department of Rhône-et-Loire, and comprising the old districts of Beaujolais, Lyonnais,&nbsp;Franc-Lyonnais, Forez and a small portion of Dauphiné. Pop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(1906) 858,907. Area, Π04 sq m. Rhône is bounded N. by the department of Saône-et-Loire, E. by Ain and Isère and S. and&nbsp;W. by Loire. The Saône and the Rhone form its natural&nbsp;boundary on the east. The department belongs almost entirely&nbsp;to the basin of the Rhone, to which it sends its waters by the&nbsp;Saône and its tributary the Azergues, and by the Gier. The&nbsp;mountains which cover the surface of the department constitute the watershed between the Rhone and the Loire, and&nbsp;from north to south form four Successivegroups—the Beaujolais&nbsp;Mountains, the highest peak of which is 3320 ft.; the Tarare&nbsp;group; the Lyonnais Mountains (nearly 3000 ft.); and Mont&nbsp;Pilat, the highest peak of which belongs to the department of&nbsp;Loire. The lowest point of the dëpartment (460 ft. above sea-level) is at the egress of thc Rhone. The meteorological conditions vary greatly with the elevation and exposure. Snow&nbsp;sometimes lies in the mountains from November to April,&nbsp;while at Lyons and in the valleys the mean temperature in winter&nbsp;is 36° F. and in summer 70°, the annual mean being 53°. The&nbsp;average rainfall is somewhat higher than is general over France&nbsp;owing to the amount of the precipitation on the hilly region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Good agricultural land is found in the valleys of the Saône and Rhone, but for the most part the soil is stony and only&nbsp;moderately fertile. Wheat, oats, rye and potatoes are extensively cultivated, but their importance is less than that of&nbsp;the vine, the hills of the Beaujolais on the right bank of the&nbsp;Saône producing excellent wines. Fruit trees, such as peaches,&nbsp;apricots, walnuts and chestnuts, grow well, but the wood in&nbsp;general is little more than copse and brushwood. Good&nbsp;pasture is found in the valleys of the Azergues and its affluents.&nbsp;Mines of iron-pyrites and coal and quarries of freestone are&nbsp;worked. The production of silk fabrics, the chief branch of&nbsp;manufacture, that of chemicals and machinery, together with&nbsp;most of the Otherindustriesof the department, are concentrated&nbsp;in Lyons </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> and its vicinity. Tarate is a centre for the&nbsp;manufacture of muslin and embroidery. · Oullins has large&nbsp;railway workshops belonging to the Paris-Lyon-Méditerranée&nbsp;railway, and there are important glass works at Givors. Cottonspinning and weaving are carried on in several localities. The&nbsp;products of its manufactures, together with wine and brandy,&nbsp;form the bulk of the exports of the department; its imports&nbsp;comprise chiefly the raw material for its industries. It is&nbsp;served by the Paris-Lyon railway. The Rhone and the Saône&nbsp;and in the extreme south the canal of Givors are its navigable&nbsp;waterways. Lyons the capital is the seat of an archbishop&nbsp;and of a court of appeal and centre of an educational division&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(académie).</span><span class="font2"> The department is divided amongst the districts&nbsp;of the VII., VIII., XII., XIII. and XIV. army corps. There&nbsp;are two arrondissements (Lyons and Villefranche) subdivided&nbsp;into 29 cantons and 269 communes. The principal places&nbsp;besides Lyons are Givors, Tarare and Villefranche, which&nbsp;receive separate treatment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RHÖNGEBIRGE, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Die Rhön,</span><span class="font2"> a mountain-chain of central Germany, running in a north-westerly direction from the&nbsp;Bavarian province of Lower Franconia to the Prussian province&nbsp;of Hesse-Nassau and the grand duchy of Saxe-Weimar, and&nbsp;divided by the Werra from the Thuringian Forest on the N.&nbsp;The other sides are bounded by the Fulda on the W. and the&nbsp;Sinn and Frankish Saab on the E. and </span><span class="font0">S. </span><span class="font2">Its length is 50 m.,&nbsp;breadth 5-7 m., and its mean elevation 1900 ft. This, district&nbsp;is divided into three groups—the southern, the high (Hohe)&nbsp;and the nearer (Vordere) Rhön. Of these the southern, a continuation of the Spessart, largely consists of flat conical masses&nbsp;and reaches its highest point in the Heiliger Kreuzberg (2900 ft.).&nbsp;The Hohe Rhön, beginning immediately to the north-west of&nbsp;the latter mountain, is a high plateau of red sandstone, covered&nbsp;with fens and basajt peaks. It is a wild, dreary, inclement&nbsp;tract of country, covered with snow for six months in the year&nbsp;and visited by frequent fogs and storms. It is said of it that&nbsp;whoever desires to experience a northern winter can spare&nbsp;himself a journey to the North Cape or Siberia, and find it in&nbsp;his native Rhön. There is little vegetation, and the inhabitants&nbsp;eke out a scanty sustenance from the cultivation of potatoes</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
