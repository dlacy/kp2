<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the times of writing than thoſe </span><span class="font4">of </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Rabelais appear above two centuries after. He died about 1553.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">RABBIT, in zoology. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lepus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The buck rabbits, like our boar cats, will ki∏ the young ones if they can get at them ; and the does in the&nbsp;warrens prevent this, by covering their ſtocks, or neſts,&nbsp;with gravel or earth, which they cloſe ſo artificially up&nbsp;with the hinder part of their bodies, that it is hard to&nbsp;find them out. They never ſuckle their young ones at&nbsp;any other time than early in the morning and late at&nbsp;night ; and always, for eight or ten days, clofe up the&nbsp;hole at the mouth of the neſt, in this careful manner&nbsp;when they go out. After this they begin to leave a&nbsp;ſmall opening, which they increaſe by degrees ; till at&nbsp;length, when they are about three weeks old, the mouth&nbsp;of the hole is left wholly open that they may go out ;&nbsp;for they are at that time grown big enough to take care&nbsp;of themſelves, and to feed on graſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">People who keep rabbits tame for profit, breed them in hutches; but theſe muſt be kept very neat and clean,&nbsp;clſe they will be always ſubject to difeaſes. Care muſt&nbsp;be taken alſo to keep the bucks and does apart till the&nbsp;∣atter have juſt kindled ; then they are to be turned to&nbsp;the bucks again, and to remain with them till they ſhun&nbsp;and run from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The general direction for the chooſing βf tame rabbits is, to pick the largeſt and faireſt ; but the breeder ihould remember that the ſkins of the ſilver-haired ones&nbsp;ſell better than any other. The food of the tame rabbits may be colewort and cabbage-leaves, carrots, parſ-r&lt;eps, apple-rinds, green corn, and vetches, in the time&nbsp;of the year; alſo vine-leaves, graſs, fruits, oats, and&nbsp;oatmeal, milk-thiſtles, ſow-thiſtles, and the like : but&nbsp;with theſe moiſt foods they muſt always have a pro-portionable quantity of the dry foods, as hay, bread,&nbsp;oats, bran, and the like, otherwiſe they will grow pot-bellied, and die. Bran and grains mixed together have&nbsp;been alſo found to be very good food. In winter they&nbsp;will eat hay, oats, and chaff, and theſe may be given&nbsp;them three times a-day ; but when they eat green&nbsp;things, it muſt be obſerved that they are not to drink&nbsp;at ail, for it would throw them into a dropſy. At all&nbsp;other times a very little drink ſerves their turn, but&nbsp;that muſt always be freſli. when any green herbs or&nbsp;.graſs are cut for their food, care muſt be taken that&nbsp;there be no hemlock among it; for though they will eat&nbsp;this greedily among other things when offered to them,&nbsp;yet it is fudden poiſon to them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rabbits are ſubject to two principal infirmities. Firſt, the rot, which is cauſed by giving them too&nbsp;large a quantity of greens, or from giving them freſli&nbsp;gathered with the dew or rain hanging in drops upon&nbsp;them. It is over-moiſture that always cauſes this diſeaſe. The greens therefore are always to be given dry;&nbsp;and a ſufficient quantity of hay, or other dry food, intermixed with them, to take up the abundant moiſture&nbsp;of their juices. Οη this account the very beſt food that&nbsp;can be given them, is the ſhorteſt and fweeteſt hay that&nbsp;can be got, of which one load will ferve 200 couples a&nbsp;year ; and out of this ſtock of 200, 200 may be eat in&nbsp;the family, 200 fold to the markets, and a ſufficient&nbsp;number kept in caſe of accidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The other general diſeaſe of theſe creatures </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is </span><span class="font3">a fort of madneſs : this may be known by their wallowing&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and tumbling about with their heels upwards, and hop</span><span class="font3">ping </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Hl an </span><span class="font3">odd manner into their boxes. This diſtem-per is ſuppofod to be owing to the rankneſs of their&nbsp;feeding; and the general cure is the keeping them low,&nbsp;and giving them the prickly herb called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tare-th'file</span><span class="font3"> to.&nbsp;eat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The general, computation of ma!es and females is, that one buck-rabbit will ſerve for nine does : ſome al-low 10 to one buck £ but thoſe who go beyond this,&nbsp;always ſuffer ſor it in their breed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The wild rabbits are either to be taken by ſmall cur-dogs, or by ſpaniels bred up to the ſport ; and the places of hunting thoſe who ſtraggle horn their burrows,&nbsp;is under cloſe hedges or buſhes, or among corn-fields&nbsp;and freſh paſtures. The owners uſe to courſe then»&nbsp;with ſmall greyhounds ; and though they are ſeldctn&nbsp;killed this way, yet they are driven back to their bur-rows, and are prevented from being a prey to others.&nbsp;The common method is by nets called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">purfi-nets,</span><span class="font3"> and&nbsp;ferrets. The ferret is ſent into the hole to fetch them&nbsp;out; and the purſe-net being ſpread over the hole, takes&nbsp;them as they come out. The ferrets mouths muſt be&nbsp;muffled, and then the rabbit gets no harm. For the&nbsp;more certain taking of them, it may not be improper to&nbsp;pitch up </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">hay-net or two, at a fmall diſtance from the&nbsp;burrows that are intended to be hunted: thus very few&nbsp;of the number that are attempted will eſcape.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some who have not ferrets ſmoke the rabhits out of their holes with burning brimſtone and orpiment. This&nbsp;certainly brings them out into the nets : but. then it is&nbsp;a very troubleſome and offenſive method ; and is very&nbsp;detrimental to the place, as. no rabbit will for a long&nbsp;time, afterwards come near the burrows which have&nbsp;been fumed with thoſe ſtinking ingredients.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">I he teſticle of a rabbit is a very good object for examining the ſtructure of this part of generation in animals. lhe whole ſubſtance ot the teſticle in this ani-. mal is made up of veffels, which lie in round folds in&nbsp;the manner ot the ſmaller inteſtines: but then both ends,&nbsp;of each roll meet at their inſertion, which ſeems to be&nbsp;made into the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ductus nervoſus ;</span><span class="font3"> and every one of theſe&nbsp;little rolls is curiouſly embroidered with other veſſels,&nbsp;which, from their red colour, appear to be arteries and&nbsp;veins. The ſeveral little rolls lie in ranges, diſpoſed&nbsp;with an uniformity which is very agreeable to the eye.&nbsp;Every one of theſe rolls is not a ſingle and entire tube,&nbsp;but each conſiſts of ſeveral tubes, beſide the veins and&nbsp;arteries which embroider it. This is beſt diſtinguiſhed&nbsp;by the cutting one of the rolls tranfverſely, and then&nbsp;examining the cut end with a glaſs, which will appear&nbsp;to be made up of the cut and open ends of four, five, or&nbsp;more parallel tubes, which together form the roll, or&nbsp;ſingle tube, as it appears to the eye, being all wrapped,&nbsp;up in one common and very thin membrane. Theſe&nbsp;are fo tender that they cannot be explicated and viewed&nbsp;diſtinct, as De Graaf tells us thoſe of the teſticles of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">rat and of fome other animals may. Tlieſe, however,&nbsp;as well as the others, are only made up of a congeries,&nbsp;of veſſels, and the liquors, which are their contents,&nbsp;without any intermediate ſubſtance, or any thing of that&nbsp;parenchyma which many authors have talked of. The&nbsp;teſticles of a bull have the greatest appearance of a fleſhy&nbsp;texture of thoſe of any known animal ; yet even thefσ&nbsp;afford no particle of parenchyma, or fleſh, when examined by glaſſes in any fort of preparation, whether boil-</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ed, </span><span class="font3">law, foaked in ſpirits} or in whatever other ſtate.</span></p>
