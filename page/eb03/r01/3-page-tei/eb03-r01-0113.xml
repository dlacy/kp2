Theſe letters are grantable by the law of nations, whenever the ſubjects of one ſtate are oppreffed and injured by thoſe of another; and juſtice is denied by that ſtate to which the oppreſlbr belongs. In this caſe letters of marque and repriſal words uſed as ſynonymous ; and ſignify-ing, the latter a taking in return, the former the paſſing the frontiers in order to ſuch taking) may be obtained, in order to ſeize the bodies or goods of the ſubjects of the offending ſtate, until fatisfaction be made, where-ever they happen to be found. And indeed this cuſtom of reprifals ſeems dictated by nature herfelf; for which reaſon we ſind in the moſt ancient times very notable inftances of it. But here the neceſſity is obvious of calling in the fovereign power, to determine when reprifals may be made ; elſe every private ſufferer would be a judge in his own cauſe. In purſuance of which principle, it is with us declared by the ſtat. 4 Hen. V. c. 7. that, if any ſubjects of the realm are oppreffed in time of truce by any foreigners, the king will grant marque in due form, to all that feel themſelves grieved, which form is thus directed to be obſerved : the ſuf-ferer muſt firſt apply to the lord privy-feal, and he ſhall make out letters of requeſt under the privy, ſeal; and if after ſuch requeſt of fatisfaction made, the paaty required -do not within convenient time make due fatisfaction or reſtitution to the party grieved, the lord-chancellor ſhall make him out letters of marque under the great ſeal ; and by virtue of theſe he may attack and ſeize the property of the aggreffor nation, without hazard of being condemned as a robber or pirate.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Reprisal, or </hi><hi rend="italic">Recaption,</hi>  is a ſpecies of remedy al-Iowed to an injured perſon. This happens when any one hath deprived another of his property in goods or chattels perfonal, or wrongfully detains one’s wife, child, or ſervant : in which caſe the owner of the goods, and the huſhand, parent, or maſter, may lawfully claim and ■retake them, wherever he happens to find them ; ſo it be not in a riotous manner, or attended with a breach ol the peace. The reaſon for this is obvious ; ſince it may frequently happen that the owner may have this ©nly opportunity of doing himſelf juſtic? : his goods may be afterwards conveyed away or deſtroyed ; and his wife, children, or ſervants, concealed or carried out of his reach ; if he had no ſpeedier remedy than the ordinary proceſs of law. If therefore he can ſo contrive it as to gain poffeſſion of his property again, without force or terror, the law favours and will juſtify his proceeding. But, as the public peace is a ſuperior conſideration to any one man’s private property ; and as, if individuals were once allowed to uſe private force as a remedy for private injuries, all ſocial juſtice -muſt ceaſe, the ſtrong would give law to the weak, and every man would revert to a ſtate of nature ; for theſe reafons it is provided, that this natural right of recaption ſhall never be exerted, where ſueh exertion ■muſt occaſion ſtrife and bodily contention, or endanger</p><lb/><p>the peace oſ fociety. If, for inſtance, my horſe is ta-ken away, and I ſind him in a common, a fair, or a public inn, I may lawfully ſeize him to my own uſe : but I cannot juſtify breaking open a private ſtable, or entering on the grounds of a third perſon, to take him, except he be feloniouſiy ſtolen ; but muſt have recourſe to an action at law.</p><p>REPROBATION, in theology, means the act of abandoning, or ſtate of being abandoned, to eternal de-ſtruction, and is applied to that decree or reſolve which God has taken from all eternity to puniſh ſinners who ſhall die in impenitence ; in which ſenſe it is directly op-poſed to election. When a ſinner is ſo hardened as to feel no remorſe or miſgiving of conſcience, it is conſidered as a ſign of reprobation ; which by the caſuiſts has been diſtinguiſhed into pofitive and negative. The ſirſt is that whereby God is ſuppoſed to create men with a pofitive and abſolute refolution to damn them eternally. This opinion is countenanced by St Auguſ-tſhe and other Chriſtian fathers, and is a peculiar tenet of Calvin and moſt of his followers. The church of England, in <hi rend="italic">The thirty-nine Articles,</hi>  teaches fomething like it ; and the church of Scotland, in the <hi rend="italic">Confejfion of Faith,</hi>  maintains it in the ſtrongeſt terms. But the notion is generally exploded, and is believed by no rational divine in either church, being totally injurious to the juſtice of the Deity. Negative or conditional reprobation is that whereby God, though he has a ſincere deſire to ſave men, and furniſhes them with the neceffary means, fo that all if they will may be ſaved, yet fees that there are many who will not be ſaved by the means, however powerful, that are afforded them; tho* by other means which the Deity fees, but will not afford them, they might be ſaved. Reprobation reſpects angels as well as men, and reſpects the latter either fallen or unfallen. See Predestination.</p><p>REPRODUCTION, is uſually underſtood to mean the re il oration of a thing before exiſting, and ſince deſtroyed. It is very well known that trees and plants may be raiſed from Hips and cuttings ; and fome late obſervations have ſhown, that there are foιne animals which have the fame property. The polype * was the ſirſt inſtance we had ot this ; but we had ſcarce time to wonder at the diſcovery Mr Trembley had made, when Mr Bonett diſcovered the ſame property in a ſpecies of water-worm. Amongſt the plants which may be raiſed from cuttings, there are ſome which ſeem to pυffei's this quality in ſo eminent a degree, that the ſmal-leſt portion of them will become a complete tree again.</p><p>It deſerves inquiry, whether or not the great Author of nature, when he ordained that certain infects, as theie polypes and worms, ſhould reſemble thoſe plants in that particular, allovzed them this power of being re-produced in the ſame degree ? or, which is the Tame thing, whether this reproduction will or will not take place in whatever part the worm is cut? fn order to try this, Mr Bonett entered on a courfe of many experiments on the water-worms which have this property. Theſe are, at their common growth, from two to three inches long, and of a browniſh colour, with a caſt oſ reddiſh. From one of theſe worms he cut off the head and tail, taking from each extremity only a ſmall piece of a twelfth of an inch in length ; but neither of theſe pieces were able to reproduce what was wanting. They both periſhed in about 24 hours ; the tail firſt,</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
