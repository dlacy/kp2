the operation of trying the depth of the ſea, and the nature of the bottom, by means of a plummet ſunk from a ſhip to the bottom.</p><p>There are two plummets uſed for this purpoſe in navigation ; one of which is called the <hi rend="italic">hand-lead,</hi> weighing about 8 or 9 pounds ; and the other the <hi rend="italic">deep ſea- lead,</hi> which weighs from 25 to 30 pounds ; and both are ſhaped like the frustum of a cone or pyramid. The former is uſed in ſhallow waters, and the latter at a great diſtance from the ſhore ; particularly on approaching the land after a ſea-voyage. Accordingly the lines employed for this purpoſe are called the <hi rend="italic">deep-ſea leadline,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">hand lead-line.</hi></p><p>The hand lead-line, which is uſually 20 fathoms in length, is marked at every two or three fathoms ; ſo that the depth of the water may be aſcertained either in the day or night. At the depth of two and three fathoms, there are marks of black leather ; at 5 fathoms, there is a white rag ; at 7, a red rag ; at 10, black leather; at 13, black leather ; at 15, a white rag; and at 17, a red ditto.</p><p>Sounding with the hand lead, which is called <hi rend="italic">heaving the lead</hi> by ſeamen, is generally performed by a man who stands in the main chains to windward. Having the line quite ready to run out without interruption, he holds it nearly at the diſtance of a fathom from the plummet; and having ſwung the latter backwards and forwards three or four times, in order to acquire the greater velocity, he ſwings it round his head, and thence as far forward as is neceſſary ; ſo that, by the lead’s linking whilſt the ſhip advances, the line may be almoſt perpendicular when it reaches the bottom. The perſon founding then proclaims the depth of the water m a kind of ſong reſembling the cries of hawkers in a city. Thus if the mark of five fathoms is cloſe to the surface of the water, he calls, ‘ By the mark five !’ and as there is no mark at four, fix, eight, &amp; c. he eſtimates thoſe numbers, and calls, ‘ By the dip four,’ &amp; c. If he judges it to be a quarter or an half more than any particular number, he calls, ‘And a quarter five! and a half four,’ &amp; c.. If he conceives the depth to be three quarters more than a particular number, he calls it a quarter leſs than the next : thus, at four fathoms and three fourths he calls ‘ A quarter leſs five !’ and so on.</p><p>The deep ſea-lead is marked with two knots at 20 fathoms, three at 30, four at 40, and ſo on to the end. It is alſo marked with a ſingle knot in the middle of each interval, as at 25, 35, 45 fathoms, &amp; c. To uſe this lead more effectually at ſea, or in deep, water on the ſea-coaſt, it is uſual previouſly to bring to the ſhip, in order to retard her courſe : the lead is then thrown as far as poſſible from the ſhip on the line of her drift, ſo that, as it sinks, the ſhip drives more perpendicularly over it. The pilot, feeling the lead ſtrike the bottom, readily diſcovers the depth of the water by the mark on the line neareſt its ſurface. The bottom of the lead being alſo well rubbed over with tallow, retains the diſtinguiſhing marks of the bottom, as ſhells, ooze, gravel, &amp; c. which naturally adhere to it.</p><p>The depth of the water, and the nature of the ground, which is called the <hi rend="italic">foundings,</hi> are carefully marked in the log-book, as well to determine the diſtance of the place</p><p>from the ſhore, as to correct the observations of former pilots.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
