<p><span class="font0">especially on the western coast and in Lewis ; but the price is now so low and fluctuating, and the time and trouble bestowed in making it so great, that it is believed the sea-weed&nbsp;employed would be much more profitably used as manure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The burghs of Cromarty, Dingwall, and Tain, along with Dornoch, Wick, and Kirkwall, return a member to parliament. Fortrose and Rosemarkie, two small adjacent towns&nbsp;included in one burgh, return a member along with Inverness, Nairn, and Forres, Besides these burghs, the united&nbsp;county has several villages or small towns in it, such as&nbsp;Contin, Shildag, Domie, Plocktown, and Ullapool, which&nbsp;last has 500 or 600 inhabitants. Stornoway, in Lewis, is&nbsp;a thriving burgh of barony, with some good streets of&nbsp;houses, and a considerable quantity of shipping, and, with&nbsp;its suburbs and environs, it contains nearly 3000 inhabitants. Sheriff and commissary courts, bailie, excise, and&nbsp;justice of peace courts, are regularly held in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Ross and Cromarty there are many ancient and curious remains. In the parish of Nigg, the site of the castle of Dunskeath, built by William the Lion in the year 1174,&nbsp;is still to be distinguished. At Shandwick is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clach-a-Charridh,</span><span class="font0"> or the Stone of the Burial-place. On one side of it&nbsp;a large cross is still to be traced, wrought with an intricate&nbsp;maze of runic knotting. On the sides of the shaft are&nbsp;two animals resembling an elephant and a lion, above each&nbsp;of which there is a figure that appears to lean forward from&nbsp;a cross. On the reverse side of the obelisk there are processions, hunting scenes, and combats. The ground surrounding the spot where it stands was for centuries used as&nbsp;a place of interment. There is a similar though smaller&nbsp;stone in the church-yard of Nigg. It originally stood near&nbsp;the gate, but it was thrown down by the fall of a belfrey&nbsp;in 1725, and it is now fixed to the eastern gable. The top&nbsp;is of a triangular shape, and it has on one side of it two&nbsp;priest-like figures attired in long garments, each furnished&nbsp;with a book, and inclining forward as if intent on reading&nbsp;and devotion. Between them is a small circular table or&nbsp;altar ; and a dove seems to descend from above with a circular cake in its bill. Under the table there are two large&nbsp;dogs. Lower down on the stone there is a cross, and the&nbsp;spaces above and below the arms of it are divided into&nbsp;rectangular compartments of mathematical exactness. The&nbsp;hieroglyphics of the opposite side are in lower relief ; and&nbsp;in the centre appears the chief figure, that of a man attired&nbsp;in long garments, caressing a fawn, with a lamb and harp&nbsp;directly fronting him. In the space beneath there is a man&nbsp;clashing a pair of cymbals, and a man on horseback surrounded by animals of the chase ; while on the upper part&nbsp;of the stone there are dogs, deer, and armed huntsmen, with&nbsp;an eagle or raven surmounting the whole. These obelisks&nbsp;or crosses are supposed to be of Scandinavian origin. Craig-chenichan, or the Rock of Lamentation, in the parish of&nbsp;Kincardine, is memorable for being the place where the&nbsp;Marquis of Montrose was defeated by Colonel Strachan,&nbsp;after which he swam across the Kyle, and lay concealed in&nbsp;Assint, until apprehended and sent prisoner to Inverness.&nbsp;On the summit of Ormondy Hill, 200 feet above the level of&nbsp;the sea, near Castletown Point, in the parish of Avoch, are&nbsp;the foundations of a large and very ancient castle, to which&nbsp;tradition has given the name of Douglas. On a large plain&nbsp;to the westward of the church of Eddertown there are indications of an encampment, where a battle is said to have&nbsp;been fought with the Danes. In its vicinity there is an extensive circle of earth, about two feet higher than the circumjacent ground, flat on the top, with an obelisk in the&nbsp;centre ten feet in height, on which a number of rude figures&nbsp;may still be traced. This is regarded as the tomb of some&nbsp;Danish prince. The abbey and castle of Lochlin, in the&nbsp;parish of Fearn, are remarkable. The former measured&nbsp;ninety-nine by twenty-five feet within the walls. It was&nbsp;used for divine service till October 1742, when the roof fell&nbsp;in and killed thirty-six people. The castle of Lochlin is&nbsp;supposed to be more than five centuries old. It stands on&nbsp;an eminence about six miles to the eastward of Tain. Its&nbsp;plan is that of two squares united at the angles, in which&nbsp;there is a staircase leading to the top of it, which is sixty&nbsp;feet high. The castle of Cadboll, of which little remains,&nbsp;is supposed to be yet more ancient than that of Lochlin.&nbsp;There is a tradition that no one ever died in it ; and that&nbsp;about a century and a half ago, a certain Lady May, whose&nbsp;lingering diseases made her long for death, was removed&nbsp;from it at her own request that she might die, and her wish&nbsp;is said to have been gratified immediately after her removal.&nbsp;In the parish of Kirkmichael, and close on the edge of a&nbsp;precipice rising from the shore of Cromarty Frith, is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tigh-na-Craig,</span><span class="font0"> or the House of the Rock. It is a very curious&nbsp;old building, fifty feet in height, of great antiquity, having&nbsp;been erected by the Urquharts, barons of Cromarty. In&nbsp;Loch Carron are the ruins of Strome Castle ; and at Lan-ganduin there is one of those buildings called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Duin,</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;are so frequent on the west coast. The castle of Eilean&nbsp;Donnan, on an insulated point between Lochs Ling and&nbsp;Duich, in Kintail, though greatly dilapidated, is still a fine&nbsp;picturesque ruin. It is supposed to have been built in the&nbsp;time of Alexander the Third. It was long the baronial&nbsp;strength of the lords of Kintail ; but after the battle of Glen-sheil in 1719, it was demolished by a ship of war. Some of&nbsp;the cannon-balls fired against it have been found nearly a&nbsp;mile above the castle. Near Ob-Inag, in the parish of&nbsp;Glensheil, is to be found a fine specimen of what has been&nbsp;called the Pictish Tower. At Dingwall are the remains of&nbsp;the ancient castle of the earls of Ross. The hill of Knock-farril, in the parish of Fodderty, is crowned with one of those&nbsp;curious and puzzling morsels of antiquity, usually known by&nbsp;the name of vitrified forts. The walls enclose nearly an&nbsp;acre of level ground, from which Craig Phadric near Inverness, and Dunskaith on the northern Sutor of Cromarty,&nbsp;are distinctly visible, and so it is connected with a chain of&nbsp;these signal-posts. It is probable that the early inhabitants&nbsp;of the country burned their beltane fires on these signal-hills ; and these we know were so immense that they might&nbsp;very well account for the vitrification of the circular walls&nbsp;of dry stone which were erected to prevent the fuel from&nbsp;being blown about and dispersed. There are many ancient&nbsp;single stones, and circles of stones, and cairns, in different&nbsp;parts of Ross and Cromarty. In Lewis are to be found the&nbsp;following ruins of religious houses: St Collums in Ui, St&nbsp;Cowstans in Garrabost, and St Aula in Gress. On the Flannel Isles, called by Buchanan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Insulœ Sacrœ,</span><span class="font0"> the ruins of&nbsp;religious houses are still extant. At Mealister and Pabay&nbsp;are the remains of nunneries ; and there is a similar ruin on&nbsp;the island of St Colme, in the entrance to Loch Erisort. At&nbsp;Carloway there is a fine specimen of those towers already&nbsp;mentioned, perfectly circular, and thirty feet high ; and&nbsp;there are three or four more in Barras parish. In the year&nbsp;1831, a considerable number of little figures, carved in&nbsp;ivory, were found in the sands at the head of the Bay of&nbsp;Uig. We saw them in Edinburgh, and they appeared to&nbsp;us very much to resemble the kings and pieces at chess.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are many curious caves both on the east and west coasts of Ross and Cromarty; but the most remarkable is the&nbsp;Seal Cave, in the parish of Stornoway, in Lewis, which is considered to be only secondary in grandeur, and in the splendour of its stalactitic formations, to the famous cave in Skye.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principal clans in Ross and Cromarty are the Mackenzies, Rosses, Frasers, Mackays, Macraes, and Munroes. Gaelic is universally spoken, though it is less used on the&nbsp;eastern than on the western side of the county. In Lewis&nbsp;it is the chief language. The Highland dress is now seldom&nbsp;worn, except on occasions of ceremony or festivity.</span></p>
