<p><span class="font0">Patos. The city was occupied by the national forces in the ten years’ war which began in 1835, and in 1894 it was unsuccessfully besieged by a small insurgent force that had attempted to&nbsp;overthrow the government at Rio de Janeiro.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIOJA, LA, an Andine province of Argentina, bounded N. by Catamarca, E. by Catamarca and Cordoba, S. by San Luis and&nbsp;San Juan and W. by San Juan and Chile. Area, 34,540 sq. m.&nbsp;Pop. (1895) 69,502; (1902, estimate) 82,099. The province is&nbsp;traversed from N. to S. by eastern ranges of the Andes and is&nbsp;separated from Chile by the Cordillera itself. The western part&nbsp;of the province is drained by the Bermejo, which flows southward into the closed lacustrine basin of Mendoza. The eastern&nbsp;side of the province is arid, but in the extreme N. some small&nbsp;streams flow northward into Catamarca. The scanty waters&nbsp;of these streams are used for irrigation purposes. The principal&nbsp;industry of the province is that of mining, its mineral resources&nbsp;including gold, silver, copper, nickel, tin, cobalt, coal, alum and&nbsp;salt. Its best known mines are those of the Sierra de Famatina,&nbsp;16,400 ft. above sea-level, where an aerial wire line is used for&nbsp;transportation to Chilecito in the valley below. The development of mining industries is seriously hindered by lack of water.&nbsp;For the same reason, agriculture is in a very backward condition.&nbsp;The climate is hot and dry, and there is no cultivation of the soil&nbsp;except in the valleys of the Cordillera and a few other places&nbsp;where irrigation is possible. Under these conditions, there are&nbsp;grown wheat (a limited extent), grapes, oranges, olives and&nbsp;tobacco. Alfalfa is grown to a considerable extent and is used for&nbsp;feeding the herds of cattle driven across country to Chile. The&nbsp;capital of the province is La Rioja (pop., 1904, about 6000), on the&nbsp;eastern flank of the Sierra de Velasco, about 1770 ft. above sea-level and near the gorge of Sanagasta, through which a small&nbsp;stream, also called Rioja, flows northward and affords water for&nbsp;the gardens, vineyards and orchards that surround it. The&nbsp;wines of Rioja are highly esteemed and are an important source&nbsp;of income for the district. The town is connected by rail with&nbsp;Cordoba and Catamarca. It was founded in 1591 by Velasco&nbsp;and in 1894 was destroyed by an earthquake from which it has&nbsp;only partially recovered. The most important town in the&nbsp;province is the mining centre of Chilecito, or Villa Argentina&nbsp;(pop., 1904, about 4000), about 2950 ft. above sea-level near the&nbsp;Famatina mines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIOM, a town of central France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Puy-de-Dôme, 8 m. N. by E. of Clermont-Ferrand by rail. Pop., town, 7839; commune, 10,627. Riom is&nbsp;situated on the left bank of the Ambène, on an eminence rising&nbsp;above the fertile plain of Limagne. It is surrounded with boulevards and has wide streets, but the houses, being built of black&nbsp;lava, have a sombre appearance. Some belong to the 15th and&nbsp;16th centuries, and have turrets and carved stonework. The&nbsp;church of St Amable, of Romanesque and early Gothic architecture, dates from the 12th century, but has been restored&nbsp;in modern times. It has fine carved woodwork of the&nbsp;17th century. The church of Notre-Dame du Marthuret (15th&nbsp;century) has a well-known statue of the Virgin at its western&nbsp;entrance. The Sainte-Chapelle of the 14th and 15th centuries&nbsp;is a relic of the palace of Jean de Berry, duke of Auvergne, and&nbsp;contains fine stained glass. Near it stands a statue of the&nbsp;chancellor Michel de l’Hôpital, who was born near Riom. The&nbsp;rest of the site of the palace is occupied by the law courts.&nbsp;Other interesting buildings are the belfry of the 16th century&nbsp;and a mansion of the same period known as the Maison des&nbsp;Consuls. The town possesses numerous fountains, some of which&nbsp;are of the Renaissance period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Riom is the seat of a court of appeal, a court of assizes and a sub-prefect, and has tribunals of first instance and commerce&nbsp;and a communal college. It has a state manufactory of tobacco,&nbsp;and carries on the preparation of fruit preserves. Trade is in&nbsp;grain, wine, vegetables, fruit, nut-oil and Volvic stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Riom </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ricomagus</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ricomum</span><span class="font0"> of the Romans) was long the rival of Clermont. Along with Auvergne it was seized for the&nbsp;crown by Philip Augustus, and it was the capital of this province&nbsp;under the dukes of Berry and Bourbon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIO NEGRO, a territory of Argentina lying between the Colorado river and the 42nd parallel S. Iat., within the geographical&nbsp;area formerly known as Patagonia, bounded N. by the territories&nbsp;of Neuquen and La Pampa, E. by the province of Buenos Aires&nbsp;and the Atlantic, S by the territory of Chubut and W. by Chile&nbsp;and Neuqucn. Area, about 75,924 sq. m.; pop. (1895) 9241;&nbsp;(1904, estimate) 18,648. That part of it lying between the&nbsp;Colorado and Negro rivers has much of the formation and&nbsp;characteristics of the “ sterile pampas,” but with irrigation the&nbsp;greater part of it can be utilized for agriculture and grazing.&nbsp;South of the Negro the country is arid, barren and lies in great&nbsp;shingle-covered terraces sloping eastward to the Atlantic; its&nbsp;larger part is practically uninhabitable, only the river valleys&nbsp;and the foot-hills of the Andes having a regular water supply.&nbsp;The rivers of the territory are the Colorado, which forms a part&nbsp;of its northern boundary, and the Negro, formed by the confluence of the Limay (which forms part of the western boundary)&nbsp;and Neuqucn on the boundary between Rio Negro territory and&nbsp;the territory of Neuquen. These rivers have no tributaries of importance Avithin the territory, but the Limay receives some small&nbsp;streams from the Andean slopes. Lake Nahuel-Huapi lies partly&nbsp;in this territory (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Neuquen),</span><span class="font0"> and there are several small lakes&nbsp;scattered over the shingly steppes. The Atlantic coast-line&nbsp;of the territory has one deep indentation—the Gulf of San&nbsp;Matias—but, owing to the arid surroundings, there are no ports&nbsp;or towns upon it. The only industry of importance is grazing,&nbsp;cattle being raised for export to Chile, and a few sheep for their&nbsp;wool. The capital is Viedma (pop. in 1895, estimate, 1500), on&nbsp;the right bank of the Rio Negro, 22 m. from its mouth and&nbsp;opposite Carmen de Patagones, a town and port of Buenos Aires.&nbsp;There are other small settlements on the Rio Negro, which is&nbsp;navigable up to the Neuquen frontier (about 450 m.), but the&nbsp;only place of importance is General Roca (about 2300), a military&nbsp;and supply station situated a few miles below the confluence of&nbsp;the Limay and Neuquen rivers and connected with Bahia Blanca&nbsp;and Buenos Aires by a branch of the Great Southern railway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIO PARDO (formerly Villa do Rio Pardo), a town of Brazil in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, on the left bank of the Jacuhy&nbsp;at its confluence with the Pardo. Area (of the municipality)&nbsp;1737 sq. m. Pop. (1890) of the municipality, 19,346; (1908,&nbsp;estimated) of the town, 3500. The town is about 80 m. due&nbsp;west of Porto Alegre, with which it is· connected by rail and&nbsp;steamer. The Jacuhy is navigable by small steamers to this&nbsp;place, which was once an important military station and&nbsp;commercial centre. Its military importance has considerably&nbsp;declined through railway extension. The surrounding districts&nbsp;are fertile but only slightly cultivated, and stock-raising is its&nbsp;chief industry. The town had its origin in a frontier fort built&nbsp;at this point by the Portuguese in 1751, but did not reach the&nbsp;dignity of a “ villa ” until 1809.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIOT (O. Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">riote,</span><span class="font0"> of uncertain etymology), the gTavest kind of breach of the peace, short of treason, known to the&nbsp;English law. It consists in a tumultuous disturbance of the&nbsp;peace by an assemblage of three or more persons who, with&nbsp;intent to help one another against any one who opposes them&nbsp;in the execution of some enterprise, actually execute that&nbsp;enterprise in a violent and turbulent manner, to the terror of&nbsp;the people. It is not necessary that violence should be used&nbsp;to any person or damage done to any property. Whether&nbsp;the enterprise itself is lawful or unlawful is not material, the&nbsp;gist of the offence lying in the mode in which the enterprise&nbsp;is carried out </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(The Trafalgar Square Riots,</span><span class="font0"> 1888, 16 Cox.

An assembly in its inception&nbsp;perfectly lawful may become a riot if the persons assembled&nbsp;proceed to form and execute a common purpose in the manner&nbsp;above stated, although they had no such purpose when they&nbsp;first assembled.
