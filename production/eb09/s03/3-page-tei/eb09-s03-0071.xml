Ili» ρo∣-m ∣∙ntitb(I <hi rend="italic">Italy</hi> is remarkable for the warm affection it express«« for the country of his education. Peter Hektorevhι (1486- 15/2) was a rich proprietor of the island of Zara, and is worth mentioning as having shown a taste <hi rend="italic">for</hi> the national poetry of his country. I,c haa introduced some songs in his <hi rend="italic">Ribanje i Ribarako l</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">,</hi><hi rend="italic">∣ ig∣∣∣∙∣∣ra∣∣je</hi> (Fishing und a Dialogue of Fishermen). „Very celebrated in Its time was the <hi rend="italic">Jtyjopka</hi> or Gipsy of Andrew Cubranovi&lt;5 ( I f∣OO-15frV), who was originally a' silversmith. His τ*oem of the <hi rend="italic superscript">,</hi><hi rend="italic">jιpay</hi> is said to have been evoked in the following manner. Cubrαnoviri was on on« occasion following a young lαdv and urging Ids suit when she turned round and said scornfully in Italian to her attendant, in the hearing of the poet, “ Che vuolo da me questo Ziugaι<hi rend="superscript">ι</hi>o <hi rend="italic">'I ”</hi> (“What docs this Gipsy want with me ?*’). The despised lover took up the word of reproach and wrote a poem in whicn ho Introduced a Gipsy prophesying to a company of ladies their various fortunes and concluding with un expostulation to the hard-hearted beauty for her obduracy. Hchαfarik speaks of this piece with great eulhuMiasm and calls it <hi rend="superscript">u</hi>a truly splendid flower in the garden of the Illyrian Muses.’’ The Russian critic Plρin supposes, with great probability, that the poem was written us u sort of nιasι∣ucrade for</p><p>I	lie carnival. 11, enjoyed considerable popularity and was frequently imitated. A similar story is sui&lt;l to have suggested the <hi rend="italic">Berviac </hi>(Dervish) ol'S,jepo Guèetié, in which the author represents himself as a Turkish dervish. These two pieces are elegant productions in th∣&lt; Italian manm∣r.</p><p>Nicholas Naljeskoviιi (1510-1587) was a native of Ragusa and author of several pastoral plays in the style then so much in vogue throughout Europe. Of the same description are the productions of Murino DrKiι∣ (15*20-1580), of whom his contemporaries praised "II puro, vago, υ doleo canto." Mention may also bo mado of l&gt;iιιko Ranjina and Mauro Orbini (d. 1014). Another celebrated po∣∣t, was Domiuoo Zlatαriι5 (155Ö-1G07), who, besides translating the <hi rend="italic">Klrctra</hi> of Sophocles, produced a version of the <hi rend="italic">Aminta</hi> of Tasso and has left several minor pieces. Tho chief of the Rngusnn poets, however, was Ivan Gumlιιlh<hi rend="superscript">l</hi> (sometimes called by his Italian name of Gondola). Very lew facts arc known of his life; but ho died in I (158 aged llfty, having discharged several important public offices.</p><p>II	is deal n, says Sebafaι ιk, was not too early for his fame but too early lor literature and the glory and prosperity of his country, lie himself published but little, ami many ot his writings perished in the earth∣∣uako in ltl(∣7, after which Rαgusa never regained her former prosperity. Tho so-called Petrarchan school of Illyrian poetry languished after this and wasted its energy on elegant trilles. Dalmatian poets of the 18th and 10th centuries have not made any considerable tigure. The <hi rend="italic">Osman</hi> of Gundulk<hi rend="superscript">t</hi>, on which bis fame rests, is an epic in twelve books, and was written to celebrate the victory of the Poles under Chodkiewiez over the Turks and Tatars in lll<hi rend="superscript">,</hi>2<hi rend="superscript">,</hi>2 at Chocim (lvhotiu). Schafarik praises Gundulic for the richness of his imagination, the lofty tone of his verse, and its perfectly constructed πιythm. λVe are willing to allow that ( <hi rend="superscript">l</hi>.&lt;ι∣ma p&lt;κssesses considerable spirit and that the versification is mebaliousj but on the whole it seems a tedious poem. The short ∣ιnatrains in which it is written lack the true epic dignity. Leaving the Dalmatians, the only writer worthy of mention among the Series is George Brankovich (1645-1711), the last despot, who compiled a ∕∕i.√eeg ς∕" 6Vm∣ι <hi rend="italic">till the out ∣f the 17th Century,</hi> w hich has l∣eeu relited bv Clnslomil Miyatovich, ambassador from the court of Servia to St .hunes<hi rend="superscript">,</hi>s (1S8(&gt;). Frem this period till the close of the ISth century there is no S∣ vviatι literature : the spirit of the people M'oms to have been crushed out of them by Austrian persecutors on the one hand and bv Turkish on the other. Till the reigu of λlilosh t&gt;brenovich in the 19th century haι∖lly a Servian printed book was to be seen. The works of Yun Kri.-hanich, who, although a Serb, wrote in Russian, are mentioned under Rvsstλ (∣∖ 105∖</p><p><hi rend="italic">Thi-A</hi> ∕Vπ'of ρύο!» f.'. (’&gt;, The sii&amp;rk of nationality was still burning among the Soil's, in spite ot their degradation, and men ware found to fan it. Such a man was Kaiclι (172Q-18O1), a thorough patriot. He was born in Slavonia, a province of Austria inhabited by Serbs, the son of poor parents, but he had all the ettthιisi.∣siιι for learning that animated the Russian Lomonosotf, whom he very much resembled. Thus we find him making his w,∖v on foot tλ∖wn his native town to Kietf, where he was received into the rxvlesiastieal seminarv and devoted himself to theology.
