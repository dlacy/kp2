The length of silken thread which may be unwound from a single cocoon, although it has been ridiculously exaggerated by Isnard and other writers, is in truth astonishing. Count Dandolo found it occasionally to exceed 600 yards ; Miss Rhodes of Yorkshire mentions that one of her largest cocoons yielded 404 measured yards ; and Pullein considers the average length to be about 300 yards. From data given by the first named author it was found, that to obtain one pound of reeled silk, twelve pounds of cocoons are required ; that 2800 worms would be necessary to produce that amount of cocoons ; and that to feed these caterpillars, 152 pounds of mulberry leaves must be collected.</p><p>As we write this brief notice rather for the amateur than the artizan, the mention of the above named tree reminds us of the propriety of stating, that as mulberry leaves cannot be easily obtained in Britain in required abundance, the best substitute is <hi rend="italic">lettuce.</hi></p><p>SILLA, a large town on the Niger, by which the travels of Mr. Park were bounded towards the east. He gives no particular description of the place, which his health and spirits permitted him not to survey, but assigns the reasons by which he was induced to proceed no farther. On his arrival, he was allowed to remain under a tree, till it was quite dark, surrounded by hundreds of people. But their language was extremely different from the other parts of Bambarra ; and he was given to understand, that in his progress eastward, the Bambarra tongue was very little understood, and that, on his reaching Jenné, he would find the greater part of the inhabitants accustomed to speak a different language. He had now become the prey of sickness, exhausted with hunger and fatigue, half naked, and without any article of value to procure for himself provisions, clothes, or lodging, on which account he resolved to return, finding that to prosecute his journey further in that direction was wholly impracticable. Siila, according to the latest map pf Africa, is in 14. 48. N. lat. and 1. 24. W. long.</p><p>SILVERING, the covering of any thing with silver. It is usual to silver metals, wood, paper, and the like, which is performed either with fire, oil, or size. Metal-gilders silver by the fire ; painter gilders all the other ways.</p><p><hi rend="italic">To silver copper or brass.</hi> First cleanse the metal with aquafortis, by washing it lightly, and immediately throwing it into pure water ; or by heating it red hot, and scouring it with salt and tartar, and some pure water, with a small wire brush. Secondly, Dissolve some silver in aquafortis, in a broad-bottomed glass vessel, or of glazed earth ; then evaporate away the aquafortis over a chaffing dish of coals. Thirdly, Put five or six times its quantity of water, or as much as will be necessary to dissolve it perfectly, on the remaining dry calx ; evaporate this water with the like heat; then put more fresh water, and evaporate again ; and, if need be, the third time, making the fire towards the latter end so strong as to leave the calx perfectly dry, which, if your silver is good, will be of a pure white. Fourthly, Take of this calx, common salt, crystals of tartar, of each a like quantity or bulk, and mixing well the whole composition, put the metal into pure water, and take of the said powder with your wet fingers, and rub it well on, till you find every little cavity of the metal sufficiently silvered over. Fifthly, If you would have it richly done, you must rub on more of the powder ; and, in the last place, wash the silvered metal in pure water, and rub it hard with a dry cloth.</p><p>SIMEON <hi rend="italic">of </hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Durham,</hi> the contemporary of William of Malmsbury. He took great pains in collecting the muniments of our history, especially in the north of England, after they had been scattered by the Danes. From these he composed a history of the kings of England, from A. D. 616 to 1130, with some smaller historical pieces. Simeon both studied and taught the sciences, and particularly the</p><p>mathematics, at Oxford ; and he became precentor of the church at Durham, where he died, probably soon after the conclusion of his history, which was continued by John, prior of Hexham, to the year 1156.</p><p>SIMFEROPOL, called formerly Akhmetschet; a city of the province of Tauria in Russia, the capital of that province as well as of a circle of the same name. It stands on an elevated plain, surrounded on all sides by mountains, on the banks of the river Salair. It is divided into the new and the old city ; the former is regularly laid out, and contains a public school, and a few offices of the government. The latter is surrounded with high walls, and has narrow and crooked streets without pavement, and is chiefly inhabited by the Tartars. The united towns contain about 1000 houses, and nearly 20,000 inhabitants, from a great variety of nations. It has a Russian, a Greek, and an Armenian church, and three Tartar mosques, with several baths. Lat. 44. 59. Long. 34.1. 5. E. It is 1458 miles from St. Petersburg. It is considered to be unhealthy in summer, owing to a deficiency of good water, and the filthy habits of the Tartar population.</p><p>SIMILE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Similtude,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric,</hi> a comparison of two things, which, though different in other respects, yet agree in some one. The difference between a simile and comparison consists in this, that the simile properly belongs to whatever we call the quality of a thing, and the comparison to the quantity.</p><p>SIMILOR, a name given to an alloy of red copper and zinc, made in the best proportions, to imitate silver and gold.</p><p>SIMOGA, a fortified town of the south of India, in the province of Mysore, and district of Bednorr, situated on the Zunga or Zoom river. The fortifications are not strong, and are incapable of resisting a regular attack. It has a manufacture of cotton cloth in the neighbourhood. It contains the temple and convent of Kudali Sivami, the high priest of a sect of Mahratta Brahmins. In 1790, an action was fought near this place, between Purseram Bhow and Mahommed Reza, in which the Mahrattas were assisted by a detachment of British troops under Captain Little, who gained the battle. At this time Simoga contained 6000 houses, which were utterly destroyed by the Mahrattas. It was again destroyed in 1798, but has since considerably recovered its wealth and population. Long. 75. 35. E. Lat. 13. 51 N.</p><p>SIMON <hi rend="smallcaps">Maccabeus,</hi> a celebrated leader, and high- priest of the Jews, who, after rendering the most important services to his country, was at last treacherously murdered by his son-in-law.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Simon</hi><hi rend="italic"> Magus,</hi> or the Sorcerer, was a native of Gitton, a village of Samaria. According to the usual practice of the Asiatics of that age, he visited Egypt, and there probably became aquainted with the sublime mysteries taught in the Alexandrian School, learning those theurgic or magical operations, by means of which it was believed that men might be delivered from the power of evil demons. Upon his return into his own country, the author of the <hi rend="italic">clementine Recognitions</hi> relates, that he imposed upon his countrymen by high pretensions to supernatural powers. St. Luke attests, that this artful fanatic had bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that he was some great one ; and that he obtained such general attention and reverence in Samaria, that the people all gave heed to him, from the least to the greatest, saying “ This man is the great power of God.”</p><p>By the preaching of Philip the Deacon, he was, with other Samaritans, converted to the Christian faith, and admitted into the infant church by the ordinance of baptism. His conversion, however, seems not to have been real ; for, upon seeing the miraculous effects of the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money, saying, “ Give me also</p></body></text></TEI>
