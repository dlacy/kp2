It is 120 feet in length and almost as many in breadth, built entirely of hewn stone. In this convent, the monks remain imprisoned by the wild Arabs of the surrounding country ; and they are supplied with provisions by a basket drawn up by a cord and pulley to the height of thirty feet. The predatory bands of Arabs often fire upon the convent from the rocks adjacent, and make prisoners of the monks who venture beyond the walls, for whose restoration they exact a considerable ransom. The con- vcnt has an excellent garden at a little distance, which is reached by a subterraneous passage secured with iron gates. It has a temperate climate, owing to the elevation, and snow sometimes falls. Fruits, plants, and vegetables, are produced in the utmost profusion. The convent is eighty feet long and fifty-three broad, paved with marble and adorned with a variety of figures. It has many lamps of gold and silver, and the grand altar is gilded and adorned with jewels. The ascent of the mountain is steep, and is by steps cut in the rock, or loose stones piled in succession. A Christian church and a Turkish mosque crowns the summit of Mount Sinai ; the former now greatly dilapidated. It commands a most extensive view over the Red Sea and the opposite coast of Thebais ; beneath is the port of Tor, by which the commodities of India were formerly conveyed to Egypt. The descent is even more rugged and steep than the ascent ; and terminates at the monastery of the Forty Saints, which has been plundered often by the Arabs. On the other side is the still loftier mountain of St. Catherine, 150 miles east of Suez.</p><p>SINCLAIR’S <hi rend="smallcaps">Rocks</hi>, four small rocks off the south coast of New Holland, included by Capt.

N.</p><p>SINDE, an extensive kingdom of Hindustan, which extends from the district of Shikarpoor on the frontier of Cabul, and the island of Bukkor in the Indus, along the level plain, watered by that river to the sea; in length about two hundred and fifty miles by eighty miles in average breadth. The general boundaries are the British principality of Cutch and the Indian ocean to the south ; the kingdom of Jessulmere and the Rejistah, or Sandy Desert, to the east, which extends from the territories of Cutch five hundred and fifty miles in length by a hundred and fifty in breadth ; the mountains of Belochistan on the west; and the provincesof Seewistan and Babawulpoor on the north. It is a flat alluvial country, situated between the 23d and 27th degrees of north latitude, and the 67th and 71 st degrees of cast longitude ; and is crossed in a diagonal direction by the Indus and its brandies, which form adclta, in length about a hundred miles along the coast. The lower part of this delta is intersected by numerous rivers and creeks, like the delta of the Ganges, but it has no trees on it, the dry parts being covered with brush-wood, and the remainder, by much the greater part, being noisome swamps, or muddy lakes. The streams which break off from the Indus, diverge in all directions into other streams, which interlock into each other, and chequer the whole country. To trace in detail those complicated branches into which the main stream is thus divided would be useless. All those various streams which overspread the country, greatly increase its fertility ; but often prove pernicious to those who dwell on the banks, by the exhalations which arise under a tropical sun, from the annual inundations. “ Few countries,” says Major Rennel, “ are more unwholesome to European constitutions, particularly the lower part of the delta.”</p><p>Sinde may be termed a level country, intersected with rocky hills. Those tracts which are within the limits of the inundation, rival in fertility the borders of the Nile- Even those parts which are at a distance from the river, are capable of being cultivated, provided there is no failure in the periodical rains. This, however, frequently happens, as no country in the world is more subject to drought. During great part of the south-west monsoon, or at least in the months of July, August, and part of September, which is the season of the periodical rains in most parts of India, the atmosphere is generally clouded, but no rain falls, except very near the sea. At Tatta, when it was visited by Captain Hamilton, no rain had fallen for three years. Owing to this, and to the vicinity of the sandy deserts, which bound this country on the east, and on the northwest, the heats are so violent, and the winds from these quarters so unwholesome, that the houses are contrived so as to be ventilated by means of apertures on the top of them, resembling the funnels of small chimneys. During the prevalence of the hot winds, the windows are shut in order to exclude the lower and hottest current of the air, along with the clouds of dust which it sets in motion ; and the cooler portion descends into the house through the funnels.@@<hi rend="superscript">1 </hi>When Lieutenant now Colonel Pottinger was at Tatta with the mission that was sent to the court of Hydrabad in 1808, the rains were extremely violent ; they descended so heavily that the streets frequently ran like rivulets ; and in the coolest apartment, the thermometer usually ranged from 94 to 102 ; this was in June. Towards the middle of July it became much cooler, and strong northerly gales set in, which cooled the air ; and at Hydrabad, during the summer season, the mission experienced the heaviest falls of rain, which caused the Futelee river to overflow its banks ; and owing to the exhalations from a burning sun, the thermometer seldom falling below 102, and the atmosphere at night being particularly oppressive, beyond, Colonel Pottinger observes, what he had ever experienced in India, the followers of the mission were attacked by fevers and other complaints ; and it was only by taking regular exercise, and using requisite precautions, that the gentlemen of the mission continued to maintain themselves in health.@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p><p>The country increases in barrenness as it recedes eastward from the Indus, and its tributaries ; and in the vicinity of the Northern Runn, it is described by Dr. Burnes, who travelled through this country in 1825, as a dead unproductive flat, a perfect desert, in which not a tree, house, nor human being, was to be seen, and where it was even difficult to procure a little brackish water from the stagnant marshes that were occasionally seen. For about fifty miles eastward from Cutch, as far as the town of Ruree, and nearly the same distance from the Indus the country presents the same aspect ; namely, a sterile flat. The town of Ruree, though superior to most of the towns in this country, yet being removed beyond the freshes of the Indus had suffered severely from drought, so that the inhabitants were reduced below 500.@@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi> The villages which are met with in this country, have also the same miserable appearance, being far inferior to those of Cutch, on the eastern side of the Runn. In place of the stone buildings, and tiled roofs, which give an air of neatness and comfort to those of the latter country, they are for the most part collections of low huts, composed of clay and thatch ; and even the mosques are built of the same frail materials, of rather greater elevation indeed, and with a feeble attempt at ornament. Many of the inhabitants inhabit grass hovels in the fields, from which, by hard labour, they extort a miserable subsistence. When either food or forage fail, it is not unusual</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@,</hi> Rennel's Memoir of a Map of Hindostan. p. 290.	</p><p>@@@’ Pottinger's Narrative, chap. 10, p. 368.</p><p>@@@* See Narrative of a Visit to the Court of Sinde, by James Burnes, p 36.</p></body></text></TEI>
