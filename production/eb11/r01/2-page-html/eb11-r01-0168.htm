<p><span class="font2">In the spring of 1663 Ray started together with Willughby and two other pupils on a tour through Europe, from which he&nbsp;returned in March 1666, parting from Willughhy at Montpellier,&nbsp;whence the latter continued his journey into Spain. He had&nbsp;previously in three different journeys (1658, 1661, 1662)&nbsp;travelled through the greater part of Great Britain, and selections from his private notes of these journeys were edited by&nbsp;George Scott in 1760, under the title of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mr Ray's Itineraries. </span><span class="font2">Ray himself pubhshed an account of his foreign travel in 1673,&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Observations topographical, moral, and physiological,&nbsp;made on a Journey through part of the Low Gauntries, Germany,&nbsp;Italy, and France.</span><span class="font2"> From this tour Ray and Willughby returned&nbsp;laden with collections, on which they meant to base complete&nbsp;systematic descriptions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms.&nbsp;Willughhy undertook the former part, but, dying in 1672, left&nbsp;only an ornithology and ichthyology, in themselves vast, for&nbsp;Ray to edit; while the latter used the botanical collections for&nbsp;the groundwork of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Methodus plantarum nova</span><span class="font2"> (1682), and&nbsp;his great </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Historia generalis plantarum</span><span class="font2"> (3 vols., 1686, 1688,&nbsp;1704). The plants gathered on his British tours had already&nbsp;been described in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogus plantarum Angliae</span><span class="font2"> (1670), which&nbsp;work is the basis of all later English flotas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1667 Ray was elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1669 he published in conjunction with Willughby his first&nbsp;paper in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions</span><span class="font2"> on “ Experiments&nbsp;concerning the Motion of Sap in Trees.” They demonstrated&nbsp;the ascent of the sap through the wood of the tree, and supposed&nbsp;the sap to “ precipitate a kind of white coagulum or jelly,&nbsp;which may be well conceived to be the part which every year&nbsp;between bark and tree turns to wood and of which the leaves&nbsp;and fruits are made.’’ Immediately after his admission into&nbsp;the Royal Society he was induced by Bishop John Wilkins to&nbsp;translate his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Real Character</span><span class="font2"> into Latin, and it seems he actually&nbsp;completed a translation, which, however, remained in manuscript; his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Methodus plantarum nova</span><span class="font2"> was in fact undertaken as&nbsp;a part of Wilkins’s great classificatory scheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1673 Ray married Margaret Oakley </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font2">Launton (Oxford); in 1676 he went to Sutton Coldfield, and in 1677 to Falborne&nbsp;Hall in Essex. Finally, in 1679, he removed to Black Notley,&nbsp;where he afterwards remained. His life there was quiet and&nbsp;uneventful, but embittered by bodily weakness and chronic&nbsp;sores. He occupied himself in writing hooks and in keeping&nbsp;up a wide scientific correspondence, and Iived, in spite of his&nbsp;infirmities, to the age of seventy-six, dying at Black Notley on&nbsp;the 17th of January 1705. The Ray Society, for the publication of works on natural history, was founded in his honour in&nbsp;1844.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ray’s first book, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogus plantarum circa Cantabrigiam nascentium</span><span class="font1"> (1660, followed by appendices in 1663 and 1685), was&nbsp;written in conjunction with his “ amicissimus et individuus comes,”&nbsp;John Nid. The plants, 626 in number, are enumerated alphabetically, but a system of classification differing little from Caspar&nbsp;Bauhin's is sketched at the end of the book; and the notes contain&nbsp;many curious references to other parts of natural history. The&nbsp;stations of the plants are minutely described ; and Cambridge&nbsp;students still gather some of their rarer plants in the copses or&nbsp;chalk-pits where he found them. The book shows signs of his&nbsp;indebtedness to Joachim Jung of Hamburg, who had died in 1657,&nbsp;leaving his writings unpublished; but a MS. copy of some of them&nbsp;was sent to Ray by Samuel Hartlib in 1660. Jung invented or gave&nbsp;precision to many technical terms which Ray and others at once&nbsp;made use of in their descriptions, and which are now classical ; and&nbsp;his notions of what constitutes a specific distinction and what&nbsp;characters are valueless as such seem to have been adopted with&nbsp;little change by Ray. The first two editions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogus&nbsp;plantarum Angliae</span><span class="font1"> (1670, 1677) were likewise arranged alphabetically; but in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Synopsis stirpium Britannicarum</span><span class="font1"> (1690, 1696,&nbsp;also re-edited by Dilĭemus, 1724, and by Hifl, 1760) Ray applied&nbsp;the scheme of classification which he had by that time elaborated&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Methodus</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia plantarum.</span><span class="font1"> The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Methodus plantarum nova</span><span class="font1"> (1682) was largely based on the works of Caesalpînus&nbsp;and Jung, and still more on that of Robert Morison of Oxford. The&nbsp;greatest merit of this book is the use of the number of cotyledons&nbsp;as a basis of classification; though it must be remembered that&nbsp;the difference between the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous&nbsp;embryo was detected by Nehemiah Grew. After dividing plants&nbsp;into flowerless and flowering Ray says, “ Floriferas dividemus in&nbsp;Dicotyledones, quarum semina sata binis foliis anomalis, seminal-ibus. dictis, quae cotyledonorum </span><span class="font2">usum </span><span class="font1">praestant, e terra exeunt,&nbsp;vel in binos saltem lobos dividuntur, quamvis eos supra terrem&nbsp;foliorum specie non efferunt; et Monocotyledones, quae nec folia&nbsp;bina seminalia efferunt nec lobos binos condunt. Haec divisio&nbsp;ad arbores etiam extendi potest ; siquidem Palmae et congeneres hoc&nbsp;respectu eodem modo a reliquis arboribus differunt quo Monocotyledones a reliquis herbis.” But a serious blemish was his persistent&nbsp;separation of trees from herbs, a distinction whose falsity had been&nbsp;exposed by Jung and others, but to which Ray tried to give scientific&nbsp;foundation by denying the existence of buds in the latter. At this&nbsp;time he based his classification, like Caesalpînus, chiefly upon the&nbsp;fruit, and he distinguished several natural groups, such as the&nbsp;grasses, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lαbiatae, Umbelliferae</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Papilionaceae.</span><span class="font1"> The classification of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Methodus</span><span class="font1"> was extended and improved in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia&nbsp;plantarum,</span><span class="font1"> but was disfigured by a large class of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Αnοmalae,</span><span class="font1"> to include&nbsp;forms that the other orders did not easily admit, and by the separation of the cereals from other grasses. This vast book enumerates&nbsp;and describes all the plants known to the author or described by&nbsp;his predecessors, to the number, according to Adanson, of 18,625&nbsp;species. In the first volume a chapter “ De plantis in genere ”&nbsp;contains an account of all the anatomical and physiological knowledge of the time regarding plants, with the recent speculations&nbsp;and discoveries of Caesalpînus, Grew, Malpighi and Jung; and&nbsp;Cuyier and Dupetit Thouars, declaring that it was this chapter&nbsp;which gave acceptance and authority to these authors’ works, say&nbsp;that “ the best monument that could be erected to the memory of&nbsp;Ray would be the republication of this part of his work separately.”&nbsp;The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Stirpium Europaearum extra Britαnnias nascentium Syllοge&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1694) is a much amplified edition of the catalogue of plants collected&nbsp;on his own European tour. In the preface to this book he first&nbsp;clearly admitted the doctrine of the sexuality of plants, which, however, he had no share in establishing. Here also begins his long&nbsp;controversy with Rivinus (Augustus Quirinus Bachmann) which&nbsp;chiefly turned upon Ray’s indefensible separation of ligneous from&nbsp;herbaceous plants, and also upon what he conceived to be the misleading reliance that Rivinus placed on the characters of the corolla.&nbsp;But in the second edition of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Methodus</span><span class="font1"> (1703) he followed Rivinus&nbsp;and J. P. de Tournefort in taking the flower instead of the fruit as&nbsp;his basis of classification: he was no longer a fructicist but a&nbsp;corollist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides editing his friend Willughby’s books, Ray wrote several zoological works of his own, including </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Synopsis methodica Animalium&nbsp;Quadrupedum et Serpentini Generis</span><span class="font1"> (1693), that is to say, both&nbsp;mammals and reptiles, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Synopsis methodica Avium et Piscium&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1713); the latter was published posthumously, as was also the&nbsp;more important </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia Insectorum</span><span class="font1"> (1710), which embodied a&nbsp;great mass of Willughby’s notes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Most of Ray’s minor works were the outcome of his faculty for carefully amassing facts; for instance, his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collection of English&nbsp;Proverbs</span><span class="font1"> (1670), his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collection of Out-of-the-way English Words&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1674), his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collection of Curious Travels and Voyages</span><span class="font1"> (1693), and his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dictionariolum trilingue</span><span class="font1"> (1675, 5th edition as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nomenclator classicus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1706). The last was written for the use of Willughby’s sons, his&nbsp;pupils; it passed through many editions, and is still useful for&nbsp;its careful identifications of plants and animals mentioned by&nbsp;Greek and Latin writers. But Ray’s influence and reputation&nbsp;have depended largely upon his two books entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Wisdom&nbsp;of God manifested in the Works of the Creation</span><span class="font1"> (1691), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Miscellaneous Discourses concerning the Dissolution and Changes of the World&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1692). The latter includes three essays on “ The Primitive Chaos&nbsp;and Creation of the World,” “ The General Deluge, its Causes&nbsp;and Effects,” and “ The Dissolution of the World and Future&nbsp;Conflagrations.” The germ of these works was contained in&nbsp;sermons preached long before in Cambridge. Both books obtained&nbsp;immediate popularity, and the former, at least, was translated&nbsp;into several languages. In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Wisdom of God, &amp;c.,</span><span class="font1"> Ray recites&nbsp;innumerable examples of the perfection of organic mechanism,&nbsp;the multitude and variety of living creatures, the minuteness and&nbsp;usefulness of their parts, and many, if not most, of the familiar&nbsp;examples of purposive adaptation and design in nature were&nbsp;suggested by him, such as the structure of the eye, the hollowness&nbsp;of the bones, the camel’s stomach and the hedgehog’s armour.</span></p>
