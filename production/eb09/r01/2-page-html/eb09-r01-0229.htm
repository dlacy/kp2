<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">one exception confirmatory, penetrate somewhat further into details. The general process can be made out with especial clearness in fig. 13.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Oscar Hertwig had clearly enunciated in 1875 that “fertilization depends upon the conjugation of two sexually differentiated nuclei.”&nbsp;This view has, however, lately (1883) been controverted by A.&nbsp;Schneider, who regards the radii which are seen in the ovum about&nbsp;the pronuclei as arising from the substance of the germinal vesicle&nbsp;alone, and who maintains the origin of the male pronucleus&nbsp;independently of the spermatozoon, which he believes to disappear.&nbsp;As Van Beneden, Nussbaum, and Flemming have since, however,&nbsp;successively controverted these views, Hertwig’s account of the&nbsp;process may safely be retained, at any rate with the slight modification insisted on by Flemming, who prefers to describe the conjugation-nucleus as arising from the union of “the chromatin of&nbsp;a male with that of a female nuclear body.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Yan Beneden’s work on the fecundation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ascaris</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the penetration of a single spermatozoon into the vitellus and its&nbsp;transmutation into the male pronucleus are copiously figured and&nbsp;described. Most important, however, is perhaps his account of the&nbsp;formation and segmentation of the conjugation-nucleus. The.&nbsp;female pronucleus undergoes changes resembling those preceding&nbsp;ordinary nuclear division; so also does the male; and the&nbsp;chromatin of each breaks up from the state of a single continuous&nbsp;and convoluted fibril into two V-shaped loops. The two pro-nuclear membranes now fuse ; and the resultant conjugation-nucleus&nbsp;thus contains four loops of chromatin, of which two are male and&nbsp;two female. Each loop now undergoes longitudinal division ; a&nbsp;nuclear spindle is meanwhile forming from the achromatin substance&nbsp;of the segmentation-nucleus, and this now proceeds to divide, but&nbsp;in such wise that each of the two daughter nuclei receives two of&nbsp;its four half loops of chromatin from the female and two from the&nbsp;male pronucleus. A circular furrow appears, dividing the ovum&nbsp;equatorially ; a cell plate like that of a vegetable cell arises in the&nbsp;same plane ; and the two first blastomeres are soon completely&nbsp;formed, and proceed to redivide in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The results of Nussbaum are essentially similar so far as they go; Strasburger’s recent work summarized below contains a&nbsp;thorough confirmation of these accounts of the process of fecundation so far as plants are concerned; while most recently (1885)&nbsp;0. Hertwig has re-stated his original theorem with a discussion of&nbsp;its physiological aspects and consequences. (14)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Segmentation of the Ovum</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The process of segmentation has already been repeatedly mentioned. As with the other histological problems presented by the ovum,&nbsp;our knowledge of its minute details is in a somewhat&nbsp;unsettled yet rapidly advancing state, due to the progress of the wider inquiry into cell structure and cell&nbsp;division in general. The essential correspondence of the&nbsp;changes to be observed in the conjugation-nucleus and&nbsp;yolk with those of ordinary cell-division (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Protozoa,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xix. p. 833, fig. 1) has been worked out by many</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">observers, and Van Beneden’s more minute account of the process is summarized above. Our knowledge of its&nbsp;external features is of much older date, and has been comparatively recently brought together by Balfour (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Embryology</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">., i., chap, iii.); the present limits permit only the&nbsp;briefest summary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In the simplest case—that of small ova destitute of food-yolk,—the ovum divides by a vertical plane into two&nbsp;segments or blastomeres, each of these again into two, and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">so on, and a mass of 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, &amp;c., cells is thus formed, but in the resultant mulberry-mass or morula the&nbsp;cells are all equal and similar. Such segmentation is&nbsp;termed regular; commonly, however, the regularity and&nbsp;equality of ordinary cell-division is more or less interfered&nbsp;with by the presence of food-yolk. In this regard Balfour&nbsp;enunciates the valuable general law “ that the velocity of&nbsp;segmentation in any part of the ovum is, roughly speaking, proportional to the concentration of the protoplasm&nbsp;there, and that the size of the segments is inversely proportional to the concentration of the protoplasm.” Bearing this in mind, the varieties of segmentation are intelligible enough ; thus the unequal segmentation of the Frog’s&nbsp;ovum (fig. 15) needs no further explanation. These two</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">preceding types, in which segmentation is complete, were distinguished by Remak as “ holoblastic,” and were long&nbsp;looked upon as wholly distinct from “ meroblastic ” ova&nbsp;like that of Fowls or most Fishes, in which segmentation&nbsp;is partial, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> confined&nbsp;to a small area of the&nbsp;surface of the yolk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Balfour’s law, however, explains these cases as only an exaggeration of the preceding case, due to&nbsp;the greater accumulation of food-yolk, and the consequent check to segmentation at the lower or vegetative pole. Another form of&nbsp;partial segmentation is presented by many Arthropods, in&nbsp;which the yolk occupies a central position within the ovum,&nbsp;and three varieties of this “ centrolecithal ” process are distinguished—equal, unequal, and superficial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">While the ontogenetic process of segmentation in general and of regular segmentation in particular is usually regarded as being a recapitulation of the phylogenetic&nbsp;development of the primitive </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Metazoon</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> from its Protozoan&nbsp;ancestor, the vast nutritive importance of the food-yolk,&nbsp;and the consequent high variability of its quantity in&nbsp;relation to the habits and circumstances both of parent&nbsp;and offspring, render its wide variations in detail a totally&nbsp;unsafe guide to affinities. A single genus may, in fact,&nbsp;exhibit extreme forms. (11)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">§ 3. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">SYSTEMATIC AND GENERAL EMBRYOLOGY.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">While it is impossible to compress within the limits of the present article the subject-matter of a full treatise on&nbsp;embryology, an attempt must be made to touch in turn&nbsp;upon (1) the empirical facts, (2) the concrete inductions,&nbsp;and (3) the abstract generalizations of development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1. A sketch of the history of this branch of the science is given under </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Embryology (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">while for detailed information as to the division and differentiation of the ovum&nbsp;in each group, and as to the more or less marked changes&nbsp;by which the resulting embryonic forms assume the adult&nbsp;organization, the reader must be referred to the separate&nbsp;articles </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(Sponges, Hydrozoa, Mollusca, &amp;c.), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">as w׳ell as&nbsp;to the classical work of Balfour. The more important&nbsp;empirical facts need thus only the briefest outline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Protozoa.—Since the young </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Protozoon,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> whatever its mode of origin from the parent form may be, rarely differs from the latter</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
