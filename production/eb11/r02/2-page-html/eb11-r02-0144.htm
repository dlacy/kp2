<p><span class="font1">meaning attached to it in current usage. It is applied more particularly to the investigations of those who devote themselves to the study of pure as opposed to applied science, to&nbsp;the investigation of causes rather than to practical experiment;&nbsp;thus while every surgeon or physician who treats an individual&nbsp;case of cancer may add to our sum of knowledge of the disease,&nbsp;the body of trained investigators which is endowed by the&nbsp;Cancer Research Fund are working on different lines. Again,&nbsp;the practical engineers who are building aeroplanes, and those&nbsp;who are making practical tests by actual flight in those machines,&nbsp;cannot be called “ researchers ”; that term should be confined to the members, for example, of the scientific committee&nbsp;appointed by the British Government in 1909 to make investigations regarding aerial construction and navigation. Further,&nbsp;the term is particularly used of a course of post-graduate study&nbsp;at a university, for which many universities have provided&nbsp;special Research Studentships or Fellowships. These act as&nbsp;endowments for a specific period, and are conditional on the&nbsp;holder devoting his time to the investigation at first hand of&nbsp;some specified subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESENDE, ANDRÉ DE (1498-1573), the father of archaeology in Portugal, began life as a Dominican friar, but about 1540 passed over to the ranks of the secular clergy. He spent&nbsp;many years travelling in Spain, France and Belgium, where he&nbsp;corresponded with Erasmus and other learned men. He was&nbsp;also intimate with King John· III. and his sons, and acted as&nbsp;tutor to the Infante D. Duarte. Resende enjoyed considerable&nbsp;fame in his lifetime, but modern writers have shown that he is&nbsp;neither accurate nor scrupulous. In Portuguese he wrote:</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RESENDE, GARCIA DE (1470-1536), Portuguese poet and editor, was born at Evora, and began to serve John II. as a page&nbsp;at the age of ten, becoming' his private secretary in 1491. He&nbsp;was present at his death at Alvor on the 25th of October 1495.&nbsp;He continued to enjoy the same favour with King Manoel, whom&nbsp;he accompanied to Castile in 1498, and from whom he obtained&nbsp;a knighthood of the Order of Christ. In 1514 Resende went to&nbsp;Rome with Tristao da Cunha, as secretary and treasurer of the&nbsp;famous embassy sent by the king to offer the tribute of the East&nbsp;at the feet of Pope Leo X. In 1516 he was given the rank of a&nbsp;nobleman of the royal household, and became </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">escriväo de fazenda&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">to Prince John, afterwards King John III., from whom he&nbsp;received further pensions in 1525. Resende built a chapel in&nbsp;the monastery of Espinhciro near Evora, the pantheon of the&nbsp;Alemtejo nobility, where he was buried.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He began to cultivate the making of verses in the palace of John II., and he tells us how one night when the king was in&nbsp;bed he caused him (Resende) to repeat some “ trovas ” of Jorge&nbsp;Manrique, saying it was as needful for a man to know them as to&nbsp;know the Pater Noster. Under these conditions, Resende grew&nbsp;up no mean poet, and moreover distinguished himself by his&nbsp;skill in drawing and music; while he collected into an album&nbsp;the best court verse of the time. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cancioneiro Geral,</span><span class="font1"> probably&nbsp;begun in 1483 though not printed until 1516, includes the compositions of some three hundred </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fidalgos</span><span class="font1"> of the reigns of kings&nbsp;Alphonso V., John II. and ManoeL The main subjects of its&nbsp;pieces are love, satire and epigram, and most of them are written&nbsp;in the national redondilha yerse, but the metre is irregular and&nbsp;the rhyming careless. The Spanish language is largely employed,&nbsp;because the Uterary progenitors of the whole collection were&nbsp;Juan de Mena, Jorge Manrique, Boscan and Garcilasso. As a&nbsp;rule the compositions were improvised at palace entertainments,&nbsp;at which the poets present divided into two bands, attacking&nbsp;and defending a given theme throughout successive evenings.&nbsp;At other times these poetical soirées took the form of a mock&nbsp;trial at law, in which the queen of John II. acted as judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Resende was much twitted by other rhymesters on his corpulence, but he repaid all their gibes with interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The artistic value of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cancioneiro Geral</span><span class="font1"> is slight. Conventional in tone, the greater part are imitations of Spanish poets and show no trace of inspiration in their authors. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cancioneiro</span><span class="font1"> is redeemed from complete insipidity by Rcsende&nbsp;himself, and his fine verses on the death of D. Ignez de Castro&nbsp;inspired the great episode in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lusiads</span><span class="font1"> of Camoens </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Resende is the compiler of a gossiping chronicle of his patron&nbsp;John II., which, though plagiarized from the chronicle by Ruy&nbsp;de Pina </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> has a value of its own. The past lives again in&nbsp;these pages, and though Resende’s anecdotes may be unimportant in themselves, they reveal much of the inner fife of the&nbsp;15th century. Resende’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Miscellanea,</span><span class="font1"> a rhymed commentary&nbsp;on the most notable events of his time, which is annexed to his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle,</span><span class="font1"> is a document full of historical interest, and as a poem&nbsp;not without merit. The editions of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font1"> are those of&nbsp;IS45, 1554, 1596, 1607, 1622, 1752 and 1798.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RESERVATION (Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Teservare,</span><span class="font1"> to keep back), the act or action of keeping back or withholding something. There are&nbsp;some technical uses of the term. In English law “ reservation ”&nbsp;is used of the retention by the vendor or lessor, in a conveyance&nbsp;or lease, of some right or interest, which without such reservation&nbsp;would have passed to the purchaser or tenant; such “ reservations ” usually are concerned with rights of way or other easements or sporting rights. In ecclesiastical usage, the term is&nbsp;applied to the practice of preserving unconsumed a portion of&nbsp;the consecrated elements after the celebration of the Eucharist.&nbsp;For the history of this practice and its usage in the Roman,&nbsp;Greek and English churches, see Eucharist,§ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">-Reservation of the&nbsp;Eucharist.</span><span class="font1"> In the Roman Church, where the pope retains for&nbsp;himself the right to nominate to certain benefices, that action is&nbsp;termed, technically, “ reservation.” When in making a statement, taking an oath, &amp;c., a person qualifies that statement in&nbsp;his mind, or withholds some fact, word or expression which, if&nbsp;expressed, would materially alter the effect of his statement or&nbsp;oath, such qualification is termed a “ mental reservation,” or,&nbsp;in the technical language of casuistry, “ mental restriction ”&nbsp;(see Liguori). The system of providing special tracts of land&nbsp;exclusively for the tribes of American Indians, adopted in the&nbsp;United States of America and in Canada, is known as the Reservation system, and such tracts are styled Indian Reservations.&nbsp;(See United States and Canada.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESHT, the capital of the province of Gilan in Persia, in 37° 17' N., and 49° 36' E., on the left bank of the Siah-rud (Black&nbsp;river), which is a branch of the Sefid-rud (White river), and flows&nbsp;into the Murdab, lagoon of Enzeli. The distance from Enzeli,&nbsp;the port of disembarcation from Russia, on the S. shore of thc&nbsp;Caspian, to Resht is 14 m. in a direct line, and is accomplished in&nbsp;an open boat, or (since 1892), depth of water permitting, in a&nbsp;small steamboat to Pir-i-Bazar and thence 6 m. on a good road&nbsp;by carriage. Resht has a population of 60,000 and is the residence&nbsp;of English, Russian, French and Turkish consuls and the seat of&nbsp;the governor-general of the province of Gilan. The town is&nbsp;situated in low, malarious ground, and was originally buried in&nbsp;jungle, but the Rhssians during their occupation of the place in&nbsp;1723-34 cleared much timber and jungle and made some open&nbsp;spaces. The houses are red-tiled and raised from the ground,&nbsp;with broad verandahs and overhanging eaves.
