The MS. of the hymns, written by his own hand, was said to have been preserved&nbsp;in the church of Cyrus, in which he was buried and celebrated&nbsp;as a saint on the ist of October. Prof. C.

<p><span class="font1">ROMANOV, the name of the Russian imperial dynasty, regnant in the male line from 1613 to 1730, and thenceforward&nbsp;in the female line. The Romanovs descended from Andrei,&nbsp;surnamed Kobyla, who is said to have come to Moscow from&nbsp; Prussia about 1341 to enter the service of the grand-duke&nbsp;Semen (d. 1353). His son Feodor, surnamed Koschka, was&nbsp;the ancestor of the families of Suchovo-Kobylin, Kalytschev&nbsp;and Scheremetjev, as well as of the Romanovs. Feodor’s&nbsp;grandson, Sakhariya Ivanovich, was a boyar of Vasilii V.,&nbsp;grand-duke of Moscow at intervals between 1425 and 1462,&nbsp;and the family took its name from his grandson Roman, whose&nbsp;daughter Anastasia Romanovna married the tsar Ivan the&nbsp;Terrible. Her brother Nikita Romanovich married the princess&nbsp;Eudoxia Alexandrovna, a descendant of Andrei Jaroslavovich,&nbsp;grand-duke of Susdal-Vladimir (d. 1264), and in this way the&nbsp;Romanovs were linked up with the ancient royal house of&nbsp;Rurik. The Romanovs suffered heavily in the disorders following on the death of Ivan. Some were executed and others&nbsp;exiled. Nikita’s son Feodor (the archimandrite Philaret)&nbsp;was banished, but was recalled by the false Demetrius. In&nbsp;1610 he was imprisoned by the king of Poland, but his piety&nbsp;and virtues led to the election of his son, Mikhail Feodorovich&nbsp;Romanov, to the throne of the tsars in 1613. Philaret became&nbsp;patriarch of Moscow in 1619, and supported his son’s government until his death in 1634. Mikhail Was seventeen when he&nbsp;began his reign, and died in 1645. He was succeeded by his&nbsp;son Alexis, whose three sons, Feodor III., Ivan II. and Peter I.&nbsp;(the Great), inherited the throne. After the two years* reign of&nbsp;Peter’s widow, Ekaterina Aleksievna Skavronska (Catherine I.),&nbsp;his grandson, Peter Aleksievich (Peter II.), succeeded. He&nbsp;died in 1730, and the succession devolved on the family of&nbsp;Ivan II., on his daughter Anna (1730-40) and his great-grandson Ivan III., and in 1741 on Elizabeth, daughter of Peter the&nbsp;Great. Peter’s elder daughter, Anna, had married Charles&nbsp;Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, and with the accession of her&nbsp;son, Peter III., in 1762 begins the present reigning dynasty of</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROMAN RELIGION. In tracing the history of the religion of the Roman people we are not, as in the case of Greece, dealing&nbsp;with separate, though interacting, developments in a number&nbsp;of independent communities, but with a single community&nbsp;which won its way to the headship first of Latium, then of Italy&nbsp;and finally of a European empire. But this very fact of its&nbsp;ever-extending influence, coupled with an absence of dogmatism&nbsp;in belief, which made it at all times ready and even anxious to&nbsp;adopt foreign customs and ideas, gave its religion a constantly&nbsp;shifting and broadening character, so that it is difficult to&nbsp;determine the original essentials. By the time when Latin&nbsp;literature begins, the genuine Roman religion had already&nbsp;been overlaid by foreign cults and modes of thought, by the&nbsp;classical period it was—except in formal observance—practically&nbsp;buried and to a large extent fossilized. But the comparative&nbsp;study </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">religions has suggested the lines of reconstitution&nbsp;and the careful analysis of survivals embedded in literature&nbsp;and the evidence of monumental remains, and in particular&nbsp;of the old calendars, has enabled modem scholars to make good&nbsp;progress in the task of separating the elements due to different&nbsp;periods and influences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Roman people were of Aryan stock, a section of a host of invaders from the north, who overran and settled in the Italian&nbsp;peninsula. They preserved traces of their original nationality&nbsp;not merely in the general cast of their religious thought, but&nbsp;in certain common features such as the worship of the hearth&nbsp;(Vesta) and of the sky-divinity (Jupiter) (see Greek Religion).&nbsp;But the development of their religion was arrested at an earlier&nbsp;stage than that of the Greeks: with them—at any rate in the&nbsp;genuine Roman period—Animism never passed into Anthropomorphism; they stopped at the conception of the “ spirit ”&nbsp;without reaching that of the “ god.” Their belief might be&nbsp;described as a polydemonism rather than a polytheism, or&nbsp;more correctly, to avoid altogether the intrusion of foreign&nbsp;notions, as a “ multinuminism.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the cult and ritual of Rome there are enshrined many survivals from a very early form of religious thought prior to the development of the characteristic Roman attitude of mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fetishism—the belief in the magic or divine power of inanimate objects—is seen in the cult of stones, such as&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">silex</span><span class="font1"> of Jupiter (luppiter), which plays a prominent part&nbsp;in the ceremonial of treaty-making, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lapis</span><span class="font1"> used in the&nbsp;ritual of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">aquaelicium,</span><span class="font1"> a process, probably magic in origin,&nbsp;designed to produce rain after a long drought. The boundary-stones between properties </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{termini}</span><span class="font1"> were also the objects of cult&nbsp;at the annual festival of the Terminalia, and the “ god Terminus,”&nbsp;the symbolic boundary-stone, shares with Jupiter the great&nbsp;temple on the Capitol. Tree-worship </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{q.v.}</span><span class="font1"> again is a constantly&nbsp;recurring feature, seen, for instance, in the permanently sacred&nbsp;character of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ficus Ruminalis</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">caprificus</span><span class="font1"> of the&nbsp;Campus Martius, and above all in the oak of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">luppiter Feretrius,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">on which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">spolia opima</span><span class="font1"> were hung after a victory. Nor did&nbsp;Roman fetishism stop short at natural objects. The household&nbsp;was always the centre of religious cult, and certain objects&nbsp;in the house—the door, the hearth, the store-cupboard </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{penus}—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">seem always to have had a sacred significance, and so became&nbsp;the objects and later the sites of the domestic worship. Of the&nbsp;cult of animals there is just sufficient trace to show that it must&nbsp;formerly have had its place in religious rite; the animals, once&nbsp;the objects of worship, appear in later times as the attributes&nbsp;of divinities, for instance, the sacred wolf and woodpecker of&nbsp;Mars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But Fetishism must very early have developed into Animism, the feeling of the sacredness of the object into the sense of an&nbsp;indwelling spirit. In the animistic attitude we have indeed the true background of the genuine Roman religion;&nbsp;but its characteristic and peculiar development is a kind&nbsp;of “ higher Animism,” which can associate the “ spirit ” not&nbsp;merely with visible and tangible objects, but with states and&nbsp;actions in the life of the individual and the community. No&nbsp;doubt the later </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">indigitamenta</span><span class="font1"> (“ bidding-prayers ”) which give&nbsp;us detailed lists of the spirits which preside over the various&nbsp;actions of the infant, or the stages in the marriage ceremony,&nbsp;or the agricultural operations of the farmer, are due in a large&nbsp;measure to deliberate pontifical elaboration, but they are a&nbsp;true indication of the Roman attitude of mind, which reveals&nbsp;itself continually in the analysis of the cults of the household&nbsp;or the festivals of the agricultural year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The “ powers ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{numina,.</span><span class="font1"> not </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">del),</span><span class="font1"> which thus become the objects of worship, are spirits specialized in function and limited in sphere.&nbsp;They are not conceived of in any anthropomorphic form, their sex&nbsp;even may often be indeterminate (&quot; sive mas, sive femina ” is the&nbsp;constantly recurring formula of prayer), but the sphere of action&nbsp;of each is clearly marked and an appeal to a spirit outside his own&nbsp;special sphere would never even be thought of. Locality thus&nbsp;becomes an important point in the conception of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">numenz</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;household spirits must be worshipped at the door, the hearth, the&nbsp;store-cupboard, and the external spirits of the fields and countryside&nbsp;have their sacred hill-tops or groves. But the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">numen</span><span class="font1"> has no form&nbsp;of sensuous representation, nor does he.need a house to dwell in:&nbsp;statue and temple are alien to the spirit of Roman religion. Nor&nbsp;are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">numina.</span><span class="font1"> not being anthropomorphic, capable of relation</span></p>
