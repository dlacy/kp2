<p><span class="font1">of ten Newtons to be equal to that of one Godwin, we are warranted to ſay, that however great his merits may&nbsp;be, they are not infinite, and that the addition of thoſe&nbsp;of one Newton to them would undoubtedly increaſe&nbsp;their ſum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Righes,</span><span class="font1"> are particular or general. Particular rights are ſuch as belong to certain individuals or orders of&nbsp;men, and not to others. The rights of kings, of mailers, of huſhands, of wives, and, in ſhort, all the rights&nbsp;which originate in fociety, are particular. General&nbsp;rights are thoſe which belong to the ſpecies collectively.&nbsp;Such are our rights to the vegetable produce of the&nbsp;earth, and to the fleſh of animals for food, though&nbsp;about the origin of this latter right there has been much&nbsp;diverfity of opinion, which we have noticed in another&nbsp;place. (See Theology, Parti, ſect. 2d). If the&nbsp;vegetable produce of the earth be included under the&nbsp;general rights of mankind, it is plain that he is guilty&nbsp;of wrong who leaves any conſiderable portion of land&nbsp;waſte merely for his own amuſement : he is leſſening the&nbsp;common llock of proviſion which Providence intended&nbsp;to diſtribute among the ſpecies. On this principle it&nbsp;would not be eaſy to vindicate certain regulations· re -ſpecting game, as well as ſome other monopolies which&nbsp;are protected by the municipal laws of moſt countries.&nbsp;Mr Paley, by juſt reaſoning, has eſtabliſhed this conclu-fion, “ that nothing ought to be ‘made excluſive property which can be conveniently enjoyed in common.”&nbsp;An equal diviſion of land, however, the dream of ſome&nbsp;viſionary reformers, would be injurious to the general&nbsp;rights of mankind, as it may be demonſtrated, that it&nbsp;would leſſen the common ſtock of proviſions, by laying&nbsp;every man under the neceſſity of being his own weaver,&nbsp;tailor, ſhoemaker, ſmith, and carpenter, as well as&nbsp;ploughman, miller, and baker. Among the general&nbsp;rights of mankind is the right of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">neceſſity ;</span><span class="font1"> by which a&nbsp;man may uſe or deſtroy his neighbour’s property when&nbsp;it is abſolutely neceſſary for his own preſervation. It&nbsp;is on this principle that goods are thrown overboard to&nbsp;ſave the ſhip, and houſes pulled down to ſtop the pro-greſs of a fire. In ſuch caſes, however, at leaſt in the&nbsp;laſt,reſtitution ought to be made when it is in our power;&nbsp;but this reſtitution will not extend to the original value of the property deſtroyed, but only to what it was&nbsp;worth at the time of deſtroying it, which, conſidering&nbsp;its danger, might be very little.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIGHTEOUSNESS, means juſtice, honeſty, virtue, goodneſs, and amongſt Chriſtiahs is of exactly the ſame import w-ith holineſs, without which, we are told,&nbsp;no man ſhall ſee the Lord. The doctrine of the fall,&nbsp;and of redemption through Jeſus Chriſt, has occaſioned&nbsp;much deputation, and given riſe to many ſingular notions in the world. The haughty philoſopher, diſſatis-fied with myſteries, and with the humiliating doctrine&nbsp;of atonement by a crucified Saviour, has made a religion for himſelf, which ſhe calls </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rational Chriſtiaηity ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and the enthuſiaſt, by extracting doctrines ſrom Scripture which are not contained in it, and which are repugnant to its ſpirit, has given too much counténance&nbsp;to this preſumption. The doctrine of imputed righte-ouſneſs, by which the merit of Chriſt is ſaid to be imputed </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font1">us, appears to be of this number ; and though&nbsp;it has been held by many good, and by ſome learned&nbsp;men, it is certainly in general unfriendly to virtue, as&nbsp;will be readily allowed by all who have converſed with&nbsp;the more ignorant ſort of Methodiſts in England Or Se-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">ceders in Scotland. That ſt does not follow ſrom the doctrine of the atonement, and conſequently that it has&nbsp;no foundation in Scripture, will appear elſewhere. See&nbsp;Theology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bill cſ Rights,</span><span class="font1"> in law’, is a declaration delivered by the lords and commons to the prince and princeſs of&nbsp;Orange, 13 th February 1688 ; and afterwards enacted&nbsp;in parliament, when they became king and queen. It&nbsp;ſets forth, that king James did, by the aſſiſtance of divers evil counſellors, endeavour to ſubvert the laws and&nbsp;liberties of this kingdom, by exerciſing a power of dif∙&nbsp;penſing with and ſuſpending of laws ; by levying money ſor the uſe of the crown by pretence of prerogative without conſent of parliament ; by proſecuting thoſe&nbsp;who petitioned the king, and diſcouraging petitions&nbsp;by railing and keeping a ftanding army in time of&nbsp;peace ; by violatingſtlie freedom of election of members»&nbsp;to ſerve in parliament ; by violent proſecutions in the&nbsp;court of king’s bench ; and cauſing partial and corrupt&nbsp;jurors to be returned on trials, exceſſive bail to be taken, exceſſive fines to be impoſed, and cruel puniſh-rnents inflicted ; all which were declared to be illegal. And the declaration concludes in theſe remarkable words : “ And they do claim, demand,' and in-ſiſt upon, all and ſingular the premiſes, as their undoubted rights and liberties.” And the act of parliament itſelf (1 W. &amp; M. ſtat. 2. cap. 2.) recognizes&nbsp;“ all and ſingular the rights and liberties, afferted and&nbsp;claimed in the ſaid declaration, to be the true, ancient,&nbsp;indubitable rights of the people of this kingdom.” See&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">LIBERTY.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RIGOLL, or Regals, a kind of muſical </span><span class="font0">infini</span><span class="font1">ment, conſiſting of ſeveral ſticks bound together, only ſeparated by beads. It is tolerably harmonious, being&nbsp;well ſtruck with a ball at the end of a ſtick. Such is&nbsp;the account which Graſſineau gives of this inſtrument.&nbsp;Skinner, upon the authority of an old Engliſh dictionary, represents it as a clavichord, or claricord ; poſſibly&nbsp;founding his opinion on the nature of the office of the&nbsp;tuner of the régals, who ſtill fubſiſts in the eſtabliſh-ment of the king’s chapel at St James’s, and whoſe bu-ſineſs is to keep the organ of the chapel royal in tune ;&nbsp;and not knowing that ſuch wind inſtruments as the organ need frequent tuning, as well as the clavichord and&nbsp;other ſtringed inſtruments. Sir Henry Spelman derives the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rigoll</span><span class="font1"> from the Italian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pιgabello,</span><span class="font1"> a muſical&nbsp;inſtrument, anciently uſed in churches inſtead of the organ. Walther, in his description of the regal, makes it&nbsp;to be a reed-work in an organ, with metal and alſo&nbsp;wooden pipes and bellows adapted to it. And he adds,,&nbsp;that the name of it is ſuppoſed to be own ng to its having been preſented by the inventor to ſome king.—&nbsp;From an account of the regal uſed in Germany, and&nbsp;other parts of Europe, it appears to conſiſt of pipes and&nbsp;keys on one ſide, and the bellows and wind-cheſt on the&nbsp;other. We may add, that Lord Bacon (Nat. Hilt,&nbsp;cent. ii. §. 102,) diſtinguiſhes between the regal and&nbsp;organ, in a manner which ſhows them to be inſtruments&nbsp;of the ſame claſs. Upon the whole, there is reaſon tα&nbsp;conclude, that the regal orrigoll was a pneumatic, and&nbsp;not a ſtringed inſtrument.</span></p>
