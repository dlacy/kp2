In this, much aſſiſtance may be derived from placing a bag of lead-ſhot in the pocket next to the foot employed in making the outſide ſtroke, which will produce an artificial poiſe of the body, which afterwards will become natural by practice. At the commencement of the outſide ſtroke, the knee of the employed limb ſhould be a little bended, and gradually brought to a rectilineal poſition when the ſtroke is completed. When the practitioner becomes expert in forming the ſemicircle with both feet, he is then to join them together, and proceed progreſſively and alternately with both feet, which will carry him forward with a graceful movement. Care ſhould be taken to uſe very little muſcular exertion, for the impelling motion ſhould proceed from the mechanical impulſe of the body thrown into ſuch a poſition as to regulate the  stroke. At taking the outſide ſtroke, the body ought to be thrown forward eaſily, the unemployed limb kept in a direct line with the body, and the face and eyes directly looking forward : the unemployed foot ought to be ſtretched towards the ice, with the toes in a direct line with the leg. In the time of making the curve, the body muſt be gradually, and almoſt imperceptibly, raiſed, and the unemployed limb brought in the ſame manner forward ; ſo that, at finishing the curve, the body will bend a ſmall degree backward, and the unemployed foot will be about two inches before the other, ready to embrace the ice and form a correſpondent curve. The muſcular movement of the whole body muſt correſpond with the movement of the ſkate, and ſhould be regulated ſo as to be almoſt imperceptible to the ſpectators. Particular attention ſhould be paid in carrying round the head and eyes with a regular and imperceptible motion ; for nothing ſo much diminiſhes the grace and elegance of ſkating as ſudden jerks and exertions, which are too frequently uſed by the generality of ſkaters. The management of the arms likewiſe deserves attention. There is no mode of diſpoſing of them more gracefully in ſkating outſide, than folding the hands into each other, or uſing a muff.</p><p>There are various feats of activity and manœuvres uſed upon ſkates ; but they are ſo various that we cannot pretend to detail them. Moving on the outſide is the primary object for a ſkater to attain ; and when he becomes an adept in that, he will eaſily acquire a facility in executing other branches of the art. There are few exerciſes but will afford him hints of elegant and graceful attitudes. For example, nothing can be more beautiful than the attitude of drawing the bow and arrow whilſt the ſkater is making a large circle on the outſide : the manual exerciſe and military ſalutes have likewiſe a pretty effect when uſed by an expert ſkater.</p><p>SKELETON, in anatomy, the dried bones of any animal joined together by wires, or by the natural ligament dried, in ſuch a manner as to show their poſition when the creature was alive.</p><p>We have, in the Philoſophſeal Tranſactions, an account of a human ſkeleton, all the bones of which were ſo united, as to make but one articulation from the back to the os ſacrum, and downwards a little way. On ſawing ſome of them, where they were unnaturally joined, they were found not to cohere throughout their whole ſubſtance, but only about a ſixth of an inch deep</p><p>all round. The figure of the trunk was crooked, the spinæ making the convex, and the inside of the vertebræ the concave part of the ſegment. The whole had been found in a charnel-houſe, and was of the ſize of a full grown perſon.</p><p>SKIDS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Skeeds,</hi> in ſea-language, are long compaſſing pieces of timber, notched below ſo as to fit cloſely upon the wales, extending from the main-wale to the top of the side, and retained in this poſition by bolts or ſpike-nails.

According to the computation of Mr Pennant, Dr Johnſon, and Dr Campbell, it is 60 miles in length, and nearly the ſame in width where broadeſt ; according to others it is 50 miles in length, and in ſome places 30 broad. The iſland of Sky is divided between two proprietors ; the ſouthern part belongs to the laird of Macleod, ſaid to be lineally deſcended from Leod ſon to the black prince of Man ; the northern diſtrict, or barony of Troterniſh, is the property of Lord Macdonald, whoſe anceſtor was Do-</p></body></text></TEI>
