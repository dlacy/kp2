<p><span class="font1">streams, either directly, or through the medium of some of the numerous lakes dispersed throughout various parts. Of&nbsp;these smaller rivers, the Arigna, the Fiorish, and tile Gara&nbsp;or Boyle river, are tributaries to the Shannon ; the Bresgue&nbsp;and the Lung, the latter of which flows through a subterraneous channel during part of its course, discharge their&nbsp;contents into Lough Gara. The most remarkable of the&nbsp;lakes, both for size and beauty, is Lough Kea in the northern part, near the town of Boyle, from which place it also&nbsp;takes a name, as likewise that of Rockingham Lake, from&nbsp;the seat of Lord Lorton upon its shore. It is about three&nbsp;miles in length by two in breadth, and studded with several&nbsp;picturesque islands, amongst which Trinity Island is noted&nbsp;for its monastic ruins, and Castle Island for an ancient&nbsp;fortress of the M<sup>1</sup>Dermots, now modernized into an elegant&nbsp;villa. The lake derives its supply from the neighbouring&nbsp;boundary lake of Lough Gara upon the borders of Sligo,&nbsp;which, though larger, and still more irregular in its outline,&nbsp;is less attractive in appearance than that on which it bestows its redundant waters. To the north of Lough Kea&nbsp;the two smaller lakes, Lough Skeen and Lough Meelagh,&nbsp;are connected by a short channel with the Shannon. The&nbsp;lakes of Bodarrig, Boflin, and Reagh, on its eastern side,&nbsp;which are, strictly speaking, expansions of the Shannon,&nbsp;may also be considered as partially belonging to the county. The principal of the smaller lakes are Loughs Errit,&nbsp;Glynn, Funcheon, and Aluyn. There are several extensive furloughs or winter lakes, which, being generally dry&nbsp;in summer, afford rich pasturage for sheep. Between&nbsp;Frenchpark and Elphin, that of Mantua covers seven hundred acres ; another near Lough Glynn, in the extreme west&nbsp;of the county, is half a mile long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The limestone, which forms the base of all the level districts, is of various kinds, some gray, containing numerous fossil remains, chiefly madrepores ; some of the formation called calp, which is often found blended with layers of Lydian&nbsp;stone ; and some black, being susceptible of a high polish,&nbsp;as is a light gray marble found in the southern parts. Sandstone shows itself in the eminences that protrude through the&nbsp;limestone. Slieve Bawn is mostly composed of it ; and in&nbsp;the neighbourhood of Frenchpark it is raised in laminæ so&nbsp;thin as to be used for the covering of roofs. The northern&nbsp;district is of the coal formation, which extends also into&nbsp;the adjoining county of Leitrim ; but the principal stores&nbsp;of this most valuable mineral, and of ironstone, are to be&nbsp;found on the Roscommon side. The entire area, which is&nbsp;divided into two parts by the Arigna, extends over six&nbsp;thousand five hundred acres, of which two thousand are&nbsp;to the north and four thousand five hundred to the south&nbsp;of that river. The strata of coal rise into the mountains&nbsp;of Bracklieve and Slieve Corkagh, where the outcrop may&nbsp;be distinctly seen in several places in the precipitous sides&nbsp;of the declivities. The coal is of the blazing or bituminous character, less inflammable than that of Scotland,&nbsp;but more so than that of the north of England. The principal beds are the Rover, Gubberother, and Aughabehy&nbsp;collieries, in the latter of which, the chief seam, and the&nbsp;only one deemed sufficiently rich to defray the expense of&nbsp;working, is from one foot to two and a half feet thick, and&nbsp;promises to be abundant in quantity, although subject to&nbsp;interruptions, or wllat the workmen call faults, occasioned&nbsp;by the strata of one part of a hill having slipped down to a&nbsp;depth of from twenty to fifty yards, and settled on a lower&nbsp;level. The principal beds of iron ore are also on the south&nbsp;side of the Arigna river, whence the workings derive their&nbsp;name. They exhibit decisive indications of having been&nbsp;in operation at an early period ; but, most probably in consequence of the exhaustion of timber for fuel, they were&nbsp;latterly inoperative until 1788, when the pit-coal found in&nbsp;the neighbourhood led to a new speculation in them, which,&nbsp;however, was dropped at the end of twenty years. The</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">workings were resumed by three of the mining companies which the extravagant spirit of joint-stock enterprise gave&nbsp;rise to about the year 1825 ; but only one of them, the&nbsp;Arigna company, persevered in the experiment, until involved in a chancery suit as to the right of tenure, which&nbsp;being decided against them in 1836, the works have been&nbsp;resumed by their successful opponent, by whom they are&nbsp;now carried on upon a very extended scale, and with a&nbsp;prospect of adequate remuneration for the capital sunk in&nbsp;the concern. Both the ironstone and the limestone used&nbsp;as a flux have been pronounced to be of prime quality.&nbsp;Potters’ clay is found in several places, and is manufactured into the coarser kinds of wares. Fire-bricks are made&nbsp;at Arigna, of fire-clay, which forms some of the mineral&nbsp;strata there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The soil varies nearly according to the nature of its substratum, that on the limestone being much the most productive ; except in the hilly district between the Shannon and the Suck, in which the stone rises so near the surface&nbsp;that the superincumbent vegetable mould is scarcely of&nbsp;denth sufficient to admit the use of the plough. The borders of the rivers which flow through the level parts, and&nbsp;are therefore liable to overflow their banks during winter,&nbsp;becomc, on the return of dry weather, pastures and meadows of the richest quality. Bogs of every size, from an&nbsp;extent of a thousand acres to patches merely adequate for&nbsp;the domestic demands of the immediate neighbourhood in&nbsp;which they lie, are to be found in many parts. The mountains are mostly covered with bog and marsh, interspersed&nbsp;with dry patches on which heath grows most luxuriantly.&nbsp;In the southern part, large tracts of a very light sandy soil,&nbsp;lying on the low hills between the Suck and the Shannon,&nbsp;afford excellent pasturage for sheep. The borders of Lough&nbsp;Aluyn are in some parts formed of sand, apparently carried&nbsp;from the lake by the wind. Large deposits of gravel and&nbsp;different kinds of loam are often found between the surface-soil and the rock which forms the substratum.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The latest of these returns gives a ratio of one inhabitant to every 2∙54 acres, or of one to every l∙89 cultivated acre.&nbsp;The returns of the Commissioners of Public Instruction in&nbsp;1834 having been made up according to dioceses, though&nbsp;they do not give results sufficiently accurate to be placed&nbsp;along with those in the preceding table, afford data sufficient respecting the comparative numbers of the three&nbsp;principal religious persuasions, to justify the statement, that&nbsp;if the whole population of the county be estimated at 240,000&nbsp;(a close approximation to that of 1831), the numbers of&nbsp;Protestants are 7000, and of Roman Catholics 233,000, being an average of one to thirty-three nearly. The total&nbsp;number of protestant dissenters in the county, according to&nbsp;the same return, was but forty-three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This population was represented in the Irish parliament by eight members ; two for the county at large, and two&nbsp;for each of the boroughs of Boyle, Roscommon, and Tulsk.&nbsp;The number was reduced to two at the Union, all the&nbsp;boroughs being deprived of the right of election. The&nbsp;number of registered electors for the county is about two&nbsp;thousand ; elections are held at Roscommon. The local government is vested in a lieutenant, ten deputy-lieutenants,&nbsp;all appointed by the crown during pleasure, and a hundred&nbsp;magistrates, in which number thc lieutenant and his deputies are included, appointed by the lord chancellor, and continued during good behaviour.
