The inſtant the ſun is ſet, we are aſſailed by an infinity of gnats, which are called <hi rend="italic">muſquitos;</hi> their ſtings are very painful, and their multitudes incredible. The inhabitants find but a poor defence in their gauze- curtains. For my own part, accuſtomed as I had been to live among the Moors, I was but little annoyed by theſe infects. Being half a ſavage, I felt no desire to recommend myſelf to the favourable regard of the fair sex, and I was therefore under no neceſſity of taking care of my perſon. In imitation of my former matters,</p><p>I ſmeared myſelf with butter, and this expedient preſeived me at all times from theſe impertinent flingers, theſe ſpiteful enemies to the repoſe of the human kind.</p><p>“ If the prospect of Senegal is not agreeable to the eye, much lets are its environs, which are covered over only with sand, and over-run with mangles. It may be ſaid, without exaggeration, that there is not a more forlorn ſituation to be found on the face of the inhabited globe, or a place in which the common neceſſaries of life are procured with greater difficulties. Water, that indiſpensable aliment of man, is here not potable. Wells are dug in the land to the depth of five or fix feet, and water is obtained by theſe means ; but whatever pains are taken to freſhen it, it ever retains a brackiſh taſte.</p><p>I have diſtilled this water myſelf, and obſerved that it always had a diſagreeable favour, which cannot fail to be hurtful to the health : it is true, that when the river is high, its ſtreams are freſh, but the water is only the more dangerous. It proves the cauſe of moſt of thoſe maladies which carry off the Europeans ſo rapidly, that at the end of every three years the colony has a ſreſh ſet of inhabitants. The blacks themselves, although accuſtomed to the climate, are not in this ſeaſon free from diſeaſe.”</p><p>The fort of St Louis is a quadrangle, and has two baſtions of conſiderable ſtrength ; but the greateſt ſecurity of the fort is its natural ſituation. The cannon of the fort are numerous, and the arſenal well supplied with small arms and ſtores. Belides this fort the French had no other upon the river, except Fort St Joſeph, which stands about four leagues below the cataract at Govina, though they had a few factories in different parts.</p><p>The principal commodity of this country is that of gum Senagal (ſee <hi rend="italic">GUM-Senegal),</hi> which is a valuable branch of commerce, as it is uſed in many arts and manufactures, particularly by the painters in water-colours, the ſilk weavers, and dyers.</p><p>The French import from the river Senegal not only gum-arabic, but elephants teeth, hides, bees-wax, gold- duſt, cotton, oſtrich feathers, ambergris, indigo, and civet.</p><p>Notwithſtanding the barrenneſs of the ſpot, Senegal contains more than 6000 negroes, including the captives of the Tapades, or negroes born of the black inhabitants of the country. They are never put up to ſale, unleſs convicted of ſome crime. Their huts, conſtructed in the form of bee-hives, and ſupported upon four ſtakes, ſurround the habitations of the negro inhabitants. The entire height of thoſe huts may riſe to about 12 feet, the width in every direction is commonly from 10 to 12. The beds are compoſed of hurdles laid upon croſs-bars, ſupported by forked ſtakes at the height of about a foot irom the ground. Here the slaves</p><p>sleep promiscuouſly, men, women, girls, and boys. A fire is made in the middle of the hut, which is filled with ſmoke, ſnſſicient to stifle any man but a negro.</p><p>The men are tall, and the women are accounted the bandſomeſt negreffes of all Africa. The Senegalians may be conſidered as the moſt courageous people of that part of the world, without even excepting the Moors. Their courage, however, is more nearly allied to temerity than to bravery. In the courſe of the voyage to Galam, they meet the greateſt dangers with gaiety and ſong ; they dread neither muſket nor cannon, and are equally fearleſs of the cayman or crocodile should one of their companions be killed, and devoured by theſe animals before their face, they are not deterred from plunging into the water, if the working of the ſhip require it. Theſe excellent qualifications which diſtinguish them, and on which they value themſelves ſo much, do not, however, preſerve them from the common contagion of the country, which inclines them all to rapine. They are emulous to ſurpaſs one another in all the arts of over-reaching and fraud. The conduct of the Europeans has, no doubt, encouraged theſe vices as much as the lelſons of the marabous, who inculcate the duty of plundering the Chriſtians to the utmoſt of their power.</p><p>The Yolof negroes of Senegal are either Chriſtians or Mahometans, or rather one and the other, or with more truth neither ; religion being a matter of indifference to them. Thoſe on the continent are of the same way of thinking, and their religious practices are kept up only for the sake of form. A bar of iron, a few beads, will make them change their opinion at will. By ſuch means are they acted upon ; a ſufficient proof of their want of all religious principle. The marabous, or prieſts, and the men of their law, are no better than the rest. “ I have examined the character of ſeveral of this order of men (ſays M. Saugmer), and even among the nation of the Poules, who are conſidered as great fanatics, I diſcovered that they were only publicly attached to their opinions. ‘ This white man (say they) does so ; he is better informed than I, and why ſhould not I imitate his example ?” This way of reaſoning is common to all that tract of country.</p><p>The colony of Senegal is ſurrounded with islands, which, on account of the proximity of the ſea, are all- more unhealthy than that on which the town is built. They are full of Handing pools, that, when dried up by the ſun, exhale a putrid vapour that carries mortality with it, and deſolates theſe islands. It is doubtless the ſame cauſe that takes off ſo many of the French at Senegal during the dangerous ſeaſon of the year. This alſo may be in part occaſtoned by the bad quality of the water, which flows from the ponds in the neighbourhood of the colony, and though incorporated with that of the river, comes down little agitated by the current, and is eaſily diſtinguiſhed by a vapidneſs of taſte. This particular is, in my opinion, essentially worthy of notice, and if properly attended to by our medical men, might become the means of preſerving many lives.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">SenEgA</hi><hi rend="italic">L-River,</hi> ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Niger.</hi> As so little is known reſpecting this river, which is one of the greateſt in Africa, any additional information muſt be intereſting.
