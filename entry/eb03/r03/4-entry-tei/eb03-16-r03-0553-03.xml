<p><label>RUSCUS, KNEE-HOLLY</label>
or <hi rend="italic">Butcher’s Broom :</hi> A genus of the ſyngeneſia order, belonging to the dioecia claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 11th order, <hi rend="italic">Sarmentactte.</hi> The male calyx is hexaphyllous ; there is no corolla ; the ncctarium is central, ovate, and perforated at the top. The female calyx, corolla, and nectarium, are the ſame as in the male; there is one ſtyle, with a trilocular two-ſeeded berry.</p><p>The moſt remarkable ſpecies is the aculeatus, or common butcher’s broom, common in the woods in many parts of England. It has roots compoſed of many thick fibres which twine about eaβh other ; from which ariſe ſeveral ſtiff green ſtalks about three feet high, lending out from their ſides ſeveral ſhort branches, gar-niſhed with ſtiff, oval, heart-ſhaped leaves, placed alternately on every part of the ſtalk, ending with ſharp prickly points. The flowers are produced in the middle, on the upper fide of the leaves ; they are ſmall, and cut into ſix parts ; of a purple colour, fitting cloſe to the midrib. They appear in June ; and the female flowers are ſucceeded by benies as large as cherries, of a ſweetiſh taſte, which ripen in winter j when they are of a beautiful red colour. As this plant grows wild in moſt parts of England, it is rarely admitted into gardens ; but if ſome of the roots are planted under tall trees in large plantations, they will ſpread into large clumps ; and as they retain their leaves in winter, at that ſeaſon they will have a good effect. The ſeeds of this plant generally lie a year in the ground before they vegetate ; and the plants ſo raiſed are long before they arrive at a fize big enough to make any figure, and therefore it is much better to tranſplant the roots.— The root of this plant is accounted aperient, and in this intention is ſometimes made an ingredient in apozems and diet-drinks, ſor opening flight obſtructions of the viſcera and promoting the fluid ſecretions. This plant is uſed by the butchers for beſoms to ſweep their blocks. Huckſters place the boughs round their bacon and cheeſe to defend them from the mice ; for they cannot make their way through the prickly leaves.</p>
