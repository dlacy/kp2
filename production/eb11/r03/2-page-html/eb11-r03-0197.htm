<p><span class="font0">excellent translation, with copious illustrations, which appeared in 1900; in the following year Ricgl published the first (which, by reason of his untimely death, remains the only)&nbsp;volume of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Late Roman Industrial Art in Austria and Hungary,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in the opening chapters of which he endeavours to show that&nbsp;the later transformations of Roman art in the 2nd and succeeding centuries after Christ continue to mark a definite&nbsp;advance. On the other hand, the originality of Roman art&nbsp;under the Empire was called in qucsion by Josef Strzygowski,&nbsp;whose first important work on the subject, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orient oder Rom,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">appeared in 1901. Strzygowski holds that even in the imperial&nbsp;period, Rome was receptive rather than creative; that what&nbsp;is termed “ Roman imperial art ” is in reality the latest phase&nbsp;of Hellenistic art, whose chief centres are to be sought in Asia&nbsp;Minor, Syria anti Egypt; and that this late Hellenistic art&nbsp;was itself gradually transformed by the invading spirit of the&nbsp;East into that Byzantine art which is half Greek and half&nbsp;Oriental, but wholly un-Roman. The problem thus stated&nbsp;will presently be discussed; in the meantime it is to be noted&nbsp;that the principal monuments which fall within our province&nbsp;have been at length rendered accessible to students by a series&nbsp;of adequate reproductions. In sculpture, the reliefs of Trajan’s&nbsp;Column have been published by Cichorius, and those of the&nbsp;column of Marcus Aurelius by Petersen and others; in metalwork, the treasure of Bosco Reale has been reproduced in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Monuments Plot,</span><span class="font0"> and that of Hildesheim has been published&nbsp;by the’authorities of the Berlin Museum; a series of reproductions, including all the important examples of Roman&nbsp;painting, is issued by the firm of Bruckmann under the supervision of Paul Herrmann; and the ancient paintings preserved&nbsp;in the Vatican library, which include some of the most famous&nbsp;examples of the art, were published and described by Dr Nogara&nbsp;in 1907. The discussion of the date to be assigned to the&nbsp;Trophy of Trajan at Adam-Klissi in the Dobruja, initiated by&nbsp;Adolf Furtwängler, has led to a closer study of the remains&nbsp;of Roman provincial art; and the discovery of the foundations of the Ara Pacis Augustae at Rome, together with additional remains of its sculptured decoration, has given an impulse&nbsp;to the study of Roman historical monuments. In this field&nbsp;important contributions to knowledge have been made by&nbsp;members of the British school at Rome, which will be noticed&nbsp;below. Finally, the history of Roman sculpture has for the&nbsp;first time been systematically and comprehensively treated&nbsp;by Mrs Strong in a handbook whose copious and well-chosen&nbsp;illustrations add greatly to its value. Thus the necessary&nbsp;equipment has been furnished for students of the problem&nbsp;presented by Roman art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">National Roman Art; Landmarks of its History.—</span><span class="font0">It is impossible to speak of a specifically Roman national art until we&nbsp;approach the latest period of Republican history. The germs&nbsp;of artistic endowment which existed in the Roman character&nbsp;were not developed until her political institutions were matured&nbsp;and her supremacy in the Mediterranean established. Up to&nbsp;that time such works of art as were produced in, or imported&nbsp;into, Rome were without exception Greek or Etruscan. Both&nbsp;in Etruria and in Latium Greek artists were commissioned to&nbsp;decorate the temples in which wood and terra-cotta took the&nbsp;place of the marble which Greece alone could afford to use. In&nbsp;496 B.c., according to tradition, two Greek artists, Damophilos&nbsp;and Gorgasos, decorated the temple of Ceres, Liber and Libera&nbsp;with paintings and sculpture; when the temple was restored&nbsp;by Augustus their terra-cotta reliefs were carefully removed&nbsp;and framed.@@<sup>1</sup> But most of the early sculpture preserved in&nbsp;Rome doubtless belonged to the “ Tuscan ” school, whose&nbsp;works Pliny@@<sup>2</sup> quotes as evidence that there was an art of&nbsp;statuary native to Italy. It is true that Etruscan art was&nbsp;dependent for its motives and technique on Greek models;&nbsp;but in its portraiture—notably in the reclining figures which&nbsp;adorn Etmscan sarcophagi—we can trace the uncompromising&nbsp;realism and close attention to detail which are native to Italian&nbsp;soil; the fragments of temple-sculptures which have been&nbsp;preserved are of less value, since, if not the work of Greeks,&nbsp;they are entirely Greek in conception. Roman portraiture&nbsp;undoubtedly continues the Etruscan tradition. It was a&nbsp;common custom in Etruria to decorate the urn containing the&nbsp;ashes of the dead with a lid in the form of the human head&nbsp;(such urns are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">canopi),</span><span class="font0"> and the same desire to record the&nbsp;features of the departed produced the waxen masks, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imagines,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which were preserved in the houses of the Roman aristocracy.&nbsp;In architecture, too, Roman builders learnt much from their&nbsp;Etruscan neighbours, from whom they borrowed the characteristic form of their temples, and perhaps also the prominent use&nbsp;of the arch and vault. But the stream of Etmscan influence&nbsp;was met by a counter-current from the south, where the Greek&nbsp;colonics in Campania provided a natural channel by which&nbsp;Hellenic ideas reached the Latin race; and Roman architects&nbsp;soon abandoned the purely Etmscan type of temple for one&nbsp;which closely followed western Greek models. The conquests&nbsp;of the later Republic, however, brought them into more direct&nbsp;contact with the art of Greece proper. Beginning from 212 B.c.,&nbsp;when Marcellus despoiled Syracuse of its principal statues, every&nbsp;victorious general adorned his triumph with masterpieces of&nbsp;Greek art, whether of sculpture or of painting, and, when&nbsp;Philhellenism became the ruling fashion at Rome, wealthy&nbsp;connoisseurs formed private collections drawn from the Greek&nbsp;provinces—Greek craftsmen, moreover, were employed in the&nbsp;decoration of the palaces of the Roman nobles and capitalists,&nbsp;which scarcely differed from those of the great Hellenistic&nbsp;cities. Except in portraiture, there was nothing characteristically Roman in the art which flourished in Rome in the time&nbsp;of Caesar and Cicero. But the remains of an altar, preserved&nbsp;partly at Munich and partly in the Louvre (Plate II. fig. 10),&nbsp;which is believed with good reason to have been set up by&nbsp;Cn. Domitius Ahenobarbus shortly before 30 B.c., furnish an&nbsp;early example of the historical, or, to speak more exactly,&nbsp;commemorative art, to whose development the Empire gave so&nbsp;powerful an impulse. On the one face of the altar we find a&nbsp;Greek subject—the marriage of Poseidon and Amphitrite,—&nbsp;on the other a Roman sacrifice, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">SuovetaurUia,</span><span class="font0"> with other&nbsp;scenes from the life of the army. Augustus enlisted art, as he&nbsp;did literature, in the service of the new order. The remarkable&nbsp;technical dexterity which characterizes all forms of art in this&nbsp;period—silver plate and stucco decoration, as well as sculpture&nbsp;in the round or in relief—is purely Greek; but the form is&nbsp;filled with a new content. For Augustus determined to enlist&nbsp;art as well as literature in the service of the new regime, and&nbsp;this purpose was served not only by public monuments, such&nbsp;as the Ara Pacis Augustae (Plate II. figs. 11-13), but by the&nbsp;masterpieces of the silversmith’s and gem-engraver’s art (Plate&nbsp;VII. figs. 32-37). In the art, as in the literature of the Augustan&nbsp;age, classicism was the dominant note, and the naturalism so&nbsp;congenial to the Italian temperament was repressed, though&nbsp;never extinguished. The result of this was that under the&nbsp;Julio-Claudian dynasty academic tradition filled the place of&nbsp;inspiration, and Roman art failed to discover its vocation. A&nbsp;change came under the Flavian emperors. The painters who&nbsp;decorated with fairy landscapes the walls of Roman palaces,&nbsp;untrammelled by the conventions of official art, introduced&nbsp;into Rome a summary method of working, which has much in&nbsp;common with that of the modern impressionist school; and&nbsp;the sculptors of the Flavian period laid to heart the lesson taught&nbsp;by their successful “ illusionism ” (to borrow Wickhoff’s term).&nbsp;We shall see that this is true of all forms of sculpture—historical&nbsp;sculpture, portraiture and decorative ornament; and we are&nbsp;entitled to rank this Flavian art as the specific creation of&nbsp;imperial Rome, whatever may have been the precise nationality&nbsp;of the individual workers who adorned the new capital of the&nbsp;world. But this phase was of short duration; and the Roman&nbsp;spirit, which in harmony with that of Greece had produced&nbsp;such brilliant results, triumphed under Trajan and found its&nbsp;characteristic expression in the “ epic in stone ” with which&nbsp;his column is adorned.
