<p><span class="font2">divisions of the High Court to appoint receivers. Their powers and duties are exhaustively set by Kerr, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">On Receivers</span><span class="font2"> (5th ed.,&nbsp;1905), who classifies the cases in which they may be appointed&nbsp;under the following heads: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font2"> infants; (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font2">) executors and&nbsp;trustees; (c) pending litigation as to probate; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(d)</span><span class="font2"> mortgagor&nbsp;and mortgagee; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e)</span><span class="font2"> debtor and creditor; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(f)</span><span class="font2"> public companies;&nbsp;(g) vendor and purchaser; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(h)</span><span class="font2"> covenanter and covenantee;&nbsp;(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font2">) tenant for life and remainderman; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(j)</span><span class="font2"> partners; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(k)</span><span class="font2"> lunacy;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(l)</span><span class="font2"> tenants in common; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(m)</span><span class="font2"> possession under legal title, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(n)</span><span class="font2"> other cases. The appointment of receivers is entirely within&nbsp;the discretion of the courts, and the power may be exercised “ in&nbsp;all cases in which it shall appear just and convenient.” Application for a receiver is usually made by motion, and the court&nbsp;will appoint the fittest person, without regard to who may&nbsp;propose him, the appointment of a receiver being for the benefit&nbsp;of all parties. Under the Conveyancing Act 1881, when a&nbsp;mortgagee has become entitled to exercise his powers of sale,&nbsp;he may, by writing under his hand, appoint such person as he&nbsp;think fit to be receiver. In bankruptcy practice a receiver,&nbsp;termed official receiver, is an officer of the court who in this&nbsp;capacity takes possession on the making of a receiving order,&nbsp;of all a debtor’s assets. He is also an officer of the Board of&nbsp;Trade with the duty of taking cognisance of the conduct&nbsp;of the debtor and administering his estates (see Bankruptcy).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Receiver-general is the title given to a chief receiver, more especially as applied to the collection of public revenue. The&nbsp;title survived in the Inland Revenue up to 1891, but it is now&nbsp;only used as the designation of an officer of the duchy court of&nbsp;Lancaster, who receives the revenues, &amp;c., of the duchy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RECEPT (from Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">recipere,</span><span class="font2"> to take back), a philosophical term, used by Romanes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Mental Evolution of Man,</span><span class="font2"> ii. 36, 37), on&nbsp;the analogy of “ concept and percept,” for mental images&nbsp;assumed to be produced by the simple repetition of percepts.&nbsp;The process is supposed to be the gradual elimination of elements&nbsp;in which the percepts disagree, and the emphasizing of those in&nbsp;which they agree. Thus the final residuum is a unity in differ-ence. Recepts are, in fact, “ spontaneous associations, formed&nbsp;unintentionally as what may be termed unperceived abstrac-tions,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> what are generally known as “ generic images.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RECESS (Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">recessus,</span><span class="font2"> a going back, withdrawal, from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">recedere,</span><span class="font2"> to withdraw), a term particularly used of a cessation of&nbsp;work or relief from duty, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> of the periods during the life of a&nbsp;parliament when it is not sitting. The word is also applied to&nbsp;an indentation in a line, especially of a small alcove sunk in the&nbsp;wall of a room. A particular use is the historical one for the&nbsp;acts and decrees of the Imperial Diet, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">recessus Imperii,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;also for those of the Hanseatic League. According to Du&nbsp;Cange (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s.v.</span><span class="font2"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Recessus)</span><span class="font2"> the reason for the use of this word was that&nbsp;these decrees, &amp;c. (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cοdex deliberationum),</span><span class="font2"> were written out&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">antequam a conventibus recedant proceres congregati.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RECHABITES, or Sons of Rechab, a sort of religious order among the Israehtes in some respects analogous to the Nazarites&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> with whom they shared the rule of abstinence from wine.&nbsp;They also eschewed the luxuries and pursuits of settled life, and&nbsp;lived in tents, refusing to sow grain as well as to plant vineyards.&nbsp;They represent a protest against the contemporary Canaanite&nbsp;civilization and a reaction towards the simplicity of life which&nbsp;was felt more strongly in Judah or to the east of the Jordan than&nbsp;in the northern kingdom of Israel. Their “ father,” or founder,&nbsp;was that Jehonadab or Jonadab, son of Rechab, who encouraged&nbsp;Jehu to abolish the Tyrian Baal-worship (2 Kings x.). The&nbsp;order founded by Jehonadab must from its constitution have&nbsp;soon become a sort of hereditary clan, and as such the “ house&nbsp;of Rechab ” appears in Judah after the fall of the northern&nbsp;kingdom and continued to observe the ordinance of Jehonadab&nbsp;till the approach of Nebuchadrezzar drove them for protection&nbsp;into Jerusalem (Jer. xxxv.). Jeremiah promised them as a&nbsp;reward of their obedience that they should never lack a man to&nbsp;represent them (as a priest) before Yahweh, whence perhaps the&nbsp;later Jewish tradition that the Rechabites intermarried with the&nbsp;Levites and so entered the temple service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Later references to them probably indicate that the term was used as meaning merely ascetes (Euseb., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Η. Ε.</span><span class="font0"> ii. </span><span class="font1">23), the particular&nbsp;form of asceticism </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> being less essential. One may compare&nbsp;the modern society of total abstainers known as the “ Rechabites.”&nbsp;In I</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">Chron. ii. 55 the “ house of Rechab ” is associated with the&nbsp;Kenites </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> as a family of scribes. Their origin is ascribed to&nbsp;Hammath (conceivably the Naphtalite city, Josh. xix. 35), but in&nbsp;I Chron. iv. 12 Rechab (so the LXX) is of Calebite descent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RECHBERG - ROTHENLÖWEN, JOHANN BERNHARD,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Count (1806-1899), Austrian statesman, was the second son of the Bavarian statesman Count Aloys von Rechberg-Rothenlöwen (1766-1849). Johann Bernhard was destined for the&nbsp;Bavarian public service, his elder brother being a hereditary&nbsp;member of the Upper House in the parliament of Württemberg.&nbsp;He was educated at the universities of Strassburg and Munich,&nbsp;but he incurred the displeasure of King Louis I. by the part&nbsp;he played as second in a duel, and in 1828 he transferred himself to the Austrian diplomatic service. After being attached&nbsp;to the embassies in Berlin, London and Brussels, he was appointed envoy at Stockholm (1841) and at Rio de Janeiro (1843).&nbsp;Returning to Europe in 1847, on the outbreak of the revolution of 1848 in Vienna he was of great service to Prince Metternich, whom he accompanied and assisted in his flight to England.&nbsp;In July 1848 he was appointed Austrian plenipotentiary in&nbsp;the German federal diet at Frankfort, in 1851 became Austrian&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">internuncius</span><span class="font2"> at Constantinople, and in 1853 Radetzky’s civilian&nbsp;colleague in the government of Lombardo-Venetia. In 1855&nbsp;he returned to Frankfort as Austrian representative and&nbsp;president of the federal diet. As a pupil of Metternich he would&nbsp;have wished to preserve the good understanding with Prussia&nbsp;which seemed the necessary foundation for a conservative&nbsp;policy; he was, however, made the instrument for the anti-Prussian policy of Buol; this brought about constant disputes&nbsp;with Bismarck, at that time Prussian envoy at the diet, which&nbsp;were sharpened by Rechberg’s choleric temper, and on one&nbsp;occasion nearly led to a duel. Bismarck, however, always&nbsp;expressed a high appreciation of his character and abilities. In&nbsp;May 1859, on the eve of the war with Italy, he was appointed&nbsp;Austrian minister of foreign affairs and minister president,&nbsp;surrendering the latter post to the archduke Rainer in the&nbsp;following year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The five years during which Rechberg held the portfolio of foreign affairs covered the war with Italy and France, the&nbsp;insurrection in Poland, the attempted reform of the German&nbsp;Confederation through the Frankfort </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fürstentag,</span><span class="font2"> and the&nbsp;Austro-Prussian war with Denmark. After the defeat of&nbsp;Magenta Rechberg accompanied the emperor to Italy, and he&nbsp;had to meet the crisis caused by a war for which he was not&nbsp;responsible. He began the concessions to Hungary and in the&nbsp;Polish question, and was responsible for the adhesion of Austria&nbsp;to the alliance of the Western Powers. In the German question&nbsp;Rechberg’s policy was one of compromise. To the project of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fürstentag</span><span class="font2"> he was altogether opposed. The project had&nbsp;been suggested to the emperor Francis Joseph by his son-in-law,&nbsp;the hereditary prince of Turn and Taxis, and by a pamphlet of&nbsp;Julius Fröbel, and the preliminary arrangements were made&nbsp;without Rechberg being informed. When at last he was told,&nbsp;he tendered his resignation, which was not accepted, and he&nbsp;accompanied the emperor to the abortive meeting at Frankfort&nbsp;(August 1863). The attempt made by Rechberg at the subsequent ministerial conference at Nuremberg to establish a German&nbsp;league without Prussia was equally unsuccessful, and he now&nbsp;returned to the policy, which in opposition to Schmerling he&nbsp;had throughout advocated, of a peaceful arrangement between&nbsp;Prussia and Austria as the indispensable preliminary to a reform&nbsp;of the Confederation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At this juncture the death of King Frederick VII. of Denmark (15th of November 1863) opened up the whole Schleswig-Holstein question </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font2"> In the diplomatic duel that followed&nbsp;Rechberg was no match for Bismarck. It suited Austrian&nbsp;policy to act in concert with Prussia against Denmark; but&nbsp;Rechberg well knew that Bismarck was aiming at the annexation&nbsp;of the duchies. He attempted to guard against this by laying</span></p>
