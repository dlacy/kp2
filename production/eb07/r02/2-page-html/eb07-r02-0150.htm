<p><span class="font0">pellation of Augustus, by which name he is henceforward to be known in history ; and by an unanimous vote, they&nbsp;committed to him the entire government of the state. With&nbsp;this vote ended the Roman republic ; and from this period&nbsp;was dated the commencement of the Roman empire, under&nbsp;its first undisputed sovereign, Augustus Imperator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">section hi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Augustus Cæsar now found himself possessed of the undisputed sovereignty of Rome, every competitor having perished, and the servile senate being ready to bestow upon&nbsp;him all titles, honours, and privileges which he could desire. He had before him the contrasted fates of Sylla and of&nbsp;Cæsar ; the former of whom died in peace after relinquishing the perpetual dictatorship, the latter was slain when in&nbsp;its full enjoyment. For a time, it is said, he hesitated&nbsp;whether to retire, like Sylla, into private life, or to retain&nbsp;imperial power; but by the sage advice of the politic&nbsp;Maecenas, his chief favourite, he was persuaded to retain&nbsp;it, and merely to govern under republican forms, though&nbsp;possessing a real and absolute monarchy. In consequence&nbsp;of the same advice, he laid aside the dictatorship, as too&nbsp;manifestly despotic, was annually chosen consul, and finally&nbsp;received tbe consular power in perpetuity ; and by being&nbsp;created perpetual tribune, his person was rendered sacred and inviolable, which gave a conventional security, at&nbsp;least to his life, and led to the enactment of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judicia&nbsp;majestatis,</span><span class="font0"> or accusations of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">high treason.</span><span class="font0"> As imperator&nbsp;he retained the command of all the forces ; and by assuming the censorship and the pontificate, he became possessed&nbsp;ofthe right of raising or depressing in rank, and of regulating every thing that depended upon religious ceremonies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This supreme dominion, which his own power would have enabled him to seize and perpetuate, he pretended to be&nbsp;unwilling to retain, and made an offer in the senate of laying&nbsp;it down. This they requested him not to do ; and upon&nbsp;their urgent entreaties, he consented to retain it for a&nbsp;period of ten years ; on the expiration of which, the same&nbsp;form was repeated, and a similar prolongation conferred. This example, followed by succeeding emperors, gave&nbsp;rise to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sacra decennalia,</span><span class="font0"> festivals celebrated at every&nbsp;renewal of the imperial authority. It is not necessary to&nbsp;imagine that this decree of the senate was entirely the result of slavish submission to absolute power. Many of the&nbsp;senators could still remember the horrors of those contentions&nbsp;for supremacy which had taken place in the times of Marius&nbsp;and Sylla, and of the two triumvirates, and might be really&nbsp;apprehensive of equal convulsions and bloodshed, should he&nbsp;abdicate his power, and thus re-open the sources of contention, anarchy, and bloodshed. The wiser of them might&nbsp;see, that there did not now survive enough of republican&nbsp;virtue to render a republic any longer possible, and as Augustus, after the fall of all his antagonists, had displayed a&nbsp;great degree of mildness and clemency, they might fairly&nbsp;conclude, that his government was the bcst of which Rome&nbsp;was then capable, and might therefore desire its perpetuity,&nbsp;as the best method of securing the welfare of the empire.&nbsp;On his own part, his character had begun to assume an aspect very different from what it bore at the beginning of&nbsp;his ambitious career. At that time, its chief element appeared to be cold, remorseless cruelty ; now it became mild,&nbsp;placable, benignant, alike respectful to the senate, and benevolent to the people. The truest patriot might therefore&nbsp;be most earnest in desiring the continuance of his power,&nbsp;however it might have been acquired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But while Augustus received equal manifestations of attachment from the senate and the people, he was sufficiently «ware, that to the army he owed his elevation, and that&nbsp;its favour must be secured. It could neither be disbanded nor retained in one place and body, with due&nbsp;regard to safety. Following the example of Sylla, he dispersed his veterans over Italy, settling them in thirty-two&nbsp;colonies, to make room for which, the former proprietors&nbsp;were in many instances dispossessed of their property. The&nbsp;settlement of one of these colonies near Mantua, was the&nbsp;cause of Virgil’s removal to Rome. Eight entire legions&nbsp;were posted on the Rhine, four on the Danube, three in&nbsp;Spain, and one in Dalmatia. Eight more were stationed&nbsp;in Asia and Africa. The whole standing army of tlle empire&nbsp;amounted to upwards of one hundred and seventy thousand&nbsp;men. There were also quartered in Rome and its vicinity&nbsp;twelve cohorts, amounting to about ten thousand men ;&nbsp;nine of these, called the prætorian bands, were intended&nbsp;as the imperial body-guard, the rest for the garrison of the&nbsp;city. These prætorian cohorts afterwards became not the&nbsp;guards merely, but also the dispensers of imperial power.&nbsp;Two powerful fleets were also maintained, the one in the&nbsp;Adriatic sea, the other for the protection of the western&nbsp;Mediterranean. As Augustus still allowed the senate a&nbsp;nominal share in the government, the appointment of lieutenants for the administration of affairs in some of the provinces was left to them, the others he himself retained;&nbsp;but as the imperial provinces were those on the frontiers of&nbsp;the empire, where tbe troops were stationed, the armies constituting the real power were still under his command.&nbsp;The financial affairs of Rome he also arranged anew, taking&nbsp;care to cause the treasures of the empire to flow chiefly into&nbsp;his own private and military coffers. At this period, the&nbsp;state revenue of Rome is computed to have amounted to upwards of forty millions of our money. These revenues were&nbsp;drawn chiefly from tithes charged on conquered lands, tribute and customs from provinces, crown lands, taxations&nbsp;amounting to a twentieth upon inheritances, and fines of&nbsp;different kinds imposed by different laws. Of these the tributes and customs from the provinces, and the rental of the&nbsp;crown lands, were by far the most productive, directing the&nbsp;main stream of wealth into the imperial treasury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The internal administration of affairs being thus arranged, Augustus had leisure to attend to its enlargement, by conquests on the frontier. Nor were these inconsiderable.&nbsp;Western Gaul, and the mountainous districts in the north&nbsp;of Spain, were completely subdued. An expedition into Armenia, if of little consequence in itself, was nevertheless very&nbsp;gratifying to Roman pride, by being the means of recovering from the Parthians the standards that had been lost in&nbsp;the unfortunate campaign of Crassus. In Africa, the boundaries of the empire were extended into very remote regions,&nbsp;productive however of little else but empty fame. But the&nbsp;most important of these conquests was tllat of the regions&nbsp;south of the Danube, Rhætia, the country of the Vindelici,&nbsp;and Noricum, as well as Pannonia, and afterwards Mœsia.&nbsp;The arms of Augustus could not, however, penetrate far&nbsp;into Germany, defended as it was both by the determined&nbsp;valour of its inhabitants, and by its extensive forests and&nbsp;marshes. The chief successes in Germany were ρb-tained by the valour and skill of Tiberius and Drusus Nero,&nbsp;especially the latter, sons of the empress Livia by her former&nbsp;husband. A peace being at length concluded with the Germans, and Augustus not being desirous of extending his&nbsp;dominions beyond the territories over which he had obtained complete possession, and which were comprised within&nbsp;well-defined boundaries, the world obtained repose, and&nbsp;with great rejoicing, the temple of Janus was formally closed,&nbsp;to intimate the existence of universal peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During this period of general tranquillity, when the world was at rest, and a deep calm was brooding over the nations,&nbsp;in this “ fulness ofthe times,” there w<sup>,</sup>asbomat Bethlehem&nbsp;in Judæa, of the lineage of David, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prince of Peace,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saviour of the World,</span><span class="font0"> whose coming thus brought with it</span></p>
