<p><span class="font1">is required for the successful application of definite formulae to the problem. For example, what is a safe speed at a given&nbsp;curve for an engine, truck or coach having the load equally&nbsp;distributed over the wheels may lead to either climbing or&nbsp;overturning if the load is shifted to a diagonal position. An&nbsp;ill-balanced load also exaggerates “ plunging, ” and if the period&nbsp;of oscillation of the load happens to agree with the changes&nbsp;of contour or other inequalities of the track vibrations of a&nbsp;dangerous character, giving rise to so-called “ sinuous ” motion,&nbsp;may occur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In general it is not curvature, but change of curvature, that presents difficulty in the laying-out of a line. For instance, if&nbsp;the curve is of S-form, the point of danger is when the train&nbsp;enters the contra-flexure, and it is not an easy matter to assign&nbsp;the best superelevation at all points throughout the double&nbsp;bend. Closely allied to the question of safety is the problem&nbsp;of preventing jolting at curves; and to obtain easy running it&nbsp;is necessary not merely to adjust the levels of the rails in respect&nbsp;to one another, but to tail off one curve into the next in such </span><span class="font0">a</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">manner as to avoid any approach to abrupt lateral changes of&nbsp;direction. With increase of speeds this matter has become&nbsp;important as an element of comfort in passenger traffic. As a&nbsp;first approximation, the centre-line of a railway may be plotted&nbsp;out as a number of portions of circles, with intervening straight&nbsp;tangents connecting them, when the abruptness of the changes&nbsp;of direction will depend on the radii of the circular portions.&nbsp;But if the change from straight to circular is made through the&nbsp;medium of a suitable curve it is possible to relieve the abruptness,&nbsp;even on curves of comparatively small radius. Thc smoothest&nbsp;and safest running is, in fact, attained when a “ transition, ”&nbsp;“ easement ” or “ adjustment ” curve is inserted between the&nbsp;tangent and the point of circular curvature.</span></p>

Inst. C. E.</span><span class="font0"> vol. 140, part ii.; and “ High Speed on&nbsp;Railway Curves, ” by J. W.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gauge. —</span><span class="font1">The gauge of a railway is the distance between the inner edges of the two rails upon which the wheels run.&nbsp;The width of 4 ft. 8½ in. may be regarded as standard, since it&nbsp;prevails on probably three-quarters of the railways of the&nbsp;globe. In North America, except for small industrial railways&nbsp;and some short lines for local traffic, chiefly in mountainous&nbsp;country, it has become almost universal; the long Unes of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ft. gauge have mostly been converted, or a third rail has been&nbsp;laid to permit interchange of vehicles, and the gauges of 5 ft. and&nbsp;more have disappeared. A considerable number of lines still use</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ft. 9 in., but as their rolling stock runs freely on the 4 ft. 8½ in.&nbsp;gauge and vice versa, this does not constitute a break of gauge&nbsp;for traffic purposes. The commercial importance of such free&nbsp;interchange of traffic is the controlling factor in determining&nbsp;the gauge of any new railway that is not isolated by its geographical position. In Great Britain railways are built to&nbsp;gauges other than 4 ft. 8½ in. only under exceptional conditions;&nbsp;the old “ broad gauge ” of 7 ft. which I. K. Brunel adopted for&nbsp;the Great Western railway disappeared on the 20th<sup>-</sup>23rd of&nbsp;May 1892, when the main line from London to Penzance was&nbsp;converted to standard gauge throughout its length. In Ireland&nbsp;the usual gauge is 5 ft. 3 in., but there are also lines laid to a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ft. gauge. On the continent of Europe the standard gauge is&nbsp;generally adopted, though in France there are many miles of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">4 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ft. 9 in. gauge; the normal Spanish and Portuguese gauge is,&nbsp;however, 5 ft. 5¾ in., and that of Russia 5 ft. In France and&nbsp;other European countries there is also an important mileage&nbsp;of metre gauge, and even narrower, on lines of local or secondary&nbsp;importance. In India the prevailing gauge is 5 ft. 6 in., but&nbsp;there is a large mileage of other gauges, especially metre. In&nbsp;the British colonies the prevailing gauge is 3 ft. 6 in., as in&nbsp;South Africa, Queensland, Tasmania and New Zealand; but&nbsp;in New South Wales the normal is 4 ft. 8½ in. and in Victoria</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ft. 3 in., communication between different countries of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Australian Commonwealth being thus carried on under the disadvantage of break of gauge. Though the standard gauge&nbsp;is in use in Lower Egypt, the line into the Egyptian Sudan was&nbsp;built on a gauge of 3 ft. 6. in., so that if the so-called Cape to&nbsp;Cairo railway is ever completed, there will be one gauge from&nbsp;Upper Egypt to Cape Town. In South America the 5 ft. 6 in.&nbsp;gauge is in use, with various others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mono-Rail Systems. —</span><span class="font1">The gauge may be regarded as reduced to its narrowest possible dimensions in mono-rail lines, where&nbsp;the weight of the trains is carried on a single rail. This method&nbsp;of construction, however, has been* adopted only to a very&nbsp;limited extent. In the Lartigue system the train is straddled&nbsp;over a single central rail, elevated a suitable distance above the&nbsp;ground. A short line of this kind runs from Ballybunnion to&nbsp;Listowel in Ireland, and a more ambitious project on the same&nbsp;principle, on the plans of Mr F. B. Behr, to connect Liverpool&nbsp;and Manchester, was sanctioned by Parliament in 1901. In&nbsp;this case electricity was to be the motive-power, and speeds&nbsp;exceeding 100 m. an hour were to be attained, but the line has&nbsp;not been built. In the Langen mono-rail the cars are hung from&nbsp;a single overhead rail; a line on this system works between&nbsp;Barmen and Elberfeld, about 9 m., the cars for a portion&nbsp;of the distance being suspended over the river Wupper. In&nbsp;the system devised by Mr Louis Brennan the cars run on a&nbsp;single rail laid on the ground, their stability being maintained&nbsp;by a heavy gyrostat revolving at great speed in a vacuum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Permanent Way. —</span><span class="font1">When the earth-works of a line have been completed and the tops of the embankments and the bottoms&nbsp;of the cuttings brought to the level decided upon, the next&nbsp;step is to lay the permanent way, so-called probably in distinction to the temporary way used during construction. The&nbsp;first step is to deposit a layer of ballast on the road-bed or&nbsp;“ formation, ” which often slopes away slightly on each side&nbsp;from the central fine to facilitate drainage. The ballast consists of such materials as broken stone, furnace slag, gravel,&nbsp;cinders or earth, the lower layers commonly consisting of&nbsp;coarser materials than the top ones, and its purpose is to provide&nbsp;a firm, well-drained foundation in which the sleepers or cross-ties may be embedded and held in place, and by which the&nbsp;weight of the track and the trains may be distributed over the&nbsp;road-bed. Its depth varies, according to the traffic which the&nbsp;line has to bear, from about 6 in. to 1 ft. or rather more under&nbsp;the sleepers, and the materials of the surface layers are often&nbsp;chosen so as to be more or less dustless. Its width depends&nbsp;on the numbers of tracks and their gauge; for a double line of&nbsp;standard gauge it is about 25 ft., a space of 6 ft. (“ six-foot way ”) being left between the inner rails of each pair in&nbsp;Great Britain (fig. 8), and a rather larger distance in America</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(fig. 9)<sub>j</sub> where the over-hang of the rolling stock is greater. The intervals between the sleepers are filled in level with ballast,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">which less commonly is also heaped up over them, especially at the projecting ends. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
