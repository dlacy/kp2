<p><span class="font0">endeavoured to seek the origin of this style of fiction in one of these sources alone, to the exclusion of all others, seem as&nbsp;vain as that of travellers affecting to trace the proper head of&nbsp;the Nile to various different springs, all of which are owned&nbsp;to be accessary to form the full majesty of his current.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the fashion of all things passes away, the metrical romances began gradually to decline in public estimation, pro-bablyon account of the depreciated character of the minstrels by whom they were recited. Tradition, says Ritson, is an&nbsp;alchemy, which converts gold into lead ; and there is little&nbsp;doubt, that, in passing from mouth to mouth, and from age&nbsp;to age, the most approved metrical romances became gradually corrupted by the defect of memory of some reciters and&nbsp;the interpolations of others ; since few comparatively can be&nbsp;supposed to have had recourse to the manuscripts in which&nbsp;some have been preserved. Neither were the reciters in&nbsp;the latter, as in the former times, supplied with new productions of interest and merit. The composition of the metrical romance was gradually abandoned to persons of an inferior class. The art of stringing together in loose verse a&nbsp;number of unconnected adventures, was too easy not to be&nbsp;practised by many who only succeeded to such a degree as&nbsp;was discreditable to the art, by shewing that mere mediocrity was sufficient to exercise it. And the licentious character, as well as the great number of those who, under the&nbsp;various names of glee-men, minstrels, and the like, traversed the country, and subsisted by this idle trade, brought&nbsp;themselves and their occupation into still greater contempt&nbsp;and disregard. With them, the long recitations formerly&nbsp;made at tbe tables of the great, were gradually banished into more vulgar society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But though the form of those narratives underwent a change of fashion, the appetite for the fictions themselves&nbsp;continued as ardent as ever; and the prose romances which&nbsp;succeeded, and finally superseded those composed in verse,&nbsp;had a large and permanent share of popularity. This was,&nbsp;no doubt, in a great degree owing to the important invention of printing, which has so much contributed to altcr the&nbsp;destinies of the world. The metrical romances, though in&nbsp;some instances sent to the press, were not very fit to be published in this form. The dull amplifications which passed&nbsp;well enough in the course of a half-heard recitation, became intolerable when subjected to the eye ; and the public&nbsp;taste gradually growing more fastidious as the language became more copious, and the system of manners more complicated, graces of style and variety of sentiment were demanded instead of a naked and unadorned tale of wonders.&nbsp;The authors of the prose romance endeavoured, to the best&nbsp;of their skill, to satisfy this newly awakened and more refined taste. They used, indeed, the same sources of romantic&nbsp;history which had been resorted to by their metrical predecessors; and Arthur, Charlemagne, and all their chivalry,&nbsp;were as much celebrated in prose as ever they had been in&nbsp;poetic narrative. But the new candidates for public favour&nbsp;pretended to have recourse to sources of authentic information, to which their metrical predecessors had no access.&nbsp;They refer almost always to Latin, and sometimes to Greek&nbsp;originals, which certainly had no existence ; and there is&nbsp;little doubt that the venerable names of the alleged authors&nbsp;are invented, as well as the supposed originals from which&nbsp;they are said to have translated their narratives. The following account of the discovery of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La 1res elegante délicieux melliflue et tres plaisante Hystoire du tres noble Roy&nbsp;Perceforest</span><span class="font0"> (printed at Paris in 1528 by Galliot du Pré,)&nbsp;may serve to show that modern authors were not the first&nbsp;who invented the popular mode of introducing their works&nbsp;to the world as the contents of a newly discovered manuscript. In the abridgment to which we are limitted, we&nbsp;can give but a faint picture of the minuteness with which&nbsp;the author announces his pretended discovery, and which&nbsp;forms an admirable example of the lie with a circumstance.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">In the year 1286, Count William of Hainault had, </span><span class="font1">it </span><span class="font0">is averred, crossed the seas in order to be present at the nuptials of Edward, and in the course of a tour through Britain, was hospitably entertained at an abbey situated on the&nbsp;banks of the Humber, and termed, it seems, Burtimer, because founded by a certain Burtimericus, a monarch of whom&nbsp;our annals are silent, but who had gained, in that place, a&nbsp;victory over the heathens of Germany. Here a cabinet,&nbsp;which was inclosed in a private recess, had been lately discovered within the massive walls of an ancient tower, and&nbsp;was found to contain a Grecian manuscript, along with a&nbsp;royal crown. The abbot had sent the latter to king Edward, and the Count of Hainault with difficulty obtained&nbsp;possession of the manuscript. He had it rendered from&nbsp;Greek into Latin by a monk of the abbey of Saint Lande-lain, and from that language it is said to have been translated into French by the author, who gives it to the world&nbsp;in honour of the blessed Virgin, and for the edification of&nbsp;nobleness and chivalry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By such details, the authors of the prose romances endeavoured to obtain for their works a credit for authenticity which had been denied to the rhythmical legends. But in tllis particular they did great injustice to their contemned predecessors, whose reputations they murdered in order&nbsp;to rob them with impunity. Whatever fragments or shadowings of true history may yet remain hidden under the&nbsp;mass of accumulated fable, which had been heaped on them&nbsp;during successive ages, must undoubtedly be sought in the&nbsp;metrical romances; and according to the view of the subject&nbsp;which we have already given, the more the works approach&nbsp;in point of antiquity to the period where the story is laid, the&nbsp;more are we likely to find those historical traditions in something approaching to an authentic state. But those who&nbsp;wrote under the imaginary names of Rusticien de Puise,&nbsp;Robert de Borron, and the like, usually seized upon the subject of some old minstrel ; and, recomposing the whole&nbsp;narrative after their own fashion, with additional characters&nbsp;and adventures, totally obliterated in that operation any&nbsp;shades which remained of the first, and probably authentic tradition, which was the original source of the elaborate fiction. Amplification was especially employed by&nbsp;the prose romancers, who, having once got hold of a subject,&nbsp;seem never to have parted with it until their power of invention was completely exllausted. The metrical romances, in some instances, indeed, ran to great length, but were&nbsp;much exceeded in that particular by the folios which were&nbsp;written on the same or similar topics by their prose successors. Probably the latter judiciously reflected that a book&nbsp;which addresses itself only to the eyes, may be laid aside&nbsp;when it becomes tiresome to the reader; whereas it may not&nbsp;, always have been so easy to stop the minstrel in the full&nbsp;career of his metrical declamation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Who, then, the reader may be disposed to inquire, can have been the real authors of those prolix works, who, shrouding themselves under borrowed names, derived no renown&nbsp;from their labours, if successful, and who, certainly, in the&nbsp;infant state of the press, were not rewarded with any emolument ? This question cannot, perhaps, be very satisfactorily answered ; but we may reasonably suspect that the long&nbsp;hours of leisure which the cloister permitted to its votaries,&nbsp;were often passed away in this manner ; and the conjecture is rendered more probable, when it is observed that&nbsp;matters are introduced into those works which have an especial connection with sacred history, and with the traditions&nbsp;of the Church. Thus, in the curious romance of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Huoη de&nbsp;Bourdeαux,</span><span class="font0"> a sort of second part is added to that delightful history, in which the hero visits the terrestrial paradise,&nbsp;cncounters the first murderer Cain, in the peformance of his&nbsp;penance, wfith more matter to the same purpose, not likely&nbsp;to occur to the imagination of a layman ; besides, that the&nbsp;laity of the period were in general too busy and too igno-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
