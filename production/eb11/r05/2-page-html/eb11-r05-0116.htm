<p><span class="font0">I. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Russian Empire</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Russian empire stretches over a vast territory in E. Europe and N. Asia, with an area exceeding 8,660,000 sq. m.,&nbsp;or one-sixth of the land surface of the globe (one twenty-third&nbsp;of its whole superficies). It is, however, but thinly peopled&nbsp;on the average, including only one-twelfth of the inhabitants&nbsp;of the earth. It is almost entirely confined to the cold and&nbsp;temperate zones. In Novaya Zemlya and the Taimyr peninsula,&nbsp;it projects within the Arctic Circle as far as 77° 6' and 77° 40'&nbsp;N. respectively; while its S. extremities reach 38° 50' in&nbsp;Armenia, 35° on the Afghan frontier, and 42° 30' on the&nbsp;coasts of the Pacific. To the W. it advances as far as 20° 40'&nbsp;E. in Lapland, 17° in Poland, and 29° 42' on the Black Sea;&nbsp;and its E. limit—East Cape on the Bering Strait—is in 191° E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The White, Barents and Kara Seas of the Arctic bound it on the N., and the northern Pacific—that is, the Seas of&nbsp;Bering, Okhotsk and Japan—bounds it on the E.&nbsp;The Baltic, with the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland, limits&nbsp;it on the N.W.; and two sinuous lines of land frontier&nbsp;separate it respectively from Sweden and Norway on the N.W.&nbsp;and from Prussia, Austria and Rumania on the W. On the&nbsp;S. and E. the frontier has changed frequently according to&nbsp;the expansion and contraction of the empire under the pressure&nbsp;of political exigency and expedience. The Black Sea is the&nbsp;principal demarcating feature on the S. of European Russia.&nbsp;On the W. side of that sea the S. frontier touches the Danube&nbsp;for some 120 m.; on the E. side of the same sea it zigzags&nbsp;from the Black Sea to the Caspian, utilizing the river Aras&nbsp;(Araxes) for part of the distance. As the Caspian is virtually&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">Russian sea, Persia may be said to form the next link in the&nbsp;S. boundary of the Russian empire, followed by Afghanistan.&nbsp;On the Pamirs Russia has since 1885 been conterminous with&nbsp;British India (Kashmir); but the boundary then swings away&nbsp;N. round Chinese Turkestan and the N. side of Mongolia, and,&nbsp;since 1904-5, it has skirted the N. of Manchuria, being separated&nbsp;from it by the river Amur. As thus traced, the boundary in&nbsp;Central Asia includes the two khanates of Bokhara and Khiva,&nbsp;which, though nominally protected states, are to all intents&nbsp;and purposes integral parts of the Russian empire. But it&nbsp;excludes Manchuria, with the Liao-tung peninsula and Port&nbsp;Arthur, upon which Russia only placed her grasp in 1898-99,&nbsp;a grasp which she was compelled by Japan to release after&nbsp;the war of 1904-5. The total length of the frontier line of&nbsp;the Russian empire by land is 2800 m. in Europe, and nearly&nbsp;10,000 m. in Asia, and by sea over 11,000 m. in Europe and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">between 19,000 and 20,000 m. in Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Russia has no oceanic possessions; her islands are all appendages of the mainland to which they belong. Such&nbsp;are Karlo, East Kvarken, the Aland archipelago,&nbsp;Dago, and Osel or Oesel in the Baltic Sea; Novaya</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Zemlya, with Kolguyev and Vaigach, in the Barents Sea; the Solovetski Islands in the White Sea; the New Siberian&nbsp;archipelago, Wrangel Land and Bear Islands, off the Siberian&nbsp;coast; the Commander Islands off Kamchatka; the Shan tar&nbsp;Islands and the N. of Sakhalin in the Sea of Okhotsk. The&nbsp;Aleutian archipelago was sold to the United States in 1867,&nbsp;together with Alaska, and in 1875 the Kurile Islands were ceded&nbsp;to Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the border regions, that is, two narrow belts, on the N. and S., be left out of account, a striking uniformity of physical&nbsp;feature prevails throughout the whole vast extent&nbsp;of the Russian empire. High plateaus like that of&nbsp;Pamir (the “ Roof of the World ”) and Armenia,&nbsp;and lofty mountain chains like the snow-clad Caucasus, the Alai,&nbsp;the Tian-shan, the Sayan Mountains, exist only on the out</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">skirts of the empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Viewed broadly, the Russian empire may be said to occupy the territories to the N.W. of the great plateau formation&nbsp;of the old continent—the backbone of Asia—which&nbsp;stretches with decreasing altitude and width from&nbsp;the high tableland of Tibet and Pamir to the lower&nbsp;plateaus of Mongolia, and thence N.E. through the Vitim</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">region to the farthest extremity of Asia. Thus it consists of the immense plains and flat lands which extend between&nbsp;the plateau formation and the Arctic Ocean, including the series&nbsp;of parallel chains and hilly spurs which skirt the former&nbsp;region on the N.W. And it is only to the E. of Lake Baikal&nbsp;that it climbs up on to the plateau, from which it descends&nbsp;again before it reaches the Pacific.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This plateau formation—the oldest geological continent of Asia— being unfit for agriculture, and for the most part unsuited for permanent settlement, while its oceanic slopes have from the dawn of&nbsp;history been occupied by a relatively dense population, long prevented Slav colonization from reaching the.Pacific. The Russians&nbsp;chanced to cross it in the 17th century at its narrowest and most&nbsp;N. part, and thus struck the Pacific on the foggy and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">froze n</span><span class="font1"> shores&nbsp;of the Sea of Okhotsk; but two centuries elapsed ere, after colonizing&nbsp;the depressions around Lake Baikal, they crossed over the plateau&nbsp;in a more genial zone and descended to the Pacific by the Amur.&nbsp;After that they spread rapidly S., up to the nearly uninhabited valley&nbsp;of the Usuri, to what is now the Gulf of Peter the Great. In the&nbsp;S.W. higher portions of the plateau formation the empire has only&nbsp;comparatively recently planted its foot on the Pamir, and it was&nbsp;only a few years earlier that it established itself firmly on the highlands of Armenia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A broad belt of hilly tracts—in every respect alpine in character, and displaying the same variety of climate and organic life as alpine&nbsp;tracts usually do—skirts the plateau formation throughout&nbsp;its entire length on the N. and N.W., forming an intermediate region between the plateau and the plains. .The&nbsp;Caucasus, the Elburz, the Kopet-dagh and Paropamisus,&nbsp;the intricate and imperfectly known network of mountains W. of&nbsp;the Pamir, the Tian-shan and the Ala-tau mountain regions, and&nbsp;farther N.E. the Altai, the still unnamed complex of the Minusinsk&nbsp;Mountains, the intricate mountain-chains of Sayan, with those of&nbsp;the Olekma, Vitim and Aldan all arranged </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">en échelon—</span><span class="font1">the former&nbsp;from N.W. to S.E., and the others from S.W. to N.E.—all these&nbsp;belong to the same alpine belt that borders the plateau from end to&nbsp;end of the series.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The flat lands which extend from the base of the Alpine foothills to the shores of the Arctic Ocean, assume the character either of&nbsp;dry deserts, as in the Aral-Caspian depression, or of low&nbsp;tablelands, as in central Russia and E. Siberia, of&nbsp;lacustrine regions in N.W. Russia and Finland, or of marshy&nbsp;prairies in W. Siberia, and of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tundras</span><span class="font1"> in the far N. Throughout&nbsp;the whole of this vast area, their monotonous surfaces are&nbsp;diversified by only a few, and, for the most part, low, hilly tracts.&nbsp;Recently emerged, from the Post-Pliocene sea., or freed from&nbsp;their mantle of ice, they persistently maintain the self-same&nbsp;features over immense areas; and the few portions that rise&nbsp;above the general elevation have more the character of broad and&nbsp;gentle swellings than of mountain-chains. Of this class are the&nbsp;swampy plateaus of the Kola peninsula, sloping gently S. to the&nbsp;lacustrine region of Finland and N.W.. Russia; the Valdai tablelands, where all the great rivers of Russia take their rise ; the broad&nbsp;and gently sloping meridional belt of the Ural Mountains; and&nbsp;lastly the Taimyr, Tunguzka and Verkhoyansk ranges in Siberia,&nbsp;which, notwithstanding their sub-Arctic position, do not reach the&nbsp;snow-line. The picturesque Bureya Mountains above the Amur,&nbsp;the forest-clad Sikhota-ahn on the Pacific., and the volcanic chains&nbsp;of Kamchatka belong, however, to quite another orographical&nbsp;construction, being the border-ridges of the terraces by which the&nbsp;great plateau formation descends to the depths of the Pacific Ocean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is.owing to these leading orographical features—divined by Carl Ritter, but only recently ascertained and established as fact&nbsp;by geographical research—that so many of the great&nbsp;rivers of the old continent are comprised within the limits&nbsp;of the.Russian empire. Taking their rise on the plateau formation,&nbsp;or in its outskirts, they flow first along lofty longitudinal valleys&nbsp;formerly filled with great lakes, next they cleave their way through&nbsp;the rocky barriers, and finally they enter the lowlands, where they&nbsp;become navigable, and, describing wide curves to avoid here ana&nbsp;there the minor plateaus and hilly tracts, they bring into water-communication with one another places thousands of miles apart.&nbsp;The double river-systems of the Volga and Kama, the Ob and&nbsp;Irtysh, the Angara and Yenisei,.the Lena and Vitim on the Arctic&nbsp;slope, and the Amur and Sungari on the Pacific slope, are instances.&nbsp;These were the obvious channels of Russian colonization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A broad depression—the Aral-Caspian desert—has arisen where the plateau formation reaches its greatest altitude, and at the same&nbsp;time suddenly changes its direction from N.W. to N.E. This desert&nbsp;is now filled to only, a small extent by the salt waters of the Caspian,&nbsp;Aral and Balkash inland seas; but it bears unmistakable traces of&nbsp;having been during Post-Pliocene times an immense inland basin.&nbsp;There the Volga, the Ural, the Syr-darya and the Amu-dap'a&nbsp;discharge their waters without reaching the ocean, but they bring&nbsp;life to the rapidly desiccating Transcaspian steppes, and link&nbsp;together the most remote parts of Russia.</span></p>
