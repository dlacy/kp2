<p><span class="font0">of Holden that prompted him to begin the study of the Italian language, in which he at length attained to so great&nbsp;proficiency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He thus continued to improve his taste, and to enlarge his fund of knowledge. From a fervent admiration of&nbsp;poetry there is generally an easy transition to the composition of poems. He wrote many verses in his early youth ;&nbsp;and at the age of twenty, he printed an Ode on the Foundation of a Society for the Encouragement of the Arts of&nbsp;Painting and Design, in the town of Liverpool. About the&nbsp;same period he wrote a descriptive poem, entitled Mount&nbsp;Pleasant, which was not however published till the year&nbsp;1777. His ode was then reprinted. These poems were&nbsp;favourably received ; and they obtained the approbation of&nbsp;two very competent judges, Mr Mason and Sir Joshua Reynolds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having completed his clerkship, he was in 1774 admitted an attorney of the Court of King’s Bench. During the same year, he entered into partnership with a Mr Bannister,&nbsp;but their connexion was of a very short duration. He&nbsp;afterwards formed a more permanent engagement with&nbsp;Mr Samuel Aspinall, who had long been known as a respectable practitioner. He was assiduous in his attention&nbsp;to the business of his profession ; but he did not find himself constrained to abandon his literary studies, and he&nbsp;thus continued the gradual improvement of his excellent&nbsp;talents. At an early period of his life, he became intimately acquainted with the family of a respectable tradesman named Griffies. Jane, the second of three daughters,&nbsp;“ soon attracted his admiration, and won his affection, by&nbsp;her gentle yet lively manners, by the sweetness of her disposition, and by the many admirable qualities of her truly feminine mind. Although the state of his circumstances at&nbsp;this time gave little promise of an immediate union with the&nbsp;object of his attachment, it was not the wish, and perhaps it&nbsp;was scarcely in the power, of one possessing the frank and&nbsp;ardent character of Mr Roscoe, to conceal from her the&nbsp;feelings she had inspired. From that moment, to the close&nbsp;of his long and eventful life, he never found reason to regret, for one instant, the judgment of his youth.” A considerable interval elapsed before they could prudently fulfil their engagement ; but his professional emoluments gradually became more ample, and they were married on the&nbsp;22d of February 1781. Their union was attended with&nbsp;more than common felicity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The African slave-trade was now in its fullest vigour ; hnd as it formed a very material part of the commerce of&nbsp;.Liverpool, the great body of the inhabitants were interested, either directly or indirectly, in the continuance of this&nbsp;detestable traffic. For any individual to raise a warning&nbsp;voice against it in such a community, required no small&nbsp;portion of moral courage. The generous feelings and&nbsp;manly character of Mr Roscoe urged him to take a very&nbsp;prominent share in those proceedings which finally led&nbsp;to its suppression ; a measure which reflected so much&nbsp;honour on that administration which included Fox, Grey,&nbsp;Holland, and Erskine. He composed, in blank verse, a&nbsp;poem entitled “ The Wrongs of Africa ;” of which the first&nbsp;part was published in 1787, and the second in 1788. It&nbsp;was translated into German by a clergyman named Kiihn.&nbsp;In 1787 he likewise published “ A general View of the&nbsp;African Slave Trade, demonstrating its Injustice and Impolicy : with Hints towards a Bill for its Abolition.” This&nbsp;seasonable tract was followed in 1788 by “ A Scriptural&nbsp;Refutation of a Pamphlet lately published by the Rev.&nbsp;Raymond Harris, entitled ‘ Scriptural Researches on the&nbsp;Licitness of the Slave Trade’: in four Letters from the Author to a Friend.” Harris was a clergyman of the established church, but had been educated for the popish&nbsp;priesthood. Such talents as he possessed were employed&nbsp;in an attempt to prove that slavery, as a system, has ob</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">tained the divine approval ; that God has sanctioned the principle of one portion of mankind treating another like&nbsp;beasts of burden. For his satisfactory refutation of this reverend apologist of such enormities, Mr Roscoe received&nbsp;the thanks of the London Abolition Committee. They&nbsp;likewise printed a new edition of his pamphlet, which was&nbsp;extensively circulated, and highly approved. In 1792 he&nbsp;published “ An Inquiry into the Causes of the Insurrection&nbsp;of the Negroes in the Island of St Domingo.” Of this&nbsp;insurrection the advocates of slavery had endeavoured to&nbsp;avail themselves, as a most powerful argument against the&nbsp;abolition ; and he therefore performed another important&nbsp;service by exposing the fallacies of their reasonings and&nbsp;inferences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In other public transactions of that eventful period, he likewise felt a deep interest. On all subjects his sentiments were humane and liberal. With some of the most&nbsp;enlightened men of the kingdom, he contemplated the&nbsp;French revolution as a glorious event ; and his feelings of&nbsp;exultation were expressed in more than one poetical effusion. The atrocities which ensued were revolting to every&nbsp;well-constituted mind : but he still continued true to the&nbsp;great cause of civil and religious liberty, and in the midst&nbsp;of the apostacy of one party, and the phrensy of another,&nbsp;he continued to avow and to maintain those principles&nbsp;which established, and which alone can uphold the British&nbsp;constitution. The most conspicuous apostate of that period was Edmund Burke, who deserted his former principles and his former friends, and made a general declaration&nbsp;of war against all those who breathed an ardent wish for&nbsp;the political or social melioration of mankind. The powers&nbsp;of his eloquence were exerted, with a morbid and phren-sied fervour, against those who differed from him after he&nbsp;began to differ from himself; and when we consider that&nbsp;he was instrumental, beyond any other individual, in promoting war abroad, and despotism at home, it may without&nbsp;any breach of charity be affirmed, that his memory deserves&nbsp;the execration of posterity. In the year 1796 Roscoe published “ Strictures on Mr Burke’s Two Letters, addressed&nbsp;to a Member of the present Parliament.” Here he animadverts on the exaggerated statements of his adversary, and&nbsp;exposes the real object of his recent publications, the suppression of all liberal and independent speculation on the&nbsp;subject of politics. This famous orator was evidently disposed to acquiesce in the opinion of Bishop Horsley, that&nbsp;the people have nothing to do with the laws but to obey&nbsp;them. At an earlier period, 1791, Roscoe had printed a&nbsp;merry ballad concerning “ The Life, Death, and wonderful Achievements of Edmund Burke ;” and had adorned it&nbsp;with a frontispiece etched by himself, and representing&nbsp;Burke equipped like a knight-errant, and assaulting Fox in&nbsp;the House of Commons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About this period his mind was vigorously devoted to an undertaking of a more important nature. The plan of preparing a biographical account of Lorenzo de’ Medici had&nbsp;occurred to him at a very early stage of his literary career.&nbsp;He long continued to collect books, and to amass materials ; and at the close of the year 1789, he communicated&nbsp;his design to his intimate friend Mr Clarke, who was then&nbsp;residing in Italy for the benefit of a milder climate. This&nbsp;gentleman had been engaged in commercial pursuits, but&nbsp;is said to have been skilled in ancient as well as modern literature. With great alacrity he undertook the task of&nbsp;exploring the archives and libraries of Florence, in quest&nbsp;of materials for the projected work ; and the author ac-knowjedged himself deeply indebted to the assistance which&nbsp;he had thus received. The sale of the Crevenna and Pi-nelli libraries enabled him to procure many rare books, for&nbsp;which he might otherwise have made a hopeless search.&nbsp;“ The Life of Lorenzo de Medici, called the Magnificent,”&nbsp;was at length published in the year 1796, in two volumes</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
