<p><span class="font0">and reactionary attempts, and so many conflicting elections that in 1045 three popes were struggling for the tiara in the&nbsp;midst of scandal and anarchy. The streets and neighbourhood&nbsp;of Rome swarmed with thieves and assassins; pilgrims were&nbsp;plundered; citizens trembled for their lives; and a hundred&nbsp;petty barons threatened the rival popes, who were obliged to&nbsp;defend themselves by force. This state of things lasted until&nbsp;Henry III. came to re-establish order. He appointed a synod&nbsp;to depose the three popes, and then, with the consent of the&nbsp;wearied and anarchy-stricken Romans, assuming the right&nbsp;of election, proposed a German, Clement II., who was consecrated at Christmas 1046. Henry III. was then crowned,&nbsp;and also took the title of patrician. Thus the emperor was&nbsp;lord over church and state. This, however, stirred both&nbsp;people and pope against him, and led to the terrible contest&nbsp;of the investitures, although for the moment the Romans,&nbsp;being exhausted by past calamities, seemed not only resigned&nbsp;but contented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In fact, the idea of reform and independence was already germinating in the church and was soon to become tenacious&nbsp;and irresistible. Hildebrand was the prompter and&nbsp;hero of this idea. He sought to abolish the simony&nbsp;and concubinage of the priesthood, to give the papal&nbsp;elections into the hands of the higher ecclesiastics,&nbsp;and to emancipate the church from all dependence&nbsp;on the empire. Henry III. procured the election of four&nbsp;German popes in succession, and Hildebrand was always at&nbsp;hand to inspire their actions and dominate them by his&nbsp;strength of intellect and still greater strength of will. But&nbsp;the fourth German pope, Victor II,, died in 1057, and Henry III.&nbsp;had been succeeded in 1056 by the young Henry IV. under&nbsp;the regency of a weak woman, the empress Agnes. Hildebrand&nbsp;seized this favourable moment for trying his strength and&nbsp;procured the election of Stephen IX. (1057-58), a candidate&nbsp;he had long had in view. Stephen, however, died in 1058;&nbsp;the nobles instantly rose in rebellion; and Gregory of Tusculum,&nbsp;who had assumed the patriciate, caused an incapable cousin&nbsp;to be named pope (Benedict X.). Upon this Hildebrand&nbsp;postponed his design of maintaining the papacy by the help&nbsp;of Italian potentates and had recourse to the empress. In a&nbsp;synod held at Siena with her consent Benedict was deposed&nbsp;and Nicholas II. (1059-61) elected in his stead. This pope&nbsp;entered Rome escorted by the troops of Godfrey of Tuscany,&nbsp;and, when also assured of help from Naples, assembled a&nbsp;council of one hundred and thirteen bishops (1059), who condemned the deposed pontiff and renewed the prohibition of&nbsp;simony and concubinage among the priesthood. Finally&nbsp;Nicholas instituted the college of cardinals, entrusting it with&nbsp;the election of the pope, who was in future to be chosen from&nbsp;its ranks. The assent of the clergy and people was left purely&nbsp;formal. The decree also contained the proviso—“ saving the&nbsp;honour and reverence due to the emperor but this too was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">an empty expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The new decree was a master-stroke of Hildebrand’s genius, for by means of it he placed the papal election in the hands&nbsp;of a genuine ecclesiastical senate and gave a monarchical form&nbsp;to the church. Backed by the Normans who were in Rome,&nbsp;and whose commander, Richard of Capua, did not scruple to&nbsp;strike off the heads of many recalcitrant nobles, Hildebrand&nbsp;and the pope could now pursue their work of reform. Nevertheless the nobles again revolted on the death of Nicholas II.&nbsp;in 1061, and declared their purpose of restoring to Henry IV.&nbsp;the patriciate and right of election; but Hildebrand, by&nbsp;speedily convoking the cardinals, procured the election of&nbsp;Alexander II. (1061-73). This pope, although friendly to&nbsp;the empire, did not await the imperial sanction, but, protected&nbsp;by the Romans, at once entered the Lateran and put some&nbsp;other riotous nobles to death. The German bishops, however,&nbsp;elected Honorius II., who had the support of the barons. Thus&nbsp;the city was split into two camps and a deadly civil war ensued,&nbsp;terminating, despite the vigorous resistance of the nobility,&nbsp;in the defeat of Honorius II. But the nobles persevered in&nbsp;the contest and were the real masters of Rome. By conferring&nbsp;the patriciate on the emperor, as their feudal chief, they&nbsp;hoped to organize themselves under the prefect, who now,&nbsp;with greatly increased authority, presided over both the&nbsp;civil and criminal courts in the absence of the pope’s&nbsp;representative. In a general assembly the Romans elected&nbsp;their prefect, whose investiture was granted by the emperor,&nbsp;while the pope elected another. Thus disorder was brought&nbsp;to a climax.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alexander died on the 21st April 1073, and thereupon Hildebrand was at last raised to the chair as pope Gregory VII. (1073-85). He reconfirmed his predecessors’ decrees,&nbsp;dismissed all simoniacal and non-celibate priests,&nbsp;and then in a second council (1075) forbade the clergy&nbsp;to receive investiture at the hands of laymen. No bishop&nbsp;nor abbot was again to accept ring or crozier from king or&nbsp;emperor. Now, as ecclesiastical dignities included the possession&nbsp;of extensive benefices, privileges and feudal rights, this decree&nbsp;gave rise to tremendous dispute and to fierce contest between&nbsp;the empire and the church. The nobles took a very decided&nbsp;part in the struggle. With Cenci, their former prefect, at their&nbsp;head, they rose in revolt, assailed the pope on Christmas day&nbsp;1075, and threw him into prison. But their fear of the popular&nbsp;wrath compelled his speedy release; and he then decreed the&nbsp;excommunication and deposition of the emperor who had&nbsp;declared him deposed. That monarch afterwards made&nbsp;submission to Gregory at Canossa (1077), but, again turning&nbsp;against him, was again excommunicated. And in 1081 he&nbsp;returned to Italy bringing the antipope Clement III., and&nbsp;besieged Rome for forty days. Assembling the nobles in&nbsp;his camp, he there arranged a new government of the city&nbsp;with prefect and senate, palatine judges and other magistrates,&nbsp;exactly similar to the existing government within the walls.&nbsp;He then took his departure, returned several times in vain,&nbsp;but at last forced his way into the city (March 1084) and&nbsp;compelled Gregory VII. to seek refuge in the castle of St&nbsp;Angelo. The emperor was then master of Rome, established&nbsp;the government he had previously arranged and, calling a&nbsp;parliament of nobles and bishops, procured the deposition of&nbsp;Gregory and the consecration of Clement III., by whom he&nbsp;was crowned in 1084. He then attacked and seized the&nbsp;Capitol, and assaulted the castle in order to capture the pope.&nbsp;But Robert Guiscard brought his army to the rescue. Emperor&nbsp;and antipope fled; the city was taken, the pope liberated ^and&nbsp;Rome reduced to ruin by fire and pillage. Upon this Gregory&nbsp;VII., broken with grief, went away with the Normans, and&nbsp;died at Salerno on the 25th May 1085. He had separated&nbsp;the church from the people and the empire by a struggle that,&nbsp;as Gregoroxius says, disturbed the deep sleep of the middle&nbsp;ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pope Paschal II. (1099-1118) found himself entirely at the mercy of the tyrannous nobles who were alike masters of Rome,&nbsp;of its government, and its spiritual lord. As they&nbsp;were divided among themselves, all the pope could&nbsp;do was to side with one party in order to overcome&nbsp;the other. With the help of his own nephew Gualfredo, the&nbsp;prefect Pietro Pierleone, and the Frangipani, he was able to&nbsp;keep down the Corsi, and hold the Colonna in check. Being&nbsp;compelled to repair to Benevento in 1108, he left Gualfredo&nbsp;to command the militia, Tolomeo of Tusculum to guard the&nbsp;Campagna, and the consuls Pierleone and Leone Frangipani,&nbsp;together with the prefect, in charge of the government. The&nbsp;consulship was no longer a mere title of honour. The consuls&nbsp;seem to have been elected, as at Ravenna, in imitation of those&nbsp;of the Lombard cities, and were at the head of the nobles and&nbsp;senate. The expressions “ praefectus et consulcs,” “ dc sena-toribus et consulibus,” are now of frequent occurrence. Wc&nbsp;have no precise knowledge of the political organization of the&nbsp;city at this moment; but it was an aristocratic government,&nbsp;similar to that originally formed in Florence, as Villani tells&nbsp;us, with a senate and consuls. The nobles were so completely&nbsp;the masters that the pope, in spite of having trusted them</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
