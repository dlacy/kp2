<p><span class="font1">feeling, yet he alone among the elegiac poets is able to embody it in dramatic form, and by his vivid gifts of fancy&nbsp;to create a literature of romantic passion and adventure&nbsp;adapted to amuse and fascinate the idle and luxurious&nbsp;society of which the elder Julia was the centre. The power&nbsp;of continuous narrative is best seen in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Metamorphoses,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">written in hexameters, to which he has imparted a rapidity&nbsp;and fluidity of movement more suited to romantic and picturesque narrative than the weighty self-restrained verse&nbsp;of Virgil. In his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fasti</span><span class="font1"> he treats a subject of national&nbsp;interest; it is not, however, through the strength of Roman&nbsp;sentiment but through the power of vividly conceiving&nbsp;and narrating stories of strong human interest that the&nbsp;poem lives. In his latest works—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tristia</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ex&nbsp;Ponto—</span><span class="font1">he imparts the interest of personal confessions to&nbsp;the record of a unique experience. Latin poetry is more&nbsp;rich in the expression of personal feeling than of dramatic&nbsp;imagination. In Ovid we have both. We know him in&nbsp;the intense liveliness of his feeling and the human weakness of his nature more intimately than any other writer&nbsp;of antiquity, except perhaps Cicero. As Virgil marks the&nbsp;point of maturest excellence in poetic diction and rhythm,&nbsp;Ovid marks that of the greatest facility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Augustan age was one of those great eras in the world, like the era succeeding the Persian War in Greece,&nbsp;the Elizabethan age in England, and the beginning of the&nbsp;present century in Europe, in which what seems a new&nbsp;spring of national and individual life calls out an idealizing&nbsp;retrospect of the past. As the present seems full of new&nbsp;life, the past seems rich in glory and the future in hope.&nbsp;The past of Rome had always a peculiar fascination for&nbsp;Roman writers. Virgil in a supreme degree, and Horace,&nbsp;Propertius, and Ovid in a less degree, had expressed in&nbsp;their poetry the romance of the past. But it was in the&nbsp;great historical work of Livy (59 </span><span class="font0">B.C.-17 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.) that the&nbsp;record of the national life, coloured by idealizing retrospect, received its most systematic exposition. The conception of his work must have nearly coincided in point&nbsp;of time with the impulses in which the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jEneid</span><span class="font1"> and the&nbsp;national </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Odes</span><span class="font1"> of Horace had their origin. Its execution&nbsp;was the work of a life prolonged through the languor and&nbsp;dissolution following so soon upon the promise of the new&nbsp;era, during which time the past became glorified by contrast with the disheartening aspect of the present. The&nbsp;value of the work consists not in any power of critical investigation or weighing of historical evidence but in the&nbsp;intense sympathy of the writer with the national ideal, and&nbsp;the vivid imagination with which under the influence of&nbsp;this sympathy he gives life to the events and personages,&nbsp;the wars and political struggles, of times remote from his&nbsp;own. Although he has no accurate conception of the constitutional history of the state, yet nowhere else in ancient&nbsp;history do we find the patrician and plebeian forces in a&nbsp;state by which that history is worked out so vividly and&nbsp;dramatically embodied. He makes us feel more than any&nbsp;one the majesty of the Roman state, of its great magistracies, and of the august council by which its policy was&nbsp;guided. And, while he makes the words “ senatus popu-lusque Romanus ” full of significance for all times, no one&nbsp;realizes with more enthusiasm all that is implied in the&nbsp;words “imperium Romanum,” and the great military qualities of head and heart by which that empire was acquired&nbsp;and maintained. While the general conception of his work&nbsp;is thus animated by national enthusiasm, the details are&nbsp;filled up with all the resources of a vivid imagination and&nbsp;of literary art. The vast scale on which the work was&nbsp;conceived and the thoroughness of artistic execution with&nbsp;which the details are finished are characteristically Roman.&nbsp;The prose style of Rome, as a vehicle for the continuous&nbsp;narration of events coloured by a rich and picturesque&nbsp;imagination and vivified by dignified emotion, attained its&nbsp;perfection in him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fourth Period : from</span><span class="font1"> 17 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">to about</span><span class="font1"> 130 A.D.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For more than a century after the death of Augustus Roman literature continues to flow in the old channels.&nbsp;Rome continues the centre of the literary movement. The&nbsp;characteristics of the great writers are essentially national,&nbsp;not provincial nor cosmopolitan. In prose the old forms&nbsp;—oratory, history, the epistle, treatises or dialogues on&nbsp;ethical and literary questions—continue to be cultivated.&nbsp;Scientific and practical subjects, such as natural history,&nbsp;architecture, medicine, agriculture, are treated in more&nbsp;elaborate literary style. The old Roman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">satura</span><span class="font1"> is developed into something like the modern prose novel. In the&nbsp;various provinces of poetry, while there is little novelty or&nbsp;inspiration, there is abundance of industry and ambitious&nbsp;effort. The national love of works of large compass shows&nbsp;itself in the production of long epic poems, both of the&nbsp;historic and of the imitative Alexandrian type. Out of&nbsp;many others four of these have been preserved, two at&nbsp;least of which the world might have allowed to perish&nbsp;without sensible diminution to its literary wealth. The&nbsp;imitative and rhetorical tastes of Rome showed themselves&nbsp;in the composition of exotic tragedies, as remote in spirit&nbsp;and character from Greek as from Roman life, of which&nbsp;the only extant specimens are those attributed to the&nbsp;younger Seneca. The composition of didactic, lyrical, and&nbsp;elegiac poetry also was the accomplishment and pastime of&nbsp;an educated dilettante class. The only extant specimens&nbsp;of any interest are some of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Silvse</span><span class="font1"> of Statius. The only&nbsp;voice with which the poet of this age can express himself&nbsp;with force and sincerity is that of satire and satiric epigram. Ovid was the last of the true poets of Rome who&nbsp;combined idealizing power of imagination with artistic&nbsp;originality. After him we find only imitative echoes of&nbsp;the old music created by Virgil and others, as in Statius,&nbsp;or powerful declamation, as in Lucan and Juvenal. There&nbsp;is a deterioration in the diction as well as in the music of&nbsp;poetry. The elaborate literary culture of the Augustan&nbsp;age has done something to impair the native force of the&nbsp;Latin idiom. The language of literature, in the most&nbsp;elaborate kind of prose as well as poetry, loses all ring of&nbsp;popular speech. The old oratorical tastes and aptitudes&nbsp;find their outlet in public recitations and the practice of&nbsp;declamation. Forced and distorted expression, exaggerated emphasis, point and antithesis, an affected prettiness,&nbsp;“melliti verborum globuli,” were studied with the view&nbsp;of gaining the applause of audiences who thronged the&nbsp;lecture and recitation rooms in search of temporary excitement. Education was more widely diffused, but was less&nbsp;thorough, less leisurely in its method, less than before derived from the purer sources of culture. The precocious&nbsp;immaturity of Lucan’s career affords a marked contrast to&nbsp;the long preparation of Virgil and Horace for their high&nbsp;office. Although there are some works of the Silver Age of&nbsp;considerable and one at least of supreme interest, from&nbsp;the insight they afford into the experience of a century of&nbsp;organized despotism and its effect on the spiritual life of&nbsp;the ancient world, it cannot be doubted that the steady&nbsp;literary decline which characterized the last centuries of&nbsp;paganism begins with the death of Ovid and Livy. If&nbsp;the world had not altogether ceased to produce men of&nbsp;genius, the conditions under which their genius could unfold&nbsp;itself were no longer the same. The influences which had&nbsp;inspired the republican and Augustan literature were the&nbsp;artistic impulse derived from a familiarity with the great&nbsp;works of Greek genius, becoming more intimate with every&nbsp;new generation, the spell of Rome over the imagination of&nbsp;the kindred Italian races, the charm of Italy, and the vivid</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
