In the mean time, the archers, diſeharging ſhowers of darts from the towers, wounded ſeveral of the Romans in that confuſion, while others were trod to death by the elephants. Notwithſtanding the diſorder of the cavalry, the legionaries ſtill kept their ranks, and could not be broken, till Pyrrhus attacked them in perſon at the head of the Theſſalian horſe. The onſet was ſo furious, that they were' forced to yield, and retire in diſorder. The king of Epirus reſtrained the ardour of his troops, and would not ſuffer them to purſeie the enemy ; an elephant, which had been wounded by a Roman ſoldier named <hi rend="italic">Minucius, </hi>having cauſed a great diſorder in his army, this accident favoured the retreat of the Romans, and gave them time to repaſs the river, and take refuge in Apulia. The Epirot remained maſter of the field, and had the pleaſure to ſee the Romans fly before him : but the victory coſt him dear, a great number of his beſt officers and ſoldiers having been ſlain in the battle ; whence he was heard to ſay after the action, that he was both conqueror and conquered, and that if he gained ſuch another victory, lie ſhould be obliged to return to Epirus alone.</p><p>His firſt care after the action was to bury the dead, with which the plain was covered ; and herein he ιn⅜c no diſtinction between the Romans and his own Epirots. In viewing the bodies of the former, he obſerved, that none of them had received diſhonourable wounds ; that they had all fallen in the polls aſſigned them, ſtill held their ſwords in their hands, and ſhowed, even after death, a certain martial air and ſierce-neſs in their faces ; and on this occaſion it was that he uttered thoſe famous words : “ O that Pyrrhus had the Romans for his ſoldiers, or the Romans Pyrrhus ſor their leader ! together, we ſhould ſubdue the whole world.”</p><p>The king of Epirus underſtood the art of war too well not to reap what advantage he could from his victory. He broke into the countries in alliance with the Romans, plundered the lands of the republic, and made incurſions even into the neighbourhood of Rome. Many cities opened their gates to him, and in a ſhort time he made himſelf maſter of the greateſt part of Campania. While he was in that fruitful province, ſubſiſting his troops there at the expence of the Romans, he was joined by the Samnites, Lucanians, and Meſſapians, whom he had ſo long expected. After having reproached them ſor their delay, he gave them a good ſhare of the ſpoils he had taken from the enemy ; and having by this means gained their affections, he marched without loſs of time to lay ſiege to Capua : but Lævinus, having already received a reinforcement of two legions, threw ſome troops into the city ; which obliged Pyrrhus to drop his deſign, and, leaving Capua, to march ſtraight to Naples Lævinus followed him, ha raffing his troops on their march ; and at length, by keeping his army in the neighbourhood, forced him to give over all thoughts of making himſelf maſter of that important city. The king then, all on a ſudden, took his route towards Rome by the Latin way, ſurpriſed Fregellæ, and, marching through the country of the Hernici, ſat down before Piænefte. There, from the top of an hill, he had the pleaſure of ſeeing Rome j and is ſaid to have advanced ſo near the walls, that he drove a cloud of duſt into the city. But he was ſoon forced to retire by the other conſul T. Coruncanius, who, having reduced Hetruria, was juſt then returned with his victorious army to Rome. The king of Epirus, therefore, having no hopes of bringing the Hetrurians into his intereſt, and ſeeing two conſular armies ready to fall upon him, raiſed the ſiege of Præneite, and haſtened back into Campania ; where, to his great ſurpriſe, lie found Lævinus with a more numerous army than that which he had defeated on the banks of the Siris. The conſul went to meet him, with a deſign to try the fate of another battle ; which Pyrrhus being unwilling to decline, drew up his army, and, to ſtrike terror into the Roman legions, ordered his men to beat their bucklers with their lances, and the leaders of the elephants to force them to make a hideous noiſe. But the noiſe was returned with ſuch an univerſal ſhout by the Romans, that Pyrrhus, thinking ſo much alacrity on the part of the vanquiſhed too ſure a prognoſtic of victory, altered his mind ; and, pretending that the auguries were not favourable, retired to Tarentum, and put an end to the campaign.</p><p>While Pyrrhus continued quiet at Tarentum, he had time to reflect on the valour and conduct of the Romans ; which made him conclude, that the war in which he was engaged muſt end in his ruin and diſgrace, if not terminated by an advantageous peace. He was therefore overjoyed when he heard that the ſenate had determined to ſend an honourable embaſſy to him, not doubting but their errand' was to propoſe terms of peace. The ambaſſadors were three men of diſtinguiſhed merit ; to wit, Cornelius Dolabella, who was famous for the ſignal victory he had gained over the Senones, Fabrſeius, and Æmilius Pappus, who had been his colleague in the conſulate two years before. When they were admitted to an audience, the only thing they iſemanded was a ſurrender of the priſoners, either by the way of exchange, or at ſuch a ranſom as ſhould be agreed on ; ſor Pyrrhus, in the late battle, had made 1800 priſoners, moſt of them Roman knights and men of diſtinction in the republic. They had ſought with great bravery, till their horſes, frightened with the roaring of the king’s elephants, had either thrown them, or obliged them to diſmount ; by which unforeſeen accident they had fallen into the enemy’s hands. The ſenate, therefore, pitying the condition of thoſe brave men, had determined, contrary to their cuſtom, to redeem them. Pyrrhus was greatly ſurpriſed and diſappointed when he found that they had no other propoſals to make ; but, concealing his thoughts, he only anſwered, that he would, conſider of it, and let them know his reſolution. Accordingly, he aſſembled his council : but his chief <hi rend="italic">favourites</hi>  were divided in their opinions. Milo, who commanded in the citadel of Tarentum, was ſor coming to no compoſition with the Romans ; but Cy-neas, who knew his matter’s inclination, propoſed not only ſending back the priſoners without ranſem, but diipatching an embaſſy to Rome to treat with the ſenate of a laſting peace. His advice was approved, and he himſelf appointed to go on that embaſſy. After theſe reſolutions, the king acquainted the ambaſſadors, that he intended to releaſe the priſoners without ranſom, ſince he had already riches enough, and de-</p></body></text></TEI>
