<p><label>RESORCIN</label>
(meta-dioxy benzene), CeIL(OH) <hi rend="sub">2</hi> , one of the dihydric phenols. It is obtained on fusing many, resins (galbanum, asafoetida, &amp;c.) with caustic potash, or by the distillation of Brazil-wood extract. It may be prepared synthetically by fusing meta-iodophenol, phenol meta-sulphonic acid, and benzene meta-disulphonic acid with potash; by the action of nitrous acid on meta-aminophenol; or by the action of 10% hydrochloric acid on meta-phenylene diamine (J. Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Ber.,</hi> 1897, 30, p. 2569). Many ortho and para-compounds of the aromatic series (for example, the brom-phenols, benzene para-disulphonic acid) also yield resorcin on fusion with caustic potash. It crystallizes from benzene in colourless needles which melt at 119° C. and boil at 276-5° C. (L. Calderon), or 280° C. (C. Graebe), and is readily soluble in water, alcohol and ether, but insoluble in chloroform and carbon bisulphide. It reduces Fehling’s solution, and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, as the isomeric pyrocatechin does. Ferric chloride colours its aqueous solution a dark violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromresorcin. Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when heated to 150-160° C. with concentrated baryta solution gives 7-acetylbutyric acid (D. Vorländer); when fused with caustic potash, resorcin yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechin and diresorcin. It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, in the presence of dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> with zinc chloride and glacial acetic acid at 145° C. it yields resacetophenone (HO) <hi rend="sub">2</hi> C <hi rend="sub">e</hi> H <hi rend="sub">3</hi> -CO-CH <hi rend="sub">3</hi> (M. Nencki and N. Sieber, <hi rend="italic">Jour. prak. Chem.,</hi> 1881 [2], 23, p. 147). With the anhydrides of dibasic acids it yields fluoresceins <hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> When heated with calcium chloride-ammonia to 200° C. it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine (A. Seyewitz, <hi rend="italic">Bull. Soc. Chirn.,</hi> 1890 [3], 3, p. 811). With sodium nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Iacmoid</hi></p>

It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the addition ot a little hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin [(HO) <hi rend="sub">2</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">-C <hi rend="sub">6</hi> HjI <hi rend="sub">2</hi></hi> -CH <hi rend="sub">2</hi> , whilst with chloral hydrate, in the presence of potassium bisulphate, it yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl methane carboxylic acid (J. T. Hewitt and F. G. Pope, <hi rend="italic">Jour. Chem. Soc.,</hi> 1897, 71, p. 1084). In alcoholic solution it cou-denses with sodium acetoacetate to form ß-methylumbelliferone, Ci <hi rend="sub">0</hi> H <hi rend="sub">8</hi> O <hi rend="sub">3</hi> (A. Michael, <hi rend="italic">Jour. prak. Chem.,</hi> 1888 [2], 37, 470). With concentrated nitric acid, in the presence of cold concentrated sulphuric acid, it yields <hi rend="italic">trinitro-resorcin (styphnic acid),</hi> which forms yellow crystals, exploding violently on rapid heating.</p><p>In medicine, resorcin, which is official in the United States under the name of resorcinol, was formerly used as an antipyretic, but it has been given up. The dose is 2 to 8 grs. Used externally it is an antiseptic and disinfectant, and is used 5 to 10% in ointments in the treatment of chronic skin diseases such as psoriasis and eczema of a sub-acute character. Weak, watery solutions of resorcin (ro or 15 grs. to the ounce) are useful in allaying the itching in erythematous eczema. A 2% solution used as a spray has been used with marked effect in hay fever and in whooping-cough. In the latter disease 10 minims of the 2% solution has been given internally. It has also been employed in the treatment of gastric ulcer in doses of 2 to 4 grs. in pill, and is said to be analgesic and haemostatic in its action. In large doses it is a poison causing giddiness, deafness, salivation, sweating and convulsions. It is also worked up in certain medicated soaps. Mono-acetyl resorcin, C <hi rend="sub">e</hi> H <hi rend="sub">4</hi> (OH)-O-COCH <hi rend="sub">3</hi> , is used under the name of “ euresol.”</p><p><hi rend="italic">Resazurin,</hi> C12H7NO4, obtained by the action of nitrous acid on resorcin (P. Weselsky and R. Benedikt, <hi rend="italic">Monats.,</hi> 1880, I, p. 889), forms small dark red crystals possessing a greenish metallic glance. When dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid and warmed to 210° C., the solution on pouring into water yields a precipitate of <hi rend="italic">resorufin,</hi> Ci <hi rend="sub">2</hi> H <hi rend="sub">7</hi> NO3, an Oxypnenoxazone, which is insoluble in water, but is readily soluble in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid, and in solutions of caustic alkalis.
