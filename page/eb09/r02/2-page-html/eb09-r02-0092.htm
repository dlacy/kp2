<p><span class="font1">RIBAULT, or Ribaut, Jean (c. 1520-1565), a French navigator rendered famous by his connexion with the&nbsp;early settlement of Florida </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(qrv.),</span><span class="font1"> was born at Dieppe,&nbsp;probably about 1520. Appointed by Coligny to the command of a colonizing expedition (from which the admiral&nbsp;was not deterred by the failure of Nicolas Durand de&nbsp;Villegagnon on a similar mission), Ribault sailed on 18th&nbsp;February 1562 with two vessels, and on 1st May landed&nbsp;at St John’s river, or, as he called it, Rivière de Mai.&nbsp;Having settled his colonists at Port Royal Harbour and&nbsp;built Fort Charles for their protection, he returned to&nbsp;France to find the country in the throes of the civil war.&nbsp;In 1563 he appears to have been in England and to have&nbsp;issued </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The whole and true discoverie of Terra Florida.</span><span class="font1"> In&nbsp;April 1564 Coligny was in a position to despatch another&nbsp;expedition under Laudonnière ; but meanwhile Ribault’s&nbsp;colony had come to an untimely end, the unfortunate&nbsp;adventurers, destitute of supplies from home, having&nbsp;revolted against their governor and attempted to make&nbsp;their way back to Europe in a boat which was happily&nbsp;picked up, when they were in the last extremities, by an&nbsp;English vessel. In 1565 Ribault was again sent out to&nbsp;satisfy the admiral as to Laudonnière’s management of his&nbsp;new settlement, Fort Caroline, on the Riviere de Mai.&nbsp;While he was still there the Spaniards under Menendez de&nbsp;Avila, though their country was at peace with France,&nbsp;attacked the French ships at the mouth of the river.&nbsp;Ribault set out to retaliate on the Spanish fleet, but his&nbsp;vessels were wrecked by a storm near Cape Canaveral and&nbsp;he had to attempt to return to Fort Caroline by land. The&nbsp;fort had by this time fallen into the hands of the Spaniards,&nbsp;who had slaughtered all the colonists except a few who got&nbsp;off with two ships under Ribault’s son. Induced to surrender by false assurances of safeguard, Ribault and his&nbsp;men were also put to the sword in October 1565. The&nbsp;massacre was avenged in kind by Dominique de Gourgues&nbsp;two years later.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RIBBON-FISHES </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(fTrachyplemdæf</span><span class="font1"> a family of marine fishes readily recognized by their long, compressed tapelike body, short head, narrow mouth, and feeble dentition. A high dorsal fin occupies the whole length of&nbsp;the back ; an anal is absent, and the caudal, if present,&nbsp;deviates in its direction from the longitudinal axis of the&nbsp;body. The pectoral fins are small, the ventrals composed&nbsp;of several rays, or of one long ray only. Ribbon-fishes&nbsp;possess all the characteristics of fishes living at very great&nbsp;depths. They are extremely fragile when found floating&nbsp;on the surface or thrown ashore, and rarely in an uninjured&nbsp;condition ; the rays of their fins especially, and the membrane connecting them, are of a very delicate and brittle&nbsp;structure. In young ribbon-fishes some of the fin-rays&nbsp;are prolonged in an extraordinary degree, and sometimes&nbsp;provided with appendages (see fig. 2). The largest of&nbsp;ribbon-fishes are the species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Regalecus</span><span class="font1"> (see Oar-Fish),&nbsp;of which specimens some 20 feet long by 12 inches in&nbsp;depth of body and 2 inches in thickness have been found.&nbsp;Like all deep sea fishes they occur in all seas. The most&nbsp;common of the British seas is the Vagmaer or Deal-Fish&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lfΓrachypterus arcticus)</span><span class="font1"> from 3 to 5 feet long, of which&nbsp;almost every year after the equinoctial gales specimens are&nbsp;picked up on the coasts of North Britain, of the Orkneys,&nbsp;Scandinavia, and Iceland (see also Ichthyology, vol. xii.&nbsp;pp. 684, 691).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIBBONS. By this name are designated narrow webs, properly of silk, not exceeding nine inches in width, used&nbsp;primarily for binding and tying in connexion with dress,&nbsp;but also now applied for innumerable useful, ornamental,&nbsp;and symbolical purposes. Along with that of tapes,&nbsp;fringes, and other smallwares, the manufacture of ribbons&nbsp;forms a special department of the textile industries. It is&nbsp;obvious that the weaving of very narrow fabrics, piece by&nbsp;piece, on separate looms would be a tedious and expensive&nbsp;process ; yet for ages such was the only method of making&nbsp;ribbons. The essential feature of a ribbon loom is the&nbsp;simultaneous weaving in one loom frame of two or more&nbsp;webs, going up to as many as forty narrow fabrics in&nbsp;modern looms. To effect the conjoined throwing of all the&nbsp;shuttles and the various other movements of the loom the&nbsp;automatic action of the power-loom is necessary ; and it is&nbsp;a remarkable fact that the self-acting ribbon loom was&nbsp;known and extensively used more than a century before&nbsp;the famous invention of Cartwright. A loom in which&nbsp;several narrow webs could be woven at one time is mentioned as having been working in Dantzic towards the end&nbsp;of the 16th century. Similar looms were at work in&nbsp;Leyden in 1620, where their use gave rise to so much discontent and rioting on the part of the weavers that the&nbsp;states general had to prohibit their use. The prohibition&nbsp;was renewed at various intervals throughout the century,&nbsp;and in the same interval the use of the ribbon loom was&nbsp;interdicted in most of the principal industrial centres of&nbsp;Europe. About 1676, under the name of the Dutch loom&nbsp;or engine loom, it was brought to London ; and, although&nbsp;its introduction there caused some disturbance, it does not&nbsp;appear to have been prohibited. In 1745 the celebrated&nbsp;John Kay, the inventor of the fly-shuttle, obtained, con</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
