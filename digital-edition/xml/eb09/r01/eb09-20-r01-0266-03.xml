                <p><label>RÁMPUR</label>, a native state of India, in the Rohilkhand division of the
                    North-Western Provinces, lying between 28° 26' and 29° 10' N. lat. and between
                    78°54' and 79°33' E. long. It is bounded on the N. and W. by the British
                    district of MurAdAbAd, and on the N.E. and S.E. by the district of Bareli. The
                    country is level and generally fertile ; it is well watered in the north by the
                    rivers Kosila and Xaliul and in the south by the RAmgangA. It adjoins the Tarai
                    on the north, at the foot of the HimA-layas, and is exceedingly unhealthy. The
                    total area of the state is 945 square miles, with a population (1881) of 541,914
                    (males 282,359, females 259,555), of whom 302,989 were Hindus and 238,925
                    Mohammedans.</p>
                <p>The revenue of Rampur in 1883-84 was £167,031 and the ordinary annual
                    expenditure £160,134. Rice, sugar, hides, and a kind of damask are the principal
                    exports, and the imports comprise elephants, English cloth, and groceries and
                    salt. During the mutiny of 1857 the nawab of Rampur rendered important services
                    to the British, for which he received a grant of land assessed at £12,852 in
                    perpetuity, besides other honours.</p>
