In&nbsp;zoology he took special interest, and on his return to&nbsp;England became founder and first president of the Zoological Society. While in Calcutta in 1809, Raffles suggested to Lord Minto, then governor-general of India, the&nbsp;desirableness of wresting Java from the French. The&nbsp;governor-general took up the idea with vigour; a fleet of&nbsp;ninety ships dropped anchor before Batavia in August&nbsp;1811, and in a short time the conquest of the island was&nbsp;effected. Raffles was made lieutenant-general of the new&nbsp;territory, and resolved to give to the island a pure and&nbsp;upright administration. There were three sources of&nbsp;abuse to eradicate—the revenue system, the system of&nbsp;police and public justice, and the slave trade. In a period&nbsp;of only five years Raffles had almost effected his design;&nbsp;his popularity was secured, and the revenue was eight&nbsp;times larger than it had been under the Dutch. The&nbsp;policy of some of his measures being, however, considered&nbsp;doubtful by the home authorities, he was recalled in 1816,&nbsp;but his conduct was approved. He published a valuable&nbsp;and well-illustrated </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Java,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> in 2 vols. 4to, 1817.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Having received knighthood, Sir Stamford Raffles set out for Sumatra as lieutenant-governor of Bencoolen,&nbsp;arriving in March 1818, and immediately recommenced&nbsp;the work of reform. In 1819 he induced the marquis of&nbsp;Hastings to annex Singapore. He again visited Singapore,&nbsp;his “political child,” in 1822, and occupied himself for&nbsp;nearly a year in laying out the new city, and in establishing its constitution as a free port. Java had been&nbsp;given up to the Dutch shortly after Sir Stamford left it,&nbsp;and now Bencoolen was granted to them in exchange for&nbsp;Malacca. On setting sail for England from Sumatra in&nbsp;February 1824 the ship took fire and the crew and passengers were with difficulty saved. The loss to Sir Stamford was beyond all repair. The whole of his drawings,&nbsp;all his collections in botany and zoology, all his multitudinous papers and manuscripts, fell a prey to the flames,&nbsp;his pecuniary loss amounting to more than ¿£20,000.&nbsp;During one of his excursions into the interior of Sumatra,&nbsp;in company with Dr Arnold, he came upon the largest&nbsp;and most extraordinary of known flowers, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rafflesia&nbsp;Amoldi</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Parasitism, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xviii. p. 265). In 1820 he&nbsp;sent home a large collection of preserved animals, now in&nbsp;the museum of the London Zoological Society, described&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the Linnean Society. He died of&nbsp;apoplexy at his house near London on 5th July 1826.</span></p>

He&nbsp;is chiefly known in connexion Math the controversy as to&nbsp;the question of the discovery of America by the Norsemen.&nbsp;(See </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">America, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. i. p. 706.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAGATZ, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ragaz, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a watering-place in Switzerland, in the canton of St Gall, ■with a station on the railway to&nbsp;Coire, 64 miles south-east of Zurich, stands 1700 feet&nbsp;above the sea at the mouth of the magnificent gorge&nbsp;through which the impetuous Tamina forces its way to&nbsp;the Rhine; its baths are supplied ■with mineral water&nbsp;from the hot springs of Pfäffers, which issue from the&nbsp;right side of the ravine 2| miles higher up. As the tourist&nbsp;centre for one of the most picturesque districts of Switzerland, Ragatz has greatly increased since the middle of the&nbsp;century. It had then only 650 inhabitants; in 1870&nbsp;there were 1825, and in 1880 1996, while the annual&nbsp;number of visitors is about 50,000. In the churchyard&nbsp;is the grave of Schelling, who died at Ragatz in 1854.&nbsp;Ragatz originally belonged to the abbots of the Benedictine&nbsp;monastery of Pfäffers (713-1838); their residence became&nbsp;in 1840 the “Hof Ragatz” hotel, and in 1868 the whole&nbsp;property, which had been seized by the state in 1838,&nbsp;passed into private hands. The Swiss defeated the&nbsp;Austrians at Ragatz in 1446.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAGLAN, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Fitzroy James Henry Somerset, Baron </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1788-1855), English general, was the eighth and youngest&nbsp;son of the fifth duke of Beaufort by Elizabeth, daughter&nbsp;of Admiral the Hon. Edward Boscawen, and was born on&nbsp;30tli September 1788. He entered the army in 1804. In&nbsp;1807 he was attached to the Hon. Sir Arthur Paget’s&nbsp;embassy to Turkey, and the same year he ־«<sup>,</sup>as selected to&nbsp;serve on the staff of Sir Arthur Wellesley in the expedition to Copenhagen. In the following year he accompanied the same general in a like capacity to Portugal,&nbsp;and during the whole of the Peninsular War was at his&nbsp;right hand, first as aide-de-camp and then as military&nbsp;secretary. He specially distinguished himself at the storming of Badajoz, being the first to mount the breach, and&nbsp;it was to him that the governor delivered up his sword.&nbsp;During the short period of the Bourbon rule in 1814 and&nbsp;1815 he was secretary to the English embassy at Paris.&nbsp;On the renewal of the war he again became aide-de-camp&nbsp;and military secretary to the duke of Wellington. At&nbsp;Waterloo he lost his right arm by a shot, but he quickly&nbsp;gained the facility of writing with his left hand, and on&nbsp;the conclusion of the war resumed his duties as secretary&nbsp;to the embassy at Paris. From 1818 to 1826 he sat in the&nbsp;House of Commons as member for Truro. In 1819 he was&nbsp;appointed secretary to the duke of Wellington as master-general of the ordnance, and from 1827 till the death of&nbsp;the duke in 1852 was military secretary to him as commander-in-chief. He was then appointed master-general&nbsp;of the ordnance, and shortly afterwards was raised to the&nbsp;House of Lords as Baron Raglan. In 1854 he was&nbsp;appointed to the command of the English troops sent to&nbsp;the Crimea. Here the advantage of his training under&nbsp;the duke of Wellington was seen in the soundness of his&nbsp;military tactics, but the trying ־«<sup>,</sup>inter campaign in the&nbsp;Crimea also brought into prominence defects perhaps&nbsp;traceable to his long connexion with the formalities and&nbsp;uniform regulations of military offices in peace time. At&nbsp;the same time the hampering influence of a divided command must be taken into account, and it ought not to be&nbsp;forgotten that, if his advice had been adopted by the&nbsp;French at the beginning, Sebastopol would very probably&nbsp;have fallen in a few weeks after the landing of the allies.&nbsp;His suggestion was to march straight upon the north side&nbsp;of Sebastopol, but after the battle of Alma on 20th&nbsp;September the plan was abandoned, and the south side&nbsp;was reached by the desperate expedient of a perilous flank&nbsp;march. For the hardships and sufferings of the English&nbsp;soldiers in the terrible Crimean winter o«<sup>7</sup>ing to a failure&nbsp;in the commissariat, both as regards food'and clothing,&nbsp;Lord Raglan and his staff were at the time severely censured by the press and the Government; but, while Lord&nbsp;Raglan was possibly to blame in representing matters in a&nbsp;too sanguine light, it afterwards appeared that the chief&nbsp;neglect rested with the home authorities. The monotony&nbsp;of the siege was broken by the battles of Balaclava on 26th&nbsp;October and of Inkermann on 5th November, in which&nbsp;the accurate and rapid decision of Lord Raglan changed&nbsp;impending disasters into brilliant victories. During the&nbsp;trying <sup>,</sup>«<sup>,</sup>inter of 1854-55 the suffering he «<sup>,</sup>as compelled&nbsp;to witness, the censures, in great part unjust, which he had&nbsp;to endure, and all the manifold anxieties of the siege&nbsp;seriously undermined his health, and he died of dysentery&nbsp;on 28th June 1855.</span></p>
