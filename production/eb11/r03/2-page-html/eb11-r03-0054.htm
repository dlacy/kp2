<p><span class="font0">by the jib-boom. The square spritsail, which could not be trained fore and aft, and was of feeble effect in keeping the ship’s head from&nbsp;turning to windward, has been replaced by the jib. The spritsail&nbsp;yard (which continued in use till after 1850) has disappeared and&nbsp;has been replaced by the spritsail gaffs, two fixed spars which slope&nbsp;downwards and help to support the &quot; jib-guys,” the lateral supports&nbsp;of the booms. For a time, and after the use of SpritsaiIs had been&nbsp;given up, the spritsail yard continued to be used to discharge the&nbsp;function now given to the gaffs (see Smyth, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sailors Word-Book<sub>&nbsp;</sub>sub voce).</span><span class="font0"> The changes in the mizzen have an obscure history.&nbsp;About the middle of the 18th century it ceased to be a pure lateen.&nbsp;The yard was retained, but no sail was set on the forearm. Then&nbsp;the yard was given up and replaced by a gaff and a boom. The&nbsp;new sail was called the spanker. It was, however, comparatively&nbsp;narrow, and when a greater spread of sail was required, a studding-sail (at first called a &quot; driver ”) was added. At a later date&nbsp;” spanker ” and ” driver ” were used as synonymous terms, and&nbsp;the studding-sail was called a “ ringtail.” The studding-sails are&nbsp;the representatives of a class of sail once more generally used. In&nbsp;modern times a sail is cut of the extreme size which is capable of&nbsp;being carried in fine weather, and when the wind increases in strength&nbsp;it is reefed—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> part is gathered up and fastened by reef points,&nbsp;small cords attached to the sail. Till the I7th century at least&nbsp;the method was often to cut the courses small, so that they could&nbsp;be carried in rough weather. When a greater spread of sail was&nbsp;required, a piece called a bonnet was added to the foot of the sail,&nbsp;and a further piece called a drabbler could be added to that. It is&nbsp;an example of the tenacious conservatism of the sea that this&nbsp;practice is still retained by the Swedish small craft called “ lodjor ”&nbsp;in the Baltic and White Sea. It will be easily understood that no&nbsp;innovation was universally accepted at once. Jib and sprit topsail,&nbsp;lateen, mizzen and spanker, and so forth, would be found for long&nbsp;on the sea together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The history of the development of rigging is one of adjustment. The size of the masts had to be adapted to the ship, and it was&nbsp;necessary to find the due proportion between yards and masts.&nbsp;As the size of the medieval ship increased, the natural course&nbsp;was to increase the height of the mast and of the sail it carried.&nbsp;Even when the mast was subdivided into lower, top and&nbsp;topgallant, the lower mast was too long, and the strain of the&nbsp;sail racked the* hull. Hence the constant tendency of the&nbsp;ships to leak. Sir Henry Manwayring, when giving the proper&nbsp;proportions of the masts, says that the Flemings </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;Dutch) made them taller (“taller” and “taunt” were for&nbsp;long used to mean the same thing) than the English, which&nbsp;again forced them to make the sails less wide. A tall sail&nbsp;could not he cut so wide as a lower one without putting an&nbsp;excessive strain on the mast. He says that the Flemings found&nbsp;an advantage in working to windward, but that they “ wronged ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font0"> racked) their ships. The English preferred a less lofty&nbsp;mast and a wider spread of sail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is very difficult to say what changes in the proportions of masts and yards took place in English ships between the early&nbsp;17th and the 19th centuries. The difficulty arises largely not only&nbsp;from insufficient knowledge of the earlier period, but from the fact&nbsp;that a scale was fixed only after trials, and by degrees. Manwayring,&nbsp;for instance, when giving the proportion of the topmasts to lower&nbsp;masts, says: “ The topmasts are ever half so long as the masts into&nbsp;which they belong; but there is no absolute proportion in these,&nbsp;and the like things, for if a man will have his mast short, he may&nbsp;the bolder make his topmast long.” In some respects the change&nbsp;was certainly slight. In the early 17th century, in England at&nbsp;least, the length of the mainmast was fixed by taking four-fifths&nbsp;of the breadth of the ship and multiplying by three. Two centuries&nbsp;later the method was to take the length of the lower deck and the&nbsp;extreme breadth, add them together, and divide by two. If we&nbsp;take a 74-gun ship of about the year 1820, which was 176 ft. long&nbsp;on the lower deck and 4.8 ft. 8 in. wide, she would have, by the&nbsp;system then used, a mainmast of 112 ft. Manwayring’s system&nbsp;would have given her one of 117 ft. But in the proportions of the&nbsp;masts to one another there was a change. In the 17th century the&nbsp;foremast was four-fifths of the main, and the bowsprit was of the&nbsp;same length as the foremast. In the 19th the foremast was eight-ninths of the mainmast, while the bowsprit was seven-elevenths&nbsp;of the mainmast in the largest ships, and three-fifths in the others.&nbsp;When we come to the relative proportions of masts and yards the&nbsp;difficulty increases, for the standard was not the same. The, seamen&nbsp;of the 17th century calculated the length of the mainyard not by&nbsp;the size of the mast but by the length of the keel. The mainyard,&nbsp;which was the standard for the others, ought according to the&nbsp;best and most absolute ” estimate to be five-sixths of the length&nbsp;of the keel. But Manwayring again explains that “ the proportion&nbsp;is not absolute.” If it was followed, the yards of a I7th-century&nbsp;ship must have been rather longer than in a vessel of a hundred&nbsp;and fifty and two hundred years later, when the mainyard was&nbsp;eight-ninths of the mainmast, and a regular scale was fixed throughout. Even so Manwayring’s warning that “ the proportion was not&nbsp;absolute ” must be borne in mind. Changes were constant. The&nbsp;development of the famous American clippers made a considerable&nbsp;one. So has the growth of the vast four- and five-masted iron sailing&nbsp;ships of recent days. Individual captains have fitted ships according&nbsp;to ideas of their own. It has always happened that extra sails&nbsp;have been invented and set by ingenious devices for particular&nbsp;purposes. One large sail requires more men to handle it than&nbsp;several small ones. For this reason it is that in recent times the&nbsp;topsails of merchant ships have been divided into upper and lower,&nbsp;with a great loss of beauty, but an increase of convenience. To&nbsp;the same cause, the wish to economize in the size of the crew, is to&nbsp;be attributed the introduction of machinery for reefing sail from&nbsp;the deck, which is also an easier and a safer process than going aloft&nbsp;to reef them by hand, ln a general way it may be said that the&nbsp;development of the rigging has been towards establishing a fair&nbsp;balance between the fore and after spread of canvas. Until the&nbsp;jib was invented in the 18th century, a ship which was sailing on&nbsp;the wind was subject to a disproportionate pressure aft. lf she&nbsp;was at all given to ” griping ”—that is to say, inclined to turn head&nbsp;to wind (and all ships are liable to have ways and manners which&nbsp;are mysterious in origin and not seldom incurable), the mizzén-sail&nbsp;could not be used, for if it had been she would never have been&nbsp;“ out of the wind.” Therefore when close-hauled (sailing with the&nbsp;wind on the side and somewhat from before her centre) she lost the&nbsp;use of part of her sail. The spritsail which could not be trained&nbsp;fore and aft was no use “ on the wind.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A few words may be added concerning the tops. In the earlier form of ships the top was a species of crow’s nest placed&nbsp;at the head of the mast to hold a look-out, or in military operations to give a place of. advantage to archers and slingers.&nbsp;They appear occasionally as mere bags attached to one side&nbsp;of the mast. As a general rule they are round. In the 16th&nbsp;century there were frequently two tops on the fore- and mainmasts, one at the head of the lower, another at the head of&nbsp;the topmast, where in later times there have only been the two&nbsp;traverse beams which make the crosstrees. The upper top&nbsp;dropped out by the 17th century. The form was round, and so&nbsp;continued to be till the 18th century when the quadrangular&nbsp;form was introduced. In quite recent times the military tops&nbsp;of warships have resumed the circular form.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RIGHTS OF MAN AND OF THE CITIZEN, DECLARATION</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">OF, a sort of manifesto issued in 1789 by the Constituent Assembly in the French Revolution, to be inscribed at the head&nbsp;of the constitution when it should be completed. It stated&nbsp;the fundamental principles which inspired the revolution.&nbsp;Historians have traced a connexion with the declarations&nbsp;of rights which preceded the constitution of some of the states&nbsp;of the American Union, especially of Virginia, but the situation&nbsp;in France at the time, and the influence of the writings of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">philosophes</span><span class="font0"> made the proposal for such a statement very natural.&nbsp;The declaration overturned the political and social principles&nbsp;upon which the existent régime stood. It has served as a&nbsp;base for modern civil legislation and is still a force in European&nbsp;history. The final text voted by the Assembly was accepted by&nbsp;the king on the 5th of October 1789, at first conditionally, then&nbsp;with modifications. It contains a preamble and 17 articles.&nbsp;They proclaim and define political equality and liberty in its&nbsp;various manifestations, determine the character of the law&nbsp;and the conditions of its application, and state at the same&nbsp;time the restrictions upon the individual will which are necessary</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
