<p><span class="font0">passengers and goods are generally in different and sometimes in, distant positions, the place selected for each being that&nbsp;which is most convenient for the traffic. The passenger station&nbsp;abuts on the main line, or, at termini, forms the natural terminus,&nbsp;at a place as near as can conveniently be obtained to the centre&nbsp;of the population which constitutes the passenger traffic;&nbsp;and preferably its platforms should be at or near the ground&nbsp;level, for convenience of access. The goods station is approached by a siding or fork set off from the main line at a&nbsp;point short of the passenger station. In order to keep down&nbsp;the expense of shunting the empty trains and engines to and&nbsp;from the platforms the carriage and locomotive depots should&nbsp;be as near the passenger station as possible; but often the&nbsp;price of land renders it impracticable to locate them in the&nbsp;immediate vicinity and they are to be found at a distance of&nbsp;several miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In laying out the approaches and station yard of a passenger station ample width and space should be provided, with well-defined means of ingress and egress to facilitate the&nbsp;circulation of vehicles and with a long setting-down&nbsp;pavement to enable them to discharge their passengers&nbsp;and luggage without delay. The position of the main buildings&nbsp;—ticket offices, waiting and refreshment-rooms, parcels offices,&nbsp;&amp;c. —relative to the direction of the lines of rails may be used&nbsp;as a means of classifying terminal stations. They are placed&nbsp;either on the departure side parallel to the platform (“ side ”&nbsp;stations) or at right angles to the rails and platforms (“ end ”&nbsp;stations). Many large stations, however, are of a mixed type,&nbsp;and the offices are arranged in a fork between two or more&nbsp;series of platforms, or partly at the end and partly on one side.&nbsp;Where heavy suburban traffic has to be dealt with, the ex-pedient is occasionally adopted of taking some of the lines round&nbsp;the end in a continuous loop, so that incoming trains can&nbsp;deposit their passengers at an underground platform and&nbsp;immediately proceed on their outward journey. Intermediate&nbsp;stations, like terminal ones, sheuld be convenient in situation&nbsp;and easy of approach, and, especially if they are important,&nbsp;should be on the ground level rather than on an embankment&nbsp;or in a cutting. The lines through them should be, if possible,&nbsp;straight and on the level; the British Board of Trade forbids&nbsp;them being placed on a gradient steeper than 1 in 260, unless&nbsp;it is unavoidable. Intermediate stations at the surface level&nbsp;are naturally constructed as side stations, and whether&nbsp;offices are provided on both sides or whether they are mainly&nbsp;concentrated on one will depend on local circumstances, the&nbsp;amount of the traffic, and the direction in which it preponderates. When the railway lies below the surface level the bulk&nbsp;of the offices are often placed on a bridge spanning the lines,&nbsp;access being given to the platforms by staircases or lifts, and&nbsp;similarly when the railway is at a high level the offices may&nbsp;be arranged under the lines. Occasionally on a double-track&nbsp;railway one platform placed between the tracks serves both&nbsp;of them; this “island” arrangement, as it is termed, has&nbsp;the advantage that more tracks can be readily added without&nbsp;disturbance of existing buildings, but when it is adopted the&nbsp;exit from the trains is at the opposite side to that which is&nbsp;usual, and accidents have happened through passengers alighting at the usual side without noticing the absence of a platform. At stations on double-track railways which have a&nbsp;heavy traffic four tracks are sometimes provided, the two&nbsp;outside ones only having platforms, so that fast trains get a&nbsp;clear road and can pass slow ones that are standing in the&nbsp;station. In Great Britain, it may be noted, trains almost&nbsp;invariably keep to the left, whereas in most other countries</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">right-handed running is the rule.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The arrangement and appropriation of the tracks in a station materially affect the economical and efficient working of the&nbsp;traffic. There must be a sufficient provision of sidings, connected with the running tracks by points, for holding spare&nbsp;rolling stock and to enable carriages to be added to or taken&nbsp; off trains and engines to be changed with as little delay as&nbsp;possible. At terminal stations, especially at such as are used&nbsp;by short-distance trains which arrive at and start from the&nbsp;same platform, a third track is often laid between a pair of&nbsp;platform tracks, so that the engine of a train which has arrived&nbsp;at the platform can pass out and place itself at the other end&nbsp;of the train, which remains undisturbed. At the new Victoria&nbsp;station (London) of the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast&nbsp;railway—which is so long that two trains can stand end to&nbsp;end at the platforms—this system is extended so as to permit a&nbsp;train to start out from the inner end of a platform even though&nbsp;another train is occupying the outer end. One of the advantages of electric trains on the multiple control system is that&nbsp;they economize terminal accommodation, because they can be&nbsp;driven from either end indifferently, and therefore avoid the&nbsp;necessity for tracks by which engines can change from one end&nbsp;of the train to the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The platforms on British railways have a standard elevation of 3 ft. above rail level, and they are not now made less than&nbsp;2½ ft. in height. In other countries they are generally lower;&nbsp;in the United States they are commonly level with, or only a&nbsp;few inches higher than, the top of the rails. They may consist&nbsp;of earth with a retaining wall along the tracks and with the&nbsp;surface gravelled or paved with stone or asphalt, or they may&nbsp;be constructed entirely of timber, or they may be formed of&nbsp;stone slabs supported on longitudinal walls. They should he&nbsp;of ample dimensions to accommodate the traffic—the British&nbsp;Board of Trade requires them to be not less than 6 ft. wide at&nbsp;small stations and not less than 12 ft. wide at large ones—and&nbsp;they should be as free as possible from obstructions, such as&nbsp;pillars supporting the roof. At intermediate stations the roofs&nbsp;are often carried on brackets fixed to the walls of the station&nbsp;buildings, and project only to the edge of the platforms. At&nbsp;larger stations where both the platforms and the tracks arc&nbsp;covered in, there are two broad types of construction, with&nbsp;many intermediate variations: the roof may either be comparatively low, of the “ ridge and furrow ” pattern, borne on&nbsp;a number of rows of pillars, or it may consist of a single lofty&nbsp;span extending clear across the area from the side walls. The&nbsp;advantage claimed for roofs formed with one or two large spans&nbsp;is that they permit the platforms and tracks to be readily&nbsp;rearranged at any time as required, whereas this is difficult with&nbsp;the other type, especially since the British Board of Trade&nbsp;requires the pillars to be not less than 6 ft. away from the&nbsp;edges of the platforms. On the other hand, wide spans are&nbsp;more expensive both in first cost and in maintenance, and there&nbsp;is the possibility of a failure such as caused the collapse in&nbsp;December 1905 of the roof of Charing Cross (S. E. R. ) station,&nbsp;London, which then consisted of a single span. Whatever&nbsp;the pattern adopted for the roof, a sufficient portion of it must&nbsp;be glazed to admit light, and it should be so designed that the&nbsp;ironwork can be easily inspected and painted and the glass&nbsp;readily cleaned. For the illumination of large stations by&nbsp;night electric arc lamps are frequently employed, but some&nbsp;authorities favour high-pressure incandescent gas-lighting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At busy stations separate tracks are sometimes appropriated to the use of height engines and empty trains, on which they may&nbsp;be run between the platforms and the locomotive and&nbsp;carriage depots. A carriage depot includes sheds in&nbsp;which the vehicles are stored, arrangements for washing and cleaning them, and sidings on which they are marshalled into trains. At a locomotive depot the chief building&nbsp;is the “ running shed ” in which the engines are housed and&nbsp;cleaned. This may be rectangular in shape (“ straight ” shed),&nbsp;containing a series of parallel tracks on which the engines stand&nbsp;and which are reached by means of points and crossings diverging from a main track outside; or it may take a polygonal&nbsp;or circular form (round house or rotunda), the lines for the&nbsp;engines radiating from a turn-table which occupies the centre&nbsp;and can be rotated so as to serve any of the radiating lines.&nbsp;The second arrangement enables any particular engine to enter&nbsp;or leave without disturbing the other; but on the other hand&nbsp;an accident to the turn-table may temporarily imprison the whole&nbsp;of them. In both types pits are constructed between the rails</span></p>
