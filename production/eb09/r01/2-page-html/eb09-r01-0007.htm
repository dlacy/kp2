<p><span class="font2">poet at Rome, and with Ronsard at Meudon and elsewhere, that this caused </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font2">breach between him and the Pléiade,&nbsp;that he satirized its classicizing tendencies in the episode&nbsp;of the Limousin scholar, and that Ronsard after his death&nbsp;avenged himself by a libellous epitaph. The facts are&nbsp;these. Nothing is heard of the quarrel with Du Bellay or&nbsp;of any meeting with him, nothing of the meetings and&nbsp;bickerings with Ronsard, till 1699, when Bernier tells the&nbsp;story without any authority. The supposed allusions to the&nbsp;Pléiade date from a time when Ronsard was a small boy,&nbsp;and are mainly borrowed from an earlier writer still,&nbsp;Geoffroy Tory. Lastly, the epitaph read impartially is not&nbsp;libellous at all but simply takes up the vein of the opening&nbsp;scenes of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font2"> in reference to Gargantua’s author.&nbsp;There is indeed no reason to suppose that either Ronsard&nbsp;or Du Bellay was a fervent admirer of Rabelais, for they&nbsp;belonged to a very different literary school ; but there is&nbsp;absolutely no evidence of any enmity between them or&nbsp;even of any acquaintanceship which could have given rise&nbsp;to enmity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some chapters of Rabelais’s fourth book had been published in 1548, but the whole did not appear till 1552. The Sorbonne censured it and the parliament suspended&nbsp;the sale, taking advantage of the king’s absence from Paris.&nbsp;But it was soon relieved of the suspension. This is the last&nbsp;fact we know about Rabelais. It is supposed that he died&nbsp;in 1553, but actual history is quite silent, and the legends&nbsp;about his deathbed utterances—“La farce est jouée,” “Je&nbsp;vais chercher un grand peut-être,” &amp;c.—are altogether&nbsp;apocryphal. The same may be said of the numerous&nbsp;silly stories told of his life, such as that of his procuring&nbsp;a free passage to Paris by inscribing packets “Poison&nbsp;for the king,” and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ten years after the publication of the fourth book and nine after the supposed date of the author’s death there&nbsp;appeared at Lyons sixteen chapters entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">VÎle Sonnante&nbsp;par Maistre François Rabelais,</span><span class="font2"> and two years later the&nbsp;entire fifth book was printed as such. In 1567 it took&nbsp;place with the others, and has ever since appeared with&nbsp;them. But from the beginning of the 17th century there&nbsp;have never been wanting disbelievers in its authenticity.&nbsp;The controversy is one of some intricacy, but as it is also&nbsp;one of capital importance in literary history the heads of&nbsp;it at least must be given here. The opponents of the book&nbsp;rely (1) on the testimony of a certain Louis Guyon, who&nbsp;in 1604 declared that the fifth book was made long after&nbsp;Rabelais’s death by an author whom he knew, and who&nbsp;was not a doctor, and on the assertion of the bibliographer&nbsp;Du Verdier, about the same time, that it was written by&nbsp;an “écolier de Valence”; (2) on the fact that the anti-monastic and even anti-Catholic polemic is much more&nbsp;accentuated in it ; (3) that parts are apparently replicas&nbsp;or rough drafts of passages already appearing in the four&nbsp;earlier books; (4) that some allusions are manifestly&nbsp;posterior to even the farthest date which can be assigned&nbsp;for the reputed author’s decease. On the other hand, it&nbsp;is urged that, though Guyon and Du Verdier were in a&nbsp;sense contemporaries, they wrote long after the events,&nbsp;and that the testimony of the former is vitiated, not&nbsp;merely by its extreme vagueness but by the fact that&nbsp;it occurs in a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">plaidoyer,</span><span class="font2"> tending to exculpate physicians&nbsp;from the charge of unorthodoxy ; that Du Verdier in&nbsp;another place assigns the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagrueline Prognostication</span><span class="font2"> to&nbsp;this same unknown student of Valence, and had therefore&nbsp;probably confused and hearsay notions on the subject ;&nbsp;that the rasher and fiercer tone, as well as the apparent&nbsp;repetitions, are sufficiently accounted for on the supposition that Rabelais never finally revised the book, which&nbsp;indeed dates show that he could not have done, as the&nbsp;fourth was not finally settled till just before his death ;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">and that it is perfectly probable, and indeed almost certain, that it was prepared from his papers by another hand,&nbsp;which is responsible for the anachronous allusions above&nbsp;referred to. But the strongest argument, and one which&nbsp;has never been attacked by authorities really competent&nbsp;to judge, is that the “ griffe de l’aigle ” is on the book,&nbsp;and that no known author of the time except Rabelais&nbsp;was capable of writing the passage about the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chats fourres,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the better part of the history of Queen Whims (La Quinte)&nbsp;and her court, and the conclusion giving the Oracle of the&nbsp;Bottle. To this argument we believe that the more competent a critic is, both by general faculty of appreciation&nbsp;and by acquaintance with contemporary French literature,&nbsp;the more positive will be the assent that he yields.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel,</span><span class="font1"> notwithstanding their high literary standing and the frequency with which certain passages from them&nbsp;are cited, are, owing partly to their archaism of language and partly&nbsp;to the extreme licence which their author has allowed himself, so&nbsp;little read that no notice of them or of him could be complete&nbsp;without some sketch of their contents. The first book, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">describes the birth of that hero (a giant and the son of gigantic&nbsp;parents), whose nativity is ushered in by the account of a tremendous&nbsp;feast. In this the burlesque exaggeration of the pleasures of eating&nbsp;and drinking, which is one of the chief exterior notes of the whole&nbsp;work, is pushed to an extreme,—an extreme which has attracted&nbsp;natural but perhaps undue attention. Very early, however, the&nbsp;author becomes serious in contrasting the early education of his&nbsp;hero—a satire on the degraded schools of the Middle Ages—with&nbsp;its subsequent and reformed stage, in the account of which all the&nbsp;best and noblest ideas of the humanist Renaissance in reference to&nbsp;pedagogy are put with exceptional force. Gargantua is recalled&nbsp;from Paris, whither he had been sent to finish his education, owing&nbsp;to a war between his father, Grandcosier, and the neighbouring king,&nbsp;Picrochole. This war is described at great length, the chief hero&nbsp;of it being the monk, Friar John, a very unclerical cleric, in whom&nbsp;Rabelais greatly delights. Picrochole defeated and peace made,&nbsp;Gargantua establishes the abbey of Thelema in another of Rabelais’s&nbsp;most elaborate literary passages, where all the points most obnoxious&nbsp;to him in monastic life are indicated by the assignment of their&nbsp;exact opposites to this model convent. The second book, which&nbsp;introduces the principal hero of the whole, Pantagruel, Gargantua’s&nbsp;son, is, on any other hypothesis but that already suggested of its&nbsp;prior composition, very difficult to explain, but in itself it is intelligible enough. Pantagruel goes through something like a second&nbsp;edition (really a first) of the educational experiences of his father.&nbsp;Like him, he goes to Paris, and there meets with Panurge, the&nbsp;principal triumph of Rabelaisian character-drawing, and the most&nbsp;original as well as puzzling figure of the book. Panurge has almost&nbsp;all intellectual accomplishments, but is totally devoid of morality :&nbsp;he is a coward, a drunkard, a lecher, a spiteful trickster, a spendthrift, but all the while infinitely amusing. This book, like the&nbsp;other, has a war in its latter part; Gargantua scarcely appears in&nbsp;it and Friar John not at all. It is not till the opening of the third&nbsp;book that the most important action begins. This arises from&nbsp;Panurge’s determination to marry — a determination, however,&nbsp;which is very half-hearted, and which leads him to consult a vast&nbsp;number of authorities, each giving occasion for satire of a more or&nbsp;less complicated kind. At last it is determined that Pantagruel</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and his followers (·Friar John has reappeared in the suite of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">” <sup>1</sup> ---” ־ <sup>r</sup>' ־־</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">eulogy of the “herb pantagruelion,” which appears to be, if it is anything, hemp. Only two probable explanations of this have&nbsp;been ottered, the one seeing in it an anticipation of Joseph de&nbsp;Maistre’s glorification of the executioner, the other a eulogy of&nbsp;work, hemp being on the whole the most serviceable of vegetable&nbsp;products for that purpose. The fourth and fifth books are entirely&nbsp;taken up with a description of the voyage. Many strange places&nbsp;with stranger names are visited, some of them offering obvious&nbsp;satire on human institutions, others, except by the most far-fetched&nbsp;explanations, resolvable into nothing but sheer extravaganza. At&nbsp;last the Land of Lanterns, borrowed from Lucian, is reached, ami&nbsp;the Oracle of the Bottle is consulted. This yields the single word&nbsp;“Trinq,” which the attendant priestess declares to be the most&nbsp;gracious and intelligible she has ever heard from it. I’anurge&nbsp;takes this as a sanction of his marriage and the book ends abruptly.&nbsp;This singular romance is diversified by or, to speak more properly,&nbsp;it is the vehicle of the most bewildering abundance of digression,&nbsp;burlesque amplification, covert satire on things political, social,&nbsp;and religious, miscellaneous erudition of the literary and scientific&nbsp;kind. Everywhere the author lays stress on the excellence of&nbsp;“ Pantagruelism,” and the reader who is himself a Pantagruelist&nbsp;(it is perfectly idle for any other to attempt the book) soon discovers</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
