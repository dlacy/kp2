        <p><span class="font2">The Forum Romanum or Magnum, as it was called in late
            times</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">to distinguish it from the imperial fora, occupies a valley which
                extends from the foot of the Capitoline Hill to the north-east part&nbsp;of the
                Palatine. Till the construction of the great cloacæ it was,&nbsp;at least in wet
                seasons, marshy ground, in which were several pools&nbsp;of water. In early times it
                was bounded on two sides by rows of&nbsp;shops and houses, dating from the time of
                the first Tarquin (Liv.,&nbsp;i. 35). The shops on the south-west side facing the
                Sacra Via,&nbsp;where the Basilica Julia afterwards was built, were occupied by
                the&nbsp;Tabernæ Veteres.@@<sup>3</sup> The shops on the northern side, being
                occupied&nbsp;by silversmiths, were called Tabernæ Argentariæ (see Liv.,
                xxvi.&nbsp;27, xl. 51), and in later times, when rebuilt after a fire, were
                called&nbsp;Tabernæ Novæ.@@<sup>4</sup> An altar to Saturn (Dionys., i. 34, vi. 1),
                traditionally set up by the companions of Hercules, and an altar to&nbsp;Vulcan,
                both at the end towards the Capitol, with the temple of&nbsp;Vesta and the Regia at
                the opposite end, were among the earliest&nbsp;monuments grouped around the Forum.
                The Lacus Curtius&nbsp;vanished, as Varro says (Z.Z., v. 148-149), probably with
                other&nbsp;stagnant pools, when the cloacæ were constructed (Liv., i.
                    38,&nbsp;56).@@<sup>5</sup> Another pool, the Lacus Servilius, near the Basilica
                Julia,&nbsp;was preserved in some form or other till the imperial period.&nbsp;Under
                Sulla it was used as a place to expose the heads of many&nbsp;senators murdered in
                his proscriptions (Cic., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rose.

                style="font-style:italic;">De Prov.,</span><span class="font2"> 3). The Vulcanal or
                Hephæsteum was an open&nbsp;area, so called from the early altar to Vulcan, and was
                (like the&nbsp;Comitium) a place of public meeting, at least during the
                    regal&nbsp;period.@@<sup>6</sup> It was raised above the Comitium, and probably
                was a&nbsp;space levelled on the lower slope of the Capitoline Hill behind
                the&nbsp;arch of Severus ; but its exact form and position are very doubtful. It was
                probably much encroached upon when the temple of&nbsp;Concord was enlarged in the
                reign of Augustus.</span></p>

        <p><span class="font2">Unlike the fora of the emperors, each of which was surrounded by a
                lofty wall and built at one time from one design, the architectural form of the
                Forum Romanum was a slow growth. The&nbsp;marshy battle-field of the early
                inhabitants of the capitol and&nbsp;Palatine became, when the ground was drained by
                the great cloacæ,&nbsp;under a united rule the most convenient site for political
                meetings,&nbsp;for commercial transactions, and for the pageants of rich

                scenici,</span><span class="font2"> and gladiatorial games.@@<sup>8</sup> For these
                purposes&nbsp;a central space, though but a small one, was kept clear of buildings
                ;&nbsp;but it was gradually occupied in a somewhat inconvenient manner&nbsp;by an
                ever-accumulating crowd of statues and other honorary&nbsp;monuments. On three sides
                the limits of this open space are&nbsp;marked by paved roads, faced by the stately
                buildings which gradually took the place of the simple wooden tabernæ and porticus
                    @@<sup>9</sup> of&nbsp;early times. This central space was essentially the
                meeting-place&nbsp;of the plebs, or the Comitia Tributa, while the patricians,
                the&nbsp;Comitia Curiata, met on the Comitium, which adjoined the Forum.&nbsp;The
                    Comitium@@<sup>10</sup> was a level space in front of the Curia ; the
                construction of both is ascribed to Tullus Hostilius. For the position&nbsp;of the
                Comitium and the Curia@@<sup>11</sup> see plan of Forum (Plate VII.).&nbsp;Varro
                (Z.7λ,v. 155-156) gives the following account of the buildings which were grouped
                along the northern angle of the Forum.</span></p>

                p. 571), and lastly by Diocletian. There is strong evidence&nbsp;to show that the
                existing church of S. Adriano is the Curia of&nbsp;Diocletian, though of course much
                altered, and with its floor raised&nbsp;about 20 feet above the old level. Fig. 12
