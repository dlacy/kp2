<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> Resistance, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Resisting Force,</span><span class="font0"> in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophy,</span><span class="font0"> denotes, in general, any power which acts in an opposite direction to&nbsp;another, so as to destroy or diminish its effect- See Mechanics, Hydrodynamics, and Pneumatics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of all the resistances of bodies to each other, there is undoubtedly none of greater importance than the resistance or re-action of fluids. It is here that we must look for a theory of naval architecture ; for the impulse of the air, which&nbsp;is our moving power, must be modified so as to produce&nbsp;every motion we want by the form and disposition of our&nbsp;sails ; and the resistance of the water, which is the force to&nbsp;be overcome, must also be modified to our purpose, in order that the ship may not drive like a log to leeward, but,&nbsp;on the contrary, may ply to windward ; that she may answer&nbsp;her helm briskly, and be easy in all her motions on the surface of the ocean. The impulse of wind and water makes&nbsp;these elements ready and indefatigable servants in a thousand shapes for driving our machines, and we should lose&nbsp;much of their service did we remain ignorant of the laws of&nbsp;their action ; they would sometimes become terrible masters, if we did not fall upon methods of eluding or softening&nbsp;their attacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We cannot read the accounts of the naval exertions of Phoenicia, Carthage, and of Rome, exertions which have&nbsp;hardly been surpassed by anything of modem date, without&nbsp;believing that the ancients possessed much practical and&nbsp;experimental knowledge of this subject. It was not, perhaps, possessed by them in a strict and systematic form, as&nbsp;it is now taught by our mathematicians ; but the master-builders, in their dockyards, did undoubtedly exercise their&nbsp;genius in marking those circumstances of form and dimension which were, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in fact,</span><span class="font0"> accompanied with the desirable&nbsp;properties of a ship, aqd thus frame to themselves maxims&nbsp;of naval architecture, in the same manner as we do now.&nbsp;The ancients had not made any great progress in the phy-sico-mathematical sciences, which consist chiefly in the application of analysis to the phenomena of nature ; and in&nbsp;this branch, in particular, they could make none, because&nbsp;they had not the means of investigation. A knowledge of&nbsp;the motions and actions of fluids is accessible only to those&nbsp;who are familiarly acquainted with the fluxionary mathematics ; and without this key there is no admittance. Even&nbsp;when possessed of this guide, our progress has been very&nbsp;slow, hesitating, and devious ; and we have not yet been&nbsp;able to establish any set of doctrines which are susceptible&nbsp;of an easy and confident application to the arts of life. If&nbsp;we have advanced farther than the ancients, it is because&nbsp;we have come after them, and have profited by their labours, and even by their mistakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sir Isaac Newton was the first who attempted to make the motions and actions of fluids the subject of mathematical discussion. He had invented the method of fluxions&nbsp;long before he engaged in his physical researches, and he&nbsp;proceeded in these </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mathesi facem prœferente.</span><span class="font0"> Yet even&nbsp;with this guide he was often obliged to grope his way, and&nbsp;to try various by-paths, in the hope of obtaining a legitimate theory. Having exerted all his powers in establishing a theory of the lunar motions, he was obliged to rest&nbsp;contented with an approximation instead of a perfect solution of the problem which ascertains the motions of three&nbsp;bodies mutually acting on each other. This convinced him&nbsp;that it was in vain to expect an accurate investigation of&nbsp;the motions and actions of fluids, where millions of unseen&nbsp;particles combine their influence. He therefore endeavoured to find some particular case of the problem which&nbsp;would admit of an accurate determination, and at the same&nbsp;time furnish circumstances of analogy or resemblance </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">suffi-ciently</span><span class="font0"> numerous for giving the limits of those other cases&nbsp;that did not admit of this accurate investigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Newton figured to himself a hypothetical collection of matter possessing the characteristic property of fluidity, viz.&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quaquaversum</span><span class="font0"> propagation of pressure, and the most&nbsp;perfect intermobility of parts, and forming a physical whole&nbsp;or aggregate, whose parts were connected by mechanical&nbsp;forces determined both in degree and in direction, so that&nbsp;the determination of certain important circumstances of the&nbsp;motion of the parts might be rendered susceptible of precise investigation. And he concluded that the laws which&nbsp;he should discover in these motions must have a great analogy with the laws of the motions of real fluids : and from&nbsp;this hypothesis he deduced a series of propositions, which&nbsp;form the basis of almost all the theories of the impulse and&nbsp;resistance of fluids which have been offered to the public&nbsp;since his time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It must be acknowledged that the results of this theory agree but ill with experiment, and that, in the way in which&nbsp;it has been prosecuted by subsequent mathematicians, it&nbsp;proceeds on principles or assumptions which are not only&nbsp;gratuitous, but even false. But, with all its imperfections,&nbsp;it still furnishes (as was expected by its illustrious author)&nbsp;many propositions of immense practical use, they being the&nbsp;limits to which the real phenomena of the impulse and resistance of fluids really approximate ; so that when the law&nbsp;by which the phenomena deviate from the theory is once&nbsp;determined by a well-chosen series of experiments, this hypothetical theory becomes almost as valuable as a true one.&nbsp;It continues to be the groundwork of all our practical knowledge of the subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We shall therefore lay before our readers a very short view of the theory, and the manner of applying it; we&nbsp;shall then show its defects (all of which were pointed out&nbsp;by its great author), and recount some of the attempts&nbsp;which have been made to amend it ; and, lastly, we shall&nbsp;give an account of the chief sets of experiments which have&nbsp;been made on this important subject, in the hope of establishing an empirical theory, which may be employed with&nbsp;confidence in the arts of life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We know by experience that force must be applied to a body in order that it may move through a fluid, such as air&nbsp;or water ; and that a body projected with any velocity is&nbsp;gradually retarded in its motion, and generally brought to&nbsp;rest. Analogy leads us to imagine that there is a force&nbsp;acting in the opposite direction, or opposing the motion,&nbsp;and that this force resides in or is exerted by the fluid ; and&nbsp;the phenomena resemble those which accompany the known&nbsp;resistance of active beings, such as animals ; therefore we&nbsp;give to this supposed force the metaphorical name of Resistance. We also know that a fluid in motion will hurry&nbsp;a solid body along with the stream, and that force is required to maintain it in its place. A similar analogy makes&nbsp;us suppose that the fluid exerts force, in the same manner&nbsp;as when an active being impels the body before him ; therefore we call this the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Impulsion of a Fluid.</span><span class="font0"> And as our&nbsp;knowledge of nature teaches us that the mutual actions of&nbsp;bodies are in every case equal and opposite, and that the&nbsp;observed change of motion is only the indication and measure of the changing force, the forces are the same, whether&nbsp;we call them impulsions or resistances, when the relative&nbsp;motions are the same, and therefore depend entirely on&nbsp;these relative motions. The force, therefore, which is necessary for keeping a body immoveable in a stream of water flowing with a certain velocity, is the same with what</span></p>
