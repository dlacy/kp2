Much butter is made, both in dairy farms and by small landholders. Swine, which are reared in great numbers, are looked upon as a very profitable source of income. Goats are not common. The native breed of horses has little to recommend it, unless when improved by crosses from those of the neighbouring counties, in which more attention is paid to them. The maritime situation of the county is well adapted for increasing the quantity of human nutriment, in addition to that derived from agriculture. The bays abound with both round and flat fish. The herring visits the coast in large shoals, and the sun-fish and some species of whales are frequently seen in the offing. But this source of profitable industry is far from being rendered as productive as the natural capabilities of the place would lead us to infer. The want of capital paralyzes the exertions of the fisherman. As long as the boatmen were enabled to procure materials for the making and reparing of their craft, and for the purchase of the necessary fishing gear by the aid of bounties and loans, the occupation was profitable, and the numbers engaged in it increased annually, but since the withdrawing of those encouragements in 1830, the fisheries have retrograded, both as to numbers of men, and as to rate of profit. Of the larger fish, cod, hake, haddock, skate, and turbot, are the most abundant. Sprats are taken in great quantities. The Lissadill oyster is so much esteemed, that there is a regular demand for it in Dublin and other large towns. This fish, with many others of the shell kind, as lobsters, crabs, scallops, &amp;c., are found in many other parts of the coast. There are large and profitable salmon fisheries at Ballina, Sligo, and Bally- sadare ; and the numerous lakes and rivers supply the usual species of fresh water fish in equal abundance. The increase of agricultural improvement of late years is mainly attributable to the facilities for export afforded by the ports of Sligo and Ballina, but more especially the former, it being the great mart of commerce for the whole county, except its western districts, which, for the same purpose, take advantage of their vicinity to the latter. The statements relative to the external trade will be found in the subsequent description of the town and port of Sligo. The inland trade, in consequence of the want of communication by inland navigation or railroads, is confined to that of coarse cloths, woollens, and stockings from Connaught, and to the sale of linen, mostly for domestic use. The chief trade of this description is from Sligo town to Boyle in Roscommon, and thence, by the Shannon and the two canals, to more distant counties. A more confined traffic is carried on with Colooney. Among the late plans for stimulating national industry by inward channels of communication, it is proposed to carry a railroad from Sligo through Ballysadare, Colooney, and Drumsna to Longford, thence to be divided into two branches; 1st, by Granard, to join the proposed main railroad from Dublin to Enniskillen at Kells in Meath; 2d, through Mullingar, to join the proposed south-western railroad from Dublin to Kilkenny at Celbridge. No measures have been yet adopted to effect this plan.</p><p>The linen manufacture was introduced into the county so lately as the middle of the last century, when a number of weavers were located at Ballymote by Lord Shelburne. It continued to flourish for many years, but at length suffered, as in other parts, by the depression of the trade, and by the introduction of that of cotton; it is now reviving. Coarse woollens are made for domestic consumption. In the neighbourhood of the larger towns are several thriving tanneries, distilleries, and breweries; and the manufacture of flour has caused the erection of numerous mills, which prepare large quantities of grain, both for home consumption and export. The manufacture of kelp is nearly extinct.</p><p>There is a considerable number of resident gentry in the county in proportion to its size, and consequently many elegant mansions and well planted demesnes, which contribute more and more every year to diminish the former denuded appearance of the landscape, arising from the improvident destruction of its ancient timber. The houses of the smaller farmers are plain, but comfortable; but the cottages of the peasantry generally present indications of poverty. They are either of stone or mud, rudely thatched with straw or rushes. The food of the labouring classes are potatoes and oaten bread, with some milk and fish, and meat on extraordinary occasions. Fuel from the bogs is abundant. Coal, imported from Great Britain by the vessels which take in return cargoes of agricultural produce, is used in the larger towns, and by the respectable families in their vicinity ; but the high price precludes its general use throughout the county. The garments of the men are chiefly of home- manufactured wool, and so were those of the women until lately, when the native fabrics have been nearly supplanted by cheap cottons. Irish is scarcely spoken, except in some of the retired mountain tracts. Early marriages are much encouraged: they generally take place in the winter and spring. The rustic customs and amusements resemble those of the other north-western counties, in which the language and habits introduced from Scotland are less prevalent than in the eastern parts of Ulster.</p><p>There are numerous relics of ancient structures. A round tower at Drumcliff, in Carbery barony, differs from all others in Ireland, in being of smaller size, and inferior architecture. Near the church where it stands, are two stone crosses. On Knocknaree mountains are several cairns ; and in the same mountains, a deep valley, thickly planted and watered by several romantic falls, appears to have been formed by a violent organic shock, causing a fissure through the mountain. Some grottoes, hollowed out of the side of a hill near Carron, are of unknown antiquity. Near Sligo town is a cromlech, and a number of circular structures, popularly called giants’ graves. Near Castleconnor, in Tyreragh barony, are several vaults of a square form, whether built for cemeteries or storehouses, is uncertain. There are several remains of ancient castles. That of Knocknamoyle, crowning an elevated hill near Skreen, is supposed to have existed before the arrival of the English ; the others are thought to have been built since. Upwards of forty monastic buildings are noticed by antiquaries, the ruins of ten of which are still visible; eight others have been converted into parochial churches, but the remainder are known only by name, even the site of some of them being either doubtful or undiscoverable. Close to the ruins of an ancient chapel on Church Island, in Lough Gill, is a kind of chamber, or cavity, called the “ lady’s bed,” to which is attached the superstitious notion, that women who have lain in it will be preserved from the risk of death in child-bed. A well called Tubber-art, in Kilmacteige parish, has the character of performing cures in diseases that have set at defiance the ordinary resources of medicine.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sligo,</hi> the assize town of the county, became a place of importance by the building of a castle there, by the earl of Kildare, soon after the English settlement : its consequence was increased by the subsequent foundation of a Dominican monastery ; but its progress was subsequently much impeded by fires, and by the hostilities produced by the struggles for superiority between the English and the natives. It was incorporated and invested with the privileges of a parliamentary borough in 1613, and in 1621 obtained a charter of the staple. In the early period of the war of 1641, it was taken by the parliamentarians, under Sir Charles Coote, but after some time evacuated by them, and thence continued in the possession of the royalists till the termination of the war. In 1688 it declared in favour of King James, was taken for King William by the Enniskilleners, who, in turn, were driven out by General Sarsfield ; but the place ultimately surrendered to the earl of Granard.
