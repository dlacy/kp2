 in botany: A genus of the digynia order, belonging to the decandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 13th order, <hi rend="italic">Succulenta.</hi> The calyx is quinquepartite; the corolla pentapetalous; the capſule biroſtrated, unilocular, and polyſpermous.</p><p>There are 38 ſpecies oſ which the moſt remarkable are, 1. The granulata, or white ſaxifrage, which grows naturally in the meadows in many parts of England. The roots of this plant are like grains of corn, of a reddiſh colour without; from which ariſe kidney-ſhaped hairy leaves, ſtanding upon pretty long footſtalks. — The ſtalks are thick, a foot high, hairy, and furrowed: theſe branch out ſrom the bottom, and have a few ſmall leaves like thoſe below, which fit cloſe to the ſtalk: the flowers terminate the ſtalk, growing in ſmall cluſters; they have five white petals, incloſing ten ſtamina and the two ſtyles. There is a variety of this with double flowers, which is very ornamental. 2. The pyramidata, with a pyramidal ſtalk, grows naturally on the mountains of Italy. The leaves are tongue-ſhaped, gathered into heads, rounded at their points, and have cartilaginous and ſawed borders. The ſtalk riſes two feet and a half high, branching out near the ground, forming a natural pyramid to the top. The flowers have five white wedge-ſhaped petals, and ten ſtamina, placed circularly the length of the tube, terminated by roundiſh purple ſummits. When theſe plants are ſtrong, they produce very large pyramids of flowers, which make a fine appearance. 3. The punctata, commonly called <hi rend="italic">London pride,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">none-ſo-pretty,</hi> grows naturally on the Alps, and alſo in great plenty on a mountain of Ireland called <hi rend="italic">Mangerton,</hi> in the county of Kerry in that iſland. The roots of this are perennial; the leaves are oblong, oval, and placed circularly at bottom. They have broad, flat, furrowed foot-ſtalks, and are deeply crenated at their edges, which are white. The ſtalk riſes a foot high, is of a purple colour, ſtiff, ſlender, and hairy. It fends out from the fide on the upper part ſeveral ſhort foot-ſtalks, which are terminated by white flowers ſpotted with red. 4. The oppofitifolia, grows natural-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0690.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0684"/>
ly on the Alps, Pyrenees, and Helvetian mountains: it is alſo found pretty plentifully growing upon Ingleborough hill in Yorkſhire, Snowdon in Wales, and ſome other places. It is a perennial plant, with ſtalks trailing upon the ground, and are ſeldom more than two inches long, garniſhed with ſmall oval leaves ſtanding oppoſite, which lie over one another like the ſcales of fiſh: they are of a brown green colour, and have a reſemblance of heath. The flowers are produced at the end of the branches, of a deep blue; and thus make a pretty appearance during their continuance, which is great part of March and the beginning of April. All theſe ſpecies are eaſily propagated by offsets, or by parting their roots.</p><p><note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Coxe's Travels into Denmark.</hi></p></note> S <hi rend="smallcaps">AXO-Grammaticus,</hi> deſcended from an illuſtrious Daniſh<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> Some authors have erroneouſly conjectured, from his name Saxo, that he was born in Saxony; but Saxe was no uncommon appellation among the ancient Danes. See Olaus Wormius <hi rend="italic">Monumenta Danica,</hi> p. 185, and Stephens’s <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi>, p. 10.</p></note> (<hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>) family, was born about the middle of the 12th century. Stephens, in his edition of Saxo-Grammaticus, printed at Soroë, indubitably proves, that he muſt have been alive in 1156, but cannot aſcertain the exact place and time of his birth. See Stephens’s <hi rend="italic">Prolegomena</hi> to the Notes on Saxo-Grammaticus, p. 8, to 24; alſo Holberg, vol. i. p. 269.; and Mallet’s North. Antiq. vol. i. p. 4. On account of his uncommon learning, Saxo was diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi rend="italic">Grammaticus.</hi> He was provoſt of the cathedral church of Roſkild, and warmly patronized by the learned and warlike Abſalon, the celebrated archbiſhop of Lunden, at whoſe inſtigation he wrote the Hiſtory of Denmark. His epitaph, a dry panegyric in bad Latin verſes, gives no account of the era of his death, which happened, according to Stephens, in 1204. His hiſtory, conſiſting of 16 books, begins from the earlieſt account of the Daniſh annals, and concludes with the year 1186.<note anchored="false" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"></hi> Holberg.</p></note> According to the opinion of an accurate writer, the firſt part, which relates to the origin of the Danes, and the reigns of the ancient kings, is full of fables; but the eight laſt books, and particularly thoſe which regard the events of his own times, deferve the utmoſt credit. He wrote in</p><p>Latin; the ſtyle, if we conſider the barbarous age in which he flouriſhed, is in general extremely elegant, but rather too poetical for hiſtory. Mallet, in his <hi rend="italic">Hiſtoire de Dannemarc,</hi> vol. i. p. 182, ſays, “that Sperling, a writer of great erudition, has proved, in contradiction to the aſſertions of Stephens and others, that Saxo- Grammaticus was ſecretary to Abſalon; and that the Saxo provoſt of Roſkild was another perſon, and lived earlier.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
