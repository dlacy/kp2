<p><span class="font1">REFINING, in general, is the art of purifying a thing ; including not only the effaying or refining of&nbsp;metals, but likewiſe the depuration or clarification of&nbsp;liquors. See Metallurgy, Part II. Clarification;&nbsp;and Pharmacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gold and ſilver may be refined by ſeveral methods, which are all founded on the effential properties of theſe&nbsp;metals, and acquire different names according to their&nbsp;kinds. Thus, for inſtance, gold having the property&nbsp;which no other metal, not even filver, has of reſiſting&nbsp;the action of ſulphur, of antimony, of nitrous acid, of&nbsp;marine acid; may be purified by theſe agents from all&nbsp;other metallic ſubſtances, and conſequently may be re-fined. Theſe operations are diſtinguiſhed by proper&nbsp;names, as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">purification oſ gold by antimony, parting, concentrated parting, dry parting *.</span><span class="font1"> In a fimilar manner, as&nbsp;filver has the property, which the imperfect metals&nbsp;have not, of reſiſting the action of nitre, it may be refined by this ſalt : but the term </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">refining</span><span class="font1"> is chiefly applied to the purification of gold and filver by lead in&nbsp;the cupel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This is performed by the deſtruction, vitrification, and ſcorification, of all the extraneous and deſtructible&nbsp;metallic ſubſtances with which they are all allayed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As none but the perfect metals can refill: tlie combined action of air and fire, without loſing their inflammable principle, and being changed into earthy or vitreous matters, incapable of remaining any longer united with ſubſtances in a metallic ſtate, there is then a&nbsp;poſſibility of purifying gold and ſilver from all allay of&nbsp;imperfect metals merely by the action of fire and air ;&nbsp;only by keeping them fuſed till all die allay be deſtroy-ed : but this purification would be very expenſive, from&nbsp;the great conſumption of fuel, and would be exceedingly&nbsp;tedious. Silver allayed with copper has been expofed&nbsp;longer than 60 hours to a glaſs-houſe fire -without being perfectly refined the reaſon of which is, that&nbsp;when a fmall quantity only of imperfect metal remains&nbsp;united with gold or filver, it is covered and protected&nbsp;from the action of the air, which is neceſſary for the&nbsp;combuſtion of the imperfect metals, as of all comhuſti-ble matters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This refining of gold'and ſilver merely by the action of fire·, which was the only method anciently known,&nbsp;was very long, difficult, expenſive, and imperfect ; but&nbsp;a much ſhorter and more advantageous method has been&nbsp;diſcovered. This method conſiſts in adding to the al-layed gold and ſilver a certain quantity of lead, and in&nbsp;expofing afterwards this mixture to the action of the&nbsp;ſire. Lead is one of the metals which lofes moſt&nbsp;quickly and eaſily a ſufficient quantity of its inflammable&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">principle to ceaſe te be in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">metallic ſtate·; but<sub>z</sub> at thς&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ſame time, this metal has the remarkable property of&nbsp;retaining, notwithſtanding the action of the ſire, enough&nbsp;of this ſame inflammable principle to be very eaſily&nbsp;melted into a vitrified and powerfully vitrifying matter,&nbsp;called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">litharge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The lead then which is to be added to the gold and ſilver to be refined, or which happens naturally to be&nbsp;mixed with theſe metals, produces in their refining the&nbsp;following advantages: 1. By increafing the proportion'&nbsp;of imperfect metals, it prevents them from being fo&nbsp;well covered and protected by the perfect metals.—-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2. </span><span class="font1">By uniting with theſe imperfect metals, it commu-nicates to them a property it has of lofing very eaſily a&nbsp;great part of its inflammable principle. 3. By its vitrifying and fufing property which it exereifes with all&nbsp;its force upon the calcined and naturally refractory parts&nbsp;of the other metals, it facilitates and accelerates the fuſion, the ſcoriſication, and thc ſeparation of thefe metals. Theſe are the advantages procured by lead in the&nbsp;refining of gold and ſilver.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The lead, which in this operation is ſcorified, and' fcorifies along with it the imperfect metals, ſeparates -from the metallic maſs, with which it is then incapable&nbsp;of remaining united. It floats upon the ſurface of the&nbsp;melted maſs ; becauſe, by loſing part of its phlogiſ-ton, it lofes alſo part of its ſpecific gravity, and laſtly&nbsp;it vitrifies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thefe vitrified and melted 'matters accumulating more and more upon the ſurface of the metal while thc&nbsp;operation advances, would protect this ſurface from the&nbsp;contact of air which is ſo abſolutely neceſſary for the&nbsp;ſcorification of the reſt, and would thus ſtop the pro-greſs of the operation, which could never be ſiniſhed, if&nbsp;a method had not been contrived for their removal. This&nbsp;removal of the vitrified matter is procured either by the&nbsp;nature of the veſſel in which the melted matter is contained, and which being porous, abſorbs and imbibes&nbsp;the ſcorified matter as faſt as it is formed, or by a chan-,&nbsp;nel cut in the edge, of the veſſel through which the&nbsp;matter flows out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The veſſel in which the refining is performed is flat* and ſhallow, that the matter which it contains may prefent to the air the greateſt ſurface poſſible. This form&nbsp;reſembles that of a cup, and hence it lias been called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cupel.</span><span class="font1"> The furnace ought to be vaulted, that the heat&nbsp;may be applied upon the'ſurſace of the metal during&nbsp;thc whole time- of the operation. Upon this furface a&nbsp;cruſt of dark-coloured pellicle is continually forming.&nbsp;In the inſtant when all the imperfect metal is deftroyed&gt;&nbsp;and conſequently the ſcorification ceaſes, the ſurface of&nbsp;the perfect metals is ſeen, and appears clean and brilliant. This forms a kind of fulguration or coruſ-cation. By this mark the metal is known to be refinedt&nbsp;If the operation be ſo conducted that the metal ſuſtains only the preciſe degree of heat neceſſary to keep&nbsp;it fuſed before it be perfectly refined, we may obſerve&nbsp;that it fixes or becomes ſolid all at once in the very in-ſtant of the eoruſcation ; becauſe a greater heat is re*&nbsp;quired to&gt; keep ſilver or gold in fuſion when they are&nbsp;pure than when allayed with lead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ί he operation of refining may be performed m finall or in large quantities, upon the fame principles, but&nbsp;only with ſome differences in the management. As the&nbsp;refining of final! quantities of perfect metals is perform</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ed in the ſame maimer as theſe metals are </span><span class="font1">eſſay ed,· thé</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
