In this story are observable the ancient rights of kindred and redemption ; and the manner of buying the inheritance of the deceased, with other particulars of great note and antiquity. The canonicalness of this book was never disputed ; but the learned are not agreed about the epoch of the history which it relates. Ruth the Moabitcss is found in the genealogy of our Saviour. (Matt. i. 5.)</p><p>RUTHERGLEN, or by contraction Rugi.en, the head burgh of the nether ward of Lanarkshire, in Scotland, is situated about two miles south-east of Glasgow, and nine west of Hamilton. Few towns in Scotland can lay claim to greater antiquity than Rutherglen. It was erected into a royal burgh by King David I. about the year 1126.</p><p>The territory under the jurisdiction of the burgh was extensive, and the inhabitants enjoyed many distinguished privileges, which were, however, gradually wrested from them by political influence in favour of Glasgow, which in latter times rose into consequence by trade and manufactures. The ancient dimensions of the place are now unknown ; but in the fields and gardens towards the east, the foundations of houses are occasionally discovered.</p><p>About a hundred and fifty yards to the south of the main street is a kind of lane, known by the name of <hi rend="italic">Dins-dykes. </hi>This place has acquired an opprobrious celebrity, from the circumstance which befell the unfortunate Queen Mary when her forces were routed at the battle of Langside. Her majesty, who, during the battle, stood on a rising ground about a mile from Rutherglen, no sooner saw her army defeated, than she took her precipitate flight to the south. Dins-dykes unluckily lay in her way. Two rustics, who were at that instant cutting grass hard" by, seeing her majesty flying in haste, rudely attempted to intercept her, and threatened to cut her in pieces with their scythes if she presumed to proceed a step further. Neither beauty nor royalty would have secured her escape, had not some of her followers come to her relief.</p><p>Adjoining to a lane called the <hi rend="italic">Bach-row</hi>  stood the castle of Rutherglen, originally built at a period coeval, it is reported, with the foundation of the town. This ancient fortress underwent several sieges during the unhappy wars in the days of King Robert Bruce, and it remained a place of strength until the battle of Langside ; soon after which it was destroyed by order of the regent, to revenge himself on the Hamilton family, in whose custody it then was. The foundations of the buildings are now erased, and the site converted into dwelling-houses and gardens.</p><p>Rutherglen, in conjunction with Renfrew, Dumbarton, Kilmarnock, and Port-Glasgow, sends a member to the British parliament. The fairs of this town are generally well attended, and have long been famous for a great show of horses, of the Lanarkshire breed, which are esteemed the best draught-horses in Britain. The inhabitants of this borough still retain some customs of a very remote antiquity. One of these is the making of <hi rend="italic">Rutherglen sour cakes. </hi>The operation is attended with some peculiar rites, which lead us to conclude that the practice is of Pagan origin. In</p><p>1821 the population of Rutherglen was about 1800, and including the parish it was 4640 ; in 1831 that of the town and parish was 5503.</p><p>RUTHIN, a borough and market town of the county of Denbigh, within the parish of Ruabon. It was formerly surrounded with walls, which are dilapidated ; but it now consists of only one long street. It ls governed by four aldermen and twelve councillors. There are markets, which are held on Mondays and Saturdays. The population amounted in 1801 to 1115, in 1811 to 1292, in 1821 to 1294, and in 1831 to 3376. The apparent increase on the last census arises from the parish of Llanfurog being then, but not before, included in that of the town.</p><p>RUTLAMGUR, a town of Hindustan, in the Mahratta territories, and province of Malwah, forty-seven miles north-north-west from Oojain. Long. 75. 26. E. Lat. 28. 46. N.</p><p>RUTLANDSHIRE, an English county, nearly in the centre of the kingdom, and the smallest of all the divisions so denominated. It is bounded by Lincolnshire on the east and north-east, by Leicestershire on the north-west and west, and by Northamptonshire on the south. Its length from north to south is sixteen, and its breadth from east to west is twelve miles. The square contents are 149 square statute miles, or 95,360 acres. It is divided into five hundreds, and contains two market-towns, Uppingham and Okeham, and forty-nine parishes ; being a greater number, in proportion to its extent, than any other county in the kingdom.</p><p>It gives only one title at present, that of duke, to the family of Manners ; two former peerages, that of Ferrars of Okeham, and Noel of Exton, being extinct. Only two members are returned to the House of Commons from the county, and none from either of the towns. In judicial affairs it is on the midland circuit of the judges ; and in'ec-clesiastical matters it has formed, since the year 1541, a portion of the bishopric of Peterborough.</p><p>The appearance of this small county is pleasing to the traveller. It is much diversified by ranges of moderate hills running from east to west, in some parts well timbered. Betw<hi rend="sup">r</hi>een these ranges of hills, the valleys, of about half a mile in breadth, are luxuriant and verdant. The principal vale, called Catmose, is in the centre of the county, having to the north a tract of table-land overlooking the well-wooded plains of Leicester, Lincoln, and Nottinghamshire. The eastern part is more diversified ; the southern division of it consisting of a beautiful valley, stretching towards Northamptonshire, and the western, bordering on Leicestershire; being abundantly wooded.</p><p>The soil on the eastern and south-eastern parts is chiefly shallow, resting upon a basis of limestone, composed of clays and loams. The other parts consist principally of a tenacious but fertile loam ; but the vale of Catmose enjoys a most fertile soil of good clay, or red loam, or a grateful mixture of both these earths. A peculiarity of the soil is a redness, which generally prevails, and which tinges all the waters of the country.</p><p>Mr Parkinson, surveyor for the Board of Agriculture, estimates the land of the county in the following manner, viz. pasture land, 34,861 acres; arable land, 42,536; wastes, 30; woods, 2815 ; meadows, 9356; commons, 693; plantations, 65 ; lakes and ponds, 44 acres.</p><p>The woods of this county were far more extensive in former ages than they are at present. The ancient forest of Leafield, and the chase of Beaumont, though now<hi rend="sup">r</hi> under the plough, once occupied a great portion of the surface. The climate is generally accounted peculiarly soft and healthy ; and the elevation is of that medium kind which equally exempts it from the pernicious effects of moist ex-, halations and cold mountain fogs.</p><p>The agriculture, though it has partaken of some modern , improvements, is not, upon the whole, conducted in the</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
