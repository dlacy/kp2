<p><span class="font1">College, London; at Heidelberg he worked at German; at Berlin he studied psychology, metaphysics and also physiology&nbsp;under du Bois-Reymond, and heard lectures on Hegel, Kant&nbsp;and the history of philosophy, ancient and modern. After&nbsp;two months at Göttingen, he went to Paris in June 1863. In&nbsp;the same year he returned to Aberdeen and helped Alexander&nbsp;Bain with the revision of some of his books. In 1864 he was&nbsp;appointed to help Professor Geddes with his Greek classes,&nbsp;but he gave up the vacations to philosophical work. In 1866&nbsp;he was appointed professor of philosophy of mind and logic&nbsp;at University College, London. This post he retained until&nbsp;ill-health compelled him to resign a few months before his&nbsp;death in 1892. He lectured on logic, deductive and inductive,&nbsp;systematic psychology and ethical theory. He left little&nbsp;published work. A comprehensive work on Hobbes was&nbsp;never completed, though part of the materials were used for&nbsp;an article in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</span><span class="font1"> and another portion&nbsp;was published as one of Blackwood’s “ Philosophical Classics.”&nbsp;Together with Bain, he edited Grote’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aristotle,</span><span class="font1"> and was&nbsp;the editor of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mind</span><span class="font1"> from its foundation in 1876 till 1891. He&nbsp;was keenly interested in German philosophy, and took every&nbsp;opportunity of making German works on EngUsh writers&nbsp;known in the United Kingdom. In philosophy he followed&nbsp;mainly Mill and Bain, but he was acquainted with aII philosophical literature. He was associated with his wife (a&nbsp;daughter of Mr Justice Crompton) in many kinds of social&nbsp;work; he sat on the Committee of the NationaI Society for&nbsp;Women’s Suffrage, and was actively associated with its president, John Stuart Mill. He warmly supported the admission&nbsp;of women students to University College.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBERTSON, JOSEPH (1810-1866), Scottish antiquary, was born at Aberdeen on the 17th of May 1810, the son of a&nbsp;small shopkeeper. He was educated in Marischal College in&nbsp;Aberdeen and was for some years engaged in Uterary and newspaper work there and in Glasgow and Edinburgh. In 1839&nbsp;he helped to found the Spalding Club, organized to pubUsh the&nbsp;historical, genealogical, topographical and Uterary remains of&nbsp;the north-eastern counties of Scotland, and he edited eight&nbsp;of its thirty-eight volumes. In 1853 he was appointed curator&nbsp;of the historical and antiquarian department of the General&nbsp;Register House, Edinburgh, hitherto a subordinate and unimportant office, but which, in his hands, became of the first&nbsp;consequence to the interests of antiquarian Uterature in Scotland.&nbsp;His inventory of the personal property and jewels of Mary Queen&nbsp;of Scots, prefaced by a paper of great learning and research,&nbsp;and his essays on Scottish architecture, preceded his greatest&nbsp;work, published by the Bannatyne Club (r866), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Concilia&nbsp;Scotiae, Ecclesiae Scoticanae Statuta.</span><span class="font1"> In 1864 the University&nbsp;of Edinburgh conferred upon him the honorary degree of LL.D.&nbsp;He died on the 13th of December 1866.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBERTSON, THOMAS WILLIAM (1829-1871), English actor and dramatist, was bom at Newark on the 9th of January&nbsp;1829. As a dramatist he had a brief but very brilUant career.&nbsp;The son of a provincial actor and manager, chief of a “ circuit ”&nbsp;that ranged from Bristol to Cambridge, Robertson was familiar&nbsp;with the stage from his childhood; he was the eldest of a large&nbsp;family, the actress Margaret (Madge) Robertson (Mrs Kendal)&nbsp;being the youngest. His success came late. A farcical comedy&nbsp;by him, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A NighFs Adventure,</span><span class="font1"> was produced at the Olympic&nbsp;under Farren’s management as early as 1851, but this did not&nbsp;make good his footing, and he remained for some years longer&nbsp;in the provinces, varying his work as an actor with miscellaneous&nbsp;contributions to newspapers. In i860 he went to London, and&nbsp;edited a mining journal to which he contributed a novel afterwards dramatized with the title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shadow Tree Shaft.</span><span class="font1"> He was&nbsp;at one time prompter at the Olympic under the management&nbsp;of Charles Mathews. He wrote a farce entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Cantab,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which was played at the Strand Theatre in 1861. This brought&nbsp;him a reputation in a Bohemian clique, but so Uttle practical&nbsp;assistance that he thought of abandoning the profession to&nbsp;become a tobacconist. Then, in 1864, came his first marked&nbsp;success, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">DaM Garrick,</span><span class="font1"> produced at the Haymarket with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Edward Sothern in the principal character. It was not, however, till the production of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Society</span><span class="font1"> at the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1865, under the management of Miss Marie Wilton,&nbsp;afterwards Mrs Bancroft, that the originality and cleverness&nbsp;of the dramatist were fully recognized. Play-writer and&nbsp;company were exactly suited one to another; the plays and&nbsp;the acting together—the small size of the playhouse being&nbsp;also in their favour—were at once recognized as a new thing.&nbsp;Although some critics sneered at the “ cup-and-saucer comedy,”&nbsp;voted it absurdly realistic, said there was nothing in it but&nbsp;commonplace Ufe represented without a trace of Sheridanian&nbsp;wit and sparkle, all London flocked to the Uttle house in Tottenham Street, and the stage was at once inundated with imitations&nbsp;of the new style of acting and the new kind of play. Robertson,&nbsp;although his health was already undermined, rapidly foUowed&nbsp;up </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Society</span><span class="font1"> with a series of characteristic plays which made&nbsp;the reputation of himself, the company and the theatre. All&nbsp;his best known plays (except </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">DaM Garrick)</span><span class="font1"> were written&nbsp;for the old Prince of Wales’s under the Bancrofts, and that&nbsp;régime is now an historical incident in the progress of the&nbsp;English stage. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ours</span><span class="font1"> was produced </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font1">1866, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caste</span><span class="font1"> in 1867,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Play</span><span class="font1"> in r868, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">School</span><span class="font1"> in 1869, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">M.P.</span><span class="font1"> in 1870. Unhappily, Robertson enjoyed his success for but a short time. He died in London&nbsp;on the 3rd of February 1871. His work is notable for its&nbsp;masterly stagecraft, wholesome and generous humour, bright&nbsp;and unstrained dialogue, and high dramatic sense of human&nbsp;character in its theatrical aspects.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROBERTSON, WILLIAM (1721-1793), Scottish historian, born at Borthwick, Mid Lothian, on the 19th of September 1721,&nbsp;was the eldest son of the Rev. WilUam Robertson. He was&nbsp;educated at the school of Dalkeith and the university of&nbsp;Edinburgh. He was from the first intended for the ministry;&nbsp;in 1743 he was presented to the Uving of Gladsmuir in East&nbsp;Lothian, and two years later he lost both his father and his&nbsp;mother, who died within a few hours of each other. The&nbsp;support and education of a younger brother and six sisters then&nbsp;devolved upon him, though at that time his income was less&nbsp;than £100 a year. Robertson’s inclination for study was never&nbsp;allowed to interfere with his duties as a parish minister, and&nbsp;his power as a preacher had made him a local celebrity while&nbsp;still a young man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His energy and decision of character were brought out vividly by the rebellion of 1745. When Edinburgh seemed in danger&nbsp;of falUng into the hands of the rebels he joined the volunteers&nbsp;in the capital. When the city was surrendered he was one of&nbsp;the small band who repaired to Haddington and offered their&nbsp;services to the commander of the royal forces. Such a man&nbsp;could not remain in obscurity, and in 1746 he was elected a&nbsp;member of the General Assembly, where his influence as leader&nbsp;of the “ moderate ” party was for many years nearly supreme,&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Presbyteriaxism).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During all this period of prominent activity in the pubUc life of Edinburgh, Robertson was busy with his historical&nbsp;labours. His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Scotland,</span><span class="font1"> begun in 1753, was pubUshed&nbsp;in 1759. Till he had finished his book Robertson had never&nbsp;left his native country; but the pubUcation of his history&nbsp;necessitated a journey to London, and he passed the early&nbsp;months of the year 1758 partly in the capital and partly in&nbsp;leisurely rambles in the counties of England. The success of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Scotland</span><span class="font1"> was immediate, and within a month a&nbsp;second edition was called for. Before the end of the author’s&nbsp;life the book had reached its fourteenth edition; and it soon&nbsp;brought him other rewards than Uterary fame. In 1759 he&nbsp;was appointed chaplain of Stirling Castle, in 1761 one of His&nbsp;Majesty’s chaplains in ordinary, and in 1762 he was chosen&nbsp;principal of the university of Edinburgh. In May 1763 he&nbsp;was elected Moderator of the General Assembly, and in August&nbsp;of the same year the office of king’s historiographer was revived&nbsp;in his favour with a salary of £200 a year.</span></p>
