<p><span class="font0">died John elector of </span><span class="font2">Saxony, who was ſucceeded by his ſon John Frederic, a prince of invincible fortitude and&nbsp;magnanimity, but whoſe reign was little better than&nbsp;one continued train of diſappointments and calamities.&nbsp;The religious truce, however, gave new vigour to the&nbsp;reformation. Thofe who had hitherto been only ſe-cret enemies to the Roman pontiff, now publicly threw&nbsp;off his yoke ; and various cities and provinces of Gcr-jnany enliſted themſelves under the religious ſtandards&nbsp;of Luther. Οη the other hand, as the emperor had&nbsp;now no other hope of terminating the religious diſputes Éut by the meeting of a general council, he repeated his requeſts to the pope for that purpoſe. The&nbsp;pontiff (Clement VII.), whom the hiſtory of paſtcoun-cils filled with the greateſt uneaſineſs, endeavoured to&nbsp;retard what he could not with decency refuſe, At laſt,&nbsp;in 1533, he made a propoſal by his legate to affemble&nbsp;a council at Mantua, Placentia, or Bologna ; but the&nbsp;Proteſtants refuſed their conſent to the nomination of&nbsp;an Italian council, and inſiſted that a controverſy which&nbsp;had its riſe in the heart of Germany, ſhould be deter-mined within the limits of the empire. The pope, by&nbsp;his uſual artifices, eluded the performance of his own&nbsp;promife ; and, in 1534, was cut off by death, in the&nbsp;midſt of his ſtratagems. His ſucceffor Paul III. feem-ed to ſhow leſs reluctance to the aſſembling a general&nbsp;council, and in the year 1535 expreſſed his inclination&nbsp;to convoke one at Mantua ; and, the year following,&nbsp;actually ſent circular letters for that purpoſe through&nbsp;all the ſtates and kingdoms under his juriſdiction. Tin’s&nbsp;council was ſummoned by a bull iſſued out on the 2d&nbsp;of June 1536, to meet at Mantua the following year&nbsp;but ſeveral obſtacles prevented its meeting; one of the&nbsp;moſt material of which was, that Frederic duke of&nbsp;Mantua had no inclination to receive at once ſo many&nbsp;gueſts, ſome of them very turbulent, into the place of&nbsp;his reſidence. Οη the other hand, the Proteſtants were&nbsp;firmly perſuaded that, as the council was aſſembled in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Italy, and by the authority of the pope alone, the lat-ter muſt have had an undue influence in that aſſembly ; of conſequence, that all things muſt have been carried&nbsp;by the votaries of Rome. For this reaſon they aſſem-bled at Smalcald in the year 1537, where they folemn-ly proteſted againſt this partial and corrupt council,&nbsp;and, at the ſame time, had a new ſummary of their&nbsp;doctrine drawn up by Luther, in order to preſent it&nbsp;to the aſſembled biſhops if it ſhould be required of&nbsp;them. This fummary, which had the title of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Articles oſ Smalcald,</span><span class="font2"> is commonly joined with the creeds&nbsp;and confeſſions of the Lutheran church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After the meeting of the general council in Man-tua was thus prevented, many ſchemes of accommodation were propoſed both by the emperor and the Proteſtants ; but, by the artifices of the church of&nbsp;Rome, all of them came ≠o nothing. In 1541, the&nbsp;emperor appointed a conference at worms on the ſubject of religion, between perſons of piety and learning&nbsp;choſen from the contending parties. This conference,&nbsp;however, was, for certain reaſons, removed to the diet&nbsp;which was to be held at Ratiſhon that fame year, and&nbsp;in which the principal ſubject of deliberation was a me-morial preſented by a perſon unknown, containing a&nbsp;project of peace. But the conference produced no other&nbsp;effect than a mutual agreement of the contending par</span><span class="font1">ties </span><span class="font2">to </span><span class="font1">refer their matters to a general council, or, if</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the meeting of ſuch a council ſhould be prevented, to </span><span class="font2">the next German diet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This refolution was rendered ineffectual by a variety of incidents, which widened the breach, and put off to a farther day the deliberations which were de-ſigned to heal it. The pope ordered his legate to&nbsp;declare to the diet of Spire, aſſembled in 1542, that&nbsp;he would, according to the promiſe he had already&nbsp;made, aſſemble a general council, and that Trent&nbsp;ſhould be the place of its meeting, if the diet had no&nbsp;objection to that city. Ferdinand, and the princes&nbsp;who adhered to the cauſe of the pope, gave their conſent to this propoſal ; but it was vehemently objected&nbsp;to by the Proteſtants,. both becauſe the council was&nbsp;ſummoned by the authority of the pope only, and al-ſo becauſe the place was within the juriſdiction of the&nbsp;Pope; whereas they deſired a free council, which&nbsp;ſhould not be biaſſed by the dictates, nor awed by&nbsp;the proximity, of the pontiff. But this proteſtation&nbsp;produced no effect. Paul III. perſiſted in his purpoſe,&nbsp;and iſſued. out his circular letters for the convocation of&nbsp;the council, with the approbation of the emperor. In&nbsp;juſtice to this pontiff, however, it muſt be obſerved,&nbsp;that he ſhowed himſelf not to be averſe to every reformation. He appointed four cardinals, and three other&nbsp;perſons eminent for their learning, to draw up a plan&nbsp;for the reformation of the church in general, and of the&nbsp;church of Rome in particular. The reformation propoſed in this plan was indeed extremely fuperficial and&nbsp;partial, yet it contained fome particulars which could&nbsp;ſcarcely have been expected from thoſe who compoſed&nbsp;it. They complained of the pride and ignorance of the&nbsp;biſhops, and propoſed that none ſhould receive orders but&nbsp;learned and pious men ; and that therefore care ſhould&nbsp;be taken to have proper maſters for the inſtruction of&nbsp;youth. They condemned tranſlations from one benefice to another, grants of reſervation, non-reſidence, and&nbsp;pluralities. They propoſed that ſome convents ſhould&nbsp;be aboliſhed ; that the liberty of the preſs ſhould be re-ſtrained and limited ; that the colloquies of Eraſmus&nbsp;ſhould be ſuppreffed ; that no eccleſiaſtic ſhould enjoy&nbsp;a benefice out of his own country ; that no cardinal&nbsp;fnould have a biſhopric ; that the queſtors of St Anthony and ſeveral other ſaints' ſhould be aboliſhed ;&nbsp;and, which was the beſt of all their propoſals, that the&nbsp;effects and perſonal eſtates of eccleſiaſtics ſhonld be given to the poor. They concluded with complaining&nbsp;of the prodigious number of indigent and ragged prieſts&nbsp;who frequented St Peter’s church ; and declared, that&nbsp;it was a great fcandal to fee the whores lodged fo magnificently at Rome, and riding through the ſtreets on .&nbsp;fine mules, while the cardinals and other eccleſiaſtics&nbsp;accompanied them in the moſt courteous manner.—&nbsp;This plan of reformation was turned into ridicule by&nbsp;Luther and Sturmius ; and indeed it left unredreffed&nbsp;the moſt intolerable grievances of which the Proteſtants&nbsp;complained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All this time the emperor had been labouring to perfuade the Proteſtants to conſent to the meeting of&nbsp;the council at Trent ; but when he found them fixed&nbsp;in their oppoſition to this meaſure, he began to liſten&nbsp;to the ſanguinary meaſures of the pope, and refolved&nbsp;to terminate the diſputes by force of arms. The elec-tor of Saxony and landgrave of HeiΓe, who were the&nbsp;chief ſupporters of the Proteſtant cauſe, upon this took</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
