                <p><label>ROBIN HOOD</label> English legendary hero. The oldest mention of Robin
                    Hood at present known occurs in the second edition— what is called the B text—of
                        <hi rend="italic">Piers the Plowman,</hi> the date of which is about 1377.
                    In passus v. of that poem the figure of Sloth is represented as saying—</p>
               <p>“ 1 can noujte perfitly my pater-noster, as the prest it syngeth: But I can
                    rymes of Robyn Hood and Randolf Erle of Chestre."</p>
               <p>He is next mentioned by Andrew of Wyntoun in his <hi rend="italic">Original
                        Chronicle of Scatlatid,</hi> written about 1420—</p>
               <p>“ Lytel Jhon and Robyne Hude Waythmen ware commendyd gude;</p>
               <p>In Yngilwode and Barnysdale</p>
               <p>Thai oysyd all this time [c. 1283] thare trawale ";</p>
               <p>next by Walter Bower in his additions of Fordun’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Scotichro-nicon</hi> about 1450—</p>
               <p>“ Hoc in tempore [1266] de exheredatis et bannitis surrexit et caput erexit ille
                    famosissimus sicarius Robertus Hode et Littill Johanne cum eorum complicibus, de
                    quibus stolidum vulgus hianter in comoediis et tragoediis prurienter restum
                    faciunt et super ceteras romancias, mimos, er bardanos cantitare delectantur.”</p>
               <p>’ Of his popularity in the latter half of the 15th and in the 16th centuries
                    there are many signs. Just one passage must be quoted as of special importance
                    because closely followed by R. Grafton, J. Stow and W. Camden. It is from John
                    Mair’s <hi rend="italic">Historia Majoris Britanniae lam Angliae quarn
                        Scotiae,</hi> which appeared in 1521—</p>
               <p>“ Circa haec tempora [Ricardi Primi], ut auguror, Robertus Hudus Anglus et
                    Parvus Joannes Iatrones famatissimi in nemoribus Iatuerunt, solum Opulentorum
                    virorum bona deripientes. Nullum nisi, eos invadentem vel resistentem pro suarum
                    rerum tuitione occiderunt. Centum sagittarios ad pugnam aptissimos Robertus
                    Iatrociniis aluit, quos 400 viri fortissimi invadere non audebant. <hi
                        rend="italic">Rebus hujus Roberti gestis tola Britannia in cantibus Utitur <hi rend="sub">t</hi></hi> Faeminam nullam opprimi permisit nec pauperum bona surripuit, verum eos ex
                    abbatum bonis sublatis opipare pa vit. Viri rapinam improbo, sed Iatronum omnium
                    humanissimus et princeps erat."</p>
               <p>In the Elizabethan era and afterwards mentions abound; see the works of
                    Shakespeare, Sidney, Ben Jonson, Drayton, Warner, A. Munday, Camden, Stow,
                    Braithwaite, Fuller, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Of the ballads themselves, <hi rend="italic">RobinHood and the Monk</hi> is
                    possibly as old as the reign of Edward II. (see Thomas Wright’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Essays on England in the Middle Ages,</hi> ii. 174); <hi
                        rend="italic">Robin Hood and the Potter</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Robyn and
                        Gandelyn</hi> are certainly not later than the 15th century. Most important
                    of all is A <hi rend="italic">Lytell Geste of Robyn Hode,</hi> which was first
                    printed about 1510 (see A. W. Pollard’s <hi rend="italic">Fifteenth Century
                        Prose and Verse,</hi> Westminster, 1903). This is evidently founded on older
                    ballads; we read in <hi rend="italic">The Seconde Fytte,</hi>
                    11. 176 and 177—</p>
               <p>“ He wente hym forthe full mery syngynge,</p>
               <p>As men have told in tale.”</p>
               <p>In fact, it does for the Robin Hood cycle what a few years before Sir Thomas
                    Malory had done for the Arthurian romances —what in the 6th century <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> Peisistratus is said to have done for the Homeric
                    poems.</p>
               <p>These are the facts about him and his balladry. Of conjectures there is no end.
                    Hc has been represented as the last of the Saxons—as a Saxon holding out against
                    the Norman conquerors so late as the end of the 12th century (see Augustin
                    Thierry’s <hi rend="italic">Norman Conquest,</hi> and compare Sir Walter Scott’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Ivanhoe).</hi> J. M. Gutch maintains that he was a
                    follower of Simon de Montfort. The Rev. Joseph Hunter associated him with the
                    rebel earl of Lancaster of Edward II.’s time. This scholar in a brochure
                    published in 1852 produced evidence from the exchequer accounts and the court
                    rolls of the manor of Wakefield showing that a “ Robyn Hod ” and a “ Robertus
                    Hood ” were living in this reign. The series of coincidences to which he points
                    is undoubtedly striking, but had failed to convince most critics. Professor F.
                    J. Child dismisses his inferences as “ ludicrous.”</p>
               <p>For our part, we are not disinclined to believe that the Robin Hood story has
                    some historical basis, however fanciful and romantic the superstructure. We
                    parallel it with the Arthurian story, and hold that, just as there was probably
                    a real Arthur, however different from the hero of the trouvères, so there was a
                    real Hood, however now enlarged and (Iisguisedbythe accretions of legend. That
                    Charlemagne and Richard I. of England became the subjects
                    of romances does not prevent our believing in their existence; nor need Hood’s
                    mythical life deprive him of his natural one. Sloth in Langland’s poem couples
                    him, as we have seen, with Randle, earl of Chester; and no one doubts this
                    nobleman’s existence because he had “ rymes ” made about him. We believe him to
                    have been the third Randle (see Bishop Percy’s Folio MS., ed. Hales and
                    Furnivall, i. 260). And possibly enough Hood was contemporary with that earl,
                    who “ flourished ” in the reigns of Richard L, John and Henry IIL Wyntoun and
                    Mair, as we have seen, assign him to that period. It is impossible to believe
                    with Hunter that he lived so late as Edward II.’s reign. This would leave no
                    time for the growth</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0421" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0454.jp2"/>
               <p>of his myth; and his myth was, as is evident from what we have already said and
                    quoted, full-grown in the first half of the 14th century. Whatever may have been
                    the immediate genesis of the myth —and it may well be sought in the heartless
                    forest laws—its vitality was assured by the English love of archery and
                    historical repetition. In the rolls of parliament of 1437 mention is made of
                    Piers Venables, a robber who took to the woods “ like as it had been Robin Hood
                    and his meyné.” There are indications that Robin was identified or confused with
                    Robert Locksley, a manslayer of BradfieId in Hallamshire. The former is said to
                    have been born in “ Merry sweet <hi rend="italic">Locksley</hi> town.”</p>
               <p>But whether he lived or not, and whenever he lived, it is certain that many
                    mythical elements are contained in his story. Both his name and his exploits
                    remind us of the woodland spirit Robin Goodfellow and his merry pranks. He is
                    fond of disguising himself, and devoted to fun and practical jokes. These
                    frolics suggest the wind. “ The whole story,” says Mr H. Bradley, “ is
                    ultimately derived from the great Aryan sun-myth. Robin Hood is Hod, the god of
                    the wind, a form of Woden; Maid Marian is Morgen, the dawn-maiden; Friar Tuck is
                    Toki, the spirit of frost and snow.”</p>
               <p>The name Robin (a French form from Rob, which is of course a short form for
                    Robert) WOuld serve both for “ the shrewd and knavish sprite ”—the German Knecht
                    Ruprecht (see Grimm’s <hi rend="italic">Teut. Myth.</hi> p. 504, trans.
                    Stallybrass)—and for the bandit (see “ Roberdes Knaues ” in the Prologue of <hi
                        rend="italic">Piers the Plowman,</hi> 1.44, and the note in Warton’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Hist, of Eng. Poet.</hi> ii. 95, ed. 1840). <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hood</hi> is a very usual dialectal form of <hi rend="italic">wood,</hi>
                    and in his play <hi rend="italic">Edward the First,</hi> George Peele actually
                    alludes to the bandit as “ Robin of the Wood.” Mr Gutch thus explains the origin
                    of the name. It is still a common enough surname, of which the earlier shape is
                    Odo (see “ Houdart, ” &amp;c., in Larchey’s <hi rend="italic">Diet, des
                        Noms);</hi> notice, too, the name Hudson. But it also reminds one of the
                    German familiar spirit Hudekin, or possibly of the German Witikind (see Wright’s
                    Ewayi <hi rend="italic">on the Middle</hi> Agei, ii. 207). Mr Sidney Lee
                    suggests that Robin was a forest elf so called because elves wore hoods (see <hi
                        rend="italic">Diet, of National Biography,</hi> sub; “ Robin Hood ”). How
                    certain it is that the Robin Hood story attracted to it and appropriated other
                    elements is illustrated by its subsequent history—its history after the 14th
                    century. Thus later on we find it connected with the Morris dance; but the
                    Morris dance was not known in England before the 16th century or late in the
                    15th. The Friar Tuck and Maid Marian elements have been thought to have been
                    introduced for the purpose of these performances, which were held on May-day and
                    were immensely popular (see Latimer’s <hi rend="italic">Frutefull Sermons</hi>
                    (London, 1571), p. 75; also <hi rend="italic">Paston Letters,</hi> ed. J.
                    Gaird-ner, iii. 89). After 1615, the date of the pageant prepared for the
                    mayoralty of Sir John Jolles, draper, by Anthony Munday and entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Metropolis Coronata,</hi> a peer was imported into it, and the
                    yeoman of the older version was metamorphosed into the earl of Huntingdon, for
                    whom in the following century William Stukeley discovered a satisfactory
                    pedigree! The earl of Huntingdon was probably a nickname for a hunter. At last,
                    with the change of times, the myth ceased growing. Its rise and development and
                    decay deserve a more thorough study than they have yet received.</p>
               <p>What perhaps is its greatest interest as we first see it is its expression of
                    the popular mind about the close of the middle ages. Robin Hood is at that time
                    the people’s ideal as Arthur is that of the upper classes. He is the ideal
                    yeoman as Arthur is the ideal knight. He readjusts the distribution of property:
                    he robs the rich and endows the poor. He is an earnest worshipper of the Virgin,
                    but a bold and vigorous hater of monks and abbots. He is the great sportsman,
                    the incomparable archer, the lover of the greenwood and of a free life, brave,
                    adventurous, jocular, open-handed, a protector of women. Observe his
                    instructions to Little John—</p>
               <p>” Loke ye do no housbonde harme That tylleth with his plough ;</p>
               <p>No more ye shall no good yeman That walketh by grene wode shawe;</p>
               <p>Nc no knyght ne no squycr That woldc be a good felawc :</p>
               <p>These bysshoppes and thysc archebysshoppes Yc shall them bete and byndc;</p>
               <p>The hye sheryfc of Notynghame Hym holde in your mynde.”</p>
               <p>And we are told—</p>
               <p>“ Robin loved our dcre lady;</p>
               <p>For doute of dcdcly synne Woldc he never do company harme.</p>
               <p>That ony woman was ynne.”</p>
               <p>See also Drayton’s <hi rend="italic">Polyolbion,</hi> Song xxvi. The story is
                    localized in Barnsdale and Sherwood, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> between
                    Doncaster and Nottingham. In Yorkshire, Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire a host
                    of place-names testify to the popularity of the Robin Hood legend—Robin Hood’s
                    Bay, Robin Hood’s Cave, Robin Hood’s Chase, Robin Hood’s Cup (a well), Robin
                    Hood’s Chair, Robin Hood’s Pricks, and many more.</p>
               <p>The best collections of Robin Hood poems are those of Ritson (8vo, 1795) and
                    Gutch (2nd cd., 18^7), and of Professor Child in the 5th volume of his
                    invaluable <hi rend="italic">English and Scotch Popular Ballads</hi> (Boston,
                    1888). See also Professor F. B. Gummere’s <hi rend="italic">Old English
                        Ballads</hi> (Boston, 1894). The versions in the Percy Folio (edited by
                    Hales and Furnivall, 1867, vol. i.) are unhappily mutilated; but they should be
                    consulted, for they arc all more or less unique, and that on “ Robin Hoode his
                    death ” is of singular interest. The literary and artistic value of many of the
                    Robin Hood ballads cannot be pronounced considerable, but eight of them attain
                    the high-water mark of their class. <hi rend="italic">Robin Hood and the
                        Monk</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Guy of Gisborne</hi> are perhaps the best.
                    There is, howover, real vigour and force in this fragment on the hero’s death.
                    The earliest “ Garland ” was printed in 1670, and in 1678 appeared a prose
                    version which was reprinted by W. J. Thoms in his <hi rend="italic">Early
                        English Prose Romances</hi> (vol. ii., 1858). Mr Lee's memoir in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi> is extremely erudite,
                    and two valuable articles, contributed by Sir Edward Brabrook to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Antiquary</hi> for June and July 1906, might be consulted. See
