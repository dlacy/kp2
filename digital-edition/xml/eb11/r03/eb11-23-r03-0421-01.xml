<p><label>ROBIN HOODâ€™S BAY</label>
a seaside resort in the Whitby parliamentary division of the North Riding of Yorkshire, England, 6| m. S.E. of Whitby by a branch of the North-Eastern railway. The bay itself is a shallow indentation of the coast, and is fringed with high picturesque cliffs, breached in places by steep-sided narrow gullies. The old fishing village overhangs the cliffs, while the more modem watering-place is mostly built a little inland. A fine stretch of sandy shore is exposed at low tide.</p>
