<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">years ago existed steelbow leases, by which the landlord stocked the farm with corn, cattle, implements, &amp;c., the tenant returning&nbsp;similar articles at the expiration of his tenancy and paying in&nbsp;addition to the ordinary rent a steelbow rent of 5 per cent, on the&nbsp;value of the stock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">United States.—Agricultural rents are, from the different position of the cultivators of the land, of less importance than in England.&nbsp;The law is in general accordance with that of England. The&nbsp;tendency of modern State legislation is unfavourable to the&nbsp;continuance of distress as a remedy. In some States, such as Ohio&nbsp;and Tennessee, it never existed. Fee farm rents exist in some&nbsp;States, like Pennsylvania, which have not adopted the Statute of&nbsp;Quia Emptores as a part of their common law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. Wf.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REPLEVIN. Since the article </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Distress </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.) Avas written the Agricultural Holdings Act, 1883, has made&nbsp;some changes in the law of replevin in England. The&nbsp;period of five days during which the tenant or owner of&nbsp;goods may replevy by 2 Will, &amp; Mary c. 5, § 1, is extended&nbsp;in the case of holdings within the Act to fifteen days, on the&nbsp;tenant or owner making a request in writing to that effect&nbsp;and giving security for additional costs. A summary&nbsp;remedy in the nature of replevin is given, a court of&nbsp;summary jurisdiction having a jurisdiction concurrent&nbsp;with that of the county court conferred upon it in the&nbsp;case of distress on a holding \\<sup>r</sup>ithin the Act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">REPORTING. The curious among those A\<sup>r</sup>ho seek to trace political developments may, Avithout any great strain&nbsp;on the imagination, find an intimate relation betA\<sup>r</sup>een the&nbsp;groAvth of newspaper reporting and the groAvth of democratic institutions; at any rate the tAvo have always been&nbsp;found together. The history of reporting in Great Britain&nbsp;brings out the relationship Avith much clearness. There&nbsp;A\<sup>r</sup>as no truly systematic reporting until the beginning of&nbsp;this century, and not until many years aftenvards did it&nbsp;groAv to be a most important, if not the most important,&nbsp;feature in newspapers. There Avas parliamentary reporting&nbsp;of a kind almost from the time when parliaments began.&nbsp;Single speeches, and even some consecutive account of&nbsp;particular proceedings in parliament, Avere prepared. But&nbsp;long after newspapers Avere commonly published no effort&nbsp;had been made to give reports either of the proceedings&nbsp;of parliament or of those of any other assembly dealing&nbsp;with the public interests. The first attempts at parliamentary reporting, in the sense of seeking to make knoAvn to&nbsp;the public Avhat was done and said in parliament, began&nbsp;in a pamphlet published monthly in Queen Anne’s time&nbsp;called The Political State. Its reports were mere indications of speeches. Later, the Gentleman’s Magazine began&nbsp;to publish reports of parliamentary debates. Access to&nbsp;the Houses of Parliament was obtained by Cave, the&nbsp;publisher of the magazine, and some of his friends, and&nbsp;they took surreptitiously Avhat notes they could. These&nbsp;were subsequently transcribed and brought into shape for&nbsp;publication by another hand. There Avas a strict prohibition of all public reporting; but the Gentleman’s Magazine&nbsp;appears to have continued its reports for some time&nbsp;Avithout attracting the attention or rousing the jealousy of&nbsp;the House of Commons. The publisher, encouraged by&nbsp;immunity from prosecution by parliament, grew bolder, and&nbsp;began in his reports to give the names of the speakers.&nbsp;Then he Avas called to account. The latest standing order&nbsp;on the subject at that time Avas one passed in 1728, which&nbsp;declared “ that it is an indignity to, and a breach of, the&nbsp;privilege of this House for any person to presume to give, in&nbsp;written or printed newspapers, any account or minute of the&nbsp;debates or other proceedings; that upon discovery of the&nbsp;authors, printers, or publishers of any such newspaper this&nbsp;House will proceed against the offenders Avith the utmost&nbsp;severity.” Under this and other standing orders, Cave’s&nbsp;reports Avere challenged, as were those of other publishers&nbsp;in other magazines. They were denounced by resolution ;&nbsp;and threats of prosecution Avere made, Avith the result that</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the reports appeared still, but Avithout the proper names of the speakers, and under the guise of “Debates in the Senate&nbsp;of Lilliput ” or some other like title. Long afterwards, in&nbsp;the latter half of the century, the neAvspapers began to report&nbsp;parliamentary debates more fully, Avith the result that, in&nbsp;1771, several printers, including those of the Morning&nbsp;Chronicle and the London Evening Post, Avere ordered into&nbsp;custody for publishing debates of the House of Commons.&nbsp;A long and bitter struggle between the House and the&nbsp;public ensued. John Wilkes took part in it. The lord&nbsp;mayor of London and an alderman Avere sent to the ToAver&nbsp;for refusing to recognize the Speaker’s A\־arrant for the arrest&nbsp;of certain printers of parliamentary reports. But the House&nbsp;of Commons Avas beaten. In 1772 the newspapers published&nbsp;the reports as usual; and their right to do so has never since&nbsp;been really questioned. Both Houses of Parliament, indeed,&nbsp;noAv shoAv as much anxiety to have their debates fully reported as aforetime they showed resentment at the intrusion&nbsp;of the reporter. Provision has been made in the House of&nbsp;Lords and in the House of Commons for reporters. There&nbsp;are galleries in Avhicli they may take notes, and writing rooms&nbsp;in Avhich those notes may be extended. In short, reporting&nbsp;׳ is now one of the best marked of parliamentary institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">But parliamentary reporting is only a small part of such work in newspapers. The newspapers in the beginning of this century rarely contained more than the&nbsp;barest outline of any speech or public address delivered&nbsp;in or in the neighbourhood of the toAvns Avhere they were&nbsp;published. As parliamentary reporting began to groAv, so&nbsp;did local reporting. After the peace of 1815 a period&nbsp;of much political fermentation set in, and the neAvspapers&nbsp;began to report the speeches of public men at greater&nbsp;length. All the attempts that Avere made from time to&nbsp;time to repress public meetings and demonstrations of&nbsp;dissatisfaction Avith the existing order of things did but&nbsp;increase the demand for reporting. It grew as the fetters&nbsp;were struck off public institutions. With the Reform Act&nbsp;of 1832 it got a great start forward; and the Municipal&nbsp;Reform Acts gave it a still stronger impulse. Then&nbsp;the proceedings of town councils could be reported, and&nbsp;every local newspaper took care that this Avas done. It&nbsp;Avas not, however, until well into what may be called&nbsp;the railway era that any frequent effort was made by&nbsp;neAvspapers to go out of their own district for the&nbsp;work of reporting. The London newspapers had before&nbsp;this led the way. In London alone were there daily&nbsp;newspapers. The proprietors of these papers had been&nbsp;compelled by the requirements of the public to make&nbsp;provision for the systematic reporting of the proceedings&nbsp;of parliament. For many years after the right to report&nbsp;those proceedings had been practically established, the&nbsp;Avork was done in a dilatory and clumsy fashion. Early&nbsp;in the present century, hoAvever, greater freedom of&nbsp;access to both Houses was given, and the manager of&nbsp;the Morning Chronicle established a staff of reporters.&nbsp;They began the system Avhich with improvements has&nbsp;continued to this time. Each reporter took his “ turn ”&nbsp;—that is, he took notes of the proceedings for a certain&nbsp;time, and then gave place to a colleague. The reporter&nbsp;avIio Avas relieved at once extended his notes, and thus&nbsp;prompt publication of the debates was made possible.&nbsp;Reporters had been found to supply the demand, and&nbsp;it had become the habit of the proprietors of the London&nbsp;newspapers to employ these men, out of the session of&nbsp;parliament, in reporting the speeches of public men in&nbsp;the country. The practice greAv until there was a good&nbsp;deal of competition among the papers as to which should&nbsp;first issue a report of any speech of note. Railways were&nbsp;not; and reporters had frequently to ride long distances&nbsp;in post chaises, doing their best as they jolted along the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
