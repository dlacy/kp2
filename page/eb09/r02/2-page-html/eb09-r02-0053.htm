<p><span class="font1">crops, and houses practically intact, along with the proprietor, who was seated at his own door, was carried a distance of nearly 1 1/2 miles. Along the whole eastern&nbsp;side of the cirque between the village of Salazie and&nbsp;Hellbourg is a series of waterfalls issuing at a great&nbsp;height from above a vast bank of lava. They are probably&nbsp;the overflow of a subterranean basin connected, it may be,&nbsp;with the sources, on the other side of the wall, of the Rivière&nbsp;du Bras de Caverne. At the source of the Rivière du&nbsp;Mât, which escapes from the cirque by a narrow and&nbsp;precipitous gorge, is a magnificent sheaf of basaltic&nbsp;columns boldly curving out over the bed of the torrent.&nbsp;Having climbed up the eastern side of the cirque, the&nbsp;traveller reaches the well-wooded plain of the Salazes ;&nbsp;farther east, and separated from it by ridges of rock is the&nbsp;Plaine des Caffres at a height of 5250 feet above the sea,&nbsp;and by a descent of 1500 feet this dips north-eastward&nbsp;into the Plaine des Palmistes. The eastern summit or&nbsp;Piton de Fournaise is cut off from the rest of the island by&nbsp;two curious enclosures, each about 500 or 600 feet deep.&nbsp;The traveller approaching the present craters from the&nbsp;west has consequently to descend upwards of 1000 feet&nbsp;by two abrupt stages before he begins the ascent of the&nbsp;cones. · The outer “ enclosure ” runs across the island in&nbsp;a north and south direction; but the inner forms a rude&nbsp;kind of parabola with its arms (Rempart du Tremblet on&nbsp;the south and Rempart du Bois Blanc on the north)&nbsp;stretching eastwards to the sea and embracing not only&nbsp;the volcano proper but also the great eastward slope known&nbsp;as the Grand Brûlé. There are two principal craters,&nbsp;each on an elevated cone,—the more westerly, now extinct,&nbsp;known as the Bory Crater after Bory de St Vincent, the&nbsp;eminent geologist, and the more easterly, simply called the&nbsp;Burning Crater or Fournaise. The latter is partially&nbsp;surrounded by an “ enclosure ” on a small scale with&nbsp;precipices 200 feet high. Eruptions, though not infrequent (thirty were registered between 1735 and 1860)&nbsp;are seldom serious ; the more noteworthy are those of&nbsp;1745, 1778, 1791, 1812, 1860, 1870, 1881. Basaltic or&nbsp;vitreous lavas rich in chrysolite are the usual products, and&nbsp;it is hardly possible to conceive of a discharge sufficient in&nbsp;volume to overflow the “ ramparts ” and carry destruction&nbsp;to the rest of the island. @@<sup>1</sup> Besides the Piton des Neiges&nbsp;(10,069 feet high), the Bory Peak (8612 feet), and the Burning Peak (8294), the principal summits in Réunion are the&nbsp;Grand Bénard (9490), Morne L’Angevin (7845), and Cim-andef (7300). The streams which radiate out in all directions from the central highlands are for the most part comparatively small except during the rainy season, when they&nbsp;become impetuous and destructive torrents. Hot mineral&nbsp;springs are found in various parts of the island : the Source&nbsp;de Salazie (discovered in 1831) lies 2860 feet above sea-level, has a temperature of 90°, and discharges 200 to 220&nbsp;gallons per hour of water impregnated with bicarbonate&nbsp;of soda, and carbonates of magnesium and lime, iron, &amp;c. ;&nbsp;that of Cilaos (discovered in 1826) is 3650 feet above the&nbsp;sea with a temperature of 100° ; and that of Mafate 2238&nbsp;feet and 87°. At the first there are a military hospital&nbsp;and a group of dwelling houses and villas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vertically Réunion may be divided into five zones. The first or maritime zone contains all the towns and most of the&nbsp;villages, built on the limited areas of level alluvium occurring&nbsp;at intervals round the coast (128 miles). In the second,&nbsp;which lies between 2600 and 4000 feet, the sugar plantations make a green belt round the island and country houses&nbsp;abound. The third zone is that of the forests ; the fourth&nbsp;that of the plateaus, where European vegetables can be&nbsp;cultivated ; and above this extends the region of the&nbsp;mountains, which occupies more space than any of the others.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> The geology and volcanoes of Réunion were the object of elaborate study by Bory de St Vincent in 1801 and 1802 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Voyages dans les&nbsp;quatre principales îles des Mers d’Afrique,</span><span class="font0"> Paris, 1804), and have&nbsp;recently been examined by Drasche (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Berieht K.-K. Geol. Beich-sanstalt,</span><span class="font0"> Vienna, 1875-76) and Velain (thesis presented to the Faculté&nbsp;des Sciences, Paris, 1878).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">The following statements in regard to climate refer more particularly to the lower zones. The year divides into two seasons—that of heat and rain from November to April, that of dry and more&nbsp;bracing weather from May to October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to observations taken at St Denis between 1863 and 1870, and reduced to sea-level, the mean monthly temperature&nbsp;varies as follows:—January, 80°'36 ; February, 80°'36 ; March,&nbsp;80°42 ; April, 78<sup>o-</sup>62 ; May, 75<sup>o,</sup>30 ; June, 72° 53; July, 7l<sup>o-</sup>22 ;&nbsp;August, 70°‘59 ; September, 7l°'6 ; October, 73°‘43 ; November,&nbsp;76<sup>O,</sup>62 ; December, 78°‘92 ; and the rainfall was distributed thus :—&nbsp;January, 8<sup>-</sup>2 inches; February, 10‘9 ; March, 547 ; April, 478 ;&nbsp;May 2 '9 ; June, 6 4 ; July, 0 27 ; August, 17 ; September, 0’80 ;&nbsp;October, 1'67 ; November, 3‘09 ; December, 5*25; making an&nbsp;annual average of 45 ‘57 inches, falling in 79 7 days. The prevailing&nbsp;winds are from the south-east, sometimes veering round to the&nbsp;south, and more frequently to the north-east ; the west winds are&nbsp;not so steady (three hundred and seven days of east to fifty-eight of&nbsp;west in the course of the year). It is seldom calm'during the day,&nbsp;but there is usually a period of complete repose before the land wind&nbsp;begins in the evening. Several years sometimes pass without a&nbsp;cyclone visiting the island ; at other times they occur more than&nbsp;once in a single “winter.” From April till October there is little&nbsp;fear of them. That of March 1879 was particularly destructive.&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raz de marée</span><span class="font0"> occasionally does great damage. On the leeward&nbsp;side of the island the temperature is higher than at St Denis. The&nbsp;winds are generally from the west and south-west, and bring little&nbsp;rain. Mist hangs almost all day on the tops of the mountains,&nbsp;but usually clears off at night. The mean annual temperature at&nbsp;Salazie is 66° and at the Plaine des Palmistes 61°7.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fauna of Réunion is not very rich in variety of species ; it lies midway between the Indian and the African type. The mammals are a brown maki </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Lemur rnongoz,</span><span class="font0"> Linn.) from Madagascar,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ptcropus edwardsii</span><span class="font0"> now nearly extinct, several bats, a wild cat, the&nbsp;tang or tamec </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Centetes setosus,</span><span class="font0"> Denn. ), several rats, the hare, and&nbsp;the goat. Among the more familiar birds are the “ oiseau de la&nbsp;vierge ” (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Muscipeta borbonixai),</span><span class="font0"> the tec-tec </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pratineola sybilla),&nbsp;Certhia borboniea,</span><span class="font0"> the cardinal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Foudia madagaseariensis'),</span><span class="font0"> various&nbsp;swallows, ducks, &amp;c. The visitants from Madagascar, Mauritius,&nbsp;and even India, are very numerous. Lizards and frogs of more than&nbsp;one species are common, but there is only one snake known in the&nbsp;island. Various species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gohius,</span><span class="font0"> a native species of mullet, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nestis&nbsp;cypnnoides, Osphronamus olfax,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Doules rupcstris</span><span class="font0"> are among&nbsp;the freshwater fishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the forest region of the island there is a belt, 4500-5000 feet above the sea, characterized by the prevalence of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bambusa alqrina ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and above that is a similar belt of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acacia heterophylla.</span><span class="font0"> Besides&nbsp;this last the best timber-trees are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Casuarina latenfolia, Fœtida&nbsp;mauritiana, Imbrieama petiolaris, Elæodendron orientale, Calo-phyllurn spurium</span><span class="font0"> (red tacamahac), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Terminalia borboniea, Parkia&nbsp;speeiosa.</span><span class="font0"> The gardens of the coast districts display a marvellous&nbsp;wealth of flowers and shrubs, partly indigenous and largely gathered&nbsp;from all parts of the world. Fruits grown in the island are—the&nbsp;banana, the cocoa-nut, bread-fruit, and jack-fruit, the bilimbi, the&nbsp;carambola, the guava, the litchi, the Japanese medlar, the mango-steen, the tamarind, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Abclmoseh’us eseulentus,</span><span class="font0"> the cliirimoya,&nbsp;the papaya, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sugar, introduced in 1711 by Pierre Parat, is now the staple crop in Reunion, a greater proportion of the soil being devoted to it&nbsp;than to all other objects of cultivation. The methods employed&nbsp;in growing and manufacturing are not up to the Mauritius standard,&nbsp;and since 1878 the ravages of the phylloxera have ruined many&nbsp;of the plantations. In the 18th century the first place belonged&nbsp;to coffee (introduced from Arabia in 1715) and to the clove tree,&nbsp;brought from the Dutch Indies by Poivre at the risk of his life.&nbsp;Both are now cultivated on a very limited scale. Vanilla, introduced in 1818, though it occupies only about 1500 acres, sometimes produces a crop worth from £40,000 to £65,000. The&nbsp;average produce of the sugar crop in the five years 1873—77 was&nbsp;35,493 tons of sugar with 777,710 gallons of syrup and treacle;&nbsp;from 1S78 to 1883 the averages were 35,580 tons (40,176 in 1883)&nbsp;and 816,455 gallons. Rum is largely distilled, and is the favourite&nbsp;drink of all classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While potatoes, beans, manioc, sweet potatoes, and yams of local growth furnish a considerable amount of food, the far more&nbsp;important article rice has to be imported from India and Madagascar.&nbsp;India also sends castor-oil, wheat, and lard ; Australia, flour and&nbsp;wheat ; England, coals ; the Cape and Muscat, salt fish ; Buenos&nbsp;Ayres and Montevideo, mules and horses ; the United States&nbsp;petroleum (largely used throughout the island), lard, pork, and&nbsp;pitch-pine.</span></p>
