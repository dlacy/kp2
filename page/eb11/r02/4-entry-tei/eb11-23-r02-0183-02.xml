<p><label>RESIDENT</label>
a political agent or officer representing the Indian government in certain native states in India. He resides in the state and advises on all matters of government, legislative or executive. Residents are divided into three classes or ranks. In certain other dependencies or protectorates of the British Empire the representative of the government is termed a resident or political agent, notably in Nepaul, Aden, Sarawak, British North Borneo, &amp;c. In general, where the state to which a resident is attached is not an independent one, he exercises consular and magisterial functions.</p><p>For “ Resident ” as the title of a diplomatic agent see <hi rend="smallcaps">Diplomacy.</hi></p>
