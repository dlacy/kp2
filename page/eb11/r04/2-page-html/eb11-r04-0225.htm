<p><span class="font1">Lambton, an unsuccessful Liberal candidate for Newcastle, in September 1900, he condemned the general conduct of affairs&nbsp;by Lord Salisbury’s government, while in several speeches in&nbsp;the House of Lords he strongly urged the necessity of army&nbsp;reform. Since his abandonment of the leadership in 1896, the&nbsp;lack of coherence in the Liberal party had become more and&nbsp;more manifest. The war had brought to the front a pro-Boer&nbsp;section, who seemed gradually to be compromising the whole&nbsp;party, and had apparently succeeded in winning the support&nbsp;of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the leader in the House of&nbsp;Commons. Lord Rosebery maintained for the most part a&nbsp;sphinx-like seclusion, but in July 1901 he at last came forward&nbsp;strongly as the champion of the Liberal Imperialist section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In deference to the wishes of supporters such as Mr Asquith, Sir Henry Fowler and Sir Edward Grey he determined to&nbsp;<sup>(i</sup> put his views into the common stock ” at a representative&nbsp;meeting of Liberals held at Chesterfield in December 1901.&nbsp;There he advised the Liberal party that “ its slate must be&nbsp;cleaned.” and, as he subsequently explained, this cleansing&nbsp;must involve the elimination of Home Rule for Ireland. His&nbsp;appeal for “ spade work ” resulted in the formation of the&nbsp;Liberal League, inside the Liberal Opposition; and what&nbsp;Lord Rosebery himself described as his “ definite separation ”&nbsp;from Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman’s “ tabernacle ” took&nbsp;place. This announcement, however, was no sooner made&nbsp;than it was explained away by the supporters of both, and&nbsp;early in 1902 Lord Rosebery spoke at the National Liberal&nbsp;Club in a way which indicated that an understanding might&nbsp;still be arrived at. But though Mr Asquith and Sir Edward&nbsp;Grey adhered to the Liberal League, Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman retained the loyalty of the majority of the Liberal&nbsp;party, and Lord Spencer threw his weight on the same side;&nbsp;and in a speech at the Liberal League dinner on the 31st of&nbsp;July Lord Rosebery had to admit that their principles had&nbsp;not yet prevailed, and that, until they did, a reconciliation&nbsp;between the two wings of the party would be impossible. In&nbsp;January 1903 he addressed a Liberal meeting at Plymouth,&nbsp;and appeared to be attempting to concentrate Opposition&nbsp;criticism upon the points in the government policy which&nbsp;did not involve the Imperialist difference; and in discussing&nbsp;War Office reform he advocated the appointment of Lord&nbsp;Kitchener as secretary of state for war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Mr Chamberlain started his new fiscal programme, combining Tariff Reform with Colonial Preference, Lord&nbsp;Rosebery at first seemed' inclined to treat it as non-political,&nbsp;and on the 19th of May 1903 he declared in an address to the&nbsp;Burnley Chamber of Commerce that he was not one of those&nbsp;who regarded Free Trade as part of the Sermon on the Mount.&nbsp;This utterance led to an idea that he was inclined to consider&nbsp;favourably the proposal for a preferential tariff, his earlier&nbsp;enthusiasm for Imperial Federation making his support an&nbsp;interesting political possibility. But this idea was quickly&nbsp;dispelled; on the 22nd he expressed his surprise that anybody&nbsp;should have thought he intended to approve of Mr Chamberlain’s&nbsp;plan; he was not prepared to dismiss in advance a proposal&nbsp;for the consolidation of the empire made by the responsible&nbsp;government, but he believed that the objections to a policy&nbsp;of preference were insurmountable. The fact, no doubt, was&nbsp;that Mr Asquith, Lord Rosebery’s chief lieutenant in the&nbsp;Liberal League, made himself from the outset a determined&nbsp;champion of free trade in opposition to Mr Chamberlain; and&nbsp;Lord Rosebery quickly came into line with the rest of the&nbsp;Liberal party on this question. On the 12th of June, addressing&nbsp;the Liberal League, he admitted that as a lifelong Imperialist&nbsp;it was with pain and grief that he could not support Mr Chamberlain’s scheme, but the empire had been built upon free trade,&nbsp;and he only saw danger to the empire in these new proposals.&nbsp;Speaking at Sheffield on the 13 th of October he criticized the&nbsp;scheme in more detail, and, as an Imperialist, warned the&nbsp;country against it, emphasizing his own ideal of the future&nbsp;of the empire—“ a strong mother with strong children, each&nbsp;working out his own political and fiscal salvation.” His&nbsp;attitude on the new issue undoubtedly affected public opinion,&nbsp;and helped to draw him closer to the great body of the Liberal&nbsp;party, who saw that their identification with the cause of free&nbsp;trade was doing much to remove the public distrust associated&nbsp;with their support of Home Rule. On the 7th of November&nbsp;at Leicester Lord Rosebery insisted that what the country&nbsp;wanted was not fiscal reform but commercial reform, and he&nbsp;appealed to the free-trade section of the Unionist party to&nbsp;join the Liberals in a united defence,—an appeal incidentally&nbsp;for Liberal unity which was warmly seconded ten days later&nbsp;by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. On the 26th of November&nbsp;Lord Rosebery’s speech on the same lines at a meeting in South&nbsp;London resulted in a powerful demonstration in favour of his&nbsp;resuming the Liberal leadership, but he made no public response.&nbsp;On the 10th of June 1904 he addressed a meeting of the&nbsp;Liberal League at the Queen’s Hall, London, and sketched&nbsp;a programme of “sane and practical Imperialism”; but he&nbsp;irritated the Home Rulers by again repudiating a parliament&nbsp;in Dublin, and he perplexed the public generally by his adverse&nbsp;criticism on the popular Anglo-French Agreement, which he&nbsp;was the only English statesman to oppose, on the ground of&nbsp;its handing over Morocco to France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At Glasgow on the 5th of December he again outlined a Liberal programme, this and other speeches all leading to tbe&nbsp;assumption that his return to active co-operation with the&nbsp;Liberal party in the general election—which could not be long&nbsp;delayed—was fairly certain. Early in 1905 this impression&nbsp;gained such strength and such polite references were made&nbsp;to one another in public by Lord Rosebery and Sir Henry&nbsp;Campbell-Bannerman, that his assumption of office in a Liberal&nbsp;ministry, possibly presided over by Earl Spencer, was confidently anticipated. But these forecasts were ultimately&nbsp;upset, not only by Lord Spencer’s illness and his removal&nbsp;from the list of possible Liberal prime ministers, but by Sir&nbsp;Henry Campbell-Bannerman’s pronouncement at Stirling in&nbsp;November on the subject of Irish Home Rule. Lord Rosebery&nbsp;had just gone down to Cornwall to make a series of speeches&nbsp;in support of the Liberal programme, now fairly well mapped&nbsp;out as regards those items which represented the strong public&nbsp;opposition to what had been done by the Unionist government.&nbsp;It was believed that an understanding had been come to between his Liberal League henchmen (Mr Asquith, Sir E. Grey&nbsp;and Mr Haldane) and Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and&nbsp;that Lord Rosebery’s co-operation was to be secured by the&nbsp;adoption of some formula which would temporarily take Home&nbsp;Rule out of the official programme as a question of practical&nbsp;politics. But to the general surprise and Lord Rosebery’s&nbsp;own very evident mortification Sir Henry went a long way in&nbsp;his Stirling speech to nail the Home Rule colour to the mast;&nbsp;he did not indeed propose to introduce a Home Rule Bill, but&nbsp;he declared his determination to proceed in Irish legislation&nbsp;on lines which would lead up to the same result. Lord Rosebery abruptly broke off his campaign, declaring at Bodmin&nbsp;(26th of November) that he would never “ fight under that&nbsp;banner. ” From the moment the apparent recrudescence of the&nbsp;Liberal split over this question seemed to have misled Air&nbsp;Balfour, who resigned office on the 4th of December, into thinking that difficulties would arise over the formation of a Liberal&nbsp;cabinet; but, whether or not the rumour was correct that </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">blunder had been made at Stirling and that explanations had&nbsp;ensued which satisfied Mr Asquith and Sir Edward Grey, this&nbsp;anticipation proved unjustified. Lord Rosebery himself, it is&nbsp;true, held aloof; his protest had been publicly made and he&nbsp;adhered to it in the absence of any public withdrawal by Sir&nbsp;Henry Campbell-Bannerman; but he encouraged his Liberal&nbsp;League supporters to be loyal to the new prime minister, and&nbsp;Mr Asquith, Sir E. Grey and Air Haldane were included in&nbsp;the Liberal cabinet. The overwhelming Liberal and Labour&nbsp;victory at the general election of 1906 began a new era in the&nbsp;fortunes of the party, and Lord Rosebery’s individuality once&nbsp;more sank back from any position of prominence in regard to&nbsp;its new programme. He remained outside party politics,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
