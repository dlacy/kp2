<p><span class="font1">with ſhouts from the immenſe concourſe of ſpectators of &quot; Vive le Roi et vive l’affemble nationale,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Long live&nbsp;the king and the national aſſembly.</span><span class="font1"> M. Bailly was choſen&nbsp;preſident for four days only, Meſſrs Camus and Piſon&nbsp;de Galand fεcrctaries, and the aſſembly proceeded to bu∙&nbsp;fineſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Its firſt acts were deciſively expreſſive of its own ſo-vereignty. All taxes impoſed without the conſent of the reprefentatives of the people were declared to be&nbsp;null and void ; but a temporary fonction was given to&nbsp;the preſent taxes, although illegal, till the diſſolution&nbsp;of the aſſembly and no longer. It was added, that &quot; as&nbsp;ſoon as, in concert with his majeſty, the aſſembly ſhould&nbsp;be able to fix the principles of national regeneration, it&nbsp;would take into conſiderat ion the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">national debt,</span><span class="font1"> placing&nbsp;from the prefent moment the creditors of the ſtate un-der the fofeguard and honour of the French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nation.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The popular caufe now gained ground fo faſt, that on the 19th of June a majority of the clergy voted for&nbsp;the verification of their powers in common with the&nbsp;national aſſembly, and they reſolved to unite with them&nbsp;on the following day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Affairs were now come to a crifis, and the nobleβ perceived that they muſt inſtantly make a decifive&nbsp;ſtand, or yield up their cauſe as finally loft. Such&nbsp;was their alarm, that M. d’Eſpremenil propoſed, at one&nbsp;of the fittings of their order, to addreſs the king,&nbsp;intreating him to diſſolve the ſtates-generah Hi-therto that prince had gone along with M. Neckar in&nbsp;favouring the popular cauſe in oppoſition to the ariſto'&nbsp;cracy. But every art was now uſed to alarm his mind&nbsp;upon the ſubject of the late aſſumptions of power on&nbsp;the part of the commons, and theſe arts were at length&nbsp;ſucceſsful. Repeated counſels were held ; M. Neckar&nbsp;was abſent attending a dying fiſter, and the king was&nbsp;prevailed upon to act agreeably to the advice of the&nbsp;leaders of the nobles. But the firſt meafure which they&nbsp;adopted was fo ill conducted as to afford little proſpect&nbsp;of final ſucceſs to their cauſe. Οη the 20th of June,,&nbsp;when the preſident and members were about to enter as&nbsp;uſual into their own hall, they found it unexpectedly&nbsp;ſurrounded by a detachment of the guards, who refuſed&nbsp;them admiffion, while the heralds at the ſame time pro-claimed a royal ſeſſion. Alarmed by this unforeſeen&nbsp;event, the meaning of which they knew not, but ap-prehending that an immediate diſſolution of the aſſembly&nbsp;was deſigned, they inſtantly retired to a neighbouring&nbsp;tennis-court, where, in the vehemence of their enthu-iiaſm, they took a folemn oath &quot; never to feparate till&nbsp;the conſtitution of their country ſhould be completed.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Οη the 22d a new proclamation intimated that the royal ſeſſion, was deferred till the following day. It&nbsp;was now found that the aſſembly had been excluded&nbsp;from their hall merely becaufe the workmen were oc-cupied in preparing it for the intended ſolemnity. This&nbsp;information was ill calculated to excite favourable expectations of the meaſures about to be adopted at a&nbsp;royal ſeffion, uſhered in by ſuch circumſtances of mark-ed diſreſpect for the reprefentatives of the people. The&nbsp;aſſembly, after wandering about in ſearch of a place&nbsp;of meeting, at length entered the church of St Louis,&nbsp;and were immediately joined by the majority of the&nbsp;clergy, with their preſident, the archbiſhop of vienne,&nbsp;at their head. </span><span class="font0">Two </span><span class="font1">nobles of Dauphiné, the marquis&nbsp;de Blacon and. </span><span class="font0">the count </span><span class="font1">d’Agoult, </span><span class="font0">preſcnted. their cou∖-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">miſſions at the ſame time. Encouraged by theſe events, and by the applauſes of fiμroundiιιg multitudes, the&nbsp;aſſembly now expected with firmneſs the meaſures about&nbsp;to be adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The royal'ſeffion was held in the moſt fplendid form,D but altogether in the ſtyle of the ancient deſpotiſm.&nbsp;Soldiers ſurrounded the hall. The two ſuperior orders&nbsp;were ſeated, while the reprefentatives of the people,&nbsp;left ſtanding a full hour in the rain, were in no humour,&nbsp;when at laſt admitted, to receive with much compla-cency the commands of their fovereign. The king&nbsp;read a diſcourſe, in which he declared null and void the&nbsp;reſolutions of the r7tl1, but at the ſame time preſented&nbsp;the plan of a conſtitution for France. It contained&nbsp;many good and patriotic principles, but preſerved the&nbsp;diſtinction of orders, and the exerciſe of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lettres de cachet ;</span><span class="font1"> it foid nothing about any active ſhare in the le-giſlative power to be poſſeſſed by the ſtates-general, and&nbsp;was ſilent both about the reſponſibility of miniſters and&nbsp;the liberty of the prefs. The king concluded by commanding the deputies immediately to retire, and to aſ-ſemble again on the following day. He then withdrew,&nbsp;and was followed by all the nobles and a part of the&nbsp;clergy. The commons remained in gloomy ſilence on&nbsp;their feats. It was interrupted by the grand maſter of&nbsp;the ceremonies, who reminded the preſident of the intentions of the king. Inſtantly the vehement count&nbsp;de Mirabeau, ſtarting from his feat, exclaimed with indignation, &quot; ſ'he commons of France have determined&nbsp;to debate, we have heard the intentions that have&nbsp;been ſuggeſted to the king ; and you, who cannot be&nbsp;his agent with the ſtates-general, you who have here&nbsp;neither feat nor voice, nor a right to ſpeak, are not&nbsp;the perfon to remind us of his ipeech. Go tell your&nbsp;maſter, that we are here by the power , of the people,&nbsp;and that nothing ſhall expel us but the bayonet.” '1 he&nbsp;applauſe of the aſſembly ſeconded the enthuſiaſm oſ the&nbsp;orator, and the maſter of the ceremonies withdrew in&nbsp;filence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">M. Camus then roſe ; and in a violent ſpeech indignantly ſtigmatiſed the royal ſeffion by the obnoxious appellation of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bed oſjufiice ;</span><span class="font1"> he concluded by moving&nbsp;that the aſſembly ſhould declare their unqualified adhe-rence to their former decrees. This motion was fol»&nbsp;lowed by another, pronouncing the perſons of the de-puties inviolable. Both were iuppoιted by Meſſrs Pc’&nbsp;tion, Barnave, Glaizen, the Abbés Gregoire, Sieyes,&nbsp;and many others, and were unanimouſly decreed. The&nbsp;aſſembly therefore continued their fittings in the uſual&nbsp;form. Οη the following day the majority of the clergy&nbsp;attended as mcmbers ; and on the 25th the duke of&nbsp;ûrleans, along with 49 of the deputies belonging to&nbsp;the order of nobles, joined them alſo. The remaining&nbsp;nobles, as well as the fmall minority of the clergy, now&nbsp;found themſelves aukwardly ſituated. whether on this&nbsp;account, or becauſe their leaders had by.this time formed a plan for carrying their point not by peaceable&nbsp;means but by the aid of a military force, the king,&nbsp;on the 27th, invited by a preffing letter both orders&nbsp;to join the commons. This requeſt was immediately&nbsp;complied with, although many of the nobility difoppro-ved of the raeaſure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ſituation of France was now become truly alarming, when the king retired from the aſſembly after the royal ſeffion, he was followed by more than 6000</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
