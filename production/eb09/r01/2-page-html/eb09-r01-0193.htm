<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">received gladly. Its vast significance was hardly understood. Both secular and spiritual potentates delighted in the beauty and fascination of those eloquent words which&nbsp;scholars, poets, and critics uttered—“ words indeed, but&nbsp;words which drew armed hosts behind them ! ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">If we look a little forward to the years 1492-1500, we obtain a second date of great importance. In these years&nbsp;the expedition of Charles VIII. to Naples opened Italy to&nbsp;' French, Spanish, and German interference. The leading&nbsp;nations of Europe began to compete for the prize of the&nbsp;peninsula, and learned meanwhile that culture which the&nbsp;Italians had perfected. In these years the secularization&nbsp;of the papacy was carried to its final point by Alexander&nbsp;VI., and the Reformation became inevitable. The same&nbsp;period w<sup>r</sup>as marked by the discovery of America, the&nbsp;exploration of the Indian seas, and the consolidation of&nbsp;the Spanish nationality. It also witnessed the application&nbsp;of printing to the diffusion of knowledge, the revolution&nbsp;effected in military operations by the use of gunpowder,&nbsp;and the revolution in cosmology which resulted from the&nbsp;Copernican discovery. Thus, speaking roughly, the half&nbsp;century between 1450 and 1500 may be termed the&nbsp;culminating point of the Renaissance. The transition&nbsp;from the mediaeval to the modern order was now secured&nbsp;if not accomplished, and a Rubicon had been crossed&nbsp;from which no retrogression to the past was possible.&nbsp;Looking yet a little farther, to the years 1527 and 1530, a&nbsp;third decisive date is reached. In the first of these years&nbsp;happened the sack of Rome, in the second the pacification&nbsp;of Italy by Charles V. under a Spanish hegemony. The&nbsp;age of the Renaissance was now closed for the land which&nbsp;gave it birth. The Reformation had taken firm hold on&nbsp;northern Europe. The Counter-Reformation was already&nbsp;imminent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It must not be imagined that so great a change as that implied by the Renaissance w<sup>T</sup>as accomplished without premonitory symptoms and previous endeavours. In the&nbsp;• main we mean by it the recovery of freedom for the human&nbsp;spirit after a long period of bondage to oppressive ecclesiastical and political orthodoxy,—a return to the liberal and&nbsp;practical conceptions of the world which the nations of&nbsp;antiquity had enjoyed, but upon a new and enlarged platform. This being so, it was inevitable that the finally successful efforts after self-emancipation should have been&nbsp;anticipated from time to time by strivings within the ages&nbsp;that are known as dark and mediaeval. It is therefore part&nbsp;of the present inquiry to pass in review some of the claimants to be considered precursors of the Renaissance. First&nbsp;of all must be named the Frank in whose lifetime the dual&nbsp;conception of universal empireand universal church, divinely&nbsp;appointed, sacred, and inviolable, began to control the order&nbsp;of European society. Charles the Great lent his forces to&nbsp;the plan of resuscitating the Roman empire at a moment&nbsp;when his own power made him the arbiter of western&nbsp;Europe, when the papacy needed his alliance, and when the&nbsp;Eastern empire had passed ·under the usurped regency of a&nbsp;female. He modelled a spurious Roman empire, which was&nbsp;surnamed “Holy,” in consequence of the diplomatic contract&nbsp;struck by him with the bishop of Rome, and in obedience&nbsp;to the prevailing theological beliefs of Latin Christianity.&nbsp;The Holy so-called Roman but essentially Teutonic empire&nbsp;owed such substance as the fabric possessed to Frankish&nbsp;armies and the sinews of the German people. As a structure composed of divers ill-connected parts it fell to pieces&nbsp;at its builder’s death, leaving little but the incubus of a&nbsp;memory, the fascination of a mighty name, to dominate&nbsp;the mind of mediaeval Europe. As an idea, the empire&nbsp;grew in visionary power, and remained one of the cliief&nbsp;obstacles in the way of both Italian and German national&nbsp;coherence. Real force was not in it, but rather in that</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">counterpart to its unlimited pretensions, the church, which had evolved it from barbarian night, and which used her&nbsp;own more vital energies for undermining the rival&nbsp;of her creation. Charles the Great, having proclaimed&nbsp;himself successor of the Csesars, was obscurely ambitious&nbsp;of imitating the August! also in the sphere of letters. He&nbsp;caused a scheme of humanistic education to be formulated,&nbsp;and gave employment at his court to rhetoricians, of whom&nbsp;Alcuin was the most considerable. But very little came of&nbsp;the revival of learning which Charles is supposed to have&nbsp;encouraged; and the empire he restored was accepted by&nbsp;the mediaeval intellect in a crudely theological and vaguely&nbsp;mystical spirit. We should, however, here remember&nbsp;that the study of Roman law, which was one important&nbsp;precursory symptom of the Renaissance, owed much to&nbsp;mediaeval respect for the empire as a divine institution.&nbsp;This, together with the municipal Italian intolerance of&nbsp;the Lombard and Frankish codes, kept alive the practice&nbsp;and revived the science of Latin jurisprudence at an early&nbsp;period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Philosophy attempted to free itself from the trammels s of theological orthodoxy in the hardy speculations of<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>some schoolmen, notably of Scotus Erigena and Abelard. |&nbsp;These innovators found, however, small support, and were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">j&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">defeated by opponents who used the same logical weapons&nbsp;with authority to back them. Nor were the rationalistic&nbsp;opinions of the Averroists without their value, though the&nbsp;church condemned these deviators from her discipline as&nbsp;heretics. Such mediteval materialists, moreover, had&nbsp;but feeble hold upon the substance of real knowledge.&nbsp;Imperfect acquaintance with authors whom they studied&nbsp;in Latin translations made by Jews from Arabic commentaries on Greek texts, together with almost total&nbsp;ignorance of natural laws, condemned them to sterility.&nbsp;Like the other schiomachists of their epoch, they fought&nbsp;with phantoms in a visionary realm. A similar judgment may be passed upon those Paulician, Albigensian,&nbsp;Paterine, and Epicurean dissenters from the Catholic&nbsp;creed who opposed the phalanxes of orthodoxy with frail&nbsp;imaginative weapons, and alarmed established orders in&nbsp;the state by the audacity of their communistic opinions.&nbsp;Physical science struggled into feeble life in the cells of&nbsp;Gerbert and Roger Bacon. But these men were accounted&nbsp;magicians by the vulgar; and, while the one eventually&nbsp;assumed the tiara, the other was incarcerated in a&nbsp;dungeon. The schools meanwhile resounded still to the&nbsp;interminable dispute upon abstractions. Are onlyuniversals&nbsp;real, or has each name a corresponding entity? From the&nbsp;midst of the Franciscans who had persecuted Roger Bacon&nbsp;because he presumed to know more than was consistent&nbsp;with human humility arose John of Parma, adopting and&nbsp;popularizing the mystic prophecy of Joachim of Flora.&nbsp;The reign of the Father is past; the reign of the&nbsp;Son is passing; the reign of the Spirit is at hand. Such&nbsp;was the formula of the Eternal Gospel, which, as an&nbsp;unconscious forecast of the Renaissance, has attracted&nbsp;retrospective students by its felicity of adaptation to&nbsp;their historical method. Yet we must remember that&nbsp;this bold intuition of the abbot Joachim indicated a&nbsp;monastic reaction against the tyrannies and corruptions of&nbsp;the church, rather than a fertile philosophical conception.&nbsp;The Fraticelli spiritualists, and similar sects who fed their&nbsp;imagination with his doctrine, expired in the flames to&nbsp;which Fra Dolcino, Longino,and Margharitawere consigned.&nbsp;To what extent the accusations of profligate morals&nbsp;brought against these reforming sectarians were justified&nbsp;remains doubtful; and the same uncertainty rests upon&nbsp;the alleged iniquities of the Templars. It is only certain&nbsp;that at this epoch the fabric of Catholic faith was&nbsp;threatened with various forms of prophetic and Oriental</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
