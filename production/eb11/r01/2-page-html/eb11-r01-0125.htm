<p><span class="font0">read off against a pointer from the scale seen with the left eve. For night use, means are provided for illuminating the scale. The range&nbsp;to lights may be ascertained by the use of the astigmatizer, an optical&nbsp;device by which a point of light is drawn out into a vertical streak.&nbsp;A beam of light from the objective falls on each reflector (fig. 2),&nbsp;and passing through the object-glasses, each is received by an arrangement of prisms about the centre of the tube, and reflected through&nbsp;the right eye-piece. Two partial images are thus seen. The images&nbsp;could be united by the rotation of one of the reflectors, but owing&nbsp;to the small base used the necessary movement would be so extremely&nbsp;small that it would be practically impossible to measure it. The&nbsp;difficulty has been surmounted by utilizing fixed reflectors and effecting coincidence by means of a prism of small angle. The deflecting&nbsp;prism is situated in the line of the beam of light from the reflector&nbsp;at the right-hand end of the tube. Its multiplying action is of&nbsp;great delicacy. The angle available for subdivision, to measure&nbsp;ranges between infinity and 250 yds., is only one-third of a degree.&nbsp;In a travel of 6 in. the prism renders accurate measurements possible&nbsp;within the required limits. To bring images of distant objectives&nbsp;into coincidence, the prism must be moved towards the eye-piece,&nbsp;and for near objectives in the opposite direction. The range scale&nbsp;is attached to the prism. A consequent advantage is that the&nbsp;accuracy of the instrument is not affected by back lash arising from&nbsp;wear, or irregularity in the actuating mechanism. When once&nbsp;installed, the instrument is always ready for use. Should adjustment be required it is readily and easily applied. It is not within&nbsp;the sphere of this article to enter into the detail of the adjusting&nbsp;mechanism. For further particulars the reader is referred to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers,</span><span class="font0"> 30th January&nbsp;1896. The working of the range-finder is so simple that its use is&nbsp;quickly learnt by any man who can read, and with little instruction&nbsp;and practice he can “ take a range ” in 8 to 12 seconds. Besides&nbsp;its principal purpose, in connexion with gunnery, there are minor&nbsp;uses in navigation and nautical surveying to which the range-finder&nbsp;can be applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the high speeds of modem war-vessels, guns and their objective approach each other so quickly that unless ranges can&nbsp;be communicated from the instrument to the guns with rapidity&nbsp;and accuracy the range-finder is deprived of much of its value.&nbsp;In connexion with the naval range-finder an apparatus is provided,&nbsp;which though not part of the range-finder is sufficiently important&nbsp;to claim passing notice. The apparatus consists of a transmitting&nbsp;and a receiving instrument of clockwork mechanism electrically&nbsp;controlled. In appearance they resemble the ordinary engine-room&nbsp;telegraph, on the dials of which ranges take the place of orders.&nbsp;The transmitter can communicate with a number of receiving&nbsp;instruments, disposed as required in different parts of the ship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. Before the introduction of the Marindin range-finder described below, the British army in the field used the “ mekometer.” The instruments used by the cavalry and infantry&nbsp;are smaller and lighter than those of the artillery pattern,&nbsp;but the principle involved is identical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mekometer is practically a box sextant. Two instruments are used simultaneously at the ends of a base of fixed length. One&nbsp;sextant, called the right-angle instrument, is fitted with index and&nbsp;horizon glasses permanently inclined at 45°. It consequently&nbsp;measures a right angle. In the other sextant, called the reading&nbsp;instrument, a graduated drum takes the place of the usual index&nbsp;arm and scale. The drum is graduated spirally with a scale of&nbsp;ranges. Both reading and right-angle instruments are fitted with&nbsp;a vane of gun metal with a white strip down the centre to facilitate&nbsp;observations. Telescopes of low power can be fitted to the instru-ments, and two cords of 50 (or 25i) yds, are provided with which&nbsp;to measure the base.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two observers attach the ends of the cord of fixed length (usually 50 yds.) to their instruments and separate until it is taut. The&nbsp;observer with the right-angle instrument moves into such&nbsp;a position that coincidence of image will be given between&nbsp;the objective and the vane of the instrument at the other</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">end of the base, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> he makes ABC a right angle (fig. 3).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the right angle is established, the observer at C turns the graduated drum of the reading instrument until the image of the&nbsp;vane of the right angle instrument coincides with the direction of&nbsp;the objective. The range AC is then read on the drum. The&nbsp;ranges on the drum are measures of the angle BAC when the base&nbsp;BC is 50 yds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mekometer is open to the objection which is common to all range-finders requiring more than one observer. There </span><span class="font1">is </span><span class="font0">always a&nbsp;danger that observers may cause coincidence on different objectives&nbsp;or on different parts of the same objective, and thus inaccuracy in the&nbsp;recorded range must result. The instruments are expected to give an&nbsp;accuracy of less than</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2 % at 2000 yds. For</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ranges over that distance, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> for usual</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">artillery ranges, it is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">desirable to use a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">double base (100 yds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">in length), in which</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">case the range registered on the drum must</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">be doubled. This operation, although slight,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is a distinct disadvantage, since it adds to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">time of taking a range</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and is a possible source</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of error. For field</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">artillery, however, a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">range-finder is only an</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">auxiliary adjunct. The true range can be found by a process of trial and error (see Artillery) in as short a time as the&nbsp;mekometer observers take to report it. It must further be&nbsp;remembered that as shrapnel is the principal projectile of field&nbsp;artillery, not only the correct elevation but also the true length of&nbsp;time fuse has to be found. This the range-finder cannot do. Hence&nbsp;it is that the range-finder for field artillery, although a valuable&nbsp;auxiliary, is not of the same importance as in purely defensive&nbsp;positions, such as batteries for harbour defence, and land forts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Marindin range-finder was from 1908 gradually introduced in the infantry to replace the mekometer. It was the invention of Captain A. H. Marindin, of the Black Watch&nbsp;(Royal Highlanders).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principle of the instrument is that of coincidence, as in the Gautier Christie, Le Cyre, Souchier, and Barr and Stroud. But&nbsp;it differs from the last mentioned în that the right prism is made&nbsp;movable, and this movement (necessarily extremely small) is a&nbsp;function of the recorded range.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The steel tube, forming the base of the instrument, which carries the prisms, is supported inside an aluminium outer tube in such a&nbsp;way that no direct shock is communicated to it. The&nbsp;appearance of the outside of the instrument, together&nbsp;with the names of the various parts, is shown in fig. 4</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The instrument can be used in two main positions, viz. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">horizontally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">for ranging on upright objects, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vertically,</span><span class="font0"> for ranging on horizontal targets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For instance, in the diagram (fig. 5) of a road running uphill, the instrument could be held in any of the three positions indicated,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and would give good ranges, but probably the best range would be obtained if held as at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0">. If it is required to use the instrument</span></p>
