<p><span class="font0">the latter half of the 5th or beginning of the 6th century, wrote </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Adventures of Leucippe and Cleitophon,</span><span class="font0"> upon&nbsp;the model of Heliodorus; though an ingenious story, it&nbsp;does not reach the standard of the work it imitates. Like&nbsp;his predecessor, Achilles uses the marvellous with discretion, but the accumulation of difficulties is very tedious.&nbsp;Leucippe and Cleitophon fall in love and fly to escape&nbsp;parental anger. They suffer shipwreck, are seized by&nbsp;brigands, and separated. Cleitophon first believes that&nbsp;Leucippe is dead, then finds her, to lose her once more,&nbsp;and again to meet her, a slave, at the very time he is&nbsp;going to marry her mistress, Melitta, a rich Ephesian&nbsp;widow. It so happens that the husband of the latter&nbsp;is not dead but returns to persecute with his love and&nbsp;jealousy both Leucippe and Cleitophon. The descriptions&nbsp;are the best part, the incidents being either tiresome or&nbsp;repulsive and the character of the hero pitiable. Most of&nbsp;the book is written with taste and judgment, but the&nbsp;digressions are too frequent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Achiljes Tatius is the last of these authors who can be said to have the slightest merit. Of the romances which&nbsp;followed his one of the least bad is perhaps </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chæreas and&nbsp;Callirhoe,</span><span class="font0"> by one who called himself Chariton of Aphro-disias, placed by various authorities between the 5th and&nbsp;the 9th century. Here the two lovers are already married,&nbsp;and as usual are of superhuman beauty. Unfortunately&nbsp;Chæreas possesses a somewhat irritable temper, and on a&nbsp;jealous suspicion gives his lovely wife a terrible kick in&nbsp;the stomach. She is considered dead and is carried to&nbsp;her grave. But during the night brigands carry her away&nbsp;to Ionia, where her purchaser, Dionysius, falls in love with&nbsp;her. The wife remains faithful to her husband, but, as&nbsp;she is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">enceinte,</span><span class="font0"> consents to marry Dionysius in order that&nbsp;her child may have a father. Meanwhile Chæreas, having&nbsp;learned the ravishment of the supposed corpse, starts in&nbsp;pursuit of his wife. He also is captured by pirates and&nbsp;taken to Caria. The two finally come together, when&nbsp;Callirhoe forsakes Dionysius and her son and returns to&nbsp;Sicily with her first husband.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Equally frigid was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Loves of Hysmine and Hysmiηiαs </span><span class="font0">by Eustathius or Eumathius, probably a Byzantine, who&nbsp;is placed by Wolf as late as the l2th century, but who&nbsp;may have lived six hundred years earlier. Only a few&nbsp;more remain to be mentioned. Philip of Amphipolis wrote&nbsp;'Poδtακα (specially referred to by Suidas for its obscenity),&nbsp;θασtακα, and other works, all lost. Severus of Alexandria,&nbsp;a man of fortune with a large library, living in the latter&nbsp;part of the 5th century, has left a few short stories after&nbsp;the style of Parthenius. Photius (cod. 130) also preserves&nbsp;the titles of some works by a certain Damascius, such as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Incredible Fictions, Tales of Demons, Marvellous Stories of&nbsp;Appearances from the Dead,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. The same authority tells&nbsp;us (cod. 188) of a writer of the name of Alexander who&nbsp;compiled a book of marvels. The credit of having written&nbsp;the worst of the Greek romances may be claimed either by&nbsp;Theodoras Prodromus, a monk of the early part of the l2th&nbsp;century, for his metrical history, in nine books, of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhod-αnthe and Dosixles,</span><span class="font0"> or by Nicetas Eugenianus, who lived&nbsp;somewhat later, for his iambic poem </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Lives&nbsp;of Dmsilla and Charùles,</span><span class="font0"> imitated from the former work.&nbsp;Constantinus Manasses (also l2th century) composed a&nbsp;poetical romance on the loves of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aristαnder and Callisthia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">fragments of which were first printed by Villoison </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Amecdota&nbsp;Græca,</span><span class="font0"> 1781).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under Barlaam and Josaphat (vol. iii. p. 375) will be found the origin and development of the story by St John&nbsp;of Damascus, which belongs rather to religious apologues&nbsp;than to romances. Its origin is entirely Eastern, from&nbsp;India. The early Christians eagerly seized upon fiction&nbsp;as affording them a vehicle for spreading their views.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Their contributions to our subject have a strong family likeness, and usually either close with a martyrdom or are&nbsp;written in praise of a monastic life. To the former class&nbsp;belong the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clementine Recognitions</span><span class="font0"> (2d century), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paul and&nbsp;Thekla</span><span class="font0"> (3d century), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cyprian and Justina,</span><span class="font0"> which contains the germs of the episode of Faust and Gretchen. The&nbsp;ascetic novels include </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Xenophon and his Sons, Euphrosyne,&nbsp;Zosimus and Mary, Thais,</span><span class="font0"> Ac. Christian imaginary travels&nbsp;are represented by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Voyage of Macarius to Paradise&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and comic tales by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agape, Irene,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chioηia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides the forged letters attributed to men of mark, we have from the Greek sophists collections of fictitious&nbsp;letters serving the same purpose as the epistolary novels&nbsp;of Rousseau and Richardson. The best known of those&nbsp;writers were Alciphron, Aristænetus, and Theophylactus&nbsp;Simocatta. Alciphron, the most eminent, of whom we&nbsp;possess 116 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters</span><span class="font0"> in three books, lived in the 3d or 4th&nbsp;century. Many of the letters are written by courtezans&nbsp;and supply curious information on contemporary life and&nbsp;manners. The fifty </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Erotic Epistles</span><span class="font0"> of Aristænetus form&nbsp;a much less entertaining series than those of Alciphron.&nbsp;Theophylactus Simocatta, an Egyptian by birth, died at&nbsp;Constantinople about the year 640. He wrote eighty-five&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters,</span><span class="font0"> divided into moral, rustic, and amatory. They&nbsp;are little else than brief moral treatises mingled with&nbsp;stories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The review of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">origines</span><span class="font0"> of the Greek novel shows that it arose with the decay of old Greek literature and carried&nbsp;on a feeble existence down to the 12th century. Two&nbsp;facts make themselves apparent. First, the romance (or&nbsp;novel) proper came late into the field, where it remained&nbsp;in a secondary place ; and secondly, it invariably turned&nbsp;upon a hackneyed circle of incidents and never attained&nbsp;anything of the highly artistic development reached by&nbsp;modern examples. The sameness observable in Greek&nbsp;romance arises from the fact that it was the product of&nbsp;literary decrepitude and impotence. The writers were incapable of rivalling the glories of the old Hellenic literature, and they endeavoured to supply originality with&nbsp;reminiscences more or less disguised. The literary and&nbsp;social surroundings in which these authors passed their&nbsp;lives gave them few fresh subjects for investigation, and&nbsp;the characters they describe are mere names. Human&nbsp;nature and the human heart have little meaning for them ;&nbsp;but, as with the Western writers of fiction who closely follow&nbsp;them in point of date, incident is crowded upon incident&nbsp;to the verge of satiety, in order that the attention of the&nbsp;reader may never flag.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The contributions of Roman literature are limited to productions by two writers, Petronius and Apuleius and&nbsp;one story by Martianus Capella, of more recent date and&nbsp;less typical nature. In the comic romance of Petronius&nbsp;Arbiter </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{g.v.'),</span><span class="font0"> the tale of the matron of Ephesus first&nbsp;appears among Western popular fictions. This was undoubtedly one of the Ephesian tales already referred to.&nbsp;We find it reproduced in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seven Wise Masters,</span><span class="font0"> in the&nbsp;French </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fabliaux,</span><span class="font0"> and in Brantôme. It is also to be found&nbsp;in the Chinese. The opening words of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Golden Ass&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Apuleius indicate that his romance and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ass</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Lucian were both inspired from the same source, perhaps through the medium of Lucius of Patræ mentioned&nbsp;by Photius. Lucian seems to have reproduced the story&nbsp;in a condensed form ; the Latin writer paraphrased and&nbsp;embellished it with other tales, among which the best&nbsp;known is that of Cupid and Psyche,—an antique gem in&nbsp;an unworthy setting. The hero, punished for his curiosity&nbsp;by being turned into an ass, passes through adventures&nbsp;similar in kind to those depicted in the Greek romance.&nbsp;The story ends with a fine description of the mysteries&nbsp;of Isis, into which the hero is initiated and through</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
