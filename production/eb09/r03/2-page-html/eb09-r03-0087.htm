        <p><span class="font2">which were gathering unnoticed in the distant regions beyond the
                limits of the “ Roman peace.” In the East&nbsp;Rome and Parthia still faced each
                other upon the banks&nbsp;of the Euphrates, and contended, now by arms now
                by&nbsp;diplomacy, for supremacy in the debateable land of&nbsp;Armenia. Trajan’s
                momentary acquisitions were abandoned by Hadrian, and on this side of the empire the
                first&nbsp;changes of importance on the frontier belong to the reign&nbsp;of
                Septimius Severus.@@<sup>1</sup> Within the frontiers the levelling&nbsp;and
                unifying process commenced by Augustus had steadily&nbsp;proceeded. A tolerably
                uniform provincial system covered&nbsp;the whole area of the empire. The client
                states had one&nbsp;by one been reconstituted as provinces, and even
                the&nbsp;government of Italy had been in many respects assimilated&nbsp;to the
                provincial type. The municipal system had spread&nbsp;widely ; the period from
                Yespasian to Aurelius witnessed&nbsp;the elevation to municipal rank of an immense
                number of&nbsp;communities, not only in the old provinces of the West,
                in&nbsp;Africa, Spain, and Gaul, but in the newer provinces of the&nbsp;North, and
                along the line of the northern frontier ; and&nbsp;everywhere under the influence of
                the central imperial&nbsp;authority there was an increasing uniformity in the
                form&nbsp;of the local constitutions, framed and granted as they all&nbsp;were by
                imperial edict.@@<sup>2</sup> Throughout the empire again the&nbsp;extension of the
                Roman franchise was preparing the way&nbsp;for the final act by which Caracalla
                assimilated the legal&nbsp;status of all free-born inhabitants of the
                    empire,@@<sup>3</sup> and in&nbsp;the west and north this was preceded and
                accompanied by&nbsp;the complete Romanizing of the people in language
                and&nbsp;civilization. Moreover, the empire, that was thus becoming one in its
                administrative system, its laws, and its&nbsp;civilization, had as yet continued to
                enjoy peace and order.&nbsp;The burdens of military service fell on the frontier
                provinces, and only the echoes of the border wars reached&nbsp;the Mediterranean
                territories. Yet, in spite of the internal&nbsp;tranquillity and the good government
                which have made the&nbsp;age of the Antonines famous, we can detect signs of
                weakness. Though the evils of excessive centralization were&nbsp;hardly felt while
                the central authority was wielded by&nbsp;vigorous rulers, yet even under Trajan,
                Hadrian, and&nbsp;the Antonines we notice a ailure of strength in the&nbsp;empire as
                a whole, and a corresponding increase of pressure on the imperial government itself.
                The reforms of&nbsp;Augustus had given free play to powers still fresh
                and&nbsp;vigorous. The ceaseless labours of Hadrian were directed&nbsp;mainly to the
                careful husbanding of such strength as still&nbsp;remained, or to attempts at
                reviving it by the sheer force of&nbsp;imperial authority. Among the symptoms of
                incipient&nbsp;decline which not the most heroic efforts of the
                government&nbsp;could entirely remove were the growing depopulation&nbsp;especially
                of the central districts of the empire, the constant financial difficulties, the
                deterioration in character of&nbsp;the local governments in the provincial
                    communities,@@<sup>4</sup> and&nbsp;the increasing reluctance exhibited by all
                classes to undertake the now onerous burden of municipal office. Lastly,&nbsp;the
                irruption of the Marcomanni, and the revolt of&nbsp;Avidius Cassius (174-175) in the
                Eastern provinces,&nbsp;anticipated the two most serious of the dangers
                which&nbsp;ultimately proved fatal to the empire.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">MarcusAureliusdied in 180, and his death was followed by a century of
                war and disorder, during which nothing&nbsp;but the stern rule of soldier emperors,
                such as Septimius&nbsp;Severus, Decius, Claudius, Aurelian, and Probus saved
                the&nbsp;empire from dissolution. The want of any legal security</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">for the orderly transmission of the imperial power had been partially
                supplied during the 2d century by the practice&nbsp;of adoption. But throughout the
                3d century the Roman&nbsp;world witnessed a series of desperate conflicts
                between&nbsp;rival generals put forward by their respective legions
                as&nbsp;claimants for the imperial purple. Between the death of&nbsp;Severus in 211
                and the accession of Diocletian in 284, no&nbsp;fewer than twenty-three emperors sat
                in the seat of&nbsp;Augustus, and of these all but three died violent deaths&nbsp;at
                the hands of a mutinous soldiery or by the orders of a&nbsp;successful rival. Of the
                remaining three, Decius fell in&nbsp;battle against the Goths, Valerian died a
                prisoner in the&nbsp;far East, and Claudius was among the victims of the
                chronic&nbsp;pestilence which added to the miseries of the time. The&nbsp;“tyrants,”
                as the Unsuccessfulpretenders to the imperial&nbsp;purple were styled, reappear with
                almost unfailing regularity in each reign. The claims of Septimius
                Severus&nbsp;himself, the first and ablest of the soldier emperors,
                were&nbsp;disputed by Clodius Albinus in the West, and by Pescen-nius Niger in the
                East, and at the bloody battle of Lug-dunum and the sack of Byzantium rival Roman
                forces,&nbsp;for the first time since the accession of Vespasian,
                exhausted&nbsp;each other in civil war.@@<sup>5</sup> In 237-238 six emperors
                perished&nbsp;in the course of a few months. It was, however, during&nbsp;the reign
                of Gallienus (260-2δ'J) that the evil reached its&nbsp;height. The central authority
                was paralysed ; the barbarians were pouring in from the North; the
                Parthians&nbsp;were threatening to overrun the Eastern provinces; and&nbsp;the
                legions on the frontiers were left to repel the enemies&nbsp;of Rome as best they
                could. A hundred ties bound them&nbsp;closely to the districts in which they were
                stationed;&nbsp;their permanent camps had grown into towns, they had&nbsp;families
                and farms; the unarmed provincials looked to&nbsp;them as their natural protectors,
                and were attached to&nbsp;them by bonds of intermarriage and by long
                intercourse.&nbsp;Now that they found themselves left to repel by their
                own&nbsp;efforts the invaders from without, they reasonably enough&nbsp;claimed the
                right to ignore the central authority which&nbsp;was powerless to aid them, and to
                choose for themselves&nbsp;“ imperatores ” whom they knew and trusted. The
                first&nbsp;of these provincial empires was that established by&nbsp;Postumus in Gaul
                (259-272), and long maintained by his&nbsp;successors Adctorinus and
                    Tetricus.@@<sup>6</sup> Their authority was&nbsp;acknowledged, not only in Gaul
                and by the troops on the&nbsp;Rhine, but by the legions of Britain and Spain ; and
                under&nbsp;Postumus at any rate (259-269) the existence of the&nbsp;Gallic empire
                was justified by the repulse of the barbarians&nbsp;and by the restoration of peace
                and security to the&nbsp;provinces of Gaul. On the Danube, in Greece, and
                in&nbsp;Asia Minor none of the “pretenders” enjoyed more&nbsp;than a passing
                success. It was otherwise in the far East,&nbsp;where the Syrian Odænathus, prince
                of Palmyra,@@<sup>7</sup> though <sup>1&nbsp;</sup>officially only the governor of
                the East (dux Orientis)&nbsp;under Gallienus, drove the Persians out of Asia Minor
                ‘&nbsp;and Syria, recovered Mesopotamia, and ruled Syria, -Arabia, Armenia,
                Cappadocia, and Cilicia with all the&nbsp;independence of a sovereign. Odænathus was
                murdered&nbsp;in 266. His young son Vaballathus succeeded him in&nbsp;his titles,
                but the real power was vested in his widow&nbsp;Zenobia, under whom not only the
                greater part of Asia&nbsp;Minor but even the province of Egypt was forcibly
                added&nbsp;to the dominions governed in the name of Gallienus by&nbsp;the Palmyrene
                prince.</span></p>
