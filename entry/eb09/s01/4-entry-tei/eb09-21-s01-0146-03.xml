or <hi rend="smallcaps">Saugor,</hi> a British district of India, situated in the extreme north-west of the Central Provinces, and comprised between 23° 4' and 24° 27' N. lat., and between 78° 6' and 79° 12' E. long., with a total area of 4005 square miles. It is bounded on the N. by the Lálitpur district of the North-Western Provinces and the native states of Bijáwar, Panná, and Charkhári; on the E. by Panná and Damoh district; on the S. by Narsinhpur district and the native state of Bhopal; and on the W. also by Bhopal. Ságar district is an extensive, elevated, and in parts tolerably level plain, broken in places by low hills of the Vindhyan sandstone. It is traversed by numerous streams, chief of which are the Sunar, Beás, Dhupan, and Bina, all flowing in a northerly direction towards the valley of the Ganges. In the southern and central parts the soil is black, formed by decaying trap; to the north and east it is a reddish-brown alluvium. Iron ore of excellent quality is found and worked at Hirapur, a small village in the extreme north-east. The district contains several densely wooded tracts, the largest of which is the Ramna teak forest preserve in the north. Roads are the only means of communication; of these the total length is 134 miles, 50 being returned as first class. The climate is moderate; the average temperature is 75°, and the average rainfall is about 46 inches.</p><p>By the census of 1881 the population numbered 564,950 (294,795 males and 270,155 females). Hindus numbered 498,071, Mohammedans 25,396, Buddhists and Jains 16,432, Christians 1034, and aboriginals 19,144. The only town except the capital (sec below) with a population exceeding 10,000 is Garhakota, which contains 11,414 inhabitants. Of the total area only 1396 square miles are cultivated, and of the portion lying waste 1220 are returned as cultivable. Wheat forms the principal crop, which is produced in large quantities all over the district; other products are food grains, rice, oil-seeds, cotton, and sugar-cane. Cattle and buffaloes are bred to a large extent both for draught and carnage, and also<pb facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0165.jp2" xml:id="eb09-21-s01-0147"/>
for dairy purposes, especially for the manufacture of ghee. The revenue of Sagar district in 1883-84 amounted to £68,376, of which the land-tax contributed £44,429.</p><p>By a treaty concluded with Baji Rao in 1818, the greater part of the present district was made over to the British. During the mutiny of 1857 the whole district was in the possession of the rebels, excepting the town and fort, in which the Europeans were shut up for eight months, till relieved early in the following year by Sir Hugh Rose. The rebels were totally defeated and order was again restored by March 1858. Sagar was formed into a separate district of the Central Provinces in 1861.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
