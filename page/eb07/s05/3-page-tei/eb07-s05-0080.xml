All these varieties will take place at those small and insensible distances which are between A and H, and may produce all that variety which we observe in the tangible or mechanical forms of bodies, such as elasticity, ductility, hardness, softness, fluidity, vapour, and all those unseen motions or actions which we observe in fusion and congelation, evaporation and condensation, solution and precipitation, crystallization, vegetable and animal assimilation and secretion, &amp;c. ; while all bodies must be, in a certain degree, elastic, all must gravitate, and all must be incompenetrable.</p><p>This general and satisfactory resemblance between the appearance of tangible matter and the legitimate consequence of this general hypothetical property of an atom of matter, affords a considerable probability that such is the origin of all the phenomena. We earnestly recommend to our readers a careful perusal of Boscovichâ€™s celebrated treatise. A careful perusal is necessary for seeing its value ; and nothing will be got by a hasty inspection. The rentier will be particularly pleased with the facility and evidence with which the ingenious author has deduced all the ordinary principles of mechanics, and with the explanation which he has given of fluidity, and his deduction from thence of the laws of hydrostatics. No part of the treatise is more valuable than the doctrine of the propagation of pressure through solid bodies. This, however, is but just touched on in the course of the investigation of the principles of mechanics. We shall borrow as much as will suffice for our present inquiry into the strength of materials ; and we trust that our readers are not displeased with this general sketch of the doctrine (if it may be so called) of the cohesion of bodies. It is curious and important in itself, and is the foundation of all the knowledge which we can acquire of the present article. We are sorry to say that it is as yet a new subject of study ; but it is a very promising one, and we by no means despair of seeing the whole of chemistry brought by its means within the pale of mechanical science. The great and distinguishing agent in chemistry is beat, or fire the cause of heat ; and one of its most singular effects is the conversion of bodies into elastic vapour. We have the clearest evidence that this is brought about by mechanical forces; for it can be opposed or prevented by external pressure, a very familiar mechanical force. We may perhaps find another mechanical force which will prevent fusion.</p><p>Having now made our readers familiar with the mode of action in which cohesion operates in giving strength to solid bodies, we proceed to consider the strains to which this strength is opposed.</p><p>A piece of solid matter is exposed to four kinds of strains, different in the manner of their operation.</p><p>1.	It may be torn asunder, as in the case of ropes, stretchers, king-posts, tie-beams, &amp;c.</p><p>2.	It may be crushed, as in the case of pillars, posts, and truss-beams.</p><p>3.	It may be broken across, as happens to a joist or lever of any kind.</p><p>4.	It may be wrenched or twisted, as in the case of the axle of a wheel, the nail of a press, &amp;c.</p><p>I	IT MAY BE PULLED ASUNDER.</p><p>This is the simplest of all strains, and the others are indeed modifications of it. To this the force of cohesion is <hi rend="italic">directly</hi> opposed, with very little modification of its action by any particular circumstances.</p><p>When a long cylindrical or prismatic body, such as a rod of wood or metal, or a rope, is drawn by one end, it must be resisted at the other, in order to bring its cohesion into action. When it is fastened at one end, we cannot conceive it any other way than as equally stretched in all its parts ; for all our observations and experiments on natural bodies concur in showing us that the forces which connect their particles in any way whatever are equal and opposite. This is called the <hi rend="italic">third law of motion ;</hi> and we admit its universality, while we affirm that it is purely experimental. Yet we have met with dissertations by persons of eminent knowledge, where propositions are maintained inconsistent with this. During the dispute about the communication of motion, some of the ablest writers have said, that a spring compressed or stretched at the two ends was gradually less and less compressed or stretched from the extremities towards the middle: but the same writers acknowledged the universal equality of action and re-action, which is quite incompatible with this state of the spring. No such inequality of compression or dilatation has ever been observed ; and a little reflection will show it to be impossible, in consistency with the equality of action and re-action.</p><p>Since all parts are thus equally stretched, it follows that the strain in any transverse section is the same, as also in every point of that section. If therefore the body be supposed of a homogeneous texture, the cohesion of the parts is equable ; and since every part is equally stretched, the particles are drawn to equal distances from their quiescent positions, and the forces which are thus excited, and now exerted in opposition to the straining force, are equal. This external force may be increased by degrees, which will gradually separate the parts of the body more and more from each other, and the connecting forces increase with this increase of distance, till at last the cohesion of some particles is overcome. This must be immediately followed by a rupture, because the remaining forces are now weaker than before.</p><p>It is the united force of cohesion, immediately before the disunion of the first particles, that we call the <hi rend="italic">strength</hi> of the section. It may also be properly called its <hi rend="italic">absolute strength,</hi> being exerted in the simplest form, and not modified by any relation to other circumstances.</p><p>If the external force have not produced any permanent change on the body, and it therefore recovers its former dimensions when the force is withdrawn, it is plain that this strain may be repeated as often as we please, and the body which withstands it once will always withstand it. It is evident that this should be attended to in all constructions, and that in all our investigations on this subject this should be kept strictly in view. When we treat a piece of soft clay in this manner, and with this precaution, the force employed must be very small. If we exceed this, we produce a permanent change. The rod of clay is not indeed torn asunder, but it has become somewhat more slender ; the number of particles in a cross section is now smaller ; and therefore, although it will again, in this new form, suffer or allow an endless repetition of a <hi rend="italic">certain</hi> strain without any farther permanent change, this strain is smaller than the former.</p><p>Something of the same kind happens in all bodies which receive a <hi rend="italic">set</hi> by the strain to which they are exposed. All ductile bodies are of this kind. But there are many bodies which are not ductile. Such bodies break completely whenever they are stretched beyond the limit of their perfect elasticity. Bodies of a fibrous structure exhibit very great</p></body></text></TEI>
