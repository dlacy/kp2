 in <hi rend="italic">Antiquity,</hi> a stratagem or device of the Laced√¶monians, for the secret writing of letters to their correspondents, so that if they should chance to be intercepted, nobody might be able to read them.</p><p>To this end they had two wooden rollers or cylinders, perfectly alike and equal ; one of which was kept in the city, the other by the person to whom the letter was directed. For the letter, a skin of very thin parchment was wrapped round the roller, on which the matter was written ; and this being done, it was taken off, and sent away to the party, who, upon putting it in the same manner upon his roller, found the lines and words in the very same disposition as when they were first written.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
