<p><span class="font0">RE, an island on the coast of France, in the department of La V endée, and the arrondissement of Rochelle. It stands&nbsp;about seven miles from the mainland, has a very irregular&nbsp;shape, is eleven miles in length, and in the widest part three&nbsp;miles in breadth. The chief town is St Martins, which has&nbsp;3000 inhabitants, and is defended by a strong citadel. The&nbsp;soil is fertile, yielding abundance of grapes, which are mostly&nbsp;used to make brandy ; and on the shore much salt is made.&nbsp;There are two other towns, called La Flotte and Ars, of&nbsp;more than 3000 inhabitants each ; and the whole population&nbsp;of the island amounts to 18,540. It was attacked by the&nbsp;English in the reign of Charles I., after the Duke of Buckingham’s unsuccessful attempt to relieve Rochelle in 1627,&nbsp;but was able to resist. Long. 1. 33. 25. E.

<p><span class="font0">READING, the art of delivering written language with propriety, force, and elegance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ We must not judge so unfavourably of eloquence or good reading,” says Fénélon, “ as to reckon it only a frivolous art, that a declaimer uses to impose upon the weak&nbsp;imagination of the multitude, and to serve his own ends.&nbsp;It is a very serious art, designed to instruct people ; to suppress their passions and reform their manners ; to support&nbsp;the laws, direct public councils, and to make men good and&nbsp;happy.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reason and experience equally demonstrate, that delivery in reading ought to be less animated than in interested speaking. In every exercise of the faculty of speech, and those&nbsp;expressions of countenance and gesture with which it is&nbsp;generally attended, we may be considered as being always&nbsp;in one of the two following situations : First, delivering&nbsp;our bosom sentiments on circumstances which relate to ourselves or others ; or, secondly, repeating something that was&nbsp;spoken on a certain occasion for the amusement or information of an auditor. Now, if we observe the deliveries natural to these two situations, we shall find, that the first may&nbsp;be accompanied with every degree of expression which can&nbsp;manifest itself in us, from the lowest of sympathy to the&nbsp;most violent and energetic of the superior passions; whilst&nbsp;the latter, from the speaker’s chief business being to repeat&nbsp;what he heard with accuracy, discovers only a faint imitation of those signs of the emotions which we suppose agitated him from whom the words were first borrowed. The&nbsp;use and necessity of this difference of manner is evident ;&nbsp;and if we are attentive to these natural signs of expression,&nbsp;we shall find them conforming with the greatest nicety to&nbsp;the slightest and most minute movements of the breast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This repetition of another’s words might be supposed to pass through the mouth of a second or third person ; and in&nbsp;these cases, since they were not ear and eye witnesses of&nbsp;him who first spoke them, their manner of delivery would&nbsp;want the advantage necessarily arising from an immediate&nbsp;idea of the original one ; hence, for the reason stated, this&nbsp;would be of still less lively representation than that of the first '&nbsp;repeater. But as, from a daily observation of every variety&nbsp;of speech and its associated signs of emotion, mankind soon&nbsp;become pretty well acquainted with them, and this in different degrees, according to their discernment, sensibility,&nbsp;&amp;c. experience shows us that these latter repeaters, as we&nbsp;call them, might conceive and employ a manner of delivery&nbsp;which, though less characteristic perhaps, would on the&nbsp;whole be noways inferior to the first, as to the common&nbsp;natural expression proper for their situation. It appears,&nbsp;therefore, that repeaters of every degree may be esteemed&nbsp;upon a level as to animation, and that our twofold distinction&nbsp;above specified contains accurately enough the whole variety&nbsp;of ordinary delivery. We say ordinary, because there is another very peculiar kind of delivery sometimes used in the&nbsp;person of a repeater, and of which it will in this place be necessary to take some notice. What we mean here is mimicry ;&nbsp;an accomplishment which, when perfectly and properly displayed, never fails of yielding a high degree of pleasure.&nbsp;But since this pleasure chiefly results from the principle of&nbsp;imitation respecting manner, and not from the purport of&nbsp;the matter communicated ; and since, comparatively speaking, it is only attainable by few persons, and practised only&nbsp;on j&gt;articular occasions ; upon these accounts it must be refused a place amongst the modes of useful delivery taught&nbsp;us by nature, and must be esteemed a qualification purely&nbsp;anomalous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These distinctions with regard to a speaker’s situation of mind being premised, let us see to which of them an author&nbsp;and his reader may mest properly be referred, and how they&nbsp;are circumstanced with regard to one another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The matter of all books is, either what the author says in his own person, or an acknowledged recital of the words&nbsp;of others ; and hence an author may be esteemed both an&nbsp;original speaker and a repeater, according as what he writes&nbsp;is of the first or second kind. Now a reader must be supposed either actually to personate the author, or one whose&nbsp;office is barely to communicate what he has said to an auditor. But in the first of these suppositions he would, in&nbsp;the delivery of what was the author’s own, evidently commence mimic ; which being, as above observed, a character not generally acknowledged in this department, ought&nbsp;to be rejected as on the whole improper. The other supposition therefore must be accounted right ; and then, as&nbsp;to the whole matter of the book, the reader is found to&nbsp;be exactly in the situation of a repeater, save that he takes&nbsp;what he delivers from the page before him instead of his&nbsp;memory. It follows, then, in proof of our initial proposition,&nbsp;that if we are directed by nature and propriety, the manner of our delivery in reading ought to be inferior in warmth&nbsp;and energy to what we should use, were the language the&nbsp;spontaneous effusion of our own hearts in the circumstances&nbsp;of those out of whose mouths it is supposed to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Evident as the purport of this reasoning is, it has not so much as been glanced at by the writers on the subject we&nbsp;are now entered upon, or any of its kindred ones ; which&nbsp;has occasioned a manifest want of accuracy in several of&nbsp;their rules and observations. Amongst the rest, this precept&nbsp;has long been reverberated from author to author as a perfect standard for propriety in reading : “ Deliver yourselves&nbsp;in the same manner you would do, were the matter your&nbsp;own original sentiments uttered directly from the heart.”&nbsp;As all kinds of delivery must have many things in common,&nbsp;the rule will in many articles be undoubtedly right ; but,&nbsp;from what has been said above, it must as certainly be faulty&nbsp;in respect to several others ; as it is evident nature never&nbsp;confounds by like signs two tilings so very different as a copy&nbsp;and an original, an emanation darted immediately from the&nbsp;sun, and its weaker appearance in the lunar reflection.</span></p>
