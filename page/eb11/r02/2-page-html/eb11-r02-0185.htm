<p><span class="font3">the free importation of corn from abroad, and the abolition of the mischievous monopoly of the Iceland trade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But the financial distress of Denmark, the jealousy of the duchies, the ruinous political complications of the Napoleonic&nbsp;period, and, above all, the Crown Prince Frederick’s growing&nbsp;jealousy of his official advisers, which led him to rule, or rather&nbsp;misrule, for years without the co-operation of his Council of&nbsp;State—all these calamities were at last too much even for&nbsp;Reventlow. On 7th December 1813 he received his dismissal&nbsp;and retired to his estates, where, after working cheerfully&nbsp;among his peasantry to the last, he died on the nth of&nbsp;October 1827.</span></p>

The other important department&nbsp;engaged in the collection of the English revenue is the Board&nbsp;of . Customs and Excise. The excise department was formerly&nbsp;a branch of the inland revenue, but was amalgamated with the&nbsp;customs department on the ist of April 1909. The Board of&nbsp;Customs and Excise is constituted as is the Board of Inland&nbsp;Revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the United States the greater proportion of the national revenue ($547,086,992 out of $663,217,677 in 1909) is derived&nbsp;from customs and internal revenue. The internal revenue&nbsp;consists for the most part of receipts from taxes on spirits,&nbsp;tobaccos and fermented liquors. In 1909 the amount derived&nbsp;from customs revenue was $300,977,438, and internal revenue,&nbsp;$246,109,554.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REVERE, PAUL (1735-1818), American engraver and patriot, was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on the ist of January 1735.&nbsp;He had a meagre schooling, and in his father’s shop learned&nbsp;the trade of a gold- and silversmith. In 1756 he was second&nbsp;lieutenant of artillery in the expedition against Crown Point,&nbsp;and for several months was stationed at Fort Edward, in New&nbsp;York.*- He became a proficient copper engraver, and.engraved&nbsp;several anti-British caricatures in the years before the War of&nbsp;Independence. He was one of the Boston grand jurors who&nbsp;refused to serve in 1774 because parliament had made the&nbsp;justices independent of the people for their salaries; was a&nbsp;leader in the Boston Tea Party; was one of the thirty North&nbsp;End mechanics who patrolled the streets to watch the movements of the British troops and Tories; and in December 1774&nbsp;was sent to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to urge the seizure&nbsp;of military stores there, and induced the colonists to attack&nbsp;and capture Fort William and Mary—one of the first acts of&nbsp;military force in the war. His midnight ride from Charlestown&nbsp;to Lexington on the i8th-i9th of April 1775, to give warning&nbsp;of thc approach of British troops from Boston, is Revere’s most&nbsp;famous exploit; it is commemorated by Longfellow, who,&nbsp;however, has &quot; paid little attention to exactness of fact ”&nbsp;(Justin Winsor). In 1775 Revere was sent by the Massachusetts&nbsp;provincial congress to Philadelphia to study the working of the&nbsp;only powder mill in the colonies, and although he was allowed&nbsp;only to pass through the building, obtained sufficient information to enable him to set up a powder mill at Canton. He w as&nbsp;commissioned a major of infantry in the Massachusetts militia&nbsp;in April 1776; was promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel&nbsp;of artillery in November; was stationed at Castle William,&nbsp;defending Boston harbour, and finally received command of&nbsp;this fort. He served in an expedition to Rhode Island in 1778,&nbsp;and in the following year participated in the unsuccessful&nbsp;Penobscot expedition. After his return he was accused of&nbsp;having disobeyed the orders of the commanding officer, was&nbsp;tried by court-martial, and was acquitted. After the war he&nbsp;engaged in the manufacture of gold and silver ware, and became&nbsp;a pioneer in the production in America of copper plating and&nbsp;copper spikes for ships. In 1795, as grandmaster of the Masonic&nbsp;fraternity, he laid the cornerstone of the new State House in&nbsp;Boston, and in this year also founded the Massachusetts Charitable Mechanic Association, becoming its first president. He&nbsp;died in Boston on the 10th of May 1818.</span></p>
