Judging in this way, we muſt ſtill allow the ſtream a velocity of more than fix feet. Had the firſt ſwell at Cairo been noticed in 1770 or 1771, we might have gueſſed better. The year that Thevenot was in Egypt, the firſt ſwell of 8 peeks was obſerved Jan. 28. The caliſh was opened for 14 peeks on Auguſt 14th, and the waters began to decreaſe on September 23d, having riſen to 21⅔  peeks. We may ſuppoſe a ſimilar progreſs at Cairo correſponding to Mr Bruce’s obſervations at Gondar, and date every thing five days earlier.</p><p>We underſtand that ſome of our gentlemen ſtation-ed far up the Ganges have had the curiolity to take notes of the ſwellings of that river, and compare them with the overflowings at Calcutta, and that their obſervations are about to be made public, Such accounts are valuable additions to our practical knowledge, and we ſhall not neglect to inſert the information in ſome kindred article of this work.</p><p>The ſame mountains which attract the tropical vapours, and produce the fertilizing inundations of the Nile, perform the ſame office to the famous Niger, whoſe exiſtence has often been accounted fabulous, and with whoſe courſe we have very little acquaintance. The reſearches of the gentlemen of the African afl’ocia-tion render its exiſtence no longer doubtful, and have greatly excited the public curioſity. For a farther account of its track, ſee Niger.</p><p>From the great number, and the very moderate ſize, of the rivers which faſt into the Atlantic Ocean all the way ſouth of the Gambia, we conclude that the weſtern ſhore is the moſt elevated, and that the mountains are at no great diſtance inland. On the other hand, the rivers at Melinda and Soſala are of a magnitude which indicate a much longer courſe. But of all this we ſpeak with much uncertainty.</p><p>The frame-work (ſo to call it) of America is better known, and is ſingular.</p><p>A chain of mountains begins, or at leaſt is found, in longitude x ιo° weſt of London, and latitude 40<hi rend="sup">0</hi> north, on the northern confines of the kingdom of Mexico, and ſtretching ſouthward through that kingdom, forms the ridge of the neck of land which ſeparates North from South America, and keeping almoſt cloſe to the ſhore, ranges along the whole weſtern coaſt of South America, terminating at Cape Horn. In its courſe it fends off branches, which after ſeparating from it for a few leagues, rejoin it again, incloſing valleys of great extent from north to ſouth, and of prodigious elevation. In one of theſe, under the equatorial ſun, ſtands the city of Quito, in the midſt of extenſive fields of barléy, oats, wheat, and gardens, containing apples, pears, and gooſe-berries, and in ſhort all the grains and fruits of the cooler parts of Europe ; and although the vine is alſo there in perfection, the olive is wanting. Not a dozen miles from it in the low countries, the ſugar-cane, the indigo, and all the fruits of the torrid zone, find their congenial heat, and the inhabitants ſwelter under a burning ſun. At as ſmall a diſtance on the other hand tower aloft the pinacles of Pichincha, Corambourou, and Chemboracaô, crowned with never melting ſnows.</p><p>The individual mountains of this ſtupendous range aot only exceed in height all others in the world (if we except the Peak of Teneriffe, Mount Ætna, and Mount Blanc); but they are ſet down on a baſe incomparably more elevated than any other country. They cut off therefore all communication between the Pacific Ocean and the inland continent ; and no rivers are to be found on the weſt coaſt of South America which have any conſiderable length of courſe or body of waters. The country is drained, like Africa, in the oppoſite direction. Not 100 miles from the city of Lima, the capital of Peru, which lies almoſt on the ſea ſhore, and juſt at the foot of the high Cordilleras, ariſes out of a ſmall lake the Maragnon or Amazon’s river, which, after running northward for about 100 miles, takes an eaſterly direction, and croſſes nearly the broadeſt part of South America, and falls into the great weſtern ocean at Para, after a courſe of not leſs than 3500 miles. In the firſt half of its deſcent it receives a few middle-ſized rivers from the north, and from the ſouth it receives the great river Combos, ſpringing from another little lake not 50 miles diſtant from the head of the Maragnon, and incloſing between them a wide extent of country. Then it receives the Yuta, the Yuerva, the Cuchivara, and Parana Mire, each of which is equal to the Rhine ; and then the Madeira, which has flowed above 1300 miles. At their junction the breadth is ſo great, that neither ſhore can be ſeen by a perſon ftanding up in a canoe ; ſo that the united ſtream m iſt be about 6 miles broad'. In this majeſtic form it rolls along at a prodigious rate through a flat country, covered with impenetrable fo-reſts, and moſt of it as yet untrodden by human feet. Mr Condamine, who came down the ſtream, ſays, that all is filent as the deſert, and the wild beaſtsand numberleſs birds crowd round the boat, eyeing it as ſome animal of which they did not ſeem afraid. The bed was cut deep through an equal and yielding foil, which ſeemed rich in every part, if he could judge by the ve-getation, which was rank in the extreme. What an· addition this to the poſſible population of this globe Î A narrow flip along each bank of this mighty river would equal in ſurface the whole of Europe, and would probably exceed it in general fertility : and although the velocity in the main ſtream was great, he obſerved that it was extremely moderate, nay almoſt ſtill, at the ſides ſo that in thoſe parts where the country was-inhabited by men, the Indians paddled up the river with perfect eaſe. Boats could go from Para to near the mouth of the Madeira in 38 days, which is near 1200 miles-.</p><p>Mr Condamine made an obſervation during his paſſage' down the Maragnon, which is extremely curious and inſtructive, although it puzzled him very much. He obſerved that the tide was ſenſible· at a vaſt diſtance from- the mouth : It was very conſiderable at the junction of the Madeira ; and he ſuppoſes that it might have been obſerved much farther up. This appeared to him very ſurpriſing, becauſe there could be no doubt but that the ſurface of the water there was higher by a great many feet than the ſurface of the flood of the At-» lantic ocean at the mouth of the river. It was therefore very natural for him to aſcribe the tide in the Maragnon to the immediate action of the moon on its wa-ters ; and this explanation was the more reaſonable, becauſe the river extends in the direction of terreſtria} longitude, which by the Newtonian theory is moſt favourable to the production of a tide.
