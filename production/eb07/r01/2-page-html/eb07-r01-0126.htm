<p><span class="font0">of chilly weather, being more than any other class of creatures under the influence of temperature,—“ frigida æstu-antium animalia ;” and what is truly singular, is the fact mentioned by Humboldt, that the inverse cause produces a&nbsp;corresponding effect on some of the species of tropical climates, the caymans or crocodiles of South America becoming torpid, and entombing themselves in mud, during the&nbsp;prevalence of the hottest season.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Indeed, among the more singular features in the economy of the reptile race, may be numbered their power of enduring long-continued abstinence, and the lethargic state,&nbsp;infinitely more profound than the winter sleep of quadrupeds, into which they yearly fall. In connection with this&nbsp;subject, Mr Jacobson of Copenhagen has recognised in&nbsp;reptiles a special arrangement of certain vessels which constitute a peculiar </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">venous system.</span><span class="font0"> This system may be said&nbsp;to exist more or less in all the race ; but, rudimentary in&nbsp;the tortoises and crocodiles, it shows its chief development&nbsp;among the other Saurians, and the Ophidian and Batrachian&nbsp;groups. “ It is composed of the veins of the abdominal&nbsp;members, the pelvian or caudal veins, the hinder veins of&nbsp;the kidneys, the veins of the oviductus, a great portion of&nbsp;the veins of the skin, of those of the muscles of the abdomen, and of those of certain organs peculiar to the reptiles.&nbsp;These veins combine, and form one or many trunks, which&nbsp;proceed either into the vena porta or the liver, or into&nbsp;both. What especially distinguishes this system is, that in&nbsp;it a part of the veins of the organs of locomotion, and of&nbsp;the skin, proceed to distribute themselves into the liver.&nbsp;There is no other example of tllis among the vertebrated&nbsp;animals. Certain special organs appear connected with this&nbsp;venous system in a peculiar manner, and are regarded by&nbsp;Mr Jacobson as proper for secreting and preserving a nutritive juice, destined to be re-absorbed in the rigorous&nbsp;months of the severe season, during the hybernal slumber&nbsp;of these animals.”@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In regard to the geographical distribution of reptiles in general, we shall here briefly observe, that they augment&nbsp;in number as we advance towards the equatorial regions.&nbsp;While Sweden possesses scarcely a dozen snakes and lizards,&nbsp;about three or four frogs and toads, and not a single tortoise, the temperate parts of Europe produce about forty&nbsp;snakes and lizards, and several of the tortoise tribe. In&nbsp;Scandinavia, however, although the species are so few in&nbsp;number, the individuals are much more abundant than in&nbsp;Britain ; from which we infer, that it is rather the want of&nbsp;strong continuous summer heat than the actuality of our&nbsp;winter’s cold, that is unfavourable to the production of reptiles in our cloudy clime. As soon as we gain the southern&nbsp;extremity of Spain, the number of species in these tribes&nbsp;greatly increases, and in Andalusia the African complexion&nbsp;of the country is still further manifested by the frequent appearance of the chameleon. On proceeding further south,&nbsp;not onlydoes the number of reptiles increase, but they also&nbsp;augment in size, splendour, and ferocity, till from the Tropic of Cancer onwards and beyond the line, we meet with&nbsp;crocodiles, caymans, boas, and other giants of the reptile&nbsp;race. Several species, however, even in sultry latitudes,&nbsp;are subjected by their peculiar position to the influence of&nbsp;severe cold. Thus the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">axolotl</span><span class="font0"> of Mexico occurs in the&nbsp;chill waters of lakes elevated above 8000 feet from the surface of the sea ; and the salamander (a water newt) of Europe is frequently found frozen up in ice in early spring,&nbsp;without being destroyed. Indeed, Dufay has remarked, as&nbsp;a singular circumstance, that those very animals of which it.&nbsp;once was fabled they could withstand the fiery flames, are&nbsp;in reality endowed with the almost equally surprising power&nbsp;of resisting frost, so generally fatal to the life of reptiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although we have now endeavoured to state a few of what may be regarded as the generalities of the reptile class,&nbsp;yet it must be borne in mind, that no great division of the&nbsp;animal kingdom exhibits such a singular diversity of form&nbsp;and aspect, or is more liable to exceptions from whatever&nbsp;features we may incline to consider as general characteristics. “ Aussi les reptiles,” says Baron Cuvier, “ presentent-ils des formes, des mouvements, et des propriétés beaucoup plus variés que les deux classes précédentes (quadrupeds and birds) ; et c’est surtout dans leur production que&nbsp;la nature semble s’être jouée à imaginer des formes bizarres,&nbsp;et à modifier dans tous les sens possibles le plan général&nbsp;qu’elle a suivi pour les animaux vertébrés, et spécialement pour les classes ovipares.” Among no animals indeed do we meet with beings of more singular forms than&nbsp;in the class Reptilia, many of which exhibit an aspect so&nbsp;mmsual, so grotesque, and even so formidable, that it would&nbsp;be difficult for the imagination of the poet or the painter to&nbsp;exceed the “ dread realities” of nature. Although the majority are oviparous, some, as we have said, produce their&nbsp;young alive. Many have four legs, some only two, which&nbsp;vary from an anterior to a posterior pair, while the entire&nbsp;tribe of serpents have no legs at all. Some have their bodies more or less closely beset by scales, varying in size&nbsp;from extreme tenuity to the strength and thickness of&nbsp;mailed armour ; many, as the numerous tribes of frogs, are&nbsp;defended only by a soft and mucous skin ; as many more&nbsp;are shut up in a strong bony box-like covering, within which&nbsp;they dwell, as in an impregnable castle. The greater number possess a tail, but several entirely want that organ.&nbsp;Numerous tribes live unceasingly in the water, others pass&nbsp;their infancy in moist abodes, their maturer years on terra&nbsp;firma, provided in the former case with gills, in the latter&nbsp;with lungs for respiration. Marshes and muddy swamps,&nbsp;the dry and desert sands, the umbrageous woods, the upland mountains, the “ resounding shores,” are all alike pervaded by one or many of the numerous forms of reptile&nbsp;life. The subterranean proteus fears the light, though dealing in no deeds of darkness ; the agile lizard, “ all scaled&nbsp;silver bright,” basks delighted beneath the beams of the most&nbsp;brilliant sun, “ no cloud in heaven.” Some are fierce and <sub></sub>carnivorous, others gentle and herbivorous. The most deadly poison is distilled by many, while entire tribes are quite&nbsp;innocuous ; and while some are resplendent in burnished&nbsp;gold and azure, “ like mailed angels on a battle-day,” as&nbsp;many exhibit the last stage of ugliness in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">worse</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gorgons, and hydras, and chimeras dire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It has been observed, that in the popular superstitions of various countries, the reptile race have been almost always&nbsp;clothed in revolting attributes, and that the worship accorded them was one not of gratitude, but fear. @@<sup>2</sup> Victor or&nbsp;vanquished, they seem ever to have borne a cruel and pestilential character, in opposition to the welfare of the human race ; and the prowess both of gods and men was called into frequent and vigorous exercise for their subduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Glorious Apollo” pursued the enormous Python with his unerring shafts ; the dreadfid Acheloiis w∙as strangled&nbsp;by the son of Jove, in spite of folds “ voluminous and&nbsp;vast ;” the Hesperian gardens and the golden fleece were&nbsp;protected by fierce dragons ; Perseus, from the dripping&nbsp;head of Medusa, sowed with serpents the arid Libyan sands;&nbsp;and gorgons and furies, discord and envy, are armed by&nbsp;the poets with snakes, “ as appropriate emblems of their&nbsp;ministry of vengeance.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was chiefly on the comparative consideration of the amount of respiration, and of the organs of movement, that</span></p><div>
