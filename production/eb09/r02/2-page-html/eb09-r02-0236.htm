<p><span class="font1">of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">usucapio pro herede,</span><span class="font1"> which Gaius condemns as an incomprehensible and infamous institution, and which undoubtedly lost some of its </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raison d'etre</span><span class="font1"> once the right of&nbsp;succession of agnates had been introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Contract and its Breach.—</span><span class="font1">To speak of a law of obligations in connexion with the regal period, in the sense in which the words were understood in the later jurisprudence, would be a misapplication of language. It would&nbsp;be going too far to say, however, as is sometimes done,&nbsp;that before the time of Servius Rome had no law of contract ; for men must have bought and sold, or at least&nbsp;bartered, from earliest times,—must have rented houses,&nbsp;hired labour, made loans, carried goods, and been parties&nbsp;to a variety of other transactions inevitable amongst a&nbsp;people engaged to any extent in pastoral, agricultural, or&nbsp;trading pursuits. It is true that a patrician family with&nbsp;a good establishment of clients and slaves had within itself&nbsp;ample machinery for supplying its ordinary wants, and&nbsp;was thus to a great extent independent of outside aid.&nbsp;But there were not many such families ; and the plebeian&nbsp;farmers and the artisans of the guilds were in no such fortunate position. There must therefore have been contracts&nbsp;and a law of contract ; but the latter was very imperfect.&nbsp;In barter—for at that time money was not yet in use—with&nbsp;instant exchange and delivery of one commodity against&nbsp;another, the transaction was complete at once without the&nbsp;creation of any obligation. But in other cases, such as&nbsp;those alluded to, one of the parties at least must have&nbsp;trusted to the good faith of the other. What was his&nbsp;guarantee, and what remedy had he for breach of engagement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His reliance in the first place was on the probity of the party with whom he was dealing,—on the latter’s reverence&nbsp;for Fides, and the dread he had of the disapprobation of&nbsp;his fellows should he prove false, and of the penalties,&nbsp;social, religious, or pecuniary, that might consequently be&nbsp;imposed on him by his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> in the case of a patrician, by&nbsp;his guild in the case of a craftsman, or by the king in the&nbsp;case of any other plebeian.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> If the party who had to rely&nbsp;on the other’s good faith was not satisfied with his promise&nbsp;and the grasp of the right hand that was its seal,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> he might&nbsp;require his solemn oath (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jusjurandum)</span><span class="font1"> ; and it can hardly&nbsp;be doubted that, whatever may have been the case at a&nbsp;later period, in the time of the earlier kings he who forswore himself was amenable to pontifical discipline. If&nbsp;he preferred a more substantial guarantee, he took something in pledge or pawn from the other contractor ; and,&nbsp;though he had no legal title to it, and so could not recover&nbsp;it by judicial process if he lost possession, yet so long as&nbsp;he retained it he had in his own hand a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> compulsitor to performance. Upon performance he could be&nbsp;forced to return it or suffer a penalty,—not by reason of&nbsp;obligation resulting from a contract of pledge, for the law&nbsp;as yet recognized none, but because, in retaining it after&nbsp;the purpose was served for which he had received it, he&nbsp;was committing theft and liable to its punishment. At&nbsp;this stage breach of contract, as such, does not seem to&nbsp;have legitimated any action for damages or reparation</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">before the civil tribunals ; but it is not improbable that, where actual loss had been sustained, the injured party&nbsp;was permitted to resort immediately to self-redress by&nbsp;seizure of the wrongdoer or his goods. Such self-help was&nbsp;according to the spirit of the time,—not self-defence merely&nbsp;in presence of imminent danger, but active measures for&nbsp;redress of wrongs already completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Public and Private Offences and their Punishment.—</span><span class="font1">For anything like a clear line of demarcation between crimes,&nbsp;offences, and civil injuries we look in vain in regal Rome.&nbsp;Offences against the state itself, such as trafficking with&nbsp;an enemy for its overthroλv </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{proditio)</span><span class="font1"> or treasonable practices at home </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fiperduellio),</span><span class="font1"> were of course matter of state&nbsp;concern, prosecution, and punishment from the first. But&nbsp;in the case of those that primarily affected an individual&nbsp;or his estate there was a halting between, and to some&nbsp;extent a confusion of, the three systems of private vengeance, sacral atonement, and public or private penalty.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3&nbsp;</sup>It has been attempted to explain the coexistence of these&nbsp;systems by reference to the different temperaments of the&nbsp;races that constituted united Rome ; and this certainly&nbsp;is a consideration that cannot be left out of view. But&nbsp;the same sequence is observable in the history of the&nbsp;laws of other nations whose original elements were not so&nbsp;mixed, the later system gradually gaining ground upon&nbsp;the earlier and eventually overwhelming it. The remarkable thing in Rome is that private vengeance should so&nbsp;long not only have left its traces but really continued to&nbsp;be an active power. It must still have been an admitted&nbsp;right of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> or kinsmen of a murdered man in the&nbsp;days of Numa; otherwise we should not have had that&nbsp;law of his providing that, where a homicide was due to&nbsp;misadventure, the offering to them of a ram should stay&nbsp;their hands. To avenge the death of a kinsman was&nbsp;more than a right : it was a religious duty, for his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">had to be appeased ; and so strongly was this idea entertained that, even long after the state had interfered and&nbsp;made murder a matter of public prosecution, a kinsman&nbsp;was so imperatively bound to set it in motion that if he&nbsp;failed he was not permitted to take anything of the inheritance of the deceased. Private vengeance was lawful too&nbsp;at the instance of a husband or father who surprised his&nbsp;wife or daughter in an act of adultery ; he might kill her&nbsp;and her paramour on the spot, though, if he allowed his&nbsp;wrath to cool, he could afterwards deal with her only&nbsp;judicially in his domestic tribunal. The talion we read&nbsp;of in the XII. Tables is also redolent of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vindicta&nbsp;privata,</span><span class="font1"> although practically it had become no more than&nbsp;a compulsitor to reparation. And even the nexal creditor’s&nbsp;imprisonment of his defaulting debtor </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(infra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 694), which&nbsp;was not abolished until the fifth century of the city, may&nbsp;not unfittingly, in view of the cruelties that too often&nbsp;attended it, be said to have savoured more of private vengeance than either punishment or procedure in reparation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Exρiatio, supplicium, sacrαtio capitis,</span><span class="font0"> all suggest offences against the gods rather than against either an individual or the state. But&nbsp;it is difficult to draw the line between different classes of offences,&nbsp;and predicate of one that it was a sin, of another that it was a&nbsp;crime, and of a third that it was hut civil injury done to an individual.@@<sup>4</sup> They ran into each other in a way that is somewhat</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
