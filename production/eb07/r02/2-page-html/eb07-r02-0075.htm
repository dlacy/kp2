<p><span class="font0">His chariot, and whose company was courted for his wit and talent, was, after all, by profession, the same with the unfortunate stroller, whom tile British laws condemn as a vagabond, and to whose dead body other countries refuse even&nbsp;the last rites of Christianity. In the same manner it is&nbsp;easy to suppose that, when in compliance with the taste of&nbsp;their age, monarchs entertained their domestic minstrels,@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>those persons might be admitted to the most flattering intimacy with their royal masters ; sleep within the royal&nbsp;chamber,@@<sup>2</sup> amass considerable fortunes, found hospitals,@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>and receive rewards singularly over-proportioned to the&nbsp;perquisites of the graver professions ;@@<sup>4</sup> and even practise in&nbsp;company with their royal masters the pleasing arts of poetry&nbsp;and music, which all are so desirous of attaining ;@@<sup>5</sup> whilst,&nbsp;at the same time, those who ranked lower in the same profession were struggling with difficulty to gain a precarious&nbsp;subsistence, and incurring all the disgrace usually attached&nbsp;to a vagabond life and a dubious character. In the fine&nbsp;arts, particularly, excellence is demanded, and mere mediocrity is held contemptible; and, while the favour with&nbsp;which the former is loaded, sometimes seems disproportion-ed to the utility of the art itself, nothing can exceed the&nbsp;scorn poured out on those who expose themselves by undertaking arts which they are unable to practise with success. Self-conceit, however, love of an idle life, and a variety of combined motives, never fail to recruit the lower&nbsp;orders of such idle professions with individuals by whose&nbsp;performances, and often by their private characters, the&nbsp;art which they have rashly adopted can only be discredited&nbsp;without any corresponding advantage to themselves. It&nbsp;is not, therefore, surprising that, while such distinguished&nbsp;examples of the contrary appeared amongst individuals, the&nbsp;whole body of minstrels, with the romances which they&nbsp;composed and sung, should be reprobated by graver historians in such severe terms as often occur in the monkish&nbsp;chronicles of the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Respecting the style of their composition, Du Cange informs us, that the minstrels sometimes devoted their strains to flatter the great, and sing the praises of those princes&nbsp;by whom they were protected ; while he owns, at the same&nbsp;time, that they often recommended to their hearers the&nbsp;path of virtue and nobleness, and pointed out the pursuits&nbsp;by which the heroes of romance had rendered themselves&nbsp;renowned in song.@@<sup>6</sup> Hc quotes from the romance of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bertrand Guesclin,</span><span class="font0"> the injunction on those who would rise to&nbsp;fame in arms to copy the valiant acts of the Paladins of&nbsp;Charles, and the Knights of the Round Table, narrated in&nbsp;romances ; and it cannot be denied, that those high tales,&nbsp;in which the virtues of generosity, bravery, devotion to his&nbsp;mistress, and zeal for the Catholic religion, were carried to&nbsp;the greatest height of romantic perfection in the character&nbsp;of the hero, united with the scenes passing around them,&nbsp;were of the highest importance in affecting the character of&nbsp;the age. The fabulous knights of romance were so completely identified with those of real history, that graver historians quote the actions of the former in illustration of,&nbsp;and as a corollary to the real events which they narrate.@@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>The virtues recommended in romance were, however, only&nbsp;of that overstrained and extravagant cast which consisted&nbsp;with the spirit of chivalry. Great bodily strength, and perfection in all martial exercises, was the universal accomplishment inalienable from the character of the hero, and&nbsp;which each romancer had it in his power to confer. It was&nbsp;also easily in the composer's power to devise dangers, and&nbsp;to free his hero from them by the exertion of valour equally extravagant. But it was more difficult to ftame a story&nbsp;which should illustrate tile manners as well as the feats of&nbsp;chivalry ; or to devise the means of evincing that devotion&nbsp;to duty, and that disinterested desire to sacrifice all to faith&nbsp;and honour ;—that noble spirit of achievement which laboured for others more than itself—which form, perhaps,&nbsp;the fairest side of the system under which the noble youths&nbsp;of the middle ages were trained up. The sentiments of&nbsp;chivalry, as we have explained in our article on that subject, were founded on the most pure and honourable principles, but unfortunately carried into hyperbole and extravagance ; until the religion of its professors approached to fanaticism, their valour to frensy, their ideas of honour to absurdity, their spirit of enterprise to extravagance, and their respect for the female sex to a sort of idolatry. All those extravagant feelings, which really existed in the society of the&nbsp;middle ages, were magnified and exaggerated by the writers&nbsp;and reciters of romance ; and these given as resemblances of&nbsp;actual manners, became, in their turn, the glass by which&nbsp;the youth of the age dressed themselves ; while the spirit of&nbsp;chivalry and of romance thus gradually threw light upon&nbsp;and enhanced each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The romances, therefore, exhibited the same system of manners which existed in the nobles of the age. The character of a true son of chivalry was raised to such a pitch</span></p><div>
