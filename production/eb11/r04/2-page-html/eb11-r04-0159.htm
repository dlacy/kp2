<p><span class="font0">-city. But his main strength was derived from the vast possessions of the Vico family, in which the office of prefect now became hereditary. Very soon, however, these&nbsp;prefects of Vico were chiefly regarded as the great&nbsp;feudal lords of Tuscia, and the independent municipal&nbsp;office lost its true character. Then the popes made a&nbsp;point of according great pomp and dignity to this nominal&nbsp;prefect, in order to overshadow the senator, who still represented the indépendence of the republic and had assumed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">many of the attributes wrested from the prefect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But Innocent III., dissatisfied with this state of things, contrived by bribing the people to arrogate to himself the&nbsp;right of electing the senator, who had now to swear&nbsp;fealty and submission to the pope, and also that of&nbsp;nominating the provincial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">justitiarii,</span><span class="font0"> formerly chosen&nbsp;by the government of the Capitol. This was a&nbsp;deadly blow to the republic, for the principal rights of the&nbsp;people—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the election of pope and emperor, prefect and&nbsp;senate—were now lost. The general discontent provoked fresh&nbsp;revolutions, and Innocent III. employed all his political dexterity&nbsp;to ward off their effects. But shortly afterwards the people&nbsp;made a loud outcry for a senate of fifty-six members; and&nbsp;the pope, again making a virtue of necessity, caused that number&nbsp;to be chosen by twelve </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tnediani</span><span class="font0"> specially named by him for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">purpose. Even this did not calm the popular discontent,<sup>1 </sup>which was also stirred by other disputes. The consequence&nbsp;was that when, six months later, the pope again elected a&nbsp;single senator the Romans rose to arms, and in 1204 formed&nbsp;a government of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Buoni Uomini</span><span class="font0"> in opposition to that created&nbsp;by the pope. But an amicable arrangement being concluded, the pope once more nominated fifty-six senators;&nbsp;and when, soon after, he again reduced them to one, the&nbsp;people were too weary to resist (1205). Thus the Capitol&nbsp;was subdued, and Innocent III. spent his last years in&nbsp;tranquillity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 22nd of November 1220 Honorius III. (1216-27) conferred the imperial crown on Frederick II., who confirmed&nbsp;to the church the possession of her former states, of those&nbsp;bequeathed to her by Countess Matilda, and even of the March&nbsp;of Ancona. But it was soon seen that he sought to dominate&nbsp;all Italy, and was therefore a foe to be dreaded. The successor of Honorius, Pope Gregory IX. (1227-41), was&nbsp;speedily insulted and put to flight by the Ghibelline&nbsp;nobles, whose courage had revived, and the republic&nbsp;began to subdue the Latían cities on its own account.&nbsp;Peace was several times made and unmade by pope&nbsp;and people; but no enduring harmony was possible between&nbsp;them, since the former wished to subject the entire state to&nbsp;the church, and the latter to escape from the rule of the church&nbsp;and hold sway over “ the universal land from Ceprano to&nbsp;Radicofani ” formerly belonging to the duchy. Accordingly,&nbsp;the Roman people now appointed judges, imposed taxes, issued&nbsp;coin, and made the clergy amenable to secular tribunals. In&nbsp;1234 the senator Luca Savelli published an edict declaring&nbsp;Tuscia and Campania territories of the republic, and sent judges&nbsp;thither to exact an oath of obedience. He also despatched&nbsp;the militia to the coast, where it occupied several cities and&nbsp;erected fortresses; and columns were raised everywhere inscribed with the initials S. P. Q. R. The pope, unable to&nbsp;prevent but equally unable to tolerate these acts, fled from&nbsp;Rome, hurling his anathema against Savelli, “ et omnes illos&nbsp;consiliarios urbis quorum consilio,” &amp;c. The Romans sacked&nbsp;the Lateran and the houses of many cardinals, and marched&nbsp;on Viterbo, but were driven back by the papal troops.&nbsp;When Savelli left office and Angelo Malabranca was&nbsp;elected in his stead, the people made peace and submission in 1235, and were obliged to give up their&nbsp;pretensions of subjecting the clergy to ordinary tribunals and the urban territory to the republic. Thus matters&nbsp;were virtually settled on the footing established by Innocent&nbsp;III., thanks to the aid given to the pope by Frederick II., who</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">had been one of the promoters of the rebellion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may appear strange that, at this period of their history, the Romans, after showing such tenacious adherence to the&nbsp;republic and senate, should have accepted the rule of a single&nbsp;senator without rushing to arms, and passed and repassed&nbsp;from one form of government to another with such surprising&nbsp;indifference. But on closer examination it is plain that these&nbsp;changes were greater in appearance than reality. We have&nbsp;already seen, in treating of Carosomo, how the single senator&nbsp;convoked the people in parliament to pass sanction&nbsp;on the laws. But, whenever there is only one senator,&nbsp;we also continually meet with the expression “ consilium vel consilia urbis.” It is evident that when,&nbsp;instead of laws to be approved in parliament by a&nbsp;simple placet or rejected by a non-placet, matters requiring&nbsp;consideration had to be discussed, the senator convoked a much&nbsp;smaller council, consisting only of the leaders of the people.&nbsp;These leaders were the heads of the twelve or thirteen regions&nbsp;of the guilds, now becoming organized and soon to be also&nbsp;thirteen in number, and of the militia. As in the other&nbsp;Italian republics, all these associations had been formed in&nbsp;Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The senator therefore held consultation with the leading men of the city; and, although, especially at first, these meetings were rather loosely organized, it is clear that they took&nbsp;the form of two councils—one numerous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(consiglio maggiore),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the other limited </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(consiglio tninore</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">speciale),</span><span class="font0"> co-operating&nbsp;with and forming part of the first. Such was the prevailing&nbsp;custom throughout Italy at the time when Roman institutions&nbsp;most nearly resembled those of the other republics. We&nbsp;already know that, from the date of Arnold’s reforms, the senate,&nbsp;with its junta of counsellors, had been divided into two parts,&nbsp;forming when united a species of greater council. Therefore&nbsp;the transition from a senate divided into two parts to the&nbsp;greater and lesser councils must have been very easy and&nbsp;natural. And, seeing that later, when the nomination of a&nbsp;single senator had become a constant practice, the meetings&nbsp;of the two councils are frequently mentioned without the&nbsp;slightest remark or hint as to their origin, it is clear that they&nbsp;had been gradually formed and long established. Not long&nbsp;after the revolution of 1143 the grandees sought to re-enter&nbsp;the senate; and the popes themselves, partly from dread of&nbsp;the people and partly to aggrandize their own kindred, contributed to build up the power of a new and no less turbulent&nbsp;nobility. This class, arising between the 12th and 13th centuries,&nbsp;was composed of families newly created by the popes, together&nbsp;with remnants of the old aristocracy, such as the Frangipani,&nbsp;Colonna, &amp;c. These nobles, regaining possession of the senate,&nbsp;so completely eliminated the popular element that, when the&nbsp;popes again opposed them, and, obtaining from the parliament the right of electing the senators, adopted the expedient&nbsp;of appointing one only, the senator was always chosen from&nbsp;the ranks of the nobles. And then the people, unable and&nbsp;unwilling to renounce republican forms, replaced their suppressed senate by a greater and a lesser council. This was an&nbsp;easy task—a natural consequence of the fact that the people&nbsp;now began to constitute the real strength of the republic.&nbsp;Later, with an increasing detestation for their nobility, the&nbsp;Romans decreed that the single senator should be of foreign&nbsp;birth, and, as we shall see, chose Brancaleone in the middle of&nbsp;the 13th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus, after a long series of frequent changes and revolutions, the Roman republic became a commonwealth, with an increasing resemblance to those of the other Italian cities. The&nbsp;people were organized and armed, the gilds almost established,&nbsp;the two councils gradually constituted, and the aristocracy,&nbsp;while retaining special local characteristics, assumed its&nbsp;definitive shape. It is not surprising to find that&nbsp;Rome, like other Italian cities, now possessed statutes&nbsp;of its own. There has been much controversy on&nbsp;this point. Certain writers had alluded to a statute of 1246.&nbsp;As no one, however, could discover any statute of that date,&nbsp;others decided that it had never existed. A statute of 1363</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
