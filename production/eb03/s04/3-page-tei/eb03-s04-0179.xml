The inquiſition exhauſted its rage againſt theſe unhappy people, many of whom pretended to embrace Chriſtianity, in order to preſerve their property. About the ſame time their Catholic majesties concluded art alliance with the emperor Maximilian, and a treaty of marriage for their daughter Joan with his ſon Philip, archduke of Auſtria and ſovereign of the Netherlands. About this time alſo the contract was concluded with Chriſtopher Columbus for the diſcovery of new countries ; and the counties oſ Rouſſillon and Cerdagne were agreed to be reſtored by Charles VIII. of France, before his expedition into Italy. The diſcovery of America was ſoon followed by extenſive conqueſts in that quarter, as is related under the articled <hi rend="smallcaps">Mexico, Peru, Chili, &amp;c. </hi>which tended to raiſe the Spaniſh monarchy above any other in Europe.</p><p>On the death of Iſabella, which happened in  1506, Philip archduke of Auſtria came to Castile in order to take poſſession of that kingdom as heir to his mother- in law ; but he dying in a ſhort time after, his ſon Charles V. afterwards emperor oſ Germany, became heir to the crown of Spain. His father at his death left the king of France governor to the young prince, and Ferdinand at his death left cardinal Ximenes ſole regent of Gaſtile, till the arrival of his grandson. This man, whoſe character is no leſs ſingular than illuſtrious, who united the abilities of a great ſtateſman with the abject devotion of a ſuperſtitious monk, and the magnificence of a prime miniſter with the ſeverity of a mendicant, maintained order and tranquillity in Spain, notwithſtanding the diſcontents of a turbulent and high- ſpirited nobility. When they diſputed his right to the regency, he coolly ſhowed them the teſtament of Ferdinand, and the ratification of that deed by Charles ; but theſe not ſatisfying them, and argument proving ineffectual, he led them inſenſibly towards a balcony, whence they had a view oſ a large body of troops under arms, and a formidable train of artillery,  "Behold (ſaid the cardinal) the powers which I have received from his Catholic majesty : by theſe I govern Castile; and will govern it, till the king, your maſter and mine, ſhall come to take poſſeſſion of his kingdom.” A declaration ſo bold and determined ſilenced all oppoſition; and Ximenes maintained his authority till the arrival of Charles in 517.</p><p>The young king was received with univerſal acclamations of joy ; but Ximenes found little cauſe to rejoice. He was ſeized with a violent diſorder, ſuppoſed to be the effect of poiſon ; and when he recovered, Charles, prejudiced againſt him by the Spaniſh grandees and his Flemiſh courtiers, slighted his advice, and allowed him every day to sink into neglect. The cardinal did not bear this treatment with his uſual fortitude of ſpirit. He expected a more grateful return from a prince to whom he delivered a kingdom more flouriſhing than it had been in any former age, and authority more extensive and better eſtabliſhed than the moſt illuſtrious of his</p><p>anceſtors had ever poſſeſſed. Conſcious of his own integrity and merit, he could not therefore refrain from giving vent, at times, to indignation and complaint. He lamented the fate of his country, and foretold the calamities to which it would be expoſed from the inſolence, the rapaciouſneſs, and the ignorance of ſtrangers. But in the mean time he received a letter from the king, diſmissing him from his councils, under pretence of eaſing his age of that burden which he had ſo long and ſo ably ſuſtained. This letter proved fatal to the miniſter ; for he expired in a few hours after reading it.</p><p>While Charles was taking poſſeſſion of the throne of Spain, in conſequence of the death of one grandfather, another was endeavouring to obtain for him the imperial crown. With this view Maximilian aſſembled a diet at Augſhurg, where he cultivated the favour of the electors by many acts of beneficence, in order to engage them to chooſe that young prince as his ſucceſſor. But Maximilian himſelf never having been crowned by the pope, a ceremony deemed eſſential in that age, as well as in the preceding, he was conſidered only as king of the Romans, or emperor elect ; and no example occurring in hiſtory of any perſon being choſen ſucceſſor to a king of the Romans, the Germans, always tenacious of their forms, obſtinately refused to confer upon Charles a dignity for which their conſtitution knew no name.</p><p>But though Maximilian could not prevail upon the German electors to chooſe his grandſon of Spain king of the Romans, he had diſpoſed their minds in favour of that prince ; and other circumſtances, on the death of the emperor, conſpired to the exaltation of Charles. The imperial crown had ſo long continued in the Auſtrian line, that it began to be conſidered as hereditary in that ſamily ; and Germany, torn by religious diſputes, ſtood in need of a powerful emperor, not only to preſerve its own internal tranquillity, but alſo to protect it againſt the victorious arms of the Turks, who under Selim I. threatened the liberties of Europe. This fierce and rapid conqueror had already ſubdued the Mamalukes, and made himſelf maſter of Egypt and Syria. The power of Charles appeared neceſſary to oppoſe that of Selim. The extenſive dominions of the houſe of Auſtria, which gave him an intereſt in the preſervation of Germany ; the rich ſovereignty of the Netherlands and Franche Compte ; the entire poſſeſſion of the great and warlike kingdom of Spain, together with that of Naples and Sicily, all united to hold him up to the firſt dignity among Chriſtian princes ; and the new world ſeemed only to be called into exiſtence that its treaſures might enable him to defend Chriſtendom againſt the infidels. Such was the language of his partisans.</p><p>Francis I. however, no ſooner received intelligence of the death of Maximilian, than he declared himſelf a candidate for the empire ; and with no leſs confidence of ſucceſs than Charles. He truſted to his ſuperior years and experience ; his great reputation in arms ; and it was farther urged in his favour, that the impetuoſity oſ the French cavalry, added to the firmness of the German infantry, would prove irreſiſtible, and not only be ſufficient, under a warlike emperor, to ſet limits to the ambition of Selim, but to break entirely the Ottoman power, and prevent it from ever becoming dangerous again to Germany.</p><p>Both claims were plauſible.
