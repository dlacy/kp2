The population amounted, in 1836, to 466,888 persons. They are industrious, averse to changes,</p><p>and seldom leave the places of their birth, or alter the fashion of their dress. The surface is generally level, but on the north-eastern side there is a range of hills of very moderate height. The soil varies excessively, the department comprehending some of the best as well as some of the worst land in France. The north-west part consists of good cornland, and the north-east of valuable meadows ; but the south and south-west divisions are for the most part mere sandy heaths, yielding little or no corn, but in certain districts producing good wine. The chief river is that which gives its name to the department. It is navigable in the lower part, and before it joins the Loire receives the waters of thirty-six rivers and brooks. The products are the common domestic animals, with buck-wheat, maize, wheat, barley, hemp, flax, wine, honey, and various fruits. Nearly one tenth of the surface is covered with woods, which are commonly used as fuel. There are some mines of iron, and although none of them are very extensive, yet their great number enables the department to extract a sufficient quantity of that metal for its own consumption. The manufacturing industry is not considerable, being confined to hardware, paper, woollen cloths, leather, and the spinning of linen yarn. The capital is Le Mans, in the centre of the department, with a population, in the year 1836, of 23,164. It contains scarcely any other large towns.</p><p>SARTINE <hi rend="smallcaps">Islands,</hi> a cluster of small islands in the</p><p>Northern Pacific Ocean, so named by Pérouse. Long. 129. 18. W. Lat. 50. 56. N.</p><p>SARUM, <hi rend="smallcaps">Old,</hi> a place in the county of Wilts, only remarkable from the proprietor of it having retained the ancient right of returning two members to the House of Commons till 1832. Some of the most distinguished statesmen have sat for this place, among the rest Lord Chatham. There is at present but one house in it, though the remains of ancient walls and the foundation of a cathedral may still be traced.</p><p>SARUN, an extensive and valuable district in the province of Bahar, situated about the twenty-sixth degree of north latitude. Its boundaries on the north are Gorakpoor and Bettiah, on the south it has the Ganges, on the east Bettiah and Hajypoor, and on the west the Dewah or the Goggrah River. It contained, according to Major Rennell’s mensuration, in 1784, 5106 square miles. For its size it is one of the most prosperous districts in the Company’s dominions, being well watered by the Ganges and the Gunduck, besides numerous smaller streams. Its soil furnishes abundantly all the richest productions of the East. It is also an excellent pastoral country, producing fine cattle and horses. The saltpetre exported to Europe, and used in Bengal, is principally manufactured in this district and in that of Hajypoor. In 1801, the population of this district was, in reply to various questions circulated by the board of revenue, stated at 1,204,000, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to four Hindus. The chief town is Chuprach.</p><p>SARZEAU, a city of France, in the department of Morbihan, and the arrondissement of Vannes. It depends chiefly on the fishery, and contains, including the parish, 6126 inhabitants.</p><p>SASERAM, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Bahar, and district of Rhotas. This w as the favourite residence of Shere Khan, the Afghan, who, after having defeated the Moguls, and expelled the Emperor Humayoon, the father of Akbar, from Hindustan, mounted the throne and reigned five years. He was killed at the siege of Callinger in 1545, and lies buried here in a magnificent mausoleum, built in the middle of a great reservoir of water. The monument rises from the centre of the tank. Long. 84. 5. E. Lat. 25. N.</p><p>SASHES, in military dress, are badges of distinction, worn by the officers of most nations, either round their waist</p><p>or over their shoulders. Those for the British army are made of crimson silk ; for the imperial army, of crimson and gold ; for the Prussian army, of black silk and silver ; for the Hanoverians, of yellow silk ; and for the Portuguese, of crimson silk with blue tassels.</p><p>SASNEE, a town and fort of Hindustan, in the province of Agra, from which the zemindar was expelled, after a desperate resistance, by the British in 1803. It is thirty- eight miles north-north-east from the city of Agra. Long. 78. 4. E. Lat. 27. 45. N.</p><p>SASRAM, a small island in the Gulf of Siam, near the coast of Cambodia. Long. 103. 48. E. Lat. 10. N.</p><p>SASSARI, a city of the island of Sardinia. It stands on the plain of Fulmenaria, in the northern part, about nine miles from Porto Torres. The situation is pleasing and healthy, and the vicinity produces abundance of wine, oil, corn, fruit, and tobac∞, and is distinguished by the excellence of its cultivation. The city is well built, and, besides the cathedral, boasts of twenty-four churches, ten convents, three nunneries, and a Tridentine seminary. A university also has been formed out of a Jesuits’ college. The cathedral is a large structure, with a most elaborate façade, and an interior clean and airy. It contains 19,360 inhabitants, whose chief sources of existence arise from the agriculture around them.</p><p>SATALIA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Antalia,</hi> or, according to others, <hi rend="smallcaps">Adalia, </hi>a city of Asia Minor, in Caramania, beautifully situated at the head of a gulf to which it gives name. The site is a rising ground, on which the streets are placed above each other, and form a succession of terraces. On the level summit of the hill the city is enclosed by a ditch, a double w all, and a series of square towers, which are about fifty yards asunder. In an opening between two of the towers, now closed up, appear the remains of a splendid gateway, exhibiting fourteen columns, the upper part being of the Corinthian order. The port is enclosed by two stone piers, which once had towers at the extremities ; but it is now in a ruinous condition. The surrounding country is fertile and productive, and the gardens round the town, filled with trees loaded with fruit, are beautiful. The climate is delightful, and the air is refreshed by alternate breezes from the sea and from the chain of the Taurus Mountains. The town is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient Olbia. The population, two thirds Mahommedan and one third Greek, is 8000. Long. 30. 45. E. Lat. 36. 50. N.</p><p>SATANAGUR, a town of Hindustan, in the nizam’s territories, and the province of Hyderabad. It is fifty-five miles north by east from the city of Hyderabad. Long. 78. 16. E. Lat. 17. 56. N.</p><p>SATARAH, a well-known town and fortress of Hindustan, in the province of Bejapoor, and the Mahratta territories. Its foundation is on a rock, which stands on the westernmost point of a hill, rising from a base of from seven to eight miles in length from east to west. The passage to it is very narrow, only admitting one person at a time. It was taken by Sevajee, the founder of the Mahratta power, in 1673, and by Aurungzebe in 1690; but was retaken soon after the death of that monarch, in 1707. It capitulated to the British after a very short resistance in 1818 ; and being afterwards surveyed by British officers, they declared that it might be defended by two hundred troops against any force. This place owes its celebrity chiefly to its having been the state-prison of the legitimate sovereign of the Mahrattas, who was confined here by his chief minister the peishwa, who usurped the real power, while the deposed rajah was still honoured with the empty forms of royalty, and his name inserted in all public records. The representative of the Satarah rajah, though divested of all real power, was still recognised as the pageant of royalty ; and the country adjacent to Satarah, in consequence of his residence, enjoyed an exemption from all military license.</p></body></text></TEI>
