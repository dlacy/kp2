<p><span class="font0">overthrown, and a democracy was established. One of the immediate consequences was a mass of litigation on&nbsp;claims to property, urged by democratic exiles who had&nbsp;been dispossessed by Thrasybulus, Hiero, or Gelo. If,&nbsp;twenty years after the Cromwellian settlement of Ireland,&nbsp;an opportunity had been afforded to aggrieved persons for&nbsp;contesting every possession taken under that settlement in&nbsp;the ten counties, such persons being required to plead by&nbsp;their own mouths, the demand for an “ art ” of forensic&nbsp;rhetoric in Ireland would have been similar to that which&nbsp;existed in Sicily at the moment when Corax appeared.&nbsp;If we would understand the history of Greek rhetoric&nbsp;before Aristotle, we must always remember these circumstances of its origin. The new “ art ” was primarily&nbsp;intended to help the plain citizen who had to speak before&nbsp;a court of law. “Ten years ago,” a Syracusan might&nbsp;urge, “ Hieron banished me from Syracuse because I was&nbsp;suspected of popular sympathies, and gave my house on&nbsp;the Epipolæ to his favourite Agathocles, who still enjoys&nbsp;it. I now ask the people to restore it.” Claims of this&nbsp;type would be frequent. Such a claim, going many years&nbsp;back, would often require that a complicated series of&nbsp;details should be stated and arranged. It would also, in&nbsp;many instances, lack documentary support, and rely&nbsp;chiefly on inferential reasoning. The facts known as to&nbsp;the “ art ” of Corax perfectly agree with these conditions.&nbsp;He gave rules for arrangement, dividing the speech into&nbsp;five parts,—proem, narrative, arguments (αγώνες), subsidiary remarks (παρεκβασις), and peroration. Next he&nbsp;illustrated the topic of general probability (εtκoς), showing&nbsp;its two-edged use : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> if a puny man is accused of assaulting a stronger, he can say, “ Is it likely that I should&nbsp;have attacked him ?” If </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa,</span><span class="font0"> the strong man can&nbsp;argue, “ Is it likely that I should have committed an&nbsp;assault where the presumption was sure to be against&nbsp;me ?” This topic of εtκoς, in its manifold forms, was in&nbsp;fact the great weapon of the earliest Greek rhetoric. It&nbsp;was further developed by Tisias, the pupil of Corax, as we&nbsp;see from Plato’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phædrus,</span><span class="font0"> in an “ art ” of rhetoric which&nbsp;antiquity possessed, but of which we know little else.&nbsp;Aristotle gives the εtκoς a place among the topics of the&nbsp;fallacious enthymeme which he enumerates in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhet.</span><span class="font0"> ii. 24,&nbsp;remarking that it was the very essence of the treatise of&nbsp;Corax, and points out the fallacy of omitting to distinguish between abstract and particular probability, quoting&nbsp;the verses of Agatho,—“ Perhaps one might call this very&nbsp;thing a probability, that many improbable things will&nbsp;happen to men.” Gorgias of Leontini, who visited&nbsp;Athens as an envoy from his fellow-citizens in 427 b.c.,&nbsp;captivated the Athenians by his oratory, which, so far as&nbsp;the only considerable fragment warrants a judgment, was&nbsp;characterized by florid antithesis. But he has no definite&nbsp;place in the development of rhetoric as a system. It is&nbsp;doubtful whether he left a written “art”; and his mode&nbsp;of teaching was based on learning prepared passages by&nbsp;heart,—diction (λε⅛ις), not invention or arrangement,&nbsp;being his great object.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first extant Greek author who combined the theory λvith the practice of rhetoric is the Athenian Antiphon,&nbsp;the first on the list of the Attic orators. His works&nbsp;belong to the period from 421 to 411 b.c. Among&nbsp;them are the three “ tetralogies.” Each tetralogy is&nbsp;a group of four speeches, supposed to be spoken in a&nbsp;trial for homicide. Antiphon was the earliest representative at Athens of a new profession created by the&nbsp;new art of rhetoric—that of the λογογράφος or writer of&nbsp;forensic speeches for other men to speak in court. The&nbsp;plain man who had not mastered the newly invented&nbsp;weapons of speech was glad to have the aid of an expert.&nbsp;The tetralogies show us the art of rhetoric in its transition from the technical to the practical stage, from the&nbsp;school to the law-court and the assembly. The four&nbsp;skeleton speeches of each tetralogy are ordered as follows :&nbsp;—A, the accuser states his charge ; B, the accused makes&nbsp;his defence ; C, the accuser replies ; D, the accused rejoins&nbsp;to the reply. The imaginary case is in each instance&nbsp;sketched as slightly as possible; all details are omitted ;&nbsp;only the framework for discussion is supplied. The&nbsp;organic lines of the rhetorical pleader’s thought stand out&nbsp;in bold relief, and we are enabled to form a clear notion&nbsp;of the logographer’s method. We find a striking illustration of the fact noticed above, that the topic of “probability,” so largely used by Corax and Tisias, is the&nbsp;staple of this early forensic rhetoric. Viewed generally,&nbsp;the works of Antiphon are of great interest for the history&nbsp;of Attic prose, as marking how far it had then been influenced by a theory of style. The movement of Antiphon’s&nbsp;prose has a certain grave dignity, “impressing by its&nbsp;weight and grandeur,” as a Greek critic in the Augustan&nbsp;age says, “not charming by its life and flow.” Verbal&nbsp;antithesis is used, not in a diffuse or florid way, but with a&nbsp;certain sledge-hammer force, as sometimes in the speeches&nbsp;of Thucydides. The imagery, too, though bold, is not&nbsp;florid. The structure of the periods is still crude ; and&nbsp;the general effect of the whole, though often powerful and&nbsp;impressive, is somewhat rigid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As Antiphon represents what was afterwards named the “austere” or “rugged” style </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(avστηρh αρμονία},</span><span class="font0"> so&nbsp;Lysias was the model of an artistic and versatile simplicity. But the tetralogies give Antiphon a place in&nbsp;the history of rhetoric as an art, while Lysias, with&nbsp;all his more attractive gifts, belongs only to the history&nbsp;of oratory. Ancient writers quote an “art” of rhetoric&nbsp;by Isocrates, but its authenticity was questioned. It is&nbsp;certain, however, that Isocrates taught the art as such.&nbsp;He is said to have defined rhetoric “ as the science&nbsp;of persuasion ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(επιστήμην πειθovς,</span><span class="font0"> Sextus Empir., </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Adv.&nbsp;Maihem.,</span><span class="font0"> ii. § 62, p. 301 s7.). Many of his particular&nbsp;precepts, both on arrangement and on diction, are cited,&nbsp;but do not suffice to give us a complete view of his&nbsp;method. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φιλοσοφία,</span><span class="font0"> or “theory of culture,” which Isocrates expounds in his discourses “ Against the Sophists ”&nbsp;andon the “Antidosis,” was in fact rhetoric applied to&nbsp;politics. First came technical expositions : the pupil was&nbsp;introduced to all the artificial resources which prose composition employs (τας tδεας άπάσας aις ό λόγος </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">τυγχάνει&nbsp;χpωμεvo&lt;s, Antid.,</span><span class="font0"> § 183). The same term (ιδεat) is also&nbsp;used by Isocrates in a narrower sense, with reference&nbsp;to the “ figures ” of rhetoric, properly called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">σχήματα&nbsp;(PanatE,</span><span class="font0"> § 2) ; sometimes, again, in a sense still more&nbsp;general, to the several branches or styles of literary composition </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Λntid.,</span><span class="font0"> § 11). When the technical elements of&nbsp;the subject had been learned, the pupil was required to&nbsp;apply abstract rules in actual composition, and his essay&nbsp;was revised by the master. Isocrates was unquestionably&nbsp;successful in forming speakers and writers. This is proved&nbsp;by the renown of his school during a period of some fifty&nbsp;years, from about 390 to 340 b.c. Among the statesmen whom it could claim were Timotheus, Leodamas&nbsp;of Acharnæ, Lycurgus, and Hyperides. Among the&nbsp;philosophers or rhetoricians were Speusippus, Plato’s successor in the Academy, and Isæus ; among the historians,&nbsp;Ephorus and Theopompus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the person of Isocrates the art of rhetoric is thus thoroughly established, not merely as a technical method,&nbsp;but also as a practical discipline of life. If Plato’s mildly&nbsp;ironical reference in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Euthydemus</span><span class="font0"> to a critic “on the&nbsp;borderland between philosophy and statesmanship ” was&nbsp;meant, as is probable, for Isocrates, at least there was&nbsp;a wide difference between the measure of acceptance</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
