<p><span class="font0">claſſic authors which were miſunderſtood by Man, IO. The triumph which he gained over this virulent adverſary he did not long enjoy ; for he died at Edinburgh on the 19th of January 1757, in the 83d&nbsp;year of his age, and was buried in the Grey Friars&nbsp;churchyard without any monument to diſtinguiſh his&nbsp;grave.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was three times married, but left behind him only one daughter, Aliſon, who was married in 1747 to James Stewart, Eſq. He is ſuppoſed to have died&nbsp;worth L. 3000 Sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was of the middle ſize, of a thin and ſtraight make, and had eves remarkably piercing. Of his talents and learning his works afford the moſt ſatisfactory&nbsp;proofs. His memory was tenacious and exact. He&nbsp;could repeat long paſſages of his favourite poet Ovid,&nbsp;to the amount of 60 lines, and without omitting a word.&nbsp;He was ſo great a maſter in the Latin language, that&nbsp;he has perhaps been equalled by none ſince the days of&nbsp;Buchanan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruddiman has left a character unſtained by vice, and diſtinguiſhed by many virtues. His piety was exemplary. He ſpent Sunday in religious employment; and&nbsp; we are informed had prayers read to him every morning by his amanuenſis when the infirmities of age required ſuch an aſſiſtant. He was frugal of his time,&nbsp;neither indolent nor fond of amuſement ; and ſo remarkably temperate, that it is ſaid he was never intoxicated.&nbsp;Though often forced into controverſy, and treated with&nbsp;iuſolence, he never deſcended to ſcurrility and abuſe, nor&nbsp;cheriſhed reſentment againſt his enemies. His candour&nbsp;was much admired in one inſtance in the favourable&nbsp;character which he publiſhed in the Caledonian Mercury of his antagoniſt Love @@(b), after his deceaſe. Upon&nbsp;the whole, it muſt be allowed that Ruddiman has been&nbsp;of great ſervice to claſſical literature, and an honour to&nbsp;his native country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUDESHEIM, a rich village of the Rhinegan, ſituated about five miles from the city of Mentz, contains about 2500 inhabitants. The wine of this place&nbsp;is looked upon as without compariſon the beſt of the&nbsp;Rhinegau, and conſequently of all Germany. Baron&nbsp;Rieſheck ſays, he found it much more fiery than that of&nbsp;Hochheim but that for pleaſantneſs of taſte there is&nbsp;no compariſon betwixt them. The beſt Rudeſheim,&nbsp;like the beſt Hochheimer, ſells upon the ſpot far three&nbsp;guilders the bottle. “ You can (ſays our author) have&nbsp;no tolerable wine here for one guilder, nor any very&nbsp;good for two ; at leaſt I ſhould prefer the worſt Burgundy I ever tailed to any Rudeſheimer I met with either here or at Mentz for theſe prices. Indeed the&nbsp;wine of our hoſt (a rich eccleſiaſtic) was far better&nbsp;than any we could get at the inn. It ſtands to reaſon,&nbsp;that the fame vintage furniſhes grapes of very different&nbsp;degrees of goodneſs ; but beſides this, it is in the Rhinegau as every where elſe. The beſt wines </span><span class="font1">are </span><span class="font0">generally ſent abroad by the poor and middling inhabitants,&nbsp;and the worſt kept for internal conſumption ; for the expence of the carriage being the ſame in both caſes,&nbsp;ſtrangers had much rather pay a double price for the&nbsp;good than have the bad. It is only rich people, ſuch&nbsp;as our hoſt was, who can afford to keep the produce of&nbsp;their land for their own drinking. Upon this principle, I have eaten much better Swiſs cheeſes out of&nbsp;Switzerland than in it, and have drank much better&nbsp;Rheniſh in the inns of the northern parts of Germany&nbsp;than in the «country where the wine grows. The poſition of the country alſo contributes to render the wine&nbsp;dearer than it would otherwiſe be. As the beſt wine&nbsp;grows in its more northern parts, the eaſy tranſport by&nbsp;the Rhine to Holland, and all parts of the world,&nbsp;raiſes its price above its real value. The place where&nbsp;the flower of the Rudeſheim wine grows is preciſely the&nbsp;neck of the land, formed by the winding of the Rhine&nbsp;to the north, after it has run to the weſtward from Mentz&nbsp;hither. This neck, which is a rock almoſt perpendicular, enjoys the ſirſt rays of the riſing and the laſt of&nbsp;the ſetting ſun. It is divided into ſmall low terraces,&nbsp;which are carried up to the utmoſt top oſ the hill like&nbsp;ſteep ſtairs ; theſe are guarded by ſmall walls and&nbsp;earthen mounds, which are often waſhed away by thc&nbsp;rain. The firſt vine was brought hither from France,&nbsp;and they ſtill call the beſt grape the Orleannois. They&nbsp;plant the vine ſtocks very low, ſcarce ever more than&nbsp;four or five ſeet high. This way of planting the vine&nbsp;is favourable to the production oſ a great deal of wine&nbsp;but not to its goodneſs, as the phlegmatic and harſh&nbsp;parts oſ it would certainly evaporate more, if the ſap&nbsp;was refined through higher and more numerous canals.&nbsp;This is undoubtedly the reaſon why every kind of Rheniſh has ſomething in it that is harſh, four, and watery.&nbsp;The harveſt of the beſt vineyards, which are the lower&nbsp;ones, in the above-mentioned neck of land, is often&nbsp;bought before-hand, at the advanced price of ſome ducats, by Dutch and other merchants. It muſt be a&nbsp;very rich ſtock to yield above four meaſures of wine.—&nbsp;You may eaſily imagine, that the cultivation of vineyards muſt be very expenſive in this country, as the&nbsp;dung, which is extremely dear, muſt be carried up to&nbsp;the top of the mountains on the peaſants ſhoulders ”</span></p>
