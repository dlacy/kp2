<p><span class="font0">joined the committee of public safety, and the laws of the maximum and of the suspects were by no means of his&nbsp;creation. The reason why he is almost universally regarded&nbsp;as its creator and the dominant spirit in the committee of&nbsp;public safety is not hard to discover. Men like Carnot&nbsp;and Billaud-Varenne were not conspicuous speakers in the&nbsp;convention, nor were they the idols of any section of the&nbsp;populace; but Robespierre had a fanatical following among&nbsp;the Jacobins and was admittedly the most popular orator&nbsp;in the convention. His panegyrics on the system of&nbsp;revolutionary government and his praise of virtue led his&nbsp;hearers to believe that the system of the Terror, instead&nbsp;of being monstrous, was absolutely laudable ; his pure life&nbsp;and admitted incorruptibility threw a lustre on the committee of which he was a member ; and his colleagues&nbsp;offered no opposition to his posing as their representative&nbsp;and reflecting some of his personal popularity upon them&nbsp;so long as he did not interfere with their work. Moreover,&nbsp;he alone never left Paris, whilst all the others, except&nbsp;Barere, were constantly engaged on missions to the armies,&nbsp;the navy, and the provinces. It has been asserted that&nbsp;Robespierre, Couthon, and Saint-Just took upon themselves the direction of “la haute politique,” while the&nbsp;other members acted only in subordinate capacities ; undoubtedly it would have suited Robespierre to have had&nbsp;this believed, but as a matter of fact he was in no way&nbsp;especially trusted in matters of supreme importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After this explanation it may be said at once that Robespierre was not the author of the overthrow of the&nbsp;Dantonists and the Hébertists, though he thoroughly&nbsp;agreed with the majority and had no desire to save them,&nbsp;the principles of both parties being obnoxious to him.&nbsp;The Hébertists were communists in the true meaning of&nbsp;the word. They held that each commune should be self-governing, and, while admitting the right of a central&nbsp;authority to levy men and money for the purposes of the&nbsp;state, they believed that in purely internal matters, as well&nbsp;as in determining the mode in which men and money&nbsp;were to be raised, the local government ought to be&nbsp;supreme. This position of the Hébertists was of course&nbsp;obnoxious to the great committee, who believed that success could only be won by their retention of absolute&nbsp;power; and in the winter of 1791-95 it became obvious&nbsp;that the Hébertist party must perish, or its opposition to&nbsp;the committee would grow too formidable owing to its&nbsp;paramount influence in the commune of Paris. Robespierre shared his colleagues’ fear of the Hébertist opinions,&nbsp;and he had a personal reason for disliking that party of&nbsp;atheists and sansculottes, since he believed in the necessity&nbsp;of religious faith, and was too much of a gentleman not&nbsp;to detest their imitation of the grossness that belongs to&nbsp;the lowest class of the populace. In 1792 he had indignantly thrown from him the cap of liberty which an ardent&nbsp;admirer had placed upon his head ; he had never pandered&nbsp;to the depraved tastes of the mob by using their language;&nbsp;and to the last day of his life he wore knee-breeches and&nbsp;silk stockings and wore his hair powdered. His position&nbsp;towards the Dantonist party was of a different character.&nbsp;After having seen established the strong executive he had&nbsp;laboured for, and having moved the resolutions which&nbsp;finally consolidated the power of the committee of public&nbsp;safety in September 1793, Danton retired to his country&nbsp;house to enjoy the pleasures of domestic life. But to his&nbsp;retreat came the news of the means the committee used to&nbsp;maintain their supremacy. Danton was not a man who&nbsp;scrupled to shed blood when necessary, but he did not see&nbsp;that this continuous series of sacrifices on the guillotine&nbsp;was necessary ; hence he inspired Camille Desmoulins to&nbsp;protest against the Terror in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vieux Cordelier,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;noblest expression of revolutionary thought. Where is&nbsp;this system of terror to end ? what is the good of a tyranny&nbsp;comparable only to that of the Roman emperors as&nbsp;described by Tacitus? Such were the questions which&nbsp;Camille Desmoulins asked under Danton’s inspiration.&nbsp;This “ moderantism,” as it was called, was as objectionable&nbsp;to the members of the great committee as the doctrines of&nbsp;the Hébertists. Both parties must be crushed. Before&nbsp;the blows at the leaders of those two parties were struck,&nbsp;Robespierre retired for a month (from 13th February to&nbsp;l3th March 1794) from active business in the convention&nbsp;and the committee, apparently to consider his position ;&nbsp;but he came to the conclusion that the cessation of the&nbsp;Reign of Terror would mean the loss of that supremacy&nbsp;by which he hoped to establish the ideal of Rousseau, for&nbsp;Danton, he knew, was essentially a practical statesman and&nbsp;laughed at his ideas. He must have considered too that&nbsp;the result of his siding with Danton would probably have&nbsp;been fatal to himself. The result of his deliberations was&nbsp;that he abandoned Danton and co-operated in the attacks&nbsp;of the committee on the two parties. On the l5th of&nbsp;March he reappeared in the convention; on the 19th Hébert&nbsp;and his friends were arrested ; and on the 24th they were&nbsp;guillotined. On the 30th of March Danton, Camille&nbsp;Desmoulins, and their friends were arrested, and on the&nbsp;5th of April they too were guillotined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was not until after the execution of Danton that Robespierre began to develop a policy distinct from that&nbsp;of his colleagues in the great committee, an opposition&nbsp;which ended in his downfall. He began by using his influence over the Jacobin Club to dominate the commune of&nbsp;Paris through his devoted adherents, two of whom, Fleuriot-Lescot and Payan, were elected respectively mayor and procureur of the commune. He also attempted to usurp the&nbsp;influence of the other members of the great committee over&nbsp;the armies by getting his young adherent, Saint-Just, sent&nbsp;on a mission to the frontier. In Paris Robespierre determined to increase the pressure of the Terror : no one&nbsp;should accuse him of moderantism ; through the increased&nbsp;efficiency of the revolutionary tribunal Paris should tremble&nbsp;before him as the chief member of the great committee ;&nbsp;and the convention should pass whatever measures he might&nbsp;dictate. To secure his aims, Couthon, his other ally in the&nbsp;committee, proposed and carried on the lθth of June the&nbsp;outrageous law of 2 2d Prairial, by which even the appearance of justice was taken from the tribunal, which, as no&nbsp;witnesses were allowed, became a simple court of condemnation. The result of this law was that between the l2th&nbsp;of June and the 28th of July, the day of Robespierre’s&nbsp;death, no less than 1285 victims perished on the guillotine&nbsp;at Paris. But before this there had taken place in Robespierre’s life an episode of supreme importance as illustrating his character and his political aims : on the 7th of May&nbsp;he secured a decree from the convention recognizing the&nbsp;existence of the Supreme Being. In His honour a great&nbsp;fête was held on the 8th of June ; Robespierre, as president of the convention, walked first and delivered his&nbsp;harangue, and as he looked around him he may well have&nbsp;believed that his position was secured and that he was at&nbsp;last within reach of a supreme power which should enable&nbsp;him to impose his belief on all France, and so ensure its&nbsp;happiness. The majority of the great committee found&nbsp;his popularity—or rather his ascendency, for as that increased his personal popularity diminished—useful to&nbsp;them, since by increasing the stringency of the Terror he&nbsp;strengthened the position of the committee, whilst attracting to himself, as occupying the most prominent position&nbsp;in it, any latent feeling of dissatisfaction at such stringency.&nbsp;Of the issue of a struggle between themselves and Robespierre they had little fear : they controlled the committee&nbsp;of general security through their alliance with its leaders,</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
