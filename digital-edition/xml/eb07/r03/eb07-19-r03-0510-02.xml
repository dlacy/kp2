Wood styles him “ the ornament, for wit and ingenuity, of Pembroke Hall in Cambridge.” In a word, he was a very great benefactor to the English stage, having, exclusively of his aid lent to Middleton, Day, Heywood, Webster, and others, left us five plays of his own composition, and one in which even the immortal Shakspeare afforded him some assistance.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rowley Regis, a town of the parish of Dudley, in Worcestershire, although within the hundred of Seisdon, in Staffordshire, and chiefly inhabited by nail-makers and other workers in iron.
