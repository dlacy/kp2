<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">January 1409. Although his father was crowned king of Naples at Avignon by Pope Clement VII. in 1384, he was&nbsp;unable to make good his claims. After his death Louis&nbsp;III., the elder son, assumed the title, and in 1423 was&nbsp;adopted by Johanna II. of Naples, and obtained possession&nbsp;of the throne. Dying 15th November 1434, he left his&nbsp;claims to his brother René, who was also appointed heir&nbsp;by Johanna II. at her death in the following year.&nbsp;Meantime René had been imprisoned by the count of&nbsp;Vaudemont for contesting his claims to the dukedom of&nbsp;Lorraine, and therefore appointed his wife Isabella regent&nbsp;in his stead. In 1437 he procured his freedom and the&nbsp;acknowledgment of his right to Lorraine for 400,000&nbsp;florins, and in the following year landed at Naples and&nbsp;rejoined Isabella. Finding, however, that the task of&nbsp;conquering the kingdom from Alphonso of Aragon was&nbsp;beyond his power, he returned in 1442 to Lorraine, which&nbsp;he afterwards gave over to his son John, titular duke of&nbsp;Calabria. In 1444 he took part at Tours in the peace&nbsp;negotiations between England and France; and, to cement&nbsp;the alliance, Henry VI. espoused his daughter Margaret&nbsp;of Anjou. Subsequently he ceased to concern himself&nbsp;with politics, and devoted his chief attention to literature.&nbsp;He also took a special interest in painting and sculpture,&nbsp;although there appears to have been no foundation for&nbsp;the statement that he practised either of these arts. His&nbsp;closing years were spent in the company of his daughter&nbsp;the exiled queen. He died 10th July 1480.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RENFREW, a county of Scotland, skirting the Firth of Clyde, lies between 55° 40' 34&quot; and 55° 57' 45&quot; N. lat.,&nbsp;and between 4° 13' and 4° 54' W. long., and is bounded&nbsp;N. by the Clyde, N.E. by Dumbarton and by Lanark, E.&nbsp;by Lanark, S. by Ayr, and W. by the Firth of Clyde. Its&nbsp;greatest length from west-north-west to east-south-east&nbsp;is 30| miles, and its greatest breadth at right angles to&nbsp;this 13J miles. The area is 253793־ square miles or&nbsp;162,427958־ acres, of which 2021179־ acres are foreshore&nbsp;and 3621342־ are water. Except a small portion opposite&nbsp;the burgh of Renfrew, the whole county lies to the south&nbsp;of the Clyde. Twenty-seventh among the Scottish&nbsp;counties as regards extent, it is fifth in point of population,&nbsp;and Midlothian alone is as densely populated, the number&nbsp;of inhabitants to the square mile in 1881 having been&nbsp;1075 in both. For local purposes the county is divided&nbsp;into an upper and a lower ward, the former embracing the&nbsp;two-thirds lying to the east, and having its district centre&nbsp;at Paisley, while the latter contains the parishes of Innerkip,&nbsp;Greenock, Port Glasgow, and Kilmalcolm, and has its district centre at Greenock. The southern border and western&nbsp;part of the county are hilly, but none of the heights rise&nbsp;very much above sea-level, the highest points being Misty&nbsp;Law (1663), East Girt Hill (1673), Hill of Stake (1711),&nbsp;and Burnt Hill (1572), all along the border of Ayrshire.&nbsp;The central part is undulating and, as much of the higher&nbsp;portion of it is well wooded, the scenery is in some places&nbsp;picturesque. Along the greater part of the northern border&nbsp;is a flat tract of clayey carse-land known locally as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> laich lands, ” and very fertile in favourable seasons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The principal river is the Clyde, which forms a considerable portion of the northern boundary ; and the other chief streams are&nbsp;the White Cart, Black Cart, and Gryfe. The first has its chief&nbsp;sources in the extreme south-east of the county, and flows northward—forming for most of the way the boundary with Lanarkshire—&nbsp;to Cathcart, south of Glasgow, whence it has a westerly course to&nbsp;Paisley, and then again a northerly course till it joins the Clyde a&nbsp;mile north-west of the burgh of Renfrew. The Black Cart issues&nbsp;from Castle Semple Loch near the centre of the southern border of</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the county, and follows a general north-easterly course to its junction with the White Cart at Inchinnan church a mile west of the burgh of Renfrew. Its most important headwater is the river&nbsp;Calder, which, with smaller streams flowing to it, drains a considerable portion of the southern border and flows into Castle Semple&nbsp;Loch at Lochwinnoch. The Gryfe, which, with a large number of&nbsp;streams flowing to it, drains nearly all the western half of the&nbsp;county, rises at Gryfe Reservoir, 2^ miles south of Greenock, and has&nbsp;a winding easterly course to its junction with the Black Cart at&nbsp;Walkinshaw, 2 miles north-west of Paisley. A number of smaller&nbsp;streams flow direct to the Clyde, the most important being the&nbsp;Kip and the Kelly Burn in the west of the county. The principal&nbsp;lochs arc Loch Thom and Gryfe Reservoir, 2£ miles south of&nbsp;Greenock; Castle Semple Loch, near the centre of the southern&nbsp;border; Long Loch and Loch Goin, farther east near the same&nbsp;border; and Balgray and Glen Reservoirs, connected with the&nbsp;Glasgow water supply near the centre of the eastern part of the&nbsp;county. The Glasgow, Paisley, and Johnstone Canal, which formerly united these three towns, has since 1882 been laid dry along&nbsp;the greater part of its course and the bed converted into a railway&nbsp;line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The rocks throughout the county are Carboniferous, and almost the whole of the Lower Carboniferous or Calciferous Sandstone&nbsp;series is here represented by a thick set of volcanic deposits. The&nbsp;oldest beds are the red sandstones, cornstones, and conglomerates&nbsp;which occupy the extreme west corner between Innerkip and Loch&nbsp;Thom. Overlying these is the upper portion of the Lower Carboniferous—the cement-stone group—which runs from the hills&nbsp;behind Greenock on the west, south-eastward by the high ground&nbsp;south of Paisley, and so on to the south-east corner of the county&nbsp;and thence into Lanarkshire. The cement-stones form the underlying deposits over nearly two-thirds of the county to the south,&nbsp;west and west; but, though the base of this subdivision here consists of the usual white sandstones and cement-stones, yet the great&nbsp;mass of the rocks are contemporaneous lava-flows—basalts, mela-phyres, and porphyrites—with interbedded tuffs and volcanic&nbsp;agglomerates which have all issued from a line of vents the positions of which may still be traced by the volcanic necks which&nbsp;remain at several points. In the south-east there are intercalated&nbsp;beds of sandstone, shale, and impure limestone. In some places&nbsp;this series of beds passes conformably up into the overlying Carboniferous Limestone series, which occupies a basin covering nearly&nbsp;one-third of the county to the north-east; but the two subdivisions&nbsp;are oftener brought into contact by faults, a double line of which&nbsp;along the valley of the Black Cart brings a narrow tract of the&nbsp;limestones right across the volcanic beds just described. The base&nbsp;of the Carboniferous Limestone subdivision consists of limestones,&nbsp;the middle portion of a series of valuable seams of coal and ironstone, which are extensively worked, and the upper part of limestones. Masses of intrusive volcanic rocks occur to the south of&nbsp;Johnstone and the north-east of Paisley, and to the north of Johnstone and north-west of Paisley are oil-producing shales, which are&nbsp;worked at Clippens and Walkinshaw. Near Pollokshields, at&nbsp;Thornliebank, and to the east of Barrhead there are small outliers&nbsp;of millstone grit consisting of yellow sandstones ; and along the&nbsp;extreme north-east corner of the county to the south of Glasgow&nbsp;the true Coal Measures of the great Lanarkshire and Stirlingshire&nbsp;basin are brought in by a fault which throws them down against&nbsp;the Carboniferous Limestone series. Volcanic dykes of Tertiary&nbsp;age run across the older rocks at various points, some very well&nbsp;marked examples occurring near the centre of the southern boi'der.&nbsp;The Glacial deposits are well marked and interesting, the clays at&nbsp;Jordanhill to the north of the Clyde and near Paisley having&nbsp;yielded numerous species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Foraminifcra</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and arctic shells. The&nbsp;beds of economic value are all extensively worked. In 1882 the&nbsp;eighteen collieries within the county produced 114,324 tons of coal&nbsp;out of a total of 20,515,134 tons for all Scotland, 164,523 tons of&nbsp;ironstone out of a total of 2,404,177 tons, 90,804 tons of oil-shale&nbsp;out of a total of 994,487 tons, and 22,554 tons of fireclay out of a&nbsp;total of 435,457 tons. Limestones are also quarried in large&nbsp;quantities for smelting purposes and for the manufacture of lime,—&nbsp;one thin but valuable bed at Orchard, 4 miles south of Glasgow,&nbsp;producing a cement that </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> sets </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> under water. Copperas is obtained&nbsp;from the iron pyrites got in the shale, and at one time alum-shale&nbsp;was worked at Hurlet in the north-east and copper in the volcanic&nbsp;rocks about Lochwinnoch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Farming operations do not differ in detail from those carried on in the adjoining middle and lower wards of Lanarkshire. The&nbsp;climate is very variable ; and, as the prevailing west and south-west&nbsp;winds come in from the Atlantic warm and full of moisture, contact with the colder land causes a׳cry heavy rains, and the western&nbsp;part of Renfrewshire is one of the wettest districts in Scotland, the&nbsp;mean annual rainfall amounting to over 60 inches. The mean&nbsp;annual temperature is about 48°. The hilly district has a good&nbsp;deal of moss and moorland, but the soil, which is a light earth, is&nbsp;also over considerable areas deep enough to produce good pasture.&nbsp;In the undulating middle district the soil is generally deeper and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
