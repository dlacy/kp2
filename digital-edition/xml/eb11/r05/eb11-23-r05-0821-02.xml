<p><label>RUFUS, LUCIUS VARIUS</label>
(c 74-14 b.c.), Roman poet of the Augustan age. He was the friend of Virgil, after whose death he and Plotius Tucca prepared the <hi rend="italic">Aeneid</hi> for publication, and of Horace, for whom he and Virgil obtained an introduction to Maecenas. Horace speaks of him as a master of epic and the only poet capable of celebrating the achievements of Vipsanius Agrippa <hi rend="italic">{Odes,</hi> i. 6); Virgil (under the name of Lycidas, <hi rend="italic">Eel.</hi> ix. 35) regrets that he had hitherto produced nothing comparable to the work of Varius or Helvius Cinna. From Macrobius <hi rend="italic">{Saturnalia,</hi> vi. 1, 39; 2, 19) we learn that Varius composed an epic poem <hi rend="italic">De Morte,</hi> some lines of which are quoted as having been imitated or appropriated by Virgil; Horace <hi rend="italic">{Sat.</hi> i. 10, 43) probably alludes to another epic, and, according to the scholiast on <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi> i. 16, 27-29, these three lines are taken bodily from a panegyric of Varius on Augustus. But his most famous literary production was the tragedy <hi rend="italic">Thyesles,</hi> which Quintilian <hi rend="italic">{Inst. Oral.</hi> x. 1, 98) declares fit to rank with any of the Greek tragedies. The didascalia (which is preserved in a Paris MS.) informs us that it was produced at the games celebrated (29 B.c.) by Augustus in honour of the victory at Actium, and that Varius received a present of a million sesterces from the emperor.</p><p>Fragments in E.
