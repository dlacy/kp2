<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gentle Shepherd</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> is the only production of Ramsay’s that has much claim to remembrance. His lyrics for the&nbsp;most part are poor artificial imitations, adorned here and&nbsp;there with pretty fancies, but devoid of sincerity of feeling.&nbsp;He is happier in his humorous descriptions of character&nbsp;and occasional personal poems; “ renowned Allan, canty&nbsp;callan,” as his admirers loved to call him, had a quick&nbsp;sense of the ridiculous and a firm touch in the exhibition&nbsp;of what amused him. Once he had established a character&nbsp;as a poet he abandoned the trade of wig-making, set up as&nbsp;a bookseller, and was the first to start a circulating library&nbsp;in Scotland. From his shop in High Street opposite Niddry&nbsp;Street he issued his incidental poems in broadsheets, and&nbsp;made a volume of them in 1721, and another in 1728.&nbsp;The nucleus of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gentle Shepherd</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> was laid in separately&nbsp;issued pastoral dialogues; round these the complete drama&nbsp;was built and published as a whole in 1725. As a collector, editor, imitator, and publisher of old Scottish poetry&nbsp;Ramsay gave an impetus to vernacular literature at least as&nbsp;great as that given by his principal original poem. His&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tea-Table Miscellany</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, published in 1724, for which English&nbsp;as well a</span><span class="font0">3</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Scottish poets and moderns as well as ancients&nbsp;were laid under contribution, was extremely popular; and&nbsp;his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Evergreen</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1724), a collection of poems written prior&nbsp;to 1G00, was the precursor of Bishop Percy’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reliques</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in a&nbsp;similar field. A collection of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fables,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> published complete in&nbsp;1730, part original, part translated from La Motte and La&nbsp;Fontaine, was Ramsay’s last literary work, but he lived to&nbsp;an advanced age, dying in 1758, the year before the birth&nbsp;of Burns. One of the speculations of the enlightened and&nbsp;enterprising man of business was a theatre, which was&nbsp;opened in 1736, but soon shut up by the magistrates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A complete edition of Ramsay’s poems was issued by A. Gardner in 1877.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMSAY, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Allan■ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1713-1784), portrait-painter, the eldest son of the author of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Gentle Shepherd,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> was&nbsp;born at Edinburgh about 1713.@@<sup>1</sup> Ramsay manifested an&nbsp;aptitude for art from an early period, and at the age&nbsp;of twenty we find him in London studying under the&nbsp;Swedish painter Hans Huyssing, and at the St Martin’s&nbsp;Lane Academy; and in 1736 he left for Rome, where he&nbsp;worked for three years under Solimena and Imperiali&nbsp;(Fernandi). On his return he settled in Edinburgh ; and,&nbsp;having attracted attention by his head of Forbes of&nbsp;Culloden and his full-length of the duke of Argyll, he&nbsp;removed to London, where he was patronized by the duke&nbsp;of Bridgewater. His pleasant manners and varied culture,&nbsp;not less than his artistic skill, contributed to render him&nbsp;popular.. In 1767 the Scotsman was appointed to succeed&nbsp;Shakelton as principal painter to His Majesty; and so&nbsp;fully employed was he on the royal portraits which the&nbsp;king was in the habit of presenting to ambassadors and&nbsp;colonial governors that he was forced to take advantage&nbsp;of the services of a host of assistants—of whom David&nbsp;Martin and Philip Reinagle are the best known—upon&nbsp;the minor portions of his works, and sometimes on the&nbsp;faces themselves. His life in London was varied by&nbsp;frequent visits to Italy, where he occupied himself more&nbsp;in literary and antiquarian research than with art. But&nbsp;at length this prosperous career came to an end. The&nbsp;painter’s health was shattered by an accident, a dislocation&nbsp;of the right arm. With an unflinching pertinacity, which&nbsp;we can understand when we see the firm-set resolute&nbsp;mouth of his own portrait, he struggled till he had completed a likeness of the king upon which he was engaged&nbsp;at the time, and then started for his beloved Italy, leaving</span></p><div>
<p></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">behind him a series of fifty royal portraits to be completed by his assistant Reinagle. For several years he lingered&nbsp;in the south, his constitution finally broken. He died&nbsp;at Dover on the 10th of August 1784.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In his art Ramsay paid the penalty of popularity : the quality of the work which bears his name suffered from his unremitting&nbsp;assiduity as a court-painter and from his unsparing employment&nbsp;of assistants. Among his most satisfactory productions are some&nbsp;of his earlier ones, such as the full-length of the duke of Argyll,&nbsp;and the numerous bust-portraits of Scottish gentlemen and their&nbsp;ladies which he executed before settling in London. They are&nbsp;full of both grace and individuality ; the features show excellent&nbsp;draughtsmanship ; and the flesh-painting is firm and sound in&nbsp;method, though frequently tending a little to hardness and opacity.&nbsp;His full-length of Lady Mary Coke is an especially elegant female&nbsp;portrait, remarkable for the skill and delicacy with which the white&nbsp;satin drapery is managed ; while in the portrait of his brown-eyed&nbsp;wife, the eldest daughter of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick, in&nbsp;the Scottish National Gallery, we have a sweetness and tenderness&nbsp;which shows the painter at his highest. This last-named work&nbsp;shows the influence of French art, an influence which helped&nbsp;greatly to form the practice of Ramsay, and which is even more&nbsp;clearly visible in the large collection of his sketches in- the possession of the Royal Scottish Academy and the Board of Trustees,&nbsp;Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMSAY, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Andrew Michael </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1686-1743), commonly called the “Chevalier Ramsay,” who was born at Ayr,&nbsp;Scotland, on 9th January 1686, is noteworthy as having&nbsp;been among the few writers not of French birth who are&nbsp;admitted by French criticism to have written in French&nbsp;with purity and scholarship. Ramsay visited France comparatively early and came under the influence of Fénelon,&nbsp;which made him a convert to Roman Catholicism. He&nbsp;held several important tutorships in his adopted country,&nbsp;the chief of which was the charge of Prince Charles&nbsp;Edward and the future cardinal of York. His biographers&nbsp;mention with surprise the conferring of an honorary degree&nbsp;upon him by the university of Oxford. The claim was&nbsp;nominally his discipleship to Fénelon, but in reality beyond&nbsp;doubt his connexion with the Jacobite party. He died at&nbsp;St Germain-en-Laye (Seine-et-Oise) on </span><span class="font0">6</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">tli May 1743.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Ramsay’s principal work was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Travels of Cyrus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (London and Paris, 1727), a book composed in avowed imitation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Télémaque.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">He also edited </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Télémaque</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> itself with an introduction, and wrote&nbsp;an </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Essai de Politique</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> on the principles of his master and a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Histoire&nbsp;de la Vie et des Ouvrages de Fénelon,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> besides a partial biography of&nbsp;Turenne, some poems in English, and other miscellaneous works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMSAY, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">David </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1749-1815), American physician and historian, was the son of an Irish emigrant, and was born&nbsp;in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, on 2d April 1749.&nbsp;After graduating M.D. at Princeton College in 1765 he&nbsp;settled as a physician at Charleston, where he obtained an&nbsp;extensive practice. During the revolutionary Avar he&nbsp;served as a field-surgeon, and in 1776 he became a member of the South Carolina legislature. Ha\<sup>r</sup>ing acted as&nbsp;one of the “council of safety” at Charleston, he Avas on&nbsp;the capture of that city on 27th August 1780 seized by the&nbsp;British as a hostage, and for nearly a year was kept in&nbsp;confinement at St Augustine. From 1782 to 1786 he was&nbsp;a member of Congress. His interest in the revolutionary&nbsp;struggle led him to devote his leisure to the preparation&nbsp;of several historical works on the subject, and in 1785 he&nbsp;published in tAvo volumes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Revolution in&nbsp;South Carolina,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in 1789 in two volumes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of the&nbsp;American Revolution,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in 1801 a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Washington,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;in 1809 in two volumes a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of South Carolina.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">He was also the author of several minor works. He died&nbsp;at Charleston on </span><span class="font0">8</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">th May 1815 from a Avound inflicted by&nbsp;a lunatic. His </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of the United States</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in 3 vols, was&nbsp;published posthumously in 1816, and forms the first three&nbsp;volumes of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal History Americanized,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> published&nbsp;in 12 A<sup>r</sup>ols. in 1819.</span></p>
