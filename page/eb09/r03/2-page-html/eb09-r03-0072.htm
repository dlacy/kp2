            <p><span class="font2">ally suspended. For 85 and 84 Cinna nominated himself and a
                    trusted colleague as consuls.@@<sup>1</sup> The state was,
                        as&nbsp;Cicero@@<sup>2</sup> says, without lawful authority.@@<sup>3</sup>
                    One important&nbsp;matter was carried through—the registration in all
                    the&nbsp;tribes of the newly enfranchised Italians,@@<sup>4</sup> but beyond
                    this&nbsp;little was done. The attention of Cinna and his friends&nbsp;was in
                    truth engrossed by the ever-present dread of Sulla’s&nbsp;return from Asia. The
                    consul of 86, Valerius Flaccus,&nbsp;sent out to supersede him, was murdered by
                    his own&nbsp;soldiers at Nicomedia.@@<sup>5</sup> In 85 Sulla, though disowned
                    by&nbsp;his government, concluded a peace with Mithradates.@@<sup>6</sup>
                    In&nbsp;84, after settling affairs in Asia and crushing Flaccus’s successor
                    Fimbria, he crossed into Greece, and in the spring&nbsp;of 83 landed at
                    Brundusium with 40,000 soldiers and a&nbsp;large following of émigré nobles.
                    Cinna was dead,@@<sup>7</sup>&nbsp;murdered like Flaccus by his mutinous
                    soldiers ; his most&nbsp;trusted colleague Carbo was commanding as proconsul
                    in&nbsp;Cisalpine Gaul ; and the resistance offered to Sulla’s&nbsp;advance was
                    slight. At Capua Sulla routed the forces of&nbsp;one consul, Norbanus ; at
                    Teanum the troops of the other&nbsp;went over in a body to the side of the
                    outlawed proconsul.&nbsp;After a winter spent in Campania he pressed forward
                    to&nbsp;Rome, defeated the younger Marius (consul 82) near&nbsp;Præneste, and
                    entered the city without further opposition.&nbsp;In North Italy the success of
                    his lieutenants Metellus, C.&nbsp;Pompeius, and Marcus Crassus had been fully as
                    decisive.&nbsp;Cisalpine Gaul, Umbria, and Etruria had all been won
                    for&nbsp;Sulla, and the two principal leaders on the other side, Carbo&nbsp;and
                    Norbanus, had each fled, one to Rhodes, the other to&nbsp;Africa. Only one foe
                    remained to be conquered. The&nbsp;Samnites and Lucanians whom Cinna had
                    conciliated, and&nbsp;who saw in Sulla their bitterest foe, were for the last
                    time&nbsp;in arms, and had already joined forces with the remains of&nbsp;the
                    Marian army close to Rome. The decisive battle was&nbsp;fought under the walls
                    of the city, and ended in the complete defeat of the Marians and
                        Italians.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">For a period of nearly ten years Rome and Italy had been
                    distracted by civil war. Constitutional government,&nbsp;whether by senate or
                    assembly, had been in abeyance,&nbsp;while the opposing parties fought out their
                    quarrels with&nbsp;the sword, under the leadership of generals at the head
                    of&nbsp;legions ready and willing to follow them against their&nbsp;fellow
                    citizens and against the established authorities of&nbsp;the state. The strife
                    had spread from the Roman forum&nbsp;to Italy, and from Italy to the provinces ;
                    and for the first&nbsp;time the integrity of the empire was threatened by
                    the&nbsp;conflicts of rival governors.@@<sup>9</sup> The tottering fabric
                    of&nbsp;Italian prosperity had been rudely shaken by the ravages&nbsp;of war.
                    Class hatreds and personal feuds distracted the&nbsp;community, while the
                    enfranchisement of the Italians was&nbsp;in itself a revolution which affected
                    the very foundations&nbsp;of the republic. Such was the situation with
                    which&nbsp;Sulla was now called upon to deal. It was for him to&nbsp;heal the
                    divisions which rent the state asunder, to set in&nbsp;working again the
                    machinery of civil government, and&nbsp;above all so to modify it as to meet the
                    altered conditions,</span></p></div><br clear="all" />
        <p><span class="font2">and to fortify it against the dangers which visibly threatened it in
                the future. The real charge against&nbsp;Sulla@@<sup>10</sup> is not that he failed
                to accomplish all this, for to do&nbsp;so was beyond the powers even of a man so
                able, resolute,&nbsp;and self-confident as Sulla, armed though he was
                with&nbsp;absolute authority and backed by overwhelming military&nbsp;strength and
                the prestige of unbroken success. He stands&nbsp;convicted rather of deliberately
                aggravating some and&nbsp;culpably ignoring others of the evils he should have
                tried&nbsp;to cure, and of contenting himself with a party triumph&nbsp;when he
                should have aimed at the regeneration and confirmation of the whole state. His
                victory was instantly&nbsp;followed, not by any measures of conciliation, but by a
                series&nbsp;of massacres, proscriptions, and confiscations, of which&nbsp;almost the
                least serious consequence was the immediate&nbsp;loss of life which they
                    entailed.@@<sup>11</sup> From this time forward&nbsp;the fear of proscription
                and confiscation recurred as a&nbsp;possible consequence of every political crisis,
                and it was&nbsp;with difficulty that Cæsar himself dissipated the belief&nbsp;that
                his victory would be followed by a Sullan reign of&nbsp;terror. The legacy of hatred
                and discontent which Sulla&nbsp;left behind him was a constant source of disquiet
                and&nbsp;danger. In the children of the proscribed, whom he&nbsp;excluded from
                holding office, and the dispossessed owners&nbsp;of the confiscated lands, every
                agitator found ready and&nbsp;willing allies.@@<sup>12</sup> The moneyed men of the
                equestrian order&nbsp;were more than ever hostile to the senatorial
                government,&nbsp;which they now identified with the man who cherished&nbsp;towards
                them a peculiar hatred,@@<sup>13</sup> and whose creatures had&nbsp;hunted them down
                like dogs. The attachment which the&nbsp;new Italian citizens might in time have
                learnt to feel for&nbsp;the old republican constitution was nipped in the bud
                by&nbsp;the massacres at Præneste and Norba, by the harsh treatment of the ancient
                towns of Etruria, and by the ruthless&nbsp;desolation of Samnium and
                    Lucania.@@<sup>14</sup> Quite as fatal were&nbsp;the results to the economic
                prosperity of the peninsula.&nbsp;Sulla’s confiscations, following on the civil and
                social wars,&nbsp;opened the doors wide for a long train of evils. The&nbsp;veterans
                whom he planted on the lands he had seized@@<sup>15</sup> did&nbsp;nothing for
                agriculture, and swelled the growing numbers&nbsp;of the turbulent and
                    discontented.@@<sup>16</sup> The “ Sullan men ”&nbsp;became as great an object
                of fear and dislike as the&nbsp;“ Sullan reign.”@@<sup>17</sup> The “ latifundia ”
                increased with startling rapidity—whole territories passing into the hands
                of&nbsp;greedy partisans.@@<sup>18</sup> Wide tracts of land, confiscated
                but&nbsp;never allotted, ran to waste.@@<sup>19</sup> In all but a few
                districts&nbsp;of Italy the free population finally and completely disappeared from
                the open country ; and life and property&nbsp;λvere rendered insecure by the
                brigandage which now&nbsp;developed unchecked, and in which the herdsmen
                slaves&nbsp;played a prominent part. The outbreaks of Spartacus in&nbsp;73, and of
                Catiline ten years later, were significant commentaries on this part of Sulla’s
                    work.@@<sup>20</sup> His constitutional&nbsp;legislation, while it included many
                useful administrative&nbsp;reforms, is marked by as violent a spirit of
                partisanship,&nbsp;and as apparently wilful a blindness to the future.
