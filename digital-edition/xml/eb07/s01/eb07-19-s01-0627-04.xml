a circle in the Austrian province of the Upper Ens, extending over 330 square miles, and containing three market-towns and seventy-two villages, with 15,600 inhabitants. It is a most picturesque district, five sixths of the surface being covered with Alpine mountains, and watered by the romantic river Traun, issuing from the beautiful lake of that name, which was a favourite retreat of the late Sir Humphry Davy to enjoy fishing. The capital is the town of Ischl, where a large quantity of salt is refined.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
