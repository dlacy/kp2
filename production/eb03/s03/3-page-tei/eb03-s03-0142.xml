            <p>about its literal and grammatical ſignification. St Jerome, who translates it by Qui
                    <hi rend="italic">mittendus est,</hi> manifeſtly reads Shi<hi rend="italic"
                    >loach</hi> “ ſent,” inſtead of <hi rend="italic">Shiloh,</hi> The Septuagint
                have it <hi rend="smallcaps">F.jj∙</hi> a» eλ⅛n <hi rend="italic">τa a-ra×uμ(ytc
                    aυτω',</hi> or, Eως∙ <hi rend="italic">a∕ ι,λ,⅛n a a^o×fiτxι. </hi>(as iſ they
                had read l⅛w inſtead of n⅛w), <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> “ Until the coming of him
                to whom it is reſerved ;” or, “ Till we ſee arrive that which is reſerved for
                him.”</p>
            <p>It muſt be owned, that the signification of the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shiloh</hi> is not well known. Some tranſlate, “ thc ſceptre ſhall not depart
                from Judah, till he comes to whom it belongs ;” ∏<hi rend="superscript">l</hi>w or
                inſtead of I<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>?* '<hi rend="superscript">t,</hi> Others,
                “ till the coming of the peace-maker ;” or, “ the pacific ;” or, “ of prosperity,”
                    ∏bu<hi rend="superscript">,</hi>
                <hi rend="italic">proſperatus est. Shalah</hi> signifies, “ to be in peace, to be in
                proſperity ;” others, “ till the birth of him who ſhall be born of a woman that
                ſhall conceive without the knowledge of a man,” <hi rend="superscript">li</hi>' or
                    <hi rend="italic">ſecundina, fluxus@@</hi>; otherwiſe, “ the ſceptre ſhall not
                depart from Judah, till its end, its ruin ; till the downfal of the kingdom of the
                Jews,” ⅛κu' or rife- <hi rend="italic">it has ceased, it has finished</hi> @@*. Some
                Rabbins have taken the name <hi rend="italic">Siloh</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shiloh,</hi> as if it ſignified the city of this name in Paleſtine : “ The
                ſceptre ſhall not be taken away from Judah till it comes to Shiloh ; till it ſhall
                be taken from him to be given to Saul at Shiloh.” But in what part of Scripture is
                it ſaid, that Saul was acknowledged as king or conſecrated at Shiloh ? If we would
                understand it of Jeroboam the ſon of Nebat, the matter is ſtill as uncertain. The
                Scripture mentions no aſſembly at Shiloh that admitted him as king. A more modern
                author derives <hi rend="italic">Shiloh</hi> from ∏bu∙, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ſatigare,</hi> which ſometimes figniſies <hi rend="italic">to be weary, to
                    ſuffer ;</hi> “ till his labours, his ſufferings, his paſſion, ſhall
                happen.”</p>
            <p>But not to anruſe ourſelves about ſeeking out the grammatical ſignification of
                Shiloh, it is ſufficient for us to ſhow, that the ancient Jews are in this matter
                agreed with the Chriſtians : they acknowledge, that this word ſtands for the <hi
                    rend="italic">Messiah the King.</hi> It is thus that the paraphraſts Onkelos and
                Jonathan, that the ancient Hebrew commentaries upon Geneſis, and that the Talmudiſts
                themſelves, explain it. If Jeſus Chriſt and his apoſtles did not make uſe of this
                paſſage to prove the coming of the Meſſiah, it was becauſe then the completion of
                this prophecy was not ſufficiently manifeſt. The ſceptre ſtill continued among the
                Jews ; they had ſtill kings of their own nation in the perſons of the Herods ; but
                ſoon after the ſceptre was entirely taken away from them, and has never been
                reſtored to then ſince.</p>
            <p>The conceited Jews ſeek in vain to put forced meanings upon this prophecy of Jacob ;
                ſaying, for example, that the ſceptre intimates the dominion of ſtrangers, to which
                they have been in ſubjection, or the hope of feeing one day the ſceptre or ſupreme
                power settled again among themſelves. It is eaſy to perceive, that all this is
                contrived to deliver themſelves out of perplexity. In vain likewiſe they take refuge
                in certain princes of the captivity, whom they pretend to have ſubſiſted beyond the
                Euphrates, exerciſing an authority over their nation little differing from abſolute,
                and being of the race of David. This pretended ſucceſſion of princes is perfectly
                chimerical; and though at certain times they could ſhow a ſucceſſion, it continued
                but a ſhort time, and their authority was too obſcure, and too much limited, to be
                the object of a prophecy ſo remarkable as</p>
            <p>this was.</p>
            <p>SHINGLES, in building, ſmall pieces of wood, or quartered oaken boards, ſawn to a
                certain ſeantling, or, as is more uſual, cleft to about an inch thick at one end,
                and made like wedges, four or five inches broad, and eight or nine inches long.</p>
            <p>Shingles are uſed inſtead of tiles or ſlates, eſpecially for churches and ſteeples ;
                however, this covering is dear ; yet, where tiles are very ſcarce, and a light
                covering is required, it is preferable to thatch ; and where they are made of good
                oak, cleft, and not ſawed, and well ſeaſoned in water and the ſun, they make a ſure,
                light, and durable covering.</p>
            <p>The building is firſt to be covered all over with boards, and the ſhingles nailed
                upon them.</p>
            <p>SHIP, a general name for all large veſſels, particularly thoſe equipped with three
                mails and a bowſprit ; the maſts being compoſed of a lowermaſt, topmaſt, and
                top-gallant-maſt : each of theſe being provided with yards, ſails, &amp;c. Ships, in
                general, are either employed for war or merchandize.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Ships</hi><hi rend="italic"> oſ War</hi> are veſſels
                properly equipped with artillery, ammunition, and all the neceſſary martial weapons
                and inſtruments for attack or defence. They are diſtinguiſhed from each other by
                their ſeveral ranks or claſſes, called <hi rend="italic">rates,</hi> as follows :
                Ships of the firſt rate mount from 100 guns to no guns and upwards; ſecond rate,
                from 90 to 98 guns ; third rate, from 64 to 74 guns ; fourth rate, from 50 to 60
                guns ; fifth rate, from 32 to 44 guns; and ſixth rates, from 20 to 28 guns, See the
                article <hi rend="smallcaps">Rate.</hi> Veſſels carrying leſs than 20 guns are
                denominated sl<hi rend="italic">oops, cutters, fire-ships,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">bombs. </hi>It has lately been propoſed to reduce the number of
                theſe rates, which would be a ſaving to the nation, and also productive of ſeveral
                material advantages.</p>
            <p>In Plate CCCCL. is the repreſentation of a firſt rate, with rigging, &amp;c. the
                ſeveral parts of which are as follow :</p>
