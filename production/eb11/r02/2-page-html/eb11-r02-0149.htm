<p><span class="font1">each lobular bronchus is an irregular chamber, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">atrium </span><span class="font1">(fig. 6 At), and from this a number of thin-walled sacs, about&nbsp;i mm. in diameter, open&nbsp;out. These are called&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">infundibula</span><span class="font1"> (fig. 6 I),&nbsp;and their walls are&nbsp;pouched by hemispherical&nbsp;air-cells or alveoli like&nbsp;those in the lobular&nbsp;bronchi. Each lobular&nbsp;bronchus with its atrium&nbsp;and infundibula forms&nbsp;what is known as a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lobule&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of the lung, and these&nbsp;lobules are separated by&nbsp;connective tissue, and&nbsp;their outlines are evident&nbsp;on the surface of the lung.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The muscular tissue, which in the larger tubes was confined to the dorsal part, forms a complete layer in the smaller; but&nbsp;when the lobular bronchi are reached, it stops and the mucous&nbsp;membrane is surrounded by the elastic layer. In the lobular&nbsp;bronchi, too, the lining epithelium gradually changes from the&nbsp;ciliated to the stratified or pavement variety, and this is the&nbsp;only kind which is found in the infundibula and alveoli. Surrounding each alveolus is a plexus of capillary vessels so rich&nbsp;that the spaces between the capillaries are no wider than .the&nbsp;eapillaries themselves, and it is here that the exchange of gases&nbsp;takes place between the air and the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Embryology.—</span><span class="font1">The respiratory system is developed from the ventral surface of the forcgut as a long gutter-like pouch which&nbsp;reaches from just behind the rudiment of the tongue to thc&nbsp;stomach. Limiting the anterior or cephalic end of this is a&nbsp;Π-shaped elevation in the ventral wall of the pharynx which&nbsp;separates the ventral ends of the third and fourth visceral bars&nbsp;and is known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ùu: furcula*,</span><span class="font1"> it is from this that the epiglottis,&nbsp;aryteno-epiglottidean folds and arytenoid cartilages are developed.&nbsp;Later on the respiratory tube is separated from the digestive&nbsp;by two ridges, one on each side, which, uniting, form a transverse&nbsp;partition. In the region of the furcula, however, the partition&nbsp;stops and here the two tubes communicate. The caudal end&nbsp;of the respiratory tube buds out .into the two primary bronchi,&nbsp;and the right one of these, later on, bears three buds, while the&nbsp;left has only two; these are the secondary bronchi, which keep&nbsp;on dividing into two, one branch keeping the line of the parent&nbsp;stem to form thc stem bronchus, while the other goes off at an&nbsp;angle. By the repeated divisions of these tubes the complex&nbsp;“ bronchial tree ” is formed and from the terminal shoots the&nbsp;infundibula bud out. The alveoli only develop in the last three&nbsp;months of foetal life. The thyroid cartilage is probably formed&nbsp;from the fourth and fifth branchial bars, while the cricoid seems&nbsp;to be the enlarged first ring of the trachea. Before birth the&nbsp;lungs are solid and much less vascular than after breathing is&nbsp;established. Their slaty colour is gradually gained from the&nbsp;deposit of carbon from the atmosphere. (For further details&nbsp;see Quain’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anatomy,</span><span class="font1"> vol. i., Lond. 1908.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comparative Anatomy.—</span><span class="font1">It has been shown (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pharynx) </span><span class="font1">that in the lower vertebrates respiration is brought about by&nbsp;the blood vessels surrounding the gill clefts. In the higher&nbsp;fishes (Ganoids and Teleosteans) the “ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">swim bladder</span><span class="font1"> ” appears&nbsp;as a diverticulum from the dorsal wall of the alimentary canal,&nbsp;and its duct </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(d. pneumaticus)</span><span class="font1"> sometimes remains open and at&nbsp;others becomes a solid cord. In thc former case it is probable&nbsp;that the blood is to some extent oxidized in the vascular wall&nbsp;of this bladder. In the Dipnoi (mud-fish) the opening of the&nbsp;swim bladder shifts to the ventral side of the pharynx and the&nbsp;bladder walls become sacculated and very vascular, so that,&nbsp;when thc rivers are dried up, the fish can breathe altogether&nbsp;by means of it. In the S. American and African species of&nbsp;mud-fish the bladder or lung, as it may now be called, is divided&nbsp;by a longitudinal septum in its posterior (caudal) part into right&nbsp;and left halves. In this sub-class of Dipnoi, therefore, a general&nbsp;agreement is seen with the embryology or ontogeny of Man’s&nbsp;lungs. In the Amphibia the two lungs are quite separate though&nbsp;they are mere sacculated bags without bronchi. A trachea,&nbsp;however, appears in some species </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Siren) and a definite&nbsp;larynx with arytenoid cartilages, vocal cords and complicated&nbsp;muscles is established in the Anura (frogs and toads). In most&nbsp;of the Reptilia the bag-like lungs are elaborated into spongy&nbsp;organs with arborizing bronchi in their interior. From the&nbsp;crocodiles upward a main or stem bronchus passes to thc caudal&nbsp;end of the lung, and from this the branches or lateral bronchi&nbsp;come off. The larynx shows little advance on that of the Anura.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The respiratory organs of birds are highly specialized. The larynx is rudimentary, and sound is produced by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">syrinx,</span><span class="font1"> a&nbsp;secondary larynx at the bifurcation of thc trachea; this may&nbsp;be tracheal, bronchial or, most often, tracheo-branchial. The&nbsp;lungs are small and closely connected with the ribs, while from&nbsp;them numerous large air sacs extend among the viscera, muscles&nbsp;and into many of the bones, which, by being filled with hot air,&nbsp;help to maintain the high temperature and lessen the specific&nbsp;gravity of the body. This pneumaticity of the bones is to a&nbsp;certain extent reproduced by the air sinuses of the skull in&nbsp;crocodiles and mammals, and it must be pointed out that the&nbsp;amount of air fn the bones does not necessarily correspond with&nbsp;the power of flight, for the Ratitae (ostriches and emeus) have&nbsp;very pneumatic bones, while in the sea-gulls they are hardly&nbsp;pneumatic at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In mammals the thjToid cartilage becomes an important element in the larynx, and in the Echidna the’upper and lower&nbsp;parts of it, derived respectively from the fourth and fifth&nbsp;branchial bars, are separate (R. H. Burne, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Journ. Anat. and&nbsp;Phys,</span><span class="font1"> xxxviii. p. xxvii.). The whole larynx is much nearer the&nbsp;head than in Man, and in young animals the epiglottis is&nbsp;intra-narial, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> projects up behind the soft palate. This prevents the milk trickling into the larynx during suckling, and&nbsp;is especially well seen in the Marsupials and Cetacea, though&nbsp;evidences of it are present in the human embryo. In the lower&nbsp;mammals an inter-arytenoid cartilage is very frequent (see J.&nbsp;Symington, “The Marsupial Larynx,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">J. Anal, and Phys.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">xxxiii. 31, also “ The Monotreme Larynx,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ib.</span><span class="font1"> xxxiv. 90).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The lungs show a good deal of variation in their lobulation; among the porcupines as many as forty lobes have been counted&nbsp;in the right lung, while in other mammals no lobulation at all&nbsp;could be made out. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">azygous lobe</span><span class="font1"> of the right lung is a&nbsp;fairly constant structure and is situated between the post-caval&nbsp;vein and the oesophagus. It is supplied by the terminal branch&nbsp;of the right stem bronchus and, although it is usually absent in&nbsp;Man, the bronchus which should have supplied it is always to be&nbsp;found.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(F; G. P.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Physiology</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So far as is known, the intake of oxygen, either free or combined, and the output of carbon dioxide, are an essential part of the&nbsp;life of all organisms. The two processes are so closely associated&nbsp;with one another that they arc always included together under&nbsp;the designation of respiration, which may thus be defined as the&nbsp;physiological process which is concerned in the intake of oxygen&nbsp;and output of carbon dioxide. According to the evidence at&nbsp;present available, it is only within living cells that the respiratory&nbsp;oxygen is consumed and the carbon dioxide formed. Thc mere&nbsp;conveying of oxygen from the surrounding air or water to these&nbsp;cells, and of carbon dioxide from them to the air or water, is,&nbsp;however,'in itself a complex process in the higher animals; and&nbsp;accordingly an account of animal respiration naturally falls into&nbsp;two divisions, the first of which (I.) is concerned with the manner&nbsp;in which oxygen and carbon dioxide are conveyed to and from&nbsp;the living tissues, and the second (II.) with the consumption of&nbsp;oxygen and formation of carbon dioxide by the living tissues&nbsp;themselves..</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I. In all the more highly organized animals there are special respiratory organs: thc lungs in the higher vertebrates; the&nbsp;gills in fishes; lhe tracheae in insects; and various rudimentary&nbsp;forms of lungs or gills in other higher invertebrates.
