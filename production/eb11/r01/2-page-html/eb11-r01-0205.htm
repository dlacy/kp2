<p><span class="font2">He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, and was called to the bar at Gray’s Inn in 1886, and subsequently to the Irish&nbsp;bar, though he never practised. He was a clerk in the vote&nbsp;office of the House of Commons before he entered parliament&nbsp;in 1881 as member for New Ross. From 1885 to 1891 he&nbsp;represented North Wexford. As party whip he rendered great&nbsp;service to the Irish members by his thorough grasp of the&nbsp;procedure of the House. At the time of the rupture of the Irish&nbsp;party consequent on the Parnell scandals, Redmond was the&nbsp;most eloquent member of the minority who continued to&nbsp;recognize his leadership, and in 1891 he became the accredited&nbsp;leader of the Parnellites. In 1900 the two Nationalist parties&nbsp;were amalgamated under his leadership. He contested Cork&nbsp;unsuccessfully in 1891, but was elected for Waterford, where&nbsp;he was re-elected in 1906.

<p><span class="font2">REDON, a town of western France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Ille-et-Vilaine, 45 m. S.S.W. of Rennes by rail. Pop. (1906) 5170. Redon is situated on the&nbsp;right bank of the Vilaine, above the confluence of the Oust and&nbsp;on the canal from Nantes to Brest. The Church of St Sauveur,&nbsp;formerly belonging to an abbey, has a Romanesque central&nbsp;tower, square in form but with rounded angles. A fine tower&nbsp;of the 14th century with a stone spire stands isolated from the&nbsp;church, from which it was separated owing to the destruction&nbsp;of part of the nave by fire in 1782. The choir, with ambulatory&nbsp;and radiating chapels, forms one of the most remarkable&nbsp;examples of 13th-century architecture in Brittany. The abbey&nbsp;has been converted into an ecclesiastical college. Some 16th-century timbered houses have interesting carvings. The&nbsp;industries include the manufacture of emery and polish, agri-cultural implements and boat-building, tanning, brewing and&nbsp;flour-milling. The port is accessible at high tides for vessels&nbsp;of 600 to 700 tons. Redon grew up round a monastery founded&nbsp;in the first half of the 9th century. In the 14th century Jean&nbsp;de Tréal, one of the abbots, surrounded the town with walls,&nbsp;of which a remnant is still to be seen. </span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REDONDA, an island in the British West Indies. It is a dependency of Antigua, and lies 25 m. S.W. of it, in 25° 6' N.&nbsp;and 61° 35' W. Pop. (1901) 120. It is a rocky mountain,&nbsp;rising abruptly from the sea to a height of 1000 ft., and&nbsp;has an area of ½ sq. m. It is valuable for its phosphate of&nbsp;alumina (discovered in 1865), of which 7000 tons are exported&nbsp;every year to the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REDONDELA, a town of north-western Spain, in the province of Pontevedra; 7 m. N.E. of Vigo, in a bend of the Vigo estuary, and at the junction of the Tuy-Vigo and Vigo-Ponte-vedra railways. Pop. (1900) 10,843. The river is only accessible for small coasting vessels; it is the headquarters of a&nbsp;prosperous fishing industry. In the neighbourhood are ruins&nbsp;of several medieval castles, and the fine hall of the Marquess&nbsp;Vega de Armijo.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RED RIVER, the name of two American rivers, one emptying into the Mississippi near its mouth, and the other emptying into&nbsp;Lake Winnipeg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. The Red river, sometimes called the Red River of Louisiana, is the southernmost of the large tributaries of the&nbsp;Mississippi. It rises in northern Texas, in the northern part&nbsp;of the Staked Plains, or Llano Estacado, flows E. by S. in Texas,&nbsp;between Texas and Oklahoma, and to Fulton, in south-western&nbsp;Arkansas, there turns S.E. and continues in a general south-easterly direction through Louisiana to the bank of the Mississippi,&nbsp;where it discharges partly into the Mississippi and partly into&nbsp;the Atchafalaya. Its length is estimated at 1200 m. or more;&nbsp;its drainage basin has an area of at least 90,000 sq. m.; and its&nbsp;discharge ranges from 3500 cub. ft. to 180,000 cub. ft. per second.&nbsp;It is somewhat saline in its upper course, and in its middle and&nbsp;lower course is laden with a reddish silt from which it takes its&nbsp;name. From an elevation on the Staked Plains of about&nbsp;2450 ft., the river plunges into a canyon which is about 60 m.&nbsp;long and has nearly perpendicular walls of sandstone and&nbsp;gypsum formation 500 to 800 ft. high. Immediately below the&nbsp;canyon the river spreads out over a broad and sandy bed and&nbsp;flows for about 500 m. through a semi-arid plain. It narrows&nbsp;on entering the alluvial bottom lands, through which it pursues&nbsp;a sluggish and meandering course for the last 600 m. At high&nbsp;stages, from December to June, it is continually shifting its&nbsp;channel in this part of its course, by eroding one bank and&nbsp;making deposits on the other, and as the upper portion is densely&nbsp;wooded the falling trees, unless removed, become an obstruction&nbsp;to navigation. In 1828 the trees which the river had felled&nbsp;formed the great “Red River raft” extending from Loggy&nbsp;Bayou, 65 m. below Shreveport, Louisiana, to Hurricane&nbsp;Bluffs, 27 m. above Shreveport. Congress began in that year&nbsp;to make appropriations for the removal of the raft, and by 1841&nbsp;Henry M. Shreve had opened a channel. The river was neglected&nbsp;from 1857 to 1872 and another raft, 32 m. in length, formed above&nbsp;Shreveport. A channel was opened through this in 1872-73,&nbsp;and the complete removal of the obstruction a few years later&nbsp;so improved the drainage that a large tract of waste land was&nbsp;reclaimed. In its course through Louisiana the river has built&nbsp;up a flood-plain with silt deposits more rapidly than its tributaries, with the result that numerous lakes and bayous have&nbsp;been formed on either side, and Cypress Bayou was so flooded&nbsp;that boats plied between Shreveport, Louisiana and Jefferson,&nbsp;Texas, 45 m. apart; but with the improvement of the river these&nbsp;lakes have become shallow or dry. For the improvement of&nbsp;navigation here not only the removal of snags is necessary, but&nbsp;there must be dredging, closure of outlets, building of levees to&nbsp;narrow and deepen the channel, and revetment works to protect&nbsp;the banks. The cost of these works has been great (up to July&nbsp;1909 more than $2,360,000 below Fulton, Arkansas, and more&nbsp;than $215,000 above Fulton), but they Have rendered the river&nbsp;navigable, except at very low stages, by vessels drawing 3 ft. of&nbsp;water from its mouth to Fulton, Arkansas, a distance of 508·6 m.,&nbsp;and at the highest stages,<sup>1</sup> in March and April, it is navigable&nbsp;to Denison, Texas, 292 m. farther up. The Ouachita and&nbsp;Black (one river), which is the principal tributary of tbe Red,&nbsp;joins it near its mouth and is navigable at high stages to Arkadelphia, Arkansas; and in 1910 a system of nine locks with&nbsp;movable dams was under construction by the Federal government for the purpose of securing a channel 6½ ft. deep at all&nbsp;stages to a point 10 m. above Camden, Arkansas, a distance of&nbsp;360 m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the Civil War, in March and April 1864, Major-General Nathaniel P. Banks conducted a combined military and naval&nbsp;expedition up the Red river in an attempt to open a Federal&nbsp;highway to Texas, but on the 8th of April the vanguard of his&nbsp;army was repulsed with heavy loss at Sabine Cross-Roads by&nbsp;the Confederates under Lieutenant-General Richard Taylor&nbsp;and the expedition was abandoned; the gunboats commanded&nbsp;by D. D. Porter were held above Alexandria by the lowness of&nbsp;the river, but it was flooded by a hurriedly built dam, and they&nbsp;escaped.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font0">See R.
