                praetor, the urban or praetorian&nbsp;prefect, a provincial governor, or the emperor
                himself—at his own&nbsp;hand pronounced a decree that as far as possible restored

                ante.</span><span class="font0"> It was not enough, however, to entitle a man to
                this&nbsp;extraordinary relief, that he was able to show that he had been&nbsp;taken
                advantage of to his hurt, and that no other adequate means&nbsp;of redress was open
                to him ; he required in addition to be able to&nbsp;found on some subjective ground

        <p><span class="font1">the time of Diocletian downwards the making of the law was
                exclusively in the hands of the emperors. The senate&nbsp;still existed, but shorn
                of all its old functions alike of&nbsp;government and legislation. The responses of
                patented&nbsp;jurists were a thing of the past. It was to the
                imperial&nbsp;consistory alone that men looked for interpretation of old&nbsp;law or
                promulgation of new.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">In the reign of Diocletian rescripts were still abundant; but the

                class="font0"> The reason&nbsp;why so few are preserved is that they were no longer
                authoritative&nbsp;except for the parties to whom they were addressed. This
                was&nbsp;expressly declared by the emperors Arcadius and Honorius in 398&nbsp;in
                reference to those in answer to applications for advice from&nbsp;officials ; and it
                is not unreasonable to assume that a limitation of&nbsp;the same sort had been put
                at an earlier date on the authority of&nbsp;those addressed to private parties.
                Puchta is of opinion that the&nbsp;enactment of Honorius and Arcadius applied
                equally to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >decreta,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">for the reason that during this period
                matters of litigation did&nbsp;not come under the cognizance of the emperors except
                on appeal,&nbsp;and that under the new arrangements of Constantine the judgment of
                affirmance or reversal was embodied in a rescript addressed to the magistrate from
                whom the appeal had been taken.&nbsp;The rule of Arcadius and Honorius was renewed
                in 425 by Theodosius and Valentinian, who qualified it, however, to this
                extent,—&nbsp;that, if it contained any distinct indication that the doctrine it
                laid&nbsp;down was meant to be of general application, then it was to
                be&nbsp;received as an edict or </span><span class="font0"

                Justinian adhered&nbsp;in so far as rescripts in the old sense of the word were
                concerned ;&nbsp;but he declared that his judgments </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">(decreta)</span><span class="font0"> should be

        <p><span class="font0">the petition of a private party. The imperial edicts, adjusted in the
                consistory, were usually addressed to the people, the senate, or&nbsp;some official,
                civil, military, or ecclesiastical, according to the nature&nbsp;of their
                subject-matter.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Establishment of Christianity as the State
                    Religion@@<sup>2</sup> —</span><span class="font0">A disposition has sometimes
                been manifested to credit nascent Christianity with the humaner spirit which began
                to operate on some of the&nbsp;institutions of the law in the first century of the
                empire, but which&nbsp;in a previous section we have ascribed to the infiltration
                into the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile
                of</span><span class="font0"> doctrines of thejwa </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">naturale,</span><span class="font0"> the product of the
                philosophy of the Stoa. The teaching of Seneca did quite as much—&nbsp;nay far
                more—to influence it then than the lessons that were&nbsp;taught in the little
                assemblies of the early converts. It would be&nbsp;a bold thing to say that, had
                Christianity never gained its predominance, that spirit of natural right would not
                have continued&nbsp;to animate the course of legislation, and to evoke, as years
                progressed, most of those amendments in the law of the family and&nbsp;the law of
                succession that were amongst the most valuable contributions of the imperial
                constitutions to the private law. It may well&nbsp;be that that spirit was
                intensified and rendered more active with&nbsp;the growth of Christian belief; but
                not until the latter had been&nbsp;publicly sanctioned by Constantine, and by
                Theodosius declared to&nbsp;be the religion of the state, do we meet with
                incontestable records&nbsp;of its influence. We find them in enactments in favour of
                the&nbsp;church and its property, and of its privileges as a legatee ; in
                those&nbsp;conferring or imposing on the bishops a supervision of charities&nbsp;and
                charitable institutions, and a power of interfering in matters&nbsp;of guardianship
                ; in the recognition of the efficacy of certain acts&nbsp;done in presence of two or
                three of the clergy and thereafter recorded in the church registers ; in the
                disabilities as to marriage&nbsp;and succession with which heretics and apostates
                were visited, and&nbsp;in a variety of minor matters. Of greater importance were
                three&nbsp;features for which it was directly responsible,—the repeal of
                the&nbsp;caduciary provisions of the Papia-Poppsean law, the penalties imposed upon
                divorce, and the institution of the </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">episcopalis audientia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The purpose of the caduciary law was to discourage celibacy and
                encourage fruitful marriages ; but legislation in such a spirit could&nbsp;not
                possibly be maintained when celibacy had come to be inculcated&nbsp;as a virtue, and
                as the peculiar characteristic of a holy life. The&nbsp;penalties alike of
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">orbitas</span><span
                class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >coelibatus</span><span class="font0"> were abolished by Constantine in the year
                320. The legislation about divorce, from the first&nbsp;of Constantine’s enactments
                on the subject down to those of Justinian, forms a miserable chapter in the history
                of the law. Not one&nbsp;of the emperors who busied himself with the matter, undoing
                the&nbsp;work of his predecessors and substituting legislation of his own
                quite&nbsp;as complicated and futile, thought of interfering with the old principle
                that divorce ought to be as free as marriage and independent&nbsp;of the sanction or
                decree of a judicial tribunal. Justinian was the&nbsp;first who, by one of his
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Novels,</span><span
                class="font0"> imposed a condition on parties to&nbsp;a divorce of common accord
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(communi
                consensu),</span><span class="font0"> namely, that they&nbsp;should both enter a
                convent, otherwise it should be null ; but, so&nbsp;distasteful was this to popular
                feeling, and so little conducive to&nbsp;improvement of the tone of morals within
                the conventual precincts,&nbsp;that it was repealed by his successor. The
                legislation of Justinian’s&nbsp;predecessors and the bulk of his own were levelled
                at one-sided repudiations, imposing penalties, personal and patrimonial (1)
                upon&nbsp;the author of a repudiation on some ground the law did not recognize as
                sufficient—and the lawful grounds varied from reign to reign&nbsp;—and (2) upon the
                party whose misconduct gave rise to a repudiation that was justifiable. The bishop’s
                court </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(episcopate
                judicium,&nbsp;episcopalis audientia)</span><span class="font0"> had its origin in
                the practice of the primitive&nbsp;Christians, in accordance with the apostolic
                precept, of submitting&nbsp;their differences to one or two of their brethren in the
                faith, usually a presbyter or bishop, who acted as arbiter. On the establishment of
                Christianity the practice obtained legislative sanction,&nbsp;Constantine giving the
                bishop’s court concurrent jurisdiction with&nbsp;the ordinary civil courts where
                both parties preferred the former,&nbsp;and by a later enactment going so far as to
                empower one of the&nbsp;parties to a suit to remove it to the ecclesiastical
                tribunal against&nbsp;the will of the other. For various reasons, advantage was
                taken of&nbsp;this power of resorting to the bishop to an extent which
                seriously&nbsp;interfered with the proper discharge of his spiritual functions,
                so&nbsp;that Honorius judged it expedient to revert to the original rule,&nbsp;and,
                at least as regarded laymen, to limit the right of resort to&nbsp;the episcopal
                judicatory to cases in which both parties consented.&nbsp;It is impossible to say
                with any approach to exactitude what effect&nbsp;this intervention of the clergy as
                judges in ordinary civil causes—&nbsp;for they had no criminal jurisdiction—had on
                the development of&nbsp;the law. But it can hardly have been without some influence
                in&nbsp;still further promoting the tendency to subordinate act and word&nbsp;to
                will and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">animus,</span><span
