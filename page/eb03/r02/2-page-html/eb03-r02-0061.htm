<p><span class="font1">tides lying âbout E are treated in the ſame way, and, tumbling over the ridge B, cover the firſt particle, and&nbsp;now protect it effectually from any further diſturbance.&nbsp;The ſame operation is going on at the bottom of each&nbsp;ridge. The brow or ſteep of the ridge gradually advances down the ſtream, and the whole ſet change their&nbsp;places, as repreſented by the dotted line </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">adbſ;</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;after a certain time the particle which was depo-ſited at F is found in an unprotected ſituation, as it&nbsp;was in E, and it now makes another ſtep down the&nbsp;ſtream.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Abbé Boſſut found, that when the velocity of the ſtream was juſt ſufficient for lifting the fand (and a&nbsp;ſmall exceſs hindered this operation altogether) a ridge&nbsp;advanced about 20 feet in a day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Since the current carries off the moſt moveable matters of the channel, it leaves the bottom covered with the remaining coarſer fand, gravel, pebbles, and larger&nbsp;ſtones. To theſe are added many which come down&nbsp;the ſtream while it is more rapid, and alſo many which&nbsp;roll in from the ſides as the banks wear away. All&nbsp;theſe form a bottom much more ſolid and immoveable&nbsp;than a bottom of the medium foil would have been.&nbsp;But this does not always maintain the channel in a permanent form ; but frequently occaſions great changes,&nbsp;by obliging the current, in the event of any ſudden freſh&nbsp;or ſwell, to enlarge its bed, and even to change it altogether, by working to the right and to the leſt, ſince&nbsp;it cannot work downwards. It is generally from ſuch&nbsp;accumulation of gravel and pebbles in the bottom of the&nbsp;bed that rivers change their channels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It remains to aſcertain, in abſolute meaſures, the force which a current really exerts in attempting to drag&nbsp;along with it the materials of its channel ; and which&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">will</span><span class="font1"> produce this effect unleſs refilled by the inertia of&nbsp;theſe materials. It is therefore of practical importance to know this force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nor is it abſtruſe or difficult. For when a current is in train, the accelerating force is in equilibrio with&nbsp;the reſiſtance, and is therefore its immediate meaſure.&nbsp;Now this accelerating force is preciſely equal to the&nbsp;weight of the body of water in motion multiplied by&nbsp;the fraction which expreſſes the ſlope. The mean depth&nbsp;being equal to the quotient of the ſection divided by&nbsp;the border, the ſection is equal to the product of the&nbsp;mean depth multiplied by the border. Therefore, calling the border </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font1"> and the mean depth </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cl,</span><span class="font1"> we have the&nbsp;ſection </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">— db.</span><span class="font1"> The body of water in· motion is therefore </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">db </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">j∙ (becauſe r was the ſlant length of a part&nbsp;whoſe difference of elevation is 1), and the accelerating&nbsp;force is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">db s × —,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">db.</span><span class="font1"> But if we would only conſi-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">der this reſiſtance as correſponding to an unit of the length of the channel, we muſt divide the quantity </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d b</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">db</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">by j, and the reſiſtance is then —. And if we would </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">s</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">conſider the reſiſtance only for an unit of the border, we muſt divide this expreſſion by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1"> ; and thus this reſiſtance (taking an inch for the unit) will be expreſſed&nbsp;•for one ſquare inch of the bed by the weight of a&nbsp;bulk of water which has a ſquare inch for its baie, and&nbsp;J . <sub>1</sub> .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">- for its height. And laſtly, if E be taken for any given ſuperſicial extent of the channel or bed, and F the</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Thus, let it be required to determine in pounds the reſiſtance or friction on a ſquare yard of a channel&nbsp;whoſe current is in train, which is 10 feet wide, four&nbsp;feet deep, and has a ſlope of one foot in a mile. Here&nbsp;E is nine feet. Ten feet width and four feet depth give&nbsp;a ſection of 40 feet. The border is 18 feet. There-</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ÿ 3. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Settlement of the Beds of Rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">He who looks with a careleſs eye at a map of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font1">world, is apt to conſider the rivers which ramble over&nbsp;its ſurface as a chance-medley diſpoſition of the drainers&nbsp;which carry off the waters. But it will afford a moſt&nbsp;•agreeable object to a conſiderate and contemplative&nbsp;mind, to take it up in this very ſimple light ; and having&nbsp;conſidered the many ways in which the drenched ſurface might have been cleared of the ſuperfluous waters, to&nbsp;attend particularly to the very way which nature has&nbsp;followed. In following the troubled waters of a mountain torrent, or the pure ſtreams which trickle from&nbsp;their baſes, till he fees them ſwallowed up in the ocean,&nbsp;and in attending to the many varieties in their motions,&nbsp;he wilRbe delighted with obſerving how the ſimple laws&nbsp;of mechaniſm are made ſo fruitful in good conſequences,&nbsp;both by modifying the motions of the waters them-ſelves, and alſo by inducing new forms onthe ſurface&nbsp;of the earth, fitted for re-acting on the waters, and producing theſe very modifications of their motions which&nbsp;render them ſo beneficial. The permanent beds of rivers are by no means fortuitous gutters haſtily ſcooped&nbsp;out by daſhing torrents ; but both they and the vallevs&nbsp;through which they flow are the patient but unceaſing&nbsp;labours of nature, prompted by goodneſs and directed&nbsp;by wiſdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Whether we trace a river from the torrents which</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font1">collect the ſuperfluous waters of heaven, or from the&nbsp;ſprings which diſcharge what would otherwiſe be condemned to perpetual inactivity, each feeder is but a&nbsp;little rill which could not ramble far from its ſcanty&nbsp;ſource among growing plants ami* abſorbent earth,&nbsp;without being fucked up and evaporated, did it not&nbsp;meet with other rills in its courſe. When united they&nbsp;form a body of water ſtill inconſiderable, but much&nbsp;more able, by its bulk, to overcome the little obſtacles&nbsp;to its motion ; and the rivulet then moves with greater&nbsp;ſpeed, as we have now learned. At the ſame time, the&nbsp;ſurface expoſed to evaporation and abſorption is dimi-niſhed by the union of the riils. Four equal rills have&nbsp;only the ſurface of two when united. Thus the portion which eſcapes arreſtment, and travels downward,&nbsp;is continually increaſing. This is a happy adjuſtment-to the other operations of nature. Were it otherwiſe,&nbsp;the lower and more valuable countries would be loaded&nbsp;wu'th the paſſing waters in addition to their own fur-'&nbsp;plus rains, and the immediate neighbourhood of the ſea&nbsp;would be almoſt covered by the drains of the interior</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
