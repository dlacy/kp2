a town of the kingdom of Hanover, in the pro vince of Bremen, of which province it is the capital. It stands on the river Schwinge, which falls into the Elbe about one mile below the town, whence large vessels must load and discharge by the aid of river craft. Stade, which was once fortified, contains the provincial courts of law and boards of administration. It contains 5350 inhabitants, who are occupied as brewers, distillers, manufacturers of coarse woollen and hosiery, and in equipping ships for the whale fishery. Opposite the town a Hanoverian ship of war is stationed, which collects a small toll on each vessel that passes upwards to Hamburg or Altona. Lat. 53. 36. 5. Long. 9. 18. 10.
