They were frequently repulſed'into their native wilds, but they as certainly returned with freſh rage and increaſed ferocity. The Goths and Vandals, finding the emperor engaged in quelling domeſtic diſputes, renewed their accuſtomed inroads, and once more felt the puniſhment of their preſumptions. They were conquered in ſeveral engagements ; and Probus returned in triumph to Rome. His active temper, however, would not ſuffer him to continue at reſt whilſt a ſingle enemy was left to conquer. In his laſt expedition he led his ſoldiers againſt the Perſians ; and going through Sirmium, the place of his nativity, he there employed ſeveral thouſands of his ſoldiers in draining a fen that was incommodious to the inhabitants. The fatigues of this undertaking, and the great reſtraint that was laid upon the ſoldiers licentious manners, produced a conſpiracy, which ended in his ruin : for taking the opportunity as he was marching into Greece, they ſet upon and flew him after he had reigned ſix years and four months with general approbation.</p><p>Carus, who was prætorian prefect to the deceaſed emperor, was choſen by the army to ſucceed him; and he, to ſtrengthen his authority, named his two ſons Carinus and Numerianus with him in command ; the former of whom was as much ſullied by his vices, as the youngeſt was virtuous, modeſt, and courageous. The new emperor had ſcarce time to puniſh the murderers of the late monarch, when he was alarmed by a freſh irruption of the Sarmatians ; over whom he gained a ſignal victory. The Perſian monarch alſo made ſome attempts upon the empire ; but Carus aſſured his ambaſſadors, that if their maſter perſiſted in his obſtinacy, all his fields ſhould ſhortly be as bare as his own bald head, which he ſhowed them. In conſequence of this threat, he n,arched to the very walls of Cteſiphon, and a dreadful battle enſuing, he once more gained a complete victory. What the reſult of this ſucceſs might have been, is not known ; for he was ſhortly after ſtruck dead by lightning in his tent, with many .others that were round him. Numerianus, the youngeſt ſon, who accompanied his father in this expedition, was inconſolable for his death; and brought ſuch a diſorder upon his eyes with weeping, that he was obliged to be carried along with the army, ſhut up in a cloſe litter. The peculiarity of his ſituation, after ſome time, excited the ambition of Aper, his father-in-law, who ſuppoſed that he could now, without any great danger, aim at the empire himſelf. He therefore hired a mercenary villain to murder the emperor in his litter ; and the better to conceal the fact, gave out that he was ſtill alive, but unable to endure the light. In this manner was the dead body carried about for ſome days, Aper continuing to attend it with the utmoſt appearance of reſpect, and to take orders as uſual. The offenſiveneſs, however, of its ſmell at length diſcovered the treachery, and excited an univerſal uproar throughout the army. In the midſt of this tumult, Diocleſian, one of the moſt noted commanders of his time, was choſen emperor, 3nd with his own hand flew Aper ; having thus, as it is ſaid, fulfilled a prophecy, which had ſaid, that Dio-eleſian ſhould be emperor after he had ſlain*a boar ; alluding to the name of his rival, which ſigniſies· a boar. Garinus, the remaining ſon, did not long ſurvive hie fa,ther and. brother j for giving himſelf up" to his vices, and yet at the ſame time oppoſing the new-made emperor, the competitors led their forces into Mæfia ; where Diocleſian being victorious, Carinus was ſlain by a tribune of his own army, whoſe wife he had formerly abuſed.</p><p>Diocleſian was a perſon of mean birth ; being accounted, according to ſome, the ſon of a ſcrivener ; and of a ſlave, according to others. He received his name from Dioclea, H.e town in which he was born ; and was about 40 years old when he was elected to the empire. He pardoned all who had joined Carinus, without injuring either their fortunes or honours. Conſcious alſo that the weight of empire was too heavy for one alone to ſuſtain, he took in Maximian, his general, as a partner in the fatigues of duty, making him his equal and companion on the throne. Thus mutually aſſiſting each other, theſe two continued to live in ſtrict friendſhip ; and though ſomewhat differing in temper (as Maximian was rather.aman of vicious inclinations), yet they concurred in promoting the general good, and humbling their enemies- And it muſt be obſerved, that there never was a period in which there were more numerous or formidable enemies to oppoſe.</p><p>The peafants and labourers in Gaul made a dangerous inſurrection, under the conduct of Amandus and Helianus, but were ſubdued by Maximian. Achilleus, who commanded in Egypt, proclaimed himſelf emperor ; and it was not without many bloody engagements that he was overcome, and condemned by Diocleſian to be devoured by lions. In Africa, the Roτ man legions, in like manner, joined with many of the natives, ſeized upon the public revenues, and plundered thoſe who continued in their duty. Theſe were alſo ſubdued by Maximian ; and, after a long dubious war<hi rend="sub">r </hi>conſtrained to ſue for peace. About the ſame time, a. principal commander in Britain, named<hi rend="italic">Carattjius,</hi>  proclaimed himſelf emperor, and poſſeſſed himſelf of the iſland. To oppoſe this general’s claims, Maximianmade choice of Conſtantius Chlorus, whom he created: Cæſar, and married to Theodora his daughter-in-law. He, upon his arrival in Britain, finding Carauſius very ſtrong, and continually reinforced from Germany,, thought proper to come to an accommodation ; io that this uſurper continued for ſeven years in quiet poſſeſſion of the whole iſland, till he was ſlain by Alectus, his friend and intimate. About this time alſo, Narſes, king of Perſia, began a dangerous war upon the empire, and invaded Meſopotamia. To ſtop the progreſs of the enemy upon this quarter, Diocleſian made choice of Ga-lerius (ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">Armentarius,</hi>  from the report of his being born of a cow-herd in Dacia) ; and he likewiſe was created Cæſar. His ſucceſs alſo, though very, doubtful in the beginning, was in the end terminated according to his wiſhes. The Perſians were overcome in a deciſive engagement, their camp plundered and ta, ken, and their king’s wives and children made priſoners of war. There only remained, of all the enemies of the Roman empire, thoſe who lay to the northward un? ſubdued. Theſe were utterly unconquerable, as well upon account of their ſavage fierceneſs, as the inholpi-table ſeverity of the climate and ſoil ſrom whence they iſſued. Ever at war with the Romans, they iſſued forth, when the armies that were to repreſs their inva-fions were called away ; and upon their return, they as ſuddenly withdrew into cαld<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  barren, and inacceſſible</p></body></text></TEI>
