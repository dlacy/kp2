No prohibition is laid by any of the states on the import, export, or transit of any article ; but each canton maintains the right to stipulate the conditions of ingress and egress, and the transport of merchandise is necessarily impeded by the collection of tolls at the different frontiers. Many attempts have been made by the most intelligent merchants to equalize the transit- duty, and to remove the charges and embarrassments of so many local administrations, by some general plan ; but as the tolls are one of the main sources of local revenue, the cantons have been unwilling to abandon them for any national and general object.A very considerable amount of trade is carried on between France and Switzerland, the frontier territory being extensive, the language in those districts identical, and the customs of the adjacent provinces substantially the same. On an average of fourteen years the annual imports into France from Switzerland amount to L.454,345, the annual exports from France to Switzerland to L.1,094,554. The principal articles imported from France are wine, oil, madder, brandy, alcohol, salt, fruit, sugar, coffee, and colonial produce, silk, woollen, and cotton manufactures, and articles of fashion in great variety. There is no duty, except a nominal one, on any of these articles, while France receives from Switzerland some horned cattle and cheese, both of which pay enormous duties ; and ribbands, linens, and threads, all subject to large custom-house imposts. There is also a considerable export of watches and jewellery, which is principally in the hands of contraband traders. The unfriendly and hostile tariff of France has naturally produced much discontent in Switzerland, while it is a notorious fact, that the protection afforded to French manufactures, by highly raised or prohibitory tariffs, has not produced its intended results; that no manufacturing industry has suffered such violent shocks, or seen such terrible reverses, as the industry of France.The Prussian commercial league caused at its origin a considerable alarm, and appeared to menace Switzerland with a serious reduction of exports to Germany. But time and experience have diminished these apprehensions.The imports from England are cast iron, steel, pewter, tin, fine hard ware, a small quantity of printed cottons, woollen stuffs, tea, pottery, India and China silk, dyeing ingredients, and colonial productions, when they are cheaper in England than in the continental ports of Europe. Switzerland, on the other hand, furnishes very few articles to England ; and these principally consist of embroidered muslins, Turkey-red calicoes, and a few printed goods upon the same red ground.After the peace of 1815, the Swiss merchants, finding themselves precluded, by the prohibitive system, from almost the whole of the European markets, directed their attention to the United States of America, and gradually extended their relations with the southern parts of that continent. Throughout the whole of that hemisphere, the consumption of their manufactures has increased from year to year. Besides this new market for the sale of their goods, they have made some experiments in the East Indies, and these have now acquired some importance. They have likewise a few consumers in the states of Barbary, Egypt, Illyria, Greece, Turkey, and Persia.The Swiss cantons which are the most distinguished for their wealth and industry, and for tlieir general prosperity, are Zürich, Basel, Geneva, St Gall, Neuchâtel, Appenzell, and Aargau. The canton of Appenzell has manufactories of muslins, cottons, and silks, and receives a considerable quantity of cotton yarns from England. Neuchâtel exports con-</p><p>The constitutions of the twenty-two cantons may be ranged into three classes. The first class is that of the pure democracies, consisting of the old mountain cantons, Scliwytz, Uri, Unterwalden, Glaris, Zug, and Appenzell. To these may be added the Grisons and the Valais, which at first were only allies of the Swiss, but are now integral parts of the confederation. The second class of cantons consists of those in which aristocratic privileges had been enjoyed for centuries by the principal town of the canton. These cantons are Zürich, Berne, Freyburg, Soleure, Lucerne, Basel, and Schaffhausen ; but their constitutions underwent a thorough change in 1830, and the country districts were then admitted to the enjoyment of equal privileges with the towns. The third class is that of the new cantons formed since 1803, out of the former bailiwicks ; namely, Aargau, Thurgau, Vaud, Ticino, and St Gall. The constitutions of these cantons were also rendered more popular in 1830, and framed on the principle of equality of rights among all classes of the citizens. Two cantons have not been enumerated in any of the above classes, Geneva and Neuchâtel. Tlie institutions of the former at one time resembled those of the aristocratic cantons, but they have now been established on a popular basis. The latter is a constitutional monarchy, of which the king of Prussia is prince. In the representative cantons of Berne, Lucerne, Aargau, Ticino, and Geneva, a property qualification is required for members of the legislature.</p><p>The different branches of agriculture are well understood in Switzerland. The extent and fertility of the pastures are favourable to the breeding of cattle. The oxen are remarkable for their size ; and the cows, particularly the short-horned breed in the valleys of Gruyères, are much prized in different countries. The horses are strong and hardy, but the mule is the most common beast of burden in the mountains. The central and south-eastern cantons are chiefly dependent on their agricultural productions.</p><p>The commercial relations of Switzerland are of great importance, and her manufactures have gradually forced their way into all the markets of the world, however remote or seemingly inaccessible. This result is the more remarkable, as Switzerland neitlier produces the raw material which she manufactures, nor, when manufactured, has she any port of outlet, except on such conditions as her maritime neighbours impose upon her ; and yet, in spite of these obstacles, her progress has been almost unexampled in manufacturing prosperity. Capital is rapidly increasing, through the influence of unrestricted industry. Activity is everywhere visible both in the trading and the agricultural districts. Wages are comparatively low in many of the departments of industry, the necessary result of the general cheapness of most of the articles of consumption ; a cheapness which again is the cause and consequence of the free egress and ingress of all commodities. The land is for the most part released from tithes and taxes, and the people subject to very trifling fiscal burthens. The great secret of the commercial prosperity of Switzerland is,—industry has been left to itself. Capital has not been diverted by legislative interference from its natural tendencies. The consumer has been allowed to go to the cheapest market, the producer to the dearest ; and the present position and prospects of Swiss industry furnish abundant evidence of the wisdom of this policy. The prohibitory system adopted by the surrounding states excited at first some alarm among the manufacturers of Switzerland ; but their anxieties on this subject have now ceased, and the narrow policy of their neighbours has only had the effect of forcing the Swiss into a wider and more profitable field, which they have been able successfully to explore to the extent of their capitals and their means of production. Many of the manufacturers, who had formerly been strenuous advocates for heavy custom-house duties on foreign articles,</p></body></text></TEI>
