The magiſtrates and officers of thc city are all Proteſtants ; and it is to be remarked, that although there are&nbsp;about 2 2 Catholic churches, yet there are very few Catholic citizens, the magiſtracy not allowing the freedom&nbsp;of the town to be given to Catholics living there. As&nbsp;this city is large,.elegant, and full of magnificent houſes,-it has been choſen many years for the place of holding&nbsp;the diet, upon account of the conveniency, to many&nbsp;neighbouring princes and ſtates, of ι<sup>f</sup>ending their provi-ſions by land and water,■ without great expence. The&nbsp;town-houſe, in the hall of which the Diet meets, is&nbsp;extremely magnificent. In the year 1740, however,&nbsp;when there was a war in Germany, the Diet met at&nbsp;Frankfort on the Main, till after the death of the emperor Charles VII. Proviſions are very plentiful at&nbsp;Ratiſhon in time of peace. The inhabitants have a&nbsp;good deal of trade, the river on which it ſtands being&nbsp;navigable, and communicating with a great part of Germany. lt is 55 miles ſouth-eaſt of Nuremberg, 62&nbsp;north of Munich, and 1 95 weſt of vienna.

The houſes were all of wood, the communication&nbsp;by bridges and boats, and the town kept fweet and clean&nbsp;by the tides carrying away the mud and foil, (Strabo).&nbsp;Anciently it had a port at the mouth of the Bedeſis ;&nbsp;Auguſtus added a new port, capacious to hold a fleet,&nbsp;for the ſecurity of the Adriatic, between which and the&nbsp;city lay the via Cæfaris.
