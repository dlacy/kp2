an Engliſh ſilver coin, equal to twelve pence, or the twentieth part of a pound.</p><p>Freherus derives the Saxon sch <hi rend="italic">illing,</hi> whence our ſhilling, from a corruption of si <hi rend="italic">liqua ;</hi> proving the derivation by ſeveral texts of law, and, among others, by the 26th law, <hi rend="italic">De annuis legatis.</hi> Skinner deduces it from the Saxon scild “ ſhield,” by reaſon of the eſcutcheon of arms thereon.</p><p>Biſhop Hooper derives it from the Arabic sc <hi rend="italic">hecle,</hi> ſignifying <hi rend="italic">a weight ;</hi> but others, with greater probability, deduce it from the Latin <hi rend="italic">ſicilicus,</hi> which ſignified in that language a <hi rend="italic">quarter oſ an ounce,</hi> or the 48th part of a Roman pound. In confirmation of this etymology it is alleged, that the ſhilling kept its original ſignification, and bore the ſame proportion to the Saxon pound as ſicilicus did to the Roman and the Greek, being exactly the 48th part of the Saxon pound ; a diſcovery which we owe to Mr Lambarde<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[m]* Explicatio Rerum et Verborum in Leg. Sax. voc. Libra.</p></note> *,</p><p>However, the Saxon laws reckon the pound in the round number at 50 ſhillings, but they really coined out of it only 48 ; the value of the ſhilling was five- pence ; but it was reduced to fourpence above a century before the conqueſt ; for ſeveral of the Saxon laws, made in Athelſtan’s reign, oblige us to take this eſtimate. Thus it continued to the Norman times, as one of the Conqueror’s laws ſufficiently aſeertains ; and it seems to have been the common coin by which the Engliſh payments were adjuſted. After the conqueſt, the French <hi rend="italic">ſolidus</hi> of twelvepence, which was in uſe among the Normans, was called by the Engliſh name of ſhilling ; and the Saxon ſhilling of fourpence took a Norman name, and was called the <hi rend="italic">groat,</hi> or great coin, becauſe it was the largeſt Engliſh coin then known in England.</p><p>It has been the opinion of the biſhops Fleetwood and Gibſon, and of the antiquaries in general, that, though the method of reckoning by pounds, marks, and ſhillings, as well as by pence and farthings, had been in constant uſe even from the Saxon times, long before the Norman conqueſt, there never was ſuch a coin in England as either a pound or a mark, nor any ſhilling, till the year 1504 or 1505, when a few ſilver ſhillings or twelve-pences were coined, which have long ſince been ſolely confined to the cabinets of collectors.</p><p>Mr Clarke combats this opinion, alleging that ſome coins mentioned by Mr Folkes, under Edward I. were probably Saxon ſhillings new minted, and that archbiſhop Aelfric expreſsly ſays<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[m]* Gram. Saxon, p. 52.</p></note> *, that the Saxons had three names for their money, viz. mancuſes, ſhillings, and pennies. He alſo urges the different value of the Saxon ſhilling at different times, and its uniform proportion to the pound, as an argument that their ſhilling was a coin ; and the teſtimony of the Saxon gospels, in which the word we have tranſlated <hi rend="italic">pieces of silver</hi> is rendered sh <hi rend="italic">illings,</hi> which, he says, they would hardly have done, if there had been no ſuch coin as a ſhilling then in uſe. Accordingly the Saxons expreſſed their ſhilling in Latin by <hi rend="italic">ſiclus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">argenteus.</hi> He farther adds, that the Saxon ſhilling was never expreſſed by <hi rend="italic">ſolidus</hi> till after the Norman ſettlements in England ; and howsoever it altered during the long period that elapſed from the conqueſt to the time of Henry VII. it was the moſt conſtant denomination of money in all payments, though it was then only a species of account, or the twentieth part of the pound Sterling ; and when it was again revived as a coin, it leſſened gradually as the pound Sterling leſſened, from the 28th of Edward III. to the 43d of Elizabeth.</p><p>In the year 1560 there was a peculiar fort of ſhilling ſtruck in Ireland, of the value of ninepence Engliſh, which paſſed in Ireland for twelvepence. The motto on the reverſe was, <hi rend="italic">poſui Deum adjutorem meum.</hi> Eighty-two of theſe ſhillings, according to Malynes, went to the pound ; they therefore weighed 20 grains, one-fourth each, which is ſomewhat heavier in proportion than the Engliſh ſhilling of that time, 62 whereof went to the pound, each weighing 92 grains ſeven-eighths ; and the Iriſh ſhilling being valued at the Tower at ninepence Engliſh, that is, one-fourth part leſs than the Engliſh ſhilling, it ſhould therefore proportionably weigh one fourth part leſs, and its full weight be ſomewhat more than 62 grains ; but ſome of them found at this time, though much worn, weighed 69 grains. In the year 1598, five different pieces of money of this kind were ſtruck in England for the ſervice of the kingdom of Ireland. Theſe were ſhillings to be current in Ireland at twelvepence each ; half ſhillings to be current at ſixpence, and quarter ſhillings at threepence. Pennies and halfpennies were alſo ſtruck of the ſame kind, and ſent over for the payment of the army in Ireland. The money thus coined was of a very baſe mixture of copper and ſilver ; and two years after there were more pieces of the ſame kinds ſtruck for the ſame ſervice, which were ſtill worſe ; the former being three ounces of ſilver to nine ounces of copper ; and theſe latter only two ounces eighteen pennyweights to nine ounces two pennyweights of the alloy.</p><p>The Dutch, Fſemiſh, and Germans, have likewiſe their ſhilling, called sch <hi rend="italic">elin, schilling, fralin,</hi> &amp; c. but theſe not being of the ſame weight or fineneſs with the Engliſh ſhilling, are not current at the ſame value. The Engliſh ſhilling is worth about 23 French ſols ; thoſe of Holland and Germany about 11 ſols and an half; thoſe of Flanders about nine. The Dutch ſhillings are alſo called <hi rend="italic">fols de gros,</hi> becauſe equal to twelve gros. The Danes have copper ſhillings worth about one- fourth of a farthing Sterling.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
