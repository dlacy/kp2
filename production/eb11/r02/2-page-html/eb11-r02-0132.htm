<p><span class="font0">many snakes these are spiny and hard, but according to Leydig this hardness is not due to a horny substance but to the deposition of calcifying matter. E. D. Cope has investigated the&nbsp;almost endless minor modifications of these penial features and&nbsp;uses them for taxonomic purposes in the snakes. Vestiges of&nbsp;these organs occur in females of snakes and lizards. Close to&nbsp;these organs of the snakes lies a pair of anal glands of some size,&nbsp;which pour their very offensive secretion through an opening&nbsp;close to the base’ of each penis. The same glands occur in the&nbsp;same position in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,</span><span class="font0"> which has no copulatory organs,&nbsp;and in crocodiles they appear as evertible musk glands. Hence&nbsp;J. E. V; Boas, not knowing of their existence in both sexes of&nbsp;snakes, tried to homologize them with the paired penes of&nbsp;reptiles, an error which has been repeated in C. Gegenbauris&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lehrbuch,</span><span class="font0"> vol. ii. p. 533.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The crocodiles and tortoises possess a single, median copulatory organ ; it lies on the ventral or anterior end of the cloaca, the outer opening of which is therefore a longitudinal slit,&nbsp;hence the term </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ucthotremala.</span><span class="font0"> In the crocodiles the organ is&nbsp;attached to the caudal corner of the ischiadic symphysis by a&nbsp;strong and roundish fibrous band, which arises single from the&nbsp;ventral sides and forms partly the continuation of the two&nbsp;fibrous halves of the organ; the bulk of the crura, comparable&nbsp;to corpora cavernosa, is not attached to the pelvis, as generally&nbsp;stated, but projects backwards towards and into the pelvic&nbsp;cavity. This portion is especially rich in venous Cavernosities.&nbsp;The outer coating of the glans possesses various papillary projections, which are furnished with sensory, hedonic corpuscles.&nbsp;On the morphologically dorsal side of the organ, not on the&nbsp;dorsum penis, is a deep groove which ends towards the crura&nbsp;in a blind sac, into the farther corner of which open the vasa&nbsp;deferentia. In a full-grown Nile crocodile the whole organ&nbsp;is about 10 in. long. In young females up to a total length&nbsp;of 3 or 4 ft. the clitoris is nearly of the same size as the male&nbsp;organ, but it remains stationary and appears very small in&nbsp;large specimens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The organ of the tortoises is essentially of the same type as that of the crocodiles, but it is nowhere directly attached&nbsp;to the pelvis or to any other skeletal part. The whole organ,&nbsp;when withdrawn, lies in a ventral, long recess of the wide outer&nbsp;cloacal chamber, and its crura extend so far back as to form&nbsp;the continuation of thc ventral and lateral walls of the recessus&nbsp;which is continued into the neck of the urinary bladder. Its&nbsp;orifice and those of thc seminal ducts are enclosed by the walls&nbsp;of the deep groove which runs along the underside of the organ.&nbsp;This is always of considerable size, surprisingly large in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The clitoris is small, sometimes tiny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sexual act is extremely prolonged in Chelonians and StilI more so are the preliminaries, but in crocodiles it is the&nbsp;deed of a few seconds. Lizards and snakes insert only one&nbsp;side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There remains the question whether the unpaired organ of the crocodiles and tortoises, which is the prototype of the&nbsp;mammalian organ in every essential point, and the paired&nbsp;organs of the lizards and snakes, are to a certain extent homologous organs in so far as they can both be derived from the&nbsp;same indifferent condition. With this view we assume that&nbsp;originally the protrusihle walls of the outer cloacal chamber&nbsp;became specialized into a right and left imperfect intromittent&nbsp;organ, that subsequently, in lizards, those hemipenes were&nbsp;shifted back towards the tail and were henceforth bound to&nbsp;develop separately, while <sub>(</sub> in the crocodiles, tortoises, mammals&nbsp;and birds the two primitive lateral evertile flaps approached&nbsp;each other towards the ventral anterior side of the cloaca,&nbsp;and that this led to a fusion, beginning probably at the basal&nbsp;part, which at the same time was farther withdrawn from the&nbsp;surface and secured the reception of the sperma from both&nbsp;vasa deferentia into one canal. This hypothesis * has been&nbsp;objected to by Boas, but accepted by Gegenbaur (p. 538) after&nbsp;having been rejected on p. 533 of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lehrbuch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fat bodies</span><span class="font0"> belong at least physiologically to the generative system. They are placed outside the peritonéum. In lizards they appear as two masses in the pelvic region, the&nbsp;black peritoneal lining covering only their dorsal side. They&nbsp;consist of a network of arteries and connective tissue, the&nbsp;meshy spaces of which are filled with “ fat ”; they each receive&nbsp;an artery from the femoral vessel which enters them in the&nbsp;inguinal region; the veins collect into the abdominal. In&nbsp;snakes the fat bodies are very long, extending from the cloaca&nbsp;to the liver. Tortoises seem to have only traces of them, but&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> and in crocodiles they resemble those of lizards.—&nbsp;The peculiar organ suspended from the right abdominal wall&nbsp;of crocodiles, variously mentioned as mesenteric gland or body,&nbsp;or fatty spleen, by Butler, is possibly related to the same&nbsp;category. The fat bodies of reptiles are sometimes vaguely&nbsp;alluded to,as hibernating bodies; like the fat bodies which are&nbsp;attached to the generative glands of Amphibia they do not&nbsp;become reduced during the eventual hibernation but are largest&nbsp;before the pairing season, by the end of which they are&nbsp;exhausted, looking reddish or grey after the loss of their stores&nbsp;of fat and probably other important contents</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Embryonic Development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fertilization of the egg always takes place internally, and the egg containing a large amount of food-yolk is of course&nbsp;meroblastic. It is sufficient to mention that many lizards,&nbsp;some chameleons and many snakes (not </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,</span><span class="font0"> geckos,&nbsp;crocodiles and Chelonians) retain their, in these cases very&nbsp;thin-shelled, eggs in the oviducts until the embryo is ’ready&nbsp;to burst the egg-membrane during the act of parturition or&nbsp;immediately after it. Such species are usually called ovo-viviparous, although there is no difference between them and&nbsp;other viviparous creatures, for instance the marsupials.&nbsp;The majority of reptiles are oviparous and the egg is enclosed&nbsp;in a strong parchment shell, with or without calcareous&nbsp;deposits. Only gas exchange can take place between such&nbsp;an egg and the outside, and it loses by evaporation, whilst in&nbsp;the batrachian egg various other exchanges are easy through&nbsp;the thin membrane. The salamander embryo, within its thin&nbsp;egg-membrane, even grows to a size many times larger than&nbsp;the original egg, it does not only breathe, but it is also nourished&nbsp;through the gills, and by some means or other the waste&nbsp;products are partly eliminated without filling the bladder.&nbsp;The amphibia are born as larvae and live as such for a long&nbsp;time, often in a most imperfect condition. Nothing of all&nbsp;this applies to the reptile, which leaves the egg as a perfect&nbsp;little imago. A great amount of yolk supplying the material,&nbsp;and a large “ bladder ” to receive the waste products and to&nbsp;act as respiratory organ, have made this possible. That the&nbsp;allantois and the amnion behave precisely in the same way&nbsp;in the mammals with their much reduced yolk, only testifies to&nbsp;the superior value of these organs, and after all there is no&nbsp;difference in this respect between a monotreme and a reptile.&nbsp;These two organs seem to have come into existence with the&nbsp;reptiles and constitute the most reliable diagnostic feature&nbsp;between higher and lower vertebrates. All reptiles, birds&nbsp;and mammals have a navel, a feature unknown and impossible&nbsp;in Batrachia and fishes. A few remarks on these important&nbsp;embryonic organs may not be superfluous, especially concerning&nbsp;their possible origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whilst the urinary bladder of the Batrachia remains within the body throughout the embryonic stage, this organ undergoes&nbsp;in the higher vertebrates, reptiles, birds and mammals, considerable modifications, and it assumes, henceforth as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Allantois,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">new important functions besides that of being the receptacle&nbsp;of the embryonic urine. The development of the AUantois is&nbsp;in -intimate causal connexion with that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amnion.</span><span class="font0"> All&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Allantoidea</span><span class="font0"> are also </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amniota</span><span class="font0"> and vice versa, but the term&nbsp;Amniota is preferable, since the basal portion of the AUantois&nbsp;remains in the adult as the urinary bladder, as an organ henceforth equivalent to and homologous with that of the Anamnia.&nbsp;The primary feature seems to be the allantois which leaves the&nbsp;body cavity, remains without the amniotic folds, even after&nbsp;these have enclosed the body within the amniotic bag, and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
