in general, denotes a member of ſome ſenate.</p><p>The dignity of a Roman ſenator could not be ſupported without the poſſeſſion of 80,000 ſeſterces, or about 7000 l. Engliſh money ; and therefore ſuch as ſquandered away their money, and whoſe fortune was reduced below this ſum, were generally ſtruck out of the list of ſenators. This regulation was not made in the firſt ages of the republic, when the Romans boaſted of their poverty. The ſenators were not permitted to be of any trade or profeſſion. They were diſtinguiſhed from the rest of the people by their dreſs ; they wore the laticlave, half-boots of a black colour, with a creſcent or ſilver buckle in the form of a C ; but this laſt honour was confined only to the deſcendants of thoſe hundred ſenators who had been elected by Romulus, as the letter C ſeems to imply. See the preceding article.</p><p>Among us, ſenator is a member of parliament. In the laws of king Edward the Confeſſor, we are told that the Britons called thoſe <hi rend="italic">ſenators</hi> whom the Saxons called afterwards <hi rend="italic">aldermen</hi> and <hi rend="italic">borough-masters</hi>; though not for their age, but their wiſdom ; for ſome of them were young men, but very well ſkilled in the laws. Kenulph king of the Mercians granted a charter, which ran thus, viz. <hi rend="italic">Cοnsiliο et conſensu</hi> episcoporum <hi rend="italic">et</hi> ſenatorum <hi rend="italic">gentis ſuae largitus fuit dicto monasterio, &amp; c</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> .</hi></p><p>In Scotland, the lords of ſeſſion are called <hi rend="italic">ſenatort</hi> of the college of juſtice.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
