<p><span class="font0">of Count Muraviev as his successor in January 1897, this tendency of Russian policy became less marked. In April 1897,&nbsp;it is true, when the Greeks provoked a war with Turkey, they&nbsp;received no support from St Petersburg, but at the close of the&nbsp;war the tsar showed himself more friendly to them; and afterwards, when it proved extremely difficult to find a suitable&nbsp;person as governor-general of Crete (see Crete), he recommended the appointment of his cousin, Prince George of Greece&nbsp;—a selection which was pretty sure to accelerate the union of&nbsp;the island with the Hellenic kingdom. How far the recommendation was due to personal feeling, as opposed to political&nbsp;considerations, it is impossible to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Asia, after the accession of Nicholas II., the expansion of Russia, following the line of least resistance and stimulated&nbsp;by the construction of the Trans-Siberian railway,&nbsp;took the direction of northern China and the effete&nbsp;little kingdom of Korea. A great part of the eastern&nbsp;section of the railway was constructed on Chinese&nbsp;territory, and elaborate preparations were made for bringing&nbsp;Manchuria within the sphere of Russian influence. With&nbsp;this view, the cabinet of St Petersburg, at the close of the&nbsp;Chino-Japanese War in 1895, objected to all annexations by&nbsp;Japan in that quarter, and insisted on having the treaty of&nbsp;Shimonoseki modified accordingly. Subsequently, by obtaining from the Tsungli-Yaman a long lease of Port Arthur&nbsp;and Talienwan and a concession to unite those ports with&nbsp;the Trans-Siberian by a branch line, she tightened her hold&nbsp;on that portion of the Chinese empire and prepared to complete&nbsp;the work of aggression by so-called “ spontaneous infiltration.”&nbsp;From Manchuria, it was assumed, the political influence and&nbsp;spontaneous infiltration would naturally spread to Korea, and&nbsp;on the deeply indented coast of the Hermit Kingdom might&nbsp;be constructed new ports and arsenals more spacious and&nbsp;strategically more important than Port Arthur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This grandiose project was unexpectedly destroyed by the energetic resistance of Japan, who had ear-marked the Hermit&nbsp;Kingdom for herself, and who declared plainly that she would&nbsp;never tolerate the exclusive influence of Russia in Manchuria.&nbsp;In vain the Russian diplomatists sought to overcome her&nbsp;opposition by dilatory negotiations, in the firm conviction&nbsp;that a small island kingdom in the Pacific would never have&nbsp;the audacity to attack a power which had conquered and&nbsp;absorbed the whole of Northern Asia. Their calculations proved&nbsp;erroneous. Convinced that the onward march of the Colossus&nbsp;could not be permanently arrested by mere diplomatic conventions, the cabinet of Tok io suddenly broke off diplomatic&nbsp;relations and commenced hostilities (February 8, 1904). For&nbsp;Russia the war proved a series of uninterrupted reverses both&nbsp;on land and on sea, until it was terminated by the treaty of&nbsp;Portsmouth in October 1905 (see Russo-Japanese War).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What contributed powerfully to the conclusion of peace was the fact that the Russian government was hampered by&nbsp;internal troubles. The old Liberal movement and the&nbsp;terrorist organizations which had been suppressed by&nbsp;Alexander III. were being resuscitated, and the liberal&nbsp;and revolutionary leaders, taking advantage of the&nbsp;unpopularity of the war, were agitating for the convocation&nbsp;of a Constituent Assembly, which should replace the hated&nbsp;bureaucratic régime by democratic institutions. With great&nbsp;reluctance the tsar consented to convoke a consultative chamber of deputies as a sop to public opinion, but that concession stimulated rather than calmed public opinion, and&nbsp;shortly after the conclusion of peace the Liberals and the&nbsp;Revolutionaries, combining their forces, brought about a&nbsp;general strike in St Petersburg together with the stoppage of&nbsp;railway communication all over the empire. Panic-stricken&nbsp;for a moment, the government issued a manifesto proclaiming&nbsp;Liberal principles and promising in vague language all manner&nbsp;of political reforms (October 30, 1905), and when the inordinate&nbsp;expectations created by this extraordinary document were not&nbsp;at once realized, preparations were made for overthrowing&nbsp;the existing regime by means of an armed insurrection. Many&nbsp;believed that the end of autocracy had come, and an extemporized Council of Labour Deputies, anxious to play the part&nbsp;of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Comité de Salut Public</span><span class="font0">, was ready to take over the supreme&nbsp;power and exercise it in the interests of the proletariat. In&nbsp;reality the revolutionary movement was not so strong and&nbsp;the government not so weak as was generally supposed.&nbsp;Mutinies occurred, it is true, during the next few weeks in&nbsp;Kronstadt and Sevastopol, and in December there was streetfighting for several days in Moscow, but such serious disorders&nbsp;were speedily suppressed, and thereafter the revolutionary&nbsp;manifestations were confined to mass meetings, processions&nbsp;with red flags, attempts on the lives of officials and policemen,&nbsp;robberies under arms and agrarian disturbances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Notwithstanding the unsatisfactory results of the October manifesto the tsar kept his promise of convoking a legislative&nbsp;assembly, and on the 10th of May 1906 the first Duma was&nbsp;opened by his majesty in person; but it was so systematically&nbsp;and violently hostile to the government and so determined&nbsp;to obtain executive, in addition to its legislative, functions,&nbsp;that it was dissolved on the 23rd of July without any legislative&nbsp;work being accomplished. The second Duma, which met on&nbsp;the 5th of March 1907, avoided some of the mistakes of its&nbsp;predecessor, but as a legislative assembly it showed itself&nbsp;equally incompetent, and a large section of its members were&nbsp;implicated in a well-organized attempt to spread sedition in&nbsp;the army by revolutionary propaganda. It was dissolved,&nbsp;therefore, on the 16th of June 1907, and the electoral law&nbsp;which had given such unsatisfactory results was modified by&nbsp;imperial ukase.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The third Duma was subsequently convoked for the 14th of November 1907.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D. M. W.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Development of the Russian Constitution.—</span><span class="font0">At the end of 1910 the Russian revolution, which seemed at one time to promise&nbsp;an overturn as complete as that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ancien régime</span><span class="font0"> in France,&nbsp;would seem to have entered on a path of orderly and conservative&nbsp;development, and it is possible, now that the smoke of combat&nbsp;has cleared away, to form some estimate of the forces through&nbsp;the interplay of which this result has been achieved. At the&nbsp;outset the superficial resemblance between the revolutionary&nbsp;movement in Russia and that of 1789 in France was&nbsp;striking: there was the same breakdown of the&nbsp;traditional machinery of government, the same general&nbsp;outcry for control by a representative national assembly,&nbsp;the same gradual and reluctant concessions wrung from the&nbsp;crown under pressure of disaffection in the army, popular&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">émeutes,</span><span class="font0"> the assassination of unpopular officials, and the burning&nbsp;of country houses by organized bands of peasants. Similar, too,&nbsp;was the revelation, when freedom of speech was at last allowed,&nbsp;of the unhappy effect of the long divorce of the intellect of the&nbsp;country from any experience of practical politics. But here the&nbsp;analogy breaks down. France in 1789, though its ancient provincial boundaries survived, had long since been welded into&nbsp;a nation conscious of its common interests; Russia remains a&nbsp;vast empire, composed of the most heterogeneous, sometimes&nbsp;even mutually hostile, elements, whose antagonisms were bound&nbsp;to be an element of weakness in any assembly truly representative&nbsp;of all sections of the people. In France the Revolution had&nbsp;been the work of the middle classes; in Russia an indigenous&nbsp;middle class has, comparatively speaking, no existence, the&nbsp;peasants forming the overwhelming majority of the population.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>The supreme peril to the autocracy in Russia lay in the genuine&nbsp;grievances of the peasants, less political than economic, which&nbsp;had opened their minds to revolutionary propaganda. These&nbsp;grievances once removed, and their legitimate land-hunger&nbsp;satisfied, the peasants would become a bulwark of the established order, whatever that might be, as had happened in similar&nbsp;circumstances in Austria in 1849. As for the revolutionary&nbsp;“ intellectuals,” without the lever of agrarian discontent they</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>In 1897 only 15% of the population were engaged in commerce or industry, including the work-people. Of the middle class,&nbsp;moreover, a large proportion were Jews and Germans. The&nbsp;peasants numbered 75 %.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
