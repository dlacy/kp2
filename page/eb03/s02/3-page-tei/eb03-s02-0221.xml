But indeed it can do no great harm in this way; for the ſcientific part of it is abſolutely unintelligible for want of ſcience in the translator; and the practical part is full of blunders for want of knowledge of the French language.</p><p>We offer this account of the ſubject with all proper reſpect and diſſidence. We do not profeſs to teach: but by pointing out the defects of the celebrated works</p><p>of M. Bouguer, and the courſe which may be taken to remove them, while we preſerve much valuable knowledge which they contain, we may perhaps excite ſome perſons to apply to this ſubject, who, by a combination of what is juſt in M. Bouguer’s theory, with an experimental doctrine of the impulſes of fluids, may produce a treatiſe of ſeamanſhip which will not be confined to the libraries of mathematicians, but become a manual for ſeamen by profeſſion.</p><p>SEAMEN, ſuch perſons as ſerve the king or others at ſea by navigation and fighting ſhips, &amp;c.

Regiſtered ſeamen are exempted from ſerving in any pariſh, office, &amp;c. and are allowed bounty-money beſide their pay. By the law of merchants, the ſeamen of a veſſel are accountable to the maſter or commander, the maſter to the owners, and the owners to the merchants, for damage ſuſtained either by negligence or otherwtſe. Where a ſeaman is hired for a voyage, and he deſerts before it is ended, he ſhall loſe his wages; and in cafe a ſhip be loſt in a ſtorm, the ſeamen loſe their wages, as well as the owners their freight.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Means oſ Preferring the Health of </hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Seamen.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine,</hi> n⁰ 351.</p><p>In addition to what has been ſaid on this ſubject in the place referred to, we ſhall ſubjoin ſome valuable obſervations which we have met with in the ſixth volume of the Memoirs of the Royal Society of Medicine at Paris for the years 1784 and 1785.</p><p>In 1783, the marſhal de Caſtries, intending to make ſome changes in the regulations of the navy, particularly with regard to diet, propoſed to the ſociety the two following queſtions: 1. “What are the moſt wholeſome aliments for ſeamen, conſidering the impoſſibility  of procuring them freſh meat? And what kinds of ſalt meat, or fiſh, of pulſe, and of drink, are moſt proper for them, and in what quantity, not omitting to inquire into the regimens in uſe amongſt other maritime nations for what may be adopted by us, and into what experience has evinced the utility of, from the accounts of the moſt celebrated navigators?” 2. “A number of patients labouring under different diſeaſes being aſſembled in naval hoſpitals, and different conſtitutions affected by the ſame diſeaſe requiring difference of diet, what general dietetic rules for an hoſpital would be beſt adapted to every exigence, dividing the patients into three claſſes; the firſt in which liquids alone are proper, the ſecond in which we begin to give ſolids in ſmall quantities, and the ſtate of convalescence in which a fuller diet is neceſſary?” A committee was appointed to draw up an anſwer to theſe, who inveſtigated the ſubject very minutely. The reſult oſ their labours is there given at large. The obſervations moſt worthy of notice are, that the ſcurvy of the Engliſh ſeamen, who live chiefly on ſalt-meat, is a putrid diſeaſe; whilſt that of the Dutch, who uſe farinaceous vegetables and dried pulſe in large quantities, has more of an hydropical tendency. A mixture of both, even at the ſame meal,</p><p>is recommended. This is ſupported by philoſophical reaſoning, and the example of Captain Cook, who was partly indebted to this mixed regimen for the preſervation of his crew. Salt fiſh ſhould never be uſed: ſalt beef grows hard, and aſter boiling its fibrous parts only remain, which are more calculated to load the ſtomach than recruit the ſtrength. Salt bacon may be kept at ſea 18 months; it does not loſe its moiſt and nutrimental parts, and unites better with pulſe, but ſhould not be uſed when rancid. Live animals kept on board- ſhips tend to produce diſeaſes amongſt the crew. Rice ſhould be uſed largely. Our puddings are bad food: the flour would be much better made into bread, which might be done at ſea with no great trouble. Sour krout ſhould be uſed freely. Muſtard, vinegar, ſugar, molaſſes, and honey, are good antiſcorbutics, Of drinks, wine is the beſt: wort, ſpruce-beer, or the Ruffian <hi rend="italic">quas,</hi> are good ſubſtitutes. Spirits are only to be uſed in cold climates, and in ſmall quantity. The greater part of the excellent memoir in anſwer to the ſecond queſtion, perfectly coincides with M. Duhamel du Monceaux’s “Means of Preſerving the Health of Seamen,” and M. Poiſſonnier des Perrieres’s treatiſes “On the Diseaſes of Seamen,” and “On the advantages of changing the Diet of Seamen,” and his “Examination of Pringle’s Differtation.”</p><p>SEAPOYS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sepoys,</hi> natives of Indoſtan ſerving in a military capacity under the European powers, and diſciplined after the European manner.</p><p>The Seapoys of the Engliſh Eaſt India company compoſe perhaps the moſt numerous, regular, and beſt diſciplined body of black troops in the world. They are raiſed from among the natives of the country, and conſiſt of Moors or Mahometans, Raja-poots, Hindoos, Pariars, beſides many intermediate caſts peculiar to themſelves; the whole modelled in all correſponding particulars, and diſciplined in every reſpect as the army oſ Great Britain.</p><p>The military eſtabliſhments of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay, have each their reſpective numbers, that of Bengal exceeding the rest. The Seapoys are formed into complete, uniform, and regular battalions, as our marching regiments at home, being intended to repreſent and anſwer fully to every purpoſe in India to the like troops in Europe. A battalion conſiſts of 700 men, of complete effective ſtrength. In each there are eight companies, including two flank ones or grenadiers. They are reſpectively commanded by their own black and European officers; to each company there is attached a ſubaltern, who takes the command, under whom are two native commiſſioned officers, bearing the rank of ſubidar and jimindar; of eight ſubalterns, ſix</p></body></text></TEI>
