            <p>The national records were not allowed to he written by any man who might think
                himself fit for the office; and if a prieſt falſified them, he was excluded from the
                altar and depoſed from his office. Thus we are aſſured, the Jewiſh records were
                committed to the charge of the prieſts; and as they may be conſidered as the same
                family from Aaron to the Babyloniſh captivity and downwards, the ſame credit is due
                to them that would be due to family records, which by antiquarians are eſteemed the
                moſt authentic ſources of information.</p>
            <p>Of the 22 books which Joſephus reckoned himſelf bound to believe, the hiſtorical
                books from the death of Moſes to the reign of Artaxerxes, he informs us, were
                written by contemporary prophets. It appears, then, that the prophets were the
                compoſers, and the prieſts the hereditary keepers, of the national records. Thus,
                the beſt proviſion poſſible was made that they ſhould be written accurately, and be
                preſerved uncorrupted. The principal office of theſe prophets was to inſtruct the
                people in their duty to God, and occaſionally to communicate the predictions of
                future events. For this ρurpoſe they were educated in the ſchools of the prophets,
                or in academies where ſacred learning was taught. The prophets were therefore the
                learned men of their time, and conſequently were beſt qualified for the office of
                hiſtorians. It may be objected, that the prophets, in concert with the prieſts,
                might have forged any writings they pleaſed. But before we ſuſpect that they have
                done ſo in the hiſtorical books of the Old Teſtament, we muſt find out ſome motive
                which could induce them to commit ſo daring a crime. But this is impoſſible. No
                encomiums are made either upon the prophets or the prieſts; no adulation to the
                reigning monarch appears, nor is the favour of the populace courted. The faults of
                all ranks are delineated without referve. Indeed there is no hiſtory extant that has
                more the appearance of impartiality. We are preſented with a ſimple detail of facts,
                and are left to diſcover the motives and intentions of the ſeveral characters; and
                when a character is drawn, it is done in a few words, without exaggerating the vices
                or amplifying the virtues.</p>
            <p>It is of no real conſequence, therefore, whether we can aſcertain the authors of the
                different books or not. From Joſephus we know that they exiſted in his time; and
                from his account of the manner in which they were preſerved we are aſſured they were
                not in danger of being corrupted. They exiſted alſo when the Septua- gint
                tranſlation was made. Frequent references are made to them in the writings of the
                later prophets; ſometimes the ſame facts are related in detail. In ſhort, there is
                ſuch a coincidence between the hiſtorical books and the writings of thoſe prophets
                who were contemporary, that it is impoſſible to ſuppoſe the latter true without
                receiving the former.</p>
            <p>Indeed, to ſuppoſe that the Jews could have received and preſerved with ſuch care for
                ſo many hundred years falſe records, which it muſt have been in the power of every
                perſon to diſprove, and which at the ſame time do ſo little credit to the character
                of their nation,</p>
            <p>is to ſuppoſe one of the greateſt abſurdities in the world: it is to ſuppoſe that a
                whole nation could act contrary to all thoſe principles which have always
                predominated in the human mind, and which muſt always predominate till human nature
                undergo a total revolution.</p>
            <p>The book which immediately follows the Pentateuch has been generally aſcribed to
                Joſhua the ſucceſſor of Moſes. It contains, however, ſome things which muſt have
                been inſerted after the death of Joſhua. It is neceſſary to remark, that there is
                ſome accidental derangement in the order of the chapters of this book, which was
                probably occaſioned by the ancient mode of fixing together a number of rolls. If
                chronologically placed, they ſhould be read thus, 1ſt chapter to the 10th verſe,
                then the 2d chapter; then from the 10th verſe to the end of the 1ſt chapter;
                afterwards ſhould follow the vi. vii. viii. ix x. and xi. chapters; then the xxii.;
                and laſtly the xii. and xiii. chapters to the 24th verſe of the latter.</p>
            <p>The facts mentioned in this book are referred to by many of the ſacred writers @@§.
                In the book of Kings XVI. 34. the words of Joſhua are ſaid to be the words of God.
                See <hi rend="smallcaps">Joshua.</hi></p>
            <p>By whom the book of Judges was written is uncertain; but as it contains the hiſtory
                of the Jewiſh republic for 317 years, the materials muſt have been furniſhed by
                different perſons. The book, however, ſeems to be the compoſition of one individual
                @@(G), who lived after the regal government was eltabliſhed@@‡, but before the
                acceſſion of David: for it is ſaid in the 21ſt verſe of the 1ſt chapter, that the
                Jeſuſites were ſtill in Jeruſalem; who, we know, were diſpoſſeſſed of that city
                early in the reign of David@@⁋. We have reaſon, therefore, to aſcribe this book to
                Samuel.</p>
            <p>The hiſtory of this book may be divided into two parts; the firſt contains an account
                of the Judges from Othniel to Samſon, ending at the 16th chap. The ſecond part
                relates ſeveral remarkable tranſactions which occurred ſoon after the death of
                Joſhua; but are thrown to the end of the book, that they might not interrupt the
                courſe of the hiſtory. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Judges.</hi></p>
            <p>The book of Ruth is a kind of ſupplement to the book of Judges, and an introduction
                to the hiſtory of David, as it is related in the books of Samuel. Since the
                genealogy which it contains deſcends to David, it muſt have been written after the
                birth of that prince, but not at any conſiderable time after it; for the hiſtory of
                Boaz and Ruth, the great-grandfather and great-grandmother of David, could not be
                remembered above two or three generations. As the elder brothers of David and their
                sons are omitted, and none of his own children are mentioned in the genealogy, it is
                evident that the book was compoſed in honour of the Hebrew monarch, after he was
                anointed king by Samuel, and before any of his children were born; and conſequently
                in the reign of Saul. The Jews aſcribe it to Samuel; and indeed there is no perſon
                of that age to whom it may be attributed with more propriety. We are informed (1
                Sam. x. 25.) that Samuel was a writer,</p>
