        <p><span class="font1">Servius Tullius went far beyond this. His famous distribution of all
                freeholders (assidui) into tribes, classes, and centuries,@@<sup>1</sup> though
                subsequently adopted with modifications as the basis of the political system, was at
                first exclusively military in its nature and objects.@@<sup>2</sup> It
                amounted&nbsp;in fact to the formation of a new and enlarged army on&nbsp;a new
                footing. In this force, excepting in the case of&nbsp;the centuries of the horsemen,
                no regard was paid either&nbsp;to the old clan divisions, or to the semi-religious
                semipolitical curiae. In its ranks were included all freeholders within the Roman
                territory, whether members or&nbsp;not of any of the old divisions, and the
                organization of this&nbsp;new army of assidui was not less independent of the
                old&nbsp;system with its clannish and religious traditions and forms.&nbsp;The unit
                was the “eenturia ” or company of 100 men; the&nbsp;centuriae were grouped in “
                classes ” and drawn up in&nbsp;the order of the phalanx.@@<sup>3</sup> The centuries
                in front&nbsp;were composed of the wealthier citizens, whose means&nbsp;enabled them
                to bear the cost of the complete equipments&nbsp;necessary for those who were to
                bear the brunt of the&nbsp;onset. These centuries formed the first class.
                Behind&nbsp;them stood the centuries of the second and third classes,&nbsp;less
                completely armed, but making up together with those&nbsp;of the first class the
                heavy-armed infantry.@@<sup>4</sup> In the rear&nbsp;were the centuries of the
                fourth and fifth classes, recruited&nbsp;from the poorer freeholders, and serving
                only as lightarmed troops. The entire available body of freeholders&nbsp;was divided
                into two equal portions, a reserve corps of&nbsp;<sup>11</sup> seniores ” and a
                corps of “juniores ” for active service.&nbsp;Each of these corps consisted of 85
                centuries or 8500 men,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> of two legions of about 4200 men each, the
                normal&nbsp;strength of a consular legion under the early republic.@@<sup>5</sup>
                It&nbsp;is noticeable also that the heavy-armed centuries of the&nbsp;three first
                classes in each of these legions represented a&nbsp;total of 3000 men, a number
                which agrees exactly with&nbsp;the number of heavy-armed troops in the legion
                as&nbsp;described by Polybius. Attached to the legions, but not&nbsp;included in
                them, were the companies of sappers and&nbsp;trumpeters. Lastly, to the six
                centuries of horsemen,&nbsp;which still retained the old tribal names, twelve
                more&nbsp;were added as a distinct body, and recruited from the&nbsp;wealthiest
                class of citizens.@@<sup>6</sup> The four <sup>11</sup> tribes ” also instituted by
                Servius were probably intended to serve as the&nbsp;basis for the levy of
                freeholders for the new army.@@<sup>7 </sup>As&nbsp;their names show, they
                corresponded with the natural&nbsp;local divisions of the city
                    territory,@@<sup>8</sup> but that they&nbsp;included freeholders residing on
                Roman territory but outside Rome is indicated by the fact that both Ostia
                and&nbsp;Alba belonged to the Palatine tribe.@@<sup>9</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The last of these Etruscan lords to rule in Rome was Tarquín the
                Proud. He is described as a splendid and&nbsp;despotic monarch. His sway extended
                over Latium as *&nbsp;far south as Circeii. Aristodemus, tyrant of Cumse,&nbsp;was
                his ally, and kinsmen of his own were princes at&nbsp;Collatia, at Gabii, and at
                Tusculum. The Volscian highlanders were chastised, and Signia with its
                massive&nbsp;walls was built to hold them in check. In Rome&nbsp;itself the
                Capitoline temple and the great cloaca bore&nbsp;witness to his power. But his rule
                pressed heavily upon&nbsp;the Romans, and at the last, on the news of the
                foul&nbsp;wrong done by his son Sextus to a noble Roman matron,&nbsp;Lucretia, the
                indignant people rose in revolt. Tarquín,&nbsp;who was away besieging Ardea, was
                deposed ; sentence of&nbsp;exile was passed upon him and upon all his race; and
                the&nbsp;people swore that never again should a king rule in Rome.&nbsp;Freed from
                the tyrant, they chose for themselves two&nbsp;yearly magistrates who should
                exercise the supreme&nbsp;authority, and thus the republic of Rome was
                founded.&nbsp;Three times the banished Tarquín strove desperately to&nbsp;recover
                the throne he had lost. First of all the men of&nbsp;Veii and Tarquinii marched to
                his aid, but were defeated in&nbsp;a pitched battle on the Roman frontier. A year
                later Lars&nbsp;Porsena, prince of Clusium, at the head of all the powers&nbsp;of
                Etruria, appeared before the gates of Rome, and closely&nbsp;besieged the city,
                until, moved by the valour of his foe, he&nbsp;granted honourable terms of peace and
                    withdrew.@@<sup>10</sup> Once&nbsp;again, by Lake Regillus, the Romans fought
                victoriously for&nbsp;their liberty against Tarquin’s son-in-law Mamilius,
                prince&nbsp;of Tusculum, and chief of the Latin name. Mamilius&nbsp;was slain;
                Tarquín in despair found a refuge at Cumse,&nbsp;and there soon afterwards
                died.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">So, in brief, ran the story of the flight of the kings, as it was
                told by the chroniclers whom Livy followed. Its&nbsp;details are most of them
                fabulous; it is crowded with&nbsp;inconsistencies and improbabilities; there are no
                trustworthy dates; the names even of the chief actors are&nbsp;probably fictitious,
                and the hand of the improver, Greek&nbsp;or Roman, is traceable
                    throughout.@@<sup>11</sup> The struggle was&nbsp;doubtless longer and sharper,
                and the new constitution&nbsp;more gradually shaped, than tradition would have
                us&nbsp;believe. Possibly, too, this revolution in Rome was but&nbsp;a part of a
                widespreading wave of change in Latium and&nbsp;central Italy, similar to that which
                in Greece swept away&nbsp;the old heroic monarchies. But there is no room
                for&nbsp;doubting the main facts of the emancipation of Rome&nbsp;from the rule of
                alien princes and the final abolition of&nbsp;the kingly office.</span></p>

                that of a priestly officer&nbsp;(rex sacrorum) to whom some of the religious
