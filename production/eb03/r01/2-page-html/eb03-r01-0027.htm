<p><span class="font1">this notch embraces and preſſes againſt the ſteel arbor (d). This end of the frame may be raiſed or depreſſed&nbsp;by moving the priſmatic ſlide (u), which may be fixed&nbsp;at any height by the four ſteel-ſcrews (v).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ The bottom of this ſlide has a notch (k); whoſe pjane is parallel to the endleſs-ſcrew; and by the point of&nbsp;the arbor (d) reſting in this notch, this end of the&nbsp;frame is prevented from tilting. The ſcrew S is pre-vented from unturning, by tightening the finger-nut (w).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; The teeth on the circumference of the wheel were cut by the following method :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; Having conſidered what number of teeth on the circumference would be moſt convenient, which in this&nbsp;engine is 2160, or 360 multiplied by 6, I made two&nbsp;ſcrews of the ſame dimenſions, of tempered ſteel, in&nbsp;the manner hereafter deſcribed, the interval between&nbsp;the threads being ſuch as I knew by calculation&nbsp;would come within the limits of what might be turned&nbsp;off the circumference of the wheel : one of theſe ſcrews,&nbsp;which was intended for ratching or cutting the teeth,&nbsp;was notched acroſs the threads, ſo that the fcrew, when&nbsp;preſſed againſt the edge of the wheel and turned round,&nbsp;cut in the manner of a ſaw. Then having a ſegment&nbsp;of a circle a little greater than 60 degrees, of about&nbsp;the ſame radius with the wheel, and the circumference&nbsp;made true, from a very fine centre, I defcribed an arch&nbsp;near the edge, and ſet off the chord of 60 degrees on&nbsp;this arch. This ſegment was put in the place of the&nbsp;wheel, the edge of it was ratched, and the number of&nbsp;revolutions and parts of the ſcrew contained between&nbsp;the interval of the 60 degrees were counted. The&nbsp;radius was corrected in the proportion of 360 revolu-tions, which ought to have been in 60 degrees, to the&nbsp;number actually found ; and the radius, ſh corrected,&nbsp;was taken in a pair of beam∙compaffes : while the&nbsp;wheel was on the lath, one foot of the compaffes was&nbsp;put in the centre, and with the other a circle was de-ſcribed on the ring ; then half the depth of the threads&nbsp;of the ſcrew being taken in dividers, was ſet from this&nbsp;circle outwards, and another circle was deſcribed cutting this point ; a hollow was then turned on the edge&nbsp;of the wheel of the ſame curvature as that of the ſcrew&nbsp;at the bottom of the threads : the bottom of this hollow was turned to the ſame radius or diſtance from the&nbsp;centre of the wheel, as the outward of the two circles&nbsp;before-mentioned,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; The wheel was now taken off the lath ; and the bell-metal piece </span><span class="font2">D </span><span class="font1">was fcrewed on as before directed,&nbsp;which after this ought not to be removed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; From a very exact centre a circle was deſcribed on the ring </span><span class="font2">C, </span><span class="font1">about √⅛∙ of an inch within where the&nbsp;bottom of the teeth would come. This circle was di-vided with the greateſt exactneſs I was capable of, ſirſt&nbsp;into five parts, and each of theſe into three. Theſe&nbsp;parts were then biſected four times : (that is to ſay)&nbsp;ſuppoſing the whole circumference of the wheel t© con-tain 2160 teeth, this being divided into five parts, each&nbsp;would contain 432 teeth; which being divided into three&nbsp;parts, each of them would contain 144 ; and this ſpace&nbsp;biſected four times would givç </span><span class="font2">72, </span><span class="font1">36, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">18, and $5 </span><span class="font1">ther¢*&nbsp;fore each of the iaſt diviſions would contain nine teeth.&nbsp;But, as I was apprehenſive ſome error might ariſe from&nbsp;quinqueſection and triſcction, in order to examine the&nbsp;accuracy of the diviſions, I deſcribed another circle </span><span class="font2">on&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the ring </span><span class="font2">C, </span><span class="font1"><sub>τ</sub>⅛ inch within the former, and divided it&nbsp;by continual biſections, as 2160, 1080, 540, 270, 135,&nbsp;67r, and 331 ; and as the fixed wire (to be deſcribed&nbsp;preſently) croſſed both the circles, I could examine&nbsp;their agreement at every 135 revolutions; (after ratching, could examine it at every 33l) : but, not finding&nbsp;any ſenſible difference between the two ſets of diviſions,&nbsp;I, for ratching, made choice of the former ; and, </span><span class="font2">aβ&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the coincidence of the fixed wire with an interſection&nbsp;could be more exactly determined than with </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">dot </span><span class="font2">or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">diviſion, I therefore made uſe of interſections in both&nbsp;circles before deſcribed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; The arms of the frame </span><span class="font2">L </span><span class="font1">were connected by a thin piece of braſs of ∣ of an inch broad, having a hole in&nbsp;the middle of √⅛ of an inch in diameter ; acroſs this&nbsp;hole a ſilver wire was fixed exactly in a line to the cen-tre of the wheel ; the coincidence of this wire with thc&nbsp;interſections was examined by a lens <sub>x</sub>⅛ inch focus,&nbsp;fixed in a tube which was attached to one of the arms&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">L </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a). Now a handle or winch being fixed on the&nbsp;end of the ſcrew, the diviſion marked 10 on the circle&nbsp;K was ſet to its index, and, by means of a clamp and&nbsp;adjuſting ſcrew for that purpoſe, the interſection mark-ed i on the circle </span><span class="font2">C </span><span class="font1">was ſet exactly to coincide with&nbsp;the fixed wire ; the ſcrew was then carefully preſſed&nbsp;againſt the circumference of the wheel, by turning the&nbsp;finger-ſcrew S ; then, removing the clamp, I turned&nbsp;the ſcrew by its handle 9 revolutions, till the interfec-tion marked 240 came nearly to the wire ; then, un-turning the finger-ſcrew S, I releaſed the ſcrew from&nbsp;the wheel, and turned the wheel back till the interſection marked 2 exactly coincided with the wire, and,&nbsp;by means of the clamp before-mentioned, the diviſion&nbsp;1 o on the circle being ſet to its index, the ſcrew was&nbsp;preſſed againſt the edge of the wheel by the finger-ſcrew S ; the clamps were removed, and the ſcrew turned nine revolutions till the interſection marked 1 nearly coincided with the fixed wire ; the ſcrew was releaſed from the wheel by unturning the finger-ſcrew </span><span class="font2">S&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">as before, the wheel was turned back till the interſection 3 coincided with the fixed wire; the diviſion 10&nbsp;on the circle being ſet to its index, the ſcrew was preſſed againſt the wheel as before, and the ſcrew was turned 9 revolutions, till the interſection 2 nearly coincided&nbsp;with the fixed wire, and the ſcrew was releaſed ; and </span><span class="font2">I&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">proceeded in this manner till the teeth were marked&nbsp;round the whole circumference of the wheel. This&nbsp;was repeated three times round, to make the impreffion of the ſcrew deeper. I then ratched the wheel&nbsp;round continually in the ſame direction without ever&nbsp;diſengaging the ſcrew; and, in ratching the wheel&nbsp;about 300 times round, the teeth were finiſhed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">&quot; Now it is evident, if the circumference of the wheel was even one tooth or ten minutes greater than the&nbsp;ſcrew would require, this error would in the firſt in-</span></p><div><a name="caption1"></a><h2><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(a) The interſections are marked for the faite of illuſtration, though properly inviſible, they lying under the braſs plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>6</sup></span></h2></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
