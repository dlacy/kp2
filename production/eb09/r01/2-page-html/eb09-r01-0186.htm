<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">greatest of this series, and one of the prominent pictures of Rembrandt’s work, is the Marriage of Samson of the&nbsp;Dresden Gallery, painted in 1638. Here Rembrandt gives&nbsp;the rein to his imagination and makes the scene live&nbsp;before us. Except the bride (Saskia), who sits calm and&nbsp;grand on a dais in the centre of the feast, with the full&nbsp;light again playing on her flowing locks and wealth of&nbsp;jewels, all is animated and full of bustle. Samson,&nbsp;evidently a Rembrandt of fantasy, leans over a chair propounding his riddle to the Philistine lords. In execution&nbsp;it is a great advance on former subject pictures; it is&nbsp;bolder in manner, and we have here signs of his approaching love of warmer tones of red and yellow. It is&nbsp;also a fine example of his magic play of colour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The story of Susannah also occupied him in these early years, and he returned to the subject in 1641 and 1653.&nbsp;The Bather of the National Gallery may also be another&nbsp;interpretation of the same theme. In all of these pictures&nbsp;the woman is coarse in type and lumpy in form, though the&nbsp;modelling is soft and round, the effect which Rembrandt&nbsp;always strove to gain. Beauty of form was outside his&nbsp;art. But the so-called Danae (1636) at St Petersburg is&nbsp;a sufficient reply to those who decry his nude female&nbsp;forms. As flesh painting it glows with colour and life,&nbsp;and the blood seems to pulsate under the warm skin. In&nbsp;the picturesque story of Tobit Rembrandt found much to&nbsp;interest him, as we see in the beautiful small picture of the&nbsp;Arenberg collection at Brussels. Sight is being restored&nbsp;to the aged Tobias, while with infinite tenderness his wife&nbsp;holds the old man’s hand caressingly. The momentary&nbsp;action is complete, and the picture goes straight to the&nbsp;heart. In the Berlin Gallery he paints the anxiety of the&nbsp;parents as they wait the return of their son. In 1637 he&nbsp;painted the fine picture now in the Louvre of the Flight&nbsp;of the Angel; and the same subject is grandly treated by&nbsp;him, apparently about 1645, in the picture exhibited in&nbsp;the winter exhibition at Burlington House in 1885.&nbsp;Reverence and awe are shown in every attitude of the Tobit&nbsp;family. A similar lofty treatment is to be found in the&nbsp;Christ as the Gardener appearing to Mary of 1638&nbsp;(Buckingham Palace).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">We have now arrived at the year 1640, the threshold of his second manner, which extended to 1654, the middle&nbsp;age of Rembrandt. During the latter part of the previous&nbsp;decade we find the shadows more transparent and the&nbsp;blending of light and shade more perfect. There is a&nbsp;growing power in every part of his art. The coldness of&nbsp;his first manner had disappeared, and the tones were&nbsp;gradually changing into golden-brown. He had passed&nbsp;through what Bode calls his “ Sturm-und-Drang ” period&nbsp;of exaggerated expression, as in the Berlin Samson, and&nbsp;had attained to a truer, calmer form of dramatic expression,&nbsp;of which the Manoali of Dresden is a good example&nbsp;(1641). Whether it was that he was getting tired of&nbsp;painting commissioned portraits, that he was independent&nbsp;of them, or that he aimed at higher flights, it is certain&nbsp;that these portraits painted “to order” became more rare&nbsp;about this time, and that those which we have are chiefly&nbsp;friends of his circle, such as the Mennonite Preacher&nbsp;(C. C. Ansloo) and the Gilder (Le Doreur), a fine example&nbsp;of his golden tone, formerly in the Morny collection and&nbsp;now in America. His own splendid portrait (1640) in the&nbsp;National Gallery illustrates the change in his work. It&nbsp;describes the man well,—strong and robust, with powerful&nbsp;head, firm and compressed lips and determined chin, with&nbsp;heavy eye-bro\vs, separated by a deep vertical furrow, and&nbsp;with eyes of keen penetrating glance,—altogether a self-reliant man that would carry out his own ideas, careless&nbsp;whether his popularity waxed or waned. The fantastic&nbsp;rendering of himself has disappeared; he seems more</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">conscious of his dignity and position. He has now many friends and pupils, and numerous commissions, even from&nbsp;the stadtholder; lie has bought a large house in the&nbsp;Breedstraat, in which during the next sixteen years of his&nbsp;life lie gathered his large collection of paintings, engravings, armour, and costume which figure afterwards in his&nbsp;inventory. His taste was wide and his purchases large,&nbsp;for he was joint owner with picture dealers of paintings by&nbsp;Giorgione and Palma Veccliio, while for a high-priced Marc-antonio Raimondi print he gave in exchange a fine&nbsp;impression of his Christ Healing the Sick, which has since&nbsp;been known as the Hundred Guilder Print. The stadt-liolder was not a prompt payer, and an interesting correspondence took place between Rembrandt and Constantin&nbsp;Huygens, the poet and secretary of the prince. The&nbsp;Rembrandt letters which have come down to us are few,&nbsp;and these are therefore of importance. Rembrandt puts a&nbsp;high value on the picture, which he says had been painted&nbsp;“ with much care and zeal,” but he is willing to take what&nbsp;the prince thinks proper; while to Huygens he sends a&nbsp;large picture as a present for his trouble in carrying&nbsp;through the business. There is here no sign of the&nbsp;grasping greed with which he has been charged, while his&nbsp;unselfish conduct is seen in the settlement of the family&nbsp;affairs at the death of his mother in 1640.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The year 1642 is remarkable for the great picture formerly known as the Night Watch, but now more&nbsp;correctly as the Sortie of the Banning Cock Company,&nbsp;another of the landmarks of Rembrandt’s career, in which&nbsp;twenty-nine life-sized civic guards are introduced issuing&nbsp;pell-mell from their club house. Such guilds of arque-busiers had been painted admirably before by Ravesteyn&nbsp;and notably by Frans Hals, but Rembrandt determined to&nbsp;throw life and animation into the scene, which is full of&nbsp;bustle and movement. One can almost hear the beating&nbsp;of the drum and the barking of the dog. The dominant&nbsp;colour is the citron yellow uniform of the lieutenant, wearing&nbsp;a blue sash, while a Titian-like red dress of a musketeer,&nbsp;the black velvet dress of the captain, and the varied green&nbsp;of the girl and drummer, all produce a rich and harmonious&nbsp;effect. The background has become dark and heavy by&nbsp;accident or neglect, and the scutcheon on which the .names&nbsp;are painted is scarcely to be seen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">But this year of great achievement was also the year of his great loss, for Saskia died in 1642, leaving&nbsp;Rembrandt her sole trustee for her son Titus, but with&nbsp;full use of the money till he should marry again or till&nbsp;the marriage of Titus. The words of the will express&nbsp;her love for her husband and her confidence in him.&nbsp;With her death his life was changed. Bode has remarked&nbsp;that there is a pathetic sadness in his pictures of the Holy&nbsp;Family,—a favourite subject at this period of his life. All&nbsp;of these he treats with the naive simplicity of Reformed&nbsp;Holland, giving us the real carpenter’s shop and the mother&nbsp;watching over the Infant reverently and lovingly, with a&nbsp;fine union of realism and idealism. It is true indeed that&nbsp;the circumstances of his time and country made it impossible for him to attempt to realize the ancient forms of&nbsp;Hebrew life, or to revive the bye-past race of Judaea. He&nbsp;was content, as the old Italians were, with the types around&nbsp;him. The street in which he lived swarmed with Dutch&nbsp;and Portuguese Jews, and many a Jewish rabbi sat to him.&nbsp;He accepted their turbans and local dress as characteristic of the people. But in his religious pictures it is&nbsp;not the costume we look at; what strikes us is the profound perception of the sentiment of the story, making&nbsp;them true to all time and independent of local circumstance. A notable example of this feeling is to be found in&nbsp;the Woman Taken in Adultery of the National Gallery,&nbsp;painted in 1644 in the manner of the Simeon of the Hague.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
