            <p><span class="font3">A fish-bellied rail, 50 lbs. to the yard, and with depths of 5
                    inches maximum and 3∙8 inches minimum, compared&nbsp;with a parallel rail of the
                    same weight, and the depth due&nbsp;to that weight, namely, 4∙4 inches, each
                    laid at three feet bearings, andhavingthethicknessof theirribs and the form of
                    their&nbsp;heads exactly similar, will be deflected, as the numbers
                    1881&nbsp;for the fish-belly, and 2282 for the equivalent parallel ;
                    that&nbsp;is to say, a thickness of iron of about 3-1 Oths of an inch,
                    must&nbsp;be added to the parallel rail in order to make it equal to
                    the&nbsp;fish-belly. This proposition will nearly shew the gain obtained by the
                    use of fish-bellies for all theusual lengths of bearing,&nbsp;and may be taken
                    at 11 to 9, since, in all cases, it is stiffness which is so essentially
                    required. Mere strength will&nbsp;always be had with the sizes now generally
                    adopted ; and&nbsp;it is consequently against deflection which we have
                    to&nbsp;guard, at the same time looking to economy, and not expending immense
                    sums of money unnecessarily, as has&nbsp;been done in purchasing rails much
                    heavier than are required. So much, hou'ever, depends on the quality of
                    the&nbsp;iron, that we would strongly recommend every rail to
            be</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font3">thoroughly tested when received from the manufacturer, and the
                    results in each case registered. This w<sup>τ</sup>ould soon&nbsp;enable such a
                    valuable collection of facts to be made, as&nbsp;that all hypothesis would cease
                    ; whereas, hitherto, there&nbsp;have been such discrepancies between experiments
                    made&nbsp;by persons of the first eminence, that, practically, the subject is
                    involved in as much uncertainty as ever.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">Wooden sleepers, which should be laid on all embankments till
                    they are thoroughly consolidated, ought to be wide and long, and it will not be
                    found too much to give&nbsp;them ten feet in length and one foot in width for a
                    three-feet&nbsp;bearing, having a proportional increase and decrease at&nbsp;any
                    other bearing. The cheapest way will be to buy the&nbsp;sleepers in the round,
                    and have them ripped in two by circular saws of about three feet in diameter, or
                    even more, and&nbsp;withallthe Ieethbrokenoffexcepteverythirdorfourtll.
                    This&nbsp;will prevent the saw from choaking, and, in a great measure, from
                    heating, which occasions the instrument to buckle,&nbsp;as it is termed. The
                    boring of the blocks should also be&nbsp;done by machinery before they are
                    delivered to the contractor, and a proportional decrease be made in his charge
                    for&nbsp;laying the permanent way ; and if the company do not perform this part
                    of the work, the contractor will find it much&nbsp;to his interest to set up a
                    machine for himself, if his contract exceed half a mile in length.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">Various have been the opinions respecting the kind of joint by
                    which the rails are connected, or, more properly&nbsp;speaking, respecting the
                    shape of their ends ; but this diversity of opinion ought not to have existed,
                    and has only&nbsp;been a consequence of our want of experience on the subject.
                    Itstandstoreason, andhasbeen found to beafact,that&nbsp;butt joints, that is to
                    say, when the ends of the rails are at&nbsp;right angles to their length, will
                    always occasion a shock&nbsp;in passing over them, even if ever so well fitted ;
                    and if, as&nbsp;is too generally the case, no regard is had to the temperature
                    in laying the way, wide gaps will be found at each&nbsp;joining, particularly in
                    winter. Half-lap joints are much&nbsp;preferable to butts, and greatly diminish
                    the shock, but are&nbsp;still liable to objection ; in the first place, through
                    their&nbsp;weakening the rail ; and, in the second, for still giving a
                    very&nbsp;unpleasant jar to the carriages, although in a less degree&nbsp;than
                    the butts. If they are laid right and left, as shewn&nbsp;below, it will improve
                    them for diagonal joints. The&nbsp;form of joint we should recommend is given in
                    fig. 11,</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font3">in which the arrow shews the direction of the train. The slope
                    ofthe joint must be placed exactly contrary upon the&nbsp;other line of rails,
                    so that the wheels never meet the pointed end of the rail, but always run off It
                    then needs no&nbsp;other care, than that the point should of the two be
                    the&nbsp;most prominent towards the wheel, and, if it is not so,
                    the&nbsp;joining rail should be taken down a little w ith a file.</span></p>
