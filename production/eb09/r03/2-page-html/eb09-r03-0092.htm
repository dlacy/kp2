        <p><span class="font1">by two events of first-rate importance,—the conquest of Africa by the
                    Vandals@@<sup>1</sup> and the invasion of Gaul and&nbsp;Italy by Attila. The
                Vandal settlement in Africa was&nbsp;closely akin in its origin and results to those
                of the&nbsp;Visigoths and of the Vandals themselves in Gaid and&nbsp;Spain. Here as
                there the occasion was given by the&nbsp;jealous quarrels of powerful imperial
                ministers. The feud&nbsp;between Boniface, count of Africa, and Aetius, the “
                master-general” or “count of Italy,” opened the way to Africa&nbsp;for the Vandal
                king Gaiseric (Genseric), as that between&nbsp;Stilicho and Rufinus had before set
                Alaric in motion&nbsp;westward, and as the quarrel between the tyrant Constantine
                and the ministers of Honorius had paved the&nbsp;way for the Vandals, Sueves, and
                Alans into Spain. In&nbsp;this case too, as in the others, the hunger for more
                land&nbsp;and treasure was the impelling motive with the barbarian&nbsp;invader, and
                in Africa, as in Gaul and Spain, the invaders’&nbsp;acquisitions were confirmed by
                the imperial authority which&nbsp;they still professed to recognize. It was in 429
                that Gai-seric, king of the Vandals, crossed with his warriors, their&nbsp;families
                and goods, to the province of Africa, a province&nbsp;hitherto almost as untouched
                as Spain by the ravages&nbsp;of war. Thanks to the quarrels of Boniface and
                Aetius&nbsp;their task was an easy one. The defenceless province&nbsp;was easily and
                quickly overrun. In 435@@<sup>2</sup> a formal&nbsp;treaty secured them in the
                possession of a large portion&nbsp;of the rich lands which were the granary of Rome,
                in&nbsp;exchange for a payment probably of corn and oil. Carthage was taken in 439,
                and by 440 the Vandal kingdom&nbsp;was firmly established.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Eleven years later (451) Attila invaded Gaul, but this Hunnish
                movement was in a variety of ways different&nbsp;from those of the Visigoths and
                Vandals. Nearly a&nbsp;century had passed since the Huns first appeared
                in&nbsp;Europe, and drove the Goths to seek shelter within the&nbsp;Roman lines.
                Attila was now the ruler of a great empire&nbsp;in central and northern
                    Europe,@@<sup>3</sup> and, in addition to his&nbsp;own Huns, the German tribes
                along the Rhine and Danube&nbsp;and far away to the north owned him as king. He
                confronted the Roman power as an equal ; and, in marked&nbsp;contrast to the Gothic
                and Vandal chieftains, he treated&nbsp;with the emperors of East and West as an
                independent&nbsp;sovereign. His advance on Gaul and Italy threatened, not&nbsp;the
                establishment of yet one more barbaric chieftain on&nbsp;Roman soil, but the
                subjugation of the civilized and&nbsp;Christian West to the rule of a heathen and
                semi-barbarous&nbsp;conqueror. But Rome now reaped the advantages of the&nbsp;policy
                which Honorius had perhaps involuntarily followed.&nbsp;The Visigoths in Gaul,
                Christian and already half&nbsp;Romanized, rallied to the aid of the empire against
                a&nbsp;common foe. Attila, defeated at Chalons @@<sup>4</sup> by
                Aetius,&nbsp;withdrew into Pannonia (451). In the next year he&nbsp;overran
                Lombardy, but penetrated no farther south,&nbsp;and in 453 he died. With the murder
                of Valentinian&nbsp;III. (453) the western branch of the house of
                Theodosius&nbsp;came to an end, and the next twenty years witnessed&nbsp;the
                accession and deposition of nine emperors. The three&nbsp;months’ rule of Maximus is
                memorable only for the invasion&nbsp;of Italy and the sack of Rome by the Vandals
                under&nbsp;Gaiseric. From 456-472 the actual ruler of Italy was&nbsp;Ricimer, the
                Sueve. Of the four emperors whom he placed&nbsp;on the throne, Majorian (457-461)
                alone played any</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">imperial part outside Italy.@@<sup>5</sup> Ricimer died in 472, and
                two years later a Pannonian, Orestes, aspired to fill the place&nbsp;which Ricimer
                had occupied. Julius Nepos was deposed,&nbsp;and Orestes filled the vacancy by
                proclaiming as Augustus&nbsp;his own son Romulus. But Orestes’s tenure of power
                was&nbsp;brief. The barbarian mercenaries in Italy determined to&nbsp;secure for
                themselves a position there such as that which&nbsp;their kinsfolk had won in Gaul
                and Spain and Africa.&nbsp;Their demand for a third of the lands of Italy was
                refused&nbsp;by Orestes,@@<sup>6</sup> and they instantly rose in revolt. On
                the&nbsp;defeat and death of Orestes they proclaimed their leader,&nbsp;Odoacer the
                    Rugian,@@<sup>7</sup> king of Italy. Romulus Augustulus&nbsp;laid down his
                imperial dignity, and the court at Con- Stantinople was informed that there was no
                longer an&nbsp;emperor of the West.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The installation of a barbarian king in Italy was the natural climax
                of the changes which had been taking place in the West throughout the 5th century.
                In Spain, Gaul, and Africa barbarian chieftains were already established&nbsp;as
                kings. In Italy, for the last twenty years, the real&nbsp;power had been wielded by
                a barbarian officer. Odoacer,&nbsp;when he decided to dispense with the nominal
                authority of&nbsp;an emperor of the West, placed Italy on the same level
                of&nbsp;independence with the neighbouring provinces. But the&nbsp;old ties with
                Rome were not severed. The new king&nbsp;of Italy formally recognized the supremacy
                of the one&nbsp;Roman emperor at Constantinople, and was invested in&nbsp;return
                with the rank of “ patrician,” which had been held&nbsp;before him by Aetius and
                Ricimer. In Italy too, as in&nbsp;Spain and Gaul, the laws, the administrative
                system, and&nbsp;the language remained Roman.@@<sup>9</sup> But the emancipation
                of&nbsp;Italy and the Western provinces from direct imperial control, which is
                signalized by Odoacer’s accession, has rightly&nbsp;been regarded as marking the
                opening of a new epoch.&nbsp;It made possible in the West the development of
                a&nbsp;Romano-German civilization ; it facilitated the growth of&nbsp;new and
                distinct states and nationalities ;'it gave a new&nbsp;impulse to the influence of
                the Christian church, and laid&nbsp;the foundations of the power of the bishops of
                Rome.</span></p>
