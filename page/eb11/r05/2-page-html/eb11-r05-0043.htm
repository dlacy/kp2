<p><span class="font1">may be stated approximately to have been from iod. to is. per lb. The cost of collecting “ wild ” rubber is less easy to&nbsp;state with any approach to accuracy, since the cost varies in&nbsp;different districts of S. and Central America, but the average&nbsp;cost is stated not to be less than is. per lb. In Africa the cost&nbsp;of collection is much less, but the rubber is generally of inferior&nbsp;quality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The market price of commercial rubber is determined by the current price of “ fine Para ” from S. America. 'This is subject&nbsp;to considerable fluctuation, <sup>r</sup>and varied in 1900 to 1908 from&nbsp;2s. iod. to 5s. 9d. a lb. As much as 6s. 9d. per lb was given&nbsp;for specially prepared “ plantation Para.” Towards the latter&nbsp;part of 1904 the price of fine Para reached a high level and then&nbsp;considerably declined, reaching in 1907-8 a lower figure than had&nbsp;been recorded since 1900. At the beginning of 1908 the price&nbsp;gradually rose again to the neighbourhood of 4s. a lb. During&nbsp;1909, without any serious decline in production, the price rapidly&nbsp;rose, owing to extraordinary causes, to about 10s. a lb, and in&nbsp;the early part of 1910 rose to over 12s. a lb, and subsequently&nbsp;fell to about half this price. Having regard to the present cost&nbsp;of producing “ plantation ” rubber, and to the probability that,&nbsp;apart from a possible increase in the price of labour, this cost&nbsp;is susceptible of further reduction, it may be concluded that&nbsp;rubber production will continue to be profitable even should a&nbsp;considerable fall in market value take place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Principal Rubber Trees, ikeir Cultivation, and the Preparation of Rubber.—</span><span class="font1">Most commercial rubber is derived from natural supplies, from the wild rubber trees of S. and Central America,&nbsp;India and Africa. Each year, however, the output of “ plantation ” rubber will show a considerable increase, and it is to be expected that ultimately this will form the chief source of supply,&nbsp;unless unforeseen circumstances should arise to interfere with&nbsp;the development of the plantation industry, which has been&nbsp;vigorously started chiefly with European capital in the tropical&nbsp;possessions of Great Britain, France and Germany. The best&nbsp;rubber is now obtained from large trees, of which the following&nbsp;are the more important:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Para ” rubber,, which takes the first position in the market,&nbsp;is derived from species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea,</span><span class="font0"> principally </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea brasiliensis,</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;which there are enormous forests in the valleys of the Amazon and&nbsp;its tributaries, and also in Peru, Bolivia, Venezuela and Guiana.&nbsp;In Brazil alone it is stated that the rubber area amounts to at least&nbsp;one million sq. m. The tree has been recently planted with great&nbsp;success especially in Ceylon and Malaya (Plate I. figs. 11 and 12).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Ceara ” or Manitoba rubber is derived from species of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manihot,</span><span class="font0"> chiefly </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manihot Glaziovii,</span><span class="font0"> a native of S. America especially abundant in Brazil, and successfully introduced into other&nbsp;countries (Plate IT. fig. 13). The latex of this tree flows less freely&nbsp;than that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea. brasiliensis,</span><span class="font0"> and the collection of large quantities of the latex is attended with considerable difficulty. The&nbsp;latex is therefore usually, allowed to coagulate on the tree, as it&nbsp;slowly exudes from the incision. On this account it is often exported&nbsp;in strings or “ scrap ” and -not usually in biscuits or balls. Partly&nbsp;for this reason and partly because pieces of wood and dirt are apt&nbsp;to be included with the scrap, the market value of Ceara rubber is&nbsp;usually, less than that of Para. The plantations of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manihot</span><span class="font0"> established in E. Africa, Ceylon and S. India have,.however, begun to&nbsp;furnish a better quality of Ceara rubber, which is often prepared in&nbsp;biscuit form. Other species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manihot</span><span class="font0"> are also under trial, and&nbsp;some give promise of good results, especially </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">M. dichotoma</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">M. heptaphylla.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The “ Ule ” rubber of Central America and British Honduras&nbsp;originates from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castilloa elastica.</span><span class="font0"> In S. America its natural occurrence appears to be limited to west of the Andes, but the tree is&nbsp;abundant in Mexico, Guatemala and Nicaragua. The rubber comes&nbsp;into commerce in thick strips or sheets or as “ scrap.” The rubber&nbsp;is usually dark in colour and is often contaminated with proteid&nbsp;impurities derived from the latex. Ule rubber is generally inferior&nbsp;in strength to Para and commands a.lower price. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castilloa&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">tree has been experimentally planted in Ceylon, the West Indies&nbsp;and other countries (Plate II. ng. 14).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Other trees occurring in S. America which, furnish rubber of secondary commercial importance are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hancornia speciosa,</span><span class="font0"> yielding&nbsp;the Mangabcira rubber of Brazil, and species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sapium</span><span class="font0"> furnishing&nbsp;the Colombian rubber and much of the rubber, of Guiana (derived&nbsp;from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sapium Jenmani),</span><span class="font0"> which is scarcely inferior to the rubber of&nbsp;Para.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Rambong ” or Assam rubber is the produce of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ficus elastica,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">commonly known as the indiarubber tree and cultivated in. Europe&nbsp;as an ornamental plant. This tree, indigenous to Asia, attains large&nbsp;dimensions in India, Ceylon and the Malay Archipelago (Plate IL&nbsp;fig- 15)- furnishes most of the lubber of India, Sumatra and&nbsp;Java. Although intrinsically of excellent quality, Rambong rubber,&nbsp;owing to the careless method of collection practised by the natives&nbsp;which leads to the inclusion of much impurity, usually fetches a&nbsp;lower price than Para. The tree has been introduced into W.&nbsp;Africa and Egypt, but has not proved very successful in Africa as a&nbsp;rubber producer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">“ Lagos ” rubber is the produce of the African rubber tree </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fun-tumia elastica,</span><span class="font0"> which is indigenous to Africa from Uganda to W. Africa&nbsp;(Plate II. fig. 16). It is known as the silk rubber tree, probably on&nbsp;account of the silky hairs which are attached to the seeds. The&nbsp;latex, which is usually coagulated by standing or by heating, is&nbsp;obtained from incisions in the bark of the tree. The rubber is of&nbsp;good quality, though, owing to the method of preparation adopted,&nbsp;the product is often impure and discoloured, and consequently&nbsp;usually brings a lower price than the best rubbers of commerce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Besides the trees described above, a number of climbing plants&nbsp;or vines belonging to the Apocyanaceae secrete a latex which&nbsp;furnishes rubber of good quality. These vines are less satisfactory&nbsp;than trees, as rubber producers, owing to the readiness with which&nbsp;they are injured and destroyed by careless tapping, and to the&nbsp;difficulty of regulating these methods in the case of vines distributed&nbsp;over enormous areas of forest. Of these vines the most important&nbsp;are the. species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Landolphia</span><span class="font0"> which occur throughout tropical&nbsp;Africa, including the Sudan, Congo, Mozambique and Madagascar,&nbsp;the principal of which are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Landolphia owariensis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L. Heudelotii,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">common throughout W. Africa, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L. Kirkii</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L. Dawei</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;E. Africa. The rubber is obtained by incising the stems of the&nbsp;vines and coagulating the latex by exposure, by admixture with&nbsp;acid vegetable juices or by heating. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Landolphia</span><span class="font0"> rubber is usually&nbsp;roughly prepared and in consequence commands a low price. The&nbsp;vines of species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clilandra</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Carpodinus</span><span class="font0"> in W. Africa also&nbsp;furnish good rubber, as do the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Forsteroma gracilis</span><span class="font0"> of British Guiana&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Forster onia floribunda</span><span class="font0"> of Jamaica. Vines resembling Lan-dolphias are widely distributed in Asia. Amoqg these are species&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Willughbeia</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Leuconotis,</span><span class="font0"> from which much of the rubber&nbsp;exported from Borneo is derived; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Parameria glandulifera,</span><span class="font0"> common&nbsp;in Siam and Borneo, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Urceola esculenta</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cryptostegia grandi-flora,</span><span class="font0"> both common in Burma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among other sources from which rubber is commercially obtained may be mentioned the Guayule plant </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Parthenium argentatum)</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Mexico, and the “ Ecanda <sup>,r</sup> plant of Portuguese W. Africa, from&nbsp;the tuberous roots of which rubber is extracted by the natives.&nbsp;The “ Ecanda ” plant has been named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Raphionacme utilis.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;root rubber prepared by the natives of the Congo and the S. Sudan&nbsp;is extracted partly from the roots of LawzioZp/im or from the rhizomes&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Landolphia Thollonii</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Carpodinus lanceolatus.</span><span class="font0"> It is obtained&nbsp;by breaking up the roots or rhizomes in hot water and separating&nbsp;the rubber, and machines have now been devised for this purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Little is at present known of the large rubber tree of Tonkin </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Bieck-rodea tonkinensis)</span><span class="font0">, the latex of which is stated to furnish excellent rubber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sources of Commercial Rubber</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. Para rubber is so named from the Para province of Brazil,&nbsp;from the principal town of which, also known as Para, most of the&nbsp;rubber is shipped. This rubber is obtained chiefly from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea&nbsp;brasiliensis,</span><span class="font0"> Mull. Arg., a large euphorbiaceous tree upwards of&nbsp;60 ft. in height, and having trifoliate leaves, the leaflets being&nbsp;lanceolate and tapering at both ends (fig. 1). The trunk reaches&nbsp;about 8 ft. in circumference.. The flowers are usually pale green.&nbsp;The fruit is a capsule containing three seeds rather larger than&nbsp;cobnuts, having a brown smooth surface figured with black&nbsp;patches. The seeds readily lose their vitality, and on this account&nbsp;need special care in transport. They should be loosely packed in&nbsp;dry soil or charcoal. These seeds have been examined at the&nbsp;Imperial Institute, and the kernels have been found to contain&nbsp;nearly half their weight (48%) of an oil resembling linseed oil&nbsp;and applicable for the same purposes. The residue or “ cake ”&nbsp;left after expression of the oil is apparently nutritious and may&nbsp;prove to be of value for feeding animals. There is present in the&nbsp;seeds an enzyme which rapidly decomposes the oil if the seeds are&nbsp;crushed and kept, setting free a fatty acid and glycerin. As. the&nbsp;seeds are very abundant, they will probably be utilized commercially&nbsp;as soon as the demand for planting has subsided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Brazil the trees are found in different districts, but flourish best on rich alluvial clay slopes by the side of rivers, where there is a&nbsp;certain amount of drainage, and the temperature reaches from&nbsp;89° F. to 94° F. at noon and is never cooler than 73° F. at night, while&nbsp;rain falls during about six months and the soil and atmosphere are&nbsp;moist throughout the year. The genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hevea</span><span class="font0"> was formerly called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Siphonia,</span><span class="font0"> and the tree named Pao de Xerringa by the Portuguese,&nbsp;from the use by the Omaqua Indians of squirts or syringes made from&nbsp;a piece of pipe inserted in a hollow flask-shaped ball </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font0"> rubber. The&nbsp;trees are not generally tapped until they are ten to fifteen years&nbsp;old, as young trees yield inferior rubber. If carefully conducted,&nbsp;tapping does not injure the tree. The latex is collected in the&nbsp;so-called dry season between June and February. The trees are&nbsp;tapped in the early morning when the latex is most readily obtained.</span></p>
