<p><span class="font3">they may vary more or less from the type. It is an interesting fact, the full significance of which has not yet been worked out,&nbsp;that, as a rule, plants that vary profusely are those in which&nbsp;the characteristic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2X</span><span class="font3"> number of chromosomes is high (60-100).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Brief reference may be made to the cases of abnormal sexual or pseudo-sexual reproduction described above under </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Apogamy.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Taking first the cases of true apogamy, there is clearly no need&nbsp;for any sexual process, for, since no meiotic division has taken&nbsp;place, the gametophyte is diploid; its cells, whether vegetative&nbsp;or contained in female organs, possess the capacity for both&nbsp;development and the transmission of the sporophytic characters.&nbsp;It is not remarkable that such a gametophyte should be able to&nbsp;give rise directly to a sporophyte; but it is remarkable, in the&nbsp;converse case of apospory, that a sporophyte should give rise to&nbsp;a diploid gametophyte rather than to another sporophyte. In&nbsp;the latter case the tendency to the regular development of the&nbsp;alternate form appears to override the influence of the diploid&nbsp;nucleus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Turning to the various forms of pseudo-apogamy, there are first those in which fusion takes place between two apparently&nbsp;female organs (some Uredineae; Christman), and those in&nbsp;which it takes place between nuclei within the same female&nbsp;organ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Humaria,</span><span class="font3"> Blackman). If these are to be regarded&nbsp;physiologically as sexual acts, it must be inferred that the fusing&nbsp;organs or nuclei have come to differ from each other to some&nbsp;extent; for it is unthinkable that equivalent female organs or&nbsp;cells should be able to fertilize, or to be fertilized by, one another.&nbsp;There are finally those cases in which apparently vegetative&nbsp;cells take part in the sexual act, as in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Phragmidium</span><span class="font3"> (Blackman),&nbsp;where the female organ fuses with an adjacent vegetative cell,&nbsp;and in the fern-prothallium (Farmer), where the nuclei of two&nbsp;vegetative cells fuse. They would seem to indicate that vegetative cells may, in certain circumstances, contain sufficient&nbsp;germ-plasm to act as sexual organs without being differentiated&nbsp;as such.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">An interesting question is that of the origin of apogamy. It is no doubt the outcome of sexual degeneration; but this&nbsp;general statement requires some explanation. In certain cases&nbsp;apogamy seems to be the result of the degeneration of the male&nbsp;organ; as in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Humaria,</span><span class="font3"> where there is no male organ, and in&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Lachnea,</span><span class="font3"> where the male organ is rudimentary. In others,&nbsp;as in the Uredineae, it is apparently the female organ that has&nbsp;degenerated, losing its receptive part, the trichogyne; the male&nbsp;cells (spermatia) are developed normally, and there is no reason&nbsp;to believe that they might not fertilize the female organ were&nbsp;there the means of penetrating it. In yet other cases the&nbsp;degeneration occurs at a different stage in the life-history, in&nbsp;the development of the spores. In the apogamous ferns investigated, meiosis is suppressed and apogamy results. In the&nbsp;heterosporous plants which have been investigated </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g. Marsilia,&nbsp;Eu-Akkemilla)</span><span class="font3"> it has been observed that the microsporcs are&nbsp;so imperfectly developed as to be incapable of germinating, so&nbsp;that fertilization is impossible; and it is perhaps to this that&nbsp;the occurrence of apogamy is to be attributed. This abnormal&nbsp;development of the spores may bc regarded as a variation; and&nbsp;in most cases it occurs in plants that are highly variable and often&nbsp;have a high </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2x</span><span class="font3"> number of chromosomes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It will be observed that such physiological explanation as can be given of the phenomena of reproduction is based upon the&nbsp;results of the minute investigation of the changes in nuclear&nbsp;structure associated with them. The explanation is often rather&nbsp;suggested than proved, and some fundamental facts still remain&nbsp;altogether unexplained. But it may bc anticipated that a&nbsp;method of research which has already so successfully justified&nbsp;itself will not fail in the future to elucidate what still remains&nbsp;obscure.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, IN ANATOMY.—The reproductive system in some parts of its course shares structures in common with the urinary system </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font3"> In this article the&nbsp;following structures will be dealt with. In the male the testes,&nbsp;epididymis, vasa deferentia, vesiculae seminales, prostate,&nbsp;penis and urethra. In the female the ovaries, Fallopian tubes,&nbsp;uterus, vagina and vulva.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ale Reproductive Organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">testes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">qt</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> testicles</span><span class="font3"> are the glands in which the male reproductive cells are formed. They lie, one on each side, in the scrotum surrounded by the tunica vaginalis (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Coelom</span><span class="font3"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Serous Membranes).</span><span class="font3"> Each is an oval gland about one and a&nbsp;half inches long with its long axis directed downward, backward&nbsp;and inward. There is a strong fibrous coat called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tunica&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">albuginea,</span><span class="font3"> from which vertical and horizontal septa penetrate&nbsp;into the substance, thus dividing it into compartments or lobules&nbsp;in which the seminiferous tubes are coiled. It is estimated that&nbsp;the total length of these</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">seminiferous tubes in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">two glands is little short of</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a mile. (See fig. 1.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">At the posterior part of the testis the fibrous sheath is&nbsp;greatly thickened to form the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mediastinum testis,</span><span class="font3"> and contains a plexus of tubules&nbsp;called the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rete testis</span><span class="font3"> (see fig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">1), into which the seminiferous tubes open. In this way the secretion of the gland&nbsp;is carried to its upper and&nbsp;back part, whence from fifteen&nbsp;to twenty small tubes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(vasa&nbsp;efferentia)</span><span class="font3"> pass to the epididymis. Each of these is&nbsp;convoluted before opening,&nbsp;and forms what is known as&nbsp;a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">conus Vasculosus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Under the microscope the seminiferous tubules are seen</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">to consist of a basement membrane surrounding several layers of epithelial cells, some of which are constantly being transformed&nbsp;into spermatozoa or male sexual cells.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">epididymis</span><span class="font3"> (see fig. 1) is a soft body lying behind the testis; it is enlarged above to form the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">globus major </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">qt</span><span class="font3"> head, while&nbsp;below is a lesser swelling, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">globus minor</span><span class="font3"> or tail. The whole&nbsp;epididymis is made up of a convoluted tube about 20 ft.&nbsp;long, from which one long diverticulum </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(vas aberrans)</span><span class="font3"> comes off.&nbsp;Between the globus major and the testis two small vesicles&nbsp;called the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hydatids of Morgagni</span><span class="font3"> are often found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">vas deferens</span><span class="font3"> is the continuation of the tube of the epididymis and starts at the globus minor; at first it is convoluted, but soon becomes straight, and runs up on the inner (mesial)&nbsp;side of the epididymis to the external abdominal ring in the&nbsp;abdominal wall. On its way up it is joined by several other&nbsp;structures, to form the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">spermatic cord,</span><span class="font3"> these are the artery&nbsp;(spermatic) and veins </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(pampiniform plexus)</span><span class="font3"> of the testis, the&nbsp;artery of the vas, the ilio-inguinal, genito-crural and sympathetic&nbsp;nerves, and the testicular lymphatics. After entering the&nbsp;external abdominal ring, these structures pass obliquely through&nbsp;the abdominal wall, lying in the inguinal canal for an inch and a&nbsp;half, until the internal abdominal ring is reached. Here they&nbsp;separate and the vas passes down the side of the pelvis and turns</span></p>
