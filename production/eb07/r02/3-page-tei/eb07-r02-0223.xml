The apparatus for spreading the yarns on the reels consists of a rail <hi rend="italic">h',</hi>  with loops or eyes opposite to each reel : through these eyes the yarns are passed. The rail is supported by two upright rods A, A, which slide through holes in the brackets t, i. To these rods the alternating motion is given by a chain connecting them with the lever A, which is wrought by the heart-wheel <hi rend="italic">m.</hi>  Figs· 27, 28, 29, show the ar</p><lb/><p>rangement of the apparatus for twisting the strands, and laying them into a rope. <hi rend="italic">aa</hi>  the reel-frame ; <hi rend="italic">bb</hi>  the register-plate, through the concentric circles of holes of which the yarns are put. These holes are seen in the detached front-view of the plate at B. Immediately behind the plate the yarns are passed through the press-blocks, one of which is figured detached at C. They are then hung on the hooks of the sledge <hi rend="italic">cc. </hi>These hooks are on the prolonged axes of pinions driven by a spur-wheel <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>  which again is driven by the mitred wheel <hi rend="italic">e.</hi>  This wheel can be connected with either of the wheels<hi rend="italic">f </hi>and <hi rend="italic">g,</hi>  by means of a clutch wrought by the lever A. On the end of the axes of these mitre-wheels the pinion A is fixed, and receives motion from the spur-wheel Z, fixed on the axis of the gub-wheel <hi rend="italic">m.</hi>  Round the gubs of this wheel a turn of the endless band <hi rend="italic">nn,</hi>  which traverses the walk, is passed, and gives motion to the machinery. On the other end of the gub-wheel axis a pinion o is fixed, which drives the spur-wheel <hi rend="italic">p.</hi>  On the middle of the axis of this wheel another gub-wheel is fixed ; round it a turn of the ground-rope <hi rend="italic">q</hi>  is passed, and by this the sledge is moved progressively backwards : the wheels of the sledge are flanged, and run upon a railroad <hi rend="italic">τ.</hi>  When the endless band is set in motion after the yarns have been hung on the hooks of the sledge, the sledge travels backwards at a rate which may be proportioned to the twist required to be given, by the gubs of the ground-rope wheel being made to shift further from or nearer to its centre, so as to move the sledge through a greater or less space for each revolution of the hooks. When the sledge has reached the foot of the walk, the strands are hung together on the centre-hook of the wheel, and by means of the lever A the motion is reversed ; at the same time the yarns are cut over by the tackle-board, and hung on the hooks<hi rend="italic">s, s,</hi>  at the fore end. To these motion is given by the spur-wheels <hi rend="italic">t, t',</hi>  the latter of which may be driven either by the pinion <hi rend="italic">u</hi>  and spur-wheel <hi rend="italic">w,</hi>  or directly by the pinion <hi rend="italic">x,</hi>  as a quicker or slower motion is required.</p><lb/><p>To the shaft on which the pinion <hi rend="italic">x</hi>  and spur-wheel <hi rend="italic">w</hi>  are fixed, motion is given by the mitre-wheels <hi rend="italic">y, t∕, tf,</hi>  the two latter being fixed to a vertical shaft, which receives its motion from the driving power by the intervention of cones, by which that motion may be regulated.</p><p>The end of the ground-rope is wound upon the barrel 2, by unwinding from which it is slackened so as to allow it to be removed from the gubs of the sledge.    (b. s.)</p><p>ROQUE, Sτ, a city of Spain, in the province of Seville, and the partido of Gibraltar. It is about six miles from the latter fortress, and the first place beyond the Spanish lines. It stands on an elevated spot, commanding a view of the rock of Gibraltar. It contains about 1800 inhabitants, exclusive of the troops. There is'another town of the same name, with the addition of De Rumiera, in the district of Montania, in the province of Burgos, on the river Miera, containing 1250 inhabitants.</p><p>ROSA, the Rose. See the article Botany.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rosa, </hi><hi rend="italic">Salvator,</hi>  an admirable painter, was born at Naples in 1614. He was first instructed by Francesco Francazano, a kinsman ; but the death of his father reduced him to sell drawings sketched upon paper for any thing he could get. One of these happening to fall into the hands of Lanfranc, he took him under his protection, and enabled him to enter the school of Spagnoletto, and to be taught by Daniel Falcone, a distinguished painter of battles at Naples. His pieces are exceedingly scarce and valuable ; one of the best of them being that representing Saul and the witch of Endor, which was preserved at Versailles. He died in 1673 ; and as his paintings are in few hands, he is more generally known by his prints, of which he etched a great number. He painted landscapes more than history ; but his prints are chiefly historical. The principal landscape of this master is a noble picture at Chiswick. We are told that he spent the early part of his life in a troop of banditti ; and that the rocky desolate scenes in which he was accustomed to take refuge, furnished him with those romantic ideas in landscape, of which he is so exceedingly fond, and in the description of which he so greatly excels. His robbers, as his detached figures are commonly called, are supposed also to have been taken from the life.</p><p>Amongst the musical manuscripts purchased at Rome by Dr Burney, was a music-book of Salvator, in which are many airs and cantatas of different masters, and eight entire cantatas, written, set, and transcribed by this celebrated painter himself.</p><p>ROSALGATE, the most eastern point of Arabia. The coast turns to the north-west, till it joins the Persian Gulf. Long. 60. 10. E. Lat. 22. 20. N.</p><p>ROSAMOND, daughter of Walter Lord Clifford, was a young lady of exquisite beauty. The popular story of her is as follows. Henry II. saw her, loved her, declared his passion, and triumphed over her honour. To avoid the jealousy of his queen Elinor, he kept her in a wonderful labyrinth at Woodstock ; and by his connection with her had William Longsword earl of Salisbury, and Geoffrey bishop of Lincoln. On Henry’s absence in France, however, on account of a rebellion in that country, the queen found means to discover her; and, though struck with her beauty, she recalled sufficient resentment to poison her. The queen, it is said, discovered her apartment by a thread of silk ; but how she came by it is differently related. This popular story is not however supported by history. She was buried in the church of Godstow, opposite to the high altar, where her body remained till it was ordered to be removed with every mark of disgrace by Hugh bishop of Lincoln in 1191. She was, however, considered as a saint after her death.</p><p>ROSAS, a fortified city of Spain, in the province of Catalonia, and district of Gerona.
