is the name of one of the Ceyloneſe deities, who commands and governs all the reft, and formerly anſwered the prayers of his worſhippers; but according to the fabulous account which is given of him, the golden chair, on which he ſat, and the foot of which was made of wax, that was ſoftened by their prayers and tears, and ſunk downward, ſo that he could take notice of their requeſts and relieve them, being diſpoſed of among the poor, they no longer derive any benefit from him, or pay him any reverence.
