The comparative cost of the different modes of transit is, under all circumstances, strongly in favour of railways. For instance, in waggons travelling 2½ miles an hour, the cost of each ton, per mile, for goods, is about 7¾d., of which nearly 3d. is the cost of horsing. In vans travelling at 4 miles an hour with lighter goods, the expense is nearly Is. per ton, per mile, the horsing costing rather above 4d. of this sum. The expenses of four-horse stage coaches, vary from L.4 to L.5 per lunar month, per double mile, according as their rate of travelling varies from 8 to 10 miles an hour ; their hire and repairs cost 2½d. per double mile ; the duty is 3d. per double mile ; and the horsing is 2s. The coachman and guard are seldom paid except by the passengers, say 10s. 6d. per week for them at the outside; and for tolls and incidental charges 6d. per mile; being a large allowance. The tolls on the Holyhead road, one of the best in England, are not quite 4d. per mile, for
a four-horse coach. This gives Is. 9d. expenses per single mile, while the returns will be 2s. 6d. per mile. From this calculation we have excluded the charge for parcels, &c., leaving it to go, with the allowance for incidentals, to the support of the office establishments. The coaches which ran between Birmingham and London, prior to the opening of the railway, charged L.2, 10s. inside, and L.l, 10s. outside, the distance being 108 miles, and after the opening, L.l, 10s. inside, and 17s. out. Our computation of coach profits we know is under the mark. The cost of this mode of travelling is about 3d. per passenger per mile, or 3s. per ton, taking 12 passengers and their luggage to a ton. In canal carriage, the cost varies from 3d. to 5d. per ton per mile, in the fly boats going at the rate of 4 miles an hour ; and by slow boats, from l¼d. to 2d. per ton per mile, at the rate of 2½ miles an hour. The passenger boats, going 10 miles an hour, charge from Id. to l¼d. per passenger, per
mile, or from Is. to Is. 3d. per ton of passengers, per mile.
The cost of carriage by railways worked with horses, is from l½d. to 2d. per ton, per mile, for heavy, and 3d. to 3½d. for light goods, and from Id. to l½d. per passenger, per mile, or from Is. to Is. 6d. per ton of passengers, per mile. Those worked by locomotives charge about the same for goods, and rather more for passengers, or from l½d. to 2½d. per mile on an average. These latter charges however are too high. The resistance by the several modes of transit, is for railways, 8lbs. per ton ; canals, 2¾lbs. per ton, at 2½ miles velocity, 7 lbs. at 4 miles, 40 lbs. at 9 miles, and 60 lbs. at
11 miles, which is the greatest hitherto attained. Turnpike roads’ waggons, 76lbs. ; vans, 71 lbs. at the before mentioned velocities ; and coaches, 80 to 88 lbs. at from 8 to 10 miles an hour.
In whatever light we view the question, no other mode of transit can be put in competition with railroads, except
