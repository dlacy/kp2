At the end of one of thoſe fits, of which the gentlemen of the committee were witneſſes, he was affected with vomitings ; but he is always ſoon reſtored.</p><p>‘‘ When he is awaked, he never for the moſt part recollects any of the actions he has been doing during the fit.</p><p>“ The ſubject of his dreams is circumſcribed in a ſmall circle of objects, that relate to the few ideas with which at his age his mind is furniſhed ; ſuch as his leſſons, the church, the bells, and eſpecially tales of ghoſts. It is ſufficient to ſtrike his imagination the evening before a fit with ſome tale, to direct his ſomnambuliſm towards the object of it. There was read to him while in this ſituation the ſtory of a robber ; he imagined the very next moment that he ſaw robbers in the room. However, as he is much diſpoſed to dream that he is ſurrounded with them, it cannot be affirmed that this was an effect of the reading. It is obſerved, that when his ſupper has been more plentiful than uſual, his dreams are more dismal.</p><p>“ In their report, the gentlemen of the committee dwell much on the ſtate of this young man’s ſenſes, on the impreſſion made upon them by ſtrange objects, and on the life they are of to him.</p><p>“ A bit of ſtrong ſmelling wood produced in him a degree of reſtleſſneſs ; the fingers had the ſame effect, whether from their ſmell or their tranſpiration. He knew wine in which there was wormwood by the ſmell, and ſaid that it was not wine for his table. Metals make no impreſſion on him.</p><p>“ Having been preſented with a little common wine while he was in a ſtate of apathy, and all his motions were performed with languor, he drank oſ it willingly ; but the irritation which it occaſioned produced a deal of vivacity in all his words, motions, and actions, and cauſed him to make involuntary grimaces.</p><p>“ Once he was obſerved dreſſing himſelf in perfect darkneſs. His clothes were on a large table, mixed with thoſe of ſome other perſons ; he immediately perceived this, and complained of it much ; at laſt a ſmall light was brought, and then he dreſſed himſelf with ſufficient preciſion. If he is teaſed or gently pinched, he is always ſenſible of it, except he is at the time ſtrongly engroſſed with ſome other thing, and wiſhes to ſtrike the offender ; however, he never attacks the perſon who has done the ill, but an ideal being whom his imagination preſents to him, and whom he purſues thro’ the chamber without running againſt the furniture, nor can the perdons whom he meets in his way divert him from his purſuit.</p><p>“ While his imagination was employed on various ſubjects, he heard a clock ſtrike, which repeated at every ſtroke the note of the cuckoo. There are cuckoos here, ſaid he ; and, upon being deſired, he imitated the ſong of that bird immediately.</p><p>“ When he wiſhes to ſee an object, he makes an effort to lift his eyelids ; but they are ſo little under his command, that he can hardly raiſe them a line or two, while he draws up his eyebrows ; the iris at that time appears fixed, and his eye dim. When any thing is preſented to him, and he is told of it, he always half opens his eyes with a degree of difficulty, and then shuts them after he has taken what was offered to him.</p><p>“ The report infers ſrom theſe facts, and from many</p><p>others relative to the different ſenſes, that their functions are not ſuſpended as to what the sleep-walker wiſhes to ſee, that is, as to all thoſe perceptions which accord with the objects about which his imagination is occupied ; that he may alſo be diſpoſed to receive thoſe impreſſions, when his imagination has no other object at the time ; that in order to ſee, he is obliged to open his eyes as much as he can, but when the impreſſion is once made, it remains ; that objects may ſtrike his fight without ſtriking his imagination, if it is not intereſted in them ; and that he is ſometimes informed of the preſence of objects without either ſeeing or touching them.</p><p>“ Having engaged him to write a theme, ſay the committee, we ſaw him light a candle, take pen, ink, and paper, from the drawer of his table, and begin to write, while his maſter dictated. As he was writing, we put a thick paper before his eyes, notwithſtanding which he continued to write and to form his letters very diſtinctly ; ſhowing ſigns, however, that ſomething was incommoding him, which apparently proceeded from the obſtruction which the paper, being held too near his noſe, gave to his reſpiration.</p><p>“ Upon another occasion, the young ſomnambuliſt aroſe at five o’clock in the morning, and took the neceſſary materials for writing, with his copy-book. He meant to have begun at the top of a page ; but finding it already written on, he came to the blank part of the leaf, and wrote ſome time from the following words, <hi rend="italic">Fiunt ignari pigritia-ils deviennent ignorans par la pareſſe ; </hi>and, what is remarkable, after ſeveral lines he perceived he had forgot the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> in the word <hi rend="italic">ignorans,</hi> and had put erroneously a double <hi rend="italic">r</hi> in <hi rend="italic">pareſſe ;</hi> he then gave over writing, to add the <hi rend="italic">s</hi> he had forgot, and to eraſe the ſuperfluous r.</p><p>“ Another time he had made, oſ his own accord, a piece of writing, in order, as he ſaid, to pleaſe his maſter. It conſiſted of three kinds of writing, text, half text, and ſmall writ ; each of them performed with the proper pen. He drew, in the corner of the ſame paper, the figure of a hat ; he then aſked for a penknife to take out a blot of ink which he had made between two letters, and he eraſed it without injuring them. Laſtly, he made ſome arithmetical calculations with great accuracy.</p><p>“ In order to explain ſome of the facts obſerved by the academicians which we have here mentioned, they eſtabliſh two general obſervations, which reſult from what they have ſaid with reſpect to the ſenſes and the dreams of this sleep-walker.</p><p>“ 1. That he is obliged to open his eyes, in order to recogniſe objects which he wiſhes to ſee ; but the impreſſion once made, although rapidly, is vivid enough to ſuperſede the neceſſity of his opening them again, to view the ſame objects anew ; that is, the ſame objects are afterwards preſented to his imagination with as much force and preciſion as if he actually ſaw them.</p><p>“ 2. That his imagination, thus warmed, repreſents to him objects, and ſuch as he figures to himſelf, with as much vivacity as if he really ſaw them ; and, laſtly, that all his ſenſes, being ſubordinate to his imagination, ſeem concentrated in the object with which it is occupied, and have at that time no perception of any thing but what relates to that object.</p><p>“ Theſe two cauſes united ſeem to them ſufficient</p></body></text></TEI>
