Thus, that popular jealouſy which in every pe-riod of the revolution has ſtrikingly marked the French character, was kept on the alarm. On the 18th of A-pril, therefore, when the royal Family was preparing to go to St Cloud to pafs ſome days, a report was inſtant-ly ſpread that the king was about to fly from the country. The carriages were immediately ſurrounded by •people. La Fayette drew out the national guard, but they refuſed to act. " WC know (exclaimed they) that we are violating the laws, but the ſafety of our country is the ſirſt law.” The King inſtantly went to the affembly, and with much ſpirit complained of the inſult. He was anſwered reſpectſully by the preſident, and continued bis journey. As the royal family had enjoyed a conſiderable degree of freedom for ſome time paſt, which was demonſtrated by the unſucceſsful oppo-ſition made to this journey—the preſent opportunity was embraced for intimating to foreign courts his ac-ceptance of the conſtitution ; and ali obnoxious perſons were difmiſſed from about his perſon. The breach of diſeipline on the part of the national guard on this occaſion was ſo much reſented by La Fayette, that he reſigned his command. Paris was thrown into conſternation ; and it was not till after the moſt univerſal ſolicitation that he was prevailed upon to refume his</p><p>office.</p><p>About this time M. de Bouille, to whom the protection of the frontiers was entruſted, was employing, as it is now ſaid, every means in his power to render the country defencelefs. The garriſons were left unprovided ; diffunion was ſpread among the national troops; they were removed ſrom the frontiers, and their place was occupied by foreigners, wherever it could be done. The emigrants abroad, and their friends at home, were lying in wait for an opportunity of revolt ;—when ſuddenly, on the 2 iſt of June, it was announced from the Thuilleries, that the king, the queen, the dauphin, with monſieur and madame, had quitted the palace and the capital, without leaving any information of thcir inten-tion or their route. The emotion excited by this news among the multitude was a mixture of conſternation and rage. The national affembly, however, acted with much coolneſs. They inſtantly took upon themſelves the government, and decreed their fittings permanent. They ſent meffengers, at the ſame time, in all directions, to attempt to lay hold of the fugitives. Theſe had taken different routs. Monſieur and madame arrived ſaſely at Bruſſels on the 23d. The king, queen, and their children, when they came to a conſiderable diſtance from the capital, were furniſhed by Bouille with a guard of dragoons, under pretencc of protecting treaſure for the pay of the troops. At the diſtance of 156 miles, and when only a few leagues from the frontiers, they were arreſted at St Menehould by the poſtmaſter, M. Drouet, formerly a dragoon in the regiment of Condé. At half paſt feven o’clock in the evening the carriages ſtopt to change horſes at his houſe ; he thought he recollected the queen, and ima-gined that the king’s face reſembled the impreffions ſtamped upon affignats. The eſeort of dragoons in-creaſed the ſuſpicion. He ſuffered them to depait at</p><p>U o'clock without notice; hut taking a çmnpmiitm with him, he went by a ſhorter road to Varenneai with the affiſtance oſ the poſtmaſter there he gave the alarm, and overturned a carriage on the bridge, which detained the royal travellers till the national guard of the place had aſſembled, and the arreſt was effected without bloodſhed. They were brought back to Pa-ris by a deputation from the aſſembly. At his depar-ture, the king had imprudently left behind him a me-morial, in which he declared, that he never had thought any ſacrifice too great for the reſtoration of order ; but that the deſtruction of the kingdom, and the triumph of anarchy, being the only reward of all his efforts, he thought it neceſſary to depart from it. He then takes a review of the faults of the new conſtitution, the grievances he has ſuffered ; and proteſts againſt every thing that he had been compelled to do during his cap-tivity.</p><p>Different parties were very differently affected by this ill-conducted and unfortunate flight of the King. A ſmall republican party had already begun to appear, and during the king’s abſence, attempts were made to induce the public at large to conſider the royal au-thority as no neceffary part of a free conſtitution. But the minds of men were by no means prepared for the re-ception of this new doctrine. The idea, however, ha· ving been thus publicly propoſed, left ſome impreffions, which in time contributed to give riſe to important events. By ſar the greater number of leading men, however, were at preſent convinced, that it was impoffible to conduct a great empire like France, well and pro-ſperouſly, without the aſſiſtance of an hereditary chief. They therefore determined to paſs over the affair with as much ſilence as poffible, and to haften the period when their new conſtitution ſhould be complete. But there is reaſon to believe, that this journey was at the long-run highly inſtrumental in producing very fatal effects to tbe perfonal ſafety oſ the monarch.</p><p>His flight ſeemed a ſignal for emigration. Many of the ariſtocratic party ſent in reſignations of their feats in the national aſſembly. Troops were levied on the frontiers in the King’s name ; who took care, however, to diſavow any connection with ſuch a procedure. Bouille emigrated, and afterwards ſent to the aſſembly a furious threatening letter : " You ſhall anſwer (fays he) ſor the lives of the king and of the queen to all the monarchs of the univerſe. Touch but a ſingle hair of their heads, and not one ſtone ſhall be left upon ano-ther in Paris. I know the roads. I will conduct the foreign armies. This letter is but the forerunner of the manifeſto of the ſovereigns of Europe.”</p><p>A conſiderable calm throughout France followed theſe events, and it might be regarded as in a ſtate of tranquillity. It contained, indeed, parties entertaining much animoſity againſt each other, and many citizens had withdrawn to foreign countries ; but the peace was not broken, and moderate men hoped that much proſperity would follow from the late agitations. But this calm was deluſive ; and in the midſt of it thoſe projects were formed which were afterwards to prove ſo fatal to the peace of France and of Europe. Towards the cloſe of this ſummer, a convention took place at Pilnitz in Saxony between the emperor Leopold and the king of Pruffia. Its object was not known at the time, but it gradually came into view, and is now by many under-</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
