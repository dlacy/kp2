<p><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font0">bolt </span><span class="font1">at </span><span class="font0">its inner end. We have been thus particular on this joint, becauſe it is here that the ultimate ſtrain of the whole roof is exerted, and its ſituation will&nbsp;not allow the excavation neceſſary for making it a good&nbsp;mortiſe and tenon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Similar attention muft be paid to ſome other ſtraps, ſuch as thoſe which embrace the middle of the rafter,&nbsp;and connect it with the poſt or truſs below it. We&nbsp;muſt attend to the change of ſhape produced by the&nbsp;ſagging of the roof, and place the ſtrap in ſuch a manner as to yield to it by turning round its bolt, but ſo&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">as </span><span class="font0">not to become looſe, and far leſs to make a fulcrum&nbsp;for any thing acting as a lever. The ſtrains ariſing from&nbsp;ſuch actions, in framings of carpentry which change&nbsp;their ſhape by ſagging, are enormous, and nothing can&nbsp;reſiſt them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We ſhall cloſe this part of the ſubject with a Ample ï method, by which any carpenter, without mathematical ſcience, may calculate with ſuſſicient preciſion the&nbsp;ſtrains or thruſts which are produced on any point of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">his work, whatever be the obliquity of the pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let it be required to find the horizontal thruſt acting on the tie-beam AD of fig. 18. This will be the ſame as if the weight of the whole roof were laid at G&nbsp;on the two rafters GA and GD. Draw the vertical&nbsp;linc GH. Then, having calculated the weight of the&nbsp;whole roof that is ſupported by this ſingle frame&nbsp;ABCD, including the weight of the pieces AB, BC,&nbsp;CD, BE, CF themſelves, take the number of pounds,&nbsp;tons, &amp;c. which expreſſes it from any ſcale of equal&nbsp;parts, and ſet it from G to H. Draw HK, HL parallel to GD, GA, and draw the line KL, which will&nbsp;be horizontal when the two ſides of the roof have the&nbsp;ſame ſlope. Then ML meaſured on the ſame ſcale&nbsp;will give the horizontal thruſt, by which the ſtrength&nbsp;of the tie-beam is to be regulated. GL will give the&nbsp;thruſt which tends to cruſh the rafters, and LM will&nbsp;alio give the force which tends to cruſh the ſtrut-beam&nbsp;BC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In like manner, to find the ſtrain on the king-poſt BD of fig. 17. confider that each brace is preſſed by&nbsp;half the weight of the roofing laid on BA or BC, and&nbsp;this preſſure, or at leaſt its hurtful effect, is diminiſhed&nbsp;in the proportion of BA to DA, becauſe the action of&nbsp;gravity is vertical, and the effect which we want to counteract by the braces is in a direction E </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> perpendicular to&nbsp;BA or BC. But as this is to be reſiſted by the brace&nbsp;∕E acting in the direction/E, we muſt draw</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſe</span><span class="font0"> perpendicular to E </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font0"> and ſuppoſe the ſtrain augmented in&nbsp;the proportion of E </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> to Ey<sup>r</sup>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having thus obtained in tons, pounds, or other mea-ſures, the ſtrains which muſt be balanced at /by the co-heſion of the king-poſt, take this meaſure fιom the ſcale of equal parts, and ſet it off in the directions of&nbsp;the braces to G and H, and complete the parallelogram&nbsp;G/HK; and ∕K meaſured on the ſame ſcale will be&nbsp;the ſtrain on the king-poſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The artiſt may then examine the ſtrength of his ■ truſs upon this principle, that every ſquare inch of oak&nbsp;will bear at an average 7000 pounds compreſſing or&nbsp;ſtretching it, and may be ſafely loaded with 3j00 for&nbsp;any length of time ; and that a ſquare inch of fir will&nbsp;in like manner ſecurely bear 2500. And, becauſe&nbsp;ſtraps are uſed to reſiſt ſome of theſe ſtrains, a ſquare&nbsp;inch of well wrought tough iron may be ſafely ſtrained&nbsp;by </span><span class="font1">50,000 </span><span class="font0">pounds. But the artiſt will always recollect, that we cannot have the ſame confidence in iron&nbsp;as in timber. The faults of this laſt are much more&nbsp;eafily perceived ; and when timber is too weak, it&nbsp;gives us warning of its failure, by yielding ſenſibly before it breaks. This is not the caſe with iron ; and&nbsp;much of its ſervice depends on the honeſty of the blacſk-ſmith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this way may any deſign of a roof be examined. We ſhall here give the reader a ſketch of two or three&nbsp;truffed roofs, which have been executed in the chief&nbsp;varieties of circumſtances which occur in common practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 22. is the roof of St Paul’s Church, Covent Garden, London, the work of Inigo Jones. Its conſtruction is ſingular. Tlιe roof extends to a conſiderable diſtance&nbsp;beyond the building, and the ends of the tie-beams&nbsp;ſupport the Tuſean corniche, appearing like the nιu-tules of the Doric order. Such a- roof could not reft&nbsp;on the tie-beam. Inigo Jones has therefore ſupported&nbsp;it by a truſs below it ; and the height has allowed him&nbsp;to make this extremely ſtrong with very little timber.&nbsp;It is accounted the higheſt roof of its width in London. But this was not difficult, by reaſon of the great&nbsp;height which its extreme width allowed him to employ&nbsp;without hurting the beauty of it by too high a pitch.&nbsp;The ſupports, however, are diſpoſed with judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 23. is a kirb or manſaid roof by Price, and ſuppoſed to be of large dimenſions, having braces to carry the middle of the rafters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will ſerve exceedingly well for a church having pillars. The middle part of the tie-beam being taken&nbsp;away, the ſtrains are very well balanced, ſo that there&nbsp;is no riſk of its puſhing alide the pillars on which it&nbsp;reſts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 24. is the celebrated roof of the theatre of the univerſityof Oxford, by Sir Chriſtopher Wren. The ſpan&nbsp;between the walls is 75 feet. This is accounted a very&nbsp;ingenious, and is a ſingular performance. The middle part&nbsp;of it is almoſt unchangeable in its form; but from this·&nbsp;circumſtance it does not diſtribute the horizontal thruſt&nbsp;with the ſame regularity as the uſual conſtruction.&nbsp;The horizontal thruſt on the tie-beam is about twice&nbsp;the weight of the roof, and is withſtood by an iron&nbsp;ſtrap below the beam, which ſtretches the whole width&nbsp;of the building in the form of a rope, making part of&nbsp;the ornament of the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In all the roofs which we have conſidered hitherto the thruſt is diſcharged entirely from the walls by the&nbsp;tie-beam. But this cannot always be done. We frequently want great elevation within, and arched ceilings. In ſuch caſes, it is a much more difficult matter&nbsp;to keep the walls free of all preſſure outwards, and&nbsp;there are few buildings where it is completely done.&nbsp;Yet this is the greateſt fault of a roof. We ſhall juſt&nbsp;point out the methods which may be molt ſueceſsfully&nbsp;adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have ſaid that a tie-beam juſt perſorms the office of a ſtring. We have ſaid the ſame of the king-poſt. Now ſuppoſe two rafters AB, BC (fig. 25.} moveable about the joint B, and reſting on the top of&nbsp;the walls. If the line BD be ſuſpended from B, and&nbsp;the two lines DA, DC be faſtened to the feet of the&nbsp;rafters, and if theſe lines be incapable of extenſion, it&nbsp;is plain that all thruſt is removed from the walls as ef-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
