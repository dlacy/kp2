 in botany: A genus of the digynia order, belonging to the triandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 4th order, <hi rend="italic">Gramina.</hi> The calyx is a glume of two leaves, which are oppoſite to one another, erect, linear, pointed, and leſs than the corolla. The corolla conſiſts of two valves, the exterior of which ends in a beard. There are four ſpecies, the <hi rend="italic">villoſum, orientale, creticum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cereale</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">villoſum,</hi> or wood rye-graſs, is diſtinguiſhed by a calyx with wedge-ſhaped ſcales, and by the fringe of the glume being wooly. The glumes of the <hi rend="italic">orientale</hi> are ſhaggy, and the ſcales of the calyx ſhaped like an awl. The glumes of the <hi rend="italic">creticum</hi> are fringed on the outſide. The <hi rend="italic">cereale,</hi> or common rye, has glumes with rough fringes. It is a native of the iſland of Candia, was introduced into England many ages ago, and is the only ſpecies of rye cultivated in this kingdom. There are, however, two varieties, the winter and ſpring rye.</p><p>The winter rye, which is larger in the grain than the ſpring rye, is ſown in autumn at the ſame time with wheat, and ſometimes mixed with it; but as the rye ripens ſooner than the wheat, this method muſt be very exceptionable. The ſpring rye is ſown along with the oats, and uſually ripens as ſoon as the winter rye; but the grain produced is lighter, and it is therefore ſeldom ſown except where the autumnal crop has failed.</p><p>Rye is commonly ſown on poor, dry, limeſtone, or</p><p>ſandy ſoils, where wheat will not thrive. By continuing to ſow it on ſuch a ſoil for two or three years, it will at length ripen a month earlier than that which has been raiſed for years on ſtrong cold ground.</p><p>Rye is commonly uſed for bread either alone or mixed with wheat. This mixture is called <hi rend="italic">meſlin,</hi> and was formerly a very common crop in ſome parts of Britain. Mr Marſhall tells us, that the farmers in Yorkſhire believe that this mixed crop is never affected by mildew, and that a ſmall quantity of rye ſown among wheat will prevent this deſtructive diſeaſe. Rye is much uſed for bread in ſome parts of Sweden and Norway by the poor people. About a century ago rye-bread was alſo much uſed in England; but being made of a black kind of rye, it was of the ſame colour, clammy, very detergent, and conſequently not ſo nouriſhing as wheat.</p><p>Rye is ſubject to a diſeaſe which the French call <hi rend="italic">ergot,</hi> and the Engliſh <hi rend="italic">horned rye;</hi> which ſometimes happens when a very hot ſummer ſucceeds a rainy ſpring. According to Tiſſot, horned rye is ſuch as ſuffers an irregular vegetation in the middle ſubſtance between the grain and the leaf, producing an excreſcence of a browniſh colour, about an inch and a half long, and two-tenths of an inch broad. Bread made of this kind of rye has a nauſeous acrid taſte, and produces ſpaſmodic and gangrenous diſorders. In 1596, an epidemic diſeaſe prevailed in Heſſe, which the phyſicians aſcribed to bread made of horned rye. Some, we are told, were ſeized with an epilepſy, and theſe ſeldom ever recovered; others became lunatic, and continued ſtupid the reſt of their lives: thoſe who apparently-recovered had annual returns of their diſorder in January and February; and the diſeaſe was ſaid to be contagious at lead in a certain degree. The facts which we have now mentioned are taken from a work of Tiffot, which was never printed. The ſame diſeaſe was occaſioned by the uſe of this bread in ſeveral parts of the continent in the years 1648, 1675, 1702, 1716, 1722, and 1736; and has been very minutely deſcribed by Hoffman, A. O. Goelicke, Vater Burghart, and J. A. Srink.</p><p>In the year 1709, one fourth part of all the rye raiſed in the province of Salonia in France was horned, and the ſurgeon to the hoſpital of Orleans had no leſs than 500 patients under his care that were diſtempered by eating it: They were called <hi rend="italic">ergots,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">ergot</hi><note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> <hi rend="italic">Ergot</hi> is French for a cock’s ſpur, and horned rye was called <hi rend="italic">ergot</hi> from the reſemblance of its excreſcence to that pact,</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a),</hi> the French name for horned rye; they confined chiefly of men and boys, the number of women and girls being very ſmall. The firſt ſymptom was a kind of drunkenneſs, then the local diſorder began in the toes, and thence extended ſometimes to the thigh, and the trunk itſelf, even after amputation, which is a good argument againſt that operation before the gangrene is ſtopped.</p><p>In the year 1710, the celebrated Fontenelle deſcribes a caſe in the Hiſtory of the Academy of Sciences of France, which exactly reſembles that of the poor family at Wattiſham. A peaſant at Blois, who had eaten horned rye in bread, was ſeized with a mortification, which firſt cauſed all the toes of one foot to fall off,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0231.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s02-0225"/>
then the toes of the other, afterwards the remainder of the feet, and, laſtly, it eat off the fleſh of both his legs and thighs, leaving the bones bare.</p><p>Horned rye is not only hurtful to man, but to other animals; it has been known to deſtroy even the flies that ſettled upon it; ſheep, dogs, deer, geeſe, ducks, ſwine, and poultry, that were fed with it for experiment, died miſerably, ſome convulſed, others mortified and ulcerated.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
