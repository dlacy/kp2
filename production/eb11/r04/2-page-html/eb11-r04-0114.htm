        <p><span class="font1">of the Romans asserted itself in the face of these crushing
                misfortunes. In 212 Syracuse was recovered; in 211&nbsp;Capua fell after a long
                siege which Hannibal failed&nbsp;to raise, even by his famous march up to the gates
                of Rome,&nbsp;and in the same year a coalition was formed in Greece
            against</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Philip V. of Macedon, which effectually paralysed his offensive
                action. Hannibal was now confined to Lucania and Bruttium;&nbsp;and his brother
                Hasdrubal, marching from Spain to join him,&nbsp;was defeated and slain on the river
                Mctaurus (207).&nbsp;The war in Italy was now virtually ended, for,
                though&nbsp;during four years more Hannibal stood at bay in a corner of</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Bruttium, he was powerless to prevent the restoration of Roman
                authority throughout the peninsula. Sicily was once more&nbsp;secure; and finally in
                206, the year after the victory&nbsp;on the Metaurus, the successes of the young P.
                Scipio&nbsp;in Spain (2ri-6) were crowned by the complete&nbsp;expulsion of the
                Carthaginians from the peninsula. On his&nbsp;return from Spain Scipio eagerly urged
                an immediate invasion&nbsp;of Africa. The senate hesitated; but Scipio
                gained&nbsp;the day. He was elected consul for 205, and given&nbsp;the province of
                Sicily, with permission to cross into Africa&nbsp;if he thought fit. Voluntary
                contributions of men, money, and&nbsp;supplies poured in to the support of the
                popular hero; and&nbsp;by the end of 205 Scipio had collected in Sicily a
                sufficient&nbsp;force for his purpose. In 204 he crossed to Africa,&nbsp;where he
                was welcomed by the Numidian prince&nbsp;Massinissa, whose friendship he had made
                in</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Spain. In 203 he twice defeated the Carthaginian forces, and a large
                party at Carthage were anxious to accept&nbsp;his offer of negotiations. But the
                advocates of resistance&nbsp;triumphed.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Hannibal was recalled from Italy, and returned to fight his last
                battle against Rome at Zama, where Scipio, who had&nbsp;been continued in command as
                proconsul for 202 by a&nbsp;special vote of the people, won a complete
                victory.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The war was over. The Roman assembly voted that the Carthaginian
                request for peace should be granted, and entrusted the settlement of the terms to
                Scipio and a commission of ten senators. Carthage was allowed to retain
                her&nbsp;territory in Africa; but she undertook to wage no wars&nbsp;outside Africa,
                and none inside without the consent of Rome.&nbsp;She surrendered all her ships but
                ten triremes, her elephants,&nbsp;and all prisoners of war, and agreed to pay an
                indemnity of&nbsp;10,000 talents in fifty years. The Numidian
                Massinissa&nbsp;(g.tf.) was rewarded by an increase of territory, and
                was&nbsp;enrolled among the “ allies and friends” of the
            Roman&nbsp;people.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The battle of Zama decided the fate of the West. The power of
                Carthage was broken and her supremacy passed to Rome.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Henceforth Rome had no rival to fear westward of Italy, and it rested
                with herself to settle within what&nbsp;limits her supremacy should be confined and
                what form&nbsp;it should take. For the next fifty years, however, Rome&nbsp;was too
                deeply involved in the affairs of the East to think of&nbsp;extending her rule far
                beyond the limits of the rich&nbsp;inheritance which had fallen to her by the
                defeat&nbsp;of Carthage; but within this area considerable advance was&nbsp;made in
                the organization and consolidation of her rule. In&nbsp;Sicily and Spain, the
                immediate establishment of a Roman&nbsp;government was imperatively necessary, if
                these&nbsp;possessions were not either to fall a prey to internal&nbsp;anarchy, or
                be recovered for Carthage by some second</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Hamilcar. Accordingly, we find that in Sicily the former dominions of
                Hiero were at once united with the western&nbsp;half of the island as a single
                    province,@@<sup>1</sup> and that in Spain,&nbsp;after nine years of a
                provisional government (206-197),&nbsp;two provinces were in 197@@<sup>2</sup>
                definitely established,&nbsp;and each, like Sicily, assigned to one of the
                praetors&nbsp;for the year, two additional praetors being elected for the</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font1">purpose. But here the resemblance between the two cases ends.
                    From 201 down to the outbreak of the Slave&nbsp;War in 136 there was unbroken
                    peace in Sicily, and&nbsp;its part in the history is limited to its
                    important&nbsp;functions in supplying Rome with corn and in
                    provisioning&nbsp;and clothing the Roman legions.@@<sup>3</sup> It became every
                    year a more&nbsp;integral part of Italy; and a large proportion even of the
                    land&nbsp;itself passed gradually into the hands of enterprising
                    Roman&nbsp;speculators. The governors of the two Spains had very&nbsp;different
                    work to do from that which fell to the lot of the&nbsp;Sicilian praetors. The
                    condition of Spain required that year&nbsp;after year the praetors should be
                    armed with the consular&nbsp;authority, and backed by a standing force of four
                    legions, while&nbsp;more than once the presence of the consuls themselves
                    was&nbsp;found necessary. Still, in spite of all difficulties, the work&nbsp;of
                    pacification proceeded. To M. Porcius Cato, the censor, and&nbsp;to Tiberius
                    Sempronius Gracchus (praetor and propraetor, 180-79), father of the two
                    tribunes, is mainly&nbsp;due the credit of quieting the Celtiberian tribes
                    of&nbsp;central Spain, and the government of Gracchus was followed&nbsp;by
                    thirty years of comparative tranquillity. The insurrection&nbsp;headed by
                    Viriathus in 149 was largely caused by exactions of the Roman magistrates
                    themselves, while&nbsp;its obstinate continuance down to the capture of
                    Numantia,&nbsp;in 133, was almost as much the result of the incapacity&nbsp;of
                    the Roman commanders.@@<sup>4</sup> But the re-settlement of&nbsp;the country by
                    Scipio Africanus the younger in that year left&nbsp;all Spain, with the
                    exception of the highland Astures and&nbsp;Cantabri in the north-west, finally
                    and tranquilly subject to&nbsp;Rome. Roman traders and speculators flocked to
                    the seaport towns and spread inland. The mines became centres&nbsp;of Roman
                    industry; the Roman legionaries quartered in&nbsp;Spain year after year married
                    Spanish wives, and when&nbsp;their service was over gladly settled down in Spain
                    in preference to returning to Italy. The first Roman communities established
                    outside Italy were both planted in&nbsp;Spain; and both owed their existence to
                    the Roman&nbsp;legions.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">In Africa there was no question at first of the introduction of
                    Roman government by the formation of a province (see&nbsp;</span><span

                    class="font1"> Carthage, bound hand and foot by&nbsp;the treaty of 201, was
                    placed under the jealous watch&nbsp;of the loyal prince of Numidia, who himself
                    willingly&nbsp;acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome. But it was&nbsp;impossible
                    for this arrangement to be permanent.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Every symptom of reviving prosperity at Carthage was regarded at
                    Rome with feverish anxiety, and neither the&nbsp;expulsion of Hannibal in 195
                    nor his death in 183 did&nbsp;much to check the growing conviction that
                    Rome&nbsp;would never be secure while her rival existed. It was&nbsp;therefore
                    with grim satisfaction that many in the Roman senate&nbsp;watched the increasing
                    irritation of the Carthaginians under the&nbsp;harassing raids and encroachments
                    of their favoured neighbour&nbsp;Massinissa, and waited for the moment when
                    Carthage should,&nbsp;by some breach of the conditions imposed upon her,
                    supply&nbsp;Rome with a pretext for interference. At last in 151&nbsp;came the
                    news that Carthage, in defiance of treaty&nbsp;obligations, was actually at war
                    with Massinissa. The anti-Carthaginan party in the senate, headed by M. Porcius
                    Cato,&nbsp;eagerly seized the opportunity, and war was declared,
                    and&nbsp;nothing short of the destruction of their city itself was
                    demanded&nbsp;from the despairing Carthaginians. The demand was
                    refused,&nbsp;and in 149 the siege of Carthage begun. During the next
                    two&nbsp;years little progress was made, but in 147 P. Cornelius&nbsp;Scipio
                    Aemilianus, grandson by adoption of the conqueror of Hannibal; was, at the age
                    of thirty-seven, and though</span></p>
