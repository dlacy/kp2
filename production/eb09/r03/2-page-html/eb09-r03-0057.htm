        <p><span class="font1">cipia, were allowed a large measure of local self-government. In all
                we find local assemblies, senates, and magistrates, to whose hands the ordinary
                routine of local&nbsp;administration was confided, and, in spite of differences
                in&nbsp;detail, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> in the titles and numbers of the
                magistrates,&nbsp;the same type of constitution prevailed throughout.@@<sup>1</sup>
                But&nbsp;these local authorities were carefully subordinated to the&nbsp;higher
                powers in Rome. The local constitution could be&nbsp;modified or revoked by the
                Roman senate and assembly,&nbsp;aud the local magistrates, no less than the
                ordinary&nbsp;members of the community, were subject to the paramount&nbsp;authority
                of the Roman consuls, prætors, and censors. In&nbsp;particular, care was taken to
                keep the administration of&nbsp;justice well under central control. The Roman
                citizen in&nbsp;a colony or municipium enjoyed of course the right of&nbsp;appeal to
                the Roman people in a capital case. We may&nbsp;also assume that from the first some
                limit was placed to&nbsp;the jurisdiction of the local magistrate, and that
                cases&nbsp;falling outside it came before the central authorities. But</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">. an additional safeguard for the equitable and uniform
                administration of Roman law, in communities to many of&nbsp;which the Roman code was
                new and unfamiliar, was&nbsp;provided by the institution of prefects (“ praefecti
                    juri&nbsp;dicundo”),@@<sup>2</sup> who were sent out annually, as
                representatives&nbsp;of the Roman prætor, to administer j ustice in the
                colonies&nbsp;and municipia. To prefects was, moreover, assigned the&nbsp;charge of
                those districts within the Roman pale where no&nbsp;urban communities, and
                consequently no organized local&nbsp;government, existed. In these two institutions,
                that of&nbsp;municipal government and that of prefectures, we have&nbsp;already two
                of the cardinal points of the later imperial&nbsp;system of government.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">A word must lastly be said of the changes which the altered position
                and increased responsibilities of Rome had&nbsp;effected in her military
                    system.@@<sup>3</sup> For the most part these&nbsp;changes tended gradually to
                weaken the old and intimate&nbsp;connexion between the Roman army in the field and
                the&nbsp;Roman people at home, and thus prepared the ιvay for&nbsp;that complete
                breach between the two which in the end&nbsp;proved fatal to the republic. It is
                true that service in the&nbsp;legion was still the first duty and the highest
                privilege of the&nbsp;fully qualified citizen. Every “ assiduus ” was still liable
                to&nbsp;active military service between the ages of seventeen to&nbsp;forty-five,
                and “proletarii” aud freedmen were still called out&nbsp;only in great
                    emergencies,@@<sup>4</sup> and then but rarely enrolled in&nbsp;the legions. But
                this service was gradually altering in&nbsp;character. Though new legions were still
                raised each year&nbsp;for the summer campaigns, this was by no means
                always&nbsp;accompanied, as formerly, by the disbandment of those&nbsp;already on
                foot, and this increase in the length of time&nbsp;during which the citizen was kept
                with the standards had,&nbsp;as early as the siege of Veii, necessitated a
                further&nbsp;deviation from the old theory of military service—the&nbsp;introduction
                of pay.@@<sup>5</sup> Hardly less important than these&nbsp;changes were those which
                had taken place in the organization of the legion itself. In the early days of the
                republic&nbsp;the same divisions served for the soldier in the legion and&nbsp;the
                citizen in the assembly. The Roman army in the&nbsp;field, and the Roman people in
                the comitia on the Campus,&nbsp;were alike grouped according to their wealth, in
                classes&nbsp;and centuriæ. But by the time of the Latin war the&nbsp;arrangement of
                the legion had been wholly altered. In</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">the new manipular system, with its three lines, no regard was paid to
                civic distinctions, but only to length of service&nbsp;and military efficiency,
                while at the same time the more&nbsp;open order of fighting which it involved
                demanded of each&nbsp;soldier greater skill, and therefore a more thorough training
                in arms thau the old phalanx. One other change&nbsp;resulted from the new military
                necessities of the time,&nbsp;which was as fruitful of results as the incipient
                separation&nbsp;between the citizen and the soldier. The citizen soldiers&nbsp;of
                early Rome were commanded in the field by the men&nbsp;whom they had chosen to be
                their chief magistrates at&nbsp;home, and still, except when a dictator was
                appointed, the&nbsp;chief command of the legions rested with the consuls of&nbsp;the
                year. But, as Rome’s military operations increased in&nbsp;area and in distance from
                Rome, a larger staff became&nbsp;necessary, and the inconvenience of summoning home
                a&nbsp;consul in the field from an unfinished campaign became&nbsp;intolerable. The
                remedy found, that of prolonging for a&nbsp;further period the imperium of the
                consul, was first&nbsp;applied in 327 </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font1"> in the case of Q.
                Publilius Philo,@@<sup>6</sup> and&nbsp;between 327 and 264 instances of this “
                prorogatio imperii ”&nbsp;became increasingly common. This proconsular
                authority,&nbsp;originally an occasional and subordinate one, was destined&nbsp;to
                become first of all the strongest force in the republic,&nbsp;and ultimately the
                chief prop of the power of the Cæsars.&nbsp;Already, within the limits of Italy,
                Rome had laid the&nbsp;foundation stones of the system by which she
                afterwards&nbsp;governed the world,—the municipal constitutions, the
                allied&nbsp;states, the proconsuls, and the prefects.</span></p>

                class="font1">Though marked&nbsp;out by her geographical position as the natural
                centre of&nbsp;the Mediterranean, Italy had hitherto played no active&nbsp;part in
                Mediterranean politics, but, now that she was for&nbsp;the first time united, it was
                felt throughout the Mediterranean world that a new power had arisen, and
                Rome,&nbsp;as the head and representative of Italy, found herself&nbsp;irresistibly
                drawn into the vortex of Mediterranean affairs.&nbsp;With those of the eastern
                Mediterranean indeed she&nbsp;was not immediately called upon to concern
                herself.&nbsp;Her repulse of Pyrrhus, and the news that the Greek&nbsp;cities of
                South Italy had acknowledged her suzerainty,&nbsp;had, it is true, suddenly revealed
                to the Eastern world&nbsp;the existence of a powerful Italian state. Egypt
                sought&nbsp;her alliance, and Greek scholars began to interest themselves keenly in
                the history, constitution, and character&nbsp;of the Latin republic which had so
                suddenly become&nbsp;famous. But this was all, and not until fifty years&nbsp;after
                the retreat of Pyrrhus did Rome seriously turn&nbsp;her attention eastward. Westward
                of Italy the case was&nbsp;different. The western coasts of the peninsula were
                the&nbsp;most fertile and populous and wealthy, and it was westward rather than
                eastward that the natural openings for&nbsp;Italian commerce were to be found. But
                it was precisely&nbsp;on this side that Rome had serious ground for
                anxiety.&nbsp;Carthage was now at the height of her power. Her outposts were
                threateningly near to Italy in Sardiuia and in&nbsp;Sicily, while her fleets swept
                the seas and jealously guarded&nbsp;for the benefit of Carthage alone the hidden
                treasures of&nbsp;the West. In the east of Sicily, Syracuse still upheld&nbsp;the
                cause of Greek independence against the hereditary&nbsp;foe of the Greek race ; but
                Syracuse stood alone, and her&nbsp;resources were comparatively small. What Rome had
                to&nbsp;fear was the establishment, and that at no distant date,&nbsp;of an absolute
                Carthaginian domination over the Western&nbsp;seas—a domination which would not only
                be fatal to&nbsp;Italian commerce but would be a standing menace to the&nbsp;safety
                of the Italian coasts. Rome had indeed long been</span></p><div>
