<p><span class="font0">compel discovery of a secret trust for superstitious uses. Since 2 &amp; 3 Will. IV. c. 115 gifts for the propagation of the Roman&nbsp;Catholic faith are not void as made to superstitious uses. It should *&nbsp;be noticed that the doctrine of superstitious uses is not confined to the&nbsp;Roman Catholic religion, though the question has generally arisen&nbsp;in the case of gifts made by persons of that religion. The Roman&nbsp;Catholic Charities Act i860 enables the court to separate a lawful&nbsp;charitable trust from any part of the estate subject to any trust or&nbsp;provision deemed to be superstitious. It also provides that in the&nbsp;absence of any written document the usage of twenty years is to be&nbsp;conclusive evidence of the application of charitable trusts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(5) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Patronage.—</span><span class="font0">A Roman Catholic cannot present to a benefice, prebend, or other ecclesiastical living, or collate or nominate to any&nbsp;free school, hospital or donative (3 Jac. I. c. 5). Such patronage is by&nbsp;the act vested in the universities, Oxford taking the City of London&nbsp;and twenty-five counties in England and Wales, mostly south of&nbsp;the Trent, Cambridge the remaining twenty-seven. The principle&nbsp;is affirmed in subsequent acts (1 Will, and Mary, scss. i,c. 26;&nbsp;12 Anne, st..2, c. 14; 11 Geo. II. c. 17). If the right of presentation&nbsp;to an ecclesiastical benefice belongs to any office under the crown,&nbsp;and that office is held by a Roman Catholic, the archbishop of Canterbury’ exercises the right for the time being (10 Geo. IV. c. 7, s. 17).&nbsp;No Roman Catholic may advise the crown as to the exercise of its&nbsp;ecclesiastical patronage (Ibid. s. 18). A Roman Catholic, if a mçmbcr&nbsp;of a lay corporation, cannot vote in any ecclesiastical appointment&nbsp;(lbid. s. 15). Grants and devises of advowsons, &amp;c., by Roman&nbsp;Catholics are void, unless for valuable consideration to a Protestant&nbsp;purchaser (11 Geo. II. c. 17, s. 5). Where a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">quare impedit</span><span class="font0"> is pending&nbsp;before any court, the court may compel the patron to take an oath&nbsp;that there is no secret trust for the benefit of a Roman Catholic.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Church in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The history of Roman Catholicism in the New World begins with the Norse discoveries of Greenland and Vinland the Good.&nbsp;In the former the bishopric of Gardar was established in 1112,&nbsp;and extinguished only in 1492. To the latter (the coast of&nbsp;New England), the Northmen during the same period made&nbsp;“ temporary visits for timber and peltries, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">op</span><span class="font0"> missionary voyages&nbsp;to evangelize for a season the natives.” Beyond these facts,&nbsp;the Norse sagas and chronicles contribute little that is certain&nbsp;(cf. “ The Norse Hierarchy in the United States,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amer. Cath.&nbsp;Quart. Review,</span><span class="font0"> April 1890). Although a bishop was appointed&nbsp;by the pope for the vaguely defined territory of Florida so early&nbsp;as 1528, the oldest Catholic community in what is now the&nbsp;United States dates from 1565, when the Spanish colony of&nbsp;St Augustine was founded. Hence the aboriginal tribes of&nbsp;the South were evangelized. In 1582 the missions of New&nbsp;Mexico were undertaken, and from 1601 Catholic missionaries&nbsp;were at work along the Pacific coast, especially in California.&nbsp;Early in the 17th century trading posts and mission centres&nbsp;were established on the coast of Maine, and during the same&nbsp;century French priests laboured zealously in northern New&nbsp;York, along the entire coast of the Mississippi from Wisconsin&nbsp;to Louisiana, and around the Great Lakes. Their principal&nbsp;concern was for the savages, over whom they acquired an&nbsp;extraordinary influence. Political jealousies, human avarice&nbsp;and treachery arrested the progress of most of their&nbsp;missions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The English colony of Maryland, planned by the Catholic George Calvert (ist Lord Baltimore), and founded (1634) by&nbsp;his son the Catholic Cecilius Calvert (2nd Lord Baltimore),&nbsp;and Pennsylvania, founded (1681) by the tolerant Quaker&nbsp;William Penn, first permitted the legal existence of Catholicism&nbsp;in English-speaking communities of the New World. It is from&nbsp;these centres that it spread during the 18th century. In 1784&nbsp;the Rev. John Carroll was appointed prefect-apostolic for the&nbsp;Catholics of the English colonies hitherto dependent on the&nbsp;vicar-apostolic of London. In 179° Father Carroll was made&nbsp;bishop of the see of Baltimore, and given charge of all the&nbsp;Catholic interests in the United States. There were then about&nbsp;24,500 Cathoflcs in the land, of which number 15,800 were in&nbsp;Maryland, and 7000 in Pennsylvania, 200 in Virginia and 1500&nbsp;in New York. In 1807 they had grown to 150,000 with&nbsp;80 churches. In the following year Baltimore found itself the&nbsp;first metropolitan see of the United States, with New York,&nbsp;Philadelphia, Boston and Bardstown as suffragans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The growth of the Catholic population by decades since 1820</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">was calculated by a competent historian, the late John Gilmary Shea, as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1820 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;244,500&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1860&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3,000,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1830 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;361,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1870&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4,685,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1840 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,000,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1880&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7,067,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1850 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1,726,470&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1890&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10,627,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The number in 1906 was 12,079,142 (U.S. Census, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Special Report,</span><span class="font0"> 1910). The main source of this growth has been&nbsp;immigration. Originally the Irish and the Germans furnished&nbsp;the greater quota. Later the Frcnch-Canadians, Italians,&nbsp;Poles and Bohemians added notably to the number; an&nbsp;appreciable percentage of Oriental Catholics is also found,—&nbsp;Greeks, Syrians, Armenians, &amp;c. Natural increase, especially&nbsp;among the first Catholic immigrants, and a certain percentage of conversions from Protestantism, are contributory&nbsp;sources. Being under the protection of the constitution, and&nbsp;enjoying the advantages of the common law, Catholicism could&nbsp;not meet with any official opposition; such few outbursts of&nbsp;fanaticism as there have been were but temporary or local,&nbsp;and did not represent the true feelings of the country. As&nbsp;to the future of the Church in the United States, all Cathoflcs&nbsp;feel, with their latest historian, that “ the Catholic Church is&nbsp;in accord with Christ's revelation, with American liberty, and&nbsp;is the strongest power for the preservation of the Republic&nbsp;from the new social dangers that threaten the United States&nbsp;as well as the whole civilized world. She has not grown, she&nbsp;cannot grow so weak and old that she may not maintain what&nbsp;she has produced—Christian civilization.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Internally, Catholicism in the United States has been free from any noteworthy schisms or heresies that might impede&nbsp;its development—its doctrinal history offers nothing of importance. The discipline differs little from that of the other&nbsp;churches of Catholicism. The unity of doctrine, liturgy and&nbsp;moral ideals is preserved by an intimate union with the sec&nbsp;of Rome. The general canonical legislation of the Church,&nbsp;the legislation by papal rescript and the Congregation of the&nbsp;Propaganda, the decisions of the Apostolic Delegation at&nbsp;Washington, and a certain amount of immemorial custom and&nbsp;practice, form the code that governs its domestic relations.&nbsp;Decennially each bishop of the United States is expected to pay&nbsp;a visit to Rome </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ad Limina Apostolorum),</span><span class="font0"> and to make a report&nbsp;of the spiritual condition of religion within his diocese. In&nbsp;addition a system of synods provides for local unity among&nbsp;bishops, priests and laity. Thus each province or body of&nbsp;bishops under a metropolitan holds provincial councils, while&nbsp;at greater intervals a plenary or national council is held. Of&nbsp;these last three have taken place—their decrees, when approved&nbsp;at Rome, are binding on all Catholics in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In education the Catholic Church endeavours to keep abreast with the best. There arc, according to Hoffmann’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Directory&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(Milwaukee, 1907), 4364 parochial schools, in which 1,096,842&nbsp;children of both sexes receive instruction. The total number of&nbsp;children in Catholic institutions is given as 1,266,175. There&nbsp;are 198 colleges for boys and 678 academics for girls. This system&nbsp;of education is crowned by the Catholic University of America at&nbsp;Washington, established by Leo XIIl. and the American hierarchy,&nbsp;and endowed with all the privileges of the old pontifical universities&nbsp;of Europe. In. addition there arc several other schools that&nbsp;rank as universities. The education of the clergy is provided&nbsp;for by 86 seminaries, in which there are 5697 students. Tne charitable institutions in the Church are very numerous. There are&nbsp;255 orphan asylums, with d.0,588 inmates. The other charitable&nbsp;institutions arc 992 in number, and include every form of public&nbsp;and private charity; no diocese is without one or more such establishments. The actual government of the Church in the United&nbsp;States is represented by one cardinal, 14 archbishops, 89 bishops,&nbsp;IIJ35 diocesan clergymen, under the sole and immediate direction&nbsp;of their bishops, 3958 members of religious orders subject to episcopal supervision—in all. 15,093 clergymen. There arc 8072&nbsp;churches with resident priests, and 4076 mission churches—in all&nbsp;12,148, to which must be added. 3358 chapels. Several hundred&nbsp;weekly publications are printed in English and. foreign tongues,&nbsp;to minister to the needs of the Catholic population. There exist&nbsp;also several literary and academical magazines and reviews of a&nbsp;high order of merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principal religious events in the recent.history of the Church were the holding of the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore (1884),</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
