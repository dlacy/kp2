All the firſt volume and the beginning of the ſecond appears to conſiſt of real incident and character, tho’ certainly a good deal heightened and diſguiſed. The Judge his grandfather, Crab and Potion the two apothecaries, and  Squire Gawky, were characters well known in that part of the kingdom where the ſcene was laid. Captains Oakhum and Whiſſie, Doctors Mackſhane and Morgan, were alſo ſaid to be real perſonages ; but their names we have either never learned or have now forgotten. A bookbinder and barber long eagerly contended for being ſhadowed under the name of <hi rend="italic">Strap. </hi>The Doctor ſeems to have enjoyed a peculiar felicity in deſcribing ſea-characters, particularly the officers and ſailors of the navy. His Trunnion, Hatchway, and Pipes, are highly finiſhed originals ; but what exceeds them all, and perhaps equals any character that has yet been painted by the happieſt genius of ancient or modern times, is his Lieutenant Bowling. This is indeed nature itſelf ; original, <hi rend="italic">unique,</hi> and  sui <hi rend="italic">generis.</hi></p><p>By the publication of this work the Doctor had acquired ſo great a reputation, that henceforth a certain degree of ſucceſs was inſured to every thing known or ſuspected to proceed from his hand. In the courſe of a few years, the Adventures of Peregrine Pickle appeared ; a work of great ingenuity and contrivance in the compoſition, and in which an uncommon degree of erudition is diſplayed, particularly in the deſcription of the entertainment given by the Republican Doctor, after the manner of the ancients. Under this personage the late Dr Akenſide, author oſ The Pleaſures of Imagination, is ſuppoſed to be typified ; and it would be difficult to determine whether profound learning or genuine humour predominate moſt in this epiſode. Another epiſode of The Adventures <hi rend="italic">of</hi> a Lady of Quality, likewiſe inſerted in this work, contributed greatly to its ſucceſs, and is indeed admirably executed; the materials, it is ſaid, the lady herſelf (the celebrated lady <hi rend="italic">Pane) </hi>furniſhed.</p><p>Theſe were not the only original compoſitions of this stamp with which the Doctor has favoured the public. Ferdinand Count Fathom, and Sir Launcelot Greaves, are ſtill in the list of what may be called <hi rend="italic">reading novels, </hi>and have gone through ſeveral editions ; but there is no injuſtice in placing them in a rank far below the former. No doubt invention, character, compoſition, and contrivance, are to be found in both ; but then ſituations are deſcribed which are hardly poſſible, and characters are painted which, iſ not altogether unexampled, are at leaſt incompatible with modern manners ; and which ought not to be, as the scenes are laid in modern times.</p><p>The laſt work which we believe the Doctor publiſhed was of much the ſame ſpecies, but caſt into a different form—The Expedition of Humphrey Clinker. It conſiſts of a ſeries of letters, written by different perſons to their reſpective correſpondents. He has here carefully avoided the faults which may be juſtly charged to his two former productions. Here are no extravagant characters nor unnatural ſituations. On the contrary, an admirable knowledge of life and manners is diſplayed ; and moſt uſeful leſſons are given applicable to intereſting but to very common ſituations.</p><p>We know not whether the remark has been made,</p><p>but there is certainly a very obvious ſimilitude between the characters of the three heroes of the Doctor’s chief productions. Roderic Random, Peregrine Pickle, and Matthew Bramble, are all brothers of the ſame family. The ſame ſatirical, cynical, diſpoſition, the ſame generoſity and benevolence, are the diſtinguiſhing and characteriſtical features of all three ; but they are far from being ſervile copies or imitations of each other. They differ as much as the Ajax, Diomed, and Achilles of Homer. This was undoubtedly a great effort of genius ; and the Doctor ſeems to have deſcribed his own character at the different ſtages and ſituations of his life.</p><p>Before he took a houſe at Chelſea, he attempted to ſettle as practitioner of phyſic at Bath ; and with that view wrote a treatiſe on the waters ; but was unſucceſsful, chiefly becauſe he could not render himſelf agreeable to the women, whoſe favour is certainly of great conſequence to all candidates for eminence, whether in medicine or divinity. This, however, was a little extraordinary ; for thoſe who remembered Dr Smollet at that time, cannot but acknowledge that he was as graceful and handſome a man as any of the age he lived in ; beſides, there was a certain dignity in his air and manner which could not but inſpire reſpect wherever he appeared. Perhaps he was too ſoon diſcouraged ; in all probability, had he perſevered, a man of his great learning, profound ſagacity, and intenſe application, beſides being endued with every other external as well as internal accompliſhment, muſt have at laſt ſucceeded, and, had he attained to common old age, been at the head of his profession.</p><p>Abandoning phyſic altogether as a profeſſion, he fixed his reſidence at Chelſea, and turned his thoughts entirely to writing. Yet, as an author, he was not near ſo ſucceſsful as his happy genius and acknowledged merit certainly deſerved. He never acquired a patron among the great, who by his favour or beneficence relieved him from the necessity of writing for a ſubſiſtence. The truth is, Dr Smollet poffeſſed a loftiness and elevation of ſentiment and character which appears to have diſqualiſied him for paying court to thoſe who were capable of conferring favours. It would be wrong to call this diſpoſition pride or haughtineſs ; for to his equals and inferiors he was ever polite, friendly, and generous. Bookſellers may therefore be ſaid to have been, his only patrons ; and from them he had constant employment in tranſlating, compiling, and reviewing. He translated Gil Bias and Don Quixote, both ſo happily, that all the former tranſlations of theſe excellent productions of genius have been almoſt ſuperſeded by his. His name likewiſe appears to a tranſlation of Voltaire’s Proſe Works : but little of it was done by his own hand ; he only reviſed it, and added a few notes. He was concerned in a great variety of compilations. His Hiſtory of England was the principal work of that kind. It had a moſt extenſive ſale ; and the Doctor is ſaid to have received L. 2000 for writing it and the continuation.</p><p>In 1755 he ſet on foot the Critical Review, and continued the principal manager of it till he went abroad for the firſt time in the year 1763. He was perhaps too acrimonious ſometimes in the conduct of that work; and at the ſame time diſplayed too much ſensibility</p></body></text></TEI>
