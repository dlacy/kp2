<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">cast-iron struts, according to the depth, are placed between the walls at the upper part to take the thrust. A section of open&nbsp;cutting with two rows of struts is shown in fig. 25. The cost of&nbsp;open cuttings 25 feet wide and 25 deep was, say, £67 per lineal&nbsp;yard, or with one row of cast-iron struts £55 per yard. With two&nbsp;rows of struts for a depth of 42 feet, the cost was £108 per lineal&nbsp;yard. It was the intention originally to make the stations as well&nbsp;as the railway strictly “underground,” and those at Baker Street,&nbsp;Portland Road, and Gower Street were so constructed. At Baker&nbsp;Street a segmental arch of 45 feet span and 10 feet 4 inches of&nbsp;rise extends over the entire length of 300 feet of platform. The&nbsp;cost of such a station, including booking-offices, restorations, and&nbsp;other contingencies, amounted to £18,000. Ou the extensions the&nbsp;stations were, when the conditions admitted it, placed in open&nbsp;cuttings, roofed over, 300 feet long, with platforms 15 feet wide.&nbsp;The average cost exceeded that of the same length of ordinary&nbsp;covered way by from £14,000 to £22,000. Not only sewers but&nbsp;gas mains and water mains occasionally demanded very expensive&nbsp;diversions. In passing Broad Sanctuary 2000 feet of gas mains,&nbsp;ranging from 14 to 30 inches in diameter, were diverted ; and in&nbsp;simply crossing High Street, Kensington, 600 feet of pipes of from&nbsp;3 to 30 inches bore were diverted. In passing a sound building&nbsp;on a good foundation the work was executed in short lengths,&nbsp;with carefully timbered trenches quickly followed up by the concrete and brickwork of the retaining walls or covered way. Under&nbsp;the houses of Pembridge Square the side walls of the railway were&nbsp;constructed in short lengths, and to form the roof of the covered&nbsp;way main girders of 25 feet span were slipped between the walls&nbsp;of the houses at convenient places, between which jack-arches were&nbsp;built. At Park Crescent only a floor of old ship timber separates&nbsp;the kitchens from the railway. The permanent way originally&nbsp;consisted of wrought-iron flange rails with longitudinal sleepers&nbsp;and then of steel flange rails ; but these have been gradually replaced by double-headed rails in chairs. Fig. 26 shows a section&nbsp;of the covered way under Queen Victoria Street, with the main&nbsp;sewer underneath and the galleries for pipes, &amp;c., at the sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Glasgow City and District Railway will supply important links of communication between the railways on the north side of&nbsp;the river Clyde. The line extends from College station, High&nbsp;Street, by George Street and Regent Street, crossing Dumbarton&nbsp;Road to the existing Stobcross line, over a length of nearly 2£&nbsp;miles, almost wholly underground. Of this length 1700 yards, or&nbsp;nearly 1 mile, are tunnelled and 1000 yards are covered way. The&nbsp;tunnels are arched with four rings of biick in cement, to a clear&nbsp;height of 18.} feet at the crown and 27 feet in width, for two lines&nbsp;of way. The covered way is arched over with brick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We may take the “elevated railroads” of New York as an instance of metropolitan railways for local service above ground. In 1867&nbsp;the first attempt was made to improve existing means of transit&nbsp;between the residential and the business quarters of the city by the&nbsp;construction of an elevated railroad worked by a wire rope and&nbsp;a stationary engine. The railroad passed into other hands in 1872,&nbsp;and the New York Elevated Railroad Company w<sup>r</sup>as formed. The&nbsp;lines of this and of the Metropolitan Elevated Railroad Company are&nbsp;now worked together by the Manhattan Railway Company. From&nbsp;the southern terminus of the former railway at South Ferry diverge&nbsp;the lines by which the eastern and western sides of the city are&nbsp;• traversed. Junctions are made with the Grand Central Dépôt of&nbsp;the New York Central and other railroads, and with the New York&nbsp;City and Northern Railroad. In the beginning of 1880 the elevated&nbsp;system was worked over 34£ miles of line ; in 1884 96,702,620&nbsp;passengers were carried over the system, averaging 265,000 per day,&nbsp;over half on one line (3d Ave.). Trains run every two minutes in&nbsp;the morning and evening, when the fares are 5 cents or 2£d. for any&nbsp;distance ; and in the quieter hours of the day every four or five&nbsp;minutes for a general fare of 10 cents or 5d. The working charges&nbsp;amounted in 1883-84 to 58 per cent, of the gross earnings. On the&nbsp;New York Elevated Railroad the line is supported on square wrought-iron lattice-work columns let into cast-iron base blocks founded on&nbsp;brickwork and concrete, at distances of from 37 to 44 feet apart.&nbsp;Where the street traffic is crowded a&nbsp;single row of columns is planted in&nbsp;the line of each curb, on the upper&nbsp;ends of which a pair of longitudinal&nbsp;girders are fixed to carry a line of&nbsp;way, 22£ feet high above the street&nbsp;level, as shown in fig. 27, at each&nbsp;side of the street. In other situations&nbsp;the two lines of way are supported at&nbsp;a height of 21 feet on longitudinal&nbsp;girders in the middle of the street,&nbsp;fixed to transverse girders, which&nbsp;span the street and are carried on&nbsp;columns at the curbs. A third arrangement is adopted where the&nbsp;columns are planted in the street at&nbsp;a distance transversely of 23| feet,&nbsp;as in fig. 28, each carrying a line of&nbsp;rails at a height of 18 feet, and connected at intervals by arched bracing&nbsp;to steady the structure. In this illustration the street is occupied by a&nbsp;double line of tramway. The rails&nbsp;are of the Vignoles pattern, of Bessemer steel, weighing 50 lb per yard,&nbsp;spiked to cross timber sleepers, and&nbsp;guarded by two longitudinal timbers,&nbsp;one on each side of each rail. The&nbsp;sharpest curve on the main line has&nbsp;90 feet of radius. The gradients conform, for the most part, to those of&nbsp;the streets, and the steepest gradient is 1 in 50 for a length of&nbsp;800 yards. The traffic is worked with outside cylinder, four-coupled wheel, bogie-truck locomotives, weighing in working order&nbsp;19^ tons. The driving-wheels are 3^ feet in diameter, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">cylinders 12 inches in diameter with a stroke of 16 inches. The cars are of the usual American type, entered from each end, 45 feet&nbsp;long and 8 wide, with seats for forty-two passengers. They are&nbsp;placed on two bogie trucks, and weigh 12 tons. The trains are&nbsp;provided with continuous air-brakes. The stations are about one-third of a mile apart; the platforms are 200 feet long and 13 wide.&nbsp;The cost per mile of double way is given by Mr R. E. Johnston as&nbsp;follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Foundations, columns, girders, superstructure, and permanent way .. £57,696</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Stations............................................................ 12,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Five locomotives................................................... 4,000</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tw'elve cars....................................................... 7,660</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Total per mile..........................................£81,376</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">No payment has been made for way-leave along the streets, nor for compensation to frontagers, though it is known that in the residential quarters traversed by the railroads rents have in many instances,&nbsp;at least, been depreciated to the extent of 50 per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Permanent Wat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The permanent way consists of rails, chairs, spikes, keys, and sleepers laid in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a bed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of ballast deposited on the formation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">sleepers of substructure should be bedded on broken stones, cinders, or gravel, at least 12 inches in depth under the sleepers, without</span></p>
