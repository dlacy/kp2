<p><span class="font2">stratified form, with frequent cavities and fissures lined with crystals. As Vitruvius (ii. 5) says, it is a good weather-stone,&nbsp;but is soon calcined by fire. If laid horizontally it is very strong,&nbsp;but if set on end its crystalline structure is a great source of&nbsp;weakness, and it splits from end to end. Neglect on the part&nbsp;of Roman builders of this important precaution in many cases&nbsp;caused a complete failure in the structure. This was notably&nbsp;the case in the rostra. (6) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pidvis Puteolanus</span><span class="font2"> (pozzolana), so&nbsp;called from extensive beds of it at Puteoli—a volcanic product, which looks like red sandy earth, and lies in enormous&nbsp;beds under and round the city of Rome. When mixed with&nbsp;lime it forms a very strong hydraulic cement, of equal use in&nbsp;concrete, mortar or undercoats of stucco. It is to this material&nbsp;that the concrete walls of Rome owe their enormous strength&nbsp;and durability, in many cases far exceeding those of the&nbsp;most massive stone masonry. Vitruvius devotes a chapter&nbsp;(bk. ii. ch. 6) to this very important material.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Bricks were either sun-dried </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(lateres crudi)</span><span class="font2"> or kiln-baked </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(lateres cocti, testae).</span><span class="font2"> The remarks of Vitruvius (ii. 3) seem to&nbsp;refer wholly to sun-dried bricks, of which no examples now&nbsp;exist in Rome. It is important to recognize the fact that among&nbsp;the existing ancient buildings of Rome there is no such thing&nbsp;as a brick wall or a brick arch in the true sense of the word; bricks&nbsp;were merely used as a facing to concrete walls and arches and&nbsp;have no constructional importance.<sup>@@1</sup> Concrete </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(opus caemen-ticium,</span><span class="font2"> Vitr. ii. 4, 6, 8), the most important of all the materials&nbsp;used, is made of rough pieces of stone, or of fragments of marble,&nbsp;brick, &amp;c., averaging from about the size of a man’s fist and&nbsp;embedded in cement made of lime and pozzolana—forming&nbsp;one solid mass of enormous strength and coherence. Stucco,&nbsp;cement and mortar </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(tectorium, opus albarium</span><span class="font2"> and other names)&nbsp;are of many kinds; the ancient Romans especially excelled&nbsp;in their manufacture. The cement used for lining the channels&nbsp;of aqueducts </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(opris signinum)</span><span class="font2"> was made of lime mixed with&nbsp;pounded brick or potsherds and pozzolana; the same mixture&nbsp;was used for floors under the “ nucleus ” or finer cement on&nbsp;which the mosaic or marble paving-slabs were bedded, and&nbsp;was called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">caementum ex testis tunsis.</span><span class="font2"> For walls, three or four&nbsp;coats of stucco were used, often as much as 5 in. thick&nbsp;altogether; the lower coats were of lime and pozzolana, the&nbsp;finishing coats of powdered white marble </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(opus albarium)</span><span class="font2"> suitable to receive painting. Even marble buildings, were usually&nbsp;coated with a thin layer of this fine white stucco, nearly as hard&nbsp;and durable as the marble itself—a practice also employed&nbsp;in the finest buildings of the Greeks—probably because it&nbsp;formed a more absorbent* ground for coloured decoration;&nbsp;stone columns coated in this way were called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“ columnae&nbsp;dealbatae</span><span class="font2"> ” (Cic. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">In Verr.</span><span class="font2"> ii. 1, 52 seq.). For the kinds of sand&nbsp;used in mortar and stucco, Vitruvius (ii. 4) mentions sea, pit&nbsp;and river sand, saying that pit sand is to be preferred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Marble appears to have come into use about the beginning of the 1st century B.c. Its introduction was at first viewed with great&nbsp;jealousy,’ as savouring of Greek luxury. The orator&nbsp;Crassuswas the first to use it in his house on the Palatine,&nbsp;built about 92 B.c.; and, though he had only six small&nbsp;columns of Hymettian marble, he was for this luxury&nbsp;nicknamed the “ Palatine Venus ” by the stern republican&nbsp;M. Brutus (Plin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxvi. 7). The temporary wooden theatre&nbsp;of the aedile M. Aemilius Scaurus, built in 58 </span><span class="font1">B.c., </span><span class="font2">appears to have&nbsp;been the first building in which marble was more largely used; its&nbsp;360 columns and the lower order of its scena were of Greek marble&nbsp;(see Plin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxvi. 5, 50). In a very few years, under the rule</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of Augustus, marble became very common.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of white statuary marble four principal varieties were used. (1) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor Lunense,</span><span class="font2"> from Luna, near the modern Carrara (Strabo,&nbsp;v. p. 222), is of many qualities, from the purest creamy white and the&nbsp;finest grain to the coarser sorts disfigured with bluish grey streaks.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">(Ex., the eleven Corinthian columns in the Borsa.) (2) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor Hymettium,</span><span class="font2"> from Mount Hymettus, near Athens, is coarser in&nbsp;grain than the best Luna marble and is usually marked wi(h grey&nbsp;or blue striations (Strabo ix. p. 399). (Ex., the forty-two columns&nbsp;in the nave of S. Maria Maggiore and the columns ih S. Pietro in&nbsp;Vincoli.). (3) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor Pcntcticum,</span><span class="font2"> from Mount Pentelicus, also near&nbsp;Athens, is very fine in grain and of a pure white; it was more used&nbsp;for architectural purposes than for statues, though some sculptors&nbsp;preferred it above all others, especially Pheidias and Praxiteles.&nbsp;(Ex., the bust of the young Augustus in the Vatican.) (4) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor&nbsp;Parium,</span><span class="font2"> from the Isle of Paros, is very beautiful, though coarse in&nbsp;texture, having a very crystalline structure. (Ex., the nineteen&nbsp;columns of the round temple in the Forum Boarium.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nine chief varieties of coloured marbles were used in Rome. (1) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor Numidicum</span><span class="font2"> (mod. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">giallo antico*</span><span class="font2"> Plin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font2"> v. 22),&nbsp;from Numidia and Libya, hence also called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Libycum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">is of a rich yellow, deepening to orange and even pink.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Enormous quantities of it were used,especially for columns, wall-linings and pavements. (Ex., seven columns on the arch of&nbsp;Constantine, taken from the arch of Trajan; the eighth column&nbsp;is in the Lateran basilica.) (2) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor Carystium</span><span class="font2"> (mod. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cipollrno),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">from Carystus in Euboea (Strabo x. p. 446), has alternate wavy&nbsp;strata of white and pale green—the ” undosa Carystos’’ of Statius&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Stlv.i.</span><span class="font2"> 5, 34). From its well-defined layers like an onion </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(cipotta)&nbsp;is</span><span class="font2"> derived its modern name. (Ex., columns of temple of Antoninus&nbsp;and Faustina.) (3) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor Phrygium</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Synnadicum</span><span class="font2"> (mod.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pavonazzetto),</span><span class="font2"> from Synnada in Phrygia (Strabo xii. p. 577; Juv.&nbsp;xiv. 307; Tibull. iii. 3, 13), is a slightly translucent marble, with&nbsp;rich purple markings, violet verging on red. It was fabled to be&nbsp;stained with the blood of Atys (Stat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Silv.</span><span class="font2"> i. 5, 37).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ex., twelve</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">fluted columns in S. Lorenzo fuori le Mura, ana four columns in the apse of S. Paolo fuori, saved from the ancient nave of the basilica,&nbsp;burnt in 1823.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor lasium</span><span class="font2"> (probably the modern </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">porta</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">santa),</span><span class="font2"> from lasus, is mottled with large patches of dull red, olive green and white. The “holy doors” 01 the four great basilicas&nbsp;are framed with it, hence its modern name. (Ex., the slabs in front&nbsp;of the hémicycle of the Rostra and four columns in S. Agnese fuori&nbsp;le Mura). (5) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor Chium</span><span class="font2"> (probably the modern </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Africano),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">from Chios, is similar in the variety of its markings to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">portasanta,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">but .more brilliant in tint. (Ex., a great part of the paving of the&nbsp;Basilica Julia and two large columns in the centre of the façade of&nbsp;St Peter’s.) (6) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor Taenarium</span><span class="font2"> (mod. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rosso antico),</span><span class="font2"> from&nbsp;Taenarum in Laconia (Strabo viii. p. 367; Pliny, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.'</span><span class="font2"> xxxvi.&nbsp;158), is a very close-grained marble, of a rich deep red, like blood.&nbsp;As a rule it does not occur in large pieces, but was much used for&nbsp;small cornices and other mouldings in interiors of buildings. Its&nbsp;quarries in Greece are still worked. (The largest pieces known are&nbsp;the fourteen steps to the high altar of S. Prassede and two columns&nbsp;nearly 12 ft. high in the Rospigliosi Casino dell’ Aurora.) (7) The&nbsp;name </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marmor Taenarium</span><span class="font2"> is also applied by the ancients to a black&nbsp;marble </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(nero antico)</span><span class="font2"> now no longer quarried. It is mentioned by&nbsp;Tibullus (iii. 3, 14) in conjunction with Phrygian and Carystian&nbsp;marbles; see also Prop. iii. 2, 9, and Plin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxvi. 135.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Ex.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">two columns in the choir of S. Giovanni, in Laterano.) (8) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lapis Atracius (verde antico),</span><span class="font2"> found at Atrax in Thessaly, was one of the&nbsp;favourite materials for decorative architecture; it is not strictly a&nbsp;marble </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font2"> a calcareous stone) but a variety of “ precious serpentine,”&nbsp;with patches of white and brown on a brilliant green ground. It&nbsp;seldom occurs in large masses. (The finest known specimens are&nbsp;the twenty-four columns beside the niches in the nave of the Lateran&nbsp;basilica.) (9) The hard oriental alabaster, the “ onyx ” or “ alabastrites ” of Pliny </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(H.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxvi. 59, xxxvii. 109); its chief quarries&nbsp;were on the Nile near Thebes,<sup>@@3</sup> in Arabia and near Damascus. In&nbsp;Pliny’s age it was a great rarity; but in later times it was introduced&nbsp;in large quantities, and fragments of a great many, columns have&nbsp;been found on the Palatine, in the baths of Caracalla and elsewhere.&nbsp;It is semi-transparent and beautifully marked with concentric&nbsp;nodules and wavy strata. An immense number of other less&nbsp;common marbles have been found, including many, varieties </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">breccia, whose ancient names are unknown.<sup>@@4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">From the latter part of the 1st century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font2"> hard stones—granites and basalts—were introduced in great quantities. The basalts—&nbsp;“ basanites ” of Pliny (xxxvi. 58)—are very refractory, and&nbsp;can only be worked by the help of emery or diamond dust.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The former was obtained largely at Naxos; diamond-dust drills are mentioned by Pliny </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(H.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxvii. 200).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The basalts are black, green and brown, and are usually free from spots or markings; examples of all three exist, but are comparatively rare. The red variety called “ porphyry ” was used&nbsp;in enormous quantities. It is the “ porphyntes ” of Pliny </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(H.N.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@1 I</sup>n less solid constructions than those which have survived until modern times bricks were doubtless used by themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2"><sup>@@@2 </sup>The oft-quoted boast of Augustus (Suet. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aug.</span><span class="font2"> 29) that he “ found Rome of brick and left it of marble ” has probably much&nbsp;truth in it, if for “ brick ” we read “ peperino and tufa.” In the&nbsp;time of Augustus burnt brick was very little used, the usual wall-facings being </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">opus quadralum</span><span class="font2"> of tufa or peperino, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticu-latum</span><span class="font2"> of tufa only.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
