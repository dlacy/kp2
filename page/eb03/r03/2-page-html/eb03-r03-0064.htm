<p><span class="font1">it is difficult to avoid, from the engaging manner in which Rouſſeau drags along his readers.” The paſe&nbsp;ſages in it wſhich have any reference to literature may&nbsp;be eaſily diſtinguiſhed, as they are treated with the&nbsp;agreeableneſs of a man of wit and *he exactneſs of a&nbsp;nian of taſte. Rouſſeau, ſoon after the rapid ſucceſs&nbsp;of his Village Conjuror, publiſhed a Letter </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">on</span><span class="font1"> French&nbsp;Muſic, or rather </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">againfi</span><span class="font1"> French muſic, written with as&nbsp;much freedom as livelineſs. The exaſperated partiſans of&nbsp;French comedy treated him with as much ſury as if he&nbsp;had conſpired againſt the ſtate. A crowd of inſigni-ficant enthuſiaſts ſpent their ſtrength in outcries againſt&nbsp;him. He was iniulted, menaced, and lampooned. Harmonic fanaticiſm went even to hang him up in effigy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That intereſting and tender ſtyle, which is ſo conſpicuous throughout the Village Conjuror, animates ſeveral letters in the New Heloiſa, in ſix parts, publiſhed 176x,&nbsp;in I2mo. This epiſtolary romance, of which the plot is&nbsp;ill-managed, and the arrangement bad, like all other&nbsp;works of genius, has its beauties as well as its faults.&nbsp;More truth in his characters and more preciſion in his&nbsp;details were to have been wiſhed. The characters, as&nbsp;well as their ſtyle, have too much ſameneſs, and their&nbsp;language is too affected and exaggerated. Some of&nbsp;the letters are indeed admirable, from the force and&nbsp;warmth of expreſſion, from an eſſerveſcence of ſenti-ments, ſrom the irregularity of ideas which always cha-racteriſe a paſſion carried to its height. But why is ſo&nbsp;affecting a letter ſo often accompanied with an unimportant digreſſion, an inſipid criticiſm, or a ſelf contradicting paradox ? Why, after having (hone in all the energy&nbsp;of ſentiment, does he on a hidden turn unaffecting ? It is&nbsp;becauſe none of the perſonages are truly intereſting.&nbsp;That of St Preux is weak, and often forced Julia is&nbsp;ad affemblage of tenderneſs and pity, of elevation of&nbsp;foul and of coquetry, of natural parts and pedantry.&nbsp;Wolmar is a violent man, and almoſt beyond the limits&nbsp;of nature. In fine, when he wiſhcs to change his ſtyle,&nbsp;and adopt that of the ſpeaker, it may eaſily be obſerved&nbsp;that he docs not long ſupport it, and every attempt em-barraffes the author and cools the reader. In the He-loiſa, Rouſſeau’s unlucky talent of rendering every&nbsp;thing problematical, appears very conſpicuous; as in his&nbsp;arguments in favour of and againſt duelling, which afford an apology for ſuicide, and a juſt condemnation&nbsp;of it : in his facility in palliating the crime of adultery, and his very ſtrong reaſons to make it abhorred :&nbsp;on the one hand, in declamations againſt ſocial happi-neſs ; on.the other, intranſports in favour of humanity :&nbsp;here, in violent rhapſodies againſt philoſophers ; there,&nbsp;•by a rage for adopting their opinions : the exiſtence of&nbsp;God attacked by ſophiſtry, and Atheiſts confuted by&nbsp;the moſt irrefragable arguments ; the Chriſtian religion&nbsp;combated by the moſt ſpecious objections, and celebrated wfith the moſt ſublime eulogies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His Emilia afterwards made more noiſe than .the new Helofia. This moral romance, which was publiſhed in'&nbsp;176 &gt;, in four vols ιzmo, treats chiefly of education.&nbsp;Rouſſeau wiſhed to follow nature in every thing ; and&nbsp;though his ſyſtem in ſeveral places differs from received&nbsp;ideas, it delerves in many reſpects to be put in practice, and with ſome neceſſary modifications it has been&nbsp;ſo. His precepts are expreſſed with the force and dignity of a mind full oſ the leading truths of morality.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">7f </span><span class="font1">he </span><span class="font2">has not always been virtuous? no body at leaſt</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">has ſelt ſt more, or made it appear to more advantage. Every thing which he ſays againſt luxury ſhows the vices and conceited opinions of his age, and is&nbsp;worthy at once of Plato or of Tacitus. His ſtyle is&nbsp;peculiar to himſelf. He ſometimes, however, appears,&nbsp;by a kind of affected rudeneſs and aſperity, to ape at&nbsp;the mode of Montaigne, of whom he is a great admirer, and whoſe ſentiments and expreſſions he often&nbsp;clothes in a new drtſſs. What is moſt to be lamented&nbsp;L, that in wiſhing to educate a young man as a Chriſtian he has filled his third volume with objections&nbsp;againſt Chriſtianity. He has, it muſt be confeſſed,&nbsp;given a very ſublime eulogium on the goſpel, and an&nbsp;affecting portrait of its divine Author : but the miracles, and the prophecies which ſerve to eſtabliſh his&nbsp;miſſion, he attacks without the leaſt reſerve. Admitting only natural religion, he weighs every thing in&nbsp;the balance </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">reaſon; and this reaſon being falſe, leads&nbsp;him into dilemmas veιy unfavourable to his own hepoſe&nbsp;and happineſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He dwelt from 1754 in a ſmall houſe in the country near Montmorenci ; a retreat which he owed to the generoſity of a farmer-general. The cauſe oſ his love for&nbsp;this retirement was, according to himſelf, “ that invincible ſpirit of liberty which nothing could conquer,&nbsp;and in competition with which honours, fortune, and&nbsp;reputation, could not ſtand. It is true, this defire of&nbsp;liberty has occaſioned leſs pride than lazineſs ; but this&nbsp;indolence is inconceivable. Every thing ſtartlesit; the&nbsp;moſt inconſiderable reciprocalities of ſocial life are to it&nbsp;inſupportable. A word to ſpeak, a letter to write, a&nbsp;viſit to pay, things neceſſary to be done, are to me pu-niſhments. Hear my reaſons. Although the ordinary&nbsp;intercourſe between mankind be odious to me, intimate&nbsp;friendſhip appears to me very dear ; becauſe there are&nbsp;no mere ceremonies due to it ; it agrees with the heart,&nbsp;and all is accompliſhed. Hear, again, why I have always ſhunned kindneſſes ſo much ; becauſe every act of&nbsp;kindneſs requires a grateful mind, and I find my heart&nbsp;ungrateful, ſrom this alone, that gratitude is a duty.&nbsp;Laſtly, that kind of felicity which is neceſſary for me,&nbsp;is not ſo much to do that which I wiſh, as not to do&nbsp;what I wiſh, not to do.” Rouſſeau enjoyed this felicity wſhich he ſo much wiſhed in his retirement. Without entirely adopting that too rigorous mode of life&nbsp;purſued by the ancient Cynics, he deprived himſelf of&nbsp;every thing that could in any meaſure 'add fuel to this&nbsp;wiſhed-for luxury, which is ever the companion </span><span class="font2">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">riches, and which inverts even cuſtom itſelf. He might&nbsp;have been happy in this retreat, if he could have forgot&nbsp;this public which he affected to deſpiſe ; but his deſire&nbsp;after a great name got the better of his ſelf love, and it&nbsp;was this thirſt after reputation which made him introduce ſo many dangerous paragraphs in his Emilia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The French parliament condemned this book in. 1762, and entered into a criminal proſecution againſt&nbsp;the author, which forced him to make a precipitate retreat. He dire&lt;cted his ſteps towards his native country, which ſhut its gates upon him. Proſeribed in the&nbsp;place where he firſt drew breath, he ſought an aſylum&nbsp;in Switzerland, and found one in the principality of&nbsp;Neufchatel. His firſt care was to défend his Emilia&nbsp;againſt the mandate of the archbiſhop of Paris, by whom&nbsp;it had been anathematiſed. In 1763 he publiſhed a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">letter, in which he re-exhibits all his errors, let off </span><span class="font1">with</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
