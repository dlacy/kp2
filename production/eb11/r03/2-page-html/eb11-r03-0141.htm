<p><span class="font0">proposed and carried on the ioth of June the outrageous law of 22nd Prairial, by which even the appearance of justice was&nbsp;taken from the tribunal, which, as no witnesses were allowed,&nbsp;became a simple court of condemnation. The result of this&nbsp;law was that between the 12th of June and the 28th of July,&nbsp;the day of Robespierre’s death, no less than 1285 victims&nbsp;perished by the guillotine in Paris. It was the bloodiest and&nbsp;the least justifiable period of the Terror. But before this&nbsp;there had taken place in Robespierre’s life an episode of supreme&nbsp;importance, as illustrating his character and his political aims:&nbsp;on the 7th of May he secured a decree from the Convention&nbsp;recognizing the existence of the Supreme Being. This worship&nbsp;of the Supreme Being was based upon the ideas of Rousseau&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Social Contract,</span><span class="font0"> and was opposed by Robespierre to&nbsp;Catholicism on the one hand and the Hebertist atheism on&nbsp;the other. In honour of the Supreme Being a great fête was&nbsp;held on the 8th of June; Robespierre, as president of the&nbsp;Convention, walked first and delivered his harangue, and as he&nbsp;looked around him he may well have believed that his position&nbsp;was secured and that he was at last within reach of a supreme&nbsp;power which should enable him to impose his belief on all&nbsp;France, and so ensure its happiness. The majority of the&nbsp;Committee found his popularity—or rather his ascendancy,&nbsp;for as that increased his personal popularity diminished—&nbsp;useful to them, since by increasing the stringency of the Terror&nbsp;he strengthened the position of the Committee, whilst attracting to himself, as occupying the most prominent position in&nbsp;it, any latent feeling of dissatisfaction at such stringency.&nbsp;Of the issue of a struggle between themselves and Robespierre they had little fear: they controlled the Committee&nbsp;of General Security through their alliance with its leaders,&nbsp;André Amar and Marc Guillaume Alexis Vadier; they were&nbsp;hopeful of obtaining a majority in the Convention; for they&nbsp;knew that the chief deputies on the left, or “ the Mountain,”&nbsp;were Dantonists, who burned to avenge Danton’s death;&nbsp;while they felt sure also that the mass of the deputies of the&nbsp;centre, or “ the Marsh,” could be hounded on against Robespierre if they were to accuse him of aiming at the dictatorship&nbsp;and pour on him the obloquy of having increased the Terror&nbsp;when victory on the frontier rendered it less necessary; and&nbsp;they knew finally that his actual adherents, though devoted&nbsp;to him, were few in number. The devotion of these admirers&nbsp;had been further excited by the news that a half-witted girl,&nbsp;named Cécile Renault, had been found wandering near his&nbsp;house, with a knife in her possession, intending to play the&nbsp;part of Charlotte Corday. She was executed on the 17th of&nbsp;June, on the very day that Vadier raised a laugh at Robespierre’s expense in the Convention by his report on the&nbsp;conspiracy of Catherine Théot </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.vf,</span><span class="font0"> a mad woman, who had&nbsp;asserted that Robespierre was a divinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Robespierre felt that he must strike his blow now or never. Yet he was not sufficiently audacious to strike at once, as Payan&nbsp;and Jean Baptiste Coffinhal, the ablest of his adherents, would&nbsp;have had him do, but retired from the Convention for some&nbsp;weeks, as he had done before the overthrow of the Hébertists&nbsp;and the Dantonists, to prepare his plan of action. This retirement seemed ominous to the majority of the Committee, and&nbsp;they too prepared for the struggle by communicating with the&nbsp;deputies of the Mountain, who were either friends of Danton&nbsp;or men of proved energy like Barras, Freron and Tallien.&nbsp;These weeks, the last of his life, Robespierre passed very peacefully, according to his wont all through the Revolution. He&nbsp;continued to live with the Duplays, with whose daughter&nbsp;Éléonore he had fallen in love, and used to wander with her and&nbsp;his favourite dog, a great Danish hound, named Bruant, in the&nbsp;Champs Élysées during the long summer evenings. At last,&nbsp;on the 26th of July, Robespierre appeared, for the first time for&nbsp;more than four weeks, in the Convention and delivered a carefully studied harangue, which lasted for more than four hours,&nbsp;in which he declared that the Terror ought to be ended, that&nbsp;certain deputies who had acted unjustly and exceeded their&nbsp;powers ought to be punished, and that the Committees of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Public Safety and General Security ought to be renewed. Great was the excitement in the Convention: all wondered who were&nbsp;the deputies destined to be punished; all were surprised that&nbsp;the Terror should be imputed as a fault to the very Committee&nbsp;of which Robespierre had been a member. The majority of the&nbsp;Committee of Public Safety determined to act promptly. The&nbsp;Convention, moved by Robespierre’s eloquence, at first passed&nbsp;his motions; but he was replied to by Joseph Cambon the&nbsp;financier, Billaud-Varcnne, Amar and Vadier, and the Convention rescinded their decrees and referred Robespierre’s&nbsp;question to their committees. On the following day, the 27th&nbsp;of July, or in the revolutionary calendar the 9th Thermidor,&nbsp;Saint-Just began to speak on behalf of the motions of Robespierre, when violent interruptions showed the temper of the&nbsp;Convention. Jean Lambert, Tallien, Billaud-Varenne and&nbsp;Vadier again attacked Robespierre; cries of “ Dowm with the&nbsp;tyrant!” were raised; and, when Robespierre hesitated in his&nbsp;speech in answer to these attacks, the words “ C’est le sang de&nbsp;Danton qui t’étouffe ” showed what was uppermost in the minds&nbsp;of the Mountain. Robespierre tried in vain to gain a hearing,&nbsp;the excitement increased and at five in the afternoon Robespierre,&nbsp;Couthon and Saint-Just, with two young deputies, Augustin&nbsp;Robespierre (younger brother of Maximilien) and Philippe&nbsp;François Joseph Lebas, the only men in all the Convention&nbsp;who supported them, were ordered to be arrested. Yet all hope&nbsp;for Robespierre was not gone; he was speedily rescued from&nbsp;his prison, with the other deputies, by the troops of the Commune and brought to the Hôtel de Ville. There he was surrounded by his faithful adherents, led by Payan and CoffinhaL&nbsp;But the day w<sup>r</sup>as past when the Commune could overawe the&nbsp;Convention; for now the men of action were hostile to the&nbsp;Commune, and its chief was not a master of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coups d'état.</span><span class="font0"> On&nbsp;the news of the release of Robespierre, the Convention had&nbsp;again met, and declared the members of the Commune and the&nbsp;released deputies outlawed. The national guards under the&nbsp;command of Barras had little difficulty in making their way&nbsp;to the Hôtel de Ville; Robespierre was shot in the lower jaw&nbsp;by a young gendarme named Meda while signing an appeal to&nbsp;one of the sections of Paris to take up arms for him, though the&nbsp;wound was afterwards believed to have been inflicted by himself; and all the released deputies were again arrested. After&nbsp;a night of agony, Robespierre w<sup>r</sup>as the next day taken before&nbsp;the tribunal, where his identity as an outlaw was proved, and&nbsp;without further trial he was executed with Couthon and Saint-Just and nineteen others of his adherents on the Place de la&nbsp;Révolution on the ioth Thermidor (28th July) 1794.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The character of Robespierre, when looked upon simply in the light of his actions and his authenticated speeches, and apart&nbsp;from the innumerable legends which have grown up about&nbsp;it, is not a difficult cfne to understand. A well-educated and&nbsp;accomplished young lawyer, he might have acquired a good&nbsp;provincial practice and lived a happy provincial life had it&nbsp;not been for the Revolution. Like thousands of other young&nbsp;Frenchmen, he had read the works of Rousseau and taken them&nbsp;as gospel. Just at the very time in life when this illusion had&nbsp;not been destroyed by the realities of life, and without the&nbsp;experience which might have taught the futility of idle dreams&nbsp;and theories, he was elected to the states-general. At Paris&nbsp;he was not understood till he met with his audience of fellow-disciples of Rousseau at the Jacobin Club. His fanaticism&nbsp;w’on him supporters; his singularly sweet and sympathetic&nbsp;voice gained him hearers; and his upright life attracted the&nbsp;admiration of all. As matters approached nearer and nearer&nbsp;to the terrible crisis, he failed, except in the two instances of&nbsp;the question of war and of the king’s trial, to show himself a&nbsp;statesman, for he had not the liberal views and practical instincts&nbsp;which made Mirabeau and Danton great men. His admission&nbsp;to the Committee of Public Safety gave him power, which he&nbsp;hoped to use for the establishment of his favourite theories,&nbsp;and for the same purpose he acquiesced in and even heightened&nbsp;the horrors of the Reign of Terror. It is here that the&nbsp;fatal mistake of allowing a theorist to have poorer appeared:</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
