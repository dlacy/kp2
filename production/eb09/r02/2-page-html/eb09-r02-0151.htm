<p><span class="font1">surrounded by a splendidly modelled wreath of fruit and flowers, especially apples, lemons, oranges, and fir cones,&nbsp;all of which are brilliantly coloured. This medallion was&nbsp;set up on the façade of the Pazzi Palace to commemorate&nbsp;Rene’s visit to Florence in 1442. Another early relief by&nbsp;Luca, also highly polychromatic, is that of the Ascension in&nbsp;the tympanum of one of the sacristy doors in the cathedral,&nbsp;executed between 1446 and 1450, as is recorded in a&nbsp;document published by Rumohr </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Italien. Forsch.,</span><span class="font1"> ii. pp.&nbsp;364-365). Other existing works of Luca in Florence are&nbsp;the tympanum reliefs of the Madonna between two Angels&nbsp;in the Via dell' Agnolo, a work of exquisite beauty, and&nbsp;another over the door of S. Pierino del Mercato Vecchio.&nbsp;The only existing statues by Luca are two lovely enamelled&nbsp;figures of Kneeling Angels holding candlesticks, now in&nbsp;the canons’ sacristy.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> A very fine work by Luca, executed&nbsp;between 1449 and 1452, is the tympanum relief of the&nbsp;Madonna and four Monastic Saints over the door of S.&nbsp;Domenico at Urbino.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> Luca also made the four coloured&nbsp;medallions of the Virtues set in the vault over the tomb&nbsp;of the young cardinal-prince of Portugal in a side chapel&nbsp;of S. Miniato in Florence (see Rossellino). By Luca&nbsp;also are reliefs of the Madonna and various medallions&nbsp;outside Or San Michele. One of his chief decorative&nbsp;works which no longer exists was a small library or study&nbsp;for Piero de’ Medici, wholly lined with painted majolica&nbsp;plaques and reliefs.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> The South Kensington Museum possesses twelve circular plaques of majolica ware painted&nbsp;in blue and white with the Occupations of the Months ;&nbsp;these have been attributed to Luca, but have no resemblance to any known works of his. Their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">provenance</span><span class="font1"> is&nbsp;unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1471 Luca was elected president of the Florentine artists’ guild, but he refused this great honour on account&nbsp;of his age and infirmity. It shows, however, the very high&nbsp;estimation in which he was held by his contemporaries.&nbsp;He died on 20th February 1482, leaving his property to&nbsp;his nephews Andrea and Simone.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> His chief pupil was&nbsp;his nephew Andrea, and probably also Agostino di Duccio,&nbsp;who executed many pieces of sculpture at Rimini, and the&nbsp;graceful but mannered marble reliefs of angels on the&nbsp;façade of S. Bernardino at Perugia.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> Vasari calls this&nbsp;Agostino Luca’s brother, but he was not related to him&nbsp;at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. Andrea della Robbia (1435-1525), the nephew and pupil of Luca, carried on the production of the&nbsp;enamelled reliefs on a much larger scale than his uncle&nbsp;had ever done ; he also extended its application to various&nbsp;architectural uses, such as friezes and to the making of&nbsp;lavabos (lavatories), fountains, and large retables. The&nbsp;result of this was that, though the finest reliefs from the&nbsp;workshop of Andrea were but little if at all inferior to&nbsp;those from the hand of Luca, yet some of them, turned&nbsp;out by pupils and assistants, reached only a lower standard of merit. Only one work in marble by Andrea is&nbsp;known, namely, an altar in S. Maria delle Grazie near&nbsp;Arezzo, mentioned by Vasari (ed. Milanesi, ii. p. 179), and&nbsp;still well preserved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One variety of method was introduced by Andrea in his enamelled work ; sometimes he omitted the enamel</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">on the face and hands (nude parts) of his figures, especially in those cases where he had treated the heads in a realistic manner ; as, for example, in the noble tympanum&nbsp;relief of the meeting of St Domenic and St Francis in the&nbsp;loggia of the Florentine hospital of S. Paolo,—a design&nbsp;suggested by a fresco of Fra Angelico’s in the cloister&nbsp;of St Mark’s. One of the most remarkable works by&nbsp;Andrea is the series of medallions with reliefs of Infants&nbsp;in white on a blue ground set on the front of the foundling hospital at Florence. These lovely child-figures are&nbsp;modelled with wonderful skill and variety, no two being&nbsp;alike. Andrea produced, for guilds and private persons, a&nbsp;large number of reliefs of the Madonna and Child varied&nbsp;with much invention, and all of extreme beauty of pose&nbsp;and sweetness of expression. These are frequently framed&nbsp;with realistic and yet very “decorative garlands of fruit and&nbsp;flowers, all painted with enamel colours, while the main&nbsp;relief is left white. Fig. 2 shows a good example of these</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">smaller works. The hospital of S. Paolo, near S. Maria Novella, has also a number of fine medallions with reliefs&nbsp;of saints, two of Christ Healing the Sick, and two fine&nbsp;portraits, under which are white plaques inscribed—“dall’&nbsp;ano 1451 all’ ano 1495”; the first of these dates is the&nbsp;year when the hospital was rebuilt owing to a papal brief&nbsp;sent to the archbishop of Florence. Arezzo possesses a&nbsp;number of fine enamelled works by Andrea and his sons&nbsp;—a retable in the cathedral with God holding the Crucified&nbsp;Christ, surrounded by angels, and below, kneeling figures&nbsp;of S. Donato and S. Bernardino ; also in the cathedral is&nbsp;a fine relief of the Madonna and Child with four saints at&nbsp;the sides. In S. Maria in Grado is a very noble retable&nbsp;with angels holding a crown over a standing figure of the&nbsp;Madonna ; a number of small figures of worshippers take&nbsp;refuge in the folds of the Virgin’s mantle, a favourite&nbsp;motive for sculpture dedicated by guilds or other corporate</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
