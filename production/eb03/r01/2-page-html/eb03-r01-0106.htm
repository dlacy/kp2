<p><span class="font0">to pay attention to the ſame duties. He likewiſe en-jυins works of beneficence, deſires the prieſt to relieve the diſtreſſed, and to build houſes for the accommodation of ſtrangers of whatever religion ; and ſays, it is a&nbsp;diſgrace for Pagans to difregard thoſe of their own religion, while Chriſtians do kind offices to ſtrangers and&nbsp;enemies. This is indeed an eminent inſtance of the&nbsp;happy influence of Chriſtianity even on the ſentiments&nbsp;and manners of thoſe who regarded the Chriſtian name&nbsp;with abhorrence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon the whole then, may we not, from the parti-ciſlars here exhibited concerning the influence of this religion on the manners and happineſs of men in ſociety, conclude that Chriſtianity is infinitely ſuperior to&nbsp;the ſuperſtitions of Paganiſm ? as being in its tendency&nbsp;unifoιraly favourable to the virtue and the happinefs of&nbsp;mankind, and even to the ſyſtem of religion and laws&nbsp;delivered by Moſes to the children of Iſrael : becauſe,&nbsp;while the religion of the Jews was calculated only for&nbsp;one particular nation, and it may almoſt be ſaid for one&nbsp;particular ſtage in the progreſs of ſociety, Chriſtiani-ty is an univerſal religion, formed to exert its happy&nbsp;influence in all ages and among all nations ; and has a&nbsp;tendency to diſpel the ſhades of barliariſm and ignorance,&nbsp;to promote the cultivation of the powers of the human&nbsp;underſtanding, and to encourage every virtuous refinement of manners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">V. Another religion, which has made and ſtill makes a conſpicuous figure in the world remains yet&nbsp;to be examined. The religion of Mahomet is that&nbsp;which we here allude to. whether we conſider through&nbsp;what an extenſive part of the globe that religion prevails, the political importance of the nations among&nbsp;whom it is profeſſed, or the ſtriking peculiarity of cha-racter by which it is diſtinguiſhed from all other religious ſyſtems—it is for all theſe reafons well worthy of&nbsp;particular notice. Like the Jewiſh religion, it is not&nbsp;barely a ſyſtem oſ religious doctrines and general moral&nbsp;precepts ; it forms both the civil legiſlature and. the religious ſyſtem of thofe nations among whom it is profeſſed ; and, like it too, it would appear to be calcula-t⅛d rather for one particular period in the progreſs of&nbsp;mankind from rudenefs to refinement, than for all ages&nbsp;and all ſtates of fociety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The hiſtory of its origin is pretty well known, and we have had occaſion to enlarge upon it under a former&nbsp;article (fée Mahomet and&lt; Mahometanism). ∖Ve&nbsp;are not here to trace the impoſtures of the prophet,&nbsp;or to conſider the arts by which, he io ſuccefsfully accompliſhed his deſigns ; but merely to eonſider the morality of his religion, and its influence on civil order&nbsp;and the happineſs of fociety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we view the ſtate of the- nations among whom it is eſtabliſhed, we cannot hefitate </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">moment to declare&nbsp;if friendly to . ignorance, to deſpotiſm, and to impurity&nbsp;of manners- The Turks, the Perfians, and the Malays,&nbsp;are all Mahometans ; and in reviewing their hiſtory aud&nbsp;confidering their preſent ſtate, we might find a ſufficient nnmhër of facts to juſtify the above aflertion&nbsp;and we muſt not neglect to obſerve, that, as thoſe nations are not known to have ever been ſince their con-verfion to Mâhometanifm under a much happier government, or in a much more civilized ſtate than at preſent,&nbsp;it cannot be, with any degree of fairnefs, argued, with&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">refpect to Mahometaniſen as with reſpect to Chriitiani-.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">ty, that it is only when its influence is ſo oppoſed by other cauſes as to prevent it from producing its full effects,&nbsp;that it does not conduct thoſe ſocieties among which it&nbsp;is eftabliſhed to an high ſtate of civilization and refinement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Οηε, and that by no means an inconfiderable, part of the Koran, was occafionally invented to ſolve ſome difficulty with which the prophet found himſelf at the&nbsp;time perplexed, or to help him to the gratification of&nbsp;his ruling paſſions, luſt and ambition, when he and his&nbsp;followers were, at any time, unſucceſsful in thoſe wars&nbsp;by which he fought to propagate his religion, to prevent them from falling away into unbelief, or finking&nbsp;into deſpondency, he took care to inform them that&nbsp;God ſuſſered ſuch misfortunes to befal believers, as a&nbsp;pυniflιment for their fins, and to try their faith. The&nbsp;doctrine of predeſtination, which he affiduouſly inculcated, had an happy effect to perfuade his followers to&nbsp;ruſh boldly into the midſt of death and danger at his&nbsp;command. He prevailed with Zeyd to put away his -wife, married her himſelf, and pretended that his crime&nbsp;had the approbation of heaven ; and, in the Koran, he&nbsp;introduces the Deity approving of this marriage. Being repulſed from the fiege of Mecca, he made a league&nbsp;with the inhabitants ; but on the very next year, finding it convenient to ſurprife the city, by violating this&nbsp;treaty, he juſtified his perfidy by teaching his followers&nbsp;to difregard promiſes or leagues made with infidels. In&nbsp;ſome inſtances again, we find abſurd prohibitions en-joined for fimilar reafons : his officers, having on ſome&nbsp;occafion drunk to exceſs, excited much riot and confufion in the camp, he prohibited the uſe of wine and&nbsp;other inebriating liquors among his followers in future*&nbsp;Now, though it muſt be acknowledged that many evils&nbsp;ariſe from the uſe of theſe liquors, yet we cannot but&nbsp;think that, when uſed in moderation, they are in many&nbsp;cafés beneficial to men ; and certainly as much allowed&nbsp;by God as. opium, which the Mahometans have ſubſti-tuted in their place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mahomet· is allowed to have copied from the Chrb ſtian and the Jewiſh religions, as well as from the ido-latrous fiiperſtitions which prevailed through Arabia,&nbsp;and thus to have formed a motley mixture of reafon and&nbsp;abſurdity, of pure theiſm and wild ſuperſtition. He&nbsp;coniidered alfo the circumftances of his country, and&nbsp;the prejudices of his countrymen, when he attended&nbsp;to the former, he was generally judicious enough to&nbsp;fuit his doctrines and decifions to them with ſufficient&nbsp;ſkill ; the latter he alſo managed with the greateſt'art :&nbsp;but he entered into accommodation with them in in-ſtauces when a true prophet or a wiſe ;and upright le-gi∏ator would ſurely have oppofed them with decifive&nbsp;vigour. . where the prophet indulges his own fancy, <sub>7&nbsp;</sub>or borrows from the ſuperſtitions of hie countrymen,&nbsp;nothing can be more ridiculous than that.rhapſody of&nbsp;lies, contradictions, and extravagant fables, which he delivers to his followers.' Amazing are the abſurdities&nbsp;which he relates concerning the patriarchs, concerning&nbsp;. Solomon, and concerning- the&gt; animals that were affuιr&nbsp;bled in Noah’s ark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But in the whole tiſſue cf abfurdities of which his ſyſtem confiſts, there is nothing mere abſurd, or more&nbsp;happily calculated to promote impurity of manners, than&nbsp;his deſcriptions of heaven and hell ; the ideas of future&nbsp;rewards and puniſhments which he fought to imprefe</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
