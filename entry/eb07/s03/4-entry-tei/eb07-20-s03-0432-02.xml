 a Flemish painter, born at Antwerp in 1579, and bred under his countryman Henry Van Balen. His genius first displayed itself in painting fruit ; he afterwards attempted animals, huntings, &amp;c., in which he exceeded all his predecessors. He also painted kitchens, &amp;c, and gave dignity to subjects that seemed incapable of it. He was made painter to Ferdinand and Isabella, archduke and duchess, and became attached to the house of the cardinal infant of Spain. The king of Spain and the elector Palatine adorned their palaces with huntings by this artist. Rubens, Jordaens, and Snyders, used to co-operate in the enriching of each otherâ€™s pictures according to their several talents ; and thus they became more valuable than if finished by either of them singly. Snyders died in 1657.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
