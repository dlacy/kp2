<p><span class="font2">RESTOUT, Jean (1692-1768), French painter, born at Rouen, March 26, 1692, was the son of Jean Restout,&nbsp;the first of that name, and of Marie M. Jouvenet, sister&nbsp;and pupil of the well-known Jean Jouvenet. Jean&nbsp;Restout’s father died young, and his son was placed at&nbsp;Paris with his uncle Jean Jouvenet. In 1717, the Royal&nbsp;Academy having elected him a member on the work which&nbsp;he had executed for the Great Prize, he remained in Paris,&nbsp;instead of proceeding to Italy, exhibited at all the salons,&nbsp;and filled successively every post of academical distinction.&nbsp;He died on January 1, 1768. He left several pupils, none&nbsp;of whom were of great distinction. His works, chiefly of&nbsp;vast size—altarpieces (Louvre Museum), ceilings, designs&nbsp;for Gobelin tapestries—were much engraved by Cochin,&nbsp;Drevet, and others ; his diploma picture may still be seen&nbsp;at St Cloud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RESTOUT, Jean Bernard, son of the above, was born at Paris, February 22, 1732, and died in the same city on&nbsp;July 18, 1797. In 1758 he won the Great Prize, and on&nbsp;his return from Italy was received into the Academy ; but&nbsp;his refusal to comply with rules led to a quarrel with that&nbsp;body which alienated him from his profession. Roland&nbsp;brought him into notice by appointing him keeper of the&nbsp;Garde Meuble, but this piece of favour nearly cost him his&nbsp;life during the Terror : he was cast into prison and was&nbsp;only saved from the guillotine by the reaction of Thermidor.&nbsp;The St Bruno painted by him at Rome is in the Louvre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETFORD, East, a market town and borough of Nottinghamshire, is situated on the Idle and on the Great&nbsp;Northern and Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire&nbsp;Railways, 36 miles north-east of Nottingham by rail, and&nbsp;eight south-west of Gainsborough. The church of St&nbsp;Swithin, a large cruciform structure with a square embattled tower, dates from the 13th century, but was rebuilt&nbsp;in 1658 by a brief granted by Richard Cromwell. Among&nbsp;the modern buildings are the town-hall, the corn exchange,&nbsp;the court-house, and the covered markets. There is a large&nbsp;trade in corn, cheese, and hops, and the town possesses iron&nbsp;foundries, paper and corn mills, and india-rubber works.&nbsp;The population of the municipal borough in 1871 was&nbsp;3191, but in 1878 the area was extended to 4532 acres,&nbsp;and in 1881 the population was 9748.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The town derives its name from an ancient ford over the Idle. In Domesday it is written </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Redeford,</span><span class="font1"> and early in the 13th century&nbsp;it is called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Este Reddfurthx.</span><span class="font1"> It is a borough by prescription, and&nbsp;was granted in 1279 to the burgesses by Edward I. at a fee farm&nbsp;rent of £10, with the right of choosing a bailiff. Its rights were&nbsp;confirmed and extended by Edward III., Henry IV., and James I.&nbsp;It sent two members to parliament in the reign of Edward I., but&nbsp;the privilege was dormant from 1330 to 1571. The parliamentary&nbsp;borough, which was largely rural, having been extended in 1829&nbsp;to include the whole wapentake of Bassetlaw, and comprising&nbsp;207,906 acres in 1881, ceased to exist as a borough in 1885. The&nbsp;municipal borough is divided into three wards, and is governed by&nbsp;a mayor, six aldermen, and eighteen councillors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETHEL, Alfred (1816-1859), historical painter, was born at Aix-la-Chapelle in 1816. He very early showed an&nbsp;interest in art, and at the age of thirteen he executed a&nbsp;drawing which procured hi3 admission to the academy of&nbsp;Düsseldorf. Here he studied for several years, and produced, among other works, a figure of St Boniface which&nbsp;attracted much attention. At the age of twenty he&nbsp;removed to Frankfort where he studied under Philip Veit;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and, having, in common with so many of the German artists of the period, manifested an aptitude for fresco-painting, he was selected to decorate the walls of the imperial&nbsp;hall at Römer with figures of famous men. At the same&nbsp;period he produced a series of designs illustrative of Old&nbsp;Testament history. Four years later he was the successful&nbsp;competitor for the work of ornamenting the restored council&nbsp;house of his native city with frescos depicting prominent&nbsp;events in the career of Charlemagne, but various discussions&nbsp;and delays prevented the execution of this work for some&nbsp;six years. Meanwhile Rethel occupied himself with the&nbsp;production of easel pictures, and of drawings; and in 1842&nbsp;he began a most striking and important series of designs&nbsp;dealing with the Crossing of the Alps by Hannibal, in&nbsp;which the weird power which animates his later art&nbsp;becomes first apparent. In 1844 Rethel visited Rome,&nbsp;occupying his time both in study and in production, and&nbsp;executing, along with other subjects, an altarpiece for one&nbsp;of the churches of his native land. In 1846 he returned&nbsp;to Aix, and commenced his Charlemagne frescos. But&nbsp;the strain of production, aggravated by a lack of sympathy,&nbsp;and by vexatious delays and interferences, produced a most&nbsp;injurious effect upon both the health and the spirits of the&nbsp;artist. Symptoms of mental derangement, remotely attributable, it is believed, to an accident from which he&nbsp;suffered in childhood, began to manifest themselves in&nbsp;strange and groundless suspicions against his friends and&nbsp;brother artists. While he hovered between madness and&nbsp;sanity, “ with a mind ”—as Mr Ruskin has said in reference&nbsp;to the very parallel case of William Blake—“disturbed, but&nbsp;not deceived, by its sickness, nay, partly exalted by it,”&nbsp;Rethel produced some of the most striking, individual, and&nbsp;impressive of his works. Strange legends are told of the&nbsp;effect produced by some of his weird subjects. He painted&nbsp;Nemesis pursuing a Murderer—a flat stretch of landscape,&nbsp;with a slaughtered body relieved against the flushing&nbsp;evening sky, while in front is the assassin speeding away&nbsp;into the darkness, clutching his blood-stained knife, thorns&nbsp;and thistles springing up around his path, and above, hovering over his head, with unhasting but ceaseless flight, an&nbsp;angel of vengeance, holding an hour-glass from which the&nbsp;last sands are escaping, and a sword which is slowly&nbsp;descending upon the fated head. The picture, so the story&nbsp;goes, was won in a lottery at Frankfort by a personage of&nbsp;high rank, who had been guilty of an undiscovered crime,&nbsp;and the contemplation of his prize drove him to distraction,&nbsp;and he became a lunatic. Another design which Rethel&nbsp;executed was Death the Avenger, a skeleton appearing at a&nbsp;masked ball, scraping daintily, like a violinist, upon two&nbsp;human bones. The drawing haunted the memory of his&nbsp;artist friends and disturbed their dreams ; and, in expiation, he produced his pathetic design of Death the Friend,&nbsp;a skeleton draped in long monk’s robes, tolling solemnly&nbsp;the passing bell in a church tower, while beside the open&nbsp;window, lit by the last sunset radiance, sits an old sexton,&nbsp;with the peaceful face of a quiet departure. Rethel also&nbsp;executed a powerful series of drawings—the Dance of&nbsp;Death—suggested by the Belgian insurrections of 1848.&nbsp;It is by such designs as these, executed in a technique&nbsp;founded upon that of Dürer, and animated by an imagination akin to that of the elder master, that Rethel is most&nbsp;widely known. Certainly his fame can rest very securely&nbsp;upon such works as Death the Avenger and Death the&nbsp;Friend,—those “inexpressibly noble and pathetic wood'&nbsp;cut grotesques,” as Mr Ruskin has so justly styled them.&nbsp;Rethel died at Düsseldorf on December 1, 1859.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His picture of Peter and John at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple, is preserved in the Leipsic Museum, and his St Boniface&nbsp;and several of his cartoons for the frescos at Aix in the Berlin&nbsp;National Gallery. His life by Wolfgang Müller von Königswinter&nbsp;has been published.
