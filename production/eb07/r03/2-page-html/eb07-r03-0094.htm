<p><span class="font0">RYOTS, in the policy of Hindustan, the name by which the renters of land are distinguished. They hold their&nbsp;possessions by a lease, which may be considered as perpe-tual, and at a rate fixed by ancient surveys and valuations.&nbsp;This arrangement has been so long established, and accords&nbsp;so well with the ideas of the natives concerning the distinction of castes, and the functions allotted to each, that it&nbsp;has been invariably maintained in all the provinces subject&nbsp;either to Mahommedans or Europeans ; and to both it&nbsp;serves as the basis on which their whole system of finance&nbsp;is founded. Respecting the precise mode, however, in&nbsp;which the ryots held their possessions, there are many different opinions, for which we refer to Robertson’s Historical Disquisition concerning India.</span></p>

From his infancy&nbsp;he was very fond of books ; but he applied himself wholly&nbsp;to books of entertainment, such as novels and poetry of all&nbsp;kinds, especially Spanish and Italian authors.
