Afterwards becoming a monk he entered the monastery of Argenteuil, and then that of St Denis, and described himself as <hi rend="italic">regis Francorum Chronographus.</hi>  Rigor wrote the <hi rend="italic">Gesta Philippi Augusti,</hi>  dealing with the Efe of the French king, Philip , Augustus, from his coronation in 1179 until 1206. The work, which is very valuable, was abridged and continued by William the Breton (q.v.). The earlier part of the <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi>  speaks of the king in very laudatory terms, but in the latter part it is much less flattering in its tone. It is published in tome xvii. of Dom Bouquet’s <hi rend="italic">Recueil des historiens des Gaules el de la France </hi>(Paris, 1738-1876); and with introduction by H. F. Delaborde (Paris, 1882-85). A French translation of the <hi rend="italic">Gesta</hi>  is in tome xi. of Guizot’s <hi rend="italic">Collection des mémoires relatifs à Vhistoire de France</hi>  (Paris, 1825). Rigord also wrote a short chronicle of the kings of France.</p><p>See A. Potthast <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Jiistorica</hi>  (Berlin, 1896); and A.

In general the term is opposed to “ latitudinarianism ” or “ indifferentism,”— respectively a morality of compromise and a morality of pure indifference,—and signifies insistence upon the strictest interpretation of a principle, rule or criterion. Thus, in Roman Catholic theology, a rigorist holds that in cases of conscience the proper course is to adhere to the strict wording of the law in question.</p><p>RILEY, JAMES WHITCOMB (1853-    ), American poet,</p><p>was born in Greenfield, Indiana, in 1853. He spent several years as an itinerant sign-painter, actor and musician. During this vagabond experience he had opportunities to revise plays and compose songs, and was brought into close touch with the rural folk of Indiana, becoming famiEar with their life and speech. About 1873 he first contributed verses, especially in the Hoosier dialect, to the papers, and he soon became local editor of the Anderson (Ind.) <hi rend="italic">Democrat.</hi>  In August 1877, over the initials “ E.A.P.,” he printed in the Kokomo (Indiana) <hi rend="italic">Dispatch</hi>  a poem, <hi rend="italic">Leonainie,</hi>  in the manner of Poe.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  The press throughout the country copied the oem, and many critics of acknowledged authority believed it to have been actually written by Poe, until the hoax was explained by the paper in which it first appeared. To the Indianapolis<hi rend="italic">Daily Journal </hi>Riley contributed many poems, the best known being a series in dialect which purported to have been written by one “ Benjamin F. Johnson, of Boone,” a farmer. These he published in book form, under the same pen-name, as <hi rend="italic">The Old Swimmin<hi rend="sup"> </hi>Hole and Leven More Poems</hi>  (1883). He wrote short stories and sketches, some of unusual merit, but is known almost exclusively as a poet. Of his poems some are in conventional English many others in the Hoosier dialect of the Middle-West. His materials are the homely incidents and aspects of village and country life, especially of Indiana, and his manner is marked by delicate imagination and naïve humour and tenderness. </p><p>@@@ The poem was accompanied by a statement from the editor of the paper that it was “ from the gifted pen of the erratic poet, Edgar Allan Poe,” and by a circumstantial story to the effect that the poem had been found written on the fly-leaf of an old Latin-English dictionary then owned by ‘‘an uneducated and illiterate man ” in Kokomo, who had received it from his grandfather, in whose tavern, near Richmond, Va., it had been left by “ a young man who showed plainly the marks of dissipation.”</p><lb/><p>The bulk of his work appeared in <hi rend="italic">The Boss Girl and Other Sketches </hi>(1886), republished in 1891 as <hi rend="italic">Sketches in Prose: Afterwhiles</hi>  (1887); <hi rend="italic">Pipes o’ Pan at Zekesbury</hi>  (1888); <hi rend="italic">Rhymes of Childhood</hi>  (1890); <hi rend="italic">Neighborly Poems</hi>  (1891); <hi rend="italic">The Flying Islands of the Night</hi>  (1891), a fantastic blank verse drama; <hi rend="italic">Green Fields and Running Brooks </hi>(1892); <hi rend="italic">Poems Here at Home</hi>  (1893); <hi rend="italic">Armazindy</hi>  (1894), which contains the poem ” Leonainie ”; <hi rend="italic">A Child-WoM</hi>  (1896k reminiscent of his own boyhood; <hi rend="italic">The Rubdiydt of Doc Sifers</hi>  (1897); <hi rend="italic">Home Folks</hi>  (1900); <hi rend="italic">TJie Book of Joyous Children</hi>  (1902); <hi rend="italic">His Pa’s Romance</hi>  (1903); <hi rend="italic">A Defective Santa Claus</hi>  (1904); and in several books of selections, such as <hi rend="italic">Old Fashioned Roses</hi>  (1889), published in England; <hi rend="italic">Child Rhymes</hi>  (1898); <hi rend="italic">Love Lyrics</hi>  (1899); <hi rend="italic">Tne Golden Year</hi>  (1899), published in England; <hi rend="italic">Farm Rhymes</hi>  (1901); <hi rend="italic">An Old Sweetheart of Mine</hi>  (1902); <hi rend="italic">Out to Old Aunt Mary’s</hi>  (1004); <hi rend="italic">Songs o’ Cheer</hi>  (1905); <hi rend="italic">Morning</hi>  (1907); and <hi rend="italic">Songs of Summer</hi>  (1908).</p><p>RIMBAUD, JEAN ARTHUR (1854-1891), French poet and adventurer, was born at Charleville, in the Ardennes, on the 20th of October 1854. He was the second son of a captain in the French army, who in i860 abandoned his wife and family. From early childhood Arthur Rimbaud, who was severely brought up by his mother, displayed rich intellectual gifts and a sullen, violent temperament. He began to write when he was ten, and some of the poems which now appear in his works belong to his fifteenth year. Before he was sixteen, in consequence of a violent quarrel with his mother, the boy escaped from CharleviIle with a packet of his verse, was arrested as a vagabond, and for a fortnight was locked up in the Mazas prison, Paris. A few days after being taken home Rimbaud escaped again, into Belgium, where he Eved for some time as a tramp, Mmost starved, but writing verses with feverish assiduity. In February 1871 he left his mother for a third time, and made his way to Paris, where he knew no one, and whence, after very nearly dying of hunger and exposure, he begged his way back to Charleville. There he wrote in the same year the extraordinary poem of <hi rend="italic">Le Bateau ivre,</hi>  which is now hailed as the pioneer- of the entire “ symboEst ” or “ decadent ” movement in French literature in aU its forms. He sent it to Verlaine, who encouraged the boy of seventeen (whom he supposed to be a man of thirty) to come again to Paris. Rimbaud spent from October 1871 to July 1872 in the capital, partly with Verlaine, partly as the guest of Théodore de Banville, and served in the army of the Commune. With Verlaine he travelled for thirteen months, after the faU of the Commune, through England and Belgium, where in 1873 he pubEshed the only work which he ever printed, <hi rend="italic">Une Saison en Enfer,</hi>  in prose; in this he gives an allegorical account of his extravagant relations with Verlaine, which ended at Brussels by a double attempt of the latter to murder his young companion. On the second occasion Rimbaud was dangerously wounded by Verlaine’s revolver, and the elder poet was imprisoned at Mons for two years. MeanwhileRimbaud, deeply disillusioned, determined to abandon Europe and Eterature, and he ceased at the age of nineteen to write poetry. He settled for a while at Stuttgart, studying German, and in 1875 he disappeared. He set out on foot for Italy, and after extraordinary adventures found employment as a day-labourer in the docks at Leghorn. Returning to Paris, he obtained a little money from his mother, and then definitely vanished. For sixteen years nothing whatever was heard of him, but it is now known that he embarked as a Dutch soldier for the Sunda Isles, and, presently deserting, fled to Sumatra and then to Java, where he lived for some time in the forest. Returning to Europe, after a vagabond life in every capital, he obtained in 1880 some menial employment in the quarries of Cyprus, and then worked his way to Aden and up into Abyssinia, where he was one of the pioneers of European commercial adventure. Here he settled, at Harrar, as a trader in coffee and perfumes, to which he afterwards added gold and ivory; for the next eleven years, during which he led many commercial expeditions into unknown parts of northern Africa, Shoa and Harrar were his headquarters, and he lived almost entirely with the natives, and as one of themselves. From 1888 to 1891, having prospered greatly as a<hi rend="bold"/>merchant, he became a sort of semi-independent chieftain, intriguing for France, just</p></body></text></TEI>
