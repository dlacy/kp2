In this light we ſee clearly that the memory of the juſt is bleſſed.</p><p>At length his health began to be impaired by inceſſant ſtudy, and about the twenty-ſeventh year of his age he fell into a conſumption, which waſted him by ſlow degrees. Rut during the whole time of his ſickneſs he behaved with the utmoſt reſignation, nor did he ever ſhow the leaſt impatience.</p><p>When his friends came to viſit him, he would ſay, “he had reaſon to bleſs God it was no worſe with him than it was. And (ſays he) when you have the charity to remember me in your prayers, do not think me a better man than I am; but look on me, as indeed I am, a miſerable ſinner.” Upon the twentieth day of June 1678 he died, in the greateſt calmneſs, in the twenty-eighth year of his age, and was buried in the King’s College-Church in Old Aberdeen. The principal work of Scougal is a ſmall treatiſe intitled, The Life of God in the Soul of Man. This book is not only valuable for the ſublime ſpirit of piety which it breathes, but for the purity and elegance of its ſtyle; qualities for which few Engliſh writers were diſtinguiſhed before the Revolution.</p><p>SCOUTS, in a military ſenſe, are generally horſe- men ſent out before, and on the wings of an army, at the diſtance of a mile or two, to diſcover the enemy, and give the general an account of what they ſee.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SCRATCH-pans,</hi> in the Engliſh ſalt-works, a name given to certain leaden pans, which are uſually made about a foot and an half long, a foot broad, and three inches deep, with a bow or circular handle of iron, by which they may be drawn out with a hook when the liquor in the pan is boiling.

It ſignifies,</p><p>1. A clerk, writer, or ſecretary. This was a very conſiderable employment in the court of the kings of Judah, in which the ſcripture often mentions the ſecretaries as the firſt officers of the crown. Seraiah was ſcribe or ſecretary to king David (2 Sam. viii. 17). Shevah and Shemaiah exerciſed the ſame office under the fame prince (2 Sam. xx. 25). In Solomon’s time we find Elihoreph and Ahiah ſecretaries to that prince (1 Kings iv. 4). Shebna under Hezekiah (2 Kings xix. 2). And Shaphan under Joſiah (2 Kings xxii. 8). As there were but few in thoſe times that could write well, the employment of a ſcribe or writer was very conſiderable.</p><p>2. A ſcribe is put for a commiſſary or muſter-maſter of an army, who makes the review of the troops, keeps the liſt or roll, and calls them over. Under the reign of Uzziah king of Judah, there is found Jeil the ſcribe who had under his hand the king’s armies (2 Chr. xxvi. II). And at the time of the captivity, it is ſaid the captain of the guard, arhong other conſiderable perlons, took the principal ſcribe of the hoſt, or ſecretary at war, which rnuſtered the people of the land ( 2 Kings XXV. 19).</p><p>3.	Scribe is put for an able and ſkilful man, a doctor of the law, a man of learning that underſtands affairs. Jonathan, David’s uncle by the father’s ſide, was a counſellor, a wife man, and a ſcribe (1 Chr. xxvii. 32). Baruch, the diſciple and ſecretary to Jeremiah, is called a <hi rend="italic">ſcribe</hi> (Jer. xxxvi. 26). And Ezra is celebrated as a ſkilful ſcribe in the law of his God (Ezra vii. 6). The ſcribes of the people, who are frequently mentioned in the Goſpel, were public writers and profeſſed doctors of the law, which they read and explained to the people.
