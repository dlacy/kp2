<p><span class="font0">of the Church, was justified in interfering in the internal affairs of particular states. Unfortunately, most matters could be&nbsp;viewed from both a secular and religious standpoint; and even&nbsp;in purely secular affairs the claims of the pope to at least indirect&nbsp;control were practically unlimited. The specific nature of the&nbsp;abuses which flourished in the papal monarchy, the unsuccessful&nbsp;attempts to remedy them, and the measures taken by the chief&nbsp;European states to protect themselves will become apparent as&nbsp;we hastily review the principal events of the 14th and 15th&nbsp;centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As one traces the vicissitudes of the papacy during the two centuries from Boniface VIII. to Leo X. one cannot fail to be&nbsp;impressed with the almost incredible strength of the&nbsp;ecclesiastical state which had been organized and&nbsp;fortified by Gregory VII., Alexander III., Innocent III.&nbsp;and Gregory IX. In spite of the perpetuation of&nbsp;all the old abuses and the continual appearance of new&nbsp;devices for increasing the papal revenue; in spite of&nbsp;the jealousy of kings and princes, the attacks of legists&nbsp;and the preaching of the heretics ; in spite of seventy&nbsp;years of exile from the holy city, forty years of distracting&nbsp; schism and discord, and thirty years of conflict with&nbsp;stately oecumenical councils deliberating in the name of the&nbsp;Holy Spirit and intent upon permanently limiting the papal&nbsp;prerogatives; in spite of the unworthy conduct of some of those&nbsp;who ascended the papal throne, their flagrant political ambitions,&nbsp;and their greed; in spite of the spread of knowledge, old and&nbsp;new, the development of historical criticism, and philosophical&nbsp;speculation; in spite, in short, of every danger which could&nbsp;threaten the papal monarchy, it was still intact when Leo X. died in 1521. Nevertheless, permanent if partial dissolution&nbsp;was at hand, for no one of the perils which the popes had&nbsp;seemingly so successfully overcome had failed to weaken the&nbsp;constitution of their empire; and it is impossible to comprehend&nbsp;its comparatively sudden disintegration without reckoning with&nbsp;the varied hostile forces which were accumulating and combining strength during the 14th and 15th centuries. The first&nbsp;serious conflict that arose between the developing modern state&nbsp;and the papacy centred about the pope’s claim that the property&nbsp;of the clergy was normally exempt from royal taxation.&nbsp;Boniface VIII. was forced to permit Edward I. and Philip the&nbsp;Fair to continue to demand and receive subsidies granted by the&nbsp;clergy of their realms. Shortly after the bitter humiliation of&nbsp;Boniface by the French government and his death in 1303, the&nbsp;bishop of Bordeaux was elected pope as Clement V. (1305). He&nbsp;preferred to remain in France, and as the Italian cardinals died&nbsp;they were replaced by Frenchmen. The papal court was&nbsp;presently established at Avignon, on the confines of France,&nbsp;where it remained until 1377. While the successors of Clement V.&nbsp;were not so completely under the control of the French kings&nbsp;as has often been alleged, the very proximity of the curia to&nbsp;France served inevitably to intensify national jealousies. The&nbsp;claims of John XXII. (1316-1334) to control the election of the&nbsp;emperor called forth the first fundamental and critical attack&nbsp;on the papal monarchy, by Marsiglio of Padua, who declared in&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Defensor pacis</span><span class="font0"> (1324) that the assumed supremacy of the&nbsp;bishop of Rome was without basis, since it was very doubtful&nbsp;if Peter was ever in Rome, and in any case there was no evidence&nbsp;that he had transmitted any exceptional prerogatives to&nbsp;succeeding bishops. But Marsiglio’s logical and elaborate&nbsp;justification for a revolt against the medieval Church produced&nbsp;no perceptible effects. The removal of the papal court from&nbsp;Rome to Avignon, however, not only reduced its prestige but&nbsp;increased the pope’s chronic financial embarrassments, by&nbsp;cutting off the income from his own dominions, which he could&nbsp;no longer control, while the unsuccessful wars waged by John&nbsp;XXII., the palace building and the notorious luxury of some&nbsp;of his successors, served enormously to augment the expenses.&nbsp;Various devices were resorted to, old and new, to fill the treasury.&nbsp;The fees of the Curia were raised for the numberless favours,&nbsp;dispensations, absolutions, and exemptions of all kinds which&nbsp;were sought by clerics and laymen. The right claimed by the&nbsp;pope to fill benefices of all kinds was extended, and the amount&nbsp;contributed to the pope by his nominees amounted to from a&nbsp;third to a half of the first year’s revenue (sec Annates). Boniface VIII. had discovered a rich source of revenue in the jubilee,&nbsp;and in the jubilee indulgences extended to those who could not&nbsp;come to Rome. Clement VI. reduced the period between these&nbsp;lucrative occasions from one hundred to fifty years, and Urban&nbsp;VI. determined in 1389 that they should recur at least once in a&nbsp;generation (every thirty-three years). Church offices, high and&nbsp;low, were regarded as investments from which the pope had his&nbsp;commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">England showed itself better able than other countries to defend itself against the papal control of church preferment.&nbsp;From 1343 onward, statutes were passed by parliament&nbsp;forbidding any one to accept a papal provision, and&nbsp;cutting off all appeals to the papal curia or ecclesiastical courts in cases involving benefices. Nevertheless, as a statute of 1379 complains, benefices&nbsp;continued to be given “ to divers people of another language&nbsp;and of strange lands and nations, and sometimes to actual&nbsp;enemies of the king and of his realm, which never made&nbsp;residence in this same, nor cannot, may not, nor will not&nbsp;in any wise bear and perform the charges of the same&nbsp;benefice in hearing confessions, preaching or teaching the&nbsp;people.” When, in 1365, Innocent VI. demanded that the&nbsp;arrears of the tribute promised by King John to the pope should&nbsp;be paid up, parliament abrogated the whole contract on the&nbsp;ground that John had no right to enter into it. A species of&nbsp;anti-clerical movement, which found an unworthy leader in&nbsp;John of Gaunt, developed at this time. The Good Parliament of&nbsp;1376 declared that, in spite of the laws restricting papal provisions, the popes at Avignon received five times as much&nbsp;revenue from England as the English kings themselves.&nbsp;Secularization was mentioned in parliament. Wycliffe began&nbsp;his public career in 1366 by proving that England was not&nbsp;bound to pay tribute to the pope. Twelve years later he was,&nbsp;like Marsiglio, attacking the very foundations of the papacy&nbsp;itself, as lacking all scriptural sanction. He denounced the&nbsp;papal government as utterly degraded, and urged that the vast&nbsp;property of the Church, which he held to be the chief cause of&nbsp;its degradation, should be secularized and that the clergy should&nbsp;consist of “ poor priests,” supported only by tithes and alms.&nbsp;They should preach the gospel and encourage the people to seek&nbsp;the truth in the Scriptures themselves, of which a translation&nbsp;into English was completed in 1382. During the later years&nbsp;of his life he attacked the doctrine of transubstantiation, and&nbsp;all the most popular institutions of the Church—indulgences,&nbsp;pilgrimages, invocation of the saints, relics, celibacy of the clergy,&nbsp;auricular confession, &amp;c. His opinions were spread abroad by&nbsp;the hundreds of sermons and popular pamphlets written in&nbsp;English for the people (see Wycliffe). For some years after&nbsp;Wycliffe’s death his followers, the Lollards, continued to carry&nbsp;on his work; but they roused the effective opposition of the&nbsp;conservative clergy, and were subjected to a persecution which&nbsp;put an end to their public agitation. They rapidly disappeared&nbsp;and, except in Bohemia, Wycliffe’s teachings left no clearly&nbsp;traceable impressions. Yet the discussions he aroused, the&nbsp;attacks he made upon the institutions of the medieval Church,&nbsp;and especially the position he assigned to the Scriptures as the&nbsp;exclusive source of revealed truth, serve to make the development&nbsp; of Protestantism under Henry VIII. more explicable than&nbsp;it would otherwise be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wycliffe’s later attacks upon the papacy had been given point by the return of the popes to Rome in 1377 and the&nbsp;opening of the Great Schism which was to endure&nbsp;for forty years. There had been many anti-popes in&nbsp;the past, but never before had there been such prolonged&nbsp; and genuine doubt as to which of two lines&nbsp;of popes was legitimate, since in this case each was supported&nbsp;by a college of cardinals, the one at Rome, the other at Avignon.&nbsp;Italy, except Naples, took the side of the Italian pope; France,&nbsp;of the Avignon pope; England, in its hostility to France,</span></p>
