<p><span class="font0">April 1191. Thus the powerful counts of Tusculum disappeared; they sought refuge in the Campagna, and&nbsp;according to all probability the no less potent family of&nbsp;the Colonna sprang from their line. In consequence of&nbsp;these events, the nobles realized that the papacy sought to&nbsp;reduce them to vassalage. And, seeing that the republic&nbsp;remained firmly established and able to help them, they&nbsp;began to adhere to it and succeeded in obtaining admission&nbsp;to the new senate. In fact, whereas since 1143 plebeians&nbsp;and petty nobles had prevailed in its ranks, nobles of&nbsp;ancient descent are now found outnumbering the knights&nbsp;and burghers. But in 1191 this state of things caused a&nbsp;sudden popular outbreak which abolished the aristocratic&nbsp;senate and gave the headship of the republic to a single&nbsp;senator, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">summus senator,</span><span class="font0"> named Benedetto “ Carissimus ”&nbsp;or “ Carus Homo” or “ Carosomo, ” of unknown, but&nbsp;undoubtedly plebeian, origin. During the two years he&nbsp;remained in office this personage stripped the pope of his&nbsp;revenues, despatched </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">justitiarii</span><span class="font0"> even to the provinces, and&nbsp;with the aid of the parliament and other popular assemblies&nbsp;promulgated laws and statutes. But he was overthrown&nbsp;by a counter-revolution, and Giovanni Capoccio of the&nbsp;party of the nobles became senator for two years, and had&nbsp;been succeeded by one of the Pierleoni when, in 1197, a&nbsp;fresh revolution re-established a senate of fifty-six members,&nbsp;chiefly consisting of feudal barons in high favour with&nbsp;Henry VI., who had revived the imperial faction in Rome.&nbsp;But this emperor’s life ended the same year as the pope’s,&nbsp;in 1198, and the new pontiff Innocent III. (1198-1216)&nbsp;began to make war on the nobles, who were again&nbsp;masters of the republic. Their leader was the prefect&nbsp;Pietro di Vico. Owing to the revolution of 1143 most&nbsp;of the prefectorial attributes were now vested in the&nbsp;senate ; nevertheless Pietro still retained a tribunal of&nbsp;police both within and without the city. But his main&nbsp;strength λvas derived from the vast possessions of the Vico&nbsp;family, in which the office of prefect now became hereditary.&nbsp;Very soon, however, these prefects of Vico were chiefly&nbsp;regarded as the great feudal lords of Tuscia, and the&nbsp;independent municipal office lost its true character. Then&nbsp;the popes made a point of according great pomp and&nbsp;dignity to this nominal prefect, in order to overshadow the&nbsp;senator, who still represented the independence of the&nbsp;republic and had assumed many of the attributes wrested&nbsp;from the prefect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But Innocent III., dissatisfied with this state of things, contrived by bribing the people to arrogate to himself the&nbsp;right of electing the senator, who had now to swear fealty&nbsp;and submission to the pope, and also that of nominating&nbsp;the provincial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">justitiarii,</span><span class="font0"> formerly chosen by the Government of the Capitol. This was a deadly blow to the&nbsp;republic, for the principal rights of the people, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font0"> the election of pope and emperor, prefect and senate, were now&nbsp;lost. The general discontent provoked fresh revolutions,&nbsp;and Innocent III. employed all his political dexterity to&nbsp;ward off their effects. But shortly afterwards the people&nbsp;made a loud outcry for a senate of fifty-six members ; and&nbsp;the pope, again making a virtue of necessity, caused that&nbsp;number to be chosen by twelve </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mediani</span><span class="font0"> specially named&nbsp;by him for the purpose. Even this did not calm the&nbsp;popular discontent, which was also stirred by other disputes. The consequence was that when, six months later,&nbsp;the pope again elected a single senator the Romans rose&nbsp;to arms, and in 1204 formed a Government of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Buoni&nbsp;Uomini</span><span class="font0"> in opposition to that created by the pope. But&nbsp;an amicable arrangement being concluded, the pope once&nbsp;more nominated fifty-six senators ; and when, soon after, he&nbsp;again reduced them to one, the people were too weary to&nbsp;resist (1205). Thus the Capitol was subdued, and Innocent</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">III. spent his last years in tranquillity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 22d November 1220 Honorius III. (1216-27) conferred the imperial crown on Frederick IL, who confirmed to the church the possession of her former states,&nbsp;of those bequeathed to her by countess Matilda, and even&nbsp;of the March of Ancona. But it was soon seen that he&nbsp;sought to dominate all Italy, and was therefore a foe to&nbsp;be dreaded. The successor of Honorius, Pope Gregory&nbsp;IX. (1227-41) was speedily insulted and put to flight by&nbsp;the Ghibelline nobles, whose courage had revived, and the&nbsp;republic began to subdue the Latian cities on its own&nbsp;account. Peace was several times made and unmade by&nbsp;pope and people ; but no enduring harmony was possible&nbsp;between them, since the former wished to subject the&nbsp;entire state to the church, and the latter to escape from&nbsp;the rule of the church and hold sway over “ the universal&nbsp;land from Ceprano to Radicofani ” formerly, belonging to&nbsp;the duchy. Accordingly the Roman people now appointed&nbsp;judges, imposed taxes, issued coin, and made the clergy&nbsp;amenable to secular tribunals. In 1234 the senator Luca&nbsp;Savelli published an edict declaring Tuscia and Campania&nbsp;territories of the republic, and sentjudges thither to exact&nbsp;an oath of obedience. He also despatched the militia to&nbsp;the coast, where it occupied several cities and erected&nbsp;fortresses ; and columns λvere raised everywhere inscribed&nbsp;with the initials S. P. Q. R. The pope, unable to prevent&nbsp;but equally unable to tolerate these acts, fled from Rome,&nbsp;hurling his anathema against Savelli, “ et omnes illos con-siliarios urbis quorum consilio,” Ac. The Romans sacked&nbsp;the Lateran and the houses of many cardinals, and&nbsp;marched on Viterbo, but were driven back by the papal&nbsp;troops. When Savelli left office and Angelo Malabranca&nbsp;was elected in his stead, the people made peace and submission in 1235, and were obliged to give up their pretensions of subjecting the clergy to ordinary tribunals and&nbsp;the urban territory to the republic. Thus matters were&nbsp;virtually settled on the footing established by Innocent</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">III., thanks to the aid given to the pope by Frederick II., who had been one of the promoters of the rebellion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may appear strange that, at this period of their history, the Romans, after showing such tenacious adherence to the republic and senate, should have accepted the&nbsp;rule of a single senator without rushing to arms, and&nbsp;passed and repassed from one form of government to&nbsp;another with such surprising indifference. But on closer&nbsp;examination it is plain that these changes were greater in&nbsp;appearance than reality. We have already seen, in treating of Carosomo, how the single senator convoked the&nbsp;people in parliament to pass sanction on the laws. But,&nbsp;whenever there is only one senator, we also continually&nbsp;meet with the expression “ consilium vel consilia urbis.”&nbsp;It is evident that when, instead of laws to be approved in&nbsp;parliament by a simple placet or rejected by a non-placet,&nbsp;matters requiring consideration had to be discussed, the&nbsp;senator convoked a much smaller council, consisting only&nbsp;of the leaders of the people. These leaders were the&nbsp;heads of the twelve or thirteen regions, of the guilds, now&nbsp;becoming organized and soon to be also thirteen in&nbsp;number, and of the militia. As in the other Italian&nbsp;republics, all these associations had been formed in Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The senator therefore held consultation with the leading men of the city ; and, although, especially at first, these&nbsp;meetings were rather loosely organized, it is clear that&nbsp;they took the form of two councils—one numerous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(fion-siglio maggiore),</span><span class="font0"> the other limited </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(consigliο minore</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">spéciale),</span><span class="font0"> co-operating with and forming part of the first.&nbsp;Such was the prevailing custom throughout Italy at the&nbsp;time when Roman institutions most nearly resembled&nbsp;those of the other republics. We already know that, from&nbsp;the date of Arnold’s reforms, the senate, with its junta of&nbsp;counsellors, had been divided into two parts, forming when</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
