Let G be its&nbsp;centre of oſcillation correſponding to the momentary&nbsp;centre oſ rotation C. It will begin to deſeend in the&nbsp;ſame manner as jf all its matter were collected in O:&nbsp;for<sup>-</sup> it may be conſidered, in this inſtant, as a pendulum ſuſpended at C. But in this caſe O will deſeend&nbsp;in the ſame manner as if the body were falling freely.&nbsp;Therefore the velocity of G (that is, the velocity of de-ſcent) will be to the velocity with which a heavy body&nbsp;would fall as CG to CO. Now ſince the points C, G,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">o, </span><span class="font0">are always in a horizontal line, and the radius CG is&nbsp;given'; as alſo CO (n<sup>0</sup>48.) the velocity of a body falling· freely, and of the body unwinding from this thread,&nbsp;will always be in the ſame proportion of CO to CG,&nbsp;and ſo will the ſpaces deſeribed in any given time. And&nbsp;thus we can compare their motions in every caſe when&nbsp;we know the place of the centre of oſcillation.</span></p>

The weight of the defeending body will be to the tenſion of the thread as CO to GO : for the&nbsp;ten ſion of the thread is the difference between the momentum of thé rolling body and that of the body falling freely.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Obſerve, that this proportion between the weight of the body and the tenſion of the thread will be always&nbsp;the ſame; for it has been demonſtrated already, n<sup>o</sup> 42.&nbsp;that if C be in the circumference of a circle whoſe&nbsp;centre is G, O will be in the circumference of another&nbsp;circle round the ſame centre, and therefore the ratio&nbsp;of CG to CO is conſtantl</span></p>

If a circular body TCB roll down an inclined plane by unfolding a thread, or by friction which prevents all Aiding, the ſpace deſeribed will be to that&nbsp;which the body would deſcribe freely as CG to CO ;&nbsp;for the tendency down the inclined plane is a determined proportion of the weight of the body. The&nbsp;motion of rotation in theſe caſes, both progreſſive and&nbsp;whirling, is uniformly accelerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Something of the ſame kind obtains in common pendulous bodies. A ball hung by a thread not only&nbsp;oſcillates, but alſo makes part of a rotation ; and for&nbsp;this reaſon its oſcillations differ from thoſe of a heavy&nbsp;point hanging by the ſame thread, and the centre of&nbsp;oſcillation is a little below the centre of the ball. A&nbsp;ball hung by a thread, and oſeillating between cycloidal&nbsp;cheeks, does not ofcillate like a body in a cycloid, becauſe its centre of oſcillation is continually ſhiſting&nbsp;its place. Huyghens avoided this by ſuſpending his&nbsp;pendulous body from two points, ſo that it did not&nbsp;change its attitude during its oſcillation. If ourſpring-carriages w<sup>r</sup>ere hung in this manner, having the four&nbsp;lower ſtaples to wſhich the ſtraps are fixed as far aſun-rier as the four upper ſtaples at the ends of the ſprings,&nbsp;the body of the carriage would perform its oſcillations&nbsp;without kicking up and down in the diſagreeable manner they now do, by which we are frequently in danger oſ ſtriking the glaſſes with our heads. The ſwings&nbsp;would indeed be greater, but incomparably eaſeer; and&nbsp;we could hold things almoſt as ſteadily in our hand&nbsp;as if the carriage were not fwinging at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This will ſuſſice for an account of the rotation round fixed axes, as the foundation for a theory of machines&nbsp;actually performing work. The limits oſ our under</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">taking will not .allow us to do any more than juſt point out the method of applying it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let there be any machine of the rotatory kind, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i. e. </span><span class="font0">compoſed of levers or wheels, and let its conſtruction be&nbsp;ſuch, that the velocity of the point to wſhich the power&nbsp;is applied (which we ſhall call the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">impelled point)</span><span class="font0"> is to&nbsp;the velocity of the working point in the ratio of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vι</span><span class="font0"> to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n.</span><span class="font0"> It is well known that the energy of this machine&nbsp;will be the ſame with that of an axis in peritrochio, of&nbsp;which the radii are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ρ</span><span class="font0"> expreſs the actual preſſure exerted on the impelled point by the moving power, and let </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font0"> be the actual preſſure or reſiſtance exerted on the working&nbsp;point by the work to be performed. Let </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">χ</span><span class="font0"> be the&nbsp;inertia of the power, or the quantity of dead matter&nbsp;which muſt move with the velocity of the impelled&nbsp;point in order that the moving power may act. Thus&nbsp;the moving power may be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the weight</span><span class="font0"> of a bucket of&nbsp;water in a water-wheel ; then </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font0"> is the quantity of&nbsp;matter in this bucket of water. Let </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font0"> in like manner be&nbsp;the inertia of the w<sup>τ</sup>ork, or matter which muſt be moved with the velocity oſ the working-point, in order&nbsp;that the work may be performed. Thus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font0"> may be a&nbsp;quantity of water which muſt be continually puſhed&nbsp;along a pipe. This is quite different from the weight&nbsp;of the water, though it is proportional to it, and may&nbsp;be meafured by it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ</span><span class="font0"> be a preſſure giving the ſame reſiſtance when applied at the w'orking-point with the friction of the&nbsp;machine, and let </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aη<sup>i</sup></span><span class="font0"> be the momentum of the machine’s&nbsp;inertia, viz. the fame as if a proper quantity of matter </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> were attached to the working-point, or to any&nbsp;point at the fame diſtance from the axis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This ſtate of things may- be repreſented by the wſheel and axle PQS (ſig. 7.) wſhere </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font0"> and y and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> are&nbsp;repreſented by weights acting by lines. P is the impelled point, and R the working-point; CP is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;CR is«. 'Ihe moving force is repreſented by PA,&nbsp;the reſiſtance by RB, and the friction by BF.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is evident that the momentum of the inertia of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x, y,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> are the ſame as if they were for -a moment&nbsp;attached to the points P and R.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hence we derive the following expreſſions,</span></p>
