This work, which is one of the most voluminous of our ancient histories, is more valuable for the&nbsp;sincerity with which it is written, and the great variety of&nbsp;facts which it contains, than for the beauty of its style or&nbsp;the regularity of its arrangement.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROHAN, Henry Duke of, peer of France, and prince of Leon, was bom at the Chateau de Blein, in Brittany, in&nbsp;1579. Henry IV. under whose eye he gave distinguished&nbsp;proofs of his bravery at the siege of Amiens, when only sixteen years of age, loved him with as much affection as if he&nbsp;had been his own son. After the death of Henry, he became chief of the Calvinists in France; and was equally&nbsp;formidable for his genius as his sword. In defence of the&nbsp;civil and religious rights of his party, he maintained three&nbsp;wars against Louis XIII. The first, which terminated to&nbsp;the advantage of the Protestants, broke out when that&nbsp;prince wished to establish the Romish religion in Bearn ;&nbsp;the second, because of the siege which Cardinal de Richelieu ordered to be laid to Rochelle ; and the third, when&nbsp;that place w<sup>τ</sup>as besieged a second time. The consequences&nbsp;of this war are sufficiently known : Rochelle surrendered,&nbsp;and the duke de Rohan, perceiving, that after the taking of&nbsp;this place, the majority of his party were endeavouring to&nbsp;make up matters with the court, succeeded in procuring&nbsp;for them a general peace in 1629, upon very honourable&nbsp;and advantageous terms. There is a very particular anecdote of him, extracted from the Memoirs of the Duchess of&nbsp;Rohan, Margaret of Bethune, daughter of the famous Sully.&nbsp;While the duke de Rohan was at Venice, a proposal was&nbsp;made to him from the Porte, that for 200,000 crowns, and an&nbsp;annual tribute of 20,000, the grand signior would give him&nbsp;the island of Cyprus, and fully invest him with the dignity&nbsp;and prerogatives of king. The duke was warmly inclined&nbsp;to comply with this proposal, and to settle in the island the&nbsp;Protestant families of France and Germany. He negoci-ated this business at the Porte by means of the intervention&nbsp;of the patriarch Cyril, with whom he had much correspondence ; but different circumstances, and in particular the&nbsp;death of the patriarch, contributed to break off the treaty.&nbsp;The republic of Venice chose Rohan for their commander&nbsp;in chief against the Imperialists ; but Louis XIII. took him&nbsp;from the Venetians, and sent him ambassador into Switzerland, and into the Grisons. He wished to assist these people&nbsp;in bringing back La Valteline under their obedience, the&nbsp;revolt of which the Spaniards and Imperialists encouraged.&nbsp;Rohan, being declared general of the Grisons, after many&nbsp;victories drove the German and Spanish troops entirely from&nbsp;La Valteline in 1633. He again defeated the Spaniards in&nbsp;1636, at the banks of the lake of Come. France, not thinking it proper to withdraw her troops, the Grisons rose up&nbsp;in arms, and the duke de Rohan, not satisfied with the conduct of the court, entered into a special treaty with them on&nbsp;the 28th of March 1637. This hero, fearing the resentment&nbsp;of Cardinal de Richelieu, retired to Geneva, with a view to&nbsp;join his friend the duke of Saxe-Weimar, who wished him&nbsp;to undertake the command of his army, then ready to engage the Imperialists near Rhinfeldt. Although he declined this honour, yet he took the command of the regiment&nbsp;of Nassau, with which he threw the enemy into confusion ;&nbsp;but was himself wounded, 28th February 1638, and died of&nbsp;his wounds the 13th of April following, at the age of fifty-nine. He wrote several interesting performances: 1. The&nbsp;Interests of Princes, printed at Cologne in 1666, in 12mo;&nbsp;in which work he fully examines the public interests of all&nbsp;the princes of Europe. 2, The Perfect General, or an</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Abridgement of the Wars from Casar's Commentaries, in 12mo. Here he makes it appear, that a knowledge of the&nbsp;tactics of the ancients might be of much use to the modems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Treatise on the Corruption of the Ancient Militia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Treatise on the Government of the thirteen Provinces. 5. Memoirs ; the best edition of which is in two&nbsp;vols. 12mo. They contain the history of France from 1610&nbsp;to 1629. 6. A Collection of some Political Discourses on&nbsp;State Affairs, from 1612 to 1629, 8vo, Paris, 1644, 1693,&nbsp;1755 ; with the Memoirs and Letters of Henry Duke de&nbsp;Rohan relative to the War of La Valteline, three vols. 12mo,&nbsp;Geneva, 1757. This was the first edition which appeared&nbsp;of these curious memoirs : we owe it to the great attention&nbsp;and diligence of Baron de Zurlauben, who published them&nbsp;from different authentic manuscripts. He likewise ornamented this edition with geographical, historical, and genealogical notes, and a preface, which contains an abridged&nbsp;but highly interesting life of the duke de Rohan, author of&nbsp;the memoirs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROHAULT, James, a celebrated Cartesian philosopher, was the son of a merchant of Amiens, where be was bom&nbsp;in 1620. He became well skilled in the mathematics, and&nbsp;taught them at Paris. He died at Paris in 1675. He wrote&nbsp;in French, 1. A Treatise on Natural Philosophy; 2. The&nbsp;Elements of Mathematics ; 3. A Treatise on Mechanics,&nbsp;which is very curious ; 4. Philosophical Conversations, and&nbsp;other works. His Physics have been translated into Latin&nbsp;by Dr Samuel Clarke, with notes, in which the Cartesian&nbsp;errors are corrected upon the Newtonian system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROHILCUND, in Sanscrit </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kuttair</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kuttaher,</span><span class="font0"> an extensive and valuable district of Hindustan, situated between the rivers Ganges and Goggra, and between the twenty-eighth and thirtieth degrees of north latitude, and from&nbsp;seventy-eight to eighty east longitude. It is extremely&nbsp;well watered by the rivers Ganges and Ramgunga. The&nbsp;latter traverses the country throughout its whole extent,&nbsp;and joins the Ganges at Kanoge. Many smaller streams&nbsp;intersect the country, and contribute to its fertility, being&nbsp;distributed by means of canals and reservoirs. Water is&nbsp;also found by digging a foot under ground. With all these&nbsp;advantages, this country is remarkably fertile, and was extremely productive and well cultivated under its native sovereigns, though, when it was ceded to the British in 1801&nbsp;by the nabob of Oude, it was in a state of desolation, owing to his tyranny and extortion. It abundantly produces&nbsp;grain of all sorts, sugar-cane, indigo, cotton, and tobacco.&nbsp;It also contains large forests of valuable timber, the wood&nbsp;of which is floated down the Dewall or Goggra, which issues&nbsp;from the Kemaon Mountains, and runs past the town of Pillibeet, and is thence embarked for Patna, Calcutta, and other&nbsp;large towns in the south. Its chief towns are Bareilly, Bis-sowly, Budavon, Moradabad, Owlah, Pillibeet, Rampore,&nbsp;Sumbul, with several others. In the early history of the&nbsp;Mogul empire, Rohilcund is celebrated as a very flourishing&nbsp;country, and of great political importance ; and in many&nbsp;parts are still to be seen the remains of magnificent edifices,&nbsp;palaces, gardens, mosques, colleges, and mausoleums. In&nbsp;more recent times this district was occupied by a number&nbsp;of Afghans of the tribe of Roh or Rohillas. Tbe founders&nbsp;of the dynasty were two brothers, named Shah Aalum, and&nbsp;Hussein Khan, who quitted Afghanistan about the year 1673,&nbsp;and settled in this country, where they pursued some inconsiderable employments under the<sub>z</sub>Emperor Aurungzebe.&nbsp;Their descendants acquired possession of a considerable territory, which they ruled with prudence and moderation ; and&nbsp;their territories were cultivated like a garden. A quarrel&nbsp;ensued between them and the nabob of Oude, to whose vengeance they were consigned by the British, who sent troops&nbsp;to aid in their extermination, under the understood condition&nbsp;that they were to share in the spoil. They were defeated&nbsp;by the British troops ; and their country, given up to fire and</span></p>
