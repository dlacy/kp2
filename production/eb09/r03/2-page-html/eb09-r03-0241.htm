<p><span class="font1">present site on the south side of the town between 1710 and 1750. In 1809 it was rebuilt from designs by Hake-will; the chapel, dedicated to St Lawrence, was added in&nbsp;1820. At the tercentenary of the school in 1867 subscriptions were set on foot for founding scholarships, building&nbsp;additional schoolrooms, rebuilding or enlarging the chapel,&nbsp;and other objects. The chapel was rebuilt and reconsecrated in 1872. A swimming bath was erected in 1876;&nbsp;the Temple observatory, containing a fine equatorial refractor by Alvan Clark, was built in 1877, and the Temple reading room with the art museum in 1878. The workshops&nbsp;underneath the gymnasium were opened in 1880, and a new&nbsp;big school and class rooms were erected in 1885. There&nbsp;are three major and four minor exhibitions for students to&nbsp;any university in the United Kingdom. From about 70&nbsp;in 1777 the numbers attending the school have increased&nbsp;to over 400. A great impulse was given to the progress&nbsp;of the school during the headmastership of Dr Arnold,&nbsp;1827-1842. The best known of Arnold’s successors are&nbsp;Tait, afterwards archbishop of Canterbury, and Temple,&nbsp;the present bishop of London. The parish church of&nbsp;St Andrew’s is, with the exception of the tower and the&nbsp;north arcade in the nave, entirely modern, having been&nbsp;built from designs by Mr Butterfield at a cost of £22,000,&nbsp;and reconsecrated in 1879. The daughter church of the&nbsp;Holy Trinity, a handsome building by Sir Gilbert Scott,&nbsp;in close proximity to St Andrew’s, was erected in 1853.&nbsp;St Marie’s Catholic Church is in the Early English&nbsp;style. A town-hall was erected in 1858, at a cost of&nbsp;£7000. There are a number of charities, including&nbsp;Laurence Sheriff’s almshouses (founded 1567), Elborow’s&nbsp;almshouses (1707), Miss Butlin’s almshouses (1851),and the&nbsp;hospital of StCross, opened in 1884, at a cost of £20,000.&nbsp;A public recreation ground was provided by the local&nbsp;government board in 1877. The town has an important cattle market. The population of the urban sanitary&nbsp;district (area 1617 acres) in 1871 was 8385, and in 1881&nbsp;it was 9891.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rugby was originally a hamlet of the adjoining parish of Clifton-on-Dunsmore, and is separately treated of as such in Domesday Book. Ernaldus de Bosco (Ernald de Bois), lord of the manor of&nbsp;Clifton, seems to have erected the first chapel in Rugby, in the&nbsp;reign of Stephen, about 1140. It was afterwards granted by him,&nbsp;with certain lands, to endow the abbey of St Mary, Leicester,&nbsp;which grant was confirmed by his successors and by royal charter&nbsp;of Henry II. In the second year of King John (1200) a suit took&nbsp;place between Henry de Rokeby, lord of the manor of Rugby, and&nbsp;l’aul, abbot of St Mary, Leicester, which resulted in the former&nbsp;obtaining possession of the advowson of Rugby, on condition of&nbsp;homage and service to the abbot of Leicester. By virtue of this&nbsp;agreement the chapel was converted into a parish church, and the&nbsp;vicarage into a rectory. In 1350 Ralph, Lord Stafford, became&nbsp;possessed of the manor and advowson of Rugby, and considerably&nbsp;enlarged the parish church. Subsequent alterations, notably in&nbsp;1814 and 1831, left little of this structure remaining except the&nbsp;tower and north arcade in the nave. The advowson of Kugby is&nbsp;now the property of the earl of Craven ; and the late rector was&nbsp;widely known and honoured as “the poet pastor,” John Moultrie.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUGE, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Arnold</span><span class="font1"> (1803-1880), German philosophical and political writer, was born at Bergen, in the island of&nbsp;Rügen, on the 13th September 1803. He studied at&nbsp;Halle, Jena, and Heidelberg, and became an enthusiastic&nbsp;adherent of the party which sought to create a free and&nbsp;united Germany. For his zeal in this cause he had to&nbsp;spend five years in the fortress of Kolberg, where he&nbsp;devoted himself to the study of classical writers, especially&nbsp;Plato and the Greek poets. On his release in 1830, he&nbsp;published </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Schill und die Seinen,</span><span class="font1"> a tragedy, and a translation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Edipus in Colonus.</span><span class="font1"> Ruge settled in Halle, where&nbsp;in 1838, in association with his friend Echtermayer, he&nbsp;founded the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hallesche JahrlAjxher für deutsche Eunst und&nbsp;Wissenschaft.</span><span class="font1"> In this periodical, which soon took a very&nbsp;high place, he discussed all the great questions which&nbsp;were then agitating the best minds in Europe, dealing&nbsp;with them from the point of view of the Hegelian philosophy, interpreted in the most liberal sense. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jahrbücher</span><span class="font1"> was detested by the orthodox party in Prussia ; but,&nbsp;as it was published in Leipsic, the editors fancied that it&nbsp;was beyond the reach of the Prussian Government. In&nbsp;1840, however, soon after the accession of King Frederick&nbsp;William IV., they were ordered, on account of the name&nbsp;of the periodical, to have it printed in Halle, subject to the&nbsp;censorship there. Thereupon Ruge went to Dresden, and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jahrbücher</span><span class="font1"> (with which Echtermayer was no longer&nbsp;connected) continued to appear in Leipsic, but with the&nbsp;title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deutsche Jahrbücher,</span><span class="font1"> and without the names of the&nbsp;editors. It now became more liberal than ever, and in&nbsp;1843 was suppressed by the Saxon Government. In Paris&nbsp;Ruge tried to act with Karl Marx as co-editor of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dewtsch-Französische Jahrbücher,</span><span class="font1"> but the two friends soon&nbsp;parted, Ruge having little sympathy with Marx’s socialist&nbsp;theories. Ruge next associated himself with a publishing&nbsp;firm in Zürich, and when it was put down he attempted&nbsp;to establish a firm of his own in Leipsic, but his scheme<sup>-</sup>was thwarted by the Saxon Government. In the revolutionary movement of 1848 Ruge played a prominent part.&nbsp;He organized the Extreme Left in the Frankfort parliament, and for some time he lived in Berlin as the editor&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reform,</span><span class="font1"> in which he advocated the opinions of the&nbsp;Left in the Prussian National Assembly. The career of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reform</span><span class="font1"> being cut short by the Prussian Government,&nbsp;Ruge soon afterwards visited Paris, hoping to establish,&nbsp;through his friend Ledru-Rollin, some relations between&nbsp;German and French republicans; but in 1849 both&nbsp;Ledru-Rollin and Ruge had to take refuge in London.&nbsp;Here, in company with Mazzini and other advanced politicians, they formed a “ European Democratic Committee.”&nbsp;From this committee Ruge soon withdrew, and in 1850&nbsp;he went to Brighton, where he supported himself by&nbsp;working both as a teacher in schools and as a writer.&nbsp;He took a passi mate interest in the events of 1866&nbsp;and 1870, and as a publicist vigorously supported the&nbsp;cause of Prussia against Austria, and that of Germany&nbsp;against France. In his last years he received from the&nbsp;German Government a pension of 3000 marks. He died&nbsp;on the 31st December 1880.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruge was a man of generous sympathies and an able writer, but he did not produce any work of enduring importance. In 1846-48&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gesamnwlte Schriften</span><span class="font0"> were published in ten volumes. After this&nbsp;time he wrote, among other books, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unser System, Revolutionsnovellen, Die Loge des Humanismus,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aus früherer Zeit</span><span class="font0"> (bis&nbsp;memoirs). He also wrote many poems, and several dramas and&nbsp;romances, and translated into German various English works, including the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters of Junius</span><span class="font0"> and Buckle’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RÜGEN, the largest island belonging to Germany, is situated in the Baltic Sea, immediately opposite the town&nbsp;of Stralsund, l£ miles off the north-west coast of&nbsp;Pomerania in Prussia, from which it is separated by the&nbsp;narrow Strelsasund. Its shape is exceedingly irregular,&nbsp;and its coast-line is broken by very numerous bays and&nbsp;peninsulas, sometimes of considerable size. The general&nbsp;name is applied by the natives only to the roughly triangular main trunk of the island, while the larger peninsulas,&nbsp;the landward extremities of which taper to very narrow&nbsp;necks of land, are considered to be as distinct from Rügen&nbsp;as the various adjacent smaller islands which are also&nbsp;statistically included under the name. The chief peninsulas are those of Jasmund and Wittow on the north, and&nbsp;Mönchgut, at one time the property of the monastery of&nbsp;Eldena, on the south-east ; and the chief neighbouring&nbsp;islands are Unmanz and Hiddensoe, both off the northwest coast. The greatest length of Rügen from north to&nbsp;south is 32 miles ; its greatest breadth is 251 miles ; and&nbsp;its area is 377 square miles. The surface gradually rises&nbsp;towards the west to Rugard (335 feet), the “eye of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
