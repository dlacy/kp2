<p><span class="font0">like that </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">fluids, or that of elastic substances compressed, the horizontal resistance would be to the weight nearly as&nbsp;two fifths of the length of the part immersed at once, in&nbsp;the newly formed rut, to the diameter of the wheel ; or, on&nbsp;a still more probable supposition respecting the greater resistance of the more deeply-seated parts of the rut, about&nbsp;half as much as this, or as about one fifth of the length of&nbsp;the part immersed in the rut to the diameter. Thus, if a&nbsp;coach or waggon, weighing sixty hundredweight, supported by wheels four feet in diameter, formed a new rut, an&nbsp;inch deep, in a smooth road, the length of the part immersed being about fourteen inches, the resistance w ould be&nbsp;about Xth of the weight, upon the lowest supposition that&nbsp;is at alt admissible, and more probably about one ninth, or&nbsp;from six to seven hundredweight at least ; and if the rut&nbsp;were two inches deep, the resistance would be half as much&nbsp;more. But, on any supposition, the increased height, and&nbsp;even the increased breadth, of the wheel, is calculated to&nbsp;diminish the resistance, by diminishing the depth of the part&nbsp;immersed ; thus, if a wheel were made four times as high,&nbsp;the length of the part immersed, considering the road as an&nbsp;imperfect fluid, would be doubled, and the resistance would&nbsp;be diminished, theoretically speaking, to about half of its&nbsp;former magnitude ; and if the breadth were increased from&nbsp;one to eight, the length of the part immersed would be diminished to about a half, and the resistance w*ould in this&nbsp;case also be reduced to a half.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In soft and boggy soils, as well as in sandy roads, this consideration is of great importance ; and the wheels employed for removing heavy weights, in such cases, ought to&nbsp;be as high and as broad as possible consistently with sufficient lightness and economy. But whether a broad, and,&nbsp;at the same time, a low roller, possesses any advantages&nbsp;above a narrow coach-wheel, is a matter much more questionable : it must be remembered that a narrow wheel may&nbsp;often run between stones, where a broader would have to&nbsp;pass over them ; and there appears to be no theoretical reason for preferring a low roller, except with respect to a single&nbsp;pair of wheels, as affording a more convenient attachment&nbsp;for the shafts in a moderate inclination, which is both more&nbsp;favourable to the exertion of the horses, and more effective&nbsp;in overcoming the friction ; since it has been demonstrated&nbsp;that the angle affording the most advantageous line of&nbsp;draught is exactly the same as the inclination of a plane&nbsp;along which the carriage would just begin to descend by&nbsp;its ow<sup>,</sup>n weight on the same kind of surface. In fact, however, there is no necessity for fixing the axle-tree precisely&nbsp;in the line of draught ; and the principal reason for having&nbsp;the fore wheels lower than the others is for the convenience&nbsp;of turning the carriage more abruptly. A very accurate&nbsp;practical road-maker has observed, that a good road never&nbsp;suffers from narrow wheels with moderate weights not in&nbsp;rapid motion, but that it is equally worn by the rapid driving of heavy stage-coaches, and by the slow grinding of the&nbsp;conical rollers of overloaded, broad-wheeled waggons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such being the operations of the wheels of carriages on sandy or on rough roads, it is easy to perceive how much&nbsp;the hardness and smoothness of the surface must facilitate&nbsp;the draught ; it is obvious also that the same qualities must&nbsp;be equally conducive to the durability of the road, since&nbsp;the inequalities will always cause the carriage to fall on it&nbsp;with a certain impetus after being elevated by the irregularities, and the same shock which strains the carriage will&nbsp;also tend to wear away the road still more where it is lowest ;&nbsp;and, on the other hand, the resistance of. the soft materials&nbsp;before the wheel will tend to tear up the road, as it causes&nbsp;the wheel to thrust them before it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It happens not very uncommonly that the interests of the traveller and the postmaster are somewhat at variance&nbsp;with respect to the qualities of a road. The French postilion keeps to the rough pavement as long as the aching&nbsp;limbs of the ladies in the carriage will allow them to be&nbsp;silent, except when, in going down hill, he saves himself&nbsp;the trouble of locking the wheel, by bringing it to the soft&nbsp;edge of the ditch or kennel ; and the horses of the Parisian&nbsp;cabriolets, in their excursions to the suburbs, have sagacity&nbsp;enough to incline always to the pavement, when their drivers&nbsp;allow them to have a will of their own ; while a single horseman, on the contrary, more commonly finds his steed on the&nbsp;gravel road, if he happens to leave him to his own direction. In Great Britain the roads are commonly managed&nbsp;by commissioners, who have no community of interest with&nbsp;the innkeepers ; on the Continent they are universally under the immediate direction of the different governments,&nbsp;who also appoint the postmasters, while the carriages are&nbsp;almost as uniformly the property </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">particular individuals,&nbsp;who have no immediate influence on the management of&nbsp;the roads ; and this diversity may perhaps explain, in some&nbsp;measure, the different systems of road-making which prevail&nbsp;on the opposite sides of the channel. But it may be said&nbsp;of roads as of governments, “ that which is best administered is best ;” whether a very smooth pavement not too slippery, or a very hard gravel road not worn into great inequalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sect. II.—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Of the Mechanical Formation of Roads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The only strongly-marked division of the different kinds of roads depends on their being paved or gravelled ; but&nbsp;each of these classes admits of considerable diversity in the&nbsp;principles on which the road is constructed. The theory of&nbsp;pavement appears to be extremely simple ; the stones, however, may be either small or large ; the former being understood to be employed without previous preparation of their&nbsp;shape, as in the inferior kind of work which is called “ pitching” in the west of England ; the latter being more or less&nbsp;cut to fit each other, whether in the form of thick rough&nbsp;blocks, not very remote from cubes, or of flat and smooth&nbsp;flagstones. In the cities of Great Britain the former are&nbsp;commonly used for horse-pavements, and the latter for foot-passengers ; but in Florence the whole breadth of the streets&nbsp;is paved with flagstones placed diagonally, and in Naples&nbsp;the surfaces are nearly as smooth ; in both these cases it is&nbsp;necessary to roughen the stones frequently with chisels&nbsp;wherever there is a hill or a bridge, in order to prevent the&nbsp;horses slipping, but in both cities the horses from habit are&nbsp;sufficiently sure-footed, even when running with some rapidity. In Milan both kinds of pavements are mixed in the&nbsp;same streets ; the smooth in two double lines, for the wheels&nbsp;of carriages coming and going, and the rougher in the intermediate parts, for the feet of the horses, as in the British railroads. But in none of these cities is there much&nbsp;heavy traffic to wear these well-arranged surfaces into such&nbsp;inequalities as would probably soon be observed in the streets&nbsp;of London if they were so delicately formed ; although, until this deterioration actually took place, the locomotion&nbsp;would be luxurious both for the horses and for the passengers, and only ruinous to the coachmakers. The Romans&nbsp;used large and heavy blocks for their roads, cutting them&nbsp;on the spot into such forms as enabled them to be best adjusted to those of the neighbouring stones, though seldom&nbsp;exactly rectangular in their surfaces ; and even at Pompeii,&nbsp;where the ruts are worn half through the depth of the blocks,&nbsp;the bottom remains tolerably even, in a longitudinal direction, at least as much so as would be required for carts and&nbsp;other carriages of business.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our more particular object, however, at present, is the consideration of gravel-roads rather than of pavements ; the&nbsp;word gravel being here understood to mean in general all&nbsp;stone broken small, whether by nature or by art. The improvement of such roads has long been a subject of great&nbsp;interest with the agricultural and commercial inhabitants of&nbsp;Great Britain. It was soon after the year 1700 that a part</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
