For though in other felonies " malitia ſupplet ætatem yet, as to this particular fpecies of felony, the law ſup-poſes an imbecillity of body as well as mind.</p><p>The civil law ſeems to ſuppoſe a proſtitute or common harlot incapable of any injuries of this kind: not allowing any puniſhment for violating the chaſtity of her, who hath indeed no chaſtity at all, or at leaſt hath no regard to it. But the law of England does not judge ſo hardly of offenders, as to cut off all op-portunity of retreat even from common ſtrumpets, and to treat them as never capable of amendment. It therefore holds it to be felony to force even a concubine or harlot ; becauſe the woman may have forſaken that unlawful courſe of life : for, as Bracton well obſerves, " licet merctriχ fuerit antea, certe tunc temporis non fuit, cum reclaιnando nequitiæ ejus con-ſentire noluit.”</p><p>As to the material facts requiſite to be given in evi-dencε and proved upon an indictment of rape, they are of ſuch a nature, that, though neceſſary to be known and ſettled, for the conviction of the guiky and preſervation of the innocent, and therefore are to be found in ſuch criminal treatiſes as diſcourſe of theſe matters in detail, yet they are highly improper to be publicly dif-cuſſed, except only in a court of juſtice. we ſhall therefore merely add upon this head a few remarks from Sir Matthew Hale, with regard to the competen-ey and credibility of witneffes ; which may, <hi rend="italic">ſalvo pudore, </hi>be conſidered.</p><p>And, firſt, the party raviſhed may give evidence upon oath, aud is in law a competent witneſs ; but the credi-bility of her teſtimony, and how far forth ſhe is to be believed, muſt be left to the jury upon the circumſtances of fact that concur in that teſtimony. For inſtance : if the witneſs be of good fame; if ſhe preſently diſcovered the offence, and made ſearch for the offender; if the party accuſed fled for it ; thele and the like are concurring circumſtances, which give greater probability to her evidence. But, on the other ſide, if ſhe be of evil fame, and ſtand unſupported by others ; if ſhe con-cealed£the injury for any conſiderable time after ſhe had opportunity to complain ; if the place, where the fact was alleged to be committed, was where it was poſſible ſhe might have been heard, and ſhe made no outcry : theſe and the like circumſtances carry a ſtrong, but not concluſive, preſumption that her teſtimony is falſe or feigned.</p><p>Moreover, if the rape be charged to be committed on an infant under 12 years of age, ſhe may ſtill be a competent witneſs, if ſhe hath ſenfe and underſtanding to know the nature and obligations of an oath ; and, even if ſhe hath not, it is thought by Sir Matthew Hale, that ſhe ought to bc heard without oath, to give the court information ; though that alone will not be ſufficient to convict the offender. And he is of this opinion, ſirſt, Becauſe the nature of the offence being ſecret, there may be no other poſſiblc proof of the actual fact ; though afterwards there may be con-current circumſtances to corroborate it, proved by other witneffes : and, fccondly, Becauſe the law allows what the child told her mother, or other relations, to be given in evidence, ſince thc nature of the cafe admits frequently of no better proof ; and there is much more reafon for the court to hear the narration of the child herfelf, than to receive it at ſecond-hand from thoſe who ſwear they heard her fay ſo. And indeed it feems now to be fettled, that in theſij caſes infants of any age are to be heard ; and, if they have any idea of an oath, to be alſo fworn ; it being found by experience, that infants of very tender years often give the cleareſt and trueſt teſtimony. But in any of theſe caſes, whether the child be fworn or not, it is to be wiſhed, in order to render her evidence credible, that there ſhould be ſome concurrent teſtimony of time, place, and circumſtances, in order to make out the fact ; and that the conviction ſhould not be grounded ſingly on the unfupported accuſation of an infant under years of diſcretion. There may be therefore, in many caſes of this nature, witneffes who are competent, that is, who may be admitted to be heard ; and yet, after being heard, may prove not to be credible, or ſuch as the jury is bound to believe. For one excellence of the trial by jury is, that the jury are triers of the credit of the witneffes, as well as of thc truth of the fact.</p><p>" It is true (fays this learned judge), that rape is a moſt deteſtable crime, and therefore ought ſeverely and impartially to be puniſhed with death ; but it muſt be remembered, that it is an accuſation eaſy to be made, hard to be proved, but harder to be defended by the party accufed, though innocent.” He then relates two very extraordinary cafes of malicious proſecution for this crime, that had happened within his own ob- -ſervation ; and concludes thus : " I mention thefe inſtances, that we may be the more cautious upon trials of offences of this nature, wherein the court and jury may with ſo much eafe be impoſed upon, without great care and vigilance ; the heinoufneſs of the offence many times tranſporting the judge and jury with fo much indignation, that they are over-haſtily carried to the conviction of the perſons accnſed thereof, by the confident teſtimony of ſometimes falſe and malicious witneffes.”</p><p>RAPHAEL (D’Urbino), the greateſt, moſt ſublime, and moſt excellent painter that has appeared, ſince the revival of the fine arts, was the ſon of an indifferent painter named <hi rend="italic">Sαnzio,</hi>  and was born at Urbi-no on Good Friday 1482. The popes Julius II. and Leo X. who employed him, loaded him with wealth and honour ; and it is ſaid that cardinal De St Bibiana had ſuch a value for him, that he offered him his niece in marriage. His genius is admired in all his pictures ; his contours are free, his ordonnances magnificent, his deſigns correct, his figures elegant, his expreffiυns lively, his attitudes natural, his heads graceful ; in fine, every thing is beautiful, grand, ſublime, juſt, and adorn-ed with graces. Theſe various perfections he derived, not only from his excellent abilities, but from his ſtudy of antiquity and anatomy ; and from the friendſhip he contracted with Arioſto, who contributed not a little to the improvement of his taſte. His pictures are principally to be found in Italy and Paris. That of the Transfiguration, preſerved at Rome in the church of St Peter Monterio, paſſes for his mailer-piece.' He had a handſome perſon, was well proportioned, and had great ſweetneſs of temper ; was polite, affable, and mo-</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
