a gold coin, ſtruck at Venice, and in ſeveral parts of the Grand Signior’s dominions. In Turkey it is called <hi rend="italic">dahab,</hi> or piece of gold, and according to Volney is in value about 6s. 3d. Sterling. It varies, however, conſiderably in its value in different countries. At Venice it is equal to about 9s. 2d. Sterling.</p><p>The Venetian ſequms are in great requeſt in Syria, from the fineneſs of their ſtandard, and the practice they have of employing them for womens trinkets. The faſhion of theſe trinkets does not require much art ; the piece of gold is ſimply pierced, in order to ſuſpend it by a chain, likewiſe of gold, which flows upon the breaſt. The more ſequins that are attached to this chain, and the greater the number of theſe chains, the more is a woman thought to be ornamented. This is the favourite luxury, and the emulation of all ranks. Even the female peasants, for want of gold, wear piaſtres or ſmaller pieces ; but the women of a certain rank diſdain ſilver ; they will accept of nothing but ſequins of Venice, or large Spaniſh pieces, and cruſadoes. Some of them wear 200 or 300, as well lying flat, as ſtrung one on another, and hung near the forehead, at the edge of the head-dreſs. It is a real load : but they do not think they can pay too dearly for the ſatisfaction of exhibiting this treaſure at the public bath, before a crowd of rivals, to awaken whoſe jealouſy conſtitutes their chief pleasure. The effect of this luxury on commerce, is the withdrawing conſiderable ſums from circulation, which remain dead ; besides, that when any of theſe pieces return into common uſe, having loſt their weight by being pierced, it becomes necessary to weigh them. The practice of weighing money is general in Syria, Egypt, and all Turkey. No piece, however effaced, is refuſed there ; the merchant draws out his ſcales and weighs it, as in the days of Abraham, when he purchaſed his ſepulchre. In conſiderable payments, an agent of exchange is ſent for, who counts paras by thousands, rejects a great many pieces of falſe money, and weighs all the ſequins, either ſeparately or together.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
