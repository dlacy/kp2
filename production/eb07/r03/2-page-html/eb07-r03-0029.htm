<p><span class="font0">country, he fell into an ambuscade, which the Drevlians, now grown desperate, had formed on his approach, in the&nbsp;neighbourhood of Iskorosch. The Russians were soon overpowered, and Igor being made prisoner, was put to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Before the death of Oleg, Igor had married a princess of a bold and daring spirit, named Olga, by whom he had one&nbsp;son, Sviatoslaf ; but as this boy was very young at the death&nbsp;of his father, the queen-mother Olga assumed the reins of&nbsp;government. Her first care was to take signal vengeance&nbsp;upon the unhappy Drevlians, for having bravely defended&nbsp;themselves against the encroachments of foreign enemies.&nbsp;This tribe, satisfied with the death of their oppressor,&nbsp;appeared desirous of renewing their amicable intercourse&nbsp;with the Russians, and their chief, Male, is even said to&nbsp;have made an offer of his hand to Igor’s widow. Olga, with&nbsp;that deep cunning and concealed malice that so often mark&nbsp;the character of the despotic leader of a barbarous people, pretended to listen to their overtures, and received the deputies&nbsp;of Male, but immediately ordered them to be privately put&nbsp;to death. In the mean time she invited a larger deputation from the Drevlian chief, which she treated in the same&nbsp;inhuman manner, taking care that no tidings of either murder should be carried to the Drevlians. She then set out,&nbsp;as if on an amicable visit, to conclude the new alliance, and&nbsp;having proclaimed a solemn entertainment, to which she invited some hundreds of the principal inhabitants of the Drevlian towns, she caused them to be treacherously assassinated.&nbsp;But this was only the first step to the more dreadful vengeance&nbsp;which she had resolved to inflict on this deluded people.&nbsp;She laid waste the whole country of the Drevlians, and in&nbsp;particular the town near which Igor had lost his life. For&nbsp;a long time she could not master the place, as the inhabitants, dreading the horrible fate that awaited them, from&nbsp;the revengeful spirit of Olga, defended themselves with the&nbsp;utmost valour and success. At length, being assured of&nbsp;clemency, upon condition of sending to their besieger all the&nbsp;pigeons of the town, they submitted ; but the queen causing&nbsp;lighted matches to be fastened to the tails of the pigeons, set&nbsp;them at liberty. The birds flew to their usual places of residence in the town, which were speedily in a conflagration.&nbsp;The wretched inhabitants endeavouring to escape the flames,&nbsp;fell into the hands of the Russsian soldiers, planted around the&nbsp;town for that purpose, by whom they were put to the sword.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This was the only warlike transaction, if it deserves that name, which took place during the regency of Olga. Though&nbsp;not uncommon in the annals of a barbarous people, it would&nbsp;have been sufficient to hand down her name with detestation to posterity, had she not, in the opinion of her panegyrists, atoned for the enormity by attempting to introduce&nbsp;into her dominions the Christian religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Hitherto the Slavi, and the Scandinavian nations who had taken possession of their territories, were Pagans ; and their&nbsp;religious ceremonies, like those of all the surrounding nations, were marked by an absurd and cruel superstition.&nbsp;Their deities seem to have been borrowed, partly from the&nbsp;Greeks and Romans, and partly from the Scythians ; but&nbsp;were characterised by peculiar names, and represented by&nbsp;idols of complex workmanship and grotesque appearance.&nbsp;Thus, the god Perune, or Perkune, who was the chief among&nbsp;the Slavonian deities, was personated by an idol whose head&nbsp;was of silver, its ears and mustachios of massy gold, its legs&nbsp;of iron, and its trunk of hard incorruptible wood. It was&nbsp;decorated with rubies and carbuncles, and held in its hand&nbsp;a stone carved, being the symbol of lightning. The sacred&nbsp;fire burned continually before it ; and if the priests suffered&nbsp;this to be extinguished, they were doomed to perish in the&nbsp;flames, as enemies of the god. Sacrifices of their flocks to&nbsp;this supreme deity were regarded as trifling. His altar smoked with the blood of captives, and even the children of his&nbsp;worshippers were sometimes immolated to appease his wrath&nbsp;or propitiate his favour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is uncertain at what time the light of Christianity began to beam on the nations that occupied the banks </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of </span><span class="font1">the Dnieper, nor are we acquainted with the circumstances&nbsp;that led to the conversion of the queen-regent. We find,&nbsp;however, that about the middle of the tenth century, she&nbsp;undertook a journey to Constantinople for the express purpose of being initiated into the religion of Jesus. Constantine Porphyrogenneta, who then sat on the imperial throne,&nbsp;received the royal convert with the greatest honour and&nbsp;respect ; he himself conducted her to the baptismal font, and,&nbsp;in the character of her sponsor, gave to her the name of&nbsp;Helen. Her example, however, had little influence on her&nbsp;son, or the nation at large. The Russians do not seem to&nbsp;have been very ardent in their religious observances, nor peculiarly attached to the opinions of their forefathers ; but&nbsp;the nature of Christianity, and the character of its disciples,&nbsp;were not in their eyes sufficiently striking or alluring to produce any change in their religious system. Olga’s son,&nbsp;Sviatoslaf, either from his contempt for the unwarlike character of the Greek Christians, or through fear of the ridicule to which his conversion might subject him from his&nbsp;young companions, disregarded all his mother’s solicitations.&nbsp;He did not, however, prevent the people from receiving&nbsp;baptism, and a few proselytes were made. Though the&nbsp;character of Olga, even after her conversion to Christianity,&nbsp;was by no means such as to entitle her to the rank which&nbsp;she afterwards attained among the Russian saints, it appears that she had given her son many wise and prudent&nbsp;instructions respecting the government of his future empire.&nbsp;She travelled with him round the country ; superintended&nbsp;the erection of bridges and the making of roads, for the benefit of trade and commerce ; built several towns and villages, and founded such laudable institutions, as sufficiently&nbsp;evince her talents for governing a nation. She died about&nbsp;the year 969, at a very advanced age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is probable that Olga retired from the administration of affairs soon after her conversion to Christianity ; for we&nbsp;find Sviatoslaf in full possession of the government long&nbsp;before his mother’s death. This prince has been considered as one of the Russian heroes ; and if a thirst for blood, a&nbsp;contempt of danger, and a disregard of the luxuries and conveniences of life, be admitted as the characteristics of a hero,&nbsp;he deserves the appellation. His habits rendered him the&nbsp;idol of his army. He took up his habitation in the camp,&nbsp;where he led a life exactly similar to that of the meanest&nbsp;soldier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His first expedition was against the Kozares, a people who had come from the shores of the Caspian and the sides&nbsp;of the Caucasus, and had established themselves along&nbsp;the eastern coast of the Black Sea. They had rendered&nbsp;tributary both the Kievians, and the Viateches, a Slavonian&nbsp;nation that dwelt on the banks of the Oka and the Volga.&nbsp;Sviatoslaf, desirous of transferring to himself the tribute&nbsp;which the Kozares derived from the latter people, marched&nbsp;against them, and appears to have succeeded in his design.&nbsp;He defeated them in a pitched battle, and took by storm&nbsp;their capital city, Sarkel or Belgorod. It is said by some&nbsp;historians that he even annihilated the nation ; and certain it is, that from that time no mention is made of the&nbsp;Kozares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The martial fame of Sviatoslaf had extended to Constantinople ; and the Emperor Nicephorus Phocas, who was then harassed by the Ungrians, assisted by his treacherous&nbsp;allies the Bulgarians, applied for succours to the Russian&nbsp;chieftain. A subsidiary treaty was entered into between&nbsp;them, and Sviatoslaf hastened southward with a numerous&nbsp;army. He quickly made himself master of most of the&nbsp;Bulgarian towns along the Danube, and was so elated with&nbsp;his success that he determined to remove the centre of&nbsp;his government from Kief to the city of Pereiaslavatz, now&nbsp;Yamboly, situated upon the shores of that river.
