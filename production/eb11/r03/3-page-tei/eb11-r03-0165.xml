The molars (fig. 13, A) are rooted and have a plate-like structure, with the cusps or tubercles forming three longitudinal rows in those of the upper jaw, but only two distinct ones in the lower. By this structure the Murinac are broadly distinguished both from the Cricctinac (fig. 13. B) and the Microtinac. ln the skull the tympanic bulla is hollow, the pterygoid fossa shallow and the zygomatic arch slender, with a rudimentary’ jugal bone. The tail is long and scaly (fig. 12). The genus <hi rend="italic">Mus,</hi>  with about a couple of hundred species, includes the true mice and rats (sec Mouse and Rat), and has the typical characters of the group, the incisors being narrow and smooth, the molars small, the eyes and cars large and the tip of the muzzle naked, ln some cases there may be spines among the fur. None are much larger than the hrown rat <hi rend="italic">CM. norvegicus)</hi>  or smaller than the harvest mouse; and they all have habits generally similar to those of one or other of the English species, although some live in trees like squirrels, or in the water; among the latter being the brown-footed rat (M. <hi rend="italic">fuscipes)</hi>  of western and southern Australia (fig. 12). The genus <hi rend="italic">Nesocia</hi>  is like <hi rend="italic">Mus,</hi>  but with the incisors and molars broader, and the transverse laminae of the latter more clearly defined. This genus contains a few clumsily built rats spread over Southern Asia from Palestine to Formosa, and from Kashmir to Ceylon (see Bandicoot-Rat). Among other important genera <hi rend="italic">Cricetomys</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Eosaccomys</hi>  (both African) stand apart by the possession of cheek-pouches: <hi rend="italic">C. gambianus</hi>  being a very large species. The Javan <hi rend="italic">Pithechirus</hi>  has the thumb opposable, while the Papuan <hi rend="italic">Chirurornys</hi>  has the tip of the tail naked abo\*e and prehensile. The spiny mice, /Ifowyj (or <hi rend="italic">Acanthomys),</hi>  of Western Asia, Cyprus and Africa, take their name from the fur being almost entirely replaced by flattened spines, and are further distinguished by the rudimentary coronoid process of the lower jaw. <hi rend="italic">Dasymys </hi>is an allied African genus; while <hi rend="italic">Arvicanthis</hi>  includes the African striped mice. <hi rend="italic">Golunda,</hi>  from India and Africa, is like <hi rend="italic">Mus,</hi>  but with grooved upper incisors. <hi rend="italic">Vandeleuria,</hi>  ranging from India to Yunnan, has flat nails on the first and fifth toes of both feet, and a very long tail; while the Indo-Malay <hi rend="italic">Chiropodomys</hi>  has a flat nail on the first toe of both feet and a tufted tail. In the Philippines occur the peculiar genera <hi rend="italic">Batomys, Carpomys</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Crateromys, </hi>confined to the mountains of Luzon, the third remarkable for its huge size and long hair. <hi rend="italic">Mastacomys</hi>  is like <hi rend="italic">Mus,</hi>  but with the molars remarkably broadened, and with only four teats. The single species is from Tasmania, though it has been found fossil in New South Wales; it is somewhat similar in size and appearance to the English water-rat, but has longer and softer fur. <hi rend="italic">Uromys </hi>differs from <hi rend="italic">Mus</hi>  in having the scales of the tail not overlapping, but set edge to edge, so as to form a sort of mosaic work. There are several species, spread over the northern part of the Australian region from the Aru islands to Queensland. <hi rend="italic">Echinothrix</hi>  is a rat with an extremely elongated muzzle, all the bones of the face being much produced, and the incisors faintly grooved, the only species, <hi rend="italic">E. leucnra,</hi>  being about the size of the common rat, with its fur thickly mixed with spines, a native of Celebes., Australia is the home of the group of jumping species, known as jerboa-rats, characterized by the elongation of the hind limbs, arranged under the genera <hi rend="italic">Notomys, Dipodillus, Ammomys</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Conilurus,</hi>  distinguished from one another by the structure of the molars and the number of teats and foot-pads, the second being further character</p><p>ized by its long ears.</p><p>The large-eared African <hi rend="italic">Otomysand</hi>  the allied <hi rend="italic">Oreomys (Oreinomys), </hi>often made the type of a distinct sub-family, may be included in this section; as well as the small African tree-mice, <hi rend="italic">Dendromys, </hi>allied to which is <hi rend="italic">Deomys,</hi>  peculiar in the circumstance that only the first molar has three rows of cusps, the other two having only a couple of such rows, as in cricetines. Other allied African genera are <hi rend="italic">Steatornys</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Lophuromys,</hi>  which include several species of small mouse-like rodents, with the habits of dormice generally, though some burrow in cornfields. Here also may be noticed the huge Philippine long-haired rats of the genus <hi rend="italic">Phlaeomys, </hi>characterized by their broad incisors, transversely laminated molars and large claws. They are often regarded as forming a sub-family by themselves. The gerbils, which arc widely distri-buted over the more or less desert-like regions of the Old World exclusive of the Malay countries and Australia, form the sub-family GcrbilIinae. They have long hind limbs, large eyes and ears; and in correlation with the latter an enlarged auditory bulla to the skull, which is hollow and divided into a tympanic and a mastoid portion. The tail is generally long and hairy. There are three pairs of rooted molars, whose crowns carry transverse plates, decreasing in number from three in the first to one in the last tooth.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Gerbillus</hi>  (or <hi rend="italic">Tatera),</hi>  with a large number of species, has a range coextensive with that of the sub-family; <hi rend="italic">Pachyuromys,</hi>  with two African species, has a short club-shaped tail and enormous auditory bullae; while the remaining members of the group, which arc confined to North Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia, are arranged in the genera <hi rend="italic">Meriones, Psammomys</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Rhombomys,</hi>  the latter represented only by <hi rend="italic">R. opimus</hi>  from Russia and Central Asia (see GerbilJ.</p><p>The last representatives of the Muridae are confined to Australasia and the Philippines, and constitute the sub-family Hydromyinae, characterized by the very general presence of only two pairs of molars in each jaw. In the typical Australian and Papuan <hi rend="italic">Hydromys,</hi>  locally known as water-rats, the molars originally have transverse ridges, the enamel folds between which form cutting edges whose sharpness depends upon the degree to which the teeth have been worn, while the large hind feet are webbed. The typical <hi rend="italic">H. Chrysogaster</hi>  is a large brown rat with an orange belly, which feeds on small fishes and insects. <hi rend="italic">Limnomys,</hi>  from New Guinea, is a type less specialized for swimming, the hind-feet being much less twisted than in <hi rend="italic">Hydromys,</hi>  and not so fully webbed. Still less specialized are <hi rend="italic">Chrotomys</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Xerornys,</hi>  which include Philippine land-rats, while <hi rend="italic">Crunomys,</hi>  from the same area, retains the third molars, and thus connects the group with the Murinac.</p><p>Finally, the Philippine <hi rend="italic">Rhynchomys</hi>  is represented by a rat with two pairs of molars and a long shrew-like nose, the zygomatic arch of the skull being also placed unusually far backward.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Strand-Moles.-yWith</hi>  the so-called strand-moles of South Africa, forming the section Bathycrgoidea, and the family Bathyergidac, which were formerly placed with the Spalacidac, we come to the first of two sections in which the lower jaw has a totally different form to that obtaining in all the preceding groups. In the rodents now to be considered, the angular process of the lower jaw arises from the outer side of the sheath of the incisor. The malleus and incus cf the internal ear are united, and there is no transverse canal in the skull. At least one pair of premolars is present in each jaw; and these teeth and the molars typically have one outer and one inner enamel fold. There is no foramen at the lower end of the humerus, and no horny layer in the stomach.</p><p>In the Bathyergoidea the scaphoid and lunar of the carpus ate separate, the tibia and fibula united and the clavicles normal. The masseter muscle does not pass through the narrow infra-orbital canal, and the temporal muscle is large. All the Bathycrgidae arc African, and adapted to a burrowing life, having minute ears and eyes, a short tail and the thumb armed with a large claw. The largest species represents the genus <hi rend="italic">Bathyergus,</hi>  while several smaller kinds are included in <hi rend="italic">Georychus,</hi>  The former constructs its tunnels in the sandy flats near the shore at the Cape, but the latter generally frequent higher ground, in both genera there is only a single pair of premolars in each iaw, but in the smaller <hi rend="italic">Myoscalops</hi>  there are usually three pairs of these teeth. The most remarkable members of the family arc the sand-rats of Somaliland and Shoa, forming the genera <hi rend="italic">Heterocephalus</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Fornarina,</hi>  in which the premolars may be reduced to two pairs. They ha\c large heads,projecting incisors, no cars, almost fUnctionlcss eyes and moderately long tails; the skin, with the exception of a few hairs on the body and fringes on the feet, being naked. They spend their whole time buried in the hot desert sand, in which they construct burrows, throwing up at intervals small hillocks.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Porcupines.—</hi>In the second section, or Hystricoidea, including several families, the skull (fig. 14) is characterized by the heavy</p><p>zygomatic arch, the middle portion of which is formed by the more or less straight and horizontal jugal, and the large infra-orbital canal, traversed by a portion of the masseter muscle. The tibia and fibula are separate, but the scaphoid and lunar are united, and the clavicles arc generally incomplete. There is never more</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
