<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">about two years, when, after continued bad weather, the slopes commenced slipping to such an extent that the line was rendered&nbsp;impassable for some weeks, and parts of the slopes were reduced to&nbsp;an inclination of 4 to 1. The Winchburgh cutting, on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, is 4 miles long and from 25 to 60 feet&nbsp;deep, through solid rock. It is succeeded by an embankment 1^&nbsp;miles long and 60 feet high, followed in immediate succession by&nbsp;a stone viaduct half a mile long and 80 feet high. The Olive&nbsp;Mount cutting of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway is 2 miles&nbsp;long and at some places 100 feet deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Perhaps the most interesting case of embankment and cutting in combination is that of the crossing of Chat Moss, on the Liverpool&nbsp;and Manchester Railway. The moss was 44 miles across, and it&nbsp;varied in depth from 10 to 30 feet. Its general character was such&nbsp;that cattle could not stand on it, and a piece of iron would sink&nbsp;in it. The subsoil was composed principally of clay and sand, and&nbsp;the railway had to be carried over the moss on the level, requiring&nbsp;cutting and embanking for upwards of 4 miles. In forming 277,000&nbsp;cubic yards of embankment 670,000 yards of raw peat were consumed, the difference being occasioned by the squeezing out of the&nbsp;water. Large quantities of embanking were sunk in the moss,&nbsp;and, when the engineer, Stephenson, after a month’s vigorous&nbsp;operations, had made up his estimates, the apparent work done&nbsp;was sometimes less than at the beginning of the month. The&nbsp;railway ultimately was made to float on the bog. Where embankment was required drains about 5 yards apart were cut, and&nbsp;when the moss between them was dry it was used to form the&nbsp;embankment. Where the way was formed on the level drains&nbsp;were cut on each side of the intended line, and were intersected&nbsp;here and there by cross drains, by which the upper part of the&nbsp;moss became dry and firm. On this surface hurdles were placed,&nbsp;4 feet broad and 9 long, covered with heath, upon which the&nbsp;ballast was laid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">*· </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Tunnels</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The relative costs of rock - cuttings and cuttings in clay do not greatly differ; for, not only does the vertical rock-cutting require less excavation than the wide yawning earth-cutting of the same depth, with extended slopes, but, when it is&nbsp;executed, the rock-cutting is not liable to the expensive slips which&nbsp;sometimes overtake the other. For depths exceeding 60 feet it is&nbsp;usually cheaper to tunnel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The tunnel (see fig. 16) under Callander ridge near Falkirk station, on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, is a fair representation of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">tunnels as usually constructed. It is lined with brick 18 inches thick, founded on stone footings of greater breadth, in order to&nbsp;throw the ,load securely upon the subsoil, as shown in the transverse section. The sides and roof of the tunnel are curved from&nbsp;footing to footing, so as effectually to resist the inevitable external&nbsp;pressure of the earth, to a span of 26 feet in width and a height&nbsp;of 22. The sectional view shows also the centering or timber&nbsp;framing employed in the building of the tunnel, which was braced&nbsp;diagonally and transversely to resist the unavoidable inequalities&nbsp;of pressure without alteration of form whilst the arch was in course&nbsp;of construction. Externally the entrances are built of stone, and&nbsp;the flank walls are 3 feet in thickness, with counterforts at intervals. This tunnel is not straight, but is formed on a curve of 1&nbsp;mile radius, and is 830 yards, or nearly half a mile in length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Ivilsby tunnel, on the London and Birmingham Railway, was rendered necessary by the opposition raised to the line passing&nbsp;through Northampton. It is driven 160 feet below the surface&nbsp;and is 2398 yards in length, 30 feet in width, and 30 feet high,&nbsp;constructed with two wide air-shafts 60 feet in diameter, not only&nbsp;to give air and ventilation but to admit light enough to enable the&nbsp;engine-driver in passing through it with a train to see the rails&nbsp;from end to end. The construction of the tunnel was let for the&nbsp;sum of £99,000, but, owing chiefly to the existence of unseen&nbsp;quicksands, the tunnel is stated to have actually cost nearly&nbsp;£300,000, or £125 per lineal yard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Box tunnel, on the Great Western Railway, between Bath and Chippenham, was another difficult and expensive work. It&nbsp;is about 70 feet below the surface, and is 3123 yards in length, or&nbsp;rather more than If miles ; the width is 30 and the height 25 feet.&nbsp;Where bi'icked, the sides are constructed of seven and the arch of&nbsp;six rings of brick, and there is an invert of four rings. There are&nbsp;eleven air-shafts to this tunnel, generally 25 feet in diameter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The tunnel under the Mound at Edinburgh (see fig. 17), on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway, supplies an excellent illustration&nbsp;of tunnels formed with inverts,—&nbsp;that is to say, inverted arches built&nbsp;under the rails. The figure is a&nbsp;transverse section, showing the&nbsp;truly circular arch of the tunnel,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">28 feet in diameter and 20 high above the rails, built of brick 3 feet&nbsp;thick, stiffened with counterforts ex-ternally, and with ribs of masonry&nbsp;internally, founded on a solid bed&nbsp;of mason-work, with an inverted&nbsp;arch to distribute the weight. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Mound was a mass of loose earth and rubbish on a boggy soil, hence the necessity for the invert arch, on which the tunnel may&nbsp;be conceived to float.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Shakespeare tunnel, or, more correctly, double tunnel, driven through the Shakespeare Cliff near Dover, on the South-Eastern&nbsp;Railway, is in fact two narrow tunnels, carrying each one line of&nbsp;rails (see fig. 18), 12 feet wide and 30 in extreme height, through</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the chalk, separated by a solid pier or wall of chalk 10 feet thick. The chalk is of variable quality, and the greater part of the tunnel&nbsp;is lined with brick, strengthened by counterforts at 12 feet intervals,&nbsp;which carry the weight of doubtful beds of chalk. The tunnel is&nbsp;1430 yards, or upwards of three-quarters of a mile in length, rising&nbsp;westward with an inclination of 1 in 264. The tunnel being&nbsp;within a short distance of the face of the cliff, the material excavated&nbsp;was discharged through galleries about 400 feet long, driven in&nbsp;from the face of the cliff, into the sea,—the first operation being to&nbsp;run a bench or roadway along the face of the cliff. There are seven&nbsp;vertical shafts from the surface, averaging 180 feet deep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">There were in 1857 about 70 miles of railway tunnelling in Great Britain, or 1 mile of tunnel for 130 miles of railway. There are&nbsp;now (1885) probably at least 100 miles of tunnelling. The cost&nbsp;of tunnelling has averaged £102 per mile. The longest tunnel&nbsp;is the Woodhead, at the summit of the Manchester, Sheffield, and&nbsp;Lincolnshire Railway, being 3 miles and 60 feet long. The tun-nelling on the Metropolitan Railway is noticed below, p. 239.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Bridges and Viaducts</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—There are very few level crossings on English railways—that is, the crossing of one railway with another,&nbsp;or with a common road, at the same level—the chances of accidents&nbsp;having demanded, in general, the construction of bridges over or&nbsp;under the railway. The general appearance of an ordinary stone&nbsp;or brick bridge is represented by fig. 19, showing in elevation a&nbsp;bridge over or under the railway. The minimum height of a&nbsp;bridge over the railway is ruled by the elevation necessary to clear&nbsp;the top of the chimney of the locomotive. A</span><span class="font0">11</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> excellent method&nbsp;of carrying roads over railways, where the height is limited and&nbsp;the span is moderate, consists in erecting flat-arched cast-iron&nbsp;beams over the railway, and throwing brick arches of small span&nbsp;between the beams upon their lower flanges, to cany the roadway.&nbsp;Thus the vertical depth from the soffit or crown of the main arch&nbsp;to the roadway above may but very little exceed the depth of the&nbsp;beam, which is apparent in the sectional view. This method of&nbsp;construction is, moreover, well adapted for skew-bridges. Cast-iron</span></p>
