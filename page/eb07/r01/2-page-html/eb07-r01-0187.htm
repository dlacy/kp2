<p><span class="font0">the increments of the resistance are greateτ than those due to the squares of the velocities as the velocity approaches&nbsp;a certain limit, which depends upon the depth of the fluid ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">3d,</span><span class="font0"> that immediately after passing this limit, the resistance&nbsp;suffers a sudden diminution, and becomes much less than&nbsp;that due to the square of the velocity, after which it continues&nbsp;to receive increments, of which the ratio is less than that&nbsp;due to the increment of the square of the velocity. As&nbsp;these phenomena appeared inconsistent with the received&nbsp;theories of hydrodynamics, it was important to investigate&nbsp;their causes. The deviation from the law of the squares,&nbsp;at the greater velocities, might be ascribed in part to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> partial emersion of the floating body ; for the resistance being&nbsp;taken in the ratio of the square of the velocity upon that&nbsp;part only of the body which remains immersed, the aggregate resistance will increase less rapidly at the higher velocities, and may even diminish as the velocity is increased.&nbsp;But the principal and most remarkable part of the phenomena, namely, the rapid increase of resistance as the velocity approaches a certain limit, and its sudden diminution&nbsp;when the velocity passed that limit, was found to depend&nbsp;on the generation of waves, which alter the form of the surface of the fluid, and consequently the position of the floating body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When a solid body is dragged along the surface of a fluid, a wave is generated which moves in the direction of the&nbsp;motion of the body, with a velocity nearly uniform. The&nbsp;velocity of the wave is independent of the form or velocity&nbsp;of the moving body, and depends only on the depth of the&nbsp;fluid, being in tact equal to the velocity acquired by a body&nbsp;falling in vacuo through a space equal to half the depth of&nbsp;the fluid, as was demonstrated by Lagrange. The existence&nbsp;and mode of propagation of the wave being established, it&nbsp;is easy to see that the resistance will be greatly modified&nbsp;by the position of the moving body relatively to the wave.&nbsp;A vessel coming behind or following the wave is very differently circumstanced from one drawn in a horizontal position along the level surface of a quiescent fluid. The prow&nbsp;is pressed into the anterior wave, and consequently the bow&nbsp;more deeply immersed ; the keel also assumes an inclined&nbsp;position, whence the vertical section of the immersed part&nbsp;of the body is increased, and on both these accounts a greater&nbsp;body of fluid is displaced. In addition to this, the increased&nbsp;immersion of the bow augments the anterior wave, and the&nbsp;augmented height gives rise to more rapid currents along&nbsp;the sides. Thus all the elements of resistance are increased ;&nbsp;and it is obvious, that the more closely the vessel follows&nbsp;on the wave, the more powerful will be the effect of the&nbsp;retarding forces. Hence there is a very rapid increase of&nbsp;resistance in approximating gradually to the velocity of the&nbsp;wave. But if we suppose the vessel to be lifted up on the&nbsp;top of the wave, all the retarding forces are at once annihilated, the vessel recovers its horizontal position, and,&nbsp;by reason of the curvature of the wave, the immersion of&nbsp;the ends becomes a minimum. When the velocity of the&nbsp;vessel exceeds that of the wave, the displaced fluid is&nbsp;pushed aside by the prow of the vessel, and is accumulated&nbsp;on both sides of it in the form of a continuous wave, which&nbsp;remains to fill up the void when the vessel has passed&nbsp;through, so that the equilibrium of the hydrostatic pressure&nbsp;is very little disturbed, and immediately restored. Hence&nbsp;it is always found, that the commotion of the fluid is much&nbsp;greater when the velocity of the body is less than that of&nbsp;the wave, than in the contrary case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The following experiments will give an idea of the manner in which the resistance is affected by the velocity. The depth of the canal was about five feet and a half, and the&nbsp;velocity of the wave from eleven to twelve feet per second,&nbsp;or about eight miles per hour. The weight of the vessel&nbsp;and load was 10,239 lbs.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0">Thus it appears, that at six miles per hour </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">behind</span><span class="font0"> the wave, the resistance was greater than at nine miles per hour&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">upon</span><span class="font0"> the wave ; and at ten miles and a half per hour it was&nbsp;very little greater than at 5∙9. The breadth of the canal&nbsp;materially affects the resistance. A narrow canal, by preventing the diffusion of the wave, increases its height,&nbsp;whence the resistance is increased when the velocity of the&nbsp;vessel is less than that of the wave ; but when the velocity&nbsp;is greater than that of the wave, the contrary effect takes&nbsp;place. In both cases the narrowness of the canal augments&nbsp;the effect of the wave. The practical importance of these&nbsp;results is obvious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some experiments have also been recently made for the purpose of determining the amount and law of atmospheric&nbsp;resistance on railway-carriages. The experiments were&nbsp;made by starting a train of carriages with a given velocity&nbsp;down an inclined plane, and determining the velocity when&nbsp;the train ceased to be accelerated. The inclination of the&nbsp;plane and the weight of the carriages and load being known,&nbsp;the accelerating force of gravity is easily computed ; and as&nbsp;this is equal, when the velocity becomes uniform, to the&nbsp;aggregate resistance, if we subtract the part due to friction,&nbsp;the part attributable to the resistance of the atmosphere&nbsp;becomes known. The results seemed to show that the atmospheric resistance increases in a considerably more rapid ratio than the squares of the volocity, but, on account&nbsp;of the great uncertainty which at present exists respecting&nbsp;the amount of the friction of carriage-wheels constrained to&nbsp;move on rails, they are not deserving of much confidence.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">(s.)</span></h2>
