<p><span class="font0">condescending suit of clothes ” by which Hazlitt unfairly defines Miss Burney’s Lord Orville. When Richardson delineated Sir Charles Grandison he was at his best, and his&nbsp;experiences and opportunities for inventing such a character&nbsp;were infinitely greater than they had ever been before. And&nbsp;he lost nothing of his gift for portraying the other sex. Harriet&nbsp;Byron, Clementina della Porretta and even Charlotte Gran-dison, are no whit behind Clarissa and her friend Miss Howe.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Charles Grandison,</span><span class="font0"> in fine, is a far better book than </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela, </span><span class="font0">although M. Taine regarded the hero as only fit to be stuffed&nbsp;and put in a museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grandison</span><span class="font0"> was published in 1753, and by this time Richardson was sixty-four. Although the book was welcomed as warmly as its predecessors, he wrote no other novel, contenting himself instead with indexing his works, and compiling&nbsp;an anthology of the “ maxims,” “ cautions ” and “ instructive&nbsp;sentiments ” they contained. To these things, as a professed&nbsp;moralist, he had always attached the greatest importance.&nbsp;He continued to correspond relentlessly with a large circle&nbsp;of worshippers, mostly women, whose counsels and fertilizing&nbsp;sympathy had not a little contributed to the success of his&nbsp;last two books. He was a nervous, highly strung little man,&nbsp;intensely preoccupied with his health and his feelings, hungry&nbsp;for praise when he had once tasted it, and afterwards unable&nbsp;to exist without it; but apart from these things, well meaning,&nbsp;benevolent, honest, industrious and religious. Seven vast&nbsp;folio volumes of his correspondence with his lady friends, and&nbsp;with a few men of the Young and Aaron Hill type, are preserved in the Forster Library at South Kensington. Parts of&nbsp;it only have been printed. There are several good portraits&nbsp;of him by Joseph Highmore, two of which are in the National&nbsp;Portrait Gallery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Richardson is sometimes styled the “ Father of the English Novel,” a title which has also been claimed for Defoe. It&nbsp;would be more accurate to call him the father of the novel of&nbsp;sentimental analysis. As Sir Walter Scott has said, no one&nbsp;before had dived so deeply into the human heart. No one,&nbsp;moreover, had brought to the study of feminine character&nbsp;so much prolonged research, so much patience of observation,&nbsp;so much interested and indulgent apprehension, as this twittering little printer of Salisbury Court. That he did not more&nbsp;materially control the course of fiction in his own country&nbsp;was probably owing to the new direction which was given&nbsp;to that fiction by Fielding and Smollett, whose method, roughly&nbsp;speaking, was synthetic rather than analytic. Still, his influence is to be traced in Sterne and Henry Mackenzie, as&nbsp;well as in Miss Burney and Miss Austen, both of whom, it may&nbsp;be noted, at first adopted the epistolary form. But it was in&nbsp;France, where the sentimental soil was ready for the dressing,&nbsp;that the analytic process was most warmly welcomed. Extravagantly eulogized by the great critic, Diderot, modified with&nbsp;splendid variation by Rousseau, copied (unwillingly) by&nbsp;Voltaire, the vogue of Richardson was so great as to tempt&nbsp;some modern French critics to seek his original in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marianne&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of a contemporary analyst, Marivaux. As a matter of fact,&nbsp;though there is some unconscious consonance of manner,&nbsp;there is nothing whatever to show that the little-lettered&nbsp;author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela,</span><span class="font0"> who was also ignorant of French, had the&nbsp;slightest knowledge of Marivaux or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marianne.</span><span class="font0"> In Germany&nbsp;Richardson was even more popular than in France. Geliert,&nbsp;the fabulist, translated him; Wieland, Lessing, Hermes,&nbsp;all imitated him, and Coleridge detects him even in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Robbers&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Schiller. What was stranger still, he returned to England&nbsp;again under another form. Having given a fillip to the French&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comédie larmoyante,</span><span class="font0"> that comedy crossed the channel as the&nbsp;sentimental comedy of Cumberland - and Kelly, which, after&nbsp;a brief career of prosperity, received its death-blow at the hands&nbsp;of Goldsmith and Sheridan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A selection from Richardson’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Correspondence</span><span class="font0"> was published by Mrs A. L. Barbauld in 1804, in six volumes, with a valuable Memoir.&nbsp;Recent lives are by Miss Clara L. Thomson, 1900, and by Austin&nbsp;Dobson (&quot; Men of Letters ”), 1902. A convenient reprint of the&nbsp;novels, with copies of the old illustrations by Stothard, Edward</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Burney and the rest, and an introduction by Mrs E. M. M. McKenna, was issued in 1901 in 20 volumes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A. D.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHELIEU, ARMAND EMMANUEL OPHIE SEPTE-MANIE DU PLESSIS, Duc de (1766-1822), French statesman, was born in Paris on the 25th of September 1766, the son of&nbsp;Louis Antoine du Plessis, duc de Fronsac and grandson of the&nbsp;marshal de Richelieu (1696-1788). The comtede Chinon, as&nbsp;the heir to the Richelieu honours was called, was married at&nbsp;fifteen to Rosalie de Rochechouart, a deformed child of twelve,&nbsp;with whom his relations were never more than formal. After&nbsp;two years of foreign travel he entered the Queen’s dragoons&nbsp;and next year received a place at court, where he had a reputation for Puritan austerity. He left Paris in 1790 for Vienna,&nbsp;and in company with his friend Prince Charles de Ligne joined&nbsp;the Russian army as a volunteer, reaching the Russian headquarters at Bender on the 21st of November. He was present&nbsp;at the capture of Ismailia and received from the empress Catherine&nbsp;the cross of St George and a golden sword. By the death of his&nbsp;father inFebruary 1791, he succeeded to the title of duc de&nbsp;Richelieu. He returned to Paris shortly afterwards on the&nbsp;summons of Louis XVI., but he was not sufficiently in the&nbsp;confidence of the court to be informed of the projected flight&nbsp;to Varennes. In July he obtained a passport from the NationaI&nbsp;Assembly for service in Russia. In the Russian army he&nbsp;obtained the grade of general-major, only to be forced by the&nbsp;intrigues of his enemies to resign. The accession of Alexander I.&nbsp;brightened his prospects. His erasure from the list of émigrés,&nbsp;which he had failed to secure from Napoleon, was accorded on&nbsp;the request of the Russian government, and in 1803 he became&nbsp;governor of Odessa. Two years later he became governor&nbsp;general of the Chersonese, of EkaterinosIav and the Crimea,&nbsp;then called New Russia. In the eleven years of his administration, Odessa rose from a miserable village to an important city.&nbsp;He commanded a division in the Turkish War of 1806-7, and&nbsp;was engaged in frequent expeditions to the Caucasus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Richelieu returned to France in 1814 on the triumphant return of Napoleon from Elba he accompanied Louis XVIII&nbsp;in his flight as far as Lille, whence he went to Vienna to join&nbsp;the Russian army, believing that he could best serve the&nbsp;interests of the monarchy and of France by attaching himself&nbsp;to the headquarters of the emperor Alexander. Richelieu’s,&nbsp;character and antecedents alike marked him out as valuable&nbsp;support of the monarchy after its second restoration. Though&nbsp;the bulk of his confiscated estates were lost beyond recall, he&nbsp;did not share the resentment of the mass of the returned&nbsp;from whom and their intrigues he had held aloof during his&nbsp;exile, and was far from sharing their delusions as to the possibility&nbsp;of undoing the work of the Revolution. As the personal friend&nbsp;of the Russian emperor his influence in the councils of the Allies,&nbsp;was lively to be of great service. He refused, indeed, Talleyrand’s offer of a place in his ministry, pleading his long absence&nbsp;from France ignorance of its conditions; but after Talleyrand’s retirement he consented to follow him as prime minister,&nbsp;though—as he himself said—he did not know the face of one of&nbsp;his colleagues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The events of Richelieu’s tenure of office are noticed elsewhere (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">France: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span><span class="font0"> Here it need only be said that it was&nbsp;mainly due to his efforts that France was so early relieved of&nbsp;the burden of the allied army of occupation. It was for this&nbsp;purpose mainly that he attended the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle&nbsp;in 1818. There he had been informed in confidence of the&nbsp;renewal by the Allies of their treaty binding them to interfere&nbsp;in case of a renewal of revolutionary trouble in France; and it&nbsp;was partly owing to this knowledge that he resigned office in&nbsp;December of the same year, on the refusal of his colleagues to&nbsp;support a reactionary modification of the electoral law. After&nbsp;the murder of the duc de Berry and the enforced retirement of&nbsp;Decazes, he again became president of the council (21st February&nbsp;1821); but his position was untenable owing to the attacks of&nbsp;the “ Ultras ” on the one side and the Liberals on the other,&nbsp;and on the 12th of December he again resigned. He died of&nbsp;apoplexy on the 17th of May 1822.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
