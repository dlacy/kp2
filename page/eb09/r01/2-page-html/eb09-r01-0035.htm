<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the track. The leading objection to this system was that the rail was liable to be covered with dust. Jessop&nbsp;therefore in 1789 laid down at Loughborough cast-iron&nbsp;“ edge rails,” raised above the ground&nbsp;so as to allow a flanged cast-iron wheel&nbsp;to run on them (fig. 2). This appears&nbsp;to have been the first system of rails&nbsp;laid on cast-iron chairs and on sleepers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The rails were pinned or bolted into the chairs. A wrought-iron rail was&nbsp;patented by Birkenshaw in 1820, as&nbsp;the “fish-belly” rail, similar in form&nbsp;and mode of support to Jessop’s rail,&nbsp;but rolled in continuous lengths,&nbsp;embracing a number of spans, with&nbsp;stiffening ledges or flanges on the </span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">under side. This form of rail grew into favour. It weighed 33 lb per yard, and was laid in cast-iron chairs,&nbsp;spiked down to square stone blocks at 3-feet bearings (see&nbsp;fig. 3). The&nbsp;edge rail and&nbsp;the flanged&nbsp;wheel constitute the basis&nbsp;of the whole&nbsp;system of a&nbsp;railway. The&nbsp;rails forming a&nbsp;line of way&nbsp;were placed to&nbsp;a gauge or distance apart of 4&nbsp;feet inches,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and two parallel lines of way were spaced with 6 feet between the inner rails of the ways. This interspace is&nbsp;popularly known as the “ six-foot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The benefits derived from the use of the tramway or railway for the transport of coal suggested to reflective&nbsp;persons the employment of it for the conveyance of general&nbsp;merchandise and of passengers. For the conveyance of&nbsp;heavy merchandise inland the canals little more than sixty&nbsp;years ago furnished the principal means. Though there&nbsp;were three such water-routes between Liverpool and Manchester, they were sometimes so crowded that cotton took&nbsp;a month to pass from the seaport to the manufacturing&nbsp;towns in the interior; yet the whole of the merchandise&nbsp;passing between Liverpool and Manchester did not average&nbsp;more than 1200 tons a day. The average rate of carriage was&nbsp;18s. per ton, and the average time of transit on the 50 miles&nbsp;of canal was thirty-six hours. The conveyance of passengers&nbsp;by the improved coach-roads was comparatively rapid, but&nbsp;it was very costly. The first great movement to mend this&nbsp;state of things was the passing of the Act in 1821 for&nbsp;the construction of the Stockton and Darlington Railway.&nbsp;Colliery railways were in evidence to prove the benefits&nbsp;of railway communication by steam-power. The Hetton&nbsp;Railway, for instance, in the neighbourhood of Newcastle,&nbsp;from the colliery to the river Wear, was 7 miles long, and&nbsp;trains of 60 tons net weight were taken over the line at&nbsp;a speed of 44 miles per hour. On the Killingworth Railway an engine and tender weighing 10 tons drew a load&nbsp;of 40 tons at a speed of 6 miles per hour, consuming 50 fl&gt;&nbsp;of coal per mile run. Whilst animal-power only was at&nbsp;first relied on for working the Stockton and Darlington</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Railway, the Act provided for working with men and horses or “ otherwise.” By another Act applied for at the&nbsp;request of George Stephenson, who became engineer to the&nbsp;line, the company was empowered to work the railway with&nbsp;locomotive engines. The line, with three branches, was&nbsp;over 38 miles in length, and was at first laid as a single&nbsp;line, with passing places at intervals of a quarter of a&nbsp;mile, the way being constructed with wrought-iron fish&nbsp;belly rails, weighing 28 ft&gt; per yard. It was opened in&nbsp;September 1825 by a train of thirty-four vehicles, making&nbsp;a gross load of about 90 tons, drawn by one engine driven&nbsp;by Stephenson, with a signalman on horseback in advance.&nbsp;The train moved off at the rate of from 10 to 12 miles an&nbsp;hour, and attained a speed of 15 miles per hour on favourable parts of the line. A train weighing 92 tons could be&nbsp;drawn by one engine at the rate of 5 miles per hour. The&nbsp;principal business of the new railway was the conveyance&nbsp;of minerals and goods, but from the first passengers insisted upon being carried, and in October 1825 the company began to run a daily coach, called the “ Experiment,”&nbsp;to carry six inside, and from fifteen to twenty outside,&nbsp;making the journey from Darlington to Stockton and back&nbsp;in two hours. The fare was Is., and each passenger was&nbsp;allowed to take baggage not exceeding 14 Bb weight. The&nbsp;rate for carriage of merchandise was reduced from 5d. to&nbsp;one-fifth of a penny per ton per mile, and that of minerals&nbsp;from 7d. to Hd. per ton per mile. The price of coals at&nbsp;Darlington fell from 18s. to 8s. 6d. per ton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The Monklands Railway in Scotland, opened in 1826, was the first to follow the example of the Stockton and&nbsp;Darlington line, and several other small lines—including&nbsp;the Canterbury and Whitstable, worked partly by fixed&nbsp;engines and partly by locomotives—quickly adopted steam-traction. But the inauguration of the Liverpool and&nbsp;Manchester Railway, opened in 1829, made the first&nbsp;great impression on the national mind that a revolution&nbsp;in the modes of travelling had really taken place. In&nbsp;1838 a line was opened between London and Birmingham,&nbsp;and the first train accomplished the whole distance—112^&nbsp;miles—at an average speed of over 20 miles per hour.&nbsp;The London and Greenwich, the London and Southampton, the Great Western, Birmingham and Derby, Bristol&nbsp;and Exeter, Eastern Counties, Manchester and Leeds,&nbsp;Grand Junction, Midland Counties, North Midland, South-Eastern, London and Brighton, Manchester and Birmingham, and Edinburgh and Glasgow, together with many&nbsp;small Bills, were all passed within four years from the&nbsp;time of the passing of the London and Birmingham Bill.&nbsp;Thus in the course of four or five years the foundations&nbsp;were laid of most of the existing trunk lines of railway&nbsp;in Great Britain. The original Liverpool and Manchester&nbsp;line, 3(4 miles in length, now forms part of a network of&nbsp;lines, the property of one company, nearly 1800 miles in&nbsp;extent, representing a capital invested in railway works&nbsp;and plant of &lt;£100,000,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Meantime the construction of the way was the subject of much consideration. The fish-belly form of wrought-iron rail was troublesome to roll, and so the flat-bottom&nbsp;or flat-foot rail (fig. 4) was designed,&nbsp;combining a solid head with a flange&nbsp;base. This rail, with holes through the ·&nbsp;flange to hold the spikes, was used to&nbsp;some extent, and was laid on longitudinal timber sleepers, and also on&nbsp;transverse sleepers. The disadvantage&nbsp;was want of vertical stiffness of the system; and, if the rail&nbsp;was made higher, it was liable to rock on the sleeper and&nbsp;work loose on the spikes. This rail, known as the Yignoles&nbsp;rail, has been much improved in form and proportions&nbsp;and is extensively used. The bridge rail (fig. 5)—so called</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
