a charm conſisting of ſome words of occult power, generally attended with ſome ceremony.— In order to explain it, we will produce a few examples. On St Agnes’s night, 21st of January, take a row of pins, and pull out every one, one after another, ſaying a Pater-noſter on flicking a pin in your ſleeve, and you will dream of him or her you ſhall marry.</p><p>Another method to ſee a future ſpouſe in a dream. The party inquiring maſt lie in a different county from that in which he commonly resides, and on going to bed must knit the left garter about the right-legged flocking, letting the other garter and flocking alone ; and as he rehearſes the following verſes, at every comma knit a knot :</p><p>This knot I knit,</p><p>To know the thing I know not yet ;</p><p>That I may see</p><p>The man (woman) that ſhall my husband (wife) be ;</p><p>How he goes, and what he wears,</p><p>And what he does all days and years.</p><p>Accordingly, in a dream, he will appear with the insignia of his trade or profeſſion.</p><p>Another, performed by charming the moon, thus ; At the first appearance of the new moon, immediately after the new year’s day, (though ſome ſay any other new moon is as good), go out in the evening, and stand over the ſpars of a gate or stile, and, looking on the moon, repeat the following lines :</p><p>All hail to the moon ! all hail to thee !</p><p>I prithee, good moon, reveal to me</p><p>This night who my husband (wife) must be.</p><p>Immediately after you must go to bed, when you will dream of the perſon deſtined for your future husband or wife.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
