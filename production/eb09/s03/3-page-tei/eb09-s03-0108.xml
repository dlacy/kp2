A few weeks after they may be observed dropping down the river, lean and thoroughly exhausted, numbers floating dead on the surface, so that only a small proportion seem to regain the sea. Although millions of ova must be deposited by them in the upper reaches of a river, the fry does not seem to have been actually observed in fresh water, so that it seems probable that the young fish travel to the sea long before they have attained to any size.</p><p>On rivers in which these fishes make their periodical appearance they have become the object of a regular fishery, and their value increases in proportion to the distance from the sea at which they are caught. Thus they are much esteemed on the middle Rhine, where they are generally known as “Maifisch”; those caught on their return journey are worthless and uneatable. The allis shad is caught at a size from 15 to 24 inches, and is considered to be better flavoured than the twaite shad, which generally remains within smaller dimensions.</p><p>Other, but closely allied species, occur on the Atlantic coasts of North America, all surpassing the European species in importance as food-fishes and economic value, viz., the American Shad <hi rend="italic">(Clupea sapidissima),</hi> the Gaspereau or Ale-wife <hi rend="italic">(C. mattowocca),</hi> and the Menhaden <hi rend="italic">(C. menhaden).</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Menhaden.</hi></p><p>SHADDOCK <hi rend="italic">(Citrus decumana)</hi> is a tree allied to the orange and the lemon, presumably native to the Malay and Polynesian islands, but generally cultivated throughout the tropics. The leaves are like those of the orange, but downy on the under surface, as are also the young shoots. The flowers are large and white, and are succeeded by very large globose or pear-shaped fruits like oranges, but paler in colour, and with less flavour. The name Shaddock is asserted to be that of a captain who introduced the tree to the West Indies. The fruit is also known under the name of pommeloes and “forbidden fruit.” There are two varieties commonly met with, one with pale and the other with red pulp.</p><p>SHADWELL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi> (1640-1692), a playwright and miscellaneous versifier of the Restoration period, Dryden’s successor in the laureateship, is remembered now, not by his works, though he was a prolific writer of comedies highly successful in their day, but as the subject of Dryden’s satirical portraits “MacFlecknoe” and “Og.” He was a native of Norfolk—not an Irishman, as he retorted with significant imbecility when Dryden’s satire appeared,—went through the forms of study at Cambridge and the Inner Temple, travelled abroad for a little, returned to London, cultivated the literary society of coffee-houses and taverns, and in 1668, at the age of 28, gained the ear of the stage with a comedy <hi rend="italic">The Sullen Lovers.</hi> For fourteen years afterwards, till his memorable encounter with Dryden he continued regularly to produce a comedy nearly every year, showing considerable cleverness in caricaturing the oddities of the time. Ben Jonson was his model, but he drew his materials largely from contemporary hfe. He also acquired standing among the wits as a talker. In the quarrel with Dryden he was the aggressor. They had been good enough friends, and Dryden in 1679 had furnished him with a prologue for his <hi rend="italic">True Widow.</hi> But when Dryden threw in his lot with the court, and satirized the opposition in <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Achitophel</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Medal,</hi> Shadwell was rash enough to constitute himself the champion of the true-blue Protestants and wrote a grossly personal and scurrilous attack on the poet, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Medal of John Bayes.</hi> Dryden immediately retorted in <hi rend="italic">MacFlecknoe,</hi> the most powerful and contemptuously scornful personal satire in our language, adding next month a few more rough touches of supercilious mockery in the second part of <hi rend="italic">Absalom and Achitophel,</hi> where Shadwell figures as "Og”:—</p><p>Og from a treason-tavern rolling home,</p><p>Round as a globe, and liquored every chink ;</p><p>Goodly and great he sails behind his link.</p><p>Dryden may not be strictly fair when he addresses his enemy as “thou last great prophet of tautology,” and makes Flecknoe extol him because “he never deviates into sense,” but Shadwell had fairly earned his chastisement, the sting of which lay in its substantial truth. He survived till 1692, and on Dryden’s resignation of the laureateship in 1688 was promoted to the office, a sign of the poverty of the Whig side at the time in literary men, and part of the explanation of their anxiety in the next generation to secure literary talent.</p><p>A complete edition of Shadwell’s works was published in 1720, in 4 vols. 12mo. His dramatic works are—<hi rend="italic">The Sullen Lovers, </hi>1668 ; <hi rend="italic">The Royal Shepherdess,</hi> 1669 ; <hi rend="italic">The Humorist,</hi> 1671 ; <hi rend="italic">The Miser,</hi> 1672 ; <hi rend="italic">Epsom Wells,</hi> 1673 ; <hi rend="italic">Psyche,</hi> 1675 ; <hi rend="italic">The Libertine, </hi>1676 ; <hi rend="italic">The Virtuoso,</hi> 1676 ; <hi rend="italic">Timon of Athens,</hi> 1678 ; <hi rend="italic">A True Widow,</hi> 1679 ; <hi rend="italic">The Woman Captain,</hi> 1680 ; <hi rend="italic">The Lancashire Witches,</hi> 1682; <hi rend="italic">The Squire of Alsatia,</hi> 1688 ; <hi rend="italic">Bury Fair,</hi> 1689 ; <hi rend="italic">The Amorous Bigot,</hi> 1690 ; <hi rend="italic">The Scowerers,</hi> 1691 ; and <hi rend="italic">The Volunteers,</hi> 1693.</p><p>SHAF'I, SHAF'ÍTES. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Sunnites.</hi></p><p>SHAFTESBURY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthony Ashley Cooper, First Earl of</hi> (1621-1683), was the son of Sir John Cooper of Rockbourne in Hampshire, and of Anne, the only child of Sir Anthony Ashley, Bart., and was born at Wimborne St Giles, Dorset, on July 22, 1621. His parents died before he was ten years of age, and he inherited extensive estates in Hampshire, Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and Somersetshire, much reduced, however, by litigation in Chancery. He lived for some time with Sir Daniel Norton, one of his trustees, at Southwick, and upon his death in 1635 with Mr Tooker, an uncle by marriage, at Salisbury. In 1637 he went as a gentleman-commoner to Exeter College, Oxford, where he remained about a year. No record of his studies is to be found, but he has left an amusing account of his part in the wilder doings of the university life of that day, in which, in spite of his small stature, he was recognized by his fellows as their leader. At the age of eighteen, on February 25, 1639, he married Margaret, daughter of Lord Coventry, with whom he and his wife lived at Durham House in the Strand, and at Canonbury House in Islington. In March 1640, though still a minor, he was elected for Tewkesbury, and sat in the parliament which met on April 13, but appears to have taken no active part in its proceedings. In 1640 Lord Coventry died, and Cooper then lived with his brother-in-law at Dorchester House in Covent Garden. For the Long Parliament, which met on November 3, 1640, he was elected for Downton in Wiltshire, but the return was disputed, and he did not take his seat,—his election not being declared valid until the last days of the Rump. He was present as a spectator at the setting up of the king’s standard at Nottingham on August 25, 1642; and in 1643 he appeared openly on Charles’s side in Dorsetshire, where he raised at his own expense a regiment of foot and a troop of horse of both of which he took the command. He was also appointed governor of Weymouth, sheriff of Dorsetshire for the king, and president of the king’s council of war in the county. In the beginning of January 1644, however, for reasons which are variously reported by himself and Clarendon, he resigned his governorship and commissions and went over to the Parliament. He appeared on March 6 before the standing committee of the two Houses to explain his conduct, when he stated that he had come over because he saw danger to the Protestant religion in the king’s service, and expressed his willingness to take the Covenant. In July 1644 he went to Dorsetshire on military service, and on August 3 received a commission as field-marshal general. He assisted at the taking of Wareham, and shortly afterwards compounded for his estates by a fine of £500 from</p></body></text></TEI>
