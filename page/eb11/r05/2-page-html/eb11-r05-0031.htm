<p><span class="font1">Berlin, and carried out a well-known research on the effect of an electrically charged body in motion, showing it to give rise&nbsp;to a magnetic field. As soon as he was settled at Baltimore,&nbsp;two important pieces of work engaged his attention. One&nbsp;was a redetermination of the ohm. For this he obtained a&nbsp;value which was substantially different from that ascertained&nbsp;by the committee of the British Association appointed for the&nbsp;purpose, but ultimately he had the satisfaction of seeing his&nbsp;own result accepted as the more correct of the two. The other&nbsp;was a new determination of the mechanical equivalent of&nbsp;heat. In this he used Joule’s paddle-wheel method, though&nbsp;with many improvements, the whole apparatus being on a&nbsp;larger scale and the experiments being conducted over a wider&nbsp;range of temperature. He obtained a result distinctly higher&nbsp;than Joule’s final figure; and in addition he made many valuable observations on thermometrical questions and on the&nbsp;variation of the specific heat of water, which J. P. Joule had&nbsp;assumed to be the same at all temperatures. In 1882, before&nbsp;the Physical Society of London, he gave a description of the&nbsp;diffraction gratings with which his name is specially associated,&nbsp;and which have been of enormous advantage to astronomical&nbsp;spectroscopy. These gratings consist of pieces of metal or&nbsp;glass ruled by means of a diamond point with a very large&nbsp;number of parallel lines, on the extreme accuracy of which&nbsp;their efficiency depends. For their production, therefore,&nbsp;dividing engines of extraordinary trueness and delicacy must&nbsp;be employed, and in the construction of such machines Rowland’s engineering skill brought him conspicuous success. The&nbsp;results of his labours may be found in the elaborate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Photographic Map of the Normal Solar Spectrum</span><span class="font1"> (1888) and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Table&nbsp;of Solar Wave-Lengths</span><span class="font1"> (1898). In the later years of his life he&nbsp;was engaged in developing a system of multiplex telegraphy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROWLANDS, RICHARD (fl. 1560-1620), Anglo-Dutch antiquary, whose real name was Verstegen, was the son of a&nbsp;cooper whose father, Theodore Roland Verstegen, a Dutch&nbsp;emigrant, came to England about 1500. Under the name&nbsp;of Rowlands, Richard went to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1565,&nbsp;where he studied early English history and the Anglo-Saxon&nbsp;language. Leaving the university without a degree, he published in 1576 a work of antiquarian research, translated from&nbsp;the German, entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Post of the World,</span><span class="font1"> describing the great&nbsp;cities of Europe; and soon afterwards he moved to Antwerp,&nbsp;where he resumed the name of Verstegen, and set up in business&nbsp;as a printer and engraver. In 1587 he went to Paris, and in&nbsp;1595 to Spain, where he studied in the college at Seville, afterwards returning to Antwerp, where he lived so far as is known&nbsp;until his death, the date of which, though certainly later than&nbsp;1620, is unknown. Rowlands was a zealous Roman Catholic,&nbsp;and in 1587 he published at Antwerp </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theatrum Crudelitatum&nbsp;haereticorum,</span><span class="font1"> in which he criticized the treatment of the Roman&nbsp;Catholics in England under Elizabeth so freely that when a&nbsp;French translation of the book appeared in the following year&nbsp;he was thrown into prison at the instance of the English ambassador in Paris. Many of his writings were published in the&nbsp;name of Verstegen. His works included </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Dialogue on Dying&nbsp;Well</span><span class="font1"> (1603), a translation from the Italian; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Restitution of&nbsp;Decayed Intelligence in Antiquities concerning the English&nbsp;Nation,</span><span class="font1"> dedicated to James I. (1605); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Neder Dvytsche&nbsp;Epigrammen</span><span class="font1"> (1617); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sundry Successive Regal Governments&nbsp;in England</span><span class="font1"> (1620); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spiegel der Nederlandsche Elenden</span><span class="font1"> (1621).&nbsp;The verses on the defeat of the Irish rebels under Tyrone,&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">England’s Joy,</span><span class="font1"> by R. R. (1601), is doubtfully attributed to him. Richard Verstegan, author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nederlantische&nbsp;Antiquiteyten</span><span class="font1"> (Brussels, 1646), is probably another person,&nbsp;possibly Rowlands’s son.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROWLANDS, SAMUEL </span><span class="font1">(c. 1573-1630), English author of pamphlets in prose and verse, which reflect the follies and humours of the lower middle-class life of his time, seems to have had no&nbsp;contemporary literary reputation; but his work throws considerable light on the social London of his day.

Mr Gosse, in his introduction to Rowlands’s&nbsp;complete works, edited (1872-80) for the Hunterian Club in&nbsp;Glasgow by Air S. J. H. Herrtage, sums him up as a “ kind of&nbsp;small non-political Defoe, a pamphleteer in verse whose talents&nbsp;were never put into exercise except when their possessor was&nbsp;pressed for means, and a poet of considerable talent without&nbsp;one spark or glimmer of genius.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROWLANDSON, THOMAS (1756-1827), English caricaturist, was born in Old Jewry, London, in July 1756, the son of a&nbsp;tradesman or city merchant. On leaving school he became&nbsp;a student in the Royal Academy. At the age of sixteen he&nbsp;resided and studied for a time in Paris, and he afterwards made&nbsp;frequent tours on the Continent, enriching his portfolios with&nbsp;numerous jottings of life and character. In 1775 he exhibited&nbsp;at the Royal Academy a drawing of “ Delilah visiting Samson in&nbsp;Prison,” and in the following years he was represented by various •&nbsp;portraits and landscapes. Possessed of much facility of execution and a ready command of the figure, he was spoken of&nbsp;as a promising student; and had he continued his early application he would have made his mark as a painter. But by the&nbsp;death of his aunt, a French lady, he fell heir to a sum of £7000,&nbsp;plunged into the dissipations of the town and was known to&nbsp;sit at the gaming-table for thirty-six hours at a stretch. In&nbsp;time poverty overtook him; and the friendship and example&nbsp;of Gillray and Bunbury seem to have suggested caricature as&nbsp;a means of filling an empty purse. His drawing of Vauxhall,&nbsp;shown in the Royal Academy exhibition of 1784, had been&nbsp;engraved by Pollard, and the print was a success. Rowlandson&nbsp;was largely employed by Rudolph Ackermann, the art publisher,&nbsp;who in 1809-1 r issued in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Poetical Magazine</span><span class="font1"> “The&nbsp;Schoolmaster’s Tour ”—a series of plates with illustrative&nbsp;verses by Dr William Coombe. They were the most popular&nbsp;of the artist’s works.
