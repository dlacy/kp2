<p><span class="font2">united a species of greater council. Therefore the transition from a senate divided into two parts to the&nbsp;greater and lesser councils must have been very easy and&nbsp;natural. And, seeing that later, when the nomination of a&nbsp;single senator had become a constant practice, the meetings of the two councils are frequently mentioned without&nbsp;the slightest remark or hint as to their origin, it is clear&nbsp;that they had been gradually formed and long established.&nbsp;Not long after the revolution of 1143 the grandees&nbsp;sought to re-enter the senate; and the popes themselves,&nbsp;partly from dread of the people and partly to aggrandize&nbsp;their own kindred, contributed to build up the power of a&nbsp;new and no less turbulent nobility. This class, arising&nbsp;between the 12th and 13th centuries, was composed of&nbsp;families newly created by the popes, together with remnants&nbsp;of the oldaristocracy, such as the Frangipani, Colonna, </span><span class="font0">&lt;fec.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">These nobles, regaining possession of the senate, so completely eliminated the popular element that, when the&nbsp;popes again opposed them, and, obtaining from the parliament the right of electing the senators, adopted the&nbsp;expedient of appointing one only, the senator was always&nbsp;chosen from the ranks of the nobles. And then the&nbsp;people, unable and unwilling to renounce republican forms,&nbsp;replaced their suppressed senate by a greater and a lesser&nbsp;council. This was an easy task—a natural consequence&nbsp;of the fact that the people now began to constitute the&nbsp;real strength of the republic. Later, with an increasing&nbsp;detestation for their nobility, the Romans decreed that the&nbsp;single senator should be of foreign birth, and, as we shall&nbsp;see, chose Brancaleone in the middle of the 13th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus, after a long series of frequent changes and revolutions, the Roman republic became a commonwealth, with an increasing resemblance to those of the other Italian&nbsp;cities. The people were organized and armed, the guilds&nbsp;almost established, the two councils gradually constituted,&nbsp;and the aristocracy, while retaining special local characteristics, assumed its definitive shape. It is not surprising&nbsp;to find that Rome, like other Italian cities, now possessed&nbsp;statutes of its own. There has been much controversy on&nbsp;this point. Certain writers had alluded to a statute of 1246.&nbsp;As no one, however, could discover any statute of that date,&nbsp;others decided that it had never existed. A statute of 1363&nbsp;was TecentlypublishedbyProfessor Camillo Re, who asserted&nbsp;it to be the first and most ancient that Rome had possessed.&nbsp;But the still more recent researches of Messrs La Mantia&nbsp;and Levi prove that Professor Re’s assertions were somewhat too bold. There is certain evidence of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">statutum&nbsp;senatus</span><span class="font2"> existing between 1212 and 1227, of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">statutum&nbsp;vel Capitulare Senatoris vel senatus</span><span class="font2"> of 1235, followed in&nbsp;1241 by a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">statutum urbis.</span><span class="font2"> This brings us very near to&nbsp;the statute of 1246 mentioned by Vitale and others. So it&nbsp;is well ascertained that, in the first half of the l3th century,&nbsp;Rome possessed statutes at large composed of older&nbsp;limited statutes. The consuls of the trade guilds were&nbsp;from 1267 regular members of the councils; and the&nbsp;merchants’ guild held general meetings in 1255. Its&nbsp;statutes were confirmed in 1296 by the senator Pandolfo&nbsp;Savelli, and the compilation of these, published in 1880&nbsp;by Signor Gatti, refers to 1317.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meanwhile the struggle between Frederick IT. and the pope was once more renewed. The former sought to dominate Italy, separate the state from the church, and repress&nbsp;the republics. The latter, although really hostile to the&nbsp;Roman free Government, joined it against the emperor,&nbsp;who on his side favoured the republic of Rome and the&nbsp;nobles most adverse to the pope. Thus the new nobility,&nbsp;composed, as we have seen, of two different elements, was&nbsp;again split into a Guelf party headed by the Orsini and&nbsp;a Ghibelline party under the Colonna. And in 1238 it&nbsp;was deemed advisable to elect two senators instead of one,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">in the hope of conciliating both factions by simultaneously raising them to power. Afterwards one only was elected,&nbsp;alternately an Orsini and a Colonna, then again two,&nbsp;and so on. But all these changes failed in their aims,&nbsp;since the struggle between emperor and pope exasperated&nbsp;party feeling in Rome. The political genius of Frederick&nbsp;might have wrought great harm to the city had not his&nbsp;mind teemed with contradictory ideas. Although desirous&nbsp;to emancipate the state from the church, he was opposed&nbsp;to the communal democracy, which was then the chief&nbsp;strength of the secular state in Italy. AVhile combating the&nbsp;church and persecuting her defenders, he yet sent heretics&nbsp;to the stake ; although excommunicated, he undertook a&nbsp;crusade ; he feasted at his table philosophers, sceptic and&nbsp;atheist poets, bishops, and Alussulmans ; he proclaimed&nbsp;anti-Christian the possession of wealth by the church, yet&nbsp;made lavish gifts to altar and monastery. Thus, although&nbsp;he had a strong party in Rome, it seemed to dissolve at his&nbsp;approach, inasmuch as all feared that he might abolish&nbsp;the statutes and liberties of the commune. It fact, when&nbsp;he advanced towards Rome on the death of Gregory IX.&nbsp;in 1241 he was energetically repulsed by the people, and&nbsp;later even by Viterbo, a city that had always been faithful to him. But after he had withdrawn his adherents&nbsp;gained strength and put to flight his opponent, Innocent</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">IV. (1243-54), the newly elected pope, who then&nbsp;from his asylum in France hurled an excommunication&nbsp;against him. Frederick’s death in December 1250 determined the fall of the Ghibelline party and the close of the&nbsp;imperial epoch in Italy. The pope instantly returned to&nbsp;Rome with the set purpose of destroying the power of the&nbsp;Hohenstaufens. This was no longer difficult when, by the&nbsp;decease of Conrad IV. (1254), the child Conradin became&nbsp;the last legitimate representative of that line, and negotiations were already on foot for placing the Angevins on the&nbsp;Neapolitan throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The republic meanwhile preserved its independence against the pope, who, among other concessions, had&nbsp;entirely given up to it the right of coinage. Nevertheless, being much harassed by the factiousness of the&nbsp;nobility, it was obliged in 1252 to decide on the election&nbsp;of an alien senator armed with ample powers, precisely as&nbsp;other communes gave the government into the hands of a&nbsp;podestà. Accordingly a Bolognese noble, Brancaleone degli&nbsp;Andal5, count of Casalecchio, and a Ghibelline of much <sup>i&nbsp;</sup>energy and talent, was invited to Rome. But before J&nbsp;accepting office he insisted on making definite terms. He </span><span class="font1">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;desired to hold the government for three years ; and this, 1&nbsp;although contrary to the statutes, was granted. Further, to <sup>i&nbsp;</sup>ensure his personal safety, he demanded that many scions&nbsp;of the noblest Roman houses should be sent as hostages to&nbsp;Bologna ; and to this also the republic consented. Then,&nbsp;in August 1252, he came with his judges and notaries,&nbsp;made oath to observe justice and the laws, and began to&nbsp;govern. He was head of the republic in peace and in war,&nbsp;supreme judge and captain in chief. He nominated the&nbsp;podestàs of subject territories, despatched ambassadors,&nbsp;issued coin, concluded treaties, and received oaths of&nbsp;obedience. The pope, who was then at Perugia, was&nbsp;greatly afflicted by the arrival of this new master, but,&nbsp;despairing of aid from any quarter, was forced to make a&nbsp;virtue of necessity. Thus Brancaleone was able to seize&nbsp;the reins of power with a firm grasp. The parliament&nbsp;still met in the square of the Capitol, and the greater&nbsp;and lesser councils in the church of Ara Coeli. There were&nbsp;besides frequent assemblies of the college of Capitoline&nbsp;judges or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">assectamentum.</span><span class="font2"> Unfortunately, no records having&nbsp;been preserved of the proceedings of the Roman councils&nbsp;and parliament, little can be said of the manner in which&nbsp;affairs were conducted. Certainly Brancaleone’s govern-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
