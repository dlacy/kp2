<p><span class="font1">The fame of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pamela</span><span class="font1"> made him a great personal favourite, especially with women, of λvhose hearts and fancies he had&nbsp;shown a knowledge so intimate. Several ladies of quality&nbsp;made a pet of him, deluged him with questions and confidences, and urged him to write more. Under this flattering encouragement, the sedate author, still keeping his&nbsp;head and following his own plans amidst a multitude of&nbsp;counsellors, produced </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa Harlowe</span><span class="font1"> (1749), a model of&nbsp;every virtue in higher life, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Charles Grandison&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1753), his ideal of a perfect gentleman. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Clarissa</span><span class="font1"> is&nbsp;universally acknowledged to be his masterpiece. Au anecdote was given by Macaulay which shows how entrancing&nbsp;the story may become to readers once fairly caught by the&nbsp;current of it. He took the whole eight volumes with him,&nbsp;when he was in India, to a hill station during the hot season, and one day lent the first volume to the governor’s&nbsp;wife. She read it and lent it to the governor’s secretary,&nbsp;and went to Macaulay for the second. Thus all the eight&nbsp;volumes passed from hand to hand, and for a week or&nbsp;more the whole station was in a ferment over the fortunes&nbsp;of Clarissa, the readers anxiously waiting their turn for&nbsp;the successive volumes. Richardson is long-winded and&nbsp;prolix to a degree ; but that, in spite of all his faults, he&nbsp;had the art of interesting his own generation was abundantly proved, and apparently his greatest novel is still&nbsp;capable in favourable circumstances of exerting its spell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Richardson has long received the honour of being regarded as the founder of the English novel, but of late it has been customary to&nbsp;go a little farther back and trace the beginnings of the novel in the&nbsp;papers of Addison and Steele in the Tatler and the Spectator. The&nbsp;novel, it is said, λvas developed, not created, by Richardson. Now&nbsp;this is hardly fair to the ingenious printer, if it is meant to deny&nbsp;him any of the credit generally given to originators of new forms&nbsp;in literature. It is true that the novel was developed and not&nbsp;created, but it is not more true of Richardson’s novel than of any&nbsp;other new species of composition, such as Marlowe’s tragedy, or&nbsp;Scott’s romantic tale, or Byron’s personal epic. All alike are not&nbsp;created but developed in this sense that they have strongly marked&nbsp;affinities with kinds of writing immediately anterior to them.&nbsp;Thus in the novel of manners there are two elements—there is&nbsp;description of ordinary character, and there is plot-interest, i.e.,&nbsp;there is a story. Both of these elements are found in the generation before Richardson. But not in combination. It was he that&nbsp;combined them in his novel of manners, and therefore he is entitled&nbsp;to the praise of being the father of a new species of composition.&nbsp;There is abundance of description of manners in the Spectator and&nbsp;there are many delicate studies of character. And the general reader&nbsp;in the days of Queen Anne and of George I. had abundance of stories&nbsp;to choose from—tales of scandal, of crime, of high-flown romance.&nbsp;But it had not occurred to anybody before Richardson to make a&nbsp;heroine out of such a character as Jenny Simper, or a hero out of&nbsp;her baronet Sir Anthony Love, or a story out of incidents within&nbsp;the probabilities of ordinary life. The epistolary form in which his&nbsp;stories were cast, and which remains as a memorial of their first&nbsp;suggestion, was abandoned by Richardson’s first great follower and&nbsp;satirist, Fielding ; but it was Richardson that led the way into&nbsp;the new field of literature. He lived long enough to see many&nbsp;imitators. Within twelve years of the publication of Pamela, the&nbsp;Monthly Review began to complain of the labour of reading the&nbsp;multitude of novels submitted to its judgment, and the masterpieces of Fielding, Smollett, and Sterne were produced before his&nbsp;death in 1761. His correspondence was published in six volumes&nbsp;in 1804.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. M.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHELIEU, Armand du Plessis, Cardinal de (1585-1642), the greatest French statesman of the 17th&nbsp;century. As the chief events of his life have been&nbsp;recorded in connexion with the sketch of his political&nbsp;career in the article France (vol. ix. pp. 567-570), it only&nbsp;remains briefly to mention here some matters of secondary importance. In the early days of his courtiership&nbsp;when he retired for a time to Avignon Richelieu wrote&nbsp;two religious works which attained to considerable popularity—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Principaux points de la foy défendus contre l’escrit&nbsp;adresse au roy par les quatre ministres de Charenton&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1617), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La méthode la plus facile et assurée de convertir&nbsp;ceux qui sont séparés de l’Eglise</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1651). After he&nbsp;became master of France, his desire for distinction as a&nbsp;man of letters and especially as a dramatic author led&nbsp;him to resort to various devices that were as undignified&nbsp;and ludicrous as they were high-handed and arbitrary.&nbsp;In the life of Corneille it has already been told how he&nbsp;employed “ five poets ” to “ wash his dirty linen ” (as&nbsp;Voltaire described the similar service he rendered to&nbsp;Frederick the Great), and how he attempted to revenge&nbsp;himself on Corneille, the greatest of the five, by causing&nbsp;the French Academy to pass a hostile verdict on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cifil.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Even this high treason against art may perhaps be forgiven in consideration of the practical services the cardinal&nbsp;rendered to the cause of literature. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Τhuileries, La&nbsp;Grande Pastorale, Mirame,</span><span class="font1"> and the other plays, over whose&nbsp;fate he trembled as over the result of an embassy or a&nbsp;campaign, have long been forgotten ; but a permanent&nbsp;interest attaches to his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires</span><span class="font1"> and correspondence&nbsp;(though owing to his way of working with substitutes and&nbsp;assistants it has been a difficult task to settle how much&nbsp;of what passes under his name is authentic) :—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoire&nbsp;d<sup>,</sup>Armand du Plessis de Richelieu, éveque de Luçon écrit&nbsp;de sa main, l’année 1607 ou 1610, alors qu’il méditait de&nbsp;paraître à la cour,</span><span class="font1"> edited by Armand Baschet, 1880 ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L’Histoire de la Mere et du Fils, (i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> of Mary de’ Medici&nbsp;and Louis XIII.), Amsterdam, 1730, extending from&nbsp;1610 to 1624, frequently attributed to Mézeray ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">from 1624-1638, published in Petitot’s collection (Paris,&nbsp;1823) ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Journal de M. le Cardinal de Richelieu, 1680-1631</span><span class="font1"> (Amsterdam, 1664, 2 vols.); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testament politique du&nbsp;Cardinal de Richelieu (Paris,</span><span class="font1"> 1764); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les lettres, instructions diplomatiques, et papiers d’état du Cardinal de&nbsp;Richelieu,</span><span class="font1"> collected and edited by M.

<p><span class="font1">RICHELIEU, Louis François Armand du Plessis, Duc de, marshal of France and grand-nephew of&nbsp;Cardinal Richelieu, was born in Paris, 13th March 1696,&nbsp;and died in the same city 8th August 1788. Besides&nbsp;his reputation as the most scandalous Lovelace of a&nbsp;scandalous age, he attained, in spite of a deplorably defective education, distinction as a diplomatist and general.&nbsp;As ambassador to Vienna (1725-1729) he settled in&nbsp;1727 the preliminaries of peace; in 1745 he helped to&nbsp;gain the victory of Fontenoy ; three years afterwards he&nbsp;made a brilliant defence of Genoa; in 1756 he expelled&nbsp;the English from Minorca by the capture of the San&nbsp;Felipe fortress ; and in 1757-1758 he closed his military&nbsp;career by those pillaging campaigns in Hanover which procured him the sobriquet of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Petit Père de la Maraude.</span><span class="font1"> In&nbsp;his early days he was thrice imprisoned in the Bastille,—&nbsp;in 1711 at the instance of his stepfather, in 1716 in&nbsp;consequence of a duel, and in 1719 for his share in&nbsp;Alberoni’s conspiracy against the Regent. He was thrice&nbsp;married : first, against his will, at the age of fourteen to&nbsp;Mademoiselle de Noailles; secondly, in 1734, by the intrigues (according to the witty Frenchman’s own account)&nbsp;of Voltaire, to Mademoiselle de Guise ; and thirdly, when&nbsp;he was eighty-four years old, to an Irish lady.
