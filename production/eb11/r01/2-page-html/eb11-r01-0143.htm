<p><span class="font1">fact that Bramante, before his death in March 1514, specially requested that Raphael should be made his successor as chief&nbsp;architect of St Peter’s. To this most important post he was ap-pointed by a brief of Leo X., dated the 1st of August 1514. The&nbsp;progress of St Peter's was, however, too slow for him to leave much&nbsp;mark on its design. Another work of Bramante’s completed, by&nbsp;Raphael, was the graceful Cortile di S. Damaso in the Vatican,&nbsp;including the loggie, which were decorated with stucco-reliefs and&nbsp;paintings of sacred subjects by his pupils under his own supervision*&nbsp;Eut only very partially from his designs.@@<sup>1</sup> The Palazzo dell’&nbsp;Aquila, built for Giovanni Battista Branconio, and destroyed in&nbsp;the 17th century during the extension of St Peter’s, was one of&nbsp;Raphael’s chief works as an architect. He also designed the little&nbsp;cross church, domed at the intersection like a miniature St Peter’s,&nbsp;called S. Eligio degli Orefici, which still exists near the Tiber,&nbsp;almost opposite the Farnesina gardens, a work of but little merit.&nbsp;According to M. Geymüller, whose valuable work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Raffaello come&nbsp;Architettο</span><span class="font1"> (Milan, 1883), has done so much to increase our knowledge&nbsp;of this subject, the Villa Farnesina of Agostino Chigi, usually attributed to Peruzzi, was, as well as its palace-like stables, designed by&nbsp;Raphael; but internal evidence makes this νerv difficult to believe.&nbsp;It has too much of the delicate and refined character of the 15th&nbsp;century for Raphael, whose taste seems to have been strongly&nbsp;inclined to the more developed classic style, of which Palladio&nbsp;afterwards became the chief exponent. The Palazzo Vidoni, near&nbsp;S. Andrea della Valle, also in Rome, is usually attributed to Raphael,&nbsp;but an original sketch for this in Peruzzi’s own hand has recently&nbsp;been identified among the collection of drawings at Siena; this,&nbsp;however, is not a certain proof that the design was not Raphael’s. M. Geymüller has, however, shown that the Villa Madama, on&nbsp;the slopes of Monte Mario above Rome, was really designed by&nbsp;him, though its actual carrying out, and the unrivalled stucco-reliefs which make its interior one of the most magnificent palaces&nbsp;in the world, are due to Giulio Romano and Giovanni da Udine, as&nbsp;mentioned in Vasari’s life of the latter.@@<sup>2</sup> The original design for&nbsp;this villa made by Raphael himself has been discovered, by M.&nbsp;Geymüller. Another architectural work was the little Chigi chapel&nbsp;in S. Maria del Popolo, built in </span><span class="font0">1516, </span><span class="font1">for the dome of which the&nbsp;above-mentioned mosaics were designed (see fig. 6). At the time&nbsp;of his death he was preparing to build himself a handsome palace&nbsp;near the church of S. Eligio ; the deed for the purchase of its site&nbsp;was signed by him only a few days before his last short illness.&nbsp;Though not completed till </span><span class="font0">1530, </span><span class="font1">the Palazzo Pandolfini at Florence&nbsp;was also designed by him; it is a dull scholastic building without&nbsp;any special beauty either in proportion or treatment of the mass;&nbsp;it is illustrated by Montigny and Famin, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Architecture Toscane&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Paris, 1815), pls. 33-36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A sober criticism of Raphael’s architectural works must force one to refuse him a high position in this branch of art. In the&nbsp;church of S. Eligio and the Chigi chapel he is merely a copyist of&nbsp;Bramante, and his more original works show but little power of&nbsp;invention or even mastery of the first principles of architectural&nbsp;design. His details are, however, often delicate and refined&nbsp;(especially in the Palazzo Pandolfini), and he was supremely success-ful in the decorative treatment of richly ornamented interiors when&nbsp;he did not, as in some of the Vatican stanze, sacrifice the room to&nbsp;the frescoes on its walls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sculpture,—</span><span class="font1">That Vasari is right in attributing to him the model for the beautiful statue of Jonah in the Chigi chapel (fig. 7) is&nbsp;borne witness to by two important documents, which show that&nbsp;his almost universal talents led him to attempt with success the&nbsp;preliminary part of the sculptor’s art, though there is no evidence&nbsp;to show that he ever worked on marble.@@3 One of these is a letter&nbsp;written to Michelangelo to warn him that Raphael had been invading his province as a sculptor by modelling a boy, which had&nbsp;been executed in marble by a pupil, and was a work of much beauty.&nbsp;Again, after his death his friend Baldassare Castiglione, in a letter</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">dated the 8th of May 1523, asks his steward in Rome “ if Giulio Romano still possesses a certain boy in marble by Raphael and&nbsp;what his lowest price for</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">it would be,”—“ s’egli</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">[Giulio Romano] ha più quel puttino di marmo di mano di Raffaello e&nbsp;per quanto si daria all’&nbsp;ultimo.” A group in&nbsp;marble of a Dead Boy on&nbsp;his Dolphin Playfellow,&nbsp;now in the St Petersburg&nbsp;Hermitage, has been&nbsp;erroneously supposed to&nbsp;be Raphael’s “ puttino,”&nbsp;which has also been&nbsp;identified with a statu-ette of a child formerly&nbsp;at Florence in the possession of Signor Molini.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>The statue of Jonah was&nbsp;executed in marble by&nbsp;Lorenzetto, a Florentine&nbsp;sculptor; and it remained in his studio for&nbsp;many years after Raphael’s death. The Victoria and Albert Museum&nbsp;possesses a small clay&nbsp;sketch for this beautiful&nbsp;group, slightly different&nbsp;from the marble; it is&nbsp;probably the original&nbsp;design by the master’s&nbsp;own hand. The whole&nbsp;feeling of the group—a&nbsp;beautiful youth seated&nbsp;on a sea-monster—is&nbsp;purely classical, and the&nbsp;motive is probably taken&nbsp;from some antique statue&nbsp;representing Arion or Taras on a dolphin.@@<sup>5</sup> Being intended for a&nbsp;church it was necessary to give the figure a sacred name, and&nbsp;hence the very incongruous title that it received. There is no&nbsp;trace of Raphael’s hand in the design of the other statue, an Elijah&nbsp;by Lorenzetto, though it also is ascribed to him by Vasari.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lesser Arts practised by Raphael.—</span><span class="font1">Like other great artists,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Raphael did not disdain to practise the lesser branches of art: a design for a silver perfume-burner with female caryatids is preserved&nbsp;in an engraving by Marco da Ravenna; and he also designed two&nbsp;handsome repoussé salvers for Agostino Chigi, drawings for which&nbsp;are now at Dresden. In designs for tarsia-work and wood-carving he was especially skilful; witness the magnificent doors and&nbsp;shutters of the stanze executed by his pupil Giovanni Barile of&nbsp;Siena.@@6 The majolica designs attributed to him were by a name-sake and relation called Raffaello di Ciarla;@@<sup>7</sup> and, though many&nbsp;fine dishes and ewers of Urbino and other majolica are decorated&nbsp;with Raphael’s designs, they are all taken from pictures or engravings, not specially done by him for ceramic purposes. With the&nbsp;frivolity of his age Leo X. occasionally wasted Raphael’s skill on&nbsp;unworthy subjects, such as the scenery of a temporary theatre; and&nbsp;in 1516 the pope set him to paint in fresco the portrait life-size&nbsp;of a large elephant, the gift of the king of Portugal, after the animal&nbsp;was dead.@@<sup>8</sup> This elephant is also introduced among the stucco&nbsp;reliefs of the Vatican loggie, with the poetaster Barrabal sitting&nbsp;in mock triumph on its back.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Though Raphael himself docs not appear to have practised the art of engraving, yet this formed one of the many branches of art&nbsp;which were carried on under his supervision. A large number of his&nbsp;designs were engraved by his pupils Marcantonio Raimondi and&nbsp;Agostino Veneziano. These valuable engravings are from Raphael’s&nbsp;sketches, not from his finished pictures, and in some cases they show</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

Too great a share in the&nbsp;decoration of the loggie is usually given to Raphael; not only the&nbsp;harsh colour but also the feebleness of much of the drawing shows&nbsp;that he can have had but little to do with it.</span></p>

Angelo, both richly decorated with delicate&nbsp;stucco-reliefs and paintings, treated after a classical model.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@3</sup> See note on p. 369, vol. iv., of Milanesi’s edition of Vasari (Florence, 1879). To one branch of the sculptor’s art, practised&nbsp;under Raphael’s supervision, belong the elaborate and delicately&nbsp;executed stucco-reliefs of the loggie and elsewhere. Among these&nbsp;occur many panels with figure-subjects, large in scale and important&nbsp;in composition; those executed during his lifetime are free from&nbsp;the too pictorial character which is an obvious fault in the very&nbsp;magnificent reliefs of the Villa Madama.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
