<p><span class="font1">(Suczawa), the earliest seat of the voivodes, and Cemautif or Czemovicz, was in 1774 occupied by Habsburg troops with&nbsp;Russian connivance, and in 1777 Baron Thugut procured its&nbsp;formal cession from the sultan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(4) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Danubian Principalities: 1774-1859.—</span><span class="font1"> By the&nbsp;treaty of Kutchuk Kainardji Russia consented to hand back&nbsp;the principalities to the sultan, but by Article xvi.&nbsp;several stipulations were made in favour of the Walachians and Moldavians. The people of the principalities were to enjoy all the privileges that they had&nbsp;possessed under Mahomet IV.; they were to be freed from&nbsp;tribute for two years, as some compensation for the ruinous&nbsp;effects of the last war; they were to pay a moderate tribute;&nbsp;the agents of Walachia and Moldavia at Constantinople were&nbsp;to enjoy the rights of national representatives, and the Russian&nbsp;minister at the Porte should on occasion watch over the&nbsp;interests of the principalities. The stipulations of the treaty,&nbsp;though deficient in precision (the Walachians, for instance,&nbsp;had no authentic record of the privileges enjoyed under&nbsp;Mahomet IV.), formed the basis of future liberties in both&nbsp;principalities; but for the moment all reforms were postponed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The treaty was hardly concluded when it was violated by the Porte, which refused to recognize the right of the Walachian&nbsp;boiars to elect their voivode, and nominated Alexander Ypsilanti,&nbsp;a creature of its own. In 1777 Constantine Murusi was made&nbsp;voivode of Moldavia in the same high-handed fashion. The&nbsp;Divan seemed intent on restoring the old system </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">government&nbsp;in its entirety, but in 1783 the Russian representative extracted&nbsp;from the sultan a decree </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(hattisherif)</span><span class="font1"> defining more precisely the&nbsp;liberties of the principalities and fixing the amount of the annual&nbsp;tribute—for Walachia 619 purses exclusive of various&nbsp;“presents” amounting to 130,000 piasters, and for Moldavia&nbsp;135 purses and further gifts to the extent of 115,000 piasters.&nbsp;By the peace of Jassy in 1792 the Dniester was recognized as&nbsp;the Russian frontier, and the privileges of the principalities as&nbsp;specified in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hattisherif</span><span class="font1"> confirmed. In defiance of treaties,&nbsp;however, the Porte continued to change the hospodars almost&nbsp;yearly and to exact extraordinary installation presents. The&nbsp;revolt of Pas van Oglu in Bulgaria was the cause of great injury&nbsp;to Walachia. The rebels ravaged Little Walachia in i8or-2,&nbsp;and their ravages were succeeded by those of the Turkish troops,&nbsp;who now swarmed over the country. Exaction followed exaction, and in 1802 Russia resolved to assert her treaty rights in&nbsp;favour of the oppressed inhabitants of the principalities. On&nbsp;the accession of Constantine Ypsilanti (1802-6) in Walachia,&nbsp;and of Alexander Murusi (1802-6) in Moldavia, the Porte&nbsp;was constrained to issue a new </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hattisherif</span><span class="font1"> by which every prince&nbsp;was to hold bis office for at least seven years, unless the&nbsp;Porte satisfied the Russian minister that there were good&nbsp;and sufficient grounds for his deposition. This clause&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hattisherif</span><span class="font1"> was not enforced. All irregular contributions&nbsp;were to cease, and all citizens, with the exception of the boiars&nbsp;and clergy, were to pay their share of the tribute. The Turkish&nbsp;troops then employed in the principalities were to be paid off,&nbsp;and one year’s tribute remitted for the purpose. The boiars were&nbsp;to be responsible for the maintenance of schools, hospitals and&nbsp;roads; they and the prince together for the militia. The&nbsp;number of Turkish merchants resident in the country was&nbsp;limited. Finally, the hospodars were to be amenable to representations made to them by the Russian envoy at Constantinople, to whom was entrusted the task of watching over the&nbsp;Walachian and Moldavian liberties. This, it will be seen, was a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">veiled Russian protectorate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1804 the Serbs under Karageorge rose against the Turkish dominion, and were secretly aided by the Walachian voivode&nbsp;Ypsilanti. The Porte, instigated by Napoleon’s ambassador&nbsp;Sebastiani, resolved on Ypsilanti’s deposition, but the hospodar&nbsp;succeeded in escaping to St Petersburg. In the war that now&nbsp;ensued between the Russians and the Turks, the Russians were&nbsp;for a time successful, and even demanded that the Russian&nbsp;territory should extend to the Danube. They occupied&nbsp;the principalities from 1806 to 1812. In 1808 they formed a&nbsp;governing committee consisting of the metropolitan, another&nbsp;bishop, and four or five boiars under the presidency of General&nbsp;Kusnikov. The seat of the president was at Jassy, and General&nbsp;Engelhart was appointed as vice-president at Bucharest. By&nbsp;the peace of Bucharest, however, in 1812, the principalities were&nbsp;restored to the sultan under the former conditions, with the&nbsp;exception of Bessarabia, which was ceded to the tsar. The&nbsp;Pruth thus became the Russian boundary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The growing solidarity between the two Ruman principalities received a striking illustration in 1816, when the Walachian and&nbsp;Moldavian hospodars published together a code applicable to&nbsp;both countries, and which had been elaborated by a joint commission. The Greek movement was now beginning to assume&nbsp;a practical shape. About 1780 Riga Velestiniul, a Hellcnized&nbsp;Vlach from Macedonia who is also known by the purely Greek&nbsp;name of Rigas Phereos, had founded in Bucharest a patriotic&nbsp;and revolutionary association known as the Society of Friends&nbsp;(eratpta </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">t&amp;v</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> &lt;/&gt;£Xwp) which gradually attained great influence. In i8ro Ignatius, the metropolitan of Walachia,&nbsp;founded a Greek literary society in Bucharest which&nbsp;soon developed into a political association, and many&nbsp;similar bodies were formed throughout the Greek world,&nbsp;and finally united into one powerful secret society, the Hetairia.&nbsp;Some of the members even cherished the fantastic hope of&nbsp;restoring the ancient Byzantine empire. In 1821 Alexander&nbsp;Ypsilanti, a son of the voivode, and an aide-de-camp of the tsar&nbsp;Alexander I., entered Moldavia at the head of the Hetaerists,&nbsp;and, representing that he had the support of the tsar, prevailed&nbsp;on the hospodar Michael Sutzu to aid him in invading the Ottoman dominions. To secure Walachian help, Ypsilanti advanced&nbsp;on Bucharest, but the prince, Theodore Vladimirescu, who represented the national Ruman reaction against the Phanariotes,&nbsp;repulsed his overtures with the remark “ that his business&nbsp;was not to march against the Turks, but to clear the country&nbsp;of Phanariotes.” Vladimirescu was slain by a Greek revolutionary agent, but Ypsilanti rashly continuing his enterprise&nbsp;after he had been repudiated by the Russian emperor, his forces&nbsp;were finally crushed by the Turks at Dragashani, in Walachia,&nbsp;and at Skuleni, in Moldavia; and the result of his revolt was a&nbsp;Turkish occupation of the principalities. In 1822 the Turkish&nbsp;troops, who had committed great excesses, were withdrawn&nbsp;on the combined representations of Russia, Austria and Great&nbsp;Britain. The country, however, was again ravaged by the&nbsp;retiring troops, quarters of Jassy and Bucharest burnt, and&nbsp;the complete evacuation delayed till 1824, when the British&nbsp;government again remonstrated with the Porte (see Eastern&nbsp;Question; Greece; Ypsilanti; Alexander).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By the convention of Akkerman between the Russians and the Turks in 1826 the privileges of the principalities were once&nbsp;more confirmed, and they were again ratified in 1829,&nbsp;under Russian guarantee, by the peace of Adrianople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By this peace all the towns on the left bank of the Danube were restored to the principalities, and the&nbsp;Porte undertook to refrain from fortifying any position on the&nbsp;Walachian side of the river. A Russian army occupied the&nbsp;country until the Porte fulfilled its promises. The principalities were to enjoy commercial freedom, and the right of&nbsp;establishing a quarantine cordon along the Danube or elsewhere. The internal constitution of the countries was to be&nbsp;regulated by an “ Organic Law,” which was drawn up by assemblies of bishops and boiars at Jassy and Bucharest, acting,&nbsp;however, under Russian control. The Organic Law thus elaborated was by no means of a liberal character, and amongst other&nbsp;abuses maintained the feudal privileges of the boiars. It was&nbsp;ratified by the Porte in 1834, and the Russian army of occupation thereupon withdrew. The newly elected hospodars,&nbsp;Alexander Ghica (1834-42) and George Bibescu (1842-48) in&nbsp;Walachia, and Michael Sturdza (1834-49) in Moldavia, ruled in&nbsp;accordance with the Organic Law. Their reigns were marked&nbsp;by the social, financial and political predominance of Russia,&nbsp;which had steadily increased since 1711. The treaty of 1774&nbsp;had given Russia a firm foothold in Rumanian politics. This</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
