It is bare of feathers, and is in a manner armed with an helmet of horny ſubſtance, that covers it from the root of the bill to near half the head backwards. This helmet is black before and yellow behind. Its ſubſtance is very hard, being formed by the elevation of the bone of the ſkull ; and it conſiſts of ſeveral plates, one over another, like the horn of an ox. Some have ſuppoſed that this was ſhed every year with the feathers ; but the moſt probable opinion is, that it only exfoliates slowly like the beak. To the peculiar oddity of this natural armour may be added the colour of the eye in this animal, which is a bright yellow; and the globe being above an inch and a half in diameter, give it an air equally fierce and extraordinary. The hole of the ear is very large and open, being only covered with ſmall black feathers. The ſides of the head, about the eye and ear, being deſtitute of any covering, are blue, except the middle of the lower eyelid, which is white. The part of the bill which anſwers to the upper jaw in other animals is very hard at the edges above, and the extremity of it is like that of a turkey-cock. The end of the lower mandible is ſlightly notched, and the whole is of a greyiſh brown, except a green ſpot on each ſide. As the beak admits a very wide opening, this contributes not a little to the bird’s menacing appearance. The neck is of a violet colour, inclining to that of slate ; and it is red behind in ſeveral places, but chiefly in the middle. About the middle of the neck before, at the rise of the large feathers, there are two procesſes formed by the ſkin, which reſemble ſomewhat the gills of a cock, but that they are blue as well as red. The ſkin which covers the forepart of the breaſt, on which this bird leans and reſts, is hard, callous, and without feathers. The thighs and legs are covered with feathers, and are extremely thick, ſtrong, ſtraight, and covered with ſcales of ſeveral ſhapes ; but the legs are thicker a little above the foot than in any other place. The toes are likewiſe covered with ſcales, and are but three in number ; for that which ſhould be behind is wanting. The claws are of a hard ſolid ſubſtance, black without and white within.</p><p>The internal parts are equally remarkable. The caſſowary unites with the double ſtomach of animals that live upon vegetables the ſhort inteſtines of thoſe that live upon fleſh. The inteſtines of the cassowary are 13 times ſhorter than thoſe of the oſtrich. The heart is very ſmall, being but an inch and an half long, and an inch broad at the baſe. Upon the whole, it has the head of a warrior, the eye of a lion, the defence of a porcupine, and the ſwiftneſs of a courſer.</p><p>Thus formed for a life of hoſtility, for terrifying others, and for its own defence, it might be expected that the caſsowary was one of the moſt fierce and terrible animals of the creation. But nothing is ſo oppoſite to its natural character : it never attacks others ; and inſtead of the bill, when attacked, it rather makes uſe of its legs, and kicks like a horſe, or runs againſt its purſuer, beats him down, and treads him to the ground.</p><p>The manner in which this animal moves is not leſs extraordinary than its appearance. Inſtead of going directly forward, it ſeems to kick up behind with one leg ; and then making a bound onward with the other, it goes with ſuch prodigious velocity, that the ſwifteſt racer would be left far behind.</p><p>The ſame degree of voraciouſneſs which we perceived in the oſtrich obtains as ſtrongly here. The caiſowary ſwallows every thing that comes within the capacity of its gullet. The Dutch assert, that it can devour not only glaſs, iron, and ſtones, but even live and burning coals, without teſtifying the ſmalleſt fear or feeling the leaſt injury. It is ſaid, that the passage of the food through its gullet is performed ſo ſpeedily, that even the very eggs which it has ſwallowed whole paſs through it unbroken in the ſame form they went down. In fact, the alimentary canal of this animal, as was obſerved above, is extremely ſhort ; and it may happen, that many kinds of food are indigeſtible in its ſtomach, as wheat or currants are to man, when ſwallowed whole.</p><p>The caſſowary’s eggs are of a grey-aſh colour, inclining to green. They are not ſo large nor ſo round as thoſe of the oſtrich. They are marked with a number of little tubercles of a deep green, and the ſhell is not very thick. The largeſt of theſe is found to be 15 inches round one way, and about 12 the other.</p><p>The ſouthern parts of the moſt eaſtern Indies ſeem to be the natural climate of the caffowary. His domain, if we may ſo call it, begins where that of the oſtrich terminates. The latter has never been found beyond the Ganges; while the caiſowary is never ſeen nearer than the iſlands of Banda, Sumatra, Java, the Molucca iſlands, and the correſponding parts of the continent. Yet even here this animal ſeems not to have multiplied in any conſiderable degree, as we find one of the kings of Java making a preſent of one of theſe birds to the captain of a Dutch ſhip, conſidering it as a very great rarity.</p><p>2. The <hi rend="italic">Caſuarius Novae Hollandiae,</hi> or New Holland caſſowary, differs conſiderably from the common casſowary. It is a much larger bird, ſtanding higher on its legs, and having the neck longer than in the common one. Total length ſeven feet two inches. The bill is not greatly different from that of the common caiſowary ; but the horny appendage or helmet on the top of the head in this ſpecies is totally wanting : the whole of the head and neck is alſo covered with feathers, except the throat and fore part of the neck about half way, which are not ſo well feathered as the rest ; whereas in the common caiſowary the head and neck are bare and carunculated as in the turkey.</p><p>The plumage in general conſiſts of a mixture of brown and grey, and the feathers are ſomewhat curled or bent at the ends in the natural ſtate : the wings are ſo very ſhort as to be totally uſeleſs for flight, and indeed are ſcarcely to be distinguiſhed from the reſt of the plumage, were it not for their ſtanding out a little. The long ſpines which are ſeen in the wings of the common sort are in this not obſervable, nor is there any appearance of a tail. The legs are ſtout, formed much as in the galeated casſowary, with the addition of their being jagged or ſawed the whole of their length at the back part.</p><p>This bird is not uncommon in New Holland, as ſeveral of them have been ſeen about Botany Bay and other parts. Although it cannot fly, it runs ſo swiftly, that a greyhound can ſcarcely overtake it. The fleſh is ſaid to be in taſte not unlike beef.</p><p>STRUTHIOLA, in botany ; a genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">tetrandria,</hi> and order of <hi rend="italic">mοnogyma.</hi> The corolla is wanting ; the calyx is tubulous, with eight glandules at its mouth ; the berry is without juice, and monespermous.
