<p><span class="font0">names being </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gora</span><span class="font0"> (mountain). The serpent Gorinich lives in caves, and has the care of the precious metals. Sometimes&nbsp;animal natures are mixed up with them, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zmei-bogatyr,</span><span class="font0"> who&nbsp;unites the qualities of the serpent and the giant, and bears&nbsp;the name of Tügarin Zmievich. There is the Pagan Idol&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Idolistche Poganskoe),</span><span class="font0"> a great glutton, and Nightingale the&nbsp;Robber </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Solovey Razboinik),</span><span class="font0"> who terrifies travellers and lives&nbsp;in a nest built upon six oaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the second cycle the legends group themselves round the celebrated Prince Vladimir of Kiev. The chief hero is Ilya&nbsp;Muromets, who performs prodigies of valour, and is of gigantic&nbsp;stature and superhuman strength. The cycle of Novgorod&nbsp;deals with the stories of Vasilii Buslaevich and Sadko, the rich&nbsp;merchant. The fourth cycle deals with the autocracy; already&nbsp;Moscow has become the capital of the future empire. We are&nbsp;told of the taking of Kazan, of the conquest of Siberia by&nbsp;Yermak, of Ivan the Terrible and his confidant Maliuta Skur-latovich. It is observable that in the popular tradition Ivan&nbsp;is not spoken of with any hatred. As early as 1619 some of&nbsp;these </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">byliny</span><span class="font0"> were committed to writing by Richard James,&nbsp;an Oxford graduate who was in Russia as chaplain of the&nbsp;embassy. The most pathetic is that relating to the unfortunate&nbsp;Xenia, the daughter of Boris Godunov. Yermak, the conqueror&nbsp;of Siberia, forms the subject of a very spirited lay, and there is&nbsp;another on the death of Ivan the Terrible. Considering the&nbsp;relation in which she stood to the Russians, we cannot wonder&nbsp;that Marina, the wife of the false Demetrius, appears as a&nbsp;magician. Many spirited poems are consecrated to the achievements of Stenka Razin, the bold robber of the Volga, who was&nbsp;for a long time a popular hero. The cycle of Peter the Great&nbsp;is a very interesting one. We have songs in abundance on the&nbsp;achievements of the tsar, as the taking of Azov in 1696. There&nbsp;is also a poem on the execution of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">streiisy,</span><span class="font0"> and another&nbsp;on the death of Peter. In the more modem period there are&nbsp;many songs on Napoleon. The Cossack songs, written in the&nbsp;Little Russian language, dwell upon the glories of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">seek,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;sufferings of the people from the invasions of the Turks and&nbsp;Mongols, the exploits of the Haidamaks and, lastly, the fall of&nbsp;the Cossack republic. Besides these, the Russians can boast&nbsp;of large collections of religious poems, many of them containing&nbsp;very curious legends. In them we have a complete store of the&nbsp;beliefs of the Middle Ages. A rich field may be found here for&nbsp;the study of comparative mythology and folk-lore. Many of&nbsp;them are of considerable antiquity, and some seem to have been&nbsp;derived from the Midrash. Some of the more important of&nbsp;these have been collected by Beszonov. Besides the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">byliny</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;legendary poems, the Russians have large collections of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">skazki&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or folk tales, which have been gathered together by Sakharov,&nbsp;Afanasiev and others. They also are full of valuable materials&nbsp;for the study of comparative mythology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Leaving the popular and oral literature, we come to what has been committed to writing. The earliest specimen of&nbsp;Russian, properly so called, must be considered the&nbsp;Ostromir Codex, written by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">diak</span><span class="font0"> Gregory at the&nbsp;order of Ostromir, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">posadnik</span><span class="font0"> or governor of Novgorod. This is a Russian recension of the Slavonic Gospels, of the&nbsp;date 1056-57. Of the year 1073 we have the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Izbornik</span><span class="font0"> or “ Miscellany ” of Sviatoslav. It was written by John the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">diak</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;deacon for that prince, and is a kind of Russian encyclopaedia,&nbsp;drawn from Greek sources. The date is 1076. The style is&nbsp;praised by Buslaev as clear and simple. The next monument&nbsp;of the language is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Discourse concerning the Old and New&nbsp;Testament</span><span class="font0">, by Hilarión, metropolitan of Kiev. In this work&nbsp;there is a panegyric on Prince Vladimir of Kiev, the hero of so&nbsp;much of the Russian popular poetry. Other writers are Theodosius, a monk of the Pestcherskiy cloister, who wrote on the&nbsp;Latin faith and some </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pouchenia</span><span class="font0"> or “ Instructions, ” and Luke&nbsp;Zhidiata, bishop of Novgorod, who has left us a curious </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Discourse&nbsp;to the Brethren.</span><span class="font0"> From the writings of Theodosius we see that&nbsp;many pagan habits were still in vogue among the people. He&nbsp;finds fault with them for allowing these to continue, and also&nbsp;for their drunkenness; nor do the monks escape his censures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Zhidiata writes in a more vernacular style than many of his contemporaries; he eschews the declamatory tone of the&nbsp;Byzantine authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font0"> of Nestor </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> begins the long series of the Russian annalists. There is a regular catena of&nbsp;these chronicles, extending with only two breaks&nbsp;to the time of Alexis Mikhailovich, the father of Peter&nbsp;the Great. Besides the work attributed to Nestor,&nbsp;we have chronicles of Novgorod, Kiev, Volhynia.and many&nbsp;others. Every town of any importance could boast of its&nbsp;annalists, Pskov and Suzdal among others. In some respects&nbsp;these compilations, the productions of monks in their cloisters,&nbsp;remind us of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,</span><span class="font0"> dry details alternating&nbsp;with* here and there a picturesque incident; and many of&nbsp;these annals abound with the quaintest stories. There are&nbsp;also works of early travellers, as the igumen Daniel, w ho visited&nbsp;the Holy Land at the end of the nth and beginning of the 12th&nbsp;century. A later traveller was Athanasius Nikitin, a merchant&nbsp;of Tver, who visited India in 1470. He has left a record of his&nbsp;adventures, which has been translated into English and published for the Hakluyt Society. Later also is the account w ritten&nbsp;by the two merchants, Korobeinikov and Grekov. They were&nbsp;sent with a sum of money to the Holy Sepulchre to entreat the&nbsp;monks to pray without ceasing for the soul of the son of Ivan&nbsp;the Terrible, whom his father had killed. A curious monument&nbsp;of old Slavonic times is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pouchenie</span><span class="font0"> (“ Instruction ”), written&nbsp;by Vladimir Monomakh for the benefit of his sons. This composition is generally found inserted in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font0"> of Nestor;&nbsp;it gives a quaint picture of the daily life of a Slavonic prince.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the 12th century we have the sermons of Cyril, the bishop of Turov, which are attempts to imitate in Russian the florid&nbsp;Byzantine style. In his sermon on Holy Week,&nbsp;Christianity is represented under the form of spring,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Paganism and Judaism under that of winter, and evil thoughts are spoken of as boisterous winds. And here may&nbsp;be mentioned the many lives of the saints and the Fathers to be&nbsp;found in early Russian literature. Some of these have been&nbsp;edited by Count Bezborodko in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pametniki Starinnoy Russkoy&nbsp;Literatury</span><span class="font0"> (“ Memorials of Ancient Russian Literature ”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We now come to the story of the expedition of Prince Igor, which is a kind of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bylina</span><span class="font0"> in prose, and narrates the expedition of Igor, prince of Novgorod-Severskiy, against the&nbsp;Polovtzes. The manuscript was at one time preserved&nbsp;in a monastery at Yaroslavl, but was burnt in the great&nbsp;fire at Moscow in the year 1812. Luckily the story had been&nbsp;edited (after a fashion) by Count Musin-Pushkin, and a transcript was also found among the papers of the empress Catherine.&nbsp;The original was seen by several men of letters in Russia, Karamzin among the number. There is a mixture of Christian and&nbsp;heathen allusions, but there are parallels to this style of writing&nbsp;in such a piece as the “ Discourse of a Lover of Christ and&nbsp;Advocate of the True Faith, ” from which an extract has been&nbsp;given by Buslaev in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chrestomathy.</span><span class="font0"> There is a gTeat deal of&nbsp;poetical spirit in the story of Igor, and the metaphors are&nbsp;frequently very vigorous. Mention is made in it of another bard&nbsp;named Boyan, but none of his inspirations have come down&nbsp;to us. A strange legend is that of the tsar Solomon and&nbsp;Kitovras, but the story occurs in the popular literatures&nbsp;of many countries. Some similar productions among the •</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russians are merely adaptations of old Bulgarian tales, especially the so-called apocryphal writings. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zadonstchina&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is a sort of prose poem much in the style of the “ Story of Igor, ”&nbsp;and the resemblance of the latter to this piece and to many&nbsp;other of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">skazania</span><span class="font0"> included in or attached to the Russian&nbsp;chronicle, furnishes an additional proof of its genuineness.&nbsp;The account of the battle of the “ Field of Woodcocks, ” which&nbsp;was gained by Dmitri Donskoy over the Mongols in 1380, has&nbsp;come down in three important versions. The first bears the&nbsp;title “ Story of the Fight of the Prince Dmitri Ivanovich with&nbsp;Mamai ”; it is rather meagre in details but full of expressions&nbsp;showing the patriotism of the writer. The second version is&nbsp;more complete in its historical details, but still is not without</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
