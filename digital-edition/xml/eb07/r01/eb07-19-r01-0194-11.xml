<p><label>REVERSION</label>
in the law of England, has two significations ; the one of which is, an estate left, which continues during a particular state in being ; and the other is the returning of the land, after the particular estate is ended ;</p><p>and it is further said to be an interest in lands, when the possession of it fails, or where the estate, which was for a time parted with, returns to the granters or their heirs. But, according to the usual definition of a reversion, it is the residue of an estate left in the granter, after a particular estate granted away ceases, continuing in the granter of such an estate.</p><p>The difference between a remainder and a reversion consists in this, that the remainder may belong to any man except the granter ; whereas the reversion returns to him who conveyed the lands.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Reversion, in annuities.
