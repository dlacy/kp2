He was educated at Westminster school, whence in 1651 he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford. He became B.A. in 1654, and the same year wrote several Latin verses to congratulate Cromwell on concluding peace with the Dutch, which were published in a collection of university poems. The following year he published a Latin poem, entitled <hi rend="italic">Musica Incantans.</hi> After commencing M.A. in 1657 he was in the habit before obtaining orders in 1658 of preaching as the champion of Calvinism against Socinianism and Arminianism. He was also at this time a strong supporter of Presbyterianism, but on the approach of the Restoration his views on church government under-</p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s05-0282" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0300.jp2"/><p>went a change. In fact he adhered successively to the triumphant party as represented by Cromwell, Charles, James, and William, and there are substantial grounds for the assertion of Anthony Wood that he was much indebted for his preferments to his zeal for “the powers that be.” On 10th August 1660 he was chosen public orator of the university, and in 1661 domestic chaplain to Lord Clarendon. In March 1663 he was made prebend of Westminster, and shortly afterwards he received from his university the degree of D.D. In 1667 he became chaplain to the duke of York. He was a zealous advocate of the doctrine of passive obedience, and also strongly opposed the Toleration Act, declaiming in unmeasured terms against the various nonconformist sects. In 1676 he was appointed chaplain to Lawrence Hyde (afterwards earl of Rochester), ambassador-extraordinary to the king of Poland, and of his visit he sent an interesting account to Dr Edward Pocock in a letter, dated Dantzic, 16th December 1677, which was printed along with South’s <hi rend="italic">Posthumous</hi> <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> in 1717. In 1678 he was promoted by the chapter of Westminster to the rectory of Islip, Oxfordshire. Owing, it is said, to a personal grudge, South in 1693 published <hi rend="italic">Animadversions on Dr Sherlock’s Book, entitled a Vindication of the Holy and Ever Blessed Trinity,</hi> in which the views of Sherlock were attacked with much sarcastic bitterness. Sherlock, in answer, published a <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi> in 1694, to which South replied in <hi rend="italic">Tritheism Charged upon Dr Sherlock's New Notion of the Trinity, and the Charge Made Good.</hi> The controversy was carried by the rival parties into the pulpit, and occasioned such keen feeling that the king interposed to stop it. During the greater part of the reign of Anne South remained comparatively quiet, but in 1710 he showed himself a keen opponent of Sacheverell. He died 8th July 1716, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p><p>The style of South is vigorous, pungent, and brilliant, though tending to exuberance. His sermons are strongly practical, but his theory of life is not ascetic. His wit generally inclines towards sarcasm, and it was probably the knowledge of his quarrelsome temperament that prevented his promotion to a bishopric. If he sacrificed principle to his desire for preferment, his ambition was not of a sordid kind, for he was noted for the extent of his charities. He published a large number of single sermons, and they appeared in a collected form in 1692 in six volumes, reaching a second edition in his lifetime in 1715. His <hi rend="italic">Opera Posthuma Latina,</hi> including his will, his Latin poems, and his orations while public orator, with memoirs of his life, appeared in 1717. His <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> were published with a memoir by the Clarendon press in 1823, and have been several times reprinted. The contemporary notice of South by Wood in his <hi rend="italic">Athenæ</hi> is characterized by a strongly hostile tone, partly to be explained by a criticism of South at Wood’s expense.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
