<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">exception understand the relation between God and man as one between the supreme lord and king (El the mighty,&nbsp;Baal, Bel, Adon, Malik, Sar) and his subject or slave&nbsp;('Abd, 'Obed, Bod), his client or protected one (Jar, Gel־).&nbsp;They are eminently theocratic, and show a marked tendency&nbsp;to monotheism, which, both in Israel and in Arabia, is the&nbsp;last word of their religious development.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It is not so easy to determine the grade of relationship between the different Semitic religions as it is to show&nbsp;that they all descend from a common parent. Moreover&nbsp;the question is complicated by another problem—Whether&nbsp;the Babylonians and Assyrians borrowed the greater part&nbsp;of their religious conceptions and institutions from a&nbsp;foreign, non-Semitic people, the primitive inhabitants of&nbsp;their country, and if this be the case what they then have&nbsp;of their own and what is due to the influence of that&nbsp;ancient civilization. Whatever may be the final solution&nbsp;of this question, we shall not go far wrong if we distinguish the Semitic religions into two principal groups—the&nbsp;one comprising the southern or Arabic, with perhaps the&nbsp;most ancient Hebrew, the other all the Northern Semitic&nbsp;religions from the Tigris to the Mediterranean,—leaving&nbsp;it undecided whether the undeniable relationship between&nbsp;the north-eastern and the north-western Semitic religions&nbsp;be that of parent and children or that of sisters—in&nbsp;other words, whether it be due to the influence of the&nbsp;superior culture of the former or to the fact that they all&nbsp;have radiated from a common centre. This only is beyond&nbsp;doubt, that the Assyrian religion is a daughter of the&nbsp;Babylonian, and that the Canaanitic and Phoenician&nbsp;modes of worship are closely allied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">What we give on last page is no more than a rough genealogical table of the Semitic religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A detailed and accurate genealogical classification of the religions which do not belong to either of those two&nbsp;principal families is out of the question. Their mutual&nbsp;relation can be fixed only in a general way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">African Religions</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The first problem to be solved is the classification of the Egyptian religion. It is neither&nbsp;Semitic and theocratic nor Aryan and theanthropic. But&nbsp;it has many elements that belong to the former, and also&nbsp;a few elements that belong to the latter category, which&nbsp;might lead to the supposition that it represents a stage in&nbsp;the development of the great Mediterranean, commonly&nbsp;called the Caucasian, race, anterior to the separation of the&nbsp;Aryan family from the Semitic. But this is no more than&nbsp;a supposition, as the existence of such a Mediterranean race,&nbsp;embracing the so-called Hamites, Semites, and Japhetites or&nbsp;Aryans, is itself a pure hypothesis. All we know is that&nbsp;the Egyptians themselves mention a people called Punt (the&nbsp;Phut of the Bible), with whom they had commercial relations and whose religion was akin to their own, so much&nbsp;so that they called the country of Punt, on the western&nbsp;Arabian and on the opposite African coast, the Holy Land&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(la neter).</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> The same may be said of the Cushites, the&nbsp;southern neighbours of Egypt, the ancient pre-Semitic&nbsp;Ethiopians; and a pre-Semitic population also may have&nbsp;lived in Canaan, allied to the Egyptians and ethnologically&nbsp;or genealogically combined with them, with Cush, and with&nbsp;Phut in the tenth chapter of Genesis. But, as we know&nbsp;next to nothing about their religions, a Hamitic family of&nbsp;religions, including these four, is still purely hypothetical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">That the primitive religion of southern Mesopotamia, commonly called Accadian or Sumerian, was related to the&nbsp;Egyptian, is also a mere conjecture, which does not seem&nbsp;to be favoured by the newly discovered facts. Finally,&nbsp;the scanty remains of the pre-Islarnic religion of the&nbsp;Imoshagh or Berbers, the ancestors of the Libyans (in&nbsp;Egyptian Eibu), the Gaetulians, the Mauretanians, and the&nbsp;Numidians resemble in some degree Egyptian customs</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and notions; but, whether they point to genealogical relationship or are due to early Egyptian influence, it is&nbsp;hard to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">This, however, cannot be denied, that there are to be found in the Egyptian religion a great many magical rites&nbsp;and animistic customs, closely resembling those which&nbsp;prevail throughout the whole African continent. If then,&nbsp;as is generally supposed,@@<sup>1</sup> the dominant race sprang from&nbsp;Asiatic settlers and conquerors, who long before the dawn&nbsp;of history invaded the country, subjugated the dark-coloured inhabitants, and mixed with them, and if it is&nbsp;to these foreigners that the more elevated elements in the&nbsp;Egyptian religion are due, the basis of this religion is of a&nbsp;purely Nigritian character.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">All we can say about the other original religions of the dark continent is that they resemble one another in many&nbsp;respects. We may distinguish four principal groups :—(1)&nbsp;the Cushite, inhabiting the i)orth-eastern coast region&nbsp;south of Egypt; (2) the Nigritian proper, including all&nbsp;the Negro tribes of inner Africa and the west coast; (3)&nbsp;the Bantu or Kaffrarian (Kafir); and (4) the Klioi-Khoin&nbsp;or Hottentot, including the Bushmen, in South Africa.&nbsp;Before we can come to decision with regard to the first-named group, we must receive better and more certain&nbsp;information than we now possess. The prominent characteristic of the second group of religions, those of the&nbsp;Negroes proper, is their unlimited fetichism, combined as&nbsp;usual with tree worship, animal worship, especially that of&nbsp;serpents, with a strong belief in sorcery and with the&nbsp;most abject superstitions, which even Islam and Christianity are not able to overcome. They have next to no&nbsp;mythology, at all events a very poor one, which may be one&nbsp;of the causes of what is called euphemistically their tendency to monotheism. A theistic tendency, as Dr Tylor&nbsp;calls it, cannot be denied to them. Almost all tribes&nbsp;believe in some supreme god, without always worshipping&nbsp;him, generally a heaven- and rain-god, sometimes, as among&nbsp;the Cameroons and in Dahomey, a sun-god. But the most&nbsp;widely spread worship among Negroes and Negroids, from&nbsp;w<sup>r</sup>est to north-east and south to Loango, is that of the moon,&nbsp;combined with a great veneration for the cow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Among the Abantu or Kaffrarians (Ama-Kliosa, Ama-Zulu, Be-Chuana, Ova-Herero), which form the third group, fetichism is not so exuberant. Their religion is&nbsp;rather a religion of spirits. The spirits they worship,&nbsp;not sharply distinguished from the souls of the departed&nbsp;ancestors (Imi-shologu, Barimi), are conjured up by a&nbsp;caste of sorcerers and magicians, Isintonga (Isinyanga,&nbsp;Nyaka), and are all subordinate to a ruling spirit, regarded as the ancestor of the race, the highest lawgiver&nbsp;who taught them their religious rites, but who seems to&nbsp;have been originally a moon-god as the lord of heaven.&nbsp;The four tribes give him different names—the Ghost (Mu-kuro), the very High (Mo-limo), the Great-great (Unku-lunkulu) or grandfather; but that the Bantu religions are&nbsp;four branches of one and the same faith cannot be doubted.&nbsp;They agree in many respects with those of the Negroes,&nbsp;but differ from them in others, especially in the cardinal&nbsp;characteristic of the latter, their fetichism. Possibly the&nbsp;difference is for the greater part due to the influence of&nbsp;the Hottentots, to whom the country now inhabited by&nbsp;the Abantu formerly belonged, and who seem to have been&nbsp;at the time of the invasion more civilized than the latter.</span></p>
