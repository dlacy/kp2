<p><span class="font1">battles of Brienne and Arcis sur Aube. He entered Paris with the allied sovereigns in March 1814, and returned with them to&nbsp;the congress of Vienna, where he appears to have acted as an&nbsp;intermediary between Metternich and the czar Alexander, when&nbsp;these great personages were not on speaking terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the succeeding years of peace he disappeared from the public view. He resumed his functions as chief of the staff, but&nbsp;his ardent ideas for reforming the army came to nothing in the&nbsp;face of the general war-weariness and desire to “ let well alone. ”&nbsp;His zeal added to the number of his enemies, and in 1829, after&nbsp;he had been for twenty years a lieutenant field marshal, it was&nbsp;proposed to place him on the retired list. The emperor, un-willing to go so far as this, promoted him general of cavalry and&nbsp;shelved him by making him governor of a fortress. But very&nbsp;soon afterwards the Restoration settlement of Europe was shaken&nbsp;by fresh upheavals, and Radetzky was brought into the field&nbsp;of war again. He took part under Frimont in the campaign&nbsp;against the Papal States insurgents, and succeeded that general&nbsp;in the chief command of the Austrian army in Italy in 1834.&nbsp;In 1836 he became a field marshal. He was now seventy years&nbsp;of age, but he displayed the activity of youth in training and&nbsp;disciplining the army he commanded. But here too he was in&nbsp;advance of his time, and the government not only disregarded&nbsp;his suggestions and warnings but also refused the money that&nbsp;would have enabled the finest army it possessed to take the field&nbsp;at a moment’s notice. Thus the events of 1848 in Italy, which&nbsp;gave the old field marshal his place in history among the great&nbsp;commanders, found him, in the beginning, not indeed unprepared but seriously handicapped in the struggle with Charles&nbsp;Albert’s army and the insurgents. How by falling back to the&nbsp;Quadrilateral and there, checking one opponent after another,&nbsp;he was able to spin out time until reinforcements arrived, and&nbsp;how thenceforward up to the final triumph of Novara on the&nbsp;23rd of March 1849, he and his army carried all before them, is&nbsp;described in the article Italian Wars. The well-disciplined&nbsp;sense of duty to the superior officer, which was remarked even in&nbsp;the brilliant and sanguine young army reformer of 1810, had&nbsp;become more intense in the long years of peace, and after keeping&nbsp;his army loyal in the midst of the confusion of 1848, he made no&nbsp;attempt to play the part of Wallenstein or even to assume&nbsp;Wellington’s rôle of family adviser to the nation. While as a&nbsp;patriot he dreamed a little of a united Germany, he remained&nbsp;to the end simply the commander of one of the emperor’s armies.&nbsp;He died, still in harness, though infirm, on the 5th of January&nbsp;1858.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In military history Radetzky''s fame rests upon one great achievement, but in the history of the Austrian army he lives as&nbsp;the frank and kindly “ Vater Radetzky ” whom the soldiers&nbsp;idolized. He was fortunate in the moment of his death. In&nbsp;the year following, another and a greater Italian war broke out,&nbsp;his beloved army, disintegrated by peace economies which the&nbsp;old field marshal had been unable any longer to redress by&nbsp;ceaseless personal training, and in addition suffering from&nbsp;divided command and confused staff wbrk, was defeated in&nbsp;every encounter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RADEVORMWALD, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province, 10 m. E. from Remscheid, on the branch line&nbsp;of railway from Krebsöge. Pop. (1905) 10, 978. It consists of&nbsp;the town proper and of several suburbs, and has five Evangelical&nbsp;and two Roman Catholic churches. Its chief manufactures&nbsp;arc skates, files, locks and similar articles, and it has also cloth&nbsp;and cotton factories.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RADHANPUR, a native state of India, in the Palanpur agency, Bombay. It is situated in the north-western corner&nbsp;of Gujarat, close to the Runn of Cutch. The country is an open&nbsp;plain without hills and with few trees. It contains an area of&nbsp;1150 sq. m. with a population in 1901 of 61, 548, showing a&nbsp;decrease of 37% during the decade, due to the results of famine.&nbsp;The estimated revenue is £27, 000. The chief products are cotton,&nbsp;wheat and the common varieties of grain; the only manufacture&nbsp;of any importance is the preparation of a fine description of&nbsp;saltpetre. Radhanpur first came under British protection in&nbsp;1813. The chief, whose title is Nawab, belongs to the Babi&nbsp;family, who have held power in Gujarat for more than two&nbsp;centuries. The town of Radhanpur had a population in 1901&nbsp;of 11, 879. It is a walled town, with an export trade in rapeseed, grain and cotton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RADIATA, a term introduced by Cuvier in 1812 to denote the lowest of his four great animal groups or “ embranchements. ” He defined them as possessing radial instead of&nbsp;bilateral symmetry, and as apparently destitute of nervous&nbsp;system and sense organs, as having the circulatory system&nbsp;rudimentary or absent, and the respiratory organs on or coextensive with the surface of the body; he included under&nbsp;this title anil definition five classes, —Echinodermata, Acalepha,&nbsp;Entozoa, Polypi and Infusoria. Lamarck (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hist. nat. d. Anim.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">s. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vertèbres)</span><span class="font1"> also used the term, as when he spoke of the&nbsp;Medusae as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">radiata medusaria et anomala;</span><span class="font1"> but he preferred&nbsp;the term Radiaria, under which he included Echinodermata and&nbsp;Medusae. Cuvier’s term in its wide extension, however, passed&nbsp;into general use; but, as the anatomy of the different forms&nbsp;became more fully known, the difficulty of including them&nbsp;under the common designation made itself increasingly obvious.&nbsp;Milne-Edwards removed the Polyzoa; the group was soon&nbsp;further thinned by the exclusion of the Protozoa on the one&nbsp;hand and the Entozoa on the other; while in 1848 Leuckart&nbsp;and Frey clearly distinguished the Coelenterata from the&nbsp;Echinodermata as a separate sub-kingdom, thus condemning&nbsp;the usage by which the term still continued to be applied to&nbsp;these two groups at least. In 1855, however, Owen included&nbsp;under Lamarck’s term Radiaria the Echinodermata, Anthozoa,&nbsp;Acalepha and Hydrozoa, while Agassiz also clung to the term&nbsp;Radiata as including Echinodermata, Acalepha and Polypi,&nbsp;regarding their separation into Coelenterata and Echinodermata&nbsp;as “an exaggeration of their anatomical differences ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Essay on&nbsp;Classification,</span><span class="font1"> London, 1859). These attempts, however, to&nbsp;perpetuate the usage were finally discredited by Huxley’s&nbsp;important </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on Comparative Anatomy</span><span class="font1"> (1864), in which&nbsp;the term was finally abolished, and the “ radiate mob ” finally&nbsp;distributed among the Echinodermata, Polyzoa, Vermes&nbsp;(Platyhelminthes), Coelenterata and Protozoa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RADIATION, THEORY OF. The physical activities that flourish on the surface of the earth derive their energy, in&nbsp;a form which is highly available thermodynamically, from&nbsp;the radiation of the sun. This has been ascertained to be&nbsp;dynamic energy, transmitted in waves by the vibrations of a&nbsp;medium occupying space, as the energy of sound is transmitted&nbsp;by the vibrations of the atmosphere. The elasticity that&nbsp;transmits it may be assumed to be mathematically perfect:&nbsp;any slight loss in transit of the light from the most distant&nbsp;stars, which recent statistical comparisons of brightness with&nbsp;distance may possibly indicate, is to be explained far more&nbsp;suitably by the presence of nebulous matter than by any&nbsp;imperfection of the aether. The latter would thus be the&nbsp;one perfect frictionless medium known to us: it could not&nbsp;be such if it were constituted, like matter, of independent&nbsp;molecules. It is thus on a higher plane, and may even be&nbsp;considered to be a dynamical specification of space itself. A&nbsp;molecule of matter is a kinetic system compounded of simpler&nbsp;dements; its energy may be classified into constitutive energy&nbsp;essential to its continued existence, and vibratory energy&nbsp;which it can receive from or radiate away into aether. A&nbsp;piece of matter isolated in free aether would in time lose all&nbsp;energy of the latter type by radiation; but the former will&nbsp;remain so long as the matter persists, along with the energy&nbsp;of the uniform translatory motion to which it is ultimately&nbsp;reduced. Thus all matter is in continual exchange of vibratory&nbsp;energy with the aether: it is with the laws of this exchange&nbsp;of energy that the general theory of Radiation deals, as distinguished from the mechanism of the aethereal vibrations, which is usually treated as the Theory of Light (sec Aether).</span></p>
