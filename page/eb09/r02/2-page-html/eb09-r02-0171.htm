<p><span class="font1">looked at in a dusky half-light. Adam and Eve, the Visitation, the Adoration of the Magi, the Massacre of&nbsp;the Innocents, the Agony in the Garden, Christ before&nbsp;Pilate, Christ carrying His Cross, and (this alone having&nbsp;been marred by restoration) the Assumption of the Virgin&nbsp;are leading examples in the scuola ; in the church, Christ&nbsp;curing the Paralytic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It was probably in 1560, the same year when he began working in the Scuola di S. Rocco, that Tintoret commenced&nbsp;also his numerous paintings in the ducal palace ; he then&nbsp;executed there a portrait of the doge, Girolamo Priuli.&nbsp;Other works which were destroyed in the great fire of&nbsp;1577 succeeded,—the Excommunication of Frederick Barbarossa by Pope Alexander III. and the Victory of&nbsp;Lepanto. After the fire Tintoret started afresh, Paul&nbsp;Veronese being his colleague ; their works have for the&nbsp;most part been disastrously and disgracefully retouched&nbsp;of late years, and some of the finest monuments of pictorial power ever produced are thus degraded to comparative unimportance. In the Saia dello Scrutinio&nbsp;Robusti painted the Capture of Zara from the Hungarians&nbsp;in 1346 amid a hurricane of missiles; in the hall of the&nbsp;senate, Venice, Queen of the Sea ; in the hall of the college,&nbsp;the Espousal of St Catherine to Jesus ; in the Saia delΓ&nbsp;Anticollegio, four extraordinary masterpieces—Bacchus,&nbsp;with Ariadne crowned by Venus, the Three Graces and&nbsp;Mercury, Minerva discarding Mars, and the Forge of&nbsp;Vulcan—which were painted for fifty ducats each, besides&nbsp;materials, towards 1578; in the Antichiesetta, St George&nbsp;and St Nicholas, with St Margaret (the female figure is&nbsp;sometimes termed the princess whom St George rescued&nbsp;from the dragon), and St Jerome and St Andrew ; in the&nbsp;hall of the great council, nine large compositions, chiefly&nbsp;battle-pieces. We here reach the crowning production of&nbsp;Robusti’s life, the last picture of any considerable importance which he executed, the vast Paradise, in size 74 feet&nbsp;by 30, reputed to be the largest painting ever done upon&nbsp;canvas. It is a work so stupendous in scale, so colossal&nbsp;in the sweep of its power, so reckless of ordinary standards&nbsp;of conception or method, so pure an inspiration of a soul&nbsp;burning with passionate visual imagining, and a hand&nbsp;magical to work in shape and colour, that it has defied&nbsp;the connoisseurship of three centuries, and has generally&nbsp;(though not with its first Venetian contemporaries) passed&nbsp;for an eccentric failure ; while to a few eyes (including&nbsp;those of the present writer) it seems to be so transcendent&nbsp;a monument of human faculty applied to the art pictorial&nbsp;as not to be viewed without awe nor thought of without&nbsp;amazement. While the commission for this huge work&nbsp;was yet pending and unassigned Robusti was wont to tell&nbsp;the senators that he had prayed to God that he might be&nbsp;commissioned for it, so that paradise itself might perchance&nbsp;be his recompense after death. Upon eventually receiving&nbsp;the commission in 1588 he set up his canvas in the Scuola&nbsp;della Misericordia and worked indefatigably at the task,&nbsp;making many alterations and doing various heads and&nbsp;costumes direct from nature. When the picture had been&nbsp;brought well forward he took it to its proper place and&nbsp;there finished it, assisted by his son Domenico for details&nbsp;of drapery, &lt;fec. All Venice applauded the superb achievement, which has in more recent times suffered from&nbsp;neglect, but fortunately hardly at all from restoration.&nbsp;Robusti was asked to name his own price, but this he left&nbsp;to the authorities. They tendered a handsome amount ;&nbsp;Robusti is said to have abated something from it, which&nbsp;is even a more curious instance of ungreediness for pelf&nbsp;than earlier cases which we have cited where he worked&nbsp;for nothing at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the completion of the Paradise Robusti rested for a while, and he never undertook any other work of&nbsp;importance, though there is no reason to suppose that his&nbsp;energies were exhausted, had his days been a little prolonged. He was seized with an attack in the stomach,&nbsp;complicated with fever, which prevented him from sleeping&nbsp;and almost from eating for a fortnight, and on 3lst May&nbsp;1594 he died. A contemporary record states his age to&nbsp;have been seventy-five years and fifteen days. If this is&nbsp;accurate, 16th May 1519 must have been the day of his&nbsp;birth ; but we prefer the authority of the register of deaths&nbsp;in S. Marciliano, which states that Tintoret died of fever,&nbsp;aged seventy-five years, eight months, and fifteen days,—&nbsp;thus bringing us to l6th September 1518 as the true date&nbsp;of his birth. He was buried in the church of S. Maria&nbsp;dell’ Orto by the side of his favourite daughter Marietta,&nbsp;who had died in 1590, aged thirty; there is a well-known&nbsp;tradition that as she lay dead the heart-stricken father&nbsp;painted her portrait. Marietta had herself been a portrait-painter of considerable skill, as well as a musician,&nbsp;vocal and instrumental ; but few of her works are now&nbsp;traceable. It is said that up to the age of fifteen she&nbsp;used to accompany and assist her father at his work,&nbsp;dressed as a boy ; eventually she married a jeweller, Mario&nbsp;Augusta. In 1866 the grave of the Vescovi and Robusti&nbsp;was opened, and the remains of nine members of the joint&nbsp;families were found in it ; a different locality, the chapel&nbsp;on the right of the choir, was then assigned to the grave.&nbsp;Tintoret painted his own portrait at least twice, one of&nbsp;the heads being in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence and the&nbsp;other, done when his age was advanced, in the Louvre.&nbsp;It is a very serious face, somewhat blunt and rugged, but&nbsp;yet refined without the varnish of elegance—concentrated&nbsp;and resolute, its native ardours of frankness and energy&nbsp;welded down into lifelong laboriousness, with a pent look&nbsp;as of smouldering fire. The eyes are large, dark, and&nbsp;round ; the grizzled hair close and compact. The face&nbsp;has been held to bear some resemblance to that of Michelangelo, but this does not go very far. Robusti appears&nbsp;also as one of the figures in the two vast pictures by Paul&nbsp;Veronese,—the Marriage in Cana and the Feast in the&nbsp;House of Levi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Audacious and intrepid, though not constantly correct, as a draughtsman, majestically great as a colourist, prodigious as an&nbsp;executant, Tintoret was as absolute a type of the born painter as&nbsp;the history of art registers or enables us to conceive. Whatever&nbsp;he did was imaginative—sometimes beautiful and suave (and he&nbsp;was eminently capable of painting a lovely female countenance or&nbsp;an heroic man), often imposing and romantic, fully as often turbulent and reckless, sometimes trivial, never unpainter-like or&nbsp;prosaic. When he chose—which was not always—he painted his&nbsp;entire personages characteristically ; but, like the other highest&nbsp;masters of Venice, he conceded and attended little to the expression&nbsp;of his faces as evincing incidental emotion. In several of his works&nbsp;—as especially the great Crucifixion in S. Rocco—there is powerful&nbsp;central thought, as well as inventive detail ; but his imagination&nbsp;is always concrete : it is essentially that of a painter to whom the&nbsp;means of art—the form, colour, chiaroscuro, manipulation, scale,&nbsp;distribution—are the typical and necessitated, realities. What he&nbsp;imagines is always a visual integer, a picture—never a treatise,&nbsp;however thoughtfully planned or ingeniously detailed. Something&nbsp;that one could see—that is his ideal, not something that one&nbsp;could narrate, still less that one could deduce and demonstrate.&nbsp;In his treatment of action or gesture the most constant peculiarity&nbsp;is the sway and swerve of his figures : they bend like saplings or&nbsp;rock like forest - boughs in a gale; stiffness or immobility was&nbsp;entirely foreign to his style, which has therefore little of the monumental or severe character. Perhaps he felt that there was no&nbsp;other way for combining “ the colour of Titian with the design of&nbsp;Michelangelo.” The knitted strength and the transcendent fervour&nbsp;of energy of the supreme Florentine might to some extent bo&nbsp;emulated ; but, if they were to be united with the glowing fusion&nbsp;of hue of the supreme Venetian, this could only be attained by a&nbsp;process of relaxing the excessive tension and modifying muscular&nbsp;into elastic force. In this respect he was a decided innovator ;&nbsp;but he had many imitators,—comparatively feeble, if we except&nbsp;Paul Veronese.</span></p>
