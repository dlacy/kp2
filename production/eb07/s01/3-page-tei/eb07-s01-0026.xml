The establishment of the church, besides the bishop, comprises the dean, the precentor, the chancellor, three archdeacons, the sub-dean, the sub-chanter, and forty-five prebendaries (six of whom being residentiary, are called canons), four vicars, six singing men, eight choristers, and other inferior officers. The palace of the bishop and the houses of the several dignitaries surround the cathedral, in what is called the Close, being all encircled with an ancient and lofty wall.</p><p>The civil government of the city was in a body corporate, consisting of a mayor, high steward, recorder, deputy- recorder, and twenty-four aldermen ; but by the late law it has been divided into three wards, having six aldermen and eighteen councillors, who elect the mayor. It has also a recorder appointed by the crown. The city elects two members to the House of Commons, and gives the title of marquis to the family of Cecil. Salisbury was formerly celebrated for its manufactories of cutlery, which have of late years declined, in consequence of the powerful competition of Sheffield and Birmingham ; but still some of the best knives, scissors, and razors are made there, and some of the most beautiful and costly ornaments in steel. There was till recently a considerable trade in making flannels, especially one kind, almost wholly appropriated to the market of Spain, from whence the goods were despatched to Buenos Ayres and other parts of South America.</p><p>Salisbury being on the high road to Exeter and to Plymouth, is a great thoroughfare, and well provided with good inns, carriages, and horses. It is well supplied with provisions at moderate prices, and has good markets, which are held on Tuesdays and Fridays. It has a great number of charitable establishments, both for the purposes of education and for the solace of old age, or of infirmities of body or mind. It contains three parish churches, and an appropriate number of places of worship for the various sects of dissenters. It is eighty-one miles from London, and ninety from Exeter. The population appears at the decennial enumerations to have amounted in 1801 to 7668, in 1811 to 8243, in 1821 to 8763, and in 1831 to 9876.</p><p>SALIVA is that fluid by which the mouth and tongue are continually moistened in their natural state, and is supplied by glands which form it, and are called salivary glands.</p><p>SALIVATION, in <hi rend="italic">Medicine,</hi> a promoting of the flux of saliva by means of medicines, chiefly by mercury.</p><p>SALIX, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Willow.</hi> Willow trees have been frequently the theme of poetical description, both in ancient and modern times. In Virgil, in Horace, and in Ovid, we have many exquisite allusions to them and their several properties. The <hi rend="italic">Babylonica,</hi> Babylonian pendulous salix, commonly called weeping willow, grows to a large size, having numerous long, slender, pendulous branches, hanging down loosely all round in a curious manner, and long, narrow, spear-shaped, serrated, smooth leaves. This curious willow is a native of the East, and is retained in our hardy plantations for ornament ; it exhibits a most agreeable variety, particularly when disposed singly by the verges of any piece of water, or in spacious openings of grass ground. All the species of salix are of the tree kind, very hardy, remarkably fast growers, and several of them attaining a considerable stature when permitted to run up to standards. They are mostly of the aquatic tribe, being generally the most abundant and of most prosperous growth in watery situations. They, however, will grow freely almost anywhere, in any common soil and exposure ; but they spring considerably faster and stronger in low moist land, particularly</p><p>in marshy situations, by the verges of rivers, brooks, and other waters, which places often lying waste, may be employed to good advantage in plantations of willows for different purposes.</p><p>SALLAWATTV, one of the Papuan or Oriental Negro Isles, separated from the island of Papua or New Guinea by a narrow strait. It is thirty miles in length by twenty- five in average breadth, and produces abundance of sago of an excellent quality. It is situated about the 13lst degree of east longitude.</p><p>SALLEE, an ancient and considerable town of Africa, in the kingdom of Fez, with a harbour and several forts ; but the river, which formerly admittcd large vessels, is now- choked up with sand. It was formerly the stronghold of Moorish piracy, from which great depredations were committed upon Europeans ; and there may still be seen an immense and dreary dungeon formed under ground for the detention of the unfortunate captives. On the opposite side of the river stands Rabat, or New Sallee, which is chiefly frequented by Europeans, and where they once possessed numerous factories ; but the trade is now nearly annihilated.

It is chiefly inhabited by Russians, who carry on here an extensive fishery of sturgeon, which abounds in the neighbouring seas. It is ninety miles south of Schamachi.</p><p>SALLO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Denis De,</hi> a French writer, famous for being the projector of a certain class of literary journals, was born at Paris in 1626. He studied the law, and was admitted a counsellor in the parliament of Paris in 1652. It was in 1664 that he formed the plan of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des Savans ; </hi>and the year following he began to publish it under the name of Sieur de Héronville, which was that of his valet de chambre. But he played the critic so severely, that authors, surprised at the novelty of such attacks, retorted so powerfully, that M. de Sallo, unable to weather the storm, after he had published his third journal, declined the undertaking, which he handed over to the Abbé Gallois, who, without presuming to criticise, contented himself merely with giving titles and making extracts. M. de Sallo died in 1669.</p><p>SALLUNA, a town of Northern Hindustan, tributary to the Ghoorkhali rajah of Nepaul. Long. 81. 37. E. Lat. 29. 2. N.</p><p>SALLUSTIUS, C. <hi rend="smallcaps">Crispus,</hi> a celebrated Latin historian, was born of a plebeian family of Amiternum, a city of the Sabines, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 86, the same year that Marius died. We can have no doubt that the cultivation of his mental powers must have been carefully attended to, though this does not seem to have prevented him from falling into all the extravagances and dissipation of a profligate age. His intrigue with Fausta, daughter of Sulla, and wife of Milo, became known to her husband, and was punished in a way which made the two parties irreconcileable enemies. Sallust became quaestor at the age of twenty-seven, and tribune of the people in the year <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 52. His profligacy, however, became so notorious, that the censors, Appius Claudius and L. Piso, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 50, found it necessary to remove him from the senate, though his removal has been ascribed by others to political reasons, as he was a warm supporter of Cæsar. It is supposed that he at this time wrote his account of the conspiracy of Catiline. His absence from public affairs continued only for a short time, as we find him prætor, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 47, when</p></body></text></TEI>
