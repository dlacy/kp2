<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">north of Ireland. The gradients are very heavy, having a slope of 1 in 35 at many parts. The curves are very quick, following&nbsp;the line of the road. The conductor employed consists of a third&nbsp;rail, weighing 19 lb to the yard, and laid close to the fence. Electricity is transmitted through the conductor, by means of steel&nbsp;brushes, to the Siemens motors by which the car is propelled. The&nbsp;dynamo-machines by which the electricity' is generated are driven&nbsp;by the power of a natural waterfall of 26 feet in the river Bush.&nbsp;Two turbines are driven by the fall of water at a speed of 225 revolutions per minute ; each is capable of yielding 50 liorse-power. The&nbsp;electric car can run on the level at the rate of 12 miles per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Several large metropolitan and other stations are lighted by electricity. At the Waterloo station of the London and South-Western Railway, for example, the new main line suburban passenger station, about If acres in area, has been lighted by the&nbsp;Anglo-American Brush Light system since February 1881, sixteen&nbsp;arc - lamps of 2000 candle - power each being employed. The&nbsp;Windsor line station at the same terminus, about H acres in area,&nbsp;has been lighted by the Edison Company’s system since January&nbsp;1S83 with 200 glow-lamps of 16 candle-power each. The large&nbsp;goods-yard on the same railway, about 18 acres in extent, at Nine&nbsp;Elms, has been lighted since January 1883 by fourteen arc-lamps of&nbsp;4000 candle-power each. The lighting of railway trains by electricity' has been successfully effected on the Great Eastern Railway&nbsp;since October 1884. The power is derived from a dynamo-machine&nbsp;driven by' a compact rotary' engine, placed together in a small case&nbsp;on the top of the locomotive, and worked by steam from the boiler.&nbsp;Sixty electric lights are generated, each of them sufficient to light&nbsp;thoroughly' a compartment of a carriage, and supply light for a&nbsp;train of at least twelve vehicles. Trains on other lines also are&nbsp;lighted by electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Accidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Accidents on railways arise from three causes,—inattention of servants, defective material either in the works or the rolling stock,&nbsp;and excessive sped. But the adoption of the absolute block system,&nbsp;with the use of interlocked points and signals and continuous brakes,&nbsp;has led to an absolute diminution of the number of accidents,&nbsp;whilst the amount of traffic has been greatly increased. In 1883&nbsp;the total number of train accidents on railways in the United&nbsp;Kingdom, reported on to the Board of Trade, was 94 on 18,681&nbsp;miles open, against 241 accidents ten years earlier on 16,082 miles&nbsp;open. The increased efficiency of management is strikingly brought&nbsp;out by Table XXXII.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">During the period 1873-1883 there was therefore a material improvement not only' in the character of the way and works but&nbsp;also in that of the rolling stock. Accidents from entering stations&nbsp;at too great a speed have been augmented in number,—a result&nbsp;naturally arising from the greater speeds and volumes of traffic.&nbsp;Ten of these (for 1873 and 1883) were due to want of control of the&nbsp;trains, and seven others to want of continuous brakes. Collisions&nbsp;have been diminished to a marked extent; and nearly all of those&nbsp;in 1883 took place at junctions, stations, and sidings, mostly within&nbsp;fixed signals. Many of these collisions could have been obviated&nbsp;if proper interlocking and block working had been in use, together&nbsp;with continuous brakes on the trains. Of the 94 investigated&nbsp;train accidents 75 took place on the lines of fifteen companies,&nbsp;working in the aggregate 12,850 miles, and having run upwards of&nbsp;216 millions of miles with trains,—showing that one accident&nbsp;happened for every 171 miles of railway, or for every 3 millions&nbsp;nearly of miles run. One person in every 625 employed in the&nbsp;traffic—locomotive, carnage, engineers’, and stores departments—&nbsp;in 1883 was killed in the sendee. The employes who stand at&nbsp;the extremes of the scale of fatality are guards : of brakesmen and&nbsp;goods-guards 1 in 97 lost their lives, and of passenger-guards only&nbsp;1 in 5902. Pointsmen and signalmen occupy a medium position&nbsp;in the scale, 1 in 800 losing their lives ; of engine-drivers 1 in 643&nbsp;was killed, and of firemen 1 in 533. Of persons other than pass</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">engers or servants of railway companies who suffered in accidents, trespassers, including suicides, as usual form the largest number,&nbsp;—354 killed and 165 injured. Of passengers 125 were killed and&nbsp;1416 were injured—together, 1541 persons, or 1 in about 444,000&nbsp;of the total number of passengers in 18S3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Railway Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Parliament soon began to exercise control over railways by' means ’ of standing orders; and in 1832 a passenger duty of |d. per mile 1&nbsp;for every' four passengers carried was levied on railway companies. !&nbsp;In 1842 a Government department was instituted whereby the&nbsp;Board of Trade was empowered to appoint inspectors of railways,&nbsp;to postpone the opening of railway's, to disallow by<sup>r</sup>e-laws, and to&nbsp;institute legal proceedings against companies for infringing the law.&nbsp;The Board of Trade was further empowered to direct companies&nbsp;to make returns of accidents, of traffic, and of tolls levied. The&nbsp;passenger duty was fixed at 5 per cent, of the gross receipts from&nbsp;passengers. In 1846 the Commissioners of Railways, five in number,&nbsp;were appointed, to whom the jurisdiction of the Board of Trade&nbsp;was transferred, but in 1851 it was re-transferred to the Board of&nbsp;Trade. The Railway and Canal Traffic Act, 1854, requires railway&nbsp;companies to provide “ reasonable facilities ” for receiving, forwarding, and delivering their own traffic and the traffic of other companies, and to abstain from “ unreasonable ” preference. It appears&nbsp;to have been of small practical utility until 1873. The Regulation&nbsp;of Railway's Act, 1873, establishes a new tribunal, “The Railway&nbsp;Commissioners,” not more than three in number, one to be of experience in the law and one of experience in railway business. The&nbsp;principal duty of the commissioners is to enforce the observance&nbsp;of the “reasonable facilities ” section of the Act of 1854. The commissioners have power to enjoin the forwarding of through traffic&nbsp;at through rates, the power being set in motion by the companies&nbsp;only. The commissioners are empowered whenever there is a dispute between two companies that can be referred to arbitration to&nbsp;decide such dispute. The Employers’ Liability Act, 1880, provides&nbsp;that where personal injury is caused to a workman by' reason of the&nbsp;negligence of any' person in the service of the employer, who has the&nbsp;charge or control of any signal, points, locomotive engine, or train&nbsp;upon a railway', he or his representatives shall have the same right&nbsp;of compensation or remedy against the employer as if the workman&nbsp;had not been in the service of the employer nor engaged in his&nbsp;work. The amount of compensation is not to exceed three years’&nbsp;earnings of the workman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(D. K. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Foreign and Continental.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Europe</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">.—A few unimportant tramways were opened in France in 1826-32. In 1833 the Government began a comprehensive system&nbsp;of surveys, and laid down the general plan of railway' development&nbsp;for the whole country; and in 1842 Thiers devised a scheme by'&nbsp;which the state was to furnish half the cost (about £10,000 per&nbsp;mile), while private companies were to lay the lines at their own&nbsp;expense and equip and work them for a term of years. In 1857 six&nbsp;great companies were working their lines with profit; but the state&nbsp;found it necessary (1859) to guarantee them the interest on the&nbsp;additional lines which were needed. By subsequent legislation the&nbsp;construction of local railways on a cheaper scale was encouraged,&nbsp;and in 1875-76 unsuccessful efforts were made by speculators to&nbsp;unite these local lines into systems which should compete with the&nbsp;old companies and break their monopoly<sup>7</sup>. Since that date some&nbsp;have been absorbed by<sup>7</sup> the great companies ; others have passed&nbsp;into the hands of the state. After more than one scheme for a&nbsp;comprehensive system of state railways had been formed by leading&nbsp;statesmen and then for one reason or another abandoned, in 1884&nbsp;agreements were made by<sup>7</sup> which some 7000 miles of railway were&nbsp;to be constructed in addition to the 17,000 miles then in operation,&nbsp;the money to be supplied by the six great companies and ultimately&nbsp;repaid by the state, which meanwhile guaranteed the shareholders&nbsp;of each company<sup>7</sup> a dividend equal to the average of recent years (in&nbsp;no case so low as 7 per cent.). The profitable system of monopoly&nbsp;has not been favourable to the development of enterprise in railway&nbsp;management in France. Scarcely any<sup>7</sup> of the so-called express&nbsp;trains run at as high a speed as 40 miles an hour. The time&nbsp;allowed for the despatch of goods is very long. The average rates&nbsp;(078־d. per passenger-mile, 082׳d. per ton-mile) are somewhat higher&nbsp;than those of Germany<sup>7</sup>. The long-distance traffic especially has&nbsp;received but little encouragement. On the other hand, many of&nbsp;the technical arrangements of the French lines are excellent.&nbsp;Although the state owns so few railroads, it has reserved extensive&nbsp;rights of regulation, both in matters of business and in engineering ;&nbsp;there is a body of Government engineers organized with almost&nbsp;military precision.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Soon after 1830 plans were laid for a Belgian system to be owned and managed by the state, and work was actively begun in 1833.&nbsp;The Government lines were arranged in the form of a cross, the&nbsp;point of intersection being at Malines. By this means the Government was able to develop the traffic of Belgium itself, and at the&nbsp;same time to secure a large share of the transit trade between Ger-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
