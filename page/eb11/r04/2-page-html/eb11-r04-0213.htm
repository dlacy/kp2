<p><span class="font2">and desolate spots, beaches, mountains, caverns, verdure-clad recesses. Hence he became in process of time the initiator of&nbsp;romantic landscape, with a special turn for scenes of strange or&nbsp;picturesque aspect—often turbulent and rugged, at times grand,&nbsp;and with suggestions of the sublime. He picked up scanty&nbsp;doles when he could get them, and his early landscapes sold&nbsp;for a few pence to petty dealers. The first person to discover&nbsp;that Rosa’s work was not as trumpery as it was cheap was the&nbsp;painter Lanfranco, who bought some of the paintings, and&nbsp;advised the youth to go to Rome. Hither in 1635, at the age&nbsp;of twenty, Rosa betook himself; he studied with enthusiasm,&nbsp;but, catching fever, he returned to Naples and Falcone, and for&nbsp;a while painted nothing but battlepieces, and these without&nbsp;exciting any attention. This class of work was succeeded by&nbsp;the landscape art peculiarly characteristic of him—wild scenes&nbsp;wildly peopled with shepherds, seamen or especially soldiers.&nbsp;He then revisited Rome, and was housed by Cardinal Bran-caccio; this prelate being made bishop of Viterbo, Rosa painted&nbsp;for the Chiesa della Morte a large and noticeable picture of the&nbsp;“ Incredulity of Thomas ”—the first work of sacred art which we&nbsp;find recorded from his hand. At Viterbo he made acquaintance&nbsp;with a mediocre poet named ‘Abati, and was hence incited to try&nbsp;his own faculty in verse. He then returned to Naples. Here&nbsp;the monopolizing triumvirate—Ribera, Caracciolo and Corenzio&nbsp;—were still powerful. Rosa was as yet too obscure to suffer from&nbsp;their machinations; but, having painted a picture of “ Tityus&nbsp;Torn by the Vulture,” which went to Rome and there produced&nbsp;a great sensation, he found it politic to follow in the footsteps&nbsp;of his fame, and once more, in 1638, resought the papal city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rosa was a man of facile and versatile genius, and had by this time several strings to his bow. It is said that, still keeping&nbsp;painting steadily in view as his real objective, he resolved to&nbsp;secure attention first as a musician, poet, improvisatore and&nbsp;actor—his mother-wit and broad Neapolitan dialect (which&nbsp;appears to have stuck to him through life) standing him powerfully in stead. In the carnival he masqued as Formica and&nbsp;Capitan Coviello, and bustled about Rome distributing satirical&nbsp;prescriptions for diseases of the body and more particularly&nbsp;of the mind. As Formica he inveighed against the farcical&nbsp;comedies acted in the Trastevere under the direction of the&nbsp;celebrated Bernini. Some of the actors, in one of their performances, retaliated by insulting Rosa, but the public was&nbsp;with him, and he now enjoyed every form of success—social&nbsp;prestige, abundant commissions and any amount of money,&nbsp;which he was wont to throw about broadcast to the populace.&nbsp;In 1646 he returned to Naples, and is said to have taken an&nbsp;active part in the insurrection of Masaniello; certain it is that&nbsp;he sympathized with and admired the fisherman autocrat, for a&nbsp;passage in one of his satires proves this. His actual share in the&nbsp;insurrection is, however, dubious; it appears only in recent&nbsp;narratives, and the same is the case with the well-known story&nbsp;that at one time he herded with a band of brigands in the&nbsp;Abruzzi—an incident which cannot be conveniently dove-tailed&nbsp;into any of the known dates of his career. As regards the&nbsp;popular revolt against Spanish tyranny, it is alleged that Rosa,&nbsp;along with other painters—Coppola, Porpora, Domenico Gar-giuolo, Dal Po, Masturzo, the two Vaccari and Cadogna—all&nbsp;under the captaincy of Aniello Falcone, formed the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Compagnia&nbsp;della Morte&gt;</span><span class="font2"> whose mission it was to hunt up Spaniards in the&nbsp;streets and despatch them, not sparing even those who had&nbsp;sought some place of religious asylum. He painted a portrait of&nbsp;Masaniello—probably from reminiscence rather than from life:&nbsp;indeed, it is said that he painted him several times over in less&nbsp;than life size. On the approach of Don John of Austria the&nbsp;blood-stained </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Compagnia</span><span class="font2"> dispersed, Rosa escaping or at any&nbsp;rate returning to Rome. Here he painted some important&nbsp;subjects, showing the uncommon bent of his mind as it passed&nbsp;from landscape into history—“ Democritus amid Tombs,” the&nbsp;“ Death of Socrates,” “ Regulus in the Spiked Cask ” (these two&nbsp;are now in England), “Justice Quitting the Earth,” and the&nbsp;“ Wheel of Fortune.” This last work, the tendency </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">which&nbsp;was bitingly satirical, raised a storm of ire and remonstrance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rosa, endeavouring at conciliation, published a description of its meaning (probably softened down not a little from the real&nbsp;facts); none the less an order for his imprisonment was issued,&nbsp;but ultimately withheld at the instance of some powerful friends.&nbsp;It was about this time that Rosa wrote his satire named </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Babylon,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">under which name Rome was of course indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Cardinal Giancarlo de’ Medici now invited the painter to leave Rome—which had indeed become too hot to hold him—&nbsp;for Florence. Salvator gladly assented, and remained in the&nbsp;Tuscan capital for the better part of nine years, introducing&nbsp;there the new style of landscape; he had no pupils, but various&nbsp;imitators. Lorenzo Lippi the painter poet, and other </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">beaux&nbsp;esprits</span><span class="font2"> shared with Rosa the hospitalities of the cardinal, and&nbsp;they formed an academy named </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I Percossi</span><span class="font2"> (the Stricken),&nbsp;indulging in a deal of ingenious jollity—Rosa being alike applauded as painter, poet and musician. His chief intimate at&nbsp;this time was Lippi, whom he encouraged to proceed with the&nbsp;poem </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">II Malmantile Racquistato.</span><span class="font2"> He was well acquainted&nbsp;also with Ugo and Giulio Maffei, and housed with them more&nbsp;than once in Volterra, where he wrote other four satires—&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Music, Poetry, Painting</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">War.</span><span class="font2"> About the same time he&nbsp;painted his own portrait, now in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence.&nbsp;Finally he reverted once more to Rome, and hardly left that&nbsp;city again. Much enmity still brooded there against him, taking&nbsp;the form more especially of an allegation that the satires which&nbsp;he zealously read and diffused in MS. were not his own production, but filched from some one else. Rosa indignantly&nbsp;repelled this charge, which remains indeed quite unsubstantiated, although it is true that the satires deal so extensively&nbsp;and with such ready manipulation in classical names, allusions&nbsp;and anecdotes, that one is rather at a loss to fix upon the period&nbsp;of his busy career at which Rosa could possibly have imbued&nbsp;his mind with such a multitude of semi-erudite details. It&nbsp;may perhaps be legitimate to suppose that his literary friends in&nbsp;Florence and Volterra had coached him up to a large extent—&nbsp;the satires, as compositions, remaining none the less strictly&nbsp;and fully his own. To confute his detractors he now wrote the&nbsp;last of the series, entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Envy.</span><span class="font2"> Among the pictures of his&nbsp;closing years were the admired “ Battlepiece ” now in the&nbsp;Louvre, painted in the short space of forty days, full of long-drawn carnage, with ships burning in the offing; “ Pythagoras&nbsp;and the Fishermen;” the “Oath of Catiline” (Pitti Gallery);&nbsp;and the very celebrated “ Saul and the Witch of Endor ”&nbsp;(Louvre), which is almost his latest work. He undertook a&nbsp;series of satirical portraits, to be closed by one of himself; but&nbsp;while occupied with this project he was assailed by dropsy,&nbsp;which, after lasting fully half a year, brought his life to a close&nbsp;on the 15th of March 1673. In his last moments he married a&nbsp;Florentine named Lucrezia, who kept his house and had borne&nbsp;him two sons, one of them surviving him, and he died in a contrite frame of mind. He lies buried in the Chiesa degli Angeli,&nbsp;where a portrait of him has been set up. Salvator Rosa, after&nbsp;the hard struggles of his early youth, had always been a successful man, and he left a handsome fortune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rosa was indisputably a great leader in that modern tendency of fine art towards the romantic and picturesque which, developing&nbsp;in various directions and by diversified processes, has at last almost&nbsp;totally differentiated modern from olden art. He saw appearances&nbsp;with a new eye, and presented new images of them on his canvases,&nbsp;and deserves therefore all the credit due to a vigorous innovator,&nbsp;even if we contest the absolute value of his product. He himself&nbsp;courted reputation for his historical works, laying comparatively&nbsp;little stress on his. landscapes; in portraits he was forcible. In&nbsp;chiaroscuro he is simple and effective; his design has energy and&nbsp;a certain grandeur, without any high type of form or any superior&nbsp;measure of correctness. His colour is too constantly </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">a sandy or&nbsp;yellowish-grey tone. Personally he was a man of high spirit, and he&nbsp;sold his pictures at large prices, more (it is said) to assert the honour&nbsp;of his art than from love of money; rather than sell them cheap he&nbsp;destroyed them. In his later Florentine period he etched several&nbsp;of his works, subjects of mythology, soldiering, &amp;c. He was choleric,&nbsp;but kind and generous. Though a man of gaiety and pleasure, and&nbsp;a jovial boon companion, he does not appear to have been vicious&nbsp;in any serious degree. He was.talkative, very sharp-tongued and&nbsp;an unblushing encomiast of his own performances.
