The&nbsp;marker’s decision is final; but “ if in doubt which way to&nbsp;decide, the marker may direct that the ace be played over again. ”&nbsp;It is the duty of the marker, who occupies a box in the gallery,&nbsp;to “ call the game. ” As soon as the server serves the ball the&nbsp;marker calls “Play! ” if the ball strikes the front wall above&nbsp;the service-line; and “Cut! ” if it strikes below the service-line; if the ball falls in front of the short-line the marker&nbsp;calls “Short! ’’; if the wrong side of the fault-line he calls&nbsp;“Fault! ’’; but whether it be “cut, ” “short, ” or “fault, ”&nbsp;the serve counts as a fault in its effect. To every good return,&nbsp;as to every good serve, the marker calls “Play! ” If a return&nbsp;is made after the second bound of the ball (called a “double”)&nbsp;the marker calls “Double! ” or “Not up! ”; if the ball is hit&nbsp;into the gallery, or against its posts or cushions, or above&nbsp;the girders or cross-beams of the roof, he calls “Out-of-court! ”&nbsp;At the end of every rally he calls the state of the game, always&nbsp;naming first the score of hand-in: —“One-love” (love being&nbsp;the term for zero) meaning that hand-in has scored one ace&nbsp;and hand-out nothing, “Two-love, ” “Five-all, ” “Five-ten, ”&nbsp;“Fourteen-eleven, ” and so on, till one side has scored 15, when&nbsp;the marker calls “ Game! ” He then in similar fashion calls the&nbsp;state of the match—“Two games to one, ” or whatever it may&nbsp;be—before the commencement of the next game. The server&nbsp;in possession at the end of the game continues to serve in the&nbsp;new game, subject as before to the rule limiting the first innings&nbsp;of the game to a single “ hand. ” The usual number of games in&nbsp;matches is five for singles, and seven for doubles. In matches&nbsp;where there are umpires and a referee, there is an appeal to them&nbsp;from the marker’s decision except as regards questions relating&nbsp;to the service, on which the marker’s decision is final.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Records. </span><span class="font1">—Attempts have been made to trace racquets, like tennis, to an ancient origin; but although it is doubtless&nbsp;true that the striking of a ball with the hand or some primitive&nbsp;form of bat is one of the oldest forms of pastimes, and that&nbsp;racquets has been evolved from such an origin, the game as&nbsp;now known can hardly be said to have existed before the&nbsp;19th century. Joseph Strutt’s work on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Sports and Pastimes&nbsp;of the People of England,</span><span class="font1"> published at the beginning of the&nbsp;19th century, makes no mention of racquets; and the century&nbsp;was far advanced before the racquet court was promoted from&nbsp;being an adjunct of the pot-house and the gaol, in which con-nexion the court within the purlieus of the Fleet prison has&nbsp;been immortalized in the pages of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pickwick,</span><span class="font1"> to a position&nbsp;scarcely less dignified than that of the tennis-court with its&nbsp;royal and historical associations. It was at the public schools&nbsp;that racquets first obtained repute. The school courts were at&nbsp;first unroofed, and in some cases open also at the back and&nbsp;sides, or on one side. Among the most famous of the early&nbsp;racquets professionals, before the period of the modem closed&nbsp;court, were Robert Mackay (1820), the brothers Thomas and&nbsp;John Pittman, J. Lamb, J. C. Mitchell and Francis Erwood&nbsp;(r86o). One of the most famous matches ever played at&nbsp;racquets was that in which Erwood was beaten by Sir William&nbsp;Hart-Dyke, who used the “ drop ” stroke with telling effect,&nbsp;and who, after representing Oxford in the first four inter-university matches, was the only amateur racquet player&nbsp;who ever defeated the open champion. A notable date in&nbsp;the history of racquets was the year 1853, when the court&nbsp;at the old Prince’s Club in Hans Place, London, was built.&nbsp;Here the annual racquet matches between Oxford and Cam-bridge Universities, singles and doubles, were first played in&nbsp;1858, and the Public Schools Championship (doubles only)&nbsp;ten years later. Modern racquets may perhaps be said to date&nbsp;from the time of the brothers Gray, who as professionals greatly&nbsp;raised the standard of skill in the game, and as teachers at the&nbsp;schools and universities improved the play of amateurs. William&nbsp;Gray beat Foulkes, the champion of America, in 1867; Henry&nbsp;Gray and Joseph Gray were also great players. The latter&nbsp;was beaten in 1875 by H. B. Fairs (“ Punch ”) but held the&nbsp;championship from 1878 to 1887. Another member of the same&nbsp;family was Walter Gray, who was as distinguished for the&nbsp;power of his stroke as his brother William was for the accuracy&nbsp;of his “ drop ” and the ease and grace of his volley and half-volley. Waiter Gray was followed in the championship by&nbsp;Peter Latham, the first professional to combine the open Tennis&nbsp;Championship with the Racquets Championship; and in the&nbsp;opinion of Mr Eustace Miles “ there has probably lived no&nbsp;player who could have beaten him at either game. ” Latham&nbsp;was the first to use the heavily cut service at racquets, and he&nbsp;is also remarkable for the power of his wrist stroke. In the&nbsp;last twelve years or so of the 19th century Latham stood alone,&nbsp;and in the opinion of the best judges he was the greatest of all&nbsp;racquet players. When once he had won the championship he&nbsp;never lost it, and when at last he resigned his title he was suc-ceeded by Gilbert Browne, a player of a decidedly inferior&nbsp;calibre, who in 1903 was challenged and beaten by an Indian&nbsp;marker called Jamsetji. For the next six years, during which&nbsp;Jamsetji held the championship, comparatively little was&nbsp;heard of professional racquets; but in 1909 interest was revived&nbsp;by a handicap at Queen’s Club for a prize of £100, in which&nbsp;Peter Latham himself took part, and which was won by Jennings&nbsp;of Aldershot. As a result of this contest a challenge was issued&nbsp;by W. Hawes, the marker at Wellington College, to play any&nbsp;other professional for £200 a side and the championship of&nbsp;England. The challenge was accepted by C. Williams, a young&nbsp;player of Prince’s Club, who easily won the match, and with it&nbsp;the title of champion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The institution of annual matches between Oxford and Cambridge Universities in 1858, and of the Public Schools Championship in&nbsp;1868, gave an immense stimulus to the game among amateurs.&nbsp;Of the 51 inter-university (singles) matches from 1858 to&nbsp;1908, Oxford won 26 and Cambridge 25; of the 52 contests in&nbsp;doubles Oxford won 25 and Cambridge 27. Among the public&nbsp;schools Harrow has been far the most successful, having won the&nbsp;championship challenge cup 19 times out of 42 contests.&nbsp;Moreover, under the condition permitting any school winning it in&nbsp;three consecutive years to retain the challenge cup permanently,&nbsp;Harrow became possessed of three cups, having won the champion-ship 1871-1874 inclusive, 1879-1881 inclusive, and 1883-1887 inclusive. The next most successful school has been Eton, eight&nbsp;times champion; Charterhouse having won five times, and no&nbsp;other school more than three times. For the first twenty years&nbsp;of the contest, with a single exception when Rugby won in 1870,&nbsp;no school except Eton or Harrow gained the championship; and it&nbsp;is not surprising therefore that the majority of famous amateurs&nbsp;learnt the game at one or other of these schools. Among Etonians&nbsp;were W. Hart-Dyke, C. J. Ottaway, the Hon. Alfred Lyttelton,&nbsp;the Hon. Ivo Bligh (afterwards Lord Darnley), C. T. Studd and H.&nbsp;Philipson; Harrow has produced R. D. Walker, one of the best&nbsp;of the earliest amateur racquet players, C. F. Buller, T. S. Dury,&nbsp;A. J. Webbe, M. C. Kemp, E. M. Butler, the brothers Eustace&nbsp;Crawley and H. E. Crawley, C. D. Buxton, H. M. Leaf, Percy Ash-worth and C. Browning. The famous Malvern family of Foster&nbsp;has been as conspicuous in the racquet court as on the cricket field,&nbsp;the eldest, H. K. Foster, being probably the finest amateur player&nbsp;of his generation. F. Dames Longworth, Major A. Cooper-Key,&nbsp;Colonel Spens, E. M. Baerlein and Eustace H. Miles have also been&nbsp;in the front rank of amateur players. The opening of the Queen’s&nbsp;Club, West Kensington, was a notable event in the history of&nbsp;the game, especially as it was followed by the establishment of&nbsp;amateur championships in singles and doubles in 1888, of which the&nbsp;results have been as follows: —</span></p>
