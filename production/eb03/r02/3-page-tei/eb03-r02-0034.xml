The eaſtern branch runs to the ſhores of Korea and Kamt-ſchatka. The ſouthern branch traverſes Turkeſtan and Thibet, ſeparating them from India, and at the head of the kingdom of Ava joins an arm ſtretching from the great eaſtern branch, and here forms the centre of a very ſtngular radiation. Chains of mountains iſſue from it in every direction. Three or four of them keep very cloſe together, dividing the continent into narrow flips, which have each a great river flowing in the middle, and reaching to the extreme points of Malacca, Cambodia, and Cochin-china. From the ſame central point proceeds another great ridge due eaſt, and paſſes a little north of Canton in China. We called this a ſingular centre : for though it fends off ſo many branches, it is by no means the moſt elevated part of the continent. In the triangle which is included between the firſt ſouthern ridge (which comes from between the lakes Tanges andZaizan), the great eaſtern ridge, and its branch which almoſt unites with the ſouthern ridge, lies the Boutan, and part of Tibet, and the many little rivers which occupy its ſurface, flow ſouthward and eaſtward, uniting a little to the north of the centre often mentioned, and then paſs through a gorge eaſtward into China. And it is farther to be obſerved, that theſe great ridges do not appear to be ſeated on the higheſt parte of the country ; for the rivers which correſpond to them are at no great diſtance from them, and receive their chief ſupplies ſrom the other ſides. This is remarkably the caſe with the great Oby, which runs almoſt parallel to the ridge from the lakes to Nova Zem-bla. It receives its ſupplies from the eaſt, and indeed it has its ſource far eaſt. The higheſt grounds (if we except the ridges of mountains which are boundaries) of the continent ſeem to be in the country of the Cal-mucs, about 95<hi rend="sup">δ</hi> eaſt from London, and latitude 43° or 4f<hi rend="sup">0</hi> north. It is repreſented as a fine though ſandy country, having many little rivers which loſe themſelves in the fand, or end in little ſalt lakes. This elevation ſtretches north-eaſt to a great diſtance ; and in this track we find the heads of the Irtiſh, Selenga, and Tun-guikaia (the great feeders of the Oby), the Olenitz, the Lena, the Yana, and ſome other rivers which all go off to the north. On the other ſide we have the great river Amur, and many ſmaller rivers, whoſe names are not familiar. The Hoangho, the great river of China, riſes on the ſouth ſide of the great eaſtern ridge we have ſo often mentioned. This elevation, which is a continuation of the former, is ſomewhat of the ſame complexion, being very ſandy, and at preſent is a deſert of prodigious extent. It is deſcribed, however, as inter-ſperſed with vaſt tracks of rich paſture ; and we know that it was formerly the reſidence of a great nation, who came ſouth, by the name of<hi rend="italic">Turks,</hi>  and poſſeſſed themſelves of moſt of the richeſt kingdoms of Aſia. In tire ſouth-weſtern extremity of this country are found remains not only of barbaric magnificence, but even of cultivation and elegance. It was a profitable privilege granted by Peter the Great to ſome adventurers to ſearch theſe ſandy deſerts ſor remains of former opulence, and many pieces of delicate workmanſhip (tho<hi rend="sup">, </hi>not in a ſtyle which we would admire) in go'14! and ſil</p><lb/><p>ver were found. Vaults were found buried in the fand filled with written papers, in a character wholly unknown ; and a wall was diſcovered extending ſeveral miles, built with hewn ſtone, and ornamented with corniche and battlements. But we are forgetting ourſelves, and return to the conſideration of the diſtribution of the rivers on the ſurface of the earth. A great ridge of •mountains begins at the ſouth-eaſt corner of the Euxine Sea, and proceeds eaſtward, ranging along the ſouth ſide of the Caſpian, and ſtill advancing unites with the mountains firſt mentioned in Thibet, ſending off ſome branches to the ſouth, which divide Perſia, India, and Thibet. From the ſouth ſide of this ridge flow the Euphrates, Tigris, Indus, Ganges, &amp;c. and from the north the ancient Oxus and many unknown ſtreams.</p><p>There is a remarkable circumſtance in this quarter of the globe. Although it ſeems to be neareſt to the greateſt elevations, it ſeems alſo to have places of the greateſt depreſſion. We have already ſaid that the Caſpian Sea is lower titan the ocean. There is in its neighbourhood another great baſon of ſalt water, the lake Aral, which receives the waters of the Oxus or Gihon, which were ſaid to have formerly run into the Caſpian Sea. There cannot therefore be a great difference in the level of theſe twobaſons; neither have they any outlet, tho’ they receive great rivers. There is another great lake in the very middle of Perſia, the Zare or Zara, which receives the river Hindemend, of near 250 miles length, beſides other ſtreams. There is an« other ſuch in Aſia Minor. The ſea of Sodom and Gomorrah is another inſtance. And in the high countries we mentioned, there are many ſmall ſalt lakes, which receive little rivers, and have no outlet. The lake Zara in Perſia, however, is the only one which indicates a conſiderable hollow of the country. It is now aſcer- ' tained by actual furvey, that the fest of Sodom is conſiderably higher than the Mediterranean. This feature is not, however, peculiar to Aſia. It obtains alſo in Africa, whoſe rivers we now proceed to mention.</p><p>Of them, however, we know very little. The Nile indeed is perhaps better known than any river out of Europe ; and of its ſource and progreſs we have given a full account in a ſeparate article. See Nile.</p><p>By the regiſter of the weather kept by Mr Bruce at Gondar in 1770 and 177r, it appears that the greateſt rains are about the beginning of July. He ſays that at an average each month after June it doubles its rains. The caliſh or canal is opened at Cairo about the 9th of Auguſt, when the river has riſen 14 peeks (each 21 inches), and the waters begin to decreaſe about the I oth of September. Hence we may form a conjecture concerning the time which the water employs in coming from Abyſſinia. Mr Bruce ſuppoſes it 9 days, which ſup* poſes a velocity not leſs than 14 feet in a ſecond; a thing paſt belief, and inconſiſtent with all our notions. The general ſlope of the river is greatly diminiſhed by ſeveral great cataraéts ; and Mr Bruce expreſsly ſays, that he might have come down from Sennaar to the cataraéts of Syene in a boat, and that it is navigable for boats far above Sennaar. He came ſrom Syene to Cairo by water. We apprehend that no boat would venture down a ſtream moving even fix feet in a ſecond, and none could row up if the velocity was three feet. As the waters begin to decreaſe about the 10th of</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
