<p><span class="font1">broad, more or less cartilaginous, or variously ossified median portion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Appendicular Skeleton.—The appendicular skeleton of Reptiles, like that of Vertebrates generally,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">consists of a pair of limb girdles (pectoral and pelvic), with a pair of skeletal appendages proceeding from either&nbsp;girdle. Each such skeletal appendage has also, normally,&nbsp;the typical differentiation into (1) a single upper limb&nbsp;bone, (2) a pair of lower limb bones, (3) a group of small&nbsp;foot-root bones or cartilages (carpus or tarsus), (4) a series&nbsp;of middle foot bones (metacarpus or metatarsus), and (5)</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">a group of small bones (phalanges) arranged in series according to the number of digits, but the number in&nbsp;each digit varying in different digits and in different&nbsp;groups of Reptiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Every trace of an appendicular skeleton may, however, be wanting, as is the case in most Ophidians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There may be a pectoral limb girdle without any rudiment of a fore-limb skeleton, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis, Acontias,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbæna.</span><span class="font1"> There may be a pelvic girdle without any&nbsp;rudiment of a hind-limb skeleton, as in at least some, if&nbsp;not all, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlopidæ.</span><span class="font1"> Very rarely there may be both&nbsp;rudimentary pectoral and pelvic girdles without any trace&nbsp;of limb skeleton, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbæna.</span><span class="font1"> Thus, of the two&nbsp;categories, (1) limb girdles, and (2) girdle appendages&nbsp;or limbs, the former is the more constant, as we never&nbsp;find rudimentary extremities and limbs without any trace&nbsp;of a girdle, while the contrary we do find here and there.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Limb Girdles.—</span><span class="font1">Each girdle consists of two lateral halves, and each such lateral half further consists of two</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">divisions which diverge from the articular surface offered to the limb by such lateral half. From that articular&nbsp;surface one division descends dorsally and does not connect itself with its fellow of the opposite side. The other&nbsp;ventral division passes inwards and somewhat downwards&nbsp;and normally does connect itself, directly or indirectly,&nbsp;with its fellow of the opposite side. The dorsal ascending&nbsp;division is generally single, and consists of two parts in&nbsp;serial succession. The ventral division consists normally&nbsp;of two or more parts, which, though diverging, pass ven-trally side by side, or one in front of the other. Each&nbsp;girdle normally connects itself with the axial skeleton&nbsp;either towards the dorsal or ventral aspect of the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Pectoral Girdle.—</span><span class="font1">This girdle only becomes connected (except in Chelonians) with the ventral part of the appendicular skeleton,—to wit, where it abuts against&nbsp;either side of the sternum. In its most complex condition&nbsp;—that found in some Saurians, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g., Iguana—</span><span class="font1">the dorsal&nbsp;division consists of a scapula (with a forwardly extending</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">process—the mesoscapular), and is continued upwards into a suprascapular ; while the ventral division consists of a&nbsp;coracoid, which abuts against</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the sternum, and from which</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">three parts (the precoracoid,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the epicoracoid, and the meso-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">coracoid) diverge forwards</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and inwards, and also of a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">clavicle, between which and its fellow of the opposite side an interclavicle is interposed. This girdle normally in&nbsp;Reptiles, as in all other Vertebrates, embraces more or less&nbsp;of the axial skeleton externally ; only in adult Chelonians&nbsp;it becomes drawn in within the circuit of the ribs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidia</span><span class="font1">, as has been said, there is no pectoral girdle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In certain </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sauria</span><span class="font1"> it is in its simplest possible form, as, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1"> in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Acontias</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlosaurus,</span><span class="font1"> where each lateral half&nbsp;consists of a minute ossification representing the clavicle&nbsp;and coracoid, which is not connected with its fellow of the&nbsp;opposite side by any hard structure, as both sternum and&nbsp;interclavicle are wanting. It is also quite rudimentary in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbæna,</span><span class="font1"> but it is fairly developed in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chirotes.</span><span class="font1"> Its&nbsp;most complex condition in Saurians has been already&nbsp;described. The Chamælcons have a simple girdle consisting of a long and narrow scapula with suprascapula and a&nbsp;long and narrow coracoid, the anterior part of which</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> This is interesting because it is probable that genetically the limb is prior to the limb girdle, which was an ingrowth from the former.&nbsp;See Trans. Zool. Sοc., 1879, vol. x. p. 439.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
