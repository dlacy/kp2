The scorpion-flies are remarkable for the elongation of the oral region of the head into a prominent beak. The larva is grub-like, beset with spines and generally furnished with eight pairs of abdominal pro-legs in addition to the legs on the thorax, which are short. They live in the soil or in rotten wood and are carnivorous. The species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Bittacus</hi> are superficially strikingly similar to the <hi rend="italic">Tipulidae</hi> or “ daddy-long-legs”; while those referred to, <hi rend="italic">Boreus,</hi> are anomalous in being apterous and like small grasshoppers. They have usually been included in the order Neuroptera, but it is now generally considered that they should form a distinct order, which is termed Panorpata or Mecaptera.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
