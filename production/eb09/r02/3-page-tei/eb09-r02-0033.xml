Freshwater Snakes abound, especially of the genus Tropidonotus. Of Tortricidæ three genera have been distinguished. No true Vipers occur, but Pit Vipers are represented by three genera, of which two are Rattlesnakes.</p><p>After what has been stated already, the affinities of this to other regions can be summed up in a few words. The Reptilian fauna of North and South America forms, with the exception of the Chelonians, a homogeneous whole by which the Neogean division proposed by Sclater for Passerine Birds is well characterized. On the other hand, the Chelonian fauna of North America is entirely distinct from that of South America, and most closely allied to that of India.</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">The Europa-Asiatic Region.—</hi>Whilst the north of the western hemisphere has at least one order of Reptiles, the Chelonians, by which it is distinguished from the south, the temperate region of the eastern hemisphere possesses no important distinguishing type of Reptile. Its Reptilian fauna is merely an offshoot of those of the two adjoining tropical regions ; and, if we were to add the genera most characteristic of the Palæarctic fauna to either Africa or India, the character of neither would be modified or changed. Thus, so far as Reptiles are concerned, a Palæarctic region does not deserve to rank with the other primary regions.</p><p>The Chelonians are represented by nine species only, viz. :—</p><p>Testudo, ....................................................4    species</p><p>Emys, .......................................................3    ,,</p><p>Trionyx, ....................................................2    ,,</p><p>—types which are only specifically distinct from those    of the two</p><p>southern tropical regions. The Land Tortoises are confined to the warmer districts of the western portion, penetrating into the centre of the Siberian sub-region, and entirely absent in the northern and eastern parts ; of Emys one species CE. lutaria) is still found in north-eastern Germany as far north as 54° N. lat.@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> ; and probably some other species will be found in similar latitudes in the little explored Amur country, where also a species of Trionyx ( T. maaekii) occurs. The second species of this latter genus which is referable to this region inhabits the Euphrates and Tigris.</p><p>The recent discovery of an Alligator in central China is a highly interesting fact, but not surprising, when we remember the occurrence in China of not a few North-American types of Batrachians and Freshwater Fishes. The common African Crocodile still lingers in the Mediterranean district,—its presence in Syria having been placed beyond doubt, and its occurrence in Sicily having been asserted on very good authority.</p><p>The Lacertilians include the only family type which this region has not derived from either Africa or India, viz., the Anguidæ. Two genera of this family, Anguis and Pseudopus,@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> are widely spread in Europe, and closely allied, the former to the South-American Ophiodes, and the latter to the North-American Ophiosaurus. Laeertidæ are abundant as in Africa, and Amphisbænidæ and Chamæleontidæ represented at least in the Mediterranean district. Towards the central parts of Asia the terrestrial Agamidæ are continued from north-western Africa, partly with but slight modifications, Phrynoeefihalus being a specifically Central-Asiatic genus. In the Manchurian sub-region these African types are replaced by some Indian forms, such as Gecko and Taehydromus. The northern range of Lizards in this region extends as far as Lapland (Lacerta υivipara and Anguis fragilis).</p><p>The most characteristic Ophidian genus of the region is Zamenis, a Colubrine form which is very widely spread, and includes more species (eleven) than any other Palæarctic genus. This genus extends over Arabia, and even into the island of Socotra, without being associated there so far as is known at present with Snakes of an either peculiarly African or Indian type. The total number of Palæarctic Snakes amounts to sixty, of which twelve are poisonous Snakes, viz., nine Vipérines and three Halys. The majority inhabit the Mediterranean district and western Asia.</p><p>Four Typhlops and a single Stxnοstoma have been found in the Mediterranean district and Persia.</p><p>Of the small number of Calamariidæ and Coronellidæ. Rhyncho∙</p><lb/><p>calamus, Psilοsomα, Lytorlιyηchus, and Ditypophis (Socotra) are genera not found beyond this region.</p><p>Colubridæ are comparatively numerous, and show less affinity to African than Indian forms. Besides Zamenis, Coluber and Elaphis occur in four species each, and Rhineehis and Acontiophis (Afghanistan) are peculiar genera.</p><p>Three or four species of Tropidcrnotus represent the groups of Freshwater Snakes.</p><p>The Psammophidæ are well developed ; besides two species of Psammophis, Taρhrometopοη and Cœlopeltis are peculiar genera, but not extending into eastern Asia.</p><p>There is one species of Eryx.</p><p>One species of Naja reaches the Caspian.</p><p>The three species of Halys are Central-Asiatic.@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi></p><p>Of the nine species of Vipérines six belong to Vipera and Cerastes. Dαboia and Εchis may be considered to have their headquarters in this region, but they extend into southern India, and Eehis has spread east and west along the barren plains or deserts of North Africa and north-western India.</p><p>7. <hi rend="italic">Hew Zealand.—</hi>The southernmost parts of South America, Africa, and Australia are not inhabited by a sufficiently differentiated fauna to be separated from the tropical regions of which they are the continuation. None of the small oceanic islands south of 40° or Tierra del Fuego possess any Reptiles. On the other hand New Zealand is by the possession of <hi rend="italic">Hatteria,</hi>  the sole living remnant of the extinct order <hi rend="italic">Rhynehoeephalia</hi>  (not to mention other scarcely less important parts of its fauna), so much distinguished from the other regions that it cannot be associated with any of them. Although the climate and other physical conditions seem to be well adapted for the existence of the Chelonian and Ophidian types, neither is represented ; and of Lizards only representatives of the ubiquitous Skinks and Geckos have reached its shores ; but some of the latter must have inhabited New Zealand for a long period, as they belong to a distinct genus, <hi rend="italic">Naultinus, </hi>which is peculiar to this group of islands.</p><p>At the conclusion of this section it will be useful first to recapitulate the principal features of the Reptilian faunæ for each of the primary regions into which the land of the globe has been divided by zoologists, and which nearly coincide with the geographical divisions, and secondly to arrange the regions according to the natural relations as expressed by this class of animals. A division into zones comprising the corresponding parts of both hemispheres cannot be maintained for Reptiles, since the greater portion of the faunæ of the temperate are merely the offshoots of tropical faunæ, no peculiar types of a higher than generic rank being developed in them.</p><p>1.    The Indian Region is characterized by Trionyeidæ and Emydidæ, but few Testudinulæ. Croeodilidæ, with Gavials. Lacertilians and Ophidians very numerous. Agamidæ chiefly arboreal (Draco), and Varanidæ. Pythonidæ and Lyeodontidæ. Ground Snakes, Colubers, Tree Snakes, and Freshwater Snakes abundant in genera. Tropidonotus. Poisonous Snakes in the proportion of species as 1 : 10, and comprising Crotalidæ and Elapidæ, but only two Viperidæ.</p><p>2.    The African Region (exclusive of Madagascar) is characterized by Land Tortoises, Trionyeidæ, and Chelydidæ. Species of Croeodi∙ lus only. Lacertilians and Ophidians rather numerous. Agamûdæ chiefly terrestrial ; Laeertidæ and Varanidæ are well represented. Amphisbænidæ, Gerrhosauridæ, and ZonuriAæ are peculiar to the region. Chamæleontidæ. Pythonidæ and Lyeodontidæ. True Colubers and Tropidonotus almost absent. Psammophidæ. Poisonous Snakes in the proportion of 1 : 5, comprising Viperidæ and numerous venomous Colubrines.</p><p>3.    The Evroγo-Asiatic Region is composed of a mixture of Indian and African generic and family types; and only a few peculiar genera have their centre of distribution in this part, such as Anguis, Pseudopus, Ρhryηoccphalus, Uromastyx, Stxnοdaetyhιs, Also-phylax, Cerαmodaxtylus, Scineus, Zamenis, Cœlopeltis, Taphrοnιeto-pon, Daboia, Eehis, Halys. The majority inhabit the sub-tropical and warmer parts abutting upon the neighbouring tropical regions, and are rapidly reduced in number in the more temperate portion.</p><p>4.    The Tropical Pacific Region possesses one of the terrestrial Chelonian types, Chelydidæ, and species of Crοeοdilus only.</p><lb/><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>    Emys lutaria is one of the Tortoises the range of which has become much restricted in post-Glacial times, its remains having been found in peat beds in Norfolk, Belgium, Denmark, and Sweden, where it is now completely extinct.</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi>    The isolated occurrence of a species of Pseudopus in Khassia has been mentioned above.</p><lb/><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Viperine and Crotaline Snakes meet in the centre of the Siberian subregion (Peters, Monatsbeτ.
