This year a ſon was born to the king of  Scotland at Dunfermline, and named <hi rend="italic">David.</hi> The court-poets of the time foretold, that this infant would one day rival his father’s fame, and prove victorious over the English. But ſcarce had this future hero come into the world, when a rival began to make his appearance. John Baliol, the unfortunate king of Scotland, had long  been dead; but left a ſon named <hi rend="italic">Edward,</hi> heir to his,  pretenſions to the crown. The young prince had reſided on his paternal eſtate in Normandy, neglected and forgotten; but in 1324 was called to the court of England, for the purpoſe, undoubtedly, of ſetting him up as a rival to young David Bruce, in caſe his father, now broken with fatigues, ſhould die in a ſhort time. The negociations for peace, however, ſtill went on; but the commiſſioners appointed for this purpoſe made little progreſs, by reaſon of demands for feudal ſovereignty ſtill made by the Engliſh. The reconciliation with the church was alſo broken off, by reaſon of the Scots keeping poſſeſſion of Berwick. This had been taken during the papal truce; and Robert thought proper ſtill to lie under the ſentence of excommunication rather than to part with ſuch an important fortreſs.</p><p>In the beginning of the year 1327, Edward II. was depoſed, and ſucceeded by his ſon Edward III. then in his 15th year. He renewed the negociations for peace, and ratified the truce which his father had made; but hearing that the Scots had reſolved to invade England if a peace was not immediately concluded, he ſummoned his barons to meet him in arms at Newcaſtle, and fortified York.—We are not certainly informed of the reaſons which induced the Scots at this time to diſregard the truce; however, it is certain, that on the 15th of June 1327, Douglas and Randolph invaded England by the weſtern marches, with an army of 20,000 horſemen. Againſt them Edward III. led an army, conſiſting, at the loweſt calculation, of 30,000 men, who aſſembled at Durham on the 13th of July. The Scots proceeded with the utmoſt cruelty, burning and deſtroying every thing as they went along; and on the 18th of the ſame month, the Engliſh diſcovered them by the ſmoke and flames which marked their progreſs. They marched forward in order of battle towards the quarter where the ſmoke was perceived; but, meeting with no enemy for two days, they concluded that the Scots had retired. Diſencumbering themſelves then of their heavy baggage, they reſolved by a forced march to reach the river Tyne, and, by poſting themſelves on the north bank of that river; to intercept the Scots on their return. On the 20th of July, the cavalry having left the infantry behind, croſſed the river at Haidon: but before the reſt of the army could come up, the river was ſo ſwelled by ſudden rains, that it could no longer be forded; and thus the troops remained divided for ſeveral days, without any accommodation for quarters, and in the greateſt want of proviſions and forage. The ſoldiers now began to murmur; and it was reſolved again to proceed ſouthwards. The king proclaimed a reward of lands, to the value of 1001. yearly for life, to the perſon who ſhould firſt diſcover the enemy “on dry  ground, where they might be attacked;” and many knights and eſquires ſwam acroſs the river on this ſtrange errand. The army continued its march for three days without any news of the Scots; but on the fourth day, certain accounts of them were brought by an eſquire, Thomas Rokeſhy: who reported, that “the Scots had made him priſoner; but that their leaders, underſtanding his buſineſs, had ſet him at liberty; laying, that they had remained for eight days on the ſame ground, as ignorant of the motions of the Engliſh as the Engliſh were of theirs, and that they were deſirous and ready to combat.” With this man for their guide, the Engliſh ſoon came in view of the Scots. They were advantageouſly poſted on a riſing ground, having the river Were in front, and their flanks ſecured by rocks and precipices. The Engliſh diſmounted and advanced, hoping to allure the Scots from their ſtrong poſt; but in vain. Edward then ſent a herald to Randolph and Douglas, with a meſſage in the ſtyle of chivalry: “Either,” ſays he, “ſuffer me to paſs the river, and leave me room for ranging my forces; or do you paſs the river, and I will leave you room to range yours; and thus ſhall we fight on equal terms.” To this the Scottiſh commanders anſwered, “We will do neither. On our road hither we have burnt and ſpoiled the country; and here we are fixed while to us it ſeems good; and if the king of England is offended, let him come over and chaſtiſe us.”</p><p>The armies continued in fight of each other for two days; after which the Engliſh, underſtanding that their enemies were diſtreſſed for proviſions, reſolved to maintain a cloſe blockade, and to reduce them by famine. Next day, however, they were ſurpriſed to find that the Scots had ſecretly decamped, and taken poſt two miles up the river in ground ſtill ſtronger, and of more difficult acceſs, amidſt a great wood. The Engliſh encamped oppoſite to them near Stanhope park. At midnight Douglas undertook a moſt deſperate enterpriſe, ſomewhat reſembling thoſe of the ancient heroes. With 200 horſemen he approached the Engliſh camp, and entered it under the guiſe of a chief commander calling the rounds. Having thus eluded the centinels, he paſſed on to the royal quarters, overthrew every thing that oppoſed him, and furiouſly aſſaulted the king’s tent. The domeſtics of Edward deſperately defended their maſter; and his chaplain, with many others of his houſehold, were ſlain. However, the king himſelf eſcaped; and Douglas, diſappointed of his prey, ruſhed through the enemy, and effected a retreat with inconſiderable loſs. —The following day, the Engliſh learned from a priſoner, that orders had been iſſued in the Scottiſh camp for all men to hold themſelves in readineſs that evening to follow the banner of Douglas: on which, apprehending an attack in the night, they prepared for battle, lighting great fires, and keeping a ſtrict watch; but in the morning, they were informed by two trumpeters whom they had taken priſoners, that the Scots had decamped before midnight, and were returning to their own country. This report could ſcarcely be credited, and the army remained for ſome hours in order of battle; but at length ſome ſcouts having croſſed the</p></body></text></TEI>
