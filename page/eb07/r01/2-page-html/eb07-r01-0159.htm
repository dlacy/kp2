<p><span class="font0">species lives in the fresh waters of South America, and sometimes in obscure houses in Cayenne and Surinam, where it is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tedo</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cumeu.</span><span class="font0"> According to Seba and Madame&nbsp;Merian, the negroes of the colonies use its flesh as food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Spix has figured another species, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">P. curururu,</span><span class="font0"> nearly resembling the above, which affects the bottoms of lakes in&nbsp;Brazil. That author assures us that the female does not&nbsp;receive and hatch its young in the alveola on her back.&nbsp;Another kind is preserved in the Paris museum,—a true&nbsp;Pipa, according to Cuvier, from the Rio Negro. It is quite&nbsp;smooth, and has a narrower head than the common species.&nbsp;The baron names it </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pipa lœvis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">FAMILY SALAMANDRIDÆ. NEWTS OR SALAMANDERS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have now reached a group of which the name has been celebrated from remote antiquity, and the history encompassed by fables in every age. “It was on the fortunate soil of ancient Greece, in the bosom of a wise and warlike nation, where imagination, favoured by a happy clime,&nbsp;exaggerated even the wonders of creative power, that the&nbsp;reputation of the salamander originated.” @@<sup>1</sup> It was among&nbsp;that fanciful people that an obscure and changeful reptile&nbsp;was as it were consecrated to posterity by a fantastic but&nbsp;immortal name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the times of superstitious fiction regarding the once famous salamander are now for ever passed and gone, and&nbsp;it is only to be regretted that they have not carried along&nbsp;with them the ignorant prejudice which still remains respecting a few harmless reptiles. “ The daughter of fire,”&nbsp;with her “ frame of icy crystal,” is now nearly forgotten ;&nbsp;and for unchanging love and unflinching courage, other&nbsp;and more fitting emblems have been long invented. The&nbsp;ancient story of the salamander enduring fire and extinguishing flame is now recognised only as an idle tale ; and&nbsp;scarcely less so its faculty of poisoning vegetables, and its&nbsp;other pernicious powers. These gross errors being swept&nbsp;away, more room is left to investigate whatever is instructive in the history of those once widely abused, but really&nbsp;interesting creatures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the salamanders resemble in many respects the foregoing genera of the order, many of the details which have previously been stated equally apply to them. This remark&nbsp;relates also to the extraordinary metamorphoses they undergo, but with some striking variations. We here find&nbsp;examples of a species of reproduction not uncommon among&nbsp;fish, and met with, as already mentioned, among certain&nbsp;lizards. We allude to that mode of birth known under the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oνo-viυiparous.</span><span class="font0"> The mode we have been hitherto&nbsp;contemplating resembles that of birds in being strictly </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oviparous.</span><span class="font0"> The ova or eggs are extruded from the parent,&nbsp;and under the influence of heat the young are in due time&nbsp;hatched. In the salamanders, however, another stage in-' tervenes. When the ova have arrived at the state in which,&nbsp;in the other Batrachia, they are wont to be expelled, in&nbsp;these they are retained for some time after their development has begun. The eggs are, in fact, never laid, but are&nbsp;hatched in the interior of the parents ; so that they bring&nbsp;forth living offspring, although originally contained in eggs.&nbsp;These eggs, by a natural process, are deposited in certain&nbsp;bags, which are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ovidtwts.</span><span class="font0"> In the salamander there&nbsp;are five of these, each of which contains six, or eight, or&nbsp;more young, and there they are nourished by a peculiar&nbsp;fluid, and do not issue forth till they have undergone their&nbsp;metamorphoses, that is, have acquired their feet and other</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">organs. They are deposited in or near marshes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In our general remarks on the Batrachia, we traced, in a few words, the changes which take place in the respiratory system of this group. We saw that being first exercised in water, it was for a time precisely analogous to&nbsp;that of fishes ; and that terminating on land, it perfectly&nbsp;corresponded with that of land animals. In the salamanders there is this peculiarity,—that while one section of&nbsp;them ere long become terrestrial in their structure and&nbsp;habits, another division continues aquatic for life. But so&nbsp;far as respiration is concerned, the same complete metamorphosis takes place in these latter as in the former ; their&nbsp;gills vanish, regular lungs are completed, and yet the aquatic salamander, water-newt, or triton as it is sometimes called, continues a constant inhabitant of the water. The species are in fact habitual inmates of that element, and yet&nbsp;inhale the vital breath of heaven ; and in this respect completely correspond to the cetaceous or whale tribes, with&nbsp;whose peculiarities, on a scale so greatly more gigantic,&nbsp;naturalists have been long acquainted. Like them they&nbsp;must regularly come to the surface, inflate their lungs, descend to their weedy homes, and after a time return again&nbsp;for air,—repeating this process as often as their exigencies&nbsp;may require. Peculiar characters distinguish the circulating&nbsp;system of the Cete, as compared with that of other Mammalia ; and we have little doubt that parallel features occur&nbsp;among the tritons, although we are not aware that this point&nbsp;has been as yet investigated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When speaking of toads, we took occasion to make a few remarks on the cuticular secretion, for which they, in common with other Batrachia, are remarkable. The salamanders have on this account been still more celebrated ; and&nbsp;there seems no reason to doubt that the fable of their&nbsp;withstanding the effects of fire has originated from this&nbsp;peculiarity. The humour is in them found to possess more&nbsp;concentric virtue, having withal a more offensive odour,&nbsp;and a more acrid taste. Count Lacépède says, that if a&nbsp;drop of it come in contact with the tongue, it produces the&nbsp;sensation of burning ; so that it really proves a defence&nbsp;against many animals which would otherwise devour them.&nbsp;It is more especially when they are irritated and alarmed,&nbsp;and particularly if exposed to fire, that they distil the secretion in quantities, and envelope themselves in a damp covering, which, for a brief period, might possibly prevent&nbsp;their being consumed. Hence, then, may have originated&nbsp;the ancient opinion that these animals could live not only&nbsp;on land and in water, but also in fire ; and from the slender&nbsp;germ of that same peculiarity has no doubt spread the monstrous statement of Pliny, that these creatures infested the&nbsp;herbage of a country to such a vast extent as even to cause&nbsp;the extinction of entire nations !</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another remarkable peculiarity of the salamanders, more especially of the aquatic kind, which has been successfully&nbsp;elucidated by Spallanzani, is common to them, and in some&nbsp;measure to the tadpole state of the other Batrachia. We&nbsp;allude to that surprising power whereby, when repeatedly&nbsp;deprived of even an important portion of their body, that&nbsp;portion is as frequently renewed. This property is not unknown among some of the lower orders of creation, but in&nbsp;none is it more striking than in these reptiles. Thus, in the&nbsp;triton, the whole limb may be removed, and by and by&nbsp;we find it completely restored, and furnished with perfect&nbsp;bones, muscles, nerves, &amp;c. In other instances an eye has&nbsp;been extracted, and speedily a new and perfect one is found&nbsp;to have supplied its place. These renewals are more complete than such as take place among the true lizards, formerly alluded to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The salamander group are distinguished by the following peculiarities. They have an elongated body, four feet, and</span></p>
