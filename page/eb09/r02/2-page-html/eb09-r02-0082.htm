<p><span class="font0">a most prejudicial effect upon the district of the Rhine ; and the peace of Westphalia gave France a footing on the left bank of the&nbsp;hitherto exclusively German river by the acquisition of Alsace.&nbsp;The violent seizure of Strasburg by France in 1681 was ratified by&nbsp;the peace of Ryswick in 1697, which recognized the Rhine as the&nbsp;boundary between Germany and France from Basel to about&nbsp;Germersheim. It was an easy inference for the French mind that&nbsp;the Rhine should be the boundary .throughout and the Gaul of&nbsp;Cæsar restored. This ideal was realized in 1801, when the whole&nbsp;of the left bank of the Rhine was formally ceded to France. The&nbsp;congress of Vienna (1815) restored the lower part of the Rhenish&nbsp;valley to Germany, but it was not till the war of 1870-71 that the&nbsp;recovery of Alsace and Lorraine made the Rhine once more&nbsp;“Germany’s river, not Germany’s frontier.” In the military&nbsp;history of all these centuries constant allusion is made to the&nbsp;Rhine, its passages, and its fortresses. Every general who has&nbsp;fought in its neighbourhood has at one time or another had to&nbsp;provide for a crossing of the Rhine, from Julius Cæsar, who&nbsp;crossed it twice, down to our own time. The wars carried on here&nbsp;by his Most Christian Majesty Louis XIV. are still remembered in&nbsp;the Rhine district, where the devastations of his generals were of&nbsp;the most appalling description ; and scarcely a village or town but&nbsp;has a tale to tell of the murder and rapine of this period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Rhine has always exercised a peculiar sort of fascination over the German mind, in a measure and iu a manner not easily&nbsp;paralleled by the case of any other river. “Father Rhine” is the&nbsp;centre of the German’s patriotism and the symbol of his country.&nbsp;In his literature it has played a prominent part from the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nibelιιngenlied</span><span class="font0"> to the present day ; and its weird and romantic&nbsp;legends have been alternately the awe and the delight of his&nbsp;childhood. The Rhine was the classic river of the Middle Ages ;&nbsp;and probably the Tiber alone is of equal historical interest among&nbsp;European rivers. Victor Hugo has perhaps best described the&nbsp;mingled feelings which the Rhine awakens. “Le Rhin,” he says,&nbsp;“ réunit tout. Le Rhin est rapide comme le Rhône, large comme la&nbsp;Loire, encaissé comme la Meuse, tortueux comme la Seine, limpide&nbsp;et vert comme la Somme, historique comme le Tibre, royal comme&nbsp;le Danube, mystérieux comme le Nil, pailleté d’or comme un fleuve&nbsp;d’Amérique, couvert de fables et de fantômes comme un fleuve&nbsp;d’Asie.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. F. M.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHINOCEROS, a name applied by the ancients to an animal the most striking external peculiarity of which&nbsp;is certainly the horn growing above its nose (ρινόκερω?,&nbsp;nose-horn).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The various existing and extinct species are grouped into a family, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhinocerotidæ,</span><span class="font1"> which is a division of the&nbsp;Perissodactyle (odd-toed) section of the great order of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Uηgulata</span><span class="font1"> or hoofed mammals, of which section the tapirs&nbsp;and horses are the only other surviving members (see&nbsp;Mammalia, vol. χv. p. 428).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The following are the general characters applicable to all the members of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">First, as regards dentition. Incisors variable, generally reduced in number and often quite rudimentary, and early&nbsp;deciduous. Canines, in existing species, absent. Molar&nbsp;series, consisting of the full number of four premolars&nbsp;and three molars above and below, all in contact and&nbsp;closely resembling each other, except the first, which is&nbsp;much smaller than the rest and often deciduous. The&nbsp;others gradually increasing in size up to the penultimate.&nbsp;The upper molars have a very characteristic pattern of&nbsp;crown, having a much-developed fiat or more or less&nbsp;sinuous outer wall, and two transverse ridges running&nbsp;obliquely inwards and backwards from it, terminating&nbsp;internally in conical eminences or columns, and enclosing&nbsp;a deep (middle) sinus between. The posterior sinus is&nbsp;formed behind the posterior transverse ridge, and is&nbsp;bounded externally by a backward continuation of the&nbsp;outer wall and behind by the cingulum. The anterior&nbsp;sinus is formed in the same manner, but is much smaller.&nbsp;The middle sinus is often intersected by vertical laminæ&nbsp;(“ combing plates ”) projecting into it from the anterior surface of the posterior transverse ridge or from the wall, the&nbsp;development of which is a useful guide in discriminating&nbsp;the species, especially those no longer existing and known&nbsp;only by the teeth and bones. The depressions between the&nbsp;ridges are not filled up with cementum as in the horse.&nbsp;The lower molars have the crown formed by a pair of&nbsp;crescents ; the last has no third lobe or talon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Head large, skull elongated, elevated posteriorly into a transverse occipital crest. No post-orbital processes or&nbsp;any separation between orbits and temporal fossæ.&nbsp;Nasal bones large and stout, co-ossified, and standing out&nbsp;freely above the premaxillæ, from which they are separated&nbsp;by a deep and wide fissure ; the latter small, generally not&nbsp;meeting in the middle line in front, often quite rudimentary. Tympanies small, not forming a bulla. Brain cavity&nbsp;very small for the size of the skull. Vertebrae :—cervical,&nbsp;7 ; dorsal, 19-20; lumbar, 3; sacral, 4; caudal, about 22.&nbsp;Limbs stout, and of moderate length. Three completely&nbsp;developed toes, with distinct broad rounded hoofs on each&nbsp;foot.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Mammæ two, inguinal. Eyes small. Ears of&nbsp;moderate size, oval, erect, prominent, placed near the&nbsp;occiput. Skin very thick, in many species thrown into&nbsp;massive folds. Hairy covering ∙ scanty. All existing&nbsp;species have one or two median horns on the face.&nbsp;When one is present it is situated over the conjoined&nbsp;nasal bones ; when two, the hinder one is over the frontals.&nbsp;These horns, which are of a more or less conical form&nbsp;and usually recurved, and often grow to a great length&nbsp;(three or even four feet), are composed of a solid mass of&nbsp;hardened epidermic cells growing from a cluster of long&nbsp;dermal papillæ. The cells formed on each papilla constitute a distinct horny fibre, like a thick hair, and the whole&nbsp;are cemented together by an intermediate mass of cells&nbsp;which grow up from the interspaces between the papillæ.&nbsp;It results from this that the horn has the appearance of a&nbsp;mass of agglutinated hairs, which, in the newly growing&nbsp;part at the base, readily fray out on destruction of the&nbsp;softer intermediate substance ; but the fibres differ from&nbsp;true hairs in growing from a free papilla of the derm, and&nbsp;not within a follicular involution of the same.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhinocerotidæ</span><span class="font1"> are all animals of large size, but of little intelligence, generally timid in disposition, though&nbsp;ferocious when attacked and brought to bay, using the&nbsp;nasal horns as weapons, by which they strike and toss&nbsp;their assailant. Their sight is dull, but their hearing and&nbsp;scent are remarkably acute. They feed on herbage, shrubs,&nbsp;and leaves of trees, and, like so many other large animals&nbsp;which inhabit hot countries, sleep the greater part of the&nbsp;day, being most active in the cool of the evening or even&nbsp;during the night. They are fond of bathing and wallowing&nbsp;in water or mud. None of the species have been domesticated. Animals of the group have existed in both the&nbsp;Old and New Worlds since the beginning of the Miocene&nbsp;period. In America they all became extinct before the&nbsp;end of the Pliocene period. In the Old World their&nbsp;distribution has become greatly restricted, being no longer&nbsp;found in Europe and North Asia, but only in Africa and&nbsp;in portions of the Indian and Indo-Malayan regions.</span></p>
