<p><label>RONA</label>
one of the Hebrides iſlands, is reckoned about 20 leagues diſtant ſrom the north-eaſt point of Neſs in Lewis—about a mile long, and half a mile broad. It has a hill in the weſt part, and is only viſible from Lewis in a fair ſummer’s day. There is a chapel in the iſland dedicated to St Ronan, fenced with a ſtone wall round it. This church the natives take care to keep very neat and clean, and ſweep it every day. There is an altar in it, on which there lies a big plank of wood about 10 feet long. Every foot has a hole in it, and in every hole is a ſtone, to which the natives aſeribe ſevetal virtues ; one of them is ſingular (as they ſay) for promoting ſpeedy delivery to a woman in travel. The inhabitants are extremely ignorant, and very ſuperſtitious. See <hi rend="italic">Mar tin’s Deſcription.</hi></p>
