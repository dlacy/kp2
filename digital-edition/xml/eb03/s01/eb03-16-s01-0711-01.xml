(Publius Cornelius), a renowned Roman general, ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">Africanus,</hi> for his conqueſts in that country. His other ſignal military exploits were, his taking the city of New Carthage in a ſingle day; his complete victory over Hannibal, the famous Carthaginian general; the defeat of Syphax king of Numidia, and of Antiochus in Afia. He was as eminent for his chaſtity, and his generous behaviour to his priſoners, as for his valour. He died 180 B. C. aged about 51.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scipio</hi> (Lucius Cornelius), his brother, ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">Aſiaticus,</hi> for his complete victory over Antiochus at the battle of Magneſia, in which Antiochus loſt 50,000 infantry and 4000 cavalry. A triumph, and the ſurname of <hi rend="italic">Aſiaticus,</hi> were the rewards of his valour. Yet his ungrateful countrymen accuſed him, as well as his brother, of peculation; for which he was fined; but the public ſale of his effects proved the falſehood of the charge; for they did not produce the amount of the fine. He flouriſhed about 190 B. C.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scipio</hi> (Publius Emilianus), was the ſon oſ Paulus Emilius; but being adopted by Scipio Africanus, he was called <hi rend="italic">Scipio Africanus junior.</hi> He ſhowed himſelf worthy of adoption, following the footſteps of Scipio Africanus, whom he equalled in military fame and public virtues. His chief victories were the conqueſt of Carthage and Numantia; Yet theſe ſignal ſervices to his country could not protect him from an untimely fate. He was ſtrangled in his bed by order of the Decemviri, who dreaded his popularity, 129 B. C. aged 56.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
