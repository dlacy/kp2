<p><span class="font0">introduce landscape painting into her romances as a component part of the interest of the piece. The frequency of her pictures of external scenery, and their want of distinctness&nbsp;and local truth, have i ndeed been blamed by many who would&nbsp;willingly, on Puff’s principle, have abridged her descriptions&nbsp;of the rising sun, and dispensed with a great deal about gilding the eastern hemisphere. But it is certain that these descriptions, though occasionally tedious, and sometimes too obviously brought forward upon </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">principle of melo-dramatic&nbsp;contrast, have a powerful effect in heightening the impression&nbsp;communicated by tlle incidents or tbe sentiments. Set off&nbsp;against the calm beauty of a summer evening, or the magnificent gloom of a thunder storm, her pastoral or banditti&nbsp;groupes stand out with double effect ; while to the charge&nbsp;of vagueness of description, it may be answered, that Mrs.&nbsp;Radcliffe is by no means vague, where distinctness of imagery&nbsp;is, or ought to be her object ; as any one may satisfy himself&nbsp;who recalls to his recollection her description of tbe lonely&nbsp;house by tlle Mediterranean, with the scudding clouds, the&nbsp;screaming sea-birds, and the stormy sea, the scene selected&nbsp;for the murder of Ellena ;—or another picture, in the best&nbsp;manner of Salvator, of the first glimpse of the Castle of Udol-pho rising over a mountain pass, with theslant sunbeam lighting up its ancient weather-beaten towers. Indeed, the whole&nbsp;description of that Appenine fastness, both without and within, is in the best style, not of literal indeed, but of imaginative painting—“fate sits on those dark battlements and&nbsp;frowns:” the very intricacy of its internal architecture,&nbsp;and its endless passages,—a mighty maze, and we fear without a plan,—only serve to deepen the impression of imprisonment and bewilderment and gloom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Less, certainly, is to be said for those descriptions in verse wfith which her novels are rather profusely interspersed,&nbsp;and which are, of course, represented as emanating from&nbsp;some of the personages of her stories. Without denying&nbsp;the merit of some of her occasional verses, it is certain that&nbsp;she always shew<sup>,</sup>s more of the spirit of poetry in her prose.&nbsp;Indeed, independently of the mediocrity of many of these&nbsp;effusions, they often assume a ludicrous air from their contrast with the circumstances under which they are produced. Under all situations of alarm and anxiety, in the seclusion of convents, and in the castles of Condottieri,&nbsp;where drunken ruffians are brawling “ along the corridor,”&nbsp;paper, pencils, and poetical enthusiasm are never wanting&nbsp;to her heroines, and the sun is seldom suffered to rise or&nbsp;set without a tribute to his beams. Indeed, it is even observable that the poetical sensibilities of her heroines generally become more lively after any domestic calamity, such&nbsp;as the demise of a parent ; as Beau Clincher’sexuberance of&nbsp;spirits was accounted for by the fact, that he was in mourning for his father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For a particιdar notice of the individual works of Mrs. Radcliffe, we refer to our biographical article on that subject. Two of them are now wholly and deservedly forgotten.&nbsp;Neither the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne,</span><span class="font0"> nor tlle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sicilian Romance,</span><span class="font0"> crowded with violent yet ineffective incidents, gave any indication of that ability which she afterwards displayed. Of her remaining fictions, it may be said&nbsp;in a word, that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romance (&gt;f the Forest,</span><span class="font0"> founded on a&nbsp;French </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">eause celebre,</span><span class="font0"> has the fewest faults ; that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Italian,</span><span class="font0"> though extremely unequal, and in the third volume a&nbsp;comparative failure, contains the most striking and dramatic&nbsp;scenes; but that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mysteries of Udolpho</span><span class="font0"> is on the whole,&nbsp;and justly, considered the best.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To be fiιlly enjoyed, tbe Romances of Mrs. Radcliffe must be perused in youth. In after age, they appear too uniformly visionary, and the straight-laced stiffness of her heroines, who never manifest the least warmth except in poetry,&nbsp;“ female punctuation not permitting them to do more,” as&nbsp;Mrs. Malaprop observes, suggests the recollection ofthe pruderies of the pastoral and heroic romance. But when these</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">tales are read in youth, and only remembered in manhood in their better portions, they leave upon the memory a pleasing impression of a varied pageant of gloomy castles and&nbsp;caves, moon-illumined streets and palaces, “dance and Provençal song and vintage mirth,” aerial music floating over&nbsp;haunted forests, or the chant of monk or nun borne to the&nbsp;ear over the waters of some Italian lake, amidst the stillness and the shadows of evening.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have devoted a larger space to Mrs. Radcliffe than some may think justly due to the rank in fiction which she&nbsp;occupies,butwehavedone so,—first, because we think justice&nbsp;has seldom been done to the real genius which she threw&nbsp;into the style of fiction she chose to adopt, whatever may&nbsp;be its precise order of precedence in the calendar of fiction ;&nbsp;and, secondly, because, although that style became more universally popular, and more generally imitated than any which&nbsp;had preceded it, she herself, with two exceptions only, which&nbsp;we shall notice, remains the solitary writer of genius by&nbsp;whom it has been adorned. The truth is, that the sarcasms&nbsp;which have been directed against the puerile horrors of Mrs.&nbsp;Radcliffe ought justly to have been confined to the extravagances of her successors, who imitated her manner without either her imagination or her judgment, and conceived&nbsp;that the surest means of producing effect consisted in pressing the springs of the terrible as far as they would go. In the&nbsp;hands of these, “ imitated imitators,” tbe castles became&nbsp;twice as large and ten times as perplexing in their architecture ; the heroine could not open an empty drawer without&nbsp;stumbling on a mysterious manuscript written by her father&nbsp;or mother ; nor leave her room to take a twilight walk, of&nbsp;which heroines are always strangely fond, without stumbling&nbsp;on a nest of banditti ; the gleam of daggers grew more incessant ; the faces of the monks longer and more cadaverous, and&nbsp;the visits of ghosts so common-place, that they came at last&nbsp;to be viewed with the same indifference by the reader,as they&nbsp;were of old by honest Aubrey, or less honest Dr. Dee.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One word may be said in fhvour of the Romances of Mrs. Radcliffe and her school, addressed to those who think that&nbsp;every romance should embody the moral conveyed in the&nbsp;concluding couplet of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mourning Bride.</span><span class="font0"> Their general&nbsp;tendency is moral, poetical justice is in most cases rigidly enforced, and crime punished,and virtue rewarded by some unexpected good fortune, even on this earth. “ All this,” says&nbsp;Mr.Dunlop, “may be very absurd, but life, perhaps, has few&nbsp;better things than sitting at the chimney corner in a winter&nbsp;evening,after a well-spent day,and readingsuch absurdities.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The two exceptions from the general dullness and common place of the imitators of Mrs. Radcliffe, are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Monk of'M.G. Lewis,</span><span class="font0"> which appeared in 1796, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Montοriο&nbsp;ofMαturin,</span><span class="font0"> published in 1807, and among the last romances&nbsp;written on that now antiquated plan. Much injustice, we&nbsp;believe, was done to Lewis at the time. A single unfor</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tunate remark of an irreligious tendency, and some descriptions of undue warmth, pardonable in a youth of twenty, and retrenched in the second edition, gave a blow to the&nbsp;popularity of this romance from which it never recovered.&nbsp;And yet the traces of considerable genius are visible both&nbsp;in its plan and in the execution of several of its powerful&nbsp;scenes. The mere hint of the story, that is to say, the general&nbsp;idea of the gradual corruption of a proud, and enthusiastic,&nbsp;and self-relying nature, was taken, as Lewis acknowledged,&nbsp;from that ofthe Santon Barsisa in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Guardian;</span><span class="font0"> the incident of the escape of the baroness from the banditti, was an&nbsp;expansion, executed with much skill, of the scene in the&nbsp;hut in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Count Fathom ;</span><span class="font0"> for the story of the bleeding nun,&nbsp;he was indebted to a German legend, while he has borrowed&nbsp;several hints for his wandering Jew from the incomprehensible Armenian of Schiller. But to these hackneyed materials&nbsp;he has given a force and look of novelty that are surprising;&nbsp;the escape, the conjuration scene, where the Jew, withdrawing the black ribband, unveils the burning cross on his</span></p>
