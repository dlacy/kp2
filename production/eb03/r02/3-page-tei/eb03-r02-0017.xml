A grave ſubject in which there is no impropriety, may be brought down by a certain colouring ſo as to be riſi-ble; which is the caſe of <hi rend="italic">Virgil Traveſlie,</hi>  and alſo the caſe of the <hi rend="italic">Secchia Repita;</hi>  the authors laugh firſt, in order to make their readers laugh. The <hi rend="italic">Lutrin</hi>  is a burleſque poem of the other ſort, laying hold of a low and trifling incident, to expoſe the luxury, indolence, and contentious ſpirit of a ſet of monks. Boileau, the author, gives a ridiculous air to the ſubject, by dreſſing it in the heroic ſtyle, and affecting to conſider it as of the utmoſt dignity and importance. In a compoſition of this kind, no image profeſſedly ludicrous ought to find quarter, becauſe ſuch images deſtroy the contraſt; and accordingly the author ſhows always the grave face, and never once betrays a ſmile.</p><p>Though the burleſque that aims at ridicule produces its effects by elevating the ſtyle far above the ſubject, yet it has limits beyond which the elevation ought not to be carried: the poet, conſulting the imagination of his readers, ought to confine himſelf to ſuch images as are lively and readily apprehended: a ſtrained elevation, ſoaring above an ordinary reach of fancy, makes not a pleaſant impreſſion: the reader, fatigued with being always upon the ſtretch, is ſoon diſguſted; and, if he perſevere, becomes thoughtleſs and indifferent. — Further, a fiction gives no pleaſure unleſs it be painted in colours ſo lively as to produce ſome perception of reality; which never can be done effectually where the images are formed with labour or difficulty. For theſe reaſons, we cannot avoid condemning the <hi rend="italic">Batrachomuo-machia,</hi>  ſaid to be the compoſition of Homer: it is beyond the power of imagination to form a clear and lively image of frogs and mice acting with the dignity of the higheſt of our ſpecies; nor can we form a conception of the reality of ſuch an action, in any manner ſo diſtinct as to intereſt our affections even in the ſlighteſt degree.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Rape of the Lock</hi>  is of a character clearly diſtin-guiſhable- from thoſe now mentioned; it is not properly a burleſque performance, but what may rather be termed <hi rend="italic">an heroi-comical poem</hi>: it treats a gay and familiar ſubject with pleaſantry, and with a moderate degree of dignity: the author puts not on a maſk like Boileau, nor profeſſes to make us laugh like Taſſoni. The <hi rend="italic">Rape </hi><hi rend="italic">of </hi><hi rend="italic">the Lock</hi>  is a genteel ſpecies of writing, leſs ſtrained than thoſe mentioned; and is pleaſant or ludicrous without having ridicule for its chief aim; giving way, however, to ridicule where it ariſes naturally from a particular character, ſuch as that of Sir Plume. Addi-ſon’s <hi rend="italic">Spectator *,</hi>  upon the exerciſe of the fan, is extremely gay and ludicrous, reſembling in its ſubject the <hi rend="italic">Rape of the Lock. </hi></p><p>There remains to ſhow, by examples, the manner of treating ſubjects ſo as to give them a ridiculous appearance.</p><p>Il ne dit jamais, je vous donne, mais, je vous prete le bon jour.     <hi rend="italic">Moliere.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Orleans.</hi>  I know him to be valiant.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Conſlable.</hi>  I was told that by one that knows him better than you.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Orleans.</hi>  What’s he?</p><p><hi rend="italic">Conſtable.</hi>  Marry, he told me ſo himſelf; and he ſaid, he ear’d not who knew it.     <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi>  V. <hi rend="italic">Shakeſpeare.</hi></p><p>He never broke any man’s head but his own, and that was againſt a poſt when he was drunk.     <hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Millamont.</hi>  Sententious Mirabel! prithee don’t look with that violent and inflexible wiſe face, like Solomon at the dividing of the child in an old tapeſtry-hanging.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Way of the World.</hi></p><p>A true critic, in the peruſal of a book, is like a dog at a feaſt, whoſe thoughts and ſtomach are wholly ſet upon what the gueſts fling away, and conſequently is apt to ſnarl moſt when there are the fewtſt bones.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Tale of a Tub.</hi></p><p>In the following inſtances, the ridicule ariſes from abſurd conceptions in the perſons introduced.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Maſcarille.</hi>  Te ſouvient-il, vicomte, de cette demi-lune, que nous emportames ſur les enemis au ſiege d’Afras?</p><p><hi rend="italic">Jodelet.</hi>  Que veux-tu dire avec ta demi-lune? c’etoit bien une lune tout entiere.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Molière, les Precieuſes Ridicules, ſc.</hi>  11.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Slander.</hi>  I came yonder at Eaton to marry Mrs Anne Page; and ſhe’s a great lubberly boy.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Page.</hi>  Upon my life then you took the wrong—</p><p><hi rend="italic">Slander.</hi>  What need you tell me that? I think ſo when I took a boy for a girl: if I had been married to him, for all he was in woman’s apparel, I would not have had him.     <hi rend="italic">Merry Wives of Windſor.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Valentine.</hi>  Your bleſſing, Sir.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sir Sampſon.</hi>  You’ve had it already, Sir: I think I ſent it you to-day in a bill for four thouſand pound; a great deal of money, brother Foreſight-</p><p><hi rend="italic">Foreſight.</hi>  Ay, indeed, Sir Sampſon, a great deal of money for a young man; I wonder what he can do with it.     <hi rend="italic">Love for Love,</hi>  act 2. ſc. 7.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Millament.</hi>  I nauſeate walking; 'tis a country di-verſion; I lothe the country, and every thing that relates to it.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sir Wilfull.</hi>  Indeed, hah! look ye, look ye, you do? nay, ’tis like you may——here are choice of paſtimes here in town, as plays and the like; that muſt be confeſs’d, indeed.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Millament.</hi>  Ah l’etourdie! I hate the town too.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sir Wilſull.</hi>  Dear heart, that’s much——hah! that</p><p>you ſhould hate ’em both! hah! ’tis like you may; there are ſome can’t reliſh the town, and others can’t</p><p>away with the country——’tis like you may be one of</p><p>theſe, Couſin.    <hi rend="italic">Way of the World,</hi>  act 4. ſc. 4.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Lord Froth.</hi>  I aſſure you, Sir Paul, I laugh at nobody’s jeſts but my own, or a lady’s: I aſſure you, Sir Paul.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Briſk.</hi>  How? how, my Lord? what, affront my wit? Let me periſh, do I never lay any thing worthy to be laugh’d at?</p><p><hi rend="italic">Lord Froth.</hi>  O foy, don’t miſapprehend me, I don’t ſay fo, for I often ſmile at your conceptions. But there is nothing more unbecoming a man of quality than to laugh; ’tis ſuch a vulgar expreſſion of the paſ-ſions! every body can laugh. Then eſpecially to laugh at the jeſt of an inferior perſon, or when any body elſe of the lame quality does not laugh with one; ridiculous! To be pleas’d with what pleaſes the crowd! Now, when I laugh. I always laugh alone.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Double Dealer,</hi>  act 1. ſc. 4.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
