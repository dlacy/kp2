                    Under James I. an attempt was made to distinguish between&nbsp;the loyal and
                    disloyal Catholics, the latter comprising all&nbsp;those who maintained the
                    pope’s right to depose sovereigns&nbsp;from their throne. This led to a violent
                    division among the&nbsp;Catholics themselves. Many forswore the deposing
                    power;&nbsp;the majority, acting under imperative orders from Rome,&nbsp;refused
                    to deny it. The government retorted by adding&nbsp;several new penal laws to the
                    statute-book, though less than&nbsp;thirty Catholics were brought to the
                    scaffold during James’s reign.&nbsp;Under Charles I. the position of the
                    Catholics was greatly improved, largely owing to the king’s marriage with a
                    French princess.&nbsp;Although not actually repealed, the penal laws were
                    seldom&nbsp;put in force, and mass was openly celebrated in London
                    and&nbsp;elsewhere. On the outbreak of the CiviI War the
                    Catholics&nbsp;naturally sided with the king, and a great many fell
                    fighting&nbsp;for the royalist cause; towards the survivors Cromwell
                    was&nbsp;unexpectedly merciful. Very few were put to death, though a&nbsp;number
                    of estates were confiscated. Under Charles II. came&nbsp;a new period of
                    prosperity; two Catholics, Lords Arlington&nbsp;and Clifford, were admitted to
                    the inner circles of the government. Protestant suspicion was excited; in 1673
                    was passed&nbsp;the Test Act, obliging all office-holders to receive the
                    sacrament&nbsp;in the Established Church, and to declare their disbelief
                        in&nbsp;transubstantiation.@@<sup>1</sup> Five years later (1678) popular
                    exasperation found a more savage outlet, and greedily swallowed the&nbsp;tales
                    of Titus Oates about a mythical “ popish plot.” A&nbsp;number of victims were
                    brought to the scaffold, and Catholics&nbsp;were declared incapable of sitting
                    in either house of parliament.&nbsp;James II., however, was utterly indifferent
                    to the feelings of&nbsp;his subjects. He packed the privy council, the army and
                    the&nbsp;universities with Catholics, and tried to legalize the exercise&nbsp;of
                    their religion by an utterly unconstitutional Declaration of&nbsp;Indulgence.
                    Three years were enough to convince the nation&nbsp;that he was “ endeavouring
                    to subvert and extirpate the&nbsp;Protestant religion, and the Iawsandliberties
                    of this kingdom”;&nbsp;and on his deposition in 1688 Roman Catholics, or
                    persons&nbsp;married to Roman Catholics, were declared incapable
                    of&nbsp;succeeding to the throne. A new oath of allegiance was&nbsp;imposed on
                    all holders of civil or military office; they were&nbsp;required to swear that
                    no foreign prelate had, or ought to&nbsp;have, any jurisdiction, whether civil
                    or ecclesiastical, within&nbsp;the realm. Further, a number of statutes were
                    passed with&nbsp;the object of putting every possible obstacle in the way
                    of&nbsp;Catholics educating their children in their own creed, or
                    of&nbsp;inheriting or buying land. That they remained so long&nbsp;“ utterly
                    disabled from bearing any public office or charge ”&nbsp;was due to the
                    participation of many of their number in the&nbsp;Jacobite revolts'of 1715 and
                    1745. After Culloden, however,&nbsp;it was seen that all serious danger of a
                    Stuart restoration was&nbsp;passed; and in 1778 Catholics who abjured the
                    Pretender&nbsp;and denied the civil authority of the pope were relieved
                    from&nbsp;their most pressing disabilities. A proposal to extend
                    this&nbsp;measure to Scotland led to violent agitation in that
                    country.&nbsp;Feeling soon spread to England, and culminated in the
                    Gordon&nbsp;riots of 1780. Meanwhile, however, strenuous efforts were&nbsp;being
                    made by the Roman Catholics to obtain relief by&nbsp;establishing a reasonable

                    was even at this time a&nbsp;more or less pronounced anti-Roman movement, a
                    reflection&nbsp;of the Gallican and Febronian tendencies on the
                    continent&nbsp;of Europe, and the “ Catholic Committee,” consisting for
                    the&nbsp;most part of influential laymen, which had been formed
                    to&nbsp;negotiate with the government, was prepared to go a

                    demanding the creation of a national hierarchy in merely&nbsp;nominal dependence
                    on Rome, and advocating the substitution&nbsp;of English for Latin in the
                    services. This attitude led to a&nbsp;somewhat prolonged conflict between the
                    Committee and&nbsp;the vicars apostolic, who for the most part represented
                    the&nbsp;high ultramontane view. The outcome of the Committee’s&nbsp;work was
                    the great Protest, signed by 1500 bishops, priests&nbsp;and leading laymen, in
                    which the loyalty of Catholics to the&nbsp;crown and constitution was
                    strenuously affirmed and the&nbsp;ultramontane point of view repudiated in the
                    startling declaration, “ We acknowledge no infallibility in the pope.” As
                    the&nbsp;result of the negotiations preceding and following this
                    action,&nbsp;the government in 1791 passed a bill relieving from all
                    their&nbsp;more vexatious disabilities those Roman Catholics@@2
                    who&nbsp;rejected the temporal authority of the pope; and during the&nbsp;first
                    quarter of the 19th century a scries of attempts was made&nbsp;to abolish
                    Catholic disabilities altogether. To this, however,&nbsp;George III. and his
                    successors were bitterly opposed; only&nbsp;in 1829 did George IV. give way, and
                    allow the passage of&nbsp;the Catholic Relief Act. This virtually removed all
                    restrictions on Catholics, except that it left them incapable of
                    filling&nbsp;the offices of Regent, Lord Chancellor, or Lord Lieutenant
                    of&nbsp;Ireland; and it expressly debarred their priests from sitting&nbsp;in
                    the House of Commons.</span></p>

                    Administration.—</span><span class="font1">During the reign of Elizabeth this
                    was necessarily in a chaotic state. As the Marian clergy&nbsp;died out, their
                    place was taken by priests trained at theological&nbsp;colleges established for
                    this purpose at Douai, Rome, Valladolid&nbsp;and other places. These were the “
                    seminary priests,” objects&nbsp;of great suspicion to the government. About 1580
                    Jesuit&nbsp;missionaries began to come, and soon became involved in
                    bitter&nbsp;quarrels with the secular missionaries already at work.
                    Mutual&nbsp;jealousies were only increased when the seculars were
                    grouped&nbsp;together under an arch-priest in 1599. Nor were matters
                    much&nbsp;bettered when· the papacy took advantage of the presence of
                    a&nbsp;Catholic queen in England, and sent over in 1625 a vicar-apostolic@@3—that
                    is, a prelate in episcopal orders, but without&nbsp;the full authority of a
                    diocesan bishop. He was soon compelled&nbsp;to withdraw, and the direction of
                    affairs fell to an intermittent&nbsp;series of papal envoys accredited to
                    Henrietta Maria or Catherine&nbsp;of Braganza. On the accession of James II. a
                    new vicar-apostolic—John Leyburne, bishop of Adrumetum </span><span

                    was&nbsp;divided into four districts—the London, Midland, Northern
                    and&nbsp;Western—each under a vicar-apostolic. This arrangement&nbsp;lasted till
                    1840, when the number of vicariates was doubled by&nbsp;the addition of the
                    Welsh, Eastern, Lancashire and Yorkshire&nbsp;districts. In 1850 came the “
                    restoration of the hierarchy ”&nbsp;by Pope Pius IX., when England was mapped
                    out into an archbishopric of Westminster @@<sup>4</sup> and twelve suffragan sees,
                    since increased to fifteen (sixteen including the Welsh see of
                    Menevia).&nbsp;This “ papal aggression ” caused great excitement at the
                    time,&nbsp;and an Ecclesiastical Titles Act was passed in 1851,
                    though&nbsp;never put in force, forbidding Roman Catholic prelates
