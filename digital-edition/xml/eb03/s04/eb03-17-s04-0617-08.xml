(Hermias), an eccleſiaſtical hiſtorian of the 5th century, was bom in Bethelia, a town of Paleſtine. He was educated for the law, and became a pleader at Conſtantinople. He wrote an A- bridgment of Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, in two books, from the aſcenſion of our Saviour to the year 323. This compendium is loſt ; but a continuation of it in nine books, written at greater length, down to the year 440, is ſtill extant. He ſeems to have copied Socrates, who wrote a hiſtory of the ſame period. The ſtyle of Sozomenus is perhaps more elegant ; but in other reſpects he falls far ſhort of that writer, diſplaying throughout his whole book an amazing credulity and a ſuperſtitious attachment to monks and the monaſtic life.
