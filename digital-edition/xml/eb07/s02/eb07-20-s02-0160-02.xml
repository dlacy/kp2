in <hi rend="italic">Ecclesiastical History,</hi> Christian heretics, who were so called because they paid divine worship to Seth, whom they looked upon as Jesus Christ the son of God, but who was made by a third divinity, and substituted in the room of the two families of Abel and Cain, which had been destroyed by the deluge. These heretics appeared in Egypt in the second century ; and as they were addicted to all sorts of debauchery, they did not want followers, and continued in Egypt above two hundred years.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
