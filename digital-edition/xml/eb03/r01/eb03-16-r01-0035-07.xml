(Francis), an Italian phyſician and polite ſcholar, was born at Arezzo in Tuſcany in 1626. Hie ingenuity and learning recommended him to the office of firſt phyſician to Ferdinand II. duke of Tuſcany ; and he contributed not a little toward the compiling of the Dictionary of La Crufca. He wrote upon vipers, upon the generation of infects, and compoſed a good deal of poetry. All his writings are in Italian ; and his language is fo fine and pure, that the authors of the Dictionary of La Crufca have often cited them as ſtan-dards of perfection. He died in 1697.</p>
