                18th century it was an orphan asylum, and is now a&nbsp;museum of classical

        <p><span class="font0">The Vatican palace originated in a residence built by Sym-machus

                become&nbsp;the fixed residence of the popes till after the return&nbsp;from Avignon
                in 1377. In 1415 John XXIII. connected the&nbsp;Vatican and the castle of S. Angelo
                by a covered passage carried&nbsp;on arches. But little of the existing palace is
                older than the&nbsp;15th century; Nicholas V. in 1447 began its reconstruction
                on&nbsp;a magnificenj scale, and this was carried on by Sixtus IV.&nbsp;(Sistine
                chapel), Alexander VI. (Torre Borgia), Julius II. and&nbsp;Leo X. (Bramante’s
                cortile and Raphael’s Loggie and Stanze),&nbsp;and Paul III. (Saia Regia and
                Cappella Paolina by Antonio da&nbsp;Sangallo). Sixtus V. and his successors built
                the lofty part&nbsp;of the palace on the east of Bramante’s cortile. The
                Scala&nbsp;Regia was built by Bernini for Urban VIII. and Alexander VII.,&nbsp;the
                Museo Pio-Clementino under Clement XIV. and Pius VI.,&nbsp;the Braccio Nuovo under

                architectural merit. It stands on the highest part of&nbsp;the hill, near the site

        <p><span class="font0">The only important church in Rome which is wholly Gothic in style is
                S. Maria sopra Minerva, the chief church of the Dominican&nbsp;order. This was not
                the work of a Roman architect, but&nbsp;was designed by two Dominican friars from
                Florence—Fra&nbsp;Ristori and Fra Sisto—about 1289, who were also
                the&nbsp;architects of their own church of S. Maria Novella. It much&nbsp;resembles
                the contemporary churches of the same order in Florence,&nbsp;having wide-spanned
                pointed arches on clustered piers and simple&nbsp;quadripartite vaulting. Its
                details resemble the early French in&nbsp;character.<sup>@@2</sup> It contains a
                large number of fine tombs; among them&nbsp;that of Durandus, bishop of Mende (the
                author of the celebrated&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Rationale divinorum officiorum),</span><span class="font0"> by Giovanni Cosma, c.
                1300, and&nbsp;the tomb of Fra Angelico, the great Dominican painter, who
                died&nbsp;in Rome, 1455. The most elaborate specimen of - ecclesiastical&nbsp;Gothic
                in Rome is that part of S. Maria in Ara Coeli which was rebuilt&nbsp;about 1300,
                probably by one of the Cosmati, namely, the south&nbsp;aisle and transept. During
                the 14th century (chiefly owing to the&nbsp;absence of the popes at Avignon) the
                arts were neglected at Rome,&nbsp;and a period of decadence set in. The sculptured
                effigy and reredos&nbsp;of Cardinal d’Alençon (d. 1403) in S. Maria in Trastevere,
                executed&nbsp;by a certain Paulus Romanus, is a fair example of the works
                produced&nbsp;during this period ; the effigy is a very clumsy and feeble copy of
                the</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">fine recumbent figures of the Cosmati.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Florentine Period, c.
            1450-1550.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The long period of almost complete artistic inactivity in Rome was
                broken in the 15th century by the introduction of a number&nbsp;of foreign artists,
                chiefly Florentines, who during this and the&nbsp;succeeding century enriched Rome
                with an immense number&nbsp;of magnificent works of art. The dawn of this brilliant
                epoch&nbsp;may be said to have begun with the arrival of Fra Angelico
                (see&nbsp;Fiesole) in 1447, invited by Nicholas V. to paint the walls of&nbsp;his
                small private chapel in the Vatican dedicated to S. Lorenzo.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">In the latter half of the 15th century a large number of sculptured
                tombs (as well as tabernacles, altar frontals, reredoses and the like) were made for
                Roman churches by&nbsp;sculptors from Tuscany and north Italy. The earliest&nbsp;of
                these tombs is that of Eugenius IV. (d. 1447) in&nbsp;S. Salvatore in Lauro, by
                Isaia da Pisa. It presents&nbsp;the typical form of a life-sized recumbent effigy
                resting on a&nbsp;richly ornamented sarcophagus over which is a canopy
                decorated&nbsp;with reliefs and statuettes. The type was brought to
                perfection&nbsp;by the Florentine Mino da Fiesole (see Mino di Giovanni),</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font0">who worked in Rome under Pius II. and succeeding popes, being
                    assisted in some cases by another artist of almost equal&nbsp;skill, Giovanni
                    Dalmata. A Lombard sculptor, Andrea Bregno,&nbsp;came to Rome under Paul If. and
                    worked there until the closing&nbsp;years of the century; his tomb is in S.
                    Maria Sopra Minerva.&nbsp;The works of these artists and their followers are to
                    be found&nbsp;in a great number of churches, notably S. Maria del
                        Popolo.<sup>@@3</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">The architecture no less than the sculpture of the latter part of
                    the 15th century was mainly the work of Florentines,&nbsp;especially of Baccio
                    Pontclli, who is said by Vasari to have&nbsp;built S. Maria del Popolo, S.
                        Agostino,<sup>@@4</sup> and S. Cosimato in&nbsp;Trastevere. He also was the
                    architect of S. Pietro in Montorio,&nbsp;erected in 1500 for Ferdinand and
                    Isabella of Spain. Other&nbsp;buildings were carried out by another Florentine,
                    Giuliano da&nbsp;Majano. The Palazzo di Venezia, begun for Cardinal
                    Barbo,&nbsp;afterwards Paul II., about 1455, a very massive and
                    stately&nbsp;building of medieval character, was built by Giuhano da
                    Sangallo&nbsp;and Francesco di Borgo San Sepolcro.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">During the latter part of the 15th and the first few years of the
                    succeeding century Rome was enriched with a number of buildings&nbsp;by Bramante
                    </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span
                    class="font0"> one of the greatest architects the&nbsp;world has ever seen. He
                    combined the delicacy of detail&nbsp;and the graceful lightness of the Gothic
                    style with the&nbsp;measured stateliness and rhythmical proportions of classic
                    architecture. Though he invariably used the round arch and took&nbsp;his
                    mouldings from antique sources, his beautiful cloisters and&nbsp;loggie are
                    Gothic in their general conception. Moreover, he never&nbsp;committed the
                    prevalent blunder, of the 16th century, which was&nbsp;a fruitless attempt to
                    obtain magnificence by mere size in a building,&nbsp;without multiplying its
                    parts. Hisprincipal works in Rome are the&nbsp;Palazzo della Cancelleria, built
                    for Cardinal Riario (1495-1505), with&nbsp;its stately church of S. Lorenzo in
                    Damaso; the so-called Palazzo di&nbsp;Bramante in the Governo Vecchio, built in
                    1500; and the Palazzo&nbsp;Giraud, near St Peter’s, once the residence of
                    Cardinal Wolsey,*&nbsp;built in 1503. He also built the cortile of S. Damaso in
                    the Vatican,&nbsp;the toy-like tempietto in the cloister of S. Pietro in
                    Montorio (1502),&nbsp;and the cloisters of S. Maria della Pace
                        (1504).<sup>@@5</sup> In 1503 Bramante&nbsp;was appointed architect to St
                    Peter’s, and made complete designs&nbsp;for it, with -a plan in the form of a
                    Greek cross. The piers and arches&nbsp;of the central dome were the only parts
                    completed at the time of his&nbsp;death in 1514, and subsequent architects did
                    not carry out his design.<sup>@@6</sup></span></p>

                designs.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">His later works bear traces of that decadence in taste which so
                    soon began, owing mainly to the rapidly growing love for&nbsp;the dull
                    magnificence of the pseudo-classic style. This falling off in&nbsp;architectural
                    taste was due to Michelangelo </span><span class="font0"

                    any&nbsp;other one man. His cortile of the Farnese palace, though a work&nbsp;of
                    much stately beauty, was one of the first stages towards that
                    lifeless&nbsp;scholasticism and blind following of.antique forms which were
                    the&nbsp;destruction of architecture as a real living art, and in the

                    16th&nbsp;century, a large number of fine palaces and churches were built in
