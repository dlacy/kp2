The main ribs of the roof have a clear&nbsp;span of 170 ft. and are placed 34 ft. apart. They are of box-girder form and measure 7 ft. deep and 2 ft. wide. The gallery&nbsp;around the hall is 40 ft. wide on three sides and 26 ft. wide&nbsp;on the remaining side. It is covered by a lean-to roof which&nbsp;abuts against the curved ribs on the north and south sides,&nbsp;and is attached to horizontal members of the screens on the&nbsp;east and west sides. The bricks walls of the building are not&nbsp;called upon to resist any portion of the thrust from the roof,&nbsp;as the side frames through which the gallery floor passes form&nbsp;a self-contained system of steelwork in which the thrust is&nbsp;ultimately conveyed to the ground. The screens which close&nbsp;the semicircular ends of the roof are of vertical ridge and furrow&nbsp;construction, as can be clearly seen in the illustrations, this&nbsp;form offering great resistance to wind pressure while at the&nbsp;same time requiring a minimum amount of material. Of the&nbsp;two illustrations, fig. n is a detailed cross-section showing&nbsp;fully the method of construction of the foot of the main&nbsp;rib and column, and the arrangement of the side frames&nbsp;above referred to is shown in fig. 12, which is a complete cross-section view, and will convey to the reader some&nbsp;idea of the vast size of the building and its general proportions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The following five roofs are examples of large span: Crystal Palace (104 ft.); Olympia, London (170 ft.); §t Enoch station,&nbsp;Glasgow (198 ft.); Central station, Manchester (210 ft.); St&nbsp;Paneras station, London (240 ft.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Domes may be framed up with wood rafters cut to shape. For small spans this construction is satisfactory, but when&nbsp;the dome is of considerable size it is often framed&nbsp;in steel as being stronger and more rigid than wood,&nbsp;and therefore not exerting so great a thrust upon&nbsp;the supporting walls. The outer dome of St Paul’s cathedral&nbsp;in London is of lead-covered wood, framed upon and supported&nbsp;by a conical structure of brickwork which is raised above the&nbsp;inner dome of brick. Concrete is a very suitable material for&nbsp;use in the construction of domes, and may be employed simply&nbsp;or with iron or steel reinforcement in the shape of wires, bars&nbsp;or perforated plates. One of the best modern examples of&nbsp;concrete vaulting and domical roofing without metal reinforcement occurs in the Roman Catholic cathedral at Westminster, a remarkable building designed by Mr J. F. Bentley.&nbsp;A few details of the roofs will be interesting. The circle&nbsp;developed by the pendentives of the nave domes is 60 ft. in&nbsp;diameter. The thickness of the domes at the springing is 3 ft.&nbsp;gradually reduced to 13 in. at the crown; the curve of equilibrium is therefore well within the material. The domes were&nbsp;turned on closely boarded centring in a series of superimposed&nbsp;rings of concrete averaging 4 ft. in width. The concrete is&nbsp;not reinforced in any way. The independent external covering&nbsp;of the domes is formed of 3 in. artificial stone slabs cast to&nbsp;the curve. They rest on radiating ribs 5 in. deep of similar&nbsp;material fixed on the concrete and rebated to receive the slabs;&nbsp;thus an air space of 2 in. is left between the inner shell and&nbsp;the outer covering, the object being to render the temperature&nbsp;of the interior more uniform.
