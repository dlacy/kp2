<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">twelve minutes was accomplished with a train of sixteen carriages, making a speed of 75 miles j&gt;er hour. The engine has taken a&nbsp;train of thirty-three carriages full of passengers from Doncaster to&nbsp;Scarborough and back at an average speed of 45 miles per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">It is capable of moving a gross weight, including engine, tender, and train, of 356 tons on a level at a speed of 45 miles per hour.&nbsp;The average results of the regular performance of seven engines&nbsp;of this class between Doncaster, Peterborough, and London for&nbsp;the third quarter of 1884 show that a train of twelve six-wheeled&nbsp;carriages weighing 13 tons each was taken at a speed of from 50 to&nbsp;53 miles per hour, for a consumption of 25¿ lb of coal per mile&nbsp;run and five pints of oil per 100 miles run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Four-coupled locomotives, having the cylinders inside, and four wheels coupled “in front,” with a pair of hind or trailing wheels,&nbsp;are known as “mixed engines,”—that is to say, engines adapted&nbsp;for either passenger traffic or goods traffic,—a generally useful type.&nbsp;In one example the cylinders are 16 inches in diameter, with a&nbsp;stroke of 22 inches ; the coupled wheels are 5 feet in diameter.&nbsp;The weight of the engine is 244 tons, of which 20 tons are driving&nbsp;weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The next engine to be noticed is a generally useful engine, four-coupled “behind,” for passenger traffic, such, for instance, as that with inclined fire-grate and sloping fire-box designed by Mr J. J.&nbsp;Cudworth for service on the South-Eastern Railway. Chi a wheelbase of 15 feet the weight of the engine—30£ tons—is so distributed&nbsp;that 10| tons fall at each pair of driving-wheels and 94 tons at the&nbsp;leading wheels. The cylinders are inside, 16 inches in diameter,&nbsp;with 24 inches of stroke and 6-feet driving-wheels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Another express passenger locomotive, having inside cylinders and four-coupled wheels behind, for service on the London and&nbsp;North-Western Railway, has cylinders 17 inches in diameter, with&nbsp;24 inches of stroke, and 6 feet 7 inch driving wheels. The engine&nbsp;weighs 29| tons, of which 11 are at the middle wheels, 8f at the&nbsp;hind wheels, and 94 at the front; thus the driving weight amounts&nbsp;to two-thirds of the total weight. This engine can move a gross&nbsp;weight of 293 tons, comprising engine, tender, and train, on a level&nbsp;at a speed of 45 miles per hour, with a working pressure of 120 lb&nbsp;per square inch in the boiler. With trains averaging ten carriages&nbsp;the consumption of coal is 26| lb per mile run.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A tank locomotive is an engine which carries its supply of fuel and water with it on its own frame, dispensing with the tender.&nbsp;Such engines are mticli used for short traffic, as well as for shunting&nbsp;and marshalling trains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The four-coupled tank engine (fig. 41) used for the passenger</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">traffic of the Metropolitan Railway has four wheels coupled behind and a bogie in front. This engine weighs in working order 45£&nbsp;tons, of which about 35 tons are utilized as driving weight, making&nbsp;17| tons for one pair of wheels,—about the greatest load on one&nbsp;pair of wheels anywhere. The regular duty of this engine is to take&nbsp;a train of six carriages capable of holding in all 432 passengers,&nbsp;and weighing in themselves 13 tons each, at an average speed,&nbsp;including stoppages, of 18 miles per hour, consuming 37 lb of&nbsp;Welsh coal per train mile run. Whilst passing through the&nbsp;tunnels or covered ways the exhaust steam from the engine is&nbsp;condensed in large tanks carried on the engine, filled with cold&nbsp;water. The quantity of condensing water consumed is 900 gallons&nbsp;for half the journey, or every 6¿ miles ; it is raised to 200° Fahr.&nbsp;temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The eight-wheeled tank engine (fig. 42) has been designed by Mr</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">T. W. Worsdell to work the heavy suburban metropolitan traffic of the Great Eastern Railway,—the ordinary trains in this service being&nbsp;composed of fifteen or twenty close-coupled carriages, taken over&nbsp;steep gradients and sharp curves. For this purpose the fore and</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">hind axles are radially mounted, as before explained, to take the curves with facility, the engine running either end first. The&nbsp;engine weighs 52 tons in working order, and of these 30 tons are&nbsp;driving weight placed on the two pairs of coupled driving-wheels.&nbsp;With large cylinders 18 inches in diameter, and driving-wheels&nbsp;only 5 feet 4 inches in diameter, the engine is adapted for starting&nbsp;promptly, which it is required to do in order to keep time between&nbsp;closely placed stations. Every stop is made by the Westinghouse&nbsp;brake, with which the engine is fitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Locomotives for drawing heavy goods trains, though not heavier than the most powerful passenger locomotives, can take goods&nbsp;trains of great weight. Six-coupled goods engines, with 17-inch&nbsp;cylinders and driving-wheels 5 feet in diameter, weighing 32 tons&nbsp;in working order, can take a train weighing 360 tons on a level at&nbsp;a speed of 25 miles per hour, consuming from 40 to 45 lb of coal&nbsp;per mile run with trains. The Fairlie engine (fig. 43) is placed on</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">two bogies or swivelling trucks, the foremost of which carries the cylinders and propelling gear and the hindmost the tank and coal-boxes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The longest distance run without stopping, combined with the' highest speed, is performed on the Great Northern Railway, between !&nbsp;Grantham and King’s Cross, 105J miles, in 1 hour 58 minutes, at&nbsp;the rate of 53£ miles per hour. The Great Western Company run&nbsp;from Paddington to Swindon—77£ miles—in 1 hour 27 minutes,&nbsp;being at the rate of 53¿ miles per hour. On the London and&nbsp;North-Western Railway the distance—77| miles—from Willesden&nbsp;to Rugby is run in 1 hour 28 minutes, at the rate of 52f miles per&nbsp;hour. The average rate of express and mail passenger trains on&nbsp;this line is 40 miles per hour or more. Parliamentary trains, calling at all stations, run at an average speed of from 19 to 28 miles&nbsp;per hour. Express goods trains attain a speed of from 20 to 25&nbsp;miles per hour. The speed of coal trains is limited, as far as&nbsp;possible, to 15 miles per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The coal trains on the London and North-Western, Midland, and Great Northern Railways generally consist of from thirty to&nbsp;thirty-five waggons, weighing from 5 to 54 tons each, and carrying a load of 8 tons of coal. At this rate the total load of coal&nbsp;for thirty-five waggons weighs 280 tons, and, adding the weight&nbsp;of the brake-van at the end of the train, 10 tons 17 cwt., the&nbsp;maximum gross weight of train is 483 tons 7 cwt., as on the&nbsp;Great Northern Railway. This train is taken by a goods engine&nbsp;with six-coupled wheels 54 feet in diameter, having two steam&nbsp;cylinders 174 inches in diameter, with a stroke of 26 inches, and&nbsp;a pressure of 140 lb per square inch in the boiler. The locomotive weighs in working order 36 tons 18 cwt., and the tender&nbsp;with fuel and water 30 tons 17 cwt., making together 67 tons 15&nbsp;cwt. for the locomotive and tender. The gross weights are as&nbsp;follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Tons, cwts</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Train, thirty-five vehicles (waggons, load, and brake-van). .4S3 7</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Engine and tender, in full working order.................. 67 15</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Engine, tender, and train ................................551 2</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">These large coal trains are taken at a speed of IS miles per hour, on ascending inclines of 1 in 178 at 10 miles per hour. The consumption of coal as fuel in the engine is at the rate of 45 lb per mile&nbsp;run, including the coal consumed in getting up steam. Mr Patrick&nbsp;Stirling, the locomotive engineer of the Great Northern Railway,&nbsp;has also designed and constructed still more powerful engines,&nbsp;having six-coupled 5-feet wheels, with cylinders 19 inches in&nbsp;diameter and of 28 inches stroke. These engines are capable of&nbsp;taking a train of forty-nine loaded coal-waggons, weighing with&nbsp;brake-van 672j tons. Including the weight of the engine and&nbsp;tender the total gross load is, say, 740 tons, taken with a consumption of 50 lb of coal per mile run. This is probably the most&nbsp;extraordinary example of a dead pull on an ascending incline of 1&nbsp;in 178. It is equivalent to a gross weight of 1816 tons on a level.&nbsp;It was found that this train was too long for some of the sidings,&nbsp;besides fouling both the level crossings in the city of Lincoln; hence&nbsp;the train was reduced in number to forty-five waggons. Six-coupled&nbsp;goods-engines of the usual proportions, working at full power,&nbsp;exert a tractive force of from 5 to 6 tons in the direction of the&nbsp;rails, equal to the movement of a gross weight of engine, tender,&nbsp;and train of from 1240 to 1500 tons on a level straight line at a&nbsp;speed of 15 miles per hour, or to from 386 to 463 tons on a level</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
