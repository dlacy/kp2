<p><span class="font0">in 1872. After a long convalescence, she published in 1874 two works of minor importance,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Domini</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Speaking</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Likenesses.</span><span class="font0"> The former is the earliest of a series of theological works in prose, of which the second was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seek and Find</span><span class="font0"> in 1879.&nbsp;In 1881 she puhlished a third collection of poems, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Pageant,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in which there was evidence of slackening lyrical power. She&nbsp;now gave herself almost entirely to religious disquisition. The&nbsp;most interesting and personal of her prose publications (but it&nbsp;contained verse also) was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Time Flies</span><span class="font0"> (1885)—a sort of symbolic&nbsp;diary or collection of brief homilies. In 1890 the S.P.C.K.&nbsp;published a volume of her religious verse. She collected her&nbsp;poetical writings in 1891. In 1892 she was led to publish a&nbsp;very bulky commentary on the Apocalypse, entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Face&nbsp;of the Deep.</span><span class="font0"> After this she wrote little. Her last years were&nbsp;spent in retirement at 30 Torrington Square, Bloomsbury,&nbsp;which was her home from 1876 to her death. In 1892 her health&nbsp;broke down finally, and she had to endure terrible suffering.&nbsp;From this she was released on the 29th of December 1894. Her&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New Poems*</span><span class="font0"> were published posthumously in 1896. In spite&nbsp;of her manifest limitations of sympathy and experience,&nbsp;Christina Rossetti takes rank among the foremost poets of&nbsp;her time. In the purity and solidity of her finest lyrics, the&nbsp;glow and music in which she robes her moods of melancholy&nbsp;reverie, her extraordinary mixture of austerity with sweetness&nbsp;and of sanctity of tone with sensuousness of colour, Christina&nbsp;Rossetti, in her best pieces, may challenge comparison with&nbsp;the most admirable of our poets. The union of fixed religious&nbsp;faith with a hold upon physical beauty and the richer parts of&nbsp;nature has been pointed to as the most original feature of her&nbsp;poetry. Hers was a cloistered spirit, timid, riun-like, bowed&nbsp;down by suffering and humility; her character was so retiring&nbsp;as to be almost invisible. All that we really need to know&nbsp;about her, save that she was a great saint, was that she was&nbsp;a great poet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E. G.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROSSETTI, DANTE GABRIEL (1828-1882), English poet and painter, whose full baptismal name was Gabriel Charles&nbsp;Dante, was born on the 12th of May 1828, at 38 Charlotte&nbsp;Street, Portland Place, London. He was the first of the two&nbsp;sons and the second of the four children of Gabriele Rossetti&nbsp;(1783-1854), an Italian poet and liberal, who, about 1824,&nbsp;after many vicissitudes connected with the part he played in&nbsp;the Naples reform movement against Ferdinand I., came to&nbsp;England, where he married in 1826 Frances Mary Polidori&nbsp;(d. 1886), sister of Byron’s physician, Dr John Polidori, and&nbsp;daughter of a Tuscan, Gaetano Polidori, who had in early&nbsp;youth been Alfieri’s secretary and who had married an English&nbsp;lady. In 1831 he became professor of Italian in King’s College,&nbsp;London, and afterwards achieved a recognized position as a&nbsp;subtle and original, if eccentric, commentator on Dante. In&nbsp;1852 he published a volume of Italian religious poems. His&nbsp;family, besides Dante Gabriel, consisted of Maria Francesca&nbsp;(1827-1876), who eventually entered an Anglican sisterhood—&nbsp;she is known to Dante scholars by her valuable </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Shadow of&nbsp;Dante\</span><span class="font0"> William Michael (b. 1829), a well-known man of&nbsp;letters who from 1845 to 1894 was in the Inland Revenue&nbsp;Office—he married a daughter of Ford Madox Brown; and&nbsp;Christina (tf.v.), the poet. The literary spirit was strongly&nbsp;entrenched here; and the talent which was always distinguished&nbsp;in William Michael rose to the height of rare genius in Dante&nbsp;Gabriel and Christina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Dante Rossetti’s education was begun at a private school in Foley Street, Portland Place, where he remained, however,&nbsp;only nine months, from the autumn of 1835 to the summer of&nbsp;1836. He next went (in the autumn of 1836) to King’s College&nbsp;School, where he remained till the summer of 1843, having&nbsp;reached the fourth class. From early childhood he had displayed&nbsp;a marked propensity for drawing and painting. It had therefore from the first been tacitly assumed that his future career&nbsp;would be an artistic one, and he left school early. In Latin,&nbsp;however, he was already fairly proficient for his age; French&nbsp;he knew well; Italian he had spoken from childhood, and he&nbsp;had some German lessons about 1844-45. But, although he&nbsp;learned enough German to be able to translate the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arme&nbsp;Heinrich</span><span class="font0"> of Hartmann von Aue, and some portions of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nibelungenlicd,</span><span class="font0"> he afterwards forgot the language almost&nbsp;entirely. His Greek too, such as it had been, he lost. On&nbsp;leaving school he went (1843) to Cary’s Art Academy (previously&nbsp;called Sass’s), near Bedford Square, and thence obtained&nbsp;admission to the Royal Academy Antique School towards 1846.&nbsp;Of the artistic education of foreign travel Rossetti had very&nbsp;little. But in early life he made a short tour in Belgium,&nbsp;where he was indubitably much impressed and influenced by&nbsp;the works of Van Eyck at Ghent and Memling at Bruges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">[It may be convenient to interpolate here a continuous account of Rossetti’s career as a pictorial artist. Being&nbsp;much impressed by some of the early works of Ford Madox&nbsp;Brown exhibited at the Academy (1841), Westminster Hall&nbsp;(1844-45) and the British Institution (1845), he sought from&nbsp;that master of technique technical instruction of a more direct&nbsp;and stringent kind than he had previously submitted to.&nbsp;Brown, ever generous in that way, undertook without a fee&nbsp;the training of Rossetti as a painter, and set him to work&nbsp;upon such rudimentary studies as pickle-pots and other “ still-life.” The pupil’s course of such work was, as might be expected, short; the master’s example and that of Millais,&nbsp;together with the uncompromising energy of Holman Hunt,&nbsp;with both of whom Rossetti became intimate about this time,&nbsp;helping and encouraging him. Most of all, perhaps, so far&nbsp;as his temporary impressions were concerned, a picture of&nbsp;Brown’s which was shown at the “ Free Exhibition,” Hyde&nbsp;Park Corner, in the spring of 1848 profoundly affected Rossetti.&nbsp;This was, of course, months before the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood in the autumn of the last-named&nbsp;year, when five painter-students, a sculptor (Thomas Woolner)&nbsp;and a layman (W. M. Rossetti) agreed upon certain principles&nbsp;they desired should obtain in art. None of the five owed&nbsp;the initiative of his views to any of the others or to Brown,&nbsp;whose impulse was purely technical and connected with&nbsp;Rossetti only; neither Millais, Holman Hunt, J. Collinson&nbsp;nor F. G. Stephens needed the help of Madox Brown. The&nbsp;point of Pre-Raphaelite crystallization which had so great&nbsp;though brief an influence upon Rossetti’s life and art was&nbsp;found at a chance meeting of Rossetti, Millais and Holman&nbsp;Hunt in Millais’s house in Gower Street, where certain prints&nbsp;from early Italian frescoes were studied. The enthusiasm&nbsp;of Rossetti led him to propose the formation of a “ Brotherhood ” with more or less definite views and much loftier aims&nbsp;than artists generally venture to announce. This took effect;&nbsp;the views of the remaining three men were already known,&nbsp;and in a few days they joined the new society and took their&nbsp;shares in the obloquy which attended the doings of Millais,&nbsp;Hunt and Collinson. Brown, though ‘ invited, declined to&nbsp;become a P-R.B. Rossetti’s first effort was by means of <sup>u</sup> The&nbsp;Girlhood of Mary, Virgin,” which in March 1849 was exhibited&nbsp;at Hyde Park Corner. It was a picture which attested the&nbsp;prodigious value of his studies since the previous October,&nbsp;and the native genius of the painter and the sincere passion&nbsp;with which he had accepted the obligations of Pre-Raphaelitism,&nbsp;as they were then, but not for long, understood. Nothing of&nbsp;his producing was more independent than the inception of&nbsp;“ The Girlhood of Mary, Virgin ”; indeed the design for it&nbsp;was made some half a year before the meeting in Gower Street,&nbsp;though the execution of this work owed not a h'ttle to the&nbsp;influence, if not the actual help, of Millais and Hunt. Its&nbsp;mysticism was Rossetti’s own, its technique owed something&nbsp;to Brown. On the whole, there can be no doubt that in this&nbsp;work was the first pronouncement of a new view of art, a fresh&nbsp;technique and power rapidly developing itself. .Of course,&nbsp;the style of this noteworthy and epoch-marking picture was</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
