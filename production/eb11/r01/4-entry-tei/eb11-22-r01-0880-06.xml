It lies on the wide Ramsey Bay, at the mouth of the Sulby river, the estuary of which forms a small harbour. To the north and west the country is flat, but to the south the lower slopes of the North Ballure hill rise sharply. A creek of the Sulby river on the north side of the town is formed into a* picturesque lake. The Queenâ€™s pier permits of the landing of passengers at all times, and Ramsey is served by</p>

The shore of the bay is sandy and gently sloping, and excellent bathing is afforded. A golf links, a geological and antiquarian museum, the Mooragh Park by the side of the lake, and the palace or concert hall, are among the attractions to visitors. Ramsey is connected with Laxey, the summit of Snaefell, and Douglas by electric tramway, and has connexion with the western part of the island by the Manx Northern railway. The Albert tower, on a wooded hill above the town, commemorating a visit of the Prince Consort in 1847, is <hi rend="sup"/> a favourite view-point. The harbour has some coasting and fishing trade.</p>
