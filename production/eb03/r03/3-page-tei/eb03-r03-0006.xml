The compreffion which BC muſt ſuſtain in order to give the ſame ſupport to the rafters at B and C that was given by braces properly placed, is conſiderably greater than the compreſſion of the braces. And this ſtrain is an addition to the tranſverſe ſtrain which BC gets from its own load. Alſo this form neceſſarily expoſes the tie-beam to croſs ftrains. If BE is mortiſed into the tie-beam, then the ſtrain which tends to depreſs the angle ABC preſſes on the tie-beam at E tranſverſely, while a contrary ſtrain acts on F, pulling it upwards. Theſe ftrains however are ſmall ; and this conſtruction is frequently uſed, being ſuſceptible of ſufficient ſtrength, without much increaſe of the dimenſibns of the timbers ; and it has the great advantage of giving free room in the garrets. Were it not for this, there is a much more perfect form repreſented in fig. 19. Here the two poſts BE, CF are united below. All tranſverſe action on the tie-beam is now entirely removed. We are almoſt diſpoſed to ſay that this is the ſtrongeſt roof of the ſame width and ilope : for if the iron ſtrap which connects the pieces BE, CF with the tie-beam have a large bolt G through it, confining it to one point of the beam, there are five points A, B, C, D, G, which cannot change their places, and there is no tranſverſe ſtrain in any of the connections.</p><p>When the dimenſions of the building are very great, ſo that the pieces AB, BC, CD, would be thought too weak for withſtanding the croſs ftrains, braces may be added as is expreſſed in fig. 18. by the dotted lines. The reader will obſerve that it is not meant to leave the top flat externally : it muſt be raiſed a little in the middle to ſhoot off the rain. But this muſt not be done by incurvating the beam BC. This would ſoon be cruſhed, and ſpring upwards. The ſlopes muſt be given by pieces of timber added above the ſtrutting beam.</p><p>And thus we have completed a frame of a roof. It conſiſts of theſe principal members : The rafters, which are immediately loaded with the covering; the tie-beam, which withſtands the horizontal thruſt by wſhich the roof tends to fly out below and puſh out the walls ; the king-pofts, which hang from fixed points and ferve to uphold the tie-beam, and alſo to afford other fixed points on wſhich we may reft the braces which ſupport the middle of the rafters ; and laſtly the truſs or ſtrut-ting-beam, which ſerves to give mutual abutment to the different parts which are at a diſtance from each either. The rafters, braces, and truſſes are expoſed to compreffion, and muſt therefore have not only coheſion but ſtiſſneſs. For if they bend, the prodigious compreſſions to which they are ſubjected would quickly cruſh them in this bended ſtate. The tie-beams and king-pofts, if performing no other office but ſupport-ing the roof, do not require ſtiſſneſs, and their places might be ſupplied by ropes, or by rods of iron of one-tenth part of the lection that even the ſmalleſt oak ſtretcher requires. Theſe members require no greater dimenſions than what is neceſſary for giving ſufficient joints, and any more is a needleſs expence and k&gt;ad. All roofs, however complicated, conſiſt of theſe eſſential parts, and if pieces of timber are to be ſeea which perform none of theſe offices, they muſt be pro· nounced uſeleſs, and they are frequently hurtful, by producing croſs ftrains in i’ome other piece. In a rool properly conſtructed there ſhould be no ſuch ſtrains. All the timbers, except thoſe which immediately carry the covering, ſhould be either puſhed or drawn in the direction of their length. And this is the rule by which a roof ſhould alw<hi rend="sup">r</hi>ays be examined.</p><p>Theſe eſſential parts are ſuſceptible of numberleſs combinations and varieties. But it is a prudent maxim to make the conſtruction as ſimple, and conſiſtſhg of as few parts, as poſſible. We areleſs expoſed to the imperfections of workmanſhip, ſuch as looſe joints, &amp;c. Another eſſential harm ariſes from many pieces, by the compreſſion and the ſhrinking of the timber in the croſs direction of the libres. The effect of this is equivalent to the ſhortening of the piece which butts on the joint. This alters the proportions of the lides of the triangle on which the lhape of the whole depends. Now in a roof ſuch as fig. 18. there is twice as much of this as in the plain pent roof, becauſe there are tw<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>o poſts. And when the direction of the butting pieces is very oblique to the action of the load, a ſmall ſhrinking permits a great change of ſhape. Thus in a roof of what is called pediment pitch, where the rafters make an angle of 30 degrees with the horizon, half an inch compreſſion of the king-poſt will produce a fagging of an inch, and occaſion a great ſtrain on the tie-beam if the poſts are mortiſed into it. In fig. 2. of the roofs in the article Architecture, half an inch ſhrinking of each of the two poſts will allow the middle to ſagg above five inches. Fig. ι. of the ſame plate is faulty in this reſpect, by cutting the ſtrutting-beam in the middle. <hi rend="sup">r</hi>Γhe ſtrutting-beam is thus ſhortened by three ſhrinkings, while there is but one to ſhorten the rafters. The conſequence is, that the truſs which is included within the rafters will ſagg away from them, and then they muſt bend in the middle till they again reft on this included truſs. This roof is, however, conſtructed on the whole on good principles, and we adduce it only tα ſhow the advantages of ſimplicity. This cutting of the truſſing-beam is unavoidable, if we would preſerve the king-poſt. But we are in doubt whether the ſervice performed by it in this caſe will balance the inconvenience. It is employed only to ſupport the middle of the upper half of each rafter, which it does but imperfectly, becauſe the braces and ſtrut muſt be cut hall through at their croſſing : if theſe joints are made tight, as a workman would wiſh to do, the ſettling of the roof will cauſe them to work on each other croſſwiſe with inſuperable force, and will undoubtedly ſtrain them exceedingly.</p><p>This method of including a truſs within the rafters of a pent roof is a very conſiderable addition to the ai t of carpentry. But to inſure its full effect, it ſhould always be executed in the manner repreſented in fig. 1. Plate XLVIII. with butting rafters under the principal ones, butting on joggles in the heads of the poſts. Without this the ſtrut-Seam is hardly of any ſervice. We would therefore recommend fig. 20. as a proper conſtruction of a truſſed roof, and the king-poſt which is placed in it may be employed to ſupport the upper part of the rafters, and alſo for preventing the ſtrut-beam from bending in either-direction in conſequence of its great compreſſion. It will alſo give a ſuſpenlion for the great burdens which are ſometimes neceſſary in</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
