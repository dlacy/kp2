<p><span class="font0">suffers hunger, and, being leagued with the devil, only thirsts for the blood of souls.” In 1142 we find Arnold a&nbsp;wanderer in Switzerland, and then, suddenly reappearing&nbsp;in Italy, he arrived in Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Three different elements entered into his nature and inspired his eloquence—an exalted and mystic temperament, a great and candid admiration for classic antiquity&nbsp;added to an equal admiration for republican freedom&nbsp;independent of the church and the empire, and a profound conviction, derived from the Vaudois and Paterine&nbsp;doctrines, that the church could only be purified by the&nbsp;renunciation of temporal wealth. Finding Rome already&nbsp;revolutionized in accordance with his own ideas, he&nbsp;immediately began to preach there. His mystic exhortations against the riches of the church had an inflammatory&nbsp;effect, while his classical reminiscences aroused the enthusiasm of the Romans, and his suggestion that they should&nbsp;imitate the republican institutions of Upper Italy met the&nbsp;necessities of the time that had created the revolution.&nbsp;He urged the reconstitution of the ancient senate and&nbsp;senatorial order, which indeed was already partially&nbsp;accomplished, and of the ancient equestrian order, and the&nbsp;reconstruction and fortification of the Capitol. His proposed senate was a body somewhat resembling the communal councils of Upper Italy, his equestrian order a&nbsp;mounted force composed of the lesser nobility, since at&nbsp;Rome, as elsewhere, the lower classes had neither time nor&nbsp;means to form part of it. All his suggestions were&nbsp;accepted ; the citizens laboured strenuously on the fortification of the Capitol. The pope soon beheld the revolution&nbsp;spread beyond the walls, and several cities of the state&nbsp;proclaimed their independence. The barons of the Cam-pagna profited by the opportunity to act as independent&nbsp;sovereigns. Thus the whole domain of the church was&nbsp;threatened with dissolution. The pope marched towards&nbsp;Rome with his newly gathered army, but hoped to come&nbsp;to terms. The Romans in fact recognized his authority,&nbsp;and he in his turn recognized the republic. The office of&nbsp;patrician was abolished, and seems to have been replaced&nbsp;by that of gonfalonier, and the prefect, answering to the&nbsp;podestà of the other republics, was revived. The senators&nbsp;received investiture from the pope, who returned to Rome&nbsp;at Christmas 1145.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The republic now seems to have been fully constituted. The senate was drawn from the lower classes and the petty&nbsp;nobility, and this was the special characteristic of the new&nbsp;revolution. In 1144 there were fifty-six senators, probably four to each of the fourteen regions, but the number&nbsp;often varied. By the few existing documents of the&nbsp;period we notice that the senators were divided into&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Senatores COnsiliarii</span><span class="font0"> and ordinary senators. The former&nbsp;constituted a smaller council, which, like the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Credtnza</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;lesser council found in other cities, consulted with the head&nbsp;or heads of the republic on the more urgent and secret&nbsp;affairs of the state. And, conjointly with the rest of the&nbsp;senators, it formed the greater council. Thus classic&nbsp;traditions were identified with new republican usages, and&nbsp;the commonwealth of Rome resembled those in other parts&nbsp;of Italy. But, of course, every republic had special local&nbsp;customs of its own. So the Roman senate had judicial&nbsp;as well as political attributes, and there was a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curia&nbsp;senatus</span><span class="font0"> composed of senators and legal experts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As was easily to be foreseen, the agreement with the pope was of short duration. The revolution could not be&nbsp;checked ; the Romans desired independence, and their&nbsp;spiritual lord fled to France, whence, in 1147, he proclaimed a new crusade, while the Romans were employed&nbsp;in demolishing Tivoli, banishing its inhabitants, and&nbsp;waging war on other cities. Giordano Pierleone was&nbsp;gonfalonier and head of the republic, and Arnold, supported by the popular favour and the enthusiasm of the&nbsp;lower clergy, was preaching with even greater fervour&nbsp;than before. But the pope now re-entered Italy, proclaimed Arnold a schismatic, and then advancing to&nbsp;Tusculum assembled an army in order to attack Rome.&nbsp;In this emergency the Romans applied to Conrad III.,&nbsp;the first emperor of the house of Hohenstaufen ; and their&nbsp;urgent letters are clearly expressive of Arnold’s theories&nbsp;and his medley of ancient and modern, sacred and profane,&nbsp;ideas. “Rome,” so they said, “is the fountain of the&nbsp;empire confided to you by the Almighty, and we seek to&nbsp;restore to Rome the power possessed by her under&nbsp;Constantine and Justinian. For this end we conquered&nbsp;and destroyed the strongholds of the barons who, together&nbsp;with the pope and the Normans, sought to resist us.&nbsp;These are now attacking us on all sides. Haste to Rome,&nbsp;the capital of the world, thus to establish thy imperial&nbsp;sway over the Italian and German lands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After long hesitation the king of the Romans at last replied to these appeals, stating that he would come “ to&nbsp;re-establish order, reward the faithful, and punish the&nbsp;rebellious.” These words promised ill. In fact Conrad&nbsp;had already arranged terms with the pope ; but his life&nbsp;came to an end on the 15th February 1152.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was succeeded by Frederick I. surnamed Barbarossa, who took no notice of the numerous letters urging him to&nbsp;come and receive the empire from the Roman people, which&nbsp;alone had the right of conferring it. In accordance with&nbsp;his design of subduing all the independent cities, he made&nbsp;an agreement with the pope, in which he vowed to give no&nbsp;truce to the Romans, but subject them to their spiritual&nbsp;lord, whose temporal power should be restored. The pope,&nbsp;on his side, promised to crown him emperor. Thereupon&nbsp;the people again rose to arms, and Arnold broke off all&nbsp;negotiations with Eugenius III. The senate was reorganized, formed of one hundred members, and, according&nbsp;to the old Roman precedent, had two consuls, one for internal and the other for external affairs. Frederick was a&nbsp;daring statesman, a valiant soldier in command of a&nbsp;powerful army, and was no friend of half measures.&nbsp;Accordingly the nobles ventured on reaction. Finally, to&nbsp;increase the gravity of the situation, an English pope,&nbsp;Hadrian IV., was elected (1154—59), who was also a&nbsp;man of strong and resolute temper. In fact, even before&nbsp;being able to take possession of the Lateran, he requested&nbsp;the Romans to banish Arnold, who, with greater eloquence&nbsp;than ever, was directing his thunders against the papacy.&nbsp;These utterances increased the wrath of Hadrian, who,&nbsp;encouraged by the knowledge that Frederick and his host&nbsp;were already in Italy, at last launched an interdict against&nbsp;Rome. It was the first time that a pope had ventured to&nbsp;curse the Eternal City. The interdict put a summary stop&nbsp;to the religious life of the inhabitants. Men’s minds were&nbsp;seized with a sudden terror, and a fierce tumult broke out.&nbsp;Thereupon the senators, whose opposition to the pope was&nbsp;less courageous than that of the fallen magnates, prostrated&nbsp;themselves at his feet and implored pardon. But&nbsp;Hadrian demanded the expulsion of Arnold before&nbsp;consenting to raise the interdict. Arnold was therefore&nbsp;obliged to leave Rome. After having for nine years&nbsp;preached successfully in favour of liberty, after having&nbsp;been the moving spirit of the new revolution, the new constitution, he was now abandoned by all, and forced to&nbsp;wander from castle to castle, in the hope of reaching some&nbsp;independent city capable of shielding him from the fierce&nbsp;enmity of the pope. Meanwhile Frederick I. had achieved&nbsp;his first victories in Lombardy, and, leaving ruined cities&nbsp;and bloodshed in his track, was rapidly advancing towards</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">central Italy. The pope sent three cardinals to him, with a request for the capture and consignment of Arnold, who</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
