<p><span class="font1">were issued </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">senatus decreto,</span><span class="font1"> the learned Giesebrecht merely remarks that no important changes in the Roman constitution are to be attributed to the consuls and senate&nbsp;introduced by Otho III. Thus for the next glimpse of&nbsp;the senate we must pass to the 12th century, when it was&nbsp;not only reformed, as some writers believe, but entirely&nbsp;reconstituted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But in this case a serious difficulty remains to be disposed of. Gregorovius firmly asserts that the nobles acquired great power between the 7th and IOth centuries,&nbsp;not only filling the highest military, judicial, and ecclesiastical offices, “ but also directing the municipal government,&nbsp;presumably with the prefect at their head.” He further&nbsp;adds :—“Notwithstanding the disappearance of the senate,&nbsp;it is difficult to suppose that the city was without governing magistrates, or without a council.” Thus, after the 7th&nbsp;century, the optimates at the head of the army were also&nbsp;at the head of the citizens, and “formed a communal council&nbsp;in the same manner in which it was afterwards formed by&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi.@@<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1"> Now, if the nobles were called senatores,&nbsp;and the nobility senatus, and if this body of nobles met in&nbsp;council to administer the affairs of the republic, there is&nbsp;no matter for dispute, inasmuch as all are agreed that the&nbsp;original senate must have had a different character from&nbsp;the senate of the Aliddle Ages. And, since the absence of&nbsp;all mention of a prefect after the 7th century is not accepted&nbsp;as a proof of his non-existence, and we find him reappear&nbsp;under another form in the 8th century, so the silence as to&nbsp;the senate after the year 579, the fresh mention of it in the&nbsp;8th century, and its reappearance in the 12th as a firmly&nbsp;reconstituted body reasonably lead to the inference that,&nbsp;during that time, the ancient senate had been gradually&nbsp;transformed into the new council. Its meetings must have&nbsp;been held very irregularly, and probably only in emergencies&nbsp;when important affairs had to be discussed, previously to&nbsp;bringing them before the parliament or general assembly&nbsp;of the people. Historians are better agreed as to the significance of the term </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">consul.</span><span class="font1"> At first this was simply a title&nbsp;of honour bestowed on superior magistrates, and retained&nbsp;that meaning from the 7th to the Ilth century, but was&nbsp;then—as in other Italian cities—only given to the chief&nbsp;officer of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During this period the Roman constitution was very simple. The duke, commanding the army, and the prefect,&nbsp;presiding over the criminal court, were the chiefs of the&nbsp;republic ; the armed nobility constituted the forces, filled&nbsp;all superior offices, and occasionally met in a council called&nbsp;the senate, though it had no resemblance to the senate of&nbsp;older times. In moments of emergency a general parliament of the people was convoked. This constitution&nbsp;differed little from that of the other Italian communes,&nbsp;where, in the same way, we find all the leading citizens&nbsp;under arms, a parliament, a council, and one or more chiefs&nbsp;at the head of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But Rome had an element that was lacking elsewhere. We have already noted that, in the provinces, the administrators of church lands were important personages, and&nbsp;exercised during the AIiddle Ages, when there was no&nbsp;exact division of power, both judicial and political functions. It was very natural that the heads of this vast&nbsp;administration resident in Rome should have a still higher&nbsp;standing, and in fact, from the 6th century, their power&nbsp;increased to such an extent that in the times of the&nbsp;Franks they already formed a species of papal cabinet&nbsp;with .a share and sometimes a predominance in the affairs&nbsp;of the republic. There were seven principal administrators,&nbsp;but two of them held the chief power,—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">primicerius&nbsp;Hotariorum</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Secundicerius, i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> the first. and under</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> Gregorovius, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte,</span><span class="font0"> vol. ii. p. 427-8 and note (2d ed.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">secretaries of state. AVhen, on the constitution of the new empire, these ministers were declared to be palatine or&nbsp;imperial as well as papal officials, the primicerius and the&nbsp;Secundicerius were also in waiting on the emperor, who sat&nbsp;in council with them, when in Rome. Next came the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arcarius,</span><span class="font1"> Ortreasurer; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sacellarius,</span><span class="font1"> or cashier ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">theproto-Scriniarius,</span><span class="font1"> who was at the head of the papal chancery; the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">primus defensor,</span><span class="font1"> who was the advocate of the church, and&nbsp;administered its possessions. Seventh and last came the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Homenclator,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">admiηiculator,</span><span class="font1"> who pleaded the cause of&nbsp;widows, orphans, and paupers. There were also some&nbsp;other officials, such as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vestianus,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vicedominus</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;steward, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cubicularius</span><span class="font1"> or majordomo, but these were&nbsp;of inferior importance. They were ecclesiastics, but not&nbsp;bound to be in priest’s orders. The first seven were those&nbsp;specially known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">proceres clericorum</span><span class="font1"> and often er still&nbsp;as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judices de clero,</span><span class="font1"> since they speedily assumed judicial&nbsp;functions and ranked among the chief judges of Rome.&nbsp;But as ecclesiastics they did not give decisions in criminal&nbsp;cases. Thus Rome had two tribunals, that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ike judices&nbsp;de clero,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ordinarii,</span><span class="font1"> presided over by the pope, and that&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">judices de militia,</span><span class="font1"> leaders of the army, dukes and&nbsp;tribunes, also bearing the generic title of consuls. First&nbsp;appointed by the exarch and then frequently by the pope,&nbsp;these decided both civil and criminal cases. In the latter&nbsp;they were sole judges under the presidency of the prefect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pope was thus at the head of a large administrative body with judicial and civil powers that were continually&nbsp;on the increase, and, in addition to his moral authority&nbsp;over Christendom, was possessed of enormous revenues.&nbsp;So in course of time he considered himself the real representative of the Roman republic. Gregory II. (715-731)&nbsp;accepted in the name of the republic the submission of&nbsp;other cities, and protested against the conquest by the&nbsp;Lombards of those already belonging to Rome. He seemed&nbsp;indeed to regard the territory of the duchy as the patrimony of the church. The duke was always at the head of&nbsp;the army, and, officially, was always held to be an imperial&nbsp;magistrate. But the empire was now powerless in Italy.&nbsp;Aleanwhile the advance of the Lombards was becoming&nbsp;more and more threatening; they seized Ravenna in 751,&nbsp;thus putting an end to the exarchate, and next marched&nbsp;towards Rome, which had only its own forces and the aid of&nbsp;neighbouring cities to rely upon. To avoid being crushed&nbsp;by the brute force of a foreign nation unfit to rule, and&nbsp;only capable of oppression and pillage, it was necessary to&nbsp;make an energetic stand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Accordingly the reigning pope, Stephen II. (752-757), appealed to Pippin, king of the Franks, and concluded&nbsp;with that monarch an alliance destined to inaugurate a&nbsp;new epoch of the world’s history. The pope consecrated&nbsp;Pippin king of the Franks, and named him </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patricius&nbsp;Romanorum.</span><span class="font1"> This title, as introduced by Constantine,&nbsp;had no longer the ancient meaning, but now became a&nbsp;sign of lofty social rank. AVhen, however, it was afterwards conferred on barbarian chieftains such as Odoacer&nbsp;and Theodoric, and then on the representative of the&nbsp;Byzantine empire in Italy, it acquired the meaning of&nbsp;a definite dignity or office. In fact the title was now&nbsp;given to Pippin as defender of the church, for the pope&nbsp;styled him at the same time </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patricius Romanorum</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">defensor</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">protector ecclesiae.</span><span class="font1"> And the king pledged&nbsp;himself not only to defend the church but also to wrest&nbsp;the exarchate and the Pentapolis from the Lombards and&nbsp;give them to Rome, or rather to the pope, which came to&nbsp;the same thing. This was considered as a restitution&nbsp;made to the head of the church, who was also the representative of the republic and the empire. And, to preserve the character of a restitution, the famous “ donation&nbsp;of Constantine” was invented during this period (752-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
