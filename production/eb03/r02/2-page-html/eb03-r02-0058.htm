<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">’The knowledge of this is neceſſary for underſtanding the regimen of a river ; for it is the velocity of the filaments in contact with the bed which produces any&nbsp;change in it, and occaſions any preference of one to&nbsp;another, in reſpect of regimen or ſtability. Did theſe&nbsp;circumſtances not operate, the water, true to the laws&nbsp;of hydraulics, and confined within the bounds which&nbsp;have been aſſigned them, would neither enlarge nor di-rniniſh the area of the channel. But this is all that we&nbsp;can promiſe of waters perfectly clear, running in pipes&nbsp;or hewn channels. But rivers, brooks, and ſmaller&nbsp;ſtreams, carry along waters loaded with mud or fand,&nbsp;which they depoſit wherever their velocity is checked ;&nbsp;and they tear up, on the other hand, the materials of&nbsp;the channel wherever their velocity is ſufficiently great.&nbsp;Nature, indeed, aims continually at an equilibrium, and&nbsp;works without ceaſing to perpetuate her own performances, by eſtabliſhing an equality of action and reaction, and proportioning the forms and direction of the&nbsp;motions to her agents, and to local circumſtances. Her&nbsp;work is Row but unceaſing ; and what ſhe cannot ac-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">compliſh in a year ſhe will do in a century. The beds· of our rivers have acquired ſome ſtability, becauſe they&nbsp;are the )abour of ages ; and it is to time that we owe<sup>,&nbsp;</sup>thoſe deep and wide valleys which receive- and confine&nbsp;our rivers in channels, which are now conlolidated, and&nbsp;with ſlopes which have been gradually moderated, ſo&nbsp;that they no longer either ravage our habitations or&nbsp;confound our boundaries. Art may imitate nature, and&nbsp;by directing her operations (which ſhe ſtill carries on according to lier own impreſcriptible law’s) according to&nbsp;our views, we can halten her progreſs, and accompliſh&nbsp;our purpoſe, during the ſhort period of human life.&nbsp;But we can do this only by ſtudying the unalterable laws&nbsp;of mechaniſm. Theſe are preſented to us by ſpontaneous nature. Frequently we remain ignorant of their&nbsp;foundation : but ſt is not neceſſary for the proſpe-rity of the ſubject that he have the talents of the ſena-tor ; he can profit by the ſtatute without underſtanding its grounds. It is ſo in the preſent inſtance. We&nbsp;have not as yet been able to infer the law of retardation&nbsp;obſerved in the filaments of a running ſtream from any&nbsp;found mechanical principle. The problem, however,&nbsp;does not appear beyond our powers, if we aſſume, with&nbsp;Sir Iſaac Newton, that the velocity of any particular&nbsp;filament is the arithmetical mean between thoſe of the&nbsp;filaments immediately adjoining. We may be aſſured,&nbsp;that the filament in the axis of an inclined cylindrical&nbsp;tube, of which the current is in train, moves the faſteſt,&nbsp;and that all thoſe in the ſame circumference round it are&nbsp;moving with one velocity, and that the ſlow’eſt are&nbsp;thoſe which glide along the pipe. We may affirm the&nbsp;ſame thing of the motions in a ſemi-cylindrical inclined&nbsp;channel conveying an open ſtream. But even in theſe&nbsp;we have not yet demonſtrated the ratio between the&nbsp;extreme velocities, nor in the different circles. This&nbsp;muſt be decided experimentally.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And here we are under great obligations to Mr de Buat. He has compared the velocity in the axis of a&nbsp;prodigious number and variety of ſtreams, differing in&nbsp;ſize, form, ſlope, and velocity, and has computed in&nbsp;them all the mean velocity, by meaſuring the quantities&nbsp;of water diſcharged in a given time. His method of&nbsp;meaſuring the bottom velocity was ſimple and juſt. He&nbsp;threw in a gooſeſherry, as nearly as poſſible, of the ſame&nbsp;ſpecific gravity with the water. It was carried along&nbsp;the bottom almoſt without touching it. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Résistance of Fluids,</span><span class="font0"> n<sup>o</sup> 67.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He diſcovered the following laws : 1. In ſmall velocities the velocity in the axis is to that at the bottom in a ratio of conſiderable inequality. 2. This ratio diminiſhes as the velocity increaſes, and in very great velocities approaches to the ratio of equality. 3. What&nbsp;was moſt remarkable was, that neither the magnitude of&nbsp;the channel, nor its ſlope, had any influence in changing&nbsp;this proportion, while the mean velocity remained the&nbsp;ſame. Nay, though the ſtream ran on a channel covered with pebbles or coarſe fand, no difference worth&nbsp;minding was to be obſerved from the velocity over a&nbsp;poliſhed channel. 4. And if the velocity in the axis is&nbsp;conſtant, the velocity at the bottom is alſo conſtant, and&nbsp;is not affected by the depth of water or magnitude of&nbsp;the ſtream. In ſome experiments the depth was thrice&nbsp;thd width, and in others the width was thrice the depth.&nbsp;This changed the proportion of the magnitude of the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
