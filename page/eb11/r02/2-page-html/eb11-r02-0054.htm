<p><span class="font1">The Netherlands became the battlefield of Reformation and Coun ter-Reformat ion in even a stricter sense than France. Here&nbsp;the antagonistic principles were plainly posed in the&nbsp;course of struggle against foreign despotism. The&nbsp;conflict ended in the assertion of political independence&nbsp;as opposed to absolute dominion. Europe in large measure&nbsp;owes the modern ideal of political liberty to that spirit&nbsp;of stubborn resistance which broke the power of Spain. Recent&nbsp;history, and in particular the history of democracy, claims for its&nbsp;province the several stages whereby this principle was developed&nbsp;in England and America, and its outburst in the frenzy of the&nbsp;French Revolution. It is enough here to have alluded to the part&nbsp;played by the Low Countries in the genesis of a motive force which&nbsp;may be described as the last manifestation of the Renaissance</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">striving after self-emancipation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The insular position of England, combined with the nature of the English people, has allowed us to feel the vibration of&nbsp;European movements later and with less of shock&nbsp;than any of the continental nations. Before a*wave&nbsp;of progress has reached our shores we have had the&nbsp;opportunity of watching it as spectators, and of considering how we shall receive it. Revolutions have passed&nbsp;from the tumultuous stages of their origin into some settled&nbsp;and recognizable state before we have been called upon to&nbsp;cope with them. It was thus that England took the&nbsp;influences of the Renaissance and Reformation simultaneously,&nbsp;and almost at the same time found herself engaged in that&nbsp;struggle with the Counter-Reformation which, crowned by&nbsp;the defeat of the Spanish Armada, stimulated the sense of&nbsp;nationality and developed the naval forces of the race. Both&nbsp;Renaissance and Reformation had been anticipated by at least&nbsp;a century in England. Chaucer’s poetry, which owed so much&nbsp;to Italian examples, gave an early foretaste of the former.&nbsp;Wickliffe’s teaching was a vital moment in the latter. But&nbsp;the French wars, the Wars of the Roses and the persecution&nbsp;of the .Lollards deferred the coming of the new age; and thé&nbsp;year 1536, when Henry VIII. passed the Act of Supremacy&nbsp;through parliament, may be fixed as the date when England&nbsp;entered definitively upon a career of intellectual development&nbsp;abreast with the foremost nations of the continent. The&nbsp;circumstances just now insisted on explain the specific character&nbsp;of the English Renaissance. The Reformation had been adopted&nbsp;by consent of the king, lords and commons; and this change&nbsp;in the state religion, though it was not confirmed without&nbsp;reaction, agitation and bloodshed, cost the nation comparatively&nbsp;little disturbance. Humanism, before it affected the&nbsp;bulk of the English people, had already permeated&nbsp;Italian and French literature. Classical erudition&nbsp;had been adapted to the needs of modem thought.&nbsp;The hard work of collecting, printing, annotating&nbsp;and translating Greek and Latin authors had been&nbsp;accomplished. The masterpieces of antiquity had been&nbsp;interpreted and made intelligible. Much of the learning&nbsp;popularized by our poets and dramatists was derived at second&nbsp;hand from modern literature. This does not mean that England&nbsp;was deficient in ripe and sound scholars. More, Colet, Ascham,&nbsp;Cheke, Camden were men whose familiarity with the classics&nbsp;was both intimate and easy. Public schools and universities&nbsp;conformed to the modern methods of study; nor were there&nbsp;wanting opportunities for youths of humble origin to obtain an&nbsp;education which placed them on a level with Italian scholars.&nbsp;The single case of Ben Jonson sufficiently proves this. Yet&nbsp;learning did not at this epoch become a marked speciality in&nbsp;England. There was no class corresponding to the humanists.&nbsp;It should also be remembered that the best works of Italian&nbsp;literature were introduced into Great Britain together with the&nbsp;classics. Phaer’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Virgil,</span><span class="font0"> Chapman’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Homer<sub>f</sub></span><span class="font0">  Harrington’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Orlando,</span><span class="font0"> Marlowe’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hero and Leander,</span><span class="font0"> Fairfax’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jerusalem&nbsp;Delivered,</span><span class="font0"> North’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Plutarch,</span><span class="font0"> Hohy’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Courtier</span><span class="font0">—to mention only a&nbsp;few examples—placed English readers simultaneously in possession of the most eminent and representative works of Greece,&nbsp;Rome and Italy. At the same time «Spanish influences reached&nbsp;them through the imitators of Guevara and the dramatists;&nbsp;French influences in the versions of romances; German influences in popular translations of the Faust, legend, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eultn-Spiegel</span><span class="font0"> and similar productions. The authorized version of the&nbsp;Bible had also been recently given to the people—so that almost&nbsp;at the same period of time England obtained in the vernacular&nbsp;an extensive library of ancient and modern authors. This was&nbsp;a privilege enjoyed in like measure by no other nation. It&nbsp;sufficiently accounts for the richness and variety of Elizabethan&nbsp;literature, and for the enthusiasm with which the English&nbsp;language was cultivated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Speaking strictly, England borrowed little in the region of the arts from other nations, and developed still less that was original.&nbsp;What is called Jacobean architecture marks indeed an&nbsp;interesting stage in the transition from the Gothic style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But, compared with Jtalian<sub>l</sub> French<sub>t</sub>Spanish, German and Flemish work of a like period, it is both timid and dry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sculpture was represented in London for a brief space by Torrigiani; painting by Holbein and Antonio More; music by&nbsp;Italians and Frenchmen of the Chapel Royal. But no Englishmen&nbsp;rose to European eminence in these departments. With literature&nbsp;the case was very different. Wyat and Surrey began by engrafting&nbsp;the forms and graces of Italian poetry upon the native stock. They&nbsp;introduced the sonnet and blank verse. Sidney followed with the&nbsp;sestine and terza rima and with various experiments in classic&nbsp;metres, none of which took root on English soil. The translators&nbsp;handled the octave stanza. Marlowe gave new vigour to the&nbsp;couplet. The first period of the English Renaissance was one of&nbsp;imitation and assimilation. Academies after the ltalian type were&nbsp;founded. Tragedies in the style of Seneca, rivalling Italian and&nbsp;French dramas of the epoch, were produced. Attempts to Latinize&nbsp;ancestral rhythms, similar to those which had failed in Italy and&nbsp;France, were made. Tentative essays in criticism and dissertations&nbsp;on the art of poetry abounded. It seemed as though the Renaissance&nbsp;ran a risk of being throttled in its cradle by superfluity of foreign and&nbsp;pedantic nutriment. But the natural vigour of the Englishgenius&nbsp;resisted influences alien to itself, and showed a robust capacity&nbsp;for digesting the varied diet offered to it. As there was nothing&nbsp;despotic in the temper of the ruling classes, nothing oppressive in&nbsp;English culture, the literature of that age evolved itself freely from&nbsp;the people. . It was under these conditions that Spenser gave his&nbsp;romantic epic to.the world., a poem which derived its allegory from&nbsp;the middle ages, its decorative richness from the Italian Renaissance,&nbsp;its sweetness, purity, harmony and imaginative splendour from the&nbsp;most poetic nation of the modern world. Under the same conditions&nbsp;the Elizabethan drama, which in its totality is the real exponent of&nbsp;the English Renaissance, came into existence. This drama very&nbsp;early freed itself from the pseudo-classic mannerism which imposed&nbsp;on taste in Italy and France. Depicting feudalism in the vivid&nbsp;colours of an.age at war with feudal institutions, breathing into&nbsp;antique histories the breath of actual life, embracing the romance of&nbsp;Italy and Spain, the mysteries of German legend, the fictions of poetic&nbsp;fancy and the facts of daily life, humours of the moment and abstractions of philosophical speculation, in one homogeneous amalgam&nbsp;instinct with intense vitality, this extraordinary birth of time, with&nbsp;Shakespeare for the master of all ages, left a monument of the Renaissance unrivalled for pure creative power by any other product&nbsp;of that epoch. To complete the sketch, we must set Bacon, the&nbsp;expositor of modern scientific method,'beside Spenser and Shakespeare, as the third representative of the Renaissance in England.&nbsp;Nor should Raleigh, Drake, Hawkins, the semi-buccaneer explorers&nbsp;of the ocean, be omitted. They, following the lead of&nbsp;Portuguese and Spaniards, combating the Counter-Reformation on the seas, opened for England her career&nbsp;of colonization and plantation. All this while the political&nbsp;policy of Tudors and Stewarts tended towards monarchical&nbsp;absofutism, while the Reformation in England, modified&nbsp;by contact with.the Low Countries during their struggles,&nbsp;was. narrowing into strict reactionary intolerance. Puritanism indicated a revolt of the religious conscience of&nbsp;the nation against the arts and manners of the Renaissance, against the encroachments of belligerentCatholicism,&nbsp;against the corrupt and Italianated court of James L,&nbsp;against the absolutist pretensions of his son Charles. In its final&nbsp;manifestation during the Commonwealth, Puritanism won a transient victory over the mundane forces of both Reformation and&nbsp;Renaissance, as these had taken shape in England. It also secured&nbsp;the eventual triumph of constitutional independence. Milton, the&nbsp;greatest humanistic poet of the English race, lent his pen and moral&nbsp;energies during the best years of his life to securing that principle&nbsp;on which modern political systems at present rest. Thus the geographical isolation of England, and the comparatively late adoption&nbsp;by the English of matured Italian and German influences, give&nbsp;peculiar complexity to the phenomena of Reformation and Renaissance simultaneously developed on our island. The period of&nbsp;our history between 1536 and 1642 shows how difficult it is .to&nbsp;separate these two factors in the re-birth of Europe, both of which&nbsp;contributed so powerfully to the formation of modern English&nbsp;nationality.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
