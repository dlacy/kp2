<p><span class="font1">apocryphal. The same may be said of the numerous silly stories told of his life, such as that of his procuring a free&nbsp;passage to Paris by inscribing packets “ Poison for the king, ”&nbsp;and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ten years after the publication of the fourth book and nine after the supposed date of the author’s death there appeared&nbsp;at Lyons sixteen chapters entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lî'le sonnante par maistre&nbsp;François Rabelais,</span><span class="font1"> and two years later the entire fifth book&nbsp;was printed as such. In 1567 it took place with the others,&nbsp;and has ever since appeared with them. But from the&nbsp;beginning of the 17th century there have never been wanting&nbsp;disbelievers in its authenticity. The controversy is one of&nbsp;some intricacy, but as it is also one of capital importance in&nbsp;literary history the heads of it at least must be given here.&nbsp;The opponents of the book rely (1) on the testimony of a&nbsp;certain Louis Guyon, who in 1604 declared that the fifth book&nbsp;Was made long after Rabelais’s death by an author whom he&nbsp;knew, and who was not a doctor, and on the assertion of the&nbsp;bibliographer Du Verdier, about the same time, that it was&nbsp;written by an “ écolier de Valence ”; (2) on the fact that the&nbsp;anti-monastic and even anti-Catholic polemic is much more&nbsp;accentuated in it; (3) on the arguments that parts are apparently replicas or rough drafts of passages already&nbsp;appearing in the four earlier books; and (4) that some allusions&nbsp;are manifestly posterior to even the furthest date which can&nbsp;be assigned for the reputed author’s decease. On the other&nbsp;hand, it is urged that, though Guyon and Du Verdier were in&nbsp;a sense contemporaries, they wrote long after the events,&nbsp;and that the testimony of the former is vitiated, not merely&nbsp;by its extreme vagueness, but by the fact that it occurs in a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plaidoyer,</span><span class="font1"> tending to exculpate physicians from the charge of&nbsp;unorthodoxy; that Du Verdier in another place assigns the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagrueline Prognostication</span><span class="font1"> to this same unknown student&nbsp;of Valence, and had therefore probably confused and hearsay&nbsp;notions on the subject; that the rasher and fiercer tone, as&nbsp;well as the apparent repetitions, are sufficiently accounted&nbsp;for on the supposition that Rabelais never finally revised the&nbsp;book, which indeed dates show that he could not have done,&nbsp;as the fourth was not finally settled till just before his death;&nbsp;and that it is perfectly probable, and indeed almost certain,&nbsp;that it was prepared from his papers by another hand, which&nbsp;is responsible for the anachronous allusions above referred to.&nbsp;But the strongest argument, and one which has never been&nbsp;attacked by authorities really competent to judge, is that&nbsp;the “ griffe de l’aigle ” is on the book, and that no known&nbsp;author of the time except Rabelais was capable of writing the&nbsp;passage about the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chats fourrés,</span><span class="font1"> the better part of the history&nbsp;of Queen Whims (La Quinte) and her court, and the conclusion&nbsp;giving the Oracle of the Bottle. To this argument we believe&nbsp;that the more competent a critic is, both by general faculty&nbsp;of appreciation and by acquaintance with contemporary&nbsp;French literature, the more positive will be the assent that he&nbsp;yields. The reader must, however, be on his guard against&nbsp;confusing the authenticity of the fifth book generally with&nbsp;that of supposed early copies of it. Quite recently it was&nbsp;announced that an edition of 1549 had turned up in Germany;&nbsp;but the investigations of M. R. Stein, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">un Rabelais apocryphe&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1901), repeated and confirmed by M. A. Lefranc in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Revue des études Rabelaisiennes</span><span class="font1"> (1905), disposed of the matter.&nbsp;The substance of the apocryphal document is quite different&nbsp;from our fifth book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pantagruel,</span><span class="font0"> notwithstanding their high literary standing and the frequency with which certain passages from them&nbsp;are cited, are, owing partly to their archaism of language and partly&nbsp;to the extreme licence which their author has allowed himself, so&nbsp;little read that no notice of them or of him could be complete&nbsp;without some sketch of their contents. The first book, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">describes the birth of that hero (a giant and the son of gigantic&nbsp;parents), whose nativity is ushered in by the account of a&nbsp;tremendous feast. In this the burlesque exaggeration of the&nbsp;pleasures of eating and drinking, which is one of the chief exterior&nbsp;notes of the whole work, is pushed to an extreme—an extreme which&nbsp;has attracted natural but perhaps undue attention. Very early,&nbsp;however, the author becomes serious in contrasting the early education of his hero—a satire on the degraded schools of the middle&nbsp;ages—with its subsequent and reformed stage, in the account of&nbsp;which all the best and noblest ideas of the humanist Renaissance in&nbsp;reference to pedagogy are put with exceptional force. Gargantua&nbsp;is recalled from Paris, whither he had been sent to finish his education, owing to a war between his father, Grandgosier, and the&nbsp;neighbouring king, Picrochole. This war is described at great length,&nbsp;the chief hero of it being the monk, Friar John, a very unclerical&nbsp;cleric, in whom Rabelais greatly delights. Pierochole defeated&nbsp;and peace made, Gargantua establishes the abbey of Thelema in&nbsp;another of Rabelais’s most elaborate literary passages, where all&nbsp;the points most obnoxious to him in monastic life are indicated&nbsp;by the assignment of their exact opposites to this model convent.&nbsp;The second book, which introduces the principal hero of the whole,&nbsp;Pantagruel, Gargantua’s son, is, on any other hypothesis but that&nbsp;already suggested of its prior composition, very difficult to explain,&nbsp;but in itself it is intelligible enough. Pantagruel goes through&nbsp;something like a second edition (really a first) of the educational&nbsp;experiences of his father. Like him, he goes to Paris, and there&nbsp;meets with Panurge, the principal triumph of Rabelaisian character-drawing, and the most original as well as puzzling figure of the book.&nbsp;Panurge has almost all intellectual accomplishments, but is totally&nbsp;devoid of morality: he is a coward, a drunkard, a lecher, a spiteful&nbsp;trickster, a spendthrift, but all the while infinitely amusing. This&nbsp;book, like the other, has a war in its latter part; Gargantua scarcely&nbsp;appears in it and Friar John not at all. It is not till the opening&nbsp;of the third book that the most important action begins. This&nbsp;arises from Panurge’s determination to marry—a determination,&nbsp;however, which is very half-hearted, and which leads him to consult&nbsp;a vast number of authorities, each giving occasion for satire of a&nbsp;more or less complicated kind. At last it is determined that&nbsp;Pantagruel and his followers (Friar John has reappeared in the&nbsp;suite of the prince) shall set sail to consult the Oracle of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dive&nbsp;Bouteille.</span><span class="font0"> The book ends with the obscurest passage of the whole,&nbsp;an elaborate eulogy of the </span><span class="font1">“</span><span class="font0"> herb pantagruelion, ” which appears&nbsp;to be, if it is anything, hemp. Only two probable explanations&nbsp;of this have been offered, the one seeing in it an anticipation of&nbsp;Joseph de Maistre's glorification of the executioner, the other a&nbsp;eulogy of work, hemp being on the whole the most serviceable&nbsp;of vegetable products for that purpose. The fourth and fifth&nbsp;books arc entirely taken up with a description of the voyage. Many&nbsp;strange places with stranger names are visited, some of them&nbsp;offering obvious satire on human institutions, others, except by&nbsp;the most far-fetched explanations, resolvable into nothing but&nbsp;sheer extravaganza. At last the Land of Lanterns, borrowed from&nbsp;Lucian, is reached, and the Oracle of the Bottle is consulted. This&nbsp;yields the single word </span><span class="font1">“</span><span class="font0"> Trinq, ” which the attendant priestess&nbsp;declares to be the most gracious and intelligible she has ever heard&nbsp;from it. Panurge takes this as a sanction of his marriage, and the&nbsp;book ends abruptly. This singular romance is diversified by, or,&nbsp;to speak more properly, it is the vehicle of the most bewildering&nbsp;abundance of digression, burlesque amplification, covert satire&nbsp;on things political, social and religious, miscellaneous erudition&nbsp;of the literary and scientific kind. Everywhere the author lays&nbsp;stress on the excellence of </span><span class="font1">“</span><span class="font0">Pantagruelism, ” and the reader who is&nbsp;himself a Pantagruelist (it is perfectly idle for any other to attempt&nbsp;the book) soon discovers what this means. It is, in plain English,&nbsp;humour. The definition of humour is a generally acknowledged&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">crux,</span><span class="font0"> and till it is defined the definition of Pantagruelism will be in&nbsp;the same position. But that it consists in the extension of a wide&nbsp;sympathy to all human affairs, together with a comprehension of&nbsp;their vanity, may be said as safely as anything else. Moroseness&nbsp;and dogmatism are as far from the Pantagruelism of Rabelais as&nbsp;maudlin sentimentality or dilettantism. Perhaps the chief things&nbsp;lacking in his attitude are, in the first place, reverence, of which,&nbsp;however, from a few passages, it is clear he was by no means totally&nbsp;devoid, and secondly, an appreciation of passion and poetry. Here&nbsp;and there there are touches of the latter, as in the portrait of Quintessence, but passion is everywhere absent—an absence for which&nbsp;the comic structure and plan of the book do not by any means supply&nbsp;a complete explanation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For a general estimate of Rabelais’s literary character and influence the reader may be referred to the article French Literature. But some detailed remarks must be given here. There are three&nbsp;questions without the discussion of which this notice of one of the&nbsp;foremost writers of the world would not be worthy of its present&nbsp;place. These are—What is the general drift and purpose of&nbsp;Gargantua and Pantagruel, supposing there to be any? What&nbsp;defence can be offered, if any defence is needed, for the extraordinary licence of language and imagery which the author has&nbsp;permitted himself? What was his attitude towards the great&nbsp;questions of religion, philosophy and politics? These questions&nbsp;succeed each other in the order of reason, and the answer to each&nbsp;assists the resolution of the next. </span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There have been few more remarkable instances of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lues commentators</span><span class="font0"> than the work of the editors of Rabelais. Almost&nbsp;every one appears to have started with a Rabelais ready made in&nbsp;his head, and to have, so to speak, read that Rabelais into the&nbsp;book. Those who have not done this, like Le Duchat, Motteux</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
