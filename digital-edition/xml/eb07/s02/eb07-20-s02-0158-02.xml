 in the Romish church, &amp;c. consists</p><p>of a certain order of antiphonies and psalms sung to what is called <hi rend="italic">canto fermo</hi> in Italian, <hi rend="italic">canto llano</hi> in Spanish, and <hi rend="italic">plain chant</hi> in French. This kind of chant, in its simplest form, consists of slow sounds of equal duration, and without any embellishment, sung in unisons and octaves. In other cases the <hi rend="italic">canto fermo</hi> is accompanied by Parts in harmony, but always with due regard to a certain <hi rend="italic">antique</hi> and very simple style of melody and of harmony, which is founded upon the peculiar <hi rend="italic">tonality</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cadences</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">canto fermo,</hi> and without which it loses its characteristic effects. The <hi rend="italic">canto corale,</hi> or choral chant, is often particularly named <hi rend="italic">canto Gregorianο,</hi> or Gregorian chant, from the great pains taken by St Gregory, in the sixth century, to improve and to teach to his pupils the oriental church chants derived from the Greeks. St Ambrose before him had introduced the oriental choral chants into the western church of Italy. We believe that there is yet much curious matter for investigation regarding the probable origin of the melodies that constituted the older <hi rend="italic">canto fermo,</hi> and the nature and character of oriental scales and melodies. See Music. With regard to the tunes introduced into the early reformed church in the time of Luther and Calvin, some curious particulars are to be found in Bayle’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionaire Historique et critique,</hi> article <hi rend="smallcaps">Marot.</hi> The Puritans in England suppressed the church choral service, and permitted psalm-singing only. Charles II. revived the choral service in England. For minute accounts of the origin, progress, and revolutions of this species of music in various Christian churches, the reader may consult Gerbert, <hi rend="italic">De cantu et Musica Sacra,</hi> Padre Martini’s <hi rend="italic">Storia,</hi> Hawkins and Burney’s Histories of Music. For technicalities, &amp;c consult, among other works, A. E. Choron’s <hi rend="italic">Méthode de Plain-chant, &amp;c.</hi> Paris, 1818; and his <hi rend="italic">Principes pour apprendre le Plain-chant,</hi> Paris, 1818.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
