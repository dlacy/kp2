<p><span class="font0">the case of the Fifty-second Congress, the Democrats, with 50-6% of the votes, returned 71-1% of the representatives; the Republicans, with 42-9% of the votes, returning&nbsp;26-5% of the representatives. Lord Avebury </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Proportional Representation,</span><span class="font0"> 1890; new ed. 1906) has given various&nbsp;similar experiences in EngIand; thus, at the general election&nbsp;of 1886, the Liberals, with 1,333,40° votes, only obtained 176&nbsp;seats, while the Unionists, with 1,423,500, obtained 283 (not&nbsp;counting 99 unopposed returns on the Liberal side, and mon&nbsp;the Unionist). In the general election of 1895, at which 132&nbsp;Unionist seats and 57 Liberal were unopposed, thc result in the&nbsp;481 seats contested was the return of 279 Unionists and 202&nbsp;Liberals; yet the actual votes given were 1,800,000 for the&nbsp;Liberals, and 1,775,000 for the Unionists. Again, in 1906, the&nbsp;Unionist vote, though 44% of the total cast, returned only&nbsp;28% of the members, and the Liberal majority, which in&nbsp;strict proportion would have been 68, actually was 256.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The establishment of mere party majority rule, which is characteristic of a representative system, is a necessity, no doubt, in popular government; but the way in which a substantial&nbsp;minority of voters may only obtain a contemptible minority&nbsp;of members, and may in practice be tyrannized over in consequence, somewhat detracts from its blessings, and leads to&nbsp;extreme party measures. The division of the whole electoral&nbsp;body into constituencies is, after all, only a device for getting&nbsp;over the difficulty of the electors voting </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">en bloc,</span><span class="font0"> and it docs not&nbsp;seem to justify the conversion of a real majority in the country&nbsp;into a minority as represented in parliament, nor the complete&nbsp;exclusion of a substantial number of the electorate from parliamentary representation“=-so far as their views are concerned—at&nbsp;all. Yet under the English system such results are possible as the&nbsp;capture of every seat in Wales (34), in 1906, by the Liberal party,&nbsp;with 217,462 votes, the 100,547 Unionist voters having no&nbsp;representation in parliament; while in Warwickshire, though&nbsp;22,490 votes were given to the Unionist candidates against 22,021&nbsp;for the Liberal, three Liberals were returned against one&nbsp;Unionist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The attempt to rectify this flaw in the representative method has led to the suggestion of various devices by the adoption&nbsp;of which the elected members may correspond more&nbsp;equally to the divisions of opinion in the electorate.&nbsp;Under the plan of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scrutin de liste</span><span class="font0"> (or “ general ticket ”)&nbsp;larger districts are created, each returning several&nbsp;members, and each voter has as many votes as there are&nbsp;members to elect; but while this system apparently&nbsp;provides the opportunity for the return of candidates&nbsp;with different views, it only requires a solid party vote to&nbsp;capture the whole of the representation for a majority.&nbsp;What is known as the “ limited vote ” is a form of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scrutin&nbsp;de liste</span><span class="font0"> by which the elector has less votes than there are seats&nbsp;to be filled; with (say) three to be clected, the elector has&nbsp;only two votes. Systems of “ limited vote ” are in force in&nbsp;Portugal, Spain and Japan. A somewhat better plan is the&nbsp;“ cumulative vote, ” which gives each elector as many votes&nbsp;as there arc members to be elected, but allows him to divide&nbsp;them as he pleases (instead of giving only one vote to any one&nbsp;candidate).. This enables an organized minority, by concentrating their votes, to elect at all events some representative; but&nbsp;the “ cumulative vote ” works rather capriciously, and is com</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">monly defeated by careful party organization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A more elaborate plan, but depending like the “ limited ” vote and the “ cumulative ” vote on the formation of constituencies returning three or more members each, is that of the&nbsp;“ transferable vote. ” By this device an elector can indicate&nbsp;on his ballot paper not only his first choice, but also his second&nbsp;or third, &amp;c. To ensure election a candidate need not obtain&nbsp;a majority of the votes polled, but only a certain number, so&nbsp;fixed that it can be obtained by a number of candidates equal&nbsp;to the number of seats to be filled, but by no more; this number&nbsp;of votes is called the “ quota. ” At the first count first choices&nbsp;only are reckoned, and those candidates who have received&nbsp;a “ quota ” or more are declared duly elected. If all the seats&nbsp;have not then been filled up, the surplus votes of those candidates who have received more than the “ quota ” are transferred according to the names marked (2) on them. If these&nbsp;transfers still do not bring the requisite number of candidates&nbsp;up to the “ quota, ” the lowest candidate is eliminated and his&nbsp;votes transferred according to the next preferences, and so on&nbsp;till the seats are filled This system,-which is the one usually&nbsp;associated with the term “ proportional representation ” was&nbsp;first suggested by Thomas Hare, who published in 1857 a&nbsp;pamphlet on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Machinery of Representation,</span><span class="font0"> and in&nbsp;1859 a more complete scheme in his treatise on </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Election&nbsp;of Representatives.</span><span class="font0"> John Stuart Mill, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Representative Government</span><span class="font0"> (1861) warmly endorsed Hare’s proposal. Hare wished&nbsp;to treat the whole country as one constituency, but by later&nbsp;supporters of the “ transferable vote ” that plan was abandoned&nbsp;as impracticable; and the principle will work so long as the&nbsp;constituencies adopted each return several members. Lord&nbsp;Courtney, in his evidence before the British Royal Commission&nbsp;in 1909, said that his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">minimum</span><span class="font0"> constituency would be a threemembered one, but he would create a fifteen-membered constituency without hesitation. The simple “ transferable vote ”&nbsp;has been adopted in Tasmania for all elections (1907), after&nbsp;experimental adoption in the constituencies of Hobart and&nbsp;Launceston in 1896-1901, and in the election of the Tasmanian&nbsp;members of the Commonwealth LgIisIature in 1900. It was&nbsp;proposed in the draft of the South African constitution, but&nbsp;abandoned. The principle has also been adopted in the “ list&nbsp;systems ” of Belgium, some Swiss cantons,· Sweden, Finland&nbsp;and parts of Denmark, Württemberg and Servia, where candidates are grouped in Usts and all votes given to individuaI&nbsp;candidates on the list count first as votes for the list itself, the&nbsp;seats being divided among the Usts in proportion to the total&nbsp;number of votes obtained by the list. The use of the general&nbsp;term “ proportional representation ” for aU of these is*, however,&nbsp;somewhat misleading; people often suppose that only one&nbsp;identical system of voting is meant, whereas in fact some&nbsp;300 possible varieties have been proposed, and each of the&nbsp;states mentioned has a different one from aU the others. The&nbsp;only common element is the device of the “ transferable&nbsp;vote, ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the method of having an “ electoral quota, ” and the&nbsp;filling up of seats, where a quota is not provided by the&nbsp;first choices, by votes transferred from the second choices,&nbsp;and so on. It may be noted here that the “ transferable vote ”&nbsp;is calculated to multipIy candidates to a point at which the&nbsp;minds of the electorate may well be embarrassed as to their&nbsp;preferences (the largest Belgian constituency returns 22 members), and, while undoubtedly providing for “ minority representation, ” to encourage what may be caUed “ minority&nbsp;thinking ” and particularist poUtics. The “ transferable vote ”&nbsp;is commonly objected to as puzzling to the electors and too&nbsp;complicated for the scrutineers, while it is not much favoured&nbsp;by “ machine ” party organizations, which generaUy prefer&nbsp;the simpler plan of rough-and-ready majorities; but it has&nbsp;received a growing amount of theoretical support, as weU as&nbsp;success in practical experiment, in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The “ second baUot ” is a device for securing absolute majority, instead of relative majority, representation. Where the two-party system prevails, it is usual for only two&nbsp;candidates, one for each party, to stand for each&nbsp;single-member constituency. But there is nothing&nbsp;to prevent a third or even a fourth candidate standing,&nbsp;and this multiplication of candidates becomes the more common in proportion as parliamentary organization is SpUt&nbsp;up into groups. The consequence is that the candidate who&nbsp;heads the poll may weU have only a relative, not an absolute,&nbsp;majority of votes, and to meet this objection the “ second ballot ”&nbsp;has been introduced, and is in operation in Austria-Hungary,&nbsp;France, Germany, Italy and Russia. Under this system, if no&nbsp;candidate receives an absolute majority of all the votes, a second&nbsp;election is held, at which, as a rule, onIy the two candidates&nbsp;compete who received most; or in cases where more than one&nbsp;scat is to be fiUed, twice as many candidates compete as there</span></p>
