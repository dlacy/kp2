Dr. Logan,

Please see the attached script.

In addition to lxml, pandas [a Python package that processes spreadsheets] is also needed to run the script.

You could test this script for another entry. You just need to change the input/output filenames at 3 places:
Line 79 for the csv file;
Line 84 for the unprocessed entry file;
Line 96 for the output entry file.
This assumes that the above 3 files and the python script are in the same folder. 

Best,
Luling
