<p><span class="font0">REPRESENTATIVE, one who personates or supplies the place of another, and is invested with his right and authority. Thus the House of Commons is composed of the&nbsp;representatives of the people in parliament. (See Parliament.) </span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REPRIEVE, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Law</span><span class="font0"> (from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reprendre, </span><span class="font0">to take back), is the withdrawing of a sentence for an interval of&nbsp;time, by which means the execution is suspended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REPRISALS, a right which princes claim of taking from their enemies anything equivalent to what the latter unjustly&nbsp;detain from them or their subjects. For as the delay of making war may sometimes be detrimental to individuals who&nbsp;have suffered by depredations from foreign potentates, our&nbsp;laws have in some respects armed the subject with power&nbsp;to impel the prerogative, by directing the ministers of the&nbsp;crown to issue letters of marque and reprisal upon due demand ; the prerogative of granting which is nearly related&nbsp;to, and plainly derived from, that of making war, the former&nbsp;indeed being only an incomplete state of hostilities, and generally ending in a formal denunciation of war. These letters are grantable by the law of nations, whenever the subjects of one state are oppressed and injured by those of another ; and justice is denied by that state to which the oppressor belongs. In this case letters of marque and reprisal&nbsp;(words used as synonymous, and signifying, the latter a taking in return, the former the passing the frontiers in order&nbsp;to such taking) may be obtained, in order to seize the bodies&nbsp;or goods of the subjects of the offending state, until satisfaction be made, wherever they happen to be found. And indeed this custom of reprisals seems dictated by nature herself ; for which reason we find in the most ancient times&nbsp;very notable instances of it. But here the necessity is obvious of calling in the sovereign power to determine when&nbsp;reprisals may be made, else every private sufferer would be&nbsp;a judge in his own cause. In pursuance of this principle,&nbsp;it is with us declared by the statute 4 Henry V. c. 7, that&nbsp;if any subjects of the realm are oppressed in time of truce&nbsp;by any foreigners, the king will grant letters of marque in&nbsp;due form to all who feel themselves aggrieved. The form&nbsp;to be observed is thus prescribed : The sufferer must first&nbsp;apply to the lord privy-seal, and he shall make out letters&nbsp;of request under the privy-seal ; and if, after such request&nbsp;of satisfaction made, the party required do not within a&nbsp;convenient time make due satisfaction or restitution to the&nbsp;party aggrieved, the lord chancellor shall make him out letters of marque and reprisal under the great seal ; and by&nbsp;virtue of these he may attack and seize the property of the&nbsp;aggressive nation, without hazard of being condemned as a&nbsp;robber or a pirate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REPROBATION, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Theology,</span><span class="font0"> means the act of aban-doning, or state of being abandoned, to eternal destruction, and is applied to that decree which God has made from all&nbsp;eternity to punish sinners who shall die in impenitence; in&nbsp;which sense it is directly opposed to election. When a&nbsp;sinner is so hardened as to feel no remorse or misgiving of&nbsp;conscience, it is considered as a sign of reprobation ; which&nbsp;by the casuists has been distinguished into positive and&nbsp;negative. The first is that by which God is supposed to&nbsp;create men with a positive and absolute resolution to damn&nbsp;them eternally. This opinion is countenanced by St Augustin and other Christian Fathers, and is a peculiar tenet&nbsp;of Calvin and most of his followers. The Church of England, in the Thirty-nine Articles, teaches something like it ;&nbsp;and the Church of Scotland, in the Confession of Faith,&nbsp;maintains it in the strongest terms. But the notion is generally exploded, and is believed by no rational divine in&nbsp;either church, being totally injurious to the justice of the&nbsp;Deity. Negative or conditional reprobation is that by which&nbsp;God, though he has a sincere desire to save men, and furnishes them with the necessary means, so that all, if they&nbsp;will, may be saved, yet sees that there are many who will&nbsp;not be saved by the means, however powerful, which are&nbsp;afforded them ; though by other means which the Deity&nbsp;sees, but will not afford them, they might be saved- Reprobation respects angels as well as men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REPRODUCTION is usually understood to mean the restoration of a thing before existing, and since destroyed.&nbsp;It is very well known that trees and plants may be raised&nbsp;from slips and cuttings ; and there are some animals which&nbsp;have the same property of being reproduced.</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REPTILIA.</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">These form the third great division of the animal kingdom, and in systematic works on natural history occupy an intermediate position between the class of birds and that of&nbsp;fishes. @@</span><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As in tracing the modifications of various organs, from the zoophytical and radiated animals to the molluscous,&nbsp;from these to the articulated classes, and onwards through&nbsp;the fishes to the reptile tribes, it is among the last named&nbsp;that we first perceive the passage from the truly aquatic to&nbsp;the terrestrial or air-breathing animal,—so the respiratory&nbsp;organs of such tribes are naturally those which excite the&nbsp;greatest and most peculiar interest. Among the more important classes of animals, respiration is effected in one or&nbsp;other of two ways ; lst, either by certain internal cellular&nbsp;sacs, for the reception of air, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lungs,</span><span class="font0"> which communicate with the mouth and nose by means of the trachea&nbsp;or windpipe; or, 2dly, by external organs called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gills,</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;require either to float in water, or to be in some other&nbsp;way continually immersed in that fluid. The object of&nbsp;both contrivances is to subject the blood to the influence&nbsp;of vital air, and this end is obtained very admirably, though</span></p><h1><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REPTILES. @@<sup>1</sup></span></h1>
<p><span class="font0">in a different way, by each. All mammiferous animals or quadrupeds, including whales, all birds, and all reptiles (in&nbsp;the perfect state), possess the first form of the respiratory&nbsp;organs ; all fishes, and several reptiles in their adolescent&nbsp;condition, are distinguished by the second. But even among&nbsp;such as are furnished with true lungs, we observe different&nbsp;modifications of the circulating system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The principal characteristic of reptiles in general consists in this, that only a portion of the blood is transmitted through the lungs, the remainder being projected by the&nbsp;heart directly to the other parts of the body, without being&nbsp;specially subjected to the influence of the respiratory organs ; whereas, in the higher classes, such as man, the rest&nbsp;of the mammalia, and birds, the whole of the blood must&nbsp;pass by the lungs before it is retransmitted to the more&nbsp;distant parts of the circulating system. The amphibious&nbsp;habits of such reptiles as are unprovided with gills, result in&nbsp;a great measure from the power which they thus possess of&nbsp;carrying on a partial circulation of the blood, independent&nbsp;of respiration. The respiration of animals, or the process&nbsp;by which the blood is oxygenated, becomes weaker and less</span></p>
