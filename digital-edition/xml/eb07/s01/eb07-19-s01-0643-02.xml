a city of Portugal, in the province of Estremadura. It is situated on a hill, which is washed by the river Tagus, and from it, such is the gradual declivity of the country, that the towers of Lisbon, though at fifty miles distance, are visible through the translucent atmosphere. The prospects from the heights above the city, either up or down the river, are enchanting. The place contains about eight thousand inhabitants, who, with the exception of a numerous body of ecclesiastics, are by no means rich. The number of churches and other religious houses is out of all proportion to the number of the inhabitants, there being thirteen churches and fourteen convents, besides places for divine worship in several of the hospitals. Great part of the town is in ruins ; and though no place may be kept clean at less expense, it is excessively filthy, both in its streets and its houses. Some parts of the country about the city are highly fertile, and yield abundant crops of grapes, olives, maize, and some wheat. It was long the station of a part of the British army during the late contest, and it was several times occupied by the French.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
