<p><span class="font1">retain the archaic structure of the central capsule whilst developing a peculiar skeleton, and on the other hand to the Monopylaea and&nbsp;Phaeodaria, which have modified the capsule but retained the&nbsp;siliceous skeleton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ The occasional total absence of any siliceous or acanthi nous skeleton does not appear to be a matter of classificatory importance,&nbsp;since skeletal elements occur in close allies of those very few forms&nbsp;which are totally devoid of skeleton. Similarly it does not appear&nbsp;to be a matter of great significance that some forms (Polycyttaria)&nbsp;form colonies, instead of the central capsules separating from one&nbsp;another after fission has occurred.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ It is important to note that the skeleton of silex or acanthin does not correspond to the shell of other Sarcodina, which appears&nbsp;rather to be represented by the membranous central capsule. The&nbsp;skeleton does, however, appear to correspond to the spicules of&nbsp;Heliozoa, and there is an undeniable affinity between such a form as&nbsp;Clathrulina and the Sphaerid Peripylaea (such as Heliosphaera,&nbsp;fig. III. 14). The Radiolaria are, however, a very strongly marked&nbsp;group, definitely separated from all other Sarcodina by the&nbsp;membranous central capsule sunk in their protoplasm. Their&nbsp;differences </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter se</span><span class="font1"> do not affect their essential structure. The variations in the chemical composition of the skeleton and in the perforation of the capsule do not appear superficially. The most obvious&nbsp;features in which they differ from one another relate to the form and&nbsp;complexity of the skeleton, a part of the organism so little characteristic of the group that it may be wanting altogether. It is not&nbsp;known how far the form-species and form-genera which have been&nbsp;distinguished in such profusion by Haeckel as the result of a study of&nbsp;the skeletons are permanent (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> relatively permanent) physiological species. There is no doubt that very many are local and&nbsp;conditional varieties, or even merely stages of growth, of a single&nbsp;Protean species. The same remark applies to the species discriminated among the shell-bearing Reticularia. It must not be supposed,&nbsp;however, that less importance is to be attached to the distinguishing&nbsp;and recording of such forms because we are not able to assert that&nbsp;they are permanent species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">streaming of the granules of the protoplasm</span><span class="font1"> has been observed in the pseudopodia of Radiolaria as in those of Heliozoa and&nbsp;Reticularia; it has also been seen in the deeper protoplasm; and&nbsp;granules have been definitely seen to pass through the pores of the&nbsp;central capsule from the intracapsular to the extracapsular protoplasm. A feeble vibrating movement of the pseudopodia has&nbsp;been occasionally noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">production of swarm-spores</span><span class="font1"> has been observed only in Acanthometra and in the Polycyttaria and Thalassicollidae, and&nbsp;only in the two latter groups have any detailed observations been&nbsp;made. Two distinct processes of swarm-spore production have&nbsp;been observed by Cienkowski, confirmed by Hertwig, —distinguished by the character of the  resulting spores, which are&nbsp;called  ‘ crystal ligerous ’and ‘isospores ’ </span><span class="font0">(fig. III. </span><span class="font1">15) in the one&nbsp;case, and ‘dimorphous ’ or ‘ anisospores ’ in the other (fig. III.</span><span class="font0">&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">16). In both processes the nucleated protoplasm within the central&nbsp;capsule breaks up by a more or less regular cell-division into small</span></p>
