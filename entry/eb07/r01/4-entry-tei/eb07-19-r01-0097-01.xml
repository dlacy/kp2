<p><label>REFRACTION</label>
in general, is the deviation of a moving body from its direct course, occasioned by the different density of the media in which it moves ; or it is a change of direction occasioned by a body’s falling obliquely out of one medium into another. The word is chiefly made use of with regard to the rays of light.
