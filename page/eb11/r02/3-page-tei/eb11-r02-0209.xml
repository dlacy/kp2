The nucleus degenerates, and is expelled with some plasm. The chromidia remain inside the shell, and differentiate or aggregate into about eight. nuclei; the cell is then resolved into as many 2-flagellate swarmers, which escape as isogamous exogametes. The zygote becomes surrounded by a brown cyst. When</p></body></text></TEI>
