<p><label>RUHR</label>
a river of Germany, an important right-bank tributary of the lower Rhine. It rises on the north side of the Winter-berg in the Sauerland, at a height of about 2000 ft. above the sea. It first takes a northerly and north-westerly course, and in a deep and well-wooded valley winds past the romantically situated town of Arnsberg. Shortly after reaching Neheim it bends to the south-west, courses through the mining district around Hagen, and receives from the left the waters of the Lenne. Hence in a tortuous course it works its way past Witten, Steele, Kettwig and MÃ¼lheim, and, after a course of 142 m., discharges itself into the Rhine at Ruhrort. From this place the Ruhr canal connects it with Duisburg. The river is navigable from Witten downwards (43 m.), by the aid of eleven locks; but navigation is often greatly impeded through dearth of water.</p>
