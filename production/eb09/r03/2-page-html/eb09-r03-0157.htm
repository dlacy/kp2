Itisan important railway junction, Iieson&nbsp;the line of the Erie Canal, and is the terminus of the Black&nbsp;River Canal.

<p><span class="font0">ROMFORD, an old market-town of Essex, is situated on the small river Rom, and on the Great Eastern Railway&nbsp;about 12 miles east-north-east of London. The ancient&nbsp;church of St Edward the Confessor was replaced in 1850&nbsp;by a structure in the Late Decorated style. The large&nbsp;brewery of Inde, Coope, &amp; Co. is situated in the town, and&nbsp;there are extensive market gardens in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;A grant of a market was obtained in 1247, and this is still&nbsp;of importance as regards both cattle and corn.

<p><span class="font0">reformer who first attempted to relax the barbarity of the English penal code, was the second son of Peter Romilly,&nbsp;a watchmaker and jeweller in London, whose father had&nbsp;emigrated from Montpellier after the revocation of the&nbsp;edict of Nantes, and who had married a Miss Garnault, a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Huguenot refugee like himself, but of a far wealthier family. Samuel Romilly was born in Frith Street, Soho, on lst&nbsp;March 1757, and was named after Sir Samuel Fludyer,&nbsp;M.P. for the city of London and alderman, who was in&nbsp;partnership with two of his uncles. He served for a time&nbsp;in his father’s shop ; but his education was not neglected,&nbsp;and he became a good classical scholar and particularly&nbsp;conversant with French literature. A legacy of £2000&nbsp;from one of his mother’s relations led to his being articled&nbsp;to a solicitor and clerk in Chancery with the idea of qualifying himself to purchase the office of one of the six clerks in&nbsp;Chancery. In 1778, however, he determined to go to the&nbsp;bar, and entered himself at Gray’s Inn. He went to Geneva&nbsp;in 1781, where he Inadetheacquaintance of the chief democratic leaders, including Étienne Dumont. Called to the bar&nbsp;in 1783, he went the midland circuit, but was chiefly occupied with Chancery practice.

Of more general&nbsp;interest is his intimacy with the great Mirabeau, to whom&nbsp;he was introduced in 1784 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mirabeau).</span><span class="font0"> Mirabeau saw&nbsp;him daily for a long time and introduced him to Lord Lansdowne, who highly appreciated him, and, when Mirabeau&nbsp;became a political leader, it was to Romilly that he applied&nbsp;for an account of the procedure used in the English House&nbsp;of Commons.
