<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">18. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kirchhoff’s addition to Stewart’s result may be given&nbsp;as follows. Let radiation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the same particular wavelength as that spoken of in § 14, fall on the substance; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">er&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of it will be absorbed, and (1 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">-e)r</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> transmitted. This will&nbsp;be recruited by the radiation of the substance itself, so&nbsp;that the whole amount for that particular wave-length&nbsp;becomes (1 - </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e)r</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> + </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eR,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r - e(r</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> - </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R).</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Thus the radiation&nbsp;is weakened only when </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R&lt;r,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> a condition which requires&nbsp;that the source (even if it be a black body) should be at&nbsp;a higher temperature than the absorbing substance (§ 4,&nbsp;above). But the converse is, of course, not necessarily&nbsp;true. This part of the subject, as well as the special work&nbsp;of Kirchhoff and of Bunsen, belongs properly to spectrum&nbsp;analysis (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Spectroscopy).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the extension of Prevost’s theory, obtained in&nbsp;either of the ways just explained, we see at once how the&nbsp;constancy of the radiation in an enclosure is maintained.&nbsp;In the neighbourhood of and perpendicular to the surfaces&nbsp;of a black body it is wholly due to radiation, near a&nbsp;transparent body wholly to transmission. A body which&nbsp;reflects must to the same extent be deficient in its radiation and transmission; thus a perfect reflector can neither&nbsp;radiate nor transmit. And a body which polarizes by&nbsp;reflexion must supply by radiation what is requisite to&nbsp;render the whole radiation unpolarized. A body, such as&nbsp;a plate of tourmaline, which polarizes transmitted light,&nbsp;must radiate light polarized in the same plane as that&nbsp;which it absorbs. Kirchhoff and Stewart independently&nbsp;gave this beautiful application.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empirical formulae representing more or less closely&nbsp;the law of cooling of bodies, whether by radiation alone or&nbsp;by simultaneous radiation and convection, have at least an&nbsp;historic interest. What is called Newton’s Law of Cooling was employed by Fourier in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Theorie Analytique&nbsp;de la Chaleur.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Here the rate of surface-loss was taken as&nbsp;proportional to the excess of temperature over surrounding&nbsp;bodies. For small differences of temperature it is accurate&nbsp;enough in its applications, such as to the corrections for&nbsp;loss of heat in experimental determinations of specific heat,&nbsp;&lt;kc., but it was soon found to give results much below the&nbsp;truth, even when the excess of temperature was only 10° C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dulong and Petit, by carefully noting the rate of&nbsp;cooling of the bulb of a large thermometer enclosed in a&nbsp;metallic vessel with blackened walls, from which the air&nbsp;had been as far as possible extracted and which was maintained at a constant temperature, were led to propound&nbsp;the exponential formula </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">AA + B</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> to represent the radiation from a black surface at temperature </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> As this is an&nbsp;exponential formula, we may take </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> as representing absolute&nbsp;temperature, for the only result will be a definite change&nbsp;of value of the constant </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> Hence if </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t<sub>0</sub></span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> be the temperature of the enclosure, the rate of loss of heat should be&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A (a<sup>1</sup> - a<sup>l</sup>°),</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ao.\u}־<sup>to</sup> -</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1). The quantity </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> was found&nbsp;by them to depend on the nature of the radiating surface,&nbsp;but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> was found to have the constant value 10077־. As&nbsp;the approximate accuracy of this expression was verified&nbsp;by the experiments of De la Provostaye and Desains for&nbsp;temperature differences up to 200° C., it may be well to&nbsp;point out two of its consequences. (1) For a given difference of temperatures the radiation is an exponential function of the lower (or of the higher) temperature. (2) For&nbsp;a given temperature of the enclosure the radiation is as&nbsp;(10-1(0077־, or 0(1+000380־+ . . . ), where 0 is the&nbsp;temperature excess of the cooling body. Thus the Newtonian law gives 4 per cent, too little at 10° C. of difference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">22. Dulong and Petit have also given an empirical&nbsp;formula for the rate of loss by simultaneous radiation and&nbsp;convection. This is of a highly artificial character, the&nbsp;part due to radiation being as in the last section, while that&nbsp;due to convection is independent of it, and also of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">nature of the surface of the cooling body. It is found to be proportional to a power of the pressure of the&nbsp;surrounding gas (the power depending on the nature of&nbsp;the gas), and also to a definite power of the temperature&nbsp;excess. The reader must be referred to French treatises,&nbsp;especially that of Desains, for further information.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">23. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our knowledge of the numerical rate of surface-emission is as yet scanty, but the following data, due to&nbsp;Nicol,@@<sup>1</sup> may be useful in approximate calculations. Loss&nbsp;in heat units (1 lb water raised 1° C. in temperature) per&nbsp;square foot per minute, from</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Bright copper ...............142־0 51־0 09־</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Blackened copper............235־1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;46־1 03־.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The temperatures of body and enclosure were 58° C. and 8° C., and the pressure of contained air in the three columns&nbsp;was about 30, 4, and 04־ inches of mercury respectively.&nbsp;The enclosure was blackened.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">24. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Scanty as is our knowledge of radiation, it is not at&nbsp;all surprising that that of convection should be almost </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nil</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">,&nbsp;except as regards some of its practical applications. Here&nbsp;we have to deal with a problem of hydrokinetics of a&nbsp;character, even in common cases, of far higher difficulty&nbsp;than many hydrokinetic problems of which not even approximate solutions have been obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is called Doppler’s Principle </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(Light, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xiv.&nbsp;p. 614) has more recently@@<sup>2</sup> led Stewart to some curious&nbsp;speculations, which a simple example will easily explain.&nbsp;Suppose two parallel plates of the same substance, perfectly transparent except to one definite wave-length, to&nbsp;be moving towards or from one another. Each, we presume, will radiate as before, and on that account cool;&nbsp;but the radiation which reaches either is no longer of the&nbsp;kind which alone it can absorb, whether it come directly&nbsp;from the other, or is part of its own or of the other’s&nbsp;radiation reflected from the enclosure. Hence it would&nbsp;appear that relative motion is incompatible with temperature equilibrium in an enclosure, and thus that there&nbsp;must be some effect analogous to resistance to the motion.&nbsp;We may get over this difficulty if we adopt the former&nbsp;speculation of Stewart, referred to in brackets in § 13&nbsp;above. For this would lead to the result that, as soon as&nbsp;either of the bodies has cooled, ever so slightly, the radiation in the enclosure should become that belonging to a&nbsp;black body of a slightly higher temperature than before,&nbsp;and thus the plates would be furnished with radiation&nbsp;which they could at once absorb, and be gradually heated&nbsp;to their former temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">26. A very recent speculation, founded by Boltzmann@@<sup>3 </sup>upon some ideas due to Bartoli, is closely connected in&nbsp;principle with that just mentioned. This speculation is&nbsp;highly interesting, because it leads to an expression for the&nbsp;amount of the whole radiation from a black body in terms&nbsp;of its absolute temperature. Boltzmann’s investigation&nbsp;may be put, as follows, in an exceedingly simple form. It&nbsp;was pointed out by Clerk Maxwell, as a result of his&nbsp;electro-magnetic theory of light, that radiation falling on&nbsp;the surface of a body must produce a certain pressure. It&nbsp;is easy to see (most simply by the analogy of the virial&nbsp;equation, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Mechanics, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xv. p. 719) that the measure of&nbsp;the pressure per square unit on the surface of an impervious enclosure, in which there is thermal equilibrium, must&nbsp;be one-third of the whole energy of radiation per cubic&nbsp;unit of the enclosed space. We may now consider a reversible engine conveying heat from one black body to&nbsp;another at a different temperature, by operations alternately&nbsp;of the isothermal and the adiabatic character </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(Thermodynamics), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">which consist in altering the volume of the en-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
