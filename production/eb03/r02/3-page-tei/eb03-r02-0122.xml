The multitude ac-quieſeed in every thing he ſaid, and refuſed to hear Collatinus ſpeak in his own defence ; ſo that the conſul was on the point of being driven out with ignominy and diſgrace, when Lucretius interpoſed, and prevailed upon Brutus to allow his colleague quietly to reſign the faſees, and retire of his own accord from the city. Brutus then, to remove all ſuſpicions of perſortal enmity, procured him a preſent of 20 talents out of the public treaſury, to which he added five of his own. Collatinus then retired to Lavinium, where he lived in peace, and at laſt died of old age.</p><p>After the abdication of Collatinus, Valerius was choſen in his room; and as his temper agreed much better ιvith Brutus than that of Collatinus, the two conſuls lived in great harmony. Nothing,however, could make the dethroned king forego the hope of recovering his kingdom by force. He firſt engaged the Volſci and Tar-quinienſes to join their forces in order to ſupport his rights. The conſuls marched out without delay to meet them. Brutus commanded the horſe and Valerius the foot, drawn up in a ſquare battalion. The two armies being in fight of each other, Brutus advanced with his cavalry, at the ſame time that A unx, one of Tarquin’s ſons, was coming forward with the enemy’s horſe, the king himſelf following with the legions. Arunx no ſooner diſcovered Brutus, than he made towards him with all the ſury of an enraged enemy. Brutus advanced towards him with no leſs ſpeed ; and as both were actuated only by motives of hatred, without thoughts of ſelſepreſervation, both of them were pierced through with their lances. The death of the two generals ſerved as a prelude to the battle, which continued with the utmoſt ſury till night, when it could not be known which ſide had got the victory, or which had</p><p>loſt the greateſt number of men. A report was ſpread, however, that a voice had been heard out of a neighbouring wood, declaring the Romans conquerors ; and this, probably a ſtratagem of Valerius, operated ſo powerfully on the ſuperſtitious minds of the Volſci, that they left their camp in confuſion, and returned to their own country. It is ſaid that Valerius, having cauſed the dead to be numbered, found that the Volſci had loſt 11,300 men, and the Romans only one ſhort of that number.</p><p>Valerius being left without a colleague in the con-ſulſhip, and having ſor ſome reaſons delayed to chooſe one, began to be ſuſpected by the people of aſpiring at the ſovereignty ; and theſe ſuſpicions were in ſome meaſure countenanced by his building a fine houſe on the ſteep part of the hill Palatinus, which overlooked the forum, and was by them conſidered as a citadel. But of this Valerius was no ſooner informed, than he cauſed this houſe to be pulled down, and immediately called an aſſembly of the people for the election of a conſul, in which he left them entirely free. They choſe Lucretius ; and, being aſhamed of having ſuſpected Valerius, they complimented him with a large ground-plot in an agreeable place, where they built him a houſe. The new conſul died a few days after his promotion, ſo that Valerius was once more left ſole go</p><lb/><p>vernor. In the interval betwixt the death of Lucretius and the choice of another conſul, Valerius gave the people ſo many ſtriking proofs of his attachment to their intereſt, that they beſtowed upon him the ſur-name of <hi rend="italic">Poplicola</hi>  or “ popular j” nor was he ever call&lt; ed by another name afterwards.</p><p>When Poplſeola’s year of conſulſhip expired, the Romans thought fit, in conſequence of the critical ſituation of affairs, to elect him a ſecond time, and joined with him T. Lucretius, the brother of the famous Lucretia. They began with reſtoring the cenfus and luſtrum ; and found the number of Roman citizens, at or above the age of puberty, to amount to 130,000. As they apprehended an attack from the Latins on account of Tarquin, they were at great pains to fortify Sinquirinum or Siugliuria, an important poſt on that ſide. Contrary to their expectations, however, the Latins remained quiet ; but an haughty embaſſy was received from Porſena king of Cluſium in Hetruria, commanding them either to take back the Tarquins to Rome, or to reſtore them their eſtates. To the firſt of theſe demands the conſuls returned an abſolute refuſal : and, as to the ſecond, they anſwered, that it was impracticable ; a part of thoſe eſtates having been conſecrated to Mars, and the reſt divided among indigent people, from whom they could not be recovered. The imminent danger which now threatened the city, procured Valerius the honour of a third conſulſhip ; and with him was joined Horatius Pulvilius, who had en</p><p>joyed the dignity for a few months before in the inter’ val betwixt the death of Lucretius and the expiration of the firſt conſulate.</p><p>While the Romans were making the moſt vigorous preparations for defence, Porſena, attended by his ſon Arunx and the exiles, marched towards the city at the head of a formidable army, which was quickly joined by a conſiderable body of Latins under Mamilius, the ſon-in law of Tarquin. The conſuls and the ſenate took all imaginable care to ſupply the common people with proviſions, leſt famine ſhould induce them to open the gates to Tarquin ; and they deſired the country people to lodge their effects in the fort Janiculum, which overlooked the city, and which was the only <hi rend="italic">for-</hi>tified place poſſeſſed by the Romans on that ſide the Tiber. Porſena, however, ſoon drove the Romans out of this fort ; upon which the conſuls made all their troops paſs the river, and drew them up in order of battle to defend the bridge, while Porſena advanced to engage them. The victory was a long time doubtful j but at laſt the Romans fled. Horatius Codes, nephew to the conſul, with Sp. Lartius and T. Herminius, who had commanded the right-wing, poſted themſelves at the entrance of the bridge, and for a long time bravely defended it: but at laſt, the defenſive arms of Lartius and Herminius being broken, they retired; and then Horatius deſiring them to adviſe the conſuls from him to cut the bridge at the other end, he for a while ſuſtained the attack of the enemy alone. At laſt, being wounded in the thigh, and the ſignal given that the bridge was almoſt broken down, he leaped into the river, and ſwam acroſs it through a ſhower of darts. The Romans, in token of gratitude for this eminent ſervice, erected a ſtatue to him in the temple of Vulcan, gave him as much land as he himſelf with one yoke of oxen could plough in one day ; and each of the inha-</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
