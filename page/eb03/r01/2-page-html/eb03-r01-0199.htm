<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, the national aſſembly was haſſen-ing faſt to the completion of the new conſtitution. It was ſiniſhed on the 3d of September, and prefented to&nbsp;the king. It begins with the following declaration of&nbsp;the rights of a man and a citizen, and thereafter foliow&nbsp;the different branches; the chief of which are here translated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All men are born, and remain, free and equal in&nbsp;rights : ſocial diſtinctions cannot be founded but on common utility.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The end of all political aſſociations is the pre-ſervation of the natural and impreſcriptihle rights of&nbsp;man : theſc rights are liberty, property, ſecurity, and&nbsp;reſiſtance againſt oppreſſion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">III. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principle of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ſovereignty</span><span class="font1"> reſides eſſentially&nbsp;in the nation : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">no body of men,</span><span class="font1"> no </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">individual,</span><span class="font1"> can exer*&nbsp;ciſe an authority that does not emanate expreſsly from&nbsp;that fource.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">IV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Liberty</span><span class="font1"> conſiſts in the power of doing every&nbsp;thing except that which is hurtful to another : hence&nbsp;the exercife of the natural rights of every man has no&nbsp;other bounds than thoſc that are neceſſary to enſure to&nbsp;the other members of ſociety the enjoyment of the&nbsp;ſame rights : thoſe bounds can be determined by the&nbsp;law only.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law has a right to forbid thoſc actions alone&nbsp;that are hurtful to ſociety. whatever is not forbid-den by the law, cannot be hindered ; and no perſon can&nbsp;be conſtrained to do that which the law ordaineth not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">VI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law is the expreffion of the general will : all&nbsp;the citizens have a right to concur perſonally, or by&nbsp;their repreſentatives, to the formation oſ the law : it&nbsp;ought to be the ſame for all, whether it protect, or&nbsp;whether it puniſh. All citizens being equal in the eye&nbsp;of the law, are equally admiffible to dignities, places,&nbsp;and public offices, according to their capacity, and&nbsp;without any other diſtinction but that of their virtue&nbsp;and their talents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">VII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No man can be accuſcd, arreſted, or detained,&nbsp;except in cafes determined by the law, and according&nbsp;to the forms which the law hath preſcribed. Thoſc&nbsp;who folicit, diſpatch, execute, or cauſe to be executed,&nbsp;arbitrary orders, ought to be pnniſhed ; but every citi-zen that is ſummoned or ſeized in virtue of the law,&nbsp;ought to obey inſtantly—he becomes culpable by reſiſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">VIII. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law ought to eſtabliſh ſuch puniſhments&nbsp;only as are ſtrictly and evidently neceſſary ; and no&nbsp;perſon can be puniſhed but in virtue of a law eſta-bliſhed and promulgated prior to the offence, and le-gally applied.</span></p>
