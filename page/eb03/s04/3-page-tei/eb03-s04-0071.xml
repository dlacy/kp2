The fiſhes commonly caught on the coaſt are herrings, ling, cod, ſcate, haddock, mackerel, lythe, ſye, and dog-fiſh. The average price of ling at home is L. 13, 13 s. <hi rend="italic">per</hi> ton ; when sold, one by one, if freſh, the price is from 3 d. to 5 d. ; if cured, from 5 d. to 7d. The barrel of herrings ſeldom falls under 19 s. which is owing to the great difficulty of procuring ſalt, even ſometimes at any price ; and the ſame cauſe prevents many from taking more than are ſufficient for their own uſe.</p><p>The kyle of Scalpe teems with oyſters; in ſuch a manner, that after ſome ſpring-tides, 20 horſe-loads of them are left upon the ſands. Near the village of Bern- ftill, the beach yields muſcles ſufficient to maintain 60 perſons <hi rend="italic">per</hi> ; this providential ſupply helps to ſupport many poor families in times of ſcarcity.</p><p>The people are ſtrong, robuſt, healthy, and prolific. They generally proſeſs the Proteſtant religion ; are honeſt, brave, innocent, and hoſpitable. They ſpeak the language, wear the habit, and obſerve the cuſtoms that are common to all the Hebrides. The meconium in new-born infants is purged away with fresh butter : the children are bathed every morning and evening in water, and grow up ſo ſtrong, that a child of 10 months is able to walk alone : they never wear ſhoes or ſtockings before the age of eight or ten, and night-caps are hardly known ; they keep their ſeet always wet ; they lie on beds of ſtraw or heath, which laſt is an excellent reſtorative : they are quick of apprehenſion, ingenious, and very much addicted to muſic and poetry. They eat heartily of fiſh ; but ſeldom regale themſelves with fleſh-meat : their ordinary food conſiſts of butter, cheeſe, milk, potatoes, colewort, brochan, and a diſh called <hi rend="italic">oon,</hi> which indeed is no other than the froth of boiled milk or whey raiſed with a ſtick like that uſed in making chocolate.</p><p>A sort of coarſe woollen cloth called <hi rend="italic">cloa,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">caddoes,</hi> the manufacture of their waves, made into ſhort jackets and trouſers, is the common dreſs of the men. The philibeg is rarely worn, except in ſummer and on Sundays ; on which days, and ſome other occasions, thoſe in better circumſtances appear in tartans, a bonnet, and ſhort hoſe, and ſome in a hat, ſhort coat, waiſtcoat, and breeches, of Scotch or Engliſh manufacture. The women are in general very cleanly, and ſo exceſſively fond of dreſs, that many maid-ſervants are often known to lay out their whole wages that way.</p><p>There are two fairs held annually at Portree, to which almoſt every part of Sky sends cattle. The firſt is held in the end of May, and the ſecond in the end of July. The fair commonly continues from Wedneſday till the Saturday following. The commodities which are sold in theſe are horſes, cows, ſheep, goats, hides, butter, cheeſe, fiſh, and wool. The cattle fold in theſe fairs ſwim over to the main land through a mile or half a mile of ſea. Thouſands of theſe are yearly exported, at from L. 2 to L. 3 each. Many of them are driven to England, where they are fatted for the market, and counted delicious eating.</p><p>In Sky appear many ruins oſ Daniſh forts, watch-</p><p>towers, beacons, temples, and ſepulchral monuments. All the forts are known by the term <hi rend="italic">Dun ;</hi> ſuch as Dun-Skudborg, Dun-Derig, Dun-Skerineſs, Dun-Da- vid, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SKY-Colour.</hi> To give this colour to glaſs, ſet in the furnace a pot of pure metal of fritt from rochetta or barilla, but the rochetta fritt does beſt ; as ſoon as the metal is well purified, take for a pot of twenty pounds of metal six ounces of braſs calcined by itſelf; put it by degrees at two or three times into the metal, ſtirring and mixing it well every time, and diligently ſkimming the metal with a ladle : at the end of two hours the whole will be well mixed, and a proof may be taken ; if the colour be found right, let the whole ſtand 24 hours longer in the furnace, and it will then be fit to work, and will prove of a moſt beautiful ſky colour.</p><p>SLAB, an outside ſappy plank or board ſawed off from the ſides of a timber-tree. The word is alſo uſed for a flat piece of marble.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Slab</hi><hi rend="italic">-Line,</hi> in ſea-language, a ſmall cord paſſing up behind a ſhip’s main-ſail or fore-ſail, and being reeved through a block attached to the lower part of the yard, is thence tranſmitted in two branches to the foot of the  sail, to which it is faſtened. It is uſed to truſs up the ſail as occaſion requires, and more particularly for the convenience of the pilot or ſteerſman, that they may look forward beneath it as the ſhip advances.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SLACK-water,</hi> in ſea-language, denotes the interval between the flux and reflux of the tide, or between the laſt of the ebb and the firſt of the flood, during which the current is interrupted, and the water apparently remains in a ſtate of reſt.</p><p>SLACKEN, in metallurgy, a term uſed by the miners to expreſs a ſpongy and ſemivitrified ſubſtance, which they uſed to mix with the ores of metals, to prevent their fuſion. It is the ſcoria or ſcum ſeparated from the ſurface of the former fuſions of metals. To this they frequently add limeſtone, and ſometimes a kind of coarſe iron-ore, in the running of the poorer gold ores.</p><p>SLATE (Stegania), a ſtone of a compact texture and laminated ſtructure, ſplitting into fine plates.</p><p>Dr Hill diſtinguiſhes four ſpecies oſ ſtegania. 1. The whitiſh ſteganium, being a ſoft, friable, ſlaty ſtone, of a tolerably ſine and cloſe texture, conſiderably heavy, perfectly dull and deſtitute of brightneſs, variegated with a pale brown or browniſh yellow. This ſpecies is common in many counties of England, lying near the surface of the ground. It is generally very full of perpendicular as well as horizontal cavities, many of which are filled up with a ſpar a little purer and more cryſtalline than the reſt; and is commonly uſed for covering houſes. 2. The red ſteganium is a very fine and elegant ſtate, of a ſmooth ſurface, firm and compact texture, conſiderably heavy, and of a very beautiful pale purple, glittering all over with ſmall glossy ſpangles : it is compoſed of a multitude of very thin plates or flakes, laid cloſely and evenly over one another, and cohering pretty firmly : this is very common in the northern parts of England, and is much valued as a ſtrong and beautiful covering for houſes. 3. The common blue ſteganium is very well known as an uſeful and valuable ſtone, of a fine ſmooth texture and glossy ſurface, moderately heavy, and of a pale greyiſh blue ; compoſed of a multi</p></body></text></TEI>
