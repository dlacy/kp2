<p><span class="font1">prevail upon him, by giving him hopes of ſucceeding to the empire ; inſinuating, that he himſelf was declining, and his children were as yet but infants. To deceive him ſtill farther, he wrote in the ſame ſtyle to the&nbsp;ſenate, gave him the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caſar.,</span><span class="font1"> and ordered money&nbsp;to be coined with his image. Theſe artifices ſerving to&nbsp;lull Albimιs into falſe ſecurity, Severus marched againſt&nbsp;Niger with all his forces. After ſome undeciſive conflicts, the laſt great battle that was fought between&nbsp;theſe extraordinary men was upon the plains of Iſſus,&nbsp;on the very ſpot where Alexander had formerly conquered Darius. Beſides the two great armies drawn up&nbsp;on the plain, the neighbouring mountains were covered&nbsp;with infinite numbers of people, who were merely led&nbsp;by curioſity to become ſpectators of an engagement that&nbsp;was to determine the empire of the world. Severus was&nbsp;conqueror ; and Niger’s head being ſtruck off by ſome&nbsp;ſoldiers of the conquering army, was inſultingly carried through the camp on the point of a lance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This victory ſecured Severus in the poſſeſſion of the throne. However, the Parthians, Perſians, and ſome&nbsp;other neighbouring nations, took up arms, under a pretence of vindicating Niger’s cauſe. The emperor marched againſt them in perſon, had many engagements with&nbsp;them, and obtained ſuch ſignal victories over them,&nbsp;as enlarged the empire, and eſtabliſhed peace in the&nbsp;eaſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Niger being no more, Severus now turned his views againſt Albinus, whom he reſolved by every means to&nbsp;deſtroy. For this purpoſe he ſent aſſaſſins into Britain,&nbsp;under a pretence of bringing him letters, but in reality&nbsp;to diſpatch him. Albinus being appriſed of their deſigns, prevented their attempt by recurring to open&nbsp;force and proclaiming himſelf emperor. Nor was he&nbsp;without a powerful army to ſupport his pretenſions ; of&nbsp;which Severus being ſenſible, bent his whole force to&nbsp;oppoſe him. From the eaſt he continued his courſe&nbsp;acroſs the ſtraits of Byzantium, into the moſt weſtern&nbsp;parts of Europe, without intermiſſion. Albinus being&nbsp;informed of his approach, went over to meet him with&nbsp;his forces into Gaul ; ſo that the campaign on both&nbsp;ſides was carried on with great vigour. Fortune ſeemed&nbsp;for a while variable ; but at laſt a deciſive engagement&nbsp;came on, which was one of the moſt deſperate recorded&nbsp;in the Roman hiſtory. It laſted front morning till&nbsp;night, without any ſeeming advantage on either ſide ;&nbsp;at length the troops of Severus began to fly, and he&nbsp;himſelf happening to fall from his horſe, the army&nbsp;of Albinus cried out, Victory. But the engagement&nbsp;was ſoon renewed with vigour by Lætus, one of Seve-rus’s commanders, who came up with a body of reſerve,&nbsp;deſigning to deſtroy both parties and make himſelf emperor. This attempt, though deſigned againſt both,&nbsp;turned out entirely to the advantage of Severus. He&nbsp;therefore again charged with fιich fury and exactneſs,&nbsp;that he ſoon plucked the victory from thoſe who but a&nbsp;ſhort time before ſeemed conquerors ; and purſuing&nbsp;them into the city of Lyons, took Albinus priſoner,&nbsp;and cut off his head ; treating his dead body with inſults that could only flow from a mean and revengeſul&nbsp;temper. All the ſenators who were ſlain in battle he&nbsp;ordered to be quartered, and ſuch as were taken alive&nbsp;were immediately executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Having thus ſecured himſelf in poſſeſſion of the empire, upon his return to Rome he loaded his ſoldiers with rewards and honours ; giving them ſuch privileges as&nbsp;ſtrengthened his own power, while they deſtroyed that&nbsp;of the ſtate. For the ſoldiers, who had hitherto ſhowed&nbsp;the ſtrongeſt inclination to an abuſe of power, were now&nbsp;made arbiters of the ſate of emperors ; and we ſhall&nbsp;henceforward behold them ſetting them up, and dethroning them, at pleaſure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Being thus ſecure of his army, he reſolved to give way to his natural turn for conqueſt, and to oppoſe his&nbsp;arms againſt the Parthians, who were then invading the&nbsp;frontiers of the empire. Having therefore previouſly&nbsp;given the government of domeſtic policy to one Plautianus, a particular favourite of his, to whoſe daughter&nbsp;he married his ſon Caracalla, he ſet out for the eaſt, and&nbsp;proſecuted the war with his uſual expedition and ſucceſs. He forced ſubmiſſion ſrom the king of Armenia,&nbsp;deſtroyed ſeveral cities in Arabia Felix, landed on the&nbsp;Parthian coaſts, took and plundered the famous city&nbsp;Cteſiphon, marched back through Paleſtine and Egypt,&nbsp;and at length returned to Rome in triumph.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During this interval, Plautianus, who was leſt to direct the affairs of Rome, began to think of aſpiring to the empire himſelf. Upon the emperor’s return, he&nbsp;employed a tribune of the prætorian cohorts, of which&nbsp;he was the commander, to aſſaſſinate him, as likewiſe&nbsp;his ſon Caracalla. The tribune ſeemed cheerfully to&nbsp;undertake this dangerous office ; but inſtead </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font1"> going&nbsp;through with it, informed Severus of his favourite’s&nbsp;treachery. He at firſt received it as an improbable&nbsp;ſtory, and as the artifice of ſome one who envied his&nbsp;favourite’s fortune. However, he was at laſt perſuaded&nbsp;to permit the tribune to conduct Plautianus to the emperor’s apartments. With this intent, the tribune went&nbsp;and amuſed him with a pretended account of his killing the emperor and his ſon, deſiring him, if he thought&nbsp;it lit to ſee them dead, to come with him to the palace. As Plautianus ardently deſired their deaths, he&nbsp;readily gave credit to this relation ; and following the&nbsp;tribune, he was conducted at midnight into the innermoſt receſſes of the palace. But what </span><span class="font0">miiſt </span><span class="font1">have been&nbsp;his diſappointment, when, inſtead of finding the emperor lying dead, as he expected, he beheld the room&nbsp;lighted up with torches, and Severus, ſurrounded by&nbsp;his friends, prepared in array to receive him. Being&nbsp;aſhed by the emperor, with a ſtern countenance, what&nbsp;had brought him there at that unſeaſonable time ? he&nbsp;was at firſt utterly confounded ; wherefore, not knowing what excuſe to make, he ingenuouſly conſeſſed the&nbsp;whole, intreating forgiveneſs for what he had intended.&nbsp;The emperor ſeemed in the beginning inclined to pardon ; but Caracalla his ſon, who from the earlieſt age&nbsp;ſhowed a diſpoſition to cruelty, ſpurned him away in&nbsp;the midſt of his ſupplications, and with his ſword ran&nbsp;him through the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Severus having eſcaped this danger, ſpent a conſiderable time in viliting ſome cities in Italy, permitting none of his officers to ſell places of truſt or dignity, and&nbsp;diſtributing juſtice with the ſtricteſt impartiality. He&nbsp;took ſuch an exact order in managing his exchequer,&nbsp;that, notwithſtanding his great expences, he left more&nbsp;money behind him than any of his predeceſſors. His&nbsp;armies alſo were kept upon the moſt reſpectable footing ; ſo that he feared no invaſion. Being equally attentive to the preſervation of all parts of the empire,&nbsp;he reſolved to make his laſt expedition into Britain,</span></p>
