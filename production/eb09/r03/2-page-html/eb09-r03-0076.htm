        <p><span class="font1">endeavoured to organize. Bankrupt nobles like himself, Sullan
                veterans and the starving peasants whom they had&nbsp;dispossessed of their
                holdings, outlaws of every description, the slave population of Rome, and the
                wilder&nbsp;herdsmen-slaves of the Apulian pastures, were all enlisted&nbsp;under
                his banner, and attempts were even made to excite&nbsp;disaffection among the
                newly-conquered people of southern Gaul and the warlike tribes who still cherished
                the&nbsp;memory of Sertorius in Spain. In Etruria, the seat and&nbsp;centreof
                agrarian distress and discontent, arising actually&nbsp;took place headed by a
                Sullan centurion, but the spread of&nbsp;the revolt was checked by Cicero’s vigorous
                measures.&nbsp;Catiline fled from Rome, and died fighting with
                desperate&nbsp;courage at the head of his motley force of old
                soldiers,&nbsp;peasants, and slaves. His accomplices in Rome were&nbsp;arrested,
                and, after an unavailing protest from Cæsar,&nbsp;the senate authorized the consuls
                summarily to put them&nbsp;to death.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Catilinarian outbreak had been a blow to Cæsar, whose schemes it
                interrupted, but to Cicero it brought,&nbsp;not only popularity and honour, but, as
                he believed, the&nbsp;realization of his political ideal. The senate and
                the&nbsp;equestrian order, the nobles of Rome and the middle&nbsp;class in the
                country, had made common cause in the face&nbsp;of a common danger ; and the danger
                had been averted&nbsp;by the vigorous action of a consul sprung from the
                people,&nbsp;under the guidance of a united senate, and backed by&nbsp;the mass of
                good citizens.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">But Pompey was now on his way home,@@<sup>1</sup> and again as in 70
                the political future seemed to depend on the&nbsp;attitude which the successful
                general would assume ;&nbsp;Pompey himself looked simply to the attainment by
                the&nbsp;help of one political party or another of his immediate&nbsp;aims, which at
                present were the ratification of his&nbsp;arrangements in Asia and a grant of land
                for his troops.&nbsp;It was the impracticable jealousy of his personal rivals
                in&nbsp;the senate, aided by the versatility of Cæsar, who presented himself not as
                his rival but as his ally, which drove&nbsp;Pompey once more, in spite of Cicero’s
                efforts, into the&nbsp;camp of what was still nominally the popular party.
                In&nbsp;60, on Cæsar’s return from his proprætorship in Spain,&nbsp;the coalition
                was formed which is known by the somewhat misleading title of the first
                    triumvirate.@@<sup>2</sup> Pompey&nbsp;was ostensibly the head of this new
                alliance, and in return&nbsp;for the satisfaction of his own demands he undertook
                to&nbsp;support Cæsar’s candidature for the consulship. The&nbsp;wealth and
                influence of Crassus were enlisted in the same&nbsp;cause, but what he was to
                receive in exchange is not&nbsp;clear. Cicero was under no illusions as to the
                significance&nbsp;of this coalition. It scattered to the winds his dreams&nbsp;of a
                stable and conservative republic. Pompey, whom he&nbsp;had hoped to enlist as the
                champion of constitutional&nbsp;government, had been driven into the arms of
                Cæsar.&nbsp;The union between the senate and the equestrian order&nbsp;had been
                dissolved, and the support of the publicani lost&nbsp;by an untimely quarrel over
                the price to be paid for&nbsp;collecting the taxes of Asia, and, to crown all, both
                his&nbsp;own personal safety and the autnority of the senate were&nbsp;threatened by
                the openly avowed intentions of Catiline’s&nbsp;friends to bring the consul of 63 to
                account for his&nbsp;unconstitutional execution of Catiline’s accomplices.
                His&nbsp;fears were fully justified by the results. The year 59 saw&nbsp;the
                republic powerless in the hands of three citizens.&nbsp;Cæsar as consul procured the
                ratification of Pompey’s&nbsp;acts in Asia, conciliated the publicani by granting
                them</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">the relief refused by the senate, and carried an agrarian law of the
                new type, which provided for the purchase of&nbsp;lands for allotment at the cost of
                the treasury, and for&nbsp;the assignment of the rich “ager Campanus.”@@<sup>3</sup>
                But&nbsp;Cæsar aimed at more than the carrying of an agrarian&nbsp;law in the teeth
                of the senate or any party victory in the&nbsp;forum. An important military command
                was essential&nbsp;to him, and he judged correctly enough that in the
                West&nbsp;there was work to be done which might enable him to&nbsp;win a position
                such as Pompey had achieved in the East.&nbsp;An obedient tribune was found, and by
                the lex Vatinia&nbsp;he was given for rive years the command of Cisalpine&nbsp;Gaul
                and Illyricum, to which was added by a decree of&nbsp;the senate Transalpine Gaul
                    also.@@<sup>4</sup> It was a command&nbsp;which not only opened to him a great
                military career,&nbsp;but enabled him, as the master of the valley of the Po,
                to&nbsp;keep an effective watch on the course of affairs in Italy.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Early the next year the attack upon himself which Cicero had foreseen
                was made. P. Clodius as tribune&nbsp;brought forward a law enacting that any one who
                had put a&nbsp;Roman citizen to death without trial by the people should&nbsp;be
                interdicted from fire and water. Cicero finding himself deserted even by Pompey left
                Rome in a panic, and&nbsp;by a second Clodian law he was declared to be
                    outlawed.@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>With Cæsar away in his province, and Cicero
                banished,&nbsp;Clodius was for the time master in Rome. But, absolute&nbsp;as he was
                in the streets, and recklessly as he parodied the&nbsp;policy of the Gracchi by
                violent attacks on the senate,&nbsp;his tribunate merely illustrated the anarchy
                which now&nbsp;inevitably followed the withdrawal of a strong controlling&nbsp;hand.
                A reaction speedily followed. Pompey, bewildered&nbsp;and alarmed by Clodius’s
                violence, at last bestirred himself.&nbsp;Cicero’s recall was decreed by the senate,
                and early in&nbsp;August 57 in the comitia centuriata, to which his
                Italian&nbsp;supporters flocked in crowds, a law was passed revoking&nbsp;the
                sentence of outlawry passed upon him.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Intoxicated by the acclamations which greeted him, and encouraged by
                Pompey’s support, and by the salutary&nbsp;effects of Clodius’s excesses, Cicero’s
                hopes rose high,&nbsp;and a return to the days of 63 seemed not
                    impossible.@@<sup>6</sup> With indefatigable energy he strove to
                reconstruct&nbsp;a solid constitutional party, but only to fail once
                more.&nbsp;Pompey was irritated by the hostility of a powerful party&nbsp;in the
                senate, who thwarted his desires for a fresh command and even encouraged Clodius in
                insulting the&nbsp;conqueror of the East. Cæsar became alarmed at the&nbsp;reports
                which reached him that the repeal of his agrarian&nbsp;law was threatened and that
                the feeling against the coalition was growing in strength ; above all he was
                anxious&nbsp;for a renewal of his five years’ command. He acted at&nbsp;once, and in
                the celebrated conference at Luca (56) the&nbsp;alliance of the three
                self-constituted rulers of Rome was&nbsp;renewed. Cicero succumbed to the inevitable
                and withdrew in despair from public life. Pompey and Crassus&nbsp;became consuls for
                55. Cæsar’s command was renewed <sup></sup>for another five years, and to each of
                his two allies important provinces were assigned for a similar
            period—Pompey</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the history of the next
                eighteen years, the most important&nbsp;ancient authority is Cicero in his letters

        <p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Misleading, because the coalition
                was unofficial. The “triumvirs” of 43 were actual magistrates, “ πιviri reipublicae
