<p><span class="font0">members of the hierarchy known as prelates </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Praclali),</span><span class="font0"> who possess this power </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Polcslasjurisdiclionis in foro exlerno),</span><span class="font0"> whether&nbsp;bishops or priests, derive it from the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These jurisdictions are of very varied character, and in most cases are not peculiar to the Roman Catholic Church. They&nbsp;include those of patriarchs, archbishops, metropolitans and&nbsp;bishops in the first rank of the hierarchy, with their subordinate&nbsp;officials, such as archdeacons, archpriests, deans and canons, &amp;c.,&nbsp;in the lower ranks. AU of these will be found described under&nbsp;their proper headings (see also </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The basis of the organization of the Church is territorial, the&nbsp;world being mapped out into dioceses or, in countries where&nbsp;the Roman Church is not well developed—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> missions in non-Christian lands—into Apostolic Vicariates. The dioceses are&nbsp;grouped in various ways; some are immediately dependent&nbsp;upon the Holy See; some are grouped in ecclesiastical provinces&nbsp;or metropolitanates, which in their turn are sometimes grouped&nbsp;together to form a patriarchate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to the official </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gerarchia Caltolica,</span><span class="font0"> published at Rome, there were in 1909 ten patriarchates, with fourteen patriarchal&nbsp; sees (including those of the Oriental rite, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> those Eastern communities which, though in communion with Rome, have been allowed to retain their peculiar ritual discipline). Of these the four&nbsp;greater patriarchates are those of Alexancfria (with two patriarchs,&nbsp;Latin and Coptic); Anticch (with four, Latin, Graeco-Melchite,&nbsp;Maronite and Syriac); Constantinople (Latin) and Jerusalem&nbsp;(Latin). The lesser patriarchates arc those of Babylon (Chaldaic),&nbsp;Cilicia (Armenian), the East lndies (Latin), Lisbon (Latin), Venice&nbsp;(Latin) and the West indies (Latin). (See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Patriarch.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The archiépiscopal sees number 204. Of these 21 are immediately subject to the Holy See, while those of the Latin rite having ecclesiastical provinces number 164. There are 19 of the Oriental&nbsp;rite : 3 with ecclesiastical provinces, viz. Armenian, Graeco-Rumanian&nbsp;and Graeco-Ruthenian respectively; the rest are subject to the&nbsp;patriarchates, viz. 2 Armenian, 3 Graeco-Melchite, 3 Syriac, 2 Syro-Chaldaic, 6 Syro-Maronite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of episcopal sees of the Latin rite 6 are suburbican sees of the cardinal bishops, 85 are immediately subject to the Holy See, and&nbsp;662 are suffragan sees in ecclesiastical provinces. Of those of the&nbsp;Oriental rite one (Graeco-Ruthenian) is immediately subject to the&nbsp;Holy See; 9 are suffragan sees in ecclesiastical provinces, viz. 3&nbsp;Graeco-Rumanian and 6 Graeco-Ruthenian ; the rest are subject&nbsp;to the patriarchates, viz. 15 Armenian, 2.Coptic, 9 Graeco-Melchite,&nbsp;5 Syriac, 9 Syro-Chaldaic, 2 Syro-Melchite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The whole number of these </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">residential</span><span class="font0"> sees, including the patriarchates, is 1023. Besides these there are 610 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">titular</span><span class="font0"> secs, formerly called sees </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in partibus infidelium,</span><span class="font0"> the archbishops and bishops of&nbsp;which are not bound to residence. These titles are generally&nbsp;assigned to bishops appointed to Apostolic Delegations, Vicariates&nbsp;and Prefectures, or to the office of coadjutor, auxiliary or administrator of a diocese. (See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Archbishop</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bishop.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The dioceses are divided into parishes, variously grouped, the most usual organization being that of deaneries. In the parish&nbsp;the authority of the Church is brought into intimate touch&nbsp;with the daily life of the people. The main duties of the parish&nbsp;priest are to offer the sacrifice of the mass </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> to hear confessions, to preach, to baptize and to administer extreme&nbsp;unction to the dying. It is true to say that in the “ cure of&nbsp;souls ” the confessional plays a larger part in the Church than&nbsp;the pulpit (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Confession</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Absolution).</span><span class="font0"> For the official&nbsp;costume of the various orders of clergy see the article </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vestments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The clergy of the Roman Catholic Church are furthermore divided into regulär and secular. The regular clergy are those&nbsp;attached to religious orders and to certain congregations (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Monasticism).</span><span class="font0"> Of these the former are outside the normal&nbsp;organization of the Church, being exempt from the ordinary&nbsp;jurisdiction of the diocesan bishops, while the more recently&nbsp;formed congregations are either wholly or largely subject to&nbsp;episcopal authority. By far the most powerful of the religious&nbsp;orders are the Jesuits </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font0"> The secular clergy, on the other&nbsp;hand, are bound by no vows beyond those proper to their&nbsp;orders. Both regular and secular clergy (those at least in major&nbsp;orders) are under the obligation of celibacy, which, by cutting&nbsp;them off from the most intimate common interests of the&nbsp;people, has proved a most powerful disciplinary force in the&nbsp;hands of the popes (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Celibacy).</span><span class="font0"> The more complete&nbsp;isolation of the regular clergy, however, together with their&nbsp;direct relation to the Holy See, has made them, not only the&nbsp;more effective instruments of papal authority, but more obnoxious to the peoples and governments of countries where they&nbsp;have gained any considerable power. Thcir privileged position,&nbsp;moreover, leads everywhere to a certain amount of friction&nbsp;between them and the secular clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In doctrine the Roman Catholic Church is divided from the orthodox communions of the East mainly by the claims of&nbsp;the papacy, which the Orientals reject, and the question of&nbsp;the “ Procession of the Holy Ghost ” (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Church History).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">From the Protestant communities which were the outcome&nbsp;of the Reformation the divergence is more profound, though&nbsp;the central dogmas of the faith are common to Roman Catholics&nbsp;and orthodox Protestants. The difference Bcs essentially in&nbsp;the belief held as to the means by which the truths defined&nbsp;in these dogmas are to be made effective for the salvation of&nbsp;the world. It was defined in the canons of the council of&nbsp;Trent, as promulgated by Pope Pius IV. in 1564, in which the&nbsp;main theses of the Reformers as to the character of the Church,&nbsp;the sufficiency of Holy Scriptures, the nature of the sacraments, and the like were finally condemned (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Trent, Council&nbsp;of).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Roman Cathohc Church is by far the most widespread, numerous and powerful of all the Christian communions. It&nbsp;is the dominant Church in the majority of European states,&nbsp;in South and Central America and in Mexico; it is the largest&nbsp;single religious body in the United States of America, while&nbsp;in certain Protestant countries, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> Prussia and the United&nbsp;Kingdom, it has great religious and political influence. Any&nbsp;statistics of its membership, however, must necessarily be&nbsp;misleading. Those published are generally based on the&nbsp;principle of deducting the Protestant from the general population of “ CathoUc ” countries and ascribing the rest to the&nbsp;Roman Church. This may be possible in Germany and other&nbsp;countries where there is a religious census; but it is, at best, a&nbsp;rough-and-ready method where, as in Italy or France, besides&nbsp;the class of “ political ” or “ non-practising ” Catholics, large&nbsp;numbers of the people are more or less actively hostile to&nbsp;Christianity itself. (For Roman Cathohc missionary work see&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Missions.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Unial or United Orienlal Churches.</span><span class="font0">—The Ovenvhelming majority of the adherents of the Roman Catholic Church&nbsp;throughout the world belong to the Latin rite, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> follow the&nbsp;usages and traditions of the Western Church.@@<sup>1</sup> Ever since the&nbsp;schism of East and West, however, it has been an ambition of&nbsp;the papacy to submit the Oriental Churches to its jurisdiction,&nbsp;and successive popes have from time to time succeeded in&nbsp;detaching portions of those Churches and bringing them into&nbsp;the obedience of the Holy See. This has only been possible&nbsp;owing to the temper of the Oriental mind which, while clinging&nbsp;tenaciously to its rites, values dogma only in so far as it is&nbsp;expressed in rites. The popes, then, or at least the more politic&nbsp;of them, have been content to lay down as the condition of&nbsp;reunion no more than the acceptance of the distinctive dogmas&nbsp;of the Roman Catholic Church, especiqjly the supremacy and&nbsp;infallibility of the pope; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rilus</span><span class="font0"> of the Uniat Oriental Churches&nbsp;—liturgies and liturgical languages, ecclesiastical law and&nbsp;discipline, marriage of priests, beards and costume, the monastic&nbsp;system of St Basil—they have been content for the most part&nbsp;to leave untouched. The attempts of Pius IX., who in 1862&nbsp;established the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Congregatio de propaganda fide pro negoliis&nbsp;rilus Oricnlalis,</span><span class="font0"> to interfere in a Romanizing sense with the&nbsp;rites of the Armenians and Chaldaeans (by the bulls </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rcxersnrus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of 1867 and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cum Ecclesiaslica</span><span class="font0"> of 1869) led to a schism; and&nbsp;Lco XIII., who more than all his predecessors interested himself&nbsp;in the question of reunion, reverted to and developed the wiser</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup>The Latin werd covers not only the ordinary meaning of the modern English word “ rite,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> ” a formal procedure or&nbsp;act in a religious or other solemn function,” or any “ custom or&nbsp;practice of a formal kind,” but the sense in which it is now obsolete in England—except in the religious connotation here used—&nbsp;of ” the general or usual custom, habit or practice of a country,&nbsp;people, class of persons, &amp;c.” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(New English Did.</span><span class="font0"> s.v.).
