In its. flouriſhing ſtate it was of great extent, and comprifed∙ within its walls 27 churches, and as many convents.— Its preſent circumference is ſearcely half an Engliſh mile, and it contains only about 1620 ſou.ls. The houſes are of brick, and of a neat appearance. The only remains of its original magnificence are the ruins of a palace and of the cathedral, a brick building with two ſpires, in which the kings of Denmark are interred» Little of the original building now remains.
