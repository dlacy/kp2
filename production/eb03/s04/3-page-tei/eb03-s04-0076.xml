            <p>us that ſo late as the ninth or tenth century a man, when fairly purchaſed, was, in
                England, as much the property oſ the buyer as the horſe on which he rode, or the ox
                which dragged his plough. In the ſame country, now ſo nobly tenacious of freedom and
                the rights of man, a ſpecies of ſlavery ſimilar to that which prevailed among the
                ancient Germans ſubſiſted even to the end of the ſixteenth century. This appears
                from a commiſſion iſſued by Queen Elizabeth in 1574, for inquiring into the lands
                and goods of all her <hi rend="italic">bond-men</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >bond-women</hi> in the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Somerſet,and Glouceſter, in
                order to compound with them for their manumiſſion, that they might enjoy their lands
                and goods as freemen @@*. In Scotland there certainly exiſted an order of ſlaves or
                bond-men, who tilled the ground, were attached to the soil, and with it were
                transferable from one proprietor to another, at a period <hi rend="italic">ſo</hi>
                late as the thirteenth century ; but when or how thoſe villains, as they were
                called, obtained their freedom, ſeems to be unknown to every lawyer and antiquary of
                the preſent day. Coalliers and ſalters were, in the ſame country, ſlaves till little
                more than 20 years ago, that they were manumitted by an act of the Britiſh
                legiſlature, and reſtored to the rights of freemen and citizens. Before that period
                the ſons of coalliers could follow no buſineſs but that of their fathers ; nor were
                they at liberty to ſeek employment in any other mines than thoſe to which they were
                attached by birth, without the conſent of the lord of the manor, who, if he had no
                uſe for their ſervices himſelf, transferred them by a written deed to ſome
                neighbouring proprietor.</p>
            <p>That the ſavage nations of Africa were at any period of hiſtory exempted from this
                opprobrium of our nature which ſpread over all the reſt of the world, the
                enlightened reader will not ſuppoſe. It is indeed in that vaſt country that ſlavery
                has in every age appeared in its uglieſt form. We have already obſerved, that about
                the era of the Trojan war, a commerce in ſlaves was carried on between Phoenicia and
                Lybia : and the Carthaginians, who were a colony of Phoenicians, and revered the
                cuſtoms, manners, and religion of their parent ſtate, undoubtedly continued the
                Tyrian traffic in human fleſh with the interior tribes of Africa. Of this we might
                reſt aſſured, although we had no other evidence of the fact than what results from
                the practice of human ſacrifices ſo prevalent in the republic of Carthage. The
                genuine inſtincts of nature are often ſubdued by dire ſuperſtition, but they cannot
                be wholly eradicated ; and the rich Carthaginian, when a human victim was demanded
                from him to the gods, would be ready to ſupply the place of his own child by the ſon
                of a poor ſtranger, persidiouſly purchaſed at whatever price. That this was, indeed,
                a very common practice among them, we learn from the teſtimony of various
                hiſtorians@@*, who aſſure us, that when Agathocles the tyrant of Syracuſe had
                overthrown their generals Hanno and Bomilcar, and threatened Carthage itſelf with a
                ſiege, the people attributed their misfortunes to the juſt anger of Saturn for
                having been worſhipped, for ſome years, by the ſacrifices of children meanly born
                and ſecretly <hi rend="italic">bought,</hi> inſtead of thoſe of noble extraction.
                Theſe ſubſtitutions of one offering for another were conſidered as a profane
                deviation from the religion of their fore- fathers ; and therefore to expiate the
                guilt of ſo horrid an impiety, a ſacriſice of two hundred children of the</p>
            <p>firſt rank was on that occaſion made to the bloody god. As the Carthaginians were a
                commercial people, we cannot ſuppoſe that they purchaſed ſlaves only for ſacrifices.
                They undoubtedly condemned many of their priſoners of war to the ſtate of ſervitude,
                and either sold them to foreigners, or diſtributed them among their ſenators and the
                leaders of their armies. Hanno, who endeavoured to uſurp the ſupreme power in
                Carthage whilſt that republic was engaged in war with Timoleon in Sicily @@*, armed
                twenty thouſand of his ſlaves in order to carry his nefarious purpoſe into execution
                ; and Hannibal, after his deciſive victory at Cannae, sold to the Greeks many of his
                priſoners whom the Roman ſenate refuſed to redeem @@*. That illuſtrious commander
                was indeed more humane, as well as more politic, than the generality of his
                countrymen. Before his days it was cuſtomary with the Carthaginians either to
                maſſacre their captives in cold blood, that they might never again bear arms againſt
                them, or to offer them in ſacriſice as a grateful acknowledgment to the gods by
                whoſe aſſiſtance they believed that they were vanquiſhed ; but this was not always
                done even by their moſt ſuperſtitious or moſt unprincipled leaders. Among other rich
                ſpoils which Agathocles, after his victory already mentioned, found in the camp of
                Hanno and Bomilcar, were twenty thouſand pair of fetters and manacles, which thoſe
                generals had provided for ſuch of the Sicilian prisoners as they intended to
                preſerve alive and reduce to a ſtate of ſlavery.</p>
            <p>With the ancient ſtate of the other African nations we are but very little
                acquainted. The Numidians, Mauritanians, Getulians, and Garamantes, are indeed
                mentioned by the Roman hiſtorians, who give us ample details of the battles which
                they fought in attempting to preſerve their national independence ; but we have no
                particular account of their different manners and cuſtoms in that age when Rome was
                diſputing with Carthage the sovereignty of the world. All the African ſtates of
                which we know any thing, were in alliance with one or other of thoſe rival
                republics; and as the people of thoſe ſtates appear, to have been leſs enlightened
                than either the Romans or the Carthaginians, we cannot ſuppoſe that they had purer
                morals, or a greater regard for the ſacred rights of man, than the powerful nations
                by whom they were either protected or oppreſſed. They would, indeed, inſenſibly
                adopt their cuſtoms ; and the ready market which Marius found for the prisoners
                taken in the town Capſa, although Salluſt acknowledges @@* that the ſale was
                contrary to the laws of war, ſhows that ſlavery was then no ſtrange thing to the
                Nunaidians. It ſeems indeed to have prevailed through all Africa from the very firſt
                peopling of that unexplored country ; and we doubt if in any age of the world the
                unhappy negro was abſolutely secure of his perſonal freedom, or even of not being
                sold to a foreign trader.</p>
            <p>It is the common opinion that the practice of making ſlaves of the negroes is of a
                very modern date ; that it owes its origin to the incurſions of the Portuguese on
                the weitem coaſt oſ Africa ; and that but for the cunning or cruelty of Europeans,
                it would not now exiſt, and would never have exiſted. But all this is a complication
                of miſtakes. A learned writer has lately proved, with a force of evidence which
                admits of no reply@@*, that from the Coaſt of Guinea a great trade in ſlaves</p>
