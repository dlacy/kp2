                OnbyConstantine (Amm. Afarcell., xvi. 10). The existing&nbsp;remains of the two
                cellæ are mainly of Hadrian’s time, but contain&nbsp;patches of the later
                restorations. Between the south angle of this&nbsp;temple and the arch of
                Constantine stand the remains of a fountain,&nbsp;usually known as the Meta Sudans.
                This was a tall conical structure in a large circular basin, all lined with marble.

                of the Colosseum ;&nbsp;most of the latter has been removed for the sake of the

                subterranean passage. Such a passage&nbsp;actually exists, and has been partly

        <p><span class="font2">The so-called temple of Minerva Medica on the eastern slope of the
                Esquiline (so named from a statue found in it) is probably&nbsp;part of some baths.
                It is a curiously planned building, with&nbsp;central decagonal domed hall, probably
                of the time of Gallienus&nbsp;263-268 (see Canina, </span><span class="font2"

                Villa Farnesina, richly decorated with&nbsp;marble, fine wall-paintings, and stucco
                reliefs, equal in beauty to&nbsp;any works of the kind that have ever been found.
                Some of these&nbsp;were cut oil the wall, and will be exhibited in a new museum
                about&nbsp;to be formed to contain all ancient works of art found in Rome ;&nbsp;but
                the houses themselves have been destroyed. The laying out&nbsp;of the new Quirinal
                and Esquiline quarters also has exposed many&nbsp;fine buildings. One handsome
                villa, built over the Servian wall,&nbsp;may possibly be the house of Mæcenas. A
                very remarkable vaulted&nbsp;room, decorated with paintings of plants and
                landscapes, has been&nbsp;shown to be a greenhouse ;@@<sup>3</sup> at one end is an
                apse with a series of&nbsp;step-like stages lor flowers. This one room has been
                preserved,&nbsp;though the rest of the villa has been destroyed ; it is on the
                road&nbsp;leading from S. Maria Maggiore to the Lateran. The walls are a&nbsp;very
                fine specimen of tufa opus reticulatum, unmixed with brick,&nbsp;evidently earlier
                than the Christian era. Among the numerous&nbsp;buildings discovered in the Horti
                Sallustiani near the Quirinal is a&nbsp;veιy fine house of the 1st century a.d., in
                concrete faced with brick&nbsp;and opus reticulatum. It has a central circular domed
                hall, with&nbsp;many rooms and staircases round it, rising several stories
                high.&nbsp;This house was set in the valley against a cliff of the Quirinal,
                so&nbsp;that the third floor is level with the upper part of the hill. It&nbsp;is
                nearly on the line of the Servian wall, which stood here at a&nbsp;higher level on
                the edge of the cliff. This is identified as the&nbsp;house of Sallust, which at his
                death became crown property, and&nbsp;was used as a residence by Nero (Tac.,
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ann.,</span><span
                class="font2"> xiii. 47) and other&nbsp;emperors till the 4th century.@@<sup>4</sup>
                In 1884, near the Porta S. Lorenzo,&nbsp;a long line of houses was discovered during
                the making of a new&nbsp;road. Some of these were of opus reticulatum of the 1st
                century&nbsp;B.c. ; others had the finest kind of brick-facing, probably of
                the&nbsp;time of Nero ; all had been richly decorated with marble linings&nbsp;and
                mosaics. The line of the street was parallel to that of the&nbsp;later Aurelian
                wall, which at this part was built against the back&nbsp;of this row of houses. At
                the same time, behind the line of houses,&nbsp;were uncovered fine peperino and tufa
                piers of the aqueduct rebuilt&nbsp;by Augustus, one arch of which, forms the Porta
                S. Lorenzo. These&nbsp;interesting remains have all been completely destroyed. A
                fine&nbsp;house of the end of the 1st century a.d., with richly
                decorated&nbsp;walls, was exposed in June 1884 against the slope of the
                Quirinal,&nbsp;near the Palazzo Colonna ; it was immediately destroyed to
                make&nbsp;room for new buildings.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The prætorian camp was first made permanent and surrounded with a
                strong wall by the emperor Tiberius (Suet., </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">Tib.,</span><span class="font2"> 37).&nbsp;Owing to the
                camp being included in the line of the Aurelian wall&nbsp;a great part of it still
                exists ; it is a very interesting specimen of&nbsp;early imperial brick-facing. The
                wall is only 12 to 14 feet high,&nbsp;and has thinly scattered battlements, at
                intervals of 20 feet. The&nbsp;north gate </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">(Porta Pmneipalis Dextra)</span><span class="font2"> is
                ιvell preserved; it had a&nbsp;tower on each side, now greatly reduced in height, in
                which are&nbsp;small windows with arched heads moulded in one slab of terracotta.
                The brick-facing is very neat and regular,—the bricks being&nbsp;about 1⅜ inches
                thick, with ⅜-inch joints. On the inside of the&nbsp;wall are rows of small rooms
                for the guards. Part of the Porta&nbsp;Decumana also remains. This camp was
                dismantled by Constantine, who removed its inner walls ; the outer ones were left
                because&nbsp;they formed part of the Aurelian circuit. The present wall
                is&nbsp;nearly three times the height of the original camp wall. The&nbsp;upper part
                was added when Aurelian included it in his general&nbsp;circuit wall round Rome. The
                superior neatness and beauty of&nbsp;Tiberius’s brick-facing make it easy to
                distinguish where his work&nbsp;ends and that of the later emperors begins. Owing to
                the addition&nbsp;of the later wall it requires some care to trace the rows of
                battlements which belong to the camp.</span></p>

                closely&nbsp;resembles the great circular calidarium in the thermæ of Caracalla
