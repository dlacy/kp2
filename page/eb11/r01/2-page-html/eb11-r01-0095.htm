<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Light Railways</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The term light railways is somewhat vague and indefinite, and therefore to give a precise definition of its significance is&nbsp;not an easy matter. No adequate definition is to be&nbsp;found even in the British statute-book; for although&nbsp;parliament has on different occasions passed acts&nbsp;dealing with such railways both in Great Britain and Ireland,&nbsp;it has not inserted in any of them a clear and sufficient statement&nbsp;of what it intends shall be understood by the term, as dis-tinguished from an ordinary railway. Since the passing of the&nbsp;Light Railways Act of 1896, which did not apply to Ireland, it&nbsp;is possible to give a formal definition by saying that a light&nbsp;railway is one constructed under the provisions of that act;&nbsp;but it must be noted that the commissioners appointed under&nbsp;that act have authorized many lines which in their physical&nbsp;characteristics are indistinguishable from street tramways&nbsp;constructed under the Tramways Act, and to these the term&nbsp;light railways would certainly not be applied in ordinary parlance.&nbsp;Still, they do differ from ordinary tramways in the important&nbsp;fact that the procedure by which they have been authorized is&nbsp;simpler and cheaper than the methods by which special private&nbsp;acts of parliament have to be obtained for tramway projects.&nbsp;Economy in capital outlay and cheapness in construction is&nbsp;indeed the characteristic generally associated with light railways&nbsp;by the public, and implicitly attached to them by parliament&nbsp;in the act of 1896, and any simplifications of the engineering&nbsp;or mechanical features they may exhibit compared with the&nbsp;standard railways of the country are mainly, if not entirely, due</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to the desire to keep down their expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The saving of cost is effected in two ways: (1) Instead of having to incur the expenses of a protracted inquiry before&nbsp;parliament, the promoters of a light railway under the act of&nbsp;1896 make an application to the light railway commissioners,&nbsp;who then hold a local inquiry, to obtain evidence of the usefulness&nbsp;of the proposed railway, and to hear objections to it, and, if they&nbsp;are satisfied, settle the draft order and hand it over to the Board&nbsp;of Trade for confirmation. The Board may reject the order&nbsp;if it thinks the scheme to be of such magnitude or importance&nbsp;that it ought to come under the direct consideration of parliament, or it may modify it in certain respects, or it may remit it&nbsp;to the commissioners for further inquiry. But once the order&nbsp;is confirmed by the Board, with or without modifications, it&nbsp;has effect as if it had been enacted by parliament, and it cannot&nbsp;afterwards be upset on the ground of any alleged irregularity&nbsp;in the proceedings. (2) The second source of economy is to be&nbsp;sought in the reduced cost of actually making the line and of&nbsp;working it when made. Thus the gauge may be narrow, the&nbsp;line single, the rails lighter than those used in standard practice,&nbsp;while deep cuttings and high embankments may be avoided by&nbsp;permitting the curves to be sharper and the gradients steeper:&nbsp;such points conduce to cheapness of construction. Again,&nbsp;low speeds, light stock, less stringent requirements as to&nbsp;continuous brakes, signals, block-working and interlocking,&nbsp;road-crossings, stations, &amp;c., tend to cheapness in working. On&nbsp;the lines actually authorized by the Board of Trade under the&nbsp;1896 act the normal minimum radius of the curves has been&nbsp;fixed at about 600 ft.; when a still smaller radius has been&nbsp;necessary, the speed has been reduced to 10 m. an hour and a&nbsp;guard-rail insisted on inside the curve. Again, the speed has&nbsp;been restricted to 20 m. an hour on long inclines with gradients&nbsp;steeper than 1 in 50, and also on a Une which had scarcely any&nbsp;straight portions and in which there were many curves of 600 ft.&nbsp;radius and gradients of 1 in 50. In the case of a line of 2½ ft.&nbsp;gauge, with a ruling gradient of 1 in 40, a maximum speed of&nbsp;15 m. an hour and a minimum radius of curve of 300 ft. have&nbsp;been prescribed. Curves of still smaller radius have entailed a&nbsp;maximum speed of 10 m. an hour. It must be understood&nbsp;that a railway described as “ light ” is not necessarily built of&nbsp;narrower gauge than the standard. Many Unes, indeed, have&nbsp;been designed on the normal 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge, and laid with&nbsp;rails weighing from 50 to 70 ℔ per yard; a flat-footed 60 ℔ rail,&nbsp;with the axle load limited to 14 tons, has the advantage for such&nbsp;lines that it permits the employment of a proportion of the&nbsp;locomotives used on main lines. The orders actually granted&nbsp;have allowed 50 ℔, 56 ℔, 60 ℔ and 70 ℔ rails, with corresponding axle loads of 10, 12, 14 and 16 tons. On a line of 2 ft. gauge,&nbsp;rails of 40 lb have been sanctioned. In regard to fencing and&nbsp;precautions at level-crossings, less rigid requirements may be&nbsp;enforced than with standard railways; and in some cases where&nbsp;trains arc likely to be few, it has been provided that the normal&nbsp;position of the gates at crossings shall be across the line. Again,&nbsp;if the speed is low and the trains infrequent, the signalling&nbsp;arrangements may be of a very simple and inexpensive kind, or&nbsp;even dispensed with altogether. It should be mentioned that&nbsp;the act provided that the Treasury might advance a portion of&nbsp;the money required for a line in cases where the council of any&nbsp;county, borough or district had agreed to do the same, and&nbsp;might also make a special advance in aid of a light railway&nbsp;which was certified by the Board of  Agriculture to be beneficial to agriculture in any cultivated district, or by the&nbsp;Board of Trade to furnish a means of communication between&nbsp;a fishing-harbour and a market in a district where it would not&nbsp;be constructed without special assistance from the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a general classification the commissioners have divided the schemes that have come before them into three classes:&nbsp;(A) those which like ordinary railways take their own line across&nbsp;country; (B) those in connexion with which it is proposed&nbsp;to use the public roads conjointly with the ordinary road traffic;&nbsp;and (Neutral) which includes inclined railways worked with a&nbsp;rope, and lines which possess the conditions of A and B in about&nbsp;equal porportions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Light Railways Act 1896 was to remain in force only until the end of 1901 unless continued by parliament, but it&nbsp;was continued year by year under the Expiring Laws Continuance Act. In 1901 the president of the Board of Trade intro-duccd a bill to continue the act until 1906, and to amend it so&nbsp;as to make it authorize the construction of a light railway on&nbsp;any highway, the object being to abolish the restriction that a&nbsp;light railway should run into the area of at least two local&nbsp;authorities; but it was not proceeded with. Towards the end&nbsp;of 1901 a departmental committee of the Board of Trade was&nbsp;formed to consider the Light Railways Act, and in 1902 the&nbsp;president of the Board of Trade (Mr Gerald Balfour) stated that&nbsp;as a result of the deliberations of this committee, a new bill&nbsp;had been drafted which he thought would go very far to meet&nbsp;all the reasonable objections that had been urged against the&nbsp;present powers of the local authorities. This bill, however,&nbsp;was not brought forward. In July 1903, Lord Wolverton, on&nbsp;behalf of the Board of Trade, introduced a bill to continue&nbsp;and amend the Light Railways Act. It provided that the&nbsp;powers of the light railway commissioners should continue&nbsp;until determined by parliament, and also provided, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inter alia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">that in cases where the Board of Trade thought, under section (9)&nbsp;subsection (3) of the original act, that a proposal should be&nbsp;submitted to parliament, the Board of Trade itself might&nbsp;submit the proposals to parliament by bringing in a bill for&nbsp;the confirmation of the light railway order, with a special report&nbsp;upon it. Opposition on petition could be heard before a select&nbsp;committee or a joint committee as in the case of private bills.&nbsp;The bill was withdrawn on the 11th of August 1903, Lord&nbsp;Morley appealing to the Board of Trade to bring in a more&nbsp;comprehensive measure to amend the unsatisfactory state of&nbsp;legislation in relation to tramways and light railways. In&nbsp;1904 the president of the Board of Trade brought in a bill on&nbsp;practically the same lines as the amending bill of 1903. It&nbsp;reached second reading but was not proceeded with. Similar&nbsp;amending bills were introduced in the 1905 and 1906 sessions,&nbsp;but were withdrawn. During the first ten years after the&nbsp;act came into force 545 applications for orders were received,&nbsp;313 orders were made, and 282 orders were confirmed. The&nbsp;orders confirmed were for 1731 m., involving an estimated&nbsp;capital expenditure of £12,770,384. At the end of 1906 only&nbsp;500 m. had been opened for traffic, and the mileage of lines</span></p>
