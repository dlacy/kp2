<p><span class="font1">and in which small patches of consolidation are usually scattered throughout the lower lobes of both lungs. This broncho- or&nbsp;catarrhal@@<sup>1</sup> pneumonia is usually preceded by an attack of bronchitis,&nbsp;to which it bears an intimate relation, in some cases the small&nbsp;foci of inflammation may run together so as to affect the greater&nbsp;part of a lobe of a lung, and the distinction between such a form&nbsp;of broncho-pneumonia and lobar pneumonia presents such difficulties in the view of some observers, that they have refused to&nbsp;recognize any essential difference between the two. Usually,&nbsp;however, it is not difficult to distinguish the two affections both&nbsp;clinically and anatomically. Broncho-pneumonia is especially&nbsp;seen as a complication of bronchitis, and.while it more frequently&nbsp;attacks children than young adults, it is not uncommon in old&nbsp;people, especially secondary to bronchitis. It is frequent in children&nbsp;after acute infectious fevers, especially measles and diphtheria,&nbsp;and in cases of whooping-cough. It differs from the above-mentioned&nbsp;pneumonia in that it does not usually attack the whole of a lobe&nbsp;of a lung, but occurs in small disseminated patches more especially&nbsp;throughout the lower lobe. of both lungs. The accompanying&nbsp;fever is more irregular than in the preceding form, and the disease&nbsp;usually runs a more prolonged course. It is an extremely fatal&nbsp;affection in both the very young and old. Young persons who have&nbsp;suffered from it are not Unfrequently attacked by pulmonary&nbsp;tuberculosis subsequently. It must be admitted that we are even&nbsp;less certain of its bacteriology than we arc of that of lobar pneumonia. In some cases Frankel’s pneumococcus is found, and in&nbsp;others various other micro-organisms. Many of the latter are&nbsp;doubtless saprophytic, and are not the essential cause of the disease,&nbsp;but it is not probable that any one particular form of organism&nbsp;accounts for all forms of broncho-pneumonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The bacteriology of broncho-pneumonia presents no one micro-organism which can be definitely said to cause the disease.&nbsp;The micro-organism most frequently found, either alone or&nbsp;associated with other bacteria, is the pneumococcus, which&nbsp;occurred in 67% of a series investigated by Wollstein. Other&nbsp;organisms found are the streptococcus, particularly in bronchopneumonia following infectious fevers, the staphylococcus&nbsp;aureus and albus, and Friedlander<sup>i</sup>S bacillus. In some cases&nbsp;the bacillus influenzae alone has been found, and the Klebs-Loffler bacillus in cases following upon diphtheria. When the&nbsp;disease is associated with pulmonary tuberculosis the tubercle&nbsp;bacillus is found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tuberculous virus, the tubercle bacilli, may gain entrance to the lungs through the inspired air or by means of the blood&nbsp;or lymph currents. Also in some cases it has been&nbsp;demonstrated that tubercle bacilli may infect the&nbsp;glands of the mesentery following the ingestion of&nbsp;the milk of tuberculous cattle. In this the Government Commissions of Great Britain and Germany as well as the United&nbsp;States Bureau of Animal Industry confirm the findings of&nbsp;private investigators. It may be well here to summarize the&nbsp;views generally held as to infection. In the first place, the&nbsp;doctrine of inherited disease is discredited, and the doctrine&nbsp;of specific susceptibility is in doubt. Infants are known to&nbsp;be extremely susceptible, and this susceptibility lessens with&nbsp;increasing age, adults requiring prolonged exposure. As a&nbsp;mode of infection the sputum of diseased persons is of great&nbsp;importance. Infected food, especially milk, comes next,&nbsp;together with food infected by flies; and the mother’s milk&nbsp;is a minor source. Infection is not often received through&nbsp;the skin, but most frequently through the mucous membrane&nbsp;of the mouth, air passages and intestine; occasionally the&nbsp;infection is alveolar. Pulmonary tuberculosis is often secondary to a latent lymphatic form. The tubercle bacillus was&nbsp;discovered by Koch in 1882, and since then it has become&nbsp;generally accepted that the bacillus varies in type. The&nbsp;bacilli have been classified by A. G. Foullerton into </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font0"> occurring in fishes and cold-blooded animals, (&amp;) in birds, (c) in&nbsp;rats, (d) in cattle, (e) in man. Exactly how far they&nbsp;are interchangeable and can affect the human race is not&nbsp;definitely settled. They may be different varieties of the&nbsp;same species caused by differentiated strains of a common&nbsp;stock, or may be distinct but generically allied species. Von&nbsp;Behring considers that the bovine type may undergo modification in the human body, a theory which may lead to a complete&nbsp;change in our beliefs in the mode of entry of the bacillus. Recent investigators have put forward the view that the tubercle&nbsp;bacillus is not a bacterium, but belongs to the higher group&nbsp;known as Streptotricheae or mould fungi.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> The term catarrhal pneumonia has been usually regarded as synonymous with the term broncho-pneumonia, and this usual&nbsp;nomenclature has been maintained in the present article. We must,&nbsp;however, recognize that all simple acute broncho-pneumonias are&nbsp;not purely catarrhal in the strict pathological sense. For instance,&nbsp;a considerable amount of fibrinous exudation is not Unfrequently&nbsp;present in the patches of broncho-pneumonia, and some of thc cases&nbsp;of septic broncho-pneumonia can scarcely be accurately termed&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">catarrhal.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">The action of the tubercle bacillus upon the tissues, like most other infectious agents, gives rise to inflammatory processes and anatomical changes, varying with the mode of entry&nbsp;and virulence of the micro-organism. The most characteristic result is the formation throughout the lungs in the form&nbsp;of small scattered foci forming the so-called miliary tubercles.&nbsp;Such miliary tuberculosis of the lungs is frequently only a&nbsp;part of a general tuberculosis, a similar tuberculous affection&nbsp;being found in other organs of the body. In other cases the&nbsp;lungs may be the only or the principal seat of the affection.&nbsp;The source whence the tuberculous virus is derived varies in&nbsp;different cases. Old tubercular glands in the abdomen, neck&nbsp;and elsewhere, and tuberculous disease of bones or joints, are&nbsp;common sources whence tubercule bacilli may become absorbed, and occasion a general dissemination of miliary tubercles&nbsp;in which the lungs participate. Where the source </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font0">infection&nbsp;is an old tuberculous bronchial gland or a focus* of old tubercle&nbsp;in the lung, the pulmonary organs may be the only seat of the&nbsp;development of miliary tuberculosis for a time; but even&nbsp;then, if life is sufficiently prolonged, other parts of the&nbsp;body become * involved. Acute miliary tuberculosis of the&nbsp;lungs is not infrequently a final stage in the more chronic&nbsp;tuberculous lesions of the different forms of pulmonary&nbsp;phthisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In pulmonary phthisis, or consumption, the disease usually commences at the apex of one lung, but runs a very variable&nbsp;course. In a large majority of cases it remains confined to&nbsp;one small focus, and not only does not spread, but undergoes&nbsp;retrograde changes and becomes arrested. In such cases&nbsp;fibrous tissue develops round the focus of disease and the&nbsp;tuberculous patch dries up, often becoming the seat of the&nbsp;deposit of calcareous salts. This arrest of small tuberculous&nbsp;foci in the lung is doubtless of very frequent occurrence, and&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">post </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">'mortem</span><span class="font0"> examinations of persons who have died from&nbsp;injuries or’ various diseases other than tubercle it is common&nbsp;to find in the lungs arrested foci of tubercle, which in the&nbsp;majority of instances have never been suspected during life,&nbsp;and probably have occasioned few, if any, symptoms. It has&nbsp;been shown that in more than 37% of persons, over 21 years&nbsp;of age, dying in a general hospital of various diseases, there&nbsp;is evidence of arrested tubercle in the lungs. As such persons&nbsp;are chiefly drawn from the poorer classes, among whom tubercle&nbsp;is more common than among the well-to-do, this high percentage&nbsp;may not be an accurate indication of the frequency with which&nbsp;pulmonary tubercle does become arrested. It does, however,&nbsp;show that the arrest and the healing of tuberculosis of the&nbsp;lungs is by no means unfrequent, and that it occurs among&nbsp;those who are not only prone to become infected, but whose&nbsp;circumstances are least favourable to the arrest of the disease.&nbsp;These facts indicate that the human organism does offer a&nbsp;resistance to the growth of the tubercle bacilli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A focus of pulmonary tubercle may become arrested for a time and then resume activity. In many cases it is difficult&nbsp;to say why this is so, but often it is clearly associated with&nbsp;a lowering in the general health of the individual. It cannot be too strongly insisted that the arrest of a tuberculous&nbsp;focus in the lung is a slow process and requires a long time.&nbsp;Commonly a person in the early stage of phthisis goes away&nbsp;to a health resort, and in the course of a few weeks or months&nbsp;improves so much that he returns to a densely populated&nbsp;town and resumes his former employment. In a short time&nbsp;the disease show’s renewed activity, because the improved</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
