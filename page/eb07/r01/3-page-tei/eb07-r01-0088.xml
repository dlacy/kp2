Everything was quiet, every heretic had been ex-<hi rend="sub">l</hi> terminated, and the whole Christian world supinely acqui-<hi rend="sub">ι</hi> esced in the enormous absurdities which were inculcated upon them ; when, in 1517, a spirit of inquiry arose, and the empire of superstition began to decline. The person who made the first attack on the extravagant superstitions then prevalent was Martin Luther. By some it is pretended that the only motive which Luther had in beginning the Reformation was his enmity to the Dominicans, who had excluded his order, the Augustinians, from all share in the gainful traffic of indulgences. But this does not seem at all probable, for such a motive would not naturally lead him to deny the virtue of indulgences, whilst his conduct could not but exclude him for ever from any chance of a share in the traffic, which otherwise he might perhaps have obtained. Besides, this traffic was so contrary to the common principles of reason and honesty, that we cannot wonder at finding one man in the world who had sense enough to discern it, and virtue enough to oppose such a disgraceful practice. In all probability, however, the insignificance of the first reformer was the reason why he was not persecuted and exterminated at the very outset, as others had been before him. Another reason probably might be, that he did not at once attack the whole errors of Popery, but brought about his reformation gradually, probably as it occurred to himself.</p><p>The Reformation commenced in the city of Wittenberg "in Saxony, but was not long confined either to that city or to the province in which it is situated. In 1520 the Franciscan friars, who had the care of promulgating indulgences in Switzerland, were opposed by Zuinglius, a man not inferior in understanding and knowledge to Luther himself. He proceeded with the greatest vigour to overturn the whole fabric of Popery ; but his opinions were declared to be erroneous by the universities of Cologne and Louvain. Notwithstanding this, the magistrates of Zurich approved of his proceedings ; and the whole of that canton, together with those of Berne, Basil, and Schauffhausen, embraced his opi</p><p>nions.</p><p>In Germany, Luther continued to make great advances, without being in the least intimidated by the ecclesiastical censures which were thundered against him from all quarters. Continually protected by the German princes, either from religious or political motives, his adversaries could not accomplish his destruction as they had done that of others. Those princes who were upon bad terms with the court of Rome took advantage of the success of the new doctrines, and in their own dominions easily overturned a church which had lost all respect and veneration amongst the inferior ranks. The court of Rome had disobliged some of the smaller princes in the north of Germany, whom the pope probably thought too insignificant to be worth managing ; and they, in revenge, universally established the Reformation in their own dominions. Melancthon, Carlostadt, and other men of eminence, also greatly forwarded the work of Luther ; and in all probability the papal hierarchy would have soon come to an end, in the northern parts of Europe at least, had not the Emperor Charles V. given a severe check to the progress of the Reformation in Germany. In order to follow out the schemes dictated by his ambition, he thought it necessary to ingratiate himself with the pope ; and the most effectual method of doing this seemed to be by the destruction of Luther. The pope’s legates insisted that Luther ought to be condemned by the Diet of Worms, as a most notorious, avowed, and incorrigible heretic. This however appeared unjust to the members of the diet, and he was summoned to appear personally, which he accordingly did without hesitation. There is not the least doubt that his appearance there would have becn his last in this</p><p>world, if the astonishing respect that was paid him, and the crowds who came daily to see him, had not deterred his judges from employing summary means against the author of such a heresy. He was therefore permitted to depart with a safe-conduct for a certain time ; after which he remained in the state of a proscribed or intercommuned criminal, to whom it was unlawful to perform any of the ordinary offices of humanity.</p><p>During the confinement of Luther in a castle near Warburg, the Reformation advanced rapidly, almost every city in Saxony embracing the Lutheran opinions. At this time an alteration in the established forms bf worship was first adventured upon at Wittenberg, by abolishing the celebration of private masses, and giving the cup as well as the bread to the laity in the Lord’s Supper. In a short time, however, the new opinions were condemned by the university of Paris, and a refutation of them was attempted by Henry VIII. of England. But Luther was not to be thus intimidated. He published his animadversions on both with as much acrimony as if he had been refuting the meanest adversary ; and a controversy managed by such illustrious antagonists attracted general attention, the Reformers daily gaining new converts both in France and England.</p><p>But whilst the efforts of Luther were thus everywhere crowned with success, the divisions began to prevail which have since so much agitated the reformed churches. The first dispute occurred between Luther and Zuinglius concerning the manner in which the body and blood of Christ were present in the Eucharist. Luther and his followers, although they had rejected the notion of transubstantiation, were nevertheless of opinion that the body and blood of Christ were really present in the Lord’s Supper, in a way which they could not pretend to explain. Carlostadt, who was Luther’s colleague, first suggested another view of the subject, which was afterwards confirmed and illustrated by Zuinglius, namely, that the body and blood of Christ were not really present in the Eucharist ; and that the bread and wine were no more than external symbols to excite the remembrance of Christ’s sufferings in the minds of those who received it. Both parties maintained their tenets with the utmost obstinacy, and, by their divisions, first gave their adversaries an argument against them, which to this day the Catholics urge with great force ; alleging that the Protestants are so divided that it is impossible to know who is right or who is wrong ; and arguing from these divisions, that the whole doctrine is false.</p><p>To these intestine divisions were added the horrors of a&lt; civil w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ar, occasioned by oppression on the one hand, and by enthusiasm on the other. In 1525, a great number of seditious fanatics arose on a sudden in different parts of Germany ; and having taken arms, they united their forces, and made war against the empire, laying waste the country with fire and sword, and committing everywhere the most barbarous cruelties. The greater part of this furious mob was composed of peasants and vassals, who groaned under heavy burdens, and declared that they were no longer able to bear the despotic government of their chiefs ; and hence this sedition received the name of the Rustic War, or the War of the Peasants. At first this rabble declared, that they had no other motives than the redress of their grievances ; but no sooner had the enthusiast Munster, the Anabaptist, placed himself at their head, than the face of things was entirely changed, and the civil commotions in Saxony and Thuringia rapidly increased. (See the article Anabap<hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="sup">,</hi>πsts.)</hi></p><p>In the mean time Frederick, surnamed the Wise, elector of Saxony, and Luther’s great patron, departed this life, and was succeeded by his brother John. Frederick, though he had protected and encouraged Luther, yet was at no pains to introduce the reformed religion into his dominions. But with his successor it proved otherwise ; for he, being convinced that Luther’s doctrine must soon be totally destroyed</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
