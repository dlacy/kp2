To the whole he has added an appendix, and a copious gloſſary.—Of this work a leſs expenſive edition has been publiſhed in 7 vols 12mo, in which the general introductory obſervations prefixed to the different plays are preſerved, and the numerous notes abridged.</p><p>This judicious commentator has certainly done more for the elucidation and correction of Shakeſpeare than all who came before him, and has followed with indefatigable patience the only road which a commentator of Shakeſpeare ought to obſerve.</p><p>Within 50 years alter our poet’s death, Dryden says that he was become “ a little obſolete ;” and in the beginning of the preſent century Lord Shafteſbury complains of his rude unpoliſhed ſtyle, and his antiquated phraſe and wit. These complaints were owing to the great revolution which the Engliſh language has undergone, and to the want of an enlightened commentator. Theſe complaints are now removed, for an enlightened commentator has beep found in Mr Malone.</p><p>We have only farther to add, that in the year 1790 a copious index to the remarkable paſſages and words in the plays of Shakeſpeare was publiſhed by the Reverend Mr Ayſcough ; a gentleman to whom the literary world is much indebted for ſeveral very valuable keys of knowledge. In fine, the admirers of Shakeſpeare are now, by the labours of ſeveral eminent men, furniſhed with every help that can enable them to underſtand the ſenſe and to taſte the beauties of this illuſtrious poet.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SHaKLES.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Shackles.</hi></p><p>SHALE, in natural hiſtory, a ſpecies of <hi rend="smallcaps">Schistus. </hi>It is a black ſlaty ſubſtance, or a clay hardened into a ſtony conſiſtence, and ſo much impregnated with bitumen that it becomes ſomewhat like a coal. The acid emitted from ſhale, during its calcination, uniting itſelf to the argillaceous earth of the ſhale, forms alum. About  120 tons of calcined ſhale will make one ton of alum. The ſhale, after being calcined, is ſteeped in water, by which means the alum, which is formed during the calcination oſ the ſhale, is diſſolved : this diſſolved alum undergoes various operations before it is formed into the alum of the ſhops. Watſon’s Chemical Eſſays, vol. ii. p. 315. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Alum.</hi></p><p>This kind of ſlate forms large ſtrata in Derbyſhire ; and that which lies near the ſurface of the earth is of a ſofter and more ſhivery texture than that which lies deeper. It is alſo found in large ſtrata, generally above the coal, in moſt coal counties of this kingdom. Dr Short informs us, that the ſhale waſtes the lead ore near it, by its ſtrong acid ; and that it corrodes and deſtroys all minerals near it except iron or coal, of whoſe vitriol it partakes.</p><p>SHALLOP, <hi rend="smallcaps">Shalloop,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sloop,</hi> is a ſmall light veſſel, with only a ſmall main-maſt, and fore-maſt, and lug-foils, to hale up, and let down, on occaſion.— Shallops are commonly good sailers, and are therefore often used as tenders upon men of war.</p><p>SHALLOT, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Eschalot.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Allium.</hi></p><p>SHAMANS are wizards or conjurers, in high repute among ſeveral idolatrous nations inhabiting different parts of Ruſſia. By their enchantments they pretend to cure diſeaſes, to divert misfortunes, and to foretel futurity. They are great obſervers of dreams, by the interpretation of which they judge of their good</p><p>or bad fortune. They pretend likewiſe to chiromancy, and to foretel a man’s good or ill ſucceſs by the lines of his hand. By theſe and ſuch like means they have a very great aſcendency over the underſtandings, and a great influence on the conduct, of thoſe people.</p><p>SHAMBLES, among miners, a fort of niches or landing places, left at ſuch diſtances in the adits of the mines, that the ſhovel-men may conveniently throw up the ore from ſhamble to ſhamble, till it comes to the top of the mine.</p><p>SHAMOIS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Chamois,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Shammy,</hi> a kind of leather, either dreſſed in oil or tanned, much eſteemed for its ſoftneſs, pliancy, &amp;c. It is prepared from the ſkin of the chamois, or ſhamois, a kind of rupicapra,  or wild goat, called alſo iford, inhabiting the mountains of Dauphiny, Savoy, Piedmont, and the Pyrenees. Belides the ſoftneſs and warmth of the leather, it has the faculty of bearing ſoap without damage ; which renders it very uſeful on many accounts,</p><p>In France, &amp;c. ſome wear the ſkin raw, without any preparation. Shammy leather is uſed for the purifying of mercury, which is done by paſſing it through the pores of this ſkin, which are very cloſe. The true chamois leather is counterfeited with common goat, kid, and even with ſheep ſkins, the practice of which makes a particular profeſſion, called by the French <hi rend="italic">chamoiſure. </hi>The laſt, though the leaſt eſteemed, is yet ſo popular, and ſuch vaſt quantities of it are prepared, eſpecially about Orleans, Marſeilles, and Tholouſe, that it may not be amiſs to give the method of preparation.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Manner of ſhamoiſing, or oſ preparing ſheep, goat, or kid ſkins in oil, in imitation of ſhammy.—</hi>The ſkins, being waſhed, drained, and ſmeared over with quicklime on the fleſhy side, are folded in two lengthwiſe, the wool outwards, and laid on heaps, and ſo left to ferment eight days, or, if they had been left to dry after flaying, then fifteen days.</p><p>Then they are waſhed out, drained, and half dried ; laid on a wooden leg, or horſe, the wool ſtripped off with a round ſtaff for that purpoſe, and laid in a weak pit, the lime whereof had been uſed before, and has lost the greateſt part of its force.</p><p>After 24 hours they are taken out, and left to drain 24 more ; they are then put in another ſtronger pit. This done, they are taken out, drained, and put in again, by turns ; which begins to diſpoſe them to take oil ; and this practice they continue for six weeks in ſummer, or three months in winter : at the end whereof they are waſhed out, laid on the wooden log, and the ſurface of the ſkin on the wool side peeled off, to render them the ſoſter ; then made into parcels, ſteeped a night in the river, in winter more, ſtretched six or ſeven over one another on the wooden leg, and the knife paſſed ſtrongly on the flesh side, to take off any thing superfluous, and render the ſkin ſmooth. Then they are ſteeped, as before, in the river, and the same operation is repeated on the wool side ; they are then thrown into a tub of water, with bran in it, which is brewed among the ſkins till the greateſt part flicks to them, and then ſeparated into diſtinct tubs, till they ſwell, and rife of themſelves above the water. By this means the remains of the lime are cleared out ; they are then wrung out, hung up to dry on ropes, and ſent to the mill, with the quantity of oil neceſſary to ſcour them : the beſt oil is that of ſtock-fiſh.
