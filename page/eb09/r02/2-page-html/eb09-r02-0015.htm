<p><span class="font1">envelops (or is overlapped by) its fellow of the opposite side, while its hinder part joins the sternum. There is&nbsp;no clavicle or interclavicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria</span><span class="font1"> has both a scapula with a mesoscapular process and a cartilaginous suprascapula, also a coracoid with a large cartilaginous epicoracoid. There is an interclavicle, the diverging anterior arms of which, as clavicles,&nbsp;are connected by ligament with the scapula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font1"> have a simple girdle, consisting only of a scapula with a cartilaginous suprascapula and a coracoid without processes or epicoracoid, nor are there any&nbsp;clavicles but only a median anteroposteriorly directed&nbsp;interclavicle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia</span><span class="font1"> the girdle lies between the dorsal and ventral shields. The dorsal division is a columnar scapula,&nbsp;which ascends to be connected by ligament or cartilage,&nbsp;which sometimes contains points of ossification, with the&nbsp;transverse process of the first thoracic vertebra. Of the&nbsp;bifold ventral division, the anterior bone is a direct continuation of the scapula, and connects itself with the interclavicle of the plastron, whilst the posterior bone is a&nbsp;coracoid and ends freely (there being no sternum). In&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis</span><span class="font1"> the end of the right coracoid underlies that of the&nbsp;left coracoid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Pelvic Girdle.—</span><span class="font1">This girdle only becomes connected with the dorsal part of the appendicular skeleton—to wit,&nbsp;where it abuts against the sacral vertebræ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In general each of its halves consists of a dorsal division more or less simple and columnar, the ilium, united to the vertebral column by cartilage, and of a bifold ventral&nbsp;division, the parts of which, pubis and ischium, unite in&nbsp;the middle line by the intervention of a median longitudinal cartilage or ligament, a process extending forwards&nbsp;from the front margin of the more anterior part—the&nbsp;pubis—while an azygous bone, the os cloacæ, extends backwards from behind the symphysis formed by the junction&nbsp;of the more posterior part, the ischium, with its fellow&nbsp;of the opposite side. The ilium, pubis, and ischium form&nbsp;the acetabulum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although it has been elsewhere already described, it may be well again to mention here that in certain extinct Reptiles not only is the ilium greatly expanded&nbsp;above antero-ρosteriorly but the pubis sends back a long&nbsp;slender post-pubis nearly parallel with the ischium and&nbsp;closely resembling the so-called pubis of Birds.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidia</span><span class="font1"> the pelvic girdle is generally entirely absent, and, when a rudiment is present, that rudiment is&nbsp;never united with the axial skeleton. It may consist&nbsp;merely of a pair of subparallel slender pubic spicules or&nbsp;cartilages, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops,</span><span class="font1"> or of a rudimentary ilium,&nbsp;pubis, and ischium on each side, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cylindrophis, Ilysia,&nbsp;Stenostoma,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boa</span><span class="font1">. A rudimentary pelvis also exists in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Python, Eryx,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tortrix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Saurians the girdle may also be detached from the axial skeleton and most rudimentary, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepidostenon,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">where it consists of no</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">more than in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Typh-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lops,</span><span class="font1"> and in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">where each half of it</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">consists of an elon-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">gated ossicle with three</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">processes correspond-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ing to the three nor-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">mal pelvic bones. It</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">may be even more simple and yet attached to the vertebral column, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Acontias, Pseudopus,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophisaurus.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">In all Saurians with ordinary hind limbs the pelvic girdle is fully developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Chelonians have long ilia nearly vertical in position and with a cartilaginous margin. The pubis and ischium form&nbsp;an acute angle, and&nbsp;are only connected with&nbsp;their fellows of the&nbsp;opposite side by ligament. There is no os&nbsp;cloacæ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria</span><span class="font1"> has a la-certilian pelvis. The pubis has a small forwardly extending process, and the ischium&nbsp;a much more prominent backwardly extending one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodilia</span><span class="font1"> the acetabulum is formed by the ilium and ischium only, and is imperfectly ossified internally. The two ischia are united by synchondrosis, and&nbsp;each develops a forwardly extending process contributing&nbsp;to close the acetabulum, from which the pubic bone&nbsp;extends forwards, downwards, and inwards. The two&nbsp;pubic bones are only united together by membrane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia</span><span class="font1"> have the pelvic girdle, like the pectoral one, enclosed between the carapace and plastron. In most&nbsp;forms it is not united with either shield, the ilium being&nbsp;merely attached to the transverse processes of the sacral&nbsp;vertebræ. In some forms, however, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelys,&nbsp;Chelodina, Pelomedusa,</span><span class="font1"> and others, the ilia firmly unite with&nbsp;the posterior plates of the carapace, while the ischia and&nbsp;pubes unite with the plastron. The three bones concur to&nbsp;form the acetabulum, and the two pubes and the two ischia&nbsp;respectively unite in ventral symphyses. The space between the pubis and ischium of either side, the obturator&nbsp;foramen, is in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis</span><span class="font1"> separated from that of&nbsp;the other side by a ligament only, which proceeds from the&nbsp;ischiatic symphysis forwards to the pubic symphysis. In&nbsp;the Land Tortoises, however, the pubes and ischia so&nbsp;expand entrally that the obturator foramen is (on each&nbsp;side) enclosed by the junction of the pubis and ischium of&nbsp;either side at their distal ends. Each pubis has ordinarily&nbsp;a downwardly bent spinous process at its anterior margin,&nbsp;and the ischium often has a process projecting from its&nbsp;hinder margin. The pubes are generally widely expanded&nbsp;bones, very much larger than either the ischia or the ilia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Pectoral Limb.—</span><span class="font1">The skeleton of this limb in its full and normal differentiation resembles in its main features&nbsp;that of Mammals ; it may, however, be simplified to a greater&nbsp;extent than in any other air-breathing Vertebrate class, and&nbsp;this according to two modes of simplification. Thus it may&nbsp;be a relatively minute member ending in what is (at least&nbsp;practically) but a single digit, as in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhodona.@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> It may, on&nbsp;the contrary, be simplified by being made up of parts all so&nbsp;exceedingly similar that the typical differentiation of the&nbsp;limb can be with difficulty traced, while the digital elements&nbsp;seem to indicate more than pentadactylism, as in the extinct&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyosauri.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A peculiar complexity and extreme differentiation of this limb, however, exists, as is well known, in another extinct&nbsp;group, the Pterodactyles, wherein the outermost or ulnar&nbsp;digit is enormously elongated so as to support the wing&nbsp;membrane as do the four digits of existing Bats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The following are the main conditions of the limb met with in the existing Reptilian orders. In most </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertilia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">there is an elongated humerus, the proximal end of which&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">is compressed and furnished with two tuberosities.
