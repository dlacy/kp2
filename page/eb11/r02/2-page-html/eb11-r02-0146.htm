It condenses readily with aldehydes, yielding with formaldehyde, on the&nbsp;addition ot a little hydrochloric acid, methylene diresorcin&nbsp;[(HO)<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;"> -C<sub>6</sub>HjI<sub>2</sub></span><span class="font2"> -CH<sub>2</sub>, whilst with chloral hydrate, in the presence&nbsp;of potassium bisulphate, it yields the lactone of tetra-oxydiphenyl&nbsp;methane carboxylic acid (J. T. Hewitt and F. G. Pope, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jour.&nbsp;Chem. Soc.,</span><span class="font2"> 1897, 71, p. 1084). In alcoholic solution it cou-denses with sodium acetoacetate to form ß-methylumbelliferone,&nbsp;Ci<sub>0</sub>H<sub>8</sub>O<sub>3</sub> (A. Michael, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jour. prak. Chem.,</span><span class="font2"> 1888 [2], 37, 470).&nbsp;With concentrated nitric acid, in the presence of cold concentrated sulphuric acid, it yields </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">trinitro-resorcin (styphnic acid),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which forms yellow crystals, exploding violently on rapid&nbsp;heating.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In medicine, resorcin, which is official in the United States under the name of resorcinol, was formerly used as an antipyretic, but it has been given up. The dose is 2 to 8 grs.&nbsp;Used externally it is an antiseptic and disinfectant, and is&nbsp;used 5 to 10% in ointments in the treatment of chronic skin&nbsp;diseases such as psoriasis and eczema of a sub-acute character.&nbsp;Weak, watery solutions of resorcin (ro or 15 grs. to the ounce)&nbsp;are useful in allaying the itching in erythematous eczema. A&nbsp;2% solution used as a spray has been used with marked effect&nbsp;in hay fever and in whooping-cough. In the latter disease&nbsp;10 minims of the 2% solution has been given internally. It&nbsp;has also been employed in the treatment of gastric ulcer in&nbsp;doses of 2 to 4 grs. in pill, and is said to be analgesic and&nbsp;haemostatic in its action. In large doses it is a poison causing&nbsp;giddiness, deafness, salivation, sweating and convulsions. It&nbsp;is also worked up in certain medicated soaps. Mono-acetyl&nbsp;resorcin, C<sub>e</sub>H<sub>4</sub>(OH)-O-COCH<sub>3</sub>, is used under the name of&nbsp;“ euresol.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Resazurin,</span><span class="font1"> C12H7NO4, obtained by the action of nitrous acid on resorcin (P. Weselsky and R. Benedikt, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monats.,</span><span class="font1"> 1880, I, p. 889),&nbsp;forms small dark red crystals possessing a greenish metallic&nbsp;glance. When dissolved in concentrated sulphuric acid and&nbsp;warmed to </span><span class="font2">210° </span><span class="font1">C., the solution on pouring into water yields a&nbsp;precipitate of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">resorufin,</span><span class="font1"> Ci<sub>2</sub>H<sub>7</sub> NO3, an Oxypnenoxazone, which is&nbsp;insoluble in water, but is readily soluble in hot concentrated hydrochloric acid, and in solutions of caustic alkalis. The alkaline&nbsp;solutions are of a rose-red colour and show a cinnabar-red fluorescence. </span><span class="font2">A </span><span class="font1">tetrabrom resorufin is used as a dye-stuff under the name&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fluorescent Resorcin Blue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thwresorcin</span><span class="font1"> is obtained by the action of zinc and hydrochloric acid on the chloride of benzene meta-disulphonic acid. It melts&nbsp;at 27° C. and boils at 2&lt;13° C. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Resorcin disulphonic Acid&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(HO)»CeH<sub>2</sub>(HSOji)2, is a deliquescent mass obtained by the&nbsp;action of sulphuric acid on resorcin (H. Fischer, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monats.,</span><span class="font1"> 1881,&nbsp;2, p. 321). It is easily soluble in water and decomposes when&nbsp;heated to ioo° C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. (1). </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anatomy</span><span class="font2">—The respiratory tract consists of the nasal cavities, the pharynx, the larynx, the&nbsp;trachea, the bronchi and the lungs, but of these the two first&nbsp;parts have been treated in separate articles (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Olfactory&nbsp;System</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pharynx).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">larynx</span><span class="font2"> is the upper part of the air tube which is specially modified for the production of notes of varying pitch, though&nbsp;it is not responsible for the whole of the voice. Its framework is made up of several cartilages which are moved on one&nbsp;another by muscles, and it is lined internally by mucous membrane which is continuous above with that of the pharynx and&nbsp;below with that of the trachea or windpipe. The larynx is&nbsp;situated in the front of the neck and corresponds to the. fourth,&nbsp;fifth and sixth cervical vertebrae. For its superficial anatomy&nbsp;see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Anatomy, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Superficial and Artistic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">thyroid cartilage</span><span class="font2"> (see fig. 1) is the largest, and consists of two plates or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">alae</span><span class="font2"> which are joined in the mid-ventral line.&nbsp;At the upper part of their junction is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">thyroid notch</span><span class="font2"> and just&nbsp;below that is a forward projection, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pomum Adami,</span><span class="font2"> best&nbsp;marked in adult males. From the upper part of the posterior&nbsp;border of each ala the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">superior cornu</span><span class="font2"> rises up to be joined&nbsp;to the tip of the great cornu of the hyoid bone by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lateral&nbsp;thy r ο-hy oid ligament,</span><span class="font2"> while from the lower part of the same&nbsp;border the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">inferior cornu</span><span class="font2"> passes down to be fastened to the&nbsp;cricoid cartilage by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">crico-thyroid</span><span class="font2"> capsule. From the upper&nbsp;border of each ala the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">thyro-hyoid membrane</span><span class="font2"> runs up to the&nbsp;hyoid bone, while near the back of the outer surface of each&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">oblique line of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">the thyroid cartilage</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">runs downward and</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cricoid cartilage</span><span class="font2"> (see figs, i and 2) is something like&nbsp;a signet ring with&nbsp;the seal behind; its&nbsp;lower border, however, is horizontal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To the mid-ventral part of its upper&nbsp;border is attached&nbsp;the mesial part of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">crico - thyroid&nbsp;membrane,</span><span class="font2"> which&nbsp;attaches it ,to the&nbsp;lower border? of the&nbsp;thyroid cartilage&nbsp;though the lateral&nbsp;parts of this membrane pass up internally to the&nbsp;thyroid cartilage&nbsp;and their upper&nbsp;free edges form the&nbsp;true </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vocal cords.</span><span class="font2"> On&nbsp;the summit of the signet part of the cricoid are placed&nbsp;the two </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">arytenoid cartilages</span><span class="font2"> (see fig. 2), each of which&nbsp;forms a pyramid with its apex upward and with an&nbsp;anterior posterior and internal or mesial surface. The base&nbsp;articulates with the cricoid by a concave facet, surrounded&nbsp;by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">crico-arytenoid capsule,</span><span class="font2"> and the two arytenoids are&nbsp;able to glide toward or away from one another, in addition&nbsp;to which each can rotate round a vertical axis. From the&nbsp;front of the base a delicate process projects which, as it is&nbsp;attached to the true vocaI cord, is called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vocal process,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">while from the outer part of the base another stouter process</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
