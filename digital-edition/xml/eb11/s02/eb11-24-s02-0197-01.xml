                <p><label>SANUTO (or Sanudo), MARINO</label>, the younger (1466-1533), Venetian
                    historian, was the son of the senator, Leonardo Sanuto, and was bom on the 22nd
                    of May 1466. Left an orphan at the age of eight, he lost his fortune owing to
                    the bad management of his guardian, and was for many years hampered by want of
                    means. In 1483 he accompanied his cousin Mario, who was one of the three <hi
                        rend="italic">sindici inquisitori</hi> deputed to hear appeals from the
                    decisions of the <hi rend="italic">rettori,</hi> on a tour through Istria and
                    the mainland provinces, and he wrote a minute account of his experiences in his
                    diary. Wherever he went he sought out learned men, examined libraries, and
                    copied inscriptions. The result of this journey was the publication of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Itinerario in terra ferma</hi> and a collection of Latin
                    inscriptions. Sanuto was elected a member of the Maggior Consiglio when only
                    twenty years old (the legal age was twenty-five) solely on account of his merit,
                    and he became a senator in 1498; he noted down everything that was said and done
                    in those assemblies and obtained permission to examine the secret archives of
                    the state. He collected a fine library, which was especially rich in MSS. and
                    chronicles both Venetian and foreign, including the famous Altino chronicle, the
                    basis of early Venetian history, and became the friend of all the learned men of
                    the day, Aldo Mannzio dedicating to him his editions of the works of Angelo
                    Poliziano and of the poems of Ovid. It was a great grief to Sanuto when Andrea
                    Navagero was appointed the official historian to continue the history of the
                    republic from the point where Marco Antonio Sabellico left off, and a still
                    greater mortification when, Navagero having died in 1529 without executing his
                    task, Pietro Bembo was appointed to succeed him. Finally in 1531 the value of
                    his work was recognized by the senate, which granted him a pension of 150 gold
                    ducats per annum. He died in 1533.</p>
                <p>His chief works are the following: <hi rend="italic">Itinerario in terra
                        ferma,</hi> published by M. Rawdon Brown in 1847; <hi rend="italic">I
                        commentarii della guerra di Ferrara,</hi> an account of the war between the
                    Venetians and Ercole d'Este, published in Venice in 1829; <hi rend="italic">La
                        Spedizione di Carlo VIII.</hi> (MS. in the Louvre) ; <hi rend="italic">Le
                        Vite dei Dogi,</hi> published in yol. xxii. of Muratori's <hi rend="italic"
                        >Rerum Italicarum Scriptores</hi> (1733); the <hi rend="italic">Diarii,</hi>
                    his most important work, which cover the period from the 1st of January 1496 to
                    September 1533, and fill 58 volumes. The publication of these records was begun
                    by Rinaldo Fulin, in collaboration with Federigo Stefani, Guglielmo Berchet, and
                    Niccolò Barozzi; the last volume was published in Venice in 1903. Owing to the
                    relations of the Venetian republic with the whole of Europe and the East it is
                    practically a universal chronicle, and is an invaluable source of information
                    for all writers on that period.</p>
